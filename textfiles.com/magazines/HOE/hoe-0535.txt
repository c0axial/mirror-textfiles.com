         Ever been walking down the street and saw an ice cream vendor guy
 and wondered if he ever went to college?  Well, neither have I but after
 sitting a computer for two months going into "Author Lounge Chatrooms" and
 begging everyone down to your dog to give you some sort of glimpse of
 inspiration so you can write a damn file, anything's possible.  Well my
 glimpse of inspiration arrived in my mailbox today saying, "ALL YOU
 WRITERS WHO HAVE SLACKED OFF BETTER GET TO WORK OR YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
 CALL YOURSELF A HOE FREEDOM FIGHTER ANYMORE!"  So damn, here I am, getting
 to work, with my boyfriend IMing me and yelling at me because i sent him a
 chain letter, trying to read over the transcript of Hillary Rodham Clinton
 from AOL LIVE last night, and looking for a screen name of some girl I
 don't like.  So to narrow it down, with my whole writing career in Mogel's
 hands, slapping myself in the forehead going, "Damn, Jen, you better think
 up something quick you moron!", I'm ready to go.

        I remember being 15 years old, and saying "I love you!" to my first
 real boyfriend, Andy.  We were going to get married and all that good
 stuff.  Boy was I young.  Then came another relationship with a guy named
 Ryan, a mistake from the beginning, but hey, that's a whole 'nother story.
 When a guy begins to let his friends call you "Bitch", "Slut", "Whore",
 and stuff like that, especially when his friends meant it, you know
 something's wrong.  I am now, 19 years old, been with John for over five
 months now and can safely say I am in love.  I can say I want to marry him,
 I can say it will happen.  But the thing that pisses me off about today's
 society is how all those older people who married "young" and it did not
 work, feel we will be making the same mistake.  How is it that I do not
 hear stories of those who married young and are still together to this day?

        It's just not as popular I guess.  They all say, get an education,
 start your own life, be independent, grow up alone first.  But what fun is
 that?  It's not.  John is my sunshine on a cloudy day and you want to know
 how I know that?  Well, currently and for the last 2 months and for the
 next two months, John is living in Boston, almost 1000 miles away from me.
 He has discovered things about me that I never even knew about myself and
 showed me things I've never seen before (non-sexual), and we have grown on
 one another, like mold you know?  Just kidding.  Some say that I am too
 dependent on him and I probably am, but is that so bad?  I don't think so,
 so all those that do can fuck off.  It's hard for us to be apart, but we
 have already made plans for engagement this summer, and marriage ideas
 (only ideas john, no plans yet okay?) (he hates when I talk about the
 actual marriage).  I think it is good for us, we know we are meant to be
 and I can read your mind.  You are saying, "You must be out of your mind
 girl!  Only five months of knowing this guy?!  You are crazy!"  How did I
 know you would say that?
