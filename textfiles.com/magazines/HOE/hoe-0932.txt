	What makes a man, a MAN.  Seems like there's so many rules and 
 regulations that are associated with being male in America.  You must be
 strong, you must never show weakness, and above all you must not show any
 emotion what so ever, well except for screaming really loud and spilling
 beer when your favorite bowler wins some tournament.

	I personally don't follow any of these "rules," I actually break
 them whenever I get a chance to do so.  I actually cried like a bitch
 during "The Jungle Book" because I thought Baloo was going to die.  If
 you're looking for some manly man, I am most definitely not he.  I
 personally take pleasure in going around shopping, and giggling for
 absolutely no reason at all...

	-Shit wait, my fraternity brother just walked into the room-

	As I was just fucking saying, I honestly fucking hate pussies who
 cry like little bitches whenever something happens.  Its like they got no
 damn balls at all.  I personally know I can kick all their asses with a
 single kick of my steel-toed boots.  I wont cry for any chick, if she
 wants to fucking leave me then she can go ahead with it I don't care one
 damn bit.

	I want a girl who knows what she's got and ain't afraid of showing
 it.  Like I saw this chick with a T-shirt that said, "I'm tighter then
 you're sister."  I looked her up and down and knew I was going to fuck
 her that night.  It's simple as that man, easy in and easy out.  But I
 hate those loose ass girls, its like fucking a damn warm glass of water.  
 It's just a waste of a bottle of J.D. and a new condom...

	-Heh, ok he's gone-

	Well like I was just about to say, I personally feel there are way
 too many people out here who just fake everything.  I personally accept
 that I am a "white boy" and am proud of it.  There is absolutely no
 reason for me to follow what all those other wiggers have done by
 changing who they are just to be down with the gangster rap crap.  I am,
 and always will be white to the bon...

	-Blah, it's my neighbor Lamar-

	As I wuz jus sayin gawd.  I am dah only fuqen mutha fuqa who be
 throwin down the reel sheet up en dis piece.  Shit my verse is so tight
 they can put a nun's cooch to shame.  Yo, you kep fuqen playin wiff me, I
 sware to god I will bus a fuqen cap in yo cracka ass.  Ohhh shut dah fuq
 up bitch, I will fuq you and yo girlfriend up you puss...

	-Good, he left-

	I just want to leave you all with this, be true to yourself no
 matter what anyone says.  You are who you are, just let yourself be free
 and show it to anyon...

	-Hrm fraternity brother is back-

	SO ALL OF YOU CAN FUCK OFF!!!
