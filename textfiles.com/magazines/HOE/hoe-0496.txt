        4:29.  

        we lie in bed and she sleep while i ponder.  what is tomorrow?
 what is love?  i figure out the universe while she rests her head upon my
 arm.  what _is_ love anyway?

        i lie there and stare at the window.  non-descript winter weather is
 oh so dull.  i'd rather have the rain of the spring, the humidity of summer
 or closure of fall.  winter just is.  living in the part of the country 
 where it gets cold enough to freeze but not quite cold enough to warrant 
 much snow makes winter the longest season by far. 

        i love the spring the most probably.  rain cleanses.  
 
        she hates the rain.  she says it is so depressing.  how can the
 water cycle be depressing?  it is life.  she wishes it would rain
 elsewhere, i wish she was someone else.

        4:35.  i can still get two hours of sleep before i need to be awake.

        i look at her and make sure its her.  ashley.  i sure do wish it was
 someone i cared about.  i really do.  girls seem to think guys want to be 
 with every girl on the face of the planet.  why?  there is only one girl i 
 want to be with, and thats the one person i destroy.  i am afraid of loving
 her or anyone else for that matter.  i live my life without the familiarity
 of love out of fear i might be myself and hurt.

        i try not to delude myself too much.  i make sure i realize quite 
 fully that i make the life in which i live.  i am responsible for my
 destiny of unhappiness.  i truly do accept it and am willing to live.  i
 don't want to live my life unhappily, but i have come to a few conclusions
 at my young age.  one of these is you cannot escape yourself.  i am pain,
 i cannot break free of that.

        4:41.  i need sleep.

        i get out of bed and sit in a chair for better view of the windows.
 i can't see many stars.  goddamn city with its lights.  i think i notice
 mercury, but that could just be a satellite or a plane or something.  isn't
 that some shit?  not a cloud in the sky and i can't see stars, tell the 
 difference between a planet and a device of man, nor open the window for
 that matter.  winter sucks.  the city sucks.  and i am tired.  great.

        "hey, why are you up?"

        "oh," i say quietly, "hi.  couldn't sleep.  decided to look at the
 night or sunrise or whatever."

        "mind if i join you?"  she gets up and decides to join me anyway.

        she sits next to me and leans her head on my shoulder.  i can't tell
 if she is asleep again or just sitting there watching the world pass us by
 with me.  i hope she is asleep.  i don't like being introspective when 
 people are thinking about me and thinking about what i am thinking.  

        i lean back in my seat ever so gently as not to disturb her.  

        4:45.
        
        i give up.  my decisions on how the world works can wait.  my ideas
 can wait.  my happiness can wait.  i am tired.  tired of no sleep.  tired
 of ashley.  tired of the winter.  tired of saying i love when i don't.  
 everything can wait.  i have a whole life to live, i have years yet to 
 find love and exploit it.  i have years left to find religion.  i have
 time.

        i have time. 

        i can wait.  can you?
