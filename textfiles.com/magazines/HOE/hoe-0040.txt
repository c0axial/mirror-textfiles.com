                        "A Little Bit of Reality..."
                                The Intro


        Hello, Welcome to the Circus.  You know a lot has happened since
the last time we Pseudo-Spoke.  HOE has gotten bigger, we've picked up a
lot of Support Boards, and some gNu /<riFiK writers.  This all makes me 
smile.  I'm sure that's the only purpose of any of this...to make me smile.

        On the Board front, you'll see our Support Board list later in this 
file.  It has grown tremedously.  I have one major problem with it though:
I can't think of any good Body Parts anymore.  If anyone can help me I'd
love a LONG list of ones that I haven't used yet.  If you give 'em up, then
I'll do something nice for you.  Who knows what, but YUPPER...I will.  As
for Writers, you've seen Abigwar's output sky rocket.  Who would have thunk
it?!  Also joining us are Chal e. Mac (The Complainer), Psycho Santa (the
uLtiMaTe wArEz d00d), /<0rrUpt (and his <snicker> controbutions), Logik
(Random Stuff Rules), and the S00per DOUBLE-PleX /<-RaD Black Francis and 
we got that really neat one-shot Story from cDc's Obscure Images.  This
bedazzled me because, as anyone that talks to me knows, I worship the Dead
Cow, and Oi has been one of my top fav cDc writers of them all.  Yippie!

        Also, I wanted to annouce, not the DEATH...but the fate of DaS.
The group is Digital Anarchist Society.  A group that put out a few clever
t-files with some actual originality.  Anyway, the group has suffered some
Communication problems along with the Main Board Crashing for Months.  This
added up to a loss of most writers.  I was talking to Mad Arab, and we both 
agreed on the direction this zine and their zine should take and came upon
the idea of a Merger.  Thus, now HOE will have DaS integrated in it and we
will pick up a few writers like Mad Arab himself.

        You know, I was thinking.   
        
        Anyway, I have run wanted to mention that I've run into some
interesting things in recent times here in the pathetic scene of 215.  Mind
you, we are better that MANY Area Codes.  It seems that nowadays the WaReZ
crowd's big thing is "LaMeRz!"  This guy is, this guy isn't... I've had it
up to here with it.  Observe that I didn't say that calling others lamers
makes you a LaMeR.  They are no "LaMeRz".  Got that?!  Don't use the LaMeR
word around me, unless in jest.  I don't wanna hear it.

        I like Spam.

        This guy or that guy or this thing or that thing is Lame?  No.  I
don't like the WaReZ d00dz.  I bash them because they are morons and they 
are immature.  The WaReZ scene is for little kids.  That's the simplicty of 
it all.  That's why I bash.  I am NOT against piracy, although my board has
nothing to do with it.  What I am against is the WaReZ scene.

        I will marry her.        

        There are a lot of d00dz here in Philly.  I have also dicovered 
that there are a lot of d00dz everywhere.  No Shit, eh?  Well, hopefully 
HOE can be a common link up of all the t-file boards in the world.  That 
would be nifty.  Do I have big goals?  Yes!  Do I know that this group is
going to be bigger than poop?  Yes!  Do I have to go the the bathroom? Yes!
That's how much I love you guys... I'm holding my blatter to write this to
you.  

        pHeAr Me!

        Other things?  Well, I wanted to also comment that I do not think
I am God.  Haha.  For some reason people have assumed that anyone that has
opinions that are against the SaKreD WaReZ W0rLd and run a t-file group MUST
have a God complex, and therefor must be completly wrong in what they say.
Well, I don't think I'm God.  I don't even believe in the standard "God."
Suck me, Bite me, and pHeAR me, 'cause I am just an Editor for this lil' 
E-Zine and I don't think I'm better than anyone.  Just more intelligent<g>.
HOE is growing like the Smell of a Train full of Dog Shit.  Well, that's a
bad metaphor, but rE/x\E/x\buH... n0 mATTuH h0w fAMouZ hOe eVuH gEtZ, wE aRe
nEvUh gOnNa fOrGEt wHeRe wE KaMe pHr0m oR oUr PeOpLe h0Mies.

                        "Voices on the Latest Fad"


                                                    --> By Moggie

        Anyone know what the Latest S00per-d00per Fad nowadays is?  Well,
I know what it is.  It's the EVERY-BOARD-IN-THE-COUNTRY-MUST-BE-THE-CENTER-
OF-IT'S-VERY-OWN-GROUP Fad.  That's right, there must me 400000000 groups...
From the WaReZ, to the Ansi, to the Liturature, to the MuSaK, to the eleet
HaCkERz, to the Zines, to the Everything under the Sun.  There is a shit
load of groups.

        It all stems from the fact there are only a hand full of actual
groups with a lot of merit.  Of coarse these include people like cDc, uXu,
and of coarse Phrack.  It all stems from these groups.  What we see today
is some way-after spring up of the Computer Underground.  People could think
of the cycles in decades, that's how it's bascially done.  But we are part
of the sick left-overs of what was really once something amazingly cool.
We are now the afterbirth of that time.  

        That's what all of todays "newer" (i.e. within the last few years)
Zines really are.  Riding the Entropy waves that other Pioneers already
really have already done.  HOE is no exception.  However, since we are
riding the waves of other's "acheivements," we at least plan to do it the
best.  Enough said.

        I would like to Plug three new Zines that have sprung up around. I
have no idea how well they will end up doing, but I felt I should mention
them to at least give them a little publicity<g>.  The first is Image 
Writing, a group run by "Logik".  I have contributed some writing myself and
think it's a nice quality Literary Creative Writing group.  Another is ReD,
the ReALLy eLyTe D00dZ.  This is a great Parody mag that is bascially done
by the massivly sarcastic (i.e.: Good) writer Black Francis.  The Last is
something that hasn't appeared yet, but I KNOW will be very promising, which
is PISS.  People in Society Suck - A Zine that will truly Bitch and Moan
about the World in a Great new level.  Look for the first issue on January
1st on Mogel-Land.

      (as you can see we need more in area codes not listed here, but 
         we have too many 610 sites.  Damn this area code to hell!)

        [The Scene Opens on a simulated Stage.  There is a light and 
        quiet background piano version of "One Singular SEnsation" 
        playing.  Gathered in a single file line on stage is Slater, 
        Dark Phiber, Black Francis, Psycho Santa, Mad Arab, Killgore 
        Trout, Drunkfux, Ascii Express, and Boba Fett.  All the actors 
        are quiet and all have a look of total worry in their eyes]

DP (to PS): "Hey d00d!"
PS: "SHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
DP: "Hey D00D!! wHat iZ yEr pRoBLem?"
PS: "Quiet you L0ZeR!  I'm trying to stay quiet!"
DP: "D00d!  d0N't w0RRiE aBoUt eeT.  I'm g0NnA gEt AKsZepTuD!"

        [Just then we hear Mogel complaining in the background, he proceeds
        on Stage with a Chair and sits down in it]

Mog: "I tell you... These Couriers today!!  They don't got NO respect!!
      Why, in my day... they used to LOVE to spend money!  They USED to
      really care back then... I don't know what's happening with today's
      breed of 'em...."

CP (from offstage): "You're right sir!"

Mog (ignoring CP): "Well, what do we have here today?  Looks like you
                    were the rascals that were gathered up to join my
                    new group that I'm making.  You see, I'm in 314
                    groups.  It get's a little dull."

Sla: "Yah... I'm seen your sig!  It takes up two screens!!"

Mogel: "SHUTUP!!!!!!  Never speak unless spoken to!!! GUARDS!!!  Get rid 
        of this LAMER!!!"

        [Suddenly all the Extras come running in.. led by Serial Killer]

rr: "Right away d00d!!"
TkS: "YaH YaH! wE wiLL gEeeeT riD 0v ThiS guY pH0r yoU!"
TA (coughing): "I wish I had more lines..."
AW: (coughing): "All the people that kiss Mogel's butt get the good parts
                 in these plays."
rr: "Shut up you two!  Grab that LaMeR!"

        [They all grab Slater and Pull him aggressivly off Stage]

Sla: "NOOO!!!! WAIT d00d!!  I AM ELiTTeeeeeeeeeEEEEeeEEeeEeEeEeeEEee..."

         [The Sound of a Magnum is heard in the Background at
        the same moment Slater stops screaming.  Coincidence?]

Mog: "That should teach him a LeZZ0n he won't forget.  On to BuZiNeZZ.  
      All of You here are possible applicats for the gNu group that's
      coming out.  Yes, it hasn't been put out yet, but it's going to
      be called AKL.  A /<h0RuZ LiNe.  It's going to be very /<001.
      Any Questions?"
AE: "Yah!  Like what does it do or something?"
Mog: "SILENCE!!!  GAURDS!!!!

        [The Guards rush on Stage and Pull Ascii Express off.  
        After a moment we hear the sounds of torture devices 
        and screams from Ascii in the background]

Mog: "As I was saying.... I need to hurry here.. I have an iCE meeting at
      3:45.  Those Ansi boyZ are ReAl PiCkeY about punctuality too!  This 
      group will be really RaD!  We are basically aNaKuRt sInGeRz!!  That's

      and this time they begin clubbing the "tar" out of Boba Fett in front
      of everyone.  Blood Flys in every direction and the eventual reminder
      of Boba Fett's body is almost unrecognizably human.] "YOU!!"

      [In the Background we hear Jay Snickering.  You see, in the first
      stupid /<-RaD play Mogel forgot to include him, even though he was
      listed as a character.  Jay lets out a short cackle as Mogel has
      only given him this tiny part in the play.  Jay is /<-HaPPiE!]
