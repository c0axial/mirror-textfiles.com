        "Allo.  My name is Sylvie Bilodeau.  I'm standing on the corner of
 what used to be Saint Lawrence and Saint Catherine boulevards.  I'm here 
 today to inform you that a terrible tragedy has been going on, and how you
 can help.  Men, women and children are starving, in a land that was once of
 great prosperity.  The thirty-story buildings you see to the right of me
 have long since been abandoned, and are being run by terrorists.  Children
 have died in these buildings.  Women have been raped in these buildings, as
 well as their bastard children.  The water has become tainted, causing
 innocent Anglophones to involuntarily speak and think in French.
 Francophone newborns have been poisoned, their mothers and fathers beaten
 and left for dead.  Throughout the streets, on large speakers atop
 streetlights, are endless Celine Dion tracks being played.  Gangs have
 taken over homes.  The idea of school is a long forgotten hope for the
 youth.  Hospitals are a thing of the past.  So I'm standing here today to
 ask for the help of you, the public.  For just $1.01 per day, you can
 provide a nutritious meal, education, and a Celine Dion tape to one of
 these poor, hungry children.  Just think, one of these innocent children
 would be given a hot, steaming bowl of poutine, provided by you and the
 generous folks at La Belle Province, as well as a can of Pepsi and a Mae
 West cake for dessert.  You will also be contributing towards the
 education needed for these young children. They would be taught the basic
 essentials of math, French grammar, and slang French, by the great Dr. Paul
 Rose.  And of course, the Celine Dion tape, a compilation titled 'Aimez Moi
 ou Mourrir', will be given to each child that receives a sponsor like you.
 We are begging you, here at L'Association des enfants de la république du
 Kébék, to give generously, and help yet another child grow up and live an
 adequate childhood.  Please, help us rebuild the country that was once
 Quebec, because one more lost child is one too many.  Merci."
