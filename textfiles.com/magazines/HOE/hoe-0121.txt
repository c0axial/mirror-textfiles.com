 [styx's note; this was in response to my compilation titled 'styx's ego'}

 dear mister styx,

 your EGO is more than just a good read. it's multi-functional.

 let me explain: i printed out your EGO, paperclipped it together and left it
 on the dining room table. i left the room for a couple of minutes and when i
 came back, a pot of freshly microwaved cauliflower and velveeta was
 dripping yellow #5 on your EGO. doubles as a hotplate!

 it was tuesday, recycling day, and all the newspapers were put out on the
 curb. and my lil dog was just fed a whole lotta scraps from the table, so my
 dad pulled out a couple of sheets from your EGO and put it on the floor and
 winnie promptly spread her legs and sat her little arse down and made little
 doggie diarrehas all over story #4. 
 
 i then folded up what was left of your EGO, stuffed it in my pocket and
 brought it with me on a train ride. nature called, and i went to the little
 girl's room and (horror of horrors!) discovered a veritable flood o blood on
 my panties. i didn't have any tampons with me, so i rolled up your EGO,
 parted my lips and stuffed your EGO up my bloody snatch. and i must say,
 your EGO has protected me better than anything with wings ever did! i can
 just see it now....an ad for your EGO with two women in white strolling
 throught a meadow of dandelions singing the praises of the femme protection
 wonders of your EGO!!@#@!


 satisified reader,
 vaselina.
