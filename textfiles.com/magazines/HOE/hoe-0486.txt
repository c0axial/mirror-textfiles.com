        I've have such beautiful dreams.  Sometimes I lay in bed and dream,
 (invading my hours of sleep, well, more so replacing them.)  I dream of
 people, of places.  of far away lands.  There are nights when I see
 carriages led by horses in a huge processional, in the honor of no one.
 There are times when I dream I'm laying in the the greass consuming the
 air with greed that is so vastly provided.  I see the sky and the clouds
 as they drift aff into another dream.  There are times when I feel the air
 on my face, the heat on my skin, the smell of the crisp air devouring
 every sense.  These are the dreams of a lifetime.  Of an infinite place and
 time, where sensation is an illusion and illusions, as we all know, are
 merely fantasy.
 
        There is a solemnity in these dreams of mine.  A security.  Far
 from the nightmares of storm clouds and devastation.  A oneness with
 everything and nothing all at once.  A separation within unity.  A
 happiness in sorrow, a light in darkness.  All of these dreams are like
 a child's kaleidoscope.  Swirling, an undulation fo shapes and colors,
 almost to the extent of insanity.  But, a kaleidoscope has no existence
 with out the sun.  If the burning, heavenly sphere blows it's last
 exhausted breath and dies away, so do the images it provided in a
 cylindrical tube.  Dependency on the sun is unhealthy and unimaginable.
 Yet, strangely, a necessity.  Why look into the ground for air.  Why into
 the light for darkness, why into yourself for peace.  A kaleidoscope of 
 disease and misfortune is all you'll see.

        There is a system of peace and government of which we all abide.
 No chaos, no deviation.  No outbreaks.  But, to dare to expand yourself
 from this box, is to become a creature far higher in existence than
 humans.  To become god-like, in a sense.  To feel freedom and growth, no
 longer restriction and contentment.  Enjoy nothing unless it is
 uninhabited by limitations, and fear.  Trust no one, unless it is
 insincere.  For sincerity is the root of trickery and lies.  Believe no
 one, not even yourself.  Growth within is like a butterfly.  It knows not
 it's destination or it's new skin, yet it lives the same; minute by
 minute.  Day by day.  Spread your wings into a new existence.  A glorious
 existence unto...

        "Postal, time for school."

        God-damn, what the fuck was I thinking.  I'd better lay off the
 caffeine.  Oh well, off to school.
