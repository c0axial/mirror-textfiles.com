 turning around with the world sometimes we forget that
 but then our laundromat days and 60 Minutes nights make
 us remember all too well since the drought the bucket
 has returned only with sand and the occasional scorpion
 covered with special sauce and dripping with the saliva
 like she was that day but it wasn't a day just like any
 other because the sun was slightly less yellow.

                                 i just took a little
 nap curled up with a kitten and hot chocolate and a
 Hustler magazine just like the good old days when we
 used to pledge allegiance and we were all so blissfully
 ignorant of everything that would somehow become a problem
 before problems there Was just Was and Is and I'm really
 enjoying this all fully I'm fulfilled, they say its
 faith I say its a smoke-filled coliseum with a thousand
 lighters jiving inside a soulful ballad so don't remain
 staid pricks for so long instead go outside put away
 the mouse and go for a swiss & pastrami on rye
 which, as we all know, seems like a good idea until
 you think about it with even a minimal primate brain
 it is obvious that we're here together and we're not
 at all like elm trees, more like the nuts: to interject,
 i'm thankful that no part of my body is itchy right now
 because i've chewed off all my fingernails waiting for
 you to put away the chalk and see that i'm the brightest
 student ever to take a spelling test, ignoble but
 interested in the arts and cultures of bacteria plaid
 across the dish turbid and turquoise and smelling
 worse than 
                Colonel Jackson did in 1814 although the
 British officers were very odiferous not to slight them
                to this day i've got hope 'cause I'm
 the Pope except smoking less dope 
                Jackson, Jackson, I've got a new 
 substance called soap
 rhyming like ghetto preschoolers after lessons from
 dre, building blocks mommy put on my socks what
 beautiful red locks you have doing whip-its all night
 but save some pressure for spraying cream on that
 crimson beaver strawberry shortcake 

 coins                                     P
    are made in Philadelphia, Denver,
        and San Francisco,                    D
                and for a short period
                earlier this century             S
   were minted in Carson City                       ... CC

                        that's in Nevada the        
 sharpest state in the Union                         

                        and i suppose its time
 for something w(sh)itty so you can keep reading on on
 ward of the state i suppose i should throw some 
 naughty words in here to keep some of you fucking 
 assholes reading even though i'd rather you were gone
 away fucking the love of your life in romantic wonder
 and mystery: yeah, i'm convinced that love is real, 
 warms your heart more than the biggestest 
 bongest hittest you could ever consume with 
 those two fleshy sacs that used to be lungs, but that 
 term is reserved for things colored red or some shade thereof

            You never did anything
                    Wrong.
           You aren't allowed to be

 can you please tell me where i am let me describe it
 top of Victoria Falls, python in my pocket and an
 unloaded rifle and Orion is getting ready to hit
 me again but i can still laugh because his pants fell
 down when he started the movement upward out of
 this depression of prohibition annihilation evacuation
 with no survivors except one lonely active reactor:
 revoltion against redundancy is the best we can do,
 and teach everybody the importance of bringing a compass

 seashells and cloudless skies and mild climates,
 fiery hope lights the way and we coast gently
 into the hangar, soft for all time and feathery
 not tickling only downy, rising above everything 
 so we can find real zeal and vigorous loins, because
 with the tongue of an angel nobody notices the 
					lack of wings

       This is a picture of the big-titted chick that sat
       next to you in math class.  A stare case!

	Jackson, Jackson, it gets real slippery
