                   -----------------------------------------

 Nicknames: barb, page, nightvere, staryvere, pagenwait

 Hometown: Born in Peoria, Illinois.  Raised in Normal, Illinois.
           Currently living in Columbus, Oh with boyfriend.

 Croutons or Bacon Bits: Bacon Bits all the way, bay-be!

 Favorite Salad Dressing: Ranch

 Do u drink: Not really.  Nothing alcoholic, I mean.  And I don't like
             to drink water.

 Shampoo or conditioner: I use both, thank you very much.  But as for
                         the brand, well, I get what is cheapest and
                         still smells good.

 Have you ever gone skinny dipping?: No, not really.  I guess I was in a
                                     hot tub naked with a guy who was
                                     naked... does that count?

 Do u make fun of people: Well, yeah.  Who doesn't?  I try to make an
                          effort not to be too mean, though.

 Favorite Colour: Blue

 Have you ever been convicted of a crime?: No

 Best online friend met through internet: Wow.  I've met so many of my
                                          friends through the internet,
                                          that I really couldn't limit
                                          it down.  But I guess I would
                                          have to pick the boy, Phil. :)

 That I have never met: What kind of question is this?  "Who is the best
                        online friend that I have never met?"  That
                        makes no sense. Okay, I'll answer who is the
                        best friend that I met through some other
                        medium rather than the Internet.                                                  Even then I

                        can't answer.  I love Andy and Ogre... and I
                        guess Drew too, even though he and I aren't
                        talking right now.  sigh.

 That I wish I had never met: Heh.  There are lots of you people I wish
                              I had never met.  I think it would be for
                              the better if I didn't name names. 

 Pets: I had to leave my lovely dog, Taylor, at home when I moved to
       Columbus.  She's a really cute Scottie/Schnauzer mix.  I miss
       her. :(

 Favorite Type of Music: Oh my.  Yeah right, like I can limit it to
                         something.  I'll just look at my cd's... okay.
                         I like techno, industrial, rock, classical,
                         dance, alternative... uhm... yeah.

 Hobbies: Reading, watching tv, just plain relaxing when I'm not at work
          or at school.  I love to drive Phil crazy.  I'm also still on
          irc quite a bit, even if not around as much as I used to be.
          I like driving    around in my car and I love to go on walks
          and to amusement parks.

 Sports:  Not anymore.  I used to do track, but that was decades ago.
          I have a fondness for badminton.  ...is sex a sport? :)

 Dream Car: I have a fondness in my heart for Oldsmobiles, since my
            first car was one.  I dig Mazdas.  And I really, *really*
            want a stick shift.  I love the cars that are the misty,
            silver gray color.  Mmmm...

 Type of Car u drive now:  Blue Toyota Camry.  It's my mom's car, but
                           she's letting me have it so i can actually
                           go to school and work here in this other
                           state.  The best part about it is that she's
                           still paying the insurance on it!  yay!

 Phrase or words you use too much: "sigh."
                                   "quit it boy"
                                   "stop it boy"
                                   "shut up phil, you know you can't
                                    sing/you aren't funny"

 Toothpaste: Currently I believe we are using Colgate with Whitening
             shite.  That's only because his grandmother sent us off
             with, like, a crate of it.  But when I lived in Illinois,
             I was raised on Aquafresh.  Don't ask me why.  I think
             just because it was cheap.

 Favorite Food: Well, I love just about anything made from potatoes.
                Baked, mashed, fried, chipped. :)  Basically, though,
                I love junk food.

 Current Boyfriend/Girlfriend?: Phil Huckelberry, the guy I'm living with.

 How do you characterize yourself?:  Caring, overbearing, bitchy, but
                                     full of love!  Perfectionist, yet a
                                     slob and a procrastinator.

 Do you get along with your parents?: Yeah, decently enough.

 Favorite town to chill in?: I love Chicago.  So many things to do and
                             places to go and it's chock full of
                             museums, *plus* it's right near water and
                             has a Great America right nearby!!

 Favorite Movie: Oh hell.  Many.  "The Breakfast Club" "Vampire Hunter D"
                 "The Wizard of Oz" "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" "The
                 Silence of the Lambs" "Killer Klowns from Outer Space"
                 ...just to name a few :)

 Favorite Book: Oh hell.  Many.  "The Hobbit"  "Alice in Wonderland"
                "The Shining"  I seem to really love children's stories.

 Currently reading: "A Crown of Swords" by Robert Jordan  and a book of
                    Stephen Crane's collected works

 Favorite Ice Cream:  Mint Chocolate Chip

 Favorite Alcoholic Drink: Kahlua, I guess.  I hate beer.

 Favorite Drink: Dr. Pepper

 What's your bed time: Whenever I'm feeling tired.  Varies between 1am
                       and 3am, I guess.

 Adidas, Nike or Reebok: Uhh... none of the above?  Well, I guess right
                         now, I would choose Nike.  Although when I was
                         younger, I always had to get white Reebok high
                         tops that had to velcro straps on the top.  I
                         did that for a few years.  Then I went to
                         capers.  Then i went to my Eastland
                         Dr. Martins.  I finally bought a new pair of
                         shoes.  Yeah.  I'm sure you all care.

 Favorite Song at the moment: Uhh... by which artist??  I can barely
                              limit it down to a favorite song by a
                              certain artist, let alone my favorite song
                              of all right now.  Sheesh.

 Favorite Musical Groups: Tori Amos, Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Bjork,
                          The Orb, Aphex Twin, Pet Shop Boys, The Cure,
                          Oneiroid Psychosis, Kraftwerk, Smashing
                          Pumpkins, REM, Pearl Jam, the BASS TURD
                          (not in that order :), and that's not all,
                          either.)
                         

 Favorite Subject in High school: Well, I loved English.  And Accounting.
                                  And I loved my Finite Math teacher.  As
                                  for my favorite... I don't think I
                                  could really say.

 Favorite Subject in University: I haven't taken enough classes to know
                                 for sure.  All I can say is that no
                                 matter what class it was, I skipped it,
                                 so they couldn't have been all that
                                 great.

 Craziest Person Or Silliest Person U Know: I live with him.

 What do u look for / are attracted to: Sense of humor, eyes, hair,
                                        boyish features :)
                                        Ability to put up with me....
