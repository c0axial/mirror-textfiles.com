        Yeah baybe..  I have bronchitis it's 10:09 A.M. EST, Sunday, July 15,
 1999.  I have no idea what I'm going to write about I figure I will just let
 the lethal combination of cough medicine, Nyquil and Advil run it's course.

        Mr. TanAdept is supposed to come over and pet Samba, I don't know if
 he can now because he's late for his flight and wont get to scenic NJ until
 3.  At 4-ish I have to go to my sister's apartment and have dinner with her,
 her fiancé, his parents and my parents.  My sister is 20.. and bald..  Meow.

        It might be a good thing that g0ff isn't going to pet Samba.  Samba
 is very shy and mentally unstable and he might run away again if he is
 exposed to a stranger again.  I named Samba after my soccer shoes.

        I'm a geek girl that plays sports but I still have a fat ass.  I just
 noticed I typed "dose" wrong in the title.. I typed it "does".. Can you
 believe I graduated secretarial school with typing honors?

        I'm watching the Woodstock coverage on MTV.  I could have gone with
 my friends Joey and Kevin from high school.  I'm kinda glad I decided not
 too it's the funniest image to me Joey in his khaki shorts and Izod shirt
 moshing around in the field with the mud-hippies.  If I was there I would be
 a mud hippie.  Because I am a gross dirty dirty girl... or something.

        But instead I have bronchitis, and I am sitting home coughing
 watching reruns of road rules, and wondering if my cat will run away.  I
 should go upstairs and get my CDs.  I was lying on the grass of Sunday
 morning of last week.  If it was 4 years ago I would be in New Hampshire
 right now.  If you steal my sunshine.  I suppose since it's the last week in
 July and it's a Sunday I would be on the beach with my friend Kara and
 Jewlie waiting for camp to start.  Anxiously awaiting my first Mike Johnson
 sighting of the summer.  I had the biggest crush on him like 7th -12th
 grade.  Tall and blonde in Umbros and Sambas playing volleyball on the
 beach.  I never realized it until years later but him and his friends made
 fun of me kinda bad.  Cause I have a big butt.  As if I could help that.
 They'd sing Baby Got Back when I walked by or Aiesha.  Mean boys.  It's a
 wonder I'm not an angry un-shaven feminist.  I think I need to change my
 look or something.  Normal is boring.

        Ooof some kinda medicine just kicked in I wish this headache would go
 away.  Maybe I should eat.  It's 10:32 A.M. I'm sad that Mr. TanAdept can't
 come pet my kitties.  L-A-T-E-R that week.

        I'm going to listen to this song over and over till I learn the
 words..

        Does he like butter-tarts?  What?
