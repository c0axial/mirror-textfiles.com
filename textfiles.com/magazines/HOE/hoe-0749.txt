 once apon a time there was a girl named mary.
 mary did nto have any friends at all.
 but mary rather liked having no friend at all.
 the one friend she had,
 was sick somewhere in a bed.
 the others thought she didn't
 care about her friend who had strange things inside of her.
 i wish i had a giant room
 where i could dance and sing all day to the
 music of organs and pipes and horns and
 and one night mary went for a walk
 under street lamps and funny clouds and the hazey
 moon with the hazey gray spot
 she found herself in an unknown place with an unknown name,
 somewhere out of a song she had heard.
 a somewhere with a red floor and a silly tree that liked to
 say it's name to the wind "meeeeeee" "mee"
 when she woke up she was in that trees arms, sleeping, sleeping
 and in her dream she dreamt of a bridge and a
 stream and giant spiders and what happen tomorrow and the day before
 on the table sat a book about cents or a knee or a flashlight or a tree
 but mary was cold and was not where she liked so she ran all the way
 back
 home

 and one day she died.  but no one cried except her family out of forced
 love.  and the sun rose and the birds sang a song of something far away
 and mary wished she could be there and not here or simply very far away
 she ended up sleeping on the floor next to a cat and a pen (blue) and
 something so sore
