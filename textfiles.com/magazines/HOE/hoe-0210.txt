 So soon?  Yes, we're back with a burning issue.

 ---------- Special Report: Girls Vs Boys ----------------------------

 We look into the deepening problem of declining boy education standards.

 Once again, last years exam results clearly indicate that girls are
 outperforming boys by an even larger margin than 1996. However, not much
 seems to be done about it by government. Instead, some people, women in
 particular, think it's a dilemma to laugh at: "I always said girls were
 better than boys! Now it's the boys' turn to suffer. It's their entire
 fault. We're the best; they're just stupid. I have GIRL POWER."

 Pardon me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the idea of women's liberation was to
 make sure everybody had the same rights and opportunities, regardless of
 sex?  It has become acceptable to disrespect males, while if any man were
 court saying, "Women are stupid" there would be uproar. Still, even more
 worrying is the age that boys are being subjected to such sexism. Boys as
 young as eight have been reported to saying things like: "It's no-good mum,
 I can't beat the girls. They're just better than us." Hang on a second,
 wasn't it the other-way-round 30 years ago? Weren't girls portrayed as the
 inferior sex? This demoralisation of boys' esteem has, and there's evidence
 to show it, made boys under perform.

 Is this an acceptable situation? Is it the women's chance to get their own
 back on males? I fear that this is the attitude taken by many women. It
 looks as-if the "equal" analogy has been temporally forgotten. Today's girls
 are being bought up with anti-male opinions - mothers (and fathers) will
 support their daughter with comments such as "Don't worry love, you'll beat
 those silly boys easily". "Girl Power" has become predominant lately, with
 role models of many young girls, like the Spice Girls, continually promoting
 Girl Power and "we're better than stupid boys" opinions.

 The anger of many women (even some that have never been victim to sexism) is
 being taken out on today's young males. I find this totally unacceptable,
 and this view would never have occurred the other way round. Males are
 scared to speak out against women, because more often than not they'll get a
 sexist badge plastered on their head - even if the issue was not sex related
 at all. But, as yet, a girl can freely speak about beating and being
 superior to boys thus gaining respect from fellow pro-female anti-male
 supporters.

 Has the pendulum swung too far? Or maybe that now generally girls aren't
 suppressed, they have been able to show their true selves, and are, indeed,
 better than boys. Has the race to ensure that the school curriculum is
 balanced and unfavouring gone too far in one direction? Certainly, I find,
 and know many other boys do, that the books on the English syllabus are
 almost definitely ones that suit girls better.

 In all, there is no true answer to why this imbalance is transpiring. It
 could be a bit of all the factors. Without doubt, the issue is still going
 to with us in the new millennium, and government and society will have to
 face it promptly when boys (especially younger age groups) standards decline
 yet further. Girl Power attitudes may become a thing of the past, and just
 as unacceptable as Boy Power attitudes. The real danger lies with not the
 older generations of males who can stand up for themselves, it is the new
 generations of under 10's who gain their entire wisdom of morals and society
 within that time - if they are made to feel inferior to girls at an early
 age, it will stick with them throughout their entire adult life. This should
 be avoided at all costs.

 ---------- Your Letters: Hanson Absurd? ----------------------------

 Dear Hype eZine,

 I was recently disgusted to read such absurd comments regarding Hanson in
 the last issue.  I was positively disgusted.

 Hanson have a huge amount of talent, and it's quite clear to me which sex
 they are.  I feel that your comments were unneeded and thoughtless.  I'm
 sure you would be insulted if you were referred to as needing a sex-change
 operation.  Once you are rich and famous, I will respect your opinion.  From
 now on I don't wish to read "Hype", so I'd be grateful if you could remove
 me from your mailing list.

 Regards,
 Hanson Fan, USA (received via email).

 Hype replies:
 A touchy topic for you was it Mr, Mrs or Miss Hanson Fan?  Yes, why did you
 go nameless?  Was that a vain attempt to hide the fact to your friends that
 you are a Hanson fan?  I can see how that would bring considerable shame on
 you.  Obviously, the sex-change issue is something close to your heart;
 don't worry, your secret is safe with me.  I haven't had any more complaints
 about that.  Maybe other people got the joke.  Your email address will be
 removed from the mailing list after this issue.  Then, after you've buggered
 off we can continue to slag Hanson off as much as we like.  Goodbye dear!
