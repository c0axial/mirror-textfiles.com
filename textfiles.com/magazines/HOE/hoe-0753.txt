        hi.  i can write a better story about clouds, and picnics and colors
 than mogel can.  gweenlobahehrehehehehehehhahahhahehehehehheheok.  heres my
 story:

        once apon a time there was a little cloud named little push.  little
 push sucked her little cloud thumb and had a little cloud blankie with a
 picture of a clown on it.  little push's FAVORITE color was blue.  She liked
 blue very much because blue was her brother.  blue was really a turtle but
 was really a color.  one day little push, the cloud, sad "blue! lets have a
 PICNIC" so they sat down on the grass and met their sister, picnic.
 picnic's favorite color was yellow.  so they they all layed on their backs
 and watched the pretty WHITEclouds go by.  blue said, "look! a turtle in the
 clouds!  oooooooooooooo... pretttyyy!"  the little push, the cloud, said "i
 am a cloud!  what shape am i??"  so Big Burd flew to the store and got the
 sandwiches for the picnic.

        meanwhile, on a little flowery mountain feild very far away, a boy
 named john, found a flower in the  clouds!  the end.

        see?  mine was good story. laaaaaaaaaaaaa laaaaaaaala
