          THE WONDERFUL SUPER MEGA INCREDIBLE HELPFUL NEEDED KEY: 
          
      B   = Back (away from opponent)      F   = Forward (toward opponent)
      D   = Down (South Dude)              U   = Up (Like North and stuff)   
      HK  = High Kick                      LK  = Low Kick
      HP  = High Punch                     LP  = Low Punch
      BL  = Block                          Wx  = Wait, x = # of seconds
      QCF = Quarter Circle Forward         QCB = Quarter Circle Back
      HCF = Half Circle Forward            HCB = Half Circle Back           
      ,   = insert the word THEN           +   = These moves are together

     Note   : the QC's start in the down (duck) position,
              the HC's always move toward and past the down position.
     Note 2 : There was a faulty Pre-release of this file that got around.  
              If it doesn't have this note, delete it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------     

        Ok, There are a bunch of bits and pieces of MKII Docs lying around,     
so I decided to gather them up and add some more stuff and come up with this
edition.  This edition is not complete.  There are some moves missing that
I couldn't find out or didn't know at the time of writing this (This does 
have a lot, however).  First, let me thanks some of the Internet people for 
haveing some of these moves available to look at.  
        Here's something to Note... These moves are not only made for the
arcade, but also for the most recent version of the game.  That's right --
There are different versions of the Arcade game!  So, if one of these
don't work, it may be too old a version.  The Babalities and the friendships
are for V2.0 and up.  The the hidden character, Scarlet, is for V.3.0 and Up.  
Like rumors?  Well, there's a rumor that Shang Tsung can turn into Kano and 
Sonya at the stage where they are chained up....and then there's the 
animalities rumor.  
        I love Mortal Kombat.  Mortal Kombat makes my life worth living
(Ok, So I'm exaggerating...), and I can't imagine a world without it.  This
game is just a game and should and *IS* taken as such.  With all the TV
shows (even the god damn POWER RANGERS) that actually do have kids imititate
violence, I don't see anyone pretending to rip another kids head off via
this game.  The violence is purposely ridiculous and the blood is not real
blood.  Hey Parents!  Instead of censoring the game, censor your kid! 
That'll save you and the game companies a lot of debate on it!  KEEP THE
BLOOD ALIVE!  Here's a character run down:
