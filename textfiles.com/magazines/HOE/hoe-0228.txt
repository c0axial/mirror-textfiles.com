        there is no amount of sadness that i can explain, not even a morsel;
 from the moment i pumped up the action and read that the lyrics did not say
 ONE SIDE REALLY LISTENED TO NOISE.  for all the anthems and all the freaking
 typos, this could not at least tell me that it was so correct.  so right in
 its injustice.  the truth lies in the direction of down.

	convenience store robberies always fascinated me.  the quick
 marteefartee the WAH.  how could one rob the little modesty of its hubris?
 the measly 5.10.20.  the almighty deer that comes crashing into your front
 bumpercar.

        placation of your sensations.  the rest of your mess.

	rapidly stabbing with a spork.  kind of catchy, eh?  say it to
 yourself, mantra it.  noisenoisenoise.

        the birthing of electronica is less than fruitful in the obliteration
 of the uncanned mind.  the classical theory, the monstering of instrument is
 pushed throughout vaginal walls with a tweezer that pinches the
 collaboration of cooperations.  to each its own, to might its fight.  where
 once there was a butterfly, now there is a gig-a-pet.  BEEP!  feed me!

        and as i solidify in the arteries of my pulse, i melt the wax that
 clogs your unaided hearing of jury by trial.  do not lose your humanity;
 birth pretty butterfly music through your legs and drip the static noise
 that pollutes your anatomy.  who cares about the poetry of your motions.

        ONE SIDE REALLY LISTENED TO NOISE.
