        I'm writing this file is response to some things I have seen going
 on in #ezines and the HOE discussion forum.  Here is what happens:  some
 people (styx, bF, etc.) don't like someone's (daisy) text file in HOE.
 they decide "Gee, this person is stupid!  I'm smart. I should try my best
 to make them feel like shit!  Making people feel like shit makes me feel
 good about myself!"

        So, these people get somewhere where they know this writer will see
 their critiques and personal attacks.  They insult this person's
 intelligence, attack their personal life and call their file stupid.  OK,
 I can understand that you may not like this person's text file, but what
 good does it do for you to make fun of this person?  Why not offer
 constructive criticism?  If you really hate this person's writing so much,
 don't read it.  Obviously you think this person is stupid.

        First of all, how someone acts on the computer isn't the best
 indicator of intelligence, but that doesn't matter.  What does anyone gain
 from such bullying?  Does calling this person stupid make them any smarter?
 why does it matter so much to you that this person is stupid?  Does
 bullying them give you some kind of sick thrill?  Does it raise your
 self-esteem?  The only thing I can equate you to is school yard bullies.
 The only difference is that you don't say these things to people's faces.
 You have to hide behind your computer.  Uh, yeah, glad I got that off my
 chest.
