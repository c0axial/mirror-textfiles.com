        there's that gnu game i wanna code, it will be called operation pc.  
 yeah, it's gonna be a pc game.  well, pc as in politically correct.  okay, 
 okay, pc = lame, we all know, but this game will be _special_ because it 
 will display explicit violence.  however:

        arab bases?  russian missiles?  princess rescuing?  get in the 
 nineties, dude.  the whole thing will take place in the u to the s and to 
 the a, like, land of the free, and a random procedure will decide of the 
 victim's skin color, sex, and sexual orientation.  there will be no 
 specific mission, it's only gonna be a shoot-them-up type game where you 
 kill whoever you see, uh, almost whoever actually.

        for example, there's gonna be a special trick starting from level 3:  
 there will be a big lack of white men in the enemies camp, so you'll have 
 to _find_ them.  or else, you'll lose a lot pc-points.  equality for 
 everyone, dude!  that's what the game is gonna be for.

        actually, white men will give you more points than any other kind of 
 enemy.  killing some specific kind of people could even be harmful to you!  
 for instance, killing a black Muslim lesbian would make you lose 100 
 pc-points.  also featured, every time you'd kill someone, there's a ten 
 second break showing his/her family crying, so you can have a little 
 culpability crisis.  i mean, killing is a bad thing to do.

        everywhere in the game there will be bonuses, like: carrots, 
 broccoli, soda, etc.  beware of the meat!  if you eat meat, you will lose 
 points!  MEAT IS MURDER MOTHERFUCKER!  ahem, sorry.

        there's four ways you can win at operation pc:

        a)  you get 100,000 points.

        b)  you find the skin paint and you dye your skin.

        c)  you bomb the mc donald's company head quarters.

        d)  you use the "z" button to change your setup to "gay".

        fun for the whole family!  and the kids love it!
