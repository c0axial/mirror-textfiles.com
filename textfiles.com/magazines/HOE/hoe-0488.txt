        total silence, i am mute.  sometimes i fell -- like the trash door
 is open.  TRASH ROOM PLEASE KEEP DOOR CLOSED.  tonight, i'm typing in
 notepad because anything with kerning will drive me crazy and microsoft
 has yet to discover that word and every other program is so fucking ugly.
 last night, i went to a party with some close friends and i got a little
 imbibed.  and so the party went on and closeness with woo became the total
 goal.  i didn't even really want to, but the cute one was too much of a
 goal.  straightfoward game, let's play it.  and the person that i really
 wanted to get close to was too drunk to play.  i can't believe that life
 is so freaking up-down, drugs of sex entered the game.  tonight i was
 called a fucking hoar (not whore) and i could really be mad for the sake
 of just being really pissed off because i can't get what i want.

        so, i smoked a cigarette looking for a solution to the moodiness.
 i should run more.  but learning to snowboard is a better option i think.
 don't read this thinking that you'll find out what it is i want.  talking
 to you is like talking to a small child.  nothing is quite complete.
 nothing is quite complete.  perhaps a cup of tea.  mood mender or tension
 tamer.  how disquiet can function as a sense of time.  can you multiply
 by your 11's?  i don't think so.  i tested you out and you sucked at it.
 please go sit in the other corner and stop trying to read all that i'm
 trying to say.  the flowers in the corner smell like shit and all that
 film noir.  i wish i could just stop smelling so keenly.

        being with you again was empty.  empty. didn't really want to kiss
 you.  didn't really want to make your spine tingle.

        i couldn't really get a buzz.  i couldn't really feel your heart.
 i couldn't really want to have you.

        how disjointed and dicked over can you get?  i think i reached the
 limit and i think i have to burst.

        i haven't used the phone or smacked it lately.  

        ad hoc tryping.  

        design is intent.  control and communication.  lust and love of
 letter and form.

        boy george never sounded so good.  cry do you really want to.

        i'm going outside.
