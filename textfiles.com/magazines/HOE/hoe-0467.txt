        There are things that confuse us all.  There are things that boggle
 the mind.  There are things that leave us feeling down and empty.  Well,
 I'm going to address a common thought that enters our heads at one time.
 Self-worth.  Now, I know that we all think of ourselves as either
 terrific people or ass heads (like the ones that appear on Jerry Springer.
 Boy, do I hate that show, but that is another story).  This particular
 exercise, will deal with my twisted thought patterns.

        So, last night, I was in the big thriving Metropolis that is
 closest to me (consisting of 10,000 people roughly.  Thriving, huh!?!).
 I decided I'd try a cheap alternative to supper and eat at the local Taco
 Bell.  Sure their food is made with dogs and cats and shit, but what the
 hell, so long as I don't find a hoof or something like that in my chili
 cheese burrito.  So anyway, I'm eating a Taco Burrito Supreme.  Now, my
 mind tells me that the name is severely incorrect.  There is NO way that
 it has the right to be called a taco burrito supreme.  It is a damn
 burrito.  It's not a taco.  Personally, it's giving false hope to me and
 a hell of a lot of other people.  "Hey!  I'm gonna get the best of both
 worlds.  A taco AND a burrito!" But when you get it, all it is, is a damn
 burrito.  Supreme my ass! 

        I get ready to take a bite of this fake-as-hell product, when I
 notice something.  A little dabble of sour cream.  Now, I don't dislike
 sour cream, I certainly don't like it, whatever.  I take my bite.  To my
 dismay, I find a mouthful of sour cream awaited me.  Now what the hell is 
 that all about.  There is two and a half gallons of fucking sour cream on
 my taco... or.. um.. burrito.  SPREAD THE FUCKING WEALTH.  Of course,
 being the cynic that I am, I think of how this is typical for me.  I have
 a big mouthful of sour cream.  Now, if there were some one next to me,
 say, a girlfriend (dare I say the word), I could have ranted on about how
 I didn't want a mouthful of sour cream.  But do I have anyone next to me?
 HELL NO!!  So in the best interest of myself and, really everyone, I
 decided to come up with a theory on what brings misery.  Here goes.

        The main thing that I've found to bring misery and unhappiness in
 life is... the fucking taco burrito supreme.  Yes, I blame everything on
 that shitty burrito.  World hunger... taco burrito supreme.  Death and 
 destruction... taco burrito supreme, with extra sour cream!  Global
 warming... that fucking taco burrito-la-cucarachita-en-me-pene-doesn't-
 -deserve-to-be-called-a-damn-taco-supreme,

        WITH EXTRA SOUR CREAM.
