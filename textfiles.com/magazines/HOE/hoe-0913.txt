	Is there anyway that one person can master the art of bullshit?  
 We all know what it is, and we all have done it, many many times.  Think
 about it, you aren't quite sure what to write for a paper, what to say to
 someone, or how to do something.  So what do you do?  Bullshit.  It's the
 obvious and most appealing thing to do.  The best part is, if you are
 good at it, is when you you get away with it.  But getting caught, that
 just plain sucks shit.  Many people attempt bullshitting but few can
 master it.  Myself, I have been rather successful with the bull.  From
 6th grade to 10th grade was the training and trials.  There was much
 failure along with the glory of a successful bull.  For junior and senior
 year of high school, the bull seemed to flow effortlessly, as if aided
 with ex-lax.  From homework and quizzes to final projects and term
 papers, 90% of all work was bullshit.  Note: any non bullshit was in
 guitar class, cooking, and on a paper of my life, and possibly one math
 test where i actually knew what was goin on.  anyway.

	Discussing test taking methods with a friend, we compared styles
 of level of bullshit.  For my friend his tally board, called "the
 bullshit meter", is fairly simple, with certain complexities.  There is a
 scale of 0 to 100% in determining bullshit.  The more bullshit, thought,
 and importance of the item needing bullshit, the higher the the % value.  
 For example, a multiple choice quiz would receive a meek 1/4%, a short
 answer test gets 30%, long essay getting 50% and a term paper getting
 everything and them some.

	Now, mine on the other hand is a little different.  The degree of
 bullshit is determined again by 1) bullshit needed, 2) thought that would
 be required, 3) more important the event, and 4) time used to perform the
 art.  But basically it is like the scoring system of the British TV show
 "Who's line is it Anyway?".

	Whatever system you use, mine, my intellectually advanced friend,
 or your own, one thing will always remain the same.  BULL IS BULL and you
 can't bullshit a bullshiter.

	oh...i don't have any friends.
