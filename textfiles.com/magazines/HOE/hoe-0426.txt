        Well, kidz, what we have here today is a look at what once was
 THE SCENE in area code 401.  Now, I'm not talking about hacking, writing
 text files, creating art, pirating softwarez (ARRRR, MATEY), or anything
 cool/psuedo-productive like that.  I am talking about the chick scene...
 the HOT MODEM MOMMAS which were so often overlooked.

        My time in THE SCENE started in 1995.  This, of course, being
 after everything that was or could have been cool about BBS's and
 modems had already happened.  This time, lasting a few years before my
 arrival, will be forever referred to as THE GOOD OLE DAYS [tm].  

        So, anyways, it was me, CHICK X, CHICK Y, The Tyrant, SQUINKY,
 and a bunch of random Kurt Cobain-worshipping 14 year olds.  I
 worshipped SQUINKY in his amazing telecom techniquez (see: HOE #334).
 For all practical purposes, we can call Tyrant CHICK Z, because, well,
 for all practical purposes, he was.  We talked about nothing. And we
 talked about it a lot.  It was cliquey and bitchy and we liked it that
 way.

        Essentially, there were only two BBS's in my calling area that
 didn't suck.  Oh well. So it goes.  I am not going to go through the
 hassle of remembering any details about any of this, because
 submitting logs about Area 401 is Squinky's job.

        As with most close-knit, 15 year old trios of bitches, we all
 started to severely dislike eachother. CHICK Z left us for a life of
 passionate sex with a married woman and massive amounts of diaper
 changing (see: http://users.tmok.com/~minmei), CHICK X and CHICK Y went
 on to live in denial about their torrid lesbian love affair, and I
 moved on with my own self to read books, do drugs, geek out, and write
 boring text files for HOE.
	
        Isn't that a cute story?
