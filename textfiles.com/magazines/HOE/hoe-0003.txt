     The concept behind this bomb is quite simple, and it is also quite easy 
 to make.  So if you fuck up, your an idiot.

        First, just take a tennis ball, and cut a small hole in it.  The 
 hole only needs to be big enough for a funnel to poke into.  Next, Get a 
 funnel, and fill the tennis ball half full of gasoline.  You should know
 how to get gasoline.  Then, find some pieces of metal.  Chunks of steel or 
 chunks of a soup can work nicely.  You'll need to cut the soup can into 
 lots of little bits.  Pour a small handful of metal chunks into the tennis 
 ball.  Then, seal the hole in the tennis ball with epoxy (my 
 recommendation), or some kind of glue that is VERY strong.
        
        Now to use the bomb(Did ya' think I would leave you in the dark from
 this part?).  Find the idiot's house, sneak in, and find the microwave. 
 Take a lighter, and hold it under the ball (Note: it is important that you
 successfully sealed the ball with glue, or the gasoline will give you a 
 little surprise at this point), until the ball is no longer squishy (i.e. 
 until it feels like new, meaning there are a lot of compressed gasoline 
 vapors inside the ball.  
        Now quickly run to the microwave, and put the ball inside.  Set the 
 microwave on high, and set the timer for 5 minutes.  This is one TV dinner 
 that they won't forget.  Hit start, and run like fucking hell! (Hint: Know 
 which direction you are going to run AHEAD of time) About ten seconds after 
 you hit the start button, the ball explodes, and the microwave door goes 
 flying away.  There's a whole shit load of noise, and gasoline is spread 
 all around the room(Super-Mega-Evil-Grin), which can lead to more fun.
        A guy out in California burned his ex-wife's house down a few years
 ago with this.  Have fun.

        And remember kids...don't try this at home!!! 
                         
                                        Do it at a friend's house.

                                Sincerely your friend in mayhem,
                        
                                                Shotgun Willie
