 May 20th, 1999

 To Whom It May Concern:

        It is with a shameful sadness that I write this letter to you.
 Members of the HOE Community, I have openly wronged you.  Yea, even as I
 was doing it, I knew that I was committing a horrible error, but still I
 went through with it, hoping that perhaps it would be as bad as everyone
 told me.  Still, I did it, and now I must deal with the consequences of my
 actions.

        The purpose of this letter is to apologize to everyone else, who
 must also deal with the consequences of my actions.  It is an unfair
 imposition on both your emotional and intellectual cognitive functions,
 and for that I am sorry.  I never really meant to hurt any of you.

        Perhaps you wonder of which I speak.

        Of course, I can only be referring to the induction of Unrelated
 into HOE.  He is a full fledged member because of me.  I personally
 demanded that Mogel make him a member.  It is my fault that we shall
 forever be deluged with his witty commentaries on the American youth scene,
 particularly centered on East Chitlun Switch, Iowa.  It is my fault that we
 shall forever suffer under the hideous yoke of files that discuss Trends,
 Hipness, What It Means to Be Truly Cool (With Apologies to Henry Winkler),
 Marilyn Manson, Why Rap Sucks, Why Black People Need to Learn English,
 Why I'm Not Racist Even Though Black People Need to Learn English, Why
 Christianity is Stupid (With Apologies to Negativland), Why It's Fucked Up
 That People Keep Stealing My Backpack and Using It for a Toilet, Society is
 Pretty Stupid, People Are Stupid, People Are Jerks, Isn't it Fucked How
 People at The Mall Suck?, Trends, Hipness, What It Means to Be Truly Cool
 (With Apologies to Henry James), Twiggy Ramierez, Why Rap Blows, Why Black
 People Need to Get Jobs, Why I'm Not Racist Even Though I Oppose a Decadent
 and Wasteful Welfare System, Why EYEHATEGOD.TXT, Why It's Fucked Up That
 People Keep Mistaking My Face for a Toilet, People REALLY are Stupid,
 People REALLY are Jerks, and, of course, the perennial favorite, Isn't It
 Fucked How the Mall BLOWS?

        I feel a lot like Hindenburg when he heard that Hitler really won
 the elections.  The SA are at our door, the VisiGOTH hordes are outside of
 Rome, and Unrelated is running unchecked, and there's nothing we can do to
 stop him.

        At the very least, dear fellows, take this as a minor consolation
 prize.  I am humbled before you, humbled before my own idiocy, and humbled
 before God, (who, by the way, I hear sucks pretty bad.) I am,

                                                        Sincerely Yours,
                                                        Jarett Kobek
