	(get it, this is not by Anodyne!  but I really wrote it!!!)

	I am proud to continue my family tradition of frequent
 intoxication.  /It/ only becomes serious when your mind is attached; I
 see what that crazy old Buddha meant.  I mean, when you aren't listening
 it doesn't matter who's talking.  And it's the same way with sadness:
 when you don't listen it just isn't there.  Works out great.

	The problem is, some neo-Jesus punks and wrinkled winking old
 fellows seem to think that "when you ignore it, it doesn't go away."  
 What a ridiculous blanket statement, just what you'd expect from the
 all-or-nothing crowd!  Its good to ignore some things and bad to ignore
 others.  Just like everything else is this rotten stinking amazingly
 exotically beautiful life we call our own.  Only society's whores watch
 the evening news. You know what sadness is without dwelling on it every
 day at 6 PM.  See it, recognize it, learn to cope, then ignore.

	They march behind the banner of "Someday You'll See".  But my eyes
 are open today, you squishers of glee.  Detachment from material things
 (including other human beings) is the best way to avoid suffering.  Oh
 yeah, and joy.  But don't worry about that, you'll have a life of perfect
 contentment.  The afterlife?  You guessed it, perfect contentment too.

	Contentment? Nothing in heaven interests me.  Leave it to the
 miserable to construct a heaven of misery.  They could at least have put
 in some jazz and pool tables, but instead they opted for lutes and
 clouds.  Jesus Christ, whose idea was that, anyway?

	Too many people are of the opinion that nothing important happens
 until you die.  That's when all the excitement happens, so you might as
 well wait.  Just make sure you eat that cracker and Kool-Aid(tm) once in
 a while.  I like Kool-Aid(tm) as much as the next guy, but I at least
 have the ability to mix the powder myself.  In all seriousness, if I want
 to buy Indulgences the crack house is closer than the church AND it's
 open 24-7.

	This is all ridiculous banter, of course, and rather coarse
 besides. I only want everybody in the world to be happy all the time
 every day, because everything is something to be happy about.  Not only
 is Everything something to be happy about but each thing is something to
 be happy about.  The particulars of each thing may be something to be
 unhappy about, but each thing itself is something to be happy about.

	Something can be a physical entity or a mental entity.

		|-------------|
		|  Something  |\ 
                |-------------| \
                  /       |      |---\
                 /        |           \
                /         |            \
	|-----------| |-----------|     \
        | Property A| | Property B|    |-----------|
        |-----------| |-----------|    | Property C|
                                       |-----------|

	You can be happy about something even though
	any or all of properties A,B,and C, is not something
	to be happy about.  Something exists and it's there
	and it's contributing to your life on this planet! 
	It is precious and valuable no matter what it is!  Fools!11!!
	
	Ahem...as I was saying, happiness is definitely the way to go.  
 When you're feeling sad and blue, become un-unhappy.  And then become
 un-un-un-unhappy.

	And if you keep saying that word with more and more prefixes it's
 guaranteed to make you laugh!  So, get distracted and laugh big full
 belly laughs, and don't go to sleep just yet.
