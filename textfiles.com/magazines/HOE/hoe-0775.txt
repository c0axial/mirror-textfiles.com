 [09:11] <`six`> I have to tell you guys the conversation I had with my mom
                 this morning
 [09:11] <`six`> I borrowed some software from work, and made the mistake of
                 telling my mother.
 [09:12] <`six`> So... my mom like stages this confrontation this morning

 Mom:    'I know what your up to'
 
 Six:    'what mom' 

 Mom:    'YOURE A HACKER'

 Six:    'Uh If I was a hacker, or even capable of being one, I would not be
         a secretary'

 Mom:    'It's a cover admit it'

 Six     'Yes mom I am a mild manner secretary by day and a badass computer
         hacker by night.  I spend all night on caffeine binges writing
         cracks for all the latest Microsoft releases and then burning them
         to CDs and selling them on the black market at a half the price
         while still making 100% profit'
 
 Mom:    'I KNEW IT'
 
 Six:    'Mom, shut up I'm going to work now'
 
 [09:14] <`six`> I get to work
 [09:14] <`six`> phone rings it's mom
 
 Mom:    'I want you to stop hacking'
 
 Six:    'I would mom but I've become involved in an Asian software Mafia and
         there's no way out except death'
 
 Mom:    'Oh my gosh, honey we can get you help'
 
 Six:    'No mom there is no helping me now, it's too late, you and dad can
         take my hacking money stash and move to Hawaii, save your selves
         <fake dramatic voice> there's.. nothing.. left.. for.. me..
         anymore..
 
 Mom:    'Gosh!'
 
 Six:    'OH NO MOM THEY MUST HAVE THE PHONE TAPPED THEYRE COMING FOR ME OH
         MY GOD THE ASIANS HELLPPPPPPPP'
 
         <I hang up>
 
        Mom calls back 5 minutes later, most likely after relaying our
 conversation to my dad.
 
 Mom:    'you little smart ass when you get home I want you to clean your
         room'
 
	<Mom hangs up>
