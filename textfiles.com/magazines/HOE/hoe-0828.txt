        DANIML was the licence plate.

	Yes, I think we all know who this story is about, yes a man who's
 life is nothing. Danimal, the Animal. (ref. http://users.ids.net/~danimal).
 A man who resorted to stupid little jokes and screming out loud kid
 riddles and "fuck!!! FUCK!! SHE FUCKED! UP SHITY!!!" when his paycheck
 got fucked up because he forgot to clock out.  He also fucked his cousin,
 anyway possible.  That's right, Dan was a animal, a DANIMAL.  

	I remember the day, I was leaving work and he ran out the door and
 wanted to shake my hand.  Not once, but twice becasue he was leaving the
 state tonite, becasue of the restraining order he got on his lunch break.  
 That is right, his wife left in the middle of the night and left no note,
 was gone for a week and then sent him a restraining order.  Yeah.  He told
 me that day about how his wife's mother killed his pet rat and about how
 his wife tried to tell the cops how he beat his kid, when he ran into a
 wall.  Well, back onto the story, he wanted to shake my hand and say
 goodbye.  A week later he came into work to get hisk check, he was
 supposed to be in Denver and said "HEY! I LIVE NEAR YOU NOW!!" and left.
 I freaked. 

        Now Danimal is living with another woman and is never off line.
 he keeps updating the all mighty "DANIMAL KINGDOM" and is soon to setup
 the Danimal Designs homepage.  (www.danimaldesigns.com).  Dan is now
 moving onto 'greener pastures'.  

        I remember Dan for a few reasons, he would yell at me and flip me
 off constantaly becasue I wasn't making instruction booklets for the
 CDROM's or Disk Sets.  He would also write on the 'supplies needed' list:

	Blow up doll for chris.
	Platform Shoes for Chris.
	etc.

        That was cool! hrmm. wait a minute, it wasn't.  He would also make
 alot of stupid jokes and riddles and if you make fun of him, he would get
 mad.

	In conclusion: I am fucking glad that guy got pissed on.  Jeezus.
 He really fucking pissed me off with all his stupid shit.  He would never
 listen when you would say somthing and be mad if you didn't listen to him.
 He would also spend all of his time on his webpage and get mad if you
 didn't goto it or fucked around it.  Damn, Burn in hell Danimal.  

        Look for part 2 of Cousin Fuckers soon.
