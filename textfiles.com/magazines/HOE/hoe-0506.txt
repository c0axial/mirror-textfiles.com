        As I sit in the Service Center of a non-distinguished Gateway
 Country Store, I watch my managers run around directing people to tuck
 their evil uniform shirts in and to smile when a customer enters the
 store.

        I have come close to falling asleep at my post a plethora of times,
 only to be waken by the occasional musical stylings of Barbara Streisand
 blasting from the stereo speakers of an entirely too powerful machine as 
 an entirely too commission based salesperson attempts to make the machine
 seem user-friendly to an entirely too ignorant elderly man.

        I stare out the window, watching the potential customers come and
 go when the phone rings.

        "Thank you for calling Gateway Country, how may i help you?" I
 mumble into the receiver.

        "HI!  I have a hypothetical question for you", says the man on the
 other end, excitedly.

        "Oh?  How hypothetical is hypothetical?" I ask.

        Ignoring my comment, the man proceeds to ask me a myriad of
 questions regarding the installation of a chip he has HEARD about which,
 when sodered onto the board of a Recordable CD_rom allows the copying of
 Sony Playstation Games.  It seems a FRIEND of his has attempted to
 "upgrade" her CD-R in this fashion, but was unfamiliar with the fine art
 of sodering, and managed to make the CDR inoperable (as in the damn thing
 won't even open anymore cos of the lump of metal lodged in the tray).

        "Now", he continues, "If my my friend were to say, own a Gateway,
 and it was the CDR on the Gateway that is no longer functioning, would you
 all replace the CDR for her?"

        Then he rambles in coherently, "Cos I really think that you should
 replace the CDR, cos you have a warranty and are always saying you replace
 things.  I am entitled to a replacement CDR."

        THE END.

        DO NOT EVER WORK IN A CUSTOMER SERVICE BASED FIELD BECAUSE YOU
 ALWAYS END UP HATING MANKIND.
