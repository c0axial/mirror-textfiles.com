----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mogel: INTERVIEW ME ALL NIGHT LONG.  ASK THOSE QUESTIONS HARD AND FAST!

Jamesy: So, Mog, with all these Sticky Richie Rich comics lying around,
        what are you now going to do to get off?

Mogel: Well, Jamesy, one can never had enough Richie... if you know what I
       mean, heh heh!

Jamesy: If you were a vegetable, which vegetable would you be?

Mogel: Well, Lamesy, I think it would be a turnip.  Turnips are so pretty. 
       So fresh.  So rad!  The breath the essense of WaReZ.  I know that's
       hard to get from a veggie - but I do it!

Jamesy: Speaking of Warez, what did you think of THG's new release of
        PKZIP for OS/2 v2.04x?

Mogel: Well Jamesy, I think that the release had many blatant bugs in it.  I
       think that it would have been better if they just stole PWA's copy and
       called it thiers.  That's what I'd do if I was a warez d00d.  But
       there is that 'anti-0-day' problem.

Jamesy: How many times have you slit your wrists? And how many of those
        times were you listening to Depeche Mode?

Mogel: Fortuanly, every time I have slit my wrists, it has been successful
       and I had died.  Imagaine if I hadn't died.  That'd be scary stuff.
       I'd have Depesh Mode playing 24-hours-day in my room.  Hahaha!
       Woo!

Jamesy: If you were a minimized window, what would your icon be?

Mogel: I would probably be a large breast.  Just one.  Not two.  I'm going
       to marry a woman with just one breasts.  Just ONE large.

Jamesy: What is the first thing that comes to your mind when I say the
        quote, "To stay or to go, it amounted to the same."

Mogel: Actually, I don't ever read things in quotes.  Sorry.

Jamesy: Looking back at the bombing in oklahoma, would you rather eat the
        dead children's bodies with A1 Steak sause or KC Masterpiece BBQ?

Mogel: I'd have to go with the A1.

Jamesy: If you had to stick any element from the periodic table up your
        ass, what would be your choice? NOTE: it must be in solid form.

Mogel: Without a doubt it would be Uranium.  There's nothin' like a little
       cancer to spice up your day.  Amen.

Jamesy: When you were a little boy, who touched you more, mommy or daddy?

Mogel: Mommie loved me.  I'm not supposed to talk about that though.

Jamesy: Would you rather be a cheez curl or a cheez puff?

Mogel: I think curls.  They're more... curly.

Jamesy: looking at the zine world today, and looking at all the shitty groups
        out there <like that group gasp and stuff>, what would you say would
        be the best way to genocide all stupid people?

Mogel: Have them listen to Blur's first album.

Jamesy: Why did you pick the name "Hogs of Entropy" anyway?

Mogel: Lots of goofy reasons.  I wanted somethien sorta anti-profound...
       but would at least make someone go "hmm!" -- something like that.
       the name 'HOE' was funny.  Pigs are cute.  I'm obsessed with the
       concept of Entropy.

Jamesy: But my point is why 'OF'? why not "oblivious" or "obsession" or
        something? "of" is just so .. so.. grammarically correct.

Mogel: Because I'm a stupid moron.
