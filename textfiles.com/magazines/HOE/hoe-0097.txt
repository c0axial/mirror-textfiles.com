--------- --- -- -

     Once there was a stupid, overgrown adolescent.  Stupid, because he
let his emotions guide all of his actions.  He should have learned his lesson 
when someone he cared for very dearly suddenly turned her back on him.  But no,
he was stupid, and not six months later, he tried again.  This time would be 
different.  
     He would do nothing to scare this second person off, for she was 
too special.  He cared about her even more than the first one, if that were 
possible.  He found the energy of the relationship so fulfilling that it made 
up for the complete and utter lack of sex in his life.  This was all he needed.
To be close to someone he loved.  This was all he wanted.  But she let people
convince her otherwise.  "He will rape you if you keep on letting him ha
ng around," they told her.  And she believed it.  
     So one day, completely out of nowhere, she decided she would have no 
further contact with this person who had shared so much of her life for the 
past six months.  Seeing how misunderstood he had been, our hero lost all will 
to live.  "At least I have my work," he said.  But then, he realized, he 
didn't even have that.  Because everytime he sat down to do work, all he could 
think of was how much this girl had hurt him, and he'd start to cry.  So
he failed all of his classes.  But he never had to drop out of school, because 
he lost all will to live way before that.  
     For some inexplicable reason he started vomiting uncontrollably.  And   
realizing that only one person remained who gave a shit about him, in the 
midst of his vomiting he would write silly stories in an attempt to get this 
friend's attention.  But actually, the "friend" didn't give a damn about 
whether he lived or died, or was happy or sad.  Eventually he died of 
starvation because he couldn't keep any food in his stomach.
