	THIS IS A QUOTE FROM Howard Phillips Lovecraft I LIKE HIM A LOT.

	The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of
 the human mind to correlate all of it's contents.  We live on a placid
 island of ignorance in the midst of the black seas of infinity, and it
 was not meant for that we should voyage far.  The sciences, each
 straining in their own directions, have hitherto harms us little; but
 someday the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such
 vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall
 either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the
 peace and safety of a new dark age.
