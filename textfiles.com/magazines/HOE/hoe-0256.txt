        This is my little attempt to return to BBS greatness.  My wonder
years, when annoying everyone on a lame BBS actually meant something.  I
could post literally up to a thousand unique replies.  Still... there will
always be the memories.

Warez all the women?  Hehehehe!  Better hide em!  hahahhahha.  Communists 
suck... my dick! hbbhwhashgh2gt1~!@$#  I am the walrus vs. the penguin... or 
am I?!  Anyway, there are no 11 spices in kentucky fried chicken, just salt
pepper MSG and something like sodium dulamate.  Lazy fucks.  And they charge
a huge amount. Butt fuck them nigs up the anus!

Haven't you heard?  The BBS is dead.  Get a life you lamer. 

lick my nads....http://punk.w1.net

Then why the FUCK are you posting on one?  BOO YAH BITCHES, SUCK IT DOWN!

lick my nads....http://punk.w1.net

Anyway, I got a box of tampons, which made me feel "uncofortable" (am I 
allowed to say that)?  Then, I put hot tobasco on it and stuck it up my anus.
Then I lay under the shower for 3 hours, writhing in agony.  A couple hours 
later, I did it again

Hm, well tobasco certainly does do the trick.  I usually prefer dave's
insanity or coffin, with my secret blend of 11 herbs and spices that stand
on every spice rack.

lick my nads....http://punk.w1.net

As I mentioned before, there are no 11 herbs and spices!  GET A LIFE YOU
LAMER AND STOP POSTING ON THIS BBS!!

lick my nads....http://punk.w1.net

Lame? I know you are but what am I?!

lick my nads....http://punk.w1.net

Um.. a crank! heehee..

Crank: But I'M THE ONLY CRANK, a joke about someone mama is general.

How presumptuous of her!  Well, now she can no longer say that, you have 
joined the list.  And that jamesy fellow, he's a jamesy.  He's so... jamesy.
