        It is tough to be a masochist and a smoker -- one cannot decide
 whether to smoke another cigarette and damage his body more, or quit to
 suffer the pains of withdrawal.

        Creating a product means you must prove its value to consumers and
 then insure distribution so those consumers can get the product.

        How many miles does your car have?  How many of those were useful?
 How many were spent driving down beautiful wooded lanes?

        Well that's beautiful for _you_!

        If life is one great mystery, there must be _someone_ who will solve
 it.  Think about certain questions regarding anything and certain rational
 answers will surface -- think about those answers, combine them, and there
 will be more questions.  Eventually these questions will be answered, and
 so on...

        Italic means italian, italian means European.

        So if there's a black hole at the center of the galaxy, are we
 getting pulled closer and closer?  Is it like our planet is being
 flushed down the galactic toilet?  How soon until we go down the drain?

        There is some sort of inherent charm in finding use for something
 that is old.  Doing tomorrow's homework in a 25 year old notebook.  Doing
 this homework with your grandpa's old pen.

        I like my old coat.

        Find it necessary to show ultimate disgust.

        One form of proof that you are a computer nerd:  if you are reading
 a book and see a hyphen -- a connected double-dash -- and think "double
 alt-136".

        So everything as we know it is a world.  The world is a world, each
 person is a world, a cup of juice is a world, a software program is a
 world.  All are interchangeable.  Perhaps my world is a cup of juice, while
 yours is a software program.  And in your world, you are in a for-loop.
 Everything keeps repeating until a certain variable reaches a certain
 value.  Then you will exit the for-loop.  But where will you go from there?
 That could be the end of your program.  Or your for-loop could be followed
 with another for-loop, in which you will be stuck for a predefined or
 dynamic amount of time.

        And my cup of juice is a software program.  It has a few sparse
 statements encapsulated in its ceramic shell.  Its for-loop states that

        FOR Juice = Full TO Empty STEP -1

        in BASIC.  So it is stuck in this loop until its juice is all gone.
 Then it exits the loop, at which time the cup would be refilled, therefore
 entering another for-loop, or it will be put away, its execution complete.

        And a world, therefore could be completely expressed in a
 meticulously detailed software program.  A fairly basic moment in a calm
 day may involve breathing, blinking, sitting, watching TV.  Take into
 account all the stumuli in this world-view.  Code them into the program,
 and viola, two worlds collide.
