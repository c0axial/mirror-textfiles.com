        "Tired of those Donna Reed marathons that leave you hanging at the
  end of an episode for way too long?  Tired of the neighboors being loud
  and having all the fun while you just take it?  Tired of all the nightly
  child molesters tapping your window?  Tired of the materbation at the 
  mere site of the 80-year-old woman next door?  Well worry no more!!  The
  Hogs of Entropy have arrived to this dimention via ranch dressing and 
  we're hear to put a spark in your smile!  And a hop in your pancreas."

           This song begins with a slurred Tony Bennet/Barry Manilow
           thing, and moves into a Jim Morrison Poem...then it moves
           into some Pearl Jam Wailing...And the last, "scream" part
           is a "DUN-DUN-DUN-DUN" chant like thing.
