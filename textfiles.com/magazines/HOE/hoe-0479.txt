        It seems strange to see such foolish comments about President
 Clinton being voiced by supposedly intelligent people.

        Last week, an MSU professor made Clinton out to be a true soldier
 of freedom, amongst other foolish remarks.  This supposed champion of the
 people is nothing of the sort.  He supported the Communications Decency
 Act, a recently overturned bill which banned freedom of speech on the
 Internet.  His crime bill practically raped the second amendment.  If I
 had the time and space I could probably go all the way down through the
 bill of rights.  Clinton has even referred to the Constitution as an
 outdated piece of paper.

        I doubt anyone out there can name one freedom Clinton actually
 gave us.

        Almost as laughable is this foolish idea that impeachment violates
 the Constitution.  Apparently, Clinton and his followers have never even
 read the document.  Congress has the right to impeach anyone for anything.
 It is all part of the constitutional system of checks and balances.

        I do agree that the charges against Clinton are petty, and so
 typically republican.  However, this is the only thing they can nail him
 on.  He has sold nuclear missile technology to China, sexually harassed
 countless women, whitewater, etc.  Over sixty people with dirt on him
 have "committed suicide".  To top it all off, he murders scores of
 innocent people in Iraq, Sudan, and Afghanistan in a pathetic attempt to
 distract attention from Monica Lewinsky's stained dress.  Clinton makes
 that evil bastard Nixon look clean.  Bill Clinton is like Al Capone.
 Everyone knew Capone was a gangster, and everyone knows Clinton is dirty.
 And, like Capone, if they have to nail him on some bullshit charge, I'm
 all for it.

        Yet, despite the fact that President Clinton is a fascist, a
 mass-murderer, a liar, a hypocrite, a traitor and an embarrassment, I do
 not believe he deserves to be impeached.  He deserves the chair.  That
 would send a message to all the corrupt politicians ready to take his
 place.
