	tired of all my lies being made public, he said, and I could only
 nod in response. Had only someone told Mister Jarett Kobek that the
 world was not prepared for those without a non-discloser policy, perhaps
 the crucifixion would have happened later than sooner. There were 18
 before Christ and 1 after, and the last was the last, and his name was
 Kobek and the Pharisees and the Saducees did fear him as they feared God.
 For they knew he was not of God, but something bigger.

 st. sophia, ah st. sophia, he didn't mean that you gave out a thousand
 little disbursements of the bawdy details of your life, no, that could
 never be considered honesty, but rather a form of decadent self-deception;
 no, the honesty he brought was that in your face ruthless persecution of
 your human flaws. YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE IN LOVE but he told you it would
 be over by next summer; and was he ever right? 1 + 3 = 4 times a lady. 
 What all the whores propound to have, but none really do.  It's alright
 to push it so far push it so far up and in but the cervix is the end; but

 Okay, so here's the thing, my life fucking sucks. plain and simple. And
 I'm not just bitching. It really does suck. 

	THE HI-BIT HO-DOWN

	8 yrs old - raped. 

	12 yrs old - raped again! c'est la vie!

	14 yrs old - first true to life sexual experience 

        14-present age (201) - living with the stereotypical female nympho
					
 okay, got that out! Now, understand, even with this bullshit that
 happened in the BEG-inning of my life, I'm not upset at that (?) or the
 fact that it happened or my inability to properly use pronouns. I may-BE
 a bit sad at times that my innocents, all those wonderful jewish
 innocents, wasn't mine to give, but now as I see it I'm a lot stronger
 and less literate.

 After my first experience when I was 14, I started craving sex. not like
 you crave a candy bar or a mainline shot of dope, but a craving like i
 had never felt before. like it controlled my life. drove me to insanity a
 time or two... seriously i thought my mom was gonna put me in the ol'
 sanitarium once. but anyways, as I said it drove me. and before i knew
 it, i was classified as a "SLUT" or "WHORE." and it just made laugh. Like
 Mike Muir. well not in the beg-inning. i cried until it hurt to cry, then
 i lost my ability to feel pain. people are mean. thats all there is to
 it, you get pas that, and you get past just bout anything. EXCEPT YOUR
 FUCKING RAPES, YOU STUPID JACKASS.

 well i have had a lot of partners, and i guess now, if i looked back i
 was a slut. but i was always protected, even when i conceived my son.
 whom now is 3 yrs old. Yes, this curse will perpetuate indefinitely and
 it will cost AIDS 50% of his salary in my welfare checks. Also defense
 budget. i was 16 a the time of his birth. and it was hell. but again, i
 am off the subject i'm trying to get out here.

 i don't get where people get off being so high and mighty. classifying
 everyone and everything that they aren't like they were darwin. if
 fucking pisses me off. god, if they only knew what it was like to be in
 my shoes once. when i was lil' and ignorant of what was happening to me. 

 i think that that was what really has the biggest impact on my life, i
 mean, i didn't care about sex as an intimate thing between two people who
 cared about each other, it was a drug. something i just had to get. i was
 a 15 year old boy. 

 why should any have to deal with this pain? how can i laugh tomorrow when
 i can't even smile today? why should people be able to get away with this
 torture? now you know my life story. well my life sucks. plain and
 simple. and if you don't agree, eat me. i want it bad. i live in this
 hell, the hell others created for me. I call this hell "earth".

 not like you crave a candy bar or a cigarette, but a craving like i had

     If I say I don't need anyone
     I can say these things to you
     'cause
     I can turn on anyone
     Just like I've turned on you
     I've got a tongue like a razor
     A sweet switchblade knife
     And I can do you favors
     But then you'll do whatever I like

	 well i have had a lot of partners, and i guess now, if i looked

     Here I am

  i don't get where people get off being so high and mighty.

 when i was lil' and ignorant of what was happening to me.

     Here I am
     And you're a Rocket Queen oh yeah
     I might be too much
     But honey you're a bit obscene

	i think that that was what really has the biggest impact on my
 life, i mean, i didn't care about sex as an intimate thing between two
 people who cared about each other, it was a drug. something i just had to
 get.

        i always want to be different, try to be at all times. and so when
 people criticize me now, i laugh. its funny to me to be called a slut. i
 mean, my normal remark is, "yer just jealous cause your not getting as
 much as i am.

     I've seen everything imaginable
     Pass before these eyes
     I've had everything that's tangible
     Honey you'd be surprised
     I'm a sexual innuendo
     In this burned out paradise
     If you turn me on to anything
     You better turn me on tonight


 and then sometimes, i still go home lock myself in my room and cry.

     I see you standin'
     Standin' on your own
     It's such a lonely place for you
     For you to be
     If you need a shoulder
     Or if you need a friend
     I'll be here standing
     Until the bitter end

       why should anyone have to deal with this pain? why should people
 be able to get away with this torture? now you know my life story. well
 my life sucks.  plain and simple. if you don't agree, eat me. i live in

     Bugs' mistake was meeting the Brown Detective Agency alone.

     Sally held Bugs down and sodomized him with a power drill.  By the
 time she had worked her way up to the three-eighths-inch bit, Bugs was in
 a talkative mood.  Encyclopedia Brown elicited the appropriate confession
 and obtained a full refund for the other kids.  Sometimes, not having a
 shred of evidence is no obstacle for a real sleuth.

 Encyclopedia Brown does it again!

 Hello Wicker men and women

 I joined this community thing last night and sent a message but it didn't
 seem to be posted. So I have sent it again.

 There was a copy of a 101 min cut video of TWM available at Amazon
 yesterday for $49 which is circa M-#27.

 I heard about the WM originally from a Cockney friend who did 
 impersonations of Edward Woodward's Scottish accent A few months later I
 saw the documentary and then Channel 4 showed the film.

 At the time I was in my final year of a Politics degree at Glasgow
 University and was reading Nietzsche and studying fascism, the film
 fitted right into those theories of religion and also I found parallels
 between Lord Summerisle and the charismatic leaders of cults etc. it was
 these theories that the likes of Hitler based their style of leadership
 etc. I won't bore you with all this crap, but TWM has to be the most
 thought provoking and intelligently scripted film I have ever seen. They
 should be showing it in schools!

 I wish I had known about that showing in Falkirk earlier as I would have
 gone.

 Public Health Warning:
 I am now about to ask the VIDEO QUESTION.
 I have only seen the bastardized butchered cut, and would understandably
 like to see the full version which acc. to a website offers much more
 character and story... 
 The information I have got so far is out of date. I know it's boring and
 you all probably know the answer, but could someone clear it up for me...
 has the full 104 version been released as a video in the UK over the last
 18 months?

 I remember seeing posters for Tower records advertising a release of TWM
 on hoardings in the Glasgow Subway, the vid cover was light blue and had
 a pic of the blazing wicker man and Britt Ekland's face horizontally
 across the bottom. I have been knocking my pan out going round shops
 looking for a copy all I can find is the Terror something release in a
 dark cover. I'd imagine one of you might have the edition I'm talking
 about, if so could you please put me out of my misery and tell me which
 version it is.

 Subject: re: vids 

 Forgive me for not replying directly, but I am not reading this from home.

 OK, the situation with the video is that there has been no re-release in
 the UK. The cover that you mention sounds like the most recent US home
 video release. The only copy that has ever been available on video over
 here is the butchered 87 m print.

 The only times that the 102m print has ever been seen is in the two mid
 1980s home video releases in the USA, on the Magnum and Media labels.
 These are both n ow deleted, but the Magnum release regularly turns up on
 Ebay - http://www.ebay .com

 The 102m print is being very elusive, and it appears (correct me if I'm
 wrong Allan) that there has only been one copy of this long print in
 existence since its release. IRC it was found in one of the proposed
 American distributors' offi ce - Roger Corman? I'm not entirely sure.
 Regardless, this print isn't actually very good (all horrible and
 yellow), but worse than that the Master Tape appears to have gone
 walkabouts. This means that the only existing copies may well be the VHS
 ones. Which would be very sad.

 Luckily, prints of the 95m version *do* exist on videotape, and this is
 the versi on that was shown on Moviedrome and Sky Movies Gold. The print
 shown on Channel Four is the 87m one. It's worth noting for those who
 haven't bothered to record this though that it is an exceptional good
 print.

 AFAIK, no plans for a re-release in either the cinemas or on video (the
 87m video is now technically deleted either side of the pacific, BTW)

 Like I said, correct me if I'm wrong, Allan.

 Hi.

 I got a 102 minute version from Luminus video which claims to be a Warner
 Home video (UK) version and has a Warner sleeve with 102 Minutes as the
 length.  It is the full 102 version (I had a dup of the limited US
 release and compared)..  The "warner original" is obviously a very good
 quality duplicate, I think anyway. That may be your best way to get it.
 It came like any other original, full box and colour sleeve, this has The
 Wicker Man and Edward Woodward's face on the sleeve. Lumin us still sell
 it I think.

 No.  Not to my knowledge.

	An angry debate has erupted in France over the increasingly
 negative reviews being delivered to French films by local critics. As
 reported by a Paris-based correspondent for the London Sunday Times, the
 debate reached its peak last week when director Patrice Leconte proposed
 that negative reviews be banned until audiences have a chance to make up
 their own minds about new releases. In addition, a manifesto published by
 a group of French film devotees declared that French critics were
 experiencing a "crisis of intelligence and competence" and concluded: "We
 have everything to lose if the critics treat us this way, and the
 Americans have everything to gain." Critics shot back that if the
 filmmakers (who are largely state supported) made watchable films, they
 would not be attracting negative reviews. The debate occurred during a
 week when Disney's Tarzan set a record for the biggest opening-day take
 in French history. Commented the Sunday Times correspondent: "Given the
 choice of a Disney movie and a homegrown selection of dreary meditations
 on unhappy families and bad sex, French film-goers voted with their
 eyeballs."

	memoirs of a geisha: or, the pursuit of gravity in literature
			is the writer's ability to maturely relate to
			the topics of SEX and DEATH 

 Since I've blown number 1, let's how I can do with 2, eh? 

	shit, well, damn, no one's really died too tragically on me,
 except my aunt, but you know, that's deeply HIDDEN IN THE UNDERCURRENT OF
 REALITY WHICH ONLY MY HISTRIONIC EMOTIONAL STATE CAN TAP INTO... but uh,
 maybe I can pretend that I'm torn up inside over the suicide of this kid
 Butthead. He was a modem guy and he knew teletype and now he's dead. He's
 DEAD! It feels like a chunk of my heart is missing! A piece of my soul
 evanesced into another world... How can I go on without you, Mark?
 Without your butthead looking face and sounding voice? Without watching
 you fuck retards on acid in the back of a cripple's van? Without her
 telling me I'm a werewolf? It's a perfect day to kill yourself! God why?
 I heard my sister's cry from the other room, why'd you have to pussy out?
 Life could have gotten better! I would have helped you make it better but
 you had to die! Oh and now it sucks for me, but I'm not going to be a
 coward like you were, I'm not going to pussy out of life; I'm going to
 stick it out. I'm going to brave it. I'm going to kick the world in the
 ass just to show you up. You miserable bastard, why'd you have to leave
 me alone? You're dead and gone and gone and dead, and I'm here by myself
 wondering how I go on without you. Listen to the wind blow, I'm sad sad
 without you and I miss the sounds of your 808 on the stereo. It doesn't
 matter that I met you probably 4 times in my life, no, because I KNEW YOU
 and you KNEW ME as soon as we met. Our minds in a perfect syncopation of
 thought and being; you knew as well as I did that I would prostitute the
 finer moments of my life for the sake of a joke or for a vainglorious
 attempt at art, you knew all my secrets, and I knew all of yours! You
 were the best friend I didn't need to speak to, because we were so close
 that all of our thoughts and deeds were like the respective other's. OH
 GOD, MARK "BUTT HEAD" SCHULZ, you jewish fellow, how ever am I to go on
 without you? My cat's meowing it and reminds me of you. The city is
 bleeding and it reminds me of you. The night is full of scents and it
 reminds me of you. Everything is you and everything was you, and you are
 dead and life is empty. LIFE IS EMPTY. It shall be hard for me to kick
 against the pricks. I'm trapped here, but I'm not going to give you the
 pleasure, hell no, I'm not going to let you see me QUIT like you did. I'm
 not a coward like you, MARK "BUTT HEAD" SCHULZ, no, I'm a real person.
 I'm not a hero and I'm not a brave person, but I can't do what you did.

 END OF EULOGY FOR BUTT HEAD

	Well, how was that? Did I make the grade? Ain't I a woman? AM I
 REALLY REAL? Is my literary attempt 1/2 of the way towards writing
 maturity? Got lucky, got lucky in time; will you beat me with a whip?
 yeah yeah sexual pleasure hahahahahah SEX!!!!!! from the pain others
 inflict sexual pleasure from inflicting pain; you're either one or the
 other but never both. Never both. I need to see you bleed before I can
 get off. It's the blood that makes life. FOR THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE. It's
 a perfect day to beat your lover. the things i could tell you about her
 blood red ass.

	ain't it shame to have leadbelly stab his manager on a sunday?
 Ain't it a shame to beat your wife on a sunday? When you got MONDAY,
 TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY AND Sat-ur-hamlet written by THOMAS
 KYD who wrote the spanish tragedy, a play I've seen TWICE in less than a
 week. Isn't that crazy? I wish I lived in England, cuz I'd just go see
 the summer season of the RSC every summer. and fuck, it would rock.

	The Ur-Hamlet was entitled _HAMLET, REVENGE!_ 

		this is historical fact 

			The Ur-Jarett was called "JAROD". 

				This is personal fact

	Jarod is a pretender, a very intelligent person with the ability
 to slide into somebody else's personality. For that purpose, he has been
 taken from his family as a child in order to work for a secret agency
 called The Centre. But recently, he escaped. Jarod's new mission in life
 is to help people in need with his gift, and to find out what really
 happened to his allegedly dead parents.  Only, Miss Parker and her team
 are out to get him...

			  OUT TO GET HIM PREGNANT

	Jarod, a boy genius with a special gift for pretending, was
 kidnaped and held prisoner by a corporation that used him as a human
 simulator in their clandestine research. Escaping from The Centre more
 than 30 years later, Jarod now searches for clues to his true identity
 and family. He also uses his ability to quickly become an expert at
 anything to right wrongs and exact revenge on the wicked. All the while,
 Centre operatives led by Miss Parker work relentlessly to capture Jarod,
 and return him to The Centre.

 "But Sam," I, so called Jarett, said, "why would I want to inflict pain
 on her? I'm don't want to hurt her. I love her."

 "You're a sadist, Jarett."

 "I've always considered my self a secular humanist."

 "A prime example of your sadism."

	the ol marky-mark de sade himself was a corpulent piece of shit
 who didn't really practice what he preached, but thankfully popular myth
 and urban legend has transformed him into a startling sexual deviant,
 longing for the pines, giving us the hand jobs we always wanted; AAND OH
 HE WANTED THE PAIN but the pain was hidden in the river encased in a
 golden ring and the Hobbit thing fished it out, and we know what its gots
 in its pockets, don't we my precious?

	STRIKE DOWN THE RIDERS OF ROHAN AND BURN THE BRIDGES OF MORIA FOR
 IT IS I, GANDALF THE WHITE, RISEN FROM THE DEAD LIKE A CHRIST ON THE
 THIRD DAY. LIKE CHRIST HIMSELF, I AM CHANGED; NO LONGER ARE MY ROBES
 GREY. I AM THE PENULTIMATE POWER. THERE IS BUT one HIGHER THAN I. THAT
 FLESH MAN THEY CALLED KOBEK. HIDDEN IN THE ENCYSTED LIFE OF HIS OWN SELF
 ONE RING TO BIND HI MATT A.K.A. STYXXXXX, I THOUGHT I'D PUT A SHOUT OUT
 RIGHT HERE, A SHOUT OUT ABOUT dragonlance. Fucking Raistlin Darfler,
 always changing her robes and going EVIL. yeah. Getting upset when I
 storm the closet and make her have CHAOTIC EVIL sex. It used to be
 NEUTRAL CHAOTIC, but now, hell, now it's CHAOTIC EVIL.

	IS THIS DESIRE OR AM I JUST LOST IN THE HEART? It's a clogged
 heart full of death and despair... the egyptian children are here... They
 steal a camera from an american tourist... I look at him with a mixture
 of pity and loathing; I don't wish such a thing to fall on him, but then
 I think it's his own fault for being so careless. I see his face and it
 is a smear of hurt and pain, and I understand he is feeling, and my
 loathing fades away, now I only have pity. I offer him my camera but he
 rejects it. He tells me the camera was a present from his mother. I know
 immediately he secretly was in love with her. Nothing I do can heal this
 wound. He is as sedentary as the Chinese, the Chinois, who said to me, as
 I walked along the Cliffs of Moher, "It's so beautiful." I almost died
 that day. The Chinois would have been the last to see me alive. I saved
 myself at the last moment. Extending my hands behind me and catching my
 body as it went over the rocks. I was dead but then I was not.

	We came here for you once, when you died. But this wasn't here and
 that wasn't you.

                          word up to the manthing.

	Well, golly gosh geee, Sarge, it sure has been a long time since I
 done wrote something 'bout yonder TELETYPE. "Ah, so it has." Should I
 drop and give you twenty? "How about you just give me some of that ol'
 black magic?" You want I should write me another teletype story? "Please
 do, I long for it. I long for it so. I need it like a junkie needs junk."
 That bad, huh, sarge? "Yes, private, yes." Well, guess I can't deny my
 C.O. anything. "NOT UNDER THE MILITARY CODE OF CONDUCT." Aren't there any
 exceptions?

	"No."

                TELETYPE, REINCARNATE! Rise from your grave! 

	But I can not bring back an exhausted idea. All of his life force
 is gone. Let me put the carcass in the orgone accumulator and see what
 will come of it. In you go, into the oven, into the accumulator, there
 fatty, there... Do not cry... soon you will be ALIVE!

	Speaking of calling people from behind the grave, let me see how
 the orgones are accumulating around the corpse of teletype. shall he be
 re-animated? Shall I play herbert west? I shall! I look into the
 accumulator, I see the signs of life stirring, but still, teletype is not
 alive... The concept has been beaten and beaten and beaten over and over
 again like Stephanie Seymor... It will require more time in the orgone
 accumulator... Soon, soon he will rise from his grave...

	Extract from Mina Harker's Journal

	June 9th. I still have no word from my dear Jonathan. I hope that
 he is fairing well in Transylvania, and will write soon. Sweet Lucy has
 not yet given up her sleep walking. Only last night I had to prevent her
 from perambulating to our favorite sitting spot. I looked at her face and
 I saw that she was totally in sleep. The poor thing was completely
 unaware of what she was doing! I locked the doors and windows to our room
 and put her back in bed. I dare not tell her mother, for fear it will
 worsen the woman. She already has confessed to me that her time in this
 world is brief, and I would not be the one whose tongue sent her
 spiraling into God's arms, blessed though they be. Nothing new to report
 otherwise. I do hope Jonathan will write soon!

 <important> drew's logic was that once you started dating, you just kind
             of kissed a lot and talked about kissing, or something
 <soybean> i wrote t-files while i was with drew
 <m0gel> before the boys started trying to get all up in your shit
 <soybean> hahhaha that sounds accurate, phil.

	First we must understand that the NOSFERATU, the vampyr, in the
 doorway shining so bright is FOREMOST a creature of the NIGHT! He is a
 killer! He is to KILL as we are to whine! It is the very essence of his
 nature!

	Everybody knows, everyboy know, you only live a day, but it's
 brilliant anyway.... It's brilliant anyway... ANYWAY, I'm not saying that
 when I step up the mike I'm the best, just that I'm brilliant. Fuck, if
 you could see my cat you'd caterwaul like Robert Plant... I can't stop
 talking about love! The secrets of their lives is S-E-f(x)! I saw you
 walk between all the people out making the scene... Ooooooooooh don't go
 to far, stay who you are... I'm lost in that sea of sorrowful sundays,
 there is a funeral procession, in the coffin is the body of Edgar Poe, he
 looks at me as if it was I who killed him. Perhaps it was. I am in
 Washington Square park, there is heroin in my body, I hallucinate the
 ghosts of those buried beneath me and those who were hung on these trees;
 the lights seem as though lit by gas. What is this world imposed over me?
 I'm on a stage... atheists and christians debating... I point out
 something ridiculous in the athiests' reasoning, I rush the stage, I
 return to my seat, a priest turns to me and says "GOOD JOB". I am
 revolted by his God. By his Christ. The only king left is King Kobek and
 he is busy mentally undressing Fay Wray Darfler, peeling her clothes like
 a banana... You're no good, you're no good, can't you tell that it's well
 understood?

	Cntrl-G is how I get my friends' attention. Other people rely on
 good characters and actually interesting personalities. I just make
 computers beep. PITY ME FOR I AM THE EMBODIMENT OF THE WORD PITEOUS...
 I'm an urchin lost in Oxford in 1350, the plague has hit, and it's the
 little ice age. Won't you do something to save me?

	Can anyone save me???? I CAN'T SAVE YOUUUUUuu I CAN BARELY SAVE
 MYSELF... Ah god, I am suffering under Caitlin's mp3 collection once
 more! It's burned into my drug filled brain; forever and a day, all 22
 songs will haunt me... FOREVER AND A DAY! I can not name them all. All of
 them are unnameable... SWOOSH by Dan Bern... Some crap by Ani DiFranco...
 some guilty pleasure by Joan Osbourne... MEN WITH HATS and their
 perennial 80s hit... THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS with "BIRD HOUSE IN YOUR SOUL"
 ABOUT 5 SONGS BY STABBING WESTWARD, like Chapter 12, in which it /is/
 revealed that I CAN'T SAVE YOU I CAN'T EVEN SAVE MYSELF... Pavement's
 "SPIT ON A STRANGER"... oh god, deliver me from those with crappy
 taste...

 Sweet little lady, don't you get crazy
 Bring it back home to me
 Woman little standing, dreaming to forget him
 bring it back home to me
 When? Why wonder? Brown-eyed stunner
 Come on, bring it back home to me
 Kiss a littlen dozen, fishing for your lover, 
 won't you bring it back home to me? 

 She looks like heroin, she kills the pain
 Call it what you want to call it, 
 call it danger honey, you said, "gimme that nicotine"
 Never wanna hold you, never wanna scold you, 
 I bet she's taking away from me
 Never will command you or ever reprimand you, 
 when you bring it back home to me

 Can't take candy from a baby, 
 when your baby gives it up for free

 She just puts around being lazy, 
 but still she brings her lovin' to me

 Don't need nothing to save me, 
 save for a piece of your luxury
    
 Lock the door, but you'll never cage me,
 I'll tell you just how it's gonna be

 I call your lover in the morning, 
 when you have your cup of tea

 You never give me your warning,
 so you better get ready for me
    
 Guess who's coming over,
 oh you think that's such a surprise

	A brief biographical sketch of the one known as Jarett Kobek, 
			gentleman, explorer, amateur scientist, 
			deep space probe, vampire, umpire, 
			statesman, 21st chromosone triplet, 
			lover, beloved, burned, bored, 
				tarred and feathered

	Born in Warwick, Rhode Island on February 7th, 1978, during the
 GREAT BLIZZARD. His mother required the national guard to dig her out of
 her brother's house. Got to the hospital, dropped the kid. And so it came
 to pass that Jarett was born and delivered in this modern world. 
		and so it came to pass that you bought an illusion
				and put it on the wall 


	Teletype? Teletype? Can you hear me? I believe he is starting to
 stir, but still he is not strong with the orgone, that mythical power
 through which all life is transmitted. The orgone! The orgone! Ah god,
 the orgone! They burned you alive for it, Wilhem, but we shall overcome
 and teletype SHALL live again. 

	the day I broke up with my boyfriend, 

				by little Jenn, 
						Age 13 

	My boyfriend Jim and I broke up after a few months of going out.
 It was very sad. He is a straight A student and I am a straight A student
 and we both were attracted to each other as soon as our eyes met in AP
 English. I have known Jim for a long time but I did not realize I liked
 him in that special way until our eyes met in AP English. Then I began to
 start feeling for him.
	Our time together sure was rough. It is hard to maintain a
 relationship with the pressures of being smart students. Smart students
 take difficult courses with a lot of homework. The honors classes can
 take it out of you. Life is hard. Still, we managed to see each other
 often, and sometimes we would have parties at Jim's house for us and the
 other honors students. Jim's dad is the super intendant of schools and he
 is a good guy.
	Sometimes during the parties Jim and I would go into the special
 closest where the action would get hot and heavy. I never took off any of
 my clothes and neither did he, but they were very intense experiences
 unlike anything I have ever felt. I did not think about sex and neither
 did Jim but maybe if things had gone on longer we would have had it. I am
 curious about sex. None of my friends have had it but I am curious about
 it. It seems like it could be a great thing.
	Jim and I broke up last week after going for 2 months. It was very
 sad. I don't remember who broke up with who, but in the end, we were not
 together. Life is a difficult thing in many situations. I am glad I did
 not take off any of my clothes. I hope Jim didn't break up with me
 because I am ugly. I hope he didn't break up with me because I didn't
 take off any of my clothes. I hope he didn't break up with me to date
 Natalie.

	Now, I like porn as much as the next guy, but shit, there isn't
 anything like INTERRACIAL porn. Boy, when I seem some big black stud
 just pounding his manthing away into a white bitch's pussie, boy, well, I
 don think I've ever come so hard. Those guys got dicks like TREE TRUNKS
 and they're planting them in the forest CAUCASIA. Yeah, they're taking

	Yes, See? One man firing a load at Jackie Kennedy's warm white
 bitch cunt wouldn't do shit, which is why Lee "Nigger Dick" Harvery
 Oswald was not the lone wanker that day. Sure, he was angled perfectly to
 spatter his nigger cum on the Kennedys, and in particular, Jackie's sweet
 tasting white bitch pussy, but to ensure J. Edgar Hoover's homo-erotic
 fantasy of seeing three black studs with 18" dicks jerking it onto the
 first lady's pussy, two other men were installed. That way her white girl
 tang could not avoid the cum. She would get it INSIDE and on the outside,
 and with luck become pregnant with a spade baby; then, after she had the
 obvious abortion, the medical documents would be placed inside one of the
 FBI's famous "suicide file" and sent to JFK & Jackie in the event they
 ever tried to take on the FBI's authority, and specifically that of famed
 transvestite and homosexual, J. Edgar Hoover. The other two gunmen are
 not known, but are rumored to be Nigger Lips McSpade, and Strokin' Donkey
 Dong Jones.

 [1 : dylan] i don't even know what the lie is.			
 [1 : dylan] i've hidden it so deeply.
 [1 : dylan] or convinced myself so well of..
 [1 : dylan] or something..
 [1 : dWi] well, maybe you could use some help to get down in there!
 [1 : dWi] deep stuff is a real pain in the ass
 [1 : dWi] cause there's no-one in yr life you can bounce it off of
 [1 : dWi] because they have their own perception of you, and you don't
           want them to think you're crazy, etc.
 [1 : dWi] which is what shrinks are for!

	go on, crawl out your window! You know that I need you to. I guess
 I should talk a little bit about Bob Dylan and what he means to me. Well,
 Bob Dylan, above all else, was a great bullshit artist. And I think
 that's what I find most profound in his early work. The enormous levels
 of bullshit and jokes and humor. It's FUNNY, you know? Well, except for
 TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGING, which is the only really bad album from the
 60s. A prefiguring of things to come. I mean, sure, he could be profound
 and unbelievably poetic, but at heart, all Bob Dylan ever wanted to be
 was a funny hillbilly singing songs about going down to the well and
 eating beneath the mill and fishing and women cooking up shortening

	And that's what bob dylan means to me. 

 [1 : dWi] I'm serious
 [1 : dWi] get your jacket
 [1 : dylan] and some nice fuzzy slippers.
 [1 : dWi] go into the bathroom
 [1 : dWi] bunch it up around your mouth
 [1 : dWi] and scream till you don't feel like screaming anymore.
 [1 : ldsa] > YOUR PAWN BROKER ROARED AND AH SO SO DID THE LAND LORD
 [1 : dylan] i don't have the energy to scream.
 [1 : ldsa] YOUR PAWN BROKER ROARED AND AH SO SO DID THE LAND LORD
 [1 : dWi] dylan : that's the depression tricking you
 [1 : dylan] i cannot
 [1 : dWi] depression makes it feel like you don't have the energy to do
           anything
 [1 : dWi] but you're just so depressed
 [1 : dWi] cause stuff is just weighing super heavy on yr heart
 [1 : dylan] like, i have systematically sabatoged my entire life.
 [1 : dylan] over the last year.
 [1 : dylan] everything that was dear to me.
 [1 : dylan] i have distanced myself from.

 and yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can't you reach? 

	I have tried to write words into a world. I may have failed. May
 the gods forgive me. May the ones I love forgive me. It was enough to
 create the entire world in a single microcosmic sentence, but I am a
 failure, and I can not even recreate her heart, so it will take me a
 longer time, a longer time, and larger amount of space to REMAKE life
 into words. Why are your fingers going up my sleeve? Can you ever forgive
 what I'm attempting? Will any ever see it? How many can traverse the way
 down here? I don't know... YOU KNOW IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH ME, YOU
 DIDN'T HAVE TO STAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY

	well 

	it's true I can't recall San Francisco at all
	I can't even remember EL PASO, HOOOOONEEEYYYYYYY

	fair you well boys fair you well, I'm going back to Baltimore. 

	I got more panchitos than a mexican; I got slick rivers like sex
 lives; I stab bootlegging record executives like JAY ZEE! I slash tires
 like a j.d. I break beats on the camel's hump. I SAW YOU GO BETWEEN ALL
 THE PEOPLE OUT MAKING THE SCENE! 

	break break your bones your heart it can all be broken with the
 twist of bone or the twist of a word. Everything you were is destroyed
 and pulled down like the temple in a.d. 70, everything you ever knew is
 GONE. All the people you ever loved are dead, all the friends you ever
 had are missing. What can you do? The people around you are shades from
 Hell, trying to drink the blood of a lamb, and when they do finally talk
 to you, they're hollow shells of humanity; How did you get here? How did
 you end up in this horrible fucking place? Where is there so much Danzig
 on the stereo? Could it be any worse? Could you be stuck in some texas
 border town looking down the sight of a gun at the greenbacks crossing
 over? Imagining picking them off, one by one, the women and children,
 their backs exploding in a fading glory of gore, and you'd be the
 arbitrator of life and death, for that slight moment you could be a God,
 but what of? Cheap trinkets and token emotions. You've given into your
 optimus prime evil side; now your autobot matrix is korupt and black; you
 actually bought into the lie everyone's always been telling you: That
 there is substance and there is meaning in the world. You believe it so
 much; there's gotta be a purpose; and then, when you look at your own
 life and can not help but feel the barren emptiness of the moors, you die
 a horrible little death inside. There's no substance here and there's no
 meaning here. SO YOU GIVE IN YOU SORRY SON A BITCH. YOU GIVE IN! And then
 your whole life became a menagerie of emotional nonsense, and you
 actually start to find it acceptable to sit around being miserable and
 depressed. You drink your depression like water from a glass. MMMMM, it's
 good; and then you let it motivate you and you start existing FROM IT; It
 becomes the center and the driving force in the lack of meaning and the
 removal of substance... Sucker.

	A cold hard man of science brings me a glass of methadone, "Drink
 of this and live forever," he tells me. What can I do but oblige? 

	Oh yeah, let me give you some of that real life primordial
 realism SHIT. Let me give you some of that nicker-bocker nigger-kicking
 REAL LIFE In your face, gonna make you gag till you puke, bitch slipping,
 duck training, baby baby tregar inducing, stuff you never wanted to see,
 pastiche writing, Did you know I cry?  I do.  Not an absurd amount, but
 enough to substantially qualify me as someone who does, indeed, cry.
 That's as far as I'm going tonight.  I cry.  The end. Actually, my tears
 have overcome my intent; I'm not going to write you no primordial realism
 today, no sir, not I. I've given that shit up. It's bad for the soul and
 it's bad for other peoples' hearts. I'm not out to hurt anything anymore.
 Now I just want to flow like the river and Sam Cooke's jive. It's very
 Zen, except I don't know anything about Zen, so I can't even come close
 to be qualifying what is and what is not Zen. AND ISN'T THAT THE ULTIMATE
 STATE OF ZEN? 

 I hear something from the orgone accumulator, I hear the cooking sounds
 of frying synapses: 

 It speaks:

 <meenk> tourists probably wouldn't take well to my brand of depravity  

 but ah 

 That is all it says for now. still it is dormant! Will my lovely teletype
 and meenk file never come to life? WILL IT NEVER LIVE? GOD, WILL IT NEVER
 LIVE?

 or what you're doing is wrong. Like for instance, let's say you're a

 is telling you you're doing something wrong. But if you're some buck
 toothed fat assed whiskey drink over-privileged whore from Beverley Hills
 dispensing blow jobs in the Oval Office, chances are you don't have a
 conscience, so the whole point is moot anyway. Yes, it's time to declare
 war on L.A., and the way to do it is go down to the West Village and blow
 up Monica Lewinsky's apartment. I could do it right now if I had a pipe

	1. Create a blistering emotional wound of a text file that
 encompasses various text file motifs. write a file that the general
 populace will find so painful that the idea of ever revisiting these
 motifs and themes will drive them to physical illness, thereby saving 
 myself from ever having to see the same 10 text files again. 

	2. say a lot of stupid shit.

	3. establish a method of text file sampling previously
 experimented with but never fully executed and thought out.

	4. rip off a lot of people.

	5. create a file so long and obnoxious that my three fans (mogel,
 basehead, and tasha) who ordinarily hang on every word that I type, and
 my obligated girlfriends (caitlin and darwin) who feel some sort of
 relationship duty to read my disgusting shit, create a file so long that
 even these two disparate groups of people are forced to abandon it long
 before, thereby reducing and degrading them to the level of all the other
 people in the world. I will be the true isolationist. I already feel like
 Robinson Crusoe so I might as well live it. All the friends I ever had
 are gone.

	6. Finally end the teletype ordeal. A heroin crazed halloween has
 moved my friendship with the big TT outside of random abuse and stupidity
 and now it would no longer seem proper, but really what moved it outside
 of that paradigm is a vixen from michigan.

 To: jwk208@is8.nyu.edu

 Hello Jarett,

 Right.  I don't mean to be defensive or whatever right off, but instead
 of feeling awkward yourself writing an introductory email, you decided to
 make me feel incredibly awkward by writing a love letter for all of hoe
 to read? That was definitely not a favorable first impression.  However,
 a reliable source told me that it was probably not your intention to make
 me uncomfortable and that you're a nice person, so I'm giving you another
 chance.

 What do I do?  Well I live in New Jersey, year round.  In the summer I'm
 in north Jersey, right outside NYC, and the rest of the year I go to
 Rutgers in New Brunswick.  I work in a music store, and I'm a DJ on the
 radio.  I'm really really into music, especially English stuff and stuff
 from the 80s. Right now I'm off writing, because I just don't have any
 subject matter. What I have been working on recently, with a lot of
 breaks, is a dialogue. My absolute favorite authors are Stephen Fry,
 David Sedaris, and Oscar Wilde, because they all share my favorite
 characteristic in a writer: good, old-fashioned wit.

 I'm a psychology major. I'm into the biological/chemical aspects of it,
 not that bullshit therapy stuff.  I am an incredible judge of character
 too, if I do say so myself.

 I do not usually associate with other writers or DJs, because I find most
 to be incredibly pseudo-intellectual.  I'm more impressed with a good
 person than a "smart" person.  I really don't care how much someone knows
 about some obscure artist or how random they can be.

 Anyway, I'm still not exactly thrilled about how you chose to get in
 touch with me.  It'll take me a while to stop feeling uneasy.

 Hi there.

 I'm glad you understand how I feel, I'm kinda going through a rough patch
 at this point in my life.  Everything has been freaking me out lately,
 I'm really on edge.  I got a letter last night from some random whose AOL
 screen name is similar to mine, telling me off for being unoriginal.
 Meanwhile, her name was spelled LiKe ThiS.

 Res Ipsa Loquitor, eh?  I'm also a Latin geek.  I've had it in high
 school and 2 semesters in college.  My minor is Classics, which is pretty
 much ancient Greek and Roman history along with some ancient languages.
 Latin is my ancient language of choice.  It's fun! Either that or I'm a
 huge geek, my bet is on the latter. :)

 I forgot to mention one of my favorite authors in my last letter.
 Probably cos he hasn't done anything recently, but I love Tom Robbins.
 He's as close to random stuff as I get.  Random as in bordering on
 incoherence.

 As for pseudo-intellectualism, generally the attitude of "I am so smart
 and the world must know it, plus I have no sense of humor about myself"
 is the attitude that gets to me.  I have encountered way too many people
 with no ability to make fun of themselves.  Basically, I appreciate
 humility.  I have been told that I am "apologetic" of my "intellect," and
 I never let on about how much I know about what.  I don't mean to sound
 braggy (we can create our own words, can't we? :)), it's just what
 someone said to me.

 Anyway, that's all for this evening's babbling.  Catch you later...

 My dearest not-so-secret admirer,

 Oftimes I wonder where you have gone, with whom and why.  My letter to
 you had gone unanswered, and I believed our correspondence to be at an
 end.  I thought you no longer were interested in carrying on with me, the
 atmosphere in the channel that night we spoke was rather, as it were,
 uncool, man. It had nothing to do with you, you were barely there that
 night, disappointingly.  I genuinely do find you to be quite interesting,
 but please understand my (Groucho) Marxist stance on groups of people.  
 Call me antisocial and the like, but there's always one person in the
 group that will either vex me or get my dander up.  Another lame excuse
 of mine is that I just moved, and another would be my over-involvement in
 my job as a purveyor of pretentiousness at a local record store.  Anyway,
 I just want to reassure you that I do want to maintain contact with you,
 but this is a two way street you know.  As much as I enjoy pontification,
 it's dead boring to everyone else.  Speaking of which, have you seen my
 poor excuse for a webpage? It's http://members.tripod.com/~Grlfrmars...
 sign my guestbook! (nag nag nag) By the way, when do you go back to New
 York?  We could possibly do something silly like go to the Met if you're
 interested.  I love that place.  Well I must get back to the
 all-consuming chore of getting the damned fly out of my room.  I've
 always wanted a pet, but this was not what I had in mind. Write back
 soon. :) I will leave you with some words of wisdom (from a reggae song I
 heard at work) which apply to your religious inquiries:  "Shake that
 booty that Jesus gave you."  Wishing you much shaking of booty,

 you weren't in the channel last night while I was there, I do want to

 human but it didn't matter because he was sad and pathetic and hell she
 was the possessor of a cunt, perhaps not the best cunt, but a cunt all
 the same.
	he did not know from using his computer to talk to her, well
 several computers really, he didn't know from using his computer to talk
 to her if her cunt would stink or if it would smell like the morning dew
 settling on roses, but he sorely hoped it would be the latter option.
 Just in case, he bought some pussy cleaning fluid. If her pussy stank he
 planned to tell her it "turned him on" to apply the cleaning fluid to a
 girl's "pussy".
	she was flying in on wednesday. it was her spring break and he
 wanted to get away from home. she would come to him with her cunt that he
 did not know the scent of. he wasn't really sure what she got the

 this file isn't about me? God, Lish, baby, honey doll, I love you, and
 we're the bastard sons of no one, oh god baby, won't you come back to me
 soon, please baby? I want to tattoo and pierce you and photograph you and
 put it all the fucking way up in FLESH MUTATE magazine and oh baby, I

 can you not worry about calamity?  put all your eggs in a basket like
 this and BOOM! something not-so-good is liable to happen.  he knew

        he to this day doesn't remember the next few moments in very
 particular detail.  all he knows is that after some hand fidgeting, some
 hand jockeying, a couple glances at each other, he was surprised to find
 that they were kissing, kissing on the bus.  she'd said "kiss me on the
 bus" before.  they both knew that that was an old song, even though they
 weren't sure who by.

<que> kried, have you ever seen my picture? (i am guessing so :)
<AltRocks> no
<AltRocks> it's me
<Quarex> GOD THIS IS SO FUCKING GODAWFUL
<swissphil> HAhahahahhahaha
<Quarex> BULLS ON PARADE
<kreid> yeah
<que> aidz, i'm female obviously.

	Why do you put in IRC logs to your files? I don't know but I gotta
 do it, it's a compulsion like cockroaches covering my body, gotta do what
 I gotta do so I do it and you all spew it. Spew. Dead waters rise high
 than my mind. I hate all of you. Every last one of you. But you still
 read on, regardless of my hate, regardless of the burning fury and
 loathing that I have. Every friend I ever had is gone. Sometimes I cry.
 I'm so lonely cuz I am got no homely women.

	Let's just... So you're all alone once again, and you know that
 tomorrow's gonna be the same as it was today, and you can't pretend like
 you're who you weren't. it'll eat you up inside like a television but you
 can't say no and you can't hide and you have to do it and you don't even
 seem particularly interested in the sex anymore, but still, you'll fuck
 until your thighs bleed, because you're a miserable cretin, a wretch on
 the face of the earth. Yeah disappointment's always there for me,
 disappointment's my best friend, I hide beneath the apple tree, and all
 the apples fall on me. Gonna give my heart to the pigs to roll on, and
 they're gonna cool their sweatless bodies on my sorrow, yeah, it's like
 water in the dirt, it makes some killer mud, oh shit, your daddy's full
 of termites. Bleeding women always follow me. it was and I would prefer
 not to recall it was during beauty's decline. Today in paris the women
 are stained with blood. 

	Sometime I'll have to edjumacate you. 

	I live in a church where I sleep with voodoo dolls and I won't
 give up the search for the ghosts in the halls I wear sandals in the snow
 and a smile that won't wash away I wonder if I can look out the window
 without my shadow getting in the way I'm so beautiful with an edge and a
 charm I'm so careful when you're in my arms.... I woke up screaming aloud
 a prayer to my secret God I feed off your fears and hold back my tears Oh
 I give you a tantrum and know-it-all grin just when you need one When the
 evening is thin I'm a beautiful, a beautiful fucked up man I'm setting up
 my razor wire shrine

				"oooh little darling"

						by Quarex, the Manthing 

	I know a girl I know a girl I knew a girl cuz know she don't wanna
 know me cuz I tried to kiss her and my tongue is like a hunk of
 kryptonite going up super-man's asshole, except his asshole is her mouth
 and now we don't kiss no more. 
	Yeah so I went on a date with this girl, and hell yeah, she was
 hot, and I was like giving her my Frank Sinatra eyes, but she wasn't
 having any love from ol' Drew HUNT, no, she was just giving me hate. I
 tried to kiss her and she threw water on me and then and made out with a
 dog named Spot. Then the dog pissed on her and threw her down a flight of
 stairs and when I tried to help her up she ran to spot and forgave him.
 She didn't even look at me, to see it was me who helped her up.
	Why are girls so dumb? 
	Let me tell you about this other girl. well, her ass was sweet and
 I loved her from the moment I saw her, so I went up to her, and I said,
 "If you come with me I'll take you to Mars and I'll give you everything
 you ever wanted." Then she spit on me and took up with a hooligan who
 pissed on her and threw her down a flight of stairs and when I tried to
 help her up she ran to the hooligan and forgave him. She didn't even look
 at me, to see it was me who helped her up.
	I'm not mad, though, because I just think of some Guns N Roses
 lyrics that were etched in my brain so many years ago, and this is what
 I'm going to say to her, and to all the girls, and to my future wife and
 soul mate someday, and she's gonna know how true it is: 

     I see you standin'
     Standin' on your own
     It's such a lonely place for you
     For you to be
     If you need a shoulder
     Or if you need a friend
     I'll be here standing
     Until the bitter end
     No one needs the sorrow
     No one needs the pain
     I hate to see you
     Walking out there
     Out in the rain
     So don't chastise me
     Or think I, I mean you harm
     Of those that take you
     Leave you strung out
     Much too far
     Baby-yeah

     Don't ever leave me
     Say you'll always be there
     All I ever wanted
     Was for you
     To know that I care

	So sweetheart, wherever you are, I love you even though I don't
 know you, and sleep well, and think of the time we'll be together, in the
 not too distant ("I Hope!") future. Our minds and bodies melding together
 like the ultimate post-erotic star trek experience. I love you, dear. 


	If I knew how to parody that unrelated style of file, I'd do it,
 but I don't, so I'd just like to use this space to once again apologize
 for making Unrelated a member of HOE. He's a piece of shit. And he sucks,
 and it's really sad he isn't dead. When I read that email I got a major
 erection, so I compulsively masturbated, and then I looked up in my
 mailbox, and there was mail from phairgirl telling me he wasn't dead, and
 my post-mortem orgasm was actually a pre-mortem orgasm and that just
 soured the flavor of my own semen to wild grape rather than orange
 julius.

          In that cafe crowded with fools we stood

          of liking men; they never thought, the cunts.
          We sat on their dim-witted innocence
          Their standard loves, their tiny gold rules
          While holding to our principles and tools
          We swung and parried to our heart's content

	All these stages of the old and the dying all these loves of the
 young and the stupid all these stages of the theatrical and gay all these
 lusts of the middling and ill all these copernicean dreams of my own
 death at my own hands suicide you may think but i mean something more
 glorious something better than mere suicide I mean to erase any existence
 of my own self from this world with the power of the mind all images get
 corrupted ; they're like apples exposed to the air ; i plan to corrupt my
 own ; and by so distorting the image from the reality i shall cease to
 exist and that manthing known as kobek will become hidden in the tapestry
 backwards and never be seen again the total immolation of being 

	I've grown tired at last of this ancient world... uh, I mean I've
 gotten real sick of playing this orgone accumulator thing, so I'm just
 gonna give you that sweet shit, that Latka Teletype shit, just give them
 what they WANT! Fine, yes, fine, good. But I remain adamant; the concept
 has been beaten to death; it's  dead horse; I won't write anymore files
 about teletype or meenk, unless perhaps I release a uuencode of her
 genitalia entitled "TELETYPE HIT THIS SHIT", but that notwithstanding, I
 shall do nothing further with the theme or idea. I include it here in HOE
 #999 so that the dead horse may not just be a theoretical dead horse but
 may acquire the flavor and taste of putrefaction as all such things in
 HOE #999 possess. yes, yes, now you know that horrid truth: HOE #999 is
 to kill all and kill none. My grand endeavor, of course, will fail
 miserably, but still, it's nice to see some effort come with it. some
 purpose, some need; isn't it? Oh yes. Oh yes, yes, yes it is. So, without
 much further adieu here's the teletype file: 

	I feel in some ways that I, Jarett, have seriously maligned both
 meenk and teletype. In that I have found meenk in the channel (#ezines)
 speaking of taking teletype's virginity, I always assumed her hard-assed,
 I'm-oh-so-worldly-wise-due-to-my-exorbitant-sexuality-and-oh-so-
 frank-discussions-of-human-sexuality-and-oh-so-hard-core-due-to-these-odd-
 observations-on-human-nature-but-please-let's-not-forget-that-I-am-also-
 a-little-bit-tragic-and-deserving-of-human-pity-and-sympathy-for-this-the-
 fate-of-my-own-making-but-is-it-really-not-of-my-own-making-when-you-
 consider-my-incredibly-sad-and-tragic-past-something-out-of-Aeschylus-
 really to be, in some ways, the primary motivator of her actions. What I
 mean to say is, I did not consider the possibility that she was
 self-aware enough to have different motivators outside of her carefully
 constructed image, and that when she slept with teletype, she was
 thinking, "Ah, more experience of the shit of life, more terror and
 horror! I am a friend to all things dark and dreary! This just adds to
 the shit I have suffered! More! More! Bring on the pains of mortal men,
 my heart will absorb them all."
	Unfortunately, it seems that I was wrong. 

	It seems that this relationship, which was brief, undoubtedly,
 which I had assumed came out of some self-destructive impulse, actually
 was motivated, according to meenk, out of love. 
 
	She loved the big lug. That's why she slept with him. 

	At least that's what she claims, and in a way, I'd like to believe
 it. It's a decent end to the whole fucking spectacle I have created. That
 I have mocked the existence of love while trying to mock the existence of
 depravity. Even if it proves to be false, and it's a way for meenk to add
 yet another layer to that oh-so-well-crafted self-image, I'd like to
 believe it for a little while. I'd like to believe that when the dick
 went into the pussy, she really did love him. LOVED HIM LIKE HE WAS THE
 GOD OF LOVE. Yeah, I see it now. the flesh parting beneath the parting
 flesh, teletype's dick is the moses of her red sea of pussy flesh, and it
 is not lust or the ejaculatory need that spreads the shore, but rather
 love divine and incarnate in the flesh of these two miscreant misfits. 

	They were in LOVE, for god's sakes! What the hell is wrong with
 me? Why did I become such a vicious prosecutor of their open wound? Why
 was I Pilate?! GOD I DON'T KNOW! Perhaps in a way, HOE #999 is a
 testament to the size of my ego, for I have taken the entire text file
 world and scene of the past ten years and not reflected upon it, nor
 given it a witty, oh-so-wise theme or spin, but rather have used it as a
 facet of EGO. 

	You are not people, I say. I am the only person, I say. You are
 mere facets of the self, I say. What self? you ask. The only true self, I
 say, the self that is me, that is kObek, that is living breathing flesh
 god you never tried to worship for fear he'd not answer the door.

	Suffer beneath these fists and keep your lusts trim. Keep the deep
 Helm stoned and boned. Keep mogel awake and pictures of Jarett and
 Caitlin atop your mini-tower. Keep the water flowering and the diet pepsi
 blistering. Keep the bones rolling and the dice strolling! Keep the
 balcony door shut, it's getting cold. Keep the cold open it's getting
 warm. Keep the gods pacificed they're getting old.. Keep the old alive
 they're getting young. Keep your shoes on, they're getting muddy. keep
 the mud wet it's getting bloody. Keep the blood boiling, you're getting
 rheumatic.

 From: CAS Student Council
 To: CAS students

 The School of Education offers four courses in American Sign Language.
 Heretofore, these courses could not be used in fulfillment of the
 foreign-language requirement in CAS. As of this past Spring, CAS policy
 has changed. The current policy is that any student who wishes to count
 ASL as a foreign language can ask the Committee on Undergraduate Academic
 Standards for an allowance to count it as such. (The Committee has been
 instructed to grant such permission without fuss.) If you wish such
 permission, fill out a petition form in the Advising Center (905 Main).

 For more information on taking courses outside CAS, see an advisor in 905
 Main; for more information on the ASL courses, see the Deafness
 Rehabilitation Department (Education Building, twelfth floor).

	"My Book Report on Angela's Ashes
		 and Tis by delightful Frank McCourt"

						by MEENK

	Having not actually read either book, I can only proffer my
 opinions on Frank McCourt and his wonderful works with the caveat that
 they are based in heresay and nonsense. Well, first and foremost, you
 must understand that growing up in the Irish town of Limerick was not an
 easy thing for Frank McCourt.
	He suffered greatly. Of course, since I too, in my long hard
 battle of a life have suffered greatly, I can not empathize nor
 sympathize with his suffering. He deserved to suffer, because I have
 suffered, and as I have for the most part elevated myself from my
 suffering, so too do I hope that Frank McCourt did the same. What I mean
 to say is, if I was exceptionally poor and then suddenly became
 exceptionally rich, I would not give back any money to my urban
 community. I would become as avaricious and greedy as any person had ever
 become before. I would be a rap star.
	Frank McCourt's life was tough and bad. At Least I think it was,
 because I haven't read either book. Somehow, my total lack of knowledge
 about the books and gross ignorance about pretty much everything else in
 life makes me the perfect commentator on this particular subject. And, if
 you really want to know the more abstract truth, my ignorance makes me
 the perfect commentator on every subject, not just that delightful Frank
 McCourt.
	For instance, because I am full of shit and will never make any
 sense, and never have made any sense, I am incapable of seeing how fucked
 I truly am. Most decent people, upon catching a reflection of themselves
 in the proverbial mirror, would cower in shame at how ridiculous they
 truly are. Myself, however, am so blinded by my ignorance that I am quite
 similar to an owl in daylight. Because I can not see anything, my
 blindness empowers me to sound off on any given subject I like. 
	A favorite topic of mine is this so-called "pussy stare" that men
 get when they do so peruse the genitalia of women. First hand, I say, men
 always seem rather befuddled upon looking down the barrel of my cootchie,
 and get this dumb look on their face that reminds me of cocker spaniels
 at midnight. I would propose that men get this so-called "pussy stare"
 because they are enraptured with that which they can never possess. I
 would propose that faced with the pussy they become dumb animals
 over-awed by the ultimate unknown.
	The fact that my own genitals (as so clearly revealed in
 pierce.jpg) look something like wet roast beef put through a wheat
 thrasher left around to sit since last Sunday, I say again, the fact that
 my own genitals look like this means nothing. Clearly when men are faced
 with genitalia of the woman they become overwhelmed with the ultimate
 unobtainable. It is inconceivable to me that they might just be spooked
 out by my moist slathering cootchie and wonder what they have gotten
 themselves into. No, this not temporal, watson, this is not elementary,
 WATSON, this is a topic of universal hard-assed profundity.

	But the man who has made millions on his long-running sitcom, in
	part, by glorifying the single life and poking fun at commitment,
	eluded the press on his wedding day by using a decoy limousine.

                  His honeymoon plans were kept quiet, too.

	they'll korupt hoe #999 and turn it into bastion of the
 bourgeoisie, yes, god knows they will. They'll take it from what it was
 and they'll make it the direct opposite, not with their own generation,
 of course, but with the generation that is to come. In 40 years, I'll be
 helping your grand children through high school. They'll have to read me
 and learn me and they'll hate me just like you hate Emily Bronte. 

				JOHN 19
	
	1: Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. 
	2: And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
           head, and they put on him a purple robe, 
	3: And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their 
           hands. 
	4: Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold,
           I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault
           in him.
	5: Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
           purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!


	"But, Jarett," said Caitlin, "do you really have to do this?"
	"I'm afraid so," I said, and wiped a solitary tear off her cheek.
 In the distant sunlight her face was a plum asking to be skinned, but up
 close, here under the stars, it was a the lone surviving cherry blossom
 of a grotto long paved over and turned into a parking lot. I didn't want
 to cause her the pain, but there was nothing else I could do. 
	She said my name again, and I relished her mid-western accent. From
 time to time I'd teased her about it being Nova Scotian, impersonating
 this hacker Black Monday who used to call me up and ask about UNIX. Much
 laughter had by all as I made my voice a shrill blister aching out the
 words, "JERRETT, JERRETT, HELP ME HACK A EUNUCHZ, EH?"
	I could hear, in the distance, the plaintive call of Cthulhu
 coming from HOE #999. He was the first text file I'd ever really taken in
 is a pet, and god damn, he sure was loud. Worse than my old beagle,
 Jasper, who had barked consistently through my entire life, and worse
 than my cat Dean, who talked in meows more than most people did with
 words.
	She sighed and rolled her eyes as the calls of HOE #999 reached
 her. I tried to justify myself. I tried to explain that sometimes things
 happened in life which transcended mortal concerns, and that I could not
 miss a moment where my entire destiny would be decided. I was to be Lord
 Jim as the ship was perceived to begin sinking. Would I jump or would I
 stay aboard? I didn't want to make the wrong choice. This was my Lord Jim
 moment. But she didn't care, she didn't want to hear any of it, and I
 couldn't blame her. 
	If she had told /me/ that one of her text files, regardless of
 length, had become suddenly animate and required assistance in a grand
 journey, and that she might never come back, I'd be pretty upset. I'd be
 bawling, I'm sure. Out and out. So I couldn't blame her. I might have
 even taken it worse than she did. It was clear she wasn't going to stop
 me, that she would let me throw the whole thing away on what amounted to
 hideous pipe dream. I don't think I could have been big enough of a
 person to do it. It made the leaving all the more painful. 
	I tried to kiss her, but she wouldn't let me. HOE #999 came over
 the distant hills and we saw him and heard him. He cried out and I
 answered with a, "Here boy, here!" It wasn't long before HOE #999 was at
 our ankles, rubbing up against us and mewling. 
	"You could come with us, you know," I told her.
	"No," she said, "I couldn't."
	"No, no, I guess you really couldn't." 
	Do you know what love is? she asked me. 
	Sure I do. 
	A boy loves his text file.

			chapter II: in which it is proved an easier
			            thing to eat cockroaches than 
				    carbon-14 date rats

	Having fed Caitlin's body to HOE #999, and thus severing the last
 tie with this world, I decided to shed off this mortal coil.
	The glass knife was cool in my hand, and I passed it to HOE #999.
 He fingered it in one paw and then passed it to the other, trying to get
 ahold of its weight and shape. "Cut me free," I said. He glowered for a
 moment. A silly below escaped his lips. "It's not for me to use a knife." 
	his first words. I felt a father's joy as his mouth moved up and
 down my body, facial hair pricking my side, as he searched for the cord
 and sinew that kept soul in body. "Don't forget to free yourself
 afterwards, boy,' I said. I felt an excruciating pain and heard a
 crunching sound and then I felt and heard no more. I was above my body
 looking down. What an ugly bastard I had turned out to be.
	I watched as dear sweet HOE #999 drew my knife to his own body and
 plunged it in to that very spot where flesh became life. His eyes rolled
 back and his body collapsed into a heap. I became aware of a presence
 beside me, and I looked, and saw HOE #999 not as he had been in life, but
 as he should have been. Beautiful and sanguine. He was a yellow and blue
 striped shirt on the body of a girl. He was everything good and pure and
 beauteous. HOE #999, my son, my pet, my creation. Not what I had
 actually created, but what I had wanted to create. My dreams fulfilled. 
 Ah, love, it was good. 
	"Well boy, looks like we gotta go." 
	
				chapter III: in which our hero learns
					the value of a good blow-job
					can outweigh any amount of gold

 Welcome to the fun time
 We're so happy here
 We've no minds, we might as well be blind
 We can lie together here
 You can come down and join us
 You're more than welcome to
 Even though it's painful to the ears
 But it might not all be true
	
				HOE #999 AND I
			SAW THE PATH OF HEAVEN
			BEFORE US. WE KNEW WE
			MUST GO INTO THAT 
			GREATER GLORY. IT WAS
			EVIDENT AND NECESSARY.
			THE MOON BEAMS LIT OUR
			WAY. WE WENT INTO THE
			LIGHT WHICH WAS 
			PAINFUL. WE ESCHEWED
			THE LIGHT WHICH WAS 
			PLEASANT. IN HEAVEN 
			WE FOUND OURSELVES
			AT THE GATES. ST. 
			PETER WAS THERE. HE 
			HAD A BOOK. I THOUGHT
			IT WAS A BOOK OF NAMES
			OF DEEDS AND SINS. 
			I WAS WRONG.
			IT WAS A PRINTED COPY
			OF HOE #999. HE ASKED
			MY FILE FOR AN 
			AUTOGRAPHY. I COYLY 
			TOLD HIM I HAD YET TO 
			TEACH MY DARLING SON
			HOW TO WRITE. PETER
			SAID I MIGHT BE A BAD
			FATHER. I SAID IT'S A
			WICKED LIFE. HE AGREED.
			I ASKED HIM WHAT MY 
			FATE WAS GONNA BE FOR
			TELLING ALL THOSE LIES.
			HE LAUGHED AND TOLD ME
			THAT MY LIES WERE SMALL
			LIES, AND THE GREATER
			SIN WAS NOT THE LYING,
			BUT THE THINKING MY 
			LYING HAD BEEN ANYTHING
			IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH TO 
			WARRANT A BANISHMENT 
			FROM HEAVEN. I LAUGHED.
			ALWAYS THE EGOTIST. 
			OPEN THE GATES, I SAID.
			SO HE DID. 

			interlude: the long goodbye beholds the man

	Behold the man! He is risen before you! Back and forth and over
 again! He is alive and gone and dead and they stabbed Lazarus but did he
 really die and I can't say! behold the man! Kobek is from the world
 universal perfect makeup done by Hollywood consultants makes me the first
 and the last. I am the alpha and the omega. I am the beginning and the
 end. Woooooooo little honey don't you speak money don't you bring it to
 me. CAN NOT SEE YOU ANYMORE. GIRL YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO FALLING ACROSS THE
 FLOOR. 

	I imagine you're all expecting some profound meditation which ties
 it all together, which takes all the loose ends and puts them into one
 ball of yarn for Dean to roll around in. You're wrong. It ain't gonna
 happen little mother, so keep waiting. Filled my Diet Pepsi with
 fertility drugs won't help neither. I don't need my car cleaned or
 nothing stolen out of it neither. And so we have come to the end, the end
 the end...

	You're a la di da driving around in flashy cars
	You're a la di da di da di da 
	DI DA 

	Perhaps the only final thought I can leave you with is this:
 Blatant is boring. It's why I hate Ani DiFranco it's why I hate you it's
 why I hate mostly everything. Anything you can say blatantly can be said
 a million times better with artifice and humor. It's all too easy to
 simply throw down exactly what you're thinking and feeling. It's all too
 easy to make overt political statements. It's all too easy to live your
 life thinking you're some hardassed motherfucker who doesn't need nobody.
 Who knows all the answers and can solve all the chinese puzzle boxes. I'm
 not just talking about artsy things now, I'm talking about how you choose
 to live your lives. 

	I don't know, maybe I'm totally wrong, but I could never live like
 you do. I could never start from a point of negated reality and make the
 conscious decision to stay at the point of negated reality. I could never
 play the little tricks on myself, pretending like I know about the CRUEL
 REALITY OF LIFE, pretending like I'm some hard assed motherfucker,
 pretending that everything sucks, pretending that there's nothing out
 there in the first place. 

	Anyway; I think all I'm trying to say is: don't sell yourselves
 short. You're probably a lot better human beings than you're willing to
 let on, and it's a fucking shame to sit around pretending to be some
 primordial beast who fucks, eats, shits, gets high and dies. It's a
 waste.

	And you all know how I feel about waste.
