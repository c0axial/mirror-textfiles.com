  To me poetry is an expression of the soul.  I write poetry to tell how I
feel, what I believe, what I fear, and what I like.  In my poetry I express
my thoughts, feelings, and emotions.  When I write poetry - I escape.  It's
like daydreaming, but it makes it more believable and more real than a dream.
This probably sounds nuts, but it keeps me sane.  When this world gets to be
too much, I just pretend I'm somewhere else, with someone else.. happier...
better.  Someone can learn a lot about me just by reading my poetry... and
that's why I like to write it.


Crystal Wine Glass
------------------

i sit at a table
with a crystal wine glass
filled to the brim with red
i stare at the glass
and see all my pain
and with one drink
it would all be gone

i can drink
from the crystal wine glass
filled to the brim with red
and end my problems
and my pain
i can stop the rain
the stinging rain
from falling
if only for awhile

i place
the crystal wine glass
filled to the brim with red
against my lips
and i can taste
the smooth liquid
and the desire grows
i tilt my head back
and with it the glass
and i drink away my agony

i stare 
at the crystal wine glass
no longer
filled to the brim with blood
and nothing changes
it only gets worse
i drink to forget
but it makes me remember
what i am

i pick up
the crystal wine glass
no longer
filled to the brim with blood
and smash it against the wall
things will never change
things can never change
it's a never ending cycle
if sleeping and feeding

my pain
my sorrow
my problems
will never end
and they follow me
throughout the years

so i drink blood
out of necessity
and desire
and as the glass shattered
so does my hope
hope for a cure
hope for a change

so i continue to feed
i continue to hate
i continue to "live"
and hope
to die


                     They
                     ----

                They lie
                They conspire
                They cover-up the truth
                They hide the facts
                They call it classified
                They deny it ever happened
                They watch us
                They control us
                They control what we see
                They control what we know
                They can not be truted
                They are the government


                        Alone
                        -----

        I walk the streets at night, alone
        Looking for my prey
        Soon I will take flight
        Crossing the sky at night
        So alone
        I have longed to find a love
        For all of the hundreds of years
        That this creature has prowled the night
        But now I long for blood
        I see a victim
        Way down there
        I can smell the blood in the air
        And in a breath
        I taste it on my lips
        Now dyed red
        Will someone help me esca from my hell?
        Who would love a creature of the night?
        If I had the strength
        I would hold a cross up high
        And watch the sun rise
        But I am weak and can not do it
        Oh how I have longed to be mortal again
        They offered the gift of immortality
        But they never said at what price
        There is a lonely sole
        Walking all alone
        But there is something about him
        What is it?
        I can't anymore!
        Can someone fall in love in a glimpse?
        Can I fall in love?
        A creature without a sole
        Alive but dead
        I want a normal life
        The life I never had a chance to have
        To go out at day
        And have fun at night
        What a cursed life I live
        But what to do about him?
        Should I approach him?
        Can I resist the desire for his blood
        And instead fall in love?
        I approach him and try to talk
        Try to make sense
        All I can managesay is "hi"
        I mumble to myself "he will not die"
        The urges in me are so strong
        But if I am to escape
        From my endless night
        I must fight
        I'm about to walk away
        When he asks me to stay
        Could it be
        That he can see
        Deep inside
        Where the love hides?
        We talk for awhile
        And I wonder if
        I should tell him
        About my curse
        What would he say?
        What would he do?
        He asks if he can see me in the morn'
        I tell him I hide from the sunlight
        I live in the night
        When the darkness outside
        Matches the darkness in my heart
        He seems confused
        But agrees to make it night
        And when he leaves I take flight
        Still hungry
        But with hope
        What will happen?
        No one knows
        But in the end
        He will die
        And I again will be alone
        Forever to fly
        Through the night sky
        Forever to feed
        Forever indeed
        Maybe someone will kill me
        Or maybe I'll have the strength
        Or maybe I'll remain alone
        Forever alone
        So alone
        Alone

                        They are

                        All the pain
                        All the rain
                        All the hate
                        All the indifference

                        That I have
                        That I keep
                        Inside
                        So dark and deep
                        So they hide
                        From the light
                        The hurt
                        This China Doll
                        They hurt her a lot

                        Of the world
                        In her heart
                        In her mind

        Can help me

                           the red, burning desire
                           for the red, thick blood
                           my savage thirst
                           will never be satisfied
                           the burning flames
                           of a powerful desire
                           will never be quenched
                           so i prowl

                           for all eternity
                           for the undescribable
                           unbelievable high
                           from the taste
                           of blood


                Till Then My Sweet
                ------------------
                
                Till death
                Till life
                Till whenever we meet again
                Whenever that may be
                Whatever year
                Whatever time
                Whatever life 
                You may be living
                Till then
                My sweet
                Take care
                And take my love
                With you there


                                Why?
                                ----

                     you put the gun to your head
                     pulled the trigger
                     now you're dead
                     there's a bullet in your brain
                     you've ended all your pain
                     you never cared
                     you never thought
                     of the people you'd leave behind
                     you took the easy way out
                     you didn't even try
                     i won't shed a tear
                     i will not cry
                     you took away your pain
                     and dropped it all on me
                     why did you do it?
                     i'll never know why
                                
                                and yes,
                                        
                                        I did cry.

                        Out There
                        ---------

              There's gotta be
                Someplace
                Somewhere
                Better than this
              There's gotta be
                Something
                Out there
                And i don't want to miss
                It if there are

              Human beings
                So ignorant
                Arrogant
                Conceited and
                Confused
              With so many problems
                We don't know what to do
                So many filled with so much need
                Others kill out of greed

              On some distant planet
                On some distant star
                Oh so far
                Away
                And yet, so close
              Do you suppose
                It could all be true?
                And if it was...
                
                           What would you do?
