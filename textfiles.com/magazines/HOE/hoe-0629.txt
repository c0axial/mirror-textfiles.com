	I was in my creative writing class minding my own business when the
 teacher had the AUDACITY to assign our class something, an assignment?!  In
 school?!?  a class assignment no less?!  This horrible travesty really cut
 my psyche deep down but I readily obliged, I took an article and rewrote it
 in my own twisted way.  I decided I might as well type it out for you nice,
 caring, sensitive people.  The first half is the original article, the last 
 half is my interpretation and rewritten article...

        HBO telecast of "Titanic" sets record (New York Daily News).

	The biggest movie of all time is now also the most watched telecast
 this season on HBO.  Saturday night's telecast of "Titanic" averaged 8.6 
 million viewers, more than watched any other show on the pay-cabler this TV 
 year.  HBO is wired into 28.7 million homes.  Until Saturday, the Trinidad-
 Whitaker championship fight was HBO's most watched program of '98-'99, 
 averaging 7.1 million viewers.

	HBO's most watched big screen movie this season was "US Marshals"
 with 6.3 million viewers.  The initial airing of the much heralded season 
 finale of "The Sopranos" drew 5.2 million setsiders.`Within HBO homes, 
 "Titanic" drew a whopping 32 percent of the 18-49 year old viewers.  In the 
 national universe of 99.4 million TV homes, that translates to 13 percent
 of the 18-49 crowd, tying NBC's "Pretender" as the most watched TV show of 
 the night in the advertiser desired viewing group.

	Factored into last week's primtime rankings for the broadcast 
 networks (which reach more than 3 times as many homes as HBO), "Titanic" 
 would have finished No. 68.

        Now, it's my turn...

        HBO telecast of "Titanic" sets mass murder record.

	The biggest, most redundant, expensive and annoyingly predictable
 movie of all time is now the biggest, most redundant, expensive, annoyingly
 predictable AND only telecast this season on HBO to incite mass murder / 
 suicide.  Saturday night's telecast of "Titanic" averaged 7 million viewers,
 that think that Jack/Rose is real.  1 million suicides, caused by horrible
 acting and overwhelming despair, and .6 million acts of homicide, caused
 just by knowing that the movie is still prominent in everyone's mind.  More
 than any other show on cable this TV year... aside from the Monica
 Lewinsky / Barbara Walters interview (dear god I just wanted to jump out
 of a building seeing that for only 10 seconds).  HBO is plugged into the
 back of 28.7 million american's heads.

	Until Saturday the Trinidad-Whitaker championship farce was HBO's
 biggest waste of time for '98-'99 averaging 7.1 million disappointed 
 viewers.  HBO's most watched big screen, poorly written movie this season
 was "US Marshals" with 6.3 million viewers, half of which desperately
 waited in vain for Wesley Snipes to be killed, hopefully along with his
 acting career.  The initial airing of the much heralded season finale of
 "The Sopranos" drew 5.3 million viewers, most of which were dillusional
 teenagers thinking the TV-MA rating it has guarenteed lots of nudity, while
 at the same time wondering "What he hell does the title have to do with the
 show anyway?"

        Within HBO homes "Titanic" drew a relatively lameass 32 percent of
 the 18-49 year old viewers.  In the national universe of statistical
 nonsense it equates to some supposedly staggering figures, somehow.   The
 statistics did show however that it became tied with the equally ridiculous
 show "Pretender" as the most watched show while wishing to be comatose, in
 the advertiser-desired viewing group.  The advertisers, of course being
 medical companies and HMO's.

	Factored into last week's primtime rankings for the broadcast 
 networks (AKA "Destroyers of intelligent though, breeders of
 superficiality").  "Titanic" would have finished no. 68 which essentially
 means this article was a waste of time because the damn movie didn't even
 make the top 50.
