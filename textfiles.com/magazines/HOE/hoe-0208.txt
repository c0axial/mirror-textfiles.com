 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        [the explanation.]

        ANARCHY symbolizes an absence of government, and sometimes just
 general CHAOS.

        [the confusion.]

        all punks love ANARCHY.  they really do.

        because, hey, considering the terrible failure of modern american
 government, the entire anarchy movement truly should invite a whole lot of
 attention from, you know, punks everywhere.

        still, i can't help but think that there's something completely wrong
 with the whole anarchist philosophy.  and it pisses me off.  cause i'm a
 punk.  and punks are supposed to love anarchy.

        [so why can't anarchy work?  and forget conventional interpretations
 of american history.]

        try to understand how american politics developed.  ok, first these
 "radical" americans got angry over these "conservative" british because the
 brits were seeking to change the colonial way of life through huge taxations
 and such.  a sort of revolution occurs.

        keep in mind that divisions did exist within the revolutionary group
 itself: 1) the poor workers, who wanted complete social change to go along
 with their revolution, and 2) rich conservative professionals, who despised
 the brits because their property was being threatened.

        alright, when the revolution is over and everything, the rich guys,
 who are in control, are faced with a difficult task of designing a brand new
 government.  and they make the constitution.

        so, it's during this part where you want to say: "oh no!  that was a
 big mistake!  george washington and all those founding fathers really fucked
 up with that one!  i mean, what a stupid form of government! what were they
 thinking!  a supreme court?  HA!"

        but wait.  shouldn't you first try READing the constitution before
 ridiculing it in a like manner?  go ahead.  take a look at a copy of it
 right now, maybe in an encyclopedia somewhere.

        [now that you're done...]

        you may dispute it, but from what i understand, the constitution that
 the founding fathers developed actually represents a great achievement.  not
 only the document itself, but the whole attitude behind it.  cause again, i
 may be wrong, but it seems that, when devising their new government, the men
 who wrote the document truly did realize what the hell is wrong with
 mankind: innate selfishness.

        yes.  it's true.  we're all selfish.  you probably don't think you
 are, but TRUTHFULLY you are very self-centered.  do you say you love your
 girlfriend, honestly?  yes, of course you love your girlfriend!  you love to
 FUCK her!  (ha, ha.)  and why do you help people do stuff?  cause it makes
 you feel good, that's why!  to make a point, even the founding fathers were
 greedy!  just take a big look at all of that shit about contract clauses in
 the constitution.

        anyway, it can just be assumed that those great historical figures
 were right.  yes, the government that george washington and his friends
 created was exceptionally suitable for the evil that is american society.
 see, you might think that to regard everyone and everybody as selfish is a
 cynical statement, but it's not.  it's REALISTIC.  and it was because the
 fathers were realistic that they made a (kind of) peaceful form of rule that
 lasted way up until the civil war.

        [almost the end.]

        now, where does anarchy fit in?  alright, it's true that when the
 rich guys wrote the constitution, they were explicitly thinking about
 suppressing the poor ignorant farmers.  yeah, but the founding fathers were
 smart.  they knew that if the dumb workers got control of the government,
 chaos would ensue.  not only chaos, but ANARCHY, too.  and that's a hint;
 without control, selfishness breeds anarchy, EVIL anarchy: you know, war,
 death, famine.

        [the end.]

        so, am i saying that today's government is a-ok?  nope.  not at all.
 modern america pisses me off.  see, cause after the industrial revolution,
 the original form of american government that acted so well had been
 severely warped, until: you know, Vietnam, racial riots, the 80s.

        so, you say, what can be done?  unfortunately, i truly have no idea.
 cause, ironically, i definitely believe that anarchy and destruction of
 government COULD work.  not now, though.

        huh... if only mankind could be changed, changed so that restriction
 of a SELFISH people wasn't an issue.  but i've got lot's of time to think
 about a solution.  cause i'm a punk, and that's what punks do.
