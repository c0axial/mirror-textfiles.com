	Attention Class. We have a new student. Welcome #teen angst.

	Hi. Hows it going? I am ok. Aside from the fact that one of my
 friends is pissed off at me. Soap Opera time in #teen. Yes. It is a
 lovely event. Where masses of people can get involved in situations that
 don't involve them. All for the interest of what is happening. Taking
 sides, from either little information, or blatantly incorrect
 informations, and making statements about people with this information.

	You lost yet?

	Well, for the parties involved I will not even begin to explain this
 debauchery, but as that I am not involved in the situation, I did not
 expect to get hit. I thought I was immune as long as I stayed out of it,
 but I quickly over rushed my bounds when I saw something wrong, and it
 began.

	I was talking to a friend of mine. We will call him Snuffleupagus
 to withhold his real name. Now Snuffleupagus was talking to me. We were
 talking pretty fine, although i felt that Snuffleupagus was acting very
 weird. Snuffleupagus was acting very weird towards me in particular.
 Joking around I guess, but it wasn't really in the fun atmosphere that it
 usually is. It was limited to "Que is queer." and.. "He likes ass." So
 although it was kidding around.. and its just irc, I was not taking to
 kind of Snuffleupagus to "kid" around in the channel. It was basically
 annoying.

	So I was msging Snuffleupagus, and Snuffleupagus said that (we
 will refer to this person as Rydia) Rydia was a slut. Now Rydia is not a
 slut. That is not even just a gross misinterpretation of the situation.
 That is calling someone a name when you have no clue if it affects her. I
 am a friend of Rydias, so I immediately got shitty. So i retaliated
 poorly, and said this person is a slut, (a friend of Snuffleupagus's and
 hopefully still a friend of mine) and continued on..

	When one of my dearest friends was brought into the conversation I
 went on a giant rambling spree probably covering 5 pages. My friend....
 We will call her..... ummmm..... Matt Dillon. So when Snuffleupagus's
 friend (we will call her Sarah-Boo-Bara... Banana Fana Fo Fara)
 Sarah-Boo-Bara... Banana Fana Fo Fara called Matt Dillon a slut. I went
 off. I mean, Matt Dillon is not a slut. Matt Dillon is one of the coolest
 friends I have ever had. So then I just rambled.

	Sarah-Boo-Bara... Banana Fana Fo Fara should have known not to
 bring Matt Dillon up in this conversation, but did anyway to piss me off.
 Now I Love Matt Dillon. I love Matt Dillon a lot. So maybe I slightly
 over reacted when Sarah-Boo-Bara... Banana Fana Fo Fara insinuated that I
 thought Matt Dillon was a slut.

	Oh well, Snuffleupagus is still upset with me I think, but oh
 well. I worry about Snuffleupagus but it is Snuffleupagus's life to ruin
 Snuffleupagus's own way. I can't stop Snuffleupagus. I can only try and
 contain Snuffleupagus.

	Well, Matt Dillon, I think your a coolio friend. Rydia, I'm sorry
 that I added this, But it was needed in my opinion. Sarah-Boo-Bara...
 Banana Fana Fo Fara, I didn't mean you are a slut. I was upset, and
 Snuffleupagus, I hope we can go back to the way shit was.
