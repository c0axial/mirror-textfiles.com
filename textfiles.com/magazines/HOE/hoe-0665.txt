        I don't go to those ECT parties anymore.  The last one I went to, it
 was October.  There was one guy who I was sure would become a car salesman.
 He'd shaved his head.  It was his place.  His favorite chair was green.
 You could see how bad it smelled even when you couldn't smell it.  There
 was a ballgame on TV with the sound turned all the way down.  Somebody was
 playing some "New Wave".  Echo and the Bunnymen, or something.  There was a
 skinny girl with bad teeth.  You could tell just by looking at her that any
 chump foolish enough to marry her would have to work hard all his life.
 There were three tattoos in attendance at the ECT party, but I don't
 remember who had what tattoo, so the tattoos are, in my memory, split up
 among everyone there, including me, so we each had part of a tattoo.  The
 guy with the stereo- long, greasy hair- was obsessed with his future.  I
 had mentioned that I was going to college, and he jerked like a puppet.  He
 talked at me for half an hour about how he was thinking about going back to
 college and getting his degree.  He was thinking English, but you know he
 had always liked chemistry, he used to build bombs in high school.  Well,
 really, it was his friends who did most of the building, but still, it was
 cool.  He went on like that.  It was obvious he was scared.  He kept
 looking at me like I was going to kill him, and he wouldn't shut up.  If I
 was pointing a gun in his face he would've reacted the same way.  I didn't
 want to be rude to him.  Eventually I had to just tell him to shut up,
 though.  He kept moving his throat as if he was still talking, but he
 didn't say anything else; just kept making stupid fish faces.  It was OK,
 though.  That I could ignore.

        There wasn't nearly enough light in the room.  The guy whose
 apartment it was was just sitting there in that chair about two feet from
 the TV.  It was his idea to come back to his place so we could all check
 out his ECT thing.  He said it'd do us all a world of good, that it was
 even better than drugs for mind expansion.  Then he put the damn thing on
 and spaced out.  We didn't care that he was bogarting the thing, though.
 After seeing him, we kind of decided without saying anything that we didn't
 really want to try it out.  All I wanted was a goddamn beer, but I knew if
 I had one I'd fall asleep, and I sure as hell didn't want to be sleeping
 there.

        Anyway, I don't go to those ECT parties anymore.
