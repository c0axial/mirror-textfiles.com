        When I'm outside and I hear overlapping sirens, it reminds me of the
 time I watched myself commit suicide on television.

        As I brought the gun to my head and thought to myself "why not?", I
 saw myself onscreen tying the rope around my onscreen neck, thinking to my
 onscreen self "why not?".  At that precise moment I realized I would survive
 anyway so I pulled the trigger.  Why not?

        None of this is intended to imply that I watch television.  People
 that watch television are the type of people you wish would spend more time
 watching television and less time in front of you in line at the bank.  Of
 course, any cat will tell you that a warm television makes for a happy nap.
 That is, assuming cats talk to you.

        And that brings me to my point.  Cats talk if you listen.  You will
 understand them just as well as you understand your mother talking about her
 love of baseball or your mailman talking about how he hates his job.  You
 understand them only as far as what they say intertwines and embraces your
 life experiences.  So if their communication fucks you, then you comprehend.
 Otherwise it just leaves you wishing it fucked you, and, by extension,
 wishing for comprehension.  

        Understand?
