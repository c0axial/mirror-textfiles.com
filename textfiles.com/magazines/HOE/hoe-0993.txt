	Don't worry, this won't take too long.  After all, it would be
 very uncaring of me to waste your precious minutes with drivel like this.  
 Although, it is not puerility that I am worried about, it's
 superannuation.  Wisdom comes with Time and the draining of the sand.  
 Now build some sand castles before its gone.  Rake those designs, go
 ahead.

	Books cannot offer much except crude representations of what is
 locked in the mind, and royalty checks.  You know what is inside you.  Do
 marks on the page clear it up for you?

	I saw Language spinning the Wheel of Fortune the other day, and he
 hit Bankrupt and the lady from Wyoming ended up winning the yacht.  Half
 an hour later Alex Trebek was muttering something about the world's
 highest roller coaster, forgetting that mothers and daughters were
 screaming in delightful descent that very day.

	You could be out splashing in puddles right now.  Last I checked
 there is no drought.  Why then must there be scarcity of levity?

	Of course, philosophers argue that nobody accomplishes anything
 through happiness.  Go starve in the streets like the mangy dogs you are,
 you frivolous childish happy little petty people. Philosophers argue and
 therein is their indictment.  Excerpt from a philosopher's resume:
  
	EXPERIENCE
		Opposing positions disproved: 18

	Can't you graybeards and your sycophantic collegiate disciples say
 Yes for once?  Bend your necks up from those musty tomes and breathe a
 little life.  Trade that dust for a pail and a shovel.

		      -

	A lonely tear running in a rivulet
	Down a wrinkled cheek pooling in Despair
	No words comfort my lady anymore
	And death seems not an ending but repair
	Behind those eyes a hammer pounds on a
	Coffin nail and the ghost of Poe hovers silent
	And in front of those eyes everything
	Is bright and butter scotch and here a child
	And there a kitten and a puppy dancing and so
	My lady looks outside
