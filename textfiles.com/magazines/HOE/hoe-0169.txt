        I am selling all of my Pink Floyd rarities (commonly referred to as
 ROIOS in the bootlegging circle) and, to advertise, I posted a message on
 alt.music.pink-floyd.  My .sig has the URL to my homepage and the pictures
 of my sister on there caused quite a ruckus in the newsgroup!

        The following is the email I received from the guy who notified me of
 the situation.  My sister is now a hit in alt.music.pink-floyd.

        P.S. "ampf'ers" refers to "alt.music.pink-floyders."

         A few months back, amidst some crossposting, someone checked out
 your homepage. They reported that your sister was hot, despite her Goth
 obsession. (I am in concordance, BTW.) I think there was a thread regarding
 two guys fighting over who got her hand in marriage.

         Also, I checked out your writing compendium. There's some pretty
 funny shit in there. Glad to see a fellow smoker speaking out for DA HERB.

         Regards,
         RM
