        I stand near the window and gaze down at the street from the third
 floor of my apartment building.  I see others down below, shuffling,
 scuttling to and fro.

        Where are they going?  What are they doing?

        I shift between the weight on my legs and keep staring.  I see a
 baby and a mother.  Trying to subside the baby's shaking, the mother
 calmly places food near it's mouth.  It hungrily accepts.  Looking across
 the street from the pair, I notice a couple of adolescents harrassing an
 elder, trying to forcefully snatch away her purse, probably to get at
 some candy she might be hiding away in it's contents.

        I get nervous and begin pacing about my apartment, thinking
 intensely on what to do.  I scurry over to the counter and lift some
 sugar cubes from a bowl.  A sugar cube is always most refreshing on hot
 days like this.  Others say that it's not good to eat what you have on
 hot days, because thats when the people are usually out and about, and
 it's most difficult to get any food with so many of them around.  That's
 not always the case, though.  My friends tell me of the ones at the old
 folks homes.  There you can get plenty of food, as much as you want.  The
 people there rarely, if ever, see you around.  If they do see you,
 usually they can't catch you.  I hear it's easy life.  But not for me.
 The city is tough living, let me tell you.  You never know when you'll
 eat, or even if you eat.  It's tough living.

        I suppose you'd like to hear about one of my kids.  Well, he isn't
 much different from me, I suppose.  Look's more like his mother, however.
 Big mouth, beady eyes.  Same legs.  Same teeth.  Why, you'd swear he was a
 beetle if you saw him.

        Once, I remember he came in the apartment through the window.
 Well, I was so awestruck, since it'd only been a few nights since he'd
 even walked out of the room.  I asked him, "what in boonhilly were you
 doing out there in the cold?  ain't you got no sense?" Well.  He just
 looked at me with those beady eyes.  Staring.  Then he flashed me with the
 jelly bean he had in his mouth.  I damn near shit a brick! My own kid,
 finding jelly beans before his legs were even firm.  I was so proud.
 Just then, the phone rings, breaking me from my momentary remembrance.
 I run away from the noise and hide.  Dumb people.  Always calling, talking
 on the phone.  Can't they just shut up for once?  I pace about in the
 bathroom for a bit, chewing my sugar cube.  Oh, damnit, I nearly forgot.
 I was supposed to go with my friends down near the Hotel.  Damnit.  I grab
 a piece of chocolate on the way out and run as fast as I can down the
 hall and meet up with my friends.  They've been waiting.  Just as I
 arrive, one of them speaks to me.

        "Where've you been maaaaa ---"

        A look of terror crosses his face.

        "What?  What's wrong?" I ask, puzzled.

        He says nothing, seemingly frozen in place and time.

        "What?"

        I turn around.

        "Oh.  My.  Oh.  My." I babble, futily trying to make a complete
 phrase.  At once, as if linked, we scream in unison.

        "RAAAAAAAAID."

        Press.  Spray.  Boom.
