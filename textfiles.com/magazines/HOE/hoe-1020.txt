     $$  $$ "TssT" "TssT"

  	we picked up ed from cabrini green, the north side chicago housing
 project that was featured in the horror movie "Candyman". he was bleeding
 from his leg.

  	"Ed, you're bleeding."
  	"Yes, kids throw rocks."
	to save time i'll paraphrase and try to convey the dissociative
 logic you would be immersed in if you were one of the people he
 considered friends with whom he would graciously punctuate interactions
 with mind-ripping ideas and extreme physical violence- two forms of the
 ed distillate.
  	first of all, there was a dumb bitch at work. but she was cute. so
 he told her that if she would shut her mouth/cunt and stop being such a
 dumb bitch, she would be a nicer person. he told her what: he'll go to
 fuckin cabrini green right now and get a door so she can shut up her cunt
 with it. he leaves work and walks twenty-five blocks to cabrini green to
 find a door.
  	he sees some kids. five of them. around ten years old. he tells
 them that he will come back tomorrow and teach them how to make bombs if
 they will find a door for him for this woman. they search around and all
 they find is an old tire- he says it will do and tells them to meet him
 back here the next day at the same time and he will teach them how to
 make bombs.
  	he brings the tire back to work and slams it on her desk.
  	next day, an hour before i've picked him up, he goes to cabrini
 green and the kids are there. he's brought pagers and estes model rocket
 engines.  crack open the cement caps on the engines to get the
 blackpowder. then hooks up the pager electronics to make a spark and
 calls the pager from afar. kaboom.
  	older kids throw rocks at ed from a window and tell him to stay
 the fuck outta the projects. he heads in to find them and beat the shit
 out of them, but can't find them. then he gets into my car.
  	Ed's beauty, in his own words:

    This world is so wicked, Marc. I was looking at Salvador Dali's pictures
    this afternoon. Then I was betrayed in the evening. And arrested the
    following morning. Dali just wanted to be himself. His pictures told me
    so. I have never seen them before in my life so close and so real. I
    KNOW what they were thinking while making that. Do you want to know? We
    should go there together sometime....

  	we go back to his place. there's some guy working on electronics
 there. ed shows me his MDT intercepting projects. mobile data terminals
 that the cops use in their cars to run plates, check backgrounds, etc. he
 shows me logs of the cops talking about him: "that crazy russian who
 takes too much cough medicine". he tells me about two weeks ago when he
 was left unattended in a local precinct interrogation room with a police
 radio extender. he made that police station his bitch with a panicked
 "shots fired, officer down, corner of 17th and racine". i ask him if he
 wrote the MDT code himself- he responds by punching me in the nose. i am
 bleeding. he says what the fuck do i think.  i apologize.
 
  	while we're on the subject of crazy russian anarchist manifestos,
 here is a picture of ed raping my mind with his razor barbed meta-cock:

    Random acts of kindness mixed with random acts of disgrace rather than a
    continuous contribution to the amount that you think will free you. It is
    always the third party unsuspecting, but executing someone else's
    instruction. stepping only in the certain direction because that was the
    only direction that was let free? Instead of "let me go" try "let me go
    where I want to". Because there is always a clause as long as you open
    your mouth. But sometimes when you keep your mouth shut you wonder- where
    is the applause?! ...

    Gweeds. I can not believe  this world. So  much betrayal and so much
    censorship. So much women for such little men. So much men for such
    little women... What is up " friend"-  will you let the faggots  know
    this? I am gonna print out  copies because I am sick and so  tired of
    censorship. Before I start doing this bare handed - give me a call. I
    saw Bruce Lee again in my dreams. You know what that means? You are
    sleeping on my pillow again. Wake up fucker:).
 
	thanks to ed, the earth now has an idea of what a straight version
 of henry rollins might sound like. also: anarchy.
