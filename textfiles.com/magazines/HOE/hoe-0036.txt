                          This is NOT Chapter I
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        The thunder crushed across the morning sky and the tale of armageddon
 was to unravel.  Daylight gave way to the caress of darkness, and lightning
 dragged it's talons through the cities.  Humanity was holding itself
 together by a single thread of hope that all would end.  The children
 amassed to wonder what would save their pathetic lives from the ruin that
 had been swept on them so fast and forceful.  The edlers gathered together
 for protection.  The junction of time and space was under siege by a
 horrible force, the force of hypocracy unleashed.  It inhabited all things
 around it, it began to assimilate itself.  It not only tore at it's flesh
 from both ends, but it ate at itself from the very core.  It ate at it's
 young heart and it died a slow painful death that would mean ruin of the 
 age of man.  


        It came at once.  Entropy was born.


        Entropy was the force that pulled us all toward our dying day.  
 Anything random, anything that seperated, anything that had it's own
 tendancy to move away from order was Entropy.  The human race had become 
 Entropy's favorite pet and so set upon the land of the dying race.


        It began devouring one of the very things that which all people 
 held dear - security.  The waves of trust ripped and tore at each other as
 it forced people to stop thinking.  Homes, Buildings, Cities, Countries
 imploded and melted away as Entropy took hold with an icy, demonic grip.
 The fabric of reality as we know it was fraying at it's edges.
 It was all child's play.  It was all too easy.


        Alas, there was one sliver of hope the world had left to prevent  
 this genocidal erasure of humanity from the tyranical greed that was
 Entropy.  It was the Hog. And it was from the great pools of life that the
 dawning of the Hog was to come.  It was a happening of random, beautiful
 pure randomness.  The Hog, knowing this randomness was to go forth, and
 bring the wisdom to the outsiders.  In the days of the Hog's youth he
 traveled to the edges of the Earth, silently observing the predictability,
 and knowing it to be false. True, he appeared a simple Hog, but not so, 
 for he was an extraordinary example of the evolution of disorder.  A
 perfect glitch.


        It was in this chance consummate purity that he reveled.  The people
 of the third star from the Sun were to be taught well this deterioration
 of uniformity, and the task was at hand. The Hog set out at day break on 
 the fateful day, known thereafter as The Day of The Awakening, and came 
 upon a prime subject for teaching.  
 

        Alas, the Hog's judge of character was not as broad as his 
 knowledge, and he was remanded to perform in a circus side show as "Harpo, 
 The Talking Pig."  After his refusal to speak, he was sold to Pigman's 
 Bar-B-Q of Rodanthe, North Carolina where he was to be held as a mascot.
 The owner, captivated by the enlightenment bestowed upon him by the Hog 
 and after many bottles of stout ale, set the mighty Hog free.  It was 
 here that his sidetracked, but nevertheless majestic voyage was to truly 
 begin. 



                      This is not Chapter One Either
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        Entropy's only glitch was the Hog, and the Hog's only glitch was
 the devil Entropy.  They were the same, spawned from one another and
 yet they were of opposite threads.  Entropy, the seething hypocritical
 materialization of mankind's darkest traits, and the Hog, it's hunger
 for knowledge, and respect for balance. The were like brothers and yet
 they would tear each other apart at the slightest opportunity.
 They were cosmic rivals with powers unmatched.


        The Great Hog was to give his benevolent gift to humanity and thus
 he was immediatly sucked into a loophole, a vacuum, and teleported to the
 darkest, most vile patch of earth.  It was here the bringer of the darkness
 waited to slaughter it's brother.  The Hog was planted firmly in New York's
 Central Park.


        The park began to fill with the society's most destructive freaks,
 all under the control of Entropy.  They gathered around the Hog and
 prepared to begin a mighty clash against the Great Hog of Randomness.
 These outcasts were no petty criminals, they were armed with information,
 albeit sometimes erroneous, and chatter was heard in the crowd...
 "Hey, I have this great file on how to make a Draino bong!  We could use
 that!"  "No man, it's a Draino bomb!  Not bong - a bomb!"  "Yeah, well I
 have a file one of them too.."  The battle lasted mere seconds as the
 Hog merely spoke to them his words of wisdom.  The Hog has grown more
 powerful and more wiser the longer he lived apart from his vile brother.


        Each man was scarred with an insigna by the Hog as each collapsed
 from such a sudden burst of knowledge.  Life.  It was all so obvious, and
 these mortals had never realized it.  Each of their arms now read:


        Ride the Wave of Evil. Use it for Good.  Be a Hog of...
                        .
                        :

                     :
                     :
                     
        And from this band of hoodlums, thieves, vandals, explorers, and
 mercenaries came the first wave of the Great Hog's Disciples.  They
 latched onto the Hope and the Wisdom that the Hog taught them.  They rode
 the wave and they were almost truly free.



                               Almost.  




           We are Almost at Chapter one Now, So Be Patient
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        Entropy could not stand the worship and respect of anything...
 Especially not Logic and Wisdom.  Those were deadly forces that could not
 be trifled with as easily.  He immediatly delved into all taps of power,
 randomness, and breakdown at his command and blasted it at the Hog.
 

        The Hog, being the very soul brother of Entropy was attacked on two
 fronts.  The first being the sheer outer power of force ripping at the
 Hog's logical existance... the second more important being the inner
 conflict.  Any great true power can only be completly destroyed from the 
 inside.  The shards of inate logical magic that both entities possessed
 began to battle viciously at each other.  The world shook like an
 earthquake.

        The Perfect Glitch that has laid the path for Humanity's creation,
 and possible destruction was the object of the conflict.  It's was a
 complete paradox that was imploding on itself to eventually come up with
 a final, undefinable answer.  Entropy was destruction through total
 randomness.  The Great Hog was the creation of something better through
 randomness.  It was a logic that could not be settled peacefully.

 
        The sheer lust for destruction that Entropy wished on the Great
 Hog was enough, however, to do the last final blow.  The Great Insult of 
 Existance was cast onto the great Hog through pure self dread and ended the
 life of the Great Hog.  His head was completely obliterated and there was
 a moment of silence which seemed to last for days.


        But Entropy had still failed.  The Wisdom was passed quickly to the
 instant mortal disciples who knew they must propogate the Hog...for the Hog
 was not control.  The Hog was freedom through the true perfect glitch that
 was Entropy and Logic simultaneously.

                                            is the NON-Worship of anything.

        The Great Hogs final words to his children were this:

    "They will be the Hogs of Entropy, and they will ride the oceanic 
waves of randomality until the world has been completely pulled to a final 
future through means of man or means of nature or both and the final fate 
is still being written."


                             Now for Chapter One.
