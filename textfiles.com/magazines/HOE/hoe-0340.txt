        Underground Gonzo journalist TPP here in my first HoE release
 since the infamous unreleased article on extracting DMT from a human
 brain.  Recently, I was reading the local University Newspaper, when I
 noticed an article so stupid and devoid of common sense that I had to
 respond.  Here is the article followed by my response.

 "Doing Drugs Can Cost Students Their Futures"
 by Kenya Johnson

	There is a deadly war going on: the war on drugs. 

        Drugs destroy families, deter dreams, scar innocent childhoods
 and systematically trap people. If you turn to drugs there is the
 possibility that you may never recover. Whatever happened in your life
 that made you turn to drugs, the use of drugs always makes the
 situation worse.

	No matter what it may be:  alcohol, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy or
 household cleaning products -- they can be deadly when they are abused. A
 lot of us use drugs to impress others or to feel accepted. Even though
 sometimes friends say that they don't want to influence you by their drug
 use, they aren't satisfied until you use drugs, too. If you feel that the
 only way you can be accepted is by abusing your body, then you don't know
 what acceptance is. 

	Whether it be the initiation to join a fraternity or sorority or
 maybe your idea of having a good time, you're playing with something that
 you only have one chance at: life. 

	Some use drugs and decide that they will never use them again. 

	Then there are others. 

	They may have been told they would never amount to anything ever
 since they were born. Prove those that ridiculed you wrong. Not by
 getting high, but by choosing to take the high road in life. Choose the
 high road by setting an example to the younger generation that watches
 everything that you do, whether you know it or not. 

        I can't speak from experience because I have never tried drugs.
 I had a normal childhood and represented the letter 's' in spoiled,
 which makes me the most vulnerable. We tend to stereotype people from
 urban areas or poorer households, but drug use is prevalent from the
 suburbs to the ghettos. 

        No one knows what will happen to them in their lives. Whether
 it be the tragic loss of a dear one, a devastating breakup or simply
 the road of life seems to be at a dead end, don't turn to drugs. 

	Drugs are used as a type of release from reality. When you are
 high you feel like all of your troubles are beneath you. The hardest
 part about getting high is the coming down process. Then you realize
 that you are in the same predicament that you were in before you chose
 to get high. Only now you're feeling worse because you realize that
 you may be hooked on something that only lasts a moment but can change
 your life forever.

        If you become addicted to drugs you risk losing everything:
 your job, family and most importantly your dignity. There is always the
 possibility of recovery. And that's all it is -- a possibility. There
 are no guarantees when you decide to let drugs determine your fate. 

        As you look at the world around you, it is factual that people
 who are under the influence of drugs commit the most violent crimes.
 People are rational but become irrational when they are under the
 influence of drugs. You will do anything to get high, and will hurt
 anyone that tries to get in your way. 

	There are some that argue that they can handle getting high and
 that they won't get hooked. I hope that they never do. Usually these are
 the people that you would least suspect. They get high on weekends and on
 special occasions such as birthdays and holidays. But it's also important
 to remember that no one starts out being a drug addict. Over time your
 body becomes accustomed and will crave drugs. 

        I'm not an expert, but I don't have to be to know that taking
 drugs simply isn't the answer. If you feel like you have to get high to
 make it through the day, ask yourself if it's really worth it. Whenever I
 have second doubts I always tell myself that it's not worth it if I can't
 look at myself in the mirror. 

        You can't blame it on the government or drug dealers. Drugs
 wouldn't be sold if there wasn't a demand. Usually the people that sell
 the drugs are in it for the money and nothing else. They may even
 consider it their own business. 

	Until we chose to put them out of business they will continue to
 make economic profits that may cost you your future.

 "Johnson Drug Column Offensive to Users"
 by [TPP]

        As a drug user, I was personally offended by Kendra Johnson's
 attack on drug users. It is just another symptom of the continuing
 perpetuation of procrastination and/or calcitration of the man's
 conspir-a-cee. 

        After all, how many drug fiends are on the Forbes top 400? So
 I'll tell you what I am going to do. I'm gonna take the people's
 blotter, I'm gonna put it on the people's tongue, I'm gonna take the
 people's trip and lay the smack down. I got four words for Kendra:
 Flush out your head. That D.A.R.E. propaganda you regurgitated has no
 basis in fact. I'll take Dr. Timothy Leary's advice over that of
 weak-minded, uneducated fools.

        You sit there and write about something you admit you know
 nothing about. How is that different from the stereotyping you seem to
 be against?  Well, I know from personal experience what drugs are like. 

        Back in high school, I smoked marijuana daily for an entire
 school year. Then one day I decided I didn't like it anymore and quit.
 Just like that, without even thinking about it, without having to “get
 help.” About a year later, I stumbled across some mushrooms. I was
 never really into high school and spent my studying time learning about
 computers and other topics of interest. I rarely did homework and my
 grade point average was in the range 1.5-2.0. 

	Shortly after that first trip, my GPA skyrocketed to the 3.0-4.0
 range. It made me realize that I would need a college degree to get a
 decent job and have a future. Later trips convinced me to start working
 out and now I am in perfect shape. 

	Despite what you may have seen in those grade school drug
 propaganda films, I have never had the urge to jump out a window, find
 a rape victim, stare at the sun or knife my family to death. 

	As far as addiction goes, it is a joke. Nicotine is far more
 addictive than any illegal drug. I know ex-smackheads who can't stop
 smoking. Addiction is only an excuse for not wanting to quit. As for
 “coming down, this happens on very few drugs and is no big deal. It is
 far more pleasant than any alcohol hangover I have had. 

        I have not done any drugs in awhile and feel no urge to take
 them. 

        I have gone through these periods several times in my life
 without any problems. My use of psychedelic drugs has been an entirely
 positive experience. If it wasn't for them, I would not have been able
 to get into college. Instead, I would be working at some nasty,
 minimum-wage job for the rest of my life. 

        Mrs. Johnson, I suggest that until you have a clue what it is
 that you are talking about: Know your role, and shut your damn mouth!
