        Another thrilling night out at Perkins with the Dubuque, Iowa
 elite crew.  We were putting 319 on the map, baby.  Josh, Steve (M4D 3LF),
 and I dumped the Pokemon out onto the table and began hitting them
 maniacally with Pokeballs.  The fat Pikachu wouldn't fall over!!!!
 ARRRGH!!!  Josh randomly spit his coffee all over the table and managed
 to throw Poliwhirl into my cup of coffee.  Little children flocked to our
 table to watch us play.  Alas, our time had to end; there were greater
 adventures awaiting us, on the other side of the rainbow.

        We sit around Steve's empty basement, staring at the Apple color
 monitor corded up to the VCR crackheadedly watching Pokemon reruns.  Ash
 and Pikachu are searching for firewood in the forest, and Ash calls out,
 "Here, firewood firewood firewood."  Oh man.  That was a kneeslapper,
 baby.  I LOVE THAT SHIT, BABY!!!

        Josh wondered the night before if he could join h0e.  I told him
 he had to WRITE THINGS.  Of course, that would be easier if he had a
 computer, or even regular access to one.  He pulled out a psychotically
 deluded poem a la Shel Silverstien, and I applauded his efforts.  I gave
 him Ziego's address, which, naturally, I carry with me in my pocket,
 right next to my Pikachu.  I told him I could hook him up.  Then he asked
 me if I could lend him $150 so he wouldn't be homeless.

        Josh checked out Meenk's profile on Steve's laptop.  He thought
 she was pretty hot.  I told him to beware, she was one of those goth
 chicks.  He smiled, that goofy smile he has.  Smiling always looks silly
 on a face with no eyebrows.  Hell, he hadn't even bothered to draw in any
 tonight.

        Steve was happy, he finally got himself h00k3d uP with a h0e
 profile.  And, look, he had a file released.  And so did I.

        WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!

        I was all bitchy.  Come to find out today, it was just PMS.  Man,
 PMS sucks.  I mean, REAL PMS, not that pretend fake PMS that comes in a
 yellow box with black letters that women with mental problems pretend to
 have for 3 weeks a month.  Still, even in my momentary insanity, I stayed
 cool.  I was CHILLIN.

        I went to work on one hour of sleep.  Josh starts working with me
 on Saturday.  Mike, at work, was asking me if he should write for h0e.  I
 told him I didn't care, just as long as if he sucked, he didn't associate
 me with his stupid ass.  He was smiling as I once again reached past my
 Pikachu for Ziego's address.  I suddenly envisioned myself in a purple
 zoot suit.  Or if nothing else, my *purple nigger* shirt.  Oh man.
 Nothing names a shirt better than watching PBS specials about people with
 tourette's syndrome who start chanting that familiar phrase when a
 gigantically enormous black guy in a purple sweater enters that branch of
 her local bank.

        *INSERT LUST-RIDDEN SIGH*

        We had four people in the drive-thru ask for Whoppers today.  This
 is usually a bi-monthly occurrence or so; I concluded some evil forces of
 stupidity were randomly smacking our menu boards as to cause extreme
 havoc on the other side of the headsets.  Nobody yelled at me today.  My
 co-workers and I all agreed that second-hand sex toys were to be avoided.

        Once home, I was going to sleep, but the fun never ends in Dubuque.
 Steve assumed I really was going to try and catch up on some sleep.  Silly
 mortal.  Josh called me to come over and make a Vampire character for
 Saturday's game.  I was sleepy.  I decided to sleep after all.

        IT RAINED A LOT AND IT WAS WET EVERYWHERE AND IT WAS SCARY WHEN I
 SLID DOWN THE HILLLLLLLLLL

        Josh was really fucking sick.  We sat around bullshitting for a
 bunch of hours.  He looked like he was recovering from two black eyes.  I
 didn't make that character because my brain wasn't working right from
 lack of sleep and his ancient stack of MAD magazines were utterly
 fascinating me.  I commented to Josh that I was glad he had a girlfriend,
 because then I felt much more comfortable knowing we had a non-sexual
 relationship.  It was beautiful; tears rushed to my eyes and flooded the
 room.  Or maybe they didn't.  I don't remember all too well anymore.  It
 might have just been a cat rushing to my eyes.  There are three of them,
 you know.

        I'm really tired.  I smile, all docile and somewhat stupidly, and
 wonder if my brother would mind if I submitted his journal entries as a
 super de dooper killer t-file.  I like the part when he says that he can
 talk to me about his problems because he has no fear of me telling other
 people, because I am a loser and I have no friends.  Well, you know what
 I have to say about THAT.

        Pi.....  Ka.......  CHUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
