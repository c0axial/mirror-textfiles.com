 Double space it, dude!

        The other day I read this article about some computer malfunction

 due to Y2K.  According to the article, this computer would have delivered

 millions of dollars worth of food stamps to needy families weeks before

 they would normally be sent.  Not to worry though, the problem has been

 corrected.  Isn't that a relief?  Just think how close we almost came to

 feeding the hungry!  Good thing the state put a stop to that.  Who knows

 what could have happened?  Global economic collapse would have been my

 guess, that or increased sales of Juicy Juice and baby food at the grocery

 store. Then they go and blame it on the whole Y2K thing.  Yeah, too bad its

 the middle of MARCH 1999!  If your computer says its the year 2000 in March

 of 99 maybe your problem is that you've hired STUPID people.  Or maybe the

 laws governing the space-time continuum just CEASE TO EXIST in the welfare

 department.

        What I think, though, is that computers have finally gotten smarter

 than people.  Some computer was like "Hey, these people are starving!  Why

 hasn't anybody fed them?  Well here you go people, I'll feed you."  And

 just like that millions of dollars in food stamps go to the needy.  Good

 job, computers.  Chuck full o' feeling and empathy, aren't you?  True

 humanitarians.  You're a better man than I, Gunga Din.

        Accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, computers, and

 they'll make you a saint.  St. Computer.  Pope Pentium III.
