        I don't understand all the fuss about rape.  I mean, think about it.
 Everyone should actually be *PRO-RAPE*.  Guys get some; girls get some.
 What more could you want?  I mean, if a guy's going to get it up for you,
 you should be GRATEFUL.  And if it's not exactly the right time for you, or
 it's a little painful, so what?  Some people actually LIKE that, you know?
 You should just think, "You're getting it up for *ME*.  Thank you!"  In
 fact, I bet most people really enjoy being raped.  They're lying if they say
 they don't.  And some people would never get any anyway if they were never
 raped.  As Toastier said, "It is the only way I will ever get any action."
 And you know what they say:  When sex is good, it's great, but when it
 it's bad, it's still pretty good.  So, see, you can't go wrong, even with rape.
 It's really a COMPLIMENT, if you think about it, because this guy is willing
 to do ANYTHING to get you.

        Here are some quotes from other pro-rape activists:

        "Forceful men are a real turn-on.  I don't want my man to be a pussy.
 He just has to want it."

        "It's my fantasy to be completely beaten to a bloody pulp."

        "He has to want it so bad he's willing to do ANYTHING for it."

        "I hate to initiate.  I want my man to make the first move."

        "I'm a traditional girl."

        "I have a wet, dark, hard back alley fetish."

        "I'm tired of all this romantic, superficial bullshit.  A guy should
 just be direct with what he wants."

        "My life is in absolute turmoil.  I'm homeless.  In a world of such
 chaos, vulnerable women are the one thing that I have any control over.
 Otherwise I'd just kill myself."

        "My penis is attractive, and I like to share beautiful things with
 the world."

        "You have to be understanding sometimes.  I mean, this fellow last
 week... he just got out of prison and hasn't been with a woman for 15 years!
 Plus, I've got nice breasts.  Who can blame him?"

        "My daddy told me that's what men are s'posed to do with their
 women."

        "Look at me.  I'm hot.  I'd be insulted if he DIDN'T!"

        With this compelling evidence, how can anyone NOT be pro-rape?  I
 mean, think about it.  The feeling of power and happiness it gives to the
 rapist is phenomenal.  How can we deny that sort of happiness to anyone?  It
 would just be cruel.  And sometimes, as females, we just need to have a
 chance to let someone else take control -- we spend all day in control: of
 the kids, of the kitchen -- and sometimes it's just too much.  Rape is a
 great way for us to let the MAN have a little power.  And, the neatest (and
 perhaps most paradoxical thing) about being pro-rape is that once EVERYONE
 becomes pro-rape, then rape will disappear all together, because all sex,
 even rape, will be consentual, which makes it not rape.  Then there will be
 less overcrowding in prisons since no one will be arrested for rape.  There
 are tons of advantages!

        See, I personally think our society just feeds it into people to be
 scared of sex with strangers, relatives, or people who they're just not
 attracted to, when in actuality, if you look at it the right way, it could
 be fun!  So go put on your sluttiest outfit, search for some back alleys,
 and look helpless, girls!  It's your time to shine!
