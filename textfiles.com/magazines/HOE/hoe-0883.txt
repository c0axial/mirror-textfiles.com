        cold.  a dark world.  blank.  my head, heart, soul, entire, self.
 empty.  i want to go to the ball.  will you take me?  i wish for feelings
 that transcend.  time and.  everything.  the blackness takes over!
 disposing of all.  that means.  something.  everything (to me).

        their stare, sharp and mean dabs away at my brain.  it hurts a
 little, kind of.  i want to remain secret, yet shout it out.  it makes me
 sad.  sad, sad, sad!  she has all she needs, but she is sad.  silly, girl.
 greedy, greedy, greedy little girl!  don't take things for granted.  never
 steal.  but then, how will i get what i desire from people unwilling to
 provide it for me?  silly girl, find the ones who are!  silly narrator, you
 don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  do not swear.  i will never
 do it again, i swear.

        deep.  thoughts rushing.  mean.  entities disturbing.  my sleep.
 voices, all mine.  but i really just have one.  souls burning within.  the
 little hell that resides in my heater.  warming my room.  waiting for my
 turn to stand up and yell obsceneties at the world.  a collective FUCK YOU
 on the part of all my different selves.  releasing my metaphorical penis for
 the world to suck.

        can you hear what i am thinking?  can you sense my rage and
 frustration despite the silliness and smiles?  can you really say that you
 know how i feel?  no!  i am all that is not you!  and you, my precious
 little fuckhead, are a liar.  how can all that has not been, and will
 probably never be, torment me so, my darling asswipe?  lead me on & i will
 use you until i have emptied every last bit of all you have.  i will steal
 all that is yours and swear to laugh at you.

        i am laughing at you.
        can.  you.  hear.  it?
        have you gone into hysterics yet,
        my sweet dickwad?
        i am laughing at you.

        heehee.
