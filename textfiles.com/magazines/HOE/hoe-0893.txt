        I was Somewhat Damaged after The Day The World Went Away.  The Frail 
 emotional sructure that I had built within myself has become The Wretched 
 sorry I lied, please forgive me person I am today.  We're In This Together
 to make it all just go away.  The Fragile fragments of our lives is Just
 Like You Imagined, only, it's Even Deeper than either one of us could have
 ever expected.  I miss our first Pilgrimage into the great unknown.  No, You
 Don't care anymore La Mer!  I will watch it all from above you, as you fall
 into The Great Below.

        The Way Out Is Through the veil of your dreams.  Into The Void like a
 great crashing wave.  Where Is Everybody?  All the people I knew?  The Mark
 Has Been Made, Please, can you spare any change?  I never knew that working
 for you at Starfuckers, Inc. would turn out like this.  The fucking
 Complication of buisness and pleasure certainly don't mix.  I pressed the
 button, now it will all go away.  I'm Looking Forward To Joining You,
 Finally.  I forgot your name, and where you came from, but damn, your shit
 is good, the more drugs you bring, the louder I'll sing before The Big Come
 Down.  And still I say Underneath It All, I'm just a wore out old junky who
 is Ripe(With Decay)
