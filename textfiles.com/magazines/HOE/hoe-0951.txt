              RANDY SAVAGE AND INGMAR BERGMAN HAVE PROCLAIMED
               "LIMITATIONS MAKE BRILLIANCE!!! OHHH YHEA!!!"

	On those DARK, nice, EVIL, beautiful, SWEET nights, I can't help
 but think to myself that I'm thinking to myself about my thoughts and
 those thoughts are completely thought-related and intensely thoughtful in
 regards to the thoughts themselves, and not the thoughts in some
 abstract, irrelevant context.
	You can talk to me, but I can't talk to you.  I'm talking to
 myself.  You're talking to yourself.  You're reading an arrangement of 98
 possible ascii characters and holy shit, does it feel good!  It feels
 good for me and it feels good for you.
   READ IT OUT LOUD        BECAUSE YOU CAN'T                 GET THE VOICE
       OUT OUT OUT OF        YOUR HEAD, IT'S TOO       SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT
        YOUR VOICE BOX        SMASHED AND BREAKABLE       A PROSTATE GLAND
             CALLS OUT TO ME SOMETIMES          THAT COULD SKIN A CAT
                                  I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
        get a looooooooooooooooooooooooong 
              tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuube
          and stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick
     it up my butttttttttttttttttttttttttt   (HeHeHe!)
        so that i can really, truly, really, truly, really truly,
                            really, truly, really, truly, really, truly,
                                 really, truly, really, truly, really,
                                               fart.   (Hehehe!)
 	this is not a cry for help, it's a cry for tears.  tears of paper
 that cut my fingers, paper-thin, ripped, torn, wet, and
                                                        if you ever think
                                                      about the potential 
                                              emotional range of a person
                                                   and stop acting within
                                               the range of a small child
                                                        you would realize

                                                       who fucking cares?

        the            bullets              have             failed
        ifs              there             ain't                 no

                          i've made a model for you.
                             this ain't one way.
                     i used to write ascii that insulted.
                                  it ain't

                                  using the

                                    much

                     over-expression means repression
                     over-statement means
                                   you're untalented.
