        When I was a little girl, I had no friends.  I had nobody to play
 with, nobody to tell all my secrets.  But when I was four or five years old,
 a very special person came into my life.  She was my best friend, the friend
 who was always at my side, through good times and bad; she was my imaginary
 friend, Irma.

        Irma taught me the importance of friendship, and I've never forgotten
 that.  I think real friendship is about the most valuable thing there is,
 and I would do anything for my friends.

        Irma accepted me exactly as I was.  She was pretty and smart and
 nice, and very confident.  She was everything I knew I would never be.  She
 wasn't even afraid of adults.  We would play together by ourselves for hours
 and hours.  We would play with my dolls and we would dress up in mom's
 clothes.  We never, ever had a single fight, and we trusted each other with
 our most important secrets.  My mom and dad thought Irma was really cute,
 and they let her live with me in my room.  Mom would even set a place for
 her at the dinner table.

        But sometimes Irma could be very silly.  Once, I remember, she went
 into daddy's wallet when he was fast asleep and took $30.  Then she hid the
 money under my mattress.  I told my mom that my invisible friend, Irma, had
 taken the money, but Mom didn't believe me.  She yelled at me alot.  Irma
 got real mad when Mom said she wasn't real, so she collected all these dead
 spiders and cockroaches and put them in Mom's shoes.  Mom sure was angry
 when she found them.  Irma and I laughed and laughed.

        Irma was my best friend in the whole wide world.  We went everywhere
 together.  I took her to birthday parties even though she was never invited.
 She went to school with me and during tests she would peek at my neighbor's
 paper and whisper the answers to me.  And she always protected me just a
 like a best friend should.  Like there was this boy in my school who was
 always teasing me.  So one day, Irma tripped him and he fell down two
 flights of steps.

        Irma and I always had so much fun together.  When I got older, I
 started going out with boys.  Irma didn't mind, she just wanted me to be
 happy.  And if a boy I liked didn't like me, Irma would go to his house at
 night and scratch his parent's car.  When one boy was really mean to me and
 called me names, Irma tried to set fire to his house.  I don't think anybody
 ever had such a good friend.

        When I went to see Dr. Shaw for my headaches, he told me that Irma
 was "a little crazy," and that I should make her go away.  But I knew that
 that was not how really close friends treat each other.  Real friendship
 means sticking by someone even when they do something you don't like.  And
 I'll bet anything that Dr. Shaw stopped thinking that when Irma "fixed" the
 brakes on his car.  But I guess no one will ever know what he was thinking
 all the way down that hill.

        When Bobby and I decided to get married, I was afraid Irma would be
 jealous, but she wasn't, she was really happy for me.  I told Bobby about
 her right away.  I thought Bobby might want her to move out, but he didn't;
 mostly he just pretended she wasn't even there.

        Lately though, Bobby and Irma have become real ggod friends.  In
 fact, at night sometimes, Bobby gets all dressed up and tells me, "I'm
 going to take Irma out for a few hours."  And then sometimes they stay out
 all night.

        It makes me sad that they leave me out all night, but I don't
 complain.  If I was jealous of Irma, I wouldn't really be a very good
 friend.  Besides, when Bobby goes out with Irma, my new imaginary friend
 comes to visit.  His name is Ted.  And he works in the brake repair shop.
 I think Bobby is going to meet Ted soon.
