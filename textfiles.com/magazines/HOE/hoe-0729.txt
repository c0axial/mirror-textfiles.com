 Good morning, my brothers.
   Allow me to introduce myself.
     I'm the fucking eternal buzz in your ear -- making you restless and
     pushing you on the road.
  (someone shut that radio off)
   Time again to take a blade to my face
   Time to cut the grass
      mother, I used my milk money to buy marijuana...
      ("son of a bitch." she replied)
  Oh well,
   Orwell never saw this shit coming
     you're so scared you try running
       where ya gonna run to, friend?
            "What a fine night for things not to be finite ..."
 even the most sacred times
 have turned into nothing more
 than wild pricetags with barcodes
 [you think you're free? Not to me]
  (radiation cube to pacify.  God isn't dead.  He's trapped in a dollar
  sign!)
  Hey man,
  I got no plan,
  I'm just trying to get Ed-Jew-Kay-Ted
         know thyself.
           trust thyself.
             kill thyself.
 she stepped through the doorway and into the fire
 Alone and desperate -- and content
 maybe she didn't even realize it
 ... i'm being optimistic
 then, without even the slightest indication,
 she left.
 never to see me again
 she said she was going to "chase the moon"
 of course she knew she'd never catch it
 but that didn't stop her
 it never stops any of us.
   (I can hardly hear it now)
         no paper?  try credit.
           discredit and damn it
             track your ass all over the fucking planet.
   (she showed me that what we preach so highly is what we lack the most)
 I'm both
 I'm neither
 I'm all and nothing.
 ... we turn into some bizarre, image conveying drones
 and twist our faces in unnatural smiles.  Where's the hard truth?
 "The point of the game ain't winning.  It's just to fail to lose."
          Bless the individual who embraces the hard truth!
 Let's fit everything into specific categories, little boxes that things
 fit nicely into, (including you)
 boxes on top of boxes, things enclosed by walls,
 sanctioned and sanitized. (fencing in all)
  and if they don't fit.
  by god we'll make them fit.
 watch them shake
 we'll crack and break to make them fit.
 After all, it's the world's nature to be fair and organized.
 and if it's not, so what?
 we'll make it the world's nature.
 After all, the world belongs to us
 (we wrote and signed the deed ourselves).
 It's a slave to behave how we command.  Sit, beg, play dead.
              meaningless-everything.
 mentally, I'm stressed
 emotionally, I'm depressed
 financially, I'm pressed
 physically, I'm a mess
 morally, I could care less
 romantically, she won't talk to me
 eternally, I'll wait and see
 naturally, I'm not the one to be.
 my soul wants to sleep but my body won't let it so fucking pathetic
 wet cigarette not lit can't light itself cause I won't let it
 that movie was good are we still in it
  still sitting in this coming-down-restless-paranoid-need-to-write-but-
 have-nothing-to-say-like-to-hypenate-everthing-forever-until-i-get-bored-
 wow-this-is-a-long-hypenated-phrase-wonder-when-i'll-stop-okay-getting-
 bored-now-gonna-stop-soon-about-now type of mood.
 I think I'll spend my life at a keyboard just so I can write a bunch of
 shit.  Then when I'm 60 I'll publish a book of these rambling rants
 called "Don't Buy This Book" and it'll be a best seller.  I'll be famous
 because I'll be the first to apply "reverse psychology" to the market place.
 And I'll coin the term "reverse psychology marketing" and pretty soon
 household cleaners will bear labels that say things like "This cleaner
 doesn't clean up shit!" and people'll flock to the stores to buy it.
 I'll revolutionize the marketing industry.  Yeah.  That's what I'll do.
 ... at least I failed gracefully
 Like god says when the story ends, 
 "good night."
