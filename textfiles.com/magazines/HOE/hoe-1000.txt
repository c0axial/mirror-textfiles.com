	Your web site (http://www.hoe.nu) is really quite bizarre.  It's
 as if five maniacal, ritalin-laden children got together and had a
 writing orgy that never ended.  Well, I like it, but I can't actually
 read it.  That's not an insult, but why do guys put together such
 sophisticated satire right next to dumb stories about POOP.  Maybe I'm
 missing something?

 you even bother, but you know.  text is raw.

	God gave me large breasts, so I've got a licence to bitch.
 Whatever you want to tell me, I probably know already.  I'm tired of
 going to sleep at night and waking up and remembering that I have a
 sexual identity, and I probably know how to count because that's what
 we're supposed to have learned.  I'd like to unlearn, shift lock!@#$%^&*(),
 and be a brand new text file writer each and every day.
	I've got absolutely no problems with the French.  People say,
 like, "hey, the French are pretty snobby"--but I don't see it.  I don't
 have any idea what they're talking about.  They make good food, movies,
 and bizarre phrases that pepper our incestuous minds.  I like that.
	Real art fags use caps lock--structuralist dipshits.  The best
 writers use numbers to communicate.  The patterns always change.

	Howdy.  This is Sed, of HOE infamy (aah the fame of being a
 teenage t-file writer).  I came across the HOE webpage today & thought I
 would send my greetings.  It's weird looking at all these stories I
 wrote years ago.  Nowadays I'm struggling to make a living as a
 "professional" (heh-heh) writer, so it's quite a trip looking at all
 those things that showed up on my BBS screen way back when.  I can't
 decide if I'm supposed to feel nostalgic and cheery about those old
 writings of mine, or feel incredibly embarassed.  Probably both.

                     A Special Message From The Editor

	HIYA, GANG.  Over-whelming would be an under-statement--if for only
 one moment, everyone in the world would hop online simultaneously and
 share the incredible joy that I have for each and every one of you.  My
 insatiable LOVE resides over this here computer network.  Take a look at
 your CPU for a minute, you.  See it?  It's got Mogel's LOVE coursing
 through it's circuits, guys!  I hope that makes you FEEL.

	You're easily impressed, and HOE E'zine is there for you.  We are
 wonderfully clever.  We are incredibly stupid.  This is the 1000th issue
 and I just CAN'T STOP the RIVETING FEELINGS from TRICKLING out of my
 FINGERS.  I would try to stop THE EMOTIONAL BLITZ from SWALLOWING YOU
 WHOLE but I CAN'T.

	We are a movement.  A bowel.  A very profound one.  It all comes
 down to one insurmountable phrase: "I'm Eating Your Fart".  Don't bother
 trying to stifle the giggle.  I know it's there.  Can you believe I
 just said fart?  I am completely off the hook!  Just like the time the
 teacher said blah blah blah, does it really matter what I type as an
 anecdote here?  You'll read it anyway!

	Who am I trying to kid?  All I really want is congratulations for
 being the most prolifically insane person in the computer underground.  
 But words are never enough.  Gosh, I want to impress you.  Man, like a
 boxer, I can just keep re-assembling words in different sequences,
 swinging punch after punch, until I finally get a phrase that you guys
 will really be HIT in the FACE by and THEN I will have SUCCEEDED.

	AHH HOLY FUCK I'M WITTY.  I'M PIERCING YOUR BRAIN WITH ASCII
 WORDS!!!!  CAN YOU POSSIBLY READ ALL 8.6 MEGS OF HOE???? AHAHAHAH THIS
 IS A 164k ASSAULT ON YOUR SENSES!!!! THIS IS A TEXT OVERLOAD!!! WOOOOO!!!
 I AM SHITTING DIRECTLY INTO YOUR EYEBALL!!!!

	Somewhere in this issue appears the result of me ejaculating
 onto this keyboard.  Is that too over the top?  I'm here for your
 enjoyment.  I'll do anything for you.  When you're alone, think of me.

	YO DUDES I JUST SMOKED UP A SWEET PHATTY "J" BEFORE WRITING THIS!
 FUCK!!!!  AHAHAHA!!  PEOPLE ASK ME "HEY MOGEL, AFTER RUNNING HOE FOR SO
 LONG, DO YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM TELLING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S
 GOOD AND WHAT'S COMPLETE CRAP?" AND, YO!! I TELL THEM "HAHA, NO I CAN
 NOT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?  I HAVE NEVER FELT SO FREE!!!!" SO FUCK THAT!!!!
 YO AHAHAH WE'RE BLURRIN THE SHIT BETWEEN GENIUS SHIT AND STUPIDITY AND 
 SHIT AHAHAH!!! SHIT FUCK MAN!!!

	Do you think HOE got here too soon?  Was our arrival pre-mature?
 <ehehehe, sorry honey, it's been a while, ehehehe!>

   Subj: The World of Philosophy

	i think that philosophy's main purpose is to create a description
 of the world so that philosophers can talk about it in the way that they
 want to.  they can't explain our world in its own terms, so they have to
 develop their own world with its own terms.  they then use those terms a
 lot and build up philosophies about their little world, but really, it
 has very little application in the world in which we live.

	if they were going to be talking about things that really applied,
 they would be talking about convenience stores and coffee and how the two 
 connect, and how when you go to a convenience store and buy a cup of
 coffee, you're having a certain mental and spiritual interaction with the
 employee...

	but there i go being all philosophical also.  maybe there is no
 spiritual world.  maybe that's just another creation developed to hide
 the fact that we can't explain our world using its own terms.

	the world expresses itself using its terms, and we can't
 understand them.  who is it that created this world's terms?  it wasn't
 us.  why do the terms exist?  why do trees grow the way they do, why is
 cement of that certain consistency?  someone can provide answers to these
 questions, but they will involve atoms and mathematical equations.

	oh, so mathematics is the language of nature.  mathematics are our
 representation of the terminology of this world.  then let's develop
 pictures for the plus signs, images for the symbols.  stories for the
 problems.

	oh wait, they've done that too.  that's how they taught math to us
 in grade school, that's how they taught us to apply math to the real
 world.  and since math is the language of the real world, the connection
 shouldn't have been that hard to make.

	it's too bad i understand language better than math.

                             DRIVEN by AnonGirl

	Jake Trent lived in Cleveland, Ohio, and liked to drive his car.  
 He didn't have a fancy car with a thousand functions, just a plain old
 car.  One day, after a long day at the office, Jake got into his car and
 drove home.  His eyes were burning from the fluorescent lights.  Before
 he got home, though, he had to run a few errands.

	The first errand was to stop off at the Drive-Thru ATM, so that he
 could get some cash for the rest of his errands.  He liked the
 convenience of not having to get out of his car and still be able to get
 money from the bank.  It was comforting to him.

	For the second errand, he had to go to the Drive-Thru post office,
 to mail a package to his friend Marcy, in Oregon.  He liked the fact that
 he didn't have to wait in line while reading Most Wanted posters amongst
 hostile citizens, who were also waiting in line.  It gave him peace of
 mind.

	The next errand was to stop at the Drive-Thru liquor commission,
 to pick up some alcohol for the office Christmas party.  He bought wine,
 vodka, and tequila.  He liked the idea of not having to go into the
 liquor store at this time of year, because of the crowds and robberies.
 He felt safer using the Drive- Thru.  Wouldn't you?

	Jake remembered the night before, and how a burglar tried to break
 into his house.  Since he didn't have an alarm system, he decided that it
 would be best to purchase a gun, to protect himself.  He made a quick
 stop at the Drive-Thru Gun and Ammunition store, and picked up a 99 STO
 Autococker, along with some ammo, for a reasonable price.  He knew no
 burglar would mess with him, now.

	After his trip to the gun shop, Jake was famished.  He stopped at
 the Drive-Thru McDonald's, and ordered a number two, which was a Quarter
 Pounder with cheese, fries, and a drink.  He noticed that they were
 selling Teenie Beanie Babies, and asked for a Nip the Cat.  The girl
 said, "I'm sorry, sir, but we're all out of Nip the Cat.  Would you like
 Seymour the Seal, instead?"  However, Jake didn't want Seymour the Seal.  
 He politely declined the nice lady's offer, and went on his way.  He felt
 like living on the edge tonight, so when he was through with his Sprite,
 he knocked back almost the entire bottle of vodka.  He thought it'd be fun!

	On the way home, Jake was driving through the 'hood, and decided
 that now was a great time to try out his new weapon.  He saw a group of
 chillin' homeboys standing on the corner, and opened fire on the bunch,
 killing each homey.  He'd never been involved in any Drive-Bys before,
 only Drive-Thrus.  He kind of liked it; it made him feel new and different.

	Soon after, he was stopped by the police, who drove him down Death
 Road, to the local penitentiary.  He was sentenced to death, where he
 would awaiting execution on Death Row.  His last request was to obtain
 his lethal injection via Drive-Thru.

	His request was denied, so he settled for an ice cream cone and a
 cigarette.

                      Your Call Is Not Important To Me!
                         (A Response to HOE #975!)
                                  by Clyde

	each morning when i get in to work at the b.a.c. corporation,
 there are already hundreds of callers waiting to talk to me!  i don't
 even put my telephone headset on for about twenty minutes, because i have
 to drink my coffee!  if i don't drink my coffee, i will bite people's
 heads off!  the other suckers who decided to show up for work on time
 this morning can deal with the work load, while i deal with the more
 important subject of drinking coffee!

	when i take the first call, all they can say to me is how long
 they've been waiting, and how irritated they are with our service!  if i
 walked out the door without breakfast on that morning, as i've been doing
 for months, i usually hang up at that time!  then the next caller says
 the same thing!

	by about the ninth call, i get the same guy i hung up on in the
 first call!  and this time he is steaming pissed!  i can just feel the
 steam coming through the phone!  and i'm sweating like hell!  how come my
 company doesn't hire someone to keep my coffee mug full!  need more
 coffee!

	n e e d   m o r e   c o f f e e   ! ! ! ! ! !

	so it's the tenth caller!  by this time, my genitals are getting a
 bit soggy!  they are reminding me what kind of stress i am dealing with
 and how badly i need to relieve myself of all this coffee i am drinking!  
 and the customers are still pissed off!  "four ninety five to answer my
 calls faster!  you sons of bitches!"  what can i tell them!  i have
 programmed to tell them nothing but our standard answer block, which is,
 "sir/ma'am, the priority call answering service is a way for you to get
 your needs addressed in a more timely fashion!  due to the high demand
 for our products and services, our phone center employees typically
 handle up to ninety calls per day!  we can bill your visa, mastercard, or
 american express card!  what is the number on your credit card!"

	i wrote that!

	we get a bonus for each priority call answering service we sell!

	but really!  have these fucking customers looked at our catalog
 recently! the women in the ads are the same women we used six years ago!  
 and frankly, these women haven't aged so well!  once our dot-com web play
 takes off, these old ladies are out the door!  i'm going to show my boss
 how to recruit hot-shit models over the internet!

	n e e d   m o r e   c o f f e e   ! ! ! ! ! !

	ok, this is caller number forty!  a true milestone!  this asshole
 wants saturday delivery!  "sorry sir, but that shipping option is only
 available on our web site, unless you are subscribed to our priority call
 answering service!  we can bill your visa, mastercard, or american
 express card! what is the number on your credit card please!"

	he hung up!

	i take my headset off, and run to the bathroom down the hall!  
 after pissing, i towel off my genitals with some paper towels!  i also
 stuff a bunch of tissues in my back pockets!  believe it or not, this
 makes sitting down for a long time much more comfortable!

	next caller!  hey, this will be caller number fifty-five!  i think
 it will be my last one for today!  screw quotas, i'm going to a movie
 tonight so i have to leave early!

	"yes, ma'am, we are an internet company!  just open your web
 browser and type in double-you double-you double-you dot ..."

	"are you going public soon?"

	"huh!"

	"are you going public?  i want to buy stock in an internet
 company!  when are you going public?  er, can i talk to your PEE ARE
 person, or someone in INVESTOR RELATIONS?"

	"how can i help you!"

	"listen baby, ALL I WANT IS TO STRIKE IT RICH ON THE INTERNET.  i
 DONT WANT your FUCKING products!  the ONLY GOD-DAMN REASON i sat on hold
 for so long is to find out about INVESTING in your company!  listen!  i
 have been investing for just TWO MONTHS and i HAVE to find the HOTTEST
 new trend in the industry!  i want to invest in a company that will FLY
 OFF THE CHARTS and put NETSCAPE to shame!  i just opened my E*TRADE
 account and i want to BEAT THE STREET!  beat the street, baby!  that's

                        The Pubic Hair Shaving FAQ

                Maintained by Styx <styx@rebel-alliance.net>
                          v0.5 - January 09, 2000

  FAQ questions

  a. Why would anybody shave their pubic hair?
  b. Should I shave my pubic hair?
  c. What should I know before shaving my pubic hair?
  d. Is it true that my cock and balls will itch after I shave them?
  e. Is it true that shaving my pubic hair will make my penis look bigger?
  f. Anything else?

  **************************************************************************

  a.  Why would anybody shave their pubic hair?

      Good question, and it beats the fuck out of me.  Some guys claim that
      shaving them adds sensitivity to the genital area, especially during
      sexual intercourse or walking down the street.  While this may be
      true, you will find that this is most often said by guys who are TOO
      CHICKENSHIT TO SHAVE THEIR DICK.  What they are NOT TELLING YOU is
      that the added sensitivity is actually due to the BLEEDING AND
      BURNING YOU EXPERIENCE AFTER DOING SUCH A RIDICULOUS THING.

  b.  Should I shave my pubic hair?

      ONLY IF YOU ENJOY WAKING UP AND WISHING YOU WERE DEAD EVERY MORNING.

  c.  What should I know before shaving my pubic hair?

      First and foremost - there is NO graceful way to go about it.  You
      will hurt yourself and your loved ones.  You will bleed.  Your hands
      will shake.  You'll be in pain.  Read dick shaving tips all you want
      by the experts.  They're full of shit because they have web sites.
      I have a web site, too, but there is no content and I've no reason to
      lie to any of you.

      Secondly, if you're going to do it, ASK YOUR GIRLFRIEND IF SHE'D MIND
      BEFOREHAND.  This is KEY.

  d.  Is it true that my cock and balls will itch after I shave them?

      YES.

  e.  Is it true that shaving my pubic hair will make my penis look bigger?

      Actually, yes.  But that doesn't make up for the AGONY AND TERROR.

  f.  Anything else?

      Yes.  You will get pimples all over the place and you won't be able to
      stop scratching them, embarassing you and your friends in the process.
      Carry around a bottle of baby powder and pray that it will end soon.

                           LUKE RIDES WITH THE WIND
                                   by Kreid

        Yeah, I rode that motorcycle.  It was my soul, that bike was.  I
 lived for that motorcycle, and the feeling it gave me as the desert wind
 blew threw my hair.  I was a motorcycle enthusiast... a BIKER.

        I rode with the wind!

        Name's Luke, by the way.  Luke Cool.  That's my name, yeah, that's
 what they call me.  Know why?

        Because I keep it cool.  Always cool, with the wind in my hair and
 the road under my wheels, and my ass-lips gripping the sides of that
 sweat-slicked motorcycle seat.  I was a rider, a rider with no pants and
 no fear in this world.

        Yeah, I rumbled a few times.  I rode with gangs.  I kicked some ass,
 but that's not me.  I'm Luke Cool, I keep it cool.  That's why they call
 me Luke Cool.

        But, my friend, I can tell you no more about the ways of Luke Cool.
 The wind is calling, and I must ride, ride away.

        Ride on... ride with the wind...

        ride.

	Aren't you FEELIN' it?  Why so sad and blue?  Why's it so hard?
 Why do you feel so inadequate?  HOE E'Zine wants to know what's a-goin'
 on in that silly ol' noggin!

 From: Vien Luong
 To: hoe@hoe.nu
 Subject: HOE

	I'm not one of you.  I tried to write for HOE once.  I wrote
 Something Stupid.  Yes, I'm "iNSaNe_GuRL", you may remember me.

	Sometimes when I'm bored I read all the HOE files.  Sometimes I
 just sit and laugh and laugh, 'cause i find it all just that little bit
 amusing.  Most of the times I'm intimidated by the "in-jokes" and
 esotericisms that seem to, you know, characterize some files around here.
 Sometimes I read and think "Gee, is this good? Or is it just me?"
 'Cause not everything on here can be like genius stuff, can it?  I think
 even the stupid files have some kind of hidden smartness.  I've told
 people that before.

	Anyway, I don't fit in here.  And I read your stuff all the
 time, and I think "Gee, these people would hate me 'cause I'm a fake."
 Coz these people are easily offended types. Coz they have reason to be
 better than everyone else, and they'll think I'm lame.

	And I'm one of those people, who go on those huge chat channels on
 DalNet and have one of those nicks with AlTeRnaTiNG Caps and sometimes I
 EVEN feel compelled to shorten my words into that annoying kind of 
 net/bimbo/flirting/shallow chatting-language because that's what everyone
 else does.

	I feel mediocre.

	I wish I had a free-flowing, real, tangible, touchable, edible,
 ooozing, flooding talent... at anything, even if it was something like,
 uh, I don't know, licking cane toads, or beating myself with a stick. 
 It's not fair.  I write and I pretend I'm a tortured genius type, with
 the world's jaded expectations lying heavy on my shoulders, the whole
 misconceived notions of success and talent and materialism and conformity
 and corruption--they all stop me from freedom, from being me, you know. 
 Oh yeah, I'm sure I'd be talented if I weren't so stifled!  The truth is
 I have no talent at all.

	I read peoples work and wonder where it comes from--if they have
 to try as hard as i do to write the way they do.  I hope they do, because
 it's hard to compete with talented people.  It's even hard to compete
 with people who think they're talented but are just mediocre like me but
 who are confident enough to pull it off.  There are plenty of those.

	Anyway, don't think that I'm writing this as some kind of pathetic
 attempt to enter your world.  I wouldn't dream of it (well, maybe a
 little sometimes).  I have nothing more to say.

	DON'T CRY, DRY YOUR EYE.  We can't all be Mogel, lil' Vien!
 If you're tired of feeling so lowly in the presence of the clearly
 enlightened HOE staff, you are not alone.  DO   NOT   BE   WORRIED. 
 DO    NOT    GIVE   IN    TO   THOSE    FEELINGS    OF    LAMENESS!

 INTO A DARK WOOD
 by Oregano

	Hansel and Gretel walked into the dark woods looking to have an
 adventure.  Now we know that we should not go off alone and Hansel and
 Gretel knew better than that, they could get lost and they could get
 attacked by a bear or a wolf, but they went anyway and you'll see why
 that was a bad idea.
	At least they had some sense, at least they were paying a little
 attention and not just spaced out on video games and loud music.  Can't
 they turn down their stereos while I am talking to them?  Why don't you
 kids listen?  I have lived far longer through this life and I know what I
 am talking about, I don't just talk to hear myself talk, I tell you what
 I know so you don't have to go through the same crap I went through.
	Anyway, Hansel and Gretel knew that it was easy to get lost in the
 woods, they at least listened to that part, they thought they were so
 freaking smart.
	"Don't go into the woods, it is too dangerous," I tell them.  And
 they answer, "Why?  What is so dangerous?"  and I tell them how they can
 get lost and turned around and never find their way home and in a
 weakened state from sleeping out in the rain and cold a coyote will jump
 on their back and sink its fang into their neck till they bleed
 ferociously and once they give up the struggle the coyote will eat their
 arms and legs and probably eat into their belly all while they are still
 alive and unable to scream.
	So the kids figured, "We'll take along some bread crumbs and that
 will mark where we have been and then we can find our way back and we
 won't get lost and oregano is an idiot since his scare tactics have a
 simple solution.  We won't get tired, thus we can fight off a coyote as
 long as we don't get worn down by rain and cold.  And we won't because we
 are so clever with these bread crumbs."  And they went off into the
 woods.  Now had they asked me about their bread crumb plan I would have
 said, "you dumb flubs, birds like to eat bread, what were you thinking?"  
 They'd have a smart aleck answer and then think of something else just as
 stupid but I could have wore them down and they'd have seen how stupid
 they were and then they would have listened to my first advice which is
 stay the freak out of the freaking forest!  Just because I don't tell you
 all the dangers does not mean that there are none.  I know--so listen
 to me.
	Hansel and Gretel went out in the woods to explore.  They dropped
 bread crumbs to mark their path home and they had a delightful time
 mincing and prancing in the woods, all smug and sure of themselves.
	They got a fair way into the forest and they saw a house in the
 middle of the trees.  Now for a normal person reason applies and we know
 that if someone wants to live alone in the middle of a forest, far from
 neighbors or grocery shopping, then they are wacko and dangerously
 unstable.  But Hansel and Gretel did not think.  They didn't even pay
 attention to my talk about not speaking with strangers.  They'd probably
 say, "well you always talk to the women ahead of you in line in the
 supermarket.  They are strangers."  Stupid kids always with the smart
 remark, I try to tell them how that is different since I am looking for
 poontang.  But they don't listen to words, and they don't even listen to
 actions, they see grownups talking to strangers and they think all
 grownups are approachable.  So they went up to the house and knocked on
 the door.
	The thing with kids is that they won't take the jug of V8 juice to
 Mrs. Morley since she has a strange rasp to her voice which frightens the
 children.  The same Mrs. Morley who lets them sled on her back lawn after
 it snows, the same Mrs. Morley who never forgets their birthday, the same
 Mrs Morley whose son died 20 years ago and still loves to be around kids,
 still needs to hear their laughter.  The kids won't go to her house, even
 to deliver some juice when she is ill, to talk to a woman who just wants
 to remember, but they will knock on the door of a strange coot way out in
 the forest.
	Hansel and Gretel knocked and the door opened to reveal a woman I
 would later be able to identify as crazed.  But she had a strange laugh
 that the kids took for delight.  She laughed while she forced a smile
 after giving a momentary weary look of scorn.  But kids don't pick up on
 the fact that the first expression is the real one, it gets covered up by
 the false one.  They thought they found a friend.
	I'll call her a witch, the police called her a confused old lady.  
 I doubt she dabbled in spells, but close enough.  The witch welcomed the
 children inside and offered them something to eat.  The kids being hungry
 from a long walk wandering the woods ate up.  They know to be wary of
 food from strangers, that I have to inspect their candy at halloween, for
 example, and yet they ate up the food at the crazy witch's house.  The
 witch fired up the oven.  The kids did finally have a warning light go
 off on their proverbial dash board. Why is she lighting the oven? "Maybe
 you can take a look inside," the witch asked to Hansel and when he looked
 in the oven the witch kicked him in the butt and closed the door, ready
 to cook him up.  Thank goodness the two kids had a little assertiveness
 training and Gretel opened the oven and the two children, together, with
 their tricky little minds, shoved the witch into the oven and wedged the
 door shut with a broom stick.
	This is at least what the kids told us, and the police, for all we
 know they just snapped and went out into the woods and killed a helpless
 old lady.  But that seems unlikely, the kids are not quite that smart.  
 And this woman's house really smelled.  Not just the charred flesh, but
 it smelled, eww, just bad.  And in her photos I could see that crazy look
 in her eyes.
	Hansel and Gretel got out of the house and found that there were
 no bread crumbs left.  And now they remembered the bad things I warned
 them about and they froze in panic and stood near the house trying to
 figure out how to get out of there.
	Gretel told Hansel about a TV show she watched where moss grows on
 the north side of trees and that they could use that info to go north.  
 Now here is the thing about TV...it lies!  Moss does not grow on just one
 part of a tree, it grows where ever the freak it can, but kids believe
 what they see on Matlock, or whatever stupid shows they watch.  At least
 it got the kids moving and they found their way out of the forest before
 dark and I had to go pick them up a few miles southwest of our house and
 after they babbled enough about a crazy woman, and they convinced me
 something was up in the woods, I called the police and we all went out
 and found the house and the dead witch and boy did the trouble start
 then.
	So anyway, I want to tell you that story tonight so you know that
 you gotta pay attention to what I say, don't go off on half knowledge and
 when I say to stay out of the woods, you gotta trust me to know what is
 best for you.  Okay, sleep well.  And have nice dreams.

                     MIDNIGHT CONVERSATION IN ELECTRIC
                                 by Mutter

 IF YOU'RE LOVED, THAT'S GREAT.  IF YOU'RE HATED, THAT'S JUST AS GOOD.
 It's when people are indifferent to you that you have a problem!!

  	Are you mocking me?
		In what sense?
	In dollars and sense
		Strom Thurmond thinks so.

 EVERY DAY HAS A DIFFERENT SMELL.
 It's when every day smells the same that you have a problem!!

 You're getting stupid--claiming "nobody" saw that movie.
 Fuck you.  Nobody was me, and that movie was my life.
 	Where did the 8 million in revenue come from?
 Cuba
  	Fuckin' Commie!
 Nicaragua, actually
	Uhhh, Leftist pinko?

 I have a problem.  I had a dream last night.  You were in it.
 I was in an empty house with you and some kid I didn't know.

 OKAY, HERE GOES!  You said you had to go to work for two hours but would
 be back in time for the party.  When you left, I asked the kid where he
 lived.  He said "Florida".  I told him I wasn't driving to "Florida".  
 He told me then he had TO GO and HE LEFT.  I locked my front door after
 him!  I peeked through the window to see a little girl approaching my
 house!  This scared me for some reason, and I tried to find my keys in a
 bag but when I turned it UPSIDE DOWN all that fell out was LOOSE CHANGE
 and A BRA.  Well, I ate the bra for some reason and I found my keys for
 some reason and a song began playing outside, and I couldn't! help! but!
 sing! along! and open the door.  As soon as I opened the door I had a gun
 in my face, "Gimme THE KEYS to the truck!"  I gave him the keys, even
 though I don't own a truck.  Then I chased after him with my own guns.
 Someone was waiting in a car with a shotgun and the three of us had a
 bizarre gun fight, ending with everyone being shot and still walking
 around and the kid saying he got the gun from my house.  No kidding.

	You're a satanist, aren't you?  Kinda?
  	Yeah, I can tell.  Satanists have no creativity.
        Most extremists lack imagination.  I'll prove it. 
        Fill in the blanks:  "I like to rub _________ on my __________!"

 Are you on drugs?
 
	That doesn't fit the blanks.  Try again.             

 Are you a pervert?

	I went to a doctor with a case of boredom;
	he laughed in my face and sent me home.
	I went to a dealer with a case of boredom;
	he prescribed a drug to make life fun.

        OKAY, WELL, the only drug I'm high on is LIFE!
        (The breakfast cereal! Hehehe!)

 Fucking addict.

  	Yes, no, I am a pervert.  Is this beside the point?
	You're the one that lacks imagination.
	For instance:
        What would you do for a KLONDIKE BAR, you FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT?

 At least i'm not an addicted pervert.

  	No, I'm a perverted addict.  There's a difference.
        You're very judgmental for a satanist.  Kinda?

 It's easy to be a good driver in the passenger seat.

  	Well, it was nice talking to you.  And by "nice" of course I
 mean "painfully boring."  Would you please take my keys out of your
 vagina?

                      _Dog Humped My Dog & Mine Is Tied_
                                    by Styx

      The Poconos are a small string of mountains in Mid-to-Eastern
 Pennsylvania and there are a bunch of little podunk towns smattered around
 in them and mostly they all suck, but sometimes they don't.  The towns
 usually have minimal security due to there being NOTHING TO ENFORCE.

      Yesterday I got my hands on the 1999 Annual Security Report of a
 policeman from one of these villages.  It encompasses everything he did
 as a policeman for the entire year.  I guarantee you it is authentic, but
 I will not give any names for fear that some moustached mullet-head with
 four teeth will find out I raided his shit and will enact revenge on me
 by dumping a keg of Coors Light on my cat who I love very much.

      Bad spelling and the original form remains intact, as always.

                                 PICTURE THIS
                                  by Caitlin

	Picture this, a familiar scene in #ezines on EFnet once upon a
 time... you've got your typical asshole criticizing the new comers about
 their angsty teen rants, a few lazy fat-asses talking about their
 favorite book by Vonnegut, or their favorite pop song, and then there's a
 few pseudo-intellectuals discussing philosophy or politics.  Of course,
 you can't forget the few unwittingly ignorant people that frequent the
 channel as well.  They're talking about their breasts, or clothing, or
 maybe their GED test, or drugs.

                   BIGGIE BIGGIE BIGGIE CAN'T YOU SEE?

	"Flowering like a.... flower... with children's tear drops
 poisoning the leaves, salt infiltrating the dirt like it was running away
 from the IRS," she read aloud in class.

	Silence from the students.

	"Picture this," she began, "There's a girl on the corner of
 Michigan Avenue selling flowers for mothers day for five dollars extra,
 and we're going to go to the grocery store to buy the $1.99 bouquet on
 the way home from school so we can give them to our mothers in a rush,
 and a quick kiss on the cheek."

	Silence.	

	Okay, picture this:  there's a girl in my choir class that makes
 me want to cut my face off.  Beyond the boundaries of cliques and fascist
 fingernails tapping on the books they don't open, she is definitively
 annoying.  Need more to work with?  "LIKE, OH MY GOD, YOU TOTALLY HAVE NO
 MAKEUP ON TODAY!@#@#$!?!@!"

	Hahahaha, she almost cried.

	Detour--picture this:  caring about someone so incredibly, you
 would work ten times harder then usual just to make a future with them
 possible. Once upon a time, there was a girl who could get perfect grades
 if she had the motivation.  Then after love's arrival, she strikes a 4.0,
 with a recommendation into advanced placement courses.  Last year she was
 sweeping hallways for grades.  Who are we talking about?

                       TH-TH-THIS DANCE IS MINE

	Pictures aren't enough to keep her going, you know.  Skipping
 class, even for the doctor is discouraging.

 <dumbgirl> HAHAH I GET LOTS OF DATES BECAUSE MY TITTIES ARE REALLY BIG!!!!
 <asshole> hah 
 <smartguy> Buddhism of course takes its roots in Hindu, from India. the
            ancient Hindi texts pre-date anywhere from 1500 B.C. or 
            earlier--they were the old teachings, called "vedas".  a lot
            of this vedic scripture was based on the culture, and there's
            many Hindu stereotypes.  I'm obviously not very concerned with
            Hindu, although it's important to bring up since not only does
            Buddhism take its roots there, but it is still a present
            religion in the world and has some interesting philosophical
            ideas of its own.
 <smartgirl> I just read The Dharma Bums. I hate Buddhism from now on,
             okay?
 <girl> I got drunk with a cute boy.
 <fatass> I am so fat, yo.  I like to eat.  I also like Marilyn Manson
          and Korn.  Sometimes I listen to FATboy Slim. hahahaha, THIS IS
          BECAUSE I AM FAT!!!
 <fatass2> Whoa, I am fat, too.  I eat, too!  I hate pokemon!  I hate
           lots of stuff.  Oh, yeah, I like food.
 <null> I have a cat!  Her name is Anna!  She drools!!
 <acoustyxx> I like beer.  My girlfriend is hot, hahhahaha, fuck you all!
 <STD> HAHAHAHA QUINN THE ESKIMO!! HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA FUCKING SHIT 
       (subtext: I am in love. I am better then you all, hahahaha.)
 <somegirl> haha, yer cute, hahaha.  Why aren't you here?
 <smartguy> Well, you know, "Buddha" comes from an ancient language of
            writing called "Sanskrit".  Reference is made to this, of
            course, because it's a language that doesn't exist anymore,
            but many Buddhist texts are originally written in.  Buddha,
            which originally comes from the word "Budji" (meaning
            "Perfected mind"), was a term to come after Sidhartha died,
            however, in a sense.  Anyway, I'll be referring to Sidhartha
            as "Buddha" every now and then, but it's important to note
            that the word is also qualitative, as something can be
            "Buddhist"--and it was furthermore made clear that the
            "Buddha nature" existed within everyone.
 <asshole> shut up
 <asshole> i am better then you all
 <someguy> fucking drugs.. legalize it alllllll... 
 <somegirl2> i hate laundry! you all think i am stupid, but i'm really
             a smart person. see.. i have this problem where i graduated
             stupid, i appear stupid, but i'm really not stupid. see.. I
             have a cat... she's not stupid either.
 <dumbgirl> i went to the store yesterday, and all the guys were staring
            at my titties.

         How to Bring About a Socialist Revolution by Slacking Off!
                               by Uberfizzgig

	For the most part, when we're kids and growing up, we live with
 our parents.  They pay for everything we need to survive and have fun.
 Then, after we graduate from High School or College, we go out and get
 any job we can and start complaining about it.  Well, we should just stop
 doing that.  Not complaining, but stop taking a job that really isn't the
 best that can possibly be.  All kids, when they grow up and are about to
 move out and get a job, should just hold off on that until they find one
 that offers total benefits, 6 weeks paid vacation, and democratic control
 of the company itself by its employees.  If the next generation of young
 educated laborers did this, companies would soon be faced with a drastic
 labor shortage.  They would have to begin offering greater and greater
 pay and benefits to attract workers.  Most companies are not in a
 position to move overseas, or hire foreign labor, and foreign labor in
 places where labor is cheap is also not highly educated, so all these
 people staying at home would be for the most part enhancing jobs that
 only they are really able to get.  If this continued, companies would
 eventually discover that by offering benefits, pay and working conditions
 of extraordinary magnitude, they could get these people to leave their
 homes and come to work.  Other companies follow suit and perhaps even
 offer greater things because of the competition for labor.  But in
 general, we'd end up with a socialist work place out of this.
	There may be some difficulties with this hypothesis due to my
 liberal application of demand-side economics.  However, a bunch of kids
 that just slacked off at home and didn't get jobs and wouldn't get jobs
 until they were the best possible jobs there could possibly be because
 that what these kids believed they deserved might currently be though of
 as lazy, arrogant assholes, but in reality they are the impetus of social
 change and rising standards of living, they are soldiers in the class
 struggle, the driving engine of history, the spirit of the proletariat!
	 So for the sake of humanity, don't get a job.  Don't move out.  
 If you've already got a job, quit and move back in with your parents.  I
 for one already have my bags packed.  Just doing my part to save the
 world.

                       I LIKE TO KILL PEOPLE by Kreid

        Yes indeedy, I like to kill people.  There's nothing quite more
 satisfying to me than watching the life expire from a pleading and
 innocent pair of human eyes.

        I AM A TOOL OF GOD'S WRATH.

        Except love, maybe.  Ah, love.  That is what we are all searching
 for in this world, isn't it?  I sure think so.  Then again, I'm no
 expert.  I've never known love, or at least not the love of another
 living person.  But I would really like to.  I'm curious.

        DEMONS TREMBLE AT MY AWESOME POWER.

        Is it any reason not to love a person just because that person
 kills people?  I just don't understand people.  Maybe that's why I kill
 them.

        ANGELS SCREAM OUT MY NAME IN PRAISE.  I AM KNOWN ACROSS THE
 HEAVENS.

        Speaking of which, I'm almost sure that there's a question on the
 minds of my readers: why do I kill people?  Let me answer that question
 with a question.  Why don't you shut the fuck up, asshole?

        I AM TEN TIMES MORE FEARED THAN GOD HIMSELF.

        Fucking asshole.  It's not that I have a short temper.  I know for
 a fact that I have a very long temper.  People have told me so.  Of
 course, they usually tell me so before I explode with murderous rage.

        GOD'S BATTERED MOTHER SUCKS MY DICK EVERY NIGHT AND SWALLOWS MY CUM.

        Now ask yourself a question, asshole.  I'm curious.  What's worse,
 jail or death?  My guess is that you're a slender little piece of ass.  
 Would you rather have that ass fucked (somewhat) continuously for a
 period determined by the state, or would you rather just have your life
 taken away from you?  Either way, your suffering is the result of a man
 doing what he loves to do.  It seems to me that the most dangerous people
 out there are those who still rely on simple pleasures.

        SPEAKING OF DICKS: I'VE GOT A HUGE PECKER.

        When I was a kid, it was okay to rely on simple pleasures.  But
 then, my arms got bigger, my eyes got bigger, my appetite got bigger, et
 cetera. Now I kill people.  C'est la vie!

        HA HA HA HA HA.  MOTHERFUCKER.

        To be honest at last, I know that I am inferior in almost every
 way to almost everyone I murder.  But then, they're all dead!  Hah.

	Back in the day, back before I even knew what a modem was, there
 were hackers.  And these hackers would often get long distance calls for
 free.  In fact, getting free calls was a big important part of hacking
 because calling all over could get quite expensive.  Now, however,
 there's stuff like dialpad.com which lets you call phones with your
 computer over the internet, and that means free long distance.  So now
 one of the original skills any 31337 hax0r could not be without, has now
 been co-opted by the corporation.  Free calls is not a part of it
 anymore.  Perhaps this is the accomplishment of a goal within the whole
 enterprise, a fulfillment of the undertaking, or perhaps it is the
 washed-out main-streaming of the underground.  In truth, however, I have
 no idea what I'm talking about.  I wasn't there.  But one thing's for
 sure, I've got a new long distance carrier.

                    _The Drizzt Trilogy; An Introduction_
                                  by Styx

      This is going to be weird to explain.  Here we go.

      If you're already familiar with AD&D, particularly Forgotten Realms,
 feel free to skip this introduction/explanation.

      Drizzt Do'Urden is a character in the AD&D Forgotten Realms multiverse
 and has several different novels based on his story.  He is what is known as
 a Drow Elf, which basically means that he has dark skin and lives
 underground.  I hate him for two very specific reasons;

      1) His character is invincible.  He never dies.  He's boring.  It's the
 time-tested formula of bad-guy-turned-good-guy, who fights for what's right,
 but still has a dark side that he continually has to battle with, etc, etc.
 Boring as hell.  And he just never dies.  Sometimes his death is teased, but
 he always manages to crawl out of the rubble and annoy me more.

      2) Even more importantly, the guy who messed up my very first
 relationship with a girl went by the nickname "Drizzt Do'Urden" online,
 which made me hate the character all that much more.

      I no longer do.  I'm pretty indifferent.  I wrote the following trilogy
 over a span of a few months back in the winter of 1997/1998.  I hadn't
 intended on using the Poetboy Chronicles formula that you can find in the
 I Bleed For This? e'zine.  It just happened that way, and it was pretty
 effective for me.  Just clearing my ass while I have the chance.

      If you don't know much about AD&D, some of this stuff will definitely
 go over your head.  Likewise with The Care Bears, Winnie the Pooh, and the
 Teletubbies, all of which fuck Drizzt Do'Urden up pretty bad.

      So here we go.

      NOTE:  I posted these on the AD&D newsgroup once.  They wanted to lynch
 me but I made my saving throw and now they still suck.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------

           _The Drizzt Trilogy; Part 1 - Drizzt vs. the Care Bears_

      One day, Drizzt was lazing by the side of a creek, mentally
 masturbating over how cool he was and counting his artifacts, when the
 Care Bears came along and gang raped him.  HappyBear took control of
 his tight elven rectum while LoveBear filled Drizzt's mouth with his
 hard, fuzzy LoveMeat +3 +5 vs. boring characters that never smile.
 JoyBear made a new hole in Drizzt's cranium with a big rock and took
 advantage of the orifice with reckless abandon.  GleeBear had a very
 small appendage and was able to slide easily into Drizzt's urethra,
 and SappyBear did very odd things to the drow's nostrils.
 
      When the Care Bears were finished and satisfied, they gang raped
 him again.  Then they drowned him in the creek.  Then they shot him.
 Then they gang raped him and shot him again, and then they drowned him.
 Then they shot him and pissed on his head and drowned him some more.
 When they were done, they shot him again and drowned him.  Then they
 shit all over him, took pictures, and sent the images to
 webmaster@aol.com.
 
      Then they shot him a little more.
 
      The end.

 Hi Carlin.  I have to also HEARTILY disagree, but this time with you!!@!

                     (DRUNK ASS SLUT. NOTICE BEER GOGGLES.)

 Yes, you see, 98% of all interpersonal and sexual relationships start,
 for adults, with the help of their old friend alcohol.  It's like an
 instant aphrodisiac!  Something happens once you get out of high school,
 something strange and silly, and your ability to randomly hookup with
 people without fear of social opprobrium falls away.  You've got to be
 drunk now, in the real world.  And if you don't, the person you're trying
 to score does.  In fact, their sexual drives only turn on when the booze
 is free flowing.

	Yes, Carlin, there is a Santa Claus, but he changed his name to
 Jim Bean or Jack Daniels, and on weekends he moonlights as the good space
 pirate Captain Morgan.  He doesn't live in the North Pole anymore, no,
 now he lives in the black mining hills of easy sipping Tennessee.

	Seek electricity.

               I Thoroughly Enjoy Limp Bizkit's First Album
                            A Review by RottenZ

	Let's call a spade a spade; I thoroughly enjoy Limp Bizkit's
 first album, "Three Dolla Bill Y'all".  I'm not embarrassed to admit it,
 despite what you may think.  We've exploded from the post modern age to
 the post-ironic age, and in its wake, I feel no remorse in sharing this
 tidbit with you.  Oh, sure, it was no classic, by any standards, and
 there are certainly weak portions, but I believe the "Counterfeit-Stuck"
 one two punch of tracks 3 and 4 alone are enough to cement it in my
 "like" category.  Why, just today, I was driving down the highway on a
 sunny, chilly day, listening to Limp Bizkit's first recording, "rocking
 out", if you will, and I did not feel one bit guilty.  It was quite the
 good time.
	Significant Other still sucks, though.  Enough of that god damned
 "Nookie".  Enough!

 AN IMPORTANT REMINDER by Mogel

	Expression is progression.  Please remember that.  Expression is
 your ability to interact with a THING and have something HAPPEN.  You
 will find, that it's particularly pleasing when the producer and the
 produced are the same thing.  Being yourself doesn't mean you can't be
 someone else, too.  You are not yourself, you are someone else--you.
 Get it?
	Expression is art, entertainment, media, thought, writing, ideas,
 sounds, images, uniqueness, listing things, self-awareness--living.  And
 if you're not living your life, you're living the life someone else
 handed you on a plate, smeared with some shit you can't identify and
 wouldn't want to, even if you could.
	And why are you doing that?  Does it make you feel you have power?
 Does it make you forget how empty your life can be?  Does it give you a
 BONER?
	What do those things really mean?  Sorry to be so off-base and
 confusing.  Can we pretend sincerity is "OK" if it's self-aware?
 I'm talkin' about bein' real, of course.
	I'm talkin' beyond the hedonistic urge of "WOW!".  Toutin' that
 "it's just entertainment!" ethos, where tasteless sucksters pretend that
 thought pulls the punch--but real punches do damage, no matter *how* you
 look at them.  I'm talkin' beyond the pretentious, the art fags--sittin'
 in their delusionary "cool lunch table", jerking off to a fancy camera
 angle.  I'm definitely talkin' way beyond the people that hide behind
 "cultural relativism" as a means to justify something fully intended to
 give Rico Suave a throbing erection.

	What I'm suggesting is this:  it's good to think about it.

	Here it is, real simple:  men with money make the media.  They
 demographically study you.  They decide what everyone likes in common.
 Those things are simple things (I LIKE DA BOOM BOOM BOOBIES).  They use
 their accrued money, money that you've flooded them with, and they
 produce the same time-tested, lowest-common-denominator bullshit over and
 over again.  Why shouldn't they?  It works!  You've proved it, by 
 throwing your money at them over and over again.

	They're banking on your bad taste.  They are us.  We all hear a
 lot of really shitty things getting praise.  In reality, it's because we
 don't know any better.  Chronic crap, Pavlov-style.

	I am not dissing you because you like crap, I'm dissing you because
 I expect more.  I'm only anti-establishment if the establishment just
 SUCKS.

	How many of you jackasses talk about the PeRFeCt SoURCe CoDe--so
 down on Microsoft, aren't you, but you still cried when you saw Liv
 Tyler's stunning performance in ARMAGEDDON, didn't you?  How many cliches
 do you NEED?

	One Man, One Gun, One Mission
	It Was A Clean Wound, The Poor Bastard Probably Never Saw It Coming
	The Killer Was A Pretty Scary Killer
	Isn't It Funny How Tragedy Brings A Family Together?
	Armed With A Wet T-Shirt, She Ran For Her Life
        High School Sucked Quite A Bit
        A Natural Disaster Can Certainly Be A Bad Thing
        Adorable Child Gets Murdered, Everyone Cries
        A Number of Bullets Are Being Fired, People Are Dying As A Result
        Misunderstood And Loving It
	Pretty People Who Do Zany Things And Shit Blows Up

	Originality is difficult, but if we keep apathetically embracing
 crap, we're like autistic retards, talkin' the same bullshit year after
 year.  Is that really what you want to be like?

                                        BECAUSE THERE IS LITTLE ELSE TO DO
                                                                 by Quarex

	This file warrants a very brief introduction to inundate those of
 you who are not familiar with the Aethelwulf's Utopia-Bloomington/Normal
 tradition of making sayings on the boggle board in my basement, which has
 been missing one single block since time immemorial.  Thus, three
 four-letter words and one three-letter word must be made.  MUST.  There
 was no room for variation in this sacred ritual.

	Well, with a few minor exceptions.  Invariably, as you all no
 doubt know, Boggle boards get knocked over, and then further pieces go
 missing.  On such occasions as yet more pieces were unavailable, leniance
 was allowed on sayings being spelled out.

	I would try to list who made each saying next to it, but that
 would probably end up with somebody being pissed off at me for giving
 myself credit for a brilliant saying that someone else came up with.

	I guess I will still try, though.  I will list names next to the
 ones I know for sure.  And, moreover, I am a fucking retard.

	Here it is.  A list of all the boggle sayings EVER MADE.  Well, at
least all the ones we remember.

                                RED EYES by Effy

	All the doors closed.  Five candles burning.  Four cones of patchouli 
 incense.  Smoke from the pipe.

        Hey, you know, he couldn't help it because it looked so good.  The 
 dealer had a bud the size and shape of a BANANA man, how can you turn
 down such an herbal heaven?  Of course, he didn't get the actually banana
 bud.  That was just $100 he didn't have.

	How fucking amazing, man.  Damn, it's hard to breathe.

	Stumbling into the bathroom, he squinted painfully as his eyes
 watered from the smoke.  It was like his eyeballs were inflated and
 burning out the side of his skull.  Frantically, he rubbed his eyes, only
 worsening them with his resinated, smoke-covered fingertips.  He clawed
 at his eyes in agony and fright.  He grabbed a cloth, and ran it under
 some cold water, then slapped it on his face, letting the cool water
 relieve his burning sockets.

	He gasped, as his heart beat a thousand times per minute, leaping
 out of his pulsating chest.  Stepping out of the bathroom, his body
 suddenly jolted sideways and he slammed his shoulder into the wall.
 Waves of apathetic giggles slipped out the corners of his smiling mouth.

	Oh, dude!@!!

	It didn't seem as bad once he sat back down.  But it was only a
 matter of maybe half a minute before he fell to his knees, unable to see
 as he tried to stumble out of his chair to escape the smokey fumes that
 had cumulated in the room.  How could he have been so stupid?  You don't
 fucking burn all that shit in an enclosed place in a matter of an hour
 and expect it not to make you blind and make your nose stuffier than a
 motherfuckin' turkey.

	Man.  If it weren't for this gay smoke, this high would be way
 cooler.

	He clawed at the window and forced it open.  The cold winter
 breeze rushed in.  His eyes drank in the air hungrily, savoring a sweet
 recovery.  He smoked the rest of his pipe.  The shit was fucking
 amazing.  Floral.  Fruity.  He ate a bagel.  It was the greatest fucking
 bagel he had ever tasted.

	The room slowly became more bearable after a couple more less
 intense fiery optical attacks.

	SWEET.  Like CANDY.

	Your stomach is the voice in your head.

          _The Drizzt Trilogy; Part 2 - Drizzt vs. Winnie the Pooh_
                                   by Styx

      Drizzt was lazing by the side of the creek, oozing Care Bear
 semen from every hole in his body, feeling victimized and disoriented,
 when Winnie the Pooh came traipsing along.

      "Oh bother," said Pooh, glancing down at his honey pot.  "I'm
 almost out."  Then he glanced up from his honey pot (which was almost
 empty, you know) and saw Drizzt lazing by the side of the creek,
 oozing Care Bear semen from every hole in his body, feeling victimized
 and disoriented.

      "Hello!" exclaimed Pooh.  "What's this?"

      Pooh poked, pushed, and nudged Drizzt with his sticky paw until
 the drow regained full consciousness.

      "What is that leaking out of your nostrils, ears, mouth, and
 anus?" asked Pooh.

      "The Care Bears raped me," explained Drizzt.  "I'm an innocent PC
 gen-x Bush-listenin' brainwashed TV addict, but I'm an American, so
 it's alright."

      "It's not honey, then?" questioned Pooh.

      "No," Drizzt replied.  "The Care Bears raped me and their musky
 fluids are dripping out of all the holes in my body.  They shot me and
 drowned me a lot, too, but somehow I still live!"

       "So you've no honey?" Pooh asked.

       "No," said Drizzt, rubbing his temples.  "Just a bunch of Care
 Bear cum."

      "You're a god-damned prick," Pooh said, and proceeded to shove
 his soft, yellow, yet erect penis right into one of Drizzt's gunshot
 wounds.  He pumped furiously, fueled by the frustration that he had no
 honey left.  Drizzt moaned, groaned, protested, and even requested
 that Pooh use a condom, but Pooh was so engrossed in the task at hand
 that all he could think about was shooting Drizzt's spleen full of his
 100-Acre-Wood seed.

      "Please," begged Drizzt.  "At least put on a condom!  I saw it on
 MTV!"

      But it was too late.  With a final, shuddering sigh, Pooh let
 loose a blast of AIDS-infected semen straight into Drizzt's digestive
 system.

      "Eat my diseased spunk!" rasped Pooh, and began walking away.

      "Pooh," whined Drizzt.  "Pooh, please.. please help me.  I hurt
 so bad.  All of my holes are raw and bloody and now I've got AIDS.
 Not only am I banned from my subterranean home, but I'm going to
 emaciate into a pathetic excuse of a drow.  Imagine what it will do
 to my reputation!  Find Elminster, please.  He's in Shadowdale
 planting a garden!  He can help!"
 
      Alas, Pooh was already beyond earshot.  "Tut tut, it looks like
 rain," observed Pooh.  "I must find a smackeral of honey.  I'm
 terribly hungry!"

      And Drizzt lay there beside the creek, oozing and choking on his
 own vomit, taken advantage of by a bear of Very Little Brain, shitting
 out semen and convulsing.

      Then he became a god, memorized some spells, and passed out in a
 pool of his own urine.

      The end.

                                 FAT FRANNIE
                                  by Kreid

        fat, fat frannie sat around eating her fries.  she liked to eat
 fries because they made her fatter and also because they covered her face
 with a layer of delicious grease.

        "GAAMMM GHAHHAJJAJAJAJAJBJAHL," said fat frannie.

        "uh-oh," said old man skinnybones.  old man skinnybones was fat
 frannie's husband, best friend, and lover.  old man skinnybones loved fat
 frannie with all his skinny heart, which could be seen beating weakly
 through his thin, pale, translucent flesh.

        "uh-oh," said old man skinnybones, "sounds like fat frannie wants
 some more fries!"  old man skinnybones liked to think that he knew what
 fat frannie's groans meant, since he loved her so much.

        but the truth was, old man skinnybones couldn't tell a "GAAMMM
 GHAHHAJJAJAJAJAJBJAHL" from a "PHHHHHHBRBBTHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFFPF ARF
 ARF ARF ARF MEOW," which, by the way, meant "i need some more fucking
 fries right now!"

        old man skinnybones flipped through some of fat frannie's
 flesh-folds, searching for his car keys so that he could go get his lover
 some more fries. he flipped through those flesh-folds just like always,
 flap flap flap until he smelled shit, then go back one.  there, old man
 skinnybones found his wife's beautiful love cavern honeypot, in which his
 heart and his car keys remained when he wasn't using them.

        "your pussy smells so beautiful, my lardy lover," said old man
 skinnybones.  "just spread your thighs a little more if you can so i can
 get the car keys, okay, lover?"

        "GAAMMM GHAHHAJJAJAJAJAJBJAHL," replied fat frannie, as she
 grabbed old man skinnybones by the loose flesh on the back of his bald
 head and shoved it directly into her soft, stinking cooter.  "GAAMMM
 GHAHHAJJAJAJAJAJBJAHL" was the phrase fat frannie used when she wanted to
 be pleasured orally.

        old man skinnybones happily began licking and sucking at his
 lover's vagina, which became progressively more wet with foul-smelling
 greasy fluid. when his wife reached orgasm, as always, old man
 skinnybones's head was crushed inside a 400-pound vice of thigh-meat.  
 when he came to, he had shit himself.

 OH HOLY SHIT IT'S AN INTERVIEW WITH MOGEL
 by CHRISTOPHER CROWE

   Crowe: Let's dispense with some questions!
 
   Mogel: Interviews should be more interactive.  Everything should be
          more interactive.  I wish people had buttons.  I don't mean
          that.  Who cares what Ted Koppel really thinks?

   Crowe: For those who don't know you, give us a general "who you are"
          kinda run down.
   
   Mogel: Well, I don't know who I am.  I like to think of myself,
          ideally, as just some weird guy that sits in the corner and
          bellows awkward social commentary every few minutes.  But, you
          probably don't mean that. 
   
   Crowe: I think everyone already knew that much.
   
   Mogel: I think that I've been online since 1990.  I've been involved
          in various "online communities" over the years.  I'm generally
          known for being a "text file guy".  E-zines, more specifically.
          Although, "E-zine" is such a vague term, isn't it?  There's a
          whole slew of stuff included in there.  I'm generally associated
          with a community of folks that make up the 1990s version of
          "text files" and "underground digital zines".  I use the word
          "E-zine" by default, but I'm generally associated with those.
          I don't know who I am.  Who am I?  You tell me.

   Crowe: I'd venture to say that's your niche.  You've done quite a bit
          of work in those areas--although a lot of it seems to be humor,
          socially-related, and satire.  What would you say is your
          favorite?

   Mogel: My personal favorite "area" of e-zines?  Uhh, Probably the honest
          stuff.  That sounds vague.  You know, E'zines have been around
          since the '80s.  They started as these little ASCII text files
          that were traded around.  The original idea was this:

          Anybody anywhere could write a message and have it, in theory, 
          be spread far and wide.  It was a strange sense of new-found power,
          really.  I mean, before the modem, a kid couldn't do that.  He'd
          write something, or say something to his friends.  It couldn't be
          spread in a medium where just some random stranger could 
          download, read it, and, hopefully, say "WOW!" or (even better)
          "YEAH! ME TOO!".  That "me too!" effect, although a common
          expression used be AOLers on UseNet, is a critical direction to
          making good text files.  And "being honest" doesn't always mean 
          write-in-a-direct-to-the-reader style--it means, addressing
          things in a manner that's going to actually mean something to
          them.  So, uhm, that's why I love the honesty.  There's a
          certain "trashy" look that e-zines are always going to have.
          It's not a professional thing, and it rarely pretends to be.
          That aesthetic is something that TV could have capitalized on,
          you know, if they weren't so overly-focused on money.
          E-zines are more about the message.

   Crowe: How did you come into these things?

   Mogel: The first e-zines I stumbled upon were the more self-glorified
          cDc, and the much more trashy BLaH.  cDc totally inspired me.
          Some of the files in there were totally hilarious and brilliant.
          Of course, a lot of it was total crap, too.  This was early 1993
          and a lot of your average computer guys were STILL on BBSes, and
          the mass-move to the internet had not quite happened yet.  
          Regardless, in 1994, I decided to do what 40% of the local-BBS
          world was doing: "START MY OWN TEXT FILE GROUP".  Since then,
          I've written for quite a few.  The most pride probably came from
          the earliest issues of DTO.

   Crowe: Deserved or not, you've pretty much regarded as being at the
          front of the 'zine movement.  Probably one of the most well
          known "zine guys" on the net.  In your experience, how has the
          text file scene evolved?  How has the "web" changed it versus
          the old BBS or even telnet/gopher?
   
   Mogel: It's definitely not deserved.  In the bigger scheme of text
          files, I'm definitely still new.  I jokingly refer to 3 periods
          in e-zine history.  These terms are only in-jokes with me and my
          pals, though.  There's the "oldschool", which is roughly
          1980-1987.  This is basically all the original and founding
          e-zines.  Some people would say that everything that has been
          done with text files was done in those years.  This was totally
          back when BBS-centered e-zines were what was up.  The move to
          the internet slowly happened during the next phase.  And, in a
          way, this was the true "pioneering" days.  Things like PHRACK
          were going to court for publishing stuff.  cDc and The Neon
          Knights were quite popular.

          The "middle school" is basically all the e-zines that things
          like cDc inspired.  Things like BLaH, FUCK, UXU, IBFT, and so
          on.  There was a HUGE slew of these.  Sometime around 1993, when
          the internet really took off, these was a real down time for
          this stuff.  Some people say that it's never quite recovered.
          It's kind of silly, because, in theory, the internet provides
          *more* fuel for the original idea of an e-zine.  Don't get me
          wrong, there has been a resurgence.  In 1994, I tend to call
          that "the new school".  It's basically when everyone on the BBS
          world, like rats from a sinking ship, hopped to the internet.

          The difference?  Well, there's not really a "community" anymore,
          I think.  BBS's were full of groups of kids, wanting to be
          subversive, and they'd call up and download these funny-ass text
          files about blowing up mailboxes, or fucking the dead, or
          whatever.  With the internet came a new idea that "ANYONE" could
          view these files, and it kind of killed the magic for some
          people.  I'm not bitching, though.  I mean, to some degree, you
          have to make community happen.  You can't just expect random
          people to bump into each other. People who just sit around and
          whine about no community are generally the same types of people
          who nobody would want to be in a community with anyway. (How's
          that for a mean generalization?) 
   
   Crowe: There is a tendency for the new zines to be "angst", "teen
          angst", or "social commentary".  Where do you see this heading?
          Where do you see the text file scene heading towards in general?
   
   Mogel: The angst is typical.  DTO had a lot of angst.  Basically, uhm, 
          I think "angst" is just an emotion, like any.  Emotions are
          tasty.  But you have to swallow, digest, and shit them out.  You
          can't just stick them in your mouth and let them sit there.  
          God, that's a terrible analogy.
   
          But what I mean is... if you use angst as a tool to do something
          cool, that's great.  I think it's also common because a lot of
          young people that would be into e-zines are probably going
          through "big changes" in life.  Youth is generally a time for
          misdirected anger.  Your PAL Y-WiNDoZE wrote a pretty on-point
          article about this topic that's in HOE #90.

          As for "The Scene" (where is that, anyway?)--I have no idea.
          Text files are absurd.  I've been half-heartedly trying to
          flagship a sort of neo-new school e-zine movement (yes, I say
          that sarcastically) with the resurgence of HOE.  I have no idea
          if it will work or not. Probably not, but it can't hurt to have
          a little fun and try, ya know?
   
   Crowe: If your not having fun, why do it?

   Mogel: Because you're on a mission from GOD.  There *are* e-zines out
          there, but for most of them I rarely pick up something special
          out of them.  I feel like, if they were gone tomorrow, I
          wouldn't give a shit.  I totally agree, which is eventually why
          I painfully *forced* DTO to die.

          You know, now that I think about it, I think entropy will win
          out.  Like, the world would be totally chaotic and pointless.
          My room is messy--I have to *do something* to make it clean.
          So, I have low expectations for the scene's future (people have
          been generally passive), but I'd like it to be a good one,
          somehow.

          Don't get me wrong, there's just so much you can care about a
          group of people who are willing to publish a text file describing
          the TRUE nature of poop.

   Crowe: What about other types of Literature, especially net-based
          stuff.  Fiction, Fan Fiction, etc?  Other 'zines?

   Mogel: You know, like, "what the hell is the point of text files?
          Well, write for the heart.  Write crap.  Write totally fucking
          weird shit.  There has to be meaning in there *somewhere*."
          Man, I'm so down on 'realist' fiction right now.  I see no
          point.  It's like a completely accurate painting.  What
          function does it serve, other than to impress people with how
          'hard' it was to paint?  Expressing things isn't supposed to be
          a complicated exercise, it's supposed to be about expressing
          things.

          I'm not about tooting my horn, although I'm sure some people
          would argue with that.  But, still, there's a billion 'stories'
          out there.  What's the point in trying to represent reality
          *exactly* as it is?  Firstly, that's impossible... and
          even if it weren't, how boring.  So, it's up to us to use 
          innovative and experimental-style juices.  There's not nearly
          enough of that.  The problem is that people tend to throw that
          label around so much. "I don't understand this... It must be...
          EXPERIMENTAL!", so basically anything that's inarticulate and
          incomprehensible gets that label.  "Lit" on the net.  Hmm.  You
          know, I've always loved The Onion (www.theonion.com). They've
          basically patented every use of "sarcasm" ever.  UXU still
          publishes, although far from regularly (www.uxu.org).  That's
          all that rolls off the top of my head, unfortunately.  I read
          Film Threat, which is a weekly indie-film e-zine mailed out.
   
   Crowe: Tell more about HOE, and do you have any other projects coming
          that we might find interesting?

   Mogel: HOE changes.  In its most recent incarnation, HOE is basically
          my attempt at pissing all over everything I've ever done.  But,
          at the same time, embracing what e-zines are *really* about, to 
          some kind of gross, logical extreme.  But it's also fun.  The
          idea is this:  You write something, we publish it.  No matter how
          ridiculous, weird, stupid, crazy, silly, etc, it is.  "How
          awful," most people would say, "No quality control!"  Somehow,
          however, HOE has managed to become pretty fun to work with.  
          Our "reject ALMOST nothing" policy has brought us a ton of
          *totally* diverse writers, numbering over 45, and we've been
          gathering a real community of folks.  In a lot of ways, it's
          more of a community than ever before.  For me, anyway.  And by
          writer I mean regular writer.  Someone who writes at least every
          other month.

          The idea, again, is this:  who the fuck cares?  E-zines have
          *always* been trashy.  Why pretend that they're not?  Instead,
          let's have fun with it.  Let's totally run with stupidity.  
          Let's get naked and dance on main street.  In fact, this has
          made some people find new, incredibly creative ways to be
          post-modern and stupid.  And at the same time, it's attracted a
          few people who don't "get it".  People who submit to HOE as if
          it were any regular style e-zine... and that's always good for a
          few cheap laughs.

   Crowe: You just gotta respect that sort of lackluster policy on
          content.  What, if any, is the future of your website, DTO.NET?
          Any direction on that front?
   
   Mogel: Actually, Jamesy now runs DTO.NET, and Murmur is somehow
          releasing issues... although very slowly.  But it's a total
          dinosaur.  Like a monster.  There was something really noble
          about DTO: wanting to make an e-zine that aspired to have
          *actual* quality and style and diversity.

   Crowe: I used to visit dto.net weekly.  It was an inspiration, along
          with DTO itself for a lot of my early zine work. It would be a
          blast to see it back!
   
   Mogel: well, DTO was monthly for our first 2 years.  The problem
          was we were total dreamers.  I was probably the least dreamy of
          everyone, and that was a problem.  I'm totally into doing
          creative stuff and having fun.  I don't care about being "BIG".
          But the rest of the people highly involved really had big ideas.
          We went to this rolling, weekly format.  At least 4 new articles
          every week. For a while it was nice, but it began to feel very
          *forced*.  I wasn't having fun anymore.  I dragged my heels.  We
          ended up just bitching all the time.  Basically, it was a text
          book case for "too many cooks spoil the dinner".  But I am glad
          I did it.  It's satisfying to pull something creative together
          with a bunch of friends.  And I think that should be anyone's
          goal when doing a community-oriented literary production.  Which
          most e-zines are.

   Crowe: Like you, I like the community of the whole "scene". I would
          like to see it support itself, and especially each other.
          That's basically my site's (www.lit.org) goal.  I like doing
          collaborating work with people, I find it rewarding.  I like
          sharing my ideas and seeing what other creative people are up
          to.
   
   Mogel: I think that's pretty noble.  I'm a big fan of idea-exchange
          and communication.  We're in a medium of pseudo-"art", but
          that's no reason to pretend we're not also in the business of
          communication.  In some ways, we have more liberty than anyone
          else anywhere in expressing whatever we want.

                        A Lesson From The Chronicler
                                 by Anodyne

 	You are not reading these words.  You are touching me.
	In fact, you have your left hand on my right shoulder.
	Go ahead, put your other hand on my other shoulder.  It's okay.
	We're friends.  Now I want to know if I can kiss you.
        Is it okay?  Good.

	<smooch>

	Now that wasn't so bad, was it?  I'm going to ask you to open your
 mouth wide now.  Feel the tendons pulling at the back of your jaw,
 holding it apart, apart, and release.  Good.

	Now I am going to rotate my head once counter-clockwise.

	<spin>

	I feel one 'pop' exactly one-hundred seventy-three degrees through
 the circle.  Now I am shaking my left leg lightly, bending the knee
 slowly through the full range of motion.  Okay, now you can release my
 shoulders.

	I am putting my right index finger on the center of your bottom
 lip.  Don't move.  Slowly extend your tongue so I can just see the tip.  
 Good.  I am removing my finger.  Retract your tongue.

	Now that you are warmed up, please remove your pants.  Don't
 worry, we're alone.  Now isn't that much more comfortable?  What's that
 you say?  You're used to reading text files without pants?  That's why I
 picked you, my dear--I knew you'd be able to help.

	I am placing my left thumb at the entrance of your vagina, one
 millimeter from the outer labia.  Don't move.  I am going to penetrate
 you.  Is that okay?  Good.

	<slut>

	The genital stimulation you are receiving should be pleasurable.
 It is?  Good.  I am sliding my knuckle against your pubococcygeal muscle,
 resulting in a significant pull on the clitoral hood.  From the noise you
 make I gather that this is an exceedingly exquisite sensation.  You lose
 track of time.

	I am removing my thumb.

	Please put your pants back on and allow your breathing to return
 to normal.  This isn't that kind of text file, after all.  You knew that
 when you started.  You came here looking for insight.  Of course, you've
 already been given the insight.  Still don't understand?  I'll show you
 once more because I have all the time in the world, if you'll excuse the
 pun.

	I am looking into your eyes now.  I can see your pupils dilate
 slightly.  My face is intensity, tinged with compassion.  You consider me
 attractive but not overly so.  Then it changes. I Know You.  I show you
 that I Know You.  You are spirited away by Hermes.  You are in awe.  You
 lose track of time.

	Don't worry, I was keeping track.  It's my job, after all.  It was
 ten seconds.  In those ten seconds you didn't /know/ the meaning of
 life--you /were/ the meaning of life.  You see, human beings are the only
 creatures on the planet so acutely aware of Time.  I have just taught you
 that time, not death, is the opposite of life.  Time encompasses Death;
 without Time there is no death.

	I am breaking the hands off your clock.

	Now go live.  Go lose track of time.  I love you too much to bear
 having you visit me again.

               STUPID FUCKING IRC QUOTEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

 <AIDS> ahahhahaha Teletype why are you so fat?

 <kreid> the only reason your shit smells is because you eat shit all day
 <kreid> you go to mcdonalds and eat your rancid shit-burger and then you
         go home and dump your filth into the toilet.  and every time the
         shit goes through another body it smells worse.
 <kreid> in twenty years, the stench of your shit will have grown
         exponentially and you'll just sit there in your house smelling
         your own shit from your bathroom.  and then when you get hungry
         again you'll get in your shit car and go down to taco bell and
         eat some more shit.
 <kreid> and what's worse, it's mexican shit, and it passes through your
         system and you just sit around and fart and shit all fucking day.
         and you'll keep eating more because you're only passing shit
         through your filthy intestines and leaving your stomach unfed
         and your whole life will be SHIT SHIT SHIT and you will complain
         and EAT MORE SHIT

 <moogle> this pizza is so good that its cheese is more powerful than I am

 <Khyron> I just rode my bike up the street to buy cigs.. on the way back
          a fuckin goose started chasing me.. some fast motherfuckers

 <swisspope> cooking on the web would be dumb it would be like "click on
             the ingredients, now drop it to the pot" and then a new
             browser would launch and display a random piece of furniture
             and say "oh no! you messed up and accidentally cooked up a
             KITCHEN SINK! ha ha!"

 <sna> I know you're too stupid to take this personally, but it really is
       painful to me to think there are more than 2 or 3 people who
       would care if you died

 <Quarex> I would rather exterminate the human race than kick my cat.

 <styx> i've had a big-head-complex for 20 years but after seeing quarex
        i feel better

 <pixymisa> pointers are like the ultimate mortal kombat cheat code
 <pixymisa> up-up-down-down-kick-punch YES!@$ int becomes float!@$

 <tao> everson's constant: "for every subject X, there is 3 geocities
       pages saying "X is Cool", 2 saying "X suX", and at least 1 "X ate
       my balls."

 <dennisc> all the HOE girls need dick.

 <kreid> i defecate maybe once a week and it smells fucking great.
 <kreid> you could probably eat my shit and it would have more nutrients
         left in it than that mexican shit down at taco bell.

 <Uberfizz> If you were suddenly face to face with God, what question
            would you ask?
 <tortoise> "should i install freeBSD?"
 <mogel> "Are you ready?"
 <Nybar> "how can i successfully elongate my penis without visible stretch
         marks, or surgery?"
 <SwissPope> "Is heaven as lame as Care-a-lot?"

 <seaya> how can you worship the goddess without munching a rug

 <tao> what if eggdrops had a limited intelligence and a collective
             consciousness?
 <tao> what if they got actual pleasure from having ops.
 <tao> what if they started taking channels to seek that pleasure?
 <tao> what if they offered people warez in return for shells to
       operate from?
 <tao> i think i'm going to try to give life to a species of bot.
 <tao> a bot that tries to survive and emulate people.
 <tao> we're talking about a way for it to procreate and survive.

 <skinhorse> isn't it amazing how conversations that would take five
             minutes on the phone take two hours on irc?

 <AIDS> ahahah It must be pretty hard being so fucking ugly, Unrelated

 <SwissPope> you know, i should list the top "paranormal" topics i hate
             hearing about
 <SwissPope> #1 is FAITH HEALING
 <SwissPope> like, who gives a fuck
 <SwissPope> #2 is PSYCHIC SURGERY
 <SwissPope> like, who gives a fuck to this as well
 <SwissPope> #3 is NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES
 <SwissPope> because you can easily recreate them with nitrous oxide
 <SwissPope> #4 is ALIEN ABDUCTION
 <SwissPope> because it's LAME
 <SwissPope> #5 is MIRALCES
 <SwissPope> because i'm not Catholic so i don't understand the virgin
             Mary fascination
 <SwissPope> #6 is BIGFOOT or LOCH NESS MONSTER sighitings
 <SwissPope> because there isn't enough substantial evidence to seriously
             be creepy
 <SwissPope> let's put UFO sightings in that group as well
 <SwissPope> #7 is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION
 <SwissPope> because there are only a few documented cases and the
             "authority" on the subject is always some crotchety old fire
             chief on some local fire dept
 <SwissPope> who is like "It may be possible.. we just don't know!"

 <hardcore> why do you think all i talk about is sex!

 <Nybar> whenever anyone comes into my room, I get a cat on my lap, turn
         the chair around and say "Ahhhhh, I've been expecting youuuu"

 <Mogel> I've got a black dragon of poop!

 <Nybar> well, I just felt I exuded the aura of incompetence, but off
         that, here's a raw, irrelevant question which I must ask: why
         didn't you let me stick it in?

 <tao> don't put your thing in the bad hole.

 *ingy* No one appreciates me for who I am.

                            FREEDOM: AN EPILOGUE
                                by Basehead

    Well I don't know where I'm headed.  A freight train and a blanket of
 mud and a'watchin' the scenery go by.  I'd die a hobo death, I would, and
 I'd sink like a stone.  Enter my mind on a golden yarn, take back just
 what you've brought.  And don't tell me no lies... Yeah lies, about that
 old great big blue sea that can't be crossed, that can't be climbed.  If
 this were a beautiful country to get lost in then brother I'm already
 lost and when you're lost you're in the dark and the dark isn't a kind of
 less light, it's more like a want of light.  The heady among y'all will
 see that.
   
    Well I'm a funny bird that never lands, and the rock you skip that
 never returns.  I was the boomerang my mother threw, and she was dead
 when I came back.  Tears aren't much even when they fill a cup but I've
 had my fill. When bones is brittle bones is thin, well.  I never felt I
 could see with my bones so well.  Down to the (proverb'ul) well, and I
 looked in, and among the grime and stone I shone.  Much to a reflection,
 in the sense that it's lived in.  I've lived in.  They say, some say, I'm
 a saddlebag with eyes.  Leathery-er than the hide itself.  Mighty kind, I
 say, and tip my hat, and I don't know who wants to talk to a nigger
 anyway.  A barber's son shows me round back roundabout, and there's the
 branches of LIFE, well they're blooming and who would guess (as little
 Jakey scamp'red away) them was the branches of DEATH.  Well you have to
 go back aways, so I did, and I saw myself in as much as a man sees his
 reflection in a tree.  That could've been me, but the barber's son saw no
 one but me, and it's a shame.  Two eyes and two teeth and that's all on
 one side, no redemption, and it's a shame Jakey doesn't know history.
 And I mean his story.

    Been a long time coming, a state of mind.  Kinda like an old log, that
 lays awhile before it falls apart.  Bloody bruises aren't much for show,
 but who can tell.  Kinda like an old dog, that lays awhile before those
 big bloodshot eyes close for their last..  Lockin' old secrets like a
 safe deposit box in them big banks, like in Savannah.. on Bank Street.
 When you dig yourself a hole and that's work and the day is through then
 don't you wish there was somethin' to show?  Spit on the ground, make a
 spot for yuhself and sit down.  Life yuh ever knew looked back and didn't
 blink, but jes maybe it needed specs, then it would see these achin'
 limbs and say LORD give him light.   Give him love, christ, give him
 SOMETHIN'.  Just give him somethin'.

    Got a brother around Memphis, looking down at the bottom of the bottle
 and he's ALL bottled up.  I'm not wishin' he'd get off the bottle much as
 I'm wishin' he'd see where it's got him.  And I say Freedom ain't all
 you'd think it was, when it wasn't.  Maybe jes saying there's Freedom
 isn't bein' free, and even though I sit on the stoop and that's a stoop
 made for sitting, I got to thinking.

    Kinda as if you were hearing a story and you had one bum ear.  And you
 can't quite make't out.  Well. thats what it sounded like to ol' me.  I
 say i'm not much for livin now, when I look around.  Hold a candle to the
 walls, in a way you see what's been scrawled there.  Hands not made for
 work and slicing them apart until it's rawer than any meat you did see
 before its been cooked.  They made for creatin'.  Maybe, what's a nigger
 know about creatin'! yuh say and you shut them doors before they was
 open.  And the keys you fumble for ain't much good in the dark in a room
 with no doors. There's lessons bein learned, got no doubt.  Not taken to
 heart maybe, taken to mind.  I got lost and I ain't found my way home, I
 feel like the one that got through, slippin through fingers like some ol'
 strainer and I'm what got by.  Yeah, that big open country that would be
 my playground. A fine place of my own, a noble place to set a spell.  A
 place for a nigger like me.  With a patch'uh stubble like moss a bit on
 that log that sits, and my own soil for plantin'.  I guess that jes
 should be enough, but this life seemin all too familiar to these eyes.
 Yuh change names and faces, and the wheels and gears that hold this
 little heaven up?  Well they're still the same as ever, and I reckon no
 man nigger or white can say somethin' different.

    It's a defeat for the heart.  Walkin' through a dandelion field, well
 I feel maybe fer a moment, that pride.  Like a fleeting smiling sun.
 Passing through two dark clouds but he's smiling down on me anyway, and
 I'd like tuh think that's God's face shinin' down.  Between them clouds.
 I'd spin a golden yard out of this old mind, keep it in a safe place.
 Find my youngest son up in yankee country, hopin' he made it like I hope
 for my next breath.  Pass on this golden yarn and maybe that piece uh me
 will go on, maybe they'll remember when I'm gone.

    The ol' white men and their lovely wives, I do say lovely and mean it
 too because they was and I'd lie if I said so somethin' else.  They were
 lovely and they made a show of it.  When me and my gang clanged away down
 the side of some muddied up hill, outta sight.  Hear the train comin' and
 well you felt a bit of pride from yuh work.  That train and those men and
 they wives will stay lovely, and quicker get to the next city too.  Maybe
 cuzza me. Cuz of me and my gang.  Well, that's somethin'.  Jes wishin'
 they could see me there, I'd smile an' wave an'.. well, that's somethin'.

    Late night sometime i felt a sting in the heart.  Woke up yellin' and
 sweatin' all cold, them nightmares.. the hounds uh hell chasin' me over
 one of them muddied hills down through swamp and old dirt roads and I
 swear they was on to me but I always woke up then.  I'm an old dreamer,
 who ain't got no dreams no more, 'cept dreams of death and I'd say I'd
 rather have no dreams than these.  Sometimes I felt a sting in the
 heart.. yeah.  A sting.  My mother, a sting.. and my brother, a sting..
 and my eldes' son. Well, my eldes' son, I know he done wrong but he ain't
 never done that wrong.  And a man gets to thinkin about birds that never
 land cuz they just fly too high, and a son that sank like a stone in a
 river south of Mobile.  The crow and the pebble.  These battered old
 wings cant fly too far.. what good then, keep a crow all caged until he
 gives up his fight and then jes open the door a speck.  Well if that's
 what I'm s'pposta be on my knees for then these old knees'll stay clean.
 A boy ain't a boy th'out his father, and a father ain't a father th'out
 his boy, and my boy, he's nothin' at all.

    Funny how you never know other lives you had in yuh.  Saw a man once
 out Montgomery-way, seemed to take a likin' to me.  Said I had a mind for
 a deck uh cards, coulda made a nice sum if'n only they allowed niggers.
 I thought that was a nice thing tuh say, but not much to console me, no.
 Guess you look old destiny in the face after every few seasons and he
 seems a bit closer and he looks'a bit more knowin' every time.   Old man
 destiny and old man fate was good friends and I'd say both pretty smug to
 these eyes.  Saw 'um in my daydreams, back when I had some dreams of
 fancy years ago.  Said I thought someday there'd be place fer me and my
 son up where folks didn't take 'vantage and they just laughed all hearty
 and took me in and said some words I think says a lot, and i'm tellin' it
 how i remember it.. they said to me:  folks bred for this life ain't the
 same as other folks.  said I was livin' on like I should, cuz that's who
 I am, that's what i'll be.  I suppose it made sense, inn'a way.  Don't
 know what I'd do left tuh my own devices.  That's what I thought then,
 and now I don't know where I'm headed, what I done at the last town, feel
 like a stone skipped from place to place but never findin' one place
 home.  
 
    Heard stories bout heritage, but I don't know if that's my kind.
 Africa on the other side'th world.  Well that ain't me.  It is me and it
 ain't.  Guess it's hard to understand, most folks.  Wish I felt like I
 been stripped uh somethin', maybe they did back in them days in the
 beginning.  Crazy tribal warriors or somethin', I can't say, gettin' on
 that big boat.  Well that ain't me, only I wish it were.  Maybe these old
 bones would feel some fightin' in them, if'n I had that fire in here.. in
 the heart.  Beatin' like the heart of a tribal drum drummin', wish I felt
 blood beatin' these veins behind m'eyes.  Wishin'.  But when that's all
 it is, a wish, that's not heritage, that's jes hurt.

    Well I feel my last legs comin' on, and I can't stand much longer, on
 this good earth.  I won't die a noble death on my patch of land.. I'll
 die searchin' for my other boy, at the end 'these endless rusty tracks.
 Tracks I had a hand in, must say.  Maybe my boy's at the end and he's
 done up nice, and he's waitin' for his father, and he's got himself a
 good job and a good life.  Well.  Thas all I need to see 'fore I die.
 That smilin' face.  Guess that's the last dream for this dreamer, come to
 think.  Guess when your hopes for your own lose meanin', there's nothin'
 left.  Yeah, they took a lot from me and not just me 'course.  But they
 can't never take it all.  Maybe jes sayin' there's Freedom isn't bein'
 free, like ah said.  I guess I know where I'm headed aft'all.  Yeah, my
 boy..  Good lord, my boy.  I'll spin the grandest gold yarn you or he
 ever did see.  I'm hopin I find 'im.  I'll pass on this presh'ess yarn,
 cuz it's all I've got.  Maybe that piece 'uh me will go on.  Maybe
 someone'll remember when I'm gone.

                    HEY BASEHEAD, I WANT IT IN MY BUTT
                              by CannibalB

	When your mentality breaks down and tries hitchhiking home, will
 somebody pick it up? My lips have pills in the glovebox that decrease the
 ringing in my ears and my head has a handgun under the seat. Tie me up
 with twine and string me from house to house. I want the world to see that
 I am the universal princess.

	Baby, I am the garment that chafes your skin- the blaze across
 your spine. You're my match and I'm the kerosene. Electric juices sprint
 across the telephone line and melting in your mouth.  Savor my flavor
 because baby, I have two left feet and a wand of black art.  I'll start
 with your eyes and open your thoughts. You're my lucky charm, so pass the
 milk. Baby, I have no buttons to sew when my threads come undone. Pick the
 fruit I bare and spoil your appetite.

 t h i s i s t h e s o u n d o f m y t r u e c o l o r s u n c o i l i n g

	I'm beautiful when your tongue is flickering inside of me.  
 Embracing my womanhood for one night and then permanently deleting me from
 your data bank. Just tell me I'm your number one rank. Was it as good for
 you as it was for me? You loved me for 20 minutes and I'm still feeling
 wet. The void inside of me is filled with your sweat.  These holes have
 made me more absorbent than a sponge. Before carving the notch on your
 bedpost, will you hold me until I fall asleep?

	Laying on the chilling bathroom floor with legs wide open, she
 screams for comfort. Scissors are her doctor, the girl cuts and flushes.  
 Tossed in a garbage bag and over a shoulder, another queen dies.  Thrown
 in a dumpster with haunting cries, her maternal instincts still dont kick
 in. Bitches will pay on judgement day.
 Another thread comes undone.

	I'm a ballerina, spinning in my own web of lies.  Gouging myself
 with goodies and treats.  Crying for help in my sleep.  Fingers are my
 only friend, saliva running down my hand.  Again, I flush and feel
 cleansed of my evils.  Bending down, I see my own reflection in the water
 and apologize. My body is the piano, I'm a conductor of natural disasters.

 I've got the blues. Today treated me like I didn't exist.  Now it's time 
 to be beaten with my own fist. Letting the anger out of its cage, hit after
 hit, I'm afraid of this rage.  I'm at peace without Jesus, but I still
 want more.  Without this, I'm mentally poor. Now, I've got the black to 
 go with my blues.
 Another thread comes undone.

	I keep herbal love with botanic ways in a shoebox beneath my bed.
 I'm a daysleeper, posing nude for Mr. SandMan. I'm not a drama queen, I
 just pretend to be real. Sweet heart, this _is_ how I feel. I'm the girl
 who gives you knots in your stomach.  I'm the girl you wish you could be.
 Just dont pull back my sheets, the real me has a tendency to occupy its
 time there. Me love you long time.

	I'm a porcelain doll, upright in my stand.  Stuffed with
 artificial materials and sold across the land. My skin is dry clean only
 and stained with filthy prints. Burned to the stake and called a shifty
 witch. I'm living for free while my pride pays the fee.  Fitting their
 careers in my purse, I swear things couldnt be worse. I've got this
 feeling that I cant seem to shake. My personality is nothing but fake. I
 want a ticket to anywhere. Floating down the river and they're paddling
 for me.

	My personal chef will cut you a piece of my pie and top it with
 whipped cream for a share of your maincourse. I am the world's Yoko Ono,
 PUSSY HOT HOT HOT.

	Oh yeah, this file was supposed to be about anal sex.

          _The Drizzt Trilogy; Part 3 - Drizzt vs. The Teletubbies_
                                   by Styx

      Drizzt was lazing by the side of the creek, slowly regaining painful
 consciousness after two terrible ordeals in which seemingly harmless
 wood-dwelling creatures took advantage of him in stomach-nauseating, profane
 ways.

      He had become a god, yes, but it took such a horrible toll on his body
 that not even the cosmic powers he had acquired could assist him in sitting
 up.  He stared at the immaculate blue sky for quite some time, gritting his
 teeth at his humility.  He tried to make out the shapes of the clouds.  "An
 erect penis," he muttered.  "A cat."  He took a deep breath.

      The urine between his thighs and the semen that coated most of his body
 and the blood that covered even more of him had dried and, due to
 sun-exposure, had festered into a permeating stench.  Drizzt fought hard,
 hard, even harder to hold down his bile, but to no avail.  With a
 soul-wrenching shudder, it shot up his esophagus and spewed out of his
 mouth like a fountain of liquid agony.  He turned his head and coughed the
 rest up, careful not to drown in his fluids.

      "Woe is me," he wailed.  "Woe is me for happening upon such sordid
 circumstances!  Salvatore!  Greenwood!  Ao!  Where are you now?"

      There was movement to his left, then, but so exhausted was he that he
 could do nothing but listen.

      "Eh-oh!" a quiet voice whispered.  "Eh-oh!" several voices echoed.

      He heard the pitter-patter of several pairs of feet approaching him.
 Could it be the Care Bears again, he wondered?  Winnie the Pooh and his
 gangster cohorts?  He got his answer immediately.

      Four faces appeared above him.  Green, red, yellow, and blue they were,
 and quite cute.  "Lawful Good for sure!" he exclaimed.  Blood bubbled from
 his stomach wounds when he spoke, but he did not have a care!

      "Po!" said the red one, and stood on a funny scooter!

      "Laa Laa!" said the yellow one, and carried a bouncy ball!

      "Dipsy!" said the green one, and wore a fuzzy hat!

      "Tinky Winky!" said the blue one, and dangled a silly handbag!

      "The Teletubbies!" they said in unison!

      "Hello, Teletubbies!  I am Drizzt Do'Urden, and I am a powerful drow
 god.  I have been raped verily!  If you could fetch me some water and
 bandages, I shall reward you with many fun toys to play with for eternity!"

      The Teletubbies looked at each other and blinked in confusion.

      "Raped drow!" whispered Dipsy.

      "Raped drow!" they others whispered in unison.

      "Drow toy?" Tinky Winky questioned.

      "Drow toy!" the others confirmed in unison.

      They rolled him up and down the grassy hills, they bounced him like
 Laa Laa's ball, they tried to fit him in Tinky Winky's handbag, they rode on
 his back like he was Po's scooter.  Dipsy even tried to wear him on his
 head!

      "Drow hat?" Dipsy asked, holding a limp, bloody Drizzt on his head.

      "Drow hat!" the others shouted in glee, giggling!

      Drizzt was screaming, screaming in pain.  Screaming at the gods.
 Screaming at Toril.  Screaming at the authors, screaming at the novels, and
 screaming because Po had bent him over a wooden stump like a bitch and was
 pounding furiously, laughing merrily.

      "Sodomy!" exclaimed Po.

      "SODOMY!" the rest shouted happily, and they all took part in the game.

      It was then that Drizzt's eyes rolled into the back of his head and
 his saliva stopped frothing at the mouth.  It was then that his testicles
 retreated into his pelvic cavern.  It was then that the drow's big, heroic
 heart gave way and it pumped its last dose of life, for it could take no
 more.  He slumped with a sigh and his hot skin began the long, slow chill of
 god-death.

      "What 'dat?" asked Po, pointing at the drow.

      "Broken toy!" the Teletubbies exclaimed!

      "Again!  Again!" they whispered in unison.

      And they did it again, reveling in the necrophilia they had unwittingly
 stumbled upon.  They took turns back and forth, back and forth, until they
 were very tired.

      "Messy toy!" they whispered, watching their goo seep out of his anus.

      And their friend Noo-Noo the Hoover sidled around, lowering his vacuum
 hose down onto Drizzt's penis, and sucked the drow's entire carcass up
 quickly into his insides.

      "Yay Noo-Noo!" the Teletubbies giggled!  And they danced a happy dance!
 And the baby sun smiled down at them, and laughed, and gave them a wink!  It
 was an eventful day in Teletubby Land!

      Then, without warning, a microphone arose from the green meadow rolls,
 and a loud voice came hither.

      "Time for Tubby Bye-Bye!  Time for Tubby Bye-Bye!" it demanded.

      "Eh-oh!" they whispered in unison, and pitter-pattered to their
 spaceship to sleep a wonderful, Teletubby sleep and have wonderful,
 Teletubby dreams.

      And as they slept, Noo-Noo lurked in the shadows of the ship, heavy
 with a compartment full of dead drow in his metal stomach.  He grinned,
 waved his hose around, and darted his eyes from right to left, then right to
 left again.

      "Drow taste good," Noo-Noo mumbled.  "Real good."

      The end.

 the girl sat at her desk, repeatedly slapping the bracelet against her
 wrist.  each slap was punctuated by the sound of her voice, which kept
 saying "ow" over and over and over again.  she had removed the pretty
 holographic wrapping from the bracelet, and was awaiting it to cut her
 wrists, as so many news reports had claimed those bracelets did.  "come
 on, damn it, you were banned for a reason..." she complained.  yet after
 the continual slapping did no good, she finally picked up a no. 2 pencil
 that was minus the eraser, and killed herself using the metal edge.

 moral of the story: they weren't banned for any GOOD reason.

 "What I Need"
 by Rhea

 	Love without a half-life, that's what I need.  I need something to 
 counter-balance this constant decay of my fingernails.  Oh, the way the
 smog lies so heavy on my shoulders is so
       smug.
	      ugh.

 	With a sigh, and a fly, in my eye, I cry, just like the pilgrims.  
 
	"Slaves to democracy?" I heard once--a little bird told me--a
 bird in a guilded cage, of course, and I thought--"maybe!"  But still I
 say, "Ring-a-ding-ding!  Freedom of thee, I sing!" beneath the shackles
 of everything I am that isn't what I ought to be that isn't what I could
 be that isn't what a human should be that isn't what the world should
 be--there shouldn't be this smog, it hurts my eyes--and I believe in the
 Declaration of Independence because at least it's something and I'd
 believe in love because it's something if progress hadn't discovered the
 carbon atom, which is nothing. (It was gone as soon as we knew it could
 be--like innocence--oh, the poor pilgrims!)
                            (But freedom works the other way, doesn't it?) 

 	How cruel.

	And now the world hums with life and yet and yet and yet I wonder
 what life was before there was such deep rooted hypocrisy where even
 _liberty_ chains me down and where a=b and b=c but a does not equal c and
 where the humming was just my computer all along.  A mile-long smile
 while all the while it was just a senile crocodile.

	One thing I regret is that I chew and swallow my food without
 savoring the taste, without feeling the texture, without noticing how the
 different flavors melt together, and so the only way flavor gets across
 to me is when it's exaggerated to the point of crass, unthinking
 vulgarity just like everything else in my sweet land of liberty. I take
 eating for granted.  I take my cereal and my yogurt and my soda and my
 chicken for granted and I shovel it in mindlessly.  Shouldn't eating be
 an art?  Shouldn't breathing be an art?

	Decay's okay, they say, if you play all day, and by the way don't
 forget you're clay (but only on Sunday) and by the way on Friday don't
 forget your pay, it helps you play
                                                 but I disagree, you see.

 And so I'm free. 
  Yeah, I'm free.  (Free from uncomfort, free from belief.) 
            Free from love. 

 I have so many chains in such a tangle, I can't even distinguish them
 anymore.  Sweet liberty!  If I could only taste you--really taste you!
 I don't know how yet.  But I know what I need.

 Love without a half-life, that's what I need. 
                               And all the while, the smug smog smiles.

 POLISHING AL ROKER'S HEAD by Kreid

	A lot of people have told me, "Dave, I don't know how you do it.
 Every time I try to polish Al Roker's head, it comes out all wrong.  And
 yet, every time you polish Al Roker's head, it is with grace and
 precision, and the effects are mesmerizing."  Now, technically, that's
 not really a question; in fact, I've never actually been asked about my
 head-polishing technique.  Perhaps it the subject intimidates ordinary
 people; or perhaps these confrontations have all been out of feigned
 interest.  Regardless of these things, I have chosen this night to
 finally reveal the secrets of my success.  So without further ado, I
 present to you _The Definitive Guide to Polishing Al Roker's Head_.

    	The first thing you need to do to prepare for the head-polishing
 is to get yourself a good pair of elbow-length gloves.  I usually prefer
 rubber, but canvas or studded vinyl should also work fine.  After putting
 the gloves on, I like to have a session of meditation or heavy
 crack-smoking to get myself relaxed and focused for the task to come.  
 Within three hours, I am ready for Mr. Roker's call.

        Now, this call can come at around noontime, or it can come as late
 as 4 in the afternoon.  Mr. Roker is extremely dedicated to his routine
 of eating three boxes of donuts every morning, and I've noticed that this
 process has been taking longer and longer ever since he picked up that
 heavy smack addiction while vacationing in Bali with the Dali Lama.  The
 important thing for you to remember as the head-polisher is that you must
 be prepared when the time comes.  So no matter what you do while you're
 waiting, you must maintain your focus!

        Be forewarned that activities such as television and sex can
 cripple your focus in mere moments.  Do whatever you can to keep a clear
 mind.  Despite the constant pleading sounds I hear when I walk through
 the company harem down at the TV station, I must reject all sexual thoughts.  
 Alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine should be avoided like the plague.  And,
 let me tell you, if you're going to smoke crack, have enough so that you
 won't start fiending while you're in the middle of a head-polishing
 session, and whatever you do, keep the crack away from Mr. Roker!  If he
 knows you are on crack, he will demand that you share some with him,
 which means less for you, and also means that you're going to have to
 polish a head that won't sit still.  In the event that he knows I'm on
 crack and insists on smoking a pipe with me, I keep some crushed up
 motion sickness pills with me.  After Roker smokes that stuff, he stops
 moving for at least 4 or 5 hours--this is a perfect play for an
 experienced head-polisher.

	After you get the call, the next logical step is to drive down to
 the TV studio.  I don't think I need to remind anyone that Al Roker is
 not a patient man; so no matter how far you live from the studio, you
 have to haul ass or Roker will be pissed when you get there.  And
 remember: you are employed by a major television studio and therefore
 have a great deal of immunity as far as the law is concerned.  So if
 you're like me and you don't have a car, I recommend stealing the first
 police car you can find; that way you won't look quite as suspicious when
 you're cutting through Central Park at 110 MPH.

	If all goes well, you should be walking into Mr. Roker's office
 around the same time that his head is hitting the floor from his
 pre-head-polishing shot.  Don't bother knocking on his door, just walk 
 in--he sometimes acknowledges your presence with a crooked smile, but not
 always. Personally, I try not to look at his face when he's high; I get
 menacing flashbacks when I see overweight black junkies.

        Anyway, the first thing you need to do at that point is get the
 needle out of his arm; he will almost always leave it in there, and that
 can leave some nasty track-marks, which a celebrity like Al Roker cannot
 afford to have, especially when he insists on wearing short sleeves as
 much as he does.  After the needle is out, put it somewhere out of his
 arm's reach, but somewhere he can still find it the next time he wants to
 get high.  After that, you'll probably need to clean up his mess, usually
 he leaves some cooked gear spilling out of a spoon onto his office floor,
 so clean that up. And I know what you're thinking--don't try to snort
 that stuff!  Heroin and head-polishing are just not compatible with each
 other!  Just try to clean up enough to not leave too many brown stains on
 the floor and put out his candles so as not to have to clean wax off the
 floor later.

        Here comes the hardest part: lifting Roker into his chair...
 that's gotta be at least a metric ton of dead weight, and if you'll
 believe it, the heroin hasn't taken off a single pound.  Some
 head-polishers in the past have brought pulleys and wheelbarrows to work
 in the past, but I like to do it the old-fashioned way.  A little bit of
 butter smeared in the right places can get a fat man sliding into pretty
 much any position.

        Now, if you've followed all the instructions, you should have the
 focus and the energy you'll need to do the actual head-polishing.  But as
 head-polishing is a complex and beautiful dance, I can only give a few
 pieces of advice to the unexperienced.  Remember to spit directly on the
 head--it is the key to a bright, yet non-shiny polishing.  Also, don't
 try touching the bumpy hairy things on his neck or your hands will be
 covered with them in a matter of hours.  Beside that, just remember to
 concentrate!  Be the polish.  Make love to the head.  Make the head your
 bitch; it begs for your love, but you give nothing to it, you only take!  
 Take, take, take!  Do you like it, bitch?  Of course you do!

        I acknowledge that this is a minimalist approach to
 head-polishing. Of course my technique defies most conventions of modern
 head-polishing, but still, I consistently eclipse the head-polishing
 industry with the quality of my work!  In my view, it is a mad art,
 devoid of logic, overflowing with catastrophe, and should not be
 attempted by the feint of heart.  If you do not master it, it will master
 you.  Need I mention the fatality rate of head-polishers these days?  It
 sickens my heart to know how many have died, only aspiring to be like me,
 a common working man... a zen master... a head-polisher.

 BABY ROCK ME by Tasha

	"Okay, now take a different marker and highlight the beginning of
 every sentence in your paper."

	"What about quotes in our papers, ma'am?"

	"Quotes are a whole other world, Natasha."

	"Wow, my paper begins with a whole other world."

	"Did you expect anything less?"

	"I would have settled for Africa, though it does have an insanely
 high fertility rate."

	It's really remarkable the types of things that can reflect so
 much on one's character and impressions on others.  Usage of quotes and
 such.  My teacher loved me after that and compares me to comic strip
 characters.  She thinks she has me figured and once claimed to realize
 the way I think and understand me.  I don't know.  I don't understand
 myself.

	I sometimes wonder if the way I read words that are juxtaposed
 together in something such as a jpeg title is any metaphorical and
 symbolical indication of my view of humanity.  Maybe my wanting to create
 the names of people and places into clever and witty phrases really
 expresses my inherent hope for humanity to be something better than it
 really is.  My refusal to, while knowing the truth of human behavioral
 tendencies, really accept and come to terms with the fact that humans
 simply don't live up to their inherent potential.

	Snow is a good way to really judge a person's character.  It
 splits the population up nicely.  The people who talk endlessly about its
 beauty and the people who complain endlessly about how impractical it is.  
 These people could be classified as optimists or pessimists or
 transcendentalists and what have you.  Then, of course, there is me, who
 feigns transcendentalism by briefly remarking on the white beauty before
 screaming about time and time and time and I'mgoingtobelategoddamnit.  
 Pseudo-intellectualism.

	In a long hallway which smells of burning sulfur from high school
 chemistry experiments, the children linger by the coffin-shaped windows
 and stare at the ground three floors below them.  They make faces with
 their breath and hurry to class as a loud bell rings down the hall,
 shaking everything, shaking the windows.  A high school chemistry student
 smiles at me with a mouth full of teeth.  Most people have a mouth full
 of teeth, and I usually don't notice them, but I notice his.

	I'm writing this filled with worry, because as I read through
 previous sentences, trying to decide what may go next, I notice that they
 slightly resemble sentences I've read before.  Resemble sentences of
 70-year-old males writing about junksickness which is slang for heroin
 withdrawal or heroin high and 30-year-old males writing about infantile
 saints and their lingering Oedipus complex and search for a father.

	The candles are red and bleeding, expressing the death of the
 flowers which don't have blood of their own and wilt due to their
 inferiority.  Inferior because they don't have blood and humans are the
 only organisms that count; animals don't have blood, they have juice to
 flavor and moisten their meat.

	During puberty, a girl grows fatty deposits on her hips which aid
 during the third trimester of pregnancy and males have an innate desire
 for females with a 0.7 waist to hip ratio.  I don't have a 0.7 waist to
 hip ratio.  I'm not built for childbearing and my ovaries are
 dysfunctional.  When I was born, my heart was dysfunctional.  When I was
 four, my ears became dysfunctional and my tonsils became a problem.  When
 I was six, my lungs became dysfunctional.  I don't think Darwin would
 like me very much, as I am certainly not the fittest.  My mother has very
 large hips and is built for childbearing.  She's pregnant.

	A strange boy with an unusual way of talking fancied asking me
 what my idea of utopia is, because utopia is a relative term, and I
 wasn't quite sure how to answer him.  I've never really pondered my idea
 of utopia before, other than the automatically silly answers of, "24 hour
 Golden Girls channel!!!".  UtopiaUtopianUtopianism.

 utopia (yu-toe-pe-ah), noun:

 1. a. Often Utopia. An ideally perfect place, especially in its social,
       political, and moral aspects.
    b. A work of fiction describing a utopia.
 2. An impractical, idealistic scheme for social and political reform.

	Wooo, holy mother of Jesus, I just inserted a dictionary
 definition.  I am post-modern.  I define post-modern.  I just defined
 utopia.  I guess I could safely say that my personal idea of utopia is a
 noun with two definitions, the first of which having two sub-categories,
 'a' and 'b'.  That would be a very safe definition, I could never go
 wrong, and I would have evidence to back up my statement.  Though, I'd
 like to have a personal connotation that wasn't automatically silly and
 I'd like to have a personal definition for utopia that, though people
 could question it, I would feel safe in replying with.  I want to have a
 fantasy world that I could recall in times of boredom or when I'm
 disillusioned and disheartened with the scheme of things.  I want to have
 a place I can think of and smile at the thought of, because that seems
 like a good niche for utopia in the human mind.

	I want to have a place where the air has a smell every time you
 wake up and every second you're inhaling it.  I don't want to be
 constantly growing accustom to things.  I don't want to have to worry
 about changing my environment and traveling and traveling endlessly to be
 re-amused with life and with nature.  I want to have a place that's fresh
 and new all the time.  I don't want to grow accustom to experiencing
 things that are fresh and new.  My utopia is being unaccustom.  With
 everything.  With anything.  With sights and smells and tastes and
 sounds.  With textures and grains and fabrics.

	But I didn't think of any of this when the strange boy with an
 unusual way of talking fancied asking me what my idea of utopia is.  
 Instead, I thought briefly, and didn't want to be laughed at or rejected
 or reacted to in any sort of shocked manner.  I thought briefly.  I
 replied briefly.  I replied that I didn't know, because I didn't want him
 to know.  I replied that I hadn't thought of anything, because, you know,
 the second definition of utopia is an impractical, idealistic scheme for
 social and political reform, and I didn't want the strange boy with an
 unusual way of talking to ever think that I thought of things that are
 impractical or idealistic.  With the strange boy with an unusual way of
 talking, I fancied being practical and unidealistic and brutally
 realistic so that I only contemplated and thought of things as they are
 now and only formed opinions of the current, rather than forming ideas
 for the could be or the future.  Unfortunately, the strange boy with an
 unusual way of talking has been enlightened to the ways of my poetry, and
 though he likes them, I must fight hard to overcome this minor setback in
 my formation of other's ideas of who I am.  I absolutely cannot be one
 who has written poetry, just like I cannot be one who has contemplated
 their personal idea of utopia.  At least not to the strange boy with an
 unusual way of talking.  I'm not sure if this qualifies as shame, it
 could, but I don't feel quite shameful.  I don't feel I need to repent
 for these sins of poetry and abstract thinking.

	My psychology teacher announced today that during puberty and
 adolescence, one grows the ability to think abstractly.  One grows the
 ability to contemplate things such as nuclear war and consciously realize
 how these thinks affect him or her.  My psychology teacher said this is a
 sign of maturity.  My psychology teacher said a mature person who had
 gained the ability to think abstractly would have implemented this
 ability upon discovering that the leader of Russia had resigned and given
 the presidency over to his vice-president.  My psychology teacher said a
 mature person who had gained the ability to think abstractly would have
 been worried a bit about the thoughts and ideas of this new leader due to
 his control over Russian nuclear weapons.  I hadn't thought about this,
 though my mother told me the Russian president had resigned.  My mother,
 of course, has gone through puberty.  She has childbearing hips.  I think
 about snow and consciously realize how it affects me and everyone else.  
 I think about snow and I stare down and my breasts and lack of hips and
 think I could be halfway through puberty and nuclear war will come later,
 possibly when Africa's fertility rates are lower.

 "The Social Construction of Truth and Existance"
 by Uberfizzgig

	The population of the United States is 270 Million.  Out of that
 many people, how many could actually have seen the President?  Not on TV,
 but I mean seen the President physically in person? I took a poll and
 found that about 3-4% of the US population had actually seen the
 President in real life.  Now, what percentage of the US population claims
 to have actually seen a ghost?  Not on TV, but physically in person?  The
 answer is 10%.  Now, if 10 percent of the population has seen a ghost in
 real life, but only 3-4 percent of the population has ever seen the
 president in real life, why do we believe that the President is real, but
 ghosts are not?  Heh, heh, heh!  Heh!

 I KNOW MY NAME IS STEVEN SODDENBURG... 

 Old, old, I've been feeling old lately. As I look back and peruse all the
 HOE in all of the world, all of the hoes, those lovely ladies whose flesh
 is the electronic word, who are stained with electric blood, I see them
 and I realize my connection to them is thin and tapering. Like a fucking
 tape worm. like a tanea, like a shitworm. THIN and long and tapering off
 into OLD AGE? Am I gradually fading away into that other world rather
 than bursting into with passion? It's entirely possible, it's entirely
 so, but you know, guys, you just don't seem particularly /happy/. I mean,
 you're all so god damned sad and so morose, and it's always "WHiNE WHINE
 WHINE WHINE WHEN I LOVED YOU, FRANKIE, WHEN I LOVED YOU AND THEN YOU
 DUMPED MY STUPID ASS AND THEN I CRIED AND SOMETIMES I CRY AND I CRY AND I
 CRY AND I HAVE NO MORE HOPE DUE TO ALL THE JAPANESE NOVELS I'VE READ",
 and I mean, I don't propound to be the happiest person alive, nor do I
 even want to be happy, having in fact placed my unsheathed sword dick
 inside the living flesh incarnation of that particular hilt, but Jesus
 Christ, I just couldn't maintain the energy and effort it must take to
 be so miserable so constantly. Hell, I couldn't maintain it for more than
 a hour last night, and that was after I went on the Boston Death Trip to
 see a movie I knew was going to be sold out and that I had no interest in
 seeing, and I left 30 minutes late. And in the end, my Milla Jovovich
 fascinating was fulfilled, more or less, and in the end I saw the movie I
 wanted to see. But it's like, you know, you guys, you don't even /know/
 what movie you want to see. It's like you don't even want to see a movie,
 it's like you're stuck in the lobby and you don't have the $8 price of
 admission, and you don't even care to beat 11 year olds at Tekken 3. I
 mean, you're riding in Ed Gein's death car and you don't even have a
 destination. You just don't seem particularly happy or really
 particularly interesting, so I can't really do it anymore. So I've been
 forced to splinter my sphincter into a million different realities,
 converging TCP/IP packets as embodied by a 70 mile an hour drive around 
 Thurber's Avenue Curb on 95 south, and let them all smash and collide
 into one another in the hopes that the juice which flows from the crushed
 bodies will be the sweetest possible nectar. You're wasting all this
 energy maintaining a sickening veneer of disreputable emotional
 decrepitude and you aren't even /going anywhere/ with it. The theater is
 closed and the lights are off, no one is applauding, and the film will
 never be projected. The best you can hope for is a circle-jerk mirror
 image of yourself whining as loudly as you. Like the Zombie Laura Croft
 in Tomb Raider. Your ultimate goal is the consumption of self into
 something that consumes the self. It sounds very zen, but it isn't. I
 know, I listen to Bush. I went to los angeles and I found a guy who
 basically is my asshole brother. He went on a pseudo-date with Pezmonkey.
 Apparently he's not a very happy person either, but at least he pretends
 when I'm around.

 Speaking of Alejandro Jodorowsky, I saw a post in alt.cult.movies which
 claims that the big A.J. is going to be direct Marilyn Manson's
 screenplay HOLYWEIRD. I wish Marilyn Manson would hurry up and stop
 biting my style. It's /so/ 1997, don't you think? Anyway, at the very
 least I'm happy to have my suspicions confirmed that uh the video for uh
 that song was basically just a rip off of THE HOLY MOUNTAIN interspersed
 with Billy Zane cruising for gay cock. "Hey dad, this is the guy I just
 sucked off on stage." You know?

 Oh speaking of queer ass faggots biting my old school styles: Unrelated,
 when are you going to stop using those NIN ultimate break beats and shit?
 Niggas keep recycling the same break beats for a million years. That shit
 is tired, and so are you. please stop writing text files. I'm sorry I
 ever made you a member of HOE. 

 If I was ever going to write a file full of self-pity, the vast majority
 of the context would be me feeling bad for myself that I was stupid
 enough to allow Unrelated to become a full fledged member.

 I heard he's on a hitchhiking tour of all 48 continental states. 

 Please shoot him on sight. 

 Gosh guys, don't you think, you know, instead of sitting around feeling
 bad for yourselves, you could actually go out and DO SOMETHING? Like, I
 don't know... read about General Robert E. Lee's famous horse TRAVELER?
 Can't you go see the light of day? It's bright and penetrating and might
 shrivel your harpy heart, but at least uh, you'll have seen it once...
 Like fucking BRAD PITT watching SUPER MAN. 

 I guess a lot of you like FIGHT CLUB. 

 I guess a lot of you have bad taste. 

 Remember, there's a whole world out there, and I wrote it all together
 with meaningless words, the women are all stained with blood, Tasha got
 some oral sEXXor, I longed for some oral sexxor, Dean wondered for the
 Nth time what happened to his genitalia, Bob Log clapped some tits, and
 the whole world came crashing down around us as the dreaded J2K bug
 kicked your fucking assholes.

 Yes, J2K... Jarett 2 Kobek, it's my latest project. yes, it's a Boyz 2
 Men cover group. Starring robots. hell yes. Robots that look like Harvey
 Keitel and make his Bad Lutentinadnanent Dan seal noise. 

 AARE YOU A COCK SUCKER DO YOU LIKE TO SUCK COCK LET ME SEE YOUR ASS LET
