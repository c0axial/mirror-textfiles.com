	It really bothers me when people say "I'm going out for drinks."
 when they are _not_ talking about alcoholic beverages.  Saying that you
 are "going out for drinks" is like asking someone "Can I buy you a
 drink?" or "After work, let's go get a drink," in which it is implied
 that that drink is an alcoholic beverage.

        If you are going out for drinks, and it's not alcohol that you
 are drinking, you should identify the type of drink that you are having.
 Let's take the simple case of you and a friend going out to a coffee
 shop to drink coffee.  In this case, you should say "We're going out for
 coffee."  But it can get complicated if, say, you're going out to the
 coffee shop, and you are drinking coffee, but your friend is going to
 order a soda.  It might still be appropriate to say "We're going out for
 coffee." because it is a coffee shop that you are going to and you, at
 least, are ordering coffee, since you are the one making the declaration
 that you're going out.  But what if you are the one ordering a soda and
 your friend is going to order a coffee.  Or worse, what if both of you
 are going to a coffee shop, but NEITHER ONE OF YOU are ordering coffee.
 Do you still say "We're going out for coffee."?

	Another example.  Suppose you meet a cute girl.  Suppose that you 
 know, since you've stalked her for a while, that she doesn't drink
 coffee.  Suppose you don't drink coffee, either.  And then suppose that
 you want to ask her out on a date to a small restaurant (not for lunch
 or dinner or anything, just for some non-alcoholic beverages).  Given
 that you are over the age of 13, you would most likely create a lousy
 impression if you said "Let's go out for sodas." because that sounds
 mildly retarded.  But if you said "Let's go out for drinks." it might be
 misunderstood that you meant alcoholic drinks.  Perhaps it's best if you
 identified the restaurant by name that you wish to go to.  That way
 there's no misunderstanding as to what will or will not be ordered at
 the restaurant.  Unfortunately, timing is very important when you ask
 someone out and you'll have to think of what to say right there on the
 spot.  If you rehearse how you are going to ask this girl out, you're
 more likely to bungle everything and make a complete ass out of
 yourself.

	Sometimes in life, it's a tough call.
