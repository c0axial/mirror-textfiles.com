	Step #1: Set up a controversial web page.
	Step #2: Fill that web page with content that will piss people off.
        Step #3: Get an email address that seems professional and very
                 believable.
        Step #4: Send an email to the group that would be most pissed off
                 by the content of your page.
        Step #5: That group shuts you down and informs the media to brag.
        Step #6: Put the page back up and piss them off more.

	REPEAT STEPS 4-6 AS OFTEN AS YOU WISH

	Step #7: You get contacted by the media, do interviews; accept the
                 free trips.
        Step #8: Enjoy your media attention, you are now a media whore.

	To prove that this works, I will use the example of one of my 
 webpages, DateRape.Org.

	I went and made an email address, father_joseph@clergyman.com, 
 and figured that seemed like a valid email address to remain
 professional.  The name I then assumed was Joseph Boxer, that would become
 my secret identity.  I got the name from my underwear because a lot of
 times I sit on the computer in just my boxers.  I then had to decide who
 to send the email to.

	After very little consideration, I chose to send the email to
 feminist.com (It was either there or the National Organization of Women,
 and I couldn't find a suitable email address to send them a letter so I
 went with feminist.com)... I then proceeded to write an email.

	Here it is:

 Subject: I am outraged

 Dear feminist.com,

 I came across a rather upsetting site, it is http://www.daterape.org it
 promotes date rape.  Seeing as you are one of the rather large feminist
 communities I was hoping you could help with our struggle in ending such
 a morally vile site.  Please help me spread the word amongst your
 community and to the National Organization of Women.  Thanks for any help
 you can give.

 -Joseph Boxer

	That was the mail that began it all.  I was on the telephone long
 distance with one of the contributors of the site when I was writing it
 and when I was second guessing whether or not to send it.  He told me not
 to. Too bad, I did it anyway.

	A few days later I receive a response in the mailbox:

 Hi Joseph -

 Thanks for forwarding this note to us. This is one of the most offensive
 and upsetting sites I have ever seen. I have forwarded the note to some
 groups who will know what actions can be taken including the washington
 feminist faxnet. As far as contacting NOW - please e-mail them at their
 web site at http://www.now.org - perhaps they can also help do something.

 Thanks for your activism,
 Marianne Schnall

	The seed had been planted.  Marianne, I would like to thank you
 for doing all the work for me.  You are probably kicking yourself in the
 behind as you read this.  If it wasn't for you this site wouldn't have
 prospered.  She later mailed me informing me of my site's closure:

 Joseph: I thought you would be very happy to know that the daterape.org
 site has been pulled by their web hosting company, whom I contacted this
 morning - who were as horrified as you were about the content. Thank you
 so much for alerting us to this site.

 Warm regards,
 Marianne Schnall
 Feminist.com

	They pulled me?  No reeeeaaaaaaallllly?  I had already known this,
 boy did I feel good then.  What's the matter?  You don't like my page?
 Excuse me as I chuckle.  You are doing what we want.  Pawn to Rook-4.
 At this point the media begins to contact us.  Hippy hooray!  The feeling
 of accomplishment runs through my veins.  We do the interview with Wired
 magazine, and they provide us with the beginning number of hits we had
 wanted.

 ***Phase One Complete***

	We now had a start on media coverage, we are getting requests for
 interviews from everywhere.  Radio shows, newspapers, television
 stations, you name it they more than likely contacted us.  I then decided
 to thank Marianne for her help:

 Marianne,
 
 Thanks for your help with this matter, however, I was thumbing through
 today's USA Today and noticed they have a new site up.  I took a look and
 it seems like they have gotten stronger.  What a dispair. :(

 The new site is: http://www.kracked.com/~daterape

 What are we to do?
 God Bless,
 Joeseph

 Thanks for notifying us. We will do what we can.

 	Anyway, thanks again for helping us complete part of my goal,
 Marianne.  Yes, I am a media whore and like me, you can be one in less
 than 24 hours.
