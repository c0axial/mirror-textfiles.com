	it's quite interesting on how you can persude someone to install
 just about anything on their linux machine.  below, is an ACTUAL
 conversation both myself and rattle contributed in, in order to speed up
 DCC transfers on caller's linux machine (now known as neme).

	if i wasn't laughing so hard during the process of this, i would have
 thought enough to have him place it in /usr/local/sbin, and put some sort
 of infinate sleep command in the 'dameon'.  oh well.
