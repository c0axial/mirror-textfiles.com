	once upon a time, in a pretty little land called Lirol, there was
 a pretty little unicorn called Gilor.  he was in love with the great
 beautiful princess of the land, Princess Tirol.  but she was fairy, and
 he was unicorn. so he could not be her husband. one day, as Gilor was
 walking toward the well in his small village, a great strong big unicorn,
 carrying the palace flag came into the common yard.  HE said in a loud,
 voice: "the sky is falling! it is the scariest ever seen!"

	oh no! cried the little rabbit as the car came down the lane,
 trompeling all the other little rabbits in its path.  thent he little
 rabbit followed behind, stomping on their heads.  when he was done he
 went back to his cottage and cleaned up his black boots, they had been
 stained with blood, you see.

	mister Gilor, the gallant young unicorn, with big ears,

	ate a fish.

	and he died.

	and it died.

	the end.
