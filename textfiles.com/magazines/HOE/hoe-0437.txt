 !!========================================================================!!

        this is about boogiemen.  they live in voids and wind and dark.
 there are many different kinds that do many different scary things.

        there is the standard, run-of-the-mill kind that comes on dark
 and windy nights to little kids windows.  these ones have no name but
 they are the most commonly known.

        the soul-eating kind
        ====================

        these are the most most dangerous, but don't worry, they are very
 rare.  since the great oblig defeated most of them in a battle many
 thousands of years ago since then they only come out on the very very
 very worst nights and only prey on the certain people that they chose
 their henchmen and spys are the invisible harmless kinds.

        the furry kind
        ==============

        the furry kind is espeacialy evil because it has all the cute
 little furry animals as it's friends and helpers.  so beware of bunnys,
 kittens, puppies... big feirce bears are much better to become friends
 with of dinaosoursa or something of that not-furry-cuddly sort.

        the kart-wheel kind
        ===================

        you can eat these ones. they are yummie.  they taste good in
 crab cakes or grillled chesse sandwhiches, but becareful that you only
 use a special trap when you kill them because otherwise they will swallow
 you whole and yucky poo.

        the blue kind  (with orange eyes)
        =================================

        they're bad cause blue is yucky.  they are pretty harmless...
 they cannot see you unless you are wearing orange.

        the invisible harmless kind (the only harmless ones)
        ====================================================

        they are spys for the yucky bad kind that eat your soul.  beware
 they cannot hurt you but can tell the bad ones where you are.

        the ping-pong-ball kind
        =======================

        these ones are very veyr veyr rare you can only find them in
 three places: thailand, LITTLE TINY BOXES VERY VEYR TINY AND the
 packages for certain ed gorey books but they can poke your eyes and ears
 and mouths and kill you.

        the hijkljfiuwefns kind
        ========================

        not much is known about these.

        they came from the moon but like to live here better.  it is
 paradise for them here.  they like to eat apple pie and apple juice and
 apple crisp and anythign apples.  they also like beet juice.  they like
 to poisen orange juice that people drink.
