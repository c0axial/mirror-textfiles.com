-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	hey, it's mogel here.  when you're a modem kid you find your fair
share of crazy & depressed obsessives.  it comes with the territory.

	here's just some examples that our queen supreme, metalchick, has
found on her adventures in the information superduper highway!!!

			suicide letter #1


I don't know if I can take this anymore, It was fine when it was only
the harddrives, but now the floppy's are attacking me too. They bite at
my ankles and whisper, "craig you suck" all the time, I just can't
handle it.  Let everyone know I hated them..

-----

			suicide letter #2

       I've decided upon my fate, I have grown tired of all the people
making fun of me and mocking my hair and my ways of living, so I've
decided to end it all.  I thought I'd adress this to you because
well, you asked me to.. so.. by the time you'll read this I'll be
gone.  You may think this is rahd, you may not, it just doesnt matter
anymore...   so.. goodbye.

                     love,
                        chris.

			suicide letter #3

     Dear world,  You all can kiss my ass. There has come a time in my 
life when everything seems to fade away.  Face it.. you all suck.
Understand my problems.  The world should have peace, the people should 
love everyone, but the only thing thats happpening is war.  Peace, love, 
and apathy never holds true anymore.  Everyone has to kill or be killed, 
which is very dissapointing.  So, to boycot this method, I will kill
myself and no one will stop me.  To the people that love me, farewell, to all.
I love you anyway. Goodbye for now.
                                                   the person that wrote
                                           this

p.s.- make love not war

This neither because itll make you depressed at all the teddy bears that
are gonna perish in flames.

			suicide something #4

               Long Lives The Dayz Of Hellish Outpour...
               My Life Has been Sucked Up By The Devil Of Jesus...
               Jesus Is The Devil, He Is My Saint...
               God Is No Longer With Me, For Jesus Has Snapped.
               In Hell, Lays My Mind... In Hell Is Where I Belong
               I see No Point To Live SuPhc A Hellish Life...
               Life Is Not Worth A Single Breath...
               All You Get Is Crap In This Hellish World...
               So I Am Dead, And Am God Damn Happy Of It To.

			suicide poem #5

 I smell the foul stench of death.
 I taste it's bitterness in my mouth.
 It's silence pierces my eardrums.
 I feel it entering my body,
 Slowly taking my life away.
 It has been here for some time.  I know.
 Take me now?
 Take me before I suffer more.
 Is that your intention, oh hateful sinner?
 Has it not been long enough, painful enough?
 I have given in to you,
 But still you will not hear my call.
 A thousand words rung out,
 You have heard not a one
 Destroy this fathomless entity
 Tearing away at all who stand before it so bravely,
 And even those who coward from it's greatness....
 What greatness is this that takes the life of a human?
 Thousands of tears lost,
 Years of lifelessness passed.
 Another thousand tears, and loves along with them.
 What is left?
 Hate. Hate and death comfort me....
 Their coldness touching my skin,
 Yet I feel a certain warmth and appeal.
 Touch me, oh graceful death...
 Take me now.
 Oh hate, immerse me in your beauty.
 Make me as you are.
 Blackened, and charred.
 Loveless, lifeless

	this is just a little conversation i had with rush2.

	you all may know him.  He is a really one nutty character.

rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co"   i've got it planned and will be dead this 
weekend.

-> rush2^_!@" what are you going to do?

rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" im gonna kill myself.  Plain and simple,
and I shoudln't be making any friends anyways.

-> rush2^_!@" how?

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" Oh.  Fine.  I'm just gonna get in my car and 
drive to a spot I used to play at as a kid.  No one else goes there 
it's too far out, a couple miles into this stream/valley place then ... 
I'm gonna shoot myself.

[suicide plot in affect]
------------------------------------------------------------------

[here is some things he has to say about #zines people]

-> rush2^_!@" well why do you hate crank, i mean has she done mean 
things to you but she really isn't that bad of a person.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" she was the first computer person to 
change so dramatically then turn on me.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" she told everyone what i had told 
her of how look, told everyone I was gay (Then said bi.. which I am) 
when at that time i was still scared of my feelings. Also gave everyone
out my phone number and address.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" It's nothing worse than waking up on a 
cold cement floor in a pool of your own blood.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" She was just so  mean ... so diffrent so 
taunting.  So ...  sigh i cant describe it but she jsut atacked me and 
she knows me well so she knows how to hurt me.
 
"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" well i'm completely insane.  Since i 
got onto computer about 4 years ago my mind has gone.  I'm no smart like i
was.  I cant think. I can't do anything except feel a desire to die.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" crank turned from a nice person to 
a #zines scene person :( as did mogel who i always cared for a lot and had a 
huge crush on.

-> rush2^_!@" Yeah, mogel is a nice guy.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" yeah mogel is nice.  But he used to be 
nicer.  #zines has taken a lot out of him.  Not to menton the lame philly
zine assholes like 'black francis' and the other losers.

-> rush2^_!@" Oh yeah, what did he do to you?

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" oh.  bF is a jerk.  He used to harrass 
me and make fun of me being bi and stuff.

"rush2^_!rush2@*compucon-mi.co" and he made fun of my weight, and 
sigh, he just hurt me like the rest of them.  I wanted to be friends and 
accepted with these people, but all they did was wanna make fun and hurt.

"silicon insanity"

I sit here
in this little hotel
this quaint inn
oh lonely entrapment of people
in the lonely state
of the lonely country
on this empty earth.
i sit here
my eyes throbbing with white hot needles in their backs
my wrists throbbing with hydraulic vices closing in tight
sending my messages
accrossed aa million miles
looking for a master
anything to be held
something to make sense of
the clicking
and that electromechanical humm
of that silicon box on this desk
this is the sound of my insanity.
