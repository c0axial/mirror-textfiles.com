        prologue:  this is the tale of shizbit of the planet patheticos in a
 far away galaxy.  shizbit was sent to earth to try to understand how
 earthlings work.  disguised as an earth creature, he was able to enroll in a
 small liberal arts university in the midwest, hoping that this would enable
 him to investigate earthlings on a very personal level.  of course, shizbit,
 being vaguely unfamiliar with certain earthling traditions, like headbutts
 and handshakes, would have to rely mostly on his roommate for cues on how to
 "be" an earthling.  unfortunately for shizbit, he was assigned for a
 roommate an individual known as enos.  the following are from his daily logs
 back to patheticos.  after three months, shizbit, having reached the point
 of clinical insanity, was recalled to patheticos, where he remains in a
 janitorial position.

        earth day.

 08/28/96:  i am settled in to my 'dorm room'.  my roommate, enos gain, has
            not yet arrived.  these rooms are particularly interesting; there
            appear to be multiple 'outlets' in the walls for various types of
            earth devices.  enos and i shall each have a desk and a dresser
            and a 'closet' device.  i could grow to like this place, i think.

 08/29/96:  enos has arrived, and is already well on his way to breaking any
            conceived notion i had of how earth creatures operate.  all of
            his carrying devices have bright red decals attached to them
            which say "ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES".  he has brought what he claims to
            be a 'starfish colony' and he has many tubes of the earth
            specimen known as 'toothpaste', yet his teeth are quite green, so
            perhaps 'toothpaste' has a different meaning than i once thought.
            i am so fortunate to have for a roommate such a fine specimen.  i
            shall learn a great deal from him, i am quite sure.

 08/30/96:  enos woke up at 4 a.m. this morning claiming that he had to
            undergo his daily spleen cleansing.  i am very curious about what
            this "spleen cleansing" operation entails.  he has also stapled
            many brownish shrazplot-shaped objects that he calls "mama's
            bratwursts" to the walls.  i am not sure if this is for
            decoration or for insect attraction.  i had always been under the
            impression that insects were not welcome by earthlings, but
            apparently that is not the case.  how fascinating.

 08/31/96:  these earth beings are very odd indeed.  many of them appear to
            become quite saddened when i inform them that my roommate is enos
            gain.  i do not understand.  one of them commented, "that sucks,
            dued" but i have no idea what is sucking what or who "dued" is.
            my earth name is johnny, recall.  i also went to my first classes
            today.  there are many earth creatures that wear these contorted
            objects called 'hats'.  it appears to be to keep the insects out
            of their eyelids.  perhaps i shall need to get a 'hat'.  enos has
            such a 'hat', but i can not read what is written on it because it
            appears that it has been through an earth fire.

 09/01/96:  the 'r.a.' stopped by today while enos was out and asked me why
            we had bratwursts stapled to the walls.  i told him i thought it
            was to attract insects and he looked at me very oddly and said he
            would return later.  also, the colony of starfish appeared to be
            moving today.  they are very tiny creatures and i am not at all
            sure what the appeal is.  they are contained in what is known as
            a 'pitcher' and there is an open packet next to the 'pitcher'
            that says something about "sea monkey food".  i do not understand
            such things yet.

 09/02/96:  there is this unusual earth specimen called 'candy'.  the premise
            of this candy is to be "tasty" and supposedly to "happy one's
            mouth."  i have seen many people eating this candy called the
            'mint' which is a small globuzo-shaped object.  enos offered me
            some of his candy today and said it was very good candy and he
            liked it a lot.  this 'opium' he gave me did not make very much
            sense to me.  apparently enos was adversely affected by the candy
            because he suddenly declared it was "time to mellow out, dued."
            i still do not know who "dued" is or why people keep discussing
            this individual, but i'm determined to figure it out.  enos
            passed out shortly thereafter.

 09/03/96:  i was invited to a "jammin frat party" today and i thought this
            might be an excellent opportunity to see how earth people
            interact.  i was shocked.  large men wearing the 'hats' drink
            massive quantities of 'alcohol' and 'dance' with earth women that
            often have large fatzuus stuck to their chests and they too drink
            this 'alcohol'.  alcohol must be another kind of candy like the
            opium enos so enjoys.  i then followed an earth man and woman
            into this room and apparently their tongue muscles were engaging
            in a fistfight, not all that unlike the phelephuls from
            boronisfifthelementia.
