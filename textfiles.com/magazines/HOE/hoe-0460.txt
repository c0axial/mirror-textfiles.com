 When the evil comes,
 The good will run.
 Far from home,
 They are alone.

 They cross the great ocean far,
 To find a route towards a small star.
 A shark lays down its good life,
 To take out the King of Good's wife.

 They land at the northern shore,
 To find many tales of lore.
 The first is of a great king,
 The second telling of many things.
 The Wind, The Water, The Fire, The earth,
 And finally, above all, the tale of great birth.

 When the Evil first came,
 The Good fled to a new claim.
 They went west, then north,
 Then landed till Evil came forth.

 They waited one generation,
 Then the Evil started a new station.
 There soldiers filled the distant land,
 And the Good's journey began again.

 The Good will travel for many days, 
 Never stopping till the air grays.
 When the reach that stingy place,
 The Evil will kill them, leaving no trace.
