        The girl liked boys but thought too much.  She snubbed other
 girls because she thought she was a princess.  She acted like a rare
 find because she thought she was full of coyness, cleverness, wit,
 independence, and feminine wiles.  She thought that by maintaining
 some distance from everyone, she'd project confidence and assurance,
 but to others she instead seemed a bit unfriendly and standoff-ish.
 Men found her attractive, but mostly for her striking combinations
 tonight:  black hair & red-flicked blue eyes, thin waist supporting
 silver velvet glam pants that flared at the hips.

        At the club, she mingled only with the scenesters who owned the
 hippest boutiques and organized the best parties in the city.  If she
 didn't perceive you as high-status, she'd ignore you... until she
 discovers your critical involvement in the BUGS, WORMS, ROOTS, AND
 DEAD LEAVES!  THESE ARE  AMONG THE TIDBITS FOUND IN OUR TOPSOIL.  WE
 DON'T USE HERBICIDES OR need! PESTICIDES, AND WE USE COW SHIT AS A
 NATURAL FERTILIZER THAT CYCLES THE NITROGEN BACK TO THE please more!
 EARTH.  WE GROW involvement in planning the annual vampyre ball, a
 yearly legend in elegant campiness.  But beneath the hard facade, she
 was really a sensitive little girl who took everything a little WE GROW
 ROWS OF LEEKS, CARROTS, SHALLOTS, need more please more need BEETS,
 KOHLRABI, LIMA BEANS, RADISHES, PINEAPPLES, SALAMI, DALAI LAMA, a
 little too personally, but SHITFACED, PLASTERED, but actually, she just
 needed EGO-STROKING someone to love DRUNK, and fear SCREWED, but A
 LITTLE NEUROCHEMICALLY ALTERED not without a chase AND KALE.  because
 she had a problem with loving people back, and wanted nothing more than
 to gain, though coyness, cleverness, wit, independence, and feminine
 wiles, the favor of the alpha male.

        APHIDS LIKE KALE.  WE SPRAY OUR KALE WITH SOAP AND VEGETABLE OIL.
 SOAP KILLS THE BUGS, WHILE VEGETABLE OIL MAKES THE SOAP STICK TO THE
 BUDS.  I MEAN BUGS.
