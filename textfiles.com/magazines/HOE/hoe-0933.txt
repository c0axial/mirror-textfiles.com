 If it keeps on rainin', levee's going to break.
 If it keeps on rainin', levee's going to break.
 When the levee breaks, I'll have no place to stay.

	That reminds me of when Charity miscarried.  I totally believed
 that I had a Psychic Jukebox in my head, that I would get a song stuck in
 my head, and then something would happen related to that song.  It was
 creepy.

	I wrote about it on my homepage.  Gawd, my homepage is utterly
 ridiculous.  22 megs of space, and it's almost full.  I pay $6 a month
 for the space with no ads.

	And I'm taking HTML class this spring at school.  Retarded easy
 grade.

	UGH THAT ANNOYS ME WHEN THEY SAY POKE-EE-MAN instead of
 POH-KAY-MON.  IRRITATION.

	I sang "The Silent Man" in my head when I was in the shower.  I
 hummed the whole thing out loud, mostly on key, too.  I can reach some
 really low notes for a girl.  When I was in choir, I wanted to be a
 tenor, but they wouldn't let me, I was stuck with the fucking alto
 bitches that kept saying I was calling them niggers but I wasn't.  Marsha
 was such a bitch.  I think she has a kid now.

	Like Jenny has a kid.  I haven't heard from Jenny in ages, and I
 can't track her down on internet searches, which is funny since she's the
 first one to introduce me to the internet and all.  I could call her mom,
 but her mom's this gold-digger and I don't really want to talk to her,
 she might be interrupted by a ride in her boyfriend's silver corvette or
 something.

	In the summertime, da na na na na na.  I keep singing that song,
 and I don't know any words after "In The Summertime."  Fucking hippie
 music, fucking Mungo Jerry and his addictive retarded hippie melodies.  
 My mom was a hippie.  That's why my name is Summer.  She wanted to name
 my sister Fame, but my dad wouldn't let her.  Instead she got named after
 a Van Halen song, "Jamie's Cryin'".  At least it was a David Lee Roth-Van
 Halen song.

	We should get mail on Veteran's Day.  I want my eBay stuff.

	Why does my vent shoot out cold air when the heat is on?  And why
 is my left asscheek itchy?  Shit, I forgot to change the cat litter.  I
 should do that before my mom gets home.  She'll be pissed.

	I need to move out again.  I just need some responsible friends
 that can hold down jobs and pay bills so that I can have a roommate.  I
 would rather live alone, but I work at a fucking fast food restaurant.  
 AND FUCK, I HAVE TO WORK THERE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF, because my
 FUCKING SCHOOL isn't offering half the classes for my major this spring
 and summer, so I can't finish school after the fall like I planned.  I
 have to wait until SPRING 2001 and even THEN hope that the fuckers don't
 toy with the program so much that I'll be there longer.  Sarah said,
 "Yeah, that sounds like NICC."  Sarah likes Sailor Moon.

 When there is reason, tonight I'm awake.
 When there's no answer, arrive the silent man.
 If there is balance, tonight he's awake.
 But if they have to suffer, here lies the silent man.

	I have such an evil pathetic obsession with Kevin Moore.  I think
 he's married.  I think he's about 10 years older than me.  I feel like
 I'm 14, I want posters of him all over my walls.  I don't even know
 really what he looks like, it's not a looks thing, I just love the words
 and the music that he paints.  Obsession.  America the video.

	What's with the strength levels in Dragonball Z?  They're as
 absurd as the points they give in Whose Line Is It Anyway.  And just for
 the record, Drew Carey is a shitty improv comedian.  I want the British
 version back.

	My car isn't working right, and I somehow have to come up with the
 cash to pay for it. When I get it fixed, that is.  It's just fine if I
 don't have to make frequent stops at various places.  But today I got a
 lot of shit done, and it only died once.  It'll probably cost me a
 million bucks to fix.  Go figure.

	And I really, truly wish my father dead.  I can't say that about
 many people... wait maybe I CAN... but I just can't believe he was the
 source of half my genes.

 I'm color blind, three-way tragedy.
 Pantone memory, grayscale eyes.
 Maybe I'm paranoid, yeah that's my problem.
 You almost have to be, when you look like me... yeah yeah.

	I hear doors slamming, I wonder if it's my brother coming home
 from work.  They called for him earlier.  Yep, it's him.  And he's going
 to work.  And he wants me to buy and advent calendar.  We're a good bunch
 of atheists around here, yeah.

	I wonder where my mom is.  Probably slaving away at Wal-Mart.  
 Shit, I almost feel like my life has meaning because I don't work at
 Wal-Mart.  But hey, nothing like a 10% discount to keep 'em coming back
 for more bullshit.

	I'm really sad, but for no reason.  I just dislike so many people.  
 They make me want to run away from the comfortable, familiar things I
 actually care about.  I don't know why I care about these things, or why
 I bother wasting my time thinking about these people... it's an
 obligation now.

	Cloth tape doesn't hold very strongly.  Sure, they sell it to tape
 up gauze wraps and things, but that's about all it's good for.  Don't let
 anyone kid you otherwise or fool you into thinking that it will hold
 paper bags together.  Nope.

	HAHAHAHAHA some kid just came here looking for cans for poor
 people.  WE ARE THE POOR PEOPLE!  But I gave him a bunch of cans anyway.  
 I hope the other poor people really like mixed vegetables and chicken
 broth.  They can make soup!

 Oh oh oh, she's my cover girl, oh oh oh, oh oh oh.

	Ever notice that when you itch something and you think about it
 too much that suddenly you feel little itches EVERYWHERE?  I hate it
 when this happens, because now my pointer finger and my kneecap itch.  
 Kneecaps are not allowed to itch.

	Wow, I can't think of anything else.  My mind is blank.  Heh.  No
 surprise to anyone else, I'm sure.
