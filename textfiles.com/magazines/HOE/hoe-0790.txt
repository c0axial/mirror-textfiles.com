        Once upon a time
        Not so long ago

        What were you expecting?  A big, curly helmet, sealed closed with
 Aqua-Net?  A backpack full of Poison and BonJovi CDs?  Frosty pink lipstick
 maybe?  Ok, yes I live by 4 pizza shops, and there are 5 24 hour diners in
 the 3 mile radius of my town.  But, seriously, what is a "Jersey Girl"?  In
 my travels out of state when I am among a group of my uhm "peers" I am
 automatically labeled the Jersey Girl.  So what if I have the ability to
 drive in rush hour traffic while applying my make up, and if someone cuts me
 off I can curse out even the filthiest truck driver.  I still don't think
 that's it.

        Tommy used to work on the docks
        Union's been on strike
        He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough
        Gina works the diner all day
        Working for her man, she brings home her pay
        For love -- for love

        Last week when I was cruisin up the GSP (Garden State Parkway for you
 Non-Jersey people) in my Camaro, with the t-tops off.  I was getting a nice
 dark tan in my guinea-t, I kept on my skin tight acid washed jeans to
 prevent lines from my shorts... When the fringes on my boots got stuck on
 that little lever that adjusts the seat.  I was kind of stuck there so I
 totally grinded out my trans slowing down with out the clutch until I able
 to break free.  So, there I am in the mall parking lot a clump of white
 suede fringe ripped from my boots, oh the horror.

        She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
        'Cause it doesn't make a difference
        If we make it or not
        We've got each other and that's a lot
        For love -- we'll give it a shot

        I'm not sure if it's the radiation leaking from the landfills, the
 raw sewage, the medical waste in the water, or those non-stop toxic fires
 under the Pulaski Skyway, but something has made me different from other
 girls in other states.  I mean so what if I like the kinda wine that has a
 twist cap, and my prized possession is my Kip Winger issue of play girl.
 Does that really make me so different?  I love being from New Jersey, I'm
 not hurt when people tease me about it.  I think that they're just jealous.
 The people that make jokes are just jealous!  They come from states with no
 personality.  States with out ocean, boardwalks, Springstein, pork roll, egg
 and cheese on a hard roll, saltwater taffy and jug-handles.  There is a
 point to this..

        We're half way there
        Livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand and we'll make it -- I swear
        Livin' on a prayer

        I lock up my car, snap on the t-tops and roll up the tinted windows
 and head on into the mall.  I make my mandatory stop and jean country to see
 if they have those stretchy jeans with the little zippers down the side.
 Alas they still have not got them in stock.  Of course my next stop is to Z.
 Cavarricci.  Once I buy that shirt like Jennifer Milles wore in "Flash
 Dance" and some new white suede boots, it's time to go home.

        Tommy got his six string in hock
        Now he's holding in what he used
        To make it talk -- so tough, it's tough
        Gina dreams of running away
        When she cries in the night
        Tommy whispers: Baby it's okay, someday

        This is really not a joke.  I don't make fun of people from
 Pennsylvania for their cheesetsteaks.  Or people from Iowa for their corn..
 I like corn.  Maybe it's just that the rest of the country is full of PC
 people, and the only thing in the world left that it's PC to make fun of is
 New Jersey.  "Hey Big Hair what exit do you live on".. I hate that
 commercial.

        We've got to hold on to what we've got
        'Cause it doesn't make a difference
        If we make it or not
        We've got each other and that's a lot
        For love -- we'll give it a shot

        After hitting the diner for dinner, I headed back home to shower.
 Three hours later once I got my hair nice and big, layered on all my
 foundation and blue mascara I got back in the Camaro.  Did I mentioned my
 Camaro is named Bret after Bret Michaels from poison.. I have that PlayGirl
 too!  I swung by my friend Gina's house to pick up her and her boyfriend
 Tony.  We had to take off the T-tops again because Gina's hair was rubbing
 against them.

        We're half way there
        Livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand and we'll make it -- I swear
        Livin' on a prayer

        If all you people that think New Jersey is so bad and such a hell
 hole hate it so much.  Stay away never ever come here and don't even speak
 to me about it.  This state needs fewer people, especially the annoying kind
 like yourselves.

        We've got to hold on ready or not
        You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

        We swung down to Hunka Bunkas and danced the night away.  I was so
 angry when they didn't have bending straws for my beer.

        We're half way there
        Livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand and we'll make it -- I swear
        Livin' on a prayer

        Bite Me.  I don't have big hair, damnit.
