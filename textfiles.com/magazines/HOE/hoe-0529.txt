        Noam Chomsky, world famous professor of linguistics at M.I.T.,
 says the media's role in society is the manufacture of consent.  That is,
 the media serves to set the political agenda of the country, frames the
 issues of debate, and distracts the public from more important factors
 affecting their lives in favor of sitcoms, sports, and infomercials.  By
 now, most of us should realize this.

        But here's a recent example, if you're not convinced.  Did you see
 the movie "Urban Legends"?  Remember the one about the girl who eats at
 Taco Bell and ends up with a tongue full of roach eggs?  Well, evidently
 Taco Bell is denying this.  Yep!  Can you believe it!?  Taco Bell is
 actually saying its food is ok to eat!  Who would have thought that's what
 they'd say?  For my part I was totally fooled.  I just assumed like many of
 you, that they'd go right along with it an be like "Yeah, our food is
 dirty, unsafe, and full of bugs.  So?  What's the matter?  Can't handle a
 little RISK when you eat?" We assumed wrong though, they tried to save
 their image and profits by denying the whole story.  Yep, I never saw
 that one coming.  It's a good thing that made the news!  It's a good thing
 there is nothing more important going on in the world that those precious
 column inches could have been used to tell us about.  Thank you, mister
 newspaper company!
