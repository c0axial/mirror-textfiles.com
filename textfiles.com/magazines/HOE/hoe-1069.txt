			Frank E. Lee's guide to 
				ANSI CODES
				with the JEDI MIND FORCE(*)

	(* as seen in ep IV, V, and VI! Fuck that mitichlorian shit!) 

				CURSOR CONTROL 

 If you wanted to move your cursor to a screen coordinant, ordinarily you
 would use ESC[X;YH or ESC[X;Yf, with X representing the vertical access
 and Y representative of the horizontal. Now, a lot of people would
 endorse this method of coordinant positioning, but I don't. Fuck that.
 That's the way the thugs do shit.

 I'm a jedi. 

 I write ANSI with my mind. 

 ESC[#A might be a good way to move things upwards, with # representing
 the number of lines you want to move your cursor upwards, but I'm no
 pussy. I do that shit without thinking; the nature of the force is to
 exist in a state of thoughtless contemplation. There is only do or do
 not. It's a good way to escape the modern trappings of the self. Peace
 out to Lucas for teaching us about this great way.

 ESC[#B will take you as far down the screen as you want to go, but it
 takes you even further down; your soul and very essence, which is a vital
 and true part of the force, is lost each time you code ANSI without using
 the force.  If you use programs like TheDraw you are losing the force.
 ANSI should be made representative on the screen with your life essence.

 ESC[#C moves your cursor to the right without moving lines. this is
 similar to going over to the dark side of the force. The Jedi does not
 lose any of his potency or power, but his focus and mode of being shifts.
 This should be noted as a shift for the ill.

 ESC[#D moves the cursor to the left. Picture Darth Vader at the end of
 return of the jedi. He has returned to the force. His cursor has moved
 left. And he has moved it with his mind. Not with any weak utility like
 TheDraw. 

 Like I said I am a Jedi. 

 I learned the way of the Jedi through pure dedication to the art of ANSI.
 While other ruffians were busy indulging in such silly groups as ACiD and
 ELCiD and iCE, I rejected their lower case is and embraced the force.
 Thank you Lucas.  Thank you for showing me a way other than this
 capitalistic mentality that torments. With the force you want and there
 is. A blue half shaded square is wished and it appears. IT is the
 ultimate mixture of the ordinary and the obscenely powerful. Your place
 in the force becomes trailed across the scene in a hi bit mixture of
 madness and merriment.

 I don't draw ANSI of anything but jedi. Other characters are lame. Not to
 say jedi is the only good thing to draw ANSI of. Just that other
 characters of similar popular culture standing are lame, due to their
 lack of philosophical and sociological import.

 ANSI. You gotta love it. JEDI. You must embrace them. The two go together
 in the only way possible; an artistic expression of the force.
