        A MUSICAL PLAY in one small act.

        (The scene - A courtyard, urban New York street in front of an
 apartment building.  The stage should be set up like this:

			Window            Window
			Window 	 	  Window
			Window            Window
			
                                 Street

        Where each level of window is off the stage, and contains one
 member of the cast.  The street level is the stage itself, where the
 rape and muder takes place.  The windows are were the dialoge takes
 place.)

        (A scream off-stage.  Enter Katherine Genovese and her
 attacker.  Her attacker throws her to the ground, and begins to rape
 her.  Lights turn on in all the windows, and the members of the cast
 move to them to see the action outside.  They see the rape/murder going
 on and turn off their lights.  However, their silouettes remain
 illuminated, allowing us to realize they are still watching the action
 like the ghouls and jackals they are.)

        (The attacker takes out his knife, and begins to stab
 Genovese brutally while still raping her.  One of the silouttes,
 preferably a female one, puts her hand to her mouth in horror.  But
 does nothing.)

        (The top left window lights up, and we see the apartment of
 Average Joe.  It's tastefully decorated for a blue-color guy in the
 nineteen sixties.)

        (Joe's song is sung over the screams of Genovese, which are
 audible throughout the entire play and all the songs.) 

                                 Joe:
                               (verse) 
		Well, now, I'm just your Average Joe.
		Breaking my back to earn some dough.
                I work all day, I sleep all night.
		Weekends come, I like beer and fights.
		I don't want any trouble no time, 
		so I mind my business and commit no crime.

			     (chorus)
                It ain't my fault she's getting raped.
		It ain't my fault the world isn't fair.
		I bet it's her low-cut blouse and mini-skirt; 
                Maybe it's her long sultry hair.
                It ain't my fault she's getting raped.

                Now, I'm just the Average Joe.
                I'm not no Superman.
		Now her trouble ain't my trouble, though
		I wish they'd hurry and end the show, 
		'cause I gotta use the can.

			      (chorus) 

		Oh, please, hurry up and stop!
		I can't hardly stand the pain!
		The piss'll be running down like rain!
		And the shit'll be doing a flop!
		Hurry and die! 
		Hurry and die!

			      (chorus)

        (The lights in Average Joe's apartment dim down to the previous
 silouette lighting, and the lights in the window next to his turn up.
 Concerned Mother take the stage, and sings her blessed heart out.)

                                Mother:
                                (verse) 
		I certainly hope our children aren't exposed, 
		No, to them, it most definitely should be closed!
		This is adult entertainment only
		And of such an indepth nature certainly uncommonly!
		Keep it away from their little eyes!
		This is for grown gals and guys!
		

				(chorus)
		Oh, I do love these violent things!
		But for our Children, no way, unnuhh!
		Stab her in the stomach, don't stop!
		Oh, all this blood and rape makes me pop!
		This show certainly features divine beings!
	
				(verse)
		Certainly, I love the fight scene! 
		And the love scenes, they're really keen!
		But they're for us! 
		For the children, I recommend "Toby, The Talking Bus!"	
		Keep this to ourselves, and we'll never have to share
		or worry about their precious little minds being ensnared!

				(chorus)
	
				(verse)
		Some parents aren't as good as me! 
		Don't keep their children under lock and key!
		So I do the job for them, 
                I play the role of Mother hen.
		Blood and guts, that's for me!
		And not little Dorothy!

				(chorus)

        (Again, the lights dim, revealing the old silouette.  The window
 directly beneath her lights up on the apartment of Crazed Sicko.  The
 room is in disarray.)

                                  Sicko:
                                 (verse)
		I know that girl, know her real well!
		When I grabbed her ass, she told me to go to hell!
                Well, it serves the bitch right.
                Shouldn't have put up a fight.
		Could have been on a date with me tonight.
                Instead some guy is giving her an indepth tour of
                vivisection.
                Yeah, he's doing a real nice job of inspection.
		Well, I hope you enjoy it, whore!
		I hope your head likes that cement floor!
		Give her a thrust for me!
		
				(chorus)
		Oh, I hope you're happy now!
		Oh, I hope you're happy now!
		He's kicking your ass real hard!
		Raping you and stabbing you with a metal shard!
		Oh, I hope you're happy now!
		
				(verse)
		Kill her! Kill her! Show her death!
		I wonder if could have been my breath...
		Why did she reject me? 
		Aren't I good enough for she? 
		Well, doesn't matter now! 
		Wouldn't never want to date a girl 
		whose stomach is a gaping swirl 
		of blood and flesh!
		Perhaps they'll put you back together with wire mesh!

				(chorus)
				
				(verse)
		Eat some death now, little slut!
		Why, why, oh why wouldn't you lick my walnut?
                Maybe I'll come down and get you after he's gone.
                Maybe I won't.
		I think I saw something like this in a porn.
                A lot of fun it was.
		Ah, screw you, I hope you die... just because!
	
				(chorus)

        (The same time-honored routine.  The window next to sickos
 illuminates, and reveals Timid Geek.  His apartment is impeccable.)

                                Geek:
			       (verse)
                Kitty, you're my friend.
                Stick together to the very end.
		We've laughed together, danced together, 
                even talked about secret things together.
		But how, how can I go down there  
		and help you? What if he sticks the knife here?
		Or here? Or here? Or anywhere on my body?
                Something I wouldn't like to hear, that melody.

				(chorus)
		Kitty, I want to save you! 
		But, Kitty, I'm too scared!
		That huge man is much feared!
		Kitty I want to save you! 
		But, Kitty, I'm much too scared!

				(verse)
		Oh, just hold on, till the police arrive!
		Oh, if you can only just stay alive!
		They'll help you, and I'll be pleased!
                Then my burden will be eased.
                I don't want to call them, however.
		In self-presevation, I'm a true believer!
		What if he found out I made the call?
		He'd nail me to the wall!

				(chorus) 
	
				(verse)
		I'll miss you Kitty, I'll miss you dearly!
		I place a flower on your grave yearly!
		You've been a real good friend!
		But now, you've met the bitter end!
		I can tell by that huge pool of blood,
		that's becoming a big red flood,
		you're going to die soon! 
		See you on the other side of the moon!

				(chorus)

        (the same.  The window beneath him lights up and reveals Crime
 Oriented Old Woman.  She sings her song.)
		
                                Old Woman:
                                 (verse)
		What's this city coming to?
		When people get murdered in the street?
		Their blood gets on my shoe!
		And dirties my feet!
		What if it happened to me? 
		Where would the police be?
		Oh dear me, the crime boggles the mind!
		It's an act against human kind! 
		That poor girl, how badly I feel for her			
	
				(chorus)
		This city is a pit!
		I really hate it!
		I'm scared in my own house!
		Like a little mouse!
		This city really is a pit! 

				(verse)
		Murder and rape is just the least of it!
		Why do the police permit?
		They even stole my golden necklace!
		Broke in and took it right off my face!
		Thieves! They took my necklace! 
		And stole everything else in the place!
		Everything I worked and slaved for!
		They wouldn't even let me talk to the prosecutor!
		Too busy for petty theft, they said!
		I'd like to smack his head!

				(chorus)

				(verse)
		My daughter was mugged the other night!
		Gave us such a fright!
		Getting so that girls can't even walk outside.
		No one has any more civic pride!
		No cares that these things happen!

				(chorus)

        (the same.  The window next to her lights up and reveals Pissed
 Off T.V. Guy.  The most prominent thing in his apartment is a huge
 television.)

                                T.V. Guy:
                                 (verse)
		I wish she'd shut up!
		I want to watch the t.v.!
		I wish he'd speedup!
		Her screams are really starting to bother me!
		I can't hear what the t.v. is saying!
		I can't hear what the bands are playing!

				(chorus)
		Her screams piss me off!
		She's too loud!
		oh, great, now I've got to deal with her blood-choked coughs!
		Of my t.v., I'm really proud!
		Too bad I can't hear it over this wailing whore!
		I'd like to break her head on the floor!
