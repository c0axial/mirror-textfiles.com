        here we stand, two underachieving college students for whom the word
 fuck is one of the most important words in their daily vocabulary.  once
 upon a day corey and i were discussing people's addictions and other out-of-
 control vices when he suggested that we sure do say the word fuck an awful
 lot.

        "dood, we say fuck alot."

        "yes, we sure as fuck do"

        it was true, this word emerged from our mouths about once every five
 minutes.  it flowed like water, this bothered us...a little.  it was decided
 that we should try to stop saying this holiest of words, at least for a
 while.  we knew this would not be an easy task, so we prepared beforehand.

        "ok, we are starting at 1."

        "1? ok."

 [12:54]

        "whoah, what the fuck."

        "fuck dood, did u see that fucking shit?"

        "i sure fucking did"

 [12:55]

        "ahh, five minutes!"

        "fuck!  fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck!"

        "yeah yeah fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckee fuck!"

        this purging continued for the remaining five minutes.  we said fuck
 about once for every time that we had said it in the past, ever.

 [1:00]

        *nervous glances, tv watching, trite conversation*

 [1:04]

        "hahaha that was fucking f..."

        "ahahahahahahaha...you dumb bastard!"

        "FUUUUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK FUCK@!#)@*)*@$"

        "AHAHAHAHAHAHA...you silly f*cough*"

        "Ahhhh my god...FUCK@#!# FUCK@$(*&@!#"

        "hehehehe shut up already..."

        "aww...ok, how about we start at 1:15?"

        "NO, you screwed up already...not my problem, shithead."

 [1:24]

        "...so i'm like 'what the fuck?!@?'"

        "ahahah you said it!"

        "ahh shit...guess it was my turn eh?"

        "i guess..."

        "ehh, shut up...at least i made it longer than you, bastard!"

        after this exercise, we both say fuck as much as any and every
 college student should.  sure, we are just as broke as any other student
 here, but god damn it, we sure do say fuck a whole lot!
