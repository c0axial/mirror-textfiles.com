 The Anger of Turnips
 --------------------

        Since this is the seventy third day, i think i am a turnip. you do
 not like turnips? soft effervescent dew covered roots of triumph? perhaps
 you do not understand the turnip mind, with it's gleeful complacency,
 growing in splendor of green and dirt. it does not suffer from jealousy or
 paper cuts, only from yellowness. Yellow is an evil thing, taking it's joy
 and screaming from minds and chains. All of this is blatant, and sometimes
 obvious. wishing is a waste of time. the wings never grow and there you are,
 with sadness and no wings. caffiene and growth do not make it go away. only
 the color yellow is able to alleviate the boredom. do you listen to this? do
 you listen to the yellow speech of your wishes? Its poetry is that of
 oysters, seeing light through my eyes.

 Love and Rocks
 --------------

        Shiny black stones are love. Stronger than death and folly, the
 source of strength, they break in moonlight, and blind by day. all of the
 stories they tell are madness but the madness is that which is like anger
 the most. zurp zurp go their stories, until you are crazy with the pleasure
 of the sky and the wind. it is no wonder that lizards hide underneath stones
 with all of this storytelling contaminating the very sand. magic surrounds
 the stone, and the lizards run when moonlight sparks the spell. vanity and a
 striving after wind, are the lizards. a tower, a hind, a doe, is the shiny
 black stone. such problems can never be fixed, not by any number of zurping.
 but zurp zurp it goes, until it is too full to continue.

 Reality's Edges
 ---------------

        marbles are like reality. they are small, and insignificant until
 broken, when they cut you unless you are careful. will you brave them? will
 you take them up and hold them, coddling and rocking, until you have lost
 them in your complacency? your fat surrounds this. it is no wonder i can no
 longer distinguish between this and the iron ones.

 Angels and Darkness
 -------------------

        how very like a dark angel of light, but without wings. how do these
 colors affect me so? bright darkness, shining across a sunlit field, the
 black brighter than the sun. dark light, illuminates my heart but clouds
 my mind. how can i think clearly when my mind is stormy weather? a tactile
 thunder, a darkening lightning, and a broken black stone, so fragile to
 begin with. my arbitrary symbols foretelling my soul. i drank my willpower,
 and drowned my wishes, but got a dream which an angel stole.

 [SOME POETRY!]

 Random Angel Song
 -----------------

 obsession cured, just a new random angel
 i hate that beauty but i want it the same
 i think this to you but i know you don't hear me
 and im groping the ground I worship anyway
 it could have been someone or anyone else
 but october and vodka equaled up to you
 this isnt the first or the last time it happens
 so i know im not worthy of princes or truth
 my painful addiction, no withdrawl immenent
 waiting to prove that ive something to prove
 living is only a constant reminder
 that it happened it happened it happens to you
 and i lost what i had just to get what i wanted
 what i wanted turned out just to be what i lost
 ive bartered these two and theres no coming back now
 the randomness never could equal the truth

 To the Oblivious Lord of My Dreams
 ----------------------------------

 I say it doesn't affect me
 I say you never believed
 I say I won't think twice of it
 I say it's him that I need
 I say I want him forever
 I say I want you tonight
 I say I don't think it's wrong
 I say I don't know what's right
 I say that I feel so happy
 I say I'd never betray
 I say I'll stay with him gladly
 But it's not what I want to say.
