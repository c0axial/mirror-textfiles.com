	Propaganda and outright lies have been used by the United States
 government to keep its citizens in the dark about the real facts about
 marijuana since it was first banned and caused it to become a Schedule I
 drug (one with no known medical benefits) in 1970.  This hypocrisy is
 apparent in the comparison of two brochures published by the National
 Institute of Drug Abuse; "Marijuana: Facts for Teens (Revised)" and
 "Marijuana: Facts Parents Need to Know (Revised)."

	"Marijuana: Facts for Teens (Revised)" presents the idea that
 marijuana usage is limited among teens.  They lead us to believe that
 "contrary to popular belief most teenagers have not used marijuana and never
 will" and use survey statistics to show "only about one in five 10th
 graders... are current marijuana users... (and) fewer than one in four high
 school seniors is a current marijuana user."  This is mixed with misplaced
 quotes from former users and written in the "popular" vernacular -- they
 think we call joints "nails" for some reason, but at least they get "blunt"
 right.  According to the brochure "most young people smoke marijuana because
 their friends or brothers and sisters use marijuana and pressure them to try
 it."  What?!

	The only similar information in "Marijuana: Facts Parents Need to
 Know (Revised)" is the off-base slang terms for weed; did you know that a
 blunt smoked with a 40 oz. bottle of malt liquor is called a "B-40?!"  No
 wonder our parents can't talk to us.  Although this booklet used the same
 survey statistics, they were presented in a much darker light.  They warn
 that 21% of 10th grade students and 24% of 12th graders currently have the
 hots for Mary Jane (1 in 5 and 1 in 4, remember) and that overall marijuana
 use has increased by about 72 percent.  Lifetime marijuana use has doubled
 among 8th- and 10th-grade students, and increased by a third among high
 school seniors because of "a decrease in antidrug messages in the media, an
 increase in prodrug messages through the pop culture, and a lack of
 awareness among parents."  Hmmmm, really now, I thought the other book said
 that most teens wont ever try pot?  That's because a hair less than 50% of
 12th graders have tried weed or hash at least once...I guess 50.00000000001%
 is technically "most."

	Both booklets warn that the potency of weed has increased over the
 last thirty years (yea!) and tell you all the things you can't do while
 you're fucked up.  One girl was quoted from the video "Marijuana: What Can
 Parents Do?" as saying "When I would sit down and try to figure something
 out it was like my brain would stop working."  No driving, walking, or
 thinking for that matter, all you can do is laugh at shit, be dumb, cause
 crime, do harder drugs, and have sex with AIDS infected people.  Sounds like
 fun....well the first two anyway.
