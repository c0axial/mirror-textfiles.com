        The boy stood on the street corner, his head held up high.  He
 looked into the sun, like his parents always told him not to, and let
 out a yell.  No one cared.  This was the middle of New York City's
 Grenwich Village and weird stuff was normal.  He flagged down a taxi
 and directed the driver to take him to Times Square.  It was about two
 O`clock in the afternoon of December 31, 1999.  He was headed to watch
 the ball drop for the first time, and a little more.  He arrived about
 three, traffic being heavey on New Year's Eve.  He had nine hours to
 wait, so he started talking to other people standing there.  The crowd
 was already growing this early in the day.  He met three girls that were
 quite good looking, but his macking skills were below par.  He ran into
 an old school teacher of his, and a few people he knew from school.

 He was having a good time drinking and reminiscing with his friends at
 about ten-thirty, when he suddenly realized what he ahd come to do.  He
 excused himself and made his way to the icon that was the New Year's
 Ball.  He had spent a full year studying the lay out and planning, just
 for tonite.  He sneaked past security, made sure he wasn't seen by anyone
 just yet, and stood at the bottom of the flag pole the ball would drop
 down on.  As midnight approached he crouched down in front of the ledge
 in front of him, and awaited the ball.

        "3... 2... 1... HAPY NEW YEARS !!!"

        As soon as he heard the roar go up from the crowd he stood up.
 Within secods the crowd was hushed.  He stepped onto the ledge, and
 proceeded to do a perfect Swan Dive off of the building.  It was to be
 his only accomplishment in life.  He was the first victim of the new
 millenium, and he was making sure the whle world knew it.  As he fell,
 thoughts flashed through his mind, images... sounds... feelings... and
 then he hit.  He enver felt it though.  He found himself in a field of
 flowers.  He sat up and stared at the sun, just like his parents always
 told him not to do.
