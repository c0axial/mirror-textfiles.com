	As you may be aware, hoe 937 by Angeldust turned out to be a
 plagiarized.  I brought this to the attention of the editor, and he
 promptly changed it to include a proper attribution to the true author of
 the piece. He also gave me the email address of the author so that I
 could inform her that she was a legface. This is a transcript of our
 correspondance.

 Neil,
 Four questions:
 What is a legface?
 Why are you emailing me?
 How did you get my email address?
 And who are you?

 A person with a leg for a face! Isn't that crazy! I know that I can't
 think of anything crazier than that.

 To tell you that you are a legface.

 not that i feel i am obligated to explain this to you....i found that
 quote written in my best friend's handwriting in my notebook.  when i
 asked her if i could use it for something, she made no mention of the
 fact she had gotten it from someone else.  i, having no knowledge of who
 howard p lovecraft is, did not have any reason to question whether she
 had composed it herself.  i had no reason to think i was plaigarizing.

 At the very least you should have given your friend due credit.

 look she said i could use it ok.  she saw me type it, she saw me send it.
 she was sitting next to me in study hall when i did it.  she told me she
 didnt mind.  i didnt have reason to suspect i was doing anything wrong.
 anyhow, correct credit was given, and my ignorance made known to me. is
 that not good enough for you?

 I was satisfied when I called you a legface, if truth need be told.
