Grumble. Grumble.

Clearly the most difficult riddle to ever exist in a video game is that
little "Grumble. Grumble." guy in the Legend of Zelda. You know the one. In
the first quest before level 8. There's that little guy sitting in a room all
by himself. And if you stab him he doesn't die, he just shoots fireballs out
at you from those two little glowing flames next to him. The only way to get
past was to give him the bait. That little clump of red meat on a bone served
no other practical purpose but in this one place. Sure it was a fun toy to
play around with, but so is mercury.  That brings me to the point. First,
there is.um.I guess there is no point. Just nostalgia. So what I'm saying is
"Remember Zelda? Wasn't that cool? Weren't we cool back then when we finally
beat Gannon and stabbed through the fire to get the princess? Yeah, we were.
We were cool in our innocent youth. We were brash nogahide cowboys on a quest
for justice!" Ok. That's all. The End.
