        once apon a time there was a girl named mary.

        and then there were a bunch of silly faeries!

        they all were very happy because they found the monkeys stash of
 yummy cookies!

        then after they ate the cookies, they ran fast into the dark alley of
 Habiliqua, and fell into a hole!  the faeries had wings, as all faeries do,
 and they fluttered up high with the power of the cookies!

        but little did they know!  the evil gooblans where after them!  they
 went on their happy flight though, traveling to cookie land!

        soaring higher and higher, they soon realized that something was
 quick on their tail!

        "OH NO!" they cried, "Soon, we will be eaten alive by the evil
 gooblans!  We must fly faster!!!"

        but there was nothing they could do because their wings were so small
 and their hair and purple and black and there was nothing they could do.
 the gooblans continued to get closer and closer untill all of a sudden they
 got the cookie land!

        not only did the gooblans steal all the cookies, and eat the faeries,
 they also ate the girl named Mary!
