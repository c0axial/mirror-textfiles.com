        Suddenly I appear -- a mere boat in the murky waters that make up the
 Tanzene, also known as the Cobra Triangle.

        I am slightly unfamiliar with the controls of this boat, but I
 quickly figure out how to accelerate, and, more importantly, shoot.

        I'm not at all unfamiliar with the use of guns -- in my travels from
 the jungles of Brazil (Mission Contra) to the hell of medieval Transylvania
 (mission Castlevania), I have been forced to use weapons to achieve my
 goal -- destroy evil everywhere.

        I am not usually told much about my destination or my goals.  They
 usually become apparent later.  Sometimes much later.  Mission Cobra
 Triangle is no different in this regard -- all I know is that I am in the
 waters of the Tanzene, and that there are lots of other boats around me that
 I am apparently supposed to be shooting.  And don't forget the gun turrets
 on the river banks.

        I'm a little rusty -- I often ram my boat head on into the banks --
 or worse, into another boat.  Sometimes I even lose control long enough to
 travel straight through the path of a bullet, damaging my already-weak boat.
 
        Soon after I departed I find what we like to call a "one up".  I
 already come equipped with three lives, but finding the mythical "one up"
 allows me an extra chance at survival.

        The "one up" was not enough, I soon found out.  The boat's controls
 were horrid.  and I often found myself, like I said, ramming into the banks.

        After making a wild turn and losing track of where I was going, I
 passed some finish line -- what *was* the point of this adventure?

        I soon passed into another level of the river.  This one was confined
 to a much smaller area, and my task was to take water mines from a squared
 off area, and drag them to another squared off area to detonate them.
 Sounds easy, right?

        Well, it turned out to be pretty damned difficult.  They had a boat
 guarding the mines, and it chased me and often grabbed them back from me.
 The worst part was that this boat apparently had bulletproof siding on it,
 as no matter how many shots I fired at it, I couldn't make a dent in it.

        I was able to safely detonate one mine, but the second time I made it
 into the detonation square, I was not so lucky.  The mine detonated and took
 my boat with it.

        Now I am back at base, awaiting another assignment....
