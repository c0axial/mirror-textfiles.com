 <TITLE> THY BACKGROUND </TITLE>

 In the quaint town of Northern Metamora, life is odd.  GLYNIS, the local
 sweetheart, and QUAREX, the local fire chief, have had a stormy sequence as
 of late.  QUAREX, feeling jilted by GLYNIS, is unhappy, and is futher
 unhappy by the news that MURMUR, the dapper gentleman from the North, has
 begun a relationship with GLYNIS.  FEIVAL is the best friend of GLYNIS.
 Meanwhile, JAMESY, a local porn star, and his female friend YUMMAS, also a
 porn star, along with MURMUR, are entertaining MOGEL, visiting from the
 Orient.

 This saga opens in a park.   A fork is here.

 A park.  It is a dark and stormy night.  QUAREX is here, with a lightning
 rod and some toads.  QUAREX is wearing a nazi war helmet and sunglasses.

 QUAREX:  I beseech of thee, bring me fire, so I mayest enact upon my quest!

 TAO and vanir enter the park.  TAO is wearing all black, and vanir is
 wearing a sombrero.

 TAO:     Greetings Brother QUAREX.
 vanir:   i'm CRAZY#^@%#&^%&  look at me@^&#&%#  CRAZY#^%&$@&%#@&^$
 QUAREX:  SATAN.

 JUKE enters the park, surrounded by fireflies.

 QUAREX:  JUKE, I respect your opinion.
 JUKE:    Thank you, QUAREX.
 QUAREX:  JUKE, should I be angry?
 JUKE:    No, QUAREX.
 vanir:   CUH-RAY-ZEE^#@$%&@^&$&^#%@&
 QUAREX:  JUKE, I do not respect your opinion.
 TAO:     Let us all be calm.

 Everyone in the park walks to the fountain in the middle of the park, where
 the fish KREEG swims around.

 QUAREX:  I hate fish.
 vanir:   I EAT DA FISHIE#&@^$^&T

 vanir eats KREEG.  The park is vacated.
