        I don't think I've ever felt this way before.
        And most of the time, unfelt, I feel sore.
        Because people are always bugging me for more.
        They don't know what I think down to the core.

        I'm sick of rhyming.  Fuck you.

        No, fuck *you*. 

        What, you think I'm doing this for my health?  Maybe my mental
 health.  Do you think I have a mental health plan or something?  You stupid
 asshole.

        Come to a conclusion with me.  Respectability has once again become
 an issue.  I thought that maybe, just maybe, I could find someone to fully
 understand.  Maybe, just maybe, I was totally wrong.

        But my fingers are dirty right now, and I'm too drunk to care what
 you have to say.  All I know is that I know, and you don't.  You've never
 known.  When will you know?

        I don't know.

        Come to an assumption with me.  I wonder which one of my friends will
 be buried first.  I wonder which one is my friend.  I wonder which one I
 will bury.

        You don't know, do you?

        Why won't you ever look at me?  Are my questions forever going to go
 unanswered?  I've asked time and FUCKING TIME AGAIN, but there is never a
 direct answer.  Always a run around.  Run around.  Run aground.

        The things that I wash from my mind are always filthy, and are gaped
 incoherently with filthier and scummier beings.  I realized that I'm dirty
 at heart, but honestly, am I really that bad of a guy?

        Lie to me.

        I'm sexy, right?  A god.  big daddy bill

        big bill

        bill

        Cut it down and what do you get?  What do you get?  A four letter
 word that echos in the mind.

        Unless you forget.  But remember who taught you, I did.

        not.

        Wondering with the sound of black noise what the fuck am I talking
 about?  Shut up and hit the pipe, nevermind the fact that your life sits
 next to you.  The life you want.  The life you need.  The life you've
 strived for.  The life that could change your life.  The life that wants
 nothing to do with your life.

        Change my life, just accept it.  Just admit it.  Just embrace it.
 Just--ice it down.

        And who are you anyway to not say a word and completely fuck my
 entire train of thought?  I don't mind the fact that you've derailed me, not
 at all.  The only thing that bugs me is the fact that my train didn't even
 touch yours.  Not a single passenger hurt.  Just a single passenger killed.

        It's all because of one chemical touching others, or a box of
 chocolates or a big silk rose embroidered with all my consideration and all
 the words I could possibly say in one single sentence.  It never mattered to
 you, not enough.  I'm sick.

        I'm so, so sick.  I think I'll fucking puke.

        It never mattered to you how you depressed yourself with endless
 banter of death and hate and fear and lost-lost-love.  It sits in front of
 you now, smiling, always smiling because I'm waiting, always waiting.  I've
 been waiting for so long, though, and I've only got a few... days... left.

        Don't you dare make me move on.  DONT YOU FUcKING DARE!!!!!!!!!!!
 HOW MANY NIGHTS HAVE I LAID AWAKE, JUST CONTEMPLATING A LIFE WORTH LIVING, A
 CRIME NOT WORTH DOING, A SCHOOL WORTH LEARNING FROM, OR A LOVE WORTH
 ANYTHING

        You've made it that way, in your own way.  Without so many words,
 you've turned me down time and time again and without so many words you've
 enticed me over and over again.

        Make up your mind, please.  Just put me in my place.  please.  pretty
 please.

        Because I need sleep now, whether it be eternal or ex-ternal,
 somethings needs to lay down and die.  It won't die.  Much like this file.

        You know who you are.  You know what you've done.  You know what you
 have to do.

        Just DO IT!  JUST DO IT!!!!!

        If you're going to make me a king among men, please, do so fast.

        If you're going to make me a man among king, please, do so fast.

        Either way, just say "fuck it, it's time to pay the piper".  Because
 me being stabbed just isn't enough anymore.

        It never really was, it's just now... I can say it.
