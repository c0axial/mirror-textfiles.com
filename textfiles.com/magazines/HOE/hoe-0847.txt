	From the perspective of all the Weenies, or so others know them as
 the beloved worshippers of the musical talent that is Gene and Dean Ween,
 mastermined into a thing we can only stare in marvel at, that is the band
 Ween, the saying "What's a Ween?" is a shunned upon saying.  

	This saying, in my mind, increased it's popularity when the great
 movie, from the SNL skit involving our SHe, "PAT",  called "It's Pat",
 included the members of the band Ween in all their glory and this line was
 a major line on the part of "PAT".  
	
 <Scene: A Street, Pat approcahing from corner>

	<Blue Van Approches>
	Ween: Hey you were on TV, right?  Your PAT right?
	Pat: Yeah, who's asking?
	Ween: We're Ween.
	
	TAKE NOTICE
	Pat: Woowh, What's a Ween?!?!?!
	TAKE NOTICE

	Ween then expalins the band name and band.  Pat also introduces us
 with another killer line... "Woowh, it is a bummer you got stuck with that
 name!!!"
	
 <End Scene>

	It may have been the movie, then again it may not have been the
 movie.  Who knows the truth to this date, no one.  But when a Weenie
 throws out the question to a new found friend or foe, the question being
 "Do you like Ween" or "Do you listen to Ween" or "Are you a fan of Ween?",
 the response is one, from all not familiar with the band. "What's a Ween?"  

	The only question above, that is capable of obtaining that kind of
 responce is the first one, evem though the chance should be slim.  Buy
 the use of the plural noun and singularity of the "ween", the one being
 asked the question should have enough sense, not to answer in that matter,
 but the saying of the phase "What's a ween?" continues.

	What us Weenies and all alike must keep in mind is the stupidity
 of these people.  As we all know, Ween is one of the most insteresting,
 wierd and talented bands in the musical industry.  We must let all take
 notice to this. 

	When ever we hear this saying, to aknowledge there mishap, we must
 keep in our heads some of the more vulgar and angry ween songs and direct
 them to these sinners, the evil-Anti Weeners.  These songs must include,
 but not only these, there are many more that can be attributed to this
 cause, but the primary ones being 'you fucked up' and 'piss up a rope'.

	Weither it was the movie, or just plain stupidity on these peoples
 parts? I don't know.  Is it the fact that just the name 'Ween' throws
 these people off subject, thinking it is slang for a word that describes
 somthing interwoven with sexual intercourse, I don't know this either.  
 But, Ween is somthing that cannot be handled lightly in this world.  They
 are coming, and but the year 2000, Ween fans will be doubled over
 Deadheads and Phish fans, maybe even N'Sync fans, who knows.  But,  Let
 this be my warning to all of you Anti-Ween's, we are not to be taken
 lightly.

        Maybe there will be a part deu.
