        Ok, kids, it's time for a lesson in Molecular Biology.  It has come
 to my attention that women, in particular have the warped, most fucked up
 logic I have EVER seen in my entire life.  This is based on my experience
 though in a city of about 300,000 so bear with me.  I figure, since
 everything is caused by genes let's assume that you women and your
 warped logic is in fact, genetic.  Now, before we start the lesson let me
 say that Men as well have some pretty screwed up logic some times as
 well; women, though, exhibit this more.  Sorry I'm biased, maybe if I was
 gay it'd be the other way around.  But I'm not, therefore I'm going to
 pick on the female gender.  I called this genetic disorder "The
 Retardation Of Logic" or "RL" (for short) Gene.

        Note: If something proceeds with ^X (x being whatever I choose to
 represent the gene) it means that the X should be in superscript.  (if you
 still don't understand, please, bear with me here.)

        Now, This isn't your ordinary genetic disorder, no.  I've decided
 it would be most logical and probable if this were an "X-linked/Sex
 linked" inheiritance.  This means that the disease itself is carried on
 the "X" chromosome.  (Meaning Females carry it/express it since it's
 located on the x chromosome.  Males can also get this disorder though,
 I'll explain soon enough.)  Now, if you have rudimentary knowledge of
 genetics just browse through this whilst I explain this to anyone else
 who isn't following.  Females are XX, meaning they have two X chromosomes
 which causes them to develop into a female.  Males are XY, meaning they
 have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.  (WOW!)  Just some food for
 thought here: All human beings start out as female.  The Y chromosome
 after a few weeks of conception though releases testosterone that causes
 Testes to form (stop giggling) instead of ovaries.  I could bore you all
 forever explaining how some people who are female in every way are XY.
 But, I won't.  Back to the original point of this little article... Now,
 the disorder I have surmised is a recessive one, this means that you need
 two chromosomes with the disorder's allele/gene to have it show up (for
 females.) but for males only one X with the gene disorder is needed.  Why
 you ask?  Well I would say, but I once again don't want to bore anyone,
 as I hope to catch some people's attention by writing this.  Here's an
 example of how a female who has the disorder.

        A Female who has the disorder (note: there is a difference between
 having the disorder and carrying the disorder) marries a man who doesn't
 have the disorder, what are the chances of their children having the
 disorder?
 
        Let r = the gene that causes the warped logic

        We start off like this:  X^rX^r Multiplied by XY
                                (Female)            (Male)

        Now, we draw a "punett square" and draw the results of the
 breeding.

                         X^r       X^r
                  -----------------------------------
                   X  | XX^r    | XX^r
                  -----------------------------------
                   Y  | X^rY    | X^rY
                  -----------------------------------

        Now that we've done this, these are the results.

        - 0% chance of the female children being a COMPLETE AND TOTAL
          ILLOGICAL SOCIAL WHORE.
        - 100% chance of the male children being total morons and idiots
          who treat their companions like shit.

        If your curious about this or if you think I have made little to
 no sense send me an e-mail and I'll elaborate.   Experiment with different
 combos if you'd like.  (ie. Female who carries the disease but doesn't
 have it, marries a male who has the disease.)  Or just look at this text
 with a vacant face and move on to a more entertaining article.  Either
 way I hope I have in some way gotten someone to think about this in a
 serious manner, I doubt this highly though.  Comments are threats to my
 life are always welcome.   My e-mail address is Janus@Boink.net.
