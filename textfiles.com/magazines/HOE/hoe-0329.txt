        Is Prozac for you?  If you have been seriously asking this
 question, then the answer is probably yes.  As opposed to days past when
 medication was given only to those deeply depressed, today,
 psychiatrists are treating more young, active, healthy people who are
 burdened with anxieties and feel they could be performing at a higher
 level.

        Yes.  Better living for all of us through the benefits of modern
 medicine.  Fluoxetine (aka Prozac), if properly applied, could very
 likely be modern society's only chance at salvation.  It offers two
 things which will be invaluable to our culture once it is implemented
 as a mandatory dietary supplement.  Those two things which hold such
 importance for us are: 1) reduction of sex drive and 2) gradual loss of
 one's unique, more volatile characteristics.

        The reduction of the sex drive and desire to reproduce is
 something which, for obvious reasons, we have been gradually increasing
 our efforts on over several decades.  Through the implementation of
 highly pleasure-restrictive methods of birth control, (i.e. the condom
 and birth control pills), backed with our usual heavy propaganda
 campaigns, we have managed to launch an effective beginning to our much
 larger campaign of achieving zero population growth.  Fluoxetine is the
 next logical step in this campaign.  With our population under the
 influence of this drug, male and "performance anxiety" and female
 resistance of sexual activity will both be greatly increased.  This will
 inevitably lead to an increase in alcohol consumption, which is
 obviously beneficial to our campaign.  Also, for married persons the
 rate of divorce will also be increased, thereby aiding the dissolution
 of the nuclear family and, as it has been stated in so many other
 agendas, reinforcement of the national family.  Prozac's effects will
 eventually be nearly as effective as our usage of infertility drugs, but
 will naturally be thought of as "more humane" if discovered.

        But most importantly, the sexual inhibition of our population
 will naturally result in a drastic reduction of the population growth.
 This is one of our most primary concerns involving the protection and
 control of our population.  When the goal of zero population growth is
 achieved, we will be able to finally make use of our genetic engineering
 programs to standardize and regulate the production of new persons,
 eventually leading to the point where it is no longer necessary to keep
 our population under the influence of our chemical control programs as
 it is presently.

        The second aforementioned benefit which fluoxetine will supply is
 the loss of self which the drug produces.  Under the influence of this
 drug, the specimen's emotions are most often reduced in intensity, under
 proper doses.  This, of course, implies a shift in the specimen's
 psychic state, inevitably resulting in a "moderate" personality type.
 When this effect is moved onto a more massive scale, we are presented
 with a society which is obviously much more easily influenced.  Radical
 activity will be drastically reduced, and the population will be even
 more highly sensitive to our propaganda campaigns than it is presently.
 Not only will this chemical monotyping of our culture provide us with a
 more satisfied and controllable population, but it will also allow our
 future operations to be much more effective.  Once this step is reached,
 the speed at which we approach our goals of standardization and control
 of the population will increase exponentially.  This is why I recommend
 that the implementation of mandatory fluoxetine dosage for the
 population take place as soon as possible.

        I must once again and finally insist that this program be
 seriously considered without hesitation.  It is well known that the
 support of our two political parties diminishes at every election, which
 is an obvious sign that our reduction of action due to "moral issues" has
 been terribly ineffective in maintaining control over our population.
 Fluoxetine is a morally justifiable response to a crisis which is quite
 apparently far bigger than any of our petty moral issues.  The survival
 of our nation and its hold over world politics depends on our immediate
 action.  In closing, I will say this: the chemical controlling of our
 population is beyond politics.  It is beyond economics, and it is beyond
 morals or society as well.  It deals with the prosperity of the human
 race itself.  Without the measures which we are morally obligated to
 take on a regular basis, humankind would obviously succumb to its own
 self-aggression, in the forms of science, religion, and art, leading to
 our imminent dissolution as a culture and the destruction of what we now
 know as society, thus providing the obvious means to an end of human
 happiness altogether.  Consider it.
