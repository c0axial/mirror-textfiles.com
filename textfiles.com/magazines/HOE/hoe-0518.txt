        There once was a red-headed faeiry named Zephyr.  She was named
 after the gentle breeze known as fate that turns people towards their
 destiny.  Zephyr was not your ordinary faeiry who flew around visiting
 flowers, talking with small woodland creatures, and generally running
 amuck by exposing herself to various humans.  No, that was not our
 Zephyr!  Instead, she was part of the quiet type, who added joy to the
 lives of those she chose to touch, simply by sticking her cute little
 red-headed personality in.  However, like all good faeiries, Zephyr did
 expose herself to one human being.  She didn't do it to run a muck; she
 didn't do it for her own personal human slave; she didn't do it cos it
 was easy (you see, exposing oneself to a human was strictly against all
 faeiry policy and morality.  Seems kinda silly actually, but that was
 what was engrained in Zephyr's cute little head).  She did it because
 she fell in love.

        Love is not a feeling that faeiries are supposed to fall prey to -
 especially not faeiries of Zephyr's caliber.  Those like Zephyr were
 supposed to poke in and out of people's lives, her touch unnoticed and
 not asked for; however, Zephyr suddenly found herself in love.

        Oh, what a grand feeling it is!  Zephyr reveled in the sheer joy
 of the feeling itself, not questioning why or what.  Then she began to
 see that love is not perfect, that it hurts, and that the object of her
 affection was human.  Woe was Zephyr.  The human saw the pain in Zephyr's
 eyes; the fear of change from her normal quiet faeiry ways; the pain
 associated with having this feeling cut off from her all her faeiry life.
 The human saw this and did the most remarkable thing - he loved Zephyr
 more!  Unaccostomed to the thought of being loved not just for being a
 cute pixie faeiry, but also for being more human than any faeiry ought
 to be, Zephyr nearly fell off the edge of faeiry existence.  She pulled
 herself together and allowed the human to love her, and loved him back
 everyway she knew how.

    And you know what?  Zephyr became human.
