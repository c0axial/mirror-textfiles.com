        I'm living in a deadhead paradise.  It's like living with my
 mother in the sixties.  Except my mom's got taste.

        Yesterday I was talking to my friend Wendy about what it's going
 to be like next year, when I room with one of my friends, and I came
 close to crying.  "My room will be full of pretty things," I said.
 "There will be no black light posters . . . no Grateful Dead music . . .
 no potheads saying how things are 'sketchy' or 'phatty' . . . no stench
 of patchouli . . . it'll be SO BEAUTIFUL," I said, tearing up.  Wendy
 just nodded indulgently.  "It's okay, Cyn," she said, "It's okay."

        I should probably have had the foresight to write "NO DEADHEADS"
 on my room application.  After all, I am going to Oberlin, liberal oasis
 in the cultural dearth that is Ohio.  (Alums include: Liz Phair, Ben of
 Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, and Dr. Kevorkian.)  But no, silly me, I
 claimed to be tolerant of all musical tastes.  That was before I got to
 listen to everything the Dead has ever performed.  And the bootleg live
 tapes.

        On the bright side, when I'm trying to ignore the dead, at least
 I don't have to listen to her crack pot theories.  The other day I had
 to leave to avoid mocking the six very stoned people sitting in my room
 talking about how AIDs is a government conspiracy.  "But wait!," I
 wanted to say, "Hasn't it occurred to you that your theory is incredibly
 asinine?"

        You can smell the patchouli before you actually enter my room.
 My friends have started actively mocking me about it.  "Hey, Cyn," they
 say, "What's that I smell?  Patchouli?"  "Cyn, I think you smell kind of
 like . . . patchouli!"  To which I reply "Hey.  Fuck you."  But on the
 bright side, I have lost all ability to smell patchouli.  And the room
 smells better than when she doesn't burn incense, because then the odor
 of pot and stale beer emerges.

        Yes, stale beer.  My room is the beer bottle equivalent of an
 elephant graveyard.  On one rare occasion where I was actually cleaning,
 I moved a chair and found two six packs of empty beer bottles that had
 been there apparently for months.  Beer bottles linger in our room for
 days, weeks even.  Sometimes I give in and take them out for her.  I
 think she believes that the Beer Bottle Fairy comes and takes them away.
 Or maybe she thinks someone stole them.  For all I know, she's saving
 them to build a house or something.

        On a positive note, the black light poster did come down, after
 she failed in her attempt to affix it to the ceiling.

        Only a semester to go.  And then my room is a hippy-free zone.
