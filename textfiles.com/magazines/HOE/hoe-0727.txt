        It's 5:38 am.

        I've been up since 7:30 yesterday.

        I'm not sure if I have insomnia, or if I'm just really stupid.

        I'm leaning more towards the latter, as I have to drive two hours at
 8 am to work 9 hours at my friend's record store, then drive two hours back
 here, set up for a party, have a party at 11, drink til 3, sleep all day
 Sunday, not sleep that night, oversleep for work Monday...

        The sun came up when I wasn't looking.  It's pretty weird to look
 outside and suddenly it's light out.

        There was a show last night. All of the bands were more or less
 forgettable.  There was this one band from New York that had a girl singing
 and playing guitar, and I thought she was pretty good looking, although my
 friend begged to differ.  She wasn't "hot" but she was very attractive, I
 thought, and the way she swayed her hips and thrust her pelvis when she
 played guitar layed the basis for my masturbation fantasy last night.

        This movie was on tv at 3am.  Right after Grace Under Fire.  It was
 called Daddy's Girl.  I liked it so much I wrote a review of it on the IMDb.
 Check it out sometime next week at http://us.imdb.com/Title?0116003 .. if
 this movie is ever playing at 3am near you, definitely catch it. It's
 utterly horrible, but in a completely likeable way.

        I just made my second cup of coffee, and this time I put two scoops
 of coffee into it, so hopefully that means double the caffeine or something.
 Hoo boy, it's strong.

        When I was in Europe last month, I spent a lot of time thinking to
 myself, like the guy in Pi.  I would think, "Time to re-evaluate" or
 something and get really depressed.  Being depressed in Europe is pretty
 dumb, especially because I was in Prague or something and more or less
 having a blast.

        But it did get me thinking -- who am I?  What have I done?  What am I
 doing?

        Me Me Me.

        And I mentally degraded myself for a while, until I realized that I
 had done a lot of shit.  It may not have all been successful (or more
 importantly -- at least to me -- appreciated), but I **tried**. And that's
 more than I can say for 99% of the other people I know.

        I had some ideas for this, but then I started writing.  You know how
 it is.

        Fuck it, it's time for a cigarette.
