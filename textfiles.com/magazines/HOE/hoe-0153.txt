        I always found it funny to see people discover something new, like
 some band they never heard of before, and think they're awesome because
 they've found some new 'underground' music.  Well I'm sorry, but IT'S
 NOTHING WE ALL HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE.

        For instance, I had a kid ask me if I knew who "Fugazi" was.  In the
 natural fashion, I replied "yes, they're pretty neat."  But no, the kid who
 asked me this thought that I was lying, because I was not hip enough to have
 heard of them before.  The actual reason that they were mad was because they
 had "missed the Boat."

        Missing the boat is very lame.  I admit, I have missed the boat
 myself several dozen times, but have always been proud when the boat I
 missed crashed.  I have missed the boat for the beginning of DTO, I missed
 the boat for the alpha edition of magic the gathering, and I missed the boat
 when I was 8 years old and had a chance to win 50$, but I was taking a leak.

        Missing the boat is not something fun, but something very
 discouraging.  I bet you all wish you hadn't missed the boat on buying up
 stock in Microsoft when it was a baby.  We've all missed the boat at one
 point or another, just some more than others.
