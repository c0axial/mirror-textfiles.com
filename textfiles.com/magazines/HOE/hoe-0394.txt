 [12-13-93]

        We found out last night that my Aunt Pat got married... last
 April!  So now I guess I have an Uncle Roy.  How weird.

        Luckily, I'm still on good terms with the people from Newspaper.
 They don't know about my story yet, though.  Maybe I'll go tomorrow and
 cover the game, then write the story and give it to Mr. Reiter.  I
 might.  I feel obligated to do it.  If I DO get the courage to go, then
 I'll rejoin Newspaper at semester probably.  Things have been so crazy
 at home these last few months, I'm glad I have a break from at least
 ONE class.  It just depends.  It just depends.

        Well, I'm sick of dwelling on Newspaper.  Since I'll be looking
 back on this in a few years (maybe), I'll list some common everyday
 shit.  Stamps are 29 cents, bread is around 60 cents a loaf, but you can
 find it WAY cheaper.  The average car is about $14-15,000.  Easy Cheese
 in a can is $2.89 on sale.  Fuji film is $2.00 on sale (cheap!!).
 Videotapes range from $3-$5 a pop.  Speaking of pop, it's around 50-60
 cents a can.  CDs average $16-18, cheaper at K-Mart and other shit
 stores.  DAT's are new and aren't common yet.  The Newton hand-held
 computer and A/V palmcorders are among the newest gadgets.

        Well, since I've completely bored myself to death, I will
 digress.  Here are a few of my favorite things (I know, it's corny).  I
 like Dream Theater, Extreme, Lillian Axe, Collision, Babes In Toyland,
 White Zombie, Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, Sepultura, Ozzy, KISS,
 AC/DC, Fight, Cathedral, Pariah, whatever.  I like to watch the
 Simpsons, Real World II reruns, Headbanger's Ball, 90210, Fresh Prince,
 Herman's Head, and SNL reruns.  I could live on Comedy Central and MTV.
 I can't STAND Whiney Houston, Mariah Carey, Walli Collins, Full House,
 Wrestling (which Travis is OBSESSED with), Football, School Spirit,
 country music, my brother at times, and chores.  But I absolutely LOVE
 my cat Taylor and Jamie's cat Ami.  I don't have a boyfriend and guess
 what?  I DON'T CARE!  I have few friends because I told most of them off
 last year.  I think I'm manic depressive but I'm probably just a
 hypochondriac.  Or a pyromaniac.  Or a kleptomaniac.

        Whatever.  Anyway, I just wanted that stuff to be imbedded
 forever.  It's nice to be able to write whatever the hell I want and
 not have to worry about the rest of the world picking it apart.  I can
 wander from subject to subject, use inside jokes, make up a secret
 language, whatever.  No one will ever know!  Ha ha!  Alright, so I'm
 getting slightly carried away.  I don't care.

        Oh, I forgot to write about the pipe bomb Harley Bush set off in
 the Welding room Friday.  Mark Reigler said the blast was huge and
 really, really loud.  I guess I believe it.  That's right up Harley's
 alley.

        Wow!  I really DO have diarrhea mouth.  Or diarrhea HAND.  (So I
 can't spell diarrhea.  Sue me.) (There.  I fixed it.  Fuck you.)

 [25-12-93]

        Well, today was SO boring.  We went to Grandma Shirley's.
 Nobody else came until a split second before we left!  We all got a
 shirt and $20.  We also watched Straight Talk on Showtime.  It was
 pretty cheesy.  Now I'm watching Headbanger's Ball, I have diarrhea
 (REAL diarrhea), and my appetite is nil.

        Well, tomorrow we're taking down all the xmas decorations.
 Monday, we're going to SherRee's and Mike's for a WWF Pay-Per-View.
 Pure chewing enjoyment.  But for now I will enjoy my metal.  I bid adieu
 or whatever the hell it is.

 [3-1-94]

        Hell, this year is off to a boring start.  My nose is runny, my
 throat is pretty good, but I'm bored as hell.  I did my 3 assignments
 in history.  We have this bitchy sub who won't let us do anything but
 Section 2.  Well, excuse me, missy, I already DID Section 2.  In your
 face.  So instead I'm writing in my journal.  Thrill.

        What's been going on lately?  I just don't know.  I've just been
 going through the motions.  I didn't have any make-up work from when I
 was sick before vacation.

        Everyone's been bitching that there shouldn't have been school
 today, or at least a delay.  It snowed a good 3-4 inches yesterday and
 last night, but our resident blonde-wanna-be Superintendant Diana Lam
 didn't do anything.  I hope when she goes in for review this year she
 gets booted out.  She's messed up everything.

        I was thinking of writing a letter to the Newspaper staff
 because they omitted my name from my story.  They DID, however, put in
 Shawn Menadue's name because he wrote the other story on that page.
 I'm not pissed off, but it was a lack of consideration for me.  I DID
 write it, and Shawn Menadue is one guy I'd rather NOT see take credit
 for it.

        I have to blow my nose, but there aren't any tissues.  I guess
 I'll sniffle and suffer.  Oh wait!  There IS a roll of toilet paper.
 I'll be back in a minute.

        Boy, did that ever help.  Now if only everyone else in here who
 are sniffling and suffering would do the same.  Especially Mark
 Reigler.  He's beginning to bother me.  I HATE it when people sit there
 sniffling when there is available nose-blowing things.

        My favorite song is still "Ghost of Winter."  I just realized
 that when I typed it onto my computer disk today.  But I'm wondering
 if "The Day I Met You," also by Lillian Axe, will also become one of
 my favorite songs.  It's so sweet and simple, but totally different
 the moody yet intricate "Ghost Of Winter." They both have excellent,
 EXCELLENT lyrics.  I'll need to think about it, though.  It may just be
 a passing fancy.

        Well, gotta go get busy.  Writing notes to Amy, that is.

 [9-1-94]

        I stayed over at Jen's.  Yesterday, we hooked up her modem and
 hooked up America OnLine.  It was so much fun.  Her handle is Jezus666,
 and her password is "Acid".  I want a computer SO bad, I would kill to
 be hooked up to AOL.  I hope mom gets my application to Family Dollar
 soon so I can get a computer.  I want one more than a car.  I'll save
 $100 from every paycheck.  It'll take me 6 months, I think, but it'll
 be worth it.  I want a Mac Performa like Jen's.  We met this guy on it
 who lives near Chicago who we're going to write to and stuff.  Jen has
 the address, though, so she might say shit about me so he won't write
 me.  I don't mean to be untrusting, but I wouldn't put it past her.  I
 hope he writes, though.  His name is James, and he sounds really cool.

        Today's been a snoozer.  It's SO boring.  Well, I'm going.  I'm
 too bored to write.

 [13-1-94]

        Sorry, sorry, sorry.  I lost my blue pens--this one is borrowed.
 Jen said that James is gay--but I don't know if I should believe her
 or not.  I was over at her house again on Monday because the busses
 were re-routed from the house that blew up, and nobody told us.  We got
 some games that didn't work, and we hooked her rat cages together.  I'm
 babysitting tonight for the Hohmann's as soon as I get home until
 around a quarter to nine.  Talk about boredom.  At least I can make
 some money.

        There's absolutely nothing going on lately.  Except for the
 house blowing up, everything's been pretty quiet.

 [19-1-94]

        Cool, cool, cool.  I haven't written lately because...  we had 2
 extra days off!  We got Monday off--MLK Day--but 2 extra because of
 too-cold weather.  It got -28 I think.  Plus there was tons of blowing
 snow.  It's been nice, too.  I've been babysitting.

        Did I mention that about a week ago or so Eric Johnson came back
 to school?  He seems really great, especially after the car accident he
 was in.

        Speaking of car accidents--this one is sad.  Courtney Egleseder
 died.  I've been going to school with her since first grade!  It's so
 surreal.  We were never close friends or anything, but I grew up with
 her always.  This school year's been just crazy.  There'll probably be
 a big thing about her tomorrow when we have to go back to school.

 [20-1-94]

        Today has been so psychotic.  Everyone's crying and stuff,
 because of Courtney.  Half of our classes, it seems, are going up to
 the Guidance Office and stuff.  It's weird, I knew her, but we weren't
 close or anything.  It's just a tough thing to get used to.  I almost
 start to feel guilty that I'm not crying too, but then I get
 level-headed and think, I'm not GOING to cry because I don't feel
 emotionally compelled to.  I knew her, but not well enough to cry over
 it.  I'm not that sentimental.

        Well, hopefully the rest of the day will be a little more
 uplifting.  Yeah, right.  Today will be Manic Depressants Anonymous.
 Most of the people feeling upset get out of semester tests!  Oh well.
 I'm sure they'll have to make it up.  They're having a hard enough
 time as it is.

        This morning on the bus, I talked to Arb.  He was actually being
 sweet, as compared to his usual egotistic, everyone-wishes-they-were-me
 attitude.  I'm STILL wondering if he's going out with Jenny White
 (Weitz, whatever).  I never see them together anymore, but I'm not going
 to assume anything.

        I biffed this morning.  I was crossing the street to get to the
 bus stop (where I swear I almost froze to death) when I slid and landed
 smack on my butt, knee, and elbow.  I didn't make any deal out of it,
 though.  I wasn't injured, and neither were my clothes, so I'm fine.

        I'm so bored.  There's nothing to do and nothing to write about.
 Well, James isn't gay after all.  Jen said he said his brother was
 screwing around with the computer, so he's not really gay.  Later.

 [28-1-94]

        Yesterday I was talking to Amy Jordan, and Erin Flowers pulled
 another shitty.  Erin wrote "I Love Josh" on Amy's assignment notebook.
 No big deal.  Then, she wrote underneath, "by Erin" and said to Amy,
 "Well, I didn't want people to think you finally found someone."  If I
 would have been there, she would have been kissing some pavement,
 that's for damn sure.  But Amy controlled herself and just said, "Way
 to go, Erin.  Boost my confidence there." I think I would have been a
 little less friendly.  Erin just thinks she's so big because she has a
 boyfriend.  She keeps trying to rub it in our faces and make us feel
 bad, but we're not jealous at all.  Who would be jealous of someone
 with no self-esteem and no respect for other people?  I'm GLAD I'm not
 her or even remotely like her.  I'm glad I DON'T have a boyfriend,
 because I'd be afraid I'd end up like she'll be after she and Josh
 break up--no friends, because she acted like such a priss.

        All I have to say is that if Erin says anything around me or
 even TO me, I'll cut her down to size so fast her head will spin.  I am
 a grade-A certified bitch.  And some people just deserve the full,
 royal treatment.

        (later)

        Luckily, lunch went smoothly today.  Although Erin did remark to
 me for eating salad.  She said, "You're eating a FRIDAY salad?" (by
 Friday they're usually pure brown.) I said, "Hey, it's better than
 the rest of the stuff up there." She said, "Would you rather die after
 eating something healthy or would you rather die after eating something
 good?" I just said, "This is the only good thing up there.  The rest is
 gross school food." Why the hell should she care what I eat?  And she
 made absolutely no point.  If I had been eating half a cake and a bucket
 of lard, I could see why she would criticize me (even though it would
 STILL be none of her business).

        I hope I get to stay over at Jen's tonight.  I snuck my disk out
 of the Write Place again so I can show her Summerland.  I finished it!
 It's pretty gnarly and neat-o.  I hope Jen likes it.  If she doesn't,
 she can suck the dick I don't have.  Maybe, sometime in the future,
 I'll come up with a big, huge program that's really nifty.

        I am so bored.  I'm in history.  Hell, I'm always bored.  Why
 shouldn't I be?  Of course, I shouldn't inflict this boredom upon
 others.  I will go!
