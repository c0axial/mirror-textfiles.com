        as any other freak,  i like twisting words and taking things out
 of context.  i find pleasure in nothing else but seeking potential
 sexually oriented nursery rhymes.  i actually went through the trouble
 of searching for websites containing the works of mother goose in order
 to make her look like a pervert,  because in the end,  we are all
 perverts.  there is no such thing as 100% pure and innocent.  today's
 society practically revolves around sex. what follows is basically quotes
 from mother goose nursery rhymes taken way out of context, as i
 previously mentioned.

 !!========================================================================!!

 "And he'll beat you, beat you, beat you,
 And he'll beat you all to pap,
 And he'll eat you, eat you, eat you,
 Every morsel snap, snap, snap."
				-- "baby, baby, naughty baby"

	in my humble opinion,  this is the perfect example of our
	beloved mother goose subtlely introducing the concept of S&M to
	innocent young children.


 "That's the way the money goes.
 Pop! goes the weasel."
				-- "pop! goes the weasel"

	i seriously do not feel the need to elaborate on this one.


 "...They all ran after a farmer's wife,
 Who cut off their tails with a carving knife.
 Did you ever see such a thing in your life, ..."
				-- "three blind mice"

	this certainly must have been lorena bobbit's inspiration,  also,
	the hint of beastiality adds color and spice to this well-known
	nursery rhyme.  good work mother goose!
	

 "Rub-a-dub dub, 
 Three men in a tub. 
 And who do you think they be?"
				-- "rub-a-dub, dub."

        now that... was sick. (i honestly have nothing against
        homo/bisexuality), but hey, it's more material!  and for the fuck
        of it, i was kind of hoping those three men would be gavin
        rossdale, david usher and ethan hawkes.  but that's my opinion.


 "I love little pussy, 
 her coat is so warm, 
 and if I don't hurt her 
 she'll do me no harm."
				-- "i love little pussy"

        ok. this simply reeks of pedophilia.  i'm not exactly sure if
        this is one of mother goose's nursery rhymes,  but it was on the
        same page as all the others,  so nyah.

 !!========================================================================!!

        anyhow,  i think i have proven my point.  mother goose is a
 pervert.  with that said and repeated,  you are now free to scram.  but
 remember -- respect yourself,  protect yourself,  safe sex.  (by the way.
 yes, i am very well aware that it would probably be better off locked up
 in a nice white padded cell).
