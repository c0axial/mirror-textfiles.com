        So, the other day I was wandering the open space of the ol' WWW,
 looking for some new exciting knowledge, or maybe entertainment.  What I
 stumbled upon was so magnificent that my very words do not do it justice:

        HuNNiE's HoT SpOt.

        It has been said that there is nothing wonderful to be seen on the
 web; well, my dear readers, this is no longer true, for there exists
 HuNNiE418 and she has a web page!  The awe-inspiring beauty of her words
 makes my heart flutter and my head light with wonderment.  It has been said
 of Theodore Sturgeon that "his very words can squeeze your heart until your
 life aches"..  Obviously Harlan Ellison did not know what he was talking
 about and must have been ignorant to the prose of HuNNiE418; poor soul.

        But, I feel enlightened by her wisdom as I reread the text of her
 page when I am sad, when I wake up in the morning, when I rejoice, and in
 times of despair. It fills me the inspiration I need to live my life.
 Hunnie is not only a role-model for me, but I rever her as a goddess.  She
 has delivered unto me a holy 5 commandments.  I recite them daily, and form
 my goals around them:

        5.  i Am cUTe 

        There is no cute one but the one cute HuNNiE.

        4.  iM mE iF u SeE Me oN....i LoooovE tO ChAt :)*~

        Add HuNNiE418 to your AOL Buddy list.

        3.  JusT cHill

        Ah, simple wisdom.

        2.  Get HomE aRouNd 1 aM

        The life of HuNNiE must be the life of night owl.

        1.  ....~*~*~FLIRT!!~*~*~......
    
        Someday, I hope to be a recognized by the goddess herself, for my
 good work as a missionary.  I will know that heaven will have descended upon
 me, and on one of my many visits to the page, I see "Laja Ajna" listed as
 one of the legendary shoutouts.

        Don't take my word on all this, though, dear reader.  See and
 experience the magic for yourself;
