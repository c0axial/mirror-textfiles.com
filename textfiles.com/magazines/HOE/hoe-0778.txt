        Um, so I found my journal unpacking today.  It's always a journey
 down that bumpy, booby-trapped, wild-animal-laden dirt road we refer to as
 "memory lane" when one comes upon an old journal.  Although mine is far from
 full, it contains some neato stuff I forgot I'd written.  I don't keep a
 journal like teenage girls keep a diary, mind you.  My journal acts as my
 replacement word processor, I fill it with random poems/stories I come up
 with on the go.  It's black velvet, filled with not only my writing but an
 assortment of crap I've picked up in my travels, pictures of old lovers, old
 love letters, and the like.  So here's a bit of what I found.

 [-----]

        "I ran over a skateboard today," she said as I braided her hair.  "It
 really pissed me off.  I mean, what kind of idiot would leave their
 skateboard in the middle of the street?  Damn it, I wish the little punk who
 left it there was on it when I hit it, the bastard."

	I was still trying to formulate the image in my head.  A sort of
 transportational survival of the fittest came to mind:  I envisioned her
 black Volkswagen running over a skateboard, maybe a bus running over her
 car, an airplane swooping down and carrying the bus off to god knows where.
 I suggested that the piece de resistance of her accident would have been the
 car actually mounting the skateboard in a gesture of solidarity, but that
 story was far over in her mind.

	"OUCH! You're pulling too hard!" she yelled.

	I apologized, and she went on.  I was still stuck on the implications
 of her first story.  If it had been anyone else, the incident would have
 sparked a long philosophical debate, which would probably end with an empty
 pot of coffee and a full ashtray.  However, I had a firm grip on her hair.
 She wasn't getting away from me too easily, so I started at her with my
 questions.

	"Don't you see the political implications and/or symbolism in your
 action today?"

	"Huh?" she replied.

	"Your car, a polluter of the environment, crushing a skateboard, an
 environment-friendly mode of transportation."

	"OK, you're scaring me now!" she said.

	"Maybe that skateboard was someone's only means by which to get
 around.  Maybe that person couldn't afford a car, maybe you totally screwed
 up their day."

	"Good!"

	Right.  That was my cue to give up.  She obviously wasn't up to my
 inquisition, and frankly, I wanted to pursue it no further.

        "You think too much, that's your problem," she said.  "When was the
 last time you, like, totally let yourself go?  When was the last time you
 got totally wasted, for example?"

	"Dude, you know damn well what happened last time I got trashed.  We
 were at that lame party playing drinking games, then we went back to that
 kid's dorm... I was so fucked up and you left me alone with that guy!"

        "Ahh, beer goggles guy!!  I remember that!  Hahahahahaha.... Christ,
 if I'd have known.  I wouldn't have gone off like that.  Sorry, man."

        "Yeah it's alright.  Life experience, y'know?  Anyway, I seem to
 remember someone hooking up with their man's best friend that night."

        "Oh shut up, you.  Now I'm regretting asking you anything.  I'm going
 to keep my mouth shut from now on."

	I gave her hair a good yank for spite.

 [-----]

        OK that's some unfinished business.  Here's a neat little angry girl
 poem that I don't think I finished yet either:

 [-----]

 Rummaging through old letters, I came across yours
 That girlish handwriting neatly arranged
 Line after line of you telling me your story
 And providing the soundtrack to your life
 Ungrateful bastard you took it back,
 But you left me your letter
 With words neater than mine
 Typical one-up-manship
 Now my words fill the pages
 Words like love and hate and grudge
 You don't deserve to have the last word
 But whenever I confront you my wits leave me
 I know it's not love that draws me to you
 It could be the psychoanalyst in me
 Looking for the symptoms and developing a remedy
 I want to know why 
 You treat me like a child
 When what we did was so adult
 I want to know why
 You ignore me time and again
 When you gave me your vow of eternal friendship
 In my heart I know all the answers
 But I'm not like you
 I don't give up so easily
 In fact I don't give up at all
 This is not the perfect revenge song
 It's just a warning
 Don't fuck with me
 You'll be sorry
 I swear.

 [-----]

        Hot damn.  That was written two years ago or something.  I don't
 remember.  I wouldn't have liked to be around me at that point, sheesh.
 Well, that's all I have to share from my journal.  I'll let you all know if
 I decide to finish any of these things, it's not bloody likely though.
