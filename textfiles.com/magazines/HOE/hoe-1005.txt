        So recently, I joined up with this rock band as the lead singer.
 Well actually, we're not really a rock band yet, I guess, because we only
 have one song.  I wrote it today.  It's called "run."  The band is called
 "Rush N' Attack."  I'm the lead singer.  Anyway, here are the lyrics to
 Rush N' Attack's first song, "Run."

 "Run"
 By David A. Negley
 Music by Rush N' Attack
 (Score not included)

 Run!
 You know it's what you've gotta do!
 You've gotta run!
 Because it's good for you!

 You know, I run, run, run, run, run, run, run in the morning!
 And I run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run in the night!
 I even run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run in the afternoon!
 You got to run like me if you want to make it all right!

 CHORUS:

 Yeah, run!
 You know it's what you've got to do!
 You've gotta run!
 Because it's good for you...
 ...and me... yeah, yeah yeah
 Just RUN!

 I used to never leave the house, oh yeah.
 Running wasn't what I did back then, oh no.
 But then I started running, yeah yeah yeah,
 And not I'm makin' it... all right!  (All right!)

 CHORUS (Repeat 2x)

 Money, money, money, no, it won't do.
 And love, love, love, no it's never true!
 Cuz nobody loves me!  Nobody loves me!
 I don't care, because I love you!
 I love you!
 Come on, run!

 CHORUS (3x)

 Run don't walk, yeah, don't even talk,
 Because the words you say are like the sweat in my sock!
 The sweat in my sock, it makes me want to walk!
 But I don't walk... NO!
 I RUN!

 CHORUS (4x)

 I'm not gonna shoot myself with a gun,
 I don't want to die, I just want to have fun,
 But sometimes, I mourn the rising of the sun,
 You know, it only brings suffering to my miserable, pathetic life!
 Just like everything in my life!
 I'm gonna kill myself with a knife,
 If you don't be my wife,
 Or maybe I'll just kill you, you whore,
 I want to bathe in your blood and gore,
 I want you to beg me to stop while I make you more sore,
 And then you know, baby, I'm gonna run some more!

 CHORUS (5x)

 You fucking bitch, you sucked all the life out of me,
 And now my life is shrouded in mis-er-y,
 For that you must die,
 For that you must die,
 You fucking slut,
 I'm going to stick a knife in your butt.
 So you better run!
 Unless you think that sounds fun!

 CHORUS (6x)

 I love you, baby, and I love to run,
 Running to me is like a world of fun,
 I'm so glad you've learned to love me now,
 But I still think you're a dirty slut, you fat cow.
 But it doesn't matter, baby, because we're in love!
 Love, love, love, now I know what love is!
 I'm sorry I stuck that knife in your butt!

 CHORUS (7x)

 I love my baby, yes I do.
 We run together, yes we do.
 She's got a knife stuck up her ass, yes she does.
 Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love.
 Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
 Love.
 LOVE!

 CHORUS (8x)

 Now, I have love, and I have run.
 And I've got a pretty love with a knife in her bum.
 Billy Corgan is really cute,
 I want nothing more than to wrap my lips around his cock.
 RUN!

 CHORUS (9x)

 FUCK YOU!

 CHORUS (10x)

 FUCK YOU!

 CHORUS (11x)

 FUCK YOU!

 CHORUS (12x)

 FUCK YOU!
 FUCK YOU!
 FUCK YOU!
 FUCK YOU!
 YUCK FOO!
 A HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH!
 DEATH IS THE ONLY ESCAPE!

 CHORUS (13x)
