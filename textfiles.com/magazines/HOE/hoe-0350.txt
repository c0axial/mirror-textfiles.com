        "Mom!! I saw the Easter Bunny come and leave our baskets for us
 last night!"
        "Sure you did, honey, sure you did."
        "No I swear!  He was there!"
        "I know, dear."

        Fact is, the kid really DID see the Easter Bunny last night.

        Many people have called me insane for the theory I'm about to
 present, but fuck 'em, cause I believe it.  Don't worry, it's very okay
 not to believe what I'm going to say, because in "reality", it does sound
 entirely ridiculous.  This is really just one of my not-so-intelligent
 conspiracy theories I made up when I was 16, probably stoned out of my
 mind.

        Children are baked.  

        You see, when a child is conceived, there's a certain chemical
 mixture that occurs inside the womb.  Depending on what food and drink
 the mother consumes, and if she drinks alcohol, does drugs, or smokes
 cigarettes during her pregnancy, the child can be anywhere from slightly
 buzzed to baked off of their asses.  If Mom eats strange foods and
 ingests a lot of caffeine, the kid'll be 'kinda feelin it' until age 9
 or 10.  However, if Mom is a former wild child and takes in all sorts of
 booze and cigarettes, the kid will be tripping hard until they're about
 11 or 12.  That's why some kids tend to be more creative and imaginative
 than others.  The kids who lose their buzz by 9 or 10 also lose a good
 percentage of their imagination.  If Mom was a druggie while pregnant,
 it's a high chance she'll have a Ritalin kid, which are the kids who are
 so completely wrecked that they can't even control themselves; they
 can't grip reality.  They're pretty much screwed until 13 or 14.  

        "Daddy!  There's a monster under my bed!  It's going to eat me!"
        "Har, har, son!  What a wild imagination you've got!"
        "NO DAD SERIOUSLY!#!@! IT'S GONNA GET ME! HE'S REAL!!"

        The dialogue above is a prime example of the oh-so-common
 "Bad Trip".  Everyone has them, you can't avoid them, not now, and not
 then.  The terrifying feelings of paranoia sink in very well, especially
 when you're high and alone in a dark place.  I've bad tripped several 
 times during classroom video or slide show presentations.  But as soon
 as I made it to the hallway, I'd be fine, just as the kid who's afraid
 of the monster coming to get him from under his bed is okay once the
 light is turned on.

        Most people wish they could return to their childhoods.  Really,
 if we weren't all baked back then, would we really have bought the idea
 of a jolly fat man in a red suit sliding down our chimneys (even if
 some of us lived in apartments) and leaving us all these awesome toys
 under a pine tree covered in *cOoL sPaRkLy ThInGs* and shiney balls??
 Or some old lady coming in who collects TEETH from under our pillows?
 Or a gigantic bunny (which, to me, is terrifying) hiding baskets of
 chocolate eggs and other candies in our homes?  And what about that
 whole thing about this God guy up in the sky who created everything and
 lives in the clouds??  What's up with THAT?!

        I respect religion though, don't get me wrong.

        Naturally, one's first thought when their buzz is slowly coming
 down, is 'I need to get more!!'.  So, when the buzz starts coming down,
 we bring it up again by manually filling the emptying holes in our souls
 with "illegal narcotics" so we can try and go back to our childhoods
 once again.  Unfortunately, with the invention of science, came madmen
 (they've always been around, but for some odd reason a hell of a lot of
 them tend to steer towards science.. trust me..). These madmen kept on
 asking 'What if?' and would increase the dosages and types of drugs
 around, leaving them addictive, extremely hallucogenic, and even harmful.
 But that's not the reason why all of these Partnerships and cops are
 pushing for a Drug-Free America, no, no.  Considering the governments
 don't want the free world to be HAPPY, they must rid the world of these
 "harmful drugs", to ensure public misery.

        Canadian cigarette packs (which provide AWESOME filter
 cardboard), Pixie Sticks and Alice in Wonderland were made for a reason!

        Okay, so I'm crazy.  Shoot me.

        The next time you're wondering why your childhood memories have
 become "hazy", think about it. :)
