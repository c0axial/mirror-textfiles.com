 "aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!" they stopped, took a breath, and continued.

 "aaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"

        <two minutes later>

 jubjub to froboy: shit, this is a long drop.
 froboy: <sarcastically> do ya think?

        the van screams past a sign that reads, "BOTTOM OF GORGE: 8 MILES"

 Nybar said to himself, "Self, this must be an often traveled route." He
 responded. "Good thinking, Self."

        As Jubjub's body violently smashed on the sides of the van his hed
 crashed through the passenger side window.

        "Mercuri?"

        "Jubjub?"

        "Mercuri!"

        "JUBJUB!"

 Jubjub: What are the odds that you would be *cliff-diving* from the very
 same cliff we are falling from?

 Mercuri: Dunno. I'm still in algebra.

 Jubjub: Fool.

 Mercuri: Legface.

 Jubjub: So how have you been?

 Mercuri: Can't complain... you going to dummercon?

 Jubjub: No, I can't. Summer camp.

 Mercuri: Haha. Just tell your parents you don't want to go this year.

 Jubjub: That'd never happen.

 Mercuri: So how are you planning on getting out of that van before the shit
 hits the fan?

 Jubjub: Nybar is working on something inside. He says it's some sort of
 thrusting mechanism which will increase the draf... hell, i don't remember
 what he said, you know nybar... wordy braniac.

 Mercuri: Yeah.

        *awkward silence*

 Mercuri: *cough* So anyway, why don't you just get out of the van and get
 into a cliff diving position like I am?

 Jubjub: But nybar is working really hard on these thrusters... I don't want
 to hurt his feelings.

 Mercuri: If you want to live, you have to do what I do.

 <both jubjub & mercuri focus toward a sign that says "CONSTRUCTION NEXT: 2
 MILES">

 Jubjub: Odd.

 Mercuri: Yes.

 *akward silence*

 Jubjub: So I got these pictures of Nybar with only his underwear on...

 *even more akward silence*

 <seconds later, nybar flies out the back end of the fan with a jet-pack on,
 laughing hysterically>

 Mercuri: Okay, Nybar flew the coop. You need to get in this diving position.

 Jubjub: I can't believe he did that... AGAIN!

 Mercuri: This happens often.

 Jubjub: Every fourth year, right after elections.

 <both mercuri &  jubjub take a moment to ponder>

 In unison: Weird.

 FroBoy: We're out of biscuits!

 WILL FROBOY FIND BISCUITS? WILL JUBJUB LIVE? WILL MERCURI LIVE? WHAT
 HAPPENED TO NYBAR?

        TUNE IN NEXT TIME!!
