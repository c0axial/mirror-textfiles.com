1.  Bombtrack

It's just another bombtrack
And suckas be thinkin that they can fade this
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclines to stoop down
Hand out some beat-downs
Cold runna train on punk ho's that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete 
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands on the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall 
And the business' that burned us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough
I call the bluff
Manifest destiny

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

The thought of a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores 
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

Chorus :
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
But now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere
With the thoughts of a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores 
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

Chorus

2.  Killing in the name 

Some of those that work forces
Are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces
Are the same that burn crosses
Some of those that work forces
Are the same that burn crosses
Some of those who work forces
Are the same that burn crosses

Killing in the name of
Killing in the name of

And now you do what they told ya
And now you do what they told ya
And now you do what they told ya
And now you do what they told ya

Those who died 
Are justified
For wearin a badge 
And the Trojan wife                  <----(Huh)

(repetition)

3.  Take the Power Back

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and write

So-called facts are fraud
They want to allege and pledge
And bow down to their God
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun out minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
We gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Mother fuck Uncle Sam
Step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change
And to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Chorus :
We gotta take the power back
We gotta take the power back

The present curriculums 
I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric every last one of 'em
See through the red, white and blue disguise
With lecture, I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting
To hold us back
We've got to take it back
'Cause holes in our spirit are causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior?  Who's inferior?
Yea, we needa check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that is why
We gotta take the power back

Chorus

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't percieve the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacement students sit and listen to the
Bullshit that he learned in school

Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it
Yet we hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the mother fuckin' weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continue unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Chorus

4.  Settle For Nothing

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage
But it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family
But I slipped
To escape from the pain and an existence mundane
I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name

Head my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
But death is on my side
Suicide

A jail cell is freedom from the pain in my home
Hatred passed on, passed on and passed on
A world of violent rage
But it's one that I can recognize
Having never seen the color of my father's eyes
Yes, I dwell in hell but it's a hell that I can grip
I tried to grip my family 
But I slipped
To escape from the pain and an existence mundane
I gotta 9, a sign, a set and now I gotta name

Read my writing on the wall
No one's here to catch me when I fall
If ignorance is bliss
Then knock the smile off my face

If we don't take action now
We settle for nothing later
We'll settle for nothing now
And we'll settle for nothing later

5.  Bullet in the Head

This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
They said it was blue
When the blood was red
That's how you got a bullet blasted through ya head

Blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head

I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen
You was mesmerized
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold
Turn ya to stone before ya realize

They load the clip in omnicolor
They pack the nine, they fire ar prime time
Sleeping gas, every home was like alcatraz
And mutha fuckas lost their minds

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

They losd the clip in omnicolor
They pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
Sleeping gas, every home like alcatraz
And mutha fuckas lost their minds

No escape from the mass mind rape 
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
Play it again and again and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin ya
They say jump 
You say how high
Ya brain dead
You gotta fuckin' bullet in the head

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin down to the flag
Ya gotta bullet in ya head

6.  Know Your Enemy

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know
Ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify
Defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key
We'll break in

Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em

Fist in ya face, in the place
And I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D E F I A N C E
The mind of a revolutionary
So clear the lane
The finger to the land of chains
What?  The land of the free?
Whoever told you that is your enemy

Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mike, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key
We'll break in

I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of complacence now
Sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of you
Time has come to pay

Yes I know my enemies
They're the teachers who taught me to fight me
Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission
Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality, the elite
All of which are American dreams
(repeat "All of which are American dreams")

7.  Wake Up

Although you try to discredit
Ya still never edit
The needle, I'll thread it
Radically poetic
Standin' with the fury they had in '66
And like the E-double, I'm mad
Still knee-deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give ya a dose
But it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air, in the land of hypocrisy

Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease
When their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks
Got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, the judges, the feds
Networks at work, keepin people calm

You know they went after King
When he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to have-nots
And then came the shot

Wit' poetry, my mind I flex
Flip like Wilson, vocals never lackin' dat finesse
Whadda I have to do ta wake ya up
To shake ya up, to break the structure up
'Cause this blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like takin photos
Mad buy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove
Then I stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the stutter step
Then bomb a left upon the facists
Yea, the several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream
And put it to an end

Ya better beware
Of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors

The networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X
And tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head

8.  Fistful Of Steel

Silence
Somethin about silence makes me sick
'Cause silence can be violent
Sorta like a slit wrist

If the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
Nut if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin'

Some speak the sounds
But speak in silent voices
Like radio is silent
Though it fills the air with noises
Its transmissions bring submission
As ya mold to the unreal
Mad boy grips the miscrophone
With a fistful of steel

Chorus :
Fistful of steel
Fistful of steel
Fistful of steel
Fistful of steel

Yes, it's time to flow like the fluid in ya veins
If ya will it, I will spill it
And ya out just as quick as ya came
Not a silent one
But a defient one
Never a normal one
'Cause I'm the bastard son
With the vision of the move
Vocals not to sooth
But to ignite and put in flight
My sense of militance
Groovin', plain' this game called survival
Status the elite, the enemy, the rival
The silent sheep slippin', riffin', trippin'
Give ya a glimpse of the reality I'm grippin'
Steppin' into a jam and I'm slammin' like Shaquille
Mad boy grips the microphone
Wit' a fistful of steel

Chorus

A 44 full of bullets
Face full of pale
Eyes full of empty
A stare full of nails
The roulette ball rolls alone on the wheel
A mind full of fire
And a fistful of steel

If the vibe was suicide
Then you would push da button
But if ya bowin' down
Then let me do the cuttin'

9.  Township Rebellion

Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell
Mad is the dtory I tell
How long can we wait
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state
Get a check-up
This is a stick-up
Our freedom or your life
I wish I could be peaceful
But there can be no sequel

Chorus :
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in township rebellion

Yea, so you thought you could get with the hardlines
That fill your mind
The thoughts, battles fought
And lessons taught
And I'll display the fitness
And flip like a gymnast
Raise my fist and resist
Aslepp, though we stand in the midst of the war
Gotta get mine
Gotta get more
Keepin' the mic warm against the norm
'Cause what does it offer me
I think often it's nothin' but a coffin
Gotta get wreck
"Til our necks never swing on a rope
From here to the cape of no hope

Chorus

Why stand
On a silent platform
Fight the war
Fuck the norm

10.  Freedom

Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list
All live, never on a floppy disk
Inka, inka, bottle of ink
Paintings of rebellion
Drawn up by the thoughts I think

It's set up like a deck of cards
They're sending us to early graves
For all the diamonds
They'll use a pair of slubs to beat the spades
With poetry I paint the pictures that hit
More like the murals that fit
Don't turn away
Get in front of it

Chorus :
Brotha did ya forget ya name
Did ya lose it on the wall 
Playin' tick-tac-toe

Yo, check the diagonal
Three brothas gone
Come on
Doesn't that make it three in a row
Anger is a gift

Chorus

Yo, check the diagonal
Three million gone
Come on
'Cause you know they're counting backwards to zero

Environment
The environment exceeding on the level
Of our unconsciousness
For example
What does the billboard say
Come and play, come and play
Forget about the movement
Anger is a gift

FREEDOM, FREEDOM, YEAH RIGHT!
