        i'm sitting here, with a huge headache from hours of staring at my
 computer screen researching a person who lived 400 years ago, sipping
 "super ceylon tea". the word "ceylon" reminds me of others such as "halcyon"
 and "cerulean". It's a pity that our entire language isn't comprised of such
 nice words. everything would flow more, and maybe we wouldn't live in a
 world that is being replaced with blacktop, buildings, and factories. How
 nice it would be if everything was as it was before people started changing
 it all. looking out in my yard, i see a grove of oak trees. past that, a
 field barren with winter. although i'd rather see that land as a field than
 a subdivision, it makes me sad to think that the fields were once forests.
 sigh. people are always taking away from nature and adding their own things.
 so little flow. people hurry hurry hurry to make themselves happier and
 things more convenient, while they would be much happier if they just sat
 still and stopped worrying about things. I don't know what it is about me,
 but i would be perfectly content to spend my days sitting by a river on a
 grassy bank in the shade of an oak tree, watching the clouds and listening
 to the birds and everything else. Is it impossible, though? of course not...
 but for the rest of the world?

        unless something drastic happens, yeah. i just want peace,
 tranquility, and halcyon days. days without worry and days without hurry.
 people think they own the world, that something gave them the right to
 disregard it as they go about playing with their manmade things,
 disregarding it so completely that they don't realize that they're
 destroying it.

        note: i wouldn't have this printed anywhere but h0e, and resisted all
 urges to edit or refine it, though it now sounds immature and sappy. oh
 well. maybe *now* you'll get off my back about writing for hoe, eh? :)
