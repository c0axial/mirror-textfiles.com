	i didn't like him from the start, what a retard.  john hartman,
 the nerd, the dork, the star trek-know-it-all-loser.  i had gone over to
 his apartment with a large breasted white-trash blonde, i hated that, 
 too.  the evening was turning out to be a bust....."hey, check this out."
 the almighty geek had said when he turned on his suped-up-microprocessor-
 -maxed-out-computer as it played the original star trek theme song as his
 star trek windows booted up with the star trek background, and the star
 trek-captain-kirk-mouse-icon stared at me from the inside of the
 screen.  he had more star trek games that i knew even existed.  i just
 couldn't take it--the sound bytes, the movies, the books, the comics, it
 sickened me, the posters, all of it.....
	"you've gotta see this... but be careful with it, it took a lot of
 time to  put that together"--that was the end of it, when he handed me
 the binder filled with ship designs.
	i knew what i had to do.
	when john wasn't paying attention, I unclipped the rings, stood up
 with the binder, and let all the pages fall out, making sure to step on
 them and crunch them when i "attempted" to pick them back up.
	i was never invited back.

	it was about 6:30, or 7:00 a.m. when 7, anna, and I went over to
 "josh the bitch"'s house.  we went back around to where his basement
 bedroom was and proceeded to knock on the sliding door and window to his
 room.  when he finally came to the door we then asked him, "what are you
 doing up so early?"--"hey, you guys gotta leave, i was sleeping."
	so we pushed passed him and started treating him like the bitch he
 was.  i had taken notice of several things in the basement that i
 immediately didn't like.  the stuffed ultimate warrior doll for instance,
 i kicked it out of my way.  "hey!!! that's my sisters!!!," he bellowed.
	"so?" i replied, 7 started laughing.  "hey, josh, ever talked to a
 girl before?" 7 asked him..  "um..yeah, of course."  "ever kissed a girl?
 ever had sex?" 7 asked, as he and anna proceeded to make out making josh
 squirm and feeling uncomfortable as his face turned red.  i had then
 picked up a balloon type thing and for no reason popped it.  "hey!!!
 don't do that!" josh cried.  with defeat josh tried desperately to get us
 to leave.  i then picked up an old he-man toy and started to twist the
 legs off, by the time josh had gotten to me, they had popped off.
 "alright, that's it, you have to leave." 
	the three of us started to move towards the door when josh said
 something like "go on, get out of here, asshole!"--i just turned around,
 stepped towards him, and in a strong, ruthless voice asked, "WHAT DID YOU
 CALL ME?"
	it was so perfect, the look of utter despair and fear that
 came across his face, as he looked down and lost all confidence as he
 replied in a mouse like voice "nothing."  then we left, after completely
 destroying every shred of self confidence this 17 year old kid had.  it
 was heart warming.

 \\\\\

	for no reason what so ever, i wanted to see how sharp my knife
 was.  so i ran it along the tire of someone's car outside their house in a
 town not to far away from my own.  the tire started to spew air out of it
 through the hole i had made, my friends at the time and i started running
 from the person who was inside the house.  they chased us half way across
 the town before we finally lost them.  what a rush.  i was about 15.

 \\\\\

	iowa state fair, '98.
	ever throw ice cubes into a grease frier?  i hadn't either, but i
 was told that it made a huge mess of bubbling grease.  i had to see for
 myself, so after the guy who my punk friend was friends with gave us free
 soda's at his booth, we threw the ice into their frier.  yup, it made a
 huge, bubbling, scalding hot, grease everywhere mess... we just sat back
 and laughed so hard i thought i wound never breathe again.  the few
 people behind the booth had no idea of what to do, they ran around
 screaming at each other trying to figure out what was wrong, the whole
 scene lasted for a good 20 minutes, i'd say.  ah, what glee.
