        Elementary School - Charles A. Kirkland (1985-1991)

 Madame Belleau, kindergarten
        "Audrey seemed very bright.  The way she stayed inside the lines
 while colouring showed me she had an enormous amount of insight.  I knew she
 would go on to be very successful in life.  I don't know what happened."

 Madame Normandeau, grade 2, French
        "She was one of my favourite students, although I never showed it.
 Sometimes I wish I had, but I was worried the less-adequate students might
 get upset.  She was a perfect student, except for her little stealing habit.
 I thought it was cute, though."

 Mrs. Doyle, grade 5 English, Art
        "All throughout the year I taught her, I never noticed anything
 abnormal about Audrey, until the creative writing project I assigned to the
 class.  Instead of writing a happy, normal story like a boy, his dog, and
 their wacky adventures, she wrote of a suicidal lion and his human
 girlfriend, who was addicted to heroin.  She claimed it was just a story,
 but I believe, to this day, that it was much deeper than that."

        High School - Pierrefonds Comprehensive High (1992-1997)

 Mr. Pellegrino, grade 7, English, Geography
        "I used to throw chalk at kids who would talk during my class.  Most
 grade 7 students fear this tactic like they would The Devil, however Audrey
 was different.  She was very agile, and always managed to dodge the chalk.
 I played football for 15 years, I know how to throw.  I don't know how she
 did it."

 Monsieur Jacques, grade 7,8,9, French
        "I always thought Audrey was bright.  She could've been a lawyer or a
 doctor, if it interested her.  Sadly, her only interest, when I taught her,
 was drugs.  I had no proof, but I knew she was on the pot, and other
 narcotics.  She was a sad case."

 Mr. Moncalieri, grade 10, Math
        "Audrey who?  Tyler?  Yeah, I think I taught an Audrey Tyler.  I
 never saw her, though."

 Mr. Civitella, grade 11, Introduction to Computers
        "Audrey was definetely one of those, how do you say.. 'hackers'.  She
 was always up to no good, like installing Doom on the computers and changing
 her screen saver.  She even tricked innocent students by sending them
 network messages, telling them to reboot their computers and to kill their
 parents.  She was dangerous, but, unfortunately, she excelled in my class
 assigments.  It's people like Audrey who make computers unsafe, unenjoyable
 environments."

 Miss Jacek, grade 11, Mass Media
        "Audrey did very well in my class.  She understood much more than
 most of the other students.  Plus, she was my only student who liked Pink
 Floyd.  I thought that was pretty neat.  I imagined she'd become a
 journalist or photographer, but I don't know.  Something went wrong."

 College - Dawson College (1997-1998)

 Mr. Ring, 1st semester, Formal Logic
        "I didn't think she was very bright."

 Mr. Seymour, 1st semester, Guitar
        "I think Audrey showed a lot of talent.  She learned the notes and
 chords within a day of the course.  It was very unfortunate, though, that
 she was tone-deaf.  I gave her a good mark for effort, though.  Can't blame
 a kid for trying."

 Mrs. Arbess, 2nd semester, Satire
        "Whenever Audrey was in class, she was asleep.  She managed to do
 very well on her creative project about Hogarth, however.  I was quite
 shocked."

 Mrs. Johnson, 2nd semester, Media & Youth
        "Audrey was a decent girl, although her overwhelming excitement she
 expressed when we watched _The Breakfast Club_ was rather odd, to say the
 least."

 Mrs. Kingsley, 3rd semester, Film & Social Issues
        "I felt kind of sorry for Audrey.  She was always going through a bad
 time.  She would show up to my class and tell me about how she was expected
 to be in court, had to go to the hospital to visit her great aunt Wilma, or
 having to bring her kid brother to youth protection.  It was a real shame
 she always had to be somewhere other than my class, for she seemed bright...
 I just couldn't help but feel bad for her."

 Mr. Donovan, 3rd semester, Self Defense & Streetfighting
        "Man, could that girl pack a wallop."
