        day after day, silly lameness such as this is repeated all over
 irc.  why is this allowed?  because there was no one out there to help
 these poor individuals.  until now!  for only *pennies* a day, you too
 can sponsor an irc asshole and help him find a life!

        sponsoring an irc asshole is relatively cheap, and what you get
 out of the deal can save yourself future annoyance for years to come.
 if you choose to sponsor an asshole, you will receive a file with the
 asshole's picture, creditcard, and personal information.  you will also
 receive quarterly a letter from your asshole letting you know how they
 are doing.

        if you decide your asshole has relied on you long enough, you can
 cancel your sponsorship at any moment.  upon cancellation of sponsorship,
 your lameass will be terminated, and their few belongings will be mailed
 to you at once.

        ehh, fuck you.
