        Once upon a time, there was a flower.  The flower's name was
 Sorrow.

        Nobody understood the flower.  Sorrow was alone, in a cold, dark
 world.

        "No one will ever understand the pain I feel deep within my cold,
 black heart," said the flower to herself.  No one was listening.  No one
 heard her lament.

        She cried.  The rain fell down.  The rain was cold, much like the
 cold, uncaring hearts of all the flowers that surrounded her.  They had
 all turned away from her long ago.

        Night fell.  Sorrow liked the night, but she was unable to smile,
 for her blood ran cold with despair.

        In the night, no one could see Sorrow.  Sorrow lay on the ground
 and held her sharp, loving blade against her flesh.  No one saw.  Alive
 or dead, no one cared about Sorrow.

        Sorrow was too distraught to end her life tonight.  She took the
 blade away from her green flesh and shed a tear.  The tear fell to the
 cold, cold ground.
