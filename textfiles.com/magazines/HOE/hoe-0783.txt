	gavin rossdale and nigel made up one of the ultimate bands of the
 90's.  bush. (stopping laugh).  togeher they could turn beats into a
 wonderful tune of love or hate.  such songs as 'everything zen' and
 'comedown' prove this theory.  this text is going to examine some of the
 lyrics that these masterminds have created.  
	
	ex.1 'everything zen' (lyrics taken from CD)

	there must be something that we can eat 
	maybe find another lover
	should i fly to los angeles 
	find my asshole brother
		
		ok, wanting to eat his lover, a new one, possibly his
		brother, intersting, but intense at the very least
	
	minnie(?) mouse has grow up a cow
	dave's on sale again
	we kissy kiss in the rear view
	we're so bored
	you're to blame
			
		ok, here he is talking about some mouse, he thinks minnie
		has eaten alot of shit from dave's and gotten very fat,
		and they kiss because they are boredm, because of us.
		i think.
	
	end ex.1
		
	ok, as you can see, the lyrics taken from this song, are too much
 to bear.  they are pure intellenge from two of the greatest minds in the
 world.  

	bush, mainly the 2 frontmen, gavin and nigel are the most
 interesting and intellengent indvediauls in the world that i know.  we
 must bear witness to the mastermids that are them and beware. 
	ok, i am lying, what wwe really have to do is fucking tie them up
 and slice their goddamn chests open and rip out there vital organs and
 leave them in a pile of leaves to be found by hikers.  heh.  bush is one
 of the worst goddman bands on the face of this earth and we need to let
 this be known by all.  damn....i think i am going to by used bush cd's and
 burn them tomarrow night outside at work, who knows.
