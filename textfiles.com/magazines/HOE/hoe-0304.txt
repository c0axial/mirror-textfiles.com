        after the sky fell and the rubble cleared they landed.  and they
 took every remaining living thing and packed them away in boxes and
 crates.  they put them on their evil ship and flew toward the faraway
 planet that was their home, while on the ship the things broke free and
 killed all the evil space people.

        but these things were evil too and nothing could be done to stop
 them.  when they reached the alien world they took over the entire
 planet.  they multiplyed and killed and ate up everything, then they
 evolved and called themselves human.  many hundreds of years later, the
 few space people that had escaped came back to take revenge on the
 humans.

        the humans believed themselves good, and the space people evil.
 but it was really the other way around.  the space people did not see
 that it would happen all over again, for the sky was falling on this
 world, too, and after it fell was when the space people planned their
 attack.

        they took all of the living things, which in turn took over the
 space peoples planet.  of course, a few escaped and so the cycle was
 repeated.  then one day, soon before the sky fell, another power came.
 they were the noomtas (the "T" is silent).  they killed all but a few
 humans and all but a few space people.  they took their captives and
 tortured them because of the paradox cycle they had caused.

        then they killed them and killed themselves leaving only the
 flower people and one rebel noomta (the "T" is silent).  the flower
 people were very angry at these evil noomtas (the "T" is silent), and
 they tried to kill the one left, but then they realized he was not evil
 but good, and did not kill him after all.

        the flower people were very sad that the humans were gone, and
 very sad that the space people were gone, and the cycle ended.  they had
 taken confort in the cycle, because they never died and never were born
 and only kept living.  now they would live on forever with only one
 compainion -- the noomta (the "T" is silent) that had helped destroy all
 that was normal for them, but they could not kill him because then they
 would be alone in the vast balckness that they did not know how to escape
 from.

        but eventually he died and they lived forever until they watched
 their universe and home die and go away.  and they had nowhere to go, and
 they lived in a little black box asd they slept until one day, they woke
 up in a field of poppies, and watched a little girl with a blue checked
 dress fall and sleep... and her friends a lion and a tin man and a funny
 looking scarecrow fell asleep with her... her dog not far behind.

        and they watched a lady come along with green skin and a black
 hat and black clothes and they watched her slit the girls throat and, in
 turn, all of her friend's as well... and that is when they knew that the
 world was over.
