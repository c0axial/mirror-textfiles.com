        (So, Who wants to BATTLE?)

        I've heard alot of gossip lately.  That POU-crew has fallen off, and
 that that Nybar cat hasn't had a hit since motherfuckers seen Aunt Mabel.
 Well, I call bullshit on that.  I'm talking to you, phairgirl.  Trilobyte.
 Mogel.  Swisspope.  I'm calling you motherfuckers out.  Calling out names.
 Caitlin.  Tasha.  I'm calling out your names, you hear?  I'll battle any of
 you motherfuckers.  I'll get a radio station and you get a radio station,
 we'll appear on our station every week, and the battle will be won by which
 gets more listeners.  This is fine by me.  POU-Crew will destroy you in this
 kind of battle, but at least your career won't be ended.  One thing you wack
 fro-asses need to keep in mind is: don't battle me in the parks.  Just like
 Craig G. vs Supernatural, if you battle me in a club, I will end your
 career.  You hear that, Mogel?  I will end your career if you attempt to
 battle me live.  Because I'm the most live, while you're on some UNDEAD
 SHIT.  I'll be like "rise from your grave," just to smack you back down
 again.  You think this isn't for real?

        The gossip I've heard (from a little bird) that really gets me mad is
 that AIDS is saying he could beat POU-crew in battle at the HOE lounge.
 Now, I have great respect for AIDS and his talents, but the fact is, he does
 not have the battling experience to challenge this, much less kill this.  If
 he has the guts, like I said, I'll grant the challenge, but let me give you
 a little background on why there's no way him (or any 'zine writer like him)
 will accept my challenge:

        Ever since the release of POUPEY #10, all 'zine writers have been on
 notice: they are subject to having their career snuffed out at any time.
 You'd better pay the proper respects to the major leagues, or POU-crew will
 roll all over you.  When I, Nybarius, see an up and coming 'zine writer, I
 instantly write a story that will bury them; end their career.  I then store
 this in the back of my head, only to unleash it if this chump decides to
 challenge me.  All of the POU-crew is similarly battle crazy.  What you got
 on the hard-drive isn't what wins you a battle.  It's what you've got
 between your ears.

        Do any of you remember "Avenger"?  No?  I don't blame you.  He's just
 a page in the 'zine history book now, but back in the day, he amazed all the
 heads by flipping incredible writing styles straight off the dome and
 changing his flow to impersonate any other HOE writer.  Now, the reason most
 people won't remember this cat is because he thought he was the most live.
 One day, in a stupid attempt to grab some glory and fame, he decided to take
 POU-crew on.  A battle was set up between him and Froboy in the old DTO
 Lounge.  Froboy eviscerated him; tore him into 12 pieces.  After that, his
 career was over.  No one cared about his styles.  No one cared about his
 improvisational and impersonational ability.  His career was ended because
 he tried to battle a POU-crew affiliate live.  I think AIDS knows that
 Froboy and me used to habitually battle back in the slums of Newark, and
 he's not going to risk his career by actually taking me on.  Instead, he'll
 make calculated pussy moves to further his career, and never actually test
 his skillz.  If he thinks he's the hardest, his fans should demand he prove
 it.  Go ahead and email him, asking that he challenges any POU-Crew member
 to battle.  Remember back in the old days, when a ZW couldn't even get an
 album made without proving him or herself to be the absolute illest in
 battle?  It's up to you, the people, to bring those days back.  And all you
 other pussy Zine Writers, you're still on notice.  The bridge is still over,
 and POU-Crew is in full effect.

 <Nybar> AIDS
 <Nybar> I'm calling your ass out
 <Nybar> in my new text file
 <Nybar> and accepting your text-file-battle challenge
 <jolly> blah
 <Nybar> jolly, you think you can kill this in battle?
 <jolly> thises are not too tough, you know.
 <Nybar> POUPEY #10 put all of you on notice: your career is subject to
         premature expiration at any point if you step to the POU-Crew.
 <jolly> what is a poucrew?
 <Nybar> POU-Crew is the the POUPEY Trinity, the POUPEY Disciples, and the
         POUPEY Fam
 <Nybar> the holy POUPEY Trinity consists of jubz, nybar and froboy
 <jolly> i am confused.
 <Nybar> the POUPEY Disciples is all the other writers for POUPEY
 <Nybar> and the POUPEY Fam are the people who are down with POUPEY
 <Nybar> and put out POU-Fam projects
 <jolly> :|
 <jolly> i am of not understnading.
 <Nybar> POU-Crew is also our label
 <Nybar> if you're down with POU-Crew, you're basically set for life.
 <jolly> hmm
 <Nybar> and if you step to POU-Crew, you're basically fucked over.
 <jolly> what on earth do you mean?
