                        How to make a bomb,
                        out of a ping pong.
                        Bounce it real nice,   
                        bounce it once or twice.
                        Make it go real high,
                        make the motherfuckers cry.


Necessities:
    1 ping pong ball(duuhh)
    Gasoline or any other flammable liquid
    1 fuse

        Yes, it is quite easy to make a bomb with ordinary household items.  
 This is an explanation of how I do that.  I chose the ping pong ball 
 because they are oh-so-cute.  This bomb will not destroy anything like you 
 may want it to, but hey what do you expect from a goddam ping pong ball?!?  
 It will, however, create a nice, little explosion.  This could scare 
 people shitless and knock over things and maybe even a tiny fire if you do 
 it right.  
 
        The first thing you need to do is puncture a hole in the ping pong 
 ball (you can do this using an ice pick or a drill or some other protruding
 object).  Then go ahead and carefully <g> pour the gasoline (or flammable 
 liquid...and oh there's many...read lables...the more bold face the type 
 is and the more exclamation points near the word "flammable" the more fun 
 this will be) into the ping pong ball, again try not to spill it... it may
 become a bummer when you try smoking a cigar.  Add a little extra if you 
 don't care a shit about the site your setting this off at.  It may make a 
 tiny little fire.
 
        Then insert the fuse into the hole (you know, the one you just made 
 and poured the stuff into) in the ping pong ball.  Make sure the fuse fits 
 in very tight (Everlast Tip #24: If it doesn't fit well, then stick a 
 toothpick in with the fuse to tighten it up well).

        Now your just about set.  Okay, so you are set.  Make sure when you 
 set it on the ground that the fuse is pointing UPWARDS (got that?  No? 
 I'll say it again: UPWARDS! Like, it's the opposite of Downwards.  Got it
 now?  Good.  U-P-W-A-R-D-S) because if it isn't UPWARDS and you go to 
 light the ping pong bong...er, bomb it you might start a little fire and 
 we wouldn't want that to happen!  Okay...now light it and run like a 
 bitch(or a bastard, whichever the case may be)!!
                           
        Thanks for being my friend, and remember what I always say:

        "If you don't give a shit about anything, play ping pong with it."
