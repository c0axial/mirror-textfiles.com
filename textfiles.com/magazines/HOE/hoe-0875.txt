        I'm sure that you're just waiting for the next great commercial fad
 to come around.  Granted, you've already got your recent has-beens like the
 Old Navy ads with Magic the Dog, Carrie Donovan and that assorted bunch of
 semi-celebrities.  Also there's the animated clay ads from Lipton and the
 Budweiser frogs/lizards.  Thank goodness that the Goldfish ads didn't go too
 far.

        To be fair, I do have to say that the Lipton ads are the most often
 present tea ads since the people at Luzzianne decided to try to market their
 product as a game show sponsor in the eighties.

        What of the next ad fad?  My money was on the Gap Khaki ads with
 those ethnically-diverse, Gen-Y cuties singing "classics" like "Dress You Up
 in My Love" and "Mellow Yellow".  It was when I saw the third one (Is the
 title "Just Can't Get Enough"?) and had no recollection of what the song was
 that I recalled my bet.  Mostly, out of embarrassment that I didn't know
 that damn song!

        Perhaps, it will be in the form of another come back.  There are
 thoughts of the recent return of Mr. Whipple, but it's not that one.  If
 that happens, then, there is the inevitable update.  These could be in the
 form of something like Bartles and Jaymes in a steel cage match.  Or a CGI
 replacement for the late Clara "Where's the Beef?" Peller that could morph
 from a Big Bacon Classic into an old woman.  Maybe John Woo could direct one
 for Bounty that Rosie has to wipe up all the blood off of the diner.  That
 would be more like it!

        Even though these ideas maybe to far fetched something is bound to
 come along.  It won't be too much longer now.

        Anyway, enough of this.  I've got another Féria commercial to catch.
