        you are sitting in a room.  there is a desk in the room, and a
 door to the left.  The paint is chipping, from where you nibbled it.
 to the south is a door.  you remember how pathetic your life is.  

 > south

        you walk to the door.  my.  a door.

 > sigh

        you sigh.  no one cares.

 > look

        you see a door.  the door is a strange beige color.

 > open door

        you open the door.  you see a hall to the south, a stairwell to
 the west.

 > west

        you are in a stairwell.  the stairwell smells of human waste and
 new cars.  human waste and new cars block the stairs up.  the stairs
 down lead, well, down.

 > down

        you trip down the stairs, eventually falling near the corpse of a
 businessman.  his cold hand still clutches a briefcase, and a picture of
 his family is sitting there.  A wife, 3 kids.  You cry for his pathetic 
 ass.

 > get briefcase

        you grab the briefcase.  curious as you are, you open it.  inside
 you find some technical papers, a remote control for something, and a
 laptop.

 > use laptop

        The laptop bootts up, and you decide to play StarCraft.  oh boy.

 > zerg

        you go zerg.  dragoons flood into your peon line.  you lose.

 > smash laptop

        you smash the laptop, sending silicon flying in all directions.

 > look

        you see a corpse, rotting; shards of silicon; a picture of some
 lame people; and a door to the east.

 > get shards of silicon

        you pick up the shards of silicon.

 > inventory

        shards of silicon
        technical papers
        remote control

 > east

        you amble outside.  people walk the street.  it is snowing
 outside, and your bare feet are cold.  to the west, a door. to the east,
 a street. to the south, a strange political convention.  to the north,
 a group of hippies.

 > piss

        you piss onto the snow, attempting to write your name.  you fail.

 > north

        the hippies mutter something about TV.  you ignore them.

 > read technical papers

        you read the technical papers out loud.  one hippie says "down
 with the system!  yeah!"  you ignore him.

        > south;south

        you are at a political convention.  a man begs for your vote.

 > piss

        you piss onto the man.  he is unhappy.

 > piss

        you cannot piss.

 > help

        you have no piss left.

 > look

        you are at a political convention.  politicians mill around.  one
 smells of piss.  to the south, a busy street.  to the north, a section
 of sidewalk.  to the east, a wall.  to the west, another wall.

 > south

        you amble into the street.  an oldsmobile flattens you.  you die
 in the street.  game over.

        play again?

 > nope
