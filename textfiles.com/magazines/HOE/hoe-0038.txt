        Damn, this is gonna be my first MA Productions release in aloooong
time! My last release was DaS-008, a group update.  Actually, I'm lying, I
just released DaS-009, but that wasn't a real release, it was more of an
epitaph.  DaS is gone, and it's remains have been consumed by HoE which just
might consummate the groups objective.  (What that is I donno ;> ) AnywayZZz, 
fuck this boring assed shit and onto the barbi beating.

                H3y /v\y /<-R.\D D00d3 Fr!3/\/Dz!!!1

        /<-RaD is taking over the world.  Most won't noticed it, but after
you read this and open yer eyes (Girlies, open legs ;> ) you'll see it too..

        We all know what a /<-RaD D00d3 is, they are the ones who do the
WaReZ shit.  Which is getting a bunch of shit you'll either never use or it
doesn't work and ring up ye ole fon bill at the same time.  Pointless? 
Yeah, that's why we all hate them and put them down like the scum that they
are (Also, like the scum on McDonalds burgers, but that's another file in
itself).  What most people don't realize is that under that definition most
H/Pers (Or so they call themselves) are /<-RaDs.  I've made a list on how to
tell if your a /<-RaD:

1:  If you d/l a bunch of texts and don't read half of'em.

2:  If you would d/l a virus source and not know what LANG it is in, if you
      don't know, you very well can't use it can you?

3:  If you have a bunch of texts and actually read them and have 2+ versions
      of the same info from different groups/people.

4:  If you read text in the morning.

5:  If you read text alone.
        (*Heh, Re-habish joke, just got back, couldn't help it*)

6:  If you have a virii collection and have Trojans and Virii mixed together
       (They aren't the same thing!!!)

7:  If you don't worship me ;>

8:  If you d/l those files that claim to have live credit card #'s & info
       in'em, knowing if it was real, you'd be busted faster than you can 
       say /<-RaD.

9:  If you actually think 10% of those anarchy texts work.        

10: If you actually went out and bought the parts for a box that doesn't 
       work anymore (IE: Black box)

        Take that!  I'm sure I'll be hated and despised for this, but
ahwell;> There is no point of collection a bunch of texts filled with out
dated info, trying something that is outdated, and believing most of that
shit will work.  Virii and trojans are not the same!  When will people learn
this and not mix them all together?!?!?!

        If you liked this text, good, your a smart person with good taste,
if you didn't, so eat a cow that has had it's balls in a rubber band for 2
weeks. ;>

Call the HoE NJ HQ - Symphony oF Sickness   @    (2o1)-Not-4you ;> 

                Okay, couldn't help it.  201/728+3881.

        HOLY SHIT!  Defying the laws of the sacred [EoF] - I'm back damnit!!
You know, I was going to expand this file, but I'm too lazy and have a bunch
of other shit to work on, so live with it! ;>  HAHA!  This file will probably
be released around the same time as my /<-Rad /<iT so check that out also.
As my plans look right now, my next release will be a collection of hoetry
by me.  So, with that, I'm gone!  Enjoy..
