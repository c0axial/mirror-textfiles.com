        Hi my name is interjen.  I wanted to tell people how and why
 computers are interesting in my own mind.  When I first found how to
 communicate with other people, and their minds I had found my way in
 finding new and fresh computers to talk on.  The way I found my new and
 computer geeks were to learn and how to contact people.  I feel strongly
 about what I am going to say right now aol is not the best to have because
 of it's commercal it is because the company wants it to be top in business
 it's because they make the money and you get the server.  One of my friends
 said aol is the best you can get, but I don't care.  People who are on aol
 why are you on this server?  Did you check other companies maybe.  Unix is
 the best you don't get any ping and you get instant messages.  Some people
 know it all but they will never know it all because there is a big world in
 talking, and let me tell you this most clubs or chating boxes don't let
 most people in because it's full or it's not a good place to chat.  So make
 the right decision and keep looking I'm sure you'll find the right one
 instead of the evil aol it's just waiting to suck you in.
