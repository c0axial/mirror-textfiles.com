	if i'm going to make it anywhere, i wanna make it to bottom, the
 lowest anyone can go.  i wanna walk down a street and have people be so
 sick of me that they just have to puke or spit on me.  i don't want
 people to know what's on my mind.  and i don't want people to care.  i'll
 shut you all out and keep to myself.
	i fucking hate every thing that makes you people you.  your hair,
 your personality, your egos... the way put cologne to cover up your stench.
 your make up does nothing but cover up the fact that you're unpretty.
 we can see your makeup.  you can't see it because you want to believe its
 not there.  you're not the anti christ.  you're just confused.  there is
 no religion, just evolutionism.  you want everything faked and you don't
 care who you hurt in the process.  china man don't wear pants.  and if i 
 were perfect i wouldn't either.
	you with the three fingers. fuck off and die.
	i wrote a poem one night when i was all fucked up on acid.  if you
 like anything to do with thoughtful poetry on acid read it.  copy and
 paste it to notepad print it and take it in for show and tell, teachers
 love this sorta shit.

 Shot in the Head
 ----------------

 coward
 you are nothing but a coward
 i wanna hear you say it, say you're a coward
 i'm a coward
 louder i can't hear you! 
 i'm a coward
 flash than silence 
 the body fades to darkness
 time ticking lightly
 power shown with time
 the innocent never do the crime
 just a question asked by the mime

	blame society.  steal your parents guns and make some space for
 some new children to be born.  poverty striken whores giving birth to
 crackhead kids to add to the army of the crack comunity.  this service
 annoucement has been brought to you by pl0nk.  i would like to take the
 time now to thank all the people who made my life shitty.  you made me
 who i am today.
