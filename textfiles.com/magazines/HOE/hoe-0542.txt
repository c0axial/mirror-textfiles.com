        So I'm at Oberlin, and you cannot throw a fucking rock on this
 campus without hitting some sort of Angry Queer Activist.  They're all
 misunderstood because they're Transgendered, or they're into SMBD, or they
 have fluid sexuality, or they're something else new and marginalized and
 misunderstood.  And they are all oh so Queerer Than Thou, and they all
 annoy the fuck out of me.

        I'm just to darn happy to spend the effort and time getting angry
 about things.  I'm happy about being at Oberlin.  I'm happy about being
 bisexual.  I'm happy about being in a nonmonogamous relationship with a
 boy.  I'm rilly happy about the sex, especially when he does this truly
 amazing thing with his tongue.  I'm happy about my new haircut, especially
 when people rub the part of it that's crew cut length.  If it wasn't for
 Angry Queers, I'd have nothing to bitch about.

        I realize we need activists.  I realize that the reason I can be so
 secure and happy and have my sexuality fill me with warm fuzzies is because
 of the work of activists.  I respect them, and the work they do, and the
 shit they face, and especially the fact that they're making life
 comfortable for me, since I like things being comfortable for me.  Frankly,
 anything anyone can do to make my life better, they are welcome to do.

        I'm just so sick of people whining about how I cannot possibly
 understand their struggle and their suffering and their marginalization and
 I'm probably prejudiced against them as well.  I mean, I am, but that's
 just because I have an innate loathing of annoying whiners.  I mean,
 honestly, at this point the term transgendered applies to just about
 everyone, you can't be both marginalized and all enclusive, it just doesn't
 work.  As for SMBD, I have yet to get any shit for the handcuffs in my
 bedroom, perhaps because I don't feel the need to tell people outside of
 my bedroom about them.  (Uh.  Until now.  Oops.)  And  I think if, of the
 myriad of labels available, you aren't comfortable with any of them, and
 then the best you can come up with is "fluid sexuality" (which actually
 means sexuality that changes over time, rather than sex with liquids), you
 just suck.

        Basically, I'm a happy little queer girl, unless annoying whining
 people give me shit and tell me I should be doing stuff.  So I felt the
 need to tell you all about it.
