 Katie-
        Oh my gosh.  What did you say to him?  Jenny James came up to me as I
 was leaving for the library today & she said you gave him my # & told him I
 THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO ASK ME OUT TODAY!  Oh god, what if he doesn't even
 like me?  Katie, why, oh, why?!?! J/K.  So how was your concert?  My mom
 said you called at like 10:08 or something.  Gee.  I'm sorry.  I went to bed
 at 8:15.  I was so tired.  I have really bad cramps, but I've only had them
 for about 10 min.  Some girls at the next table (diagonally) I think they
 are juniors, but anywho, they keep looking at me & one of them whispered.
 YIKES!  Uwe's plane got fogged in last night so he didn't come, but his
 plane today land's at 10:12 a.m.  I'm so excited!  Oh, do you still want to
 come over or something?  YIKES.  I miss him so much.  I thought he wasn't
 going to be able to come at all this month.  I bet he just can't wait to see
 Madisson.  Travis really wants to meet him, but I don't exactly want him at
 my house.  Oh our 2 final days, I hope we go --
 1st, 3rd & then 2nd, 4th, so I can break up w/ him on May 29, & whole day
 earlier.  Well I can't write today or use correct punctuation so I guess
 I'll go now.  Later.

 Katie, thanks love the picture.  Here's one for you, Poor Ryan has no Idea
 that he smells so damn bad.  I fell sorry for people like that.  Your
 welcome for the gum, Yeah being polite is starting to get to me too, so I
 won't be as polite.  Anyway I sent you this picture because I can't draw
 naked people that well.  Michelle wanted me to draw a picture of Clint I
 said hell no!

        You're right, Jeff is better looking than Jeremy (sorry Jeremy).

        Well, I was just telling you that.

 Katie Froggers-

        Hello there I'm in Lang. Arts now - again.  Last hour was real fun!
 (Algebra)  Travis' group was sitting right next to him & he has dumb people
 in his group so I was helping him w/ his assignment the whole hour!  Then
 when we got done he was playing with my hair & put it up w/ my scrunchy.  He
 did it this really weird way, but it looked pretty cool.  Oh gosh that hr.
 was real cool.  Gee, the bell's going to ring in a few min. - I'll write
 later.

        Hi.  After school today was not cool.  (Its 7:52) I just called you a
 few min. ago, but you weren't home)  I was standing over w/ Sara & Jen,
 Erica, etc. And I saw Jason holding hands w/ Andrea!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh

	I  HATE   HER!

        Anyway so Janelle & I were walking by Ken, Joe, & Jason & Janelle
 goes "Jason are you going out w/ Andrea?" And he goes "yeah" And so I just
 kept walking & Ken yells "you're a loser" while he was looking at me.  Well
 ya know what I can't think of anything else to write but to complain about
 Ken so I guess I'll go now.  And hopefully I won't forget to give this to
 you.  Bye

 Katie,
        I would really like to meet you so if you can meet me somewhere
 ok!??!  From what I hear your pretty cool so if you can let me know.  About
 your phone number if you want me to have it you have to give it to me
 because I feel if you want me to have it you will give it to me.  I did go
 to Homecoming all by myself to bad you didn't go because I was looking good
 but hell for $63.30 I better right!  Well you wrote me a little over a half
 of page so I'm not going to write that much.  But I understand you will get
 in trouble.  I write you in take ten but you can't do that but if you write
 a lot I'll write alot ok!!?!  I going to be a senior in about a month if
 that I am so happy!!!  Because I get to grad. early.  Well if you want my
 phone number then ask me for it okay if not that is cool too.
			Love your friend (for now)
			Shon "Thumbs" Sommers
