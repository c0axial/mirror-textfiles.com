        princess red was very bored one day when she walking in one of the
 vast gardens at her giant magnificent castle.    she decided that she
 needed to have some adventure.  so she went into the castle to find her
 best friend, pachel.

        together they left the castle and set out into the GREAT DEEP FOREST
 looking for dragons.  while they were sitting by a little lake in the
 middle of the forest, they saw a mysterious figure rise out of the water.
 the figure was dressed all in water and made of water herself.  at first,
 they were frightened vbecause they had never seen anything like this
 before.  but then they got used to her just in time to see her face.  she
 was the most prettiest thing they had ever seen.  princess red cleared her
 throut and asked the figure if she hasd a name.

        she simply replied, "mysteriouslady".

        this mystified the two girls and they were almost afraid again, but
 then mysteriouslady told them that they should go to the far away land of
 the prince ooblook.  the princess knew that the prince ooblook was an enemy
 of her father, the great King Dark Red.  the princesses thought this was a
 silly thing to do and at first ignored mysteriouslady.

        they continued on their merry way, picking flowers and talking to
 birds and such.  then they stumbled into mysteriouslady again.  only this
 time she was made of moss and grass and rose from the forest floor.  she
 again warnded them that awful things were to happen if they did not go to
 the land of ooblook.  this time they took her seriously.  she told them to
 go to a cottage in the forest and to gather supplies.  they put as many
 things as they could on their backs so they would not starve or run out of
 things on the way, for it was a long journey.

        only two days into their long scary walk through the forest the
 girls met and were attacked by a group of tree people.  they robbed them
 of everything except a yo-yo, two days food, and a scarf.  this upset the
 princess very much.  she did not know what to do or how they would go one.

        to-be-continued!
