                           Scene One - Sanctuary
                           =====================

        [ The scene - Mark the Hat and Johnny stand in front of a bird
          sanctuary.  Mark the Hat is his usual self, desultory and mad,
          talking a mile a minute about everything but the actual matter
          at hand: a drug deal.  Johnny is trying to purchase ecstasy.
          It's midday and the birds are chirping. ]


 Mark the Hat: Here's this bird, see, and he's saying to the others, "Oooh,
               I'll fight with you," because he doesn't know what he's
               doing.  And then the others are like, "Fuck off!  We'll peck
               your heads!   Oooh!  We'll peck your heads something fierce!'
               And see, that's why he doesn't have any feathers on his
               head, that's why he's bald.  He's got no bloody feathers
               anywhere!  (suddenly) Buy me a beer?

 Johnny: (trying to not seem rude) Yeah, I see the bird's head.  He's
         pretty bald.  Hey, hey, Mark the Hat, have you any ecstasy?

 Mark the Hat: No, but I can get you some.  Tell me something.  In America,
      you treat the English like pets, don't you?  It's always, 'Let's
      take the pet out to dinner' or 'Let's go show our friends the new
      English pet we've made', or, 'Oh, look how cute, the pet speaks
      funny!' Buy me a beer?

 Johnny: Uh.

 Mark the Hat: My favorite are the two lovebirds, though.  You see them?
               There was one, first, the boy, and he couldn't get along
               with anyone here.  Not one single bird liked him in the
               whole cage and they were always picking at his head and
               attacking him and he just kept saying, 'Oh, please, please
               leave me alone!  I wish there was another lovebird for me
               to acquaint myself with'.  So I went to the guy who runs
               this, a nice sort, and I said, 'You've got to get another
               of those, because otherwise that one will die of
               loneliness'.  So.. he got one.  And now, look, they're as
               happy as can be.  Buy me a beer?

 Johnny: So, how long would it take you to get me some ecstasy?  We've
         been really dying to get our hands on some more.  The last time
         we took it, it was beautiful, we went up the Tor and we could
         see all the stars and the glare of the distant cities.

 Mark tha Hat: Oh, that's sounds perfect.  Well, it'll take me a few
               hours, but if you want speed, I've always got speed, right
               here in me bag.  I've also got some acid, you know?  The
               two together are pretty much ecstasy.  Same feeling, do you
               want to do that instead?  Cheaper, too.  (screams:) Ooooh!
               See that one, there, the yellow one in the birdhouse?
               Watch him now!  He does this everyday!  He flies down, gets
               some straw and tries to build a nest!  He brings it up to
               the birdhouse and when he goes to get another piece, it
               always falls out!  He's been doing it for two years, and
               he's like, 'Bloody hell!  Why the fuck won't this nest be
               built and done with already?' He does it everyday!  I've
               been watching him for two years.  I watch them for a few
               minutes each day, have done so for years on end.  It gets
               me going in the morning.  It's just a beautiful way to start
               the day.  Buy me a beer?

 Johnny: So.  how much is the speed and acid? 

 Mark the Hat: Well, that depends, it depends on how much you want.  Buy
               me a beer?

 Johnny: Maybe enough for two people?

 Mark the Hat: I'd say about thirty quid, give or take.  Buy me a beeer?

 Johnny: Well, I'll take thirty worth if that's fine by you.

 Mark tha Hat: Ok, lemme get it out.

        [ Mark the Hat begins to rummage through his bag, finally finding
          a small container in which he stores his drugs.  He removes the
          container's lid, pulls out two small wrapping and hands them to
          Johnny, who examines them and in turn hands over thirty pounds
          to Mark tha Hat. ]

 Johnny: Well, Mark the Hat, I've gotta be getting back to her, you know.
         Can't just be expected to leave my girlfriend waiting for me.
         She's alone in a foreign town, you know.  (laughs a little,
         awkwardly)

 Mark the Hat: Aye, I understand.  Buy me a beer?

 Johnny: What the hell is wrong with you? I just gave you thirty pound,
         buy your own fucking beer!

        [ Johnny leaves. ]

        [ Enter chorus.  The chorus is made up of the women of the city,
          mainly hippies, one or two older women convinced they are the
          mouthpiece of angels.  They watch Mark the Hat face the birds
          and stare at them with rapt attention. ]

        Chorus: Mark the hat!  The harbinger of doom, he whom the gods
                would destroy they first make mad, and Mark the Hat walks
                towards destruction.  Mad!  He's mad!

 Mark the Hat: (speaking to the Chorus) You'll not ruin it!  You'll not
               ruin my fun!  Tonight a spectacle, and tomorrow, and
               tomorrow, and tomorrow.  And my fear is great that you have
               taken my god from me!

        [ Mark the Hat runs off stage hooting and hollering, presumably to
          go buy some beer.  Lights dim. ]

                     Scene Two - Ja!  Ja!  Rasta-Boom-Basta!
                     =======================================

        [ The scene - a field before Glastonbury Tor.  The Tor is cleared
          visible in the background, remote and distant.  Johnny and his
          girlfriend, Elysium enter stage right.  There's a bench in the
          field provided for their leisure, and Johnny sits down on it,
          Elysium sits on the ground next to it.  They are, at this point,
          cranked up.  But it's early in their journey and so they aren't
          completely out of control. ]

 Elysium: Why'd it have to be speed?  The acid, sure, I can deal, but acid
          and SPEED?

 Johnny: So you'd go psycho and rip my fucking head off, drive down the
         freeway in a van, and throw my head at a passing car.  Someone
         did that in Texas you know.  He really pulled an Icabod Crane,
         no shit, I'm not lying.

 Elysium: Between 1950 and 1991?  92?  Disney made approximately two good
          animated productions, and one live action-animation fusion.  The
          second was The Fox and The Hound which had this intense visual
          style about it.  dark and gloomy, like living on the inside of a
          pillow case your entire life.  The first was their dramatization
          of The Headless Horseman.

 Johnny: The early Mickey Mouse cartoons, they were funny.  The early
         Silly Symphonies, they were funny.  Remember when they called
         Goofy 'Dippy Dawg'?  But, overall, Disney cartoons just weren't
         funny.  They couldn't compare with Warner Brothers, though, in
         terms of humor.  Disney cartoons weren't really funny once Walt
         and the crew became respectable and started paying attention to
         the mother's groups.

 Elysium: Sure enough,  but you and I are both aware that neither company
          ever could or ever would hold a match to the Fleischers.

 Johnny: Oh, oh, of course.  Those were just brilliant.  You see those
         cartoons and you're peering over the edge of order and looking
         into a huge vat of Chaos.  My favorite is the one with Santa
         Claus.  Santa Claus comes off how you always wanted him to, not
         sorry and sappy and this corporate entity there to humor kids,
         but rather as this raving lunatic, incontinent with laughter,
         who just can't help doing what he does because he thinks it's
         all so grand and funny.  That's what I'd want Santa Claus to be
         like if I met him.

        [ A pause.  The drugs are kicking in. ]

 Johnny: What was the live action-animation fusion?

 Elyisum: (nervously) What?

 Johnny: You know, you said Disney made a good live action animation
         blended film, what is it?

 Elyisum: (relived) Oh, oh, that.  The Song of the South.  The critics
          slagged it for racist, but, still, when I see it, and hear that
          music, and see that ol' Rabbit.  Yeah.

 Johnny: I liked Robin Hood.

 Elyisum: What?

 Johnny: I think Robin Hood, the Disney one with the fox as Robin and a
         fox as Marian, and King John as a stupid lion with a snake
         advisor, Little John the bear that bore a not-too-surprising
         resemblence to Baloo, Allan-a-Dale as a Rooster with an American
         accent and a blues guitar, all that.  I liked that one, I really
         liked that one.  It was the balls.  Did it have Will Scarlet?  I
         can't remember, for the life of me, I can't remember if it had
         Will Scarlet.  (trailing off) What the hell animal would he have
         been.  another fox?  another fox.

        [ He trails off as Elysium stares at him.  She looks at him, she's
          starting to shake, and she erupts into a scream. ]

 Elysium: Aiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
          eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  Your husband Agamemnon returns!  WHY
          THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ROBIN HOOD?  It's a terrible
          movie and it's certainly not what I want to be hearing while
          this shit starts rocking me!  Please!  Shut!  The!  Fuck!  Up!

 Johnny: What the fuck is your problem?  What the hell did I do to you?

 Elysium: Oh, I dunno, maybe it's this idea that I was somehow pressured
          into taking this speed, when all I wanted to do was take some
          ecstasy, climb the Tor, and experience the beauty of everything,
          like we did last night.

 Johnny: Well, god damn, (stressed) Sor-reee.  I couldn't get us any
         ecstasy, ok?  I figured, I might as well get what I could.  And
         why the hell would I freaking want to pressure you into doin
         anything?  I could just as easily have pumped myself full of
         drugs without you.

 Elysium: Listen!  Listen!  It just doesn't matter, ok?  Let's just drop it
          and try to have a good time tonight, ok?  I mean, just because
          this night is just like every other night in our relationship
          should be no reason that we can't enjoy ourselves, now should
          it?

 Johnny: Wonderful.  You know what you are?  You know what you are?

 Elysium: What am I?

 Johnny: Birds chirping at night.

 Elysium: Fuck off.

        [ Another pause. ]

 Johnny: (not exactly meek, but not exactly headstrong, either) Do you
         want to climb the Tor or what?

 Elysium: Might as well.

        [ They begin to walk off stage, enter the chorus.  The chorus is
          made up of reggae cows.  The lights dim as they enter, so they
          are only shapes of strange motion to the audience and to the
          players. ]

 Chorus: Night and Day.  Oooohh.  Night and Day.  Oooohhhhh...
         Ja!  Ja!  Rasta-boom-Basta!  Ja would never let the wicked man! 

 Johnny: What the fuck are those things?  What the fuck is this?

 Elysium: I don't know!

        [ As the Chorus chants, Johnny becomes more and more disturbed,
          we see him shaking physically and pratically convulsing, while
          Elysium seems to be looking for something on her person. ]

 Chorus: I know that you're in love with him.  Oooohhh.  Ooooooh...
         but, but, she's not in love with me!
         Agonize, pine, hate, destroy, deny, what can I do?
         the only reason I listen to so much god damned Led Zeppelin
         is because I relate to the lyrics!
         you know why I relate to the lyrics?
         BECAUSE YOU MADE IT THAT WAY
         (Also, they recorded D'yer Ma'ker.  Ja!  Ja!)

 Johnny: And my fear is great that my death is upon me, and I can see the
         outlined shimmering shapes through the lies and mists of my own
         time, an eternal thousand flounderings of mystification and
         magic, and though I have grown tired of my station I will
         forever abide by it, because it is my station and I so
         desperately want something to be mine.  (To Elysium) We've got
         to kill these fucking things.  We've got to fucking kill them!
         It's the survival of the fittest, and though I hate what I've
         become and who you've made me, I can't bear to be without it!
         (screaming) MURDER KILL MURDER DESTROY SLAUGHTER

        [ As Johnny's rushing the Chorus, Elysium turns on her flashlight
          and shines them on the cows. ]

 Elysium: Your pharmacopia is betraying you, Johnny-boy, those are just
          cows.  They aren't out to do anything except chew cud and shit
          all over the place.  (points to the ground) See all that?  That's
          shit.  Don't fall it in, because I'm just going to have to wash
          your clothes in you do, and I think it's the least you could do
          to avoid making a further mess for me.

        [ Johnny and Elysium walk through the Chorus, Elysium first.  As
          Elysium passes on of the last members, it moves behind her,
          blocking Johnny's path. ]

 Johnny: (yelling in an almost falsetto) FUCKING COWS!!!!

        [ Johnny walks around the cows and follows Elysium. ]

 Johnny: When, you know, back there, I was just a little buggin' on the
         drugs, you know?  I wasn't really serious about any of that, you
         know?  Just a little fucked, just a little fucked.  Hah ha ha.
         And I haven't even peaked.  heh heh heh.

 Elysium: Sure, John, sure. 

        [ They walk off stage. ]

                              Interim One - Rape
                              ==================
	
        [ The interim - a field somewhere.  The Tor is a little larger in
          the background.  Johnny and Elysium enter stage right. ]

 Johnny: (with some real scorn) Do you remember how we met?

 Elysium: (sitting down on the middle of the stage, and answering with
          reserve) Yeah.  I do.

 Johnny: Do you ever think about it?  

 Elysium: I try not to. 

 Johnny: I think about it a lot.  It changed both of us irrevocably, I
         mean, I became this major figure in your life with an act of
         kindness for which I desired no reward.

 Elysium: (with total exhaustion, as if she's said this a million times
          before) Yeah, well, thanks for saving me John.

 Johnny: (misinterpreting her apathy for sarcasm) What?  (yelling) You want
         I should have left you there for the ghouls to violate?  Yeah,
         you bitch, you fucking twat, don't think I don't know what you're
         doing.  You fucking little twat!  (Really flabbergasted!  His
         yells become almost like the squeal of a stuck pig) I really
         should have left you there.  Ha haha!  You fucking whore!

 Elysium: Sometimes, John, my love, I think, I think just maybe it would
          have been better if you did leave me there.  I mean, at least
          then all the inept fumbling would have been unconscious and
          involuntary, and would have taken, what, two hours of my life?
          But instead, you rescued me, and I've spent the past four years
          in your filth incrusted arms suffering beneath your gentle
          caress which fill me with such a loathing that the bile stains
          my teeth.

 Johnny: You little fucking little fucking little fucking little bitch ass
         twat!  For you, my love!  All for you!  Filth incrusted embraces
         and a miserable little hot-house that I saved at a party!  A
         little god damned piece of shit, a worthless hunk of flesh and a
         waste of an ovarian ejection and seminary particle!  I should
         have left you, you know that?

 Elysium: Yes, idiot, I think you've gotten to that already.  Maybe it
          needs a little more reiteration before I really get it through
          my skull?

 Johnny: I bet.  I bet you would have liked it!  I heard it's every
         woman's fantasy!  Fucking whore.  Fifteen years old, at a party
         full of her elders, guys all like twenty-one, fucking little whore
         gets real drunk and passes out.  I happen to stumble in on the
         scene, I'm looking down at your little virgin cunt, supposedly
         virgin, anyway, and this fucking piece of shit, this dumb mother
         fucker who invited me to his stupid party for no good reason, he
         looks up at me, points down to your passed out twat, and gives me
         that look, that sex-look that guys get, and says, "You want first
         dibs?"

 Elysium: (screaming) Stop! 

 Johnny: And I'm looking here at your cunt, you've got no pants on, I'm
         looking at your virginal mound, flesh little thing it was, a
         little fat around the outer lips, and I realize you're about to
         get gang-banged like no tomorrow!  They're looking at you, and
         they're saying, "Shit, this bitch is a good  place to deposit my
         lovely little sperm!"

 Elysium: (yelling) Stop it!  Stop it!

 Johnny: And here's your fucking pussy with its sparse hairs gently
         covering it, and all I can think about is how beautiful and
         delicate the hairs look, how they drape over your cunt like mist
         over the ocean.  What a fucking parallel in my mind.  These god
         damned ghouls, absolutely FUCKING ghouls, I can see the grim
         vizard of death over their faces, I know they're about to
         destroy you, and they look like the most horrible things in the
         world to me.  And here's this scene, this fucking majestic scene,
         something out of a painting by Monet!  I could see infinity in
         each one of those hairs reaching out from your virginal mound,
         like they were trying to tenderly caress the sky above it,
         tendrils of the earth towards the sun.

 Elysium: (really shrieking now) STOP!  STOP IT!  STOP IT NOW!  STOP!
          STOP!  STOP!

        [ As the following is spoken, Elyisum continues to scream out her
          impotent protestations while Johnny screams his words over her.
          The longer it goes on, the closer to the earthen floor she
          becomes, until she is finally wilted and weeping.  When he stops
          screaming, only her weeping should be audible for about twenty
          seconds.  Absolute drug-induced bawling. ]

 Johnny: (hollering) These electrical connections springing forth from
         your loins!  And then I look up and see they haven't fucking
         taken your shirt off, the god damned sick fucking animals haven't
         even bothered to take off your shirt, they're so interested in
         pumping and humping!  There is no pain like that of desire!  And I
         see you're wearing a shirt with a picture of Boba Fett on it, and
         I decided I had to rescue you, you dumb fucking cunt, so I did it.
         I simply went over, and picked up your form, and took you back to
         my fucking house.  And I didn't rape you, and I told you what
         happened, and we got together, and I've been with your sorry ass
         ever since.  I wish to fucking GOD I had left you there!  I wish
         to fucking GOD your sorry ass had gotten raped and I wouldn't
         have to deal with this shit.  (he stops for a second and hears
         her weeping) Stop fucking crying!  Fight back, you bitch!  Fight
         with me!  Do something!  I'll kill you tonight!  I'll kill you
         tonight!  (shrieking) Oh, you're dead now!

        [ He moves over her body and stands silently above her, just
          watching her weeping. ]

        [ Suddenly, her weeping is drowned out by the sounds of
          ritualistic drums.  They're beating far in the distance, and
          both characters look up towards the Tor, indicating that the
          sound is definitely coming from there. ]

 Elysium: (still tearful, but mainly scared) My god!  What the hell is
          that?

 Johnny: It's coming from the Tor.  It's coming from the Tor.  What the
         hell is it?

 Elysium: Oh, god, oh..

 Johnny: Is it demons?  Maybe it's Gwynn ap Nudd! 

 Elysium: Oh.. Oh. (she makes a movement indicating she's probably going
          to be sick.)

 Johnny: We've got to go on.  We've got to see what the noise is, c'mon,
         come ON!

        [ He pulls her up and pulls her off the stage.  They exit stage
          left. ]

               Scene Three - A Good Mind is Not a Good Fuck Mate
               =================================================

        [ Enter Johnny and Elysium, they're at the base of the Tor.
          Enter simultaneously, from the other side of the stage, the
          Chorus.  The Chorus is the women of the city again.  The drums
          are beating louder and continue through the entire following
          scene. ]

 Chorus Leader: (to Johnny and Elysium) Don't you think the problem is
                that you aren't really compatible?

 Johnny: What the fuck do you want lady? 

 Leader: I just see something in the two of you.  I know it's absurd,
         silly really, but I've got to express my opinion on it.  I see in
         the two of you a total and complete incompatibility.

 Elysium: (seemingly interested) Why? 

 Leader: One, it's a relationship whose foundation is one of clay.  You
         got together, I heard, you got it on after he saved you from a
         supposed fate worse than death, correct?

 Elysium: (hesitant) yes.

 Leader: Emotions were running high.  People are liable to do anything,
         en-Y-thing if it's motivated out a release of fear.  Look at
         wars.  People do anything to try and escape the horror around
         them.  That's what started the relationship.

 Johnny: So?  People ended up together during the War for the rest of
         their lives.  We're all probably the result of wartime
         relationships.  All of us.  My parents got together in 1984.  The
         war was in full bloom then, they were dissenters, they needed
         an outlet.  They're still together.  Is their relationship based
         on clay?

 Leader: (ignoring Johnny, speaking to Elysium) The other fatality, and
         perhaps the more important one, is the real lack of physical
         connectivity between the two of you.

 Johnny: (angered) What the fuck do you mean?  What?  What the fuck do you
         mean?

 Elysium: (pleading to Johnny) Please!  I want to hear what she's saying.
          this old woman of the city, she knows, I think, she knows what's
          happening with us.  I don't know how, but I think she does.
          Really.

 Leader: (to Elysium) You thought it would be great!  You thought it would
         be great!  But a good mind is not a good fuck mate!  Mark E.
         Smith.  There's got to be a connection, child, there has got to
         be a physical chemistry, call it pheromones or some sort of
         preference for the symmetry of one another's faces, but there
         has got to be a physical connection for any relationship to
         survive and flourish.  You can't base it simply on an intellectual
         connection.  At the heart there's got to be a real chemistry.

 Johnny: Great.  Great.  What the fuck (stressed) ever, you old fucking
         bag.  Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, why don't you eat
         my shit?  Why don't you just leave us alone?  How do you know any
         of this shit?  How do you know any of this bullshit that you're
         spewing, you haven't been there in bed, have you?  You haven't
         been there.  No.  You haven't.

 Elysium: But I have.  I have.  and she's right. 

 Johnny: (almost inaudible) fuck you

 Elysium: We'd be such great friends.  If we weren't so tied to one
          another in this sexual girl - boy relationship, if we could
          exist just as friends who didn't care if the other was about
          to freak out over some dumb shit nobody really cares about.  I
          mean, you know, if we were just friends and didn't have to
          interact in this fucked emotional plane.  We've got such a great
          mental connection.

 Johnny: (brisk) Yeah, whatever.  Well, fuck that.  Whatever.   What-ever.
         Yeah, well, whatever.  (to the leader of the Chorus) WHAT THE
         FUCK ARE THOSE GOD DAMNED DRUMS?

 Leader: Are you so unaware of the date?  Are you so unwary of time?  It's
         May Eve.  May Eve.

 Johnny: And?

 Chorus: (sung, of course, to the tune of Teddy Bear's picnic)
         If you go up to the Tor today
         You're sure of a big surprise.
         If you go up to the Tor today
         You'd better go in disguise
         For every pagan that ever there was
         Will gather there for certain because
         Today's the day the Cult Members have their picnic.

         Picnic time for Cult Members
         The little Cult Members are having a lovely time today
         Watch them, catch them unawares
         And see them picnic on their holidays
         See them gaily dash about 
         They love to sing and shout
         They never have any cares
         At 2 o'clock great Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth
         Will take them home to Yuggoth
         Because they're tired little Cult Members

 Johnny: I'm leaving.  No more.  Absolutely not.  (To Elysium) We're
         leaving.

 Elysium: Oh, but, Johnny, I'd like to sit and hear more of what they
          have to say.  It's making sense, you know?  It makes
          sseeensssseee to me.

 Johnny: I am absolutely-fucking-not staying for any more of this shit!
         No way!  Are you going to stay or are you coming with me?

 Elysium: I don't know.  (trails off)

 Johnny: (furious) What the hell?  How long have we known each other?
         Four years?  And how long have you known these people?  Two
         minutes?  And you're actually contemplating  staying with them
         to listen to them bad mouth?  Where's your sense of loyalty?
         Where's your sense of friendship?  What the hell?

 Elysium: That's just it.  it's been so long.  I'm bored.  I.  don't.  know.
          It's different with them, it's something fresh and interesting
          and all you ever are anymore is pain and misery.  Can you
          understand that when you walk by my side, it's like a walking
          cancer?  A death itself that consumes my heart.  My like a flame
          turned upside down.

 Johnny: The sun a severed neck!  We're leaving!  NOW! 

        [ He grabs Elysium and half-drags her off the stage.  The other
          half of her is willing to go with him.  It's not so much an
          external struggle so much as an internal one. ]

 Chorus: And while I can not say I have
         Gone to Hell for your love, 
         I have oft found myself there
         In your pursuit. 

        [ Lights dim. ]

                Interim Two - Heavy Metal or No Metal at All
                ============================================

        [ Elysium and Johnny enter on stage, and we realize they're
          halfway up the Tor now.  The ruins of the old church are
          visible from above and the sound of the drumming is almost
          deafening.  They enter and Johnny sits down on a bench, scared
          to go any further. ]

 Johnny: What do you think's up there? 

 Elysium: (wryly) If I had to guess, I'd say the Cult Members picnic. 

 Johnny: Shut the hell up, sub-human scum. 

 Elysium: (to no one at all) This love. for you my love. 

 Johnny: Heavy Metal. 

 Elysium: Hm?

 Johnny: Lyrics.  You're saying lyrics to a Pantera song.  Heavy Metal.

 Elysium: Oh, well, I had no idea.  Is this going to turn into your old
          time-honored speech about how as human beings we should try
          and elevate our emotions so they don't end up being direct
          mirrors of heavy metal lyrics?  Can you please tell me, once
          again, about how my current mental and emotional time frame
          are summed up by four guys destroying their instruments in the
          name of music?  And can you please, then add in that they
          aren't even human?  But are rather some sort of sub-human
          primate.

 Johnny: For use on sub-human primates and animals only. 

 Elyisum: What?

 Johnny: FOR USE ON SUB-HUMAN PRIMATES AND ANIMALS ONLY.  It's the label
         on the bottles of ketamine, special K, the wonder drug.

 Elysium: Answer me.

 Johnny: Well.  to be honest, sure, that's the speech you were going to
         get, but you kinda pre-empted it.

 Elysium: And how all of my joy can be summed up in a song by Extreme?
          And all of your angst towards me is just Type O Negative,
          pre-goth?  And how Bloody Cum clearly expresses all the hatred
          I can ever feel?

 Johnny: All of that, yes. 

 Elysium: Metallica, Megadeth, GWAR, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide,
          Cannibal Corpse, Man-o-War, Sepultura, Cradle of Filth,
          Entombed, Corrosion of Conformity, Iron Maiden, Danzig,
          G'N'F'N'R, Emperor, Nihilist, and Bolt Thrower?

 Johnny: (much ashamed) Yes. 

 Elysium: Well, great. 

(They pause for a long, long time.)

 Johnny: Well, what do we do now?

 Elysium: Go up the Tor?

 Johnny: What's up there? 

 Elysium: Probably just some kids with drums. 

 Johnny: What if it's something awful? 

 Elysium: Like what?

 Johnny: There are some things man is not meant to know.  What if it's
         something so horrible and hideous that we never recover?  The
         final snap of our minds.

 Elysium: Only one way to find out. 

 Johnny: I'm not kidding. 

 Elysium: Me either. 

 Johnny: I'm seriously scared. 

 Elysium: Don't be such a little girl.  Come up the Tor with me, my love.

 Johnny: (resolved to his fate) Fine.  I'm ready now.  Let's go.

        [ As they get up to go, enter on stage the Chorus in the guise of
          Heavy Metal people.  Guys and gals, who cares, right?  A healthy
          mix of both sexes, only slightly predominated by the men.  It
          should be made clear to us that they are coming down the Tor.
          From whatever was there. ]

 Elysium: (to Johnny) Look, do they look destroyed?  They came down from
          the Tor.  They're fine.  (to the Chorus) Hello, metal people.
          How are you?

 Leader: We're just fine, and yourself?

 Elysium: Oh, you know, just out for a stroll up the Tor. 

 Leader: I see. 

 Elysium: You would be able to tell us what that infernal racket coming
          down from the ruins is?  The drumming, what's it for?

 Leader: You don't want to know.  You also probably don't want to go up
         there.  I would not recommend it.

 Johnny: (nervous) Why?

 Leader: It can only lead to your downfall. 

 Johnny: I knew it.  Just as I know that our fate is there.  We're going
         to have to go up that Tor.

 Elysium: He's right.  I can feel it, too.  We've got to climb the Tor.
          We've got no other choice.

 Leader: Don't. 

 Johnny: We've got to.
 
 Chorus: (sung, of course, to the tune of Teddy Bear's picnic)
         If you go up to the Tor today
         You're sure of a big surprise.
         If you go up to the Tor today
         You'd better go in disguise
         For every pagan that ever there was
         Will gather there for certain because
         Today's the day the Cult Members have their picnic.

         Picnic time for Cult Members

         Because they're tired little Cult Members

 Leader: And you will surely find your own decay and dismay.  And yea,
         though you walk.

 Johnny: Why sing the song of the others?  

 Leader: We are the others. 

 Elysium: What?  

 Leader: Though we may appear as the grim visage of Heavy Metal, we are
         those who have followed you, guiding you through your life.

 Johnny: Oh, Jesus Christ, will just get the hell out of my way so I can
         scale the Tor?

 Leader: The cows!  The Women of the City!  The Heavy Metal!  We are all of
         them as they were us.  Heavy Metal or No Metal at All!  Wimps and
         Poseurs, Go on, Get out, Leave the Hall!  On this night, this
         night of all nights, there have been groups you have encountered,
         and we have been them all.  We have been following you, trying to
         guide you away from this ascent up the Tor, where you can find
         nothing but your own demise.

 Elysium: Only tonight?

 Leader: In the past, too.  You understand us fully now due to your
         altered psychic state.

 Elysium: (to Johnny) Maybe we shouldn't scale the Tor. 

 Johnny: What? What the fuck?  LOOK AT THEM, YOU STUPID BITCH!  They're
         just heavy metal people trying to fuck with us.  They probably
         read about pranks in the last issue of Guitar World and decided
         they should try one.  Fuck this.  (to the Chorus) Get the fuck out
         of my way.  I'm going up the Tor.

        [ Johnny begins to push his way through the Chorus, tossing
          members left and right until he gets to the other side.  Elysium
          has not followed, and a wall of metal now blocks them from each
          other.  Johnny looks back and just sighs, as if he had expected
          this result. ]

 Johnny: Push your way through.  Come on.  We've got to go up the Tor. 

 Elysium: I can't.

 Johnny: They're fucking lying to you!  This is all some stupid metal
         head prank!

 Elysium: I'm.  I'm not sure.

 Johnny: Ok.  Fine!  (To the chorus) Name a time in my past, not tonight,
         when you were present.

 Leader: Remember the Coca-Cola deal?  Does she know about the Coca-Cola
         deal?  Listen to my last words, any world.  Listen to my last
         words, any where.

        [ Johnny is visibly stricken, for he knows the truth now.  There's
          a long pause. ]

 Johnny: and what about in her life?  You didn't happen to be there, say,
         oh, four years ago, did you?  You know, the night she almost took
         on three guys?  You didn't happen to be the drunken louts that
         were on a mission of penetration, did you?

 Elysium: (shocked) What?

 Leader: (fumbling) Well, you see, that was necessary.  (pleading) We
         weren't going to rape you, we just needed to bring the two of
         you together.  so we could later split you apart.  We've been
         guiding and pruning the two of you for years.  Slow sculpture.
         You both needed each other.

 Elysium: (shocked) What?  

 Leader: Well, you see. 

        [ The leader is interrupted as Elysium leaps on the Chorus and
          begins to murder them all.  Johnny is hesitant for a moment,
          but then joins in the blood feast.  The lights dim.  When the
          lights come back up, Elysium and Johnny are covered in blood
          and barely able to walk on two legs, preferring all fours.
          They stare at each other for a while and then walk off stage.
          Various body parts are strewn about the stage floor.  Legs,
          arms, that sort of thing. ]

                     Scene Four - Ia!  Ia!  Cthulhu Ftagn!
                     ===================================

        [ The scene - The Tor!  In the middle of the stage is a solitary
          stone tower, the sole remains of an ancient church.  The tower
          can be entered from two different sides.  From within, the
          drumming.  Around the Tower fires burn bright Around the fires,
          pagans dance in the night.   The pagans are attired in the
          general dress of hippies. ]

 Pagan #1: is the Lord of the wood, even to.and the gifts of the men of
           Leng.  so from the wells of night to the gulfs of space, and
           from the gulfs of space to the wells of night, ever praises
           of Great Cthulhu, of Tsathoggua, and of Him Who is not to be
           Named.  Ever Their praises, and abundance to the Black Goat of
           the Woods.  Ia!  Shub-Niggurath!  The Goat with a Thousand
           Young!

 Group of Pagans: (in response) Ia!  Shub-Niggurath!  The Black Goat of
                  the Woods with a Thousand Young!

 Pagan #1: And it has come to pass that the Lord of the Woods, being
           seven and nine, down the onyx steps.  tributes to Him in the
           Gulf, Azathoth, He of Whom Thou has taught us marvels.on the
           wings of night out beyond space, out beyond the.to that
           whereof Yuggoth is the youngest child, rolling alone in black
           aether at the rim.

 Pagan #2: go out among men and find the ways thereof, that He in the
           Gulf may know.  To Nyarlathotep, Mighty Messenger, must all
           things be told.  And He shall put on the semblance of men, the
           waxen mask and the robe that hides, and come down from the
           world of Seven Suns to mock.

        [ Enter Johnny and Elysium.  They remain hidden, aside, where
          the pagans can not see them.  They watch the spectacle aghast
          with fright and terror. ]

 Pagan #1: Nyarlathotep, Great Messenger, bringer of strange joy to
           Yuggoth through the void, Father of the Million Favored Ones,
           Stalker among.

 Group of Pagans: (chanting) Ph-nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl
                  ftagn!

 Pagan #1: In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming!

 Pagan #2: That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange eons
           even death may die!

 Group of Pagans: Ia!  Ia!  Cthulhu ftagn! 

 Johnny: (aside and whispering to Elysium) Something must be done!  They
         mean to call up the black mercurial depths of chaos and release
         it on the world.  I've read certain.  dread books, I know of what
         they mean to do!

 Pagan #1: (speaking to one of the subordinate pagans) Bring me the Psalms
           of the Silent, for I need now to use it more than ever.

 Pagan #2: In a world on a fishhook, you're the wave.  

 Random Pagan: Speak not of Innsmouth this night!  Call not them to our
               gatherings!

 Elysium: (whispering to Johnny) What are they doing now?  What's that
          he's getting him?

        [ The subordinate Pagan goes to a remote area of the stage and
          fumbles with something, and returns carrying a book to the
          first Pagan.  He treats it as an object to be feared, and it
          seems almost as if he's carrying something highly explosive. ]

 Pagan #1: Psalms of the Silent!  That manuscript of unholy terror, a
           parchment made from the skins of unbaptized babies, and inked
           with blood drained directly from their still pulsing hearts.
           Speak now, speak now, ye dread gods, sing me your songs of
           sorrow.

 Johnny: (whispering to Elysium) It's the Psalms of the Silent.  Only
         scraps of information about it have filtered down.  It's an awful
         book.  I didn't realize any copies were extant.  At least they
         haven't brought out the Mad Arab's work, Abdul Alhazred.

 Pagan #2: (screaming out orders) Bring me the Necronicom!  Tonight Great
           Cthulhu from his house of R'lyeh is released, tonight Azathoth,
           the blind idiot god, tonight his pipers play a little louder,
           for the chaos expands, and Nyarlathotep brings a message of
           doom!  Ia!  Ia!  CTHLHU FTAGN!  Ph-nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu
           R'lyeh wgah'nagl ftagn!

 Group of pagans: (chanting) Ph-nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl
                  ftagn!

 Johnny: (whispering to Elysium) If they do what they mean to, our entire
         way of life, everything we have ever known, will cease.  We will
         become unwilling slaves to the Great Ones, and our only salvation
         from this new way of life will be in the natural release death
         brings.  For death will become an unguent, a soothing balm to
         dress the wounds inflicted on our souls, bodies, and minds.  And
         even then, death may not come, for we are dealing with such
         elements that master death itself.  They may not take kindly to
         their servants tapering into those black realms.

 Elysium: (whispering to Johnny) What can we do?

 Johnny: (whispering to Elysium) We've got to stop it.  Our only hope lies
         in murder.  Already we have murdered this night, the blood is
         still on our clothes.  We must revive it anew and use it to
         destroy them.

        [ One of the lesser Pagans brings forth the Necronomicon.  He holds
          it in his hands and stands next to Pagan #2. ]

 Pagan #1: Stop not with these books!  Bring the Pnakotic Manuscripts and
           fetch for me the Unaussprechlichen Kulten!  All of these and
           more will be needed on this night.

 Elysium: I don't know what these books are, but their very name inspires
          dread within my heart.  If simply a name can create such a
          resonance that it's passed down through racial memory, then what
          must be within these books?  We have to act.

 Johnny: Yes!  Yes!  (screaming) YES! 

 Elysium: STOP THIS NOW! 

        [ Johnny and Elysium storm into the middle of the ritual.  The
          Pagans stare, stunned, and the drums stop.  There's an awkward
          pause as no one knows what to do.  Everyone remains motionless.
          It's as if a spell has been cast and everyone has been petrified
          by its effects. ]

 Johnny: (screaming) I will not and can not allow this to happen! 

        [ He grabs a stick from the ground, and runs towards Pagan #1.
          He smashes in the face of Pagan #1, howling like a sick animal.
          As we hear the sound of the stick smashing against Pagan #1's
          face, it's as if the spell has been broken, and animation has
          been breathed back into their limbs.  Elysium leaps upon Pagan #2
          and begins rending him to shreds.  The drums beat again, now
          louder than ever.  Deafeningly loud.  The other Pagans being
          running around, trying to help their allies, but failing. ]

        [ Johnny and Elysium kill their victims and attack other Pagans,
          eventually slaughtering all the unholy worshipers.  The drums
          sound and intensity increases, over, and over, and over again
          with each new death.  When finally, nothing is left but the
          slaughtered corpses and the sounds of drums. ]

 Johnny: (screaming) WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE DRUMS?

        [ Johnny runs into the Tower and repeats: ]

 Johnny: (screaming) WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKKKKKKK ARE THOSE DRUMS? 

        [ From within the tower a scream of pain.  The drums cease.
          While this happens, Elysium runs around gathering all the
          dread manuscripts and throws them all into the fire. ]

 Elysium: No more.  

 Johnny: (yelling, echoing throughout the Tower and Tor) Finally, peace.

        [ Johnny comes out of the Tower, and goes over to Elysium, who has
          since fallen to the ground, and is rolling around in the
          coagulate gore and tears of her own making. ]

 Johnny: It's over. 

 Elysium: I guess.

 Johnny: Let's go home.

 Elysium: Home?  How far home?

 Johnny: All the way to America. 

 Elysium: I'm starting to come down.  Christ, I have a headache,
          Johnny-boy.

        [ They exit stage right. ]
