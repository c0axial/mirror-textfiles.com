        i have completely unknowingly managed to alienate everyone.
 me, being the pathetic thing that i am, and me, being a granite figure
 guarding the entrance to the place of all that is good.  before, there
 was some chance of someone entering and finding what is good.
 unfortunately, now, that is not the case.  i don't know why, but
 everyone's too scared to come anywhere near me, so i stand near the
 gate, lonely.

        while standing there, i look at the ground or at the gate.  i
 used to survey the good things inside.  that was back when people still
 weren't too afraid to enter.  but now that nobody ever seems to pass by
 me, or come near me, i find it too depressing to look in there because i
 know that nobody will ever see what's inside.

        i don't know if anybody is still in there.  it seems like it's
 been so long since anybody has gone in... maybe everyone who went in
 became so old that they died.  i can't get that old, i'm made out of
 stone.  kinda depressing, if you think about it.  but don't think about
 it too long, because you might realize that i'm really not all that bad
 of a guy and you've been avoiding me for this long for no reason.

        you see, that is everyone's problem.  they can't think about
 things for long enough anymore.  they think about something and then it
 disappears from their head before they can figure it out.

        that's just one of the problems with people today.  

        people just don't know anything.  they may think of me and fill
 up with hatred.  but they don't know why!  they don't bother to wonder
 why they hate me.  i am just made of stone.  but people hate me all the
 same.  that's completely irrational.  that's pure ignorance right there.

        well, what the hell.  i'm going to go inside the place.

        ok, there's nobody around.  there are trees, video games, books,
 old cars.  oh wait... there's a lady.  i'll walk over to her.

        she's running away from me through the tall grass.

        i'm yelling at her to come back.  no, she's still running away.

        oh, haha, she tripped on a stereo.  ok, now i've caught up with
 her.  i ask her how she's doing.  she just looks at me.  what?  my arm
 just moved.  my arm fell down quickly.  fell down right quick.  oh,
 there's a sword in my hand.  my sword cut through her body.  whoops.
 ehem.  i will return to my post by the gate.

        wow.  that was not so good.  there are some nearby people
 looking at me.  when they my gaze meets theirs, they turn and run away
 from me.  why?  why do these people constantly fear me?  what have i
 done?  i don't understand.  there are still some people looking at me.
 my left arm lifts up and its gun aims at them and shoots, knocks down a
 couple of them with a few shots.

        maybe i should return to guarding the gate to the place with lots
 of good stuff.  i just remembered how much i like it in there.  there
 are good books, and old cars and things.  everything that's good in this
 world.  why don't more people come to visit?  why are people so scared
 of me?

        i look at my feet.  it's beginning to rain.  i like the rain.  it
 helps plants to grow.  the cement sidewalk i'm standing on becomes a
 dark gray color.  nobody's anywhere.  people are so ignorant.  they
 don't understand.  they just don't know what they're doing.  they're
 missing out on someplace great, just because they're scared of me for
 some stupid reason.

        is it because i'm made of stone?
