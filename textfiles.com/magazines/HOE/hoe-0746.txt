        [ A coffee bar. ]

        [ LORI and RENEE sit with coffee.  Late twenties. ]

        [ They are fit and attractive.  Both wear tank tops and short
          shorts.  Their hair is pulled up casually. ]


                                     LORI
        . . . lazy-ass motherfucker was _drunk_ . . .

                                    RENEE
        Don't you _hate_ that?

                                     LORI
        Duh!  Like who doesn't?  I'm dumping his tired ass tomorrow.  I just
        hate those guys who get drunk and then don't want to do it.  Or they
        do it one time and then they fall asleep.

                                    RENEE
        That was what I liked so much about Danny . . .

                                     LORI
        Danny . . .?

                                    RENEE
        He was young and _clean_ and he didn't even drink or smoke.

                                     LORI
        Yeah?

                                    RENEE
        And, like, he wanted to do it every minute . . .

                LORI _laughs derisively._

                                     LORI
        My _ideal_ . . . just to like get to that point where you're getting
        enough so you're not constantly lying next to this flesh lump
        thinking, What about mine?

                                    RENEE
        Oh I know.

                _Pause_


                                    RENEE
        How is he, though?

                                     LORI
        Hmmn?

                                    RENEE
        Like, how is he?  How is he when he _can_ get it up?

                                     LORI
        Oh, sometimes I think I'll come out my _ears_ . . .

                _Pause_

                RENEE _looks at her_.  LORI _nods_.

                                     LORI
        But like the other nine times out of ten I'm laying there making out
        my shopping lists with two fingers doing all the work.

                                    RENEE
        Too bad.

                                     LORI
        Yeah.

                LORI _sips her coffee.  She sighs._

                                     LORI
        Motherfucker.
