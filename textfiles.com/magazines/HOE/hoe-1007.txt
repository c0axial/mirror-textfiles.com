 > Stephen

	dear stephen!  listen!  have you ever been to tennessee!  it is a
 horrible place!  sons of bitches have that horrible drawl-y accent!  
 people who live there always go around and "y'all" everybody!  they
 "y'all" at the gas station, "y'all" in church, and "y'all" in school!  
 police officers "y'all" you when they give you a traffic ticket!  judges
 "y'all" you when setting bail!  it's all a bunch of "y'all amughnafv
 drinkabeer mnafeale cigarette adgmnnsdg go fishin'?"!  what the hell is
 that!

	how can people that stupid make whiskey so good!

	but it's true!  jack daniels is some really fine shit!  so, i
 don't know! i probably can't help you with this!  i think you should
 drink more of it, actually!  drink up! driiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnkkkkkkkkkkkk
 iiiiiiiittttttttttt!

	honestly, i don't know what your problem is!  have a great day!

	nathan!  here's what to do, little squirt!  the way to control
 your browser instead of the other way around, is with java!  using java,
 you can implement a browser-embedded browser!  it's true!  in java, write
 a browser program!  then, use netscape or internet explorer to load your
 java browser!  that's right!  use your browser to browse into another
 browser!  and browse the web from within your java browser! by using a
 piece of my java code, you can hide your browser from parentguard!  isn't
 technology wonderful!

	i have written a java function which can hide your browser from
 the parentguard software!  you will need to use this code in your java
 browser, otherwise, it won't work!  to get this code i wrote, visit my
 home page! go to http://deadnakedbabies.net/java/browsers.html!

	haha!  catch 22!

	fred!

	fred fred fred!

	there are a lot of problems here!

	i assume that you met cindy through a friend!  obviously you have
 been "set up" with someone who is "nice and caring"!  this is not the
 kind of person who will give you bang for your buck!  she probably wants
 to talk about her "feelings" and "dreams", and things like "lasting,
 fulfilling relationship" and asking you to "care for her needs"!  rather
 than take her shopping for lubricants, she wants you to take her for
 walks in the park, romantic dinners, and sunsets on the beach!

	is this the kind of life you are looking for!

	luckily for you, i've been through all this before!  woah, i was
 outta there fast!  listen, chap!  you need to sleep around!  the whole
 "steady" relationship model is outdated!  modern women have been
 corrupted by web sites like "ivillage.com" and "women.com" and all that!
 they feel "liberated" and "empowered" and all that shit!  can you stand
 it!  can you!  the answer is no!  you can't stand it!  women need to
 think more like the sex bots us guys want them to be!

	so listen!  you're 19!  you want to score with younger women!  
 (trust me -- you do!)  go to some local high schools!  attend the
 football games and the friday night dances!  you'll find the kinds of
 girls (and cheerleading squads) you need to fill your bed!

	in other words, cindy probably won't ever sleep with you!  so,
 find another cindy!

	i do not provide computer advice!

	actually, i do!  get rid of your computer!

	listen!  i usually tell people that i will answer any question and
 give free advice!  but listen!  i don't care about your computer problem!  
 i don't want to help you!  figure it out yourself and go away!

	i hope this helps!

	dear marjorie!  whales are beautiful animals!  the sounds they
 emit as speech truly soothe the soul!  in fact i have a cd at home that
 is just the sounds of the ocean waves and whales!  i put it on "repeat"
 when i go to sleep sometimes!

	it makes me sad when there are tv shows about whale hunting!  who
 wants to hunt a whale!  what the hell good is a dead whale!  those things
 are huge and they take up too much real estate when they wash ashore!  
 makes me think twice about trying to buy that pacific coast beachfront
 property!

	even though they show those whale hunting shows, i really love the
 discovery channel!  i've learned a lot by just watching that show!

	i would love for someone to stage a science experiment where a
 baby human lives his or her life entirely in front of a tv which is tuned
 to the discovery channel!  imagine the things we could learn from this
 experiment!  no exposure to other humans!  not a second of mtv!  no "real
 world" or "yo mtv raps" or "road rules"!  no "channel surfing"!  no video
 games!  no state of alabama!  no corrupt government!  no brainwashing!
 just television -- perhaps the finest technological innovation ever!

	god, almost makes me want to go back to school and work towards a
 ph.d., just so i can work on this project!

	marjorie!  thank you for giving me a new direction in life!  you
 have motivated me to pursue higher education!  cheers!

 > (or even millenium?) Thank you kind esteemed sir.
 > Douglas

	sir!  i will answer your question!

	however, my kind esteemed colleague, nick, would advise me that
 the millennium still has one more year to go!  by the way, you
 mis-spelled "millennium," you jackass!

	but let us talk about some of the most important advances in our
 society for the past 100 and 1000 years!

	let me pause for a moment and remind you that i will not do your
 homework ever again!

	some of my friends might think i would refer to the television as
 one of the finest inventions ever!  this is not true!

	no conversation of this kind would be complete without some
 discussion of the fine inventions of the phonograph and the lightbulb!  
 now, most people would blabber some drivel like "the phonograph and the
 lightbulb are two of the finest inventions ever"!  but this is a bunch of
 cack!  the finer invention was actually thomas edison himself!  his
 parents, who, without knowing about it in advance, invented thomas
 edison, who was, undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant inventors ever!
 do you like the way i just used six commas in one sentence!  ha!  i sure
 do!

	honestly though, what could ever be more beautiful than the
 well-used human brain!  if only this world had more edisons and
 einsteins!  god damn you, jerry springer!

	i won't get into it now, but i have a theory about how jerry
 springer is a direct ancestor of every piece of white trash on this
 planet!

	in any case, one of the best inventions in just the past few years
 is e-commerce!  let me tell you something!  a little cute graphical
 shopping cart on every web site in the world is my goal!  we need to
 launch head-on into a world of buzzword-enabled technology like
 e-business, e-commerce, e-investing, e-petstores, e-bookstores,
 e-drugstores, e-toystores, e-carshopping, e-travelplanning, e-romance,
 and e-dining!

	i am an e-consumer!  hear me roar!

	all this self-serving technology has also unfortunately
 transformed society in evil ways!  young, geeky boys are learning how to
 set up web sites long before they learn how to maintain a conversation,
 or take a shower!  so undoubtedly, the next technology to snap into place
 will be the industry of fertility commerce!  using just a mouse and a web
 site, you guys out there can have your sperm shipped to a single woman in
 alaska so she can create a baby eskimo from your popscicle of love!  all
 this without one second of social interaction or foreplay!

	all it takes is venture capital to make things happen!
