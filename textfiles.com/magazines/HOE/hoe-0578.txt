        Polaroids of girls asses lined up on the wall.  At first it was
 un-noticable then with a quick turn of the head and a glance, "Are those
 asses on your wall?!@#"

        Now for the sake of being a nice guy, I will remove names from this.

        We will have "Girl A", "Girl B", and "Guy A", whom of course is
 dating "Girl A".

        Guy A: "Why yes, those are asses on the wall."
           Me: "Why are Girl A & Girl B putting pictures of their asses on
                that wall?"
        Guy A: "Well, they want to figure out what the need to work on."
           Me: "Your girlfriend has a nice ass."
        Guy A: "Yep."  <he smiles.>  "But look at this..."

        At this point he points to a point on the picture where black marker
 was used to induce desired shape of butt area and thigh area on girls A and
 B, also noting a misplaced black spot on girl B's ass making it look as
 though she wishes to design her self a new orifice.

        At this point he points out that, although it is a disturbing
 concept, the pictures on the wall tend to be quite artistic.  So for the
 readers sake, there are 8 picutes, alternating from the beginning, of
 ABABABAB.  Or BA, who knows, for they are asses.

        This conversation concluded with a brief dialog.

           Me: "Do you think there are any guys on the planet who would do
                such a thing to determine wheter or not they had nice
                asses?"
        Guy A: "Well, no, but we'd sit around and look at playboy."

        At this point the new issue of playboy was broken out and we stared
 at other asses, asses of girls that perhaps look at their pictures and try
 and figure out where they need to fix their asses, for as they are already
 probably fake from the top down, there is never enough vanity in the world.
