        one day the little lamb said to the pig:

        "we should run away!"

        so the pig packed his bags so he could run away.

        then he found out his good friend the little lamb had been sold.
 he was crushed.  all he knew to exist was gone and broken and destroyed
 so he walked to the very end of the field and climbed over the tall
 fence that was supposed to keep him in then he kept walking and passed
 over a bridge and through a valley.  he stayed on the side of the road
 every night.  one day, as he was crossing a large road, a drunk man in
 a jeep ran him over.  the drunk man was hungry -- so was his pet wolf,
 so he took the pig home and made dinner.

        two days later he went to the doctor and found out he had some
 mysterious virus... then he died.  he did not have very many friends
 and only his faithful wolf, kldsajfls, came when the poor wolf saw his
 dead owner in the casket.  he broke the plastic cover and tore off his
 dead owner's head.  with no place to live he wadered the streets eating
 lost wallets and eyeglasses.

        one day he wondered into a strange room with flashing lights and
 lots of people.  it was hot and there was loud loud noise in the
 background.  he was very sacred so he ran out side and jumped into a
 river.  then he drowned, almost.  a nice old lady in a wheel chair that
 had been parelized from the neck jumped in to try and save him.  when
 she did this, she realized that she really was not frozen and that for
 many years doctors had been lieing to her.  she now found most of the
 world to be very evil, so she stabbed her thigh with the fork she had
 been eating mashed potatoes with.  when the ambliance came, her cat
 clawed their eyes out and ate them because the little old lady didn't
 know how to feed her cat.

        another ambliancce came soon.  but it found a very unhappy thing.
 a dead old lady with mashed potatoes on her legs and a poisened cat and
 two amblience poeple with no eyes, just bloody stuff where they should
 have been.  one of the ambliance peopel was a young man named Hendrik.
 he was already very depressed because of breaking up with his
 girlfriend who he loved very much.  he tried to poke his own eyes out
 with the dead cats paws but his partner caught him and took him to a
 nice place with nice white rooms.

        and nice white beds.

        and nice white clothes.

        and nice white people.

        and nice white food.

        and a nice white life he lead.

        until he died.

        they barried him under a white tomb stone.

        in a white casket.

        wearing a white suit.
