 rock my soul! i did in your mother's bosom last night, a joke.  perhaps the
 ad on the bus indicated legumes lagasse emeril emeril lagasse might go
 something like this:

        EMERIL LAGASSE:  Hi, I'm Emeril Lagasse and there's a few facial
                         moles.

	FACIAL MOLE 1:   Hi, I'm Emeril Lagasse and here's a facial mole.

	FACIAL MOLE 2:   Hi, I'm Emeril Lagasse.

	EMERIL LAGASSE:  Hi, I'm a facial mole.

 some day, i will become famously rich and famous with my discovery of the
 invention of the coinage of the thing where people come home at the same
 time.  just like me 'n' dad, we go everywhere together.  preceeding alex's
 law, it will become the psychology today of the time (actually tomorow
 then) and it won't even be raining lightly.  i think the 'neurologicate'
 Christopher " 'emerald' emeril lagasse" Knowles said it best--

	one two three one two three one twooo three do si do si do si

                  [and much later, since the movements are like 20 minutes]

	fu do si fu do si fu do sir

	"The Center gives you thirty days...
	"Go to New York a Phonic Center on Ele...
	"Please Call Br9-5555... (...)
	"Al these are the days my friends and thse are teh days my friends.
         Look... batch catch hatch latch amtch patch watch snatch scratch...
	 Look.

 certainly was an odd fellowe, i must say. dr. A. Argeo "chip" Octagon has
 novocaine lidocaine don't touch my cane cocaine lo mein but why didn't _I_
 go for the M.D.?  it was probably the lush chords.  also, and that i
 couldn't stand cuttin' folks up.  sure, i wasn't sure surely if they
 wouldn't let me get by without it but i certainly ain't a bettin' man and
 that certainly wasn't no time for inquiry, no suh.  i'm black.  can't you
 tell//?

 i will be paid a weekly stipend to follow the drum major and make sweet
 love.  hold on, i'm comin! cadences are easy so far, but there's this
 steve gadd thing coming up that might take work.  and i've got the big
 drum.

 The actual writing of the chorale itself only took me about fifteen
 minutes--last night, using Finale 2000.  The problem clearly was that
 instead of a joined bass and treble clef, I ended up with seperate SATB
 that couldn't share each other's staves (two treble, an octave-treble,
 and a bass).  The end really packs a punch with its flowing baroquality
 (don't be condescending, mein friend).  I never had time to fill in the
 gaps, just ignore 'em.  Me.  Shuffle only on beats 4 and 4+.

 [two months later]

 it's not that i'm ebarrassed, but the whole deal really was overly
 simplefied and i did just let the whole thing run.  video game music,
 everything i did there.

 Don't ever use ma huang or other ephedrine-containing products on a
 recreational/self-help basis.  Ever.  Most peoples' hearts are strong
 enough to take it, but the withdrawal after even a day or two is not worth
 it.  Responding to the ephedrine's (chronic?  does that mean
 "lung-related"?) respiratory anti-inflamatory and decongestant properties,
 at ~T+10h and for  the following ~4 days, upper breathing passages will be
 uncomfortably and conspicuously constricted.  What is worse is probably the
 ever-present sensation of having to empty one's stomach, as the back of the
 tongue is being irritated by the swollen throat walls and tonsils.  I had
 expected some sort of "tolerance" to the nonmedicated state to roll around
 after a day or two, but no luck.  Natural relief only comes after being
 frightened or woken up, when adrenaline is released.  Adrenaline has very
 similar effects to ephedrine (ephedrine being originally synthesized as an
 ingestible alternative to adrenaline for treatment of bronchial
 inflammation, then later made obselete by pseudoephedrine and 'new'
 synephrine).  On the other hand, this has been a very reassuring lesson in
 why not to do drugs.

 Palpitations are pretty frequent now.  Caffeiene leads to a sensation of
 severe pressure and nausea radiating from the upper chest.  Small amounts
 of alcohol are scary.  Right now i'm sort of just riding this out and
 waiting for something to happen.  There's a very blurry line between
 psychosematics and actual events right now.  It's taken a conscious effort
 to ignore the frequent sensation of being choked...

 Dinner parties/folk jam sessions with aging ex-hippies who just spent 10
 years in a cult in the desert but who are now heading back to their jewish
 roots can be enriching in several ways.

 After a paper cup of wine and a slice of pie:

	"Watch me make fun of my husband," Sylvia said with a giggle.
	"Hey, watch out, she's about to make you look bad," Eddie warned.
        "Don't worry, I've got my hearing aid in," Pete reassured Eddie
         and the rest of the eager crowd.
        "Yeah, but now you can't hear low frequencies," Eddie said in his
         typical quasi-boast.
        "Aah, not in this ear, though," Pete quickly retorted, wary of
         learning a lesson at the hands of Eddie.  "In this ear, I can hear
         low frequencies better than anyone."
        "Especially...  FLATULENCE."  Sylvia giggled and then cast a dead
         silence.
	"Barbarigmus, too."
        "What, you can hear Puertoricans?" Sylvia bubbled, sending the
         entire post-1940's ex-New York City crowd into hysterics.  Sylvia
         like to pretend she was drunk.

 The big Indian drums were unsyncopated and the tablas were difficult and i
 was glad when it was over.

 "DYNNE" - "POR QUE OREGANO NO ME CAE BIEN AHORA"
 Por Mr A Jim

 Recibí un resfriado en el medio del día. Moco claro viajaba
 consecuentemente abajo, abajo de los ojos y la nariz, abajo a la garganta.
 Me duele la cabeza, pero me duele la gente especialmente. Cuando entramos
 Pakistan, ¿por qué debemos estar asuntos a los chistes de los otros
 naciones? Mucho como sentando en química, tener un enfermedad facial puede
 doler la posibilidad de recibir regalos para un comentario erudito.

 Al parecer, cuando no puede continuar la legado de McCarthy, no puede ganar
 respeto de 'botes, compañeros de clase, ni quasi-enemigos de Asia del
 sureste. Al parecer, cuando no estamos ásperos y pendencieros sobre que es
 más allá de crimén (relaciones extranjeras), mentiras serán distributadas
 fácilmente. Aún si lo hacemos perfectamente claro que nuestra esperanza
 sólo es reinstalar la democracia en el país, lo será notado que estamos
 super-agresivos/molestos/irónicamente «inmaduro» y no que tenemos moco
 claro viajaba abajo la cara. El buck se para aquí, y un orificio nasal
 rojo para todos.

 En aprendiendo que Jordan fue aún vivo, la decisión fue rápidamente hecha
 arrojarme en el lago.  Esa decisión fue rápidamente inversada. Quizá fue
 que la disputa sobre Kashmir (y algunas armas nucleares) derramó en la
 percepción de relaciones extranjeras y mentiras distributadas. Me gusta
 pensar que el problema completo es que su presidente tiene un resfriado.
