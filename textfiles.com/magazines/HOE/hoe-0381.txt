        INTRODUCTION, bringing form to common notions

        Know the Face of Ego
        ====================

        The ego is the tool of the unconscious and the foundation of the
 conscious.  Motivations of conscious action (the voice of the ego) can be
 heard plainly, and many of the voices can be given faces.

        - "I want to be" (instinct)
        - "I want to be valid to me" (Logos)
        - "I want to be valid to the outside" (Eros)

        Much of psychology and philosophy is basically derived from these
 statements.

        Know the Face of Internet
        =========================

        The internet and computers are the ultimate tool of the human
 mind as cars and giant cranes are the ultimate tool of the human body.

        For most, the internet and their computers means a whole spectrum
 of activities from talking to friends to downloading pornography.

        Seen from the eyes of a programmer like myself though the
 internet is a new universe of input and output.  (mostly input), where
 one intakes information that s/he wants that others willing put out.
 One finds intellecaul stimulus, sexual stimulus, and then, yes, ego
 stimulus (ego inflation).

        KNOWING INFLATED EGO IN YOURSELF AND ON THE INTERNET
        ====================================================

        The sound of ego inflation thus "I am most valid.  I will defend
 the validity of myself to no end with outside contradictoring voices.  I
 will show them I am most valid, and, if I can't, then they do not exist
 to me any longer and I pity or hate them and praise myself".

        If you have ever played a game, any game, on the internet, then
 it is very probable that you have expeirenced an inflated ego for games
 to them are like mud to pigs.  There objective is not to stimulate their
 minds and executing trival, distractive objectives (having fun).  It is
 to win, to earn merit for their ego.

        In a much more corruptable venue we see their absurd and many
 times annoying arguements, essays, and actions.  Such as the things
 'DARWIN' pointed out in his critique of the internet (HOE #373).

        Ego inflation directly corrupts and makes one blind to the
 outside when all s/he can see is itself.

        "An inflated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of
 nothing but its own existance. It is incapable of learning from the past,
 incapable of understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing
 right conclusions about the future. It is hypnotized by itself and
 therefore cannot be argued with. It inevitably dooms itself to
 calamities that must strike it dead."

                       -- Psycgology and Alchemy (1944). In CW 12. P. 563
