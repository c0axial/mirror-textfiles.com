	I am very aware that there is an extremely extended list of people
 that are not worthy of existing.  HOE lately has made this quite clear.
 Although I hardly understand why everybody is writing about killing
 people -- Granted the fact that murder is illegal, so it's better to act
 it out in a t-file rather than dealing with your psychotic possessed
 friend who constantly rambles about killing some Tim boy.  But that still
 is not a valid reason.

	I wish to inform you, dear co-HOE-workers, that killing (or writing
 about killing) someone is the easy way out!  My suggestion is that you
 should leak embarrassing information about them in the 'zine scene until
 they get so depressed and ashamed of themselves that they end up killing
 themselves, thus sparing you the jail time and mental health care.  Revenge
 is sweet, homocide is not.

        I suppose that some people are like me and have a hard time making
 fun of people using the all-time creativity and wit tools (Ref: HOE #280),
 but at least you may get credit for trying.  Apparently the fact that I
 dated the boy described in HOE #280 made it seem a little funnier.
 Apparently.  anyways.

	There is really no point to this t-file, I don't care if you write
 about murder or even if you've actually murdered.  The real point of this
 t-file is to assure myself that I am still very capable of dumping crap
 into a .txt, somehow managing to get it posted on HOE, coming off looking
 like a retarded no-life modem girl and totally disrupting your new HOES
 reading.  It makes my day to know that I made yours just that much
 shittier.  I realized that I've sounded like an idiot throughout this
 measely file, but that is just something I'm willing to accept.  Good Day.
