        Part One
	--------

        Norman got up.  It was a pretty average Sunday morning.  He had a
 pullover buzz from all the pot he'd been smoking the night before.  It was a
 good pullover, though - the kind that hummed and made him want to do shit.
 Understanding that, it is logical that Norman would get out of bed and say
 to himself, "I think I'll go do shit."  Which is what he did.

        Norman went downstairs to the kitchen.  He looked at the wall for a
 long time.  He didn't know why - he just liked the wall.  Maybe it had
 something to do with the massive grease stains etched into the plaster.
 Eventually, his mother, who was also zoned out because she was taking a lot
 of Prozac to recover from the death of her poodle, Mitzi, noticed him.

        "Good morning, hon," she said.  "Want some haggis?"

        "Suck my ass it smells," said Norman.

	"Okay, hon."


	Part Two
	--------

	Norman finished eating his haggis and headed out to go to the 
 supermarket.  He had to buy more cow intestines and a nice juicy sheep's
 heart so his mom could make him more haggis.  On his way to the store,
 Norman decided to smoke more pot.  He loaded his bullet and finished off two
 bowls before reaching the place which some might have denoted as a candidate
 for quite possibly being the location where a man might have built a
 structure that could be construed as a grocery store, i.e., supermarket.

        Inside the store, Norman saw a big isle filled with spatulas.  Oh,
 how he loved spatulas.  You see, Norman had his own spatula at home that he
 often used to lift his haggis from the pot.  He preferred a spatula with
 little holes in it, because it allowed the blood to drain out and gave him
 pure, unadulterated, 100% haggis.  Norman might have bought another spatula
 then and there, but he couldn't because he only had just enough money to get
 the animal guts.  He *did* have his priorities, after all.

	As he neared the meat counter, many people stared at him with a 
 demeaning look.  "Hee hee," they said, "it's the haggis boy!"  Norman just
 stared back and walked up to the counter.

	The guy who sold the haggis to him smiled and said, "Hee hee, haggis
 boy, do you like eating haggis all the time?"

        "Suck my ass it smells," said Norman.

        "Hee hee, but why would I suck your ass?  What does it smell like?"

        "Haggis."

	"Hee hee, why does it smell like haggis?"

        "Because I shove the haggis up my ass before I eat it."

        It was true.  All true.  Norman had what the doctors called a phallic
 obsession.  They said it had something to do with the way he was born.
 Apparently when he came out of the womb, the doctor, while meaning to cut
 the umbilical cord, had mistakenly lopped off about half his penis.  They
 had been able to repair the damage, but it was still a lot shorter than it
 should have been.  Ever since, though, he had grown a passion for putting
 penis-shaped objects up his ass.  He wasn't gay; he just liked sticking
 things up his ass.  It happens, ya know.  It happens all the time.

	Norman grabbed his haggis and gave the evil man the money, then left
 the store, but not before taking one last longing look at the spatulas.


	Part Three
	----------

        As Norman drove home, he started thinking about his car.  He had a
 decent enough car, he supposed.  It was shiny and blue.  It had no horns or
 lights, however, but that was okay with him because it meant that when he
 was out doing a drug deal at night he could cut off his lights and not worry
 about people seeing him.  The car also had a shitty sound system.  The
 speakers were really old and half busted, but he had a 5-disc changer in the
 back that he used.  He always had the same five CDs in it - Pieces Of You
 (Jewel), The Craft soundtrack, Aenima (Tool), Breathless (Kenny G), and the
 TMNT soundtrack.  Needless to say, people made fun of Norman for his shitty
 music.  Girls thought he was a wussy boy.  He didn't care.  He preferred to
 ride around and smoke pot while he listened to Kenny G than to get laid.

	About ten miles from his house, Norman saw a pond in a small patch of
 woods.  He decided to go out there and smoke another bowl before he went
 home.  He got out of the car, took his drugs and drug paraphernalia with
 him, and sat on a large clump of fungus that was growing on a tree trunk.
 As he was about to light his bowl, he heard sloshing sounds from the middle
 of the little pond.  It was a fisherman.

        Norman HATED fishermen.  He was convinced they were evil.  They
 killed fish in the most evil way - by making them suffocate themselves to
 death.  Eating haggis was different, because the animal was already dead
 when they got the organs, and besides, they killed the cows and sheep
 quickly with a gun or knife; but killing and eating a fish was downright
 cruel.  A tear appeared in the corner of Norman's eye.  He wiped it away and
 threw his bowl down on the ground.

        "Hey, there, buddy," said the fisherman.  "Come out here to fish?"

        "Suck my ass it smells," screamed Norman.

        The fisherman laughed and then said, "What's that, sonny?  Your truck
 has a bass smell?  You musta been fishing alot!"

        "SUCK MY ASS IT SMELLS!," he screamed again, a bit louder.

        "Oh!  Well, then, have a nice day!"

	Norman grabbed his shit, walked slowly back to his car, finished his
 bowl, listened to a few Jewel songs, and then went home.
