        This past week I went to Minneapolis for the Alpha Phi Omega
 national conference (see http://www.apo.org/ i think).  Then after the
 conference I stayed with my friend Katie who I had met in Scotland.

        Minneapolis is fucking freezing. For the hotel portion of my stay
 there were convenient "skywalks" which connected the whole city.  I met
 lots of people and didn't leave the two hotels which housed our
 conference.

        I watched Xena warrior princess a lot and became entranced.

        One morning I woke up and the girl I was sharing a bed with,
 Megan, was scratching my back.  Later she did not remember and blushed
 when I mentioned it.  She had been half asleep and thought I was her
 boyfriend.  She is a really good back scratcher.

        I met a bunch of mad irc-ers like myself, 'cept they hang out
 in #aposoc. Now I have a new channel to hang out in. fUn

        Anyhow, I met some people who were just as weird as me and the
 h0ef0lk.

        Then I stayed with Katie.  Katie drives a zamboni.  But she
 doesn't do it well, so she's quiting.  She's sleepy and a vegetarian
 but she's not Soybean.

        It was so cold that when we walked from her work at the rink to
 her house her nose ring was stinging!

        We saw this movie and everywhere we went there were lovely beings
 with elven locks about their heads.  Such eye candy in such a cold cold
 city.

        Katie lives in a section near the U of M called Dinkytown.  No
 joke.  It lives up to its name, but there are cool stores and cafes
 anyhow.  Like 3 used clothing stores, 3 used CD stores, a comic/rpg
 shop, a student travel place, a breakfast place, a falafel place, an
 occult store, subway, pizza hut, a movie house, and several markets.
 Dinky but funky.

        I'd live there if I could stand it.  'cept katie says that wasn't
 the worst.  She says that sometimes you walk down the street and your
 eyelashes stick together and the scarf sticks to you from the
 condensation of your mouth.

        I stayed in katie's room while she was at work reading Jeanette
 Winterson's oranges are not the only fruit and contemplating my life.
 Then I went shopping in Dinkytown. Got some CDs but couldn't find
 Dragon tarot.

        I had a good time in Minneapolis, but I froze my tits off!
