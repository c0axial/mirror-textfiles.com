     This sentence pretty much sums up why I dislike Ani so much.  Not
 only does she go and support a womyn convention (which is, in and of
 itself, absolutely fucking ridiculous), but here she goes again making
 sure *everybody* in the whole wide world knows she's bisexual.

     I am not intimidated by Ani's clitoris in the least, and she
 certainly doesn't impress me.  People like her are a dime a dozen,
 and I'm sick and tired of them flaunting and gallivanting all over the
 place.  I see them at the bars, at the bookstores, at the 7-11, at the
 schools and the concerts, in the sewers and the carnivals and the gas
 stations - everywhere, like spread-eagled hookers baiting for the
 hook, line and sinker.

     Ani, just in case you're more stupid than I thought and you have
 an internet account, I just want you to know that I am not biting the
 worm.  You will *never* get any of my money unless it's an accident.
 I don't care if you like eating pussy, okay?  As a matter of fact, I
 don't care if you like sucking cock either.  Your sex life and
 preferences are painfully uninteresting, loud, and old.  Get a new
 shtick or find a job.

     For any and all Dan Bern discussions, of course!
