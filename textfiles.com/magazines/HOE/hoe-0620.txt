        In light of the recent events in Littleton, CO, I have heard a lot
 of shit on the news.  Mostly about the 'Goth' scene perverting and warping
 the minds of young people.  It apparently causes them to hurt themselves
 and others, againth their will mind you!  They don't want to do these
 things!  It's the music!  It's scientifically proven.  The people in the
 TV say so.  So it must be true.  TV doesn't lie, and no one on TV would
 abuse their power to propagate a myth that has persisted for the entire
 century.

        Anyway, back to my text file. 

        It has occurred to me that turnabout is fair play, so I will now
 endeavor to prove that all drug usage during the 1960's was caused by the
 Doors, Jimmi Hendrix, The Beatles, et infinitum. 

        *ahem*

        *Points Camera at self*

        The lyrics of the bands of the 60's, alluding to Marijuana smoking,
 the usage of LSD and many other ilicit drugs caused the unwilling
 corruption of thousdand and millions of Americans.

        Point proved?

        No... I don't think so.  I would like to ask anyone who reads this to
 think a little for themselves.  We all knwo that many socio-economic factors
 go into the general music and lifestyle trends of any age group or
 generation.  During the 60's the time was right for people to get high and
 rebel like they never rebelled before.  In the 90's the goth scene is a
 showing of the large number of youths disaffected by the power hungry and
 success driven people ho run this country and our lives (well, at least the
 parts beyond our control).  It's not there because it wants to corrupt
 America's youth, it's been there since the 80's, and is only now becoming
 popular because it appeals to a large portion of the population.  Art
 imitates life, not vice-versa.  Anyone who thinks otherwise os severely
 dilluded and needs an extensive ass kicking by reality.

        Don't accept the reasons given to you!

        Think for yourself!

        Mediocrity must not rule our lives!
