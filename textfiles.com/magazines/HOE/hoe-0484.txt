        Every Monday through Thursday, from 6:30 to 8:30 I experience what
 most would call "utter torture"... also known as Michigan's Driver
 Education Program.

        For two hours, our class sits, awaiting something interesting and
 new to happen, while trying every possible method to keep themselves,
 individually, from falling asleep.

        Now, this class wouldn't be that bad, but our teacher, all 500 lbs
 of him (literally)... well, _he's_ not a good thing.  Everyday we listen
 to him ramble on horror stories of gruesome deaths, errors in driving,
 past students that are 'beautiful', and past "preppie" students, that he
 says are going to Harvard, and other 'top' schools now.  And... you can
 hear the fat in his throat, gurgling around and choking his sentances and
 words off... I sit and tap my pen, alternate seating positions, play with
 my hair, or play drum beats of random songs with my feet. I'm a good
 student because I paid in full and I don't let anything slip out of my
 mouth, except sometimes a thank you. I just want to scream at him...
 
        "GET ON A FUCKING EXERCISE BIKE!"

        "QUIT EATING MCDONALDS EVERY GODDAMN DAY!"

        "WHY DON'T YOU _TEACH_?!"

        But I doubt that any of the students in my class would listen
 anyways.  In between their little hidden clique talks, and under-the-
 -breath remarks about the teacher, they find time to open their text book
 and write down word-for-word answers onto the cheap copies of text book
 dittos made on a zerox machine, clearly from the mid-eighties.

        I stumble out of class each night, staring straight ahead, wiping
 my eyes in the hopes of waking up.
