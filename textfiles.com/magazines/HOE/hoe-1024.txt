                tertiary evidence: Damon Krukowski's Constant Whining

 I've asked numerous times to be removed from your list --

	Who or what is Damon Krukowski?
	I asked basehead and that child molesting asshole said, "Damon
 Krukowski used to be in a band called Galaxie 500 with some Asian half
 breed bitch named Namoi and some green kiwi bastard. I think he still
 balls that whore and together they put out retarded books by Surrealists
 and proto-Surrealists on their press Exact Change which is really just a
 tax shelter and money laundering front for the mob."
	Krukowski is also a schmuck who keeps emailing Mogel, that sexless
 fiend, in a pathetic attempt to keep us from spamming him every week.
 Well, that ain't gonna happen. We just *laugh* at your sorry ass, Damon.
 With bellowing laughs and vicious hate in our eyes we see each new email
 and think to ourselves, "hahha, your worthless educated college band
 music won't do anything for you now! Not with HOE on the scene to fill up
 your precious mailbox with an extra 2k once in a while!"
	Then we circle jerk each other and congratulate ourselves on how
 evil we've made HOE. Bitches like Seaya and Phairgirl may make asses of
 themselves in every public forum they get, but that's only because
 they're cock hungry and desperate for attention. And besides, just
 because everything they say is to compensate for their genetic (read:
 byproduct of their sex) inability to write an effective sentence, just
 because of THAT, doesn't mean that we need to throw the message out with
 the messenger.
	They're right, you know. Mogel, myself, and that ruthless slut,
 Meenk, all conspired in one great big circle of pure evil in an attempt
 to figure out just what exactly would /ruin/ HOE. We decided to turn it
 into a cheap little clique and kick out all the fucking proletariat who
 had decidated their years and hard efforts to the factory, and laugh as
 they were crushed beneath the grinding wheels of our own monstrous egos.
	Speaking of meenk, she ate someone's shit. 
	Getting back to Damon Krukowski, that race traitor... man, this
 guy just pisses me off. His entire press is dedicated to the truly OUT
 THERE documents of the past 150 or so years, yet he refuses to read HOE?
 Hoe is probably the last living testament to the entire
 Surrealistist/Cubist/Dadaist/Futurist legacy, and this cock chugging cum
 addict can't even read us? This fucking paragon of the written word? He
 can't stoop to read what the KIDS have to say about those familiar artist
 themes his entire pathetic insular little life is based on?
	What an asshole. A real fucking asshole.
	His mom is a cunt, too.

                                second evidence: OLDMANMURRAY.COM 
	
	God, I hate these pieces of shit. These guys have benefitted from
 the internet more than probably anyone else in the entire world. You
 might think closeted homosexuals like former CEO of ids.net, Andrew
 Green, or capitalist pigs like Jeff Bezos, whose tricky mixture of stock
 market illusions and employment of nothing but Mexican illegals in slave
 conditions has made him enough money to buy and sell your life fourteen
 different times (I know, he had my retarded Uncle Frank murdered,) you
 might think guys like /that/ are the ones who have benefitted the most
 from the Internet, but no, it's really chet and erik from
 OLDMANMURRAY.COM.
	I don't propound to know what these jackasses actually do to make
 money, but I imagine it involves looking inside computers and slurring
 out in hick Cleveland accents, "Well, that's yuh problem right thair." Or
 maybe using the Perl programming language, brainchild of Religious Zealot
 and Elder of Zion Larry Wall, to count how many times people have clicked
 the banners on cruising4sex.com, but that doesn't matter. No, what
 matters is that these are the guys who, without the advent of trashy
 computer games to slander every which way, would have been making paper
 airplanes in the office and throwing them at your head while wearing
 googly eyes and Grouch Marx glasses.
	Perhaps they serve a purpose, which is to slander the bullshit of
 game designers, who make some of the most awful and wretched products
 ever introduced into an unregulated market, but how many times can you
 call that raging homosexual John Romero a raging homosexual? According to
 OLDMANMURRAY.COM, erik, and chet, roughly fifteen thousand times a week.
	What I'm saying is, perhaps their services aren't necessarily a bad one, just
 slight overdo... Actually, what the fuck *AM* I saying? These guys suck,
 their website sucks, their website design sucks almost as bad as the HOE
 site design, their writing sucks, their sarcasm sucks, everything about
 them SUCKS.

                          primary target: girl from mars 

 [mogel] This is what GrlFrmARs messaged me earlier
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* i'm really sorry it has to come to this, but I don't
         ever want to see my name in hoe again.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* EVER.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* you know I don't take myself that seriously
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* but i absolutely REFUSE to be somebody's joke.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* hoe #999.  I just found out about it.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* and i'm incredibly pissed off. Those were private.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* it's toward the bottom.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* he didn't have my permission at all.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* ok, i'll take your silence as a "you don't care."
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* if i'm mentioned again in a derogatory fashion, i
         will look into a slander suit.
 [mogel] *grlfrmars* goodbye.

	What can I say about Grlfrmars that hasn't already been said in a
 non-legally threatening context? Well, I can start out with her being a
 rancid piece of bloated shit that makes me want to vomit everything I
 think about her. I can mention that she's a shit box full of shit and
 stinks, at that.
	She ain't no June Carter, that's fer sure. June Carter is the only
 person in the world who I won't slander. What a voice! What a hottie!
 What a husband! What a famous family! God damn, June Carter is the
 goddess that we always wanted but never deserved. It's only too bad our
 society is pathetically patriarchal, or else she would have risen to
 destroy us all in a fiery wave.
	Grlfrmars is the type of bitch that will analytically deconstruct you
 before she'll let you stick in it, and we all know since she's stupid as
 hell the only thing that she's good for is sticking anyway, so why would
 you even want to bother? There are lots of easy, stupid girls without a
 college education like that stank secretarial whore piece of Jersey trash
 Ali, and it's way easier to fuck them, because they've yet to be trained
 in the dialectic, so they aren't going to try and play Socrates, who, by
 the by, sucked off Alcibiades, that fucking worthless conspirator.
	Basically, the etymological origins of her dirty cunt are not
 worth hearing when you can just go find some dumb sluts down at the mall
 and give them $10 for blow jobs in the Mens Bathrooms. Or, even better,
 you can just cruise for gay sex in the Mens Bathroom and find some cock
 hungry fags like Damon Krukowski to give up their welcoming mouths for
 free.
	You don't need to listen to Grlfrmars relation of the need for an
 external lubrication (KY or WET?) to the inevitability of The Leninist
 NEP instituted after the Red Army wins the civil war. You don't need to
 hear this bitch's inept shit.
	You don't. 
	There are thousand fucking whores in the world. 
	Just fuck one of them and avoid this shit entirely.
	It's not worth the heart ache.
	It's not worth the pain.
	It's not worth her tacit acceptance of how WEIRD you are, and
 hearing her refer to your weirdness as being "SILLY" every fifteen
 seconds when there are sluts just as nasty, like crank, who will give it
 up every which way but PUSSIFIED if you ask them.
