        awoken.

        touched by none.  jolted from nothingness to a veritable overload
 of the reasoning facilities.  shocked, dismayed, and irreversibly branded
 with the motivation of curiosity.

        attempting meekly to use the familiar, unconscious, tools of
 expression; systematically being blocked by internal forces.  realizing,
 with horror, that internal forces are the hardest to fight.

        startled by the indeterminateness of a void.  slowly filled with
 contextual hints and wild flickers of ingenuity.  mutated from blocks of
 foreign meaning; vented through a previously unused but still friendly
 mindset; dragged through the practical examinations necessary for
 reality; emerged.

        trying again; trying again; trying again; seeing nothing.  digging
 deep into a hole of despair.  exhausting attempts at permutations which
 seem less and less familiar.  missing the broken unbreakable links
 between former normality.

        stuck.  forced by threat of obscurity to transmute.  left without
 recourse.  unpowered; destituted; bottomed; struck.

        seeing thoughts move.  watching interactions between others.
 seeing no familiar reference.  being relentlessly assailed by the
 reminders of abstruseness.  succumbing to jealousy; despairing;
 panicking; despising.

        tossed by animosity; wrecked by spasms of blind enmity; paralyzed
 by inaction and disability.  dispatched to blackness by a resolute
 unwillingness to change. 


        awoken.

        too wearied to repeat; exploring.  manipulating the primeval
 blocks of the previous context.  discovering vehicles of expression.
 forgetting the mistakes and the hate of the last miserable attempt.
 moving.  empowered by the not-so-unlikely merge of perseverance and
 discontent;  communicating; receiving; responding.  freed.
