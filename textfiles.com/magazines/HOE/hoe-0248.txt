<Gaurd> Don't you have Netscape or something?
<YOUR_FACE> i do, but it's really slow
<YOUR_FACE> ok
<YOUR_FACE> hold on
<YOUR_FACE> i'll go back to the other
<YOUR_FACE> one
<YOUR_FACE> it's not too important to read those descriptions, though, if
you didn't notice
<YOUR_FACE> heh
<YOUR_FACE> it's sort of just filler
<Gaurd> lol
<Gaurd> GOD!
<Gaurd> THAT'S IT!
<Gaurd> OH MY GOD.
<Gaurd> How fucking ironic.
<Gaurd> I was sitting here a couple minutes ago...
<YOUR_FACE> huh?
<Gaurd> Trying to think of a topic I could write on for the dto issue...
<Gaurd> I couldn't quite summarize my thoughts into a cohesive thesis...
<Gaurd> <YOUR_FACE> heh
<Gaurd> <YOUR_FACE> it's sort of just filler
<Gaurd> Then, BOOM.
<YOUR_FACE> hehe
<Gaurd> Your words smashed into me.
<Gaurd> I was flattened like Wile E Coyote, and staring up at stars.
<Gaurd> "it's sort of just filler."
<Gaurd> Amazing... you know?
<Gaurd> When everything just clicks?
<YOUR_FACE> yeahyeah
<Gaurd> I should email this to myself, so I don't forget it.

Well, I looked at this after I got it in the email.  I didn't want
to remove anything from it, because that would take away from the
effect I'm trying to make.  The preceding 32 line irc conversation
could have been summed up in one line "dto is nothing but filler."
But that wouldn't have got the point across, would it?  If you're
actually reading this in an issue of dto (and I pray for the sake
of the zine that you are not) then you've just wasted 15 to 30
seconds of your life.  You'll never get them back.  Fuck, I'll
never get the 2 minutes back it took me to write all this.

Do you realize what I'm saying?  NOTHING!  I'm not fucking saying
anything.  Nothing at all!  The only thing point I've made is that
dto is nothing but filler, and it took me 32 lines to do _that_.
At the moment, I'm expounding upon that theme by simply saying
the same thing over and over.  Every word is predictable.  Every
thought is unorriginal and unimaginative.  You probably know my
every word just before you read it.  You have probably thought
all of this before.  I'm not being intersting, only confrontational.
I'm just filling time, while you wait to get to the end so that
you can feel some sense of accomplishment when you get to the end,
since you just read a multi-page article which had a single purpose:
to fill time so that you could get some sense of satisfaction out
of enduring the pain it takes to get through it.

GOD, this better not get in dto.

Because if it does, I just will just lose all respect for that zine.

Oh.

Wait.

Nevermind.
