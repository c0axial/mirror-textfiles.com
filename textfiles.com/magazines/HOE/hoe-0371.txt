        Okay, so there I was.  "Where were you?"  Hang on.  I'm getting
 there.

        There I was driving my car down Auburn Street.  It was a nice
 day.  It was an absolutely gorgeous day.  I had the windows slightly
 rolled down.  Children were playing.  Birds were singing.  People were
 waving at each other.  (So it was the finger... that does not matter.)
 Anyhow, understand that everything was just perfect.  I was listening to
 my new favorite song on the radio - Karma Police, by Radiohead.  All
 was right with the world.  Can you picture it?  Visuals are somewhat
 important for this piece.

        Then, for some reason I started thinking "You know, something
 just isn't right here.  Something is missing."  Incidentally I thought it
 was a little cold for the month of September but we'll touch on that one
 later.  I looked around me and I couldn't find anything wrong but I knew
 something was up.  Something just didn't feel right.  I looked up only to
 find the small rip in the interior of my car that everyone has but has
 no idea of its origin.  I looked down to the floor of my car only to find
 the hey and dirt that somehow makes its way there.  I stopped to think
 "Where did all that roughage come from?" I let it go though, because
 there was something bigger here.  There was a higher purpose to serve.
 I looked from side to side and there was nothing but the many books and
 socks that have taken up their residence on my passenger seat.

        Now, at this point I am starting to get a little worried.  I
 wondered if maybe I was having one of those psychic moments like you see
 on Unsolved Mysteries.  You know, the ones where people are killed and
 across town some woman eats a hero sandwich and has stomach pains
 knowing that somewhere in the world a man has died.  Yeah, kind of like
 that, except... not really.  I look down once more only to see... and
 this is the kicker... this is what will get you...

        I looked down only to see that my shirt was unbuttoned.  My
 blue, button-down shirt; the one that came from a friends discount at
 the all too trendy "Buckle"; the one I wear almost every two days... was
 completely unbuttoned. !!! That's just not decent. !!!

        Know this.  I am not a tart.  I am not one of those girls who run
 around town in see-through shirts.  I have never left the house in just
 a towel.  I do not wear the color purple.  (Just throwing that one in
 there.)  What gets me about this whole thing is that this is the second
 time something like this has happened to me.  The first time was a
 little worse because I had someone point it out to me at a gas station
 in the form of cat calls and phone numbers.  Granted, that was a little
 better because it was only the top four buttons as opposed to all six.
 You know, I feel kind of bad this time though.  This is getting to be a
 problem.  Here I can program my VCR, calculate trigonometric problems,
 and cure cancer (okay, maybe not) but I cannot even dress myself.  What
 does that say about me?  What does that mean?  What am I going to do?
 I am beginning to wonder if maybe I need to start wearing big sweaters
 with no buttons or perhaps a nice turtleneck would suffice.  Maybe
 someone should call me each morning and say "What are you wearing?" No.
 I don't think that will do at all.

        All this got me thinking about naked people.  (Let's keep it
 clean folks.) It got me thinking about how every time I go to the local
 bike path some woman wearing nothing but a bra and shorts runs past me.
 It got me thinking about how men there jog in their underwear.  Children
 run around half naked.  At first my opinion on all this was solid.  Wear
 clothes.  Stay in school.  Wear clothes to school.  Stay away from
 drugs... all that.  However, I began to think about it and I will tell
 you something.  I am glad to live in a country where people can run
 around half naked.  I am happy to look around me and see people with no
 clothing on.  (Whoa!)  I think it's a good thing when we can recognize
 the human body as something beautiful (or not so beautiful as the case
 may be) and accept it's presence in society.  Now, don't pin me down as
 one of those nudists.  (One of those crazy nudists.)  I simply think
 that maybe we should open our minds a little.  We should relax a little.

        One thing that has always disturbed me a little are those bins of
 underwear that can be found in department stores.  Ladies, men, you all
 know what I am talking about.  I am talking about how every time you are
 in the hat department or the glove department, or maybe you are just
 passing through, you can find a bin full of underwear laying in the
 exact middle of the walkway.  There is always a sign in the bin too.
 It says something to the extent of "Bargain Underwear.  Mix and Match."
 Well, keep your bargain underwear away from me.  I don't want your
 bargain underwear.  The last place I want to see the word bargain is
 with the word underwear.  (Or the word meat -- either one.) I don't like
 the idea of rejected underwear, and that's what it is, you know.  They
 throw all of their rejected underwear into a bin and then... his is what
 is most heinous of the whole thing.  Women come over and they rummage
 through the underwear.  It's like the turkey bin at Logli's the last day
 before Thanksgiving.  (There's a whole story there.) They get these
 crazed looks in their eyes and they delve deep into the bin... looking
 for that one good pair of underwear.  I'm sorry but I don't think I can
 buy underwear that fifteen women have checked out and then rejected.
 First of all, the idea that those women have seen my underwear just
 doesn't do it for me.  Secondly, the idea that they have seen my
 underwear and rejected it; that it wasn't good enough for them... that
 doesn't do much for me either.

        I'm not sure if this thing has a point.  Perhaps it's just
 something to think about.  Look at yourself next time you leave the
 house.  You don't need to look great.  Just make sure you're wearing
 clothing.  It's a plus!  Chicks dig it!  Guys... I'm not sure what the
 deal is there.  Or you know what?  Don't wear clothing at all.  That's
 the beauty of all of this.  Sure, you might be arrested.  Sure, you
 might go to jail.  This is America.  This is our country and if we don't
 want to wear clothing then, by God, we have the sovereignty and we
 should not have to wear clothing.  You tell that to your police.  You
 tell them this crazy girl named Sara Mann told you no, you don't have
 to wear a shirt today.  That's the beauty of this country.  We can show
 our ankles and get away without being shot.  I love this country!  Thank
 you and God bless America.
