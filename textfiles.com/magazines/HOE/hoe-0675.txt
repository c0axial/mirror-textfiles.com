        I was walking by myself when I noticed an elderly woman carrying six
 plastic grocery bags, three in each arthritic hand.  I decided to ask her if
 she needed any help, but she answered my question by calling me a punk-
 teenager, and that she was fine.  It was a bit cliche' to ask, I know, but I
 really just wanted to help.  Had it been a forty year old woman, I wouldn't
 have asked.  Had it been a forty year old woman with arthritis, I would
 have.  Then again, I shouldn't have assumed that her disfigured hands were
 arthritis-ridden, but you know.  I didn't know what made me come off as a
 punk-teenager, either.  Was it my knee-length, black woolen coat, my oddly-
 colored running shoes, or the fact that I have more than one earring in each
 ear?

        When I got home, I chose to watch some television before making
 dinner.  The TV turned onto a commercial for a local restaurant.  The mascot
 was an animated chicken, dancing blissfully around the buffet, telling me
 that kids under 12 eat for free at their restaurant.  Scenes of happy
 parents and children and relatives and friends munching on chicken legs,
 chicken breast, whole chickens, and chicken noodle soup.  The commercial
 that followed the chicken ad was for Shake 'N Bake.  Two pigs in a pig pen
 were discussing how Shake 'N Bake now made a mix for pork chops.  The
 worried pigs made "moo" sounds, trying to throw off the farmers that would
 send them to the slaughterhouse.  I didn't know if I was the only person on
 the planet who thought those two commercials were repulsive, so I asked my
 sister.  She giggled, and said that it's cute seeing animals that talk, like
 in "Babe".  I ended that discussion and made myself a hamburger.  It's not
 like I was going to resort to vegetarianism because of two commercials.

        So there I was, lying in bed, hoping that a V-1 rocket wouldn't run
 out of gas over my house tonight, when-

        No, that's not how it went at all.  I went to sleep that night
 without any worries that dealt with life and/or death.  

        I went to the grocery store a few days later to buy supper.  My
 grandmother refused to pay for anything relating to me until I paid her the
 sixty dollars I owed on the phone bill.  I picked up a box of Betty Crocker
 Butter 'N Herb mashed potatoes, broccoli, and a box of Kraft Deluxe Macaroni
 & Cheese.  I was living it up tonight; no cheap Kraft Dinner for me.  I also
 picked up a bottle of water.  When the French girl at the cash register ran
 up my stuff, she gave me a rather surprised look when she noticed I was
 paying with my ATM card.  I didn't really know why, there were signs in
 French everywhere that said the ATM purchase limit was five dollars.  The
 character '5' is the same in English and in French.  The total had come to
 $8.74.  She asked me if I wanted to withdraw any extra cash, which I didn't.
 The look she gave me could've killed a small child.  I didn't realize then
 how wrong of me if was to charge my $8.74 purchase with my ATM card when the
 minimum charge was $5.  That was very uncalled for.

        One day soon after the ATM fiasco, I went into a small cafe', got a
 cup of tea, and sat town to read a free local paper.  It was more of an
 old-persons' cafe'.  It wasn't chic or trendy.  The woman who served me wore
 a pink polyster dress and a white apron.  I was thankful her caked-on
 make-up didn't fall off into my tea, for it might've caused a chemical
 erruption.  Two police officers approached me while I sat on the stool and
 drank my tea.  I was somewhat worried as to why, however I wasn't committing
 any crimes that day, so I thought I was safe.  The officer asked me how much
 I'd paid for my cup of tea, which I replied "ninety-nine cents".  One of
 them said I couldn't get much for a buck these days, and I agreed.  The
 other officer cheerfully chimed in that I could make a fifteen minute
 phonecall across Canada for a buck, if I dialed 10-10-321.  The woman who
 worked the cash felt the need to join in, for she could not believe that
 anyone could make a fifteen minute phonecall across Canada for a buck.  The
 officer then explained that with 10-10-321, any call under fifteen minutes
 is just a buck, then ten cents a minute for each additional minute.  We all
 laughed contently, and went our own ways.

        That night I listened as the motor-like sound of the V-1 rockets
 passed over my town.  The noises grew louder, but that was normal as they
 flew over the house.  The buzz would hopefully deteriorate soon.  Sadly for
 us, though, the noise suddenly died, right over my house.
