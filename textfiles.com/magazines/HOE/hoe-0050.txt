        This particular Issue of HOE is disturbing.  More than usual.  You
see, I sent out (some more than others) nagging letters to all the HOE
writers asking them to produce an auto-biography of any size, shape, or
style.  The following is what I got back... raw and unedited (cause I'm lazy,
not for any actual "mood of the writer effect"...just cause I'm lazy and can
use this excuse... Oops).  Anyhow, this doesn't include every HOE writer and
this certainly isn't the solid 100% truth from any one of us.  It's all Zany
Hi-Jinx.  Watch out!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-[ Mad Arab ]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     
     Ack, I'm finally writing this AutoBio for HoE, yeah I know,
I'm a damn lazy fuck 'eh?  Lemme see, I was born and raised on a
farm, that's why I leave the door open all the time Mom!  ;>  I was
always interested in computers, even before I received my "speedy"
386sx/20 for X-MaS.  Back then I was just happy to fuck around in
windows, just opening and closing them, moving things.  Hell, I
didn't even have to run a prog to have fun.  But time led me on a
path away from Mr. Gate$.  I got the # for this small PD bbs from
a friend at school and I was on my way running at a whopping 2400
baud!
     Slowly, but surely, I made my way up the BBS ladder, and I was
soon the /<-RaD WaReZ d0od3 wanna be.  I remember how pissed I was
when a friend got chosen to be a courier over me, those were the
DaZ ;>  Seeing as I only had an 84 meg HD, the WaReZ /<0oLN3ss
didn't last long and I was calling message boards where I found my
love.  Messages and info, which is what I still look for from a
BBS.  I'm a posting manic ;>  Soon I found my way into the H/P
scene from the main stream "wannabe's" to the underground doers. 
Which is where I still spend most of my online time, on the nice
homely H/P boards.
     Well, one day, I met a friend with 3 fucking tapes full of
shit, and he had like 30 virii, which I thought was _alot_!  I
grabbed them from him and started testing them on floppies after
disabling my HD in the BIOS.  I soon got my grubby hands on a copy
of Immortal Riot #4 and called _every_ US BBS listed and got on the
2 that were still up, WCiVR and Illogikal Nonsense.  This is where
I acquired my love for virii that I have today.  I continued with
both Virii and Phreaking and became quite knowledgeable in both
areas and began being asked to join groups, which I accepted.  
     I never released a _lot_ of shit through of my past or current
groups, I believe in quality not quantity.

     Back in my days of being a RaD PD dude, I was in love with the
idea of being on the other side of the keyboard so to speak on
BBS'es and run one of my own.  As soon as I got my own fon line I
threw up my BBS, Symphony oF Sickness, which it's still called to 
this day.  The board has been through _many_ changes, I started out
as a Sound/Programming BBS and then slid into HPA, and then virii. 
My mind doesn't like to stay in the same place for very long and my
board follows my wandering mind,
     Welp, I know this A-Bio is rather dry, but alas, I was never
one to talk about myself, I'm a very modest person, so with that,
this is the short and quick compu-life of the Arab ;> January 30.

   The Legend:
[Lance Boyl......LB]
[Mother Logik....ML]
[Jessica..........J]
[Devon............D]


         "Today we have uncovered the answer to one of the most
          sought after questions in the universe. Who is Logik?"

        Doo doo doo doooo do,
                doo doo doo doooo do, 
                        doo doo doo doooo do do di do dop
                                                    JOIN US!!

LB: Welcome to National Geographic's "Who is Logik". I am your host Lance 
    Boyl. For years people have admired the work of the great writer and
    philosopher Logik. All over the world professors and other theologians
    have studied his work and have loved it. However, there has always been
    a great mystery about him. That mystery is, who is he? Not once has he
    ever given a television interview or even had his picture published. Is
    Logik his real name? I feel that we all doubt that seriously. Well,
    today I have come to ease the world's mind. I, yes I, have discovered
    vital information about the hidden genius. With us today we have several
    people who are close to him, and after some subtle persuasion, they have
    agreed to tell us their story. First, we have his mother.
LB: Mother Logik, tell us about your son.
ML: Well, it all started one day. I had just gotten back from grocery
    shopping and I walked into the house to find his father naked as the day
    he was born. Obviously I was very pleased (we hadn't had sex in...)
LB: Please, spare us the details Mother Logik.
ML: Oh, I suppose you're right.
LB: Yes....
ML: Anyhow, after some of what I like to call "Stuffing the Chicken" we
    realized that his father wasn't wearing a condom. So, nine months later
    little Logik was born. 
LB: So, Logik was a mistake? 
ML: Well, I don't like to say that. Let's just say he was..... uhm....
    unexpected.
LB: Okay, I guess we can say that. Anyhow, what did you think of your son?
ML: He was always a quiet boy. He kept to himself a lot. He never seemed to
    want to talk to other people. I remember one time he walked around the
    house for about three days chanting, "I am the cheese, I am the cheese",
    like I said, he was a strange boy. 
LB: Yeah,  he sounds like it. 
ML: Don't get me wrong, I loved him. Its just that every once in a while he'd
    scare me.
LB: Why is that? 
ML: Have you ever seen a picture of him?
LB: No, no one has. 
ML: Well, then you can't understand.
LB: Why? What is so hideous about him that he scared you? Did he have a third
    eye that he got from some nuclear accident? Was he missing part of his
    face? Tell us, the world wants to know!! 
ML: He, well, uhm, he...
LB: SAY IT DAMN IT!! 
ML: He was a punk rocker!! 
LB: Oh my god, I'm so sorry Mother. 
ML: Yes I know, and he had this weird love for polyester and Cheese Whiz.
LB: So, did you try to whip him into shape?
ML: I tried for a while, but he was just too wild
LB: When did he leave home? 
ML: Well, I'm not sure he did. See, one day he came home from school and told
    me he was going to become a hermit. Then he went up to his room and that
    was the last I saw of him. 
LB: Is that when he began his adventures into Cyberspace?
ML: I supposed. I never really asked him. I saw on the news how you can get
    those pornographic images over computers. I think that's why he was
    always in his room. But, I never wanted to say anything. What he does
    with his hands is his own business.
LB: I'm sure all men are willing to agree with that.
ML: In any case I never saw him after that. Though, every once in a while I
    would get a Email message from him at work.
LB: Did they have any vital information?
ML: No, they just told me off how he was having an affair with Stuart.
LB: You mean he was gay?
ML: No, Stuart is our dog
LB: Oh...
ML: Is there anything else you would like to know?
LB: Do you know where he is now?
ML: Well, Like I said, I think he is in his room. But you never know.
LB: Okay, thank you.
ML: You're welcome. 

LB: Now let's move on to his girlfriend, Jessica.
 J: Hello Lance. How are you?
LB: I'm just fine <grin>. Now, how long have you been seeing Logik?
 J: About three months.
LB: Really? So, what do you think about him.
 J: I think he's strange.
LB: Anything else?
 J: Not really.
LB: Okay, now lets' move on to a close friend of his Devon

LB: Hello Devon
 D: Hello Lance.
LB: So, tell us about Logik.
 D: Well, much like Jessica I think he is very strange.
LB: Hmm.... interesting. Why do you think that?
 D: He just is. Anyone that thinks "Saturday Night Fever" is a movie classic
    can't be normal.
LB: True.... so why do you think the world loves his work so much?
 D: I guess because it is true to itself. At times it is totally wacky, and
    at other times totally serious. Besides, if you ever see him in person
    he has a really nice butt.
LB: Thank you for telling us that. I know we were all wondering.
 D: No problem.
LB: Is there anything else?
 D: Uhmm...... nope. Well, gotta go anyway. I'm going to help Jessica kill
    her sister.
LB: Why is that?
 D: If you ever meet Logik, ask him.
LB: Well, nice meeting you <g>.

LB: Where does this leave us? Better yet, where is the infamous Logik? The
    world may never know. The only clues to his existence is in his writing
    and the accounts of the people we have just talked to.

(Pause....)

LB: So, formulate your theories. Create your misconceptions, or truths. For
    the world may never know who Logik really is. Then again, the world may
    never know if I have a penis. Still, this is just one more of the great
    mysteries of "Nation Geographic"

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-[ Black Francis ]=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


   Francis is suffering from major writers bloc brought on by the ever-so-
high expectations of Mogel and his own k-rad writing group, ReD.  So he
asked me to help him out.  Being the nice guy I am, I couldn't resist.  
   To know this loveable little asshole is an honor, not to mention, he has 
his own car so I get rides all over the place and everything.  Anyway, he's
pretty much your average 17 year-old with cranberry hair, piercings, and 
tattoos.  But even though he looks like he's tough, he's not.  When he was 
a kid, he was scared by those things on Sesame Street that go "Yep yep yep"
over and over again and have those big huge bottom lips.  His pride and joy
is a shirt that has a black dude with an afro on it that says "Soul Brother"
in funky 70's bubble letters.  It looks really cool under a black light.  He
is also the proud owner of many "disco inferno" t-shirts.  While pounding away
on the keys, and trying to keep his sanity while running his BBS, Sub-Culture,
he listens to the likes of his favorite bands Pavement, Pixies, Frank Black,
Velocity Girl, Catherine, Jane's Addiction, Primus, Tilt, Ween, and They Might
Be Giants, which he saw in concert with the best looking girl in the school.
   His proudest achievement was when he won the Asshole of the Year award on
some lame local board where the SysOp is a necrophiliac, but that's another
story.  Black Francis currently resides in Horsham, Pennsylvania and owes me
twenty bucks.

        Well m0g3L told me to write this, so I suppose since I want
        to stay affiliated with HOE I feel somewhat obligated. Shucks.
        I am originally from the LA area in California, but am now
        living in a shitty town called OakHurst. It snows here and
        the fucking deer eat your marijuana plants.
        I am 35 years old, a virgin, and still live at home with my
        mommy. I go to church every other day, worship god-all-mighty,
        and have a band-aid holding my real thick glasses together.
        My height is 5'5, and I weigh around 530 lbs. I never take
        a shower or wash my hair and I eat spam all day.  My only
        girlfriend I ever had died. I got kind of excited and while
        using her blow-up tube I accidentally bit and popped her.
        My average day consists of sitting in front of the computer
        letting the color drain from my face. I enjoy sitting around
        and watching the paint peel off the walls. I like fucking
        small barnyard animals and kidnapping and molesting little
        boys. My hobbies include going to the zoo, flashing my neihbors,
        and praising Jesus.

        Ok back to reality. . . Im 16 years old, dont molest little
        boys and dont go to church everyday ( I do like to fuck barn-
        animals tho ). Ive written about 200 PHiLeZ PHoR H03 BuT m0G3l
        SaiD THeY WeRN'T ]<RaD ENouGH PHoR H03, aND aCkTuaLLy uSed aBouT
        TW0. Im around 6'0....145 lbs...DONT wear glasses with tape,
        and never , well, just once, used an inflatable girl.
        Well, I dont want to talk about my computer because that is
        all boring shit and im sure you all can live without the
        knowlege of how much ram I have or how big my drives are. . .

        Here is the part of get to know me and the personal shit I know
        that you all are so eagerly anticipating with sweating, lusting
        anxiety.

        normal people you have ever known.

My Life
-------

Hi.  My name is zorro, and I used to have a life.
I was born overseas, so I dont think I can be
president.  That sucks.  I have been around the
world, but I was too young to remember more than
the cool food I had there.  When I came here,
life went downhill.  By last year I had no money.
I was madly in love with 10 girls in my school,
and on my last day, I asked them out.  What
really sucks is that they all said no.  I did
meet a cool girl, but she started putting me 
down, and being mean to her friends, and I
hated that.  I moved away to a place where there
were no cool computer people, and everyone
smokes pot.  Even the teachers.  I kinda
didnt like that at first, but after a while I
found that they dont know when homework is
due or anything.  I like girls a lot.  Next
week I am dropping out of high school to take
classes at the local college.
I think that Aggressive women are cool,
unless they used to be or are guys.  That's
not my type.  I like things that are strange.
A while back my best friends sister helped me
paint my nails black. I though that was cool.
I think that life is slightly over-rated, and
that people should let others do their own 
thing.  I wish the world was such that you
could be honest with everyone.  Nine Inch Nails
hits the spot with me.  If I listen to that
I am energized.  Let me leave you with
a feeling of what last summer was like:
Your body lays limp against a hammock, every
movement of your arm is stressful.  You dont
want to sleep, because the air tastes good in
your body, and you want to enjoy it.  You
dont need to adjust your eyes... the sun isnt 
too bright, and its not facing you.  There is a
cold lemonade, just out of the way of the
swinging hammock, but close enough to be easily
lifted up.  Nothing is digging into you, the 
hammock is supportive, not restraining.  The sky
is blue, and your brain is collecting as much
as it can.  You are safe.
and... a phrase from the new song I am putting
out:
'Dont class me with those other freaks,
        Dont try to get too close,
 My body will surround you,
        You'll get a fatal dose'
             [The End]

  was to be about me! And thats why i am writing it. NO I'M NOT A LIAR.
  I'M NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT!!! YOU DID IN THE FIRST PLACE. Yes you
  did. YOU called ME a fed. No I didn't. Fuck you. Fine, Fine Be that way
  see if i care. Hey! Come back here! Turn that monitor on! AHHH! Come back!
 
   No I'm not a warez dude. No I'm not! Don't tell me you read my files. You
  lie. If you read my files you would know i'm too /<-/~aD to be a warez
  d00d. I AM ELITE DAMN IT! Stop arguing with me.  Look... I am sick of you.
  SICK OF YOU! You heard me. YES YOU DID! DON'T DENy IT!

                  The First and Only Bio of Chal e. Mac

Of course I'm writing my own bio, what'd ya think, Bruce Sterling was gonna
get around to it some day?

Anyway, Mogel ordered all us Hoe guys to do it. Which brings up an
interesting point, namely, how come there aren't any Hoe girls? This is the
'90s and all, seems like we should have a girl on staff. Anyway, if that
seems important to you, drop Mogel a line and ask for an explanation. As for
me I'm going to write my bio in the form of that bastion of American culture,
the Playboy centerfold, as a protest :) Too bad it's not a Mosaic page or
I'd include some lovely little .gifs of myself. Hey, that's not a bad idea! If
we ever hit the big-o-la-time we'll have to get ourselves a home page and
include little pics of all the Hoe guys, or at least the better looking
ones :) Anyway, on with the bio:

                            Zipper Catches Skin:
                   
                 The Life and Times of the Mighty Corrosion

                                      written by the master scribe, cRAnK


        Corrosion, has employed me, cRAnK to write his biography for Mogel's
lame group, HoE.  He didn't feel it was becoming of him to waste his time
with such a frivolous act, so he bequeathed the aforementioned honor upon my
very being.  I am duly enlightened.
        As a youth, Corrosion would often get his "skin" caught in the
figurative zipper.  This would cause many days of pain and uncomfortable
bruising, not to mention the unfortunate pissing of blood.  Usually, however,
he would remember to unzip his pants before pissing.  This is good.
        In Corrosion's formative days, he was misguided and drawn towards
devil rock.  Favorite bands are the obscure, those no one else had heard of,
let alone cared about.  An early favorite was Twisted Sister.  Oh yeah, baby.
Nowadays, Corrosion wallows in 80's thrash and still thinks it's cool.  His
music collection consists of more than 400 tapes and CDs, most of which are
Englebert Humperdink's Polka Favorites.  To this day, he assumes no one knows
about his secret obsession with clog dancing.  Such the fool.
        As for Corrosion's wardrobe, almost 100% of his upper-body adornment
consists of "cool" thrash t-shirts.  His lower-body attire is made up 
exclusively of 16 year old brunettes willing to jump at his every whim.  The
girls, however, *MUST* be wearing short skirts and twenty-hole Docs.
        Speaking of girls, Corrosion's sex life comes into play.  Foreplay, 
if you will (wouldja?).  On the average, when it's not sex with cRAnK, his
preferred choice of partners are inflatable sheep dolls (model #16-341A...
check 'em out!) and posters of Cindy Crawford, his obsession.  Reclining back
in his roomy double bed with things "well in hand" is one of his favorite
free-time activities.  Of course, when there is a young lady present, it 
makes the experience all the more invigorating.
        A typical Corrosion day begins at daybreak.  It's straight to the
showers for our sweaty hero.  After the first cold splash destroys what's 
left of his morning wood, he heads to the closet to pick clothes suitable
for work.  It is particularly difficult to weed through the thrash shirts
when you're trying desperately just to stay on your feet.  Quoth Corrosion,
"Ughhh....mornings suck."  Once the proper attire has been recognized and
tossed over his head, and the slippery under-age Brunette has been 
disentangled from his knees (she made it past the cold water blast in the 
shower stage), our jerk, er, hero, is ready to continue.
        Next, Corrosion moves back to his toiletries to continue scrubbing 
up.  The pearly white teeth are given their twice-daily brushing and biweekly
flossing, and are ready to join in and create Corrosion's winning smile. 
After that comes the sacred brushing of the hair.  His hair is long, reaches
down his back, it is a beautiful shade of hazelnut brown and as soft as 
rabbit's fur.  One hundred strokes, no less, and he departs the bathroom with
a flip of his hair away from his sacred face.
        The last step in the ritual is breakfast.  Only after a nourishing
meal can he even think to begin his day.  This meal often consists of such
delicacies as Pepsi and tuna, or chocolate bars and steak.  Always concerned
for his health, Corrosion is a model of good nutrition and a balance of
vitamins in his system at all times.
        Finally, he is ready to leave for work.  He grabs his keys and hops
into his *BLUE!!!* car.  Driving to work doesn't take too long, and he sighs
happily when he arrives, because today will be a good day.  Every day at this
office is a good day.
        Plugging in his stereo and popping in one of his favorite tapes,
Corrosion is geared and ready for work.  At 8:40, he receives his first call.
It is cRAnK.  They chat for a minute or two but then Corrosion actually has
something to do.  She resigns to calling his 800 number back a little while
later.
        From 9:30 until 11:30 they talk about nothing in particular, and
then, with a sigh, cRAnK realizes she has been coerced into writing his 
biography for HoE for him.  Of course, as mentioned previously, I have been
"employed" to write it, and I will be paid later tonight.  How I will be
paid, however, is between the two of us.

                       written by cRAnK and only cRAnK
                         with love to her followers.
                    The author wishes to thank Corrosion,
                          "just for being there".

        Well, now it's time for the Biography you were REALLY looking
forward to.  Who really cares about those *OTHER* writers??  It's all m0g
that matter now, baby!  Well, I guess I'll defy the obvious trend of these
biographies and ACTUALLY tell you about me for somewhat real.  Wh0a!

        Born as a goddam yuppie-spawned nitwit I had a hard, hard mentally
and emotionally disturbed life.  You see, I had this weird quirk of mine in
school...it was called "doing what I wanted to do and ignoring teachers",
well, needless to say this got me into lots of trouble.  oOOdles of scarring.
Anyway, to make a short story even shorter, I went to a small public
school and had a lot of fun.  Oh, along the way up I ran into a guy named
Charlie that introduced me into BBSing.

        At first I was only into the Door Games and the pirated files.  It
was obsessively pathetic, but at the time it did make me happy.  As much as
this past shames me, it do take pride in never using the word "warez" as
others used.  There was also a pEEdEE board I was a permanent on that I also
called, which got me into liking the message bases and posting.  The stuff
that SHOULD be crucial to a board.  At any rate, I decided to put up a board.
The name thing bothered me a lot, as I really didn't want to grace the title
of the board with some dippy name...so I decided to do something safe and
name it after me.  Why not?  King Blotto did it!@!!  Anyway, there was
eLyTeNeZZ on my board for a while, but fortuitously the light came upon me
and I made the board all text file.  I picked up every good zine I found.

        Then the day came where (after a LARGE and spicy beef burrito) I
realized my calling in life.  "Mogel..." said the voices "...you can leave
the patheticness of your area code and travel into another level.  Write
text files!!" and so HOE was born.  I realized that the only way I could
make my voice heard was to control everyone completely.  You see, if the
world is going to the shitters...then I want to HOG [see a key word or
phrase coming in here?  Relavant?  NAH!) up as much and take advantage of
as much as possible.  And *STILL* be a nice guy.  It can be done and I will
prove it.  I got vision, I got soul.. I got style out of control!  My most
recent joys are getting to write for Cult of the Dead Cow [The Zine
Grand Mastah'z] and bringing HOE recently back to a more definitive slant.
Oh, and just for the record: I'm not a Skinhead just because "I let two of
them in" (Abigwar and Defiant).  guh.

        Oh.. here's some data for the pHaN KLuB:

   Real First Name: Mike
   
   Handle Origin: Welp, actually, as much as it surprises some people my
                  handle means not very much.  It's not for 'power moguls'
                  and I don't like to Ski.  It's a name my sister called me
                  when she couldn't talk so well.  Goofy and kept.
   
   Age: I'm 18.  My life is in chaos.  Yippie!
   
   Religion: A sort of mix between Buddhism and Atheism.  My immediate
             family is all Buddhist.
   
   Nationality: I know this sort of stuff doesn't really matter, but this
                is part of me so I'm tellin' ya anyhow.  I'm a white guy.
                Amazing, huh?  I have heritage from many countries all over
                Europe.  I'm basically everything from the Continent.
   
   Top Women I adore: Winona Ryder, Nykia, Tori Amos, Lisa
   
   Aspirations: Planning to be a film director at some far future time.
                I want to go to h0h0 Con '95 and talk to Swamp Rat, Drunkfux,
                and Gibe.  These guys are amazing.

   Words to the Wise:

   "Live Free.  Live Fun.  Run out right now and go do something COOL.
   Don't sit around your modem forever.  GET ON WITH YOUR FUCKING LIFE!"
