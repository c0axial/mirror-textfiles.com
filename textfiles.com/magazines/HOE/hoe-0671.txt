        on may 21st, my computer decided to write a short story while i was
 waiting for it to boot back up. since none of you have had the pleasure to
 meet my dear computer, i'm assuming i will have to interpret it's work.


        "ScanDisk has found a lost cluster.

	-> cluster was no doubt different. some would even say crazy.
	   because of his unstable state of mind, cluster was rejected
	   everywhere he went. pitying the poor loon, mommy and daddy
	   cluster decided that this would be the last time he would be
	   subjected to rejection. within a few days after the execution of
	   the their believed fool-proof plan, cluster became more and more
	   suicidal. he figured out that mommy cluster and daddy cluster
	   did not "just leave to get sister cluster", but instead left him
	   to get depressed and kill himself. so there he was, just
	   floating around aimlessly in anjee's hard drive, which later
	   resulted in cluster getting lost.

	   Mr ScanDisk was taking a walk one bright sunny day and stumbled
	   upon our lost cluster friend who was hungry and wearing rags.
	   cluster was sitting under c:\cdpro\ and did not want to be
	   bothered. he was trying to bore himself to death, but MrScanDisk
	   ruined his suicide attempt. in a fit of rage, cluster bolted
	   over and started punching the piss out of him. Of course this
	   upset Mr ScanDisk, but he refused to react because of his kind
	   and caring nature. also, based on the fact that he knew no
	   cluster would normally wander around alone, he guessed that
	   something bad might've happened to cluster.


        This cluster was probably a directory at one time.

	-> lets travel back in time. cluster started out by being a
	   directory.  he then got kidnapped by the feared BADSECTOR evil
	   scientists who gave him all sorts of potions and tortured him
	   in every single possible way. poor cluster.

	   after what seemed like forever spent with the evil scientists,
	   he was found and returned to his home. the potions affected his
	   brain and he began acting weird and saying silly stuff. later
	   that day they found a total of 4 dead bodies and all pointed
	   the finger at cluster, but no arrests were made. actually, no
	   one but cluster's parents dared to approach him.


        The directory has been recovered."

	-> the nice ScanDisk man took cluster into his home, fed, bathed
	   and clothed him. shortly after, cluster got rid of his shyness
	   and began trusting others, he would talk Mr ScanDisk's ear off
	   about anything he could think of. he even admitted how he 
	   flushed some girl named tasha's hamsters (pissant and baxter)
	   down the toilet.

        *pause*
        :(
        *resume*

	   the nice kind man thought cluster's behavior resembled his from
	   a long time ago when HE was captured by the BADSECTOR evil
	   scientists. he then remembered that he concocted a cure. he
	   immediately ran to his exe and brought it to cluster. trusting
	   Mr ScanDisk, cluster took the claimed "remedy" and was magically
	   poofed back into a directory. nobody ever rejected him anymore,
	   his parents accepted cluster back into their exe and he became
	   lifelong friends with Mr ScanDisk. everybody lived happily
	   ever after. the end.
