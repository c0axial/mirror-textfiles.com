// Hello hoe readers! I, Seaya, have accomplished a most
// amazing feat! I have completed my first C++ program.
// It is a bootlegging program in which you enter the
// number of desired quarts, and the price of certain
// ingredients on the market, and voila it spits out
// the suggested price per quart. Below is the code,
// plus comments from my T.A. as to the stupendousness
// of my first effort and the lacking of proper formatting.
//
// The url of the assignment is:
// http://www.cs.georgetown.edu/~maloof/cosc071/project1.html
//
// Compile and enjoy!!!

#include <iostream.h>
#include <iomanip.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main ( )
{

  double fullRecipes; //#of full recipes needed, apple bushels, sugar bags
  int waterVolume, // gallons of original mash and packages of yeast
      yieldQuarts; // desired yield in quarts
  float yieldGallons, // the desired yield in gallons
        appleCost, // cost of 1 bushel of apples
        cost, // cost of all the jars plus the bribe and ingredients
        sheriffBribe, // pay the sheriff some dough
        jarPrice; // suggestions of what to charge for 100% profit

cout << "Enter desired number of full quarts: "; // request for quarts
cin >> yieldQuarts; // input of quarts of yield

if (yieldQuarts > 128) {
  cout << "\nGallons of mash exceeds volume of still." << endl; //
overflowing!
  getch();
  exit(1); // sends failure message ands exits
}
else {
  cout << "\nEnter cost of apples per bushel: "; // request for bushels
  cin >> appleCost; // input of the cost of an apple bushel
  cout << "\nEnter sheriff payoff: "; // sneaky bribe to sheriff he he he!
  cin >> sheriffBribe; // how much to the sheriff

yieldGallons = yieldQuarts/4; // 4 quarts in a gallon
fullRecipes = ceil(yieldGallons/3.2); // each recipe yields 3.2 gals
waterVolume = fullRecipes*5; // 5 gallons in 1 recipe
cost = sheriffBribe + (yieldQuarts * 2.75) + (fullRecipes * 2.75) +
(appleCost * fullRecipes);

// the cost of the entire batch of moonshine =
// the number of quarts yielded times the price of a jar
// plus the number of full recipes made times the prices of the
// ingredients in one recipe (assuming water is free)
// plus the pesky bribe to the sheriff

jarPrice = (cost/yieldQuarts) * 2;

// The price of one jar is
// the total cost divided by the number of quarts yielded
// then multiplied by 2 for a 100% profit

cout << "\nNeeded ingredients:\n";
cout << "  " << waterVolume << " gallons of water,\n"; // initial gallons
h2o
cout << "  " << fullRecipes << " bushels of apples,\n"; // how many
bushels
cout << "  " << fullRecipes << " bags of sugar,\n"; // # bags of
sugar=bushels
cout << "  " << waterVolume << " packages of yeast.\n\n"; // pkgs
yeast=gal. h2o
cout << "Yield: " << yieldQuarts << " quarts\n"; // yield in quarts
cout << "Suggested Quart Price: $" << setprecision(2) // set for cents
     << setiosflags(ios:: fixed | ios::showpoint) // necessary for dollar
format
     << jarPrice << endl; // what to charge per jar

}// end of else
getch();
return (0);  // sends success

}// end of main

/*      Good job, Leah. Try to work on formatting your program a little
more clearly,
        it makes it much more readable and easier to follow. Your comments
in the
   program are excellent. 5/5
     -Seth */
