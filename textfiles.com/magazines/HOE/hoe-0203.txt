 yes i want to sleep sleep sleep chirp like a bird this makes so much sense
 right now and last night was not just a dream it really happened in
 perfection it was good and like we just went and flowed naturally and
 everything everything was there and nothing was not and so so good and
 you're thinking something that isn't true because of my vague wording and i
 am misleading you almost purposefully because i am too tired to write
 evrything out and now i guess it was two nights ago because it's now monday
 and advancing quickly quickly and saturday is the past a mere emory that i
 will remember indefinitely i hope sitting in the park after dark way way
 after dark when it's cold and we're not ready for the cold and just sitting
 sitting sitting in the park after dark and the light is buzzing and annoying
 and then poof it goes out and all is well and my arm is around her and she
 cuddles to me and not a word is spoken because it is not needed we both know
 and it's almost sad when you're young precisely because you don't know what
 you think you do know and what the hell i am 17 years old and i will be 18
 in april but what will that change not a damn thing i bet i will be older
 and wiser they say and i can buy cigarettes lottery tickets and porn but oh
 well what the fuck like i couldn't buy them now 21 is the age to be because
 then oh then i will be where i want to be is now forever will it last more
 than just a fleeting moment and why the fuck didn't i take off my work
 clothes when i came home because now i'm wondering and oh well i stopped
 wearing a tie to work and i just wear the sweatshirt and no one is the wiser
 elite elite what a treat life is good we talked for two hours tonight and
 that was after random work encounters there is something really there i know
 i know i should've said what i really wanted to tonight that i wanted to
 reach through the phone and hug her we've been through so much it seems but
 you know what this is nothing this is shit we don't know hardship from the
 back of our hand we're rich white people who've had advantage rain down upon
 us all our life but our problems seem so big don't they don't they we know
 that we'll be alive tomorrow and some people don't they fucking don't and
 should we even care shit i am tired and i haven't done this for awhile and i
 don't know why why why but it makes so much sense
