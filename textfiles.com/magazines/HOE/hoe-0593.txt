        Mongels always's bitching at me to write something for HOE.  So
 today I have.  I think that you'll be hard pressed to find a more solidly
 written piece of 20th century prose.

        Usually, I don't have anything to say on matters that don't, in
 some way, relate to Star Wars, professional wrestling, or Magic: The
 Gathering.  I call these things the Holy Trinity of my life, in ways quite
 similar to the "Holy Trinity" that Catholics claim to worship in their
 churches and synagogues around our fair country.  That is, I see these
 things as one entire entity instead of three separate incarnations.  I am
 monotheistic in my praise for the unholy Lucas-created, McMahon-maintained,
 Wizards of the Coast behemoth that I have constructed into my mind.  Quite
 frankly, these are the only things I give a fuck about, and I don't have
 time in my life for much else.

        I have just lied to you, and what a clever lie it was, indeed!
 There is a forth thing that I care about, and that isn't counting basic,
 every day needs such as toiletries and fast food, for I don't count them as
 things you really care about.  You just need them.  No, this forth thing is
 something entirely unrelated to my Holy Trinity (explained above, stupid!)
 and life's basic necessities.  Have you discovered my secret?  No, of
 course not, you foolish little imp!  The brainpower required to be able to
 decipher my code above would be greater than that of R2-D5, mightiest and
 most cunning of the R2 starmech droid series!  The pleasure I am obtaining
 from this writing is quite rich, but I will spare you any more suspense.

        Soft-core pornography.  That is correct.  Soft-core porno is my
 secret indulgence.  Scratch that last part, because I guess it is a secret
 no longer.  How I yearn so often when sitting in class or locked in a
 heated confrontation between my trample deck and my friend Howie's
 counterspell deck (with that blasted Leviathan that he somehow manages to
 get to work, and I've never seen ANYONE else able to use a Leviathan
 effectively) or when perhaps I'm leafing through the back issues of Dark
 Horse comic books (I know Timothy Bradstreet personally!) I will suddenly
 be overcome with an urge to run home and partake in a viewing of some
 simple, cock-less soft-core action.  It is both uncomfortable and, at the
 same time, wildly exhilarating to know of my hot, hot little addiction.

        I must stress something here that I have mentioned briefly above.
 The word "cock-less" is essential in my explanation to you, although I
 hardly believe that I must justify my beliefs to any-one else.  I simply
 don't like looking at the male genitalia.  Certainly, the anus, exposed,
 open vagina, and other in depth viewing spots of hard-core pornography are
 things I can do without, but it is the cock that I miss the least of all of
 these things.  I will try to set up an analogy so that you may understand.
 To see a cock in a porno is a strong turn off to me, much the same way that
 to see Han Solo, perfect archetype of reckless, unshaven rebellion, not
 blast that little bastard Gweedo first is a strong downer.  That strong,
 thick member on screen is roughly equivalent to the little son of a bitch
 getting off that first shot before meeting his final and justifiable fate.

        I also can do without the money shot, for when watching such
 pornography, I have little trouble in providing my own "money" shot, if you
 get my drift.
