        How original is this...

        Nothing is original anymore.

        here we go, movies, music, TV, life...
        stolen images
        stolen words 
        stolen people

        Now it's understandable there is a limit to the places people can
 go.  I can deal with that, I hope you can too...

        Finite reality from point A to point B.  But one path.

        Life / Death

        no original ideas there.
        Nothing is original anymore.

        time goes on, what came before effects after. 
        Optimists, Pescimists, taoists, nowists, whatever they call
 themselves.  originality is but a word lost.  Lost forever, in a fast
 food, fast fun, fast action, no thought world.

        there, out the window, wearing his TH and his colored cap.
        there, hailing a cab, wearing her black leather and fur.
        there, on their cell phones... selling peoples souls.
        there, in big plastic and neon, a logo everyone knows as a name.

        click.

        The Presidents defense team pointing a finger.... 

        click.

        Jim Carrey makes silly faces and potty jokes.... 

        click.

        Mannequin 2.... 

        click.

        Infomercial.... 

        click.

        another sucker born

        This.....Not so original.
