        A few weeks ago I was having a conversation with a friend of mine
 whose opinions I usually hold with a lot of regard.  I was completely
 aghast when he started talking about how strip clubs were degrading to
 women and ought to be shut down.  Then I started thinking about how just
 about everyone I know who has a somewhat liberal frame of thinking
 agrees with just that.  There are even bands in the hardcore community
 that seem to convey the message that women in pornography and such
 things are complete victims being abused by a patriarchal society.  I
 think that this idea is extremely flawed and dangerous.  It just
 reinforces the idea that women are helpless.

        By buying into that line of thinking, you are completely ignoring
 a woman's right to express and make a living in any way she sees fit.
 You wouldn't want a blind person to drive frieght trucks, but you would
 want someone who had a clear head and was free from any kind of
 emotional problems to operate on you.  Women who are physically
 attractive or considered to be appealing in a sexual way who want to
 strip or prostitute themselves are no different.  Job skills.  The
 arguement is that men who see women stripping and patron prostitutes
 are only viewing them in a sexual manner is completely pointless.  I
 seriously doubt that people who say that are interested in the
 personality or the life history of the person who is waiting your table
 or pumping your gas.  They are there to serve you and nothing else.

        The anachronistic notion that a woman has to maintain her
 virginity and remain "clean" dates back to a time when women were
 considered as nothing but property.  No matter what, their ideas and
 intellect were completely ignored and they had no material possesions to
 give to a man.  She only had her virginity.  While there still is a lot
 of sexism and inequality going on, women are treated better here and now
 than they have been in any Judaic or Islamic society.  So the idea that
 a women has only her sex to give is obsolete.

        The idea that sexuality is inherently wrong is the single largest
 opressor of women.  The first recorded civilization, the Sumerians, not
 only gave women complete sexual freedom as did men, but worshipped them
 as goddesses.  Women were the givers of life.  They were allowed to
 transact in the market place and own property just as men did.  In fact
 it was because of this that civilizations first alphabet and scriptures
 were devised by a group of women who were more or less the government of
 the province called the Naditu.  Sex was not understood to impregnate
 women, it was not considered to defile either the male or female.  It
 was just another recreational activity.  It was not until the isrealite
 cult of judaism gained power and destroyed the greatest city in the
 world at the time, Babylon, that their ideals of shame were inflicted on
 the masses.  The male dominated tribe's main scriptures dealing with
 creation ended with a woman tempting a man into comitting sin and
 displeasing the male god.  Her punishment was the pain of child birth.

        Doh.

        Throughout their scriptures women are a great temptation and
 should be avoided.  Since women tend to be less physically strong than
 men they were quickly subdued and made into property that meant little
 more to men than cows or chickens.  Since the sexual urge is the
 strongest natural biological reflex, they knew that if sexuality could
 be controlled than you can control every facet of someone's life.  So
 extensive sexual laws were put into place.  Their blood was upon them,
 you know the speil.

        Today if you will look at modern nations.  The contrast that
 existed between Sumerian-Babylonian (their cultures were very similar,
 they both worshipped the same goddess, "Ishtar") and the Isreali
 cultures is still in place.  Denmark, where anyone regardless of age
 can purchase a Hustler Magazine and get into a strip club has strict
 laws to prevent discrimination of women.  The rates of domestic
 violence, rape and other such crimes is among the lowest in the
 industrialized world.  Fundamentalist cultures such as that of Libya and
 Lebanon have no pornography at all.  They also are the most opressive
 nations in the world to women, I'm sure you know that in these countries
 women are not allowed to own anything, to drive a car or even in most
 cases to show their faces to a man the is not their husband.  A similar
 situation exists in Singapore, where the neo-fascist People's Action
 Party (who reminds me a great deal of the _Orwellian_ Party) places all
 kinds of restrictions on literature and media to produce a "clean"
 image.  Penthouse is banned and so is Red Book.  Nudity on any image
 that is not that of a classical form of art such as Michaelangelo's
 _David_ is generally banned.  Singapore has a huge problem with rape
 and other crimes against women.

        Any research you do on the correlation between pornography and
 violence will always point you in one direction: PORN DOES NOT ENCOURAGE
 VIOLENCE.  If anything it quells the desire to commit various sexual
 acts that are not acceptable by most people such as pedophilia,
 beastiality and rape.  Kiddie porn is readily available in Denmark,
 child molestation is pretty non-existant.  In the United States, where
 it is extremely illegal, we'll hopefully you get my point by now.

        I'm sure you've heard televangelists speak of how the AIDS virus
 is the wrath of God.  If you were to analyze the situation you'd find
 out this:

        _CHRISTIANITY_ IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF AIDS.

        Neo-Puratanism, Victorianism and these type of attitudes that
 were held by most of the officials in the U.S. Governement at the
 time... and _they_ are responsible for the widespread of the virus.  At
 the time, heterosexuals tended not to get the new "Gay Cancer".  It was
 pretty much segregated into certain populations such as Hatian
 prostitutes and patrons of gay brothels in larger U.S. cities such as
 New York and San Francisco.  If these populations were quarantined and
 research was done on them to find out the origins of the disease, then
 it would not be killing millions every year.  It shouldn't have been
 difficult, look at how much they knew about Patient Zero and everyone
 that he had sexual relations with.  Of course, that didn't happen
 because politicians were more interested in maintaining the favor of the
 puritans who vote for them, and doing anything at all to associate
 themselves with sexual deviants like prostitutes and homosexuals would
 damage their career.  In the later part of the 1980's, when more
 research was conducted and it was determined that blah blah blah -- 
 _that_ should have been the end to illegal prostitution.  Government
 does regulate damn near every industry.  Regulating prostitution to
 where they had to use condoms similar to the way that doctors have to
 wear gloves would cut down on new AIDS cases significantly.  Of course
 that's contrary to the nature of the people of this country and
 probably will never happen.  It's just an idea.

        i'm sure you've noticed a recurring theme here: PURITANICAL IDEAS
 ARE THE BASIS FOR SEXISM, THEY ARE OBSOLETE.  ANYONE WHO EMBRACES THEM
 IS UNABLE TO BREAK THE CONDITIONING THEY HAVE RECIEVED FROM SOCIEY.  IF
 PURITANISM WAS OBSOLETE LIKE IT SHOULD BE, THEN ELLEN DEGENERES WOULD NO
 LONGER HAVE A CAREER.  NOW _THAT_ WOULD TRULY BE A BETTER TOMORROW.
