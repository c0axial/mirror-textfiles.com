        Sometimes, when I am sitting all alone, I can feel it.  I can feel
 the urge to write a sappy memoir piece.  Just kidding.  My real urge, and
 my prior comment brings me to this, is to kill my litery arts teacher.
 He is a worse then a buffoon, worse then a dunce in every way
 imagineable:  he actually thinks he comprehends what he daily "teaches"!

        And with such beura.. ah but no one cares about my fucking
 professor.  This almost turned into a rant.  Why I'm really here, is to
 tell you to buy condoms.  The big kind.  You see, when you've got a
 horse of a cock like I do, you really do need some huge rubbers to fit
 the bill.  And here at NybarTech Condoms, Inc. [TM], we make sure that
 "one size fits all!"  Here's our latest moment.  (at this point Nybar
 withdraws a gaping 16 foot expanse of rubber, looking not unlike a
 stripped-down kiddy swimming pool, from his pants.  Not his pants
 pocket.)

        "Ya see, here at Nybar-can'trememberthename-condoms, we have
 commitment.  Not just to makin' sure ol' man semen don't get through ta
 ol' lady vagina, but to the FAMILY!" (at this juncture, a gawky,
 redcheeked lad steps into our readin'-vision. He gives the thumbs up)

  Lad: "That's right unky nybaR!"

  Nybar "AWwwwwww..." nybar affectionatly places the condom over the
  boy's head, it falls over his whole body.

  Lad "Gwklahh! What's this liquid!"

  Nybar "Whoops!"

 (then Lion-o, the boy, Nybar, and the rest of the Thundercats heartily
 laugh.)

        Nybars grinning face appears as the logo, which the words
 "Nybar's Condom Challenge:  Are YOU Man Enough?" underneath.
