        One thing about the human condition that I have always been
 particularly struck by, is its enormous potential for being much like a
 coin -- easily reconginizable by each side for what they are worth, but
 two-sided none-the-less.

        Salesmen.  (also known as sales people for those of us in
 Generation X, the haven of political correctness... doesn't this second
 name just make salesmen even more like a coin then the rest of us?)

        Anyway, salesmen.

        Ever work with any?  I work with computer salesmen.

        Salesmen are the epotiomy of the human condition.  In their real,
 everyday, personal lives, most salesmen are extraordinarily giving of
 themselves and of their earnings.  They are there for their loved ones
 in all possible ways -- to give a hug, or to pay the rent.  But then,
 come 9 am, they transform into something different.  A vicious animal
 which stalks "customers", examining their every move; gobbling their
 every word; scrutinizing their every gesture in order to determine how
 to play on mankind's desire to trust; how to walk hand in hand with the
 "customers" ego -- making them feel knowledgable about keyboards, and in
 need of a Intel Pentium II 450 XEON, a purchase which would allow them
 to take their already existing knowledge, and AMAZING ability to learn,
 and become a GENIUS.

        Despite these two separate identities housed in one carnal body,
 each personality reveals the same thing about the "person" they comprise.

        What does it mean to give of oneself to another?  If you "get what
 you give", according the the golden rule we all have had drilled into our
 fragile heads, doesn't it mean that a "selfless" giving of oneself is
 accompanied by a subconscious desire to receive the same in return?  In
 essence, we do things for other's, and secretly put a check next to that
 person's name in the little scorebook in our heads while whispering to
 ourself "(insert name of victim here) Owes me now :)"

        As for the identity that exposes itself between the hours of 9 am
 to 5 pm, with its deep comprehension of a person's weak points -- this
 personality cares not for the individual on which they focus their
 attention.  No, this identity cares only of the money to be made by
 another's ignorance (which, essentially, is what all jobs, including
 specialized labor, rely on).  Money which can be spent on another, and
 returned in a form of a favor that "money can't buy".

        One thing about the human condition that I am particularly struck
 by, is its enormous potential for being much like a coin -- easily
 recognizable by each of its sides for being worth JACK SHIT.
