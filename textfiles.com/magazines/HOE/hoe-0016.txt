        Hello, d00dz.  This is my first in the line of many parody articles 
that I will be doing for H03.  You see, my entire life has been centered 
toward this very moment, where I will write a text file that will fully 
explain the technique of creating and running a T0T41 FUCKIN' 4N4RKEY 
GR0UP (Note: The 'FUCKIN' was added purly for dramatic affect!)
        At this very moment there are ka-zillions of text file groups that 
are floating around... some will prevail, but most will be miserably 
forgotten in the deathlands of the lame....next to Madonna's youth.  
Actually, to have a kewl An-ar-cust group you don't have to worry about the
hustle-and-bustle about producing texts.  Let me explain...  
        First let me get one thing totally clear!  The point of having a kewl 
aNaRkUsT group is to get famous.  There's no other reason behind it... 
although there's the illusion of getting RAD fileZ, the point of it all is 
to get Distro sites all around the country.  And the more important thing is
to get repect in your area c0d3 f0r being Nati0nal.  Everyone will think you
4r3 r3411y ElYT3 and kiss your ass.  But the first thing to do is to get 
writers.  If you run a BBS, this is an easy task, you just do a massmail
to every user on the board explaining that they must write for your AnAkuzt
group or they will be deleted.  If you don't run a BBS, you can still use 
this method, just find a really RaD board with /<0deZ.  Then send the SysOp 
money only if he will e-mail all the users, and tell them that to write for 
your aNaRkuTZ group or he will delete them.  Another method to get writers 
is my favorite.  You pick out 3 or 4 userZ that are really RaD and you 
private e-mail them on every board they call every single time you call up.  
Now you have writers.
        The next thing you need is a name.  The name is the most important
part.  Don't pick any LAMER names that have words like "Vaginal" or "Cow" or
"Entropy".  You need to have your group say what oyu are about!!!1! If you
want your group to be RaD, you *MUST* have the wordZ "AnArKuzt", "Phreak",
"Hacker", "Fuck", and/or "Anarkutz." I have some suggested kewl nameZ:
        UnhG = Underground Narc Hating GuyZ
        PooP = Phreakerz Operating on PhoneZ
         TfA = Total FUCKING AnArK3Y
         TpM = Total phucking moronZ
         KUP = Killer Underground PhreakerZ 
       PHART = Phreakerz, HackerZ, and AnarkustZ Really Ticked-off.
        Making "ArtuKulz" is a little tricky.  Remember, if you want to be 
kewl them you gotta look rad.  I suggest you get professional help.  First 
you should contact an ascii artist.  Tell them you want really kewl GRAPHIX 
for a header.  Since anyone that would actually bare the title "ascii 
artist" obviously has no life, they will be happy to get it done right away.  
The next part is the tricky part.  You need to make articles that will 
interest people.  Here's the part that many groups run into a snag with: 
everything you learned about AnARKkie iZ from other people and you don't have 
anything original to say!  Most LAmeRZ give up thier group there... but, 
never fear, as I love my Entropy childern, I have the most ELITE solution to 
the problem.  You know those miscellanious fileZ that are in peopleZ file 
bases about H/P/J....(oh, shit sorry.. I meant H/P/A.. my mistake!)?  Well, 
we all know that NOBODY readz those fileZ!!  I mean, why the frig would 
someone write something that is not affiled wiff a GROUP!?!  All you need to
do is download something that sounds really rad.... like "C4RDiNG iN TH3 PUSH
0F TW0 K3Y STR0KZ!" and then just add your RAD new H34D3R and add your name
to the bottom with a copyright and a warning.  Actually the file might 
already have a warning on it for you while will make your 0UTPUt RaD!
        The next part to making your board ELYT3 is to name a Home Base 
board.  Then you need DiSTR0 SiT3Z!!  You get these by calling LD BBSs that 
you get the numbers of.  Make sure that the board you are calling has LOTS 
AND LOTS of WaReZ on it.  The reason for this is that WaReZ SysOps will
not give you a hard time by looking at your text fileZ and will take 
virtually anything to get another affiliation to attach on thier boardZ 
StatZ so he can be just as ELITE aZ y0u.  Plus, those sysops for H/P/A boards
are all snobs anyway.  
        Now you got the writerZ, you got the Distr0Z, is there anything else
that I forgot?  Wait, let's do a test to see how ELITE you think you are.
Go on and guess what you think our  RaD group needZ STI11*:

        [ Fill in your guess here:  ________________________________
          __________________________________________________________ ]


        No, not "tips on Masterbation" you LAMER!!!  It needZ it'Z own NET!!
All the ELITE groupZ have thier own NETZ.  That way you have control over
all the boardZ by BL4CK-L1STiN' 411 L4M3RZ!!!!  TH4T'Z R4D!!  
        Well, that concludeZ my guide to making your own ANERKUZT Group!  
Coming soon iZ my most ELITE file EVER.. "How to Hack ALL Bank Computerz!"

        * = Note: i stole the "fill in the ELITE Blank" joke from Tequila
                  Willie in CDC #71.  Great 'ZiN3!  R3411Y 31Y+3!!!1!!

        Now it's time for the GRE33TZZZzzZZZZzZzZZzzzZZzz section.  This is
        the part where I grEEEeTTzz lots of people, and maybe 1/100th of
        them you have heard of.  I wanted to do GREeeEEYiieEETTttZZzZz for 
        everyone that I knew, so they are a little long.  I hope you don't 
        mind.
