	Your eyes were scary for a minute there. (ooooh) I saw them
 darken. My eyes saw your eyes darken, and then my eyes blinked, and your
 eyes were normal again. Nice, normal, empty.

	Emptiness is secure and safe. Keep your eyes like that. Then I can
 despise you easily, safely, securely.  It makes sense, you know?

	I know! Let's make the nonsensical sensical, shall we? That'd be a
 trip, man. Let's differentiate each other, because we are different,
 after all. We're all different. I'll find the derivative of "u" and
 you'll integrate "m" + "e" and then take the derivative of that and then…
 you'll be left with just me. Oh.

	Never mind. 

	The funny thing is that I'm not writing this with anyone
 particular in mind… I'm just writing "you" and pretending there is a
 "you," but no, it's all a big, fat, juicy lie. There is no you. You are
 not.

	I am. Really, I am.

	Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite. Oh, I feel such Terror when I think
 about you. Oh oh oh. Ho ho ho. I think this holiday is a good time to
 celebrate your commercial beauty, don't you?

	Lovely Santa Claus loves me.  And you.  You and me.

		You and me and the apple tree;
		You and me, so passionately.
		You and me and the bourgouisie. 
		Me and you and Kalamazoo!
		You and me and one bent knee, 
		Me and you and through and through and 
		oh, if I only loved you.

 	-- I'm going to make you scream I'm going to make you scream I'm
 going to make you listen to Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holliday I'm going
 to say "gonna" because it's so charming it's so charming it's so I'm
 gonna make you scream for me.-- Too bad there is no "you." Too bad!

	This is so disjointed. But I never learned the words to that song,
 so you can't blame me. The thigh bones connected to the hip bone, I know
 that, but that's all I know. One thing only I know, and that is that the
 thigh bones connected to the hip bone.  Damn. I had this dream the other
 day… want to hear about it, Mr. Scary Eyes? Sure you do. I dreamt about
 saying something like "I know I'm ignorant!" to Bridget's dad, the
 philosopher, and that I regretted it immediately afterwards, because he
 likes Socrates and then he thought something like, "Socrates only became
 sure of his ignorance after years and years of study, but today's youth
 just accepts it without a single second thought. They read about Socrates
 and say, 'Wow, that makes sense. I am ignorant.' And then they go back
 and buy more things with dear Santa Claus smiling down on them."

	So, I read Bridget's dad's thoughts. Interesting dream, eh?

	I'm no good at calculus - maybe I should have mentioned that
 earlier. Maybe I should have checked your eyes first before I started
 talking math because after all, math is the binding of the universe! Like
 toilet paper! But it dissolves! And what are we left with? Just words.
 Hahaha!

	Damn.  This was a waste of time.
