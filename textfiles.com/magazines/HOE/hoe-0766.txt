        OH MY GOD, I'm so fucking horny.

        I just want you to know, I'm stroking my cock.  I type relatively
 well with one hand.  Hopefully I can show somebody this impressive skill
 one day.

        Does that make you feel uncomfortable?

        I can't help it, really.  I'm all lubed up right now, and completely
 ready to shoot my load.  I have my designated masturbation sock in position
 and everything (I put a little red tomato sauce stain on it so I can
 identify it).  Sometimes girls ask me if it's blood.  They're so silly,
 isn't it?

        It took me a long time to get into the mood today, though.  I'm so
 disgusted by these tame fucking internet perverts.  Sometimes I just want
 to see a small child ramming his erect shaft into the end of an
 unsuspecting farm animal.  I know it sounds like I'm being gratuitous, but
 I'm really not.  It's just curiosity, you know.  I like to know what
 stuff like that looks like.  Is that really all that weird?

        Sometimes I look at my penis, with its huge bulging veins and the
 slightly-too-purple head, and I start to wonder what it's like to have a
 much larger penis.  Like one of those super penises, that extend into the
 air like a flagpole.  Wouldn't it be great to walk into a room with one of
 those?  Wouldn't all the girls love me then?  Still, my penis is okay.
 Really.  It's not too bad.  It gets the job done.  That's all you really
 need, right?

        YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW ABSOLUTELY HORNY I AM.

        Maybe I should pull out some internet pornography and temporarily
 sate this raging beast (that's my penis), because I am not sure I can
 properly function until I do.  Do you think I'm being too personal here?

        Like Woody Allen, I can't stop thinking about sex.  Everything
 reminds me of it.  When I go to the Opera and think about what the opera
 singers moans would be like if I fucked them.  When I see gymnastics I
 wonder what kind of crazy sexual positions those women could go into.
 When I eat kelp I... uh....

        Celebrity porn is for pussies.
