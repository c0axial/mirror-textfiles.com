               >> "Translating for The Army in Deutschland" <<

        This is based on some of what happened on 4/22/98 on Broadway.

        "Excuse me, how exactly do you translate that written on your bag?"
 asks the matured man as he catches up to me.
        "Oh, you mean the German?" I reply, still walking.
        "Yes," he says, "I am having trouble translating the phrase...'no
 makes more for you?'"
        "heh, that's good;  very few people ask me about it.  Actually, macht
 also means 'power' i think, not just 'makes'" I say.
        To this, he replies at once "Ah yes, it's important to learn the
 idiomatic meanings of the language which develops with a culture in order to
 translate correctly."
        "Yup," say I.
        He then proceeds to tell me "I was stationed in Germany close to
 1955, I used to translate for the Army.  Back then, everyone here thought
 the war was over, but it was still being fought there!"  I smile and
 chuckle.  "So, what does the whole phrase mean?"  He asks.
        "The phrase,"  I told him, "as I understand, means 'no more power for
 you!'"  He laughs.
        "I like that" he says, and then asks "So, what about you? Were you
 stationed in Germany, or did you just pick it up somewhere?" referring to
 the phrase.
        "I just picked it up along the way," I tell him, not bothering to
 explain that it comes from a kmfdm song.  Walking all the while, he turns to
 go on his way into a building.  I tell him "Well, nice talking to you, have
 a nice day!"
        He answers, "Thanks, you, too!" as he walks away into the nameless
 building.
