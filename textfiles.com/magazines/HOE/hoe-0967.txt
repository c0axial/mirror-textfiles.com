	Have you ever been thinking about nothing, just nothing.  Picture
 yourself walking across lets say the Quad of a college campus.  You are
 taking everything in around, the wind in the trees, the smell of fall,
 and all the other things around.  There is no on but you on the Quad.  A
 mystery to you since it is such a perfect day.  As you cross the middle
 of the, you get a thought.

	Not just one of those cheap and cheesy thoughts that you always
 think, but a real good thought.  Something so good that you stop, sit
 down and begin to write it down in your notebook.  Then, as suddenly as
 the thought hits you, your pen dies. You think to yourself, "Fucking
 figures, piece of shit."  Just as you get one of those few profound
 thoughts that scream "write me down dammit!!"

	You get back to your room and try to find a pen with no avail.  
 All you can come up with is a green marker, silver pen, and another dead
 pen.  "what the fuck, its only the fourth week of school, I know I
 haven't written that much! Go fuckin' figure"

	That thought you ask, well.  Do you ever wonder that you may be in
 the middle of being given great advice or receiving a huge sign from god
 or something of that nature?  The thing is you don't realize that you are
 receiving this greatness, and you pass it off as the winds whipping
 across the Quad that you heard about on the weather forecast earlier that
 morning.

	I know you are thinking, fuck, I know that feeling, but I never
 thought of it like that.  Me, I think it was some mystery voice giving me
 a sight to get a new pen for moments like these.  That way the next time
 you have a profound thought, you can actually write it down and savor it.  
 And also so you stop, sit down, begin to write and then get back up real
 quick like an ass because your stupid pen died.

	Go Figure.
