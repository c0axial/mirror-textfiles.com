        You see, when you work at a gas station, there is a vast area of
 stupid fucks you have to put up with.  For example, if one more fucking
 person tells me that the damn car wash didn't clean there car I am
 going to have to decapitate them and put there head in a bag with the
 head of my pathetic, annoying, and dumbass coworker, Matt.  The
 customers car being clean is like the least of my worries in the
 wintertime because, let me tell you, the excitement of my day consists
 of being able to call Mercantile Bank and find out the temperature
 every hour on the hour!  But, I normally do it like every five minutes,
 just to get away from looking at the faces of the stupid people and
 making Matt actually do his job because if you stand at the registers
 with him, he's bound to wander away and have a cigarette just as often
 as I call the bank.  Now I can't let Matt have any enjoyment now can I?
	
         Back to the stupid customers.  Okay, there is this one guy who
 is like fifty or something and coincidentally "visits" every time I am
 working.  He tells my co-workers he will pay them off if they let them
 take me out.  But one day, I looked at the asshole and said, very
 slowly so he would understand, "Okay, jack-off.  I have a job to do
 here and I can't get it done with you here because the only thing on my
 mind is if I want to punch you in your face or call the cops with a
 sexual harassment charge?"  I don't think he liked that too much
 because he walked away and hasn't been in since.  Yeah, I probably
 could have gotten fired over that and all that good stuff, but fuck
 that! Those who know me, know better than to fuck with me and I just
 informed another useless soul to back off.  I feel he learned his
 lesson and that was so my point!

        Then this other guy comes in like once a week with his kids, one
 who is like 12, a girl, and a 18 or 19 year old guy.  He asks me how
 school is and every single fucking time he asks, "So you still with
 that guy?"  The only way he knows is because my boyfriend was in there
 one day and must've noticed who he was.  He keeps saying, "Well my boy
 is looking for someone.  Do you think you'd drop your boyfriend for
 him?"  Now whos damn business is it what I do in my personal life?
 What a dick!
