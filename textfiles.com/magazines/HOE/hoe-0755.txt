        "people always say 'it's only a game'
         but, when you are playing, it's more than a game." - Gumby[DTO]

        while exploring the inner reaches of my mind, i came across an
 enigma whose answer was beyond me.  i spent days trying to figure it
 out, but to no avail.

        yes, i think you know what i'm talking about.

        flashback -- childhood christmas.  you, being the greedy and
 impatient bastard that you are, pulled the biggest box from beneath
 the tree out as your first present.  as you started ripping the paper
 off, your dad started muttering something about those damn japs
 (sorry japs@!), while your mother smiled and wondered if it would get in
 the way of your homework.  your penis grew large (excuse me girls@!) when
 you tore open the wrapping paper, revealing the red colored words
 'NINTENDO'.  within that box contained the greatest mystery of the
 20th century.

        remember the games that came standard with the system?  'super
 mario brothers' and the mysterious 'duck-hunt'.  'duck-hunt' required the
 use of a plastic gun that you later lost while chucking it at your
 brother's head.  this gun, this AWESOME (in power) gun, contained a
 mystery that has dumbfounded everyone i know.

        HOW DID THE GUN / NINTENDO DETECT WHEN YOU SHOT THE DUCKS?
        (dum duh dum dum dummmmmm)

        _ my hypothesis _

        those crazy japs have decided to take revenge on america.  instead
 of perfecting the perfect bomb, they perfected a dimension-link.  the 
 nintendo is a link between our dimension (the third) and the second. japs
 have kept this discovery secret by making the link look similar to a
 video game.  they have made serfs out of the inhabitants of the second
 dimension and allowed mindless american kids to control them while the
 japs take over the dimension.  this secret must be exposed ; i am about
 to do so.

        now that you're pissing in your pants from all the excitement, i'm
 going to get to the bottom of this mystery.  i am going to place a phone
 call to 1-800-255-3700 and ask nintendo themselves.  be aware that they
 might try to throw us off their two dimensional trail by feeding us
 disinformation.  I WILL EXPOSE THE JAPS.

        ring.  ring.

        lady : thank you for calling the nintendo consumer department hotline.
               for improvement, we will be recording your phone-call.  press
               one for any questions on nintendo hardware, press two for..

          me : 1

         him : hello, thanks for calling.  this is tim.  how may i help you
               tonight?

          me : y0.  remember the game duck-hunt?

         him : yeah, i love that game.

          me : i was curious how the gun worked.  you know, how would it
               shoot the ducks? i'm pretty sure i figured it out ; i'm
               calling to find out if i'm right (i then went over my theories
               with the guy).  he was silent ; he knew i had found him
               out.

         him : hold on.

        during this pause, i became worried that nintendo had traced my call
 and were sending over japanese ninjas to 'silence' me.  

         him : sorry for waiting.

          me : no problem.

         him : in duck-hunt, the targets on the screen emitted a blast of
               light when you pulled the trigger, which your gun would pick
               up if it was correctly aligned.

          me : you just don't want me to know about the second dimension.
               you're feeding me misinformation to take me off track.
               YOU BASTARD, JAP-LOVING, PEARL HARBOR...

         him : sorry sir, i just work here. <click>

        HE TRIED TO PLAY STUPID TO KNOCK ME OFF THE TRACK!  I will have
 my revenge.  In the next installment of this series, I will travel to
 the second dimension.  I WILL SAVE MARIO AND GANG.  Someone has to do
 it.  SLAVERY IS WRONG.
