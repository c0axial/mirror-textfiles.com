	I am standing outside the library on another cold winter day. It's
 really stupid of me to be out here, because I don't have my coat, but I
 have an addiction to cigarettes and am exiled to the frost.

	I flick my lighter and by the light from the fire I am able to
 read the lettering on my cigarette as I roll it through my fingers,
 preparing it for the short journey to my mouth. Marlboro.

	Because of the lack of people near me, I think back to when I was
 younger. I know I used to invent stories when there was no one around,
 but it seems like I've forgotten now, like my mind is broken.

	It all comes back slowly, though. Riding my bike home, nobody
 playing outside, no cars. Some nuclear war probably wiped everyone away.
 And then I pedal faster, certain that some survivor is chasing me, wild
 with rage. Finally, I make it home and relish in the peace it brings.

	The garage door opens, my parents come home and my fragile fantasy
 is once again drawn back to reality.

	I finish my cigarette, take one final drag, and wonder if what's
 coming out of my mouth is just smoke or my breath. I watch the cigarette
 glow for a second as it melts a hole in the snow.
