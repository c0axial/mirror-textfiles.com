        I got a job.  Actually, it is my second job.  So I have two jobs.
 I work in a library now, which makes absolutely no sense because I am
 loud and help not at all.  So I got this job, actually I sold my soul to
 the government.  THAT was the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life.
 So this job pays for tuition for school.  So it's not so bad, but it
 really is.

        I have to work with these people, these anal retentive
 christian-ite, library people.  No fun!!!!!!!!!  Now I will describe
 them for you:

        Arena:  My Boss
        ===============

        This woman is THE most anal woman I have EVER met in my ENTIRE
 life!  The first couple days that I worked here, she made a list of
 things to know.  Which is ok, if a normal person had written this list.
 She included on it, the stapler, the waste baskets, the 3-hole puncher,
 the scissors for Christs sake!!!!!!  Everything has a place and
 everything must be in it's place.  ARGH!  If anyone is reading this and
 they know me, they'd know why this drives me up the fucking wall!!@$!#!
 Anyways, so I told her I wouldn't be around Thanksgiving weekend.  So
 the next day I look on the schedule and she had taken me off for the
 whole week!  She figured if I couldn't work the weekend, I may as well
 not work the week days!  What is that?!  Anyone with an explanation,
 please, let me know.

        David:  Adjunct
        ===============

        Ok, this guy is the most anal man I have ever met.  He only
 works once a week, so I don't see him all that much.  But when I do,
 everything must be done just so, right at this very second.  And if he
 doesn't think I can do something the right way, he'll snatch it from me
 and do it himself.  He's a worrier.  When he comes in he has his little
 mini-cooler and his briefcase.  The cooler is held absolutely upright.
 He then puts the cooler under the desk, placed exactly, I mean EXACTLY
 up against the side of the desk.  The briefcase must be directly under
 the drawer of the desk.  If is gets moved he kinda freaks out and puts
 it back.

        I know this is really mean, but it's really funny to watch him
 freak, so I move his breifcase on purpose.  It's fun.

        Actually, there aren't really any other anal people I work with.
 Just anti-social.  REALLY anti-social.  Which is ok with me.

        Anal people are fun.
