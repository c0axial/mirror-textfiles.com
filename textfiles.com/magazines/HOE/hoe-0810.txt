	ok, you've all seen ghostbusters right?

	ok.

	the question in my mind is how the fucking proton packs and the
 trap worked.  to my understanding the proton packs were partical
 accelerators and that is how they got the ghosts.  hrmm.  i don't
 understand this at all.  are the ghosts made up of particles or somthing?
 i didn't think so, i thought they were just 'ghosts'.  what do the proton
 packs do to the ghosts ?  how do 'partical accelerators' put a bean around
 a ghost and hold him in place?  wouldn't it just blow the ghost up?
 i don't understand at all.  

	and how about  the trap?  what did it do?  it just sucked the
 ghost in.  how??!?!? and if it sucks the ghosts partciles in, why didn't it
 get them and suck the busters in?  and... why couldn't they look at the
 trap, i mmean, egon looked at it in the first moive and nothing happened
 to him but the other times, they couldn't look at the trap.  man, i am
 fucking confused!!! i just don't get it!!! ahhhH! help ME!
