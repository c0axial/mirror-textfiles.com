        Christ, don't make such a big deal about it.  You make it seem like
 I killed a newborn child or something.  All I am guilty of is following my
 basic instinct and this is the treatment you give me.  I don't understand
 it, really.  I thought I knew you, I thought you knew me.  It's not as
 though it were a big deal, really.  I did it because I wanted to.  I wasn't
 forced, paid, or held at gunpoint.  I did it on my own will.  And now you
 think I'm some freak of nature who belongs in an asylum?  Hmmm.  Someone
 must have fucked up during your upbringing for that kind of behaviour.

        Don't even bother trying to defend yourself on this one.  You know
 you're a shit, I know you're a shit.  Excuse me, no, not THE shit, A shit.
 There's a difference.  Anyway, I'm still at a loss to where this side of
 you came from.  I thought you would totally understand, but you obviously
 don't.  I don't even know why I'm bothering, seeing as you're not even
 listening!  You're just babbling on, and you're not making any sense!
 Oh, terrific.  Listen if you're going to get crazy like that I'm going to
 have to ask you to leave.  Seriously, it's childish, and tiring.  I'd still
 like to know, though, why you think what I did is such a horrible sin.  I
 bet if you'd done it you'd be all 'Yeah it's cool, it's alllll good!'
 Unfortunately you're just too cool for that.  What the hell is this
 reaction?!  I really didn't expect this from you, of all people.  But I
 guess I was wrong.  Oh?  I was wrong?  About what?  Please!  That's just an
 excuse.  For what?  For you to mock and dishearten me.  I don't know why I
 trusted you with this.  I considered you one of my most trustworthy
 friends, and you pull this bullshit on me?  Ah fuck, don't cry.  I'm not in
 the mood for your drama.  Listen to me!  I don't care what you think, or
 what you feel.  You can't treat someone like shit because of this.  It's
 just wrong!  What?  Forgive you?  I can't forgive you for speaking your
 mind.  The bottom line is, I've done it.  I'll do it again.  Take care.
