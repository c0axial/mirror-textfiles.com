        I recently went to see 98 degrees in concert.  I have no idea why,
 but I did.  I mean, I like their music.  They can sing.  They have pretty
 ballads, which I like.  I figured one concert wasn't gonna kill me.  I
 looked around at the concert and laughed.  My friend and I were like the
 only people at the entire concert that didn't have a curfew that night.  Any
 person over 12 was with their parents.  I found myself feeling sorry for my
 mom, b/c when I was about 12 I dragged her to a New Kids concert.  Now I
 know how she must have felt, being surrounded by screaming 12 year-olds.  We
 left early.

        I figured I could keep my awful secret forever, but I can keep it no
 more.  I own a Backstreet Boys CD.  I also have N Sync and 98 degrees, a
 Jordan Knight single, two Ricky Martin CDs and I find myself contemplating
 buying the Britney Spears CD. 

        WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME??  I even watch TRL now!  ughhhh I am
 regressing!

        Is there really anything wrong with these groups though?  They can
 sing.  They can dance.  They entertain.  Why must they be met with constant
 criticism?  Maybe all the critics are just jealous.  This is good music too!

        Oh, and by the way, Ricky is not gay, and Britney's boobs are real.
