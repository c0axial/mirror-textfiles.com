        I am in a roofless temple or a large public forum.  Suddenly we
 are being bombed from underneath us, I see the ground in the distance
 explode and shot up in a narrow stream and everyone starts running, so
 I start running.

        This public place is paved with hard stone or rock ends sharply
 at a deep green river about two meters wide.  The only way across is a
 bridge made of peach and brown colored stones.  Most people seem afraid
 to cross it.  I cross it without hesitation.  The other side is tiny
 square island which is also paved and contains a taller skinny white
 brick building.  A hand full of people are in here standing on a thin
 side walk surrounding it.  I see a girl I know as 'liz'.  I embrace her
 and start to kiss her.  I black out or something and I am transported
 into the future.
 
	I wake up and every where I look is just walls and doors, like a 
 great inescapable super-building and it is full of people.  Liz is gone
 and I have a desire to finding her.  I ask around as I go from room to
 room.  Then I pay one guy some money to let my through a door.  It
 leads to a large public area that seems much brighter and cleaner.

        I then walk up these steps and I come to this first room and
 there are these really old women at vanities all covered in make-up.
 They just stared at me as I walked through the room, and I ask them if
 knew where Liz is and of course they didn't say anything.  So then I go
 into the next room and it also has some women in it but I forgot what
 they looked liked.  Then I open a door that leads to a hall going to my
 left.  The light is really dim.   I see like this glass tank with a
 womens head in it.  It is kind of bloody and has tiny tubes and wires
 running out of the bottom and then it sees me and just starts screaming.
 I run out of there.  When I get to the room with the old women their
 looks make it hard to leave the room.  Then, I go down the steps I went
 before.  I had these writing pens and throw them at this guard person.
 Two of them stick in his body and one in his head.  When the one hits
 his head he falls over dead.  I keep running down the steps and get to
 the bottom.  Someone else gets me and I fall over.  I just lay there
 motionless and they restrain my legs with this metal thing.  Then, some
 old scientist guy comes out and tells them to let me go, and them tosses
 me this enormous green pale brain in a plastic bag.  I take it rub it
 all over my face and admire it.

        Then get up and again start asking people if they know where Liz
 is and one small boy says yes.

	"where is she!?", I say.

        He is silent and everyone looks at him like "what are you doing!".
 Then I feel sorry for him.

        "Nevermind you dont have to tell me.  Thank you for speaking up
 though."

	He walks off with some people.

        Then, a person steps out and becomes my friend or guide and
 starts to lead me around.  He first takes me to this house where this
 lesbian couple lives, a white skinny women and the other is a very large
 black women and they have four children, two are white and skinny girls
 and the other two are older tall and skinny black girls.  The couple's
 faces are very ugly.  The tall skinny one is standing up and the fat
 black one is sitting down on a rock ledge of a very large window.

        I am then taken to a room with words scribbed all over it and
 this is the "room of god" and there is one shy silent girl who lives
 there.  She is wearing a very old dirty blue dress.  I quietly try to
 say something and she is says "what?", and then I quietly whisper "C'EST
 LA VIE?" and she becomes wide eyed and covers her mouth in shock.
