        the other day me and my pals ratzie and tuttie were walking in the
dangerous streets of fucking new york city when we found out that they really
needed a replacement for those "walk/don't walk" light thingies.

        i figured, okay, when it's time to walk, let's have the sign say:

                                walk

        it's alright.  however, why "don't walk"?  i mean, aren't people in
the middle of the street gonna stop walking and get hit by a car?  well,
that's just plain _stupid_!  the light should say:

                             walk faster

        now, after some time, when it's just about to stop flashing, the
light should change to:

                            run muthafucka

        and finally, we would put up a light that says:

                               too late

        well, just a thought.

        did you ever notice how chromatik had the same initials as calvin
klein?!  i mean, that's food for thought!

        "man, there's no thought involved in there.  there's not even food!"

                                                - rattle
