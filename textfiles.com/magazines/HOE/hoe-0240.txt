        It was now the third week of May and the winter air was still biting
 at the toes of Chicagoens everywhere. Doug and I entered Wrigley Field from
 the North exit, hearing echoes of free magnets and beer for sale.

	The Cubs are now 0-10. Worse start in history. Who knows how long
 this could go on for. The thing is, though, we keep coming back no matter
 how bad they are. What's the most common thing to hear from a Cub fans
 mouth? "There's always next season." Damn right there's always next
 season -- another season for us to come and see a team lose because the
 owners know we'll keep coming back no matter how bad the team is.

	After digging a few extra bucks out of my pocket, Doug and I got
 seats a couple rows up from the third base line. As the Cubs took the field
 I sat prepared for the weather with my sweatshirt, hooded sweatshirt, winter
 jacket, hot dog, and a cup of coffee.

        First inning. Crack. There's a hit for the Marlins. Bonilla on
 second. A group of us begin chanting "ORRRRRRRRIE. ORRRRRRRRRIE.
 ORRRRRRRRRRRIE," to the new Cub third baseman, Kevin Orie. Cub fans may
 keep coming back no matter how bad the team is, but that doesn't stop them
 from voicing their opinions. It kind of reminds me of families. You have to
 love everyone in your family, but that doesn't mean you can't pick on them.
 "ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIE. ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIE. ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIE," we continue.

        There's this atmosophere you can only get at Wrigley Field that you
 can't get at these new high-tech ballparks with retractable ceilings and
 astroturf fields. It's more than a game, man. It's an experience. The ivy on
 the wall speaks ages of what the Cubs are about. Ernie Banks, the '84 Cubs,
 Ryne Sandberg when he could actually play, Harry Carrey singing "Take Me to
 the Ball Game" while slurring every possible word.
