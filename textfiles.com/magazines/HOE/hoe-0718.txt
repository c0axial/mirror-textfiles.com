	It has come to my attention that a change is in order, and not
 because I necessarily want it, more so, it's so I won't have to deal with
 the following anymore.

[-----]

 [02:29] > I need to turn off this random chat crap in ICQ I'm sick of people 
           saying "HI I LOOK FOR WOMAN, A/S/L" and "WHAT YOU LIKE? I want 
           chat"

 - I really should just stop trying to be funny, the humor is lost to most 
   people.  Then again, I don't know if anyone could find any humor in that
   other than me, it's an ironic type of humor.

 [02:29] <AIDS> and I broke a glass
 [02:29] <hroses> are you a woman, anilos?
 [02:30] <AIDS> I thought anilos was some guy
 [02:30] > No, I'm a guy
 [02:30] > I don't know if I should feel insulted at that, that's about the 
           third time I've been asked
 [02:30] <hroses> hahahah
 [02:30] > I think I feel mildly degraded, that's not good
 [02:31] <hroses> well, it's because you write like a girl, most likely
 [02:31] <ior> yeah you type like a girl
 [02:31] > How so?
 [02:32] <ior> i dunno
 [02:33] <ior> it just seemed like the right thing to say
 [02:33] <ior> more applicable than 'you throw like a girl' since i have no 
               idea how you throw
 [02:33] <lifelike> they're right, you know
 [02:33] <lifelike> you DO type like a chick.
 
 - I'm still trying to figure out what is the defining factor in coming to
   the conclusion that someone on IRC is man/woman by the way they type.
 
 [02:33] <hroses> this is the best site in the world
 [02:33] <hroses> this guy is totally a stalker who made up this website
 [02:34] > I'm haven't been on irc too long, how can you differentiate
           between a girl typing and a guy typing? I'm curious, I'm not
           trying to be a prick
 [02:34] <hroses> Anilos, you're incredibly naive
 [02:34] > Your right
 
 - I am incredibly naive, and I have no problem admitting that, there is no
   need to point out the obvious, but in this case maybe it was necessary to
   remind me of my ignorance when it comes to IRC.
 
 [02:34] <lifelike> anil: it's just a vibe you give off. your vibe reads 
         "put things in my sloppy slit." there's really no explaining it 
         further than that.
  
 - There's something interesting, text giving off 'Vibes'.  Sounds like a
   half assed way of trying to cover for a ridiculous assumption.
 
 [02:34] <hroses> hashahaha
 [02:34] <ior> ahahaha
 [02:34] > Hhahaha
 [02:35] > Now I just feel bad
 [02:35] <lifelike> i think your nick has something to do with it.
 [02:35] <lifelike> it just looks femme.
 
 - I was misled here, for a second I thought Lifelike was trying to make it
   sound like it made sense to say I type like a girl, by citing a rather
   good reason for that assumption.  Then she/he said that "it just looks
   femme"
 
 [02:35] <hroses> ok
 [02:35] <hroses> your first lesson is that lifelike is always full of shit
 [02:36] > I'll have to change it sometime soon
 [02:36] <lifelike> i'm tellin' it like it is
 [02:36] <hroses> so if she's saying somethiong it's most likely the opposite
 [02:36] <lifelike> now
 [02:36] <lifelike> i looked up "anilos" on www.m-w.com
 [02:36] <lifelike> & i've found some masculine-sounding alternatives that 
                    are close
 [02:36] <lifelike> "enolic"
 [02:36] <ior> do tell
 [02:36] <lifelike> "emolous"
 [02:36] > I was born in the wrong era
 [02:37] <lifelike> "unhallow" is nice, but not as close.
 
 - I may just be insane but people don't call me by my IRC nickname when I'm 
   not in front of the computer so truly, what is the relevance of having a 
   appropriate or "cool" nickname? 

 [02:37] > There's no mystery behind my name, it's pretty easy to guess where 
           it's from. It wasn't given to me by a friend of mine or cooked up 
           in elementary school
 [02:37] > It's merely from a book, a simple book by John Crowley
 [02:37] <lifelike> i think i figured out why it seems femme
 [02:38] > Do tell
 [02:38] <lifelike> anilos is solina backwards, & that's definitely femme.
 [02:38] <lifelike> so
 [02:38] <lifelike> try taking something tough-sounding & reversing it
 [02:38] <lifelike> like um
 [02:38] <lifelike> yughguot
 [02:38] <ior> 'toughguy'
 [02:38] <ior> ahahahahah
 [02:38] <lifelike> but preferably with less consonants

 - Once again I must question the relevance of a new nickname, I don't plan
   on meeting lifelike, and I don't get any phone calls or mail addressed to 
   'Anilos' so unless I give off a strange "anilos vibe" in person the only 
   reason for being called Anilos outside of a computer environment is for 
   identification only.

 [02:38] <ior> lish *5*
 [02:38] <hroses> hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
 [02:38] <hroses> oh my god
 [02:38] > I'll think of something tomorrow, I'm too lazy to glean a new name 
           from another book
 [02:38] <hroses> this is like my dream come true
 [02:38] <ior> @%#(*@$#)(*@$#*@%#MINDMELD@%#(*@%#)(*@$%$^#^@%&
 [02:39] <lifelike> er, ior
 [02:39] <lifelike> that's been happening to me *all day*
 [02:39] <lifelike> i'm apparently in everyone's head at once
 [02:39] <ior> that's just frightening
 [02:39] <lifelike> yeah
 [02:39] <lifelike> happened thrice today with a 35yo guy i know in nyc. 
                    figure THAT out.
 [02:40] <ior> and that's just wrong
 [02:41] <lifelike> so ok, how about suocuar or etrid or 
 [02:41] <lifelike> um
 [02:41] <lifelike> how about AIDS
 [02:41] <lifelike> that's probably taken
 [02:41] <ior> probably
 [02:41] <lifelike> fuck it
 [02:41] <lifelike> maybe it'd just be easier if you become gay, anilos
 
 - I'm not annoyed or angered easily, but this pushed me just a tiny bit.
   For reasons, see below.
 
 [02:42] > No
 [02:42] <ior> too bad
 [02:42] <ior> you are missing out
 [02:43] > Although I'm sure there's a psychiatric drug that would steer me 
           in that direction, I'm not interested
 [02:43] <lifelike> yeah, anilos, you're right. skip that messy faggot stuff 
                    & go right for mtf transie.
 [02:43] > I'm feeling berated here, why am I being derided again?
 [02:43] <lifelike> because you're an idiot?
 [02:43] > Ouch
 
 - So, I didn't do anything.  I ask a simple question and get, a question. 
   Doesn't it go question then answer?  Did I offend lifelike previously?
   Maybe in some past life? This is all rhetoric though as any sort of answer
   is more than likely just drivel.
 
 [02:44] <lifelike> just hypothesizing
 
 - Sugar-coating the insult, by making it look like a hypothesis, which is an
   obvious joke, hypothesis' are educated guesses.  This is not an educated 
   guess, logical, maybe.  But not educated.
 
 [02:44] > Reason enough for some
 [02:44] > But kind of ambigous, but hey, it takes different strokes to move 
           the world
 [02:44] <lifelike> *** janus: is not on IRC (No such nick/channel)
 [02:44] <lifelike> that's a fine nick
 [02:44] <ior> yeah
 [02:44] <ior> be a twofaced asshole
 [02:44] <lifelike> it's a girl name, but you can pull that whole "minor
                    greek god!!@" thing
 [02:45] <lifelike> or gatekeeper or whatever janus actually did
 
 - This is a personal message to lifelike: Whatever I did I'm sorry, although
   there may be no basis for anything you said here, maybe you were just in a
   "bad mood" and felt like being sarcastic and caustic, I apologize for 
   flagrantly offending you, whenever I may have done it, past or present, 
   hell, even future.
 
 [02:45] <ior> janus was a twofaced asshole
 [02:45] <lifelike> ior: *** Anilos is Janus@ppp-26.icehouse.net (Ryan)
 [02:45] <ior> oh
 [02:45] <ior> i hadn't noticed
 [02:45] <lifelike> so i don't think it's too much of a leap to suggest that 
                    as a nick
 [02:45] <ior> but it's true. that's what janus did in greek mythology
 [02:45] > Janus was the god of doorways, not doors as in the front door mind 
           you
 [02:46] > And it's also the name of some corporation, that's where I stole it 
           from
 [02:46] <lifelike> all i know is this cool atari800 game i played where
                    janus was the gatekeeper & would SOMETIMES let you
                    through & SOMETIMES not.
 [02:46] <lifelike> "the twelve tasks of hercules" i think it was called
 [02:46] > and a old rpg called Rifts, they had these guys called the Sunaj 
           (Janus backwards, whoa)
 [02:46] <lifelike> anil: sellout!
 
 - I never claimed to have artistic integrity, but then again, as pointed out
   below, I never even sold out, technically speaking.  If they can win court
   cases on technicalities, I should be able to weasel out of being called a 
   sell-out through one.
 
 [02:46] <ior> the best atari game was pitfall
 [02:46] <ior> without contest
 [02:46] > And there's another place
 [02:46] <lifelike> DUDO
 [02:46] <lifelike> DUOD
 [02:46] <lifelike> i have problems with pitfall
 [02:46] > I did not get paid to take this name, I am not a sell out 
 
 [-----]
	
	A name change is obviously in order, to satisfy alll of those 
 wonderful people out there who believe a nickname is everything and plan on
 visiting me and calling me by that (Sarcasm? Yes.)  So from now on I'll just 
 be referred to as...

 Tryptophan Synthetase A-Protein, for short.

        Actually, I kid, I'm not changing my nickname just to satisfy some
 moronic machination of someone, well, calling it a machination would be
 glorifying it needless to say though, I won't be changing it quite yet.
