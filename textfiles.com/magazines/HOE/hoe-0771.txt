        Hello.  I am well aware that you belong to three different sites,
 but in so many ways your sites are interconnected.  I want to tell you that
 I understand and see the basis for all you accusations against Christians.
 I also want to say that I am one of these Jesus Freaks and that I love God
 more than anything in the world.

        I want you all to know that humans are fallible- just because we have
 been saved by the creator of the universe does not mean that we do not make
 mistakes.  We do, and many of us misrepresent God in our daily walks. I want
 to apologize to you all on behalf of Christians anywhere for anytime you
 might have noticed that we are human- and we are human.

        One of you mentioned in your page that Christians celebrate the
 murder of Jesus.  We do not celebrate the fact that He was killed for our
 sins- we celebrate the fact that He rose to life again on the 3rd day!  The
 resurrection is proof of the fact that our sins were atoned for!  Did you
 know that Jesus spent three days in Hell for you?  He died for every sin
 that you have committed, are committing, and will commit.

        Yes, it is also true that many Christians have horrible pre-Salvation
 stories of thier lives- but please know that Jesus died to cover ALL sins-
 not just lying or cheating.  That is what is so awesome about God- He loves
 us no matter what we do, and no sin is too great that He will not forgive us
 for it.  One of you also said that humans only get one chance to choose, and
 then comes eternity- in a very pessimistic light, I suppose that is true,
 but look at it this way- every move you make, every breath you breath is
 another chance to choose whether you want to love the Creator or not- in a
 life time, how many trillions of chances do you have then?

        God wants us to love Him- He does not want us to go to Hell, but He
 also wants us to choose our own futures.  Everyday I choose to follow Him-
 it is a constant decision.  I did not wake up one morning and say- I am a
 Christian now- I say that every day.  Everything I do is for Him, and
 everything that He gave me I have given back to Him.  My choice to believe
 and honor is not based on emotion, blind faith, or anything else- it is
 based on fact.  The FACT that Jesus loves me- the FACT that He died for my
 sins- the FACT that I am His beloved child.

        I want you to know that I love you all and that Jesus loves you all.
 Just know that your actions are not loved.  I want you to also know that I
 will be praying for all of you so that one day soon you might be able to see
 the light of the One who created you in your own lives.

        Love in Christ and Praying for you all,
        Jessica, Child of God and Co-heir with Christ
