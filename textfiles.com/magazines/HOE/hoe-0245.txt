	on june 6th, 1997, homeless albert knibschuk was keeping himself warm
by laying on a steamgrate on bainbridge street in center city, philadelphia,
when a piano fell from a 7th story window and shattered both of his legs.
much to everyone's surprise, homeless albert knibschuk unwittingly proved
that what you don't know can, infact, hurt you.
