        I don't know why, but uniforms do it for me.  Doesn't matter what
 the uniform is marine, police, post office, as long as the guy in it is
 decent and over 21.

        January 17, 1999.  I went to Chicago this fateful Sunday afternoon.
 I went with my friend Scott, who's gay.  That is important for you to
 know.  So I know this Marine that lives in Chicago and he told me to call
 him the next time that I was in the city.  So I did.  Little did he know
 that he was about to go on the gayest adventure of his life.  We met him
 at a gay club called Circuit, there was a drag show that night and all the
 little (and not so little) drag queens came out to play.  The marine was a
 captain, so I'll call him captain since he can get in trouble for doing
 this.  The queens loved him.  They were disappointed when they found out
 he was straight.  But, they had their way with him anyways.  The captain
 is big, buff, bald and just REALLY good looking, so of course I had to have
 my way with him too ;)  So, later on that night we went to the Manhole,
 which is a really sleazy bar.

        I hated it and I think the captain did, too.  They have these
 monitors on the walls in this place playing really graphic gay porn.  That
 grossed me out and well, I didn't get hit on much there, but that's to be
 expected. But it turns out that the captain did have fun that night, but
 the bad thing is that he never called me ever again, so maybe he didn't
 have that much fun.  I think the queens scared him away from me.  So I
 learned a lesson.  Never take a first date to a gay club on drag night.
 No wait, never take any love interest to anything gay.  period.

        March 29, 1999.  I'm doing this internship with the Hobart police
 department so I get to go on patrol with the guys and tackle the bad guys.
 So I've been doing that for (and yes this is all relevent) three months
 now.  I've found my favorite officer, his name is Mark.  Yet another
 uniform.  So I'm interested in this guy and he acts all interested in me,
 so I suggested that we hang out.  So we did.  We got off patrol at about
 11:15pm which is later that usual.  And we go get to his place so he can
 change out of his uniform.  Well, he changed and I didn't like it.  I
 prefer him with the uniform.  I can't figure out why, maybe because I'm
 submissive or something.... maybe passive aggressive.  So he's in plain
 clothes now and I feel strange being with him after work... so we rented
 a movie and then went out to eat.  Ronin is a really good movie and I
 recommend it.  But I still don't understand why uniforms, but at least I
 don't have some weird foot fetish or something, leather and chains.  So
 now you know too much of my love life.

        Before my date with Mark I was supposed to go out with a different
 cop.  His name is Tony, but he never called like he said he was so I never
 called him.  But there goes the uniform again.  Maybe I should go see a
 psychiatrist.  Maybe something really is wrong with me.  Maybe I really
 shouldn't be dating a cop from the department that I'm interning at.  If
 you have any advice for me or can tell me why I like uniforms please tell
 me.  I need help.
