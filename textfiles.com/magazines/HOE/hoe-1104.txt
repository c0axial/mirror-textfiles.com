 hello. My name is Isaac. I am retarded.

 My mother drank when she had me in her, and now she helps me right this
 letter.  My father shot himself in the head, and now he is dead. My
 mother says he went to hell it is wrong to kill yourself.

 I like to eat bananas. 
 I like to watch the brady bunch.

 some times I cry. but I am strong I don't cry that much.
 one time there was  girl at school who talked to me. she was there to
 tutor me.

 people think I am stupid. but I am not. I am just retarded.
 and that means I am different.

 i think people don't like being different. but i don't mind.

 i think people don't know what things mean.
 things mean things. I know this to be true.

 all places are the same
 I believe this.

 one time I wanted to slit my wrists behind the CONCO because i thought
 CONCO was a funny word.  everything is a game
