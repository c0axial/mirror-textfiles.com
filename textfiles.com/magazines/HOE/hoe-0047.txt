   The world was quiet that Friday.  Father Gregg was smoking again.  Smokin'
that big black cigar at the diner where he ate his breakfast every morning.
A nice, hot plate of Scrambled Eggs was placed in front of him by the young
blonde waitress.  He couldn't help but notice her perky breasts.  He put it
out of his mind and smiled.  Life was peaceful.

   After a few minutes there was a well dressed young businessman that came
in.  He took a seat next to the Father for no particular reason.  Father
Gregg couldn't help but notice his handsomeness or his strong build.
   
   "Hey cutie." the waitress said with a smile.  "What can I get'cha Timmy?"
   "Hey Tina.  I dunno... I guess the usual..." he replied in a semi-daze.
Tim seemed to be unusually hyper for a man of his age.  He was surprised to
see a priest next to him when he turned to examine his surroundings for the
first time.
   "Hey...you be a fatha'!" he said in a condescending "black talk" voice.
   "Umm... well, yes I am." Father Gregg replied feeling suddenly
uncomfortable, as if he was being watched.
   "Yea... How religious of a father are ya'?" Tim asked with an unsettling
smirk.  Gregg became even more disturbed.  This man seemed to be gearing up
for something.
   "I do my work for the lord as any priest." 
   "But do ya'...you know...do ya' do 'the bop' with little boys?"
   "I most certainly DO NOT." Gregg was shocked that the young stranger would
even think of something like that.
   "I'm just wonderin'... what do you think of Atheists?" he asked in a
slightly more sincere tone, which made Father Gregg relax slightly.
   "I think they are confused.  It saddens me that there are so many." Gregg
replied with total sincerity.
   "Do you think I'm gonna go to hell for bein' one?" he asked with the same
sarcastic smirk he had originally.  He looked like he was anxiously waiting
the reply, which again made Gregg nervous.
   "Well... I will pray for you." Father Gregg replied in the safest answer
he could.  Tim grinned deeply.
   "Hah.. well, what if I was to tell you..." Tim's voice became very loud
as he shouted out: "FUCK Your FAKE GOD!"  Father Gregg was infuriated!  Who
was this man to come in here and say such rudeness?!  Who did he think he
was?!  The world around the two men seemed to almost catch on fire and glow
with a red rage.  Everything in a flash was heated.
   "How DARE YOU!  You ignorant, worthless, piece of shit."  he spurted out 
a little too fast and a long stream of spit fired from his mouth and into
Tina's eye.  She casually wiped it off.
   "Listen you old bastard.  I'm an Atheist because I know about your
bullshit.  That 'you are worthless' attitude is what fucking drove me away.
Religion is controlling, contrived, and manipulative.  It exists in order to
spread itself like a disease." Tim commanded as if he was making some sort of
grammatical correction on a piece of paper.  Everything suddenly began to
glow in through thier eyes.  The world became like one hig poetic hate match.
A Religious Poetry slam with an edge.  Unfortunatly, he realized that his
words had not even begun to penetrate the shell of the Priest.  "Black Death
belief...You and your Morality Police."  He was sure that last comment would
have stunned the Priest.  He was pushing it with a not-completely-provoked
outburst.  But he was wrong... Gregg's eyes gleamed angrily at him.  Gregg
remembered his younger days when he would eat these types of self-righteous
pricks for breakfast.
   "I'm seen your kind before.  You're a faithless, hopeless, confused idiot.
Listen - your anarchy shit, we don't need it.  Get you mesh-meshed waffling
ass out of our god-loving country!" Gregg spurted.  Another ream of spit
launched from his mouth, hitting his eggs.  He was ready to yell for hours
at this damn ogre.
   "You'll never really get it, backboneless, Brainwashed, devoted worm.  Go
back to your book.  Squirm back into your clergies demanding grasp, if you
want to go to heaven so bad, why don't you just die?" Tim yelled out.  His
coffee had arrived.  As he waited for a response, for a split second he saw
the waitress was wide-eyed and he realized that he and the priest were
creating quite a stir in the old diner.
   "Commit to the obvious evidence.  Your fucking with laws that you can't
control.  When your finished drinking, fucking, and killing in your
darkness - you liar - Enjoy your burning ass in hellfire." yelled out Gregg.
His voice almost cracked.  Gregg had completely forgotten all but his current
target of aggression.  All these years of stupid, faithless, spoiled kids
had primed years of rage that was finally coming out.  It was almost poetic
hate.
   "Hypocritical, faithful, dogmatic, zombie.  If you live like Christ really
did you would die before you could make the sacrifice consciously.  Stop
spreading your lie."
   "Go back to your damned narcotic underworld.  Unpure and unsure,
spiritless, soul of death.  Evil thoughts - and my what you're taught in
school - Secular humanist bullshit teacher's tool.  Mushy Liberal Idealist.
Unrealistic and wrong." Gregg was devoted to making his point.  It was time
that the voice was heard.  He honestly believed, for a split second, that he
would be able to make Tim see the same light that he saw.
   "Holy shit, God bless you!" Tim shouted as he finally stood up.  He was
much more intimidating standing up.  He used that trick all his life.  "Your
tired, well-versed in a book of boring faerie tales.  Pointless, Biased ways
to live your life.  Everything is easy to manipulate with your little black
book of fate."  The words were passing right by Gregg.  He COULDN'T let
himself be sucked into it.  He had to make him see.
   "Give into the truth.  Stop fighting the beauty, be born again - it's the
Big bang, part II - get that cosmic spirit deja vu.  God gave you brains,
respect the gift." he cried out.  Tim realized this yelling "game" was much
bigger to the priest.
    "Everyone who didn't originate your catalog of demands gets shafted.  A
trick well crafted.  Gays, Women, and anything not YOU is left in the dark,
no spark - no clue.  This is the end for you my enemy.  This is the end for
you my friend." Tim stomped his foot, which made a banging that was heard
loudly across the diner.  He drank his coffee in one gulp and walked out.
He didn't look into the father's eyes.  The two never met again, but both of
them remembered each other till their dying day.

    |   Well, HOE people.  It makes me sad to say that I'm leaving    |
    |   the modem world. There is a lot of messed up personal shit    |
    |   that is simply  preventing me from really  ever living the    |
    |   same life I formally led.   I urge HOE to say rolling with    |
    |   the files and wish them and Mogel good luck.   Abigwar - I    |
    |   never told you, but thanks for writing what you write.   I    |
    |   may actually send writing on paper to Mogel to use for HOE    |
    |   in the future VERY occasionally, but you've basically seen    |
    |   the last of me for a long time.   I'm sure you're melting.    |
