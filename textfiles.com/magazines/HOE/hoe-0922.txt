      Ah.  Once again, I cop out of actually writing something to show
 everybody yet another heaping steaming pile of hippo shit that I found on
 USENET about 5 months ago.  This one rules.  The all-too-familiar bumper
 sticker comes to mind - "God, protect me from your followers."  Indeed.

 yeah    there were alot of stupid things people did in the name of
 christianity and for there undouted misconception they will surely burn in
 hell, unless they ask and truely wish to be forgiven, i can not answer any
 question on why these things happened i can only tell you that in the only
 true sorce of knowlegde christians have of god and his works it says 
 nowhere that jews are evil any hitlwer just didnt like jews cause they
 had more money that him

 and yes my statement can easily be seen as a cop out but that rases the
 question of critical thinging as you noted, have you ever done it. have you
 ever taken the time to peruse the bible and think about what it says enough
 to acctually know what you're talking about... i realise that many people
 use "all is possible though god" as a cop out but i acctually believe it.

 in response to what others have said, many atheist look down upon
 christians because they believe that belief an anything beside the
 "almighty science" is submitting yourself to ignorance. I am a science
 magor at a mogor university, i search for knowledge of both god and the
 natural world, and search for them with an open mind, if by some stroke
 of chance god was disproven by science then i would believe in that
 truth. but i say to you now, i have seen no truth that can be indefiatly
 proven for what is proof, merely the summation of opur perceptions, and
 as anyone who thinks critacally knows perception is flawed beyond the
 power of humans to repair.
