	What are my passions?  Where do they reside?  What kind of piece
 of shit am I?  I wish I was able to verbalize my thoughts.  These concepts
 and conclusions of the mind.  I am.  You may or may not be.  That matters
 not.  Everything that I do or that which is done tome or to you (who may
 or may not exist) does not matter.  I look for the "end" or "goal" in
 life.  (I hate this pen.)  When in reality (forbid I use such a word) the
 "end"/"goal" does not exist/The whole is of everything.  The individual
 makes up only nothing.  In being, life as perceived through my senses tell
 me that I am.  That is all that should be important.  The fact that I am.
 I'm lost.  There is so much that I want.  Material things, physical
 pleasures, deprivations, mental and emotional.  I hate you.  I LOVE!
	Love: Willingness to give up everything for the connection.  The
 line of communication of sharing experiences both good and bad without
 worry of desertion, or contentment.  I am not important.  In the process,
 neither are you.  It is the process itself that is important.
	Why is it that people are always in reference to each other?  Rather
 being in reference to what all people owe; existence?  Thought, above all
 else, thought!  That is what separates a great person or "genius" from
 the rest.
	Hubris is the striving goal of anti-christianity; who better to
 support this than Nietzsche.  As Hubris is the best way to describe
 Nietzsche altogether.  The path of the warrior, or "free spirit" is the
 only way to greatness.  What does one gain in greatness that makes
 greatness so very great great?  Absolutely nothing.  It's knowing I am, I
 mean nothing, I have a responsibility to the whole of humanity.  What's
 mine is mine, equality is for those who envy "me" and what "I" have.
 (these "" are in reference in training to thought).  What does one
 sacrifice in greatness, oh but that answer, the truth, is more disturbing
 than you would think.  Friends; in greatness one can not have friends.
