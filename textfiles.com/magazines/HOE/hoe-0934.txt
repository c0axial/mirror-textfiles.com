	What the fuck, is humbleness and humility a lost cause?  As I walk
 across campus, if I bump into someone, I try to say "excuse me" or
 something to that effect, but if it seems to me that some people just
 don't seem to care.  What did I do to them, and who are they to pull and
 attitude with me.

	Maybe it was the fact that there was no other way for either of us
 to walk.  There was that eye contact from a good 5-10 yards away.  Just
 before we would have collided, he shifted, and as we as humans seem to
 do, I shifted at the same time in the same direction.  So, as you
 probably all have done, you move, he moves, the challenger.

	But then too, maybe you are the challenger to your challenger.  
 What is it about us that makes us want to "compete" in a sense?  Yes I
 love a good gave of basketball or football, but not while walking to
 class.  I by nature, am a rather passive person.  But at times, the right
 times, I am aggressive.  Usually evoked into being aggressive.  Not in a
 bad way, but for sports and things of that nature.  Yes, like all humans
 I have my times of aggression that is a vent for anger.  Although, I try
 to express my anger passively, it seems to come out more aggressively,
 like punching a whole in a wall or slamming a freshmen's head in a
 locker.

	It also seems to me that with all the aggressiveness of sports,
 which is well needed and enjoyable, but some people take it to a
 different level.  I am friends with many competitive athletes.  In some
 of them I see athletes who leave their high levels of aggressiveness on
 the field and become more humble and passive the rest of the time.  These
 people, have a tight grasp on how they need to behave in life. Then there
 are the people who feel that they have to be aggressive 24 7.  I want to
 smack these people. I mean, what the fuck, they may want to compete, but
 maybe just maybe the other person could care less who wins or loses. Ahh
 well...what the fuck do i know.  i guess i just don't have that drive for
 winning constantly. so here's what i say. fuck them.
