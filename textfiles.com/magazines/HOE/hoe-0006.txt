        Fuck you.  That's what I have to say to anyone who rags on Nirvana.
  Nirvana is the ultimate.  Sure, sure...they hit it big with Nevermind, 
  and there were a million 12-year-old punks in flanel that paraded around
  them, but let's get real... they had no fucking clue what the hell
  Nirvana was.  These were the voices of a normal guy... he made a desperate
  attempt to not be pop, to stay himself... but fuckit... he was talented
  and the world couldn't hold him back.  He cursed his popularity, but he
  really was a revoluationary of all proportions... Respect a genious.  I
  have compiled just about all of Nirvana's songs together here... Yes,
  you are reading this by an ORIGINAL REAL Nirvana fan.  Oh, and by the way,
  you have no IDEA how hard it was to FINALLY get these lyrics decyphred.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

                                BLEACH
                                ~~~~~~
                1) Blew

If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew.
and if you wouldn't mind, I would like it loose.
and if you wouldn't care, I would like to leave.
and if you wouldn't mind, I would like to breathe.

Is there another reason for your stay?
Could you believe him when you discussed his stain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame!
You could do anything!

                2) Floyd the Barber

Hello Cobain come on in,
Floyd now says, has my hairy chin.
Sit down in the chair, don't be afraid!
Steaming hot towel in my face!
I'm ashamed...

Barber ties me to the chair, 
I can't see - I'm really scared!
Floyd burns alright he'll sell,
they depress against my nails.
I'm ashamed...

Lies and suffers in the room,
Oh reality - Looking at me I presume,
They take turns and cut me up,
I die smothered and he's not.
I'm ashamed...

                3) About a Girl

I need an easy friend,
I do whip her into land,
I don't think you fit this shoe,
I do, won't you have a clue?

I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry,
But I can see you ever night...Free!

I'm standing in your line,
I do hope you have the time,
I do pick a number too,
I do keep a date with you.

                4) School

Won't you believe it, it's just my luck!
No recess!
Your in High School again.

                5) Love Buzz

Would you believe me when I tell you,
you are the queen of my heart?
Please don't decieve me when I hurt you,
just ain't the way it seems.
Can you feel my love buzz?

                6) Paper Cuts

When I'm feeling tired,
she puts you through the door,
I crawl towards the cursed alley,
sometimes I can't find my way,
this Kurdt is spellbound(?),
so get all you can,
a cool man is toughening - Too plain,
a good hosing down.

When the hate in my field maternal all four,                
cannot look me in the eyes,
but I asked the years ham radio blew,
and the car, twist, mouth, fear!  YEAH!
I think so....Nirvana...                         <-- Cool. Name of Group.

Back when 'twas a party,
I scratched with my nails,
I see now that she's just like me,
why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the holy ones,
they pointed my way,
they come with the flashing lights,
and take my family away.

AN-GR-Y later I am known to,
slap some friends of ridicule,
my whole existance is for your fears,
and that is why I'm here with you!
Don't taaake
me awwaaaay
Your around.
Nirvana...

                7) Negative Creep

This is out our range....NO!
This is getting to be....GROSS!
I'm a negative creep - I'm a negative creep - I'm a negative creep
..and I'm STONED!
I'm a negative creep - I'm a negative creep - I'm a negative creep 
..and I'm...I'm...
Daddy's little girl ain't a girl no more.

                8) Scoff

In my eyes I'm not lazy,
In my face it's not over,
In your room I'm not older,
In your eyes I'm not worth it...
Gimmie back my alcohol.
Gimmie all your...Love!  FUCK!

                9) Swat Meet

They need a lifestyle that is comfortable,
they travel far to keep their stomachs full,
they make a living off of arts and crafts,
the conversations just would never laugh.
They make a deal when they come to town,
the sunday swap meet is a battle ground.

She loves it more than she will ever know,
he loves it more than he will ever show,
keeps his cigarettes close to his heart,
keeps her photographs close to her heart,
keeps the bus-i-nes close to the heart.

                10) Mr. Moustache

Fill me in on your new vision,
wake me up with indecision,
help me trust your mind and wisdom.
Yes I eat cow, no I'm not proud.           <-- Think he ever heard of cDc?

Show me how you question, question,
lead the way to my temptations,
take my hand and keep it clean.
As I eat cow, I am not proud.

Is it an easychair?
Oversized rock,
I don't like it anyway,
silver metal box.
I'm new.
I'm who?
I'm you - Ahhhhhhhhh!

                11) Sifting

Afraid to grade, wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self-loss, wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed, wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear no one, wouldn't it be fun?

Your eyes, treat yourself, treat yourself,
don't have nothing for you.

Smell the smell, wouldn't it be fun?
Search for a church, wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed, wouldn't it be fun?
Cold is gold, wouldn't it be fun?

                12) Big Cheese

Big cheese make me, mine says, "Go to the office"
Big cheese make me, mine says, "One that stays"

Black is black - straight back,
need more enemies,
show you all what a man is.

Big lies make my, mine says, "Go to the office"
Big cheese make me, message?  What is that?

Black is black - straight back,
need more enemies,
She is glue, how are you?

                13) Downer

Put you sincerity,
I've got royalty,
defending your country,
wish away.

I've had a lobatomy,
save your family,
surrealistic fantasy,
bad boy - fight!

All we know is restitution,
living in your date of future.
There's hope, please show me faster,
Don't forget to pass a riot.

Somebody served a dinner,
much like I am, 
I know I can't make enough although,
if you go along I sing your song.

Sickening pessimists,
picketing masses,
separated communists, 
apocalyptic bastards,
rinky dink god,
for putting me on this earth,
being very frivolous,
Death in mind - Nurse!!                <- Note: all these songs sound
                                              like suicide notes, eh?


                                NEVERMIND
                                ~~~~~~~~~
                1) Smells like Teen Spirit

Load up on guns and bring your friends,
It's fun to lose and to pretend,
she's overboard and self assured,
oh no, I know a dirty word.

Hello, Hello, Hello, How low?

I'm worse at what I do best,
and for this gift I feel blessed,
Our little group tribe has always been,
and always will until the end.

And I forget just why I taste,
oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile,
I found it hard, it was hard to find...
oh well, whatever, nevermind...                      <-- Classic line.

With the lights out it's less dangerous!
Here we are now!  Entertain us!
I feel stupid and contagious!
Here we are now!  Entertain us!
A mulatto,
an albino,
a misquito,
my libido,
yay, a denial!

                2) In Bloom

Sell you kids for food - weather changes moods.
Spring is here again - reproductive glands.

He's the one who like all the pretty song,
and he like to sing along,
and he likes to shoot his gun,
but he knows not what it means,
and I said ahhh

We can have somemore - nature is a whore.
Bruises on the fruit - tender age in bloom.

                3) Come as you are

Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be.
As a friend, as a freind, as an old enemy.
Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours - don't be late.
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old memoria.

Come dowsed in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be,
as a friend, as a freind, as an old memoria.

And I swear that I don't have a gun, 
no, I don't have a gun.

                4) Breed

I don't care...if I'm old.
I don't mind...if I don't have a mind.
Go away...from your home.
I'm afraid...of a ghost.

Even if you have,
even if you need,
I don't mean to stare,
we don't have to breed,
we could plant a house,
we could build a tree,
I don't even care, 
we could have all three, 
she said.

                5) Lithium

I'm so happy because today I've found my freinds,
they're in my head.
I'm so ugly, but that's ok, 'cause so are you,
We've broken our mirrors.
Sunday morning is every day for all I care,
And I'm not scared,
light my candles in a daze 'cause I found god! Hey!

I'm so happy because today I shaved my head,
and I'm not sad.
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard,
but I'm not sure.
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there,
but I don't care.
I'm so horny, but that's ok,
my will is good. Hey!

                6) Polly

Polly wants a cracker, I think I should get off her first.
I think she wants some water to put out the blow torch.

It isn't me, we have some seed.
Let me clip your dirty wings,
Let me take a ride, don't hurt yourself.
I want some help, to help myself.

I've got some rope, you have been told.
I promise you, I have been true,
Let me take a ride, Don't hurt yourself.
I want some help, to help myself.

Polly says her back hurts - she's just as bored as me.
She caught me off my guard - it amazes me, the will of instinct.

                7) Territorial Pissings

When I was an alien, cultures weren't options.

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there.
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait.

Never met a wise man, if so it's a woman.

Just because you're paranoid, 
don't meant they're not after you.                    <-- Classic Line.

                8) Drain You

One baby to another said "I'm lucky I met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me.
It is now my duty to completely drain you.
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection.

Chew your meat for you,
pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss,
from my mouth to yours, because I like you.

With eyes so dialted, I've become your pupil.
You taught me everything without a poison apple.
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student.
Indebted and greatful - vaccum out the fluids.

Sloppy lips to lips - your my vitamins,
because I like you.

                9) Lounge Act

Truth covered in security,
I can't let you smother me.
I'd like it, but it wouldn't work,
trading off and taking turns.
I don't regret a thing.
And I've got this friend, you see,
who makes me feel,
and I wanted more than I could steal.
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield,
I'll go out of my way to prove,
I still smell her on you.

Don't tell me what I want to hear!
Afraid of never knowing fear!
Experience everything you need!
I'll keep fighting jealously,
until it's fucking gone!

I'll go out of my way to make a deal,
we've made a pact to learn,
from who ever we want without new rules.
We'll share what's lost and what we grew,
They'll go out of their way to prove,
they still smell her on you.

                10) Stay Away

Monkey see, Monkey do.
I don't know why I'd rather be dead than cool.         <-- <cough, cough>
Every line ends in rhyme,
less is more, love is blind.
Stay away!
Give an inch, take a smile,
fashion shits, fashion style.
Throw it out and keep it in.
Have to have poison skin.
Stay way!
God is gay, burn the flag.

                11) On a Plain

I'll start this off without any words,
I got so high I scratched till I bleed. 

I love myself better than you,
I know it's wrong, but what should I do?
I'm on a plain.  I can't complain.

The finest day that I ever had, 
was when I learned to cry on command.
My mother died every night,
it's safe to say, don't quote me on that.
The black sheep got blackmailed again,
forgot to put on the zipcode.
It is now time to make in unclear,
to write off lines that don't make sense.

Somewhere I have heard this before.
In a dream my memory has stored.
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed.
What the hell am I trying to say?

One more special message to go,
and then I'm done, I can can go home.

                12) Something in the Way

Underneath the bridge the tarp has sprung a leak,
and the animals I've trapped have all become my pets,
and I'm living off of grass and the drippings from the ceiling,
but it's ok to fish, 'cause they don't have any feelings.
It's something in the way.

                13) Mystery 13th Song

This song is cool, but I have no clue as to the words.

                        
                        INCESTICIDE         <-- This album is AWESOME.
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~             Totally underated!

                1) Dive

Earth.
Big me, big me yeah.
Live alone long, sleep no.
I resign the lease, yeah.
Everyone is hollow.
Big me, big me yeah.
Everyone is waiting.
Big me, big me yeah.
You can leave the payment.
Hey! Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive at me!

Kiss this, kiss that yeah.
You can be my hero.
Big me, Big me yeah.
Everyone is waiting.
Hit me, hit you yeah.
I refuse to hate it.

                2) Sliver

Mom & Dad went to a show,
they dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's,
I kicked and screamed, said "please no"
Grandma take me home!

Had to eat my dinner there,
Mashed Potatoes, and stuff like that.               <--{Grin: Dan Quayle}
couldn't chew 'em, I mixed the food.
Grandma take me home!

She said, "My god just stop your crying,
go outside and ride your bike!"
It's what I did, I killed my toe(?).
Grandma take me home!

After dinner I had ice cream,
I fell asleep & watched TV,
I woke up in my mother's arms!
Grandma take me home!
I wanna be alone.

                3) Stain

Well he never bleeds,
and he never fucks,
and he never leaves,
'cause he's got bad luck.

Well he never reads,
and he never rusts,
and he never sleeps,
'cause he's got bad luck, yeah.
I'm a stain!

                4) Been a Son

She should have stayed away from friends,
She should have had more time to spend,
She should have died when she was born,
She should have worn her crown of thorns.
She should have been a son.

She should have stood out in a crowd,
She should have made her Mother proud,
She should have fallen on her stance,
She should have had another chance.
She should have been a son.

                5) Turnaround

Take a step outside yourself,
and turnaround,
take a look at what you are,
it's pretty scary!
So silly - It's revolting,
Your not much of anything.

Take a step outside the city,
and turnaround,
take a look at what you are,
it's revolting!
Your really no where,
so wasteful,
so foolish,
Copycat(?).

Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em.
Go for that crazy salad restaurant,
'cause they're gonna try to get behind you.
Don't let 'em do it.
Know what I'm talking about?  You hear me talking?
Tell me your so revolting - It's pretty scary!

Take a step out of the country,
and turnaround,
take a look at what you are,
it's amazing!
Take a good look, you're no big deal.
Your so petty - It's a life.

Take a step outside the planet,
and turn around and around,
take a look at what you are,
it's pretty scary!

                6) Molly's Lips        <-- The story of Kurt & Courney?

She said to take me anywhere,
as long as she stays with me.
She said she'd take me anywhere,
as long as I stayed clean.

Kiss, Kiss Molly's lips.

She said she'd take me anywhere,
as long as she stays clean,
She said she'd take me anywhere,
as long as I stayed clean.

I kiss, kiss Molly's Lips.

                7) Son of a Gun

Up, up, up and down.
Turn, turn, turnaround.
Round, round, roundabout and over again.
Gun, gun, sold a gun.                             <-- Bought one too, eh?
You are the only one.

If it makes any difference in what I say.
Soldiers in the bed room where we play.
The rain, it always starts when you go away.

                8-12) These songs: Beeswax, Mexican Seafood, Hairspray
                      Queen, Aero Zepplin, and Bing Long Now...they are 
                      REALLY hard to get... I can't get anymore than bits
                      and pieces to put here, and that's not worth it :(.

                13) Anearysm

Come on over and do the twist! Ahh!
Over do it and have a fit! Ahh!
Love you so much it makes me sick! Ahh!
Come on over and do the twist! Ahh!

Beat me out of me!  (Bleed it, Bleed it)

Come on over and do the twist! Ahh!
Over do it and have a fit! Ahh!
Love you so much it makes me sick! Ahh!
Come on over and shoot the shit! Ahh!

She keeps a pulpit straight to my heart!


                                IN UTERO
                                ~~~~~~~~

                1) Serve the Servants

Teenage Angst has paid off well,
now I'm bored and old.
Self appointed Judge's Judge,
more then they have sold.

If she floats then she is not a witch like we thought,
A down payment on another, one of Salem's lot.

Serve the Servants - Oh no.
That ledgendary divorce is such a bore.

As my bones grew they did hurt,
they hurt really bad.
I tried hard to have a father,
but instead I had a dad.

I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore,
there is nothing left for me that I haven't felt before.

                2) Scentless Apprentice

Like most babies smell like butter, 
he smells like no other.
He was born scentless and senseless.
He was born a scentless apprentice.
Go away - Get away!

Every wet nurse refused to feed him,
Electrodes smell like semen,
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets.
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers.

I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms,
leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume.
You can't fire me because I quit.
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit.

                3) Rape Me

Rape me, my freind.
Rape me, again.
I'm not the only one.
Hate me,
do it and do it again.
Waste me,
Taste me, my friend.

My favorite inside source,
I kiss your open sores.
Appreciate your concern,
You'll always stink and burn.

                4) Heart-Shaped Box

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak.
I've been locked inside your heart shaped box for a week.
I was drawn into your magnet tar pit trap.
I wish I could eat your cancer when it turns black.

Hey! Wait! I've got a new complaint!
Forever indebt to your precious advice!

Meat eating orchids forgive no one just yet.
Cut myself on Angel's hair and baby's breath.
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black.
Throw down your umbilicle noose, so I can climb right back.     <-- Hmm.

                5) Francis Farmer will have her Revenge on Seattle

It's so relieving to know that your leaving, 
as soon as you get paid.
It's so relaxing to hear that your asking,
whenever you get your way.
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me,
this is starting to sound the same.
I miss the comfort in being sad.

In her false witness, I hope you're still with us,
to see if they float or drown.
Our favorite patient, a display of patience, disease covered puget sound.
She'll come back as fire, 
to burn all the liars and leave a blanket of ash on the ground.
I miss the comfort in being sad.

                6) Dumb

I'm not like them, but I can pretend.
The Sun is gone, but I have a light.
The day is done, but I'm having fun.
I think I'm dumb, or maybe just happy - I think I'm just happy.

My heart is broke, But I have some glue.
Let me inhale, and mend it with you.
We'll float around and hang out on clouds.
Then well come down, and have a hang over.

Skin the sun, 
Fall asleep,
Wish away, 
the soul is cheap.
Lesson learned, 
wish me luck.
Soothe the burn, 
wake me up.

                7) Very Ape

I am buried up to my neck in contradictary flies.
I'm the king of illiterature, I'm very ape and I'm very nice.

If you ever need me, don't hesitate to ask someone else first.
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive.
I've seen it all, I was here first.

Out of the ground,
into the sky,
out of the sky,
into the dirt.

                8) Milk it

I am my own parasite,
I don't need a host to live.
We feed off of each other.
We share our endorphins.
Doll Steak, test meat.

I own my own pet virus.
I get to pet and name her.
Her milk is my shit - My shit is her milk.
Doll Steak, test meat.

Look, on the bright side is suicide,                      <-- Shit!!!
Lost eyesight I'm on your side.
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing.
Lack of Iron and/or sleeping.
Protector of the Kennel.
Ecto-Plasma, Ecto-Skeletal.
Obituary Birthday.
Your sent is still here in my place of recovery!

                9) Pennyroyal Tea

I'm on my time with everone,
I have very bad posture.

Sit and drink pennyroyal tea,
distill the life that's inside of me.
Sit and drink pennyroyal tea,
I'm anemic royalty.

Give me a Leonard Cohen afterword,
So I can sigh eternally,
I'm so tired I can't sleep.
I'm a liar and a theif.

Sit and drink pennyroyal tea,
I'm anemic royalty.
I'm on warn milk an dlaxitives,
Cherry flavored antacids.

                10) Radio Friendly Until Shifter

Use just once and destroy,
invasion of our privacy,
afterbirth of a nation, 
stare without your skeleton key.

I love you for what I am not,
I do not want what I have got,
A blanket Acne'ed with cigarette burns,
speak at once, while taking turns,
second-rate third degee burns.

What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What do I think I think?

This has nothing to do with what you think,
if you ever think at all,
Bi-polar opposites attract,
all of a sudden my water broke.

Hate, Hate your enemies,
Save, save your friends,
find, your place, 
Speak, Speak the truth.

                11) Tourette's

No fucking clue.

                12) All Apologies

What else should I be?      All apologies.
What else should I say?     Everyone is gay.
What else should I write?   I don't have the right.
What else should I be?      All apologies.

In the sun, In the sun I feel as one.
In the sun, In the sun I'm married...buried.

I wish I was like you...easily amused.
Find my nest of salt...everything is my fault.
I'll take all the blame...aqua seafoam shame.
Sunburn with freezer burn...choking on the ashes of her enemy.
All is all is all we are.


                                UNPLUGGED
                                ~~~~~~~~~

                1) Jesus don't want me for a Sunbean(Vasolines Song)

Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam.
Sunbeams are never made like me.
Don't expect me to cry,
for all the reasons...I'd rather die.
Don't ever ask that of me.
Don't expect me to cry,
don't expect me to lie,
don't expect me to die...for it.                          <-- We didn't.

                2) Plateau(Meat Puppet's Song)

Many a hand has scaled grand old face of the plateau,
some belong to strangers and some to folks you know.
Holy Ghost and talk show hots are planted in the sand.
Beautify the foothills and shape the many hands.

There's nothing on top,
but a bucket and a mop,
and an illustrated book about birds.
You'll see a lot up there, but don't be scared.
Who needs actions when you got words?

Fist with a mop and you can't stop,
and look at what you've done.
Plateaus cleans no dirt to be seen,
and the work it was fun.

Many a hands began to scan around for the next plateau,
some say it was Greenland and some say Mexico,
others decided it was no where except for where they stood
-- those were just guesses,
they'd help you if they could.

                3) Lake of Fire(more Meat Puppets)

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the Angels fly.
They go to a lake of fire and fry.
See 'em again till the Fouth of July.

I knew a lady who came from the Louve,
bit by a dog with a rabid tooth,
she went to her grave just a little too soon,
flew all laid out on the yellow moon.

People cry and people moan,
they look for a dry face to call their own, 
try to find some place to rest their bones,
while the Angels and the Devils try to make them their own.

        Note: Thanks to Spiff for showing me the light.

        I would REALLY love the lyrics for any of the songs that I couldn't
 get here (The last Nevermind, the one in In Utero, and the few in 
 Incesticide).  Please try to get these files passed around so I could get
 a copy... Kurt will live on in us.
