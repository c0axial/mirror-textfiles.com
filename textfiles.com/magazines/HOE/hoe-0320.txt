        This is something I found... it's an essay that my roommate wrote
 for one of his classes.  And yes, he intended this little gem to be
 completely serious.

 "Same Sex Marriages"
 by Mike ****

        Greg is a "fly by the seat of your pants" kind of guy.  He enjoys
 arguing and is intelligent enough to back his reasoning with ideas that
 will only fool.  Greg and I have been friends since we were very young.
 I am exactly the opposite in reasoning and personality when compared to
 Greg.  However, I also like to tease my points beyond recognition.
 Outside of the friendship, our lives are lived differently to the
 extremes.  My family is very religious and very close in our
 relationships towards one another.  Greg's parents have been divorced
 for ten years now.  He never goes to church and he often finds himself
 sleeping at others houses more than his own.  Our friendship is
 wonderful, but our different ideas and beliefs lead to countless hours
 of arguing on whom is right, and who is wrong.  One day over
 Thanksgiving break we had a rather heated argument.

        "Are you kidding me?" I said.  "Gays and lesbians should never be
 allowed to legally marry.  It says in the Bible that it is a sin.  As a
 matter of fact, I think homosexuality should be illegal.  Right here,
 in 1 Corinthians 6:9 it says, 'Do you not know that the wicked will not
 inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually
 immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor
 homosexual offenders' (New International Version).

        "Well, just forget about that for a second, will you?" Greg said.
 "Just think of all the benefits gays and lesbians will be granted if
 they can marry.  I read that there are nearly 400 legal advantages
 associated with same-sex marriages, including such ideas as joint
 income taxes, hospital visits, benefits in insurance (Bullough 49).
 Just think how much it would help these people.  Besides, even though
 your so-called religion says that homosexuality is sinful, it is a
 known fact that it has been around for hundreds of years.  So why don't
 we just help them?  Wouldn't that be the Christian thing to do anyway?"

        "Oh be quiet," I said.  "I can't help it that I base my beliefs
 on my religion.  That is what I grew up believing.  I just don't
 understand.  Homosexual marriages would be too much for me to handle.
 Don't you think it would be strange to see homosexual couples 'happily
 married' and on their way to living a happy life?  It just seems
 ridiculous to me."

        "And why is it so ridiculous," Greg said with a lethargic nod of
 his head.  "We didn't accept blacks years ago, just like we don't
 accept immigrants from many other countries today.  You might not like
 to admit it, but we don't accept these people.  Just wait.  Homosexuals
 will be common place in society in the span of a few years I bet.  You
 know that we have always been the dominant race, well, at least
 considered the dominant race.  Many dominant groups step away and avoid
 conflict.  This is especially true when the dominant group is
 experiencing trouble in their lives.  In this case, homosexual
 marriage, or even just homosexuals for that matter.  Anyway, what
 dominant groups usually cannot act on, or even imagine, is that 'the
 situation of inequality in fact deprives them.'  It is not normal to
 have homosexuality or similar oddities exist in the lives of dominant
 figures (Miller 7).  Since the legalizing of homosexual marriages is
 not normal to the majority of our society, we will continue to bring
 conflict upon the idea, but over time it will be accepted.  It is
 obvious Mike!"

        "I don't know Greg.  I still don't think it should be
 legalized," I said with a grin. "I now what you mean.  Don't think I'm
 pushing away your thoughts.  Even one of my professors, Dr. Wayne
 Dornan at school said, 'Why shouldn't homosexuals be allowed to legally
 marry.  Those who oppose the idea think it is wrong only because the
 so-called offenders would set bad examples.  Homosexuals have been
 around forever.  They should be allowed to legally wed if they want
 to.' "Whatever," I thought.  Legalizing same-sex marriages would be
 like crossing a huge boundary, being unable to cross back and recognize
 the stress you placed upon your people.  I don't think my views on this
 matter would be altered even if I did not grow up going to church.
 Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the homosexuals do not
 hold any power to support their cause.  They grow in number and that's
 about it.  Our whole lives we have grown up without contact of many
 true homosexuals.  Our society is an abode to many same-sex couples,
 but why should we allow them to legally marry when we live in a country
 that is supposedly "one nation under God."  I mean really, even our
 currency says "in God we trust."  Do you even know what that means Greg?
 I know we live in a secular state and we have the freedom of religion,
 but being homosexual is a religion in itself almost.  It goes against
 all that we are as moral beings.

        Oh, now that is harsh, Greg said forcefully.  Everyone has
 different morals.  How can you force an unproven believe upon these
 people and all of us just the equal?  Your religion is not the best
 religion.  Besides, we're not even talking about that here.  We're
 talking about sexuality and the legalization of marriage for two people
 who are in love.  You're so caught up in the whole "male" and "female"
 idea.  All those simple words do is symbolize how we categorize people.
 We tend to experience them more than words, however, treating them as
 representing some fixed objective reality.  We act as though "sex" is
 a word that means one thing and one thing only, regardless of culture,
 and that it includes only male and female (Patriarchy Chp.1).  Why do
 we have to force these sexual orientations upon these people and not
 let them have a choice?  It isn't fair.

        Well, it sounds to me like there isn't something you're telling
 me.  Is there something you want to tell me Greggy?  Mike said with a
 smirk and giggle.  Just kidding.  You're not even talking about
 legalizing marriages anymore.  You can't even focus on what we're
 talking about.  If you would not get so flustered, maybe you could
 logically present yourself.  Ok, listen to this.  What if I said that
 God did not create certain people homosexual.  He created us with the
 desire for the opposite sex.  Homosexuality is sin in God's eyes, but
 He still will forgive and help homosexuals overcome their wicked
 passions (Gen. 2, Rom. 1 NIV).

        Oh please, said Greg.  Can't you ever rid yourself of those
 fantastic Christian doctrines?

	No, I'm serious, Mike said solemnly.  I guess I still value the
 traditional views of family: a man, a woman, and the children that may
 result from their union.  So many dull-witted ideas have changed the
 meaning of family.  Advances in reproductive medical technology, the
 diminished blemishes of divorce, the increased acceptance of single
 parenthood, and especially the increase in gays and lesbians are the
 main reasons for the altered definition (Brienza 12).  My social
 characteristics inadvertently heighten my views of homosexual marriage.
 I do believe boundaries exist to be broken, do not get me wrong.  When
 in case the boundary is being broken by an immoral abstraction, I tend
 to disagree with that.  Sorry I can't see your point Greg.

        Yeah, that's ok, Greg thoughtfully replied.  I can't envision
 your side either.  I imagine that is the way it is for all of us.
 Homosexuality is something I don't particularly agree with also, but I
 feel it wouldn't hurt if they wanted to marry.  I guess there are many
 questions we both can not even fathom questioning or even answering for
 that matter.

        You're right, Mike said.  We will never fully understand the
 question whether legalizing homosexual marriages is right or not.  I
 just know that it will continue to be a downward spiral of a problem.
 My religion will continue to hold its believes just as I too will, but
 I guess as long as I am faithful, there will likewise be strong
 believers in same-sex marriage.  If homosexuals were allowed to legally
 marry, I'm sure there would be many benefits and advantages as you
 commented before, but I never see that happening.  I guess we'll just
 have to wait and see.

        Yep, Greg said with a smile.  I guess you're right.  Let's go
 home.  I'm hungry.
