	the darkest place, anywhere, everywhere. it is the lightest place
 you know. because our eyes perceive things backwards. what is good is
 bad, bad is good, evil is good and good is evil. dark is light and light
 is dark and red is green and purple is yellow. sun is a black hole, in
 which we are slowly becoming closer, too.  at night the sky is light,
 with little dark specs that are the millions of other black holes in the
 universe, sucking pulling us in.

	on the other side things are the way we think, but we are backward
 at everything, and we get things mixed up and jumbled and destroyed.

	and so is our nature.

	and in nature lives birds and trees and plants and green things
 and purple things and other sorts of color and shades of colors and
 shades of light (dark) and dark (light). you see. you understand, i hope.
 i am sick of explaining things.
