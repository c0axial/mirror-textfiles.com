      oh...its phairgirl. how...disappointing.

 #17: hello, it's me again (@slip129-37-189-186.ia.us.ibm.net)
      mr. todd... funny, last time i talked to you, you were being perfectly
      civil to me. why the change of heart?

  #2: Gerald D. Tarrant™ (@98cfd767.ipt.aol.com)
      Summer...because i've looked at your homepage since then and realized
      my first impression was correct, you're a fucking idiot.

 #17: hello, it's me again (@slip129-37-189-186.ia.us.ibm.net)
      thank you very much sir for your riveting commentary! it means so very
      much to me! someday, my dear, DEAR, DEAR FRIEND, you will learn to deal
      with your past and move on! and be A VERY HAPPY PERSON!#@!#@!#@!#@!
      HAAAAAAAAAAPY

      Summer, i'm glad you're having fun copying and pasting with your neato
      computer, but I just think that pokemon is the perfect thing for a fat
      unattractive compulsive lying codependant internet addict would latch
      onto.

 #17: hello, it's me again (@slip129-37-189-186.ia.us.ibm.net)
      i love pokemon! it is a japanese cartoon that i have liked for a long
      time! :) it makes me very happy!#@! and thank you again for your
      comments!#@! i appreciate them a lot! you make me so happy for caring!
      it's nice to know you haven't forgotten me!

 #17: hello, it's me again (@slip129-37-189-186.ia.us.ibm.net)
      gerald tarrant: you MUST WRITE FOR HOE!#@!#@!#@!

  #2: Gerald D. Tarrant™ (@98cfd767.ipt.aol.com)
      Whatever you say summer! Are you still
      PREGNANT?!

  #2: Gerald D. Tarrant™ (@98cfd767.ipt.aol.com)
      your "abortion" must have really messed you up

 #17: hello, it's me again (@slip129-37-189-186.ia.us.ibm.net)

      have a college degree and everything! YOU SHOULD BE PRESIDENT!#@!#@!
      and i can bear your children!#@!#@ the world will smile!#!#@!

        what is your fucking problem?

 <Me> I do not have a problem!#@!#@! you started it and I'M TELLING MOM

 Private message from #2: Gerald D. Tarrant™ (@98cfd767.ipt.aol.com)
        no really, what's the deal summer, what do you want from me?

 <Me> why do you think i want something from you? i come here all the
      time!#@! it has nothing to do with you!#@! i don't worry about what
      happened over 2 years ago, why do you? i am HAPPY!#@! YOU ARE
      SILLY!#@!

 Private message from #2: Gerald D. Tarrant™ (@98cfd767.ipt.aol.com)
        i'm not silly, i'm serious. if you could stop being tigger for half a
        minute and talk to me i might be able to understand this shit.

 <Me> and what kind of conversation would you like me to carry on, kind sir?
      THIS IS ME I AM A CRRRRAZY WEEHOO and you are pouting!#@!#@! STOP
      POUTING OR SOME BIRD WILL COME ALONG AND PECK OFF YOUR LIP!#@!#@!

 Private message from #2: Gerald D. Tarrant™ (@98cfd767.ipt.aol.com)
        alright i see, you're fucking worthless as a person and as a
        personality. you can't even carry on a conversation summer. good
        fucking luck.
