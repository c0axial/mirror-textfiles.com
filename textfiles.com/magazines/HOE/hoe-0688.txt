        i called up my friend jorge and i was like "man, dood, this shit's
 fucked up" because i was all depressed and shit.  and he like listened to me
 and shit, because i was goin on and on and on about all that shit that was
 goin on, and he just sat there and listened.  dude, my shit's so fucked up
 right now.  i gotta like figure out somethin to commit to, like drugs or a
 woman or school or a job or like SOMETHING because i ain't committed to
 anything right now.  i mean, like, can you really be committed to a woman
 and a school and all that shit all at the same time?  cos, i mean, it's like
 you gotta work at the school shit, and you gotta like spend time with the
 woman, and sometimes you really really just wanna be with the woman and like
 FUCK damn schoolwork, know what i'm sayin?

        it's a tough as hell thing to like decide if you should work or you
 should focus on the woman, because if the woman don't get enough your
 attention, she gonna split.  but then if you spent too much time with the
 woman, you ain't gonna be workin much, 'n she isn't gonna wanna be with you
 & shit.  no woman dig a man who ain' got no job, unless she a lazy bitch
 too.

        'n jorge knew all what shit i was in and he say "yo, dood, you come
 over here man, we get this shit all worked out."  so i hop in my ride and
 cruise over to jorge's and i walk in and his padre is on the couch drinkin'
 margueritas and his life be goin down the drain, you know what'm sayin?
 that ol man just keep gettin older and he ain' doin no thing about that
 shit.  i mean, he jus' sit on dat couch and drink and get all drunk and
 spout bullshit about dumbass things, and he all sad'n shit, but he could
 get up and go out and so somethin.  so what if his ol lady left 'im?  that
 weren't why he started drinkin'.  drinkin' is what he been doin since he
 turn forty, that musta been 5 fuckin' years before his woman left his sorry
 ass.  and if he'd stop that dank ass shit, his life'd turn 'n be all good.

        but he all fucked up by now, i mean, _any_ little thing get to that
 man.  two days ago his TV busted cos he watch the damn thing too much.  'n
 he sit there an' don't believe the shit happen.  'n he's all drunk off his
 ass and starin at his busted TV 'n jorge come upstairs and he says "eh,
 padre, wha's happening?"  'n his father turns his head over to jorge 'n he
 just puke all over the couch 'n he pass out.

        i guess later he took the tv outside and kick a whole through the
 side.  useless drunkass.

        so anyways i walk into jorge's house and his dad's on the couch 'n
 shit and i go downstairs to jorge's room and he's got this chicky down
 there.  and then i look over to my right and there's another chicky.  'n
 he's like "manuel, we be all set for tonight, dood!"  and he hand me a
 corona and i drink and i sit next to my chicky and, man, she was fine, and i
 says "eh, girl, we gotta worry about commitment?"  and she says "shih.
 what's commitment?" and jorge's over there makin it with his chicky so i
 look at my chicky and i grab her breast with my right hand, beer in my left,
 and i leaned over, stuck my tongue hard in her mouth...  man, she was fine.
 and shit.  that was one good as hell night.
