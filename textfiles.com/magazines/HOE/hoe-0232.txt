        It was a friday, just like any other friday.  Thursday came before
 it, and saturday was due to come the next day.  Just like any other friday,
 or so I thought...

        I went to work in a cheery mood, for the weekend was approaching.
 True, I had toiled for 4 days previously, but no matter, I would work
 through the day and be free.  I had plans to go see a concert that night,
 some new band called Shub-Niggarauth's 1000 Dancing Hooves.  I had heard of
 them through a friend of a friend, so to speak, and I was assured that they
 were a band I would like quite a bit. Since the show was only $5 I decided
 it was worth a shot.

        The day dragged on, but I tried to remain in good spirits. It was
 friday, TGIF! By lunchtime, however, I realized that it was no use to
 maintain my good mood, and I stared into space for the entire afternoon.  I
 left the office early, and went to an arcade.

        I played Mortal Kombat XVIII for the next 3 hours.  I always play as
 SuperDimensionalFighterMega Sonya.  She is the best.  Her TitaniumDeadly
 Scissors attack always gets them, even the best. 

        Having spent my rage from the boring day at work I went to Sloppy
 Sam's Food Emporium and had a Sloppy Pork Sandwich for dinner.  It was
 sloppy, and probably didn't do my digestive system any good.  No matter, I
 was psyched, for it was almost time for the concert, but first I would have
 to go home and change.

        When I got home there was a message on my machine.  It said "Go to
 the payphone on 3rd and McGillicutty.  Be there at 8:30pm sharp.  Await a
 call with further instructions. <click>"

        Normally, I probably would have written this off as a crank call, but
 I was strangely intrigued by this message.  After I changed into suitable
 clothes for the concert, I drove over to the payphone.

 8:28:00 Bored
 8:28:15 Curious
 8:28:30 Bored
 8:28:45 Curious
 8:29:00 Bored
 8:29:15 Curious
 8:29:30 Adjust Myself
 8:29:45 Bored
 8:30:00 RING!

        I was rather suprised that the phone actually rang. I picked it up
 and was suprised to hear a mechanical voice asking me to accept a collect
 call, although I didn't understand the name, as it was mumbled. I was in a
 curious mood, so I accepted the charges (I never thought, at the time, that
 accepting charges at a payphone made absolutely no sense.)

        "Can I speak to Arthur?"

        "There is no one here by that name."

        "Oh, so sorry."

        To this day I do not know what that call was about. It made me late
 for the concert though, which was ok, because the band sucked.
