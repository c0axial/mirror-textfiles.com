        "It is childish to study a work of fiction in order to gain
 information about a country or about a social class or about the author,"
 (Nabokov 318) wrote Vladimir Nabokov in his thoughts on his book _Lolita_.
 Studying a work to gain information on a country, however, is exactly the
 task undertaken herein. If one believes Nabokov's assertion that a culture
 cannot be understood merely through its literature, then it must also be
 believed it is coincidental that a socio-literary theme can dominate a
 country's thoughts, actions, and writings.

        The Russian society, of which Nabokov retains membership, has been
 oppressed under one regime after another for the past half century: the
 Tsarist regime followed by the late Communist regime. Throughout all of this
 oppression, one thing in Russia has remained constant: her peoples
 commitment to the hope of a better tomorrow. An old Russian saying is
 "nadezhda umeraet poslednye": hope dies last. Hope pervades Russian
 literature - it must. The depression of day-to-day life in Russian society,
 from serfdom to the current remnants of communism, has presented its
 citizens with such a bleak future that only *hope* can save them. In Russian
 literature, hope acts as the glue holding the words together.

        Alexander Pushkin, the most famous Russian poet, wrote hundreds of
 poems during his life. What follows are two of his untitled poems:

                Should this life sometime deceive you,
                Don't be sad or mad at it!
                On a gloomy day, submit:
                Trust - fair day will come, why grieve you?

                Heart lives in the future, so
                What if gloom pervade the present?
                All is fleeting, all will go;
                What is gone will then be pleasant.

 and:

                I loved you; and I probably still do,
                And for awhile the feeling may remain -
                But let my love no longer trouble you:
                I do not wish to cause you any pain.
                I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew
                The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -
                Made up a love so tender and so true
                As may God grant you to be loved again.

        The preceding two poems serve as perfect examples of the unique
 Russian paradox of despair and hope walking hand in hand. In both poems the
 hope for a better tomorrow greatly overshadows the melancholy overtones.
 Although life is painful now for the narrator, tomorrow death will engulf
 him and although the reader, the "you" of the poem, will feel sorrow for his
 passing, it is better because the narrator is out of pain. The second poem
 treats the reader to a tour of despair - jealousy, shyness, even
 hopelessness. Suddenly, at the end, a ray of light shines through - the
 narrator provides hope for his loved one, even if he is to be unable to love
 her.

        Written in 1869, _War and Peace_ has proven to be an enduring novel
 of epic proportions. Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece tells the tale of Russian
 families caught up in the strife of Napoleon's invasions on Russian soil.
 Although Napoleon's troops are slowly converging on Moscow, the Muscovites
 remain hopeful until the last minute that their city will be saved. Their
 hope provides a source of pride for the Russian people - a refusal to go
 quietly. When the time comes for Napoleon to invade Moscow, the Muscovites
 all leave, humiliating Napoleon and leaving the Russian people with the
 pride that Moscow has not fallen and the hope that it will be retaken.
 Tolstoy writes thus about Moscow's last day: "It was a clear, bright autumn
 morning, a Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for services,
 just as on an ordinary Sunday" (1028). As the main part of the story ends,
 the reader is left with main character Pierre's hope for his future with
 Natasha: "Pierre felt as if he was vanishing, as if neither he nor she
 existed any more, that nothing existed but happiness."

        Happiness and hope are themes encountered again in Nikolai Leskov's
 novella _The Enchanted Wanderer_. Leskov's tale acquaints us with Ivan
 Severyanych Flyagin, a tough man, who discovers early in life that he has
 been promised to God by his mother. Ivan endures the serfdom he was born
 into, until one day he abandons hope and becomes a highwayman. From this
 point, Flyagin's life continues to spiral downward: first he is accused of
 murder, then becomes a slave of the Tartars. All of this happens because
 Flyagin has abandoned his hope. Flyagin continues his descent into decadence
 simply because he cannot regain the hope he has lost. He enters a monastery
 but the same problems confront him again : he is a murderer, a slave, a
 criminal. Flyagin, the Enchanted Wanderer, prays to God to help him - but
 cannot accept God because he cannot find hope. His inability to understand
 the duality of hope and a high power dooms him to a life of death and
 destruction.

        In addition to his fame as a playwright, Anton Chekhov was also the
 author of numerous short stories. One such story is _Easter Eve_. Chekhov
 tells the sad tale of a lonely monk, sad that his friend, a fellow monk and
 composer, has died on Easter eve. As we meet the lonely monk, he is on-duty
 rowing a boat back and forth to take visitors to and from the monastery -
 some sort of modern-day Charon. No one comes to relieve this boatman, and no
 hope is given for the future. Written during the same time period as Leskov
 wrote, Chekhov, Leskov and their contemporaries hint at a depression that
 could not be overcome by hope, as hope could not be found. The only thing
 that could save them would be a revolution changing social, cultural,
 economic, and political boundaries.

        In 1917, the revolution that had been hinted at since the turn of the
 century finally took place. The Bolsheviks, Communists, under Vladimir Lenin
 took control. Lenin's outlook on the future of Russia was a positive one. In
 1902 he wrote _What Is to Be Done?_, a treatise on Bolshevik organization
 and how to positively transfer power in Russia to a Communist state. Lenin
 wrote that "Social-Democracy must change from a party of the social
 revolution into a democratic party of social reforms" (55). Regardless of
 what the Communist Party and Soviet Union became, it is clear that Lenin
 dreamt only of a positive future for Russia and the world and engaged his
 whole life in hoping for a better tomorrow.

        The Soviets were incredibly proud of their accomplishments and
 dreams. It seems that Lenin and the Communists were able to provide the
 Russian people with something they had lost under the Tsar - their hope.
 Under Communism, literature had a bottom line: entertaining the proletariat.

     Mikhail Bulgakov wrote many short stories under the reign of Communism.
 Two of his most famous stories, _The Fateful Eggs_ and _Heart of the Dog_,
 combine the Soviet love for science as well as subtle political criticism of
 the Soviet government. In the former, a Muscovite scientist discovers a
 frequency of light that, when radiated over an object, will cause it to grow
 at exponential rates. At the same time as the scientist developing his ray,
 a plague hits the chicken population of the Soviet Union, killing them all.
 An enterprising young Soviet Army officer decides to use the ray - virtually
 untested - on chicken eggs to replenish the supply. His hope for the future
 is soon shattered when the Soviet government accidentally reverses the
 shipping order - the Army officer gets reptilian eggs while the scientist
 gets chicken eggs. In _Heart of the Dog_, Bulgakov revisits a scientific theme.
 This time two doctors decide to create a man out of a dog. At first their
 experiment goes well, but it soon becomes apparent that one truly cannot
 teach an old dog new tricks, in this case the tricks of humanity. Bulgakov
 wrote with a cynical hope for the future. He and a new school of Soviet
 writers wrote of their distrust and doubts of the Soviet government, masking
 their barbs in a hope for the Soviet future.

        Russian expatriate writer Vladimir Nabokov brings up an interesting
 situation in his novel _Lolita_. In _Lolita_, an older man, Humbert Humbert,
 falls in love with a twelve year old girl, Lolita. The novel depicts his
 trials and tribulations as he goes from a man without an outlet for his love
 to the hope that Lolita will accept him and become his outlet to their love
 and finally ending in Humbert's despair. Humbert always hoped for the best
 for Lolita - from the moment he first saw her until the moment he attempted
 murder to keep her pure in his eyes. Nabokov describes Humbert's delight at
 meeting Lolita as, ". . . the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the
 nurse drunk" (41).

        One author, Nobel prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn, has felt the
 barbs of the Soviet government and wrote about his experiences in the novel
 _One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich_. Solzhenitsyn based his novel on
 his own experiences in a Soviet gulag and, as such, the only hope the
 characters feel is a reprieve by death. In stark contrast to the focus on
 hope in much Russian literature, Solzhenitsyn had a broader agenda. By
 publishing his accounts, Solzhenitsyn placed his hope in the readers
 worldwide to question the Soviet government's actions and to hold it
 accountable for them. Many other Soviet writers followed suit, exposing the
 atrocities of the Stalinist government.

        Stalin's government remains a hot topic in modern-day Russia, even
 after the fall of Communism. In Nikita Mikhalkov's Oscar-winning portrayal
 of life under Stalin, _Burnt by the Sun_, a hero of the Revolution and his
 family come to terms with the brutal realities of the Stalinist era of
 Soviet government.  We are acquainted with the main character, Colonel
 Kotov, as he employs his charisma and prestige to halt the Soviet Army from
 destroying a wheat field near his country home. He does this out of the hope
 of protecting his family, especially his young daughter, and their friends
 for the future. The plot quickly thickens when a mysterious stranger from
 Kotov's wife's past comes for a little more than a social visit. Kotov's
 daughter, young and innocent, never fully comprehends the magnitude of the
 situation the stranger has put her father in. Coincidentally, the real name
 of the actress playing Kotov's daughter is Nadezhda, the Russian word for
 hope. As the stranger takes Kotov to be purged, Kotov tells his family that
 he will return even though he knows his fate is certainly the gulag or even
 death.

        Nadezhda umeraet poslednye. Throughout the modern history of Russian
 literature hope, or the conspicuous lack thereof, has recurred as the
 dominant theme. Without hope a society lives without a discernible future.
 Hope is the future, and, as Russian writers remind us, hope dies last.
