        I just discovered something really cool it is called mp3. it sounds
 just like a Cd but it's not a cd!! They are little files like 4 megs. People
 are always ripping thes mp3's and offering them on l33t channels like
 #mp3files! THEY RULE! I will never had to buy another cd again!! 

        The way I discovered this cool file was by when one of my l33t4ss
 friends send me an msg on irc. he said, "hey have you heard the BARBIE GIRL
 song" and I said "no." So he sends a dcc send and I said, "what the hell is
 this???" and he says "It's an mp3" and I said "What the hell is an mp3?"
 so he told me! (my friend is l33t but he is not an ASSHOLE like a lot of
 l33t p33pl3@#$) Now I am hooked, I have almost as many mp3's as I have
 warez and I have a LOT of WAREZ!!! 

        I am filling up my hard drive right now with mp3's because that way I
 can make kickass mix tapes for girls cause girls like mix tapes. Like right
 now I am getting some Puff Daddy and Sugar Ray and some kickass TECHNO
 stuff! I think I might start a DJ service and I would just bring my Cerwins
 and my Packard Bell!!! That would be SO KICKASS and I would get all the
 chicks and never have to ever buy music, I could just leech all the songs
 and set up Winamp and then go get lots of PUSSY!!#$%^$!

        People are always offering cool stuff in the mp3 channels like people
 will rip whole albums and stuff. and then if you really want to hear the
 whole album you don't have to go BUY it, you just have to site there on a
 modem and d/l the whole thing which kinda sucks but it is sure l33t3r than
 spending $15++ for a cd that you don't know if you'll even like! Cause
 sometimes you buy CDs, like I bought that Janet Jackson CD and it sucked
 ass, but then somebody was offering like the whole album, so I d/led the
 tracks I liked and sold the disc to some dumass who has a locker close to
 me!! Now I don't even have to hit skip on the shitty tracks on my cd player
 I just play the good songs over and over.

        Seomtimes people offer dumb stuff on #mp3files. I don't know who
 would want to waste a download on stuff they havent head of, who the FUCK is
 STABBING WESTWARD anyhow?!! I wish I had ops so I could kick their asses!!!
 But most p33pl3 on the chan are really cool, they rip whole albums and
 stuff. I f I ever get a l33t sh311, I'm going to start my own mp3 curry
 group. Then I could help the SCENE and maybe get some mp3 distroz all the
 time!@ Yesterday I ripped a track from my parent's Saturday Night Fever CD
 and I sent it to my friend as a gift for showing me to mp3's. He loved it
 and he said we should start a group so Ive been looking all over the damn
 place on #shells, but so far I've just been ripped. Some guy told mme he had
 a quotaless t1 and he mae me send Photoshop 4 for it, then he disappeard! I
 WAS SO PISSED!!!! but I'm just gonna keep looking. We've already got a
 kickass name picked out but I'm not gonna tell you whut it is! you'll find
 out when we be 0\``|\|1|\|6 da sc3|\|3 1|\| '98.
