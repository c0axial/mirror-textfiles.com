	In the words of the real estate agent, the apartment is "small, but
 comfortable."  Nybar was indifferent to it; just a temporary base of
 operations.  Once they found the scepter, they could buy a mansion.

        Nybar was peeling an orange with a knife.  Jubjub was seated at the
 kitchen table, next to the waitress (Dawn).  Guy and Keith monitored the
 building's comers and goers.  Keith and Guy tended to talk a lot less (or at
 least less brusquely) around Nybar after seeing him in action.  This suited
 Nybar just fine, but it's never good to have such big egos so paranoid.
 When Nybar, in course of talking to Jubjub, slammed his knife in the table
 as a method of punctuating his speech, they nearly jumped.

        The conversation that caused Nybar to go to this length in his
 gesticulations ran like this:

        "Okay, so we're screwed, the people trying to kill us are in the
 pentagon, they never stop, they never cease, they never desist."  This was
 Jubjub.

        "Shut up, Jubjub.  Everything is under control, alright?  We're
 better off now that we know what we're up against.  It's just that we're
 going to need an army.  Keith and Guy aren't quite enough to take on THE
 MAN."  This, of course, is Nybar.

        "An army?  You crazy motherfucker, what do you want us to do?  Storm
 the Pentagon?"

        "EXACTLY!--" this was the point where Nybar drove his knife into the
 table "--oh, not to hold it or anything.  That would be crazy!  Just until
 we have enough information about who is competing with us for the scepter.
 Oh, and it might also be a good idea to kill whomever that may be."

        "Uh, naturally.  So, to re-iterate, you plan to hire an army--" a
 pause.  Nybar nodded.  Jubjub continued "storm the pentagon--" pause, nod,
 continue: "--and in this way, get information about our competitor and
 possibly kill him, or her... or it, or them.  Right?"  Nybar nodded again,
 and took a bite of his orange.

        "That's ridiculous.  Why not simply beat them at their own game, and
 obtain the scepter before they do?"  Jubjub finished his stream of questions
 with this pontification.  Nybar silently pondered something for a bit, while
 chewing on his orange.  The silence became uncomfortable, and finally
 unbearable.  Finally, Nybar spoke up.

        "Sometimes, Jubjub, you're useless.  You're usually a superb
 calculator, but too much risk and too many calculations shut your brain off.
 Then you go into hibernation.  It is while people like you are in waiting
 mode that the true brilliancies occur; these come from the people willing to
 be a little insane if it brings them to their goals.  Both the unmarked,
 peasant's graves and the tombs of the high and mighty are filled with the
 bodies of these people.  How are we going to beat the United States at a
 game like the one we're playing, the name of which is RESCOURCES?  We need
 to take action, our STRATEGY much be superior.  So you stay here, baby-sit
 Keith and Guy, talk to the waitress, reflect on my words.  I'm going to The
 Amazon Basin to find out about hiring an ARMY.  You can reach me on the new
 cell-phone if anything comes up."

        With that, Nybar abruptly stormed out, absent-mindedly tossing the
 rest of his orange into a trash can on the way out.  Jubjub would later
 learn that he had ordered tickets to the Amazon basin about the same time as
 Mogel first expressed interest in the project.  But at the moment he was
 speechless, though he was constantly expecting outbursts from Nybar.

        "What an asshole, eh?" this is the first question Jubjub had directed
 at Dawn for hours.  She was looking rather haggard, but being kidnapped by
 strange people for no ascertainable purpose does that to people.

        "I guess--" Dawn's gag had long ago been removed, it aesthetically
 offended Nybar to have people who hadn't yet disproved their intelligence
 unable to speak in his home.  Jubjub hadn't argued the point; he knew the
 need for conversation with someone other then Nybar (who tends to be
 intense) might come up, and Keith and Guy certainly didn't fit the bill.  In
 a world where the only person to talk to is the girl you kidnapped...

        "--uh, you seem pretty nice.  Would you mind telling me ... just why
 you kidnapped me?"  Her tone of voice matched up nicely with how haggard she
 looked, and what she'd been through.

        "Because Nybar is egotistical.  When he has a goal, all other humans,
 even me, are just pawns."  Jubjub replied, and let her marinate.  She took
 longer then necessary, because there were still kidnapper - kidnapee
 boundaries to be discovered.

        "Okay, but is there a more specific reason?"

        "Well... I suppose we're going to have to tell you eventually anyway,
 so I might as well tell you the whole story.  This is going to sound pretty
 damn weird, so I'll just spit it out:--" after a barely perceptible glance
 to make sure Keith and Guy were still in the soundproofed monitoring room,
 he continued "okay, one more clarification.  This isn't going to sound
 weird.  It's going to sound REALLY weird.  Here goes:"

        What is the REAL nature of the mess Nybar and Jubjub have gotten
 themselves into?  Read the Next Chapter, COMING SOON!
