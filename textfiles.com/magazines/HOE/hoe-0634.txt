        we've seen zines.  we've all read text files.

        hey.  some of us even write the damned things.

        stories, bitchings, rants.

        diaries.  questions.  raves.

        some are useful.  others, well.  many are pointless.

        Hm.  *sometimes* they're useful.

        what you are about to read is no different.

        if it were any different, the title you had just read would have
 been followed by a gentle voice directing you to the nearest exit.

        Nonono.

        I, your charming driver and tour guide into the wonderful
 disneyland-esque world of wit and sarcasm, am not here to frighten you with
 new and bold ideas, creative notions, or innovative actions.  I'm sure you
 have seen that sort of deal enough to want something.. well, normal.

        if you enjoy this text file then great, but if not, oh well, what's
 a few lost minutes of time in the grand scheme of things, eh?

        Really. If we were all so concerned about deadlines and following
 time and such, we wouldnt be wasting precious time and money reading some
 ineffable pile of zine, now would we?

        No, sir, no, ma'am.

        that is exactly why zines are here.  zines such as this one.  zines
 that pick you up, spin you 'round, give you a big smooch on the cheek, then
 kick you straight in the world again.  Except for this article.

        Hmph.
