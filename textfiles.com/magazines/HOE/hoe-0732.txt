        Men are always confused. 

        Their minds were built on infomation that only fits together well
 within itself.  To become not confused the man must learn to unlearn.  The
 mind structures it self in such a way that its outputs cause good inputs.
 The inquisitive and truth finding functions of the mind are not just a part
 of the mind or a subset of core motifs they are the builders of reality.
 The world within the mind trys to be as complete and minick the world
 outside the mind as possible.

        "I want to do what feels good"

        -All men live a life never knowning the complete or real world. 
        +Don't try to talk of reality without semantics
        -the object exists inside and outside. the object inside is the only
         object that matters.  the object inside is the only one that changes
        +we might as well live in our dreams
        -we do live in our dreams.

        the universe is a reality to be felt.  to feel it you must sacrofice
 truth.  to know the truth you must sacrofice your human desire for it.  a
 simple computer can know the truth of the universe.  it is humanity that
 causes the universe the exist and the object behind the universe.  know that
 you are nothing and that what you call the universe is nothing.  proceed on
 this path and you will find a delightful world of terror.

        do no put so much value on the Yogan.  do not put so much value on
 the Sage.  they are lumps of flesh.  to be pure human, seek nothing and
 breed before you die.  to be clean human know motif and seek method.  to be
 more then human destroy yourself.  become hard on the inside and hard on the
 outside in such a way that you live in constant terror.  to be hard inside
 and outside has the same affects of being soft on the inside and outside.
 this type seeks his magna negro puella.  his witch lover.  she who eats his
 soul in such a way that it is nothing and thus everything.

        "did you hear what happened to timmy!?  he became so insane he
 smashed his head on the floor until he was uncontinous"

 HAHAHAHAHA

        "did you hear what happened to suzie!?  she became so insane she
 smashed her head on the floor until she was uncontinous"

 HAHAHAHAHA
