Hi there. You might be wondering who I am. Well its me! 

You might remember me from my days in BLaH.
You might remember me from my days in MiLK
You DON'T remember me from my days in OBLOIDISM (however Jamesy spelled it)

But, there is a new me now. A different me. And this new me will let you 
in on a little ckrut. I can't write anymore. You know why? Because I 
decided to become an Engineer, and we all know that engineers are 
unarticulate. Well, some fool might be thinking "Hey, you are writing 
now." Well, shut up. 

Ok, lets assume for a minute that you do remember me. Well, in that case, 
I still hate lampreys. However, I no longer have as much control over TV. 
I know this because if I did there wouldn't be any TV anymore. Other than 
that, its the same old me. Except I am improved. I know have a Kung Fu Grip.

Enough about me. What about you? Well who cares about you. You are a 
peon. I am everything you are nothing. Or perhaps it is vice versa. But 
in that case, how would this have been written? I win, end of story.
 
Well that about wraps up this little essay on me. Maybe I will write 
about me again. Or not.
