        hey, what's up.  this is kreid here.  you know, you'd never know it,
 you know, but this t-file that you're reading right now is actually my
 315,601st t-file.  personally, i can't believe it, hell, well, but hell,
 you just keep practicing and your writing skilsl just pick up, you know?
 heheheh well whatever, peace.  ON WITH THE T-FILEE!!!!!

 )--+--[315,601]--+--(

        okay i'm gonna start this shit with a story, okay, like old times,
 right?  eheheh well okay.

 )--+--[315,601]--+--(

        once upon a time there was a boy.

        in front of his computer, this boy sat, wondering.  "what is this
 life really worth?  what is my fate in life?  and what am *I* worth?  can
 a god possibly exist, watching over a world so cold, and so bitter?"

        a bomb went off.  a bomb of thought, inside the boy's mind.  "could
 it be that the universe was created simply by chance?  because if so, then
 logically i could see that a good man's purpose on earth is only to exploit
 chance.  yes, that is it!  for once i realize..."

 *mogel!mogel@dto.net* i want to suck every drop of you down my soft,
                       anxious GULLET.

        and, like millions of other minds that try to erupt into virginal
 thought every day, mogel broke this poor boy's.  mind.  out came the cock
 and on went the love.

        who's to blame?

 )--+--[315,601]--+--(

        kreid here again.  i don't know about you guys, but i personally
 happen to personally think that this t-file fucking ROCKED.  all right
 peace out... AFTER THA SHOUT-oUTSZZZZ!!!
