 Subject: Death Notification

        It is with great sadness that I announce the death of one of
 Gallatin's undergraduate students, Alexander Madara, who passed away
 on Monday, December 14, 1998.  Alex will be remembered as a bright,
 diligent and imaginative student who lit up the Gallatin community
 with his lively personality. Alex's adviser, Barbara Cooper remembers
 Alex as " a real spark  ^Å he was a most intelligent student with
 tremendous potential".  His tragic loss will be most keenly felt by
 all who knew him.

        You are invited to join Alex's family and friends from Gallatin
 and the NYU community at a memorial service to be held at:

 The Catholic Center
 58 Washington Square South  (Corner of Thompson Street)
 3:30 p.m.
 Wednesday, December 16, 1998

        Alexander E. Madara was born on January 18, 1978, in Tulsa,
 Oklahoma, to Eugene and Bernadette Madara.   He graduated from Hopkins
 School in New Haven, Conneticut, in 1996 and entered the Gallatin
 School in the fall of that year.

        Alex was a quintessential Gallatin student.  His high school
 record shows that he excelled in conceptual physics, studio art,
 literature and Spanish while maintaining an active extra-curricular
 schedule in Taekwon Do and a SKA band.  He was also involved with
 literary and artistic publications and community activities, as a
 tutor.  This young man of many interests found a home for his many
 talents in Gallatin.

        Here at Gallatin Alex pursued his interest in philosophy and
 politics while maintaining his involvement with studio art and music.
 He had hopes of going to law school.

        The Gallatin School extends its deepest condolences to Alex's
 family and friend in this time of grief.  Please join us on Wednesday
 to remember Alex and to mourn the untimely passing of one of
 Gallatin's bright sparks.
