        Many males, and females, I know seems to complain about not getting
 sex.  I know they masturbate on a normal, if not daily, basis, due to the
 fact that they are dirty horny fucks.  So, I wonder what the problem is.
 I mean, with sex you have to worry about the other person getting
 satisfied, diseases, pregnancy, etc.  I don't think it's that great.  I
 mean how is a person supposed to perform under such pressure?

        It's amazing the species has survived past the women's movement.
 Before that a guy just clubbed a woman, or the social equivalent of it,
 shagged her rotten.  Now us guys have to go thru a much too complex process
 to even get a kiss goodnite.  This is far too much for the common male.
 When he wants sex it's not a wait-3-months sort of thing... he wants it
 within the next hour, maybe less.

        So masturbation is much quicker and a hell of a lot better than
 trying to find a clean, willing, and available girl.  As for the girls,
 how often do you find a man with the ability to bring you to a great
 orgasm?  I mean, not everyone can be like me, right?  So, it's even mroe
 practical for women!  Well, now that I just ruined every guy who is
 uncoordinated's chance of getting some, they better go masturbate!

        See?  This is all working out just as I told you.  Guys wanna do
 it, women wanna do it, but no body wants to just jump on a random person
 from the street and say "FUCK ME!"  That's why we have opposable thumbs.
 So, get your vasoline ready, and start working your arms.  I say we forget
 sex and have a national masturbation day where we inform people of the
 wonders of masturbation Vs.  sex.  You always get to finish, there's no
 pressure (unless your parents are home), and you don't have to fiddle
 around with contraceptives before hand.  Of course this whole file could
 be negated if everyone in the world liked oral sex, but we all know that
 won't happen anytime soon.  Until then, happy whacking Planet Earth!
