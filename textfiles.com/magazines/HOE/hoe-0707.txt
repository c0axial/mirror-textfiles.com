        hroses are very evil.  but when the sky falls, they will ALL DIEone
 day, as i was walking down the road i met a girl named sally.  sally has
 three heads.  but only one works.  the others just sit there.  she is afraid
 of razors and sharps stuff so she never cuts her hair!  it goes all the way
 to the floor!  one day, she died.  her friend, joe, was yellow!  he was a
 banana.  he has purple hair!  he died too.  the end.
