 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        I know that you love me but how come do I have to stay in the cold
 dark cellar all the time?  I wanna go outside and smell the flowers.  I want
 to go out and watch the clouds reflect off the water.  I want to swim and
 frolic through the woods.  But no!  You keep me locked up down here all the
 time.

        It's so cold down here that I always shiver as my naked body rests
 against the rock walls.  Look my lips are blue and goose bumps cover my
 body.  Why are yo so mean to me?  Don't I do everything you ask for?  I love
 you, you know.  But you never return any of my affections.  Can't you for
 one time in your life show me that you love me back?

        Please let me out.  I promise I won't run.  I promise to be yours
 forever I just want to feel the sun touch my skin one more time.  It has
 been so long you know.  So very long.  I just wanna go out and play with the
 other children you know.  Please, just this one time?

        Down here, I am always by myself.  You hardly come down here anymore.
 I try to imagine other friends but even they just end up leaving me.  I just
 get lonely down here talking to myself.  There are just so many games I can
 play in an empty cellar.

        Look I have become dirty from all this dust down here.  Let me go out
 so I can wash myself.  You always complain about how I look you know.  I
 look a whole lot better clean I think.  Let me go out so I can see my
 reflection in the creek.  Its been so long since I have seen myself.  How
 many years will you keep me down here?

        You always promise me when we play your little games that some day
 you let me outside.  How come you never keep your promises to me?  You
 whisper in my ear that you love me and then you just lock that great big
 door in my face.  I bang against it for hours begging you to let me out.
 But then you are long gone and I give up and collapse in my corner.

        I cry then wondering if you are just playing with my feelings.  I
 wonder how you can do such mean things to me when you are supposed to love
 me.  I always try to come up with excuses for the things you do.  But
 sometimes I can't come up with one and just give up.  I look at these walls
 and make a quick prayer that someday, maybe just for a second I will be set
 free.

        Oh no!  Don't be displeased with me.  I'm sorry that I questioned
 your love.  I'm sorry that I bitch so much about going out.  I won't do it
 anymore. I promise.  Please just don't beat me.  I'll be a good little boy
 and do what you say... Please!
