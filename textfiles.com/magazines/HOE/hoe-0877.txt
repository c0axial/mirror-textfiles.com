 Everything's alright.
 At least for tonite.
 Because you're with me.
 I'm with you.
 And it's plain to see
 Our Love is true.
 
 Nothing should ever
 Keep us apart.
 I may be clever,
 But when it comes to my heart..
 It feels like a hole.
 Because you're not there now.
 Make me whole.
 Be with me, somehow.
 
 I loved you, I loved you.
 I always will.
 What I say is true.
 For you, I'd kill.
 I'd die, I'd fight.
 Just for a kiss good nite.
 
 No obstacle is too much,
 For me to overcome,
 For your love is my crutch,
 It's more intoxicating than Rum.
 It keeps me alive.
 Always and forever
 For you, I will strive.
 
 Be my love.
 Be my life.
 Be my dove.
 Be my wife.
