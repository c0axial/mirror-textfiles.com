        For years, I have been in the habit of, every six months or so,
 looking through all of my old screen captures from IRC and my BBS, and
 enjoying them heartily.  Now, clearly, there is no good reason why no-one
 else should be able to enjoy the incredible fun I get from looking over the
 horrible, horrible things I considered to be enjoyable from 1994 to 1997 or
 something like that.  Thus, I have collected a few of the least possibly
 interesting things from my library of captures for all of you to look at
 and not give a damn about.

 *** Quarex explains to god knows who about his one shitty love experience
 --- in the most whining and lame way possible.  Incidentally, this is the
     girl that Noisebox told me to send to him.

 <Quarex> It was sometime during 8th grade, dunno exactly when (1st half of
          the year, was in Korea 2nd half basically). . I would just wander
          the hallways with no real goal or knowing where the hell I was
          going. .
 <Quarex> and of all the people I saw, none of them stuck out except people
          I knew.  None of them, that is, except.. HER.
 <Quarex> I don't know *WHY* I noticed her. . I didn't find her terribly
          attractive then (her hair was fucked, braces, etc.), and she
          certainly didn't have any outstanding characteristics, but god
          dammit, I ALWAYS saw her, and she stuck in my head.
 <Quarex> When I came back for 9th grade, I would see her in the halls
          again. . then, after 1st semester, I guess one of us changed a
          class or something and I didn't really see her after that.
 <Quarex> I basically totally forgot about her until halfway through 10th
          grade, when casting for SOS.  I probably saw her at the auditions
          but didn't pay attention. . then, when we had our first practice,
          it suddenly hit me. . "hey wait a second, that's HER!"
 <Quarex> and basically, I thought it was pretty funny that she had become
          cool (ie non-preppy) and actually approachable. . then after that,
          I didn't really see her again until this year, and since we
          basically see each other every hour, we kinda ended up getting to
          know each other really quickly, and the rest is basically publicly
          known.

        Yes, publicly known.  Quarex meets girl, Quarex hits on girl, girl
 vomits at the sight of Quarex.

 *** PoToKiTTy explains Murmur's feelings about Barb to Quarex in late '97
 ---

 *PoTo!kallista@dto.net* He thinks Barb's too cold.  Said so himself.
 -> *PoTo* Hmm.  I figured he certainly liked Barb.  I figured they would
           get together, now maybe it will not happen.

        I see that Barb being too cold did not stop them from dating
 forever.

 ___
 *** Now, make no mistake, I do like Hrothgar.  But I just recently found
 --- this old-ass log that proves what a dumb fuck he really can be.

 <Hrothgar> Yer dumb
 <murmur> i'm not the one whose favorite movie is a CARTOON
 <shady^> erik, don't even try :)
 <shady^> wooohoo hahaha
 <murmur> i'm not the one who WEARS SANDALS
 <Hrothgar> Yes, instead you are the one who's favorite music is INDIE ROCK.
            That is all I have to say
 * murmur jabs Hrothgar with the Penguin's umbrella
 <shady^> this coming from mr. MANOWAR
 <murmur> erik, did drew write that for you?
 <shady^> hahaha
 <Hrothgar> No, Murmur.. I do have a brain of my own
 <shady^> "for the glory of GER MA NEEEEEEE"
 <Hrothgar> And Manowar has STYLE.  Indie Rock is just shit
 <murmur> WHY DON'T YOU USE IT??#?      
 <shady^> wow erik, you sure fooled us. :)
 <murmur> erik      
 <murmur> at least drew has listened to it
 <shady^> hahahahaha
 <murmur> you haven't even listened to it to know you don't like it
 <shady^> style hahaha
 * murmur tickles Hrothgar's chin
 <shady^> awww.
 <Hrothgar> And how do you know that I haven't listened to it, Murmur?
 <shady^> erik's insulting us, how cute!
 <murmur> because, erik
 <murmur> because.
 <Hrothgar> RJ.  when you lose 100 pounds, and stop being ugly as fuck, and
            stop being depressed about anything.. then you can make fun of
            me.  Until then, just stop trying.
 <shady^> awwWW!@
 <murmur> that's _brilliant_, erik-poo
 <shady^> you're getting cuter and cuter, erik :)
 <murmur> erik
 <murmur> you look like a failed extra from Full House
 <shady^> when you develop a personality that doesn't come in a can, then
          i'll take you seriously :)

        That is really about it.

        It really is.

        I never said you would enjoy this file.  Now, the story I wrote in
 1992, though (HOE #609), THAT is fucking classic.  Go read that.
