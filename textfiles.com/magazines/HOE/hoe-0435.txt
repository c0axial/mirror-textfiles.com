        ...And it hit too close to home.  I refused to ignore it anymore
 even though it was obviously expected of me.

        "No."

        ...And I can't anymore.  Can't be right, can't be wrong, can't do
 good, can't do bad.  Can't think.  Can't feel.  Can't know.

        "No."

        ...And I don't anymore.  I don't feel.  Completely numb.  My
 stomach churns rapidly at the thought.  But nothing comes of it.  I
 wonder if anything ever did.

        "No."

        ...And I still wonder.  There is a future.  It's not vmeste,
 obviously, but if not s nei, s kem?

        "No."

        ...And I guess time will go on.  And I will lick my wounds and
 return to the battleground that is life.  But I don't want to.  Not this
 early.

        "No."

        ...And I am supposed to be friends.  But it's quite a change.  I
 was a friend to begin with.  But it progressed.  Now I suppose it has
 regressed, although I don't quite feel it.  Deal with it.

        "No."

        ...And I wonder how.  How.  HOW?

        "No."

        ...And maybe there is a yes out there for me.  Just maybe.

        "No."

        ...And sometimes the things you have don't make you happy.  But
 do the things you don't have make you happier?
