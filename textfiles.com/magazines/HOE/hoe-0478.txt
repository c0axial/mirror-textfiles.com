      yesterday was a text file i'll write right now.  or, like, chronicle.
  
      whatever.  words.

      so, ok.  i woke up yesterday morning (which would have been 01/22/99)
 at 4:15a.m.  this happened because i accidentally fell asleep the night
 before (01/21/99) at 9:30p.m.  i missed the last half-hour of WCW Thunder.
 but that's alright.  so the first point is that my sleeping schedule as of
 01/22/99 was really *off*.

      so after waking up at 4:15a.m. and not knowing what to do with myself
 until 9:00a.m. when i was due in for work, i decided to go there early.  i
 arrived at work at 7:45a.m.  since i'm talking about work, i'll have to
 explain what i do there.

      look, i know i'm not all that interesting.  this text file isn't
 about *me*.  it's about the *day*, so you can stop your internal dialogue
 [credit: Bill Hicks].  ok, so my work;

      you know how when you're flipping through magazines you'll come
 across an ad for, say, Sears, and there will be a toll-free number where
 you can order yourself a free catalog?  and when you call, it's a recorded
 message?  "at the tone, please say your first name.  then press the pound
 key."  "at the tone, please say your last name.  then press the..."  etc.
 okay, well, 70% of my job consists of transcribing all of the names of
 those sorts of people that call those things.  so it's first name, last
 name, street address, city, state, zip, business, occupation, phone number.
 over and over.  there are a lot of people out there that want free things.
 that's why they're calling, of course.  so, alright.

      the other 30% of my job is Miscellaneous Debris.  sometimes i go out
 to hotels and fix their voicemail systems or whatever.  sometimes it's
 little things - fix a printer here, move a computer there, find warez for
 my bosses, whatever.  it's a good job.  it's stable.  it sure beats the
 hell out of the gas station i used to work at.

      so on this particular day, which was 01/22/99, the amount of calls
 that came through for free catalogs was amazingly high.  our client had
 started a new advertising campaign, so a lot more people were being
 exposed to the toll-free number.  so i sat there for 10 1/2 hours doing
 *nothing* but data entry.  it was taxing and annoying and exhausting.  but
 i finished everything.  i caught up the entire company.  alright.  so i
 done good.

      i signed out.  "that's it for me, guys.  i'm done for the day.  see
 you on sunday."  my boss nodded and i went out the door.  got in my car.
 started it.  my boss runs out of the office and motions me towards him.  i
 opened my car door and screamed "what?"  he said "i need help moving a
 computer."  i screamed "fuck you" and closed the car door.  he continued
 motioning.  i stormed into the office, moved the computer, and stormed out.
 now i was angry and i was driving, and that's a retarded situation.

      in my anger i decided to get a brand new hard drive for my computer.
 it was the only thing that would drain me and leave me exhausted enough to
 be able to sleep.  so i went to the ATM machine to get out some money.
 next to the ATM machine was a table with cookies and girl scouts sitting
 behind it, all virginal and pure and smug and waiting for a berating.

      you know, it's like.. i don't know - i kept my mouth shut.  they asked
 me if i wanted to buy some cookies and i said no and got my money and drove
 to Best Buy and bought the Western Digital 10.1 gig Enhanced IDE hard drive
 for $199.00 after a $40.00 rebate.  awesome price.  i was glad.  well,
 guilty, really, because i knew i couldn't *technically* afford it.

      but i mean, if i had enough money to buy it, then really i could
 afford it, so i don't even know how to use the word "technically"
 correctly there.

      whatever.  words.

      so i am driving home from Best Buy and i realize that i have run out
 of cigarettes, almost.  so i have to go to the ATM machine again so that i
 can get money for a carton.  so i go to the ATM machine and the girl
 scouts were still there, and they asked me if i wanted cookies again.  and
 this time i couldn't keep my mouth shut, because i was fuming, and i
 yelled at them.

      i told them that by sitting next to an ATM machine selling cookies,
 they force me into being an asshole if i decline a purchase.  that they
 know i have the money.  they watched me get it.  that basically they are
 sitting there making everybody an asshole all night, and that was
 dishonorable and dirty and low.  an asshole conveyor belt right next to an
 ATM machine.  and i realized that here i am at 7:50p.m. on 01/22/99
 standing in an abandoned parking lot fiending for cigarettes and screaming
 at girl scouts.  so i gave it up and walked to my car, smoke shooting out
 of my ears, and went to the pharmacy.  bought the cigarettes.  drove off.

      went to the local pizzeria and bought two pies for my family, because
 i knew they'd probably be hungry.  besides, mother had given me money in
 the morning before work to pick up pizza on the way home.  so really, i
 was just running an errand, not being particularly nice or considerate.

      there was a guy in line in front of me at the pizzeria.  fat wallet
 pushing out of his back pocket.  antenna from a cellphone sticking out of
 his breast pocket.  a cigar poking out of his other breast pocket.  this
 guy managed to fill all of his pockets with things that sucked, and on top
 of that he was telling the staff to "hurry it up, i'm in a rush."  so, you
 know, i'm already on edge here.  i shouted to the staff to take their time
 with *my* order because i had all night.  he fidgeted.  i thought he
 might've done something interesting.  maybe he could've taken a swing at
 me.  maybe spit at me.  maybe a good verbal lashing.  hit me on the head
 with his cellphone.  but all i got out of him was a fidget.

      he probably knew that it'd just get me more annoyed.

      got my pizza and went home, finally.  8:30p.m.  went upstairs to my
 room.  well, my room *is* the upstairs.  i rent out the renovated attic.
 so i went upstairs to my attic and begun the rigorous task of installing a
 new hard drive.

      my goal:  install the new hard drive as the master drive, make my old
 drive the slave drive, and take all of the information from my old one and
 put it on my new one.

      what inhibited my goal;  there is no bay for a second hard drive in
 my computer unless i call NEC directly and order their specially-sized
 rails.

      what happened:  a computer, strewn around and rigged half-assed-like,
 with wires here and there and some knots and two hard drives twisted into
 each other to make it work.  and it did.  i had to trick my computer by
 putting in an extra jumper thing to make it think that it only had 4096
 cylinders or something so that my outdated BIOS could use the 10.1 gigs.
 something like that.  i really don't know exactly what i did.

      result:  14 cigarettes later, one hard drive, the new one, with all
 of the data of my old hard drive on it.

      what counts, i suppose, is that i did it.  i had never installed a
 hard drive before.  i didn't know where to start.  but i did it.  and
 that's fucking cool, and i'm proud of myself.  i'm not hardware oriented at
 all.  at *all*.

      so then it's about 12:30a.m. (01/23/99) and i go online and i'm
 trembling with all of the leftover tension and anger from the day and i'm
 guzzling vodka trying to subdue myself and i stumble across Pezmonkey's
 page via the h0e staff page and i read "subtext."  i don't know if she ever
 released it in an e'zine or whatever, but it's exceptionally good and i
 urge you all to go read it.  it relaxed me a good deal and i was able to
 sleep without tossing and turning, which is actually the reason i had
 bought the hard drive, remember?  to, like, export my negative energy.  but
 it didn't work out that way.  you can't buy happiness, as a trillion people
 i will not credit have said.  but we still try.  because we've been trained
 all these years into this process of thinking that the only way you *get*
 things is by handing over cash.  but i dunno.

      whatever.  words.

      i guess that's all, then.  go read "subtext."
