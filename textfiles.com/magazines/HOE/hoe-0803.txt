        I feel like ass today.  I am sure look like ass too.

        It's 1:41 pm.  Do you know where your clean socks are?

        I am listening to happy hardcore, yet it is not making me very happy.
        
        My sister just woke up.  She has bright yellow hair today.  I wonder
 when she did that.  Anyhow, that doesn't make me very happy either.  I'm
 sure it won't make mom very happy either.

        It's very sunny out today.  I wish I were dead.

        I hate Ohio a lot.  Ohio is the shithole of the planet.  I have no
 idea why my mother chose to live here of all places.

        I broke up with my boyfriend today.  I think he is an asshole.  He
 said he cares about me but everytime he sees his ex, he thinks about how
 much he still cares for her.  I think he is still fucking her.

        I wish I had some sleeping pills.  I haven't slept in two days.  I
 tripped two nights ago and last night I rolled.  I think the pill was cut
 with heroin because it was really smacky.

        I just realized that most of my sister's face is metal.  She has a
 septum ring, a labre piercing, a lip piercing, her eyebrow pierced, her
 tongue pierced, and braces.  I sometimes feel like she is the older one
 though I am three years older than her.

        I also just realized that I am going nowhere with this.
