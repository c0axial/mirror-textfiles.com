 Yeah, hah, hah, real "fun". 

 I waited for _SLIPPAGE_ to be released since like 1934, (well, 1994).
 Real "fun", wading through an author's lies about release dates and his
 idiotic justifications being remouthed through fans.

 Hah hah ah!

 It's so fun!

 Ever since his marriage to Susan, his output has dropped quite a bit...
 Now that he is finally happy, he seems to have lost inspiration for new
 material...

 Most of his stories were semi-autobiographical where he'd disguse
 himself as a lonely, bitter man afraid of getting lost in the shuffle...

 Who knows how long his legacy will live on....
 Other than the "Glass Teat" there really isn't much of his work to
 discuss... Everytime a story of his is brought up, it's followed by "I
 loved that story" or "Great story" and that would be the end of it...
 To say you hate a story, brings about the "Then why are you reading this
 newsgroup?" messages....

 BTW, what do you people read when you're not reading Ellison?  I took an
 Ellison break the last few months where I tried to catch up on the works
 of Thomas Ligotti, Paul Auster, and James P. Blaylock...

 Ah, whatever. 

 Honestly, Susan *is* responsible for Ellison's decline as a writer. She's
 also responsible for him keeping it together as a human being. As,
 however, none of us are honestly concerned with Ellison the HUMAN BEING
 (with several notable exceptions, Lawrence Watt-Evans, perhaps? certainyl
 not D.J.L.), it's a valid point to be made she has done more harm than
 good. 

 What young master Ellison has fallen into is the trap that all
 relationships serve up: complacency. People in relationships get
 complacent and lazy and don't do anything to rock the boat, for fear it
 will disrupt their current status of actual (perceived) happiness. 

 > As for how original Harlan's work has been, you might liken him to jazz

 "Christopher Colombo", "Scarlatis", and "Anywhere but here" are the only
 things in _Slippage_ which are up against Ellison's best work. The rest
 is absolutely terrible or just rehashes of stories we've already seen a
 thousand times, said in much firmer voices. "Jane Doe #1354125" is a
 good example. 

 _Mefisto In Onyx_ is a depressing piece of work because it *should* be
 so good, but just comes off as a horrible rendering of where Ellison's
 mind really is: trapped in the seventies. Who the fuck thinks about race
 relations like that anymore? 

 ---

 And to satisfy the circle-jerk: C.G. Jung, Robert E. Howard and related
 fandom, Thomas Ligotti, Antonin Artaud, J.K. Huysmans, Edgar Poe,
 Falkner, Algernon Blackwood, etc. etc. 

 Stuff no one cares about.

 Bullshit.

 And you're lucky you're not in the same room with me or you'd be picking
 up your teeth off the floor and carrying them home in your pocket.  

 I've known Harlan for 30 years, and I knew Susan two years before she met
 Harlan.  I love them both dearly.  Susan is a talented and intelligent
 woman, and she has given Harlan what he most needs in this world.  She
 has also made it possible for Harlan to continue growing and exploring
 his own humanity.

 The record of Harlan's work is a self-documented journey of personal
 growth and commitment that is humbling.  The only other man I ever knew
 so committed to continuing his own education was Robert A. Heinlein.
 That anyone judges either Harlan or Susan simply by the output of
 Harlan's typewriter is such a  narrow-minded vision that it's
 mind-boggling.

 The job of the writer is to report back.  But first he has to go to the
 other side of the hill and take a good look around so he has something
 to report back.  Harlan is being true to the one person he most needs to
 be true to -- himself.

 From:  Harlan Ellison
 Via:  David Gerrold
 To:  Those who have posted at this site for the past several days.
    
 My good friend David Gerrold has responded to my request for a download
 of what you-all have been saying these last few moons, by kindly sending
 along everything since Mr, Kobek's comments on the 7th of this month. I
 should hasten to note that even though I choose not to own or use
 equipment that would provide unending access to your venue every once in
 a while some "concerned" observer will disturb my decades-long slumber
 (if Mr, Robert Whelan's estimation of my career is to be taken as
 accurate) and launch a gardyloo that ticks my curiosity, so that I break
 my own rule about staying out of earshot of internet opinions.
    
 Oddly, I'm a lot less than bothered by the less-than-flattering entries,
 I have a belief that that is exactly why the web exists, to provide a
 place for those who cannot create art to piss and moan about those of us
 who break our asses in a lifelong attempt to do the job properly. Even
 Mr. Kobek, who doesn't think I'm worth very much on the market these
 days, who thinks--like most children his age-that only They have the
 Wisdom that has fled the rest of us, even he seems to read my work. Don't
 know why, but I'm am always grateful for such crumbs of attention from
 The FX Generation.
    
 As always, I get to evaluate my own worth as an artist and as a human
 being, by those who are prepared to call themselves my friends. Lawrence
 Watt-Evans, Bob Morales, David, these are exemplary fellows...and
 Mr. Kobek, though graciousness in clearly not a tongue you speak, you
 really ought to refrain from calling those who know me better, and
 who--unlike you--know what they're talking about, my "tools." Anyone who
 knows these three guys or knows me even casually, knows that I despise
 sycophancy, have friends who'll tell me what a loud, obnoxious, imbecile
 adolescent I an (without bidding, and on a moment's  notice),) and knows
 that they are very much Their Own Men.  They don't toady for me, they
 just share my annoyance at banjo players who had a big breakfast.  Oh, I
 forgot, you're only eleven years old, and won't catch that allusion.  It
 means:  a know-nothing who likes to shoot his yap off. (See, you were
 wrongs Susan hasn't mellowed me all that much.)
    
 But let's got to some conversation of substance, shall we?
    
 Mr. Kobek and Mr. Farber and Mr. Davies seem utterly bout out of shape
 because SLIPPAGE came out in March of 1997, instead of 1991 when it was
 first idly mentioned as forthcoming.  Apart from the ludicrousness of
 their paranoid reasoning as to why it wasn't right there when the stamped
 their widdle foots  for a fix, let me illuminate the ignorance and
 naivete of their insulting  assumptions. The truth will be vastly less
 filled with areas for them to bitch  about, but it will reveal to all the
 rest of you the perils pursuant to mistaking the cawing of carrion birds
 for the sweet song of the nightingale.
    
 In 1991 I signed a contract with a small press publisher to do a limited
 edition of my next collection, SLIPPAGE. The trade edition was under
 contract  to Houghton Mifflin--the last of a 3-book deal--it was
 untitled by HM, but  SLIPPAGE would have been that book.  The book was
 intended for, probably, 1992 release.  But a number of things
 sidetracked no.  MIND FIELDS, which required my attention; a rather
 unpleasant earthquake that cost me about a year of digging out from
 under; a number of shattering deaths of my friends, including Bob Bloch
 and Isaac Asimov and Roger Zelazny and...well, lots more;  spinal surgery
 an Susan;  the depredations of a quartet of scumbags and their running
 dogs that required endless hours of wasted effort in attempts to prevent
 them from driving me either out of the game entirely, or out of my mind,
 which depredations merely resulted in my having (What do they call it?)
 a "coronary episode" and a quadruple heart bypass, procedure.  All this
 and much more, rather, uh, slowed me down.  Sorry if that inconvenienced
 you, fellahs, but if you were ts upset at my tardiness, all you had to do
 was ask for your money back...if in fact, you'd laid out any in advance,
 or were you just grousing without having anything at stake?
    
 The book wouldn't have come out in 1992, anyhow.  (Sorry that the one
 lone mention of it in a "forthcoming" column made you so deranged.
 Clearly, the printed word Is not salutary to your health.  I urge you to
 stay here, on this electronic playground.)  The stories I wanted to go
 into the book were simply taking me more time to write than I'd
 ancipated.  The entries at this site that pointed out I'm always
 struggling to innovate, they had it right.  I work hard at what I do and
 sometimes art, even Art, refuses to obey arbitrary deadlines. But by
 1994, the small-press publisher was in financial troubles and he couldn't
 do the book, so I returned his money, and took my time finishing
 SLIPPAGE. At my own pace.  Not Mr. Kobek's.  Not Mr. Whelan's.
    
 But, even so--and here's where your lack of Information makes you look
 a trifle foolish for your blustery accusations that I'm a big fat
 liar--in the 24 July 1995 issue of Publishers Weekly, the bible of the
 publishing world, on page 68 there was printed, all the world--and even
 you--to see, the following notice:
    
          ATTENTION BOOKSELLERS: Harlan Ellison's new
          collections, Slippage, originally scheduled
          for publication in August 1995, has been
          temporarily postponed to accomodate the
          addition of newly written, previously
          uncollected stories. The expanded table
          of contents will bring the new collection 
          to more than 100,000 words. Look for announcement
          of the new publication date in Upcoming Houghton
          Mifflin catalogues.
    
 Then I finished the book. And by that time the limited edition had been
 resigned this time with Ziesing.  By contract, I guaranteed Mark Ziesing
 six months clear time to sell his limited, boxed and signed edition
 before publication  of a trade or book club edition that might interfere
 with his exclusivity.
    
 The book was scheduled to Ship in November of 1996, in time for
 Christmas. It came out in March, after Christmas.  
    
 Now, let's take the gloves off, guys.  I'm fed to the eyeballs with the
 horse faces you clowns cointinue to drop, all of which redound to my
 sloth, ineptitude, inconstancy, laggardliness, and  just all-around
 inconvenience to your Noble Selves.  As if I really give a shit that you
 had to wait three months for a book as good, and as well-made as
 SLIPPAGE.  But, in truth, the short and simple of it was this: Mark
 Ziesing tried a new typesetter on the books and she was an amateur and
 she screwed it up royally, and I wouldn't let it pass, and we started
 back at square one with the eminent John Snowden of Victoria Magnetics
 in Atlanta.  Square one, you pinhead Whelan.  We (meaning the designers,
 Arnie Fenner, and my assistant, and my wife) had to reproof over 100,000
 words of copy in three weeks.  Just so insulting pukes like you wouldn't
 be able to piss and moan about "typos."  We all worked our butts off, and
 the book came out three months late.  Not eight years late, from that
 idle mention in 1991, but three months.
    
 That's it.  Three lousy months.  Still feel as though you're been
 hideously Imposed upon?
    
 Let me be absolutely candid.  I write for me.  I write at my pace and I
 do the best I can every time out.  But I owe people like you, Mr. Davies,
 and Mr. Whelan, and Mr, Farber, absolutely nothing but my best work.  And
 if that isn't good enough for you, I urge you to stop reading my work
 just so you can beat your meat about how old and weary and complacent and
 out of date and empty I am.  Go read someone better. There are lots of
 them, and I'm sure they'd love to hear your excruciatingly insightful
 analyses of their uselessness.
    
 To Warchild and Paul Riddell and Michael Benedetti and Karen Williams and
 Mark E. Smith and the several other of you whose sane responses put you
 in line to be called "tool" by such bad-mannered adolescents, my thanks.
 My thanks not for necessarily thinking I beat Shakespeare, or even Donald
 Westlake, at the craft, but thank you for your reasoned and sane replies.
 If you get real addresses to David Gerrold I'll send you each a signed
 copy of my next-finished story.  Not much of a gift, but something real,
 nonetheless.
