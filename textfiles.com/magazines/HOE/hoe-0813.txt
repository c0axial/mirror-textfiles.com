        Oh, heavens! thought Mr. Orange Gleason as he awoke to the clock's
 face reading 10:00am.  Sunlight streamed though his bedroom window.  He
 rolled out of bed, stood up and streached.

        He smiled.  It was a Saturday and he didn't want to be late.

        Mr. Gleason enjoyed his days off from work.  Although he worked hard
 and was repected, he stil considered it hard.  What made it bareable from
 him was the county fair that occured every summer.

        As a young boy, Mr. Gleason loved to ride all of the wild rides, to
 eat all of the greasy junk food and to have fun with his friends.
    
        His hands twisted the shower faucet and soon he was engulfed in a
 good, hot shower.  The steam bilowed up and filled the bathroom.

        As he grew older much remained the same at the fair, but added to
 that was his interest in the young ladies that ran some of the booths.
 Sometimes taking notice of a particular cute attendant and play the game at
 her booth.  Although he was a bit clumsy, he would often be charming enough
 to get a phone number and maybe a date.

        He dragged razor across his face careful not to cut himself.  Slowly,
 he removed the last day's growth from his face.

        After washing off the razor, he moved to his toothbrush and tooth
 paste.

        Once, during a summer back from college, he was attracted to a
 brunette at the basketball booth.  It was a slow day and not many were
 playing the games.

        As a pure surprise, the brunette took him behind the stands during a
 break.

        Now, casually dressed, Mr. Gleason sat in his car.  He raised the
 keys into the ignition and started the car.

        He looked into the mirror and thought to himself, today is going to
 be just like old times.
