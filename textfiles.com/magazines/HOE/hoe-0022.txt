        What the hell is this?  It's Hoetry that I have written over the past 
year.  Most of it was handy, all typed up, so now it's here.  But, it's not 
JUST poetry.  It's MOGEL-Hoetry.  That means it must all be read in an 
extremly sarcastic and whiney vain, because that's, in fact, how it was 
written.  Ah, just enjoy it.  [Note: You may have seen these poems leaked 
out in other quality things, for example Logik's "image" writing group]:

We're confused.
'cause the peace lover throws the brick,
'cause they prot and poke him with a stick,
'cause the killer commits a rescue,
'cause he doesn't think he's too evil,

My father grew up that night.
It didn't help him in that fight.
I rammed a Stake up that bastard's heart.
Took care of that old fart.
My life is so full of butter fingers,
I slipped and dropped a few thingers.

We're confused.
'cause the white hood wants to beat up a flower,
'cause he never says "people power."
'cause the lover is convicted of suicide.
'cause she loved god.
'cause that's something she can't hide.

My mother made us know it.
She told me I was full of shit.
and my past world is just the blink of a blink.
Stop and starting memories make it hard to think.
When do I get my pat on the head?
When do I get those "sweet" thoughts, what you said?
Look at Directions.
See imperfections.

        "writer's shock"
i wanna stop sometimes and think to myself
i can never think to far ahead
take a bottle from off my shelf
just lay here in my bed.
wish i had someone to tell,
tell 'em "oh i'm so tired!"
i wanna take a deep breath for attention,
and yell "FIRE!!! FiIIIRREEE!!! FIIIiiiRRREEE!!!"
then i'd roll over and whisper, oh,
oh, "i'm so bored."
and i'd see my eyes go flicker,
and hit the wall i'm leanin' towad.
roll back around and whisper,
"gimmie a pen....gimmie some paper..."
hurry, with out it the trip might fall, 
i can write that he swoops down to take her,
i can write....want i want then...
i can erase it with just one swipe,
goin' bye with the pen.
stabbin in with the pen.
cluthing ends with the pen.
dripping blood with the pen.  
soaking sheets with the pen.
crying with the pen.
again and again with the pen....

i take a trip upon my sinkin' ship
it stays to-get-her with a little glue
i go where i wanna
i do what i wanna
i don't know civilization
i don't know civilization
and i kill 'cause morality ain't sound important
i went to the seashore 
and picked up a few rocks
and they was dirty 
and i filled my socks
and i brought 'em back aboard and cleaned 'em
and i brought 'em back aboard and cleaned 'em
they reminded me of this girl on an island
but she was more better then them rocks
i don't care she ain't here with me now
i don't care she ain't here with me now
it's all here with these rocks
stoned stones of 
my minded mind will
unite the rock's rocky unity.
i don't care i ain't here anymore
i don't care i am where i wanna be
i do what i want, so you can shut up
i'll sail my ship right past you
right past your island
right past you
i may throw these rocks out
they begining to smell like you
sail away in my
pretty
sinking
ship.
i hope on my way.
i don't trip.

stare 
at the corner
it tells me
it tells me who i am
three devils crossing
not to me - when oh when
stare at the corner
i will wait
i will wait for a sign
i see her bloody face there
it's her futile crime
I'll
stare at the corner
until it
until it makes it's move
it creeps on me fast
and
i got nothing to lose
if i just stop.
stare at the corner
he will see
he will see inside stuffings
he rips it all open
we knew he'd just see NOTHING
NOTHING
NOTHING!
NOTHING!!!!!
NOOOOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
but the corner.

oh.  art appreciation.
Hey look there's a tree!
i'm cold and thoughts broken up.
did she turn a faint smile to me?
hey please please talk about,
about the relavence to goat cheese.
yeah, she's got a pretty face,
and i guess that's enough to see.
why should I go any deeper
when it's that way with her?
and i'd cry like a baby
if my sould would be free
and i'd shoot myself dead
if it could pay any fee
and it doesn't matter anyway
it all ends up as a good story
beneath my cold cranium station
is all my randomality
when i find it i'l be free

Let me capture you in my net,
in my memory i won't forget.
Just don't RIP it...
I want it all
not sixteen bits
oh now just sow it up
and hurry
my precious chips...
What's wrong, can't you moniter?
Just how much I wanted her..
To file the way I strive
hard
it's just my drive
and i think i've made my print so soft
when it gets close then i'm off.

I got the Sydney Comlex.
Burn myself with a hot boomerang,
go dancing with my orangatang,
Carton must me clappin' away,
Carton must be turing in heis grave,
The need to sleep in me is deep,
I wanta be an angel,
I wanta be the creep,
and only I can turn the key,
yang and ying turn inside of me,
and why do I have such a common name?
Could we all be one in the game.
Carton must have something to save,
Carton must have gave all he gave,
I like telling people that nothings wrong.
I love you so much I've lost all feeling.
I'm gonna die.
Wait, forget that I said that, yeah it's a lie.
Think I'll go read a book,
learn more about being misundertook.

I'm a sarcastic bastard and I don't give a rat's ass about you.
I'm an obnoxious jerk and I LIKE acting like I got no clue.
I'm a sarcastic bastard and I stuffed that flower you loved...
I stuffed it it under my shoe.
I don't care.  
No, I don't care about you.
I could read the whole newspaper and use it as a pooper scooper...
I'd still never know who.
I'm a sarcastic bastard I need not say anything cool...
I can rule.
I'm a pathetic loser, but I can call you...
Yeah, I can call you a fool...
and drool.
I'm a wonderful idiot and I love it.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
Your body would be a cool lab experiment..
I love you lips,
pretty lips,
I long to kiss,
pretty lips,
I wish I could open your mouth real wide,
I'd see your heart and I'd step inside.
Fall down your warn throat,
Swin around your bloody moat,
I take a trip through your voice,
I take a spin anywhere,
your choice,
I like to stare at you from the outside,
l'd love to live with you in the inside,
or maybe somewhere inbetween...where it's clean.
Your smile - it spits me out.
I love it when you pout.
Angery your eyes are watery,
Happy?  It's like the lottery.
It'd be a great escape when I'm a detected alien,
I fall right out again and again,
I don't care if the blood cycle will suck,
it's this kind of life I choose.  oh fuck.
I like to stare at you from the outside,
l'd love to live with you in the inside,
or maybe somewhere inbetween...where it's clean!
I love your innards.

i've grown numb to the sound of my own laugh
it's a slow ryhtmic chating beat
like a night train
Nothing begins to mean everything
and I forget everything until there's nothing.

"It's all the way you see things," he said.
Thoughts running oh-so sternly through his mind.
He needs a few dollars to eat,
Picks up his axe and prepares to grind.
Came from America, the land of the free,
and all that sacred bullshit.  He takes a pea.
Round the bend, near the giant tree,
worshipped by some, needed to breath,
he prepares to cut,
to be what he be.
Raised, poised, and ready for the slicing,
his childeren's limbs he begins slicing and dicing.

I'm ugly.  I see my face everyday.
I'm ugly.  I have a retared face.
I'm ugly.  Got a big nose too.
I'm ugly.  My hair isn't cool.
I'm ugly.  Some boys are "cute" boys.
I'm ugly.  I'm not some boys.
I'm ugly.  I'm learning to block my face out.
I'm ugly.  Everyone is obsessed with beauty.
I'm ugly.  Seems like I am too.  It's ironic since...
I'm ugly.  Why wasn't *I* born as a cute boy?
I'm ugly.  Will I ever have a relationship I like?
I'm ugly.  So I guess not.
I'm ugly.  It's begining to spill into my insides.
I'm ugly.  My life is becoming ugly.
I'm ugly.  My emotions, mind, relationships, happiness...
I'm ugly.  I hope it changes.
I'm ugly.  If I tell myself I'm not ugly it doesn't help.
I'm ugly.  Theory and practice are very different.
I'm ugly.  Obsessed with the outside seems okay today.
I'm ugly.  It's ashame.
I'm ugly.  In the game.
I'm ugly.  Everyday.
I'm ugly.  In every way.

        "North Philly"
I wassssss walkin' in my linear duplex city,
wrapped in my face cloud,
I didn't notice the grapphitte on my heart,
just starin' at these tiny-tiny homes,
We gather together in these little RAT holes,
We crawl
into little bunches
so close together
can't breath
thin walls seperate
living beings
decay
so close
so close
together
And then my foor rrrrrrrrips on down the street
burst of energy
I run.
On through a crowd of zombies,
walking into each other,
eyes wide,
surprise,
and I push on by,
and I jab one to my left,
gotta get through,
OUT,
run run run past the dwellers,
the demons,
crawling and biting and scratching,
I escape and head into a field of nights color, 
and I dive into it as it swollows me,
but it doesn't end there,
the streaks of blue whizz by,
and it's a picture-still pocket world of my own, 
where I can run forever...

Why the HELL are you pretending --
it's not all about SEX!?
"It's always on everyone's mind." someone said.
I don't think this is true,
But strangely I'm not sure,
is it in the back of all my thoughts?
Do I think about it when I eat spam?
I don't think this is true,
but it's there!
I care about the soul.
I look for the mind first.
I want it.
Don't want to!
I hate it.
Don't taunt you!
I kiss you.
Don't flaunt that!
I feel it.
Don't feel it!
I fuck it.
I love you!

                 You are now entering Mogel's epic poem,
                this tasty treat bakes in only 2 minutes.
                  I call the recipe "Cyber-Soul" and it
                  comes out best with thourgh mixing and 
                  being read with a REALLY whiney voice.


        I GOT A CYBER SOUL!
                Electiricity under my skin
                                I plug myself in
                                        I can't begin
                                to explain
                        my modem pain!
        Yeah, my girlfriend's in another state,
                Networked messages never wait,
        I know her password is CYBERSUCK,
                It's hard for us to modem FUCK,
        The data collected is never quite right,
                No connection handshake,
                        connection fight!
                They battle eachother on /<-/<001 WaRz 
        I've found her weakness,
                She's found my source,
                        If the kewl-world is not ELITE,
                                You know I just can't compete!
                        I wanna know it all just right!
                        I wanna know it all tonight!
                        I wanna know it all & how,
                        I wanna know it all RIGHT NOW!!!
                Don't let where I am
                        be where it's not
                I can make my own group
                        I'll call it "cyber-pot"
                Bury the corse or it will rot.
                                Electricty in my Body!
                                Is this just a hobby?
                        Do I have a line
                        Where it stops or starts?
                                or do I have a 14.4k heart?
                I make love to my disk drive,
                        cause I'm the only one that knows she's alive!
                Don't you get what my Cyber-God said?
                        I gotta call that board,
                                or I'm DEAD.
                I'll rot in lamer hell until I get planted,
                and all my WaReZ know-how will be slanted,
                The bytes of grass will grow over my skin,
                I'll have to mo' dem up,
                                But where to begin?
                Gotta think deep about my Cyber-Soul,
                        Gotta take control,
                Configure my brain's autoexec bat,
                        I'll save this and I'll delete that!
                Kick out the /<-RaDdY-RaD d00d WaReZ!
                        Fuck the fuck, I don't KaReZ!
                Electricity is in my Cyber-Soul,
                        and now I got a Cyber-Goal,
                Be a t-file wizardry poet?
                        YES I DID FUCKING KNOW IT!
                Remember who I am,
                        I'm a drifter,
                                an intelligent thinker,
                                (not a gNu stinker)
                        Did I ever think about what I did with my 'puter?

                Dear God,

                Just wanted to mention it.
        Some idiots think I'm looney.
                But I'm the next Jesus!
        You know, your virgin son!
                When you and Mary got it together.
        The miracles I proform aren't God given.
                That's right! The miracles I proform aren't yours!
        I'm the next Jesus FUCKING Christ.
                I'm a superstar...
        The media loves me.
                I get laid all the time.
        I'm the Jesus for the 90s!
                Cursings fucking fine.
                                Free sex is fine.
                                        It's cool to steal.
                        Let's MURDER thy neighbor's wife!
        Rememeber when I rose from the dead?               
                That was nothing.
        The Jews ARE going to accept me this time.
                Everyone will.
        I'm the universal savior!
                I'll have my own bible passages soon!
        I'm the next JESUS CHRIST!
                So you better love me...
                                        ....or....
                                                Burn in Hell.

I run a mental ward for the politicians.
They can't make thier own decisions.
I feed them well...take them many provisions.
Walk them to the bathroom.
Put the food in thier mouths.
Walk them to the television.
Tuck them into bed...

I run a mental ward for GOD.
SHE fits in like a pea in the pod.
If anyone annoys her they can "suck her rod."
Take her for a little walk...
Kiss her ass!
Take her all her prozac,
and tuck her into bed...

I run a mental ward for myself ALONE.
My insanity, yeah, I can clone.
Oh great, it's the pharamacy on the phone.
Walk myself to my cell.
Talk to god in hell.
Soil myself with no bed pan.
We all hold hands here....it's the plan.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
You.
You're shit for brains.
SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! FUCK!
SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! FUCK! FUCK!!
        I don't want to curse.
        or maybe I don't care.
        I take pride in not shutting up.
        I'll never curse I swear!
SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! FUCK!
SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! FUCK! FUCK!!
        Assholes like me, yeah, we never quit.
        Drivin' through the fucking shit.
        I won't curse I swear!
        or maybe I don't care.
                        Darn! POOP! Oh-no! dag! Oops! <pause>
SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! FUCK!
SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! FUCK! FUCK!!
        No, I'm not a dick,
        I'm not a motherfucking prick,
        I'll never curse I SWEAR!!
        Or maybe I just don't fucking care!

I'm transfixed early in the morning.
I don't want to tell you...you're really boring.
I'll just lay her...mind dead.
Don't even have the stregth now to turn my head.
Can't close my eyes, either... I just stare....
I don't have the strength this morning,
you know, honey, I'm snorin'.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
I was so sorry, but then I didn't even care.
I remember the twinkle of hope I had.
It was like a shimmering sunrise.
It made me smile and tell great jokes.
I could talk honestly with my friend and folks.
I'd sing the day away with joy.
That was until I learned life was a toy.
I threw around match sticks and fluid.
It didn't do much till I learn how to do it.
I woke up the next morning covered in ashes.
and they forgot that I had extra stashes.
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
The claming hum of the computer.
The whirling fan puts me to sleep.
A modem connection is music to my ears.
It's the bringer of fears
        fears of being alone
                alone in my home
                        the home in my mind
                                I'm falling behind
                                        behind in my work
                                                of being a jerk!
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
If I remembered all the pain
If I remembered all the shame
If I remembered all the anger and rage
If I remembered all the wars I've waged
If I remembered all the gringing teeth
If I remembered all the tension beneath
If I remembered all the stupind asses
If I remembered all the ignorant masses
        would I go insane?

                        My Penis Unbound
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Yeah, my penis is unbound.
                It rumbles without a sound.
        It's inadvertatly large.
                It's a sexually active barge!
        Yeah, my penis has no roof.
                It scrapes against her tooth.
        It's always oh-so big.
                Flip it up and take a swig!
        Yeah, my penis has no limit.
                It's left overs - you can swim it!
        It's taking over the world.
                It's rapured every girl!
        Yeah, MY penis is the best.
                Seven up above the rest.
        It's over-compilcatedly deep.
                I'm a huge penis creep.
        It's my ever-present obsession.
                I'll fuck them all in heaven.
        Cause my PENIS IS UNBOUND.
                It rocks and shakes the ground.
