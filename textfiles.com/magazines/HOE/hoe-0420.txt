        This was a piece written on 5-14-96.  It is a true story.
 Pay attention to the names of the characters so the story makes sense.

 !!========================================================================!!

        Love had a happy life, as did Want.

        One day Love and Want met and became instant friends.  Soon after
 this, they met a boy on seperate occassions and were both attracted to
 him.  Love could love this boy so much, but that's not what he wanted.
 Want claimed that she could love him, but she never could because she
 was Want.  We are what we are, not what we want.

        Soon the phase of this boy passed and moved away to make room for
 yet another to come to Wants attention.  

        Love and Want got to know this new boy as well as he would let
 them.  Love truly cared for this new boy with all her heart.  Want
 merely tried to gain his attention.  Want is not capable of Love, for we
 are what we are, not what we want.

        This new boy had a very close friend, they were almost brothers.
 Love cared for the brother as well as the new boy, for they all were of
 the same clan.  Love and the new boy became close, and she had a short,
 strange obsession with the brother.  Soon it was over, though everyone
 thought it was still going on.  Not that it mattered.  One day, Want
 decided that she wanted the new boy this time.  Want sat back for a
 while and watched Love and the new boy become closer.  Want soon got
 jealous of Love because she wasn't capable of it. 

        Want, still thinking that Love obssessed over the brother, tried
 to get close to the brother.  Want tried to make Love jealous.  Love
 recognized this weak attempt for an attack, but dismissed it as childish
 and freshman.  Love continued to grow closer to the new boy.  Soon she
 got intimidated by this new boy because he hid his feelings so well.  But
 Love kept trying and prying into his heart.  Meanwhile, Want kept showing
 a public show of affection for the brother to spite Love.  The more Want
 did this, the more Love was driven closer to this new boy.

        One day, Love got so tired of Wants incessant acting.  To get back
 at her, Love gave everything she had in herself.  In doing this, she won
 the heart of this new boy and all those around her.  Want could never win
 the brother or this new boy, for she was not capable of Love.  The
 jealousy Want felt for Love drove her to change her name to Spite.
 
                     We are what we are, 
                     not what we want.
                     Don't spite those who
                     have more.
