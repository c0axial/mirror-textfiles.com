        The game Magic: The Gathering boasts "all you need is a friend and
 a deck".  The deck is easier for most players to come by.  Rioting is
 like  Magic, because all it requires is some friends and some rocks.
 Then you find some stuff that is going to be broken by rocks and take
 aim.  It is a good way to get in the paper and unsettle people.

        But riots can have bad effects.  They are easy to squash.  And if
 there are too many riots that are not scary enough and are easily
 squashed, people start to trust the cops to solve problems.  Then they
 give them more power.  Then we have a police state.

        Small scale terrorism is better.  By which I mean vandalism.  
 Society is not held together by the government, because its powers are 
 illusory.  It is held together by a sense of routine and a love of 
 order.  If that love of order is violated, people start to get nervous.  
 When people are nervous enough they panic.  When they panic, they start 
 to unravel society.

     So the best thing you can do is break a lot of windows late late at 
 night for no good reason.  Make people start to think their lives are 
 not as ordered as they were the day before.  Keep up small scale acts of 
 vandalism, increasing the perceived disorder.  As a wise man I used to 
 know would say "fuck shit up".

     The sense of routine evaporates along with the sense of safety.  
 That is the first step toward doing away with the government.  Even if 
 it doesn't work, which it is not likely to, it will keep you from 
 writing things about "idiot tests" (and the dude who wrote that looks 
 very expendable).

        Whatever the result then, if it topples the government or just 
 keeps that fat son of a bitch away from his computer, it's nothing but 
 positive.
