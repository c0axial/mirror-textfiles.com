        I need a tragedy in my life right now.

        A phone call at 2am to tell me that someone died.

        Maybe a friend of mine could get aids.

        Or even get with AIDS, for that matter.

        Sometimes life seems to be going to well and I just feel depressed
 and there is no reason to feel that way.

        So yeah, a big tragedy would suit me good right about now.

        None of this highschool massacre bullshit.  That's not a tragedy,
 that's a godsend.

        I need something that is going to make me cry.  That's all I need.

        Just one tear.

        One tear to justify the sadness and depression I sometimes feel for
 absolutely no reason whatsoever.

        Man, I thought I'd gotten rid of all this angst when I graduated high
 school.

        I have all these great ideas (actually, they're mostly completely
 half-assed ideas, but certainly better than a DTO mansion or something), but
 absolutely no support to pull them off.

        Speaking of half-assed...
