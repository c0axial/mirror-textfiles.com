        Hello.  Here's some things I wrote in a mental hospital. You
 will enjoy them, oh yes.

 -- We don't care what you think
    little man, little boy
    You squirmings are useless now
    Doesn't matter what you say
    how you think, little man
    We've got all that you'll need.
    Your with us, little man
    little boy, little fuck.
    Chemically coming,
    your sickly becoming
    now broken yes beaten
    you'll follow along.
    Your a dog
    in a bag
    that is hung
    from the gallows
    in a dead town
    on a gone time
    anywhere.

 -- muffle of his pillow 
    keeps everything beyond the screaming
    of the ten year old next door in silence.
    it's summer, and florida,
    and two sheets,
    and two shirts,
    but i shiver.
    and her eyes still leak.
    he pummels the door open
    and lets me know it's my turn
    that it's only a business
    the business of drugs
    hope in pill form.
    i walk in, i sit down
    i get this, he gives that
    there's his money
    fucker/fuckee
    profit from misery.
    my new doctor is my new god
    my new doctor is my new love
    my new doctor is my new life.
    the dangerous
    little man.

 -- tick-tocking head
    right to wrong to stop to go to running
    through the street
    crowded with these thoughtless thoughts
    from thinking machines.
    we combat like drunk philosophers
    on the eve of doomsday.
    Meant to
    Endure
    Naked in the gutter
    Digging through shit
    searching for that savior
    and this last desperate clutch
    at all the lost time.
    when you realize
    the madmen were often right.
    Meant to
    Meant to
    ..exactly.

 -- you go for a walk
    and you stumble on wherever
    looking at the sun
    you see it when you close your eyes
    but do you think it had once been more
    before your birth?
    you see them when you open them back up
    the rich in their rooms.
    and your odd glances at them
    seeing if you can permeate money.

 -- You can go your way..and.. i can go my way.
    I spotted him in between thoughts one day
    we didn't talk, we only looked
    just keep staring; we decided
    and let's not ruin it by getting to know eachother.
    because our love is like anarchy
    a utopic paradise, yet
    fucked.
    we think we thought y'know
    but you can never tell
    you'll never retain your constant flux
    you won't hack this
    you'll conform
    and recede
    and we'll all die
    and i'll stare.
    write fifty books on it
    or shut up and enjoy,
    like this.

 -- Soon it will be quiet.
    Another night just like every other one
    Sneak outside and light up
    Everyone is in bed and asleep
    Everyone but me is in bed, and asleep
    I get a rush of shame, like i might be keeping a few of them up
    Like they can hear my door shut and look out the window to see me
    Like my existence is detrimental to some yuppies circadian rythm
    Like they think i'm different and hate me because of it
    Like their rules don't apply to me
    It's all quiet out here though.
    Everyone's asleep of course.
    There's the newspaper guy with the headlights
    There's the thoughts of things people have to do when they wake up
    There they are all over the world, waiting for morning
    There's me on the gutter, all lit up.
    No morning. Soon, in the head, i will be quiet. 

 -- umbrella
    she's like the rain
    she stops and falls
    she's the silent one in your homeroom
    haunting your image as you pass by
    her torn up victemless mind
    just you, and the mutilated arms
    of the girl in your gym class.
    Put out her eyes and show her to a field
    full of blind men and pits.
    They flutter, they stumble,
    they fall right in
    occaisionally something arrives
    to keep her going another week or so
    But she's done
    shove her in the direction
    of whatever's left and bottomless
    So that,
    like the rain.
    She may show you
    her swan dive.

 -- i don't like this
    When drugs are what we know of love
    and pain is all that keeps us from failing
    what god is there to save us?
    when he himself is sad
    when satan bathes in nothing
    when happiness is that dim light
    at the end of a nonexistent tunnel
    what'll god do?
    what go will do?
    so give 'em drugs, keep them quiet
    give them what they ask for to survive
    but don't tell us you care
    alchohol, the blood of god.
    the blood of a coward.

 -- revely for a dead man
    no pills
    and no sleep
    and no advice
    and no hate
    you can stop calling me, yes
    since you've realized that
    i'm not what your looking for
    since i've realized that i've made
    a fool of myself.
    why circle?
    dive down the plug-hole.
    the only way we'll float
    is if we die.
    I can't tell if it's bad or good
    when your finally defeated
    supposedly, like most things,
    it just is
    But where to go from nowhere?
    When your at the full-fledged
    bottom.
    I can't tell
    And i wish i didn't have to try
    It's such a nice suprise 
    when you feel your luck
    begin to change.
    the bottom leveling out
    and everyone calling your name.
    the whole worlds attention
    fully magnified upon you
    such a nice little suprise
    The enemies see
    what they've been missing
    and give you thier apologies
    Your friends tell you what they really
    deep down
    think.
    Such a beautiful suprise
    but then you realize
    it was just another dream.
    And can't tell if it's a bad or good thing.
    no interaction at all.
    and no help
    and no hope
    and no talent
    and no angst
    and no pity
    and nobody.

 -- "I think your problems are very trite."
    guiltily home now, i still recollect
    i plug in the brain and i reconnect
    does it come down to god?
    as kids this was all we could remember,
    'nobody said life was supposed to be fair'
    and why not
    why is that so crazy?
    to change things, to be human,
    i can not imagine a god who could love
    and then hate this
    as jen's arteries scream for a hit
    there aren't any drugs for this one
    a tape instead,
    of a guy who tells her to calm down.
    as mike tries to hang himself with a shoelace in his bathroom
    as the new guy is givin three shots and sent somewhere else
    as adam is ripped naked from the shower
    she yelps a fuck and streaks down the hallway naked
    blood streaming out of her eyes.
    as i listen and write
    yeah i somehow write, fuck the living
    as the ten year old skips out the window
    as jeremiah is fooled again
    as heather is told 'one more week' for the 5th time
    what the hell can i write?
    everything's already been said in their heads.
    i'm refusing to speak for it.
    you do them. i hate this.

 -- easter.
    I finally got the cigarettes. So i wouldn't have to off myself.
    But the nicotine always hits you wrong after all the hassle.
    I walked past the bum, and he gave me his sad-stained look.
    Minutes later i realized i was singing as i walked by.
    I sit and watch the cars roll away, and think I must be one of you now.
    And in the back of my mind, it's easter.

 -- notes from nowhere.
    remembering where i am and have been,
    as she knocks upon the wall.
    As i supposedly get better,
    from my sickness,
    from it all.
    As i plan to plan to think
    These thoughts I'm not allowed,
    The chemicals, the neurons,
    Load your guns and take a bow.
    Still she knocks.
    As they creep into the mind
    And rip me up in shreds.
    As they creep into the mind
    And rip it up till dead.
    As they creep into my mind..
    i wonder if it'll make a sound,
    when they finally drive me mad.
    If i'll be underground,
    or live haphazardly sad.
    If the knocking ever ceases
    If she drives me into pieces
    I wonder if this thing still has a voice.
    still i wait.
    I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING
    WHEN YOU KNOCKED UPON MY
    WALL MY LIFE MY SOUL I WAITED
    HERE AS YOU SUCCEDED AND
    RECEDED AND DEFEATED AS YOU
    RAN DOWN GOD WITH A BATTLE 
    AXE AND FOUR NAILS STILL I
    LISTENED AND I WAIT FOR THE WIZARD
    OF OZ AND CHARIOTS OF FIRE AND
    THE SAINTS TO COME THE FUCK ON
    IN I WAIT FOR GOD TO SAY HELLO
    I WAIT CUZ IT'S ALL I KNOW I'M
    WAITING AND WEARY AND WAVING
    AS YOU WALK ALONG HOME
    STILL I WAITED HERE STILL I WAITED
    HERE STILL I WAITED HERE
    WHERE'S THE HOPE IN THIS

 -- life and death
    There are ants
    on the sidewalk
    which you will step on
    but they will fall
    in between
    the rivets
    of your boot.
    There's a turtle
    on the train tracks
    stuck in limbo
    dead forver
    taken by the sun
    to spare the train.
    Me and the lizard
    who thinks my ashes
    are dinner.
    A puff of smoke
    and he runs.
    when all the wrong people
    love all the wrong people
    there's a hope
    for somebody
    somewhere.
