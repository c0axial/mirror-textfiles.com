        As a special joint-project, HOE #400 is based on those old
 "Choose Your Own Adventure" books that many of us read as kids.  The HOE
 Staff, along with many others, decided to do our version of this
 concept, with each of us writing our own short part.

        To play, simply start at square 1.  When you are offered a choice
 of where to go, select which number in [brackets] you wish to follow,
 and follow it.  Simple enough, huh?

        But beware... this is a deadly game, and endings come quick if
 you make an unwise choice!

        The following authors (43 in all) have written at least some
 part of this file (listed in order of appearance):

 !!========================================================================!!

 [1] (Mogel)

        You never liked your friends in high school very much.  They
 were generally "alright" by conventional standards, you supposed, but
 as senior year pressed on, you were progressively becoming more and
 more of a social elitist -- eventually only hanging out with the
 captain of the football team, the head cheerleader, and the guy with
 the most Dragonlance boxed sets.  The four of you would sometimes go
 on amazing adventures together around the neighborhood!  Today is no
 exception.  Bright and early your friends assembled outside your front
 door, full of a brand new project -- "let's go explore the woods!"

 * If you'd like to go exploring the woods with your friends, go to [2].
 * If you'd like to go back to sleep, go to [3].

 [2] (Cstone)

        To the delight of your friends, you decide to join in the trek
 into the woods.  Your ego is stroked by the fact that as far as you
 know, nobody has ever entered the forest and lived.  As you fearlessly
 enter the woods, you see the remnant of a trail heading in one
 direction.  You briefly wonder which direction the trail led, but soon 
 realize that nobody among you has brought a compass.  You think about
 going back for one, but that thought dies quickly as you frustratingly
 realize that nobody has brought a map, either.

 * If you'd like to follow the old trail, go to [4].
 * To go in a random untrodden direction, go to [5].


 [3] (Cstone)

        You're really tired, since you didn't get to sleep until 4 A.M.
 after a wild night of partying, so you respectfully decline the offer.
 To your surprise, your "friends" quickly get upset, and deluge you
 with angry questions about why you don't go with them and why they
 should even be associated with you.  As they start to leave, you feel
 afraid that your seemingly innocuous refusal to explore the woods may
 have done irreparable damage to the relationship between you and your
 friends.  The threads holding your fragile, deformed social ego above
 the water of despair are cut, and you slowly trudge back to bed.  You
 try to sleep, but it's impossible now that your life has been ruined, 
 so you change your mind and run back outside, determined to join your
 friends in their journey through the woods, but they're already
 gone... the end.

 [4] (Meenk)

        You begin to stumble down the old trail, struggling to keep from
 losing your footing amongst the dead branches and rocks. One of your
 stupid friends is whining about the poison ivy which is growing along
 the sides of the narrow path.  You try to block out his complaints, but
 his voice is at the exact frequency that triggers your chronic migraine
 headaches.  You turn around and scream "SHUT THE FUCK UP!"  He does,
 but only for another 30 feet.  At this point the path has virtually
 disappeared and you are treading on compacted poison ivy.  He begins
 to whine louder than before.

 * If you pick up a fist-sized stone and hurl it at your friend's head,
   go to [8].
 * If you stuff your ears full of leaves, go to [9].

 [5] (Trilobyte)

        you opt not to follow the established path and head off to the
 right.  your friends gain some respect for you because you have already
 taken the helm of control of the group and have led them off to what
 seems to be uncharted territory.

        after you have walked a distance through the wilderness, you
 notice that the scenery seems to be changing a bit.  the traditional
 green shades are becoming darker and the brown shades are becoming
 deeper.  you hear what sounds like a stream or brook somewhere to
 the left.

 * To trek toward the water sound, go to [6].
 * If you want to continue along your random path, go to [7].

 [6] (Meenk)

        You start to the left, pushing through small branches and foliage,
 the trees above blotting out most of the light. Your friends encourage
 you, impressed by your bravery, and you lead them deep into the trees.
 You are forced to stop when you get to a huge fallen tree, but the
 gurgling of the water seems to be right on the other side. You ask for
 a boost from your friends, and soon stand on top of the gigantic log.
 One by one you pull your companions atop the tree. Suddenly one of
 them slips on the moist moss, grabs onto you and one of the others,
 and *SPLASH* you all plunge into the cold water on the other side. You
 all frantically grab for each other, but the only hand you grasp is the
 cold, clammy hand of a corpse.

 * If you examine the corpse, go to [10].
 * If you get the fuck out of there, friends or no friends, go to [11].

 [7] (Darwin)

        The ground beneath you gives way with a loud *SNAP* as you, the
 cheerleader and the Nerd all slide down a steep embankment into a muddy
 pit.  The captain of the football team looks down at you and begins to
 taunt you.  The Jock is suddenly quiet and then you hear the sounds of
 a struggle and the Jock babbling incoherently.  You hear a wet crunching
 noise and a scream as The Jock's lifeless body flies into the pit and
 lands arranged in all the wrong ways.  As the cheerleader starts
 screaming and the Nerd starts rolling two 10 sided die, you realize
 it's up to you to take charge of an ugly situation.

 * If you smoke a joint, go to [14].
 * If you whip out a pocket knife and calm your friends down, go to [15].

 [8] (Art)

        You whip the fist-sized rock at your role-playing friend's head.
 All of a sudden, the air surrounding him shimmers, and a blinding
 white light shines until you can't bear to look at it any longer. When
 you slowly reopen your half-blinded eyes you see not your friend, but a
 many-eyed BEHOLDER!

 * If you withdraw your trusty Vorpal BoyScout Pocketknife and attempt
   to vanquish the beholder, go to [16].
 * If you take out a small black palmable device from your pocket with
   the words "DON'T PANIC" written on the cover, go to [17].

 [9] (Art)

        As you hastily grab a handful of leaves from the shrubbery of the
 forest and stick them in your ears to drown out the incessant whine
 caused by your stupid friend's monologue, you swiftly realize two
 things.  One, that your hands just became twice as large as they were
 moments ago and itch like a motherfucker, and, two, your ears are
 beginning to pus and leak bodily fluids. Your already unbearable
 migraine turns into a throbbing black hole of a headache... in your left
 eye, fusing every single c-phiber in your swollen head.  With one last
 torturous wave of pain, your head explodes like an overripe melon from
 the caustic effects of the Poison Ivy that you mistakenly plunged into
 your unwitting ear canals.  The end.

 [10] (Darwin)

        After the requisite five seconds of abject horror, you and your
 vapid friends jump to your feet, aghast at the spooky corpse which is
 lying face down in an eddy of the forest brook. The corpse is dressed
 in a conservative blue suit which contrasts the putrescent white of its
 bloated flesh. Summoning up your courage, you flip the corpse over
 onto its back and are shocked to see the face of the 37th President
 of these United States, Richard Milhouse Nixon!

        Your surprise at seeing the former leader of the free world
 increases tremendously when his lips start to move and you hear him
 speak!

        "Please.. let me explain..", he rasps in an a voice that sounds
 like a creaking door.

 * If you listen to what Tricky Dick has to say, go to [12].
 * If you run like hell from the undead Richard Nixon, go to [13].

 [11] (Zooey)

        As you clamber quickly out of the water, flailing your arms and
 legs and cursing the day mom fell in love with your swimming instructor
 and daddy pulled you out of classes at the Y, your foot catches in a 
 sinkhole underwater, and everything goes black.  When you come to in
 a coughing fit some time later, spewing dark water around you, nothing
 looks familiar, and the friends you abandoned are nowhere to be found.
 Once you rise unsteadily to your feet, though, you notice that one thing
 at least is still with you--the clammy hand and detached forearm of the
 corpse!  You notice that the hand has six fingers, which probably
 accounts for the firm grip that it has.

 * If you want to take a closer look at your new treasure, go to [18].
 * If you couldn't sooner be rid of the thing, throw it into the bushes
   and run towards what you think may be upstream, go to [19].

 [12] (Isaac)

        Your instincts tell you to run or quickly find something heaven
 to beat down the abomination, but are you feeling sympathetic and down
 right cheeky today like a curious little monkey.  So, you lean towards
 him in hopes better understanding his dying-old-lady voice.  That is
 when his hand shoots out and he seizes the side of your head and hair.
 You scream such a high tone it can barely be heard by human ears.  Oh,
 and you die after he bites a large chuck of your head off.  The end.
 
 [13] (Swiss Pope)

        Heart racing, you sprint through the forest alone until you come
 to a clearing to catch your breath.  Was what you have seen real?  You
 recall the day at school when your civics teacher announced the former
 President's death-- surely that could not have been him!  But the
 corpse's beady eyes, widow's peak in the hair, nose of a crooked Quaker
 leaves no doubt in your mind that it was indeed Richard Milhouse Nixon.
 Suddenly you hear the sounds of voices and footsteps-- could they be your
 friends, could they be hunters, could they possible be... ARMY GUYS?  

 * If you want to hide, hoping that you are not discovered, go to [28].
 * If you want to shout out, letting yourself be known, go to [29].

 [14] (Isaac)

        With the on-slot of screaming and emotion you decide to take out
 your shit and smoke for awhile.  As you do you feel yourself lose grip
 on reality and you pass out, probably as a result of bad weed.  You have
 a dream about a small naked girl in an oriental garden who stabs you in
 the chest with a very large knife.  You wake up to a quiet morning sun
 rise and the sound of birds and a softly trickling scream.

 * If you would like to find your friends, go to [26].
 * If you would like to find your way home, go to [27].

 [15] (Ziego Vuantar)

        YOUR FRIENDS ARE STUPID!  YOU THREATEN TO CUT THEM TO BITS AGAIN
 AND AGAIN TO SILENCE THEIR MISERABLE EXISTENCES... BUT DO THEY LISTEN?
 OF COURSE NOT!  THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU DUMB, SELF-CENTERED, CAPITALISTIC
 AMERICANS.  YOU KILL THEM ALL AND THEN KILL YOURSELF AND MAKE ZIEGO
 VUANTAR VERY VERY HAPPY!  THE END.

 [16] (kaia)

        But faster than you can say "uncle," the many-eyed beholder
 lunges towards you, folds of its gnarled, rubbery-loose flesh slopping
 you like punching bags knocking you to the ground.  Its hot and sour
 breath sears your face as you withdraw your boyscout knife and drive it
 fast and hard, many times, into the space between the eyes.  Star bucks
 Coffee trickles from some of the wounds, while irish cream pours from
 others.  Sweet nectar of the gods!  You take out a tin cup and start to
 collect fluid to drink.

 * If you've decided to get wired on Star bucks, go to [34].
 * If you've decided to get plastered on Bailey's, go to [35].

 [17] (Swiss Pope)

        "What's this?" you ask, referring to the small black palmable
 device with the words "DON'T PANIC" on the cover.

        "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  It's a sort of electronic
 book.  It tells you everything you need to know about anything.  That's
 its job," says the Beholder.

        You turn it over nervously in your hands.

        "I like the cover," you say.  "Don't Panic.  It's the first
 helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."

        Suddenly, Douglas Adams comes trotting through the forest,
 accompanied by his lawyers from Simon and Schuster, spouting off
 gibberish about copyright infringement, then teleports you to Traal,
 where you are promptly eaten by the mind boggling stupid Bugblatter
 Beast.  The end.

 [18] (tasha)

        You take a deep breath and slowly begin prying the pale hand off
 of your wrist, grimacing at your fingers, which are sinking into the
 bloated flesh.  A drop of watered down blood drips from the detached
 forearm of the corpse and onto your already soaked jeans.  You swallow
 the lumps in your throat, and prepare to fully examine your new toy.
 You notice a few, previously oozing, sores near the wrist.

 * If you wish to examine these sores more, go to [20].
 * If you wish to hold on to the forearm, and try to find your way home
   to show it to your parents, go to [21].

 [19] (Teerts)

        in a slight fit of panic, you feverishly try to detach the
 autonomous six-fingered hand and forearm from your arm.  unsuccessful,
 you sit around for about a half hour thinking of a way to get the damned
 thing off...after much thought you decide to chew the bastard off, but
 since the hand has six fingers, you instead go for the thumb to speed
 things up and finally you remove the thing from your arm.  you bring
 the arm high as you are about to throw it into some nearby brush but
 then you decide that you liked the taste of the meat as you chewed your
 way free from the arm.  you bite off two of the remaining digits and
 pocket them for later...you know, just in case...  you walk off into
 the woods in search of another trail.

 * if you want to keep searching for a trail go to [39].
 * if you decide to camp here and wait around until you are dry before
   continuing your journey, go to [40].

 [20] (Ewheat)

        After admiring the materialistic attributes of the sores, you
 implement your 2nd-grade knowledge of the Newton Laws upon the 
 observing procedure.  You benchmark its durability by adding velocity
 to it as you throw it against a nearby tree.

        A bear comes out, you regret not voting for Reagan.  You're dead.
 The end.

 [21] (Tasha)

        You wrinkle your nose, and get a firm grip on the forearm and
 hand, before quickly jumping to your feet and fighting your way through
 the low-hanging branches.  You run as fast as you can, and finally exit
 from the woods onto a street you know to be only a few blocks from your
 house.  You hide the arm under your shirt, and turn a few corners,
 headed toward your house.  You walk in to your mother asking where
 you've been.

 * If you apologize and take the arm to your room, go to [22].
 * If you show the arm to your mother, go to [23].

 [22] (Anjee)

        You mumble some lame excuse that your mother doesn't buy and
 head for the mess that is known as your bedroom, still hiding the
 forearm under your shirt.  However, as you were running up the stairs,
 your new toy falls from your shirt and begins tumbling down the flight
 of stairs, landing on your dogs head "yELP!@".  Your mother walks up
 to the dog and finds the rotten forearm and thoroughly examines it.
 You begin to wonder why she hasn't screamed yet, and slowly approach
 your mother only to see a grin draw onto her face -- she's contemplating
 something!

 * If your mother bites into the forearm and swallows a mouthful of
   rotten flesh and maggots, go to [24].
 * If your mother violently slaps you around with the arm, go to [25].

 [23] (Anjee)

        You discard your mother's question and quickly pull the forearm
 out from under of your shirt and hold it inches from your mother's face.
 Unlike you expected, she does not ask where the hell you got THAT from,
 but hits your arm with extreme force, causing you to launch the forearm
 in mid-air... landing into the soup she was preparing on the stove.
 You grin evilly and begin to chuckle, asking your mother if she's hungry.
 Mother bolts towards the phone with steam coming out of her ears and
 dials the number to the nearest loony bin.  You are locked up in a
 mental institute for the rest of your life, no one ever visits you, and
 you become best friends with a spider, but it dies a few days later so
 you kill yourself also.  The end.

 [24] (Zeigo Vuantar)

        YOUR MOTHER, REMEMBERING HER ROOTS OF AN IMPRISONED CHILD IN A
 DARK, POOR PRISON CELL, SUFFERING AT THE HANDS OF OPPRESSION, WAS FORCED
 TO EAT FOREARMS SUCH AS THIS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  SHE BITES DOWN, AND
 THE BLOOD POURS OUT, FLOWING DOWN HER CHIN, HER NECK, AND COLORING HER
 DRESS DARK RED.  YOU TRY TO SCREAM... BUT YOU ARE DEAD.  FOR NO GOOD
 REASON.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!#@#@  THE END.

 [25] (Kreid)

        THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD is the last word you can hear before
 you find yourself staring blankly at the blank ceiling of your now
 dead-silent home.  You feel most of your senses leaving you -- but you
 definitely sense that you are lying in something wet.  "What could this
 be that I'm lying in?" you wonder, but it's too late for that kind of
 thinking because you feel you are losing it... losing your... no--

        you see a white light in front of you.

 * If you want to follow the light, go to [30].
 * If you want to try to hold on to your life, go to [31].

 [26] (Ewheat)

        When your high school teacher told you to read Marx, you shushed
 The Communist Manifesto for an evening of Jennifer Aniston and Matthew
 LeBlanc in NBC's "Friends."  You've resorted to marijuana and other
 social-dependent drugs because of this.

        You toke a joint and realize these friends of yours aren't
 really your friends, and they'll never amount up to a masturbation
 session over-reviewing Courtney Cox and Lisa Kudrow's chest-sizes...

	You lose all friends.  Become a hermit.  Write a best-seller
 that nobody understands but your "intellectual muse."  Hahaha, you
 loser!  The end!

 [27] (Ziego Vuantar)

        BUT YOU CAN'T GO HOME BECAUSE YOUR HOME HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND
 IS NOT UNDER CONTROL OF THE OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT REGIME!  YOUR FAMILY,
 FRIENDS, AND EVERYTHING YOU KNOW AND LOVE HAS DISAPPEARED AND YOU ARE
 ALONE, NAKED, AND THE IRONIC FOOT OF CAPITALISM HAS SHOVED ITS FOOT
 STRAIGHT UP YOUR DESERVING ASS!  YOU *DIE*, FUCKER!!!  BURN IN HELL!!!!!
 THE END.
 
 [28] (AnonGirl)

        You search for the nearest hiding place, and stumble upon a small
 log that you could fit in.  You slide inside the wet log and keep a
 close watch on the things outside when you suddenly feel something
 moving at your feet.  You light a match to see what's down there, and
 find a small brown baby bear trying to squeeze its way out.  You
 nervously turn back facing forward, only to discover two giant bear feet
 staring at you.  'Oh shit!', you think, as you begin to hear the
 crunching sounds of wet wood and feel sharm bear claws tearing away at
 your body.  The end!

 [29] (Jook)

        Turning your head ever so slightly to the right, you see the
 fine men of the American Armed Forces.  With their guns pointed at the
 tip of your nose, you wonder what you should do about this precarious
 position.  "Excuse me," you say "I'm not really sure what to do here.
 I mean, you've got a gun,  I don't. What to do?"
        
        Annoyed at your words, one of the soldiers puts the gun in your
 mouth. "We do not like you. Your shoes are untied, your pants hang too
 low,   your hair isn't cut very nicely, and you need to make a dentist
 appointment.  Oh, and you need a suit because you're getting old now."

        "Pleagh," you mumble, wishing they could hear you beg for your
 life, but within seconds, you hear the twitch of the officer's finger,
 the gunshot,  and ultimately your body slump to the ground.

        "Get a damn suit and pull your pants up, damn hippie." 

 * If you pull your pants up, which may save your life, go to [36].
 * If you don't, go to [29].

 [30] (Kreid)

        You find that you can't quite walk, but you follow the light...
 you... hover into it.  Some time passes, maybe? if time existed? but it
 seems irrelevant to you, as you are quite overwhelmed, and quite
 confused; by nothing in particular, just nothingness.  All white.

        You hover idly, in some kind of motion, for a while, until a
 voice comes into your head, booming.  It speaks:

 * If you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,
   go to [32].
 * If you are an unrepenting heathen, go to [33].

 [31] (Tortoise)

        As you struggle to regain control of your dirty, rash-splotched
 body, a gentle voice offers you a jar of honey.  Your senses are
 instantly overwhelmed by images of the sweet, mellifluous substance
 dripping from your fingertips and onto your tongue, and you relinquish
 control of what used to be your body.  the end.

 [32] (AltRocks)

        Suddenly you feel yourself being whacked away at phenomenal
 speeds.  You see the light getting closer and closer, and closer, until
 it seems to be right there.  Then you notice a man standing there with
 a flashlight.  He says to you "What did you expect there to be.  God?
 HAHAHA!"  The end.

 [33] (AltRocks)

        You hear a deep voice speaking to you, from your head, "Good
 choice. Maybe you're not such a putz after all. But you still have a
 long way to go. Now is the time to prove that your not some dumb text
 file writing computer geek with no real life sckillz. You must go thru
 a series of trials of the physical, mental, and emotional types.  You
 will wish there was a hell after you're done.

 * If you accept the challenge go to [37].
 * If you refuse the challenge go to [38].

 [34] (Kaia)

        The Star bucks coffee is a thousand degrees hot and instantly
 grills your insides into jerky.  Your friends, now starving because
 they had lost their fearless leader, stumble upon the freshly-grilled
 meat.  As they realize it's not a mirage, they devour your lean,
 hickory-smoked flesh.  Serves you right for patronizing franchises
 that mercilessly devour their small business competitors!  The end.

 [35] (AnonGirl)

        You begin to chug away the Bailey's, beginning to feel tipsy.
 After deciding you've had enough to drink, you sit back against a
 large tree and smoke a cigarette, taking in the wonderful nature air.
 Suddenly the tree begins to shake.  You stand up and stare at the
 shaking tree for a while when out of nowhere a giant cycloptic behemoth
 jumps out from the treetop. Standing face to face with the tall
 monster, you notice the items on its belt consist of swords, daggers,
 knives, and coconut shell shot glasses... and it seems to know kung-fu.

 * To run for your life, go to [41].
 * To challenge the cycloptic beast in a drinking contest, go to [42].

 [36] (Mogel)

        You attempt to pull up your pants, but accidentally stroke
 your genitals.  Go to [49].

 [37] (Mistawho)

        You are whisped away to an open pasture, there seems to only
 be you.

        "This'll be the physical test, kill your opponent and you'll
 move to the next test."

        Simple enough, right?  But that opponent so happens to be
 Jackie Chan.  As he politely removes your testicles and shoves them
 down your throat, you only manage to utter, "holy fucking shit."
 Go to [41].

 [38] (AltRocks)

        The voice materializes in front of you in the form of an orange
 midget with green hair. He looks at you, shakes his head, and asks you,
 "Why did you have to make it so hard?" He then reaches into a small 
 pouch drooped around neck and pulls out a gun.  You try to run, but he
 guns you down like the stupid snimal you are.  He then calls for his 
 midget friends to join in a barbecue of your remains.  The end.

 [39] (Mistawho)

        Three hours and one finger later, progress is nil.  You keep
 finding paths, but with every path comes a dead end.  Finally seeing
 light deep down a well-hidden path, you follow it and find the
 cheerleader and the nerd, they follow you down the path further, and
 you notice what might be an exit.

        "Don't worry guys," you say as you are looking over your
 shoulder, "I think I've found a way....."

        Fate interrupts you, as you have discovered a 200 foot drop off,
 while pondering on the long fall, you realize you are indeed an idiot.
 The end.

 [40] (Teerts)

        you clear off a fire pit and even drag a big rock over so you can
 sit, but when you're about to build your fire, you realize that you
 don't have matches... "AHA!" you exclaim as you reach in your fifth
 pocket for your zippo...you start to cry when you find that your
 favorite lighter is gone too!  you sit on your rock and start munching
 on your fingerfoodsnacks when you notice that the temperature is
 dropping, rapidly.  Since you are such an socially elitist mofo, you
 think you can handle it and just decide to wait out the nite... colder
 it gets... your core body temperature drops way below 37 and hypothermia
 sets in... you are never seen again.  the end.

 [41] (Quarex)

        You start to run for your life.  Fortunately for you, reality
 works a lot like a King's Quest game, and the kung-fu beast
 mysteriously moves much slower than your keyboard parsed input allows
 you to move.  You easily elude the lumbering beast, and find yourself
 along side a peaceful pond, surrounded by happy woodland creatures.
 You think you hear an Erasure song playing in the background.  There
 is a broken baseball bat near the pond's edge, and you smell the faint
 odor of vanilla.  There are paths leading north and south.

 * To follow a path to the north or the south, go to [45].
 * To dive into the pond, go to [46].

 [42] (Neko)

        You challenge the cycloptic beast to a drinking contest. The
 beast leads you to his cave, even further off the path than you already
 were. Inside his cave you see a table with two chairs. On the table sit
 two shot glasses as well as a tray of pickles. You look at the pickles
 in bewilderment until the beast explains that they are all he has to
 chase drinks with. The beast then invites you to look into his liquor
 cabinet and choose the evening's drink of choice.

 * If you grab a bottle of Smirnoff and pour two shots, go to [43].
 * If the bottle of Jack's catches your eye, go to [44].

 [43] (Quarex)

	Hesitantly grabbing the bottle of Smirnoff from the cabinet, you	
 proceed to pour a shot for you and the horrible cycloptic beast.  He
 looks you straight in the eye, says "Here's looking at you, Kid," and 
 downs the shot in a split second.  He then grabs the bottle and finishes
 the rest of it off before you even have a chance to look at your
 shot glass a second time.  You hoist the shot glass to your lips and down
 the shot. Oops, you forgot that alcohol is a poison.  You are dead.
 The end.

 [44] (Ilsundal & Metal Chick)

	You hastefully grab the bottle brewed by your good friend Mr.
 Daniels, and prepare to pour yourself a shot.  The beast abruptly grabs
 the bottle after you set it down, and pours himself one.  Clenching your
 glass, you take a rapid gulp of the liqour, as it burns your throat on
 the way down.  "Goes down smooth," you shout out, gasping for air in the
 process.  You notice that this brew has a rather funny after taste, but
 none-the-less, you match the cycloptic beast shot for shot.  The beast
 grins evilly as he watches your body plummet to the cold stone floor.

	Hours later, you sense a feeling of warth beating down on your
 cheeks.  Opening your eyes, you are practically blinded by the sunbeams
 shining down from the bright blue sky.  You then realize you are no
 longer in the beast's cave, and begin to wonder what became of your
 friends, if they are alright, and where the hell you are at this
 present time.  Looking to your side, you notice you are in the middle
 of a ring of mushrooms, in a clearing in the forest.  Moments later,
 you hear an enchanting combination of chimes, harps, and bells.  Three
 inch winged figures then descend from the sky, each surrounded by a
 unique colored aura.

 * If you decide to speak with one of these creatures, go to [47].
 * If you decide to dance to the beautiful music, go to [48].
 * If you decide to eat one of the mushrooms, go to [50].

 [45] (Trilobyte)
 
        you leave the distinctly new-age homosexual portion of the
 mysterious woods and walk a few thousand feet in a northward direction.
 Your head implodes, explodes, MINDWARP.  Are you LISTENING to WHAT I'M
 SAYING?

 YOU ARE STANDING IN AN OPEN FIELD WEST
 OF A WHITE HOUSE, WITH A BOARDED FRONT
 DOOR.
 THERE IS A SMALL MAILBOX HERE.

 > OPEN MAILBOX [goto 53]
 > GO WEST [goto 54]

 [46] (aster)

        after you dive into the murky purple water several happy rabbits
 follow you them being the happy sheep that they are.  you don't feel
 very wet, and are able to breath very well so you wonder..*what could
 have happened* you open your eyes and find yourself in a deep
 underground fortress filled with kings and queens and flowers and three
 little pigs and a wolf and her puppies and a dandelion.  you look next
 to you to find the happy sheep rabbits that had followed you into this
 purply pinkish darkish place and you saw nothing but dried out rabbit
 hides sewn into little mittens and hats. you instantly forget the rabbit
 sheep and grab the cute, warm, things and try them on, they then reach
 up and stick forks that have apple pie and whipped cream in your eyes
 and up you nose and in you ears until you die a slow, agonizing death.
 the end.

 [47] (Mutter)  

        "Hello, there," you say to one of the winged creatures which
 lands gracefully on your hand.  She hesitates to speak for a few seconds
 but then utters in a high-pitched fairy voice what sounds like, "Fuck
 you, mother bitch!"  Appalled at what you hear, you clasp your hands
 together, thus crushing the fairy with a loud crunch.  Upon seeing the
 gooey remains, the other fairies start to attack by throwing man-eating
 jelly beans at you.

      Apparently you were unaware that "Fuck you, mother bitch" was a
 very polite greeting in fairy-ese -- sucks for you.  The end.

 [48] (Ilsundal & Metal Chick)

        Not at all intimidated by what you see, you proceed to stand, and
 dance to the most enchanting music.  The creatures are pleased by what
 they see, and dance along with you.  Brilliant flashes of color seem to
 trigger all of your senses -- sight, taste, smell, touch, and hearing.
 What seems like no longer then a nano second, you see the sun rising, and
 setting in an endless loop, as the faery folk dance most vigorously with
 you.  Never have you seen such a sight in all of your existence, 
 unknowingly that this is what you will see for the rest of your
 existence.  The End.

 [49] (PezMonkey)

        Your touch accidentally excites your genital region.  Your now
 erect penis fascinates the Army Men, as it is the biggest, hardest,
 throbbingest cock they have ever seen.  Because they are, after all,
 Army Men, they decide they would like to watch you bone your
 role-playing,  Dragonlance-owning buddy hardcore.  "Keep your pants
 down," they yell at you, and force the Geek (whose name, by the way,
 is Gary Coleman Salomoski) to bend down in front of you.  You ram your
 manhood into his ass.

 * If you enjoy this, and want to continue, for the pleasure of both the
   Army Men and yourself, go to [51].
 * If you are scared of what the Army Men might require next, and whisper
   in Gary Coleman Salomoski's ear to RUN, go to [52].

 [50] (aster)

        you love mushrooms, they are your *friend*.  but they are very
 very very very very evil, so you must be very very very very careful.
 you eat it and enjoy it mixing in some dandelion greens and carrots
 and rabbit heads.  Then you die because the rabbit's bodies come out
 and break your legs with mallet and shove your head into a bicycle
 spokes on it's way to town.  the end.

 [51] (Mogel)

        The fact that this has been such an utterly strange day,
 already has made you reconsider your identity.  Your mind is set free,
 and you enter a dream-like state, while your body continues having anal
 sex.  You enter into an out-of-body experience, and are able to float
 about the world freely, like you never have before.  You more free than
 you ever have in your life.

 * If you think this is scary, and want to return to the mundane world
   of anal sex, go to [74].
 * If you want to relive the experience in 6th grade, where you didn't
   have enough guts to kiss Melissa Dicter on the lips, go to [75].
 * If you want to explore the woods more, floating about, go to [76].

 [52] (Meenk)

        You tell your buddy to do his best Carl Lewis impersonation at
 your signal. You  pound into his tight, bleeding rectum, watching for a
 chance to escape.  The army du0ds begin to get restless and start joking
 with each other. One of them starts to tell a long faggot joke and you
 slap your pal on the ass, HARD. He takes off like a greyhound on pcp.
 You underestimated his acceleration and find yourself writhing on the
 floor, screaming, as your friend escapes, your torn penis hanging out
 of his asshole.  The army du0ds are pissed that you interrupted their
 jokes and begin to kick and beat you.  They get a large stick and ram
 it into your ass, tearing through your intestines, puncturing your
 lung. You drown on your own blood.  The end.

 [53] (TanAdept)

 Opening the mailbox reveals a small leaflet.

 > READ LEAFLET

 The leaflet is, upon closer examination, a postcard
 addressed to: "Marc Powell, 2122 Elmwood, Wilmette, IL"
 Apparently, it's from a woman named Arual, who wants
 to trade an emerald she has for a cat named Kiki.
 A return address has been provided.

 * If you want to offer Arual something else instead, go to [55].
 * If you want to try to mail yourself to Australia, go to [56].
 * If you want to > GO NORTH, go to [57].

 [54] (TanAdept)

 You would need a machete to go further west.

 Fortunately, your Boy Scout Vorpal Blade comes close
 enough, and you hack your way west into reaches
 unimagined by prior adventurers.

 Unfortunately, you realize that, since no one was ever
 expected to be able to get to this location, you've
 come to the edge of the world.

 * If you jump off, go to [58].
 * If you turn around to go back to the house, go to [59].

 [55] (Phairgirl)

        You use your trusty Boy Scout Transporter Beam to fling yourself
 to the address she had provided.  You knock upon the door to find
 yourself confronted by a humongous set of breasts and a big toothy
 smile.  However, she notices you don't have Kiki with you.  And before
 you can offer the services of your plethora of whores or a cut in your
 investments with the Italian mafia, she vaporizes you with her laser
 vision.  The end.

 [56] (Deadpan)

        You attempt to remove your extremities so that you can fit the
 trunk of your body into the mailbox.  However, once you have removed
 your legs, genitalia, and left arm, you realize that you have nothing
 with which to remove your right arm with and at any rate, you can't
 reach to mailbox to pull yourself in.  You ponder this Disco Ball World
 as you lie, impotently in a pool of your own, surprisingly tangy,
 bodily fluids.  Eventually you get bored and go home.  The end.

 [57] (Meenk)

 > GO NORTH

        You walk up the street to the Pet Store and spend your last few
 bucks on a cat.  It is a pretty shabby cat, with bald spots, matted fur,
 and bent whiskers.  Hey, it was cheap.  You tie a rope around it's neck
 with a homemade sign that says 'Kiki'.  You get a box, throw in some
 chicken nuggets and a no-spill cup of ice, and stuff the cat inside.
 When the mailman comes, you give him the box, purchase an 'OVERNIGHT'
 sticker and postage, then kick back and wait.  Two weeks later, after
 you forgot the woman in Australia and the cat, you received a big
 package.  You open it, and inside is the BIGGEST FUCKING EMERALD you
 have ever seen. You sell it and get some cocaine, cocktails, and
 naked party freaks.  The end.

 [58] (Phairgirl)

        As your memories swell up into the back of your mind, you realize
 that jumping isn't going to be the worst thing in your life. Your life
 was entirely worthless.  From the day your pastor spanked you with the
 golden chalice to the time your mother pawned your Transformers, you've
 known that over the edge was the only way to go.  Your jump, a perfectly
 executed swan dive, was graceful and exhilarating.  However, to your
 dismay, you land on a mountain of marshmallows.

 * To finish what you've started with your Boy Scout Vorpal Blade,
   go to [62].
 * To eat the marshmallows, go to [63].

 [59] (Deadpan)

        As you turn around to go back to the house, John Dillinger steps
 out from behind a (before un-noticed) tree holding an advanced  sniper
 rifle. You realize that you are now in Dallas, Texas with a rather
 nice view of Jackie O. cradling John F. Kennedy's broken head in her
 lap. He takes a look at you, surprised for a moment, and says "Hail
 Eris."

 * If you respond "All Hail Discordia.", go to [60].
 * If you swoon like a pansy, go to [61].

 [60] (Nybar)

        You say it loud and say it proud. Sadly, the FUCKING OINKERS
 hear and GUN YOU THE FUCK DOWN! YOU'RE DEAD!

 * If you choose Arlington National, go to [64].
 * If you choose Los Crazy Mexicans Upside-Down Burial Parlor, go to [65].

 [61] (Nybar)

        You swoon.  When you wake up two hours later, you are in an
 underground detention center.  Worse yet, you have a monster erection.
 "Maybe I can help you with that." "Cripes," you think, "it's Natasha,
 my deadly love interest.  And yet, I do have a rather large erection..."
 As she helps you with your pants, your quick, undercover mind devises a
 solution to this deadly problem.  She takes your pants off. 

        "Give me a blow-job!", you command!

        "Surely dahlink, but only if joo will pleasure my haht loinS
 aftah.  For you see.. I am the wife of Adolf Hitler!  And he is impotent
 in one ball, which leaves me not getting any!"

        "Ok, if only I can cum hard enough..." you think as she sucks.
 "Ok, here goes."  You imagine a naked italian, and the resulting
 cum-river knocks her into the wall.  You use your 1960's teenage,
 special agent muscles to snap the urridium bondage gear you are held
 captive in.

        A red-velvet chair swivels around. A debonaire man sitting in it
 says "Very impressive, agent-K. But next time, keep your pants on!
 Now, which assignment would you like next?"

 * If you respond "Let me kill Hitler!", go to [66] .
 * If you respond "Let me find out who dog-napped your poodle!",
   go to [67].

 [62] (Caitlin)

        You start to pull out your Boy Scout blade, but realize there are
 walls made up of cucumbers and pizza.  Blushing, you remember when you
 were penetrated with a cucumber in a very uncomfortable place by your
 baby sitter when you were 8 years old.  You slide your hand quickly down
 your pants, assuming that since you can't see anyone, that nobody is
 really there.  A small hole develops in the pizza wall, and Mother
 Angelica, the popular televangelist, excretes through it like a sticky,
 gooey puddle of mud.  She reveals to you the secrets of the Universe
 and you cry, realizing that when your great aunt masturbated with your
 naked Totally Hair barbie, that you were voted to be thrown into a
 bright pink jail cell, with a beautiful naked hermaphrodite.  It's a
 beautiful thing.  The end.

 [63] (Avenger)

        You eat marshmallows and giggle like a schoolgirl.  Yay!  that
 felt good.  You giggle like a schoolgirl for several minutes.  Is this
 fun or what?

        Richard Nixon walks over and begins to draw a diagram of the
 Reagan administration on your arm. Henry Kissinger covers a mole.  Hmm.
 This annoys you.

	Marcia Brady walks over.  She attempts to piss standing up.  
 Unsuccessful, she helps to giggle like a schoolgirl.

        Hillary Clinton walks over.  She pulls out a large piece of
 styrofoam.  She stuffs it in your mouth, and you can no longer giggle
 like a schoolgirl.

        This tragedy causes your brain to explode.  Marcia Brady is now
 eating pieces of your head.  The end.

 [64] (Oeb)

        You choose to be buried in Arlington National but the waiting
 list for people like you doesn't exist.  Your corpse rots forgotten and
 you wish you had been cremated.  Due to fact you had no proper burial
 (or corpse disposal for that matter) your soul wanders around a new
 existence.  It's awfully confusing for you.

        Go to [99].

 [65] (Kyst)

        Your friends and family journey to Los Crazy Mexican's
 Upside-Down Burial Parlor to pay their last respects to you.  After
 searching all of Texas for the Burial Parlor you have chosen, they find
 Los Crazy Mexicans Upside-Down Burial Parlor.  The place is a mess, it
 didn't occur to you that all of the furniture would be on the ceiling
 and therefore your friends would have nowhere to sit, but oh well, that
 isn't your problem now, is it?  The small crowd gathers around the small
 chandelier in the center of the room, below your coffin.  A priest walks
 into the room and begins the eulogy in Spanish. Everyone begins to cry
 and do not notice that a young man is trying to peer into your coffin.
 This must be Los Crazy Mexican!!! Hadn't someone warned you about him?!
 Bewildered, your loved ones watch as Los Crazy Mexican opens your
 coffin.  Your corpse spills out and hits the floor with an extremely
 loud, meaty "THUD!" sound.  This "THUD!" apparently awoke the Los Crazy
 Mexicans Upside-Down Burial Parlor's dog.  Startled, he leaps from the
 corner of the parlor.

 * If the dog starts humping your family's legs and pissing on your
   carcass, go to [72].
 * If the dog begins to devour your dead body, go to [73].

 [66] (Vyrus)

        "So, you wish to kill Hitler? Are you stupid? This is the 90's,
 you fucking moron. And you're stuck in a badly written B-Movie by a 
 Quintin Tarentino wanna be@!"

        Screams.  Blackness.

        You faintly remember passing out and waking up where John
 Dillinger had pointed a highly advanced sniper rifle in your face.

        Unfortunately for you, John Dillinger is still there and he
 proceeds to take your face off with the butt of his shotgun.

 * If you pick your face back up and smush it back on your skull,
   go to [68].
 * If you use your Boy Scout WannabeMachete to hack HIS face off and
   put it on your skull, go to [69].

 [67] (Vyrus)

        "NOBODY DOG-NAPPED MY POODLE BITCH@!  THAT WAS A TRICK!@#  ALL
 HAIL HITLER AND NOW YOU DIE LIKE THE MUCASY POND SCUM YOU ARE@!"

	You look at Dr. Debonaire like he's some kind of fucking weirdo,
 and he seems taken aback.  Like, you were supposed to flinch or
 something?

        "Fuck you, d00d. I trade warez. I don't do investigations for
 flamers in velvet red chairs. Your bitch gives good head though."

        BLAMMO.  You're dead.  Dr. Debonaire decided that his bitch
 giving you head wasn't a good thing at all.

	Either that or he just didn't like you.

	THE FUCKING END.

 [68] (Oeb)

        You quickly reach down to grab your face and smush it back on
 your skull. Success! The blood dried and clotted just perfectly to hold
 a permanently disgruntled visage.  You, however, realize that John
 Dillinger is still there and still holding a shotgun -- with intent of
 using it.  You think about pleading for mercy, but what good would it
 do, your face is permanently marked, "pissed off."

        John Dillinger promptly sticks the barrel of the gun in your
 mouth and pulls the trigger removing the head you had just affixed your
 face onto.  And you're sad because life goes on.  You end.

 [69] (Avenger)

	You now notice the little boy masturbating in the corner, who has 
 eluded your view this entire time.  He looks rather happy, and you ask 
 him for a $20 to buy some crack.

        "Fuck you, jizzsniffer; I've had enough of all your shit; I'm
 friends with some powerful people, you know!  Richard Nixon, Hillary
 Clinton, and Marcia Brady, just to name a few!"  

	The boy masturbates angrily, to emphasize his words.

        You find this rather funny, and decide to hack something.
 Finding nothing to hack, you decide to giggle.  yeah.  giggle.
   
 * If you choose to giggle like a schoolgirl, go to [63].
 * If you choose to giggle like a random blunt object, go to [70].

 [70] (Avenger)

        You giggle like a random blunt object.  In this case, an 80-lb.
 UNIX manual.  For no good reason, you hear the theme to Rocky IV.  Rocky 
 ambles towards you.

        "hey!  i'm here to save philadelphia!" rocky mutters as he punches
 the small masturbating boy's foot.  You decide to ponder why donuts have
 a hole in them.  For desperate guys to fuck?  As necklaces for very small 
 Swedes?

        Richard Nixon and Rocky decide to have an apocalyptic conflict.
 Oh well, something to pass time.

        Hmm.  This is pretty fucked up.  You wonder who invented the
 donut.  You wonder why Rocky has a black eye, 30 years after the filming
 of the movie.  

 * If you choose to watch Rocky XV and eat paste, go to [71].
 * If you choose to molest Richard Nixon and be extremely confused,
   go to [99].

 [71] (Cstone)

        You grab a random jar of paste and settle down to watch Rocky XV.
 (Fortunately, it's been years since you've seen any of the Rocky movies,
 so you're entertained by the movie.)  You're so engrossed that you don't
 notice the peeling red toxic chemical warning label on the jar of paste,
 and you mistake the burning nausea from the toxins for hunger pains.
 You die.  The end.

 [72] (Ior)

        as the dog pisses on your corpse, you suddenly feel strange
 urges, and are surprised as you reawaken as a vampire!  you waste no
 time in making the dog your vampire slave, and proceed to the rest of
 your family.  you manage to take out your asshole step-father first
 (you've always had a thing about him), but as you step towards your
 religious-nut cousin, he pulls out a cross and drives you back!  since
 you're still not used to your new vampire body, you stumble over your
 own feet and fall backwards onto a strategically placed wooden stake.
 your body burns up and you know no more.  the end.

 [73] (Kyst)

        The dog ravenously tears through your rotting flesh.  Los Crazy
 Mexicans Upside-Down Burial Parlor apparently didn't bother to use
 embalming fluid on you which explains the smell of the place at least.
 The beast rips you limb from limb, scattering your remains all over
 your family who shriek with disbelief.  The hungry dog shakes you around
 like a rag-doll, splattering your stringy, gooey remains onto the walls
 of Los Crazy Mexicans Upside-Down Burial Parlor in this botched attempt
 to lay your weary body to rest.  The end.

 [74] (LilNilHil)

        You quickly snap back to your senses and realize you are banging
 Gary Coleman.  Slowly you extract yourself from Gary as to not anger his
 washed-up security gaurd ass.  This does not work, Gary pulls out a gun,
 the army men pull out more guns, and lot's of people die.  Including
 your lame, homophobic asshole.  No one misses you.  The end.

 [75] (Miasma)

        This dream-like state enables you to go back in time in your
 mind.  You see yourself floating past masturbatory experiments with Pop
 Rocks when you were 15, masturbatory experiments with Puddles, the
 neighborhood dog, when you were 14 and masturbatory experiments with two
 gallons of peach Jello just a couple of days ago.  You finally make your
 way back to the time you got too scared to kiss Melissa Dicter on the
 lips.  There she is standing, wearing a baby tee clinging to her ripe
 breasts exposing her firm nipples pointing out at you, inviting you,
 and she's also wearing a pair of jeans hugging ever curve of her body.
 "Oh God, take me NOW!" she screams at you, her chest heaving, her body
 yearning.

 * If you want to grab her, rip off her clothes, and whip out your
   member, go to [79].
 * If you want to tell her "I dunno... what would my mommy say?",
   go to [80].

 [76] (LilNilHil)

        You begin to see visions of large bouncing percentage symbols
 singing the oompa loompa song.

        "This is not good... oh shit," you say, just as a large
 percentage shaped creature jumps out at you.  He has a schlong that can
 knock over trucks, he's more pissed off than your father was that night
 at the Browns game, and he's just a bubblin' wif snot.  His name is
 Mister Walltits, and he wants your money.  Now.

 * If you would like to pay Mister Walltits, go to [77].
 * If you would like Mister Walltits to go fuck himself, go to [78].

 [77] (g0ff)

        Checking your inventory, you realize that you have 251 gold, an
 uncursed piece of violet glass, a +2 bullwhip, a tripe ration, and a
 cheap plastic imitation of the Amulet of Yendor.  You drop the gold and
 walk away, and the hallucinogen-distorted wood-elf takes the money.

        At that point, you decide to head upstairs and get yourself out
 of the dungeon.  On your way up, you find a temple to Quetzacoatl
 (Lawful) and decide to take up service as a priest of Quetzacoatl.  You
 live reasonably happy ever after.

        The end.

 [78] (Miasma)

        You turn to this putrid piece of elephant dung and scream "Why
 don't you go fuck yourself, Mister Walltits!"  He looks at you pensively.
 "Thank you, my good man, thank you.  I think I will go fuck myself," he
 replies.  He takes his gigantic schlong... whips it around and inserts
 it into one of his percentage sign holes.  Your eyes explode from this
 impossible and ludicrous site.  Your brain hemorrhages, and after you
 die, Mister Walltits makes sweet love to your dead carcass.  The end.

 [79]  (Soybean)

        You go to whip out your throbbing, rock-hard wand of light, only
 to find it breaking off in your hands.  Melissa's shrieks in fear, her
 nipples retreat back into her clingy polyester shirt, and you realize
 your last shot at becoming a real, sexual human being is lying
 shriveled, becoming colder and greyer, in the palm of your shaking hand.
 You collapse in angry, frightened tears -- sobbing so hard you begin to
 hyperventilate.  No oxygen is entering your lungs!!!!  You die!  The end.

 [80] (g0ff)

        You remember that your hat says "WWMS", but, forgetting that it
 actually stands for "Wild Warez MEoW Society", think to yourself, "What
 would mommy say?"  Mommy would say, "Clean up your room," "Do the dishes,
 please," or "Don't forget about your homework."

        Realizing that all these concepts arise from the adage "Finish
 what you've started," you decide that your mother really would have
 wanted you to kiss Melissa.  You throw your arms around her and get in
 one brief kiss which lasts but a brief moment.

        While the kiss is brief, your relationship and love maintain
 themselves throughout the rest of your lives, and you and Melissa
 continue to walk the path of life in happy bliss, staying forever away
 from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, sports, cheerleaders, and those who
 form cliques.

        The end.

	You are weary at last of this ancient world

	Sheperdess O Eiffel tower whose fock of bridges bleats
	this morning 

	You are tired of living in this Greek and Roman Antiquity

	Here even automobiles look old
	Only religion remains fresh religion
	as simple as hangars at the airfield

	Alone in Europe you Christianity are not antique
	The one modern European is you Pope Pius X 
	And you whom windows watch what shame keeps you 
	From enterting a church and confessing your sins this morning
	Handbills catalogue advertisements that sing aloud
	Furnish your morning's poetry and for prose there are newspapers
	Dime detective novels packed with adventure
	Biographes of great men a thousand and one titles 

	This morning I saw a fine stree whose name slips my mind
	New and bright the sun's trumpet
	Where executives and workers sweet stenographers
	Hurry every weekday dawn and night
	Three times a morning sirens groan
	A choleric bell barks at noon
	Lettering on billboards and walls
	Doorplates and posters twitter like parakeets
	Charm is in this Paris factory street
	Between rue Aumont-Thievelle and the avenue des Ternes

	Here is a young street and you still a small child
	Your mother dresses you only in blue and white
	You are very pious and with your oldest friend Rene Dalize
	You like nothing so much as the ceremonies of the church
	Nine o'clock the gass turns blue you slip out of bed
	You pray all night in the school chapel
	While an eternal adorable amethyst depth
	Christ's flaming halo revolves forever
	He is the lovely lily we all worship
	He is the red-haired torch no wind may blow out 
	Pale and scarlet son of the sorrowful mother
	Tree hung with prayer
	Twofold gallows of honor and eternity
	Six-pointed star 
	A God who dies on Friday and rises on Sunday
	Christ who flies higher than the aviators
	And holds the world's record for altitude 

	Christ pupil of the eye 
	Twentieth pupil of the centuries he knows his business
	And changed to a bird this century ascends like Jesus

	They say if it flies call it a flyer 
	Angels fly past the graceful trapeze artist

	Hover near the original airplane
	Or give place to those whom the Eucharist elevates
	Priests rising continuously as they raise the Host
	At last the plane lands with wings outspread 
	Through heaven come flying a million swallows
	At full speed crows owls falcons
	Ibises flamingoes storks from Africa 
	Roc so celebrated in song and story 
	Clutching Adam's skull the original head 
	Eagle from the horizon pounces screaming 
	Hummingbird arrives from America 
	From China long supple pihis 
	Who have only one wing and fly in tandem 
	Here comes the dove immaculate spirit
	Escorted by lyrebird and ocellated peacock 
	That funeral pyre the phoenix engendering himself 
	Momentarily viels all with his ardent ash 
	Sirens quit their perilous perches 
	And arrive each singing beautifully 
	Everyone eagle phoenix pihis
	Fraternizes with the flying machine 

	Now you stride alone through the Paris crowds 
	Busses in bellowing herds roll by 
	Love's anguish tights in your throat
	As if you could never be loved again 
	In the old days you would have entered the monastery
	With shame you ctch yourself praying 
	Or jeer and your laughter crackles like hellfire 
	It sparks gild the depths of your life 
	Which like a painting in a somber museum
	You approach sometimes to peer at closely 

	Today you stroll through Paris the women are all covered in blood
	It was and I would prefer not to remember it was in beauty's decline

	From fervent flames Our Lady gazed down on me in Chartres
	Your Sacred Heart's blood drowned me in Montmarte 
	I am sick of hearing pleasant words
	My love is a shameful sickness 
	You are sleepless anguished but possessed by an image 
	Which hovers never distant

	Now you are by the Mediterranean 
	Under lemon trees that flower all year long
	With your friends you board a ship
	One from Nice one from Menton two from La Turbie
	We see terrified in the depths giant squid
	And fish the Savior's symbols gliding through seaweed

	You are in a tavern near Prague
	You feel happy instad of writing your stories in prose
	You stare at a rose on the table and a 
	rosebug asleep in the rose's heart

	Horrified you trace your likeness in the agates of Saint Vitus
	You almost died of grief that day you saw yourself portrayed
	as Lazarus blinded by daylight
	The hands of the clock in the Jewish quarter run backwards
	You also slowly creep backwards through life
	Climbing to the Hradchen listening at twilight
	To Czech songs from the taverns 

	You are in Marseilles among piles of watermellons

	You are in Coblenz at the Giant's hotel 

	You are in Rome sitting under a Japanese medlar tree 

	You in Amsterdam with a girl you find pretty but who is ugly
	And engaged to a student from Leyden
	One can rent rooms there in Latin Cubuicula locanda
	I remember three days there and three at Gouda 

	You are in Paris arraigned before the judge
	Arrested like a criminal

	You went on sad and merry journeys
	Before growing aware of lies and old age
	Love made you unhappy at twenty again at thirty
	I have lived like a fool and wasted my youth
	You no longer dare examine your hands and at any moment I could 
	  weep 
	Over you over her whom I love over all that has frightened you

	With tears in your eyes you see the poor emigrants 
	Who have faith in God and pray the mothers nurse their children
	Their smell fills the waiting room at the gare St. Lazare 
	Like the three kings they believe in a star 
	Hope to strike it rich in ARgentina
	And return home wealthy
	One family carries a crimson quilt as you carry your heart
	Quilt and our dreams are equally unreal
	Some of these emigrants stay on and lodge
	In slums on the rue des Rosiers or the rue des Ecouffes 
	I have seen them often walking at dusk 
	They keep close to home like chessmen
	And are mostly Jewish their wives wear wigs 
	Pallid they sit at the back of little shops 

	You stand at the counter of a dirty bar 
	You have a coffee for two sous with the other riffraff

	You are in a huge restaurant at night 
	These women are not evil only wornout 
	Each has made her lover suffer even the ugliest 

	Who is the daughter of a policeman on the Isle of Jersey

	Her hands which I had not noticed are calloused and cracked

	The scars on her belly fill me with immense pity 

	I humble my mouth by offering it to a poor slut with a horrible laugh

	You are alone when morning comes
	Milkmen clink bottles on the street
	
	Night leaves like a lovely Metive
	Ferdine the false or watchful Lea

	You sip a liquor that burns like your life
	Your life you drain like an eau-de-vie 

	You stride home to Auteuil
	To sleep among your fetishes from Oceania or Guinea
	Other forms of Christ and other faiths 
	Lesses Christ of lesser aspirations

	Adieu Adieu 

	The sun a severed neck

	THE END
