 ok, well, let me say something. 

 i've seen like 24 different pictures of her now. some were supposed to be
 "before" and some were supposed to be "after." 

 let's say she's a well-sized B cup. depending on the malleability of her
 breasts and the sort of brazierre she's wearing, she could either look like
 an A or a C/D.

 in the pictures where she's big'n'round, she's obviously wearing a bra that
 simply shapes her that way. and it's obviously padded in a roundabout
 fashion.

 in your "before" picture, i would assume that she's either not wearing a
 bra, or she's wearing one that gives her lots of room. so there is still
 some mass of breast there, it's just hanging lower and therefore is flatter.

 in the other picture, your "after" picture, she is likely wearing a bra that
 holds her breasts up, i.e. the cup is higher on her chest, allowing the mass
 of her breasts to stick outwards more.

 in conclusion, i definitely don't think that she is anything more than a
 middle-class C, and would assume that she is simply a B. i don't think that
 she ever got implants, because her breasts simply aren't of that sort of
 shape and/or malleability. she may have grown more since she first entered
 the music industry, because that sort of thing happens. she may have gone
 from a low B to a high B, or to a low C.

 i also assume that her breasts are not very perky, and are much more on the
 flabby side. for instance, if she stood up straight with decent posture with
 no bra or shirt on, they would form flabby circles on her chest and would
 not stick out more than an inch. but, if there is enough mass there, which i
 assume there is, these breasts can be shaped into a number of different
 forms. they can be pushed way up, like the picture of her in her bedroom --
 then it looks like she's just popping out of her bra. that is, basically,
 what she is doing. there is just enough breast in her bra to not show
 nipple, and the rest of it has been pushed out as to be visible. 

 they can lay flat, making her look not as endowed, when in fact they have
 _mass_ but not _perk_ -- i.e. your "before" picture. 

 they can be put on a shelf-bra, i.e. your "after" picture. 

 they can be cupped with padding, i.e. the "concert" picture where they look
 very round and firm with nipples showing. a lot of that is padding, and the
 rest is achieved through shaping mechanisms.

 why the malleability, you ask? being from the south, she was perhaps a bit
 chunky as a child. this chunk helped her breasts to develop beyond what
 their normal size would have been, due to extra fatty deposits resting
 there. these fatty deposits are spaced apart, making her breasts less firm
 but more sizable. to quote a song, "you can tie 'em in a knot, you can tie
 'em in a bow, you can throw 'em over her shoulder, like a continental
 soldier." she lost weight when she became more of a sex symbol, leaving her
 with sizable hips, a narrow waist, and a mass of breastage. 

 so. 

 uhmm, i already said "in conclusion". i should probably go back and take
 that out.

 so, she ain't small, she ain't big, she is natural, she ain't perky, she
 uses bras creatively, she has flabby mass. 

 uh-huh.

 (p.s. my whole life has led up to this point, when i have been able to
 openly theorize about a girl's breasts. yeehaw)
