[04:15PM] [mOaCID:morpheus@net] I NEED HOES!@!
        
   I turned 18 today, April 4th 1995. I'm an adult now. Really makes you
think about your life, past, present, and future. I can't believe that their
have been days over the last 4 years were I have deprived myself of an  
education to work on my BBS. What in gods name was I thinking? I can't
believe their are kids out there who are risking a police record, severe 
punishment, or something else just to make a few phone calls. Trust me, when 
I graduate college, the fact that I ran the best HPAVC board in the 911 
area code will get me nowhere but my police record for computer crime, may 
prohibit me from going somewhere.

[03:47PM] [rush_2:JDOE@all.ptd.net] your all little faggot lamers aren't you
          god you are so fucking mature... and I thought the computer world
          was filled with people above the lameness wiggers niggers spics of
          the normal world... your all losers
        
   You couldn't hit the nail more square on the head. We're all losers.
Let's face it. Some of us spend more then an hour a day sitting in front of
their computer, doing things, that really, are not productive. You may say
it's a hobby, and I guess it is, but sitting in front of your computer is
about as healthy as watching TV is. And then there are those who take it way
too seriously. Is forwarding someone's calls to some foreign country because
you have a personal grudge against them normal? Would anyone even consider
it cool or funny? Well, it's not. It's immature, it stupid, and you're even
lamer when you get caught. 

[04:33PM] [Mopus:Ifgi327@facsmf.utexas.edu] you see ive developed this
          unhealthy attachment to my computer.

   Go outside! Go do homework! Do something besides staring glassy-eyed at a
computer screen and giving yourself carpal-tunnel syndrome from typing.
People who make fun of you because you like computers has every right to.
Why do I say that? Because they go out on the weekends. And my money says 
that most of you don't. I feel sorry for you.

[03:44PM] [sG:Mang@cris.com] All Niggerz should just go back to africa where
          they belong...their the reason this nation is as bad as it is.

   Another funny thing is how tough you all are behind your computer screen.
I thought that there were very few racists until I get my first modem. I
highly doubt that all you skinheads, punks, and homosexual are how you say
you are in real life. You lie! All of you do it, hell, I do it. I'm
motherfucking Don Juan, but that still doesn't erase the fact how stupid the
"underground scene" is becoming. Am I the only one that feels this way? Do
you all really smoke pot? Do you all really have sex everyday? Or do you all
really sit home and watch to much TV? Probably the latter.

[10:18PM] [Valgamon:valgamon@ixc.net] I just want to be different like
          everyone else - King Missile

   This has to be the best quote ever. It just perfectly sums up this
generation that's been dubbed as "X". Read it. We all wanna be different yet,
we are all the same cause we wanna be different. Ironic?

[12:58AM] [Valgamon] YOU'LL ALL LOOK BACK IN A FEW YEARS AND RELIZE THAT 
                    YOU HAVE WASTED WHAT SHOULD BE THE BEST TIME OF YOUR 
                    LIFE ON COLORY BLOCKS AND WAREZ@@@@ - Nitro-187 10/2/94

   I guess I am a hypocrite.  I just sat here for an hour or so editing up my
log files, typing a file, and doing some other stuff. But that's okay. I just
had a great time with about 10 friends celebrating my birthday. I'm 18! I'm a
goddamn adult. To be quite honest, I think I'm done with the "scene". Someone
said to me, which I didn't log, "if it's not fun anymore it defeats the whole
purpose." That's perfect. I think alot of people take things way to serious.
I guess some of you are going to be our next Bill Gates', but there is so
much out there in the world that you can't experience by sitting in front of
a computer. It would be ashamed if you missed out on it. I think this may be
the last time that anyone who doesn't have my phone number hears from me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This t-file was originally going to be about interesting or funny /msgs
that I received on the internet. Well, I changed my mind. Why you ask? Well,
I kinda made my decision after eavesdropping on a 11PM Sunday Night
Teleconfrence. It was kinda funny actually. They were attacking me because
of an incident were I ripped someone else's ansi. I don't deny it. I like to
go out on the weekend nights. If someone needs an ansi done for their board,
and they ask me, then I'm going to do it. Even if it takes using someone
elses art. Sysops don't care where it came from, they just want the goddamn 
ad for their board. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and spend 5+
hours on a picture like some artists out there do now. I'll be damned
if I spend 30 minutes ripping someone elses art. It's a waste of time. You 
can call me a loser or lamer all you want for doing it, but guess what,
on Saturday and Friday night when you are setting up and sitting on a 
conference, I'm out having fun. Give me a call sometime, maybe I'll pick you
up, or just laugh in your face. Well, these were some of the original quotes
that people /msg'ed me. My favorite ones I used above, some humorous ones and
some deep meaningful ones are below. I hope you enjoyed what you've read so
far and what you will soon read. And maybe you'll do some thinking. If not, 
then sucks to be me, huh?
