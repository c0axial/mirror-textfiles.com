  You know, I have been thinking a lot lately. I don't really like thinking,
but no matter how hard I try not to think, I am always thinking about not
thinking. Some times as I write, I wonder if any one really reads my files.
I mean, I know you are right now, but how do I know that you are not the only
one. I don't.  I showed some of my writing to my friend Kim the other day.
She accused me of being deep. I never wanted to be deep. When I was being
configured, I did not select the option of being deep. Is every one deep? 
Every one thinks, don't they? So are the deep ones, the ones who express 
their fealings and the shallow ones the ones who don't? I just don't know.

  Do deaf people think? When I think, I can hear words, but they are deaf, so
how do they hear their thoughts. Can they hear their thoughts. If they can
then they aren't completly deaf are they? What do sounds taste like? When
deaf people go deaf, their other sences grow to make up for the loss, So can 
they taste sounds? Can they see sounds?

  Do you think socity is twisted? Do you think their reality is false, and 
yours is true, or the opposite? If the water in people was to evaporate, 
what would the 20% be, that is left over? The body is 80% water right? How 
do they know that? Did they stick a person in a giant vaporizer, and trace
the elements in the stem?  Was the person alive? How old was he? Was he a he?
DId he take a bath with in the last hour of his death?

  If you took a shower, would it effect the 80% water theroy. If so, what 
happened to the 20% portion? Did it just disappear? Did you realize that no
matter what, even if you could stand the heat, we could never dig to China?
Look:                       
                         a  <-United States
                         1   <-Point 1
                         0  <-core of earth
                         2   <-Point 2
                         b  <-China

  Once you got to the core, you could not continue going down to China,
because on the flip side of the core, gravity would pull you right back to
the core. You couldn't go back to the U.S. because it would pull you down 
again. 

  When we move, how come our body doesn't slosh around. How come blood can
defy gravity when it is being pumped to the head, with one heart muscle, 
but yet when I flap my arms with all my muscles, I can not fly. Is it because
blood is a liquid? If so how come the oceans don't spill into the sky?

  Remember HOE-20? Well, at the end, it had that funkadelic little play. I
was wondering if their is in immplied meaning behind it. In the cast, the
HoeOp Lucifer represents the devil. But in reality, Lucifer is supposed to 
be a demon, a duke of hell, or the devil (Depending on the religion). Hmm,
Could Lucifer be the devil?  Is their a secret implied meaning that Casper 
and Haywood are feds? Could Jungle Jimmy be a ancient old woman narc that is
gathering information to arrest us all?

  Am I real dumb? Am I a loser? It did say on it, and I quote, "Warning: If 
you take this seriously, then you are a loser. This is fictional too, in 
case you were really dumb." Is this just a sign to throw us off the track?

  I have been thinking, Maybe it is all true, and that Mogel (The writer of 
it) wanted to inform us, Because he knew. Maybe he had to put the warning in 
before the HoeOps would distrubute it, in fear of the H/P/Aer's of the scene 
finding out. 

  I have been thinking, maybe it is all a dream. Maybe I'm just paranoid. 
Could it be I am a thought of a fish in a bowl? How do we know that we are 
not just some giant's pets. The universe is a real big fish tank. The world, 
is a peice of bacteria... and of course, we are just one the equivlent of a 
once celled organism. Will we ever know?

  I have been thinking, and now I know it's true, Paranoia is a good thing -
Mr. Sandman [BGR], has told me too. Cursed by the ability to think damned 
thoughts, I must continue living, until the whole earth rots.
