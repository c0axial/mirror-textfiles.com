	I had a really shitty last few days.  So I'm venting.

	OK.  What's with Kraft macaroni and cheese.  When you cook it, add
 the cheese, it tastes AWESOME.  30 minutes later, the taste disappears.  
 POOF.  Where does it go???  Last night I cooked a box of the Deluxe
 macaroni and cheese, went to watch TV.  I come back, and it's right where
 I left it, however now that it's room temperature, the flavor and the
 cheesiness is COMPLETELY gone.  I don't get it.  It's the same way if you
 stick it in the refrigerator. POOF. It's never the same.  I don't fucking
 get it.

	Somebody explain to me where the fuck the fucking cheesy goodness
 goes??? Is there a Kraft Fairy that removes the cheesiness from the
 leftover amount when you walk away?!?  I am hereby releasing my
 hypothesis of the disappearing properties of cheesiness in macaroni and
 cheese out of a box.

                                 C = O/ T 

	Where C (Current Cheesiness Factor) is equal to the quotient of O
 (Original Cheesiness Factor) and T (Time since you cooked it)

	Why is it that old people drive so badly?? It's one thing to drive
 slow, but some of them are just TERRIBLE.  This one old lady was doing 25
 in an ACCELERATION lane getting on the highway.  She almost killed
 herself and everyone behind her by hitting her BRAKES by getting on the
 highway.  So I beeped at her for being a dipshit.  AND SHE BEEPED BACK!!
 LIKE I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

	Or you are driving down the road, and someone pulls out in front
 of you like they are in a rush, but do UNDER the speed limit.  What the
 fuck?  They couldn't wait 5 seconds until I passed?  Truck drivers don't
 do that shit to people normally Because they know how much they hate it
 happening to them.

	What's with people that smoke marijuana habitually.  OK, I hate to
 quote that cheezy movie Clueless, but "It's one thing to get blazed at a
 party, but spending your whole life stoned out of your mind is another".
 I have a certain number of friends that have to smoke weed before they do
 ANYTHING. You go to a movie, they have to smoke first It's almost
 ridiculous.  It seems they have to spark a blunt before they take a sip
 of water and shit.  Is reality really so bad that you can't bear to be
 sober for 5 fucking minutes of their lives.  Since when do middle class
 white kids living in rural New Jersey have it so fucking rough?  
 Marijuana is ruining *MY* life, never mind theirs. Marijuana makes them
 habitually late, lethargic, and retarded. Perhaps I should find some new
 friends.  Maybe Mogel will be my friend. MOGEL WILL YOU BE MY NEIGHBOR??

	And last on my list of rage, what's with that shitty E-Zine
 H0e????  Man, fuck that shit.
