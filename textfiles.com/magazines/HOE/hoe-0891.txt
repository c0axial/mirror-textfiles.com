 <Nybar> on Ragnarok, THE-BOT will come back
 <Nybar> with his two brothers: bosplaya the fenris wolf, and BDBil
 <Nybar> and Gregoryt will devour Mogel whole
 <Nybar> only to be avenged by Jubjub, his son
 <Nybar> but the forces of the haunted lamers will defeat the stout defenders
         of the #ezines bridge
 <Nybar> and destroy the 2 worlds
 <Nybar> the hogs over ethiopia will then fall
 <Nybar> this is my prophecy.
 <Nybar> yum
 <JUDAS> Nybar
 <Nybar> eh?
 <JUDAS> I got ICE CREAM FOR CROW
 <Nybar> good, how do you like it, dawg?
 <JUDAS> because you wouldn't shut up about how dope is it 
 <JUDAS> It's DOOOOOOOPE
 <Nybar> haha, I told you
 <JUDAS> But I think, as of yet, I still like uh
 <JUDAS> another album better
 <JUDAS> but i can't remember the name 
 <JUDAS> hahh
 <Nybar> Doc at the Radar Station?
 <JUDAS> No.
 <Nybar> Shiny Beast?
 <JUDAS> oh
 <JUDAS> Lick my decals off, baby
 <JUDAS> Unfortunately, I can't HEAR IT
 <JUDAS> because my MP3s are fried
 <JUDAS> because my SOUND CARD is baked
 <JUDAS> because windows stopped support SOUND
 <Nybar> hahahaha
 <JUDAS> The thing I find most disappointing about ICE CREAM FOR CROW
 <Nybar> my only problem with Ice Cream for Crow is that it's too short
 <JUDAS> is how little singing the Captain does 
 <JUDAS> and how much Billy Holiday "singtalking" he does 
 <JUDAS> At the end of her Career, 
 <JUDAS> Billy Holiday really stopped singing 
 <JUDAS> and just started talking in this very musical way 
 <JUDAS> which the CAPTAIN does on some of these songs
 <JUDAS> however, it's a minor complaint
 <JUDAS> hahaha, actually, I've really really been getting inot that reissue
         of SAFE AS MILK
 *** Nybar changes topic to 'You have now entered the 9th chamber...'
 <Nybar> really? maybe I should get it...
 <Nybar> I only have the weird trippy version
 <JUDAS> It's got a ton of weird extra tracks on it 
 <JUDAS> mainly instrumentals
 <JUDAS> but they're DOOOOOOPE
 <Nybar> the instrumentals on Ice Cream for Crow are _sick_
 <JUDAS> and the non-instrumental tracks are really fucking weird
 <JUDAS> Yeah, they're some of the best I've heard
 <JUDAS> Ice Cream for Crow ones, that is 
 <Nybar> they ah made me want to learn to play the slide guitar back in the
         day
 <JUDAS> You're right, it's far too short
 <Nybar> if Ice Cream for Crow had like, 5 more songs that matched the
         quality of the rest of the album
 <Nybar> it'd be the motherfucking, uh, uncontested hall of fame album
 <JUDAS> hahaha doud, I am really hurting for unconditionally guaranteed
 <JUDAS> I've been feeling those love songs lately
 <Nybar> heehee, unconditionally guaranteed _is_ suprisingly good
 <Nybar> have you heard Strictly Personal?
 <JUDAS> I think so. 
 <JUDAS> But not recently enough to remember it
 <Nybar> hmm...I remember at one point I listened to the first instrumental
         on Ice Cream for Crow so much that I was having weird thoughts like
         "yes...Truly, this is the only way it could end, not on that false
         sad note!"
 <JUDAS> hahahahaha
 <JUDAS> You're nuts
 <JUDAS> That's really an insane thought
 <Nybar> Strictly Personal is some early jazz/blues sheot
 <JUDAS> the guy who runs beefheart.com seems to think Lick My Decals Off,
         Baby is going to be re-released soon
 <Nybar> "WOO, I AIN'T GOT THE BLUES NO MOH" <harmonica solo>
 <JUDAS> hahahahah
 <JUDAS> How many times can he say "Poop"?
 <Nybar> heh, as many as he wants
 <Nybar> he's da captain
 <JUDAS> lick my decals off, Tori Amos, and these Beck radio shows
 <JUDAS> were all I listened to at my last job
 <JUDAS> damn, I love those beck radio shows
 <JUDAS> they've got some of the best material I've ever heard 
 <JUDAS> and it's all totally unreleased
 <JUDAS> and will never be released
 <Nybar> heehee, I wish I could go back in time with Ashtray Heart
 <Nybar> and go to a Captain Beefheart show
 <JUDAS> Yeah hahaha
 <JUDAS> That guy's time machine is probably in the shape of a gigantic trout
         mask
 <JUDAS> I just imagine that Ashtray Heart has placed a poster of Don Van
         Vliet over his bed,
 <JUDAS> so he can pretend he's looking in the mirror when he has sex
 <Nybar> ahahahahahaha
