	Another friday night with nothing to do, mall ratting was done, 
and the five of us decided to go to the playground to hang out.  It was a 
suburban town, actually, more of an instant suburb that developers could 
create just down the road from a city that made it so appealing to home 
buyers.  The playground gate was busted, and I suppose that the city was 
busy tonight, because the Police hadn't been by to hassle us.  They knew we 
weren't vandalizing, they just wanted to bust our stones.  Assholes. 
	It was November, and I was glad the sticky summer months had passed. 
I could finally wear my battle armor, my leather jacket.  It got later, and 
none of us had nothing else to say.  Tony and Dan decided to split, and 
Vicki volunteered to walk Dan home.  Slut.  I always hated her.  Tony had 
met her at a party in the city one night, and fucked the shit out of her in 
the basement.  He later came to regret it, as she was constantly pestering 
him, and wanting to hang out with us.  It wasn't that she was all that bad 
of a person, but she sometimes would say things that were stupid, and out of 
place.  Tony quickly set her straight, that there would be no relationship, 
no house on a hill, no station wagon with kids and a dog.  She said that she 
didn't care, that she liked hanging out with us, and that she finally felt 
somewhere that she belonged. Great.  At least SHE felt that she belonged.  
Now she was moving on Dan, what a joke of a person she was.  
	The night was winding down, and morning would be upon us in a few 
minutes.  The sky was beginning to lighten, and the black was turning a 
lighter shade of purple. Chuck and Joey were out cold, leaning against the 
base of some monkey bars.  Noise was picking up, and birds were stirring.  
In the distance I could hear their morning song.  
	I didn't know that it would be thier mourning song.  
	The volunteer fire company's siren went off, and there was a clamor 
among the houses that lined the opposite side of the street adjacent to the 
playground.  Joey's eyes blearily opened,  and he smacked Chuck in the head 
to stir him.  A loving bunch we were.  The activity seemed to be coming from
the city, so we picked our selves up off the ground, and walked to the 
soccer field for a view of what was going on.  Maybe a riot, or more likely 
a large fire.  There was a slow rumbling coming from the other field, that 
grew increasingly more disturbing.  At first I thought it be an earthquake, 
until I saw that it was centered at the pitcher's mound of the softball 
field.  
	The ground opened in a perfect circle, and swallowed the dirt.  The 
rumbling was overshadowed by a whirring noise, and the opening grew to about 
20 feet across.  The top of a huge steel girder assembly was being hoisted 
from inside the hole, and the tip of a missle rose from the opening.  This 
was not happening.  This whole nuclear missile annihilation scenario was 
done with 5 years ago.  It went out with Reagan.  The big bomb, the Cold 
War, it was all a memory. WHAT THE FUCK WAS HAPPENING?!  We ran.  It was a 
pointless gesture, but we ran from the rising missile silo.  
	With a deafening shreik, the missile launched, and the sonic boom 
threw us to the dirt of the field.  The three of us stood stone faced as we 
saw it sail into the sky, and disappear through the clouds.  Chuck was 
ranting, but it seemed a million miles away.  Tony pointed to the 
sillhouette of the city and muttered "look."  Chuck was silenced and the 
sillhouette was enveloped by a super nova of light.  It was just like the 
news footage that I remembered seeing as a child.  The desert testing 
sights, and the mushroom cloud.  Now it was here.. Strangely I was calm. 
I accepted the impending solitude, and awaited it's embrace.  It was all 
happening in slow motion.  The circular wave of unleashed energy was washing 
over the trees, and closing in.  I dropped to the ground, and lay on my back.  
Someone whispered "goodbye" as the torrent hit us.  In the millisecond that 
the energy was taking us apart I remember wondering if it would hurt.  It 
did not.  I was flung about two feet from the ground where I lay and the 
ground rose and fell away again.  It was gone.  All I saw was white.  For an 
eternity it seemed I was suspended in the white glow of nothingness, It 
faded to a pale grey, darker, darker, until it was black.  
	It was then that I realized that the nothingness was replaced by 
solid ground. I opened my eyes, and saw the faces of Chuck and Joey.  I 
wanted to dismiss the entire experience as a nightmare, but the pale etheral 
glow around my two best friends reassured me that what just happened was 
unmistakably reality.  Joey spoke to me in what seemed a foreign language.  
I began to understand what he was saying, but his voice was reverbrating 
almost mechanically.  "Wake up!  C'mon!"  I tried to speak, but there was 
nothing.  No words came from my opened mouth.  Somehow we had survived. I 
turned my head, expecting to see the ruins and dust of what was our society. 
What I saw was not that much different from the world previous to the 
eruption.  The sky was dark, almost overcast, but darker.  Almost like it is 
right before a terrible storm, but unlike the sky before a storm, there was 
no wind.  There was no sound other than my friend's reverbrating voice.  He 
saw the fear and confusion in my eyes, and began to explain.  
	"We didn't survive.  We are dead.  Not ghosts, not human, not 
anything.  We are the only ones who can see this reality.  It is almost 
another dimension.  Where we are standing, the alive ones will see ashes. 
Only those who are like us can see what we see.  This is our utopia.  We 
hoped that you would rise."  Unsure of my sanity, I stood and looked around.  
There were people everywhere, many of them lounging on thier lawns as if 
this black sky was a sunny day.  "There is no pain here." came the strangely 
mechanical voice from behind me.  "There is only ourselves.  No need for 
money, or work.  No disease, no need to eat.  The pleasures of the flesh 
sustain us."  
	I looked across the street to where I saw the woman lounging, and 
saw that she was joined by her husband, and thier neighbor.  They were 
tangled into a knot of sexual abandon, thier etheral glow brighter that they 
were joined.  I lowered my head to look at my body, and saw my glow was 
barely visable.  I was exhausted, and sat down leaning against a tree. I was 
awakened by a stunningly beautiful woman, crouching by my side.  She had 
long blonde hair that streamed over her shoulders, covering her naked 
breasts.  Her eyes seemed dark, and devoid of emotion.  Her fingertips 
glided across my arms, and she leaned in close to me.  I turned away and 
stood up, still tired after a restless sleep, and I just wanted to be alone 
to piece together what was happening.  The atrocities of sexual couplings 
that I saw gave me a nauseus feeling.  It was this very state of apathetic 
selfishness that was responsible for the genocide of much of humanity.  
     It was then that I saw the pale glow fade away from me. Again I was 
tired, and slept. I awoke to see Vicki lying by my side.  She looked 
strangely beautiful, her glow radiant, and she brushed the hair from my face.  
Her touch was tender, and her dark eyes glittered.  She kneeled and unzipped 
her denim top.  She sat on top of me, and took my hands into hers, lightly 
tracing the ends of my fingertips with her tongue.  I was lost in her touch, 
her seduction.  
	"You have no light" she whispered.  "You must feed.  You must."  At 
once the hate welled up inside me.  The hatred for her, for this place, the 
hatred that I harbored for the system that eventually gave birth to this 
iniquity.  My hatred put stregnth into me, the hatred for the society that 
fed on itself to reproduce, the society of the past, and the present. I 
pulled my hands away from her soft mouth and turned them palm up.  Both 
hands pushed through her tender skin into her abdomen, and my fists closed 
around thick muscle tissue.  She made no sound as I tore upwards, opening 
her torso like a zipper.  Her entrails spilled out onto me, covering the 
upper half of my body, the steam rising in the brisk autumn air.  Her empty 
husk of a body lost it's shimmer, but I saw her heart still pumping the 
blackish blood fruitlessly through opened veins onto my chest.  I pushed 
my hands through the slick warm viscera and pulled at the heart.  It ripped 
away and sat in my hand, pumping the last of it's black blood out.
It stopped it's pumping motion, withered and turned to ash in my hands.  
The sky erupted with a roar of thunder and a gale of wind rose up, circling 
my bloodied body.  The dust of Vicki's severed heart blew away, the wind 
swirling violently.  It licked and stung at my eyes and nose, bringing 
visions and sound to my mind. 
	The chaos of wars long forgotten, the pain of grieving widows, the 
unwritten knowledge and wisdom of centuries all entered my mind.  
The thunder grew lounder as the people paled and dropped to the ground.  
The trees, the flora of this dimension all turned to clay, then to sandy 
grit. There I stood in the dust and ashes with the secrets of a millenium, 
as the thunder roared.  
	Perhaps God gave the answers to those with nothing to say.
I saw a familiar nova of energy closing in from all sides.  Closing my eyes, 
I whispered "goodbye", doomed to witness the end of creation's cycle.  
	There was no life, and again no sound.
