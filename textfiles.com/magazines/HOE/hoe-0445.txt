        I think our country is very burried in contradictions.  In this
 one I'll focus on one specific contradiction.  The Constitution and Bill
 of Rights prevent anyone from having cruel or unusual treatment imposed
 on them by the government.  They also allow the death penalty, thus
 saying saying that death is not cruel or unusual.  Yet, for some odd
 reason, they outlaw suicide.  This seems to be in conflict to me.
 Seriously... think about it.  I can think of many people who's lives are
 cruel and unusual, not even considering those in 3rd world countries, the
 homeless, or the severly ill.  I think if genetics, social structure, or
 even god, if you believe in one, has deemed that almost the entire
 population of adolescent America be suicidal, who are we to argue?

        We've seen this many times in history.  Antigone, the ancient
 greek tradgedy deals with the subject of Man's Law Vs.  Gods' Law (The
 Greeks' Gods), or fate if you will.  It never ends well for the human
 population.  At least not those affected by the laws in question.  I
 pose this question to you: On a planet with over 6 billion people,
 that's 6,000,000,000, and a country where supposed free will, democracy,
 and personal rights prevail, do they outlaw such a humanitarian action?
 Anyone that went through public school in the past few years knows what
 it's like in there.  That's bad enough.  But if you actually show a
 glimmer of talent, natural ability, or real intelligence and find the
 work they give you menial, demoralizing, and aboce all spiteful to you
 in general, and hence refuse to do it, they deem you a slacker and a
 waste of space.  Now hold up.  This is a peaceful means to and end.  If
 one such as myself or anyone else that notices this would ever get fed
 up with it, and an actual revolt took place, you'd have some of the
 brightest, most intuitive teenagers, in their prime, against the rest
 of America's school system.

        I'm sure anyone of prominance that suffered the same thing and
 is now a grown adult would stand with us on that one.  It would be the
 dumb people Vs.  the 'gifted' people.  And I'm sorry if I sound a little
 egotistical, but with no class lines, government lines, or rules, you
 will lose.  Period.  But I stray from my topic.  If you can get some
 sense of what I'm talking about, and realize that that's not what I
 want, then you have two choices.

        1: Legalize suicide.  Sure many people consider it immoral, but
           obviously not the people that would use this law.  Otherwise
           they wouldn't use it.  Plus it would be a grand release for
           thsoe of us forced to go through such systems as the one
           above, belittled, held back, and even disciplined for their
           talents.  It's much more humanitarian.  To quote Kurt Vonnegut,
           "None of us ever asked to be born anyway."

        2: Change the school system/social structure around.  Yeah, it's
           a bit harder, but if the welfare of the general public is at
           stake, I think we can all do a little adjusting, and maybe
           even in the process, start turning out some highly intelligent
           people, like we used to.

        If you don't like what I have to say, then you just don't get it.
 If you sympathize with what I'm saying, or just want to comment either
 way, e-mail me at altrocks@op.net.   I'm not writing this out fo spite,
 or hate, or anythign else.  I just think it's about time someone said
 what needs to be said, and maybe even get some attention drawn to the
 subject.

        And whether you agree with me or not, please, pass this along to
 as many people as you can.  Thank you.
