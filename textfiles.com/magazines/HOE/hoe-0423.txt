        there was this time my friend (his name is tim!) and i were
 walking to the store down on the corner to get some candy and all the
 sudden, a giant horse fell out of the sky and landed right on TIM!  i
 couldn't believe it!  i said, "hey you fucking horse, get off my
 friend!" but it just looked at me with its big ass eyes and then rolled
 its lips back.  so i said, "punk!  feel my wrath!" and started kicking
 it in the side.  "this is for tim, you son of a bitch!" i said as i
 kicked the dumb horse.

        you wouldn't believe what happened next!

        the horse got up off of tim and said, "i am a horse!  you have
 no right to kick me."  the next thing i know, a giant cow (his name is
 ralph!) fell out of the sky and landed right on me!  it hurt like hell,
 but i said, "fucking cow, get off me!"  the cow was all dumb and shit
 and it said, "milk?  ok!" and shot a gallon of milk all over me.  "ack!
 you piece of shit!  quit squirting milk all over me and get the hell up!"

        when the cow finally did get up, i said, "it's about damn time!"  

        then i said to the horse (i don't remember what its name was),
 "hey fucker, why don't you get the hell out of here like that cow!"  the
 horse thought it was suave and shit and said, "sure!"

        well, ted and i watched the two dumb fucks walk down the street
 for a while and then we just said, "pfff!  farm animals!" and went into
 the store.  i got a pack of gum and ted got some bitter ass shocktarts.
