SHAVED FOR BATTLE (2:48)

We've had enough of this social state
Every one thinks they are better than us
They think we'll lay down and take their shit
Well you know they've got another thing coming

(Chorus)
Our Heads are shaved for battle
And thats what we're gonna do
Our doc's were made for kicking 
And they'll kick the shit out of you

Whats a matter with other Skins?
Starting fights and beating up punks
Well punks do nothing, Give us a bad name
We've gotta fight if we want to survive

Chorus

Skinhead gangs all over the world
Fight no more amongst your selves
Join together and fight for your lifes
Cuz we all know the strongest survive

Chorus

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS (1:57)

You say that we are criminals that arn't yet in jail
You'd like to see us behind the bars but we know your gonna fail
Just because we're diffrent from you, you see us as a threat
Well listen Mr. Know-it-all, you ain't seen nothing yet

(Chorus)
We're not criminals (x4)

We take the fight right to the streat and you try to get us beat
You label us the no good scum while the real scum walks the streat
Us Skinheads aint the problem, But we know we are the cure
Even if you put some of us away, there'll be more, thats for sure

Chorus

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

SKINHEADS ON THE RAMPAGE (2:56)

You see us on every TV screen, You read about us in the news
You think you've got the upper hand, but we know your gonna lose
You'd like to paint the darkest picture, but it always comes out white
The fear you keep inside of you, of us is now in sight

We've been pushed around for far too long, and put down for speaking out
We're the heros of the working class and now its time to shout
If violince is the only way we'll get to speak our minds
The blood will flow for a hundred years untill our peace we find

You'd better watch out, There's no place to hide
Stay out of our way or you're going to die
The time is now, We see the light
We're striking out, We've got the might

Skinheads on the rampage (x16)


                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  
IN THE RIGHT (1:49)

You think that you'll play us for the fool
You think that we'll follow your every rule
  We are, We are in the right
You'd like to stop us with your boys in blue
But you can't stop us no matter what you do
  We are, We are in the right

(Chorus)
You know, you know we've got the might
'Cause we are, we are in the right
You know, you know we'll win the fight
'Cause We are, We are in the right

We never get the decent jobs
They always give it to some forign slob
  We are, We are in the right
I've got to slave my life away
While some white collar faggot gets better pay

Chorus
Chorus

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

STREET KIDS (2:56)

Street Kids get of the gutter
Street Kids stop fighting with your brothers
Street Kids stop hanging in the clubs
Street Kids stop going to the pubs

...Street Kids...Street Kids

Street Kids lace your boots real tight
Street Kids get ready for the fight
Street Kids try to use your hate
Street Kids for the fight aginst the state

...Street Kids...Street Kids
...Street Kids...Street Kids

We're all Street Kids, tried and true, we're all together no matter what we do
We're all Street Kids, yes indeed, My friends provide me with all I need

We're all Street Kids, tried and true, we're all together no matter what we do
We're all Street Kids, yes indeed, My friends provide me with all I need

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

HERES ONE FOR THE LADS (1:50)

All of the boys go to a show
Every one there will be their foe
The bouncers will try to keep them out
'Cause if they get in it will be a rout

(Chorus)
Here's one for the lads Oi! Oi! Oi! (x4)

We take the stage at quarter of nine
All of the lads are feeling fine
We start a song, and the fight begins
We never lose cuz we play to win
        C'mon boys lets go!!

Chorus

We've had our fun its time to go
We've all hade one hell of a show
We used our boots, we'll use them again
Cuz they all know we play it for them!

Chorus

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

AMERICAN OI! (2:17)

Red Alert and the 4Skins were always our faviort bands
But all the bands we listened to were from foreign lands
We needed some thing to call our own, some thing to listen to
We'll borrow what they started and make it, RED, WHITE AND BLUE

(chorus)
AMERICAN OI! AMERICAN OI! Awnser to the Call
AMERICAN OI! AMERICAN OI! You know we'll never fall
AMERICAN OI! AMERICAN OI! The groundwork has been set
AMERICAN OI! AMERICAN OI! You ain't seen nothing yet!

Well now we we've got our skinhead scene, and it's as strong as it is proud
You know our bands play real hard, and you know they play it loud!
Soon there will be so many of us, Heads will turn our way
You're living your greatest nightmare, YES! We're here to stay!

(chorus)
(chorus)

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

THE POWER, AND THE GLORY (3:30)

In 1967, you went to Vietnam
Two years later, you came back, and no one gave a damn
They treated you like some kind of phreak when they should have shown respect
Now you walk around in some kind of daze, because of the horrors you met.

(chorus)
For the power, and the glory
You went to war and fought for your country
For the power and the glory
You're Veterans and this is your story

You envy the vets of WWII because they knew what they where fighting for
They had the support of a country, you had a country opposed to the war
You try to get the V.A.'s help, but too often they turn away
You sit at home and try to forget, but take hope -- You'll see your day!

(chorus)
(chorus)

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

DEDICATED (2:01)

I've seen the people suffer
For far too long
But things are looking brighter,
No more sad songs
The country is waking
From a long long sleep
The Skinheads are rising
to slaughter the sheep

(chorus)
We're dedicated
We're dedicated

Well.. Either your with us,
Or your our foe,
We want it all
We're going for broke
The youth of our country
Is awnsering the call
Lacing their boots tight
Standing tall

(Chorus x4)

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

PROUD, STRONG, AND FREE! (2:46)

Old folks say us younger folks are always afraid to fight
Well, Listen just because you fought a war, doesn't mean your right
The liberals always turn their cheek and look the other way,
If the Russians came over the border right now, i would fight the front today!

(Chorus)
We're proud, strong and free
This country was made for you and me
We're proud, strong and free
We've gotta preserve our history
We're proud, strong and free
American through and through
We're proud, strong and free
Its up to me and you!

The persian gulf is full of scum let's wipe them from the sea
If Iran wants to duke it out, Well just you wait and see,
The communists are saying that they got more human rights
But that will end so fucking fast, when we come to fight!

(chorus)
(chorus)
                        
                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

NOWHERE (3:18)

So you quit high school and think your gonna make a fortune
You ask your friends why they are wasting all their precious time
But one year laidher, you are laid off and on welfair
You see your friends on the street and you tell them your doing fine.

(Chorus)
Your going nowhere! (x4)

You got your girlfriend pregnant and you live in a one room basement
Nobody wants to hire a drop out from high school
You feel like an old man at 17, but you can't go back
You sit back and wonder, what could have been.

(Chorus)                        
                        
To get anywhere in life, you gotta finish what you start
Gotta use your head, stop thinking with your heart
Do you want to be at the bottom of the ladder for the rest of your life?
Thinking of diffrent ways to deal with your strife.
                        
(Chorus)

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

NOTHING TO FIGHT FOR ANYMORE! (1:59)

Hey you, Rich boy, look at me!
Remember when you where here with me?
We hung out right here on the streets,
now look at you all dressed and neat,
You've joined the system, they have won.
They can't catch me, I'm on the run.
You came from here, don't ever lie.
I spit on you as you pass me by.

(Chorus) 
You've nothing to fight for anymore (x4)

You sit up there in luxury,
Live a life so easily
You've made it now, Forget the past
But watch it man, it may not last
You could end up here again one day
You'd better know what i will say,
Don't think we'll except you know
Hold on to what you got right now

(Chorus)
(Chorus)

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

GANG RIOT! (1:58)

You've got your gang and i've got mine
We see things from diffrent sides
Its you v. us and us v. you
We're headed for a major duel
Others have fought and they always fail
Or the cops show up and we go to jail
We don't care if we win or lose,
Cuz its on the streets that we pay our dues

(Chorus)
GANG RIOT! Riot -- Riot! (x2)

Four gangs in our neighborhood
We always fight the way we should
Today its clubs, tommarow knives
We've got to fight for our very lives
Running through the streets at night
This isn't a case of black v. white,
They don't hate us because our heads are skin,
They hate us because we always win!

(Chorus)
(Chorus)
                        
                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  

DOC MARTEN ARMY! (2:07)

Hanging out with the boys, looking for a fight
This is what we like to do every friday night
Dirty looks from every one, every where we go
The stand so far away from us because every body knows

(Chorus)
We're the Doc Marten Army
We're the Doc Marten Army

Skin our head fresh for a show, We're ready to get down!
See policemen every where, they follow us around town
This is our town, we like to ruck, and yeah! -- RUCK WE WILL!
WANT TO STOP US? -- We'll never stop!, Till we get our fill!

(Chorus)

You hate us, and we hate you, thats a fact of life
Its our way of dealing with, all our fucking strife.
You can turn and look away, we don't give a shit.
But when we come around again, you'll have to deal with it!

(Chorus)

                        ***  ***  ***  ***  ***  ***
