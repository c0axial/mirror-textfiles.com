	Pause...

	Wait for it...

	*GASP* There it is!

	The sound of an antagonist wasting his breath!
	Nailing on them all until his last death.

	Maybe it's anger, enraged as a tease.
	But never discount homosexual tendencies.

        You realize that I automatically dislike 90% of humanity, mostly
 because of the simple fact people can't take care of them and theirs.
 Someone has always gotta make a joke of someone because they just can't look
 in the mirror.  Thats the way humor works, except the butt of the joke never
 laughs.  I've always had an issue about respect.  You don't get it until you
 earn it.  Well, in order to authorize you all in the ways of my certain
 reality, I'll give you all a few guidelines on how to be "nice".

        Easy-E said it best when he said "Bitch, shut the fuck up. Get the
 fuck outta here."  I really hate it when people start sticking their noses
 in OPP.  It's none of your goddamn business, none whatsoever.  You don't
 have the right to know my private life, and since you aren't spouting any
 relationship abuse stories you sure as FUCK don't have the right to analyze
 mine.  Keep YOUR shit to YOURself and I'll do the same.  It's just amazing
 how people just think their the greatest, when all they really are in other
 peoples eyes are just little itty bitty turds floating around in a vast
 bowl.  Your going to get flushed one day, so you might as well be a nice
 turd.  Nobody wants to flush your ass and be all "That was one bad turd."
 So don't be a shithead, ok?

        Try looking at the situation from someone elses point of view for
 a change.  Try and imagine what they would feel if you were to ignore all
 facts and requests and just start bombarding them with insults and ignorant
 remarks.  I certainly hate the feeling of being harped on by bullie-fucks, I
 don't know about you.  Yes, I have faith in you.  Yes, you *can* pull your
 head out of your ass.  Yes, you *can* start seeing value in people.  Yes,
 you can even compliment someone on a job well done.  The first step to
 conquering this problem is to admit you have one, so what I want you to do..
 is take a deep breath, look in the mirror and say "I am an asshole".  Say it
 about 10 times.  Maybe you'll start to feel a little down, looking into your
 own eyes and hearing your own voice discredit you.  You could start to
 resent yourself, or maybe become a little hate-filled.  You'll start to
 blame, shelter yourself from the blows or maybe want to become completely
 shut-off from the outside world.  Congratulations, you now know what it
 feels like to be the abused.

        Your not a bad person, I know your not.  You can use your powers of
 cynacism and sarcasm for good.  Hey, someday you might even grow up to be
 like me.  But only if you take your vitamins, study hard and quit FUCKING
 AROUND.  You're such a dickhead, an oxygen deprived waste of flesh.
 Everyone hates you so much because your such a spiteful person, and the only
 ones who do love you are people LIKE you.  With friends like that, who needs
 enemies?  I wonder if your mother beat you when you were younger or
 something.. she needed to if she didn't.  She should've drowned you like the
 retarded farm animal that you are.  I am so pissed off right now...

        Denouement
