        Once upon a time, there was a remote control.  The remote control's
 name was Teddy.  Teddy had buttons that made the television box do wonderful
 things.  Teddy loved having his buttons pushed.  Everyone loved pushing
 Teddy's buttons.

        One day, little Johnny was holding Teddy and watching the television
 box.  When his television box program was over, little Johnny pushed
 Teddy's "off" button and walked upstairs to his bedroom.  Little Johnny
 must have been excited to go listen to his CD player, because he ran up
 there without putting Teddy on the couch were he belonged!

        "Oops!" said little Johnny.  "I forgot to put Teddy back on the
 couch.  Oh well, I'll put him back later."  And with that said, little
 Johnny cooked up a massive dose of smack, shot it on his neck, and curled
 up into a ball on his bed while listening to his CD player.

        But Johnny never remembered to put Teddy back on the couch
 downstairs.  In fact, Johnny died right there on his bed.  Gradually, his
 body unwrapped out of the fetal position and into a lifeless spreadeagle.
 It was an overdose.  Little Johnny got a little too high for his own good.
 No matter, though, Johnny had been a worthless shell of a human being for
 months, because of his habit and all.

        When little Johnny's parents got home, they were shocked.
 "Something is horribly wrong!" shouted Mrs. Johnny.  "Where is Teddy?
 Where is my precious remote?"

        "Now, don't worry, honey, I'll take care of this," asserted Mr.
 Johnny.  "It's probably just that junkie son of ours again.  I'll check his
 room!"

        Mr. Johnny went upstairs and knocked on his son's door: "Little
 Johnny, are you in there?  Where is Teddy?  What have you done with our
 baby?"  There was no response.  "Johnny?  You son of a bitch, answer me!
 I'm coming in."

        Mr. Johnny barged into his son's room and saw him there, lifeless
 and stretched across his bed.  "Oh my god!  There you are, Teddy!  We
 thought you were a goner for sure!"  Mr. Johnny retrieved Teddy from atop
 little Johnny's CD player, where it had been sitting peacefully all along.

        "You've had a rough day, Teddy," said Mr. Johnny.  "But don't worry,
 it's all over now.  It'll be just me and Mrs. Johnny pushing your buttons
 from now on."
