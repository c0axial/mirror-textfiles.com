        I nominate Andrall Pearson, CEO of Tricon.  Andrall, despite being a
 corporate despot, is well-known for loving a good time, and keeps smelling
 salts in his shoes at all times.  He claims they "keep the demons away".
 Andrall also has that condition the name of which I forget-graph-something-
 -that consists of writing compulsively.  He writes dozens of pages every
 day, mostly moralistic exhortations to his imaginary daughter.  Andrall is
 also a party hound; he has behaved so crudely and boorishly on occasion
 that Howard Stern has denounced him in public for "poor taste".  If a
 customer comes to Mr. Pearson with a complaint, he will just laugh
 maniacally for hours on end, until the customer goes away.  Despite these
 quirks, Pearson exemplifies company pride, as seen in his infamous "chicken
 pants".  These are pants specially constructed to mimic the crispy coating
 on Kentucky Fried Chicken (a subsidiary of Tricon), right down to the
 smell.  As a result, Pearson has to be kept away from all dogs, who will
 attack him rabidly if they are put within 50 feet of his "chicken pants".
 If he has to be around a dog, he will remove the pants, but will not wear
 any other pants.  "It's either the chicken pants or no pants at all", he
 says.  There is no love lost between Andrall Pearson and dogs, that's for
 certain.  One of his favorite pastimes, left over from his career as a
 sharpshooter in the service, is to go down to Cherokee Park, get out a big
 ol' sniper rifle, and shoot dogs.  He'll stay out all day shooting dogs,
 and then in the evening he will stick around and get his cock sucked.  He
 is always delighted when one of his many anonymous homosexual liasons
 comments that his cock "tastes like Kentucky Fried Chicken".  For these
 reasons and many more, I believe that Andrall Pearson is is one of the 10
 most eccentric personalities of this century.
