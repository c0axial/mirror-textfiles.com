 !!========================================================================!!

        once upon a farm, on a time far far away, there were animals!
 one day, the farm animals were bored and wanted to experience something
 new -- cross breeding.  the oink approached the moo in a very seductive
 manner, as they then proceeded to having mad hot farmsex.  shortly
 after, a baby was born. they called it an oink-moo, and named the
 oink-moo "moo-oink".

        amazed and pleased with such a sight, the cock-a-doodle-doo and
 the quack-quack also decided to experience the joy of cross breeding.
 they spent the rest of the day doing the unthinkable in the back of the
 barn.  after a short period of time, the quack gave birth to a beautiful
 baby.  the baby turned out to be a doodle-quack, they named the
 doodle-quack "quack-doodle".  the rest of the farm animals got excited
 with this new trend, and not very long after, the barn was filled with
 various farm animal moaning sounds.  later on, meow-moos, quack-oinks,
 moo-doodles joined the oink-moo's and doodle-quacks.

        soon enough, the animals from a zoo nearby heard about the
 pleasures that the oink-moo's, doodle-quacks, meow-moo's, quack-oinks,
 and moo-doodles were having, so they quickly gathered together, broke
 out of the zoo and bolted towards the farm.  the behhh's, roawrs, tssts,
 tweet-tweets, rib-ribbits, and ee-ee-ee's (monkeys) wasted no time and
 pounced into the pile of raging animal hormone action.  the farmer and
 his wife, disturbed and curious about what the fuck was going on in the
 barn to make such a racket, opened the barn door and found themselves
 witnesses to a violent animal orgy.  however, it seems as though --
 before being rudely interrupted by the animal moans -- mr.farmer and
 mrs. farmer were in the middle of having sex.  seeing such hot action in
 the barn turned them on as they quickly started fucking like (and with
 the) barnyard animals.

        a few weeks later, mr.farmer and mrs.farmer found out that they
 were going to give birth to *god knows what*.  7 months down the line,
 out popped... moo-oink-quack-doodle-behhh-roawr-tsst-tweet-ribbit-ee-ee
 out of her old and frail body.  mr. farmer thought the situation was
 getting out of hand.  rather displeased with this new development (that
 being newborn moo-oink-quack-doodle-behhh-roawr-tsst-tweet-ribbit-ee-ee
 and the excessive amount of animals in the barn), the farmer quickly
 fled to the shed to get his shotgun.  upon his return, several gunshots
 were heard.  the mean mean farmer had shot all the oink-moo's,
 doodle-quacks, meow-moo's, quack-oinks, moo-doodles, behhh-ribbits,
 tsst-ee-ee's, roawr-tweets, rib-tssts, doodle-tssts, the
 moo-oink-quack-doodle-behhh-roawr-tsst-tweet-ribbit-ee-ee and his wife!
 TSK TSK.  within no time, all the oink-moo's, doodle-quacks, meow-moo's,
 quack-oinks, moo-doodles, behhh-ribbits, tsst-ee-ee's, roawr-tweets,
 rib-tssts, doodle-tssts, the moo-oink-quack-doodle-behhh-roawr-tsst-
 -tweet-ribbit-ee-ee and his wife drowned in their puddles of animal
 blood.

        THE END.
	
	*the moral of this story is:  life sucks and then you die.*

        [please excuse my 5 year old vocabulary, it just seems to fit
 with the story.]
