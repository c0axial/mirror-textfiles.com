        I emailed and snailmailed and couriered and overnighted and
 telegramed (I even sent a singing telegram) and telephoned Energizer Battery
 Co. and Duracell regarding this possible DoS, but to no avail.  The response
 I got was a loud and repeated, "You stupid idiot, get out of here before
 I...".

        As such, I shall distribute the diagrams and instructions to the
 public at large.  After all, Information wants to be [US$5.00, CA$17.25].

 Date    -> 7/15/1999. 2:08 AM.
 Urgency -> Very high.  SuperHigh.  Higher-than-Bob-Marley high.
 Affects -> All currently produced 9V Batteries.

 Background

        A flaw in the design of all currently produced 9(nine) volt batteries
 allows them to be susceptible to certain DoS attacks, including, but not
 limited to, shortcircuit.c, jizzbucket.c, drippytongue.c and bigfatloogie.c.
 
 Effects

        A cool, tingling sensation on one's tongue (fig. b), possibly
 followed by a slight lowering of the sensitivity to one's taste buds
 (fig. b), resultant of the muppettongue.c DoS variant.  The effects have not
 been widely studied thus far.

 Conclusion

        Be cool, stay in school.  Don't listen to the teachers, though.
 Laser Pointers are bad, kids.  Use batteries, instead.  Amaze friends,
 Baffle teachers, and scare your anal retentive father.
