        Hmm... since I am too lazy to think up a plot for a story right
 now, and even though the New Yorker said it would accept one of my
 essay's about how children aren't taught to think critically these days
 (often with the only arguement being 'That's just... your OPINION!'
 man... get off the grass son.)  Actually, the New Yorker just sent over
 one of their editor's, but he said he would accept it... Um... I just
 made it up, if the New Yorker would accept me, why would I be writing
 *here*?

        Let's see, first of all, let me just say that Mogel and Trilobyte
 are both no talent hacks that get off by insulting my brilliant work.
 It's like... how the antichrist at the beginning of time, when God was
 weak -- he fucking kicked God's ass.  And he's the antichrist just for
 that.  I mean, it's probably just some soldier that was going Christian
 bashing.  Which reminds me, did you ever hear the one about the little
 Christian that could?  Too bad, we ate him.  Heehehehehhehee.  Ahh those
 old jokes.  Where was I?  Oh yeah, Trilobyte and Mogel are jerks is what
 I'm saying.  Now, for the story, this buildup has obviously introduced
 all the plot characters.

        On a Friday afternoon in late May, a 13-year-old boy in one of my
 district's middle schools produced a list of people he wanted to
 "seriously fuck up, aka kill."  Several hours later, I stood in my
 basement, holding the list in my left hand and a whip in the right.  He
 was too timid, I speculated, to put the fear of anal rape into his
 enemies.  He had instead decided to timidly sit back and make a list of
 people he feared.  Well, I would soon be one of them.  But it's called
 tough love, damnit!  He even assured me he would never hurt anyone in
 self defence.  He was probably threatening me at the time, because I was
 smacking him with a birch stick, so I just whacked him harder.  Then, to
 test if he deserved to live, I asked him about "tulup mania".  When he
 answered with a glassy stare, I simply gave the standard punishment of
 whacking him around with a rolled up "Economist".  A whacking that would
 surely make sure nothing like Jonestown ever happened again.  Then I
 drank some bitter's, and gave a long, hard thought about his hit list.
 And I decided, if someday he could make a living off of it, he was all
 right with me.  For then:  he would be a capitalist.

        ...the screen turns off, and Ross Perot walks in from the wings.

 Ross Perot: "Indeed, this isn't what is happening now.  That's why you
              must elect, ME! (president). It's like I always say, umm..."

             <he looks at some cue cards.>

             "A child... is like a cake that you......are baking.  Like
              cakes they should be allowed to bake slowly in the warm
              oven, our children too often get the heat turned up and the
              time cut back.  On the outside they look finished.  Let me
              tell you something..."

             <he squints at the cue cards.>

             "...man to person.  He's not.  On the inside, he's not.  Let
              that child bake!  Which kinda reminds me, I left a cake in
              the oven..."

                                  The Epilogue
                                  ============

        Yeah!  And then a fucking anvil fell on his head!#%  By the way,
 please note that I wrote this a couple of years ago... oh yeah, I think
 some pothead put a baby in the oven after watching this.
