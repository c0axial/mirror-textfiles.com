        I must apologize.  In an earlier article titled "help for those in
 need" I stated that there was always hope for teeny boppers.  I was an
 idealistic high school student then.  Now that I'm an embittered freshman,
 I know better.

        The fact is, there is no hope.  The world will always be assaulted by
 prefabricated pop shit, from which there is no escape.  Yes, groups will
 come and go, but there will always be more waiting, waiting to prey on the
 stupidity of people.  The crusade will never succeed, so I have given up all
 hope of saving the world from this shit some call music.  I can only save
 myself from that torture.  That's not to say that i won't stop making fun of
 boppers, that's just too much fun.  But there is no way to convert them,
 they've already been brainwashed by the backstreet bastards, or nsync fags.
 The same arguments come up over and over, and their only defense is: "but
 their soooo hot!".  No, there is no hope after that.

        And if i ever see bsb or nsync or any other wannabes in person, I
 won't hesitate to physically wound them with my swiss army knife.  13
 different ways to cut their limp dicks off, tear out their voice boxes, and
 permanently scar their girlish faces.  A catastrophy that no amount of
 sugery could rectify.  While i would be personally satisfied by this deed,
 it would only create compassion for the groups, and make me look like the
 bad guy.  People wouldn't even realize i was doing them a favor.  And it's
 not like it would even make a dent in the production of the boy group money
 machine.  There'd be 20 more acts just like them  to take their place.

        The world is a hopeless place.
