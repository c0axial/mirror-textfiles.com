  Hey you! Guess what, I have come across a government plot. That's right...
 a bonafide conspiracy. The letter i am about to present you with, is in fact
 NOT A FAKE. It is a true and real letter sent to me by a government agent
 in disguise. Nothing was changed except my address, and comments added with
 in the brackets!

Thank you for your response. It was one of only a few I received, and the
ONLY one from a bona fide skin. I accept what you say about skins being
'perfect gentlemen' when it comes to non-groupies, and that no true skin
will 'force' me to do anything.

 [When she (ahh-hemm) first mailed me, she asked about skins and talked]
 [about how she had an affair with a group of skins. This is when i got]
 [suspicious                                                           ]

My problem/need/wish is to meet skins who are not 'perfect gentlemen' and
to be treated like a groupie, with everything that goes along with that. I
do not or will not need to be at all forced, I will do whatever quite
willingly and with genuine pleasure.
  
  [What a fucking set up. This could be so fun!]
  
You say that you have 'been there' and that you know how I feel. can you
expand upon this please. Are you into treating a woman/groupie/(me) with
contempt. 

Let me be frank here. I am looking for humiliation, degradation and even
	  [^Frank? A code name? Or maybe the agents real name!]
some pain. I have experience and will appreciate the 'heavy' end of such
activities. As such I will go along with whatever scene is decided upon or
arranged. Individual or group scenes are not a problem to me.  This is a
100% genuine request.  [Yeah! Bull-fucking-shit!]

You might think that at forty-three I am a little 'old' to get heavily into
						  [^^^Unhuh!]
the groupie scene. I may be, because you must be the judge of my
suitability. After all I do have two children (21 and 19 - both girls) and
					      [^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Hello!]
cannot even compete with younger/teenage chicks in the looks/body
departments. I can however make up for that with my total submission,
experience  and enthusiasm. I am not a fantasist or a role player. I want
to live the live. Full time, big time.  [What?]

I try and keep myself in the shape to please. I work out regularly, I have
had my eyes de-bagged, my chin tightened, my faced 'lifted', my tits made
bigger and firmer and my ass tightened. I am not ashamed of this because I
know I younger men have the right to expect good quality meat in their
groupies.                                               [Hmmm]

I live in Texas, travel is no problem neither is the payment of expenses or
other monies. There is something so deliciously humiliating about an older
woman giving younger men money for services... [Rich bitch]

Please ask any questions you wish. I am open to anything and will respond
accordingly.   [Are you a fed?]

I hope you will respond to this. You are my sole hope from the post.
     [I love a good joke]             [That's What you think baby!]

Love and respect   [What a joke!]
Cindy              [Yeah, Right!]

   First off, I don't even know if it was a man or woman, so to make things
 easier, i will refer to it as a female.
   
   Ok, I have two thoeries. One, The government found a woman whom met the
 above criteria, with one addition, AIDS. That's right, The woman they would
 have sent would probably have had aids.  The reason?? If you don't know,
 well, that's sad. The reason, they feel skin heads are a threat to their 
 upcoming plans, and they want to kill us all with AIDS. Un huh.

   I did my best to test this theory. I asked her for proof of not having 
 any STD's. Hospital notice, Whatever. I never heard from her again. This
 lead me to my next conclusion.

   She was a feminist, reporter, or something along those lines. I feel this
 because any one working for the government  could have easily had them
 forge the hospital documents. So, it was probably a plot of the feminists
 who want to get rid of us "scum". 

   And as i was writing this, I thought, "Gee, Maybe it was a feminist who
 wants more reason to crucify us." Wow. Isn't that special.


NOW, Make way for the elite ["Dun! DUNNN! Dun! Dah-DAHHHHH"] conclusion:
