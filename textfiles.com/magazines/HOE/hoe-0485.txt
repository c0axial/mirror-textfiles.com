 Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggie.
 A star-struck pair of mismatched lovers?
 Or perhaps a penning of a higher form of consciousness.

 Kermit the Frog is a nasally, green little guy, constantly
 singing folksy tunes with his banjo about being a frog and
 how tough it is.
 Miss Piggie is a noisy, visually loud, fat oinker of a pig
 with a large taste for Kermit's Tadpole.

 Miss Piggie belongs to the species Porcine feltus, a breed
 of pink wool-felt and styrofoam not found commonly in wild.
 She represents the human feelings of lust, greed, and the
 twisted hormones of the sex organelles.

 Kermit the Frog is our hapless hero. He has easy life, no
 worries, no hardships. He is what all humans strive for.
 A cushy job, a mass influx of pay, and maybe some cartons
 of flaming hot cheetos.

 Humans are constantly striving to have sex with the good life.
 Michael Jackson and Priscilla Presley.
 Fred Flintstone and Betty Rubble.
 Unknowing 13 year olds and gay Pop-Idols of the moment.

 Likewise, Miss Piggie is in constant pursuit of a good ribbit.
 She sees the green frog as her only means of happiness.
 Miss Piggie wants the frog; she does everything in her power
 to gain the frog and the power it holds for her.

 In the end, Frog is what ultimately creates the relationship.
 Kermit oftentimes dismisses Miss Piggie so he can retain
 his walking abilities or continue researching the maritial
 status of his favorite gay Pop-Idols of the moment.

 In a similar aspect, What we want is often times not what we get,
 and what we get is only gotten because what we want is also
 what wants us, a fact shown by the fact that what we want to want
 is often what we want us to want us to get, so that what we end
 up getting is mirrored by what others want us to want so we get
 them for them, but what they say they really want is for us to
 get what we want. Yes. Exactly.

 In the crazed, mixed up world of Frogs mating with Pigs,
 It's nice to have a little sanity some call hoe.
