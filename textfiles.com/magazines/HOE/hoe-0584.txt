      [ DISCLAIMER - THIS ARTICLE USES THE DEFAULT PRONOUN SHE, SINCE I
 AM A HETEROSEXUAL TRYING TO SCORE WITH THOUSANDS OF GIRLS. ]

      "Hmm.  You know, I never thought about it before, but that girl is
 really cute.  Damn, she is smart, too.  I really do like her.  Sigh. . .
 too bad nothing ever goes my way."

      <I realize no guy can possibly imagine how a girl thinks, least of
       all me, but bear with me while I try to complete this scenario>

      "That guy is kinda cute.  Maybe in a weird way, but he is kinda
 cute. . . and he always makes me laugh.  I wonder if he has a girlfriend?
 Oh well.  He probably does."

      So, Quarex, what is the point to this article?  Simple.  The point is,
 I am fairly certain that both men and women do indeed want relationships to
 a roughly equal degree.  What they want out of them may be vastly
 different, but I cannot imagine the basic psychological and physiological
 need to have and to hold can be all that different between the sexes.
 Granted, spend a few weeks hanging out with me and you would think that
 girls want nothing more from guys than to hug them and kiss them on the
 cheek all the time, but this is not totally about me (only 99% about me).

      The above scenario represents a situation that is all too entirely
 possible, at least to normal people, who have lives vaguely similar to
 those represented on _My So Called Life_.  My life is actually more similar
 to _The Simpsons_, so such situations may still happen, but I am certain to
 never notice them if they do occur.  So, since I have already established
 that men and women both probably want something at least quasi-meaningful,
 why are situations like the above allowed to occur without the parties
 clearly expressing their interest in one another?

      Just think how much more wonderful the lives of both of the people
 above would be if, through some stroke of luck, they both suddenly got an
 incredible amount of guts, and each told the other what they were thinking?
 Suddenly, brief awkwardness aside, the dating possibility would open up,
 and it would go from wondering what it would be like if someone liked you,
 to realizing that someone does like you enough to try dating you.

      This might be elementary to all of you bastards, since all h0e writers
 aside from me are easily able to achieve a relationship.  But think about
 it.  How often do you think about possibly being together with someone you
 just know casually, or barely at all?  Why not just go fucking tell the
 person what you are thinking, and hope that he or she is thinking the same
 thing?  Worst case scenario, he or she thinks you are a freak, and stops
 talking to you.  If he or she thinks that way after learning your thoughts,
 would you really have wanted to think that way about him or her in the
 first place?  In hindsight: NO!  So next fucking time you see that guy or
 girl in your English class who catches your eye and never lets it go, just
 say "HEY. I LIKE YOU.  WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING."  OR AT THE VERY LEAST, JUST
 START KISSING HER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.  SURELY NO MORE THAN FIVE YEARS IN
 JAIL CAN RESULT FROM THE HARASSMENT SUIT.

      This should be really applicable to absolutely everyone.  I personally
 have felt this way about ten or so girls since last summer, and even I, the
 King of Cartoonish Rejection, thought at least two or three of the girls
 might have had a thing for me, however small.  Hell, now I am even going to
 Prom with one of them*.  You might think that means she would at some point
 have had a thought like the one above--but this is Quarex's life here,
 remember?  Yeah.  I suck.

      So next time you check out some guy or girl in one of your classes,
 just think to yourself. . . what have I got to fucking lose, huh?

      FUCK

      ADDENDUM:

 * I found out in the time between writing this article and releasing it
   that the girl who wants to go to Prom with me has, in fact, no interest
   in dating me.  But DO NOT LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU!  *YOU* ARE NOT
   CURSED!
