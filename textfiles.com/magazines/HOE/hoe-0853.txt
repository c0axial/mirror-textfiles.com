 Aster Aster
 the beautiful flower
 i want to dance with you at sunset
 on a deserted beach
 with carrots and faeries

 Aster, Oh Aster
 I love the way
 the sun shines upon your
 petals and leaves
 your stem is so strong
 and holds you high above the dirt

 Aster, Dear Aster
 Why for are you so small
 and dainty and lovely
 sometimes i'd like to PICK you
 but then I smile apon your
 yellow petals and a tear
 runs down my face

 Aster, My love, my Aster
 there's a place for us somewhere
 like in West Side Story
 I want to make you happy
 let's dance and sing
 and you can even bounce
 like little cartoon
 flowers do.
