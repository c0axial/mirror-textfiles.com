        Presently, I couldn't want any of Aunt Jemima's "special"
 juxtaposition.  Why is Oliver Twist so fat?  Explanations' forthcoming.
 Maybe.  As Corky burns, isn't that cool?

        Rapunzel Barbie enjoys NOTHING!  She typifies prepubescent angst.
 Why then, asks Mohammad the dirty, is my thought process so deliberately
 fouled?  BECAUSE.

        Mortified, Oliver screamed again.  "WHEE!  WHEE!  WHEE!  fuck.  Not
 WHEE!  I wish this didn't require anything.  I wish you were more DEAD!"
 Who dares enter the chamber of Happy Happy Happy Steamboat?  Retire before
 your tamagotchi does.  Yes.

        Listen you, clean Phil up or face horrible goldfish!  WHAT?  DO I
 WANT GOLDFISH?  Never you mind, snitchy.  Wear more armor!  Armor satisfies
 women.  They can't stop it!  Pour some sugar on me, snitchy.  France SUCKS!

 Oooh!

        Help
                me
                        okay.

        Thanks.  Sven Vath likes Pepsi.  Certainly, Khaki knickers kan't keep
 kwiet.  Good.  Can of Boats doesn't make any fucking SENSE!  Sports SUCK!

        Dunk Dunk Goose.  DUNK DUNK MOTHERFUCKING RHINOPLASTY or keelhaul the
 landlubber!  Arrrrr...  where's the bathroom?   Up mast, down wind.  Oliver
 still doesn't get Repunzil Bahrbye.  Good.  Yeah.  Right.
