 Day 1
 =====

        Today I was watchin C-SPAN, and it got me thinkin, about how
 slow and idiotic our government can be.  About how often someone is
 shot in this country, and basically how democracy just doesn't fucking
 work at all.  So I decided, hell I can do a better job.  I've still got
 some of that young rebellion blood in me, I've seen 'Braveheart' and
 dammit, I know how ta make napalm.

        So I sent out a mass e-mail to all the hackers, freex,
 militants, and fug-ups I could think of.  An S.O.S. to stop oppresive
 shit, a call to arms if you will.  I've even got a name for this
 online-army.

        The R.S.R.   The Red Star Rebellion.

        The 'Red' stands for unity.  Sort of like the blood of the
 people... or something.  And the star is becuz federal agents usually
 wear vests, so, like the air-force, we aim high... er... waitaminute...

        Anyway I got to talkin about all of this with a friend of mine,
 and she asked me what my plan was.  I told her I would start the
 revolution on the internet, and exploit technology to render the U.S.
 forces defenseless.  For example, by hacking into U.S. satellites, we
 will make it impossible for the U.S. to retaliate with their nuclear
 arsen--Okay, dammit... so I don't have a plan.  And I'm just kinda
 wingin' this whole conquer the world thing as I go along.

        Bugger off.

 Day 2
 =====

        Minimal response from my radical brethren.  But the few who have
 come forward seem really enthusiastic.  Of course, I had to bribe half
 of them with free warez and money.  Nevertheless, I am beginning to
 build a tightly knit regime, ready to stage a bloody coup at my very
 command.

        Also, I noticed something odd today.  I think I may be
 developing some sort of god-complex... Hmm, this must be how Napolean
 felt.

 Day 3
 =====

        Today I went out an got some stuff on Caeser, and that movie
 'The Wave', so I can try and figure out brainwashing.  I also bought a
 copy of 'The Art of War' and a few things by Machiavelli.

        On another note, today my head of espionage uncovered a few spies
 in our ranks.  Luckily he had them eliminated before any damage was
 done.  Also, today I asked a friend if she would like to head our
 propaganda department.  Her response; 

        "Gee, can't I just shoot people?"

 Day 4
 =====

        The troops seem restless, and many good men are missing in
 action or a.w.o.l.  Today someone wanted to know what the politics of
 the new world order would be.  I thought about this for awhile.  And I
 think a democratic attitude might work.  With of course a socialist
 underbelly, and just a hint of fascis-Alright fine.  I dunno what the
 hell I'm talkin about here either.

 Day 5
 =====

        Morale is low, the enemy appears to be taking its toll on the
 troops.  Today I tried changing the name to "The Red Star Alliance".  I
 got several small hacker groups to allie with us in hopes that in using
 this system I would take some of the burden of actually having to do
 something off of my troops.  We'll see how that turns out.

 Day 6
 =====

        Alas, all of my efforts are in vain.

        Group interest is now all but non-existent, and I am beginning
 to question my very sanity for taking on this mass of stupidity in the
 first place.

 Day 7
 =====

        Bah, fug it.
