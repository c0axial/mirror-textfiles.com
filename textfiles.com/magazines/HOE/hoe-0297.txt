        In this series of articles you will learn the basics of brother
 torture and it's many methods.  In this article you will learn the best
 physical torture methods.

        The first thing I would like to discuss is the coercement.  This
 is one of the most important things in little brother torture.  It goes
 like this.

        The trick is to get your younger brother _REALLY_ mad at you.
 This is easily done through acute mental scrutiny.  The scrutiny method
 is like best is the "you smell like a horse" method.  What I do is just
 repeat this over and over, eventually driving him insane.  This method
 works great while he's talking on the phone.  Eventually he will become
 so annoyed that he will strike out blindly at you with a blunt object of
 some sort.  Now you can do whatever you want, because you have an alibi,
 the "he hit me first" alibi.

        Another great coercement method is the "push the little daisies"
 method.  This is basically the same as the "you smell like a horse"
 method except instead of chanting "you smell like a horse" you pull your
 shirt over your head and run around his room yelling "Push the little
 daisies and make 'em come up" in the most annoying voice you can make.
 He'll find it funny at first, but after about 10 minutes he'll have had
 enough and want to chop your head off.  At this point he will assault
 you and then do as you please.  The best time to use this method is when
 he has one of his little friends over for a tea-party.  The friends will
 think its hilarious and your little bro will eventually scream "IT IS
 NOT FUNNY" at them.

        Now its time for the torture.  A great method is the "typewriter"
 this is one of the funniest gags around!  First toss your brother on a
 bed.  Now sit on his stomach.  At this time he'll wonder what the hell
 is going on.  The next step is important.  Depending on the strength and
 size of your little bro, you must decide on the pressure to use.  What
 you do is you pin each of his arms down with each of your knees.  Having
 done this you begin to "type your letter".  I like to act like I'm
 writing a letter home from camp...what I say usually goes like this,
 "Dear mom" (as I do this I pretend to type on an invisible typewriter on
 his chest) at that I say "oops...i messed up" and pull on his hair acting
 like I'm removing a piece of paper.  Then I pull down on his earlobes
 pretending that I'm loading in a new piece.  Then I start from the
 beginning.  This goes on until I get bored or until he starts crying,
 from the latter a confrontation with my mom will usually ensue.

        The next method I'd like to discuss is the "fish-hook" method.
 This is a quick, efficient, fun method.  It is a sneak attack that works
 great in the kitchen.  what you do is while your little brother is
 distracted by the fridge, you sneak up behind him and hook one of your
 fingers into his cheek.  Now you've got him. You can drag him around and
 make him give you money, candy, or whatever.  When he resists, pull hard
 on his cheek, that'll get him really steamed and he'll probably slobber
 all over your hand, so I suggest wearing a rubber glove (this also leaves
 a VERY unpleasant taste in you victims mouth).

        The third and final method I will discuss is the "Milkshaker"
 method, this is the simplest of all methods.  The first step is to toss
 your little bro to the ground.  Having done this I would now suggest
 invoking the typewriter method as an intro.  After the typewriter you
 scissor you legs around his mid-body, lock them, squeeze, and begin to
 shake violently.  He will eventually puke, or his chest will cave in.
 Though I doubt the latter will happen, as it has never happened to me.

        Oh, Don't come crying to me when mommy and daddy ground you for
 a year.
