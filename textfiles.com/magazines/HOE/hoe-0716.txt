        The french are kind folk indeed they come from across the pond if you
 are rich and across the world if you are not.. but not one of them none of
 them could give me a proper trasnlation for what i asked for was to ask.  so

 gonna be a fuckin party in my mind tonight.  the cop game..is so lame.. i
 can`t explain the cop game except that it happens and happens and they say
 it doesn`t happen and then it happens again.  to be caught.. to be
 arrested.. to be let go.. to watch the cop do what you and you what you did
 is just the thing that slips up the falls.

        the trick to depression is to have a little humility humblity ability
 abounds but doesn`t find the one`s all down an out and drag..bummer bummmer
 i`m sorry fella.. fell my sac did into your pocket where they copped it on
 the internuniversalized worldwide T.V. it happens again and you lose so much
 money that you lost so much before you get over you blame yourself.  then
 the working time comes the apple orange 50 sacks full of buds just the size
 of my fistin and fistout the two rags go at it.. puke everywhere and
 someone`s gonna get it.

        the beach boys play kokamo as little matt grosshan is piped for a
 half of gerbil feces.

        the rain came when dennis did the devil man run and he high tailed it
 back to safety.. where the money lookin fori`m white boyz won`t come.  bbah

        <hi  i am danny.  i don`t really know what the hell is going on in
 this piece/mind/thing/file/becoming the keyboard.. but i thought i`d
 sidetrack if just to let you know a bit about me.,@!$Crunch back out the
 river the flow of the river this enumerated avenue train,, and i go up the
 sloplddes and i type up with my eyes closed and everythings going insane.
 regain. i wake up. parts of me hurt. i do my best to quell them. i smoke a
 cigarette. i wash up. i leave.  i would like a bit of an allurring woman.  a
 girl my age who hasn`t got it all together.

        i would like a way of living of functioning forever.. a way that i
 could move around and end nnnnnn.  and i `d like to wake up!  just one
 fucking tim.. to be on time for something good and painless when everything
 is lameness,, for when one freaks out.. all one knows is that they are
 freaking the fuck out..

        and that they are going to freak somemore..i went to the airport
 today.  wanted to leave.. was bored.. had no clue.. 200.. ...150 bucks.
 won`t get you to aruba.

        i sure would we all need WE ALL NEED A DAY ALONE A DAY WITH OURSELVES
 TOGETHER A MASS MANUFACTURED ANIMALISTIC TREASUrE just a pill.  in a bottle.
 which was mass manufactured, i ate it up.  waited up.. and now i`ve got
 this.

        my day off.  from 7-11.  where i am superman.  my day off from my
 family.  where i am franz kafka sippin pepcid ac.  look, this is the
 funniest thing i ever heard in my life;

        once in a bin.. little tim was a twalking.. in a group therapy
 session.. tim only 9 not much to buff with when the other 13 of us are
 junkies.  addicts.  WiLDI nThEW mInD mAn I~!M M TRYIN TO TElLVD YOU
 THERE~WAS NO WAY TO TELL YOU#@ while lil tim speaks on of nintendo`s and
 sports.

        mum won`t let me play nintendo for more than 5 hours..

        mum won`t let me go outside after 11..

        mum won`t let me play with my videogames when i want to.  they`re
 mine.

        Allovafuckinsudden.  A downtrodden sullen angsty punk lad.. dammit
 his name slips me mem again.  he sits up, he gets up, he speaks up.. yet
 doesn`t disrupt.. and says boldly "I think you`re problems are very trite."

        Jon was his name.. yes.  laughed my ass off at jon for 3 whole
 days./. they kept me in that fuckhole for anothoer 30.
