        Well kids, another Pumpcon has come and gone.  I am introducing a new
 tradition this year, since this is the first year I was somewhat involved
 with running it, Pumpcon Awards!@#. 

        It was as a whole a pretty successful con I guess, if you could call
 it that.  It'd be better off labelled as a binge drinking and drugging
 festival.  This year there was a fistfight (if you can call it that, it
 looked more like rockem sockem robots.) and a new bartab record, somewhere
 along the lines of $9000 for the 48 hours we occupied the bar.

        These awards are judged solely by me, and other ghetto.org members.
