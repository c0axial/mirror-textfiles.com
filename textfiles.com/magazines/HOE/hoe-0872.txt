        Dude, I swear.  If, by my 23rd birthday, on August 13, 2001, I have
 not obtained an even slightly meaningful relationship with a woman, I am
 just going to blow my fucking brains out after having a killer birthday
 party.  If any of you want to go, you are welcome.  I am sick of this shit.
 If you do not have a real girlfriend by the time you graduate from college,
 I am sorry, but you never will.

        It is just that simple.

        And now, the funny part of the text file!

        HEE HEE HEE!

        WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME PUNS?

        I HAVE ONE!

        What do you call it when you ignore the sound crows make?

        CAUTION!

        . . .?

        How about this:

        What happens when you pour a new road onto an old Indian burial
 ground?

        Retarded.

        I may have just crossed the line there.

        Shoot me.
