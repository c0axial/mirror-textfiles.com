				KITTY TEASE
			       Owner's Guide

	You have just purchased a remarkable toy for cats whose uniqueness
 now lets you enjoy your cat's natural aggressiveness first hand. The
 KITTY TEASE is not only a toy that works on virtually calls to 20 years
 old, but is also the perfect exerciser, that you control, for that
 overweight cat. You control your cat's jumps, spins, quick turns and
 pounces with just a simple flick of the wrist. The KITTY TEASE should
 provide you with countless hours of enjoyment, day after day, year after
 year. From the 8 week old kitten to the oldest of 20 years, the reaction
 is the same; SECOND KITTENHOOD is now a reality!

	The KITTY TEASE is extremely effectively on /virtually all cats./
 The fiberglass rob imparts such a LIFE-LIKE vibration and twitching into
 the cloth that cats think the cloth is literally alive. Due to this cat
 reaction to the KITTY TEASE, I highly recommend that the KITTY TEASE be
 put away after you are through using it. Put it in a place where the cat
 cannot get at it alone. If you leave it out, the cat will probably pull
 it all over the house and you will find it in 1,000 knots around a chair
 leg some place. A cat that likes to roll may tangle its tail or legs in
 the slack line and scare itself. In some extreme cases a cat may become
 so taken by the hunter instinct that it will literally eat the cloth and
 line as the last gesture of catching its prey. Save yourself a lot of
 aggravation and please put the KITTY TEASE away after each use so that
 your cat cannot get at it by himself. I recommend a simple small nail,
 about head high, hammered into the side of a closeable closet. Hammer the
 nail at a downward angle and place the tip of the KITTY TEASE over it
 when not in use. Remember, the KITTY TEASE is a hand held cat
 toy/exerciser, and used as such should provide you with years of
 enjoyment.

	For a long while, I have enjoyed the prototype of the KITTY TEASE
 you now see. I have tried wood and metal rods of various lengths. I have
 tried different strings and different materials for the cloth. What you
 now hold is the result of that effort and what I feel is the best
 marketable product for the value, and over 1/4 million happy cats can't
 be wrong!

	Probably the most important feature of the KITTY TEASE is the
 length and taper of the fiberglass rod. This allows the aggressions of
 your cat to be absorbed without danger to him. The resulting spring-back
 action of rod, when your cat pulls on the cloth, gives a natural lifelike
 pull to the cloth. You control the tension and can easily adjust to the
 amount of pull your cat seems to enjoy the most.

	The aggressiveness of your cat will take its toll on the cloth
 lure. After trying several types and styles of lures, I have decided that
 a simple piece of denim seems to be best. With continued use it will wear
 out; it can be easily replaced with a similar piece of denim. A belt loop
 or even a piece of shoelace will also do. Do not use plastic or anything
 that has considerable weight in it. You don't want to knock our your cat.
 Should your cat be reluctant to play with the new cloth, try putting a
 little saliva on the cloth. This should now give the cloth an "approved"
 scent and play should now begin.

	The cloth and tip knots are both simple slip knots. To open the
 slip knot, simply pinch the knot with your fingernails and roll the cloth
 in the opposite direction.One direction tightens, one loosens. 

	Cats just naturally take to the KITTY TEASE. Like a tiger stalking
 its pretty in the jungle, your POCKET TIGER will pursue the KITTY TEASE
 the same way. Over the years, I have observed patterns of play that my
 cats seem to enjoy more than others. Your cat should also be more
 aggressive to these patterns. Simple experimentation with these and some
 of your own choosing quickly determines your cat's preferences.

	First and foremost remember that the cloth simulates a small bird
 or animal. Give it an action similar to a small bird or animal. Don't
 just dangle the cloth a couple of inches in front of his nose and expect
 a reaction. A bird wouldn't do that, and a cat knows that. Think sneaky
 and make it as if it were trying to sneak away after being spotted.

	Some cats simply want to play tug-of-war, and this is fine. Just
 hang in there with him with a steady pull. The more your cat growls, the
 more he is enjoying himself and getting exercise to boot. 

	All cats seem to take to stalking and pouncing naturally. By
 placing a small pillow or shoe on the floor, you provide your cat with
 the means for an "ambush". Simply flick the cloth to the opposite side of
 the pillow and twitch it along the floor in short jerks. An ambush is
 almost certain to follow. To keep your cat on his toes, don't let him
 catch the cloth every time. Let him try harder next time.

	You can also take advantage of your cat's climbing abilities by
 pulling the cloth up and over furniture. My cats get exceptionally active
 when this is done. When you position the cloth between the cushions it
 surely is fun watching them trying to get it out of there. It's
 aggravating to them to have to that thing just out of reach. 

	If you like to laugh- and this one can make your ribs sore from
 laughing so hard- try putting several sheets of newspaper down on the
 rug. When you pull the cloth over the paper, the string makes a sound
 similar to a mouse walking, and when the cat jumps on the paper, after
 the cloth, he has nothing to grip on and slides all over the place. They
 really get a kick out of this and will even try hiding under the paper at
 times in order to ambush their prey.

	By pulling the cloth over a rug in a quick back and forth motion-
 I mean so quick that the cloth is just a blur- you really arouse your
 cat's aggressiveness. This seems to be the ultimate challenge to them.
 Beware of potential rug damage because your cat will be all claws on this
 one. This is my favorite and even works on /declawed/ cats. 

	Once your cat becomes use to the KITTY TEASE, you may be able to
 get him to do jumps and flip.s This I've found varies with different
 cats. Simply pull the cloth across the floor in little hops of about 3"
 and increase the hop height as you get closer to your cat. When he jumps,
 pull it over his head and he should jump for it. Make it act as a
 butterfly and you should see a series of stalks and jumps.

	The KITTY TEASE is very effective outdoors in the grass or bushes.
 It is also effective outdoors at night or indoors in dim light. Your
 creativeness is your only limit. 

	For the overweight indoor cat, the KITTY TEASE becomes the perfect
 cat exerciser. What is play to your cat is also much-needed exercise for
 him, and the toning effect of KITTY TEASE play should become obvious in a
 few weeks. The playing stretches limbs and increases heartbeat and that
 burns up calories. Adjust the amount of play to what you and your vet
 feels is appropriate  for your cat. A naturally fast heartbeat is
 natural; panting and/or coughing is not. AN hour of play each day, while
 watching TV at the same time, goes by fast and will have noticeable
 results in a few weeks.

	The KITTY TEASE is made of quality components and is assembled
 with great care. In the unlikely case that the tip should come unglued
 from the rod, simply sand the end of the rob lightly and re-glue the tip
 with any of the small tubes of super-glue that are on the market. A loose
 handle can be re-glued with a small amount of ELMDER'S WOOD GLUE. A worn
 cloth can be replaced by simply opening the slip knot and replacing the
 cloth. 

	The string I use with the KITTY TEASE deserves a paragraph by
 itself. It is 50 lb. test braided black saltwater fishing line. I chose
 black because it is very hard to see, which results in the cat's eyes
 focusing on the cloth, instead of the line. I chose 50 lb. test because
 the lines under 30 lb. test were small enough to cut my cats between the
 toes. 50 lb. test gives a safe margin concerning these cuts. I chose
 braided line because it lasted the longest in my testing, and should a
 cat decide to eat a piece of it, it should pass right through and end up
 in your little box. DON'T LET YOUR CAT EAT THE LINE AND DON'T USE
 MONOFILIMENT LINE FOR THE REPLACEMENT LINES. Monofililiment is easy to
 bite through, and if eaten, its sharp edges can easily wedge internally
 and cause real problems. The black braided line can be found in the
 fishing department of most larger stores. I also sell replacement string
 pack, and that information is at the end of the manual. 

	If your cat plays such that knots form in the line, I advise you
 to take them out that day. If you leave them in, they just get tighter
 and shorten the line. Should your cat be on of those few that enjoys
 outsmarting you and chews through he line before you can stop him, try
 treating the line with a diluted solution of HOT sauce. Don't put any on
 the first 4" of the line by the cloth. 

	As with any toy, its use can be abused. Avoid possible injury by
 not flicking the KITTY TEASE wildly in the presence of others. If your
 cat won't let go, just grab the line and out pull him.

	I will replace any defective tip, rod, or handle for a period of
 one year if said damage is not due to abuse. With simple care, your KITTY
 TEASE should last for many years.

	I am proud of the KITTY TEASE and hope that you enjoy it as much
 as I have enjoyed mine. Please feel to write me concerning your comments
 or suggestions. You are my quality control and the source of future
 improvement or even new ideas. 

	For those who wish it, I also sell a replacement string pack for
 $1.00 p;us a self-addressed STAMPED envelope.
