        The alarm beeped.  I reached over and hit it, grumbling.  Why do I
 have to go to work?  How much longer is this going to have to happen?  The
 usual questions I have for myself every morning.

        Slowly, I sat up and winced, realizing my ribs were tender.  I turned
 to get off the bed, and realized my whole body had felt like I had just
 played football with sumo wrestlers.  What had happened?  I went to bed in
 top notch condition.  I shrugged my shoulders, sat up, and forgot about it.

        Normal day.  Went to my bullshit job, worked my bullshit work, came
 home, went to my bed and turned on the TV.  All was fine for about fourty
 minutes when, in the middle of a program, I felt the sudden urge to sleep.
 My eyelids could not keep themselves open.  I gave in to temptation and fell
 back on my bed, asleep.

        Looking around, I couldn't place where I had seen this before.  I was
 about 30 stories up, on some roof.  I know I had seen this city sometime.  I
 turned around a few times, trying to recall where I had seen it.  Smoke
 billowed in the moonlight miles around, from factories and burning
 buildings.  Sirens wailed endlessly below me.

        "You're here."  I heard a voice behind me, and spun around.  A tall,
 handsome blond man, with a german accent was grinning at me.  "Do you know
 what this is?"  He pointed to his watch, which was very odd-looking and had
 a certain presence I just couldn't place.

        "A fancy bracelet?" I remarked.

        Apparently, he didn't like my smart-ass answer and frowned.  He began
 to approach me.  He stopped when he was about ten feet away, and snapped.
 Three Asian youngsters were at his side in a heartbeat.  At once, the
 newcomers surrounded me.  One attacked while the other two watched.

        The first one swung his fist at my face.  Normally, I would have
 taken that punch and fallen to the ground.  But this wasn't normal.  This
 wasn't even reality.  This was something else.  I ducked my head, surprising
 myself, the attacker, and all the bystanders.  With lightning speed and
 amazing ease I grabbed his wrist, flipped him on the ground, and proceeded
 to stomp his head into a gross pile of skull fragments, blood, and brain
 matter.  With a gasp, the second Asian lunged at me.  Fortunately for me,
 he didn't attack, but just lunged.  I dodged, grabbing his head in the
 process.  I turned and threw him off the roof by his head.  I watched him
 plummet and grinned with a sick satisfaction as I heard the thud echo up to
 my position.  Before I could turn around, the third Asian was on me.  I
 dodged his kick I somehow knew would be coming, while grabbing his leg.  I
 threw him down to the ground and began to bend his legs up towards his head.
 He was laying on his stomach.  The German man approached slowly, and drew a
 different gun.

        "You fought well," he began, "but they did not."  He fired once,
 twice, thrice into the young Asian, who held on to life as well as he could,
 but eventually gurgled his death.

        The man looked at me, laughed, and punched me across the face with
 his gun.  I looked up at him as he pointed his gun at my face.  I closed my
 eyes and held my breath.

        Next thing I knew, I was gasping for breath in my bed again.  What
 had happened?  Had I hallucinated? Had I passed out and had a terrible
 nightmare?  I wasn't sure until a dull ache in my jaw turned into a blinding
 pain.  It was then I realized this wouldn't be the last time the man would
 be calling me into his world.  He liked making sure I felt pain somewhere I
 was a nobody.  This was a game to him.

        I managed to stumble to the bathroom where I proceeded to take four
 aspirins, but not before downing a quarter of a bottle of cheap tequila.  I
 then ambled back to my bed, fell down, and cried, knowing that my fate and
 my pain were in the hands of that man.
