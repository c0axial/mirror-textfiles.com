        To be misunderstood you must first understand yourself.  Let's
 face it, I have no idea why I do the things I do.  Therefore, since I can
 only be either understood or misunderstood (and since I'm not
 misunderstood) I must be understood.  Understand?

        To appreciate writing you must first familiarize yourself with
 the concept of bulldada -- the principle that tells us that something
 can be so bad that it's good.  Right now this must be fucking incredible.

        A game.  A game within a game.  Silver Monopoly pieces on
 Broadway Ave. playing a hardy game of chess on a board relatively
 miniaturized.  And the pawns on that board gather round the center to
 play a game of cards.  Oh, look.  A straight flush.  The puppet master
 himself has strings which are inconspicuously attached to his limbs.  He
 concentrates on only his part, his role to play.  He is unaware of the
 things he is unaware of.

        "Thank you for this prestigious award.  I'd like to thank the
 losers -- I couldn't have done it without you."

        oh shit I'm bleeding; did someone shoot me; eh, doesn't matter;
 congratulations; you got me right in the heart;

     "I never enjoyed walking because I always had somewhere to walk to."
 will someone please kill my tv; the numbers keep scrolling; my neighbor
 bought one today; there's nothing wrong with it; when he gets mad he
 turns purple; so are his veins; purple; I'm lactose intolerant; but you
 already knew that;; FOR LIFE!; stone faced men with glasses and bad
 bow ties; a flag can't wave on the moon; FUCK THAT -- we'll use sticks
 to hold it up; American ingenuity at work;

        I'm an excellent judge of character...  that's why I hate most
 people.

        i used to play a mute but now i can scream;

     "I'm what?!" said the outraged man to his former employer.
     "You're fired."
     He stood there for several seconds quivering with rage.
     "Ha!" he finally blurted out.  "This place won't run a single day
 without me!" -- and he was right.
     The next day the police said they suspected arson.
 walking an ugly mutt with a missing leg; sad faced bitch; jack and jill
 climbed capitol hill to get corrupted by liberty; jack fell down; he
 sued jill; she tripped him;

        Truth? There is no truth in the traditional way of defining it.
 And, if this is to be believed, than this itself is untrue.

        an old bum with a broken crackpipe and a lost dog; ain't lost
 no more; the old sentinel fell asleep at the wheel; hit a tree; or maybe
 it was the tree who feel asleep; dreamt it was a car; a classic story
 we've never seen but have heard before; forever; no more; free fall to
 white walls and bad food; delayed reaction; click bang
