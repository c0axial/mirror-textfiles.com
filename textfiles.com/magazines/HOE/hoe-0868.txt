 My dearest JubJub,

        Thank you for that enlightening information.  That I have heard over
 and over again.  Due to the fact that I get any drug I use from good friends
 who know where they have come from and the fact that I have only used E 6
 times, I feel that though that information may be of interest to others, it
 doesn't affect me or my future choices in drug use.  Being of legal age and
 of sound mind, I make my own choices.  I will continue on in my
 "extracurricular" activities just as I always have.  I trust my friends and
 I know that what they get is clean mostly because a lot of them manufacture
 the product themselves.  So no, you did not embarrass me and thank you for
 the un-needed information.  Hopefully some other devoted HoE reader will
 make use of it.

        Angeldust
