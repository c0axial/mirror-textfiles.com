      Well, look who decided to open up THIS text file??  It's you.  Hi.
This is not the usual HOE-DATE Action where I babble a LOT about nothin'.
Today I have big business.  Wh0a!  I won't waste too much time...there's a
lot of business...

      In case you're not too hyper-elitly tuned to Mogel-Land, you might be
unaware, but the HOE Home Base is changing.  Surprise!  This means lots of
confusing transition work for me.  Argh.  But at any rate, this will not be
a bad thing.

      What's actually changing isn't all that much.  I was, at first,
horrified by the prospect of my board going down, just because there were no
other good boards in 215 that cared about the mighty text file specifically
like Mogel-Land did.  I was going to weep, and I was going to struggle.
Thankfully, I was able to save all my groupies hearts by finding a suitable
replacement.  Black Francis (of such esteemed HOE and ReD fame), had an
interest in preserving the zine-scene and making his board pick up all the
texts of Mogel-Land.  In essence Mogel-Land will be jumping right into Black
Frannie's board.  The NEW HOE Home Base is called "Goat Blowers Anonymous"
and will carry all the best of my board plus more.  Frannie is a more
dedicated SysOp, and his system is a lot better than mine.  This is all good.

      Now for the IMPORTANT STUFF [Heh], All HoeOps that run Hoe Boards are
required to Check into GBA as soon as they can.  There is no Hoe-Distro list
this HOE-Date because basically (temporarily) almost all the HOE boards are
temporarily not sites anymore.  Just for the sake of having people check in,
and making shure that we still have alive sites out there.  At any rate,
please check into GBA as soon as possible.  The number is (215) 750-0392.

      Anyone that's still here might be wondering why I am closing my board
down.  Well, to be honest my life is really kinda of fucked right now.  But,
in short, I'm going to be moving to Rochester, New York soon and I wanted to
keep the Home of HOE in 215.  I'll be calling GBA remote plenty.

        Next order of Business: HOE has moved onto the iNpH0mAtiOn sUpaH-
hIgHwAy recently and gotten an ftp site.  Now you can get the latest issues
(thanks to DisordeR of FUCK and The Chief of uXu) at the following sites:

ftp.fc.net /pub/deadkat/misc/HOE [Part of UZA - Underground Zine Archice]
ftp.lysator.liu.se /pub/texts/uxu/HOE

        The sites at the moment this is released might not be totally
together, but this *IS* where the gNu HOEs will come in.

        Also, I wanted to mention something cool that Mad Arab did on his
board S.o.S.  There's now a "guest" account that all people can use.  It
entitles FULL leech access, read-only access every big h/p net around, a
place to pick up new HOEs, and one of the biggest collections of virus
Research stuff 'round.  Just logon with the handle "Anonymous" and the
Password "Guest".

        As always, HOE is now looking for writing and submissions.  We
simply want good t-files that'll be appreciated by people.  Real simple,
right?  We want class, we want style, we want it all.  We are not happy
stalking in the shadows of the damned underlings like oh-so much middle
ground cattle.  The pig is more.  Much, much more.  We will eat these
other people without spirit and vision as if they were freshly laid turds.

        Although I've lost my college account, there's two places you can
net e-mail me at currently.  The place that I'll get the message the FASTEST
actually shames me.  Here.. I'll admit it now...My Father owns Prodigy.  You
can send me mail at wvft86d@prodigy.com and it'll fly to me (I hate prodigy,
just so you know.  I *just* use that nifty Mail Manager Proggy they have).
Another place you can reach me at is mogel@gamepower.com - But I only logon
to that place every couple days or so.

        And the last new thing is that we're changing this here format of
HOE-DATE.  Now we're going to be extra goofy.  Lots of Random stuff from
writers and anything relating to the Modem Society<heh>.  We got lots of
neat stuff in this most recent release (45-60), so I hope you out there
enjoy.  There were some one-shots and weird gunk.  Defiant is leaving us
(I'll miss your sarcastic chats) and we picked up a whole bunch of new (I'm
not sure how dedicated) writers.  I'd like to thank the HOE writers, even
though you guys are lazy as shit, I appreciate the stuff.  I'd also like to
really thank Corrosion: Things can only get better, so thanks for sticking
through the shit and reminding me what the hell I'm doing.  You rule.

        OH, and in case anyone was wondering... Godd *IS* real.  He is not
a fictional person.  I hope you understand now that we here at HOE don't even
have to MAKE UP this kind of stuff.  It already exists.  Since we ragged on
Godd so bad by putting his messages in here, we'll plug his <heh> Zine.
It's called DpE.  Digital Phreakers ELiTE.  I'm NOT making this stuff up! 
The name is serious.  pHeAr tHeM!!!!!!1

 The below is a flyer I got that was being passed out from some government
guy that was wearing an "I AM NOT A FEDERAL AGENT" shirt and matching base
ball cap. I figured it might be important.
                                                -Abigwar

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Many of todays text files can cause drug use symptoms. Below
            is a list of the effects of many different 'zines.
    
  Introduction: The government, [Read: Your oppressors] first became aware
 of a great supply of drugs being passed out every where, even right over
 the governments noses on the internet, when the BBS 'Mogel-Land' some where
 in Philadelphia was busted. After examining the T-Files contained on
 Mogel-Land, (who's sysops [Mogel] name will not be released) for many hours
 the agents started to realize they where being effected by some unknown 
 drug. After much research they discovered the truth. Included is my (Uncle
 Sam's) very own experience with one of these files. 
  
  Texts can make your moods change by the content of it, focus around you
 becomes dazzled, and you can only focus on what you are reading. Perception
 is changed. Things may appear out of the corner of your eye. They may or may
 not be their, but you will never know because you are focused. It can cause
 unpredictable  behavior, and emotional instability. This type of file is a 
 hallucinogen.
 
  Some texts alter your perception, just like a hallucinogen. They can 
 produce red eyes and strain from trying to focus on obscure writing.
 /</-|/\/ U C WHa+ I /x\Ea/\/? Some files may give you a dry mouth, or 
 'cotton mouth' from drooling in anticipation of the ending of the file.
 It may put you in a state of euphoria where nothing maters, it may make you
 break out laughing, it may even make you hungry be suggesting food related
 things. It is warned that you may have a panic attack in relation to the 
 file. Short term memory loss may be increased because you have so much other
 shit filling your head. Mental Addiction can result from long term reading
 of separate files. This type of file is directly related to Marijuana.

  Some files will get you so pumped,  your heart rate and blood pressure 
 will increase. You may go into a state of brief intense euphoria, lost after
 you realize the file is complete bullocks. Much like a soap opera. Restless-
 ness and excitement of anticipation can occur after the file leaves you hang-
 ing. Following this is a long, drawn out, period of depression caused from
 the realization that you will have to wait to learn of the ending, or worse
 yet, the author may NEVER tell you. Addiction may result. People who read 
 these files may be in danger of heart attack, seizures, lung damage, 
 paranoia and severe depression. This type of file seems to be related to 
 cocaine.

  When a file gives you nausea, dizziness, headaches, and a lack of self 
 control.. you KNOW it is a inhalant. You may become unconscious. You may
 suffocate. You are causing damage to your nervous system, and sudden
 death may result. 

  When you stop feeling pain, you are vomiting a lot, your eyes water and
 your nose runs, chances are you have been exposed. Addiction my result from
 the Euphoria the file causes. You will become tired.  After long term
 use, you may loose weight. These files are narcotics. 

  The other day, i was reading this file.. After some time, i began feeling
 alert. I became extremely talkative. I felt my blood pressure pounding, my
 good mood was elevated to an ecstatic mood, and i felt like i could not
 eat a piece of rice with out exploding. After a little longer, i began
 feeling fatigued, exhausted and paranoid. Soon, i felt confused, depressed
 and i even had a hallucination. The next day it was clear to me i was
 exposed to a Stimulant inside of the text file.

  The problem with these files are you never know what kind of file you are
 getting and you never know what to expect. Because of this text file viewing
 can be lethal. It is in your best interest never to read another TFILE,
 especially by those damn HPAVC'ers who like to play pranks and spike their
 files with obscure FileDrugs(tm). If you are forced to read many text files,
 be sure you know and trust the source you obtain them. 

   And last but not least, NEVER read a text file from the group HoE! They
 are the ones who started this whole plot to drug up the world!

  -Your Big Brother, and Uncle, the all around inbreeder, SAM. (USA).

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  P.S.   Dear reader, Don't believe a word they said! You can trust us! We 
         are not that bad.  (Ahhh-hem). Right Mogel? 
              
                           [Of coarse!!@!@!]

    HoE would NEVER try and pressure you in to anything. Anything at all.
    Now, as i was saying before i wrote this all, Err, i mean i copied 
    it from a pamphlet , "Eat this 'shroom. It will make you happy. 
    Please?? Please? Just one! It will only taste bad for a few seconds.
    JUST ONE! Com'on!" , "Gulp", "Ok.. Thanks."

From: The Claminator
  To: Mogel
Subj: The uprising will come!
Stat: Private

  Dear Mogel,
    
    You are a fool! You don't realize the point to which our society has
sliden down into the trenches. We are beyond salvation, we are beyond
repair. And finally, our cruel injustices to the clams will be revenged.

    Yes, that's right. The clams. You don't get it, do you? I'm not 
surprised. It takes a true genius to realize these things, but finally,
after all the toxic dumping and inhumane, or, inclamane treatment to the
clams will be revenged. I'm currently training a secret commando group of
clams to kidnap the world's leaders and take them hostage. Yes, they will
come, and they will rise, and they will do my bidding!

    We will kidnap the world leaders and force our governments to right the
wrongs, pay the old debts, correct the old injustices, and fix the oceans.
They will come, and they will have no mercy. There will be no prisoners of
those who try and oppose us, and waste, destruction, chaos, and havoc will
be wreaked upon all who try to stop us. Resistance is futile.

    I am currently training them in a secret, underwater training facility to
become ruthless, mindless soldiers, sworn to listen to my every command. I
will admit, I am having a few difficulties right now. it's tough to wean them
off of their instinctual habits of sitting there in the water and gurgling
happily, but I will be successful, and then I will be vindicated!

    Don't you see? Chaos and infinite blackness surround us. Like the lost
Tower of Babel, we slowly sink into a never-ending void of ignorance and
misunderstanding. Love means nothing. Hate means nothing. Nothing is
everything. Even after the clams revolt and take over our evil, thoughtless,
and heartless society, chaos will still prevail. (They still gurgle happily,
by the way, but I think I'm getting them to bubble in an aggressive way).

    But this CAN change. Only YOU can make the difference. To help prevent
our slow demise into the cold, inevitable heat death of the universe, sign
up to be my friend for only $25! Yes, now, by being my friend, you can
insure that once I come to power, your puny lives will not be squashed by
my totalitarian regime! Act now while you still can.

    Beware the day of reckoning!

    It takes Nine.

is no light bulb.  One to go look for a light bulb.  One to go out to the
store and buy a new light bulb.  One to get electrocuted while installing the
light bulb.  One to accidentally step on and smash the light bulb.  One to go
back to the store and buy another light bulb.  One to make fun of all of the
people installing the light bulb.  and one to actually finally install it.

    You're going to kill us?  Why?  

    Here's a little information about me.  I figure if you want to insult me, 
you'd do a better job if you knew something.  I'm 18.  I don't like fast 
food.  I hate to tell you but you're calling the same BBS that we are.  I am
going to Rochester, but I will still run HOE and I will still be a presence 
here.  I will not insult YOU because I do not know you.  

    I don't think I have any "followers".  I think it would be pretty cool if 
I did.  But I don't.  You know, it's really sad to start one of your childish 
wars on me because I simply will not play your game.  If I do, it will only 
enhance then level of Moronics that you are demostarting on this board right

    Ah, Whisper.  Such a sweet word.  But, alas there's that damn virus.  As
some of you might know the goofy application maker that Spiff worked so very
hard programming was infected with the Virus and it spread.  I later found
out that the Virus was all over the place.  It was truly sad.  Psycho Santa
and Spiff were forced to totally re-format and others (/<0rrUpT) were messed
up a lot.  Sucks.  Well, I decided to start a little tiny journey collecting
data on the Virus to one day track down it's finder and talk to them.
   
   THEN RIP THEIR HEAD OFF.  Here's some data I had to start with.


------------------------------------------->>
 
 
 Virus Name:  Tai-Pan
 Aliases:     Whisper
 V Status:    Common
 Discovered:  July, 1994
 Symptoms:    .EXE file growth;
              decrease in total system & available free memory
 Origin:      Unknown
 Eff Length:  438 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRhE - Parasitic Resident .EXE Infector
 Detection Method:  AVTK 6.64+, ViruScan V117+, Sweep 2.67+, IBMAV 1.07E+,
                    NAV 3.0 9411+,
                    AVTN/N 6.64+, NShld V117+, Sweep/N 2.67+
 Removal Instructions:  Delete infected files

 General Comments:
       The Tai-Pan or Whisper virus was received in July, 1994.  Its origin
       or point of isolation is unknown, though it appears it may be in the
       public domain in North America.  Tai-Pan is a memory resident
       infector of .EXE programs which are smaller than approximately 64K.

       When the first Tai-Pan infected program is executed, the Tai-Pan
       virus will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory
       but below the 640K DOS boundary, not moving interrupt 12's return.
       Total system and available free memory, as indicated by the DOS
       CHKDSK
       program, will have decreased by 512 bytes.  Interrupt 21 will be
       hooked by the virus in memory.

       Once memory resident, this virus will infect .EXE programs when they
       are executed.  Infected programs will have a file length increase of
       438 bytes with the virus being located at the end of the file.  The
       program's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be
       altered.  The following text string is visible within the viral code
       in all infected programs:

               "[Whisper presenterar Tai-Pan]"

       It is unknown what Tai-Pan may do besides replicate.


------------------------------------------->>


   At any rate, I didn't really have clue where to being.  I posted a message
on a few Newsgroups and on board, but it seemed like no one either knew
anything or cared to help me.  Then someone told me that on Rush 2's board
(Unforeseen Danger), there was a post by a Stoner that was the "maker" of the
virus.  I checked it out and to my surprise I saw this post:

The whisper virus is everywhere, and it's quite slick. [I know, I co-wrote 
it]. At any rate, it has the ability to hide in data files as well as
exectubles, etc. The *NEXT* whisper will also have batch file infecting as
well [like a trojan].


------------------------------------------->>


   There were no futher connections with Stoner on the Virus.  He never
called back to comment on his future replies, etc.  The guy is some Courier
for the Ansi Group CiA.  Nothing futher has happened in the case.  I will be
watching and waiting for updates to this situation.  Send info my way if you
get it.  But recently I found out that the Whisper had hit some really
dickhead local WaReZ boards so hard they went down for good.  I guess it's
not all that bad after all.  Maybe I will give up the search.

   Recently, I decided to follow a more cDc/uXu type of release format.
In the future HOE-Dates there will be a description of each of the last
20 or so releases.  But, as is obvious, there were none for the issues all
the way up to now, #60.  I decided to catch up and do them here for your
reference.  Enjoy...


1)  "The Entropic Theme Song" by Defiant.  The issue that started it all.

Pork...
Cloggin' my vein
Pork!
I'm feelin' the pain
Pork!
Bacon-on-the-sly
Pork!
Stick a pig in my eye!

  *The Chorus*
Oh, I love pork,
Oh yes I do!
I could eat chops,
And pork rinds too!
"Pork's not healthy!"
I don't care!
Love pork so much,
I keep it in my underwear
Pork!

Pork!
Can't beat that taste
Pork!
Don't let the fat go to waste
Pork!
Made from piggies and lard
Pork!
Eat it in the backyard

*Chorus*

Pork!
I have a pork watch!
Pork!
Rub pork on my crotch!
Pork!
Hate to slaughter that hog!
Pork!
Piggies give me blowjobs!

*Chorus*

Pork!
Not healthy or neat!
Pork!
Eat it out on the street!
Pork!
Rub it between your feet!
Pork!
The meat that I like to eat!
Pork!
The meat that I like to eat!
