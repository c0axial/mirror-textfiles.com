        In my trek across the wastes of Seattle, I made my way through a
random Cemetary that I saw which was short cut to the site for HOE-HOE-Con.
By cruel fate, this happened to be the Cemetary which held the body of
Kurt Cobain.  As I walked by the grave, Kurt Cobain's arm plunged from the
soil below and took hold of my ankle.  I attemped to run in pure fear, but
I could not break free of it's grasp.  As I paniced in horror the ground
opened up before me and Kurt arose from the depths below.  I colapsed to 
the ground and he spoke to me.  The following is the exact dialogue that
occured between us:

Kurt: "Mad Arab, I have traveled fom my icey home below to save the world.
       I have searched for eternities, until I found the chosen one.  You my
       son, are the chosen one."
MA: "Choosen for what?!"
Kurt: "You are the one who can save the world."
MA: "HOW!?!"
Kurt: "You must make an Instant /<-RaD Cool D00d3 Kit, which will turn any
       lamer into a /<-C00L D00d3.  Only then will mankind have the strength
       to over come the battle."
MA: "What battle?"
Kurt: "Christ, I don't know.  Look, just make the damn kit, I gotta go back
       to geting raped."

        And with that the sky grew dark and a strange mist engulfed us.  
Kurt disappeared, and when the mist had cleared, everything seemed back to
normal.  

        Until you got this funky util!

        What this puppy will do is transform anyone into an instant /<-RaD
d00d3.  And if by some off chance you wish to use normal lettering, simply
hit the caps-lock key and everything is normal.  This program will only work
if you have Ansi.sys loaded and do not have an anti-key remapping util in
memory.  Also, it only works in DOS.  I plan to have this corrected by the
full s00per N0n-Alpha-Gamma-Beta release, but for now, Ansi codes are used
to transform you into a d00d3.

        This is actually release v1.1 as I have refined the source code,
taking out extra shit, and coded it a tad better.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

        In the Zip we have included a Running Copy of the Program.  Just
Run K-Rad.Bat.  But since we are so ELiTE, Here's the /<-rIFiK Source 
/<0dE! in Pascal for it:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program K_RaD;

Type screentype = array [0..3999] of byte;

Var  screen : screentype absolute $b800:0000;

Const K_c00l=('                       Programmed By: Mad Arab');

procedure putup;
begin

Gotoxy(1,15);
