        "irc is what happens to you while you're
         busy making plans to buy dvd's"
                                - john lennon

        it's hard to introduce the animix phenomenon.

        the elements are simple.  a frightfully alone man in his mid to late
 twenties, in college since before most ansi sceners were born, wasting away
 his life on an irc channel day in and day out.  a man who reports upon 
 the cd's in his cd player, the software he is downloading, and any other
 aspects of his hopelessly boring life.  a tortured soul who sporadically
 makes the strangest comments, directed simultaneously at nobody in
 particular-- and at the depths of your soul.  but animix is more than that.
 and the animix experience is damn near indescribable.

        we can reduce "non sequitur" to a definition in a dictionary, but
 then we lose track of what it means to have a person like animix on irc.
 this log of his wisdom, compiled over several years, is somewhat
 misleading.  for of course it is not so much what he says, but how he says
 it-- that is, earnestly, while oblivious to everything around him-- and
 when; the way he can fill the screen at 4am when nobody is talking, or the
 way he wakes up after months of ignorance to lashes out at someone who is
 mocking him, perhaps the first time he has ever responded to his irc
 environment.

        the nick, as we have mentioned, is animix.

        his ircname?

        "Artist / Genius."

        and unbeknownst to him, his contribution to the world has been
 noted.  we have marked his words, and paid close attention whenever he
 spoke.  this is his legacy.

        we donate this to humanity.

        signed,
        dennis courtney and basehead
