 <anjee> Yeah, too bad Mogel died
 <trilobyte> it's no real loss-- I can emulate mogel perfectly by putting a
             mogel pack into my gameboy, then attaching the super gameboy,
             then putting the whole thing into the super-NES and using the
             video-out to have him talk on IRC once again. watch!
 <Jamesy> this should be rather impressive...Still, I get the feeling that
          without the real-life Mogel, I'll have no one to play off of.
 *** m0g-sim (trilo@sgb.infosaurus.com) has joined #ezines
 <m0g-sim> hello all! I am a perfect m0gel simulation!
 <caitlin> hi mogel!
 <m0g-sim> Hello! I am Jewish!
 <anjee> no you aren't.
 <m0g-sim> sorry!
 <trilobyte> hmmm...
 <Jamesy> I can't tell the difference! 

 (Meanwhile, in #teen-slutz)
 <metalchic> yeah, it's sort of sad that mogel is dead. but wasn't he like,
             Buddhist or something? what an idiot. oh, and art is way cuter.
 <free-pr0n> FREE XXX GOAT Pr0N, www.voicenet.com/~poupey

 (Back in #ezines !)
 <m0g-sim> yes, for ITIC#2 trilobyte is going to completely robotosize me
           using the NES robot
 <anjee> you should be more sociable
 <tashy> ...
 <tashy> has anyone seen aster lately?
 <m0g-sim> she dissapeared! sorry!
 <tashy> oh.
 <m0g-sim> I love you!
 *** aster (aster@secret.lair.com) has joined #ezines
 <aster> so, I heard mogel died.
 * aster dances madly
 <aster> my pet flower died once!
 <m0g-sim> The person I'm copying may be dead, but the m0g-bot lives on!
 <Jamesy> How did you hear about mogel dying anyway, aster? When have you been on?
 <aster> well, you see...
 <aster> lets just say a little bird told me.
 *** aster has quit IRC (the daisys aren't in my minD! LaLAla!)
 <Jamesy> curioser and curioser...
 <AIDS> shut up Jamesy.

 [-----]

        A dark room with a single computer and two chairs, one with a girl
 about 15 years of age tied to it and gagged, the other with a 30'ish,
 mustachio'd man sitting.  There is a single noise in the room: the man's
 manic laughter.  As the man settles down and picks up a phone, the girl
 screams.  The gag completely muffles it.  The monitor on the computer reads:
 *** Disconnected.  The girl screams again.

 To be continued in Part 6... Retribution or Death?
