                (Save these!  They are collectors items!)
        

        I am a cool guy and shit.  That's right.. even as ELITE as I am, I 
still must proform the same bodily fuctions that you do.  Wow.  Okay, here's
the deal.. even though HOE is not really mega-super-hyper-mondo structured,
I was requested a lot to put a member list up... so I'm doing more than 
that!!! THAT'S HOW ELITE I AM.  HAHAHAHA!!!  Here's a HOE-UPDATE, followed
by a Member list, followed by the Distro Site list, followed by a really 
Elite play with the Distro SysOps as the cast, followed by the Small 19-issue 
index.  Told ya' I was ELITE!!!
        Welp, as I have said in the past HOE is moving it's way to being...
well, uhh... well it's moving to being something.... but I slowly feel that
I am and can accomplish my dream of being another mover and shaker, and 
money maker in what the people that need lables would call "the scene".   
        What I do know is, so far it's been fun.  That's what is important
here anyway, right???  We are looking for good writers for HOE as you know...
making it better and better...with your help.  Also, we're at a sort of 
beginning here, so we need feedback.  It's important.  So far the feedback 
has been more specific towards individual articles.  Most people seem to 
think that the group is something that is original in that it's not the 
standard k-rad fuckup h/p/a group that releases un-original shit that 
basically comes from a million other text files.  We like that.  That is 
what we're trying to do here...that's why we believe that it's time we turn
the angle of the text file more on the people of the h/p/a world and what 
they are thinking about life.  How many times have you read someone write
"hackers are like this and that..."??? It's time to write: "I am like THIS."
                        Fight the old.  
                        Fuck the norm.  
                        Write the file.
                        Love the Spam.
        On a side note, If anyone is willing to give random things to HOE,
that would interest us, we'd love them.  I'm still looking for a Mod with
pig sounds.  Since HOE really only puts out text files(which is what I WANT),
I think I'm going to complie all the original sounds, and picture files that
I get and I'll release those all in one big pack some day.
        Oh, and I'd like to thank Abigwar for hooking up with us.. when I
wrote him e-mail the very first time I thought he would just blow me off, 
but I was wrong.  He has become an important brick in the wall that HOE is
becoming.  Originally, the Abster was going to just do like one or so files
as a one-shot deal....but he had more to write so he's here now with us...
but if other writers that are dedicated to a group so want to hook up with
us for a "one-shot" that's okay too... as I've said, HOE isn't super-mega
strict.  And because of our "angle" I feel HOE is not really the sort of 
"competition" that I see h/p/a groups having all the time.  I'll leave you 
now, but remember this....the t-file is a chance for your voice to be 
heard...your permanent voice....

        Special thanks to [GiMP] for creating a really RaD file, the /<-RaD
        Konverter.  Here's and example of your conversion (with a little 
        peronal editing added) as we present...

        (Warning: If you take this seriously, then you are a loser.
                  This is fictional too, in case you were really dumb.)

        The scene opens under a dark bush, where Mogel, the /<-RaD d00d 
        hacker and his phreak bUDDi3, Dark PHiB3r are on a lab top Beige 
        Boxin'.  Mogel is feeling eXtrA ELITE since he has just hacked into
        a FED computer system and is capturing important documents.  Dark
        pHiBeR iZ feelin' pretty phunky too.

Mog: "hahahaha dEwD!!!  wE dId iT!!! tHiZ r0X!!!"
DP: "yayayayay just hurry up man..."
Mog: "heeeyyy.. don't you worry... I goTZZDAAA l0CKiN' tr4C3 DAT mAk3Z iT s0
      da fEdZ won't catch uS!!!!"
DP: "RaD!"
Mog: "d00d, you taugh me how to do that...remember?"
DP: "Oh yeah.  See, I'm so Elite I forgot!"
Mog: "No wait, I'm more Elite.  I was the one that hacked the system!"
DP: "No wait!  I'm more Elite!!  not only do I have A11 the B0x files and
     scenes MEMORIZED, BuT I c4n sp3ak them BACK\x/eRdz!"
Mog: "n000 w4Y, dEwd!!! That SUX!! I'm more ELITE... I have a 0-2 day wArEz

DP: "No wAiT.. I'm m0r3 ELiTE!!! I'm a diZtr0 sit3 4 23 AnZi gr0ups and i

     I say 0n a moments notice!" [DP reachs into his tiny bag and pulls out
     Wolverine-X's head...]
wv: "Hey dood!!!" [DP then stuff the head back in the bag!]
Mog: "RaD! That's Elite, dEwD!"

        Meanwhile, two FedZ have traces DP and Mog and are running towardZ
        the site where they are.  They are about 2 bl0ckZ away.  

Casp: "We've almost got them!"
Hey: "Yeah, these punks were easy to get... ahaha.. they used the oldest
      'anti-lockin trace' doc there is around..."
Casp: "I can't wait to NAIL them!" [Haywood stops running]
Hey: "Hey, I didn't know you were gay.  Me too!" [He starts running again.

        Meanwhile, we cut to Psychotic Protic, who has no lines in this 
        play, and just waves like a moron and realizes that he is the safest
        person in this barrage of stupidity!  Meanwhile again, the fedZ 
        have caught up to the doodz.

Casp: "HEY KIDS!"
Haywood: "STOP IN THE NAME OF THE LAW!"
Mog: "ho tihs!"
DP: "kcuf em!"
Casp: "Yes, kiddies, we're the FBI, now turn around and put your hands over
       your head!"
DP: "Mogel!!  doood!!!  you said 'diZ wouldn't hapP3n!!!"
Mog: "tHAt'Z wH4t y0U sAiD dood!! What are we g0nnA dooo to g3T awAY!!!??"
DP: "I know!!"
Mog: "What?"
DP: "I'll summon the Devil."
Mog: "dood!!  kewl.. do it!!!"
DP: "DEVIL DEVIL DEVIL!  WE HAVE SERVED YOU WELL!! COME COME COME!!!"

        DP waves his hands widly like a moron, and the Fedz begin to laugh
        in the pathetic display... then DP makes random chirk sounds like a
        pingeon, and the feds roll on the floor laughing!  But, then, 
        suddenly the Devil Appears in a puff of Blue Smoke.

Luci: "What seems to be the problem boys?"
Mog: "dood!!! TheZe fEdZ wanna LOK uZ up!!"
DP: "yah, dEwD, you gotta help uZ!!!!"
Luci: "Well, I can help you, but first ask me this.. do you have any /<0dEz?"
Mog: "aww she33t dood, I left dEM at Home....."
Luci: "HAHAHAAHAHA, no REAL servant of the devil would not have /<0dEz.. you
       two are LaMeRz!!11!!11" [And with that the Devil disappears!]
Mog: "Yo.....dood.. what we gonNNA d0 n0W!?"
DP: "I know!!"
Mog: "What?"
DP: "I'll summon my Grandma!"
Mog: "dood!! RaD!  do it!!!"
DP "GRANDMA GRANDMA GRANDMA YOUR GRANDSON IS IN TROUBLE!! COME COME COME!!!"
Casp: "That won't do you any good!"
Hay: "Yah, the Devil wouldn't even help you!"

        Suddenly, Grandma Appears in a puff of Grey smoke.  She has a very
        large purse stuffed full of.....of grandma things.  

jj: "hi sonny.. what's the problem?"
DP: "Grandmama... doZ mEnZ wAnTa HuRt UZZZ!!!!!"
jj: "Really?  I'll show them!"

        Grandma begins to beat the living "tar" out of the Feds and they 
        run away in fear.  

DP: "TaNkZ granmama!"
jj: "Well, I hope you boys learned something from this little experience!"
Mog: "YaH!!  n3Xt TiM3 wE bRiNg s0Me /<0dEz wiff uZ!!!"
