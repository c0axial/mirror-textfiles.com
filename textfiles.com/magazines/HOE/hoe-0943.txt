 *** You were kicked from #ezines by swisspope (Behave)
 *** #ezines can't join channel (you're banned!)
 -> *swisspope* That wasn't very nice
 *swisspope* you were flooding
 -> *swisspope* I wasn't flooding. I was just talking.
 -> *swisspope* Just like a normal human. There was at least 5 seconds
                between each sentence
 -> *swisspope* You must be very proud of your power
 -> *TanAdept* G0ff, will you unban me? Phil is being an asshole
 -> *swisspope* c'mon motherfucker unban me
 *** #ezines can't join channel (you're banned!)
 *** swisspope is ~foo@titanic.theatrium.net (floof)
 *** on channels: #start.no 
 *** on irc via server irc.concentric.net (Concentric Network Corporation)
 *** #ezines can't join channel (you're banned!)
 -> *swisspope* your such a bastard, unban my shit you pathetic little man
 -> *swisspope* I guess this is considered flooding too, huh? You dried up
                little cow testicle you
 -> *swisspope* hey, you weren't even typing anything and you think I'm
                flooding, your such a bitch
 -> *swisspope* Really I have nothing better to do, realize this, I could
                go on for a while
 -> *swisspope* but I guess your prepared for that kind of thing
 -> *swisspope* being someone who spends most of his time judging people
                in an irc chat room
 -> *swisspope* you've got to be prepared to accept the wrath of innocent
                by standards who know nothing of computers but can easily
                be bullied by large corporate dicksnots like yourself
 -> *swisspope* it must be fun and relaxing to just sit there all day,
                huh?
 -> *swisspope* I bet your all fat and shit
 -> *swisspope* Maybe I should do this Nybar style and pretend I have
                rhythm and style and start rapping
 -> *swisspope* Jump up on this bitch with a mic in hand, no doubt in
                everyones eyes that I'm truly the man
 -> *swisspope* Or maybe I'll pretend to be an angsty teen who takes it
                upon themselves to judge another's t-file unfairly
 -> *swisspope* A whole lot of judging goin on!
 -> *swisspope* Sometimes I wonder if you heard a word I said, funny thing
                is in real life that I'd bust yo head
 -> *swisspope* word to the mothafuckin, uh, uncontested nigga of the
                year, swissdick!
 -> *swisspope* actually I think your all the same people, You, AIDS,
                Nybar... you all pretty much talk the same
 -> *swisspope* And you all treat people like shit and get away with it
 -> *swisspope* mostly because your behind a computer, and you know what
                your doing with it
 -> *swisspope* Now what I thought was really funny was when bos took over
                the channel as his own and none of you could touch him
 -> *swisspope* he actually asked me to help him take it back, and I said
                no, because I didn't want to look bad in you peoplez eyes
 -> *swisspope* We all have regrets that
 -> *swisspope* haunt us for the rest of our lives
 -> *swisspope* I'm pretty sure your mom has a big one.
               HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
 -> *swisspope* Really that wasn't even funny, so I don't blame you for
                not laughing
 -> *swisspope* This is all pretty immature really, not even my style to
                verbally assault someone as pathetic and worthless such as
                yourself, but I think its all pretty fun
 -> *swisspope* are you having fun swissnuts?
 -> *swisspope* I hope so, otherwise this is all in vein. or vain.
 -> *swisspope* You know what I did today? I slept till like 11 o clock. I
                must have been tired
 -> *swisspope* I'd go back to bed, but I'm not even the tiniest bit
                sleepy, but I am in the mood to type
 -> *swisspope* but you know that, because you banned me for typing.
 -> *swisspope* but now I can type to you! all night! yay!
 -> *swisspope* how do you feel about that, swisscheese?
 -> *swisspope* wow, your being awfully quiet
 -> *swisspope* I know a lot of assholes, and most of them are loud, but
                you must be an exception
 -> *swisspope* take AIDS for example! Now that fuck is LOUD! I bet when
                he gets drunk he must set the roof on fire up in that
                bitch
 -> *swisspope* but your quiet. I guess your the type who sits in the back
                of the club and wishes he wasn't so pale and scrawny
 -> *swisspope* No wait, your fat, I remember
 -> *swisspope* hahahaha
 -> *swisspope* hahaha
 -> *swisspope* tee hee
 -> *swisspope* ok, I'm done laughing, now lets get serious.
 -> *swisspope* What happened here today? I was typing out my feelings and
                emotions in the ezines channel, while nobody was saying
                anything, and suddenly there was a net split and when
                everyone comes back, *I* get banned
 -> *swisspope* c'mon cheesenuts, does that seem fair to you?
 -> *swisspope* but what would you know about fair, really, there is no
                justice over this mesh of wires and chips
 -> *swisspope* So you can continue to be an asshole all you want and I'll
                continue to sit and whine about how much of an asshole you
                are and nothing will ever get done
 -> *swisspope* but we'll have fun doin it!
 -> *swisspope* Do you like Chemical Brothers, swissnuts? Can I call you
                swissnuts?
 -> *swisspope* I'm downloading some of their mp3z right now as I rant to
                you
 -> *swisspope* so if I don't insult you for a few minutes, its because
                I'm busy
 -> *swisspope* hope you don't mind
 -> *swisspope* You know what? I'm going to refer you to one of my t-filez
                and then leave you in peace swissnuts.
 -> *swisspope* it's called "A testament of attitude". You should read it.
                Let it become your bible, my son. Live by it.
 -> *swisspope* For now, swissnuts, I shall depart. I truly hope we can
                speak again someday. Well, not really. What I really hope
                is that you die in a tragic freak toaster accident, but we
                all don't get what we want now do we!??
 -> *swisspope* live short in disaster
