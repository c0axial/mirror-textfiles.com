        Well, I thought that my soul had been freed and that God was smiling
 upon me in my mature college-girl state.  But, alas, I was wrong.  I was
 innocently using AOL Instant Messenger (the emacs version, of course), when
 suddenly!  I was accosted by invitations to a so-called "BUDDY" chat.  I
 figured that, perhaps, my BUDDIES would be there, so I accepted.

        What ensued after I accepted this invitation was horrifying!
 Suddenly, I was no longer in the safety of my Worcester apartment.. I was
 transported back to Toll Gate High School, Warwick, RI circa 1997!  I could
 almost hear the high pitched GIRLZ squealing the words which appeared on my
 screen..

        "hi girls how are you how is school??"

        "i am good are you going home this weekdn???  who is laja ajna??"

        "i dont know! who are you tell us tell us!!"

        When I came to the realization that I was suddenly surrounded by
 once-popular two dimensional beings, i fled for the nearest exit, only to be
 greeted by the following "flame" from someone who wouldnt give me the time
 of day in high school (THAT'S YOU, DOUG BLOOM).  Apparently, I should just
 be happy that he even said hello to me.

 [Conversation with QuinBrave on Fri Oct  8 13:38:12 1999]

 QuinBrave: hey whats your deal who stuck the pole up your ass why do
            you have to be such a bitch. you cant just be glad you actually
            had someone who wanted to say hi, i guess not go back to doing
            whatever the fuck it is that you do and whatever the fuck it was
            you did in high school i guess, god what a winner you turned out
            to be!!!

 Laja Ajna: AHAHA

 Laja Ajna: OH MY GAWD

 Laja Ajna: you dont even KNOW how hilarious this is

 Laja Ajna: I AM SAVING THIS FOREVER

 Laja Ajna: I will put it in a HEART and hang it on my wall

 QuinBrave: you do that

 Laja Ajna: next to the SHRINE i built to TOLL GATE

 QuinBrave: sounds like a party

 Laja Ajna: AW YEAH, D0UD.

 QuinBrave: sounds like someone didnt get the best of their high school years
            and is taking it out on everyone else

 QuinBrave: shouldve gone to bay view [** see below] i guess

 Laja Ajna: Right, and now I am regreting EVERY MOMENT in my DEPRIVED LIFE

 QuinBrave: or something like that i guess, what the hell are you talking
            about

 Laja Ajna: I will never live up to my true potential because i didnt turn
            out like you!

 Laja Ajna: I dont even know who you are!

 QuinBrave: right right, because i said that

 QuinBrave: yes you do

 Laja Ajna: Vague images of days blocked out count not as knowledge.

 Laja Ajna: Hopefully my therapy can help me recover from this conversation.
