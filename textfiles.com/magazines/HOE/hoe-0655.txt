        sir!

        you have a communicable disease!  don't you understand!  spread this
 to your enemies!  sleep with them if you have to!

        passing up this opportunity would be a crime!

 > Dear Clyde,
 > I was just wondering if you could help me.
 >
 > How am I, as a man, supposed to understand what women are trying to say?
 > They say one thing and then they think that we understand them, even
 > though we have no clue at all.
 >
 > Please, help me Clyde - and you will be my savior, my hero.
 >
 > Paul

 paul!

        i know exactly what you mean!  and i am not a woman, so i mean what i
 say! i mean it!  so here are some things you could do!

        1.  blow away the ears of the female in question!  sign language
            never lies!

        2.  blow away your own eyes!  braille doesn't lie either!  they will
            have to tell you what they mean!

        3.  turn gay!

        i hope that one of these solutions will work for you!  remember, the
 disclaimer on my web page says that i am not responsible for your actions as
 a result of this email!
