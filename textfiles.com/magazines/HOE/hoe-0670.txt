        Some of you may know this; I'm not sure how extensively the darker
 rumors about me have spread.  I'll let you in on the secret, though, since
 this short tail depends on you knowing.  I am a mage.  That's right, a real,
 living, breathing magic user.  My specialty is polymorphing.  If you've
 never played Warcraft 2, I'll let you know what that is, as well.  I can
 change shapes to emulate different people or objects.  Girls are my
 specialty.  I really enjoy pretending to be girls.  That way, I can trick
 poor losers into thinking I'm interested in them, all the while secretly
 smiling on the inside, knowing that I myself am not a girl at all, but a
 guy.

        Anyway, today was great.  I pretended to be this girl in jeans and
 platform shoes.  I walked around campus for awhile, looking for my target.
 Trust me, this is U of I, there is no shortage of young nerds just ripe for
 the taking.  Today I found my mark with little to no trouble.

        He was fat, that was the first thing I noticed.  Fat, with poofy,
 ridiculous hair that almost made me laugh out loud when I first saw it.  He
 was just sitting on a bench, resting his rolls of obese grandeur, futilely
 scanning some dumb book in front of him.  Around his massive gourd he'd
 somehow managed to fit a pair of headphones, although God knows how he
 managed that. He was gently rocking away to whatever rotten crap he was
 listening to and reading.  Maybe just enjoy the nice day.  So I decided to
 ruin it for him.
 
        Carefully, I sat down next to him.  I knew he saw me; I could feel
 him undressing my soft, supple body with his whore eyes.  I imagined that
 he'd probably never seen an exposed bosom in his life, which made me even
 more pleased.  Yet he just sat there.  Clearly, a girl walking up and
 sitting next to a guy, when there are empty seats elsewhere, is a sign that
 conversation might not be too bad an option, although I've found that stupid
 nerds are too timid to say anything at all, even if they want to, which just
 makes things even hotter.  And of course, he just sat there, like some big
 retard... heck, maybe he even WAS a retard, and didn't say a word, despite
 the numerous glances.

        Soon, I began to smoke.  I could tell he didn't smoke because he
 didn't look or smell the part, and, well, he just wasn't COOL enough, just
 to see if he'd get me to stop. But he didn't.  He simply allowed me to keep
 on smoking.  It was really quite amusing.  I just sat there, staring off
 into the distance, and this big dumb pretended to listen to his music and
 read, all the while fucking me within his mind.  I'm not one to get turned
 on by such things, but if I were, I would have been very turned on, despite
 the fact that this person was a hideous beast.

        It was even funnier when his CD player died.  Do you know what he
 did when his CD player died?  He PRETENDED to listen to music, just so he
 didn't have to talk to me!  I mean, what if I really weren't a guy?  What if
 he was missing out on talking to the perfect person for him?  (Clearly this
 couldn't be the case, for there is no "perfect" person for someone who looks
 like THAT)  It didn't matter, though.  He just sat there, stupidly,
 pretending to read.

        Soon I got up and walked behind a van, disappearing.  But I've often
 thought back to that glorious day when I tricked a big, fat, ugly retard
 into falling in love with me.
