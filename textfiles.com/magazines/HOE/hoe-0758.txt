        Polish your seafood very well with a dishrag.  Make it good and
 shiny.  Look at your lungs.  Rip open your ribcage and look at them.  Stand
 in front of a mirror.  Rub the mirror against your chest, getting blood
 and entrails all over it.  Stick your finger in the little streaks of blood
 left on the mirror and rub it around.  Make doodles.  Pour vinegar over
 your own head, and run around the earth backwards until you become wine.
 Consecrate yourself.  Bury your knee in a wonded heart and lick it.  Make
 clicking noises with your tongue.  Fall down, play human.  Apply
 tourniquets liberally.  Rip a rubber band into at least twelve pieces.
 Draw a pentagram and lie on the floor naked in the middle of it while
 partygoers in Richard Nixon masks scatter prescription drugs in gaussian
 patterns around you.  Perform divination with Boggle.  Speak with a lisp,
 Wear iron pants.  Blade.  Build a miniature replica of "The Rack" to put
 hot dogs on.  Count to seven.

        You know very well what to do.
