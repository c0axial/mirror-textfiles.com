                                by -> Aster

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        le and kurt had been best friends for a very long time. they
 understood each other. they thought themselves higher than the other as
 well. this is what caused their latest argument. they both wore green pants,
 yellow shrits, and bright orange socks to the nail factory evewry morning.
 one day le decided he would where green socks instead, so he stayed up all
 night (despite serial's cast iron pot) making green socks out of kurt's
 pants. in the morning kurt did not notice and went to work with no pants on.
 half-way throught the day he reallized that le's socks were nbot blinding
 him like they usually did, and then realized he had no pants. he was very
 mad.

        "DUSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

        "no!" le screamed.

        "window dust!!!!!!!!!!"

        "off!"

        "beeeeeeeeeeeer dust!!!"

        "yes!"

        "beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 eeeeeeeeeeeeeer!"

        "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

        eventually they got so loud that the manager threw them, and their
 roommate, remote out. they were fired. so they went home. le gave back the
 pants, and kurt tried to put them on but the would not get past his knees.
 so they instantly forgot about the whople thing when serial booped em on the
 heads with the cast iron pot. from that day on kurts pant6s never fit, and
 le got more blinded because more of kurts socks showed.

 MORAL(s):

 1) live by yourself.

 2) don't wear clothes you non-existent roommate would want

 3) don't read stupid things like this

 4) be more creative

 5) GET OFF YOUR ASS

 6) DO SOMETHING DAMMIT

 7) DON"T SIT THERE UN YOUR FAT ASS ALL DAY READING STUPID MIXED UP STUPID
    STORIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 8) okay. I will say it one more time, do something.

        I have one more thing to say, before you get off your ass and do
 something. serial does not take any responsibility for being so irresistible
 that ppl start whacking ppl on the head with cast iron pots, because they
 want to be like himn and then get arrested.

        okay, I am done now.

        do something.

        do something.

        do something.

        do something.

        do something.

        do something.

        do something.
