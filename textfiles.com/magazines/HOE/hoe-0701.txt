        He is on a bus.  The sky dimbs and is grey-blue.  The universe is
 grey-blue and cold.  He sits next to something on a seat facing the oppisit
 way the bus is going.  The something is she.  She is covered by a grey old
 blanket.  He is covered with a light grey whool coat with a hood.  She holds
 a pen and runs it over his coat starting at his hood.  It is a gentle
 prodding.  This simple action seems very nature as if he already saw it
 happen seconds before it had.  He flows with the stream now.  Turns his
 attention to her without moving his head.  He trys ineptly to embrace her
 and sumbit to her, to show her he is now hers.  He loves her.

        As time passes the connect between the two grows stale.  He feels as
 if he holds a lifeless thing.  She falls away from him.  He tells himself
 the only thing that can help this situation is non-action.  He lets all
 things flow into place now.  He sits as he did before.  She holds a pen and
 runs it over his coat starting at his hood.  It is a gentle prodding.  The
 simple joy he once knew returns.  It stops though.  She becomes non-action.
 He talks to her now.

        he, "Lie see comma"

        she says much in reply but there is no words

        he, "you"

        she, "do in place, something not to be told"

        She is the machine now.  She is the intellectual.  She is the
 commander, the master.  She is soft and below in a dark place.  A dark place
 that is very noble.  He can not understand her words.  He trys very hard.

        he, "repeat"

        she, "do in place, something not to be told"

        he thinks he understands now

        he, "I love you!"

        she, "bleh"

        She tells him he must go a certian coordinate and shows him her
 electronic interface.  It is attached to her.  He seems to know what he must
 do.  He presses some arrow buttons.  A trailing thought is that all is lost
 because he does not keep up with her orders or does not hear her.

        he thinks, "my love tests me to the extreme, perhaps she is old and
 tired and wishes for me to fail and thus die so that she herself may rest.
 She sees what I do not.  She sees that something is wrong and must not live
 on.  I want to die with her."
