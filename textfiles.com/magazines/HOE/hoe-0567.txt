     I seem to do my best IRC work when no one is paying attention.  Here
 is an example of what happens when I am in a channel and no one is
 responding.

 *** Now talking in #log
 *** Topic is 'i fight for VINEGAR PANTS, MAYONAISE BRA, and SOY SAUCE
              KATANA II!'

 <oregano2K> hello all
 <oregano2K> buggy buggy buggy
 <oregano2K> jessie has a buggy
 <oregano2K> the buggy drives in the hilly country
 <oregano2K> hilly is the buggy then fluffy bunny hops besides the buggy
 <oregano2K> fluffy bunny cries, "jessie in the buggy, come out and play."
 <oregano2K> but jessie was tired, all that time in the buggy and jessy did
             not sleep
 <oregano2K> the buggy was jiggly on the rocky road
 <oregano2K> jessie was angry and refused to play with fluffy bunny.
 <oregano2K> but fluffy bunny didn't mind
 <oregano2K> or at least pretended not to.
 <oregano2K> and he removed some spokes from the hilly buggy's wooden
             wheelies.
 <oregano2K> jessy rode on past the poison-ivy forest.
 <oregano2K> and the wheel gave way and pitched jessy into the poison ivy
 <oregano2K> and the runny buggy caught fire and exploded sending a sharp
             piece of metal into jessy's brain
 <oregano2K> but jessy survived
 <oregano2K> and from then on, jessy always stopped to play with fluffy
             bunny
 <oregano2K> though she never realised it since she was trapped in her own
             little world.
 <oregano2K> the end.
 <oregano2K> I take it no one is here.
 <oregano2K> at least I got a h0e piece out of no one being here.
