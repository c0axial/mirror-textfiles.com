        Note: Thanks to responses we have been alerted of some mistakes in
        two HoE files.  "Nirvana Unlimited" and "Mortal Kombat II" both
        had a few minor mistakes.  We have re-edited both files and there
        is a "note" attached 009 at the top and 006 at the bottom, and both 
        of the "good" versions state that they are corrected.  Thanks to 
        Everlast and Spiff for spotting my goofs.

            "The Violent Femmes...They bring all their equipment 
              on the bus...and you can't FUCK with the Violent 
                 Femmes!  You CAN NOT fuck with this band!"


        1) Waiting for the Bus

You got the mother and her kids, 
you got the guy and his date.  
We all get mad, 
we all get late.
Looks like somebody forgot about us,
standing on the corner waiting for a bus.

Say, "Hey Mr. Driverman...don't be slow,
'cause I got somewhere I gotta go."
Say, "Hey Mr. Driverman...drive that thing fast,
my precious time keeps slippin' past.

Let's call the mayor,
let's complain.
It look's like the city's done it to us again.
Tied up in traffic - What do ya' know?
The damn city bus moves so slow.

    Driver: Young man your transfers expired would you please pay full fair?
    Dude: I just got this transfer.        
    Other Dude: Hey, could you open up the back door?
    Driver: Either pay your 65 cents or you'll have to leave the bus.
    Dude: You gotta be kidding me - I just got it!
    Other Dide: Would you please open up the back door?!?
        
        2) Blister in the Sun

When I go walkin' I strut my stuff and I'm so strung out.
I'm high as a kite and I just might stop to check you out.

Lemme go on,
I get blistered in the sun.
Lemme go on,
Big hands I know you're the one.

Body and beats,
I stain my sheets and I don't even know why,
My girlfriend,
she's at the end,
she is starting to cry.

        3) Gone Daddy Gone

Beautiful girl - love your dress,
high school smiles - oh yes!
Beautiful girl - love your dress,
where she is now I can only guess,
'cause it's gone daddy gone,
love is gone...away.

When I see you eyes will turn blue.
When I see you a thousand eyes turn in blue.

I can tell by the way that you switch your walk,
I can tell by the way that you baby talk,
I can know by the way that you treat your man,
I could love you baby, it's a cryin'...

Beautiful girl - love your dress,
15 smiles - oh yes.
Beautiful girl - love your dress,
where she is now I can only guess,
'cause it's gone daddy gone,
love is gone...away.

        4) Gimme the Car

Come on dad - Gimme the car tonight,
I got this girl,
I wanna <BOING>

I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do:
I'm gonna pick her up,
I'm gonna get her drunk,
I'm gonna make her cry,
I'm gonna get her high,
I'm gonna make her laugh,
I'm gonna make her Shhhhhh...

Woman,
I know she's it,
'cause I'm gonna touch her all over her body...
and she can touch me all over my body!

Time goes by I can feel myself growing old,
burning insides makin' this boy turn out cold.
What's wrong?  What's right?
I don't care when I hate my life.
What's wrong?  What's right?
People don't care when they hate thier life!
But how can I explain Personal Pain?
How can I explain?  My voice is in vain.
How can I explain?  The deep down...Driving!

Hey dad, Speaking of Driving,
Come on Dad - Gimme the car tonight.
Oh this much he don't understand,
I just might never make it to a man.

Come on Dad - Gimme the car.
Come on Dad - I ain't no runt.
Come on Girl - Gimme your <BOING>,
'cause I ain't got nothing to live for!

        5) Country Death Song

I had me a wife,
I had me some daughters.
I tried so hard,
I never knew still still waters.
Nothing to eat and nothing to drink.

Nothing for a man to do but sit around and think.
I been thinking and I'm thinking, 
'till there ain't nothing I ain't thunk.
Breathin' in the stink,
till finally I stunk.
It was at that time,
I swear I lost my mind!
I started making plans to kill my own kind.

"Come little daughter," I said to the youngest one,
"Put your coat on, We'll have some fun!
We'll go out to the mountain,
the one to explore."
Facin' it up, I was standing by the door.

Come little daughter, 
I will carry the lantern,
We'll go out tonight,
We'll go out to the caverns,
We'll go out tonight,
We'll go out to the caves.
Kiss your mother goodbye and remember that god saves.

I led her to a hole, 
a deep black well,
I said "Make a wish,
and be sure and not tell.
Now close your eyes and count to seven.
Know your papa loves you,
your children go to heaven."

I gave her a push,
I gave her a shove,
I pushed with all my might,
I pushed will all my love,
I threw my child into a bottomless pit!
She was was screamin' as she fell,
but I never heard her hit.

Gather 'round boys to the tale that I tell,
you wanna know how to take a short trip to hell?
It's garunteed to get your own place in hell!
Just take your lovely daughter and push her in a well,
take your lovely daughter and throw her in a well.
Don't speak to me of lovers with a broken heart,
you wanna know what will really tear you apart?
I'm goin' out to the barn where I never stop in pain,
I'm goin' out to the barn to hang myself in shame.

        6) Black Girls

I dig the black the black girls, 
oh so much more than white girls,
I'm so pleased to learn they were faster,
kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss Ohhh I'm after.
ra-cha-cha-cha ta-ta-ta,
long honkey faggot white boy,
a flub-flub-flub fiz kinda joy.
You can palm her ass so quier and quiet,
while inside I rebel and riot!

I dig the white boys,
oh so much more than black boys,
I was so pleased to learn that they're not smarter!
Come on and give it, give it, give it to me HARDER!
Just say, "HARDER!"   <sax sex>

You know I love the lord of hosts,
father, son, and the holy ghost,
I'm so pleased to learn that he's inside me,
in my time of trouble he will hide me.
I dig the black girls!

        7) Jesus Walking on the Water

Oh my,
What if it was true?
and oh my,
tell is it true?
Did he die upon that cross?
and did he come back across?

Jesus walking on the water,
sweet Jesus walking in the sky!
I can safetly say he took my hand,
and he raised me up,
and he brought me up,
I can hold my head high.

Will I be true to my word?
and will I give what I'm worth?
Oh yes sir, 
I come when you call.
and yes sir,
Jesus borrowed it all.

        8) 36-24-36

I saw a girl walkin' down the street,
just the kinda of girl that I'd like to meet.
It ain't her hair or her clothes or her feet,
it's something much more discrete.
No, I'm not a lair baby, 
I'm not proud,
I just want what I'm not allowed.
I'll move on up and help myself,
and do a world of good for my mental health!
36-24-36...somethings broke and it needs to be fixed.
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm getting bored and I need some kicks,
like 34-24-36.

Man oh man I got a red hot plan,
do you understand?
I cannot fail, it's plain to see,
I'm having fun and making money,
I know this summers gonna be the best,
if I don't die from lack of rest,
experience what my daddy said,
that's what I got just like he said.

Something special about her personality!
36-24-36...I want lots of pretty chicks!

        9) I Held Her in My Arms

I'm gnawing on the knowledge that I haven't burned,
and I'm learning thins that I should have already learned.
Everyone I ever knew was so kind and coy,
I was with a girl,
but it felt like it was with a boy.

And I can't even remember if we were lovers,
or if I just wanted to...
But I held her in my arms...but it wasn't you!
I will not kill the one thing that I love,
in this world of wrekage I loved a book,
I said, "Help me Lord, help me understand,
what it means to be a boy,
what it means to be a man!"

        10) I Hate the TV

I hate the TV!
You know that it's killin' me!
I hate the president!
You know that he's killin' me!

Oh my love do not fear,
Satan's army will never win,
Oh my love I do not smell (?),
bodies will sleep or burn.
It's killin' me!
He's killin' me!

        11) America is

America is...
America is the home of the hypocrit!
American Dream is f-f-full of it!

Look at the Indians,     <-- "Check" instead of "look" next go round.
look at the Blacks,
look at the figures,
look at the facts,
look at the facts,
the facts - not the lies,
and you'll find out a big surprise!
Right between the eyes!

No desperation limit!
Even though my nose don't work I smell trouble!
No desperation limit!
Murder, Murder in the government...
Say you're sorry!
No desperation limit!
Turn the key.
Turn the lock.
Nationalism - you can suck my...
Watch how the worlds progressing,
Everywhere - Agression!

        12) Old Mother Reagan

Old mother Reagan and her crew,
took away from me and you!
She better go far and away!
You know it ain't right,
when it's all wrong,
See old mother Reagan protest on.
Old mother Reagan,
so dumb,
so dangerous.
How come she don't go far and away?
She better go far and away!
Old mother Reagan went to heaven and and at the gate she was stopped.

        13) Dance M.F., Dance!

When I say Dance,
you best dance motherfucker!
Dance, Motherfucker dance!
You're such an ugly motherfucker, dance!

        14) Lies

Well, I was was reading this poem,
and it's so profound,
and I like it's ryhthm,
and I like it's sound.
By a very famous poet,
no critic can critize,
and I pause a moment,
and I start to realize,
he's tellin' lies...

On the motel TV I dig the evangelists.
He'll tell you all about that, 
and then he'll tell you all about this.
He's preaching up a storm,
by the seat of god's elite.
He's mixing up the truth,
with something funny I start to see,
he's tellin' lies...

Well, I never had this problem with anyboy in the government,
I guess I always figured never mean what they meant.
And god help us all not to be so stoned surprised,
when we wake up in the stars,
with the skys in out eyes,
If we keep tellin' lies...

        15) American Music

Do you like American music?
I like American music.
Don't you like American music, baby?

I want you to hold me.
I want your arms around me.
I want you to hold me, baby.

Do you do too many drugs?
I do too many drugs.
Do you do too many drugs too, baby?

You were born too late,
I was born too soon,
but everytime I look at that ugly moon,
it reminds me of you.

I need a date to the prom,
would you like to come along?
Nobody will go to the prom with me, baby.

They didn't like American music.
They never heard American music.
They didn't know that the music was in my soul, baby.

You were born too soon,
I was born too late,
but everytime I look at that ugly lake,
it reminds me of me.

You like American music.
I like American music.
Do you like American music?
We like all kinds of music.
But I like American music...dance, baby.

You were born too late,
I was born too late,
but everytime I look at that ugly lake,
it reminds me of me.

                16) Out the Window

Life was simple,
life was great,
until I made my big mistake.
Oh-no it could never happen to me.
Life was short and life was sweet,
I was thinking as I hit the street.
I could hardly believe,
I could scarcely concieve that I had gone out the window.

She was fine,
she looked great,
so we made our big mistake.
I swear it it never happened to her.
Pavement knocked her head around,
when she hit the solid concrete ground.
Thirty flights above,
and she was thirty-something lovin' and gone out the window.
Oh, catch me when I'm falling...

He was smart,
he was wise,
he profoundly philosophised everthing for human peace.
One day by a window there,
was a note that read, 
"I've gone out the window. I'm dead."
He saved one life for all his life,
but then one day he said,
"No.  I gotta go."
...out the window.

        17) Kiss off

I need someone,
a person to talk to.
Someone who cared to love.
Could it be you?
Situation gets rough then I start to panic.
It's not enough,
it's a habit.
of kissing.
My darling is sick.

You can always kiss off in the end.
Get on my back and them stare.
Then they'll be back,
but I won't mind.
They will be back,
we do it all the time!

I hope you know that this will go down your permanent record!
Oh yeah?
Well, don't get so distressed.
Did I happen to mention the rest?

I take one 'cause you left me,
two for my family,
three for my heartache,
four for my headaches,
five for my loneliness,
six for my sorrow,
seven for tomorrow,
eight -- I forgot what eight was for,
nine for a lost god,
ten -- Everything!

        18) Add it Up

Dance after dance,
I will walk and I will play,
but the day after today,
I will stop and I will start.

Why can't I get just one kiss?
Believe me somethings I wouldn't miss,
but I look at your pant - I need a kiss!
Why can't I get just one slew?
Believe me I know what to do,
but something won't let me make love to you.
Why can't I get just one fuck?
I guess it has something to so with luck!
I'd lay out my life for just one.

Dance after dance,
I can handle it,
I will say, "I saw it."
But I take a call and say goodnight.

Oh my, I know you kept your eye on this thought,
I know you got problems,
you're not the only one.
Your honey sugar left ya',
he left ya' on the run.

Oh my, take a look now and that your boy is gone,
he's walkin' around like he's number one.
He went downtown and got hima gun.
I said, Shoot goddamit.
You know you got my sympathy.
I wanna shoot goddamit.

Your broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs,
cannot make sin with your affairs.
Share a smoke.
Make me choke.
You gotta grasp and reach for a little hope,
I've seen worse than that arise,
words hypnotize,
words make my mouth exercise,
words filled up with magic prize.
Nothing that I say - nothing complies (?).

Oh my mother,
I love to love her.
So he's restless - he's ready to pouce.
There go you in your bed from house to house.
Move you,
decision to make,
things to lose,
things to take.
Guess he's about ready to take it up,
he said, "Wait a minute honey, I wanna add it up!"
                
                19) Johnny

Oh Johnny do you miss your mother?
Do you miss your father?
Oh Johnny do you miss me?

I was so hungry,
I just wanted to attack,
and I was so hungry,
oh, not me no, I never look back.
Oh Johnny sometimes I wonder,
I wonder what it's like to die.

Oh no you see,
I could have been a star,
I could have been a wick(?).
I'll tell ya' something else Johnny,
we could have been sailing along in our ship.

Is this ring that he wore just another thing that he wore?
But there's something special about this ring I just can't ignore.
I saw him keep it,
I don't know what it's for.

Oh Johnny do you miss all the old ladies?
do you miss all of the crazies?
do you miss me?

Oh Johnny there's something else I'd like to know.
Could you tell me Johnny,
could you tell me what it's like to die?
I can't hear you!
