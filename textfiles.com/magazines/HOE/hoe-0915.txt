 p.s. I was sitting with next to this guy at the Crown Royle Casino with
      the Denny's attached to it.  Now, i forget this guys name but I tell
      him how I'm traveling across the country by thumb, and how i got
      trapped in Vegas.  He says, "I'm worth three-million dollars, and
      I've got $600 dollars in in my wallet.  I'm not giving you a cent."
      Then he got up and walked out the door.

 p.s.s. I hit this guy up for change outside of Harrah's casino for some 
        change. He says, "You know what, I lost my wallet yesterday, it
        had six-thousand dollars in it. Now I'm stuck here, if you meet me
        here tomorrow I'll hook you up. Right now I have to stay under the
        stairs in the parking ramp because they wouldn't extend my room 
        because I paid in cash, and it sux, because my socks are all
        sweaty and icky."
