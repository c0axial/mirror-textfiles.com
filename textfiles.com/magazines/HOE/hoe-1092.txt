 -The preamble.-

        I believe that if a man is young, bright, inquisitive, and has a
 good ear/enjoys listening to music, then he probably possesses an aptitude
 for making music from slightly off-kilter ambient sounds:  unordinary
 sounds from unorthodox objects.  He probably also owns at least one article
 of used and disgusting and (likely also highly dangerous) clothing, case in
 point:

 -The sweater.-

        Like the old skinhorse, the sweater had been loved into a loose,
 shabby gray weave.  After being munched by crickets breeding in the
 untouchables-pile at a Goodwill dropoff site then rejected as a stolen
 pillow tossed off a bridge by a homeless man with fleas, the sweater washed
 ashore on Three Mile Island amidst a spill of heavy metals that transformed
 it from pearly-blue to iridescent pink to an even duller gray, duller than
 the night of day, until it got sucked into a sewer drain and spit out again
 in La Jolla, California.

 -The man.-

        "We don't make embryos just to kill them," the mulleted man said,
 his pearly-blue eyes bulging from thyroid sickness unknown.  "We merely
 use the ones ready-made, in vitro clinic rejects on death row.  But we keep
 them alive in nutrient broth.  Call it life extension."

        He shook a test tube, sloshing around some straw-colored liquid --
 one hundred thousand embryos pirouetting together in chicken soup.

        "God.. they'll probably end up tomorrow's vegeterians," I joked, "if
 they ever make it out of the machine."

 -A Rube Goldbergian fantasy.-

        I am a human being for I speak in grammars universal.  My human
 cells hold two memories:  cold, and warm.  And the thawing of my heart,
 the beginning of a love affair with chicken broth.  For I love to eat.  I
 absorb food.  My stomach is one cell.  I think about cells a lot, using my
 budding brain, which is also one cell.  And I love my neighbors!  There is
 no competition for resources.  We will live forever.  We will live forever.

        One day, docking onto the mother ship, I will know blood.  But for
 today, my eyespot is beginning to form.  I am precious, and warm.  In fact,
 I am a perfectly-formed trilaminar entity of beauty.

        & I like to dance. teehee!

 -The amendment.-

        Waltzing and swishing in gentle unison, the embryos experienced up,
 down, and the loop-de-loop through decreasing diameters and increasing
 suction:  a joyous carnival ride to death.  The embryos fled single file
 from the micro-pipette, which pushed and pulled and smeared and crushed
 and jumbled their rudimentary forms into undifferentiated masses of three
 and four and five cells.  As they exited, they screamed bloody murder and
 cried themselves dry.
