	Black dem boots and make dem shine, good boy, and a good boy.
 Number One was a good Number One. When Number One came of age, Number
 One's momma said there'd be days like these.

	There'd be days like these, momma said. Momma said! Momma said!

	And in reply Number One looked up from blacking dem boots and
 making dem shine, and said, "Ohhhh momma... can this REALLY be the END?"

	Shut up, she said. Some things never end.

	"Like history?"

	Maybe... she said.

	But then, she was ugly. Couldn't forget that.

	Number One opened Number One's book to find out.

 ***************************************************************************

 Number One:        Shadows on the wall. Quiet. A cave? Maybe, but there's
                    no fire here. And without fire, the shadows are so
                    dim. So dim...so dim they're shapeless.Yeah, that's
                    right, Plato, you heard me. Shapeless! Shapeless just
                    like you and all the rest of history. I don't trust
                    you, Plato. You see, here's my Great Idea all about it:
                    philosophers innately begin with "p" and "h" and, as I
                    stare at this wall, some dank, dusty phobia - just
                    another irrational ph34r? -- inside me tells me to see
                    past your phat phonetics and to realize that you're all
                    just philandering phonies! So I don't think this will
                    work out. I want you to leave now. Let me rest in
                    peace! R.I.P that's me.

                    The only thing I regret is that "fuck you" isn't "phuck
                    you" because that would have phucking raised my
                    cleverness in the above paragraph by at least 50
                    points, don't you agree?

 Plato:             Despite that annoying monologue, I'm not phased. So
                    you're not impressed with my phlegm... so what? How
                    about just a strictly platonic relationship, then?
                    What do you say, Number One?

 Number One:        Hey! What are you talking about! I'm not Number One!
                    You're horribly mistaken! I'm not Number One. I'm not
                    Number One. Look, watch me put on this scarf. This is
                    Number Two's scarf!

 --PoOf!--
 --PoOf!--

 Number Two:        There. Wait! Plato disappeared in a PoOf just as I
                    appeared in one! Oh well.  All a bunch of shit, anyway.
                    My scarf is pretty. Pretty pretty pretty pretty. Five
                    pretty's make me... Pretty, too!

 --PoOf!--

 Pretty:            Me and you, Number Two. This is love, Number Two, I
                    know it. I was nothing before you.  I saw love in your
                    eyes, and you gave me life. I was nothing before you!
                    Empty! Unwhole! Nothing!

 Number Two:        I know. Me too.

 Pretty:            "Me too?"

 Number Two:        I love you.

 Pretty:            Good. Okay, now, let me tell you a secret: I know why
                    the Greek and Roman gods fell. It had nothing to do
                    with what you think. Nothing ever does!

 Number Two:        Did it have to do with our - I mean my -- I mean your
                    -- pretty scarf?

 Pretty:            Yes! Aphrodite saw me wearing my scarf and died of
                    jealousy. Then Zeus died of grief, and then all of
                    Olympus died with him. It's the truth. See! Look!

 --PoOf!--

 The Truth:         I am the truth! Look at me!

 Number Two:        So _that's_ what the truth is. I know it was in me
                    somewhere.

 The Truth:         Shut up. It wasn't. The truth is... that there is no
                    truth!

 --PoOf!--

Number Two:         Gone in a PoOf! First Plato, then The Truth. What a
                    sad day this is.

 --PoOf!--

 Sad Day:           I agree.

 Pretty:            Think how much sadder it'd be without me! Lalala! I
                    feel Pretty... oh, so Pretty... I feel Pretty and Witty
                    and Gay!

 --PoOf!--

 Gay:               Pretty, you fool! That's not your song! That's Natalie
                    Wood's song, in her brilliant role as a modern Juliet.
                    She was made-up wonderfully to be a beautiful P.R. You
                    could barely tell she was White!

 Witty:             She was a P.R. Juliet? How multi-cultural. Hahahahaha!

 Gay:                Yes. Her make-up was sublime.

 --PoOf!--

 Witty:             Hahahahaha! Of course it was. There's sublime now, in a
                    PoOf, of course! How cliche. And Shakespeare's dust and
                    bones. Hahaha!

 Sublime:           Witty, it wasn't multi-cultural. And it wasn't
                    sublime---

 --PoOf!--

 Number Two:       Oh no! Another one gone! Oh no, oh, oh, no, oh, tears,
                   tears, woe, woe!! Why oh why did Sublime negate himself
                   like that? Why? Oh, Why! Oh, woe! Woe is me!

 --PoOf!--

 Woe:              Woe are we.

 Number Two:       Nothing will ever be Sublime again.

 Witty:            Except the band! Hahahahaha!

 Gay:              I still loved Natalie Wood's make-up. Her role will go
                   down in history.

 Witty:            ...history?

 Number Two:       I thought it was rather stupid, myself.

 --PoOf!--

 Stupid:           My existance is strange. After a PoOf, here I am. But
                   why am I here?

 Witty:            Because Number Two is stupid, of course.

 Stupid:           What? I don't understand!

 Witty:            Just another example of the white man's stupidity...
                   hahaha!

 ***************************************************************************


	Number One was making the corners of the page dirty. Black. Number
 One forgot to wipe all the shoe polish off his hands when he was blacking
 dem boots and making dem shine! Silly Number One!

	But still Number One marched on. Number One read on!

	Yes, after a brief delay, Number One was back. Number One had
 said,"I shall return!" and Number One was faithful to the history-making
 words just like any good history student should be, and Number One
 returned. Number One returned like Arnold Schwartzenegger with a Big Gun
 and a Red-White-And-Blue bandana. So powerful. Strong. Those Nips died
 hard, man! Just like any good enemy should.

	Meanwhile, back in History's other pages, free from shoepolish,
 things were as gray-and-white as ever. Grandmother was sitting on her
 chair on the wooden porch, rocking back and forth. Acres and acres of
 good ol' red-blooded American farm-land (bleeding bleeding all over!
 bleeding all over the sky, seeping into the red sunset, seeping bleeding
 seeping blee--just SCREAMING for a BANDAID but...)

	No. Not in this book. Somethings never end, said momma, and momma
 knew best.

	"A little salt will make that feel much better!" said Granny,
 holding up a box of "Good Ol' Days" salt proudly. She grinned a big,
 toothless grin at the camera.

	And now, at this, Number One really read on. It was a lie before,
 but not anymore.

 ***************************************************************************

 Camera:           Beautiful, just beautiful!

 Witty:            You call that beautiful?! 

 Stupid:           Where did the camera come from? What about the PoOf?
                   There was no PoOf for the camera! I don't understand.

 Camera:           I'm always here, stupid. History has to be recorded,
                   stupid.

 Pretty:           You have to admit, Number Two - it was very pretty.

 Witty:            No, Number Two! Don't listen! It wasn't!

 Number Two:       I don't know what to think. I'm sorry!

 --PoOf!--

 Sorry:            Maybe this will all make sense to us the second time
                   through.

 Stupid:           What?

 Camera:           Shut up already! This is where the mood is set. This is
                   where the mood is set. This where the.. Number Two sees
                   shadows on the wall. Quiet. A cave? No, an  island. The
                   wall, the one with the dim shadows, is... a barrier.
                   Gray. There are moans... shots... screams... blood...
                   seeping everywhere...

 Number Two:       Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
                   I just met a girl named Mariaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
                   And suddenly I've found
                   How wonderful a sound can beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

 Pretty:           I'm not Maria. I'm pretty.

 Number Two:       Don't spoil the song, love. It's my turn to sing. You
                   had yours.

 Sorry:            Sorry.

 Camera:           The Sharks and the Jets were fighting again. Inner-city
                   hoodlums, just dancing around and snapping in rhythm...
                   Number Two was appalled. "I must tell Number One about
                   the sorry state of our nation immediately!" thought
                   Number Two. "But I can't see Number One anywhere, with
                   this scarf on!"

 ***************************************************************************

 	History laughed. History knew. History knew!

 ***************************************************************************

 Stupid:           I ain't never gonna get smarter. I ain't never gonna get
                   smarter!

 Camera:           Against the wall on this island, shadowless, still, a
                   girl said to Number Two quietly, "If my addiction was a
                   person, I'd kill him."

                   Number Two patted her shoulder in sympathy.

                   The girl continued, without acknowledging this sorry
                   excuse for sympathy coming from Number Two, who was
                   just a sorry excuse for a person. History knew. History
                   knew! The girl said, "It's not that I want him to die,
                   but that I don't want him to love."

                   Number Two blinked. "Love? Don't you mean live? It's not
                   that you want him to die, but you don't want him to
                   lIve?"

                   The girl looked up vaguely. "Oh, right, right. I meant
                   live."

 Witty:            What a difference an I makes!

 Number Two:       What a difference I make!

 Woe:              Woe are we.
                   Woe are we!

 Stupid:           Why?

 Witty:            Can't you see? It's right there, stupid!

 Camera:           The Sharks and the Jets were tearing the true love
                   between Pretty and Number Two apart with their hate and
                   rage. The war raged on, spreading like the plague across
                   little islands all over the Pacific. Death was coming.
                   Death was coming!  Pretty and Number Two didn't know
                   what to do.

 Pretty:           I love you I hate you I love you I hate you I want you
                   I love you I hate you I need you I love you I hate you.

 Number Two:        You're indecisive.

 --PoOf!--

 Indecisive:        No, I'm pretty.

 --PoOf!--

 Pretty:           See?

 Number Two:       Yes.

 Camera:           I hope they have sex soon.

 Number Two:       But there's a war going on!

 Camera:           All the more reason to cop-cop-copulate.

 Witty:            Yeah! Hahahaha!

 Gay:              Yes.

 Stupid:           Yes!!

 Sad Day:          Yeah.

 Sorry:            Uh-huh.

 Pretty:           Okay.

 ***************************************************************************

	Granny was dying. Everyone knew it. She smiled her big toothless
 grins and sang and rocked in her chair but she was dying.

	Soon she'd be dead.

	Number One knew the Americans would win but Number One read on,
 anyway. But Number One thought about closing the book eventually...

 ***************************************************************************

 Camera:           So then all the dancers gathered in some strange set and
                   fought. They had knives that glinted silver-white in the
                   starry light of the lovers`eyes. Blood started seeping
                   everywhere.

 Sad Day:          What a sad day this is!

 Woe:              Woe are we.

 Number Two:       I was Number One once.

 Pretty:           I was nothing without you, Number Two.

 Number Two:       Yes, this is love!

 Camera:           People were dying. The battle raged on. The blood seeped
                   into the Pacific, and floated to all the islands blessed
                   by the second Great War to make it into this history
                   book.

 Stupid:           Wait... this is a history book?

 All:              Yes, stupid!

 Camera:           ... Seeping everywhere... seeping seeping seeping...
                   Number Two and Pretty ran around frantically, not
                   knowing what to do, except have sex.

 Stupid:            We're history?

 ***************************************************************************

	Number One began closing the book. Number One hated predictable
 endings.

***************************************************************************

 All:             Yes!

 Stupid:          Then we're DEAD! Dead! Dead! Dead!

 Number Two:      ...but I don't want to die!

 Pretty:          Me neither! I don't want to die!

 Witty:           Me neither! I don't want to die!

 Gay:             Me neither! I don't want to die!

 Sorry:           Me neither! I don't want to die!

 Sad Day:         Me neither! I don't want to die!

 Stupid:          Too late.

 Woe:             Oh, woe are we!

 ***************************************************************************

	Number One closed the book.

	"But momma!" said Number One. "I don't want to die!"

	There'd be days like these, momma said.

	Momma said! Momma said!

	Are those boots black yet? asked momma. Do they shine?

	"Well..." said Number One.

	Black dem boots and make dem shine, good boy, and a good boy...

 ***************************************************************************

 Plato:            Hey! Where'd everyone go?

 Camera:           _I'm_ still here.

 ***************************************************************************

	Number One hated predictable endings, but... like momma said...

	Some things never end.
