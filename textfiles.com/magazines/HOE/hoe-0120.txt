        isps in the midwest area.  tell us about it.

Yumas: isps?

Crash: you know, internet service providers.  don't play dumb with us, 
       yumas!  don't worry, we won't narc on you.  this is for PHRACK.

       you could call it one of my pasttimes.

        have all been snuffed out!  help us, yumas, tell us your secrets!

        the following is a review of the above interview, as done by lord
nikon.  lord nikon, as you may recall, is not from scotland.

        i think it is interesting to note that such an unavowed hacker as
yumas would express such a keen disinterest in hacking.  it is almost as 
thought she really has no interest in hacking, which is astounding.

+-----+

        included here are tips on how to be a better hacker than yumas.
these tips are provided by acid burn.
