	Since I absolutely hate having to deal with bureaucracy for simple
 things like, say, getting my Driver's license renewed, I put it off as
 long as was humanly possible.  I realized one day, November 12th 1999
 more specifically, that my license had expired a day earlier.

	So, naturally, I had little choice left but to figure out when the
 hell I could go get my license renewed.  I figured the DMV would
 naturally close early or something, so I did a quick search for the DMV
 on www.champaign-urbana.com, and discovered the following helpful
 information, directly from some random government web page:

 ANS: Vehicle licenses are available from the Illinois Drivers 
      License Examination Station located at 2401 W. Bradley in Champaign.  
      Their hours are: 
          
     Monday   - Closed
     Tuesday  - 11:00 A.M. - 8:00 P.M.
     Wed-Fri. -  8:00 A.M. - 5:30 P.M.
     Saturday -  8:00 A.M. - 3:00 P.M.

	Now, if the fucking DMV hours alone are not enough to make you
 laugh, maybe this will be.  I went to the DMV at 6 P.M. on Tuesday, and,
 of course, it had been closed for hours.

	I hate the government more than you.
