 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Earlier today, it being the 20th of January, approximatly 4:15
 midwestern time, there was a gigantic net split.  I was there first hand,
 and I experienced many emotions in a period of several minutes.

        There we are, sitting in #dto on efnet, where all your favorite hoe
 writers lounge, and suddenly pirch shuts down.  The first emotion I
 experience is bewilderment, as to why pirch went on the blitz.  Next, I felt
 massive amounts of sorrow, for I tried and tried to get back on, to no
 avail.

        Finally, I connected, and cried out in terror, for there was noone
 in #dto.  Discovering this, I tried to join #teen, where there are _always_
 people.  Theres noone there, and I became very very scared, because I
 realized there had been a _gigantic_ netsplit.  Then, realizing the extent
 of the opportunities, I became increasingly evil by the second, since I
 realized that I had op's in #teen.

        "This is awesome," I mumbled in awe to myself.  I quickly join #unix,
 #linux, and #aol, thinking that I had control of some of the busiest
 channels.

        I felt evil, simply evil. 

        A few minutes later, precisely 4:25, the channels flooded with
 people. Working valiantly, I kick/banned dozens.  But, as is the way of
 things, stupid bots (unlike hooker) deopped me, and I felt hate for those
 bots.

        I jump back to #dto, and babble about how I almost took over IRC.

        Talking to Swisspope, he remarked to me "It was the netsplit heard
 'round the world."

        Yes, it was a day full of emotion, hate, greed, joy, and sadness.
 But, in the end, things returned to normal, and it was alright again.
