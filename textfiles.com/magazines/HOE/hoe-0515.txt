        I read this magzine called "MIXER".  Its a pretty popular music
 magazine in the states.  (Can be found in barnes and nobles and other
 music and book stores).   They had a stupid letter in it from the editor,
 and I decided to reply to it.  I wanted to see if they'd put my letter in
 the magazine, if I wrote something really stupid.  I write stupid real
 well.  Anyway, a few people have been asking to read it, and they were
 too cheap to buy the magazine.  So, here it is.

 November 1998 Issue of  "Mixer"

 NO MORE PORN, PLEASE

        The editor of MIXER has issued a public statement asking that all
 manufacturers of X-rated movies cease sending promo copies to the
 magazine.  "We have more porno movies than we know what to do with," said
 Editor-In-Chief Darren Ressler.  "It's to the point where we fear opening
 up the mail in the morning."  In an allegedly "unrelated" incident, design
 guru Chopper spent a month in England nursing a hand injury.

        Me, being really stupid and having no life decided to write them a
 really stupid reply and see what they would say.  It was published and
 replied to in the January/February Issue.

 January/February 1999 Issue of "Mixer"

 PORN TO BE WILD

        I am writing in response to your editor's public statement of "No
 More Porn, Please."  When I first read it, I was shocked.  I was
 disappointed about the decision.  It hurts me to see people taking the
 porn they receive for granted.  There are many people in the world who
 are starving for porn.  Don't forget about these people!  A little hint
 of advice for Chopper that will save him from further injuries: "ROTATION
 IS THE KEY."  Just keep reminding him of that and everything will be okay.
 Viva Porn!

        Chopper replies:  Thanks for the tip, Harvey, but I have to admit
 I'm more of a props man.  Can I recommend a glass of warm liver, or maybe
 an inflatable doll?  And finally a word of assurance as long as we are
 being sent porn, I'll be damned if it goes to waste.  Here's a picture of
 our latest and greatest offering, the futuristic Depraved Fantasies 6.
 (They put a box shot in the magazine of the Video).
