        Pink Post-it reminder on desk.  Reminder of what I forgot anyway,
 because I can only remember on e thing today.  I can only remember you
 today, and you never showed up today.

        I can't see anything from my backseat with the child-proof
 lock, and headlights blaring.  A world of black and white.  Black and
 white... lights...flashing.  Hurt me.  Cut me.  Bleed me.  For
 everything I see comes in black and white, but blood is gray.  I long
 for gray on this endless highway.

	Yellow paint...cement...black..white...	

        Nothing's much more than a simple shade and vague shape through
 my eyes.  Green.  I don't have perfect vision.

        I don't have perfect anything, but a dream.  A dream which
 was nothing more than me smiling.  I don't know where it came from,
 since I don't know what it's like to really smile.  Smile with a cause.
 Smile for more reason than to keep people from asking you what's wrong.

        Car phone ringing.  Fuel door jammed, and I wasn't able to stop
 the gas perfectly on $5.00.  I owe Mobil two cents, and I bet they'll
 hold it against me forever.

        Rain drops hitting winshield.  Jack Frost can't make snow yet.
 I wonder if he feels inadequate, too.  Trying to make shapes out of
 drops of water isn't working well, and the horrible attempts are
 getting swept away in the blades of the windshield wipers.

        My writing's neatly scribbled in this black and white darkness.
 Filling me and you, and everything that has some kind of void.  Like the
 friend who constantly gives unwanted advice.

	Leave me empty.
