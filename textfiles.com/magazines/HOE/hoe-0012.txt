                -=Hate Edge, 09/07/94, Abigwar [BGR,7oC,NJGH]=-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
        With an unbroken stare, The clear sky is molested by his blood shot 
 eyes.  His heart fills with a little more rage, as he thinks of different 
 people he knew... Hate, that was pure, and unbroken flooded his cloudy mind. 
 Hate Edge* set in almost a week ago and it hadn't resolved itself yet like 
 it usually does.  Something seemed wrong...Almost too wrong.  The unknown
 soldier sat straining his eyes at nothing, as though he couldn't control
 his eyes and focus them back to normal.  The phone rang, it broke the 
 youth's heavy concentration.  It him like a hammer hitting it a peice of
 sheet metal, suspended in air.  Jumping almost a foot back into reality, 
 he stumbled over to the phone.  As he picked it up, the phone almost 
 yelled at him, "Hey, What's up man?  Wanna come and hang out with us 
 today?"  Responding almost systematically, he yelled back, "Why would i 
 go hang out with dirty peice of shit harries and greasers like you? Leave 
 me the fuck alone!"  He slammed down the phone and went back to his window.

        Over the last week or so, He had lost almost all of his friends.  
 And not without his total consent.  The world was bugging him, and people 
 were on his mind.  Only his closest friends where their, because they 
 understand, or so he thought anyway.  They have all seen him like this 
 before, and some of them even experinced it for themselves.  He knew he was 
 one of the best.  A Sussed skin*.  Not a bonehead* like what is being seen 
 all over the world at this very minute.  But yet they still associated him 
 with the evil, false counterparts. 
  
        But on this day, It seemed like all the anger that he had tried to 
 vent, just stayed in him.  Maybe it even came back threefold.  And not just 
 that, but all the hate, aggression, and hostility from last time hate edge 
 hit.  He felt like a candle whose flame was smothered by a blanket of 
 aggro*.  But before he could always just burn the blanket away from the top 
 of him.  Now it seemed like the blanket was nine times as thick. 

        He tried to burn, but his oxygen was just not there.  His love slowy
 melted away to where his friends status used to be.  Friends became enemies, 
 loved ones became friends...and enemies became targets of his mindless 
 vendetta.  A vandetta that he vowed to carry through with no matter what, 
 and no matter when.  He used music as inspiration to heat up the flame, but 
 that just didn't cut it.  He tried to asked people for help, but they didn't 
 understand. 

          Suddenly, ripped from above, with unmentionable power, there was a 
 flash of yellow followed by a smidget of blue and a burst of undescribleable 
 red fire.  The blanket burned away from around his candle.  However, the 
 past not completly burnt blankets added to today's not completely burnt 
 blanket had created a wall around the candle.

        Faced with a decision, he had to fight his way through socitey, or 
 remain the center of hateful, biased and untrue based attention.  So the 
 lone youth thought, and thought until hate edge had him to the point of 
 exploding.  With his mind set to victory, he decided to fight. 

        And to this day, that is where the lone warrior stands.  Fighting 
 for a new day, a new freedom, and a new glory.  With no true Sussed by his 
 side, he kept the faith.  Fighting and struggling, in hopes of being united 
 with his true culture that he was barely ever exposed to, and may never be 
 again unless his victory is clamed and the glory is cashed. "Hate edge 
 hasn't left this time, and it may be to late at this point." he thought to 
 himself.

        Some how, he knows that one day he will find his people, and the 
 numbers of the Sussed fighting by his side will rise. But untill the fateful 
 day comes, he knows that he must keep the faith, and a loner he shall 
 remain.
