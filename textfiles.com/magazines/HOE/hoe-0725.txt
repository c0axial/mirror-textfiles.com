	That was terrible.  I felt almost as though I were the one being
 beaten.  Beaten and abused.  At sixteen.  She's still letting herself be
 beaten at sixteen.  Of course, at this point, she's so used to it that she
 wouldn't even think of resisting.  Why was she beaten?  Oh, her father found
 out about her medical condition (he was quite insenced about the whole
 thing).  Yeah.  It was the endless rambling that took me there.  Her
 rambling can be quite informative.  Two minutes and a tiny wish for
 ignorance.

	She lived in the Bloc for a few years, until they made the glide.  On
 most days, she would have enough time to get sexualized at an early age by
 other kids.  Here, she could only look forward to being raped by a drunken
 man.  Her parents never left her side.  Frequently, she could hear their
 tiny voices.  "Shut up, little girl!"  "You're getting fat.  Let me teach
 you how to throw up."

	They loved to threaten, those folks.  And they did.  With impunity.
 Ah, they could be quite mischevious, those folks.  They did just what they
 felt like doing...  They would smack and bruise her until it seemed their
 hands must be raw.

	She was a disturbed girl (in fact, actively disturbed by her
 parents), and knew little of reality.  The only reality she had was the
 hormone-soaked world of corruption and infidelity projected by her family
 accquaintances.  When she was thirteen, aside from deciding that she must be
 a lesbian, she found a the perfect boyfriend who could taunt and belittle
 her all day long.  Eventually, she realized that she could get all the
 insults she craved by sticking with The Other Russian Girl.  That particular
 ice queen had all the tools necessary to hold her in her pale, greenish
 grip.

	Then, one evening, she met All-American Jewish Boy.  Like her, he was
 in attendance at a party.  She admired his original pickup line and his
 pleasing aesthetics.  He decided, since he was so cool, that he should
 rescue her.  But she was actually in control now.  He would never tell
 anyone who could make a difference about her hell, but he would contract the
 disease.  Incurably, he would ramble.  Just like her.

	She did so many wonderful things with him.  She played organized
 sports, and got naked, and engaged in some intimate activities.  Yes, it was
 certainly different this time.  Not like the last two times she had been
 screwed by an older man.  And she did lots of other fun stuff, too.  She met
 his cool friends, and planned their future, and cheated on him.

	Now, don't be shocked.  Yes, she violated his trust three or four
 times, but one was with a girl.  So it didn't count.  But she would tell
 him.  And he would learn more, but still be optimistic because he was so
 cool.  And besides, for the number of people he could use up and be
 facetious to, he could stand to invest himself in her.  After a while he
 would say, "Now, sweetie, you didn't mean it."

	But maybe she did.  At least she felt it.  And she never let him
 start again.  But she's still around, kickin' it in the USA.

	So, I suppose you understand how much her mother loves her?
