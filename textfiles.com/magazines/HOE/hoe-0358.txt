        i just don't care anymore.  i really don't.

        is the government hiding massive amounts of information from us?
 possibly.

        was john kennedy shot for some strange odd government cover up?
 possibly.

        are there aliens amongst us?
 possibly.

        i just don't care anymore.   do you?  are you really that angry
 at our government for being so goddamn evil?  i used to be.  it doesn't
 matter in the end though, we will all eventually die government or not.

        i used to swear i hated the government.  i used to be worried if
 people were truly free.  

        "yeah man, i can really relate to rage against the machine man.
 i hate the government so much for oppressing us all."  (average angst
 boy.)

        using the government to express some of your anger, is ok.  its
 alright to take a topic and say:  ok, i am mad that the government is
 doing this <action> to <whoever> and i think i will tell people about
 it.  example:  "i don't like how they are making unemployment on the
 poor people."

        thats fine.  i'm with ya!

        however, standing up for all issues that you don't even really
 care about, just to have something to bitch about is becoming redundant.

        are you "that guy?"  are you?  it's ok to be that guy.  we all
 will understand where you are coming from.  hell, we were all probably
 that guy at one point or another.  i was that guy but a year ago.
 "yeah!  socialism, communism, marxism, anarchy!@!@@ grrR!@#"

        believe me, its not good for your psychological state.

        in fact, let me take this chance to bring up another topic:

                                      god.

        uh oh.

        not that subject.

        no jesse!@  stop! repent! before you go to hell!@

        well folks, too late.  lets talk about god.

        do any of you out there believe in god? 
                        "mumblemumbleyeahmumblemumble."

        any atheists in the party tonight?
                        "blargleyeahblarglemumble."

        ok.  so we are all represented.  now, i am sure i am speaking
 to a wide spectrum of people who believe in god.  we got the
 christians, jews, buddhists, hindu, muslims.  we got the native
 americans, tribal africans, really, everyone.

        let me tell you all one thing.  you are all the same religion.

        believers.

        then there are the disbelievers.
        
        who is right?

                "we are man, look at all the proof god exists.  i mean,
                how could we be wrong?"

                "prove to me god exists.  is he composed of atoms?
                does he live next door to you?"

        this fight could go on forever and no one would ever notice
 neither of you are right and both of you are right.

                "what?"  -  everyone.

        god is in your head.  if you believe, great.  that's good for
 you, if you feel the need to believe to make good decisions.  great!
 if good gives you a warm feeling in your tummy, great!

        if you don't need any god to tell you, don't murder, lie, cheat
 steal, etc, great!  if science is all you need, fine!

        i feel great for the both of you!@!#  i really do.  but, if you
 are simply such-and-such religion simply because your parents and
 grandparents were, re-think your priorities.  think about god.  go
 agnostic until you can figure out what the universe is.  i did.  i
 finally decided to go with buddhism.  my decision, and i understand
 where other people are coming from when they say "i don't know."  just
 don't let your parents pressure you into a religion you don't feel
 comfortable with.

        sigh.

        ok.  so i am a little redundant.  i expressed my anger to god in 
 HOE #323, but i was just a little stressed at the time.  sorry.

        i was trying in vain to be witty god, i am sorry, i swear!@

        ow!@  lightning!@

        ack!@
