ACT ONE: AO LI FO ENTERS THE DUNGEONS OF DOOM
Act one, scene one;

Enter Satan; 
Satan: Hahahaa. Soon, I shall rule the world. But first, I must destroy that
       pesky Ao Li-Fo! A curse upon the house of Ao! Ahhh! But what do I say?
       I doth divide my own house. I am a fool for not being so careful!
       Still, this won't affect my future plans for Li Fo! Haaa! Hahaaaa!
       Hahahaha! Hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahaha! hahahahaha-

enter daemon;
daemon: Lord High Satan Sir!
Satan: Shut up you fool! I was in the middle of laughing! [strikes down the
       daemon with a bolt of lightning]. Now, where was i.. Oh yes.. Hahaha!
       Haaaa hahahaha!
enter second daemon;
Satan: Hahaha! Haaaaaaa! [peers at daemon] Haa-haaaaa! [begins to look
       disgusted] Haaaahahahaa! [gives up] Oh bother! I suppose I must
       get back to being evil now... What is it!

second daemon: Lord High Satan! Ao Li-Fo enters the first gate!

-----

Act One, scene two
enter Ao Li-Fo, dog.

Li-Fo: Hey, spuds.. what's that noise?
Spuds: Arf!
Li-fo: Shhh! I think I here some snorting!
enter orc;
orc: Hey you stupid fucking bastard! I want your fucking dog for supper!
Li-Fo: Hey! You can't talk to my dog like that!
Spuds: Awoooo!
Li-Fo: Get 'em, spuds!
[Spuds leaps thirty feet and sinks teeth deep into orc's neck. Orc dies.]
Li-Fo: Clean kill, spuds. Spuds? Oh, spuds! Thou hast died from a rotted orc
       corpse! What now, shall I do in times of trouble? How may I go forth
       alone and kill the monsters and the dungeon denizens save tame and
       peaceful creatures, for though I am neutral I feel a tinge of lawful
       stirring within me! Cao! Cao4 ni3de ma! [cries at the foot of spuds].
Enter Satan;
Satan: I killed your dog, you stupid fool!
Li-Fo: [looking up] Oh no, it's satan!
Satan: Yes, that's right, it's me, i'm the prince of darkness! Hahahaha!
       Haaahaha! Hahahaaaaaahahaha--oof!
[Li-Fo punches Satan in the stomach and runs through a door to the east.]
Li-Fo: Damn, that was close! I've got to find some stairs down before the
       prince of darkness catches me! [jams a spike into the door behind him]
       Ahh! I must run faster. Finally, stairs! [Li-Fo escapes downstairs.]

ACT TWO: AO LI-FO DISCOVERS FORT LUDIOS
Act Two, Scene One;

Enter Ao Li-Fo, gelatinous cube.
Cube: Gurrgle snort bork snort!
Li-Fo: Oh my! It's a giant cube of quivering gelatin!
Cube: [moving towards the sound of Li-Fo] Snarrrrcckkkoink! Snort borglesnort!
Li-Fo: Ahhhhh!
Cube: Gooorglesnorgsnort!
Li-Fo: Hiiiiii yaaaaaaaaaa! [cleaves cube in two] Oh no, what terrible trick
       of the three sisters be this! In impudent haste have I doubled the deep
       dungeon's danger? These carniverous cubes of giant jelly which snortle
       snorgle banal before me are too much to bear, and my Shen Jian seems
       suddenly a copper tinted steel now, is it rusted? Ahh, but no, even
       though it may turn time tamed trust and rust red, it shall unfailingly
       unrust, for it also graciously grants gifts of intrinsic regeneration!
       Yes, rapid regeneration and resistance to Gelatinous cubes! Yes, rapid
       regeneration, resistance to gelatinous cubes, and hunger aversion-
Narrator: Don't push it. You have increased healing, count your lucky stars.
Li-Fo: Who said that? [silence]
Cube 1: Snoooort!
[exit Cube 2]
Li-Fo: Oh my god, it's digesting my foot! [struggles to remove foot from cube]
       Hi-yahh! Hiiii ya! Chop! Slice! [cuts loose from cube] Yuch! eesh!
       [wipes foot on door to get rid of slime] I'm getting out of here!
       [Li-Fo jumps to the side to escape cube and hits a teleportation trap]
       Ahh! What strange and magical place is this! So many golden coins!
       There is a fortune here, but wait, am I trapped inside of this small
       20 by 20 room with an 8 foot high ceiling and stone walls, ceiling and
       floor that seem to be cut from the inside of a single stone? How was
       this place created? What will become of me and my magical coins? Oh
       wait, there seems to be something strange about that pile of coins over
       there... [moves to pile] I wonder wha--[hits a level teleporter]
       My word! [Li-Fo gazes upon fort Ludios] It certainly looks imposing!
       I wonder what it is? I shall climb down this wall and investigate, and
       oh, is that a fountain I spy?

       the days of my youth, yes, my youth, when I was a young lad, burning
       up the dance floor, and the dancers.. Inciting riots, and causing

Satan: You fool, you crazy fool you!
daemon: thank you sir!
Satan: You're welcome.. Oh.. wait, did you feel that?
daemon: Feel what, sir?
Satan: I felt the ground tremble.
daemon: What do you suppose it was, sir?
Satan: I'm not sure, uhmm.. Weren't we just talking about this?
daemon: I don't think so. Well, I don't remember.
Satan: Damn. Damn my forgetful memory, damn it all to hell!
daemon: Permission to speak frankly sir.
Satan: Permission granted.
daemon: Can we have homosexual sex?
Satan: Sure. Let's have homosexual sex right now. [with an expression of
       intense concentration, trying to remember what the tremble in the
       ground ment, Satan drops his pants and begins to slowly ass-fuck the
       daemon] Now what was that tremble supposed to mean... Ohh.. Yum.. Let

       ass sex here?
Li-Fo: You are evil, that is plain. Now I will destroy thee, with my blessed
       Shen Jian!
Satan: [withdrawing penis from the daemon's wet ass] You bastard, fight me
       like a real man, hand to hand!
Li-Fo: [Dropping his sword, and putting up his dukes] Where I come from, we
       talk with these!! [making hands talk] Hey, can't we talk this over?
Satan: You are such a god damn fuc--

God: Oof!
Li-Fo: Heheh, bet you didn't expect that! Now take this! [Li-Fo draws a frying
       pan and hits god over the head. Pan bends over God's head like a cowl
       and a profile of God's head can be seen set in metal. Pan vibrates.]

[God screams in pain!]
[God dissapears!]
[Li-Fo stops hallucinating!]
Li-Fo: Jeez. It was that stupid daemon! [eats daemon corpse] Nope, I don't
