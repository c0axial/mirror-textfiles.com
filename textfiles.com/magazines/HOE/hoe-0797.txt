        On top of a big hill there is a very pretty park with a lot of books.
 Whenever a book is published, a copy of it is sent to this wonderful, huge
 park so that the little animals of the park can constantly be reading new
 literature.  There is also a billboard over top of this fine park which
 reads "THIS WAY TO LEROY" and has an arrow pointing west.

        If you travel west, you find a pretty field full of red and yellow
 flowers who dance and sing all day long.  In the middle of the field is
 Leroy, the wisest of these flowers.  Leroy tells stories about his past.

        one day leroy decided she needed to change her name so she chaned it
 to sadik.  she got it out of a ood book she had read.

        so one day a little aster flower asked her to tell her a story,
 because some mysterious outside force insisted on there being stories
 inside this story.

        so sadik began, "one day when i was a little flower a very long time
 ago, a door-to-door salesman was passing through our village selling a
 tupperware takeoff."

        "The saleman had large pinchers and he wasn't very much of a
 saleman at all.  In fact, he was a terrible and mean beetle that wanted to
 eat me!"  Sadik told very dramatic stories.  "The tupperware contained...
 dead flowers in it!"

        "Oh no!!@" the little aster cried out.  "What did you do, Sadik??"

        "Well, the first thing I needed to do was calm this mean beetle
 down.  So I decided to tell it a story!"

        "i told him the story about a ship that was sinking, sinking fast.
 the captain had said to me 'tell me a story, son', so i told him a story
 about a ship that was sinking, sinking fast. the captain had said to me
 'tell me a story, son' so i told him a story about a ship that was sinking,
 sinking fast. the captain had said to me 'tell me a story, son' so i told
 him a story about a ship that was sinking, sinking fast.  the captain had
 said to me 'tell me a story, son' so i told him a story about a ship that
 was sinking, sinking fast.  the captain had said to me 'tell me a story,
 son' so i told him a story.  by this time the little flower became very
 sleepy and drifted into a deep sleep.  she started to dream.

        first she dremt she was in a strange land and everything was funny
 because when she tried to run she could only move in slow motion like it is
 in dreams and she danced but she could only dance in slow motion and then...

        She fell into a intergalactic vortex, which sent her tumbling
 through space, time, and thouands of generations of people.  She met an old
 wizard there.  He was very chubby but he held his belly with great pride
 and said "ho ho ho" like Santa Claus and he had a special machine that made
 books real and told the little flower about it in great detail.

        The flower had an idea!!@  If she borrowed that machine she could go
 to her special park nearby and use it to make ALL!!!!!! the books real in
 the WHOLE!!! park and she'd be happy with ALL!!L!!!!! the books so she got
 rilly! rilly! excited and said "oh can I please borrow this machine kind
 wizard sir oh pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease?" but the Wizard was not particularly
 friendly and did not want to give his special invention to this young
 little flower.  She needed to figure out a way to convince him to let her
 borrow it!@#

        but then she realized that the other writer was editing things that
 had been written and became cross.  so she flew in the cloud.

        please go to the store for some milk, sarah, and eggs, we need eggs.
 please hurry! before it rains! and wehere your coat! please dear!

        so sarah ran down the road and on her way she met a fox named dot.
 dot was a happy fox. she had just eaten many chikens and had to explain to
 sarah that there was to be no eggs at the market and not to bother to go
 there. he promised that she would have lots of fun where he took her.  so
 they went skiping down the road into the sunset but it was the middle of
 the day which was very silly.
