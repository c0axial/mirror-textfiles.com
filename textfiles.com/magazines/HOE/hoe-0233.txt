 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        there is a yellow balloon.  it lives in the garden.  the garden has
 lots of flowers in it.  the flowers give the balloon allergies.  the balloon
 hates the flowers.  even tho they are very beautiful and nice-smeeling, they
 still give the balloon allergies and it hates them.  everyday the balloon
 goes out into the garden where it lives and rips the allergies-giving
 flowers from their comfy home in the ground.  this made the flowers very mad
 for everyday more of their friends were killed mercilessly.  so the flowers
 started a plot to get revenge on the balloon that reeked havok on them.
 they planned to pop the balloon.  the first flower to try was flowsker.
 flowsker is very strong and an athelete.  one day while the balloon was
 taking a break in the nice warm sun, flowsker walked up to it and flexxed
 his muscles.  the balloon laffed ve4ry hard.  he said, "you think you can
 pop me? just try!"  this made flowsker very mad, because flowsker had a very
 large head. he believed that he could do anything.
