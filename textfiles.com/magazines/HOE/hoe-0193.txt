                                  by -> Aster

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        once apon a time there was a lady with the red hair. her hair was not
 naturally red. she died it. why did she die it? cause her monsters and
 goblins told her too. she liked her red hair. she thought it was cool. she
 never wanted it too change. she never wore hats or scarvs or anything else
 that would cover her red hair. when she went out, to the grocery or
 something ppl stared at her because of her red hair. they thought it was
 weird. she did not. she thought it was cool. but she was not very smart. one
 day she noticed that her red hair was growing out. she started screaming and
 ran around her apartment like a crazy person. the neibores called the ppl
 with funny white coats, the ppl with funny white coats took her to a place
 that was all white and had neat l;ittle rooms. she stayed in a little room.
 she liked it there. she liked it most cause they redied her hair. one day
 the front gate was open and she walked out. while she was in the neat place
 with neat white rooms her hair had been cut short and died red. there were
 not any mirrors there. so she did not know what she looked like. she only
 knew that her hair was red because her monsters and gobins had told her so.
 after she left the neat place with neat white rooms she went to a gas
 station. she had been walking a long way and figured her car needed gas.
 when was in the bathroom in the gas station she looked in ther mirror. as
 soon as she saw hertself she started screaming at her monsters and goblins.
 her hair was not red. it was blue. she did not like the color blue. she
 liked the color red. but her hair was blue. not red. the manager of the gas
 station called the men in funny white coats and they draged her kicking and
 screaming at her monsters and goblins to the neat place with neat little
 white rooms. when she saw that she stoped. she liked it here. she liked it
 alot here. and all of a sudden her favorite color was blue. she didn't like
 her monsters and goblins any more. so they went away. she died cause she
 didn't have them. but her favorite color was still blue. and she still liked
 the neat place with neat little white rooms.  she also liked the men in
 funny white coats.
