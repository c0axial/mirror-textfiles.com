        What the hell is wrong with this world?  More specifically, what
 the hell is wrong with Fox??  Christo and Caroline have been dating for
 five months since they met at work.  Unfortunately, it hasn't all roses.

        Christo is concerned with his eleven year age difference over
 Caroline, he feels she is immature and lacks responsibility.  He is
 also worried by the fact Caroline had cheated on her previous partners.
 Caroline feels Christo lacks sophistication and they lost that "spark".
 She isn't too happy about Christo's array of female friends either.  So
 who can help out this downtrodden couple?  Weekday afternoons on Fox,
 after "Love Connection" (what happened to Chuck?), is a show called
 "Change of Heart".  Simply put, a cross between "Love Connection" and
 "Jerry Springer".

          Hosted by some dual-earringed, yuppie-looking winnie boy, the
 show takes a disenchanted pair and sends them each out on a blind date,
 then brings all four people back for each member of the original couple
 gloat about what a wonderful time they had without the other.  Caroline
 was sent out with David the hunk.  They introduce David and out pops a
 twenty-something tan adonis.  Christo is visibly jealous and Caroline is
 beaming with that *heh heh* grin.  David and Caroline giggle and hold
 hands as they tell yuppie winnie boy about their glorious evening,
 meanwhile Christo is fluctuating between shades of red.  David is an
 artist, specializing in nudes (of course).  Yuppie adds tension to the
 situation by asking if Caroline would pose nude for David, while the
 distraught Christo looks on in horror.  Ah, but revenge is sweet!  It's
 time to bring out Laura, Christo's blind date.  Laura had a great time
 with Christo, she even want's to address Caroline's complaints.  They
 ran into some of Christo's male and female friends and she hit it off
 with them as well.  Christo happily pipes in with how his friends told
 him to ditch Caroline and start dating Laura.

        Time for the lightning round!  Wait, wrong show...but it is time
 for our couple to decide if they want to stay with their current love or
 try it out with their respective dates.  Caroline and Christo both agree
 to give up their five month relationship and cuddle up with someone new.

        This falls into the same category as the people go on Riki or
 Jerry to declare their lesbian love affairs to their current loves.  On
 top of it, the show only promotes rebound relationships, which we all
 know to be the *best* way to start a heathy and solid love.  Why do they
 subject themselves to this kind of embarrassment?  Why can't they stay at
 home and work out your problems or break up repeatable??

        One word: ratings.
