 1987: thrust into the universe from a vagrant pot-holder and a burlap
       rummage sack at 8:09 pacific standard time, reginald sprang from a
       dusty womb and was crowned PRINCE OF ALABASTER.

 1988: malnourished strikes our hero, and a severe case of the gout leaves
       him with a deviated septum and a swollen abdomen (think ethiopia).
       prince reginald visits uncle steve and discovers the game _cookie
       dough_ in grandpa's crotch.

 1989: a peter gabriel song changes the life of reginald while his father
       tragically dies from asbestos mixed with his daily gin and tonic,
       plus his mother gets _the clap_.

 1990: prince reginald acquires his second uterus and begins taking those
       crucial first steps that should be captured with a kodak insta-matik
       camera ("ribbed for her pleasure").  his mother yearns for the day
       when he too will become a real estate agent so as to annoy
       residential home-owners with quaint note pads that offer the local
       community agent's picture at the top left corner.  reginald's
       vocabulary has now surpassed _hooked on phonics_ and is encouraged to
       begin reading some of the literary masterpieces such as _frog & toad_
       and _charlotte's web_.

 1991: denying the wishes of his mother, reginald graduates harvard, but
       does not seek a future with century real estate.  with college behind
       him, he begins to realize that though he is a now an educated
       citizen, he still has yet to achieve the act of taking four whole
       steps in a row.  tragedy strikes--another death in the family,
       magdolin the pantry whore has passed away after visiting aunt flo.

 1992: with a degree in the fine art of drunk choreography, reginald heads
       on over to colma, california ("everyone's favorite necropolis").
       upon visiting "lucky chance casino", he meets someone who knows
       someone who in turn knows some jack-ass that gets him a few
       guest-spots on mtv's ailing _120 minutes_ and then receives a revlon
       commercial with duff.

 1993: he meets eleanor verdum, the love of this life. together they adopt
       a physically-challenged half bonsai half-flippered man-boy from the
       circus.  at once they have a steamy love affair--again tragedy
       strikes.

 1994: eleanor loses her left leg and will never be able to dance in
       another paula abdul video again.  while recuperating she falls for
       emilio estevez, who had previously been having a romantic
       relationship with one of the male teen stars of mighty ducks.
       reginald is heart broken.

 1995: after a run in with the law, he had tried to buy eight hot-dog buns
       instead of ten, he is committed to a mental aviary for flightless
       birds of prey.

 1996: he begins to have reoccurring dreams of magdolin the pantry whore,
       and seeks pre-menstrual consultation from his 7th grade gym teacher,
       ms. staluka.  reginald's mother has yet to speak to him since his
       graduation, but that will not damper his spirits, seeing as he is
       pitching a new sitcom for NBC (keywords never heard before: "fresh,
       witty, 20 something's with a quirky appeal").

 1997: reginald loses his seventh toe in a drunken tirade in a bar.  the
       brawl leads to an intoxicated sailor [for respect for his family
       we'll call him Mackenzie O'Riordan] tearing his shoe off and removing
       his seventh toe only to place it in a bowl of kraft's macaroni and
       cheese.

 1998: reginald loses a pint of blood flossing his teeth one morning and is
       committed to the aviary once again.

 1999: after fully recovering, he heads on over to israel with a gaggle of
       heroin-addicted penguins and the physically-challenged half bonsai
       half-flippered man-boy, to plant trees in memory of his idol,
       TONY DANZA.

 2000: reginald now resides in an affordably quaint suburban neighborhood
       known as meadow view, situated closely to outlet malls with easy
       access to the freeway.  reginald has gas.
