 I've always wanted a cow.

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 What would you do with a cow?

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 If I had a cow with no legs, I would have ground beef.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Oh, I don't know. What do you spose I'd do with a cow in bloody London?

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Why might you have a cow with no legs?

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 Kill it for the meat.  Or you could milk it.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 If I had a cow with no legs...it would be on the ground...so it would be 
 ground beef...cows are beef...and then I could make many hamburgers.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 I had a three legged dog once. However, we didn't grind him for food or 
 anything like that; we just petted him and made him fetch things. Watching 
 him run was quite entertaining.

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 And have alot of steak too.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 Why is it that people are born missing legs but hardly anyone is born with 
 an extra leg?

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 Was your three legged dog m/f?

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 I have a extra legg.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 I wish I had eight legs so I could walk like a spider.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 A missing leg would most likely be caused by degradation of the DNA. It 
 tisn't very common for there to be EXTRA DNA.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 My three legged dog was female. We called her gimpy.  Heh-heh.

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 Well she was three legged dog with a kitty cat.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 Moo.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 If I were a spider, I would cut off six of my legs so I could walk like a 
 human being.

 #5: evil_rose16(#460.572.666.592)
 Oh, no, don't tell me the cows are taking over!  *runs and hides*

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 Everything reminds me of cheese.

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 We ate the cows.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 You know, I never even saw a cow till I was 10.  I grew up in the city.  Not 
 much wildlife.

 #5: evil_rose16(#460.572.666.592)
 *whispers from her corner*  Are the cows gone?

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 What did you do when you saw a cow?

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Oh, I said "Look there's a antler-less moose chomping grass in that gully."

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 Have you ever eaten a cow?

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 The kind man sitting across from me informed me that "No, it twasn't a moose 
 'tall, it 'twas a cow." And then he mumbled something under his breath about 
 dunder-headed kids.  Bloody grown-ups.

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 Can you tell the difference between a cow and a bull?

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Well, course I've eaten them, just never had seen one in person.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Well, I don't exactly go wondrin' the countryside lookin' for cows and the 
 like, but I'd like to think that I can tell the difference between a cow 
 with udders and one without.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 I hate it when you go into a barn, and there are dingleberries on the cow's 
 butts underneath their tails.

 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Oh, yes, spiral, don't you know I have that problem too. Bloody cows, always 
 got them bloody dingleberries.

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 Cows with bloody dingleberries are infected. Their red blood cell count is 
 low. But I think that only happens in England.

 #2: Tweeder(#487.573.497.632)
 Hey.  Are you talking about cows?

 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 No, we're not talking about any cows. That would be rude, and they're not 
 here to defend themselves.

 #3: Hot Guy(#619.676.860.280)
 Do you know what a dingleberries are?
 
 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Oh, great, now spiral tells me all me bloody cows are infected?  Now what am 
 I to do. Ya can't eat fish & chips all your life.
 
 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 Poop.  They are poop.  Shit.  Feces.  Defecation.  Poop.
 
 #4: gilli(#619.613.426.619)
 Spiral, you're killing me with giggles.
 
 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 I like poop so very much.
 
 #2: Tweeder(#487.573.497.632)
 You're a pretty nasty chick.
 
 #1: spiral666(#816.595.748.306)
 I'm a hot babe.
 
 #5: KittySaysHello(#669.358.672.837)
 Tanya likes shit. She has to shovel it all the time.  She adores shit.
 
 #2: Tweeder(#487.573.497.632)
 Is everybody baked in here or something?
