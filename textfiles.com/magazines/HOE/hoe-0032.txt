  My frist mission was the 1-800-Mattres(s) question. If you leave off the
 last S, Will you have to pay more for the mattress? After days of research,
 I gave in, and called to ask them. The first time the lady who was working
 the switch board when I called said:

  Either this lady had a sence of humor, or we are on to something. In hopes
 of getting another opinion, from another operator, I have decided to call 
 again. Please hold... Okay, this was a male operator:

  The data is inconclusive. The theroy is that you do pay more, and the man
 I talked to was actually higher up on the corprate ladder, and knew, while
 the woman was nothing more than a switchboard operator. Remember folks, you
 heard it hear first. If you want to buy a mattress. Leave off the last 'S'
 or you will pay 5% more!

     My second mission was to try and infiltrate the depths of Hooked On
   phonics, and find out, how a person is to dial, if they can't read.
   My first test came back completly negitive, and really back fired. But
   thats okay, That is what redial is for.

   Hmm, This data is pretty inconclusive. Maybe we should try again. This is
  the data to my second call. Unlike above, I am writing this before I
  called, so I don't know if its gonna work out. Hopefully I will get a
  diffrent operator.
   
   Damn it, Here it is...

   Ok, well, the Magic 8-bigwar says (Eight ball thing you shake!), "Duh
  ABCDEFG theroy is that they wan't you to really on some one else to do
  your work."

   Hmm, Sounds like people have been imcriminated because they can't read.
  Just beacause they are handicaped doesn't mean that they need to mooch off
  of other people. Their plot must be to turn the world into a bunch of
  goons who can't read (Beacuse they can't call for help) or a bunch of
  mooches who rely on others to do all their work. Fucking bastards! All
  would call them back to preform another test, but I believe after #2 it
  is considered harrasment, and they record and trace all their calls, so
  I think they could press charges. Next!

   |  |_____________________________/\_______________________________|  |
    \_______________________________/\_________________________________/

   Ok, my final mission of the day, was to discover why when you dial
  1-700-555-4141, it gives you a message that says something like "Thank
  you for calling the AT&T long distance service. This message will *NOT*
  repeat" Then it continues repeating the message for infinity, or till you 
  disconect...Which ever comes first.

   I would call right now and get a transcript of what it says for you... 
  But I am to lazy to do it myself. I am going to rely on you to do it for 
  me. It seems when I was testing the Hooked on Phonix, (Wait, does that 
  mean it is addictive! Hahaha Bonus file tonight!) it succsessfuly changed 
  me into what we had feared.
   
   I have come upon the theroy, that it says it is not repeating because it
  is tricking you to stay on the line longer, by waiting for it to not 
  repeat. While you are waiting, it subliminly programs you. I have not 
  dared to stay on long enough to find out what it will make me into. Oh 
  well. Have phun with it. Amaze your friends. Dazzle your enemys... before 
  you knock them senseless. Peace out yo! (Hahah maybe my little skinheaded 
  ears did listen to it to long!)

     I have to theroys on this one. 1) He was too stoked on Phonix to answer
    me. Or 2) People at HoP have no sence of humor, and should take lessons
    from Dial-A-Mattress [DaM].
