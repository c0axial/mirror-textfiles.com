                                                                      mG
  
  
  
        It was a dreary night, the rain that tinkled down, it seemed endless. 
 A little breeze could be heard whistling through the trees, and close in the 
 nights dark distance, Xavier heard what sounded to be the cry's of a hurt 
 dog. It was quite strange, hearing dogs out side the mayor's house...
 Especially hurt ones, he thought. Then it hit him. Ever since those two 
 times the terrorist had struck, the mayor had her security raised. They 
 must have hired dogs in the past last few days.
  
        Xavier took his gun belt off of the small rack that was designed for 
 keys that said "A hanging key, is not a lost key!" on it. He straped his 
 weapon around his waist and reached for his hat which was also hanging on 
 the suprisingly strong little rack. Opening the guard house door, he stepped 
 into the drizzle, and locked the door behind him.

        After a while of searching through the thick fog and rain 
 combination with his flashlight (whose batteries were dying to make matters
 worse), he managed to find the dog. It was lying in a puddle of mud, but it 
 was no longer squealing, as though it was dead. Xavier checked to see if the
 greasy dog was breathing, and found not only the dog was alive, but there
 was a dart sticking out of the German sheperd's side.

        Like a true hero, Xavier picked up the slippery, large dog and 
 carried it to the nearest guard house where a part time veterinarian was 
 working half shifts as a security guard.

        Little did they know that, as the dog was being rescued, they left a 
 wide open breach in security. Out came a masked man, instantly reconized as 
 being our hero from the last of this mini-series, the Poetic Terrorist. To 
 make this story a little easier for the poor, exhausted author (A-BuG-WaR), 
 to write, We have decided to give the /<h00l dude a name, Tome Jour. 
 Remember it's French so the J is silent.
                                 
        Tome carefully and rather quickly scaled the moss covered slippery 
 wet wall. Once at the top, he twisted in all funny directions to get around 
 the electric barbed wire fence on top of the old wall.

        He darted across the front lawn after jumping off the wall and 
 landing in the mud. He made it to the front of the house, successfuly 
 avoiding the paranoid spotlight opereator's beam.
  
        He took a few cans of acrylic paint out of his black duffle bag. He 
 painted the whole front door with pink paint. Then used a silent blow dryer 
 operating off a battery pack to dry the paint! (Made specificly for 
 terrorists you know) Next he painted a burgendy diagnol stripe down the 
 length of the door. Bright florecent green pokadots finished the 
 masterpeice.
   
         Next he gathered all the paint cans and ran out to the middle of 
 the yard. He set up the paint cans in a circle, with a can of bleach in the 
 middle. Next he took a rather large block of Plastique in the form of a 
 shaped charge pointed upword and outword in a 45 degree angled radias in 
 all directions. He rapidly dug a hole with his collapsable army spade from
 WWII and placed the bomb level to the ground.
  
        He raranged the circle again, but this time around the bomb, on top 
 of the centred bomb he placed the bleach can. He opened the lids with a 
 knife, as fast as he could, and pressed the little red button. A green
 light started to flash, but was repressed by the bleach can.

        All of a sudden as he started to stand up, the spot light came on 
 again...the spoltlight operator must have been done changing shifts. The 
 light moved around the field and then it spotted Tome. Tome ran towards the 
 wall as dogs came running from his right, followed by two men.

        From the left came a poor defenseless wombat which had escaped from 
 the local zoo. The wombat jumped into Tome's duffle bag which he carelessly 
 left wide open. He swung the bag over his shoulder, and made a leep at the 
 wall.
  
        He started to climb, but slipped. He fell to the ground. The wombat 
 made a squeel as it hit the ground next to Tome! The dogs were getting 
 closer. Tome reached for a little black remote control to a remote controled
 car. He pressed the on switch, and a blue light turned on. He pushed the
 lever in the forward direction and covered his head.

        A large explosion echoed through the dense, wet air. Paint was 
 splashed in all directions, forming a tie-dye pattern for about 50 feet in 
 all directions. See the Gif included if you do not get the idea.
 
        The dogs and the guard that were in persuit became stunned temporily. 
 The wombat then squaked and handed Tome Jour a red and black pill, that 
 said "Don't eat me!". Confused, Tome chewed and swollowed the pill. 
 Suddenly, Tome shrunk to about 6 inches tall, and found a hole that he 
 could manage to strugle through. 
   
        Once on the other side of the wall, the wombat handed him another 
 pill, and a white sheet, with a picture of a wombat on it, that said "Do 
 not put me under your tounge, don't save me for later." Tome took the pill
 and placed the white sheet in a plastic bag, and put it into his jacket
 pocket.

        He started the long run home, through the now pouring rain. With his 
 new pet wombat hanging at his side. The next morning, Tome, sat watching the
 12pm News on chanel 59 like usual. A helicopter buzzed around the mansion
 showing pictures of the mayors yard. 
 
        It looked like This:      (see YARD.GiF)

        It was the day after, the police were one step away from catching 
 the "tye-dye vandalist" as the media has named it. Wheather or not they 
 really were on to Tome was another story. The wombat suggested that they 
 were only trying to get him paranoid so he would turn himself in.

        "'I don't have a clue how the vandal got in! I was keeping a watch 
 the whole time. No one ever came through my area last night.'
   
   ...Said Xavier, the watchmen who was on guard near where the artwork was.
      Well, you saw it here first folks, Channel 59 news... Where everything
      is bullshit, and the media tells you lies. Have a nice day..."

        There was another flash of lightning, and the thunder rang out. 
  
"...From the Channel 59 weather forcast station, Its a lovely day. Absolutly
    NO chance of rain."

     Damn media, When will they get something straight. Tome got out the bag
 wommy had given him last night. He pulled out the wombat tabs, and ripped
 them in half. He gave half to the wombat who stuck them under his tounge.
 Tome did the same. After about 45 minutes, Wommie turned to Tome and said,
 "Lets go on a TRIP." 
   
        After dodging the flying blue elephant, Tome decided that they 
 should go to Austrailia, and look for wommy's family. Wommie got all 
 depressed, until a tree fell out side the window, and wommie saw it out of 
 the cornor of his eye. He jumped to his four feet, and ran to the window as 
 fast as his little paws would carry him. "Did ya see that!" he asked 
 excitedly! The trails on the tree said we need to go to Africa. 

        Tome pulled out his wallet and found 3 french fries. Using 
 imagination power, he turned them into 1 1/2 airplane tickets. The half was 
 for a wombat. The airplane company figured that since it is not a human, the 
 ticket should be half price. But since the ticket is half price, it is only 
 half a ticket.

        As they when past the drug dog, he barked alot. Tome said it was 
 just because of wommie, and they let him pass.
