        Most writing that's produced by anyone sucks.  Most of the time,
 it's by accident.  This time, it's not.  In the true spirit of HOE, many
 staff members were asked to write the most terrible (or at least the
 stupidest) text file they could.  Some of it will be parody, some of it
 will pointless, but all of it will be bad.  The staff members that did
 manage write for this issue are (in order of appearance):

        Quarex, Tasha, Paganini, Caitlin, Avenger, Cyn, Isaac, Squinky,

 -> "MY CAT IS AWESOME"
 -> by Quarex

      My cat is SO WEIRD!  Okay, you know how most cats are not weird,
 right?  Well mine IS weird.  He is SO TOTALLY CRAZY.  When we got him
 we thought he was a SHE hehe so we named HIM/HER "Buttercup."  He was
 responding to our abbreviation of "B.C." by the time we picked him up
 and took him to the vet to get checked out.  Well, as luck would have
 it, the vet told us she was a HE!  WEIRD!  So, we thought, naturally,
 Buttercup is a pretty fucking sissy name for a guy cat, so we changed
 it to "Peanut Butter-Cup," or P.B.C. for short, but he still just
 responded to B.C.

      You think that is weird enough, you should hear what we did a few
 years ago!  I was getting to that age where I realized that I was really
 smart, so I decided to give my cat a super-awesome new name.  I was with
 Ryuu, and we got out a dictionary, and decided to pick out a new name by
 picking two random words from "B" and "C."  So, I picked it up, and the
 two words I got - honest to Odin! - were "Baseplate" and "Cavalcade."
 And thus, my cat's name became Baseplate Cavalcade.

      And if you think that is not weird enough, there are a lot of
 weird things he does, too.  When he was younger, this guy named Roy used
 to come hang out with me.  He took my cat and tossed him in the air one
 time, while he was sick, and so he landed on his back.  Ever since then,
 my cat acted kinda weird.  Roy is in jail now, for attempted murder.
 He never really liked me much.

      So my cat acts weird.  He is terrified of people walking around,
 if they are loud.  That is probably because he always used to sit in the
 kitchen and watch my mom make food, but then my mom would always step
 backwards by accident, onto his tail.  He would scream, which was always
 really sad to hear, and then run off and be asd for a long time.

      Also, he knows how to grab doorknobs and turn them to open doors
 sometimes.  He does not always do it, but he has done it a lot before.
 He also only drinks out of faucets, so we have to turn them on for him.

      The very best thing about my cat is that he understands English.  I
 know he does, he just cannot speak it, because his poor little vocal
 cords cannot support english.lib.

      I guess I am out of weird things that my cat does.  But I love him.

 -> "I'm Full of Love"
 -> by Paganini

        There are a lot of women that I don't like.  I do not like
 Natalie Merchant.  She sways her hips too much.  I do not like Alanis
 Morissette, for obvious reasons.  I do not like that blonde woman from
 the movie _An Officer And A Gentlemen_, especially when she is in the
 factory and she yells "you go Paula," as Richard Gear carries Debra
 Winger out of the paper factory and onto her new life.  She's just a
 tramp.  I mean, just look at the way she made the other guy (I think
 his name is Sid) kill himself.  He swallowed a ring at the hotel.  I
 also do not like Deanna Troy from Star Trek.  Call me crazy, but she
 just bothers me.  I don't like Kate Winslet (and also dislike her
 cohort, Leonardo Dicaprio--make him go away).

        I do not like any woman who was popular during the eighties and
 ceases to be popular now--excluding Annie Lenox, whom I can stand, but
 still dislike a little.  I can't stand Kathy Lee Gifford, and perhaps
 that is only because she has made herself to be the only middle aged
 cheerleader on television.  Who names their son Cody anyway?  I would
 name a horse Cody, or I would name a rugged looking man Cody, but I
 would not name my son Cody.  Incidentally, I like Jack Palance.  I have
 a feeling that I would not like Helen of Troy, if she actually existed,
 and I knew her.  I met some girls at Marshall Fields yesterday.  They
 were complaining about how all the small sizes of clothing were too big
 for them, and their anorexically abused bodies.  Yeah, I don't like them
 either.  I don't like Tori Spelling. I don't like Shannon Dohorty. I do
 like Phil Collins because he reminds me of this nice neighbor that I
 used to have that ate Grahame crackers atop his porch with his wife,
 Toni, who later became a model.  I don't like her.  Some girl once sent
 my ex-boyfriend a naked picture of herself.  I didn't like her then but
 I can stand her now.  I don't like any of the female newscasters on the
 local networks here. They are all twitchy and they move their heads too
 much.  I like Tom Brokaw.

 -> "The Day I Shot The President"
 -> by Caitlin

        "You fuckin' cracker, get the hell away from me," I said to the
 girl with the blue eyes, and the long barbie doll, blonde hair.

        "Like, whatever!" she yelled back at me, tossing her hair over
 her shoulder, and making the most awful sneer she could possibly contort
 her face into.

 !!=======!!
	
        I hate white people, yessiry, I do.  They smell like shit, and
 they have funny noses, and funny teeth, and thin, ugly lips, and fat
 heads.  Their women have flat butts, and small breasts, and their men
 stand like they gotta fat cucumber lodged in their asshole.

        Even though my momma was white, it don't matter none, cuz she
 didn't smell, her nose wasn't pointy, she had some full lips, and her
 head wudn't fat.

        I started hatin' white people about the time my momma passed on..
 yeah.. she been in heaven for 'bout 5 years or so.. I was 8 years old..
 and I was playin' on the playground with my best frien' Judy (she was
 white) and this group of boys came up to us and told us to folla them
 behind this big tree that was out there. They held Judy back first and
 started pullin' my hair and callin' me all sorsa bad things... like
 "stupid nigga" an' "slave girl" an' "dirt" an' all sorsa stuff that I
 only seen in movies..

        They let Judy go... and she just ran away hid on one of the
 playground contraptions.. then the boys took turns puttin' their dicks
 in my mouth... I felt dirty and ashamed... but anyway, this where my
 story beginning... the day I shot the president, and then had a lesbian
 orgy with his wife and the Vice President's wife.

                                   *** beginning

        Marchin' along the road I mettan old gypsy woman who had fat
 breasts and a large penis sticking through her open fly.  I took out my
 shotgun and punched her in her fat fucking face.  Then this tree started
 talking to me and i sawed it in half, then I slit my wrists and died.
 It sucked.  Yupp.  mmmm hmm.

 -> "How To Make a Cake in College"
 -> by Cyn

        You will need:

        Several friends, at least one friend with flex dollars, and at
 least one friend in a co-op.  Something to procrastinate and/or
 boredom and/or someone's birthday.  A rilly disgusting dorm kitchen.

  1) Get aforementioned friends together.
  2) Discuss how you are procrastinating/bored/it's someone's birthday.
  3) Decide to make a cake.
  4) Everyone should go to the Decafe.
  5) Who ever has flex dollars should buy cake mix, frosting, and at
     least one of the following:  Cheez-its, coffee, a bagel, popcorn,
     cookies, chocolate chips, candy, gum, ice cream, bread.
  6) You should all walk back to your dorm.
  7) On the way back to the dorms, discover the cake mix requires eggs.
  8) Everyone should go to your friend's co-op to steal eggs.
  9) Everyone should return to the dorm, and go back to the kitchen.
 10) Discuss how disgusting the kitchen is.
 11) Discover that someone has stolen both your cake pan and your
     vegetable oil.
 12) Curse them loudly and creatively.
 13) Run around asking people if they have a cake pan until you find one
     you can borrow.
 14) Find a spoon and a cup.  
 15) Arbitrarily declare the spoon and cup to be roughly half a
     tablespoon and a cup and a half.  Or other random measurements, it
     doesn't rilly matter.
 16) Decide you can borrow vegetable oil from someone who left theirs in
     the kitchen, since someone apparently borrowed your entire bottle of
     vegetable oil.
 17) Ponder what they were doing that required an entire bottle of
     vegetable oil.
 18) Mix all the ingredients together, pretending to use the measurements
     on the box.
 19) Pour half the mix into the cake pan.
 20) Put cake pan in oven.
 21) Find some activity to do in the kitchen while waiting for the cake
     to bake.  Suggestions: Reading, writing letters, knitting, making
     and drinking tea, ridiculing people who aren't there.
 22) Take cake out of oven.  
 23) Check to make sure cake is done.
 24) Put cake back in oven.
 25) Repeat.
 26) Put cake in freezer to cool off so you can frost it.
 27) Put other half of mix in cake pan.
 28) Put cake pan in oven..
 29) Pull cake out of freezer.
 29) Frost top of cake.
 30) Ignore the fact that the frosting is melting.
 31) Repeat steps 22-26 with other half of cake.
 32) Put other half on cake on top of cake and melting frosting.
 33) Frost the entire mess.  Try to put on enough frosting to hide flaws
     in the cake (bumps, lumps and cracks)
 34) Discuss how this is the best cake ever.
 35) Wander around giving people cake.  Assure them that it's better than
     it looks.
 36) Continually discuss the cake for at least a week afterward.  Tell
     people what a great cake it was, and how they missed out.

 -> by Squinky

        Lee Harvey Oswald?  Huh?  That's what they'd fucking want you to 
 believe, those fucking kike media elites, they'd want you to believe
 that a lone gunman, a single marine with a bolt action rifle managed to
 get off three shots in 2.6 seconds, scoring a kill on one target and 
 seriously wounding another?  Yes, they want you to believe, those
 fucking money grubbing assholes, those fucking kikes, they want you to
 believe that one single bullet, the so-called MAGIC BULLET ricocheted
 through the body of JFK and then Governor of Texas over and over again,
 causing 7 wounds.  They want you to believe that some small fries little
 shit would be communist acting alone went up into the book depository
 and deposited himself clearly in the annals of history.

        Well, fuck that.  I'm not a fucking tool like Fletcher Prouty or
 Jim Garrison or Oliver Stone, so I won't give you no fucking stupid 
 conspiracy theories.  I won't tell you it was the CIA or LBJ or any of 
 them, no, I won't.  I'll tell you who really killed JFK.

        the fucking niggers.

        Yeah.  the fucking niggesr jigaboo mother fuckers with their 
 fucking huge lips and afros and white teeth and spear chucking.  yeah, 
 fuckin' niggers, man, fucking ignorant fucking savages straight from
 the jungles singing their OOGABOOGA.

	You know what fucking Chief Justice Warren suppressed from
 enterting the files of his hearing?  The testimony of hundreds of 
 witnesses claiming that a horde of armed niggers could be seen
 everywhere and they all opened fire up on JFK, ripping his honkey head
 open, and then they fucking advanced on Jackie Kennedy and they fucking
 gang banged the shit out of that fucking little slut.  Yeah, they
 stained her fucking pink dress red with blood and white with their
 nigger cum.  I bet they got all hot thinking about that fuckin bitch
 covered in their fucking nigger spooge fucking jigaboo little sperm
 swimming down her alimentary canal and being shit out her fucking ass.
 yeah, except Jackie O wasn't going to do no shitting, ah ha ha, no, not
 voluntarily, because they stuck a bunch of spade cocks up that shit.
 yeah... sad eyed lady of the blowlands..  ahhah aha.  fucking shit.

        Well, who put the fucking savbages up to it?  We all know niggers
 can't fucking think.  We all know they ain't got a fucking brain in their 
 heads, right fellas, so who the fuck put those fuckers up to that shit?

        The fucking Kikes.  Fucking long island harmonica style fucking 
 crimped hair whores screaming out orders at the nigger alliance, fucking 
 telling those fucking niggers to go kill the president.  So they did, 
 following orders like the fucking obidient dogs they were.  Like to train
 me a bunch of white dogs if I could, he he he, but I can't, all Ic an do 
 is tell the truth about the fucking jews and fucking niggers.

        You know what else the jews did?  they fucking made LBJ resign.
 In 1968, there was a secret meeting of hte democrats between LBJ, RFK, 
 Goldwater, and three jews known as XYZ.  And they fucking said, they
 said it right out, "LBJ, WE ARE AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR."

	Now, before you start applauding their oh-so-fashionable protest
 of the oh-so-unjust war, let me tell you something.  LBJ was one of the 
 best presidents we had.  He saw the nigger problem and he saw the gook 
 problem and he said, "LET THOSE FUCKING BASTARDS KILL EACH OTHER TO 
 DEATH." He was trying for racial purity.  and the fucking jews saw that 
 LBJ was killing off their tools, burning them with napalm and ripping 
 them to shreds with AKs, and they said in the secret meeting of the 
 democracts, they fuckign said, "IF LBJ CONTINUES TO RUN, WE WILL STOP 
 FUNDING THE DEMOCRATS", so what the fuck do you know, the next day LBJ
 is announcing he won't seek reelection.  So the nigger population is
 back up, like their overly ripe nigger cocks, wanting to marry white
 girls, wanting to marry my daughters.

        Oh yeah, those jews got their hands in everything.  EVER-Y-THING.
 You think they were all burning and dying in world war II?  Fuck no.
 World War II was the Jewish population In America getting the government
 to go protect their vacation resorts, A.K.A., the DEATH CAMPS.  The
 fucking Nazis they knew that the jews oculdn't fucking use the vacation
 resorts anymore, because they weren't parying taxes on them, so they
 started to invade.  And of course, what do the fucking european jews do?
 They call across the ocean to their kike brothers and say, "Get ol'
 Hymie FDR Rosenthal to fucking invade!  We need our fucking vacation
 resorts back!  WE can't stand for this sort of resistance to our Z.O.G.
 (Zionist Occupational Government)." So the jews go and pay fucking
 Hirohito sixteen million dollars to bomb pearl harbor, giving Toho plans
 and military routines, just to make sure all the carriers are there, and
 then BOOM, america is in Europe, liberating the fucking CLub Med of Zion.
 Those fucking arrognat jew assholes.

        It's all bad.  Anything, man, look at anything, it's all cuzza
 the jews.  ANything.  This shit with Iraq, what's that about?  It's about 
 Israel, the fucking JEWS TAX FREE COUNTRY SUCKING MONEY FROM AMERICA AND 
 ALL THE REST OF THE JEWNITED NATIONS wanted to keep down the 
 Palestinians.  Fucking endless shit, becauise of those fucking jews.

        I don't got much more to say, except kill niggesr and jews.
 fucking assholes.

        i like my hat.  it's from wales.  it's a 100% new wool.  it was
 woven in welsh.  i'm really cool because i have a hat from wales.  i'm
 even cooler because i wear it backwards because it looks kind of funny
 when i put it on the right way.  i wear it with an eddie bauer sweater,
 not because they match, but because they make me feel cool.  yeah. cool.
 i'm really cool because i'm odd because when i meet someone i'll say,
 "like my hat?" and they'll say, "yes," and i'll say, "it's from wales."
 but that's not why i'm cool.  i'm cool because my hat's from wales and
 every time i see that person they'll think i'm creative and cool and
 intellectual because i say, "like my hat?" and they'll go "yeah," and
 i'll be like "it was made in wales."  HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA

        so, if you really want to be cool, get a hat from wales.  just
 don't hope you'll ever be as cool as me, and if i hear that you've been
 using my lines like, "like my hat?" "it's from wales," i'll kill you.
 yeah.  i'm cool.

 -> by Anjee

        This will be a stupid t-file.  Not only will it be stupid, it
 will also be pointless.  Stupid, Pointless and pretty damn retarded.
 All because this is an intentionally bad t-file.  I do not know what it
 will be about, because I haven't had any brainstorms, not that I get any
 very often though.  Has it ever happened to you.. where you feel or have
 to write, but nothing comes, no ideas suddenly pop into your head?  If
 so, too bad; I couldn't care less.  If not, that's great.  Really.

	Perhaps I could write about how much my town sucks, because this
 is an intentionally bad t-file, so it HAS to suck.  Anyhow, my town is
 located roughly around 30 minutes from Montreal, Quebec.  It is mostly
 populated by french stupid-ass retardos.  There is also hardly anything
 that can be remotely interesting to do around here, that's pretty much
 all I can say about my town.  But I suppose that doesn't really matter,
 seeing this is an intentionally bad t-file.

	My creativity can only be stretched so far.  I find it extremely
 hard to TRY to write something stupid, however when I attempt to write
 something that might catch someone's attention, I totally succeed at
 looking like a fucking idiot.  Anyhoodles, the only thing that will
 come out of this intentionally bad t-file is the theory that I'm 'just
 a typical dumb girl' will be proved to be nothing else but right!  Well,
 maybe it is!  Maybe it isn't!  Who knows?  Who cares?  I don't.

        So, I live in a dump, and I'm a typical dumb girl.  That is my
 life.  That is pretty much all that I can deem worthy (not even!) of
 being mentionned in this t-file.  There's only so much I can think of
 writing for an intentionally bad t-file.  This file is (as I stated
 earlier):  Stupid, pointless, and pretty damn retarded.  *VOILA*

        Yeah, my boyfriend went out of town two days ago for an eight
 day vacation to see his family in Moussori.  So what do I do while he
 is away?  Sit, sit, be bored, sit, sit, be bored, and oh did I mention,
 sit on my ass even more?  well thats what I've been doing!  Nothing
 absolutely nothing.  Oh, I take that back, I went to the mall with my
 eleven year old sister yesterday, does that count as pure excitement
 or what?  No, it was boring, your right!  I got to follow her around
 and watch her spend her fat wad of Christmas money when I got stuck
 with all those damn socks like made of wool that have those little
 grippies on the bottom.  I got like eight pairs of those damn things,
 what the hell am I gonna do with those?  (*smacks forehead) oh I forgot
 I wanted those instead of money, stupid me (boyfriend always says,
 sarcasm comes with the territory).  And my most boring day continued.
 So we are at the mall and I run into this guy I used to date and I
 looked at him and thought, cuz I'm too nice to say it to his face, "you
 look awful."  He looked trashed and I then though to myself, did he
 always look this bad?  and what the hell did I ever see in him?  well
 whatever.  so the shopping continued!  blah blah blah and so on. my
 wonderful (and did I mention boring) day.  then I got home and sat some
 more and watched hope floats like a billion time with the phone in my
 hand waiting for him to call at 11pm like he promised.  but did he call,
 hells no he didn't call, not until 12:30 am.  lucky him I was in the
 phone with a friend of mine (and let me tell you that phone conversation
 could probably be a whole 'nother t-file).  I asked him why so late, oh
 time flys when your sitting in a hotel lobby all-day-long.  He said he
 was just as bored as I was, but I begged to differ.  I cried to him
 about how much I miss him and how the sweater of his I have is
 beginning to not smell like him anymore.  but still we talked for an
 hour and he says he would call tonight at 11pm.  So yet to come is
 another day of sitting and being bored, but hey, does that surprise

        Don't you hate the way kwanza has become WAY too commercialized
 in recent years?!  Me too.  You know what I'm talking about:  it's all
 about the kwanza bush and the kwanza stories that are on tv year after
 year -- we've all forgotten the true meaning of kwanza.  That's why I
 decided to try the christmas thing this year.

        As we all know, Santa breaks into our houses on christmas and
 gives us presents... kind of a reverse burglary.  True, it's a little
 unsettling that a strange fat man would do this to us year after
 year... and it's a bit bizarre that we look forward to it but, hey,
 whatever floats you boat.  Sure, we wake up in the morning to that
 bizarre annual sense of being violated -- but, the presents certainly
 are a nice compensation.

        So, I went to the mall to tell Santa what I wanted (the word on
 the street was that he can be found there) but when I went to sit down
 on his lap, Santa just looked at me and said "What are you... some
 kinda pervert!?  Get out of here."  So I said, "No, Santa.  I just want
 to sit on your lap and tell you my deepest desires for christmas."
 That's when he maced me.  Then mall security threw me out.
 
        Come to think of it, it was kinda odd that Santa wasn't dressed
 in his usual red and white garb... he was just in regular street
 clothes (I guess it must be a bitch to be recognized when you're that
 famous)... and it was weird that he had no beard (he must have shaved
 it)... and it was INCREDIBLY weird that he had breasts and looked
 remarkably like a woman (but, hey, whatever floats your boat).  Anyway,
 I hate mall security.

        Hey, isn't it a little weird that SANTA is an anagram for
 SATAN?!@#  Coincidence???  I don't think so.

        hah, a commercial for Hope Floats on pay-per-view just came on.
 That movie sucks.  I think I might order it -- heheh.

 -> "Crayola; The History of"
 -> by The Jester

        there once was a young boy from camelot who smelled a lot like a
 purple crayola crayon.  he was often taunted for smelling like this 
 artificial coloring instrument, but he could not be stopped from trying
 to reach his goal, which was to get the knights of the cirucular table
 to turn pacifist.  he was a hippy bastard.

        "king arthur, we must not continue killing people!  we need to
 find non-violent solutions to our problems!" he screamed.

        "boy, you sure do smell like purple crayola crayon.  who let you
 into camelot anyway?  but maybe you are right.  we sure do chop a lot of
 heads off and whatnot," arthur said.

        and so it came to pass that the knights went from swords to
 plowshares.  camelot became a communist utopia and everything went fine,
 for about three or four days.  and then the ugly ogre children found
 out.  they smelled like teal crayola crayon.

        "arthur kill many brother ogre.  must smash head of arthur!  must 
 smash knights of circular table head!  blarr!!!!" one of the wiser
 ogres belched.

        so an army of eight ogres stormed camelot and they squished all
 the knights before they could plead to the ogres to lead non-violent
 existences, then they squished arthur.  he looked funny.

        they then found the boy who smelled like purple crayola crayon
 and smushed him, too.  they thought he smelled funny.

        "teal crayon must rule earth, arrrrrg!" was the reasoning of the
 wiser ogre.  

        and the eight ogres eventually achieved world domination.

        the end.

        moral:  don't bath in water with more than .014% sulfide content.

        As I walked through the desert of my loneliness, tripping,
 trudging through sands of my fear, and your fear, fear, the fear of
 1000 slaves brought to their knees by masters of dogma and humility...

 what?

        granted the sight of a ghost, maybe, a specter of my own lost
 self. burned by a thousand fires from a thousand torches, burning with
 1000 fires... white flames of morality rising above my soul and burying
 what little it leaves behind of me under one million ashes... black,
 black, black ashes.  i am responsible for all of

        who can save me now?  no one.  but i need no salvation.  my ashes
 are golden.  more golden than the palaces of st. petersburg, even.  i am

 -> "Short People Got No Reason To Live"
 -> by Meenk

        So, I am sitting here, bleeding, in a pool of my own diarrhea
 and urine.  Why?  Because the fucking cops are outside and keep
 assaulting me.  Cops have no respect for a black man.  They tried just
 about everything to get me to come out.  Why dont they just come in and
 kill me?  Because I have a bomb.  A big fucking bomb.  I made it myself.
 They tried tear gas, that is when I told them I had my great big
 fucking bomb.  Now, all is quiet and I guess I will just sit here and
 bleed.  They know I must be getting weak, they have kept me in here for
 almost a week.  I have no food or water, which is why I have been
 drinking my urine and was forced to chew off my stubby little fingers.
 I already ate the body, I am all that's left.  Luckily, I am a midget
 and don't need much to sustain myself.  If I don't get my demands then
 I guess I will be forced to let things go ka-boom.

        It all started when I went to the bank to make a deposit.  The
 teller that helped me was a beautiful blonde, tall, slender, perfect.
 I guess she caught me looking at her tits (where else am I supposed to
 look?  they were right in my face) and called her manager.  He asked me
 to leave and I guess I lost my senses because I kicked him in the shins
 and punched him in the testicles.  Of course security guards came and
 restrained me, and the teller called the police.  The next day, I was in
 the newspaper.  They mentioned assault and sexual harassment, so I lost
 my job as a kindergarten teacher.  All because of some stupid bitch.
 Some stupid tall blonde bitch.

        I decided to retaliate.  I found out she had a daughter, 6 years
 old.  She was about my size.  I followed her around for a little while,
 plotting my revenge when suddenly the little girl wasn't going to
 school anymore, in fact, I didn't see her at all.  I noticed some
 strange guys hanging around the blonde's house.  I figured she had
 noticed my stalking, in spite of the care I took, and called the
 authorities.  I stopped cruising around their neighbourhood.

        One day, I was scanning the pages of the local paper and I saw
 a story about the little girl.  It turned out she was found in a river,
 raped and beaten.  I laughed, but was upset someone else got to her
 first.  I went about my usual daily tasks, the idea of unrealized
 revenge gnawing at my soul.  I knew what I had to do.  That bitch would
 never be able to forget what happened to her poor little girl.  I
 wouldn't let her.

        I went to the morgue and found the little cunt's body.  It was
 kinda soft from being tenderized then tossed in a river.  She smelled a
 lot like I imagined her mother's twat to smell.  I shoved it in a sack
 and tossed it in my trunk.  Being a midget is a lot like being a clown,
 you can do a lot of bad things, but don't get held responsible.  I
 brought her back to my house and laid her out on my bed.  She looked a
 lot like her mother, aside from the grey, maggot-eaten flesh, milky
 eyes, and obvious decay.  Oh, and the melon tits.  This girl was flat as
 can be, though just as arousing without them.  She was just my size. 

        I went into the bathroom and got my giant size petroleum jelly
 so I could lube up what would be moist if she was alive.  I did her
 mouth first, the lubricant's medicinal scent slightly masking the smell
 of decay.  Out came my RAGING HARD cock.  I slipped my ebony rod between
 her cold little lips and tried for the back of her throat.
 Unfortunately, being an african american, I am EXTREMELY well endowed,
 a lot better than most full sized men.  My giant cock snapped her jaw.
 I was disappointed because her mouth was no longer tight.  I started to
 soften up, so I decided I would work my desire back up, then make the
 little girl a woman.

        I kissed her mangled face, along the ligature marks on her neck,
 down her prepubescent chest, around the (knife?) wound in her abdomen,
 all the way to her bald baby pussy.  I kissed it and flicked my tongue
 along the folds of flesh, pressing it into her until I reached the
 barrier I would soon be breaking.  She tasted like the seashore smells,
 fishy, salty, cold.  Well, that and the syphillitic semen of her rapist.
 I slipped one of my stubbly fingers into her, slick with my saliva.  She
 was so tight.  Cold, but tight.  I couldn't take it anymore, so I smeared
 some jelly on my monster shaft and plunged into her.  It was great for a
 while, but her eyes just wouldnt stay open.  I dig looking into a
 chick's eyes while I fuck her.

        I went into the bathroom and got my manicure scissors (have to
 have nice fingernails) and snipped away her pesky eyelids.  Now she was
 staring straight at me.  I decided to have a go at the wound in her side,
 so I lubed it up and plunged in.  It wasn't as tight as her little cunt,
 but it did create interesting sensations.  Her internal organs slipping
 around my love muscle.  she stared at me, her chin thumping against her
 shoulder with each thrust.  I had one hole left to plunder, and it
 proved to be the tightest of the four.  As I ripped open her tiny anal
 pucker I got a little carried away and bit her shoulder, a chunk of her
 flesh coming off into my mouth.  Out of habit I chewed it up and
 swallowed it.  It tasted like a bit of marinated something or other.
 Exotic.  I pulled my cock out of her ass, wiped off the shit with my
 hand, licked my pudgy fingers clean, and put my pants back on.  I went
 and got a big knife and chopped off a post-copulation snack.

        As I sat, nibbling her tender flesh, I decided I would need
 something with which to remember the occasion, and maybe to use to
 torture her bitch mother, so I went and got my video camera.  I took my
 mother's crucafix off the wall and shoved it into the little girl's ass,
 fucking her as hard and fast as I could manage.  It looked good, but not
 video quality.  I went outside and stole one of my neighbour's baby
 rabbits.  The bunny fit into her torn snatch well, and struggled as I
 began to sodomize her with the cross.  It was great on film.

        A few days later, I was sitting on my couch, munching on her
 little toes (they are better than Bon Bons), watching my home movie,
 when there was a knock on the door.  I went to open it, and a few police
 officers claimed to want to ask me some questions.  I invited them
 inside, and covertly locked the door.  I invited them into the
 livingroom, where they stood stupefied by the dish of toes and the
 video on the television.  This gave me the perfect chance to grab my
 shotgun.  I braced myself against a wall and fired on the three men.
 They went down in three explosions of blood and brains.

        And on my floor they remain.  Though I am hungry enough to be
 striping my fingers of flesh, I refuse to eat pig.  I have to pee again,
 and it is going to hurt like a bitch.  The dead can still pass diseases.
 Fucking whore.  I can't live like this.  I have to crawl across the room
 to get to my bomb.  Eeew, brains and skull fragments.  Here it is.

 -> "Bingo the Chimpanzee Interviews Robert Smith and Morrissey"
 -> by Styx
                                   
      As I sauntered quietly into their cave, ducking under a torch above
 the entryway, I was greeted by a butler.  He was surprised to see a
 chimpanzee holding a pen and notebook, and even more surprised to see my
 rented Honda parked outside.  I introduced myself and he started to cry,
 so I moved past and found my way to a dim-lit niche in the wall - home
 of Robert Smith of The Cure, and Morrissey, ex-member of The Smiths and
 now a quite successful solo artiste.  They were both surprised to see a
 chimpanzee holding a pen and notebook, but I was used to it and
 introduced myself.

      BINGO; Hello!  I am bingo the chimpanzee.  Why is your butler
             crying?

      MORRISSEY; He is unhappy.

      ROBERT SMITH; Verily.

      BINGO; How come?

      ROBERT SMITH; ...

      MORRISSEY; Robert tried to eat him.

      BINGO; Alright!  Well, I have some questions, if you don't mind..
             er, why the long faces?  Hehe.

      MORRISSEY; ...

      ROBERT SMITH; ...

      BINGO; Okay!  Robert, did you enjoy being a member of The Smiths?

      ROBERT SMITH; I was never in The Smiths.  It's just my last name.

      BINGO; Oh.  Well, if you were, would you have enjoyed it?

      ROBERT SMITH; No.

      MORRISSEY; If I were in The Cure, I wouldn't enjoy it.

      ROBERT SMITH; Me neither.

      MORRISSEY; But you're in The Cure, Robert.

      ROBERT SMITH; Yes, I am.

      BINGO; Er.. so, Morrissey, you were in The Smiths.  Did you enjoy it?

      MORRISSEY; No.

      BINGO; Who are your biggest influences?

      ROBERT SMITH; I have no influences, for I am all alone.

      MORRISSEY; Me too.

      BINGO; Morrissey, would you explain the meaning of the song "House
             of the International Playcakes"?

      MORRISSEY; That's not what it's called.

      BINGO; Well what's it about?

      MORRISSEY; Bleak trees on a Sunday in January.

      ROBERT SMITH; Beautiful.

      MORRISSEY; I know.

      BINGO; Robert, would you tell me the meaning of "It's Better for
             Erise?"

      ROBERT SMITH; That's not what it's called.

      BINGO; Well what's it about?

      ROBERT SMITH; Well, one time I was angry at the government...

      BINGO; Which government?

      ROBERT SMITH; Uh.  I don't know.  Anyway, I was angry at it and I
                    started to whimper softly, and that's when it came
                    to me.

      BINGO; What came to you?  The lyrics?

      ROBERT SMITH; ...

      MORRISSEY; Beautiful.

      ROBERT SMITH; I know.

 TOM :   Hey baby, I think we should meat in real life.  I'm a hunk of
         burning hot man loving.  I'm also fabulously upscale.

 MEG :   I'm also fabulously upscale, wealthy and really great looking.
         Perhaps we could meat in some romantic way.  I'll wear a tight
         sweater which will allow you to see when my nipples are erect,
         which they undoubtedly will be when I see you in New York in
         the Springtime.

 TOM :   Oh yes, I love New York in the Springtime.  It's times like
         this, and while fucking Parker Posey, that I really am glad
         that I'm a movie star.  I agree that we should meat, perhaps
         we could meat in some fabulously upscale coffee place.

 MEG :   *BEEP* *WHIRR* I AM A ROBOT, AND THEREFORE I FIND YOUR CLICHED 
         COMEONS TO BE IRRESISTABLE.  Oh, wait, I mean, I love upscale
         coffee places.  I will need to dump Greg Kinnear, but he is also
         a robot and therefore it will be easy to de-activate him.  How 
         will I know what you look like, because we have arbitrarily
         decided to not share any personal details, unlike humans when
         they flirt on the Internet.

 TOM :   I will be wearing a nametag that says "YOU'VE GOT MALE" and
         then perhaps we could create some sort of conflict between us
         that accentuates our inevitable copulation.

 MEG :   Okay *BEEP* *whirr* I will see you there, I will put a rose in
         my book, because you know how hard it is for movie stars to
         find dates except over the internet and roses are romantic.

        [ We cut to the couples walking towards the upscale coffee
 place.  As Meg Ryan bounces down the street bobbing her head back and
 forth like a robot pixie, we see a dark shape approach her.  He swings
 a shining silver hammer and Meg Ryan falls to the ground in a heap.
 The camera pans up to her assailant, and we notice that he has a
 nametag that reads "YOU'VE GOT MALE".  The camera pans back down to
 Meg Ryan, as she begins to stand.  Her assailant starts to scream as
 Meg Ryan removes his right leg with her teeth. ]

 it's rather cold at the north pole, and all renditions of his living
 quarters are quite humble and 17th century in nature.  And I can't
 imagine elves provide much body heat.  So his socks must be really
 thick.  Then I wonder the invevitable question, "With socks that thick,
 how does he make it down the chimney?"  Granted, he has magical
 'shrinking' powers, and all, but wool, cotton, and even pollyesther
 have their limits when compacted.  So, I figure he must have normal
 socks.  But flying thru the cold air every year, and living in such a
 harsh enviroment must make his feet rather cold all the time.  He's
 been doing his little thing for centuries now, and I'm sure somewhere
 in the 1800's gangrene must've gotten the better of him.  So he has no
 feet, so they can't be cold.  But what does he walk on then?  Who
 knows?  Can't you just set aside all your logic, and just accept him as
 a myth that is for the children?  What kind of person analyzes such a
 good and harmless character as Santa Claus?  The nerve.

 -> "Doorknob"
 -> by Nybar

        "You don't seem to understand the concept," the psycologist
 said.  "You are just a door knob."  The door knob, in it's usuual
 debonaire way, didn't respond at all.  "Don't do this to me, Joe.  You
 are nothing but a door knob, no matter what you think."

        His friends at first were cracking up by the impetuous door
 knob, and then kind of alarmed.  They thought that maybe if the door
 knob could do what it was doing, maybe just anything was.  Maybe even a
 doorstop.  Maybe... even a black doorstop.  So they had hired their
 friend for the doorknob, to diagnose why it did what it did.

        He asked it again if it had any manufacturing flaws or had
 suffered ill use.  It still refused to answer.  A week later, a
 UFOlogist black kid with a toothy grin who the president had consulted
 on all his public decisions, decided that it suffered from not knowing
 how to read.  He prescribed a "My First Book: Kill Whitey" book, but
 the door knob refused to read or even try to learn to read.  It was
 really driving everyone insane.

        The week after that, everyone in the world came and try to make
 the door knob explain it's sick agenda.  Gay and Lesbian activists try
 to ask it about it's stance on gays in the millitary.  It didn't
 respond.  Feminazis tried to recruit it for their millitant femme
 agenda, but it refused by not answering. And all because it just didn't
 understand it was a door knob like any other.  Finally, after being
 cloned, stolen 5 times, dropped accidentaly and prayed to, it talked.

        It said something about secret irony.

 -> "Poems I Wrote in 8th Grade"
 -> by Quarex

        Since the aim of this issue is to produce as much horrible,
 horrible work as we physically can, I figured I could reach back into
 my past and help out.  Basically, in late 8th grade, I was on the phone
 with Ghort [who you all obviously know], and we were making fun of
 someone we had seen reading poetry.  We both decided that anyone could
 write poetry, which naturally is true, and I decided furthermore that I
 was going to write some poetry which was just as horrible as the work we
 had heard, yet had distinctive properties of me visible.  Well, even
 though these poems are about seven years old, they are still rather
 indicative of what I think about poetry in general, and especially bad
 poetry.

        Or, alternately, you can believe that these were all written by
 my favorite [out of the two I think I have ever liked] poet, Robert
 Herrick.

 Thine eyes like candy
 Thine kisses like Handy Andy
 But that smelly cat of yours
 makes me wish I was the floor
 If only you smelled as bad as that cat
 'Cuz then I could take you and make you a mat
 For you, my dearest, are ugly and grey
 While your little cat is nearly okay
 And forgive me for sounding a little remorse
 but frankly my dear, you can go fuck a horse

 How happy I am
 when you are like them
 And not like others
 because you are my brothers
 I've known you since birth
 you've given me mirth
 you stupid mother fucker
 I'm going to kill you
 Look out for the clown
 Look out for the clown
 He's coming to town
 Look out for the clown

 Your eyes
 like a stream of steam
 or like a pool of gruel
 in any case you're fucked 
 go away

 Your eyes are sweet
 but I just ate them
 I'm sorry my sweet
 but you don't taste good
 For now, my sweet
 let's go out to eat
 And then, my sweet,
 I'll devour your fucking feet
 but then, my sweet,
 we'll paint the town mauve
 and then, my sweet, 
 better run your ass off
 because, my sweet,
 I've become bored of you
 and now, my sweet
 eat flaming hot death

 -> "Hit Girls"
 -> by Styx

 From dropdead@mindspring.com Wed Apr 01 04:13:19 1998
 Newsgroups: alt.women.supremacy
 Subject: Beating women.
 From: dropdead@mindspring.com (Styx)
 Date: Wed, 01 Apr 1998 08:13:19 GMT

        This is not a joke.  Hear me out.

        First allow me to state that I realize that under NO
 circumstances it is okay for anybody to attack anybody, period.

        Second, allow me to state that it is a common thing for human
 beings to attack one another, and often unavoidable, unfortunately.

        From what I have found, this is how it basically goes; when a man
 and a woman attack each other, women usually attack men
 mentally/emotionally while men usually attack women verbally/physically
 (*usually* is the key word, so no shouts of "stereotype," please).

        My problem is this.  Why is it considered unacceptable by society
 for men to hit women while there are no consequences for women attacking
 men mentally?

        Some say that a woman's body is more fragile.  Most are weaker,
 physically, than men.  Parts of their anatomy can be damaged in a
 physical altercation (mammary glands, etc).  Yet, I've yet to hear a
 case of a woman being jailed for kicking a guy in the balls.  Why not?
 She could permanently damage a male's reproductive system doing such a
 thing.

        This is what I believe.  *If* you are in the unfortunate
 situation of a physical altercation and *you* are the one being
 attacked, you can attack back *regardless of the gender of the
 attacker*.  I propose that it is *fine* to hit a woman if she is
 hitting you if you cannot defend yourself in such a way as to avoid
 further physical conflict.

        Anyway, my major point - the whole "men can't hit women" thing
 makes me utterly sick to my stomach and I think it's one of the most
 supreme examples of a double-standard ever forcefed upon our
 touchy-feely PC society.

        If you're a man and you're being hit, hit back.  If it's a
 woman, aim for vital parts.  Teach her a lesson.  Same goes for the
 women.

 -> "Untitled Novel, Circa Seventh Grade, 1990"
 -> by Phairgirl

    --- Chapter One: *Goodbye*

        "But mom..." I complained.
        "We're moving and that's that!" yelled my fucking ignorant mother.
        "Don't you care about..."
        "Get packed!"
        There was no use arguing. My mother was set in her ways about
        moving. But I didn't want to leave my hometown of Farley, Iowa
        for a big city like LA. I'd rather clean pig stalls.
        Let me explain. I'm a farmer's daughter--with a Hollywood name.
 Tamara Jacquellynne Love. Everyone calls me Mara. We're moving to Los
 Angeles, California, because my tight-ass dad got a job there--as an
 architect. I never knew my dad went to college. He's way cool compared
 to my mom, but they're both 1970's rejects.
        I filled my Gucci bag with my essentials--make-up, hair spray,
 my walkman and a few tapes. My good leather suitcases held my clothes
 and other essentials. Well, my mother's idea of essentials--deoderant,
 tampons, Q-Tips. Not near MY standards of essentials--zit cream, razors,
 jewelry, and nail files.
        "Hurry up, you fucking slowpoke! We'll miss our flight!"
        I didn't even have time to call my friends!
        "Forget it--I'll get us the next latest flight--you have 4 hours.
 Move it!" Mom's such a bitch.
        Well at least now I could call everyone. I walked out of my room
 to the hall phone. There was one good thing about moving--I was promised
 my own line.
        No sooner was I out when I heard a booming, "SURPRISE!" There in
 the hallway was a giant banner reading, "Good luck in LA, MTL!" I knew
 that if my friends would've had their way, it'd read, "Bye from the
 Hellhole of America." But having that in the middle of a house where the
 mom read Bible stories to children just wouldn't seem appropriate.
        "Good luck in LA, Mara! Stun those great guys on the beaches with
 your picture-perfect body!" said my best friend, Geneveve, or Viva. She
 really knows how to cheer a person up.
        "Yeah, you look like a California girl! Your hair is blond, your
 eyes are blue and you already have a tan." That was my boyfriend, Ty.
 God, was I going to miss him.
        "God, am I going to miss you!" I cried, then I actually CRIED.
 Me. Miss Independence.
        "Shush, Tamara. You're gonna knock those LA guys off their feet,"
 said Ty. I knew that hurt him to say that. He gave me a peck on the lips.
        There were at least 40 of my closest friends there. All of them
 took time to wish me good luck, to knock the guys dead, and to have fun.
 They'd all miss me; I sensed that.
        "Everyone will have to leave now," said Mom, three hours later.
 "We have to get going. Thanks 4 coming."
        That was the last I saw of my best friend.
        That was the last I saw of my now ex-boyfriend.
        I had no idea what to expect.

    --- Chapter Two: *A New Place*

        "Flight 105, please report to the boarding area. Flight 105."
        "That's us, baby. Let's go!"
        My mother's so fucking gay! No. I was going to stay here in
 Farley in an empty house with no money. Of course, if I had those
 things, I'd rather stay on the farm.
        As we walked out of the airport to board the 747, I was
 overwhelmed. THIS huge hunk of steel FLEW? A feather maybe. But not
 about a million tons of machinery.
        I climbed up and up, knowing I'd never see this stupid town
 again. Why wasn't I eager to get to a cool, famous, luxurious place?
 Did I like hellholes or something? Am I a mental case?
        Once aboard the plane, I found my seat. First class. My parents
 may have no sense of style but at least they know how to fly.
        We didn't have a stewardess. We had a steward. Or whatever you
 call a guy. Oh joy. Especially when it looked like he put on a mud
 masque to help his zits and he left it on.
        "Hello, I'm Jonathan, your flight attendant for the trip. If
 you need anything, I'm your man." Gee. How conceited can you get.
        Anyway, I guess I can admit he was a pretty good flight
 attendant, although he would make a big deal of "regular or
 decaffeinated" coffee. He said it like, "I'm God and you're not!"
        I started to paint my nails. A movie was put on the screen but I
 saw it eons ago. I painted them this awesome shade of red. Perfect. I
 wore this black mini-skirt, a red top with lace, and these great red
 heels.
        "You look like a slut!" my completely unfashion conscious mom
 commented.
        "So?" I could've cared less.
        "You're not going out in public like that!"
        "Wanna bet?"
        "Next you'll tell me, EVERYONE in LA dresses like that."
        "Everyone in LA dresses like that."
        "Not everyone. Not me!"
        "Mom, this isn't gonna be Farley, the armpit of America."
        "You didn't want to move from that armpit, let me remind you."
        "I'm 20!"
        "Then move out!"
        "You're paying for my education!"
        "Then shut up!"
        I did. Only the Mouth of the Midwest could make me be quiet. And
 the thought of going to UCLA! I guess I'm not going to miss Farley. Much.
        The plane landed 4 hours after takeoff. I knew a broader horizon
 was outside waiting for me.
        We went into the airport, got our luggage, and went out to meet
 our car, which had also been flown in. We were moving to 5105 Ocean
 Drive. I prayed that, like the street name, it was by the beach.
        When we pulled up to our house, 30 minutes later I did a double
 take.
        Oh my Lord!
        I proceeded to faint.

    --- Chapter Three: *The Neighborhood*

        After I came to, I started screaming.
        "Don't you like it, dear?" my dad asked.
        What a dumb question.
        "The money... How..."
        "We had savings, dear. Plus my new job will help costs."
        I ran up to the porch of our new house.
        Let me correct myself--mansion.
        It was huge!
        I practically pulled the handle off the door trying to get
 inside. Finally, Mom unlocked it.
        I had a whole floor to myself.
        "You can have the top, dear. That way, you don't have to worry
 about your folks, curfew, or anything. I'll cook and clean if you, in
 turn, bring home nothing lower than a C in school."
        "I can do better--even all B's!"
        "I'll be satisfied with C's. It's already furnished, so we sold
 your bed, dresser, nightstnad, air conditioner, etc, and here's the
 money you made."
        Now I know brass beds are expensive, but...
        "2 thousand dollars?!"
        "All yours."
        I was, basically, in shock.
        "I'll use it to redecorate, refurnish, or just make improvements
 on my floor."
        "Terrific!"
        "We need a stereo--don't you think?" I sighed. A stereo, all the
 CDs a person could want, ooh... I was starting to think I was dreaming.
        I went up to my room.
        Someone should've warned me.
        I walked in--it was so great! My brass bed so well replaced by a
 queen size waterbed! My pink dresser replaced by solid oak! And there,
 on my new nightstand, was a CD player!
        "You guys didn't have to do this."
        "But we wanted you to like California," said good-old Dad. Thank
 God for architecture.
        "I love it here!"
        I looked out the window to face... the Pacific Ocean.
        "Oh..."
        That's all I could say.
        I went to another window. This time, I was face to face (well,
 window to window) with the most gorgeous guy I ever saw in my life. He
 looked a little older than me. Right then, I thought my eyes went
 crossed, cuz I saw 2 of them. I rubbed my eyes and gaped. I guess I
 looked incredibly stupid because they BOTH started to laugh. Twins!
 Meekly, I waved. They waved back, waved good-bye that is, and left.
        "Oh thank you! I love this room!"
        "I knew you'd like it!" said Mom. I guess she wasn't too bad.
        "Let me get acquainted with my new home, ok, and let me unpack,"
 I said to my 'rents.
        They finally left!
        I lept to my window--THEY WERE BACK.
        Then--Lord knows what happened--I started laughing. They opened
 their window. I flipped--but managed to open mine.
        "Hey--who are you!" yelled one GT--Gorgeous Twin--while the
 other smacked him and said, "Be nice!"
        "Mara Love... and you are?"
        "Gunnar Nelson."
        "Matthew Nelson."
        "How am I supposed to tell you guys apart!" I shrieked in
 surprise.
        The GT's gave me this look like, "We're not IDENTICAL."
        "EZ," yelled Gunnar--I think. Yeah, it was Gunnar. He was the one
 standing on the left--my left, that is. "My hair's longer in the front.
 Matt's got bangs."
        I was right--it was Gunnar.
        I finally figured out who was talking when Matt started. "The
 longer you know us, the more you notice. Where'd you move from?"
        "Some miniscule town in Iowa," I responded truthfully.
        "Farmer's daughter," I heard Matt murmur to Gunnar.
        "Not everyone from Iowa is a farmer! But, I am a farmer's
 daughter. He's going into architecture."
        Now, I don't have the world's greatest eyes (as you saw by my
 double trouble gorgeous guy) but I swear I saw Matt roll his eyes.
        And Gunnar lick his lips.
        "Are you guys unpacked yet enough for us to come over?" asked Matt.
        Maybe he HADN'T rolled his eyes.
        "I don't know about my parents, but I am, and the floor is like,
 my private apartment. No curfews. Finally!"
        "Cool. How old ARE you?" asked Gunnar. Another smack from Matt.
        "I'm 20. Going to UCLA after the summer's over."
        "That's great, you're getting an education. We're in the music
 business," said Matthew. I could easily imagine him at UCLA. He
 definitely had brains. I could live with that. Definitely.
        "Yeah, we're gonna be as big as our dad was," smiled Gunnar. All
 the sudden, it hit me. Nelson. These guys were Rick Nelson's sons!
 Celebrities in my own backyard!
        "Album's gonna be out next week," commented Matthew.
        "First single and video in 2 weeks," said Gunnar. They had ESP or
 something with each other.
        "I guess then I won't have you all to myselves, with fans hanging
 around." Oops. Now they KNEW I liked them.
        But Gunnar came right back. "It'll be great, but I'd like to have
 some private time." Evidently, Matt thought PRIVATE TIME WITH ME cuz he
 smacked Gunnar again.
        Whoh.
        "When'll you be don? I'd like to... see the house," said Gunnar.
 He must've chosen his words carefully so Matt wouldn't smack him.
        "Tomorrow, probably."
        "We'll call you. What's your number?" Gunnar ducked just in time.
 Matt hit the window pane, and Gunnar laughed.
        After a minute or two, I yelled, "555-6943."
        "Gotcha, babe!" Gunnar ran, Matt chased him, and this cute white
 Lab stuck its head out the window.
        "Graceface-no!" said Gunnar in this voice I never thought could
 come from someone like him. The pup obediently got down.
        "That was Grace, our four year old Labrador. We also have Max,
 a one year old Lab. Grace's puppy," explained Matt.
        "They're adorable!" I said. My mom called for supper. "I gotta
 go. Free food. See ya round!" I yelled.
        "Bye!" said Matt.
        Then a faint "Bye" from a hiding Gunnar.
