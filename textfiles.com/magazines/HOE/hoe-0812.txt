        Now, who's to say you dont get it?  I mean, you've done just like you
 were told a million times over.  You listened you nodded, you shook your
 head.

        Don't they see it though?  You don't care.  Mind over matter, and you
 have your mind made up.  Ok so maybe this isn't the best instance for those
 true feelings to show through--yelling, "fuck you!" and "get a life!",
 really isnt going to get you far.  As a last resort, I'd say use it if you
 have to, sparingly.  It loses it's effect when we do it too much, they could
 catch on.  Maybe they're out of their generation, maybe they're just out of
 their mind?  but, why the hell should that effect you?

        ~ A free spirit ~  In the words of my uncle, Uncle Albert, "Free
 spirits have often encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds"
 Don't you see, life is a test of true character, about fiding yourself in
 the heap of fact and fiction, a heap of shit!  Tell the invaders and their
 ideas to shove it, you have your own.  This isnt some utopia, you arent some
 little droid, be yourself damnit.

        They say we do it for attention?  Well, who's staring?  I'm not
 looking at you, so why are you looking at me?  I'm not a freak, I'm not your
 toy, back off!

        They pump these ideas into us, feeding us.  I'm warning you, if you
 listen, you'll end up nothing more than some wasted out megalomaniac sitting
 in an office thinking you'll become something.. "someday".  yeah right! 

        ok back to the timeless latin phrase--carpe diem--"sieze the day" you
 only get to be yourself once, and that's in this lifetime, so why be what
 they want you to be?  be yourself!  It would be so nice if we could just
 split the world down the middle, free thinkers on one side, droids on the
 other.

        I'm telling you'd, we'd have the best of both worlds... uniformity
 sucks!
