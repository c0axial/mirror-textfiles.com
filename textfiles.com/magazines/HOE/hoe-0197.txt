        bob and suzy are monsters and goblins. bob is not a monsters or a
 monster or a goblins or a goblin. suzy is not a monsters or a monster or a
 goblins or a goblin. they are monsters and goblins. monsters and goblins
 come from the land of monsters and goblins. monsters and goblins live very
 long be our standards. bob and suzy are 134. but in their years they are
 only 3. they are very wise. they know everything. they will allways know
 everything. all monsters and goblins know everything. only silly people can
 see them. they only let silly people see them because-well, beacuase- well,
 they won't tell me why, but they only let silly people see them. they say
 that silly people are speacial. some monsters and goblins, like bob and suzy
 live with silly humans. but they will move out if the human ever loses their
 silliness. bob and suzy say silliness is a good thing. that is why monsters
 and goblins like silliness. because it is good. they won't tell me any more
 than that. they say I do not need to know. young monsters and goblins, like
 bob and suzy, like to be read to. so I read to bob and suzy all the time.
 they come to schoool with me too. but they don't come in the car with me.
 they float there. all monsters and goblins can float. bob and suzy once told
 me that if I became silly enough, I too could float, but I do not know if
 they were telling the truth. bob and suzys bed time is about 7 o'clock. they
 do a lot for me. they do alot of my thinking. they say they should do this
 because if I think too much I will lose my silliness. they do njot want me
 to lose my silliness because they like me. they like me because I am silly.
 they hope I will never become unsilly. I hope so too. bob and suzy are very
 wise, they help me out alot. most monsters and goblins are, and do. I can't
 go to the land of monsters and goblins because I am not silly enough yet.
 but they say that one day, when I become sillier I will be able to go with
 them to the land of monsters and goblins. I would like that. bob and suzy
 want me to meet their brothers and sisters someday. bob and suzy look like
 scribles. well not like scribles, but kind of. it is very hard to explain
 what monsters and goblins look like. so I won't try. bob and suzy say the
 land of monsters and goblins is very beautifull. bob and suzy are my
 friends.
