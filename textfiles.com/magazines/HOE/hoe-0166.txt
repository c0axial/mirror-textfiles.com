        I've made some important discoveries over the course of my winter
 break.  Discoveries about the world, you might say.  And while none are
 particularly revolutionary, they were nothing less than brilliant when I
 realized them.  Some of my discoveries: professional wrestling is the best
 thing on T.V., cheerleaders are stupid (not just in that "what's the point
 in having them" sense, but literally stupid), and that there is nothing
 worse than the feeling of getting up out of your nice warm bed to use the
 bathroom, only to find that the seat is cold, and there is no toilet paper,
 probably seem stupid and unimportant (though really they're quite
 remarkable).  However, I did make one discovery that should be pretty damn
 important to everyone.  I realized why there is so much holiday violence:
 the spirit of giving and the popularity of driving.

        It is my firm belief that the idea of giving presents at Christmas
 time was first conceptualized by Satan, to reach its full effect in late
 20th and early 21st centuries, just before the apocalypse.  See, this is how
 it works in our modern era:  One day, usually about 3 days before Christmas,
 we realize that other people are going to give us stuff, and therefore
 expect stuff in return: the spirit of giving! So, we go rushing, madly, to
 our vehicles to get them whatever shit stores can mark up to 560% over the
 original cost.  Therein begins the violence of the holiday season.

        I consider myself to be a non-violent person, perhaps even to an
 extreme absurd, but yesterday, had I an AK47, I would have taken out every
 person driving in east Atlanta.  I really believe that Satan magically
 generates a few billion extra people to crowd up the roadways the week
 before Christmas, in order to piss everyone off, and encourage drivers,
 shoppers, and sales clerks to kick the shit out of each other.  If one more
 motherfucker cuts me off, takes my fucking parking space, or honks his
 goddamn horn, I'll give a new meaning to the spirit of giving.  Come here,
 motherfucker, and I'll give you a hole in the head.

        And then, thoroughly pissed off by dumbasses who can't drive (mostly
 the stupid old blue-haired ladies who should have gotten their licenses
 taken away 20 years ago), like the dumb bitch who came, perpendicular,
 across 4 lanes of traffic and proceeded to try and squeeze in under the
 light just in front of me.  Uh..no, bitch...  *Then* I have to go into the
 mall!  And everything costs a shitload, and it turns out I can either buy a
 present for one person, or go back home and get out the Crayolas and
 construction paper.  But I've already driven all the way out here, there's
 no way I'd go home.  I've got a mission.

        Some people are lucky.  For example, some man at Wal-mart yesterday,
 realizing he couldn't afford presents, noticed the Wells Fargo Truck parked
 outside.  How convenient!  How lucky!  So he just pulled a gun on the driver
 and held up the money truck.  Then shot the passengers in the cars all
 around.  Holiday violence, all in the name of giving.

        It's brilliant, really, on Satan's part.  I mean, come up with a
 holiday that's supposed to be about God and Jesus, and instead turn it into
 a bloodfest, filled with hate and anger.  I'm leaving in a moment to finish
 the last of my shopping, and if it's anything like yesterday, I'll shoot my
 own mother if she cuts me off.  Bitch.
