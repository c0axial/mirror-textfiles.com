        Several months ago, I was returning home from a night out with
 friends.  It must've been 4 or 5am and I was coming to a stop at a traffic
 light.

        Suddenly, a man runs to my car from the side of the road.  My
 thoughts are that he's been in an accident and needs help.  At least, that's
 the impression that I got in the manner that he was running.

        I lower the window on the far side of the car, where he is.

        "Thanks for stopping."

        I guess that the red light behind him didn't mean much.  He goes on
 to tell me that his is trying to get home after a whole night of bar
 hopping.  His friends dumped him off and left him to get home on his own.

        I chose to play that part of the good samaritan and offer him a ride
 home.  It's only a couple of miles down the road and isn't far from home to
 be out of the way.

        This guy stank of alcohol.  This is a testament to his alcohol
 consumption, because, I've never been able to detect the smell of this stuff
 on people before.  He begins to tell me his story again.  In fact, he
 repeats it several times.  Adding small fractions to it each time.

        First, it's about his night drinking with his friends and them
 dumping his off.  The next cycle adds that he has been trying to get home
 for a while.

        This continues with the additions of his desire to get laid.  If he
 knows if there is anyone that I know that he could help him.  This is where
 he adds the part where he tells me that he's "done things that he's not
 proud of".

        Oh, yeah.  This has become a fun ride.  With the thought that maybe
 he'd just kill me or something, an idea that I was prepared for when I left
 him in my car, I was not ready for his next continued admission.

        "Yeah, I've sucked a guy's dick." He's still not proud of it and he
 reinforces it with the "I'm not gay" line.  Could've fooled me.  As per the
 established routine of adding on to his last comment, he finally comes to
 suggest that he could "play my flute" if I wanted.

        Unfortunately for him, I have to refuse his suggestion and he loses
 a couple of blocks as I tell him that I really have to get home.  I offer
 a location for him that is closer to his home than to mine and try to dump
 him.  But, he won't leave and it takes a minutes or two for him to let go of
 the door.  I take off leaving him behind.

        I arrive at home and go to sleep.  The next day much mirth is had at
 work about my little voyage, but I'm still pissed about it still.

        In an attempt to be a little more kind to people, all I got was a
 lesson in distrust to add to what I already felt about most people.  Like
 I needed more of that.
