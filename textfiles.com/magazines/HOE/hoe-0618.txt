        N'sync fans are swarming over the earth.  Scientists predict that
 by the year 2000 75% of the population will love N'sync.  The other 25%
 will have gone into hiding by then.  HOE really needs to start a
 revolution.  We must help those poor little teeny-boppers.  They are
 ruining themselves, and poisoning our minds.  For the love of all that is
 holy, I live in utah! There is no escape from those crappy boy groups.  I
 can no longer listen to the radio safely.  Please, join my crusade, invade
 their chatrooms, message boards and convert them.  Offer them my 12 step
 program:

        1.  Throw away all magazines containing the afore mentioned boy
            groups.

        2.  Redecorate your room, chances are it's plastered with their
            posters.

        3.  Discard any clothing bearing their trademarks or pictures.

        4.  Withdraw your membership from their fan-clubs.

        5.  Record over any tapes containing their appearances, interviews,
            etc.

        6.  Your halfway there, just don't tape anything else, or buy
            anything containing the dreaded boy groups.

        7.  When they come on the radio or tv, turn the channel.  If you
            live in Utah and there is no escape, turn the radio/tv OFF.

        8.  If you live with a fellow fan, who does not want to be
            rehabilitated, move out immediately.

        9.  You will experience a withdrawal, when you start to experience
            shakes, chills, headaches, and panic,  you are in withdrawal.
            Head off to the wilderness with a bottle of Mad Dog, and payote,
            so you can be cleansed spiritually of all the demons.  And so
            you are too intoxicated to experience anything but a hangover.

       10.  Listen to 12 hours of music.  And no, N'sync does not qualify
            to be called music.  Some good choices are:  Shawn Mullins,
            Beth Orton, Lauren Hill, Wyclef Jean, Busta Rhymes, Garbage,
            Sheryl Crowe, Fiona Apple, and Korn.  Listen until you no longer
            feel the need to abuse your ears with N'Sync.

       11.  Help others.  Don't be aggressive, yet, that is step 12.
            Kindly point out other sounds to listen to.  Change their cd's
            often with the approved of music.  Change radio stations
            often.  Be kind, but firm.   Your friends are in a delicate
            condition but, THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE!

       12.  Join the crusade.  Invade chatrooms, get into arguments,
            debates, be aggressive.  E-mail this message to everyone you
            know.  You are recovered, but if a relapse should happen follow
            #9, and this time take the good music with you, 2 bottles of
            Mad Dog, and stay for 2 weeks.

        Thank you very much.  This fine list was written by Kyra Walton,
 who is now in professional therapy because of the inescapable N'Sync.
 "I tried to block it out, but then they started playing N'Sync over the PA
 system at school, and I didn't have anywhere to go."  Kyra has always
 despised boy groups, and is progressing in a lifelong crusade against the
 evil messages they spread.
