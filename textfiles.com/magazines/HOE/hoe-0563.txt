        You know, there are things in life that aren't real, that are real,
 and things that are real that think they aren't, and aren't but think they
 are.  For example, take this once frivolous, but now serious concept into
 min, suck on it for a while, then reject it, like a new one celled organism
 released into the blood stream.

        U.F.O's, Aliens, Area 51, and BULLSHIT!!

        ok, do you see where this is going?  All 4 of these things match,
 the real/not real senarios.

        U.F.O.'s:  Unidentified Flying Object.  If you were to see a
 blinking light flying high above you up in the sky and not see the metal
 wings/propellers/or hear a noise from it, it's a ufo.  However, it does not
 mean that it is a visiting spacecraft from another planet, in feact, even
 if it were to suddenly "disapear" that would mean it's either, gone behind
 some clouds up in the upper atmosphere, or, now, don't run away, a
 satelite!!!  OH WOW!!  Do you know how many fucking sattelites are up in
 the earths orbit right now?  Well, I don't, but I know it's alot, and that
 you can see them.... (Real = U.F.O.)

        Aliens:  Now, I'm not talking refugees migrating from kosovo,
 (though, it is pretty shitty).  I'm talking about other worldy beings
 visiting our planet... NO CHANCE!!!!  If you would like to see the
 statistics for an actual... well, just look it up in one of my favorite
 books, (I know you know how to read, other words you wouldn't be looking
 at this right now) "Cosmos" by Carl Sagan.  (Aliens on Earth = Not Real.)

        Area 51:  NOT THE VIDEO GAME!!  There is an actual place, out in the
 desert somewhere called Area 51, however, it is for, well, I'm not sure,
 we've all heard rumors, but, the government keeps denying that it's around,
 or, that weapons testing is going on, or whatever RUMOR happens to pop up
 there, the government would like us to think that it wasn't there, but it
 is.  (hey, for fun, start your own innovative rumor bout Area 51, back it
 up with some type of government money being spent on the unknowns, and
 write a book about it, neat huh?).  (Area 51 = Real, Wanted to be "not
 real".)

        BULLSHIT:  Def. #1 -- Waste material excreted from the anal cavaity
                   of a bull.

                   Def. #2 -- A statement or sentence/comment/etc that has
                   been given, or heard, that is not true.  i.e. -- "I wuz
                   abduct'd by som' o 'dem aliens and they did som' awfly
                   pervers' things t' me.", Billy-Joe-Bob from the trailer
                   court.  (Not REal, but pretends to be.)

        Now, you have either thought about or have been thinking, "Well,
 what about Roswel, New Mexico?"

        My Answer is this:  Think about it.  You're from a really small
 town, the population is dying, money is going out of the town, and the
 people are unhappy.  Oh look, one of the governments toys broke and landed
 near our town.  Wow, look at all that activity, and wow, look at those
 pretty lights.  Hmmmm... "I saw some flashing lights", "I saw some strange
 looking writing", "Oh yeah, well I saw a creature walk out"..."blah blaj
 blah".  Tourism in Roswell is HUGE!  Money is flowing in, and the place is
 now extremely famous throughout the world.  And look at all the money
 they're making, not only the people there, but all the company's that
 would like to make money off stupid people.  i.e. alien posters, clothes,
 lighters, stuffed animals, toys, cartoons... etc, etc.

        In closing, I would like to say... GROW UP!!!  You're not special,
 aliens don't happen, and your mother was a goat, what are you gonna do
 about it, huh?
