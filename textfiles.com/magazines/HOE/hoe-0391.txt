        Where's the pooty-tat?  Where's the pooty-tat?  Where's the
 pooty-tat?  I taught I taw a pooty-tat.  Oh, it's inside my phone.
 C'mere, phone.  You're a good phone, you've never done me wrong.  For
 as long as I've had you, which has only been so long, you've been good
 to me and haven't let me down.  The phone company pours electricity
 through the phone lines.  If I put you underwater in a big bathtub and
 you were next to my head, would I get electrocuted?  I love, love, love
 you, phone!  I love you.

        I love other things;  I love the stars at night and I love
 sticking my tongue to tasty things and I like to beat you, phone, beat
 you into metal walls.  

        We used to have more metal walls around here, me and Metra, but
 see, they were lead-based, and when we gave birth to you we were afraid
 you might lick them and get sick.  After all, we coated them with rabbit
 feces.  I like to return books to the library because I feel like I have
 a purpose.  When I return them on time, I feel like a good kid, and I
 know the librarians respect me.  Think of how many important books may
 have been lost from important libraries because some dingbat checked
 them out and never returned them.  There shouldn't be a swinging door
 for those sorts of people.  It should just go one way.  A one-way road
 into a room full of punishment, where all they can do is lick things all
 day.  They can lick themselves until their skin goes raw or they can lick
 the walls and get sick of lead poisoning, like mom -- good 'ol mom,
 baking her iron-supplemented chocolate cookies.  My friends would always
 have christmas cookies with fake sugar-coated metallic balls on them.
 Their moms made them.  Well, my lovely mother (I love the woman!) she put
 real ball bearings on them thinking that we could eat them all and we all
 got sick and shit out ball bearings.  When I get bad intestinal gas, I
 can bend over and my ass is like a Daisy BB gun.  Look out Martha Stewart.

        I could cook culinary delights for french stalwarts of Egyptian
 theatre.  The tops of the pyramids are not comfortable to sit on, for
 members of either sex.  Sure, the pointy top of the pyramids have all
 worn away over the years, but still, you're awfully high up and it is an
 uncomfortable climb and I used to be buried in one of those pyramid
 things but then I got out because the light shone on me in just the
 correct way.  god loves me, because god loves everyone (even you) and I
 am part of everyone (and so are you).  Where's my phone?

        I have to go downstairs and use the payphone.  

        Hold on.



        ...



        Haha.  I went down stairs to use the payphone and realized my
 good loving phone was in my hand!  What a kind phone, to appear in my
 hand right when I need it most.  What else could I ask for in a
 companion?  Now only if the people I talked to on the phone were
 actually decent people worthy of spending my time with me.  I should
 stop spending my time and start selling it.  

        But then cheap ass bastards like Smoki would never come round no
 more.  He liked the smorgasbord in Madison, WI when we went up there to
 have his fur removed.  He was a nice creature until his fur got all
 chopped off and you could see his skin and it was so bad.  I think he
 was part dove, horse, and sea anemone.  I could be wrong.

        It's time for my daily calculus exercise.  I like to look
 literate when I write these, you know.  I feel like I'm touching a
 woman's skin as I type this to you.  The keyboard feels like a woman's
 skin.  Womens' skin is good.  Women are good.  I like Women.

        Calculus.  Woman.  Calc --  I will go dress up, I say, and I got
 dressed and went outside and HEY I've got boobs now.  I always get
 violated with them.  Between people looking at them and old men groping
 them, I never know what to do.

	"when ever you come around i'm a walkin' on shaky ground"

        that's how you make me feel -- you make me want to shake the
 ground.  I want to go through the throes of personal and fulfulling love
 with you, my angel, my poopheart, my fucking blistery fungus.  mmm. 

        I will melt wax on your stomach and then cut it off with a sharp
 knife.

        I will chew on your hair and scalp until your whole head is gooey
 with my thick saliva.

        I will squeeze your thigh until my hands have kneaded the fat
 enough that it will slink down your leg and come out between your big
 toe and its toenail.

        I will pinch your nipple nine times and then subtract 3 so it's
 6.  6 times a lady.  Then you're done.

        This time it's for real.  Let's party.  Put on the hat, it's not
 over yet.  Strap down.  Get a drink.  Don't shoot me.  Shoot him!  Ha ha,
 I laugh at your antics for you are a silly person, you do silly things
 that often I command you to do because if I didn't tell you silly things
 to do you would never do anything silly and that would be boring!  It is
 advantageous to know every thing you're going to do before you do it.
 And it's amazing that you fall for it every time.  You are a dumb whore.
