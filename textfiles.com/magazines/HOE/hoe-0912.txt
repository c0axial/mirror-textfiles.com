 Dear Summer, 

	Having received your love letter of November 7th, 1999, I feel  
 the need to respond to one or two items that have presented themselves. 

	(1) I do not spend my life trying to emulate philosophers, but
 rather I spend my life trying to emulate the famed madman Klaus Kinski.
 In fact, tonight, I saw a documentary on the great beast called _MY BEST
 FIEND_, directed by his long time cuhlabuhraiter Werner Herzog. I was
 surprised by Herzog's depth of emotion for Kinski, who had savaged the
 director in his autobiography _ALL I NEED IS LOVE_ (now available under
 the title, and in a slightly edited format, as _KINSKI UNCUT_.) Werner
 genuinely missed Klaus.
	
	I genuinely miss Klaus, too, which is why I take such an affront
 to your besmirching his good memory by implying that I spend my time
 trying to emulate any other. 

	I'm a one man man, man. 

	(2) I am not driven by envy. I am driven by petty jealousy and
 self-loathing. I am merely consumed by envy. Please note the difference. 

	Thank you for writing. I am, 

							Sincerely Yours,
							Jarett Kobek
