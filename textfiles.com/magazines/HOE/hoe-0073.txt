    This is a little paper on improving one's life and one's self through the
constructive use of rage.  By rage, I essentially mean anger.  Undirected
anger is what I really focus on, and will refer to it as rage.  Rage is
therefore undirected anger.  This is when you are just mad at the world.
This is the "I'm gonna punch the next person I see right in the bread basket"
or "I hate the whole world".  Directed anger, or just anger, is the "Oooh,
she just pisses me off" or "#$!%?, you just wrecked my favourite car".  These
two are essentially the same, but that will be addressed later.  Also
important are the qabalistic ideas of form and force.

    A force is just that.  It is raw energy.  Easy examples are gravity and
and magnetism.  Some others are physical force, love, and desire.  If you
push on something, you are supplying it energy to move.  If you are in love,
you are infused with energy to take actions you wouldn't normally do.  The
same thing with desire.  Note there is no distinction between 'physical' and
'spiritual' forces.  This is key to magic and Qabalah, but isn't important
here.  The important idea is that force is energy.
    
    Form is the idea of constraint.  Form surrounds us and keeps our world 
from being just raw energy.  When you burn gas in your car, the piston
directs that energy into motion you can use.  When you pour water in a bowl,
the bowl provides a form for the water to shape to.  When you are in love,
you still have your sanity (usually) because you execute forms over your
desire.  Those form are... well... plots and plans and stuff.  You take that
love and desire, and with is constrain it to buying flowers, remembering
birthdays, and planning romantic time to spend together.  You are able to
apply form over forces because of consciousness.  Consciousness is the final
part of the world, which I have yet to fully explore.  This means the three
elements that are combined to make the rest of the universe are form, force,
and consciousness.
    
    The point of all this is that Anger is mostly force, but partly form.
Rage is almost totally force, with very little form.  Just as consciousness
allows us to apply form to force, I have found it allows us to remove form
from force.  If you are angry at someone, often that Anger changes form
without our knowledge, so we snap at the next person that talks to us. "But
you're not mad at me, why are you snapping at me?"  Right there you have
changed the form of a force with out thought.  Wasn't that easy?!
    
    Now then, one step further is the conversion of Anger into Rage.  If you
Ever get angry, the first step is to blame it on the entire universe, or at
least some abstract concept.  Whatever justification you use, it still works
the same.  Astrology tells us the stars affect your life.  Society has a
large part of screwing up your life.  Greed has brought down many people.
Some feel Adam screwed us all by committing the original sin.  Some say it was
Eve.  You could just be safe and blame satan.  All of these however are
merely abstract concepts.  Two ways to blame the world are through chaos
theory and qabbalah (or at least my current version).
    
    Chaos theory holds that every part of the universe affects every other
part.  There are millions of butterflies.  If they all flap their wings at
the same time, they could change weather patterns, and they do.  Driving in
cars has some affect on the revolution of the earth.  Skyscrapers as well.
This change may seen tiny, but will eventually affect us, and may send us
hurtling into the sun one day.  The point is everything affects everything
else.

    Qabblah holds that the entire universe and everything in it can be 
explained and understood by understanding the tree of life.  It serves as a
pattern, in which anything and everything fits.  This means that every action
of one thing is mirrored by others that fit into the same place on the tree.
Although I do not fully understand this pattern, it does exist.  It also
interconnects the entire universe.

    Whatever justification you use, you want Anger to become Rage.  Once this
is done, move on to the next step.  Release the form of Rage.  This is not
forget it.  This is not bury it.  This is not hide it.  Nor is it release it
in a long scream.  It is release the form of Rage, leaving only raw force.
Once this form is released, you should feel blank.  On this note, it may help
to do something that makes you feel blank when trying to do this like writing
your name a million times or doing random problems from and Algebra book.
This force will release itself later when you need it.  I have not yet
learned to control this release, but will no doubt tell you if I do.  The
point is it will probably release itself when you are happy, making you more
happy.  Actually now that I think about it, it releases itself when you let
go to yourself.  Go to a party and you'll  have the time of your life.  Get
angry and you'll go beserk, but feel good afterwards.  Get sad and you'll
have a temporary nervous breakdown, and feel great afterwards.  Or simply
hang your tongue out, and release it into wackiness.  Sounds strange, but it
works... for just that reason.
    
    For advanced students, try turning sadness or shame into Anger.  Through
this method you can turn any negative emotion into raw force.

    The problem with this method is that if you are inactive, and do nothing 
to expel you force, it can become unbalancing and overwhelming.  Another 
problem is you end up walking around with a lot of Rage that hasn't been
digested into force.  This is especially true in the early stages.  As a
partial remedy, I suggest wearing leather collars, bracelets, and combat
boots.  These, but their very nature, radiate Rage.  This radiated Rage
serves well to help keep your force at tolerable levels.

    As with anything, you have to come up with you own system.  These are
only my suggestions, and I hope they  are helpful.

                        Good Luck.

 "Because I'm good enough, smart enough, and (dog gone it) people like me."
