        'Life is what you make it...' I've heard these six words basically my
 entire life spoken by my mother.  It didn't matter what type of situation it
 was.. YOU determine how it will turn out.  Which I always thought was the
 biggest bunch of bullshit I had EVER heard!  I mean.. c'mon.. you can't
 always control what happens in your life.  Even IF you make the best of
 every situation.. you can still end up screwed!  That was my whole
 philosophy in high school.. and up until 5 months ago I believed that my
 life, no matter how hard I tried to make it good, made no difference.

        Then I met someone that changed my whole outlook on my life.. and
 actually started to help me to believe that I can do whatever I want and
 actually be happy.  So.. now I'm happy.. and am all for the 'Life is what
 you make it..' speel.

        I bet you're wondering what the point of all my rambling is.. right?
 Well.. you would think that perhaps my mom would be happy about me finally
 believing what she's told me all these years.  *laughs* Now now.. can we
 EVER make our parents happy?
