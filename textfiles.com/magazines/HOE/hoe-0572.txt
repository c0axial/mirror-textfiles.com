        I was busy being the passenger in a champagne-colored car.  I wasn't
 in the passenger seat, I was in the back seat, I always am.  We were
 driving down Michigan Avenue.  You have to take Michigan Avenue to get
 anywhere useful around here.  I think we were headed home, though, and that
 place really isn't useful.  It's quite useless, we're always there.  I
 think I'm using this "we" thing as just me, because I was sort of
 unattached from all reality at that moment.  I was staring blanky out a
 window, it was dusty.  No one had written, "WASH ME!" on it, though, which
 is sad.  Sad that the champagne-colored car isn't good enough to have "WASH
 ME!" written on it, or maybe it's too good for that.  I haven't decided
 which is the greater evil of the two.  Too good or too bad.  Either way,
 you're not getting something or not being grateful for it, in which case
 you shouldn't have gotten it in the first place.

        There was a car place.  One of those places that sells cars.  It was
 across from a Ford plant, so it was selling Ford cars.  There were about 50
 places selling the same cars in one block.  There must have been real
 competition for business there.  I couldn't decipher between the cars.
 They were all shiny and colored, like most cars, if they've been washed.
 They all had price tags.  I'm sure the price tags were all different, but I
 didn't have my contacts in so that didn't matter.  it was quite a peaceful
 scene, me in that car surrounded by all the lonely cars which've yet to be
 bought.  I think there was music playing.  It probably wasn't too good, I
 don't remember what it was.  Someone might have been singing along, I don't
 remember that either, they probably had a good singing voice.  Most people
 who sing along sing well.  Most.

        I can't find the proper words to describe this car place and this
 car and me in the backseat with the person singing along to some kind of
 music that was playing.  I just can't do it.  I don't even know if they
 exist, and even if they do, I don't know about their existence.  If I don't
 know about something's existence, then it doesn't matter, right?  If no one
 reads this, it doesn't matter that I couldn't find the words.  It might not
 even matter if people do read it.  I wish I was a painter, or a singer, or
 something.  I would gladly grab a paintbrush and paint you a picture of
 this car place and this car and me in the backseat with the person singing
 along to some kind of music.  I can't, though.  I often try to draw, hoping
 for some semblance of artistic ability.  It never shows up.

        Singers are much more useful than my voice, which is usually
 somewhat monotone.  Singers can sing octaves, you know?  Good ones, at
 least, like the ones who sing along.  They can convey emotion in their
 voice, and everyone listens, because it sounds nice.  The existence is
 known always, by someone.

        I'm not a singer.  I'm not a painter.  I'm not anything special.  I
 have text and I have english and a little french, but everyone could if
 they wanted it.  Not everyone can sing, and being a real good painter
 usually requires something a tad inherited or born with.  One of those
 phrases or words or whatever.  It requires _talent_.  My words and text and
 english and french can be taught.  Taught by an old teacher with a bald
 spot in K-mart jeans that were 3 sizes too small 3 years ago.  I've never
 had a teacher like that, but I'm sure one exists.

        I don't know where this is going.  Probably nowhere.  Nowhere is a
 good place to go, mainly because it's no specific place, and it can be
 anything.  It's one of those few things that don't require a specific
 definition.  "Somewhere" doesn't require a specific definition, either.
 That takes a little glory off of "nowhere."  Too much glory is a bad thing
 anyway.  That's not a jackoff of a cliche though, because there are certain
 things one cannot simply have enough of.  There's always that one song that
 you can listen to on repeat, because it completely changes your out look on
 life for about 3 minutes.  Go somewhere.

        Did you know I cry?  I do.  Not an absurd amount, but enough to
 substantially qualify me as someone who does, indeed, cry.  That's as far
 as I'm going tonight.  I cry.  The end.
