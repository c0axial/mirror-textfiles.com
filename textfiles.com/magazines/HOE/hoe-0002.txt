 FOUR SCORE AND TWENTY YEARS AGO
 our fore fathers broke the ground
 To dig the foundations of a new nation
 With careful attention and tender slave exploitation
 There, in society's foundation,
 
 lies a reason for the dark violence around us.

 Since those early days of the FIRST civil way,

 The architects of our micro-world, our city and suburbs,
 have built up the country with metal and plactics,
 Built up a towering, iron-wrought America.
 I was taught America
 was strong, high and long
 Reached the sky, nothing wrong, America.

 The great Steel Builing Nation
 Shimmering in frozen sunlight
 Perfect, stream-lined shell
 Mirror windows keeping eyes out.
 Now, we witness the crumbling.
 'Cause the Office building
 is all full of starving, angry children
 Who, night after night, go awfully cold
 Awfully bare and bombarded
 Cold hearted, insensitive and incensed.
 The violated tenents are becoming violent.
 Can we blame them? Yes! No!
 Who's the friend and who's the foe?
 Even the architects can't see where this line should go.

 The corporate penhouse offices
 Rise above our heads,
 Ride the city
 Like the streets are waves
 And office holders are the crest.
 Smiling white, foaming 
 at the mouth.
 NOW, WE WITNESS THE LOW TIDE.
 As the building sways in a gust of distrust,
 Dark sparks fly into our eyes
 As we build up, BUILD UP, BUILD UP to the Sun--
 filled days of our ever--Present Hades;
 We build so high, but hell follows us into the heavens
 And lurks between our cubical walls.

 There's no shade from trees that stand so far below,
 No parents to train us, or comfort us in woe
 the children and trees get hacked at, burned and bleed.
 Why do we keep killing the things we need?
 Rhetorical questions echo all over the media screen,
 The networks scream:
 "STOP THOSE TEENS!"
 And I just look away and think how pitifully short their memory is,
 Like a siv, sifting out how brutal history is.
 Teens act now as grown men have always lived.
 The TRICKLE DOWN VIOLENCE
 drips it's red substance
 down the sky slicing building
 Down the generation X
 Why?
 ZAP!

 The thick walls of America ward away the light
 Warn away all innocence
 Don't dare stay too close
 To the walls of repulsing personalities,
 Cults and creative destroyers,
 Red with frustration, hard like a brick.

 How do I feel, what do I feel as I walk the corridor?
 I feel glaring eyes, and spiteful words, discouraging thoughts
 And parched spirits with not enough spirit
 to get out from behind cubical--neighbors
 and make good or do good.
 I feel dead again and again and again,
 Like my nerve endings have no beginings.

 I go pulsating and feeling my way out
 through the roars and raunch
 All around me, searching for restored morality
 In this chasmm of thickening anomy,
 I'm sickened by the sights,
 Saddened by our plight,
 I call out: "How long till we learn to live together right???"

 Humanity is cracking to peices
 Constantly at the end of history
 Where do we finally find the final way,
 The Glorious truth, the enlightening day?

 That peace lies strewn across
 Man's inner landscapes
 And seems as likely to come about
 As adam and eve making apple pie
 in a microwave.

 Peace resides in humble homes
 That the rumbling tones
 Of darkness cannot penitrate.
 Peace prospers as people's perspectives are perfected.
 Peace walks on the bridges that span the space
 Between the many worlds that now exist blindly side by side, 
 never touching.

 Peace comes to families that walk side by side
 down the center of the road;
 Eating half of what they could, giving all they can
 To their fellow man-
 dated makers of the world view - earth shapers.
 As the building collapses
 from the top down
 From the bottom up
 The tenents must remember that the ground awaits our return
 Awaits the collapes followed by the rebuilding,
 a new building made of moral materials.

 Peace begins when puzzling shards of enlightenment
 Are pieced together to mirror our dreams
 And beam our struggle upward out through the universe
 Like some magic sattlelite
 Flooding Earth in a sunrise of sweet hope.
