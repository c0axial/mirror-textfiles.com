 !!========================================================================!!

        My brother is a fucking weirdo.

        Travis is known at high school for being "the kid everyone
 wants to beat up".  He has long blonde hair, wears mostly tie-dye and
 flannels, and your ordinary, average big-leg jeans, and a gigantic
 jingle-bell that dangles from his shoes and jangles VERY LOUDLY as he
 walks.

        All he's doing is carrying on the family tradition.  Everytime
 I look at my brother, I see reflections of my own high school years,
 when I would wander around with my pink plastic Animaniacs backpack,
 with all of my friends making a train down the hallway to British Lit.
 I remember walking Monkees-style down the hall, blocking all traffic,
 singing the Sesame Street theme song at maximum volume.

        But this story is not about me.

        Travis was trying to do his homework (trying is the key word),
 and I kept interrupting him as I read various t-files I had downloaded
 from all these people who urged "READ MY 'ZINE!!!"  As I approached the
 end of Grill #1, I discovered that maybe my brother wasn't so different
 after all.  In fact, in a parallel universe (okay, maybe just in
 Illinois), SOMEONE ELSE collected bizarre things.  And oddly enough, HE
 HAD FOUND SOME OF THE SAME ITEMS (including pictures of unknown people
 kissing and foreign candy bar wrappers.  Go figure).

        You're free, Travis. You're not the only fucking weirdo out
 there.
