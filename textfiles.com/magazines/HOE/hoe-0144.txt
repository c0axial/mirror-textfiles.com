        Ultimately, in breaking up, Casey revealed to me what she never
 could, her tears and her true emotion; but I did not join her, maybe because
 she was crying for what never was, for the severing of a connection which
 reached a level not nearly as low as the pain of the cut itself; I wonder if
 I should have cried and if I should have let her destroy what we had, but we
 couldn't even talk about what we said or what we did.
