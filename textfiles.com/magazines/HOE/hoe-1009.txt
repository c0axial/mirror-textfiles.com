	"Hansel and Gretel walked into the dark woods looking to have an
 adventure." said the first line, and not the second.  the second told of
 a land far away with purple statues of ancient kings, and their birds,
 who wore little coats made of copper, or perhaps, just maybe, made of
 gold, we cannot tell because the statues are of stone, and the time was
 so ever long ago it cannot be remembered.

	said the little bird: my favorite color is yellow, what is yours?

	said the man to the bird (who wore a shiny vest):  green!

	said the little bird: four and twenty blackbirds, to be sure.

	said the man:  i know it will rain soon, and ever after for a long
 bit as well.

	said the man's companion, whom always lived on his shoulder or in
 his ear, or above his knee:  something will fall, or break, perhaps.

 	and, well, that was that.

	but soon they both died, because, you know, that is what happens.
 almost always someone dies, and then goes on to live again, or so says a
 belief.
