        Nybar didn't walk into the airport bar looking for conversation.
 Just to get completely drunk before his flight.  He'd get both.  Keep in
 mind, the chat began when Nybar was sober and ended with him inebriated as
 hell.

        "You know, pal" this was a man next to him.  "You don't seem like the
 sort of person to be a power drinker, but you're just sitting in silence,
 knocking 'em back.  Do you have some kind of problem you want to talk
 about?"

        "Appearances can be deceiving, you know." replied Nybar with a
 chuckle.

        Meanwhile, in the apartment, Keith and Guy had been instructed by
 Jubjub to stay in their monitoring room no matter how much sound they heard.
 He was obeyed.  In the bedroom, Dawn was fumbling with her clothes.

        "I seek inspiration from weird places; insane places.  For example,
 when I'm swimming and need to do thousands of laps, I often look at the ot
 her people in the pooland ponder what their motivation is.  Even though they
 don't know it, it becomes my goal to 'defeat' them, you see?.. and I imagine
 bizzare scenarios that explain us competing, you see?"  Nybar asked, his
 eyes a little wild.

        "Not really, can you give me an example?"

        "Well, once I was swimming, right?..and there were all of these
 Chinese people swimming, too.  Getting a work-out, or whatever.  So, I start
 thinking in the context of a 1980's pro-labor movie: 'Oh, those commies beat
 us in the auto industry, now they want our pools, too?'"

        "That's fucking insane."

        "I'm aware of this."

        In the apartment, Jubjub and Dawn are having a good time.  Keith and
 Guy are sour as hell and not paying attention to their job.  This was on the
 6'th floor.  In the lobby, a fake FBI badge is flashed and, soon, stairs are
 run up.  Keith and Guy notice nothing.

        "You know, sometimes you've just got to have some sort of purpose in
 life.  Otherwise you're just sitting around in Wayne, smoking blunts.  If
 people don't understand the overwhelming intensity I treat my work with,
 that's because they don't understand that for me, it's life itself.  I'll
 never be-- sorry for being so pretentious.  I'm getting a little drunk."

        "That's okay"--the man flashes his white teeth--"sometimes you've got
 top reach, or you just end up preaching to yourself and get crazier and
 crazier.  Not that you have."  They both chuckle.  Nybar's plane has just
 departed.

        "But ya see, man" Nybar continued.  "The worry is always that, I
 preach too much, I get too pretentious--you know, if I feel too much above
 the people whom I honestly consider idiots, I lose my connection with the
 world.  And in the deadly..the deadly _games_ I play, this can't be allowed
 to happen, it's just that..." Nybar sighs and takes a drink.

        Keith and Guy stubbornly refuse to leave the monitoring room, even
 when they hear the loud crash of the door being kicked in, and the
 thunderous stampede of booted feet rushing in.

        "Hahaha, yeah, that was DOOOOOOOOPE.  KRS-1 is DOOOOOOOOOPE!  I'm
 suprised to find another white boy in thish airport bar who likesh rap."

   	"Yeah, it's pretty suprising."	The ski-mask wearing, jackbooted
 government thugs in Nybar's apartment use a miniature battering ram to knock
 down the monitor room door.  Keith shoots two of them before him and Guy are
 sent back to oblivion.  A low moan comes from the bedroom, causing the
 leader of the strike team to raise his ears under his mask.

        In the airport bar, the man Nybar has been talking to raises a
 walky-talky to his mouth and utters 2 words: "Move in."

        ...TO BE CONTINUED, IN THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ALL UP TO NOW!!!!
