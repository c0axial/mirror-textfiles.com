        There were many before me, but none quite like me. Some were well
 known, like Jesus, Mohamad, Hitler, Moses, the snake in the Garden of Eden.
 The other names were lost in history, never to be known... just fogotten
 with time. Great politicians of the spiritual plain, here to gather up
 forces for the great battle foretold throughout history, and known as
 Armaggedon. The two sides were formed long ago, and it was well documented
 in the Bible. God and the Archangel, Micheal, banashing Lucifer, often known
 as Satan, to Hell. The bitterness between the two sides were great, and a
 cold war began, with our own existence being the battle ground. Both sides
 sent forward great saviors, and great evils. Both sides had victories and
 losses, as in any war. Both sides proclaimed their glory the higher. But it
 was a war none the less. A war that both sides, after millenia of fighting,
 became tired of. They realized the pointless nature of the war, but could do
 nothing to stop it. The people they had enlisted, through years of
 propaganda and promises. Finally, in the last century of the second millenia
 after the birth of Jesus, the most horrible attrocities were commited by
 people on both sides, and the spiritual plain grew concerned.  The human
 race was quickly headed toward self-destruction. For most of the century, in
 human terms, the great warriors tried to remember how to be thinkers. God
 himself was at a loss. Both sides decided that the differences between them
 were, at most, a difference in taste. They both strived for the same things,
 but in different manners. The evil ones, wanted war, corruption, greed,
 survival of the quick witted and dishonest. The good ones wanted peace,
 equality, and a chance for everyone, no matter their faults. So, in a moment
 of mutual despair, both sides laid down arms, and held a galactic meeting of
 the opposing forces.

 Chapter 1
 ---------

        They could think of only one answer. Since both sides had such strong
 followings on earth, a medium between them must be put on earth. To ensure
 the largest following possible he was sent twenty years before the millenium
 ended. To accomplish the task at hand they gave him supernatural sense, so
 that guidance from the newly formed allies could be recieved. He was given a
 dark power source, from the most powerful and hottest deapths of Hell, and
 was also given the white cause of heaven, to ensure that balance was
 maintained. Due to the great amount of energy he would be able to control he
 needed the intelect and ability to make his own decisions. That way after
 the basic instructions were given as a child, he would be able to continue
 his mission, even if things turned sour on the spiritual plain. Mentally,
 emotionally and spiritually, he was quite different, and in some ways,
 almost too perceptive. Physically, however, was left to the genetics of the
 human parents lucky enough to be chosen. Everything about his apparent
 existence looked normal. The only thing different was his abnormal learning
 process, his urge to learn all that he could, and his unique view of the
 world. It both set him apart from the people he was sent to save, and, later
 in life, made him quite well known. All of this was planned ahead of time.
 However, since a joint venture of this type was never tried before, and the
 two sides had decidedly different methods of doing things, something was
 bound to go wrong. It did.

 Chapter 2
 ---------

        To cross over form the plain of existence that they are in to ours is
 a tricky one. The amount of energy they posses must be condensed into a
 physical form of our size. The opposing forces in this cross-over were so
 great that when the energy reformd on our side, a great spiritual explosion
 took place, and much of the chosen one's spiritual energy was spread over
 the world, not disconnected from him, but still quite faint. At this point,
 no intervention was possible, and all the higher beings could do is hope
 that everyhting else was fine, and that the mission would be able to be
 carried out. Of course, with much of his energy, and hence, his supernaturl
 senses, spread over the world, he lost any sense of where he came form, or
 what he was supposed to do. but they didn't know that. not until it was too
 late.
