	Three ladies searched through their purses.  One found a comb, one
 found a lamp.  The third lady, small.  She looked without her eyes, they
 were focused on the mirror.  She is vain, but really--she does not see
 herself--she sees an eye, and a mouth, no hair or eyes or noses.  She
 has lost her sense of smell.  She had lost her ability to say anything
 three times fast, but she doesn't let it stop her.

        Gray and white.  Down are her eyes--down on the floor that is gray
 and white.  Really white, just here, in the long hallway, all cracked
 and dirty, mopped and stained.  around the corner, on a black tile, through
 the door, and out into sunshine.

        No sunshine here, the sun has died.  Artificial lights blind her,
 and had her sense of smell been alive, the smell of mexican and japanese
 and italian.

        Four, three, two, one, twenty-six, forty-nine.

        "Only two more days!"

        "Before what?"

        "Before!"

        "Before WHAT?"

        "Just before, there is no what.  Or, there won't be any whats."

        The old lady frowned.  

        "My dear girl, how could this be?" she said to the bee buzzing in
 here ear.

        "Simply," replied the mouse in the corner, gnawing on a piece of
 cheese.

	the old woman hurried outside, leaving her hat and gloves and
 jacket and everything else behind.  A RABBIT MET HER AT THE FRONT DOOR
 AND TOLD HER HE WAS THERE FOR HER BROTHER.  SHE REPLIED, "MY BROTHER IS
 ALREADY GONE!"  AND THAT WAS THAT.

	she rushed on outside to check for the sun, to see it was there.  
 she left her sunglasses and hurt her eyes in the noon-time sun and then
 saw the moon.
