        Here they are!  The long awaited, much anticipated rules for the
 great game of FACE CARD, FACE CARD, EVERYBODY LOVES A FACE CARD!!!!!!!

        The Deck:  Get two decks of cards.  Make them into Euchre decks, but
 also include 2's.  That means keep all cards that are 2, 9, 10, Jack,
 Queen, King, or Ace and put the rest aside.  You'll also need to put in
 four Jokers. This is the deck for a four player game.  If you want a large
 game, with more than four players, add another deck just like this one for
 every two additional players.

        The Object:  You try to get the best hand of face cards you can.
 Each hand is worth a certain number of points, the lower the better, and
 once you reach 500 points, you're out.  The game continues until only one
 person remains.  That person is what's called The Winner to use a technical
 term.

        The Deal:  Each player gets four cards.  The rest are placed in the
 middle as the Draw Pile.

        The Draw:  On the first time around, you draw three cards and
 discard one.  One the next round you draw one card and discard three.  This
 means your hand will alternate from 4 to 6 to 4 every other round.  When
 drawing, you can pick from the draw pile, the discard pile, or from both
 when drawing three cards.

        The Play:  When you think you have a good hand of face cards (and it
 must be all face cards) you call "FACE CARD, FACE CARD, EVERYBODY LOVES A
 FACE CARD!!!!" after you discard.  This marks the final round and is the
 equilivent of "knocking" in other card games (Excluding Magic: The
 Gathering).  When this last round gets back to you, you shout "FACE CARD,
 FACE CARD, EVERYBODY LOVES A FACE CARD!!!!" once again and slam your cards
 down on the table.  Then all points are totaled.

        The Face Card?: The cards are divided into 4-card hands and 6-card
 hands to correspond to how many cards you'll have in your hand at the end
 of a turn.  The cards are noted as:  K=King, Q=Queen, J=Jack, A=Ace, F=Any
 Face Card, X=Any Non-Face Card, ff = Two of the Same Face Card,
 xxxx = Four of the same Non-Face Cards, j=Joker, and 2=2.

        The Ace is not a Face Card, it is only an Ace.  Jokers are Jokers, 
 not wild.  Most decks picture the Joker with a face, and therefore it
 counts as a Face Card.  If your deck has Jokers without any discernable
 face, then they count as Non-Face Cards.  Some decks are made by Disney and
 all the cards will have a face on them.  Obviously in desks such as these,
 ALL cards count as Face Cards, so hands that need Non-Face Cards in them
 just don't exist when playing with these decks.  Jokers and Aces are used
 in Special Hands that will be described seperately.

        The Rank:  Point values, rank, and names for the hands are as
 follows:

 4-Card Hands:

	KKKK  The Birth of Christ   1pt
