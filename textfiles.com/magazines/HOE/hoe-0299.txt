 - "Know"
 - by Altrocks

 Do you?
 Do you?
 Do I?
 Does anyone?
 Know?
 No.
 I don't think so.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "Time"
 - by Altrocks

 Time is energy,
 Because it can FORCE people apart,
 It can PULL at their usually stable relationships,
 It can PUSH it's way inbetween them,
 It causes differences,
 It makes problems.
 It and it's sister DISTANCE.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "Anymore"
 - by Altrocks

 Anymore.
 No more.
 No one.
 Anywhere.
 Anything.
 Anymore.
 Nevermore will things be the same.
 They never are.
 The last stable pillar...
 The last Constant...
 The last anchor...
 Destroyed by a menial thing,
 Like you.

 - "sleepy"
 - by Anjee

 the sun slowly rises
    as the tingles
  let their presence known
     at last.
 sleep would feel good
 it'd feel even better
  if i put it off
      for a while.
    the weights on my eyelids get
 heavier.
     i can torture my sleepy mind,
   soul
 with stories of fiction
  or love [fiction]
    although i would much prefer
 sitting in front of a cold screen
  that whispers
 non-existant words
      from people who have
    similar sleeping disorders.
 which eventually leads to
 boredom.        but that doesn't
     cooperate very well with the
   sleeping habits of an
 insomniac.
       but who am i to complain?
   i simply wish i could go to
 bed.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "scattered emotions"
 - by Anjee

 cold
 wrapping around my tired soul
 empty . . . took possession of my mind
 numbed my brain,
 heart.
 love, left me in the rain
 vulnerable, 
 sought a way into my weak body. . .
 meanwhile, hate sept through
 the pores of my aging
 skin.
 pain decided to stay around for
   another day
 and hurt crept up on me
 when i was looking the other way.
 run,
    run faster
              further. . .
 but it never goes away.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "Poem"
 - by AnonGirl

 poetry is meaningful, and deep
 or it is shallow and empty
 it can be straight forward
 or it can be so goddamn confusing.
 periods here, commas there
 Capitalized or not?

 poetry can be about hate yet mean love,
 vice versa
 it discusses love,
 and how painful it is
 it discusses pain,
 and how lovely it is

 There once was a girl named Belle
 She always had something to sell
 She became very broke
 And choked on Diet Coke
 And was then sent straight down to Hell  

 these are types of poetry
 there are many sorts
 they are opposite of me

 poems were meant to make sense
 although some don't
 some are nice and pretty
 and use words such as
 trees, love, frolick, ponder, lillies, sunset, ducks
 it can rhyme or not
 But all in all I think that poetry sucks.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "animals"
 - by Apollo

 the scorpion making its way
 structures below falling apart.
 sand that blows in her mind
 can never understand me.

 swans flying, high above
 clouds falling on top.
 the worms that crawl in her soul
 can never know me.

 mouse running away
 cats claws flying close.
 th fire that burns her bdoy
 can never feel her.

 the flowers are gone
 my head is falling apart.
 my body, soul or mind 
 can never love her.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "ansi"
 - by Belial
 
 ansi, ansi - in my pants
 ansi, ansi - ansi dance

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "hackers"
 - by Belial
 
 hackers are fun,
 hackers are neat,
 if i was one,
 i would be elite.

 if i was a hacker,
 not that i care,
 i'd be a slacker,
 and have long hair.

 i would be as swift as a fox,
 it would be cool.
 i'd hack root on a box,
 and make the admin look like a fool.

 i'd change the motd,
 i'm not sure what it would say...
 something flashy...
 maybe, "you are owned, now go away!"

 but that's not enough,
 a hacker is more,
 i'd do all kinds of k-rad stuff,
 and i'd never score.

 actually, what?
 that's not right.
 hackers are sluts,
 they have sex every night.

 i do know,
 maybe i'm wrong.
 i better take this slow,
 /nick kingkong.

 - "Shine"
 - by Cappacino 

 And so i shine.
 though dimly-lit and discouraged to start--
 i fight and consume what i need and breathe
 until and ONLY until there is no doubt
 in anyone who sees me,
 I shine,
 absolutely.

 Brilliance,
 in every aspect of the word,
 is what i am,
 as i continue with what i will always be,
 shining.

 Why do I shine?
 a flash of doubt has seeped into your mind.
 'Does it matter?' is my only reply.
 the depths of my mind,
 everything that i encompass
 extends far beyond your own
 self-imposed boundaries of space & time.

 because while i sit, and shine,
 and you all sit, and watch,
 my soul shines ominpotently--
 everlasting,
 an immortal flame,
 and i have shone,
 as i shine now before you,
 and i will continue to shine,
 long after you whither and pass away...

 - "useless words"
 - by Cstone

 words are far too intarticulate.
 but if silence could be constructed,
 what wouldn't we lose?
 can't we improve without destroying ourselves?
 could we fashion an uninterruptable silence--
 not subject to the blur of our minds--anyway?

 we can't; we can't even question why we can't
 without being uselessly repetitive; but it
 happens anyway.  what is our recourse?
 dismissal.

 - "Sonnet for the Girls Who Wore Too Much Eye Make Up
    and Made Me Read Their Poetry In Junior High."
 - by Cyn

 Words pour out of you,
 like muddy water's knell,
 from a deep, deep, deep well,
 ready to become a poem's brew.
 Poor teen-angst-filled girl.
 Your life is oh-so-tragic.
 You have to write its magic
 before your brow can unfurl.
 You're so full of tragedy,
 you could be a Greek play,
 but instead you write a song.
 When you give it to me,
 All I can think to say 
 is "That was really long."

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "the gospel according to ernest"
 - by Ernest "The Cat" Miller

 i am three time world karate champion
 i can tear your heart out in three seconds
 ya'll better lock all the doors in this place
 i'm fixin' to beat every one of you up
 i'm the real deal
 i'm the greatest
 somebody better call my momma

 - "Voltron"
 - by G0ff (a haiku written sometime in 1987)

 Voltron will eat you.
 He really wants to eat you.
 He thinks you'll taste good.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "love for all"
 - by The Jester (Jesse)

 i think that i love
 everything
 ever
 except:
 you
 the exception to
 my golden 
 rule of love for
 all?
 or do you mean everything to me?
 indecision? indecision?
 can it be chosen? in life?
 can god help?
 can anyone help?
 what should i do?
 can you tell me?
 i think i'd rather
 not 
 know come to think of it.
 my steady decline is much more
 sure
 than you ever were.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "an ode to noodles"
 - by The Jester (Jesse)

 ramen noodle;  you're my soup
 o the choices you give to me;
 beef, chicken, teriyaki, vegetable,
 you make me feel free.

 noodle, noodle in my cup.
 where hast thou gone?
 i have eaten you and your brothers,
 you were the jaun.

 you are all gone,
 you had great broth.
 you are all gone,
 but worth the cost.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "fresh salsa from new mexico"
 - by Jook

 the salsa flowed through my teeth
 like the first time i was in that
 bathroom stall with him / i had
 closed the door when he looked at
 me in my right eye and said /

 "thanks for the salsa last night.
 it tasted good on my eggs. my
 mother used to make salsa and
 eggs a lot like you did last
 night.

        the
                salsa
                        sat 
 on my eggs like my mom sat on my
 lap when i was eight."

 and on the eigth day, the salsa
 was bad, and he was bad, and
 the stall was bad.

 the bathroom stall in JC PENNIES
 filled itself to the brim with
 salsa that day the tomatoes and
 onions and peppers flowed from
 my eyes. the spice of my life
 was gone.

 as i shut the bathroom stall
 door on my way out, i turned
 my head a little to the right
 and said to the stall:

 i really do not like salsa
 anymore. i'll just stick with
 ketchup.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "Here"
 - by Kaia

 i invite you to play in this puddle with me!
 here, where the wheel appears to be turning backwards
 four words
 backwards.
 and the preacher is standing with his hands in the air
 exalted, exclaiming, "take this machine, all of you, and feed it!"
 he's bawling like a cat stream,  "don't go"

 "party in my paycheck, you know it
  feed  the machine, breathe the sun 
  clean up the orbit, you hear
  down the river of beer and a lush.
  i'm a drunken asshole!"

 feed the machine.

 "send my message over valleys of yore
  from the pillars to the ends of the earth!"

 you want me to what?
 stick my what in the where?
 i can't do that.  i just 
 i'm sorry, i
 i have to wash my hair No, i
 i apologize to inform you regretfully that i
 am sorry that i sorry am that I am have sorry am  
 No Regrets.  No Regrets.  
 Know, Regress.
 I used up my last token on the betsy ross bridge and
 fuck, it's no use
 i really can't understand anything you're saying.

 - "butcher's counter"
 - by Kreid

 at the supermarket
 i sometimes like to hide behind the butcher's counter
 and masturbate
 my face pressed against hot soft meat
 but too often it's just too hard to ejaculate
 on lsd

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "money"
 - by Kreid

 right now i have $3.00 in my pocket
 tomorrow i'm gonna go get myself a nice dinner
 and i'll still have $3.00 in my pocket
 why?
 well, i'm going to leave my pants in my closet

 when you spend a day
 with no pants on

 - "blow job"
 - by Kreid

 i've never given a blow job before.
 i'm serious!  i never have.
 i don't think i ever will, either.
 and it's not because i have something against gay people...
 it's just that i have a permanent case of lockjaw.
 WHAT A SHITTY FUCKING WORLD WE LIVE IN!!! BY GOD SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME
 ah, well.  i can't stand this shit.

 - "Apparently"
 - by Lilnilhil

 Fingers, sockets
 bottled rockets
 nooses, doorways
 kick the chair.
 Guns and ammo
 click, then blammo
 red-stained walls
 as idiots stare.
 Leaps off buildings
 stabbings, drownings
 take me, help me
 get away.
 Band-aids, traction
 vaporaction
 apparently suicide
 ain't the way.

 - "You Use Emoticons"
 - by Mogel

 Please stop using emoticons, :)
 They are really annoying. :<
 I'll admit that, :o]
 on rare ocassion, :/
 there are times where you're being "cute", =)
 and it seems to fit, ;)
 but I highly doubt, :D
 those times happen every 10 seconds. :(

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "My Nazi Fantasy"
 - by Mogel

 If I re-enacted the concentration camps,
 in Nazi Germany,
 with the notion of purifying the world,
 Instead of sticking Jews in the lines,
 I'd stick women.
 Fat out, pretty in.

 McDonalds biggest mistake,
 beyond being disgusting,
 was letting retards work there.
 It let out a message to the other employees,
 which said,
 "even retarded people can work your jobs."
 And you probably have low self-esteem anyway,
 if you're working at McDonalds,
 but you certainly don't need it to be legally binding.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "A Hug from HELL"
 - by Mogel

 He used the energy of his hate,
 to fuel his hug,
 and he wrapped his arms around her body,
 imagining it was her neck,
 and he squeezed her so tightly,
 pretending he was strangling her,
 squeezing and squeezing.
 And when it was done,
 all she could say was,
 "That was a great hug!"
 "Heehee!"

 If she died,
 I would say,
 "Thank God,
 now I can write my novel."

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "BITE"
 - long car rides make me manic sometimes
 - oj makes me happy
 - by Mooer

 there be a number of ways to open a rock
 slow and perversely inadequate
 lovingly and retrospectively inaccurate.
 FUCK those fucky words

 the barbed open the doors to freedom
 your eyes open the window to the bloody pool
 i wept for you 
 i wept for you melodramatic fucker.

 love light speed of your drive
 make my tongues dry.
 tick tock you lyme disease
 what a tumor you are on my sleeve

 monday's are for lovers, 
 you slept in my covers,
 rhyme and reason
 are not of the season

 - "Sparky"
 - by Mutter

 I had a dog named sparky
 we named him that because he had metal balls
 and when he walked they used to scrape the gravel and cause sparks
 one day mommy said 
 sparky took a nap
 and won't wake up again
 ever.
 That's good, though. 
 He was fucking annoying.

 !!========================================================================!!

 - "the man"
 - by Mutter

 the man says people can't smoke weed 'cause it brings together the masses
 and that's not his trip.

 the man says if I want food and water I have to compete for green paper.
 and that's not my trip.

 the man says I can't yell fire in a crowded theater.
 the man says I can't light the theater on fire first.
 You can't ever please him.

 the man says i should brush my teeth three times a day (and floss!)
 that's okay, though. 'cause I like brushing my teeth. Okay, the man ain't
 all bad.

 - by Obsidian

 wandering around wasted in the dying light
 bag ladies conversing with my priest carrying a case of ky jelly
 electric blue tears of a little girl
 cruxified on the lampshade
 brother, you got a dollar - listen to me
 maybe three bucks--i need a pack of smokes
 she gave for her soul and her life away
 for an orange gap sweater
 v-neck
 and she carries my soul in a backpack
 designer crucifix
 light me a candle
 i'll light a cigarette
 while she prays for my redemption
 and i can't give her what she wants

 - An Advocation for D.A.R.E. in Schools
 - by PezMonkey

 D.A.R.E. to keep the kids off drugs!
 Pop a lude?  "No way, dude!"
 Snort a line?  "No thanks, I'm fine!"

 Drugs are for slugs or thugs with bugs
 in their hair.  Be fair.  Oh I am, I am.
 Be kind.  Don't lose your mind.  Wait, the state 
 likes to masturbate while prevarication occurs.

 I am the very model of a modern major general
 if you must know.  If you mustent, well, then, 
 you know. . . don't.

 I like crack, jack.

 My penis is 3.7 inches long when erect.
 That was also my GPA in 3rd grade.  The first
 year of grades, you know.  What a long sad time
 ago that was. 

 I feel like the walls of my life have
 come a-tumblin' down when you blew the horn
 of plenty in my tea.

 I like buddha, gouda.

 Boopboopydoopboop.

 - "untitled"
 - by Phairgirl

 my world is deceit
 hypocrisy
 shameless selfishness of others
 i am tired
 of plates sown on others' backs
 only to be labeled as otherwise
 across their chests

 i define power
 yet my strength is weak against myself
 i divelge my secrets
 and am found yet alone
 i create
 i love
 i care
 i hate

 i am burdened with truths
 i cannot bear the consequences
 i close my mind
 from the sound of pitch black evil
 dew drop honey

 i feel warmth in containment
 i am drowned by silence
 i cherish the touch that tickles of love

 i want to kill

 i am silence within arising chaos
 my speech contains me
 my screams negate me
 i am spoiled by plush
 strapped by silver

 i am free in my world
 i am trapped

 I think girls should change
 They should be more like foodstuffs
 They would have a use.

 Where is my hoopde?
 I must find it to leave Zehr's
 The sky is falling.

 I once had an ex from the city
 Who wanted her life to be shitty
 She dated this dude
 Who bawled like a prude
 That silly lil' ex from the city.

 Of course I have sympathy for you. . .
 (You cry like a bitch)

 will you please come spend some time with me?
 Of course i will go with you.
 (You cry like a bitch)

 may i now please kiss you?
 Of course i will make out with you
 (You cry like a bitch)

 might we be together?
 of course i will move to be with you
 (You cry like a bitch)

 why don't you stop talking to him?
 of course i will abandon all of my friends for you
 (If you stop to think about it, you know, you really do cry like a 
  little fucking bitch)

 how very much in love we are.
 of course i will lose all dignity i have, all for you, my love.
 You cry like a fucking bitch.  You fucking bitch.

 "Maybe I'll just cut your head off"
 - by Retribution

 Mogel said write something funny
 funny? how about me with some money
 or maybe all the honies
 maybe even a cute little bunny

 THAT I CAN SQUISH AND KILL AND EAT
 THAT I CAN STOMP ON WITH MY FEET
 THAT I CAN SUFFICATE WITH A SHEET
 AND MAKE HIM SUCK MY MEAT

 or maybe i'll take a gopher
 i'll pretend he's a dog
 even name him rover
 or even a hog?
 nah, cause i just want wade boggs

 SO I CAN BEAT HIM WITH HIS BAT
 AND MAKE HIM EAT MY CAT
 AND MAKE HIM GO SPLAT
 AND THAT WILL BE THAT

 who cares about baseball?
 no good know-it-alls
 i need some over-alls
 or a uniform from u-haul

 then i can be a crazy man
 and say my name is tucan sam
 i can go "tucan sam i am"
 and then rape a full grown man
 AND DO IT TO A CAN OF SPAM
 CAUSE I'M CRAZY SON OF SAM
 THANK YOU MA'AM
 I'LL KILL ALL YOU INDIAN TANS
 CAUSE I'M THE SON OF UNCLE SAM

 or maybe i'll just stop writing lit
 cause i've had about enough of this shit
 i'll print this out and use it as toilet paper
 or grind it up and put it in the salt shaker

 CAUSE VIOLENCE GETS MY NUT OFF
 AND I'LL JUST GO AND CUT YOUR HEAD OFF
 SO NEENER NEENER NEENER
 I'LL CIRCUMSIZE YOUR WEENER.

 - "Bored"
 - by Retribution

 Damn i'm bored
 the cat just snored
 what the hell?
 MY FEET SMELL
 So i'll take off my belt
 and lie down on the felt
 while eating a tuna melt
 my feelings will be delt
 with

 I'M GONNA WHIP MYSELF
 right on my ass cheek
 I'M GONNA RIP MYSELF
 a new asshole, but yet so meek
 I'M GONNA DRIP MYSELF
 i have to take a sheet
 I'M GONNA WHIP MYSELF
 on my ass cheek

 So who cares?
 My care bares dare to care
 They talk to me when i'm awake
 They make my penis go and shake
 I dont skate
 Its too late
 I've determined my own fate
 I'm gonna be an hour late

 cause i must masturbate

 - "Giving Up"
 - by Rockstar (Girlie17)

 For as long as I can remember
 I've been alone.
 I'd see an escape, but realize
 It was only a hope.
 Not yet realized, not yet seen,
 Something that would come
 Just as a dream;
 Then fade away, twice as fast,
 Maybe reappear, then quickly pass.
 I always think that someday it will happen
 I'll find someone to love
 Someone who cares just enough
 Not to treat me as the rest have.

 He won't forget that I too feel.
 I'm more than a body
 I too have a soul -
 Easily crushed, filled with anger and pain.
 Why do I try over and over again.
 Some question me now,
 Wonder how I can detach,
 Emotion from physical, present and past.
 It's easy to stop trying to love.
 When every attempt is thwarted -- just lust.
 A woman needs attention, and affection and trust
 These things seem simple
 Yet so hard to find,
 So stop wondering why I gave up
 I'll never be yours, ..nor you mine.

 - "Angst Sonnet"
 - by Seaya

 Alone against an ivy-covered wall
 A sizzling ember in the cool night air
 A cigarette clasped in a hand so fair
 She holds her leather jacket in a ball
 A shadowed being draped in only black
 There are a thousand million of her kind
 They chalk it up to youth's forgetful mind
 Afraid of facing truths or looking back
 Why she had left them she would not betray
 If you had asked her plainly to her face
 The social worker gave up on her case
 "My parents do not care," she'd have a laugh
 "They live a life that I will never have."

 - "selected haiku"
 - by Shadow Tao

 i am not perky
 i am not the sun shining
 please leave me alone.

 i stare in wonder
 my hair is a tribute to
 aquanet science.

 you have the phat pants
 and you dance to the loud bass
 but are you raving?

 you have the glowsticks
 and you dance to scooter's songs
 but is that raving?

 your pacifier
 is covered in LSD
 but is it a rave?

 the dao of the snatch
 is not found in the pussy
 but in the throwing.

 so many warezboys
 i'd like to kick in the dick
 for their ignorance.

 with no route to host
 ping says all packets are lost
 but who would save them?

 i toss a value
 into the great /dev/null/
 it is like my mind

 - "playstation or IRC?"
 - by Styx

 do both at the same time
 unless you don't have a playstation
 in which case you are probably a black person
 who lives in the poor section of town
 or if you don't have a TV
 then you are probably also a black person
 who lives in the poor section of town

 - "Shot of Reality, Heavy on the Caffeine"
 - by Tasha

 my lipstick left
 on a styrofoam cup
 in this cheap
 corner of a dirt road
 diner
 but you swear
 it's the most feminine thing 
 about me
 short hair, bare earlobe
 chewed nails
 of a hand resting on your thigh
 tugging at the inseam
 of your salvation army jeans
 waitress gives me more coffee
 no cream no sugar
 you say it's better this way
 and the cockroach on my shoe
 is more fascinating than your eyes
 at midnight

 - "me too, neh?"
 - by Teerts

 why must we all fall into these
 vicious cycles?
 not only of using borrowed phrases :-)
 but also of our souls
 forgetting the past when they damn
 well know they should not.
 whywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhywhy!?@
 guess i thought i was above it,
 i forgot instead of living around it.
 now it is back again.
 why why why why why do you not go
 away and come back later!?@

 - "ode to a photoshop bitmap"
 - by Trilobyte

 i made a little picture
 brings tears right to my eyes
 it has a forlorn angel
 and devil in disguise.

 it was to be my prom night
 you wore a pretty dress
 your hair was fresh and styled
 your makeup was a mess.

 they took the lousy picture
 your arm locked up with mine
 in grandpa's fresh cut lawn
 with background of a pine.

 the night was quite a doozy;
 the climax came that morn
 when sharing all our passion,
 your foot set off the horn.

 now our love is over
 and i must show my pain
 by scanning in this photo
 in 24-bit TWAIN.

 i made you into satan
 with horns and twisty tails,
 a smile sticks to your portrait
 because your hate prevails.

 i gave myself a halo
 because i was so sweet
 i never once did hurt you --
 i'm not the one to cheat.

 i moved us from the yard
 and into someplace hot;
 a land that i won't visit,
 where someday you will rot.

 i hope you like my work
 and poem 'long with it
 it helps me to remember
 you really looked like shit.
