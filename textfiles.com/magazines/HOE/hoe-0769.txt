        If a concerned mother had been looking at the two white vans and the
 people inside, she would have bewailed the declining state of America, and
 the overwhelming prevalence of predators.  Within one of the vans is Jubjub
 with a gagged and tied girl.  In the other van is a dead body and Nybar.
 But if the mother decided that Nybar and Jubjub were evil predators, she'd
 be slightly off.  They ARE predators, but they're the most deserving of
 sympathy of the predators present.  The real evil by the river lies within
 the weathered figure with the fedora on his head, Gramsky, hiding within his
 blue Volvo.  And, of course, the paramilitary figures edging towards Nybar
 and Jubjub's position.
        One of the figures brushes against a cat, which loudly yawls.  The
 cat is quickly silenced, which speaks worlds about the paramilitary figure's
 fighting prowess.  For it was one of Nybar's scout-cats, expertly trained.
 A tragedy, but there are more cats in the world.  And the cat (Glipkerio)'s
 purpose has been accomplished. 

        Nybar, hearing the yawl, ferally cocks his ears.  Then he
 disappears... Jubjub hears a whisper in his ear.  "You take the ones on the
 left, I'll talk to the fellow who's been following us."  Right now, you are
 probably wondering about Nybar's seeming omniscience, unless you've seen
 Nybar in action.  Well, Nybar simply keeps his eyes and ears open.  And he
 has thousands of eyes and ears, for he never lost contact with the essential
 animals of the world as most humans did when they moved to the cities. 

        As Nybar runs towards the Blue Volvo which Gramsky thought was
 concealed, Jubjub takes a grenade from the back of his van.  He throws it
 towards the bushes which he knows some of the mercs inhabit.  This is
 confirmed by a flying leg.  With this accomplished, Jubjub quickly grabs a
 light-weight Sub-Machine Gun and ducks under his van, knowing that open
 return fire will be the retort to his argument.  He only hopes that the
 waitress doesn't get tagged: she's been dragged into all of this totally
 against her will.  While spraying all the bushes he can with the SMG, he
 rolls behind a tree.  There isn't return fire following him anymore, if
 indeed there ever was.  He crouches behind the tree and attempts to hear if
 anyone is still alive.

        Meanwhile, Nybar has stealthily glided towards the Blue Volvo, and
 now crouches behind it like a cobra ready to strike.  Suddenly, he does,
 slamming the butt of his gun (a beretta) against the window, shattering it.
 He pistol-whips Gramsky in a workmanlike manner, and hops in, pushing
 Gramsky out of the driver's seat and taking the wheel.  After starting the
 car, he runs it into a merc (who was trying to sneak up behind Jubjub) at 90
 miles an hour.

        Jubjub is barely distracted by the merc's virtual explosion under the
 Volvo occurring right next to him.  He's too busy going hand to hand with
 another one of the squad sent against him, incidentally the one that killed
 Glipkerio the Cat.  Jubjub uppercuts him but catches a left jab to the solar
 plexus.  The merc attempts to pull a knife out of his boot while Jubjub is
 struggling for air, but Jubjub kicks him over, and then with a supreme
 effort throws him into the river.

        Nybar stops the Volvo, and (holding Gramsky) hops out.

        "It looks like we finally have a good lead on our competitors for the
 prize: a hostage!" gloats Nybar.

        Jubjub laughs, and pokes Gramsky.  "So, where can we find your
 employer, piece of shit?"

        "The pent... pent..." Gramsky's fedora falls off, and his eyes bug
 off.

        Nybar kicks Gramsky in the back of the knees, dropping him to the
 ground

        "SPIT IT OUT" he demands.

        "THE PENTAGON" Gramsky piteously shouts.

        "Ok, and what is your employer's name?" Jubjub asks with a sneer

        At this point, three things happen in the space of five seconds:

        1. A gunshot rings out, and Gramsky falls dead.
        2. Nybar raises his Beretta and another gunshot is heard.
        3. The wet and dark figure of Glipkerio's killer falls back into the
           river.

        "SHIT!" yells Jubjub.

        "Stay calm," says Nybar "and listen carefully.  We need to get out of
 here.  Okay?"

        Jubjub nods, not wanting to talk and sound foolish.

        "So, lets get the fuck out of here, alright?"

        "Y-yeah..."

        "Meet up back at the apartment, I'll brief my employees there.  It's
 obviously too dangerous to move out in the open, we need information.  Lets
 go."

        Without another word, the brothers hop into their respective vans and
 drive off.  About half an hour later sirens ring out as the police arrive.
 But they find nothing but a mystery.
