        I am such a sad turtle.  I am sad.  Sad turtle!!  I am sooo sad!!!
 I'm the saddest turtle ever born!!!

        I am fucking a rabbit now, everybody, isn't that wild?  I am fucking
 the world now.  FUCK THE WORLD!  Where are the lyrics to Enter Sandman?
 I'm a tremendous fan of emotions laced with subtle references to gay sex.
 HYUK, HYUK!  I FUCKED A BLIND GIRL IN THE EYE!  I AM THE FLESH MAN!

        A dark, dark moment in time... filled with MURDER!!  My right hand
 says GENERATION-X, my left hand says TWELVE YEAR OLD EATING DOG POOP, my
 RAGING COCK (I always refer to that) says "WHOSE MORALITY???/??1/1??".

        I am subversive, dark, and underground.  Please tell me more about
 hip hop.  Christmas RULES!  I totally know what you're saying.  I totally
 identity with the main character of your story.  I am you, man.  U-N-I-T-Y!
 ("Who you callin' a bitch?").  BILLY, BILLY.  I AM CALLING YOU FROM TEXAS.
 I READ THIS CRAZY TEXT FILE ABOUT KIDS KILLING THEMSELVES.  IT'S TOTALLY
 FUCKED UP, MAN.  READ IT!!

        Wish your vibe was still real... I find a great deal of humor in the
 number zero.  What are we becoming?  Maybe I should run for president!
 Sometimes I like to read about technical information, other times I like
 to read about the awful truth.  I mean that as a compliment.

        And how awful it is.  How are you doing, Reid Fleming, my dearest
 friend?  I feel so incredibly close to you.  Same with you, CARRIE CAROLYN.
 The blackness of your putang would swallow me whole.  I mean that as a
 compliment.  Please treat us to another precious 13 years of your glorious
 text files, you fat bastards.  I mean that as a compliment.
