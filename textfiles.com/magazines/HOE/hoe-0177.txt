        Here is a short one that I quickly whipped up after exploring your
 great site. Hopefully in the future I may submit more if my mind comes to
 it. Anyway enjoy!!!

 What's your New Year's resolution? Huh?

 I want to be someone. I don't want to be the person sitting in the dark and
 talking to myself and wondering where everyone is going and what they're
 doing next. I want to be in the "in" crowd. I want to be the talk among the
 people. I'll be different. I promise. I'll change. I'll do whatever it
 takes. I want...I want...

 Yeah sure that's what you said last year and it never happened. You fuckin'
 screwed up. You're not strong enough to push yourself. You're one worthless
 piece of junk. Remember what happened last year when you went to that party
 where all the guys were checking you out. You totally freaked and started
 talking nonsense bullshit. You scared them away. You're crap!

 Don't call me crap! I'm not crap! I can change this time I promise. This
 year I'll be different I swear to God! I'll make it work. You'll see and
 you'll know I'm telling the truth. I want to change this time. I'm not dumb
 you'll see. Besides it takes time and everyone changes don't they? I mean
 I'm not a freak. They're are others who are way worse than I am. I'm just
 unique.

 Unique? You call sitting in a dark room and talking to yourself unique?!
 I'll tell you what unique is. It's being able to touch people with what you
 are and show them the type of person you are. What you're showing to people
 is someone who needs help. You're so pathetic can't you see no one wants to
 be around you?

 What do you mean? Help? I'm just fine the way I am. I talk to myself because
 most of time you're up there asking me a whole lotta questions. The incident
 with the boys at that party was mostly your fault too. I didn't admit it at
 first but now that I realize it, it was all your fault. You kept saying,
 "Go for it! Go for it!" That's why I started yelling. Then again I should
 blame you for making me the way I am today. You're the one who made me turn
 this way. Can't you see it's you who's running me.

 Me?! Ha! You can't even walk right without me telling you how to. I taught
 you everything you know. Without me you're nothing. If you wanna change,
 girl you gotta work with me. Not without me. Without me you'll be nothing.
 You'll screw up and be like shit. You think you know everything there is to
 know huh? Well think again. Who was there talking to you and comforting you
 when you cried, who was there to tell you that there is danger approaching,
 who was the one who patiently walked you through your problems and guide you
 out? Huh? Huh? Me! Me!

 I hate you! All you do is judge me! You never cared for me! You were always
 trying to be this goody-two shoe. You make me look like a fool in front of
 people. You want to take over me. You want me to become you. You know I
 don't want that. I want to be myself. I can learn to walk right without you.
 I can have others to teach me how. I don't need you. I can call someone
 else. Besides...I like being alone. You're the one always wanting to be
 around people. You know people scare me. But this year I'm gonna change.
 Promise. I'll get to know people better. People will see me. I won't yell
 and shout anymore and drive anyone away. I won't have you telling me what
 to do.  Because...you'll be gone.
