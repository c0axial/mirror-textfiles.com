	While thinking about cause and effect, I pictured the universe to
 be a vastly complicated chain of causes and effects done over a
 (relatively) large amount of time, leading up to the present.  Then I
 imagined that time itself could have originally been just a cause, which
 at one point "happened" and gave birth to the possibility of other
 "happenings," which occurred at each moment after the birth of time.

        I realized at that point what the nature of these "happenings"
 were. When time "happened," it was not merely activated; what "happened"
 was that time began to reproduce.  After this happened, time formed a
 (relatively) slow string of moments, which eventually reproduced on
 themselves to form a constant stream of time.  I conjecture that it was
 in the very first of these moments, the second moment in the history of
 time, that matter "happened," or I should say, began to reproduce.

	It is natural, then, for animate matter, when it began existing,
 to exist with the sole purpose of copying itself.  And when there was
 enough of it, animate matter learned to carry on symbiotic relationships
 with other animate matter.  Eventually, entire societies of animate
 matter copied themselves over and over and over again, each time learning
 more how to coexist with other life forms, and then forming societies of
 their own, which copied themselves.  Life continues to expand, infinitely
 increasing the space it occupies, as the space it does not occupy is
 expanding infinitely.

         I insist that this knowledge is essential for any understanding
 of anything.  The preceding facts can be used to draw any just conclusion
 about anything.  For example, it is an undeniable truth that no man or
 thing could ever be held as guilty for any other thing or man.  The
 perceived existence of right and wrong is obviously a common
 misinterpretation of pleasure and pain.  Therefore, a violent criminal is
 no guiltier than a violent disease or a violent snowstorm.  If there were
 any logic in the world, all forms of punishment would come to an end
 immediately.  This is an informed and absolute truth.

	Then again, if there were any logic in the world, all forms of
 logic would come to an end immediately.  But there isn't any, is there?  
 The end.
