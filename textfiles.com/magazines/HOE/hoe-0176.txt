        I have a brother.  He is stupid.  His name is Jay, and he is 20 years
 old but acts like he's 12.  I really can't stand him.  I have a dad.  He's
 not stupid.  He doesn't say much, though, so I don't really know what he
 thinks about things.  I am Southern.  This is an important thing to note
 when reading the remainder of this article, since most people tend to think
 of incest when they think of Southerners.  Now, a little story about me
 embarrassing myself:

        My brother and I have been having little screen-saver wars ever since
 we've been home from school for Christmas break.  It started when he put
 the marquee as, "Lindsey is stupid and ugly and washes her hair in the
 toilet."  Great, real mature, Jay.  So, despite the fact that I *am* mature,
 I changed the screen saver to, "Jay is stupid, and he sucks, and he brushes
 his teeth in dog pee."  Fun fun for everyone!  This has continued for most
 of break.

        Today, my dad was typing at the computer, and after he paused to talk
 to me, he turned around, and the screen saver was up.  "Who did this?" he
 asked, somewhere between amused and angry.  Thinking that I had put up the
 last screen-saver message, I answered, "I did, but Jay started it by putting
 something mean about me first!!" (I told you I'm mature.)  So my dad gives
 me a weird look, then goes back to typing.

        Later, I notice that Jay must have changed the screen saver before my
 dad saw it, because it said, "When I think about Jay, I touch myself."

        MORAL: If you're Southern, don't tell your dad that you were the one
 who wrote the screen saver, because he'll think you're having incestuous
 thoughts about your brother.
