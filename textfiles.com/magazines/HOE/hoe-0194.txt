 From MatCat: hmmm

 From Acidburn: if so, i have a proposition for you.
 From Acidburn: would you like to join "Children of the Cron"?
 From MatCat: hmmm
 From MatCat: if i knew what it wus ;)
 From Acidburn: it's a very Elite hacking group.  we're big all over the east
                coast.
 From MatCat: hmmmmmmmmmm
 From Acidburn: it originally started from a couple of kids messing around.
 From MatCat: who told u i wus a irc hacker?
 From Acidburn: from what i've heard, you're _very_ qualified for the job,
                would you like to join?

 >>>> MatCat is coughing nervously.

 From MatCat: tell me the benifits?
 From Acidburn: it has many perks.
 From Acidburn: warez, sites, cc #'s, barnyard pix, and many connections with
                a lot of 2600 people.
 From MatCat: who is saying what u hearD?
 From MatCat: what if i am not a irc hacker?
 From Acidburn: i cannot reveal the source.  that's a another rule... you are
                 sworn to secrecy.  if you get busted, you don't know who we
                 are... we are like shadows.
 From Acidburn: so you may join, we mostly hack BIG places... such as nasa,
                and schools, we go for numbers and we like lots of shell
                accounts.
 From Acidburn: we have many members working on diverters so we can get into
                whitehouse.gov.
 From MatCat: what if i am NOT a hacker
 From MatCat: what if i dont know the first thing bout hacking
 From Acidburn: i find that hard to believe, but you can still learn and join
 From Acidburn: my source wouldn't lie to me, anyway.  i know you know how to
                hack.  i can even see it from your handle.  that's a hackin'
                handle.
 From MatCat: what if u are captureing everything i say an do
 From Acidburn: listen, this isn't a joke.  do you want the job or not?!
 From Acidburn: the first meeting starts soon... but first i need you to show
                me your skills.
 From MatCat: i do not know how to hack, i know enuff computer science to
              hack if i fooled around.
 From Acidburn: it's a simple task.
 From Acidburn: you wanna join?
 From Acidburn: we mostly hack unix and solaris machines.
 From Acidburn: also, you will get a lot of hardware out of the deal.
 From MatCat: i never got caught doin computer crimes and dont plan on
              getting caught for anything i may or maynot have done
 From MatCat: the truth is i dont know howto hack
 From Acidburn: i have just received a lineman's toolkit to for phreaking for
                no charge.
 From Acidburn: we are like shadows, you will learn to not get caught.
 From MatCat: if i wanted to learn who would teachme?
 From Acidburn: yes i will.
 From MatCat: and how
 From Acidburn: i just need you complete ONE small task to show me your
                worthy of our trust.
 From Acidburn: we have meetings.

              modem
 From MatCat: but

 From MatCat: and hardly much success
 From Acidburn: do so and gimme proof you did it.
