          The Commercial
          --------------

          Lately I've seen red
          I've killed with words
          I've wished and hoped
          and swam through a river of snot
          twice as wide as the mighty
          Mississippi,
          but I wanna know about the commercial
          An Irish guy walking through a field of green
          whistling one of those Irish jigs
          and a woman walks up and says
          "manly yes, but I like it too."
          Then the guy pulls out a huge knife
          and cuts off his first two fingers
          and somehow catches them in what's
          left of his left hand
          and hands them to the woman.
          Did I mention they are both dressed in green?
          Then they both sing this song together
          "Are you icky, are you sticky, are you hot as anything
          hey cut off two of your fingers and stab yourself in the eye!"
          then he stabs himself in the eye and hands her the knife
          and she stabs herself in the eye okay, okay.
          So what about that?
          Then they join arms and do this Irish folk dance
          while taking turns dismembering each other
          this was a commerical for deoderant I think
          or soap or somthing
          now all the body parts are lying in a heap
          but the heads are still singing
          "Are you icky, are you sticky, are you hot as anything
          hey get away from summer and cut off all your limbs!"
          Then all the body parts start hoppin' and boppin' around
          like little bunny rats
          then they jump in the mouths of the singing heads
          but then they just slip right out of the severed necks
          and keep boppin' about
          it's very beautiful music that is playing
          there's and Irish flute and a mandolin I think
          and the background singers sound just like the Clancy Brothers
          it's really a wonderful comercial
          spectacular
          it must of cost a fortune to make
          the kind of commercial you would see during a Super Bowl maybe
          where the advertising time cost a million dollars
          a half a minute
          wow imagine that
          a million dollars for half a minute
          anyway by the end it looks like the two of them have been
          a juicer or a food processor or a blender or somthing
          it's just a pink puraid of blood bone and flesh in a big bucket
          but it's still singing somehow
          are you icky, are you sticky, are you hot as anything
          hey blend yourself, proccess yourself
          become a glass of animal juice
          haven't you had enough of fruit juices and vegtable juices
          next time company comes over offer them a cool refreshing glass
          of youself
          give 'em yourself
          stop being such a selfish piece of snot, okay?
          okay, okay.
          and now back to our program


          Socks
          -----

          Look at all my socks
          Oh so many, many socks
          I can't even believe it
          can you imagine how they make so many socks
          I can't even begin to count them all
          let alone think about wearing them
          so many socks
          how did I get so many
          where did they come from
          HEY
          why do I have so many socks

          I'm innovated
          I can't
          no I'm sorry
          this won't do
          I cannot have this
          this is too many
          I cannot have this many socks
          this will not do
          please take some of these socks
          many away at once
          Ah yes thank you
          this is much more managable
          this is quite good
          this is quite precisley the cleanest essentially right number
          I am extremely pleased



          Love Is
          -------

          Love is beautiful
          Like birds that sing
          Love is not ugly
          like rats in a puddle of vomit
              
          Love is beautiful
          Like the sunshine
          and the dancing wind
          Love is not ugly
          like pus
          and lice
          and tabacco snot

          Love is beautiful
          Like all the little animals
          in a forest full of green
          that smells like pine and wonder
          Love is not invisible brain control
          and pain
          and malicious intent
          and lying all the time
          although it can be all of these things
          and more

          Love is a many splendored thing
          It is not a shitload of slaughtered pigs
          rotting and festering
          in the bleeding desert
          Love is what love is
          and Love is not
          what love is not


          What If
          -------

          One day
          what if one day
          what if I say
          I wish I was a tree
          and then suddenly I was a tree
          then could I wish myself back
          No trees can't wish

          What if I wished I was a wishing tree
          A tree that could wish
          What if I wished I was a toilet bowl
          and then I was one
          and the wind changed
          and I stayed that way

          Or what If I wished I was a toilet bowl
          and suddently I was a tree
          would I be able to say
          hey I wanted to be a toilet bowl
          not a tree
          no I wouldn't be able to say that
          because trees can't talk
          they don't have any mouths
          I would have to have the foresight to say
          I wish I was a toilet
          but If I changed into a tree instead
          I wish to be a tree with a mouth
          and can wish to change back into
          a human being
          because I only ever want
          to be a toilet
          or a tree
          for a very great period of time
              
          I guess
          This is the exact reason
          why they always say
          you should be very careful
          what you wish for




          The Dishwasher
          --------------

          He looked late 30s maybe mid-30
          tall maybe 6 feet
          I saw him I the guatamalan clothing place
          He was thin, and hungry
          they sold jewlry there I noticed some bracelets
          with sanscript writing on them
          I think the woman behind the counter looked
          like she was Indian
          not American-Indian,
          Indian-Indian
          she had a weird smile
          on her face as I walked in
          I saw looking at the bracelets
          he said he was looking for work
          he said I applied for work
          as a dishwasher
          as a dishwasher
          as a dishwasher
          over at the hotel, I'll find out tommmorow
          but if they don't there are 6 other places looking
          for dishwashers

          she's smiling at him and I'm realizing
          now hours later
          she didn't know him, he said "see ya" and leaves
          and I'm still looking at stuff
          she looks real nervous.
          she's not Indian
          too light skinned, maybe, I don't know but she
          didn't speak english very well so he says "see ya"
          and I'm looking at stuff and I'm realizing now,
          hours later, she didn't know him
          she was just going along with him and he
          obvisouly wasn't a customer either
          cause he said he was looking for work
          he applied for work as a dishwasher
          as a dishwasher
          as a dishwasher
          they don't make alot of money
          somthing was going on
          he was desperate
          maybe he went in there to try to sell somthing
          maybe he was trying to distract her so he could
          take somthing.

          He was thin, and hungry and desperate
          I mean he obvisouly wasn't a customer but
          I didn't figure it out till later after
          the movie I'm walking back and I'm playing the
          movie back in my head
          I'm playing the scene back in my head in the
          store, he looked late 30s maybe mid 30s
          maybe 6 feet in the guantamalan clothing place
          they sold bracelets with sanscript writing on them
          the woman behind the counter looked light skinned,
          she didn't speak english very well
          I should of done somthing
          I should of realized
          I should of paid attention
          I should of been awake
          he told her he was looking for work
          as a dishwasher
          as a dishwasher
          a dishwaher

          I didn't really get a good look at him
          he looked like a dishwasher
          I belived him
          but now I think he was lying
          I think he took somthing
          she seemed real nervous
          I should of done somthing
          I didn't know
          I wish I had done somthing
          I didn't know
          is she all right?
          do you think he...
          did she identify him?
          if she's dead now how did she get my name
          I don't know any dishwshers
          no I never was in vietnam
          she is definetally not vietnamese
          is she dead
          do you think he
          he looked late 30s
          I think he stole somthing
          do you think he killed her

          He looked late 30s
          maybe mid 30s
          tall, maybe 6 feet
          I saw him in the guatamalan clothing place
          he was thin and hungry
          they sold jewlery there too
          I noticed some bracelets there with sanscript
          writing on them
          the woman behind the counter looked like she
          Indian
          not American-Indian
          but Indian-Indian
          she had a weird smile on her face as I walked in
          I was looking at the bracelets
          he said he was looking for work
          he said
          I applied for work
          as a dishwasher
          as a dishwasher
          a dishwasher!
