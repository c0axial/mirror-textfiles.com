        When dating services were first introduced quite some time ago, no
 one thought that it would lead to such things as telephone dating systems,
 or internet dating services.  The last page of a local tabloid would 
 suddenly become the domain of "Jenny's Make a New Friend Club", instead of
 the regular mail-order vitamins page.  The establishment of such
 television shows such as 'Love Connection' and 'The Dating Game' had also
 helped North America accept the idea of blind dating.  

        However, it was a much bigger task to get onto a personals page.
 One had to send a letter with their profile to the service, and wait
 months to actually get their ad posted.  Plus, getting on the Dating Game
 was nearly impossible.  But, with the convenience of the internet, all
 that has changed. One can log onto the internet, go to an internet dating
 site, and have a profile posted within five minutes of being logged on.
 Anyone.

        The Dating Game recruited contestants who were fairly decent, both
 in mind and body.  Although every dating gimmick has its losers, these 
 people were at least tolerable, to an extent.  People who sent their ads 
 to personals in magazines and what not, were much more desperate, but were
 able enough to send their letters in.  Internet dating services are the
 melting pot of anyone who is lacking in sex or love.  Sure, their excuse
 is they haven't got any time for singles bars or meeting people, but when
 it comes down to it, these are the most desperate people on earth, which
 leads to the point of this t-file: Internet dating services will slowly
 lead to the end of the world.

        Research claims that in twenty years, internet dating services will
 be the number one method of meeting people, in North America, Europe and
 Asia.  80% of the people using these services are looking for discreet
 affairs during their lunch hour.  The other 20% are looking for either
 marriage, or just a new friend, which has a .7% success rate.  An
 estimated 45% of the people looking for discreet sex actually get it.
 The rest just give up on the idea of getting any, ever.  

        The folks who do wind up fucking are pretty much looking for
 something without strings.  They aren't looking to have children with
 their one-night stands.  If the majority of these people now are not
 looking to settle down, and decide to just keep on fucking until they die,
 then the future is extremely dim.  If the theory that everyone will be
 using internet dating as their key to meeting people in twenty years is
 true, and if 80% of them are still looking for discreet affairs, the birth
 rate in North America, Europe and Asia will drop enormously.  This will
 result in a population falling in the age range of 50+, having one night
 stands, and because of internet dating services, there will be no children
 left by the time these services have completely taken over.  And when
 internet dating services do take over these three places, the entire world
 will be connected by then, slowly ensuring the extinction of the human
 race as we know it.

        Amazingly enough, a good number of people managed to meet people in
 real life, for say, the last millenium.  Why can't they now?  Laziness.

        The under-developped countries will be the last ones laughing.
