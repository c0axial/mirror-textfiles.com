        Excuse me for being not all that excited that Gonzaga (a university
 in Spokane.) is doing well in basketball/NCAA or whatever the hell it is.
 I'm not a big fan of watching sports, I see absolutely no point in watching
 a sport on TV. Playing a sport is different, I have no qualms when it
 comes to playing sports as I love billiards (which really isn't a very
 invigorating sport when you think about it, but, a sport none the less.)
 As I sit in the passenger side of my best friend Josh's car (I really need
 to get a job and work on that license.)  I notice all of these signs that
 say "Go Zags".

        Now, call me logical or really asinine but to me that just seems so
 downright stupid.  Why?  Simple, they aren't here, they can't see the damn
 signs and we're just going to throw them away after their either win or
 lose, what a waste of good fucking paper I could use for school reports
 and essays;  I'm a environmentalist kind of person, in a non fanatical
 way. ...Signs that say "Go Zags" it just astounds me, am I the only one in
 this entire city not tickled pink by the prospect of them winning a
 tournament?

        I digress, when/if I do watch sports on television (my dad watches
 them all the time so I'm forced to listen to them at the most {like right
 now, he's watching the game while I type my incessant bitching on the
 computer}, I find myself that if I am forced to listem to them long enough
 or watch the last 15 minutes I actually start to get into them, and I don't
 like that.  It's a compromisation of my values, that value being, watching
 sports is stupid.  If I've only been listening to the game I find myself
 asking questions regarding it such as "What's the score?" and "Who's
 leading?"  AUGH I hate it, I hates it forever (Subtle Tolkien reference.)

        I'm not cheering for Gonzaga, though, and I never will.  I was
 listening to Joe Satriani 'Crystal Planet' Goddamnit, before my friggin'
 dad came down and decided to turn off my life giving music and watch that
 fucking game.  I already feel musically deprived, I'll have to go to my
 room or switch off the laptop and exchange the disk drive for the cd-rom. 
 (which I kind of don't want to do right now, but probably will end up
 doing.)  No, now that I think of it, I need to keep the disk drive in, I
 need to make a powerpoint presentation on the cons of having prayer and
 religion in school.  I have so much fucking homework, a college consultant
 making me sign a contract making me study 20 hours a week for the SAT's
 (which brings up another point I would like to talk about.. Sat scores.
 For some warped reason my college consultant thinks that your GPA
 determines your grade average, let me just say that the assumption that a
 3.0 student will be in the range of a 1100 score is pure bull fucking
 shit. What about the students who have the intelligence, just not the
 drive? {like me}  Oh well I can complain about that later.) and the
 pressure is building to go to a college on the west coast but I want to get
 as far away from Washington as possible and go to the east coast.  Even the
 news has succumbed to the lame 'Gonzaga' fever that has gripped the city.
 The point being of this whole thing being:

        - Watching Sports is really stupid, in my opinion.

        - Gonzaga sucks, they made my dad turn off my music, and I'm not
          interested in going to my room.

        - Joe Satriani is a damn good guitarist.

        - I'm not concerned about Gonzaga, for all I care they can lose
          this day.

        - Making stupid sign's that say "Go Zags" to put on your windows is
          a waste  of paper.
