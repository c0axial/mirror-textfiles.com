        once apon a time there was alittle girl called mel.  mel was very
 evil and bad!  mel is actually a slug and he was madly in love with his
 girlfriend but alas, she was a horse and they didn't know how to make
 this work.

        but she acted evil and killed everything good anyway because she
 was a bad thing ond day she met an evil man, a ferocious man.  she was
 afraid but had to defend herself because her slug friend was too weak
 despite his claims to have once saved the world.

        but the evil man finaly left and she was so happy that she decided
 to take mel out to celebrate at her favorite restaurant: "the salt lick".
 bad idea for her poor friend mel.

        now mel is going to die because she is evil and bad and happiness
 is evil, too.  so mel ran and ran untill she found a small black box which
 she crushed and then ran home.  mel narroly escaped disolving at the salt
 lick and his girlfriend felt so bad that she ran and hid in a black box
 she happened to find.  suddenly the walls caved in and she was crushed.
 so sad so very sad

        but she was so incredibly evil that her soul rose from the ruins
 and took over a poor onlookers poor, defenseless body.  the body of the
 person was soon wrecked and twisted and on tis way to japan, in a small
 cramped box.

        THE END.

        eat a banana.
