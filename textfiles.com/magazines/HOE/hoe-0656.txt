        Alcohol has a depressing effect on the central nervous system.  If
 taken in large enough quantities it will make one go to sleep and
 eventually die.  This is obviously bad for driving, but long before these
 things happen the effects will start to affect driving ability.  Alcohol
 makes the pupils respond slower to sudden light.  This makes headlights
 more likely to blind a drunk driver and cause a crash.  Alcohol also
 impairs judgement ("Going 90 isn't that dangerous"), lowers coordination
 and  slows reflexes.  All of these abilities are absolutely essential on
 the road.  Another effect alcohol has on driving is that it makes people
 underestimate how fast they are going.  A One oz. shot of 80 proof hard
 liquor has the same amount of alcohol in it as a 5 oz. glass of wine and a
 12 oz. can of beer.  This is considered one drink.  Only one drink will
 impair driving ability.  Even below the legal limit your risk of having an
 accident can still be raised by 100%.  For each drink you have you must
 wait one hour before you can drive.  Contrary to myth, there is no way to
 sober yourself up, not even coffee, cold showers or exercise will help.
 If you have been drinking and doing other drugs it is probably best to wait
 until you've had a night's sleep to drive.

        When mixed with other drugs, alcohol can be even more deadly on the
 road.  When mixed with prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines (Valium,
 Xanax), and barbituates (Seconal) the negative effects of alcohol on
 driving are greatly potentiated.  Also the chance of falling asleep at the
 wheel is very high.  This would almost always cause some sort of collision.
 When mixed with many over the counter drugs (Nyquil, Robitussin, etc) the
 same things (to a lesser degree) happen.  When alcohol is mixed with
 prescription and illegal uppers (amphetamines) it creates the illusion that
 the alcohol is not making any negative impact on the users driving.  This
 is not true, and in fact the amphetamines could make decision making skills
 even worse.  When mixed with marijuana the sedating aspects of alcohol are
 potentiated which leads to a greater risk of falling asleep at the wheel.
 Hallucinogens mixed with alcohol have all the effects of alcohol plus
 hallucinations which can easily distract a driver, especially a driver who
 has all ready been drinking.

        In Delaware you can be charged with DWI ("driving while
 intoxicated") if you drive with a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) of
 .05% or above.  It takes about two drinks for the average person to reach
 this level.  At this level the you are almost twice as likely to get into
 an accident.  At .10% you can be charged with DUI ("driving under the
 influence").  At this level your risk of having an accident is raised by
 six times.  For your first DUI offense you can get three months in prison
 (a year if you refuse to take a chemical test), a year for the second
 (eighteen months if you refuse the test), and eighteen months for three or
 more offenses (two years if you refuse three or more times).  You can
 enroll in a first offender's program which will give you a lighter
 sentence. Being convicted of DUI will also raise your insurance and make it
 a lot harder to get a job.  Considering all these things is it worth it to
 drive drunk/on drugs?
