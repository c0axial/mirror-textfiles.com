        The clock ticks, the phone rings, then my fucking cell phone.  Then
 my ICQ goes "uh-oh" again and AGAIN.  Dammit people just leave me alone. 

        My mom has called me about five times today.  She wants to know why
 she got a $78 phone bill and a letter from my college wondering why I
 haven't gone to class yet.  Took them long enough to miss me, but that's
 beside the point.

        My boss has called a few times this week.  She wants to know why I
 haven't gone to work in about two weeks.  I told her I didn't know.  That
 seems to be my answer for everything lately.  "I don't know."  It puts
 people off long enough to think of an excuse............

        My roommates have been on my ass about the up-coming rent due.  They
 seem to think that if they see me and don't remind me, I'll forget.  As if I
 could forget that I have about $20 and I owe more than three different
 people at least that much.  Please people, just fucking leave me alone and
 let me go insane.  Maybe then I won't have to pay rent at the mental
 hospital.

        Stop laughing, my mom actually suggested that tonight.  As if I don't
 have enough things to worry about, she is threatening to commit me.

        At least I got laid today.
