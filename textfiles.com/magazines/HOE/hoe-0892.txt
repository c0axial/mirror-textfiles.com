	A small reflection hinted at the early morning sun off of Ralph's
 erect penis.  Unknown to Ralph, this was the five hundreth time he had
 masturbated in his lifetime.  Five minutes later, he was finished.  A faint
 knock on the door and the muffled voice of his father reminded him that he
 was going to be late for the bus. 

	Ralph did not often have a problem of being late for the bus.  He
 rarely masturbated in the morning before school.  He knew that if he hadn't
 done it this morning, he would probably end up doing it in the bathroom
 during class.  It was one of those mornings.  He had another dream about
 her.  Don't worry, this isnt a mushy love story, just bear with me.  Her
 name is Sarah.  The dream he had was unlike any of the others.  It consisted
 of only her face blurred slightly.  It did not have a neck attached, which,
 at first sight, nearly made Ralph ralph, but he soon realized the beauty in
 it.

	Another knock and the sound of the doorknob turning made Ralph snap
 back from his daydream and dart across his room, deftly placing his hand
 across the opening door and the frame, preventing the door from opening.
 His other hand attempted to hold onto the towel drenched in semen, and
 managed only to spread a moderate amoung on his leg.  

	"I'm coming," Ralph said nervously, "just give me a minute."

	"The bus is going to be here any minute."  His mother had that tone
 in her voice that she alway had when telling Ralph to hurry up.  Ralph knew
 very well that the bus still had at least 5 minutes before it reached his
 house.  He had an excellent memory and knew approximately when the bus came
 in the morning.  He planned on this when he made his decision to masturbate,
 however he did not plan on daydreaming.  

	Feverishly attempting to find a dry spot on his towel, ralph cleaned
 himself off and spent the next minute deciding which of his black t-shirts
 were clean.  He had worn one of them earlier in the week, but did not know
 which one, as his 'clean' and 'dirty' pile often intermixed.  He picked the
 one that was on the bottom and grabbed his pitch black levis to accompany
 it.  Finding both of this black shoes (can you see a pattern here?), he
 walked out to his livingroom to put them on.  

	Ralph's family was not poor.  In fact, they were considerably better
 off than they were only 2 years earlier.  No longer did he have to rely on
 second hand clothes from his brother, who was nearly a decade older.  He
 could now actually have some of his own.  He did not have the pleasure of
 sitting on a torn green metal bondage chair to sit on next to the wood
 fireplace, he could now sit on the vent of their centrail air system.  Ralph
 remembered the long cold nights during which he would sleep next to the
 fireplace just to keep warm.  On a related note, Ralph's parents sold
 Ralph's computer for a cord of firewood.  Ralph cried that night, but they
 were warm tears.

        Ralph walked out of the front door calmly as the large yellow bus
 pulled up omniously to his driveway.  As usual, the mexican children who
 lived in the house next to his were already out waiting, chattering among
 themselves.  One of the children was holding a boombox, the faint sounds of
 Kris Kross eminating from it.  Ralph commonly waited inside for the last
 moment before walking outside.  He had made the mistake of going outside to
 wait once, and had to sit there for an agonizingly long 2 minutes listening
 to the kids speak spanish and laugh giddly.

	Ralph was the last one onto the bus, having to wait for the
 especially obese mexican girl to climb the stairs that seemed just slightly
 too steep for her stubby legs.  Any erotic sensations Ralph was having
 earlier were quickly quelled as he watched this disgusting display of
 humanity.  Ralph wondered how, if her parents were this obese, were they
 ever able to reproduce, much less push something like her out.  Ralph sighed
 as a bead of sweat appeared on the fat bean.  

        As he finally reached the top of the stairs, the doors closed and
 wave of silence spread over the bus.  The intense feeling of fear swept over
 Ralph as he walked forward in a daze.  He looked from seat to seat, looking
 for an opening, praying to the god he didnt believe in that there would be a
 seat that was empty.  He hated this part of his morning with a passion.  If
 it wasn't 8 miles, he would walk to school.  

	He looked left, seeing the two girls who were from the dairy down
 the road, both looking at him smugly, convinced in their own superiority. 
 Ralph wondered how this could be, he was a good five years older than them. 
 When there is that much of an age difference, there is no question of
 superiority.  But nonetheless, they looked on his as if he was shit, in
 their infitile minds, wondering how he could be so pathetic and continue
 living.

	He looked right, seeing the innocent 2nd grader who was partially
 deaf and was forced to wear hering aids.  In his heart, Ralph felt for this
 kid, as he must have a hard time being accepted.  He must have even a more
 difficult time than Ralph making friends.  The hearing aid boy was sitting
 smiling and talking to two kids sitting next to him, clutching his lunch bag
 as if it contained his last meal.  He did not seem to have a care in the
 world.  Ralph wished he could be like that again, but as he thought about
 it, wondered if he ever really was like that.  It was all a blur.

	Looking further back Ralph noticed the sixth seat from the back on
 the right side was open.  Ralph silently appreciated the fact that his house
 was early enough on the route that there were still seats available when he
 got on the bus.  He quickly sat in it, and with amazing agility and speed,
 as if he had practiced the move most of his life, sunk down in it so that he
 would be invisible to anybody behind him.  More importantly, he would be
 protected from any 'random' flying objects.  

	He heard Brad, the buck toothed bully who was in a grade higher than
 him.  Ralph never thought of him as a bully, but more, as an enemy.  He was
 the third person Ralph hated in his life.  Hate was a feeling Ralph would
 know very little of throughout his lifetime.  Whether this is a blessing or
 a curse is debateable.  Brad was bragging about his goat farm, as usual. 
 Ralph grinned slightly as he considered Brad fucking his goats and being a
 despicable person.  Ralph took comfort in knowing that if other people were
 as perverted as he, that he would never know.  He oculd just assume they
 were and feel better about himself.

	Growing up in the country, Ralph was left to entertain himself
 often.  Having the libido of a College sophomore, Ralph often 'experimented'
 with anything he could lay his hands on.  From the horse's nose to his dog's
 mouth, Ralph stuck his dick wherever he could.  It is amazing that it never
 got bitten or chopped off.  It is also amazing that it hadn't dropped off as
 well.  

        Ralph found himself staring at a hole in the cloth in the seat in
 front of him.  The hole was big enough for his finger, so he put his finger
 in it.  He felt around inside the seat for a while, then stroked his finger
 around the hole playfully.  He looked at the strings of fabric jutting out
 of the hole, wondering how the string intertwined within, wondering if it
 would give him a paper cut if he ran his finger across it at the right
 angle.  Ralph wondered if there was some way he could hide on the bus, so
 that after everyone got off, he could experiment with the hole.  His mind
 played with this idea for the duration of the trip.

	As usual, Ralph was the last one off the bus.  He never cared about
 being last, it meant that nobody was behind him in the line to get off.  He
 walked into school, taking the back way; he would see few people going this
 way, even though it was further away from his locker.  
         The familiar stench of the school hallways greeted him as he stepped
 inside.  The low roar of students talking quickly followed the stench,
 offending his thoughts as much as his ears.  He walked downstairs, the trip
 he took every day, yet it seemed it was no easier than the first.  He walked
 past the weight room, hearing the blaring music from inside.  They were
 playing a song by Pearl Jam.  He liked the song himself, and, would
 compliment the person who chose it that morning.  He then wondered what that
 person would say back to him.  If that person would just think Ralph was
 trying to be cool and saying he liked rock music.  Ralph walked on, looking
 at the ventilation shafts in the ceiling, admiring the beauty in them.

	Ralph walked up to his locker and dialed in his combination, looking
 around him between numbers to make sure nobody was watching.  He opened it
 briskly and threw his backpack inside.  He knew that the backpack would not
 take much more of this, and he would have to get another one.  He despised
 getting new things, he despised anything that would be a change.  He grabbed
 his first and second hour books and headed off to his first class.  Ralph
 did not have an opinion about the day, in fact, he wasn't thinking about
 anything at the moment.  He was pretty much running off of fear.

	Ralph sat down and stared at his desk.  He continued to stare at his
 desk for the next 5 and a half minutes.  He was doodling on his notebook, a
 pattern he once saw his brother draw nearly 7 years ago.  he thought that
 pattern was neat, and had always wanted to draw something cool like that. 
 As a result he had doodles this same pattern on his notebooks for the past
 three years.  They all were pretty much the same, collections of polygons
 intertwined with eah other, not signifying anything.  He thought being
 random and having random art was cool.  He was awaiting the day someone
 would compliment him on his art, like he complimented his brother.

	The majority of his morning was spent doodling on his notebook.
 Ralph looked at his notebook and saw a penis.  He quickly tried to cover up
 the shape which somewhat resembled a penis, but only succeeded it in looking
 like a pair of breasts.  He drew a few more lines and saw in his chaos a
 vagina.  Sweat started to form on Ralph's brow as he nervously tried to
 scribble some sort of nothingness into his erotic patterns.  He looked
 around wondering if someone would turn and see his sick and perverted
 drawings, and scream out 'Ralph is a pervert!' or something equivelant. 

	As the bell rang to go to his next class, Ralph breathed a sigh of
 relief and grabbed his books, making sure to cover the side of his notebook
 he was doodling on with another book.  He looked around one more time to
 make sure nobody was watching him and filed out the door behind all the
 other students.  His next class was with Sarah, and he walked straight
 there, fearing just to look at any of the leering faces in the hallway.

        Looking around, Ralph walked in the classroom, seeing a student
 from the previous hour being helped.  He reflected on the fact that he never
 needed help; he was always the ideal student.  He remembered most of the
 drivel that was taught long enough to pass a test given on it later. 
 Ralph's biggest challenge in school was never the schoolwork, but rather
 surviving each day.  He pondered how these people could survive being so
 stupid.  They were all morons, with a few exceptions.  He considered the
 exceptions his friends, although they were really nothing more than people
 who would actually talk to him for more than five minutes.

        Ralph never really had a concept of what a friend truly was.  In all
 his past years, he rarely had a friend who would chat with him over lunch,
 much less do anything with him outside of school.  Ralph's social life ended
 with the bell that ended each day at school.  Ralph had never known anything
 better, and he was generally a happy person.  Except for the occasional
 episodes of intense depression when he felt like hanging himself with a
 piece of dental floss.

	He walked back to his usual seat, being the first in the classroom
 as usual.  All of the other students preferred to sit outside in the hallway
 and talk to their friends.  Being the first in the class always gave Ralph
 time to think and it always kept anyone from taking the seat he claimed as
 his own.  

        Sarah walked in the classroom, and Ralph couldn't help but keep his
 eyes off her.  He looked at her cancerous lips and drooled.  As the drool
 found its way from Ralph's chin to the top of his desk, he snapped out of it
 and wiped it up with his hand, and then dispensed of it on the side of his
 shirt.  She sat in the seat next to him, and Ralph's heart skipped a beat.

        He stared straight ahead at the chalkboard, pretending not to notice
 her.  He always did that, every morning.  He would not even turn and smile. 
 Had he turned and smiled, he probably would have shit his pants in utter
 fear.  In fact, he did not say one word to her throughout the entire class. 
 Ralph did not know any other way.

	Three hours passed.  The lunch bell rang.  Our hero Ralph walked
 outside to the parking lot, on his usual way to the school cafeteria.  Two
 of the stoners in school called him over.  Ralph once made the fatal mistake
 of lending one of these people money for pot.  This made him a very valuable
 friend ever since.  They invited Ralph to lunch, which mainly consisted of
 seeing how much weed you could smoke in thirty minutes.  Deciding being
 trapped in a smoke filled car with four people was better compared to a
 cafeteria with four hundredm he joined them.  

	As usual, Ralph sat in the back, calmly looking around as they drove
 to their secluded spot right outside of town.  Ralph looked up at Cliff, who
 was driving.  Cliff had long blond hair which was tied up behind his head in
 true hippie fashion.  His eyes jutted out of his head, providing much
 speculation on what drove him to this particular recreation.  The truth was,
 he was just too stupid to do anything else.

	Riding shotgun was Darren.  Darren was as suave as he was cool.  He
 had the same stature as Ralph, and was about as handsome.  Ralph knew this,
 but for some reason, he could never quite figure out why Darren was so much
 more sociable than he.  Ralph pondered if one day he could possibly learn
 how to treat people with such easy and be able to manipulate them as easily
 later in life.

	Next to Ralph sat Chris.  Chris, much like Cliff, was pretty much
 too stupid to make a decision other than the one he had.  Chris grinned a
 lot, and generally made stupid comments.  Chris, unlike Cliff or Darren,
 knew precisely how stupid he was, and accepted it.

	They pulled up to their spot, and all got out of the car.  Cliff
 ran to the edge of the hill and screamed, obviously rejoicing in the fact
 that he was about to get stoned.  Darren calmly packed his pipe while Chris
 looked on anxiously, awaiting the delivery of promised goods.  Ralph sat and
 watched as Darren preformed his act, calmly memorizing each move in case
 Ralph was asked to do it later.

	Twenty minutes passed.

	As Ralph walked across the parking lot, the bell rang which
 signified he was late for his next class.  Ralph didn't care.  He walked
 along, his stride slightly different because of the cramped erection he had. 
 He could feel the tip of his cock rubbing against his zipper, and wondered
 why it did not hurt as much as he thought it would.  He wondered if he was
 leaving and pre-cum on it, and if he would be able to unzip his pants later.

        He swiftly reached down inside his pants, grabbed his cock, and
 repositioned it so it wouldnt be as noticeable.  Intense waves of pleasure
 shot up his spine as he ejaculated.  He did not even break stride as he went
 straight for the bathroom.

	Inspecting the damage, he reached for a towel and tried to wipe off
 some of the semen that soaked the bottom of his shirt.  He suceeded only in
 spreading it.  Ralph tucked his shirt in, decided it was not noticeable, and
 went to his next class.

	Sitting listening to his English teach mumble on about the correct
 usage of "you're", Ralph wondered if anyone noticed the faint smell of dried
 semen coming from his shirt.  He looked around nervously, seeing most
 everyone paying attention to the lecture.  Despite that fact, he continued
 to look around.  Almost feeling their eyes upon him, he started trembling. 
 He continued to tremble for the rest of the afternoon.

        Ralph rode the bus home, as usual hiding deep within his seat.  He
 occasionally  got up and looked around, and seeing nothing of interest, went
 back to slouching down and staring out the windows at the passing livestock. 
 He always wondered what a cow's rectum would feel like to his cock.  He
 planned to find out as soon as he could.  Maybe he could sneak out that
 night to go over to his neighbor's field....
