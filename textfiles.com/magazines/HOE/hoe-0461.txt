        In an effort to raise money for starving children in trailer parks
 of lower Delaware, HOE E'zine has decided that now you, the fan, can
 order your very own personalized issue of HOE!

        I know this sounds exciting.  Just think... one of the most
 classic and dynamic e'zines of all time can have an issue which has to
 do with YOU!

        Each personalized issue of HOE is guaranteed to be over 100 lines
 long (not counting headers & footers, don't worry).  These special issues
 will also be authored by none other than Kaia!  That's right, the former
 DTO writer and musical genius will be writing a wonderful HOE issue all
 about YOU!

        Just to give you a taste, here's are two examples of what you will
 receive when you purchace a personalized issue of HOE!

 !!========================================================================!!

 "Kreids and Whey"
 by Kaia

	Feel the difference!  Kreid Hand Towels are hand knitted by real
 grandmothers in genuine rocking chairs using Kreidex, the virtually
 indestructible yet highly absorbent space-age material also used by
 astronauts on the space shuttle Endeavor.  This breakthrough product was
 developed by a team of medical researchers after hours of painstaking
 research conducted underwater, on shrooms, and on camera.  The four
 beautifully embroidered decorative series include:  "Hearts and Stars,"
 "Kittens," "Things Yo' Momm Don't Approve of," "The Transitive Structure
 of Events in Japanese," "The Minimize Function," and "Broken Hearts."
 One design is sure to fit every home...

 "G0ff-choo"
 by Kaia

	Is that a fun game, slapping the table?  Although many
 world-class athletes would say, "Hell, no!", g0ff is the local superstar
 who strongly advocates this new craze in after-school activities.  
	"Rumour has it that my cat Anna, who loves Ani diFranco, choked on
 a Kreid towel and I had to grab her by the tail and slam her against the
 kitchen counter to extricate the linen.  I would like to stress that this
 is only a rumour!"
	But who is inclined to believe that this wicked mastermind can 
 really differentiate between fact and fantasy, especially when he was
 recently spotted slapping the kitchen table, pummeling the altar of his
 Catholic Church with a wacky noodle, and pounding the Grimace-shaped
 table at a McDonalds playland with a jackhammer... 

 !!========================================================================!!

        Let's review:  a special, personalized issue of HOE all about you,
 written by the infamous Kaia, set to appear as its own regular HOE
 release.   Now, what would you expect to pay for this amazing offer?

	$29.99?  $385.99?

        Well, since every day is the season of giving here at HOE, this
 special offer is only _2 dollars_.  I don't think you can ask for
 anything more.

                                INSTRUCTIONS:
                                ============

        The cost is $2.00.  Send a check, money order, or cash (please
 hide your cash so greedy mailmen will not steal your money) payable to:

                                Kaia Wong
                                302 Ray Street C
				Newark, DE 19717

	It would also be a good idea to send an email to mogel@dto.net,
 letting me know that you purchased an issue, and I will ensure it gets
 to you.  Kaia is completely trustworthy (really!) and will not steal any
 of your money without writing an issue.

        This offer expires on May 25, 1999, when Kaia escapes university
 dorms forever.  Now go fill out that Official HOE Order Form.  Wear
