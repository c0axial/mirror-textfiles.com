        Dear Mr. Arnold Klein, 

        I find it exceedingly difficult to believe that the paper I
 handed in on May 2nd, 1997, for your Dramatic Poetry/Poetic Drama class,
 was worthy of a mere C+.  In fact, as I write this letter, I find myself
 confused and befuddled as to the possible reasons I received such a low
 letter grade.

        To refresh your memory: The paper ran seventeen pages in length
 and addressed the issue of disguise and assumed identity in both The
 Revenger's Tragedy and Ben Jonson's The Alchemist.

        I chose these two plays because I felt they were the two in the
 class that I had learned the most from, and as things tend to work out,
 they also happened to be the ones I enjoyed seemed to me a good one.
 Disguise and assumed identity can be found in most plays from the
 Elizabethan and Jacobean era, but these two plays seemed to be making a
 comment about the nature of disguise and its effects on those it dupes,
 rather than simply being a plot device to move along the story.  The two
 plays, in my mind, worked well together in terms of comparison, due to
 their darkly comical natures.

        As to the paper itself, I cannot express my shock and extreme
 dismay as my effort of over a fortnight was returned to me and I found a
 C+ loosely slapped on its back.  I cannot further express the depths of
 repulsion I felt when gazing upon your final critical comments, which
 can be summed up, and in fact were summed up, as, "Pretty Literal." I
 might possibly be able to stomach the poor grade if I felt that you had
 given me some sort of justification for it, other than simply doling out
 a meager comment.  But, of course, perhaps meager papers with meager
 grades require meager comments.

        As I am not by any means a teacher myself nor remotely qualified
 to judge papers accordingly, it seems a strange thing to me that I must
 produce this letter.  Obviously, I am not nearly qualified as you are for
 such things, yet I can not help but feel that a C+ was an unjust grade.
 The amount of time and effort, (not to mention the countless hours of
 contemplation), that I witnessed myself put into this paper only spurs
 me on in my indignation.

        You may remember that only one other student besides myself
 managed to meet the due date for the paper.  The grade of a C+ cannot but
 force me to question why I even put an effort into this paper.  I now feel
 that even if I had put no effort into the paper, I would probably have
 received the same letter grade.  Perhaps a C+ is all one such as myself
 should aspire to.

        I have become seriously concerned as to the outcome of my grade.
 The paper will have a major impact.  Prior to receiving the C+, I assumed
 that I would do fine, as I had attended all the classes and read all the
 material when so prompted.  The C+, however, puts me into a serious
 academic jeopardy.

        In conclusion, I seriously urge you to reconsider your decision
 regarding my paper's grade.  I hope that on a second consideration of the
 paper, it will reveal itself, as it has done to me, to be worthy of more
 than a C+.  The paper seems to me a good one, with obvious effort and
 thought poured in.


        Sincerely Yours, 
        Jarett Kobek
