 Monroe: If I don't go I'll get my ass kicked.
 Monroe's Mom: Relax!  You go get ready, and I'll get you in for free.

        <Some time later (and after applying a lot of horrible makeup).>

 Monroe's Mom: This is the style, dude!
 Monroe: Oh my god!  Mom!  You don't know how stupid you look!

        <A quick note:  If any of you have seen hardcore "Mansonites" you
 can imagine what they look like at this point.>

        <Cut to concert, door to backstage, large burly security guard is

                       III: The Cap'n Made It Happen
                       =============================

        <Enter Nathaniel, who approaches shadle student who is female.>

 Nathaniel: <bubbles over head popping simulate brain activity, proceeds
            to drool and stare at female in front of him.>

 Girl: Ah duh... What the hell are YOU looking at... <Walks away.>

 Nathaniel: <Thinking> My manhood musta scared her... Ya, that's it. Hey,
            Look, It's da "Cap'n"
 Nathaniel: <Yelling>: How about you suck my tree trunk Cap'n!

        <Nathaniel gets a frightened look on his face, and shrivels up like
 a raisin in fear.>

 Nathaniel: Oh god <Mouth opening reveals one tooth/can opening device.>

        <Footnote: As he stared into the face of the Maelstrom.>

 Cap'n Intensity: So, so fed up.

        <Footnote: he has black eyes as a result from not sleeping, very
 evil.>

        <Nathaniel proceeds to throw up his hands and beg forgiveness.>

        <Cap'n intensity proceeds to unload three clips into Nathaniel.>

        <Footnote: one clip, two clip, three clip, floor.>

        Thus ends the product of multiple inbreedings.


                IV:  Why Peeing On An Electric Fence is Bad
                ===========================================


        Kid walks up to electric fence and begins to pee on it.

        - Cranial activity ends soon after, becomes a shadle high school
          student.

        - Head begins to catch fire, Looks like cancer stick (chicks dig
          it)

        - Hair loss may occur, use rogaine with minoxodyl.

        - Loss of ability to have kids as penis catches fire, But thats Ok
          all kids are evil.

        - Upper torso reduced to ash, oh well at least you don't need to
          get any New fashionable T-shirts (Note: May kill chance of
          females being attracted to you, awwww.)

        - After being totally set ablaze only a pair of shoes remain.

 [-----]

        First off, I would like to thank my friend Josh, me and him cooked
 these stories up at school a few weeks ago.  He drew some comics for them
 and those are pretty nifty, but I couldn't draw them in ascii.  I suck.
 There are no morals or lessons to be learned except for the following:

 - Baywatch and most other television programs are horrible (Who didn't see
   that one coming?)
 - Marilyn Manson is a waste of precious oxygen that would be better spent
   burning things in an inorganic chemistry class.
 - Don't ever call Josh "Captain Intensity" (A lot of you won't ever meet
   him, so I'm not worried.)
 - All warning labels need to be removed from dangerous products and places
   so idiots that pee on electric fences and ingest bleach are cleansed
   from the gene pool.
