        In the year 2000, everything we know are reality is going to end.

        I've heard people talk all about this stuff about the world
 coming to an end.. armageddon... et cetera.  I've come up with my own
 hypothesis, based on obvious facts presented directly to me.

        It all started a few days before New Years Ever, 1998.  Everybody
 was running around, having a jolly ol' time with their friends, and
 families, seeing they had their holiday breaks...

        "WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM YOU SELFISH, SPOILED BRAT?!" my
 mother said, before running into her room, and slamming the door, harder
 then humanly possible.

        This, resulting from me getting ready to leave for a shopping
 trip, that she had known about, and not taking out the garbage which
 would take 5 minutes, but I preferred to finish what I was doing first.

        Now, this might not seem completely odd, but you don't know my
 mother.  My mother, Kathy, is the sweetest, most kind, gentle, caring
 person alot of people will ever be fortunate enough to meet.  Yes, I'm
 proud to call her my Mother, but indeed... that moment I felt like
 another teenager having their daily fight with her mother.  It was
 scary, and most definately 'Odd.'

        Another example was my friend's mother freaking out on her, for
 the oddest things.  Then there was my other friend, who's mother is
 usually inconsiderete and actually tried to have a conversation with
 her... or even better... her stepdad spent over one hundred dollars,
 buying her things for her new hamster, when he used to yell at her about
 every little thing.

        My friend and I thought about all these little things, and
 decided that they weren't the only ones acting strange.  We examined
 everyone... our friend, who was notorious for sucking over 100 penises,
 is monogamous as of recently.  Also, her younger sister has gotten
 completely irrational and make-believe like.  My father has quit being
 completely submissive to my mother, my once kkk meeting attending
 friend is now accepting black people into her life, not only as
 associates, but as friends, and even... equals!  My happy go-lucky choir
 teacher has been acting quite weird for almost this whole school year,
 and my devout straight edge friend got drunk and stoned on her birthday.

        So, in examining all of this in great detail, i realized even I
 was acting strange.. i've been self concious and nervous, and most of
 all.. i've been craving _security_!

        People tell us that the world is going to end in the year 2000.
 _MY_ theory is, the world as we know it will end, or the world as the
 human race once knew it will end.  But, the neat thing is... it could
 mean anything.  What if aliens land and take over?  or, if they teach us
 new ways about life, civilization.. anything.  But what I do know, is
 that everyone is changing, and rapidly.  1999 is the year of the
 apocalypse.  The pre-destruction of the earth is going to result in
 some pretty fucked up shit.  It's goin' down.

        "This is our warning.  Revolution starts on the inside."
