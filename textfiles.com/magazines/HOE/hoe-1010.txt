	marvin, i was calm.  but now i'm starting to get agitated.

	if YOU were under extreme amounts of pressure, would you become a
 pipe of plumbing?  would YOU supply water to the sink or let that job be
 taken care of by the small children in the room carrying buckets from the
 well?  would YOU let all these small diapered infants do the work for you
 just because your fireman of a father was stepping on your stupid red
 hat?  just because YOUR head hurts, you're going to make so much work
 for stubby-fingered midgets?

	i don't like you, i never have.

	you smell like canned olives and your jeans are an improper shade
 of blue.  your eyes bug out of your head.  making eye contact with you is
 painful, my head splits open so that people can look at all the folds on
 my brain, and as the folds multiply, more people come to watch the
 spectacle, and then we charge admission, you fucking asshole.  if there's
 pressure on anyone here, its me.  how are we going to keep on living like
 this, with our wonderful furnace and indoor plumbing, and toddlers, if
 all the pressure shifts to you?  without some stress in my life, my head
 will never pulsate the same way again, and the circus that is my life
 will come to an end.  we will have to buy elephants somewhere to keep the
 stupid masses of customers happy, and i don't know where to get
 elephants.  i know where elephants ARE, i don't think i can TAKE or BUY
 them, because they haven't got price tags on em, and there aren't SHELVES
 that hold the elephants, like a normal store would have, and africa is
 not a store, that fact has been made very clear in recent years, i think.
 though i can buy sugar cane or olives or pearls or diamonds from that
 country, well, it's not a giant shopping plaza.

	no, YOU SHUT UP.  i'm sick of your dirty fat rotten lazy mouth.  
 when is the last time YOU lifted a finger around this big top of an
 extravaganza?  i make all the money to pay our living expenses and you
 just sit and make bridges out of toothpicks.  you're not going to GET
 ANYWHERE IN LIFE, you lazy ass sunnabitch.

	five dollars, please.

	thank you.

	now where was i

	pull those potato chips OUT OF YOUR ASS oh yeah don't EAT THEM you 
 crazy cockroach useless hunk of muffin trash!  if doctors operated on 
 you they'd find FECES.  that's ALL.  fucking FECES in your HAIR, your 
 EYES, your BUTT -- that hairy, nasty, lazy output mechanism of your 
 rear, hind end.  
	oh don't you
		don't you even

	DON'T BREAK THE FURNITURE

 son of a bitch

	mom gave us that couch

	now you ain't got nowhere to sit you fat ass marvin

	YEAH YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK AND BECOME A HAIRDRESSER MY lousy fat 
 white ass you are.

	you just tug at your nipples all day while i toil away, and this 
 kitchen gets scummy from all the dirt nuggets these folks carry in, but 
 you're doing nothing about it.  if you were the boss i could sue you 
 for poor working conditions but you're just an ugly gargoyle coughing 
 up yellow mucus into a bowl and i have to hit you on the back with a 
 rubber mallet, fucker.

	yeah, stand there.

 ok.

 MARVIN 
	are you going to be in this family photo or WHAT?

 yeah there we go

 ok now everybody smile

 CHEESE
