        I've come to the realization that ads concerning drugs, drinking,
 and sex don't serve their purpose the way they should.  Though their
 purpose is to help strengthen the bond between parent and child, I think
 that it in fact does the opposite.  Not only do they cause uncomfortable
 situations, but they've also taken the wrong effect on parents.  Parents
 don't sit you down and have a heart-to-heart about drugs, sex, or
 drinking, after they see these ads.  They usually just cause terribly
 awkward silences, or take no effect whatsoever.   

        A few nights ago, I was sitting in front of the tube with my dad,
 spending quality time with him while drinking screwdrivers.  It's not
 often my father and I share such moments, as my parents are divorced.
 Then an ad comes on with a bunch of 13 year olds looking all tough saying
 "We're young, we have hopes and dreams, we are the future.  And we don't
 drink!"  My dad looks over at me with a guilty look on his face.  In his
 eyes I am the futureless daughter of his drinking and smoking my life away,
 and this was brought to his attention because of the commercial he just 
 saw.  I started laughing at his upset look and asked him what's the 
 matter with him.

        "Well, I'm just worried about your future and stuff.  You know,
 like if you're going anywhere in your life," says Dad.

        "Daddy, I'm 18 years old.  I don't have to go to university till
 I'm 21!  Plus, I'm of age to drink!  So chill," says I.

        "Oh, okay.  You're just going to continue working for that
 telepersonals thing until your 21?"  

        "Yup!"

        Luckily I had my backup plan to tell Dad that my slacking off and
 not going to school had a valid reason.  However if I had not been
 prepared for my dad's question, I'd have been screwed.

        My brother and I were watching the end of a movie, and were about
 to go smoke up in my basement.  When the tape ended, he pressed Stop and
 we started to get ready when my mother walks into the living room.  Sadly,
 the television was on Fox 44 and the ad featuring the two coolboys from 
 the 80's skateboarding around their suburb and then smoking a tiny joint, 
 with the voiceover saying 'Studies show that 40% of kids who smoke 
 marijuana live in the city.  Guess where the other 60% live?'  Living in a
 suburb just outside the city, our neighbourhood looks a lot like the one
 in the ad.  Right then, Mother asked 'Where are you going?'  And my
 brother replied 'Down into the basement, to smoke up.'  I gulped, but
 didn't freak out, considering my mother's reply was 'Make sure you light
 some incense.'  I was kind of shocked, but I wasn't complaining.

        One night while watching TV with my mother, I noticed a 'Not Me,
 Not Now' ad being played, but before I could reach for the remote to
 switch the channel, a young, aspiring teenager says "And having sex before
 I'm ready isn't something I'm going to do.  I'm going to wait."  Avoiding
 all eye contact with my mother, she then asked, 'Audrey, have you
 waited??', which leaves me in a terrible disposition.  I innocently say
 'Waited for what, mom? Heh. Heh.' and bat my eyelashes a bit.  My
 innocence throws her over enough for me to make it out of the room just in
 time.  Again, this uncomfortable situation could have been avoided if that
 ad was not shown.

        Again, while watching TV with Dad, yet another anti-marijuana
 commercial came on, this time with the cool parents rapping to their son
 that the whacky weed just ain't cool, yo.  The caption was 'Any way you
 talk to your kids about drugs is a good way.'  And with that, my dad broke 
 out laughing and said 'Fuckin' fags!' So, from what I've gathered, these 
 ads just aren't reaching out like they should.

        A better idea would be to inform parents that their children will
 be the ones who'll be choosing their homes, so let's hope they're not
 burnt-out alcoholic whores when choosing.  I think that would hit home a
 lot more than 'The whacky weed, it just ain't cool, yo'. 

        Anti-drug, anti-sex, and anti-drinking commercials do not work.  No
 matter how hard they try.
