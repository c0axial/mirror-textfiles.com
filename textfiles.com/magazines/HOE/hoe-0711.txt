 <PEASOUP> ...
 <Perly> dude, 30 years of arpanet, wtf do you thing, they didn't get
         anything from it?
 <SkYFLuXX> gov has turned into something else
 <Perly> Mistreatd: now thanks to the media, yes
 <SkYFLuXX> the people don't own shit anymore
 <cstone_> skyfluxx: what has it turned into?
 <cstone_> skyfluxx: please give examples
 <SkYFLuXX> it's turned into a heirarchy of exclusive control
 <SkYFLuXX> of the rich
 <SkYFLuXX> and powreful
 <cstone_> hierarchy? sure.  exclusive control over what, though?
 <PEASOUP> shit
 <PEASOUP> thats great
 <SkYFLuXX> the common man don't got shit no more
 <PEASOUP> Perly
 <cstone_> the government isn't nearly precise enough to totally manipulate
           everything that the news media does
 <PEASOUP> are u sure?
 <PEASOUP> what about the gov
 <PEASOUP> don
 <PEASOUP> t they own u

 <SkYFLuXX> possibly
  <PEASOUP> Stupidity is a possibility
 <SkYFLuXX> to some extent

 <Perly> i mean someone in u.s
 <PEASOUP> hahaha
 <PEASOUP> Us is not #1
 <Perly> cause the gov't has a huge army
 <PEASOUP> that is the "bs"
 <Perly> i never said it was
 <spec9> let me guess
 <spec9> 'the chinese'
 <Perly> all i said that no1 inside of u.s can build an army that can take
         over the entire government
 <SkYFLuXX> no boys
 <SkYFLuXX> let me tell you
 <Perly> the entire country even
 <SkYFLuXX> if russia and china teamed up right now
 <SkYFLuXX> in the kosovo shit
