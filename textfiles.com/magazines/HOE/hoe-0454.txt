        I like antique crap... but updated antique crap.  I once saw a
 193X Ford coupe.  It was all decked out with electronic dash, tons of
 power goodies.  I'd take it, put a killer stereo in it, and drive that
 fucker every day.  I had plans for that console stereo I had, too.  I
 wanted to seal the speakers, add a cd player and dual cassette wells.
 I like the way console stereos look.  So that brings me my computers.

        I got my first computer as a hand-me-down from my dad in the fall
 of '96.  It's a 1987 Macintosh Classic II with 4 megs of ram, monochrome
 CRT, and a 40 meg hard drive that my sister bought new for over $2000.
 I used this computer as my main computer until I bought my lap top this
 fall.  I even used it online with a 2400 baud modem that I got last
 spring.  It's powered by Motorola's 68040 chip which is not too bad
 considering it's the last SISC (non-PowerMac) chip put in Macs or their
 clones.  I even had an ImageWriter II printer for it that I found at
 Goodwill for $2.50!! Up until the RISC native programs became the Mac
 standard, the only software limitation I had was the lack of color
 options...two color mode was all I had when 16 color greyscale would have
 ran most anything I wanted.

        Goodwill is a great store for me.  Not only did I find my console
 stereo and my printer for $2.50, but lots of other useless crap.  Another
 favorite of mine is St. Vincent DePaul, aka Vinnie's.  Vinnie's has two
 Dubuqueland locations, downtown on Main Street and, what I call "Vinnie's
 West", near our "suburb" Asbury.  It was this second location that I
 found my Apple //e.  It came with Apple DOS floppies, a whole meg of ram,
 and the infamous Apple SuperSerial card.  For an extra $5 I even got a
 color monitor!  I'm unable to find any software to get my Apple online,
 so I looked around for Apple //gs, but they're still popular, thus
 overly-expensive.

        My newest toy is a TRS-80 color.  I need to find some other
 hardware and software for it, otherwise it's little more than an
 over-sized keyboard.

        Well, I guess I've bored you all enough for one t-file, so I
 guess I'll be going.  But, remember kids, ya gotta catch 'em all!!
