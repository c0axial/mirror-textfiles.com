 <kaia> how'd your essay go?
 <Nybar> gotta give a shout-out to kaia, her clarity is amazin', still
         blazin', yo, just like blazin' the trails, enemy of the K clan
         get put on a bed of nails, impaled; there's no trick, and yet
         she's still a magician, conjuring styles off the tip like my
         nigga John Grisham, yo, the essay, i hear it one time, let me
         tell you one thing, yo, the essay went fine
 <Nybar> took all the elements, word, and i combined, that's why i'm
         freed up to _be_ here spittin' this rhyme
 <kaia> word!!
 <Nybar> gettin' busy droppin' metaphors about all the characters i could
         see, remaining calm under pressure like General Lee, specifically
         at the first battle of bull run, that's why when i hand in the
         paper, i have the home run, quite a caper...
 <kaia> hahah
 <Nybar> 5: gay or light-hearted recreational activity for diversion or
         amusement; "it was all done in play"; "their frolic in the surf
         threatened to become ugly"
 <kaia> ohh
 <kaia> i didn't see "paper" before it, now i see
 <kaia> caper:  1.  pickled nasturtium seed
 <Nybar> word, score quite a caper call me the microphone, serial-raper
         decimator can't stop my flow over IRC i'm the illest rillest
         original emcee, and right now one time as i proceed with my
         flow, i'm thinking you'll never stop me never trip me up with
         any topic...
 <kaia> topic:  breakfast cereal.
 <Nybar> one time you know you can't fuck with my material, because i
         _eat_ wack emcees in my breakfast cereal, yeah, i eat breakfast
         because it's the most important meal of the day, it increases
         scores in math so about nutrition i don't play, from New York to
         LA a bowel of cereal helps me to get ill on stage, and when i'm
         battling, word, the cereal sustains my rage.
 <kaia> AHha
 <kaia> topic:  Dead Babies.
 <Nybar> dead babies, yeah, that's the novel by martin amiss, that nigga's
         world famous for dropping jewels such as this, because of the
         work, word, i think we should re-enlist, i'll kick a free about
         what dead babies is about: an amoral future in which only
         sensualism has clout, no existentialism, word, so it causes 
         everything to die, the ignorance/reality dichotomy sending all
         them niggas to the sky, word.
 <kaia> HZHSAHH
 <kaia> can that be the conclusion paragraph to your essay?
 <Nybar> i had a typo one time as i got busy with my free, give me
         another topic you're still not stoppin' me
 <kaia> cannibalism in NYC
 <Nybar> not stoppin' me, like them cannibals in NYC, set it off for the
         modern era like Sawney Beane, except this ain't Scotland it's
         the west-village scene, yeah, this topic is cannibalism one time
         and i'm hearin', cannibalism in NYC starts and heads start
         disappearing, "where the fuck are they" yo the feds will trace
         it to our cave, where Jarett and me eat the flesh of people they
         couldn't save, word, they may arrest us, but never disrespect
         us, they fear us, like Hannibal Lec, can't come near us.
 <Nybar> like into the flesh i eat i tear into the mic, give me the next
         topic and i'll keep this shit tight
 <kaia> a vegetable garden in Michigan
 <Nybar> word, a vegetable garden in Michigan, to maintain that shit,
         word, would take discipline, because the Michigan vibe, you
         check it, and see that Wayne-life is truly hectic, a vegetable
         garden, word, like an oasis, to dispense calm and peace on an
         equal basis, i think my man Jarett needs to plant it, word, and
         then his mantra could be "Peace", sistah he could chant it.
 <kaia> HAHAHAH
 <kaia> tha'ts good
 <kaia> next
 <kaia> souvenir tee shirts with names of towns on them
 <Nybar> yo, there's a statistical oddity you see, i checked it one time
         and combine it in my free, my rhyme, the oddity i saw was this:
         the tourists who buy them shits caught a diss, because in New
         York what's the #1 t-shirt sold? it's "I love NY", yeah, it
         gets the gold, word, but here's the fucked up shit i kick for
         you, consider, what memento in new york is number two? that
         would be the shirt that read "I hate new york", so now you catch
         it, fickle tourists can't make up their minds, word, so they
         snatch it
 <kaia> haha
 <kaia> next do american tourists in foreign countries
 <Nybar> a love/hate relationship with the rotten apple's what they got,
         and me? I only bring you real hiphop, nonstop, so drop the next
         topic, yeah, then i'll man my telepathic keyboard and proceed to
         rock it
 <Nybar> American tourists, word, they tend to be dumb, in foreign
         countries stick out like a sore thumb, gawking at local
         traditions, yeah, showing no respect, that's why when they're in
         Bulgaria they're always catchin' rep, having their money stolen;
         they disrespect the foreign calves that's golden, so before
         going abroad, word, always be prepared, know the local customs
         down in the place, under your hair.
 <kaia> hajaj. yes.'
 <kaia> topic:  how jimmy decided to be a dentist when he grows up
 <Nybar> yo, one time if you're with me, i'm gonna sling a little free
         about a boy named Jimmy, word, it turns out little Jimmy is a
         sadist, he saw a movie on "HBO" called the dentist, that dentist
         cut people up, word, showing no love; performing oral
         surgery--not wearing a glove, no anesthesia so people could feel
         his style, so now Jimmy wants to be a dentist to get wild, get
         loose, and spill blood juice all over the place, putting sharp
         implements in a little kid's face.
