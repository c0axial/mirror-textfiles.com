        Yeah..  In my Spanish book in 7th grade when we got to the animal
 chapter they also included the animal sounds.  Now I did really bad in
 Spanish so I know almost none of the Spanish in this is correct but bear
 with me here.  The cat said 'Maur'.  The dog said 'Raur'.  The chicken said
 'Qua'.. Qua?  I have never ever heard a chicken say Qua what the hell is
 that.  Apparently Spanish animals over use their U's.  This is a serious
 problem and I think it is caused by the lack of animal education in
 Spanish-speaking countries.  If the people of the Spanish-speaking nations
 would just get off their lazy asses and say listen there dog, its Arf, or
 Grrrrowl, not Raur!  What are you some kind of pansy girlie dog?  If a
 Rotweiler walked up to you and said Raur, would you run?  No!  You would
 giggle insanely and say 'Ha! Ha! that dog said Raur!  What a wussie little
 dog!'

        I also recall that the animals in my sister's French book said funny
 things too.  However, I cannot recall any of them and various French people
 have assured me that their pets do not talk funny.

        Apparently the over-use of the letter U among Spanish animals has
 gotten way out of control.  That's why I am asking everyone to donate to
 'The Foundation for the Elimination of the Letter U from the Vocabulary of
 Spanish-Speaking Animals' FELUVSSA, for short.  Along with a donation of
 20 dollars or more to FELUVSSA you will receive a T-shirt that reads 'Thanks
 to me one dog in a Spanish-Speaking nation barks like an American dog' with
 a picture of the Taco Bell Chihuahua on the front.  Due to lack of funds we
 were forced to steal ad's from Taco Bell instead of getting our own.  You
 will also get a certificate of authenticity for your T-shirt.

        What the hell is that ringing sound?
