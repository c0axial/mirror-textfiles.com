        Enter the dictator decapitated head.  Scary thought mused the young
 sly gentleman, calmly to himself, fear of arrest!

        Handcuffs make him wary, so he avoided that train of thought.

        The elephant parade walked by with sheep in the head, listing the
 state of the union and how are things going? good, fine, very fine. The head
 jumped on and on about rambling incoherency in the government, of which
 there was none!  Dying to get out.

        He passed a note to the anterior, they received.  Note taken!

        Politicians politicking, they polished their shoes and gave him a
 grin.  The thinker looked over the three standing and whizzed.

        Gears grinding to a halt, Giant spider!  The end of things to come.
 Felt tip markets selling fine fresh produce and consume.

        The way things now are, the way things will be, and they never were!
 Not at all!  They all thought it up.  And thinking is the main cause of
 hunger.  Thirst for something bigger, better.

        To have a surplus is good, indeed.  To be in need of, one need think,
 decapitated head for the goal!  Tournaments are today, I heard.  Ever to
 leave, needly breathless!  Black.  Empty.

        Melodrama.  Bring on the peanuts!  And so the man backed away from
 the three.  His breath skipping, his heart short.  He reached back, from the
 corner of the room came a gentleman not unlike the scores of announcers and
 auctionhouses are around here, not.  But this, no different, no same.
 Clean, shiny, newly minted penny, shoes.  And if ever a time came, he stood
 and walked away.  The frog was happy.  He found his place among the tadpoles
 to eat and sing and the others came and went, nearly the same height as he,
 but without a decapitated head.
