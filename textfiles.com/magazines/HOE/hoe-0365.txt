        One day gregory sat up in his little room and looked at the wall.
 He thought about the wall, and the wall's place in the universe.  He
 thought about himself and where he was, and he thought about life.  He
 sat there for what must've been days, just examining the wall, and the
 walls in his head, And then, it happened.  Bang!  Like lightning hit
 his brain stem and snapped it right in half, gregory discovered... the
 big huge secret.

        Oh how wonderful and complete his life would now be.  Finally he
 would find peace with himself.  All the people of the world would
 rejoice and praise the god that is gregory. Disease and hunger and pain
 would be wiped out from the earth, world peace was imminent!

        Immediately gregory jumped to his feet and started running
 around the room, there was no time to waste.  Armies had to be
 nullified, world leaders had to be notified, gregory had to hurry up
 and tell someone the big huge secret while the world still had a
 chance.  So, thrashing and tearing, gregory's white garments fell to
 the floor.  Gregory started to panic, what if he didn't tell someone
 the big huge secret in time and it was too late.  What if gregory
 completely lost and forgot the big huge secret, and spent the rest of
 his life trying to remember what he realized?  An so gregory screamed.
 Just once.  But he knew it would do.

        Immediatly he heard footsteps, running footsteps.  Gregory
 couldn't wait to tell the person what he now knew.  The footsteps grew
 closer, and finally gregory saw the door knob slowly turn.  The door
 began to open, and the figure stepped in and showed it's face.  Gregory
 looked at the figure.  The figure looked at gregory.  Then gregory
 composed himself, took a deep breath, and told the person the entire
 big huge secret.

        "ut!" proclaimed gregory.

        "..ut?" asked the person.

        "ut." said gregory.

        "oh, ...ut." said the person.

        Then the person gave gregory his dose of thorazine, refastened
 gregory's white straight jacket back on, and put gregory back in his
 bed.

        Gregory looked over at the wall, a blank stare in his eyes,
 mumbled one last "ut" and went to sleep.

        - how can a person simply refuse to understand someone who is
 supposed to be their own child?  lock me up. who cares if it doesn't
 help me.  that isn't the point.  the point is our insurance will only
 cover mental hospital stays for a few more months, and we can't let
 17 years of monthly premiums go to waste now can we dad?  hospital
 stays.

        i would imagine in a family that it meant breaking your arm
 while playing football.

        i would imagine that my mother when faced with her own lunacy
 would at least try to see how it got there.

        i would imagine i'm supposed to do more than just sit here and
 wait for the next outburst... that i should do more than simply eat my
 pills and make GOD-DAMNED FUCKING SURE that i get where i'm supposed to.
 they're all coming up the stairs now.

        i would imagine that somebody, somewhere, would seek me out, for
 something, anything.

        any little thing would do.

        because i don't know if i can wait any longer.  they're knocking
 on the door.  apparently i've got one hell of an imagination.

        but it's either this. which i now vow to refuse.

        or just throw some money in your pockets danny and leave forever.
 search out that somebody.

        just..go.

        maybe that's it.

        - fairwinds

        It's not bad once your settled in there, you hardly notice it
 anymore.  There's none of that calling your friends and telling them
 "You'll never guess where I am."  It's just a complete numbness that
 overcomes you.  You get seriously bored though, just lying in there
 with your head, the thing that got you locked up in the first place,
 it's all you're left to keep you company. You crack your neck, your
 back, your knuckles. You count to a thousand. You inhale through your
 mouth, exhale through your nose, inhale through your mouth, exhale
 through your mouth, inhale through your nose, exhale through your
 mouth, inhale through your nose, exhale through your nose, and on and
 on to fucking oblivion.

        You count the seconds between when they open the door to check
 if your dead or not.  (Somewhere around 900.)  You don't think, you
 don't change at all, you don't realize anything sleep wouldn't show
 you, you don't write, and if you do it's always got this bland tone to
 it, like writing a post-card.  Your basically forced to live.  A nice
 place to live mind you, but who would wanna visit?

        There are many aspects to being locked up.  Boredom for example,
 counting to 1000 simple because you've never done it before.
 Discipline, being punished for the first time, or punished without
 reason.  Imprisoned without reason is the main injustice.  Any 'help'
 is deemed unessessary and litteraly is.  The subject will begin to get
 angry with his captors, acting out and not being at all rational about
 his trivial consequences.  The subject will be labeled and drugged
 sedated and bedridden for a period meant to calm him down.  However,
 This period will pass.  The subject again wakes up, views his
 surroundings, and then begins to go quite berserk.  and then begins to
 go quite berserk.  And then begins to go quite berserk And then begins
 to go quite berserk And then begiins to go quite berserkl;odfiqf

        - Adolescent rehabilitation is a far cry from the adult side.
 For one thing there's not a teenaged junkie anywhere that literally
 wants to get off his smack.  And to make it worse, these same teenaged
 junkies are always locked up involuntarily, shown every drug known to
 man and the effects it'll have on you, and then released. After which
 nobody is clean.

        The staff, the only other humans you encounter during this
 process, turn out to be completely winging the whole thing anyway.
 Ask to make a phone call and you'll be told "Hell no."  But ask the
 right person and you'll be on somebody's cellular.  And there's always
 an undefined, ignored attitude displayed by psychoanalysts.  The idea
 that they're there to actually help you with your problems quickly
 fades away.  And you find yourself often arguing your stand-point on
 reality with them.  No matter, your always wrong, your the loony and
 they get paid to be there, so you couldn't possibly be right.  And it's
 this same general approach to psychoanalysis that i think fucks our
 mental health system straight up the eye.  Each patient appears to have
 some belief... some theory on how the world works, and the first thing
 they're told is that they've got it ass-backwards.  Thus they're entire
 moral system crumbles, and with the help of some fancy chemicals...
 plastic surgery for the brain.. they finally arrive at a "theraputic
 level."

        But what about that belief?  That mindset that didn't come from
 John Hopkins but from surviving, from experiance. What does a person do
 without it?

        - For Jeremiah.

        they say that they can help, that they can provide coping skills
 that will help me throughout my life.  i told them no, i didn't need any
 help.  they disagreed, they locked me up.  and i went to work on them,
 and they went to work on me (providing coping skills and such) one day
 they told me that the color blue did not exist, that it had never
 existed, and that every time i saw the color blue i was only kidding
 myself.  i disagreed.  but i wasn't quite sure how to take on this new
 blue-nonexistence coping skill.  so one day i was let to go outside
 because i happened to be such a good coping skill student.  i looked up
 and in the sky i spotted a patch of what i believed to be blue, i then
 told the nearest one of them that this is what blues looks like.  but
 they still maintained that blue did not exist, so i got a mad and began
 to get quite violent. i said yes it does exist dammit, look at this it's
 blue!  but they disagreed, them, those with the pills, and papers, and
 money. they disagreed, they don't believe in blue
 and i,
 am still,
 locked up.

        - I'm only glad i wasn't in for drugs this time... thank christ
 i was just "depressed", right?  I'd be out in two weeks, right?  I
 signed in voluntarily so you guys'll just adjust my medication and plop
 me back into the world after my very very brief stay, correct?  Well
 I've been in here for 2 months now, everyone else has come and gone.
 Either vaporacted up the street to a more locked-down facility, or
 their parents finally decided to take them home.  There were 15 of us
 when i first got here, now three.  Luke, the millionaires son who
 devolped a nice little drug habit that began to interfere with his
 performance on the foot-ball team.  And Jen, coke addict, and probably
 the kindest person i've ever met.

        And then there was me.  The cynically depressed kid who wanted
 to be a writer when he grew up, who was the oldest at seventeen, and
 because of this fact had to run every group.  Holy christ, i was the
 veteran.  All i kept wondering was how i got to this point.  Why did
 everybody think i was going to kill myself if they left me alone for
 more than 5 minutes.

        - The gun flashed up a blinking 76 on the read-out.  So he put
 the car in gear and turned the lights on.

        Pulling over the small four door, he noticed it was inhabited
 by four boys, all in thier teens.  He walked up to the window of the
 car and asked for the drivers' lisence and registration.  The kid
 obliged.  His name was mike.  And he had been concentrating on
 breathing and keeping his eyes open, not on the sign that said 35mph.
 It's a good thing he was driving his car tonight though, a rare event
 actually.  And only good in that if it was anyone else driving they'd
 all be fucked.  The four people in the car shot each other quick looks
 of "oh shit we're goin' ta jail" while the cop glanced at the lisence.
 CJ, riding shotgun, played it cool as humanly possible though. Like a
 god-damn presidential candidate.

        The cop; "None of you boys have been doin' any drinking tonight
 have you?"

        "No sir." replied Cj and mike simultaneously.

        The cop; "...you sure?"

        The shit-faced tall kid in the back nudges his beer bottle under
 the front seat.  That was Jay.  My best friend.

        "Yes sir." by the same two.

        "k...and this is your car?"

        Mike; "Yeah it's my car."

        CJ; "...He's my room-mate, and we're just taking this guy
 home." and he points to the other drunk in the back seat.  That was
 me.  The author.  The writer of this drivel.

        The cop opens up his army issue space-aged fucking spotlight
 outta hell and flashes it directly at my eyes.

        And, like an idiot, i smile and give 'im the peace symbol.

        The cop to mike; "..alright..so where's the fire?"

        Mike glances at his cigarette and holds it up to the cop.  Then
 he says with a laugh so tainted with liquor you'd hafta be underwater
 not to smell it; "Right here."

        He let us off with a warning.

        - Yes... I'm fine.

        Somebody need a murder victim?  I'll fully volunteer right about
 now.  Got a little orange sheet of paper last period, it told me to go
 wait half an hour for Mrs. Novak, outside her door.  She's finally
 ready, and wants too know why I missed Saturday school, and why I'm
 late all the time.  So i give her my story, about the circadian rythm
 disturbance, the doctors, the pills, The Pills, THE PILLS!  She hands
 me a piece of paper to sign.  I comply.  "What's this anyway?"

        "It's a suspension form Danny."

        "Right.  Perfect."

        "Do you need a pass back to class?"

        I left.  Passed Mr. Wirth in the hallway.  He hates me,  with
 a passion.

        "How's it going?"

        "yes... I'm fine."

        Quickly decide that i need a cigarette right-the-fucking-hell
 now, and contemplate ditching the rest of the day so as to retain my
 now tattered sanity.  In other words, "Where's Dara?"

        Pass Ilene in the hall, Ilene wants to sell me some dots, too
 bad I'm broke.

        "How are you doing?"

        "yes... I'm fine."

        Funny, those little times when all hell brakes loose.  The fire
 alarm screams out, your girlfriend wants to know what you 'think', your
 supposed to choose between two people, your supposed to graduate, to get
 it together, you should be working, and married, and have kids.  WRITE
 A BOOK! SUCCEED-PAY TAXES-QUIT SMOKING-DON'T DRINK-GO TO AA-USE A
 CONDOM-JOIN THE ARMY-LIVE-VOTE REPUBLICAN-DONATE YOUR ORGANS-BE FOR OR
 AGAINST Abortion, Gays, Drugs, The President, God, Yourself.  Maybe
 I'll steal a gun, load it up with shotgun shells and take out an entire
 police squad, maybe I'll drop out of school today, get a job and kill
 myself in three years, maybe i'll leave right now...

        right now. right now.

        And get a pack of cigarettes.

        Or maybe I'll sit here.  Do what I'm supposed to do.  Say what
 I'm supposed to say.  Hear what I'm supposed to hear.  Think what I'm
 supposed to think, and when you see me in the hallway you can ask me
 "how are you doing?" and I'll say, "yes... I'm fine."

        - There was nothing we could generally say about anything in
 here.  We had no philosophies.  No Beliefs.  Just this conglomorative
 mind-fuck that we all wanted to escape.  They'll tell you over and over
 again that it isn't punishment, thet they were there to help you.  So
 we'd go along with it, we'd hand in our brains in a sad attempt to
 gain privilages.  We'd watch the movies and participate in the groups.
 And for a few, this actually worked.  But at night that all changed.

        At night you could hear the heroin addicts screaming through the
 sweat of thier beds.  It was night time when Mike tried to hang
 himself.  It was night when the new snap-case decided to get in the
 shower and not come out.  They pulled him from the bathroom soaking
 wet, naked and berserk.  The rest of us still with a hope to be free
 would have our ways with dealing with the madness.  You could ask for a
 sleeping pill from the nurse, which was always a placebo.  You could
 let your doctor know you couldn't sleep at night, and then he'd knock
 you out with his new cure. Or you could do what i did, pretend your
 some kind of outside force looking in on all of this, be a completely
 pretentious fuck, pretend your sane, and write it all down. 

        All I need, all that I want out of this whole fucking thing
 anymore, is to stay out of everyone's way.  I don't want your help,  I
 don't want you to pin me to the floor and tell me i exist, I don't want
 your idea's, your love, your guilt, your life, I just don't want to
 affect any of you anymore at all.
