        Ok, when Mogel asked me to write something for hoe, you know
 actually WRITE SOMETHING FOR HOE, rather than recycle old posts or my
 college transcript, I was like, "OK, I guess I owe that to you."
 Because, I guess I really do.

        So, what could I write for HOE? 

        What could I possibly write for HOE that would be original and
 edifying and throw light onto a subject that's pertinent to us all as
 human beings?

        And I realized, it hit me in a moment of pure inspiration, I
 need to write a file about how stupid people are!

        So, ok, here goes:

        Damn, I hate people.  They are as stupid as all shit.  No one
 understands me anymore, and everyone is a gigantic cultural illiterate
 incapable of understanding the simplest references to things like
 Sailor Moon or Dragon Ball Z (or GT) or Hentai or James Joyce or Henry
 James or Allen Ginsberg.

        Just the other day, I said to this guy I know, "My name is Allen
 Ginsberg, and I'm crazy as a daisy."

        you know what he said?

        "What the fuck are you talking about?  You're name is Jarett,
 and you aren't crazy at all."

        See?  He's an idiot!  I mean, ANYONE with even the SLIGHTEST
 inclination of CULTURE would be able to understand that what I said was
 a quote from a time magazine interview with Ginsberg & 2 others from
 the mid-to-late 1960s, when American was on the cusp of a social and
 political revolution.

        Or like, last weekend, at Thanksgiving, 1998, I'm sitting at
 the table and I'm talking about Al Pacino, one of our finest actors,
 and I do my impersonation of Pacino in Heat.  I say, "Because she's got
 a GREAT ASS!"  I even do the facial contortions and the exact same
 gesticulation that Pacino does, man, I've got it down cold.  AND NO ONE
 FUCKING LAUGHS.  NOT A SINGLE LAUGH.  They're all a bunch of illiterate
 assholes.

        See, the problem is, as we move into the 21st century, our
 technology has numbed us to the important things in life.  It used to
 be, in ages past,  that people would be interested in the real things in
 life, like Love, Friendship, and Brotherhood.  Now all people care about
 are cars and beepers and cellular phones.  And oh yeah, LAND, man, all
 anyone ever thinks about anymore is LAND.  It's because we've been
 numbed by this fast paced culture we live in, its effect is to serve as
 a general anaesthetic, making us blithely unaware of what's going around
 us.

        I call television the idiot box and the boob tube and the people
 around me get mad, because I DARE insult their fucking new God.
 Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, these things are ALL DEAD!  The only
 thing that remains is Television!  People worship it!  You probably
 know more about the cast of friends than you do your own family!

        You fuckers!

        People are getting stupider!  and there's more of them than
 ever before!  We're slowly dying!  Our culture is in the Winter of its
 life!  Oh, god!  oh god!  Oh god!

        Well, I don't have much else to say, but I'd just to add in that
 I'M NOT TRYING TO BE ANGSTY AND I'M NOT ANGSTY.  I've thought about this
 a whole lot, and I think my thought elevates me past the ANGST, and I'm
 not one of those people who are like, "THE WORLD IS COMING TO END!
 EVERYONE SUCKS!  I'M SAD AND ANGSTY!@&($&(*$!@&*$&^*!@$&*^@!*(^@^&*($^&"

        This is serious cognitive thought you're dealing with, not some
 humble teen aged emotion.

 !!========================================================================!!

        OK.

        Well, the above is a demonstration of the NUMBER ONE TRAP H0E
 writers have the misfortune of falling into:  writing a text file about
 how everyone is stupid and dumb and a jerk, and then claiming that they 
 aren't angsty afterwards.

        Now, I'm not going to address the issue of whether or not these
 text files have any worth, or whether or not they're so commonplace as
 to become as mundane as pissing in the toilet, but I am going to address 
 this issue of ANGST being viewed as a bad thing.

        Since I assume most people associated with H0E are illiterate,
 (including both writers and readers), I decided to put in the
 definition of ANGST in this file.

        But then, I decided I hate people who resort to dictionaries for 
 justification, as dictionaries are little more than the misguided 
 children of Samuel Johnson.  Johnson wasn't attempting to keep the
 language static.  Current dictionaries are.

        Oh what the hell:

        Angst. n : an acute but unspecific feeling of anxiety; usually
 reserved for philosophical anxiety about the world or about personal
 freedom.

        You know, inherently, there's nothing WRONG with angst.

        People *should* be angsty.

        It's as genuine an emotion as love or hate or fear, which, I'm
 sure, the mention of has evoked the standard response from all you
 HARD CORE modem people out there.  You know the response I'm talking
 about, you just muttered it beneath your breath.  You stupid fag.

        So, I'm not particularly inclined to making the same point over
 and over and over again, which means this article is about to end.

        here's the sum total: HOE WRITERS WRITE ABOUT PEOPLE BEING
 STUPID, REALIZE HOW STUPID IN TURN THEY HAVE BEEN, AND TRY TO DISGUISE
 IT BY CLAIMING THEY AREN'T ANGSTY.

        Don't.
