        Once there was this guy.

        For the sake of the story, let's call him Alex.

        Alex went to a club.

        Nothing significant happened at this club. Kinda makes me
 wonder -- why did I even bother to mention this club?  It's not like
 anything determining the outcome of Alex's life happened there.  Or did
 it?  Is human nature such that every event, no matter how small and
 insignificant, has an effect on the outcome of our life?  It could be.
 After all, Alex could've gone for a walk this evening and gotten shot.
 But no -- he went to the club.  Where is the significance here?  Perhaps
 the lack of significance is important.  You see, everywhere Alex goes he
 is followed by hundreds of people, for he is a famous movie star.  So
 the fact that no one followed him to the club and that not one thing of
 significance happened to him at the club is significant.

        Alex decided that since his trip to the club was so
 insignificant, he would leave.  Alex had walked about 100 feet before he
 was robbed and shot.  Now Alex encountered one of the most significant
 events in his life -- Death.

        Death embraced Alex with open arms. Alex, however, was reluctant
 to return this embrace. He was quite certain that nothing significant
 could happen to him from beyond the grave and requested that Death allow
 him to return to Earth where he might be able to experience significance.
 Death shrugged it's shoulders and complied.

        Alex decided that since his trip to the club was so insignificant,
 he would leave.  Alex had walked about 100 feet before he was robbed and
 shot.  Now Alex encountered one of the most significant events in his
 life -- Death.

        Death embraced Alex with open arms.  Alex, however, was reluctant
 to return this embrace.  He was quite certain that nothing significant
 could happen to him from beyond the grave and requested that Death allow
 him to return to Earth where he might be able to experience significance.
 Death shrugged it's shoulders and complied.

        Alex decided that since his trip to the club was so insignificant,
 he would leave.  Some people never learn.
