        During the last few years of my life, I have become a man.  My hands
 are very small, silky and smooth.  I do absolutely nothing to make them
 this way; they are what they are.  I can probably accredit it to the fact
 that I have not participated in a day of hard labor in my life.  Everyone
 who comes in contact with my hands is amazed by them.  This often leads to
 me saying something along the lines of "Imagine these hands caressing you
 breasts?"  Sometimes I get carried away and actually have sex.  What are
 these people thinking?

        I am a very particular person.  I find flaws in everyone I meet,
 but only admire people with infinite flaws.... The average person is not
 good enough for me.  The closer I get to a person, the harder I push them
 away.  I once had this best friend and he decided to jump ontop of me and
 perform unspeakable acts.  I haven't seen him since that happened.  No
 love has been lost.

        I have been hanging out with this girl recently and her friend is
 always around.  So out of the blue the friend asked me for my home
 address.  I didn't think much of it and I gave it to her..... Maybe she
 wanted to send me a post card when on vacation or something.  A few weeks
 later I received this big yellow envelope in the mail with the following
 written on the back, "Scars are souvenirs you never lose, the past is
 never far behind." Contained inside were poems and drawings that the
 girl had made.  So the next time I hung out with her, I kicked the living
 shit out of her and made her promise she would never send me another
 thing in the mail.  Hmm, actually..... I just never talked to her again.
