x . ---[intro]------------------------------------------------------------- . x

    sup everyone? this is turbo emag. i know how to code snuff, but didn't
    feel like it coding one for this, cuz i really like how misfit did the
    p0rk 'zine. i'm gonna cum out wit another zine just for everyone, with
    is currently being coded by me and sumother guy in the PA area.

    anywayz, this 'zine will prolly start out like p0rk. i'll let ya know
    a few thangs bout me before i babble on more and more and more.

    i've been in da scene for a while. i was in the 602 fire group, then
    pixel, vor, cia, thrust. then didn't get included in the merge, cuz
    they thought i ripped some ascii shit. if they wanna think that, then
    that is good for them, but i'll swear on da holy bible that i didn't
    rip anything they said that i did. and thats that, end of that story.


x . ---[p0rk!]------------------------------------------------------------- . x

    i really like how misfit put the last p0rk zine together. like it was
    hard. you just right about non-sense and people like us, will prolly
    like that snuff. well, i liked the story of your day. it kicked.
    might do one of those these days. but, my life is pretty much like his.
    hit the damn sleeper button a couple times. wake up 25 mins later.
    take a shower, get dressed, go to bus stop in the cold, even tho i
    live in arizona, were i don't get that cold, and then go to school.


x . ---[my music]---------------------------------------------------------- . x

    i listen to many types of music. that is prolly the only form of
    entertainment that i really use.  i watch tv sumtimes, but that
    gets borning. speaking of tv, does anyone watch wrestling on tnt or
    tbs. i saw sting wrestle hulk hogan and the dungeon of doom came in
    a broke things up. then hulk and sting smashed a chair on the gaint
    (the song of andre the giant). yeah, i know that snuff is fake, but
    hey, it gives me sumthing to watch, that i like.

    back to the music. here are some bands and singers i listen too:
    boyz II men, bon jovi, white zombie, korn, 3t, janet jackson,
    mariah carey, babyface, jon b., anything on the radio, shania
    twain (only country artist i listen too), areosmith, bush, civ, and
    much much much more. i really like everythang, 'cept for country
    and most rap.


x . ---[skool]------------------------------------------------------------- . x

    why does skool suck so much? actualy, my day at scholl only suckz when
    teachers give you lots of work (espically on weekends). i usualy, enjoy
    school. i know that sounds sick. but, i go around strutting thinking
    i'm god, cuz thatz who i am (simple as that). but, i check out all
    the fine girlz. smile and they go crazy. cuz i'm god. but, the best
    part is when that bell rings and its either time to go eat lunch or its
    time to go home.


x . ---[people]------------------------------------------------------------ . x

    why do people act like jerkz? it just bugs me. some of my friends do it.
    it just pisses me off.


x . ---[unabomber]--------------------------------------------------------- . x

    just was thinking of sumthang to write and thought about the unabomer.
    which has not been caught by the feds (FBI) for 17 years. i would like
    to say right now is that 'mr. unabomber, where ever you are. you're
    simply the best bomber alive.' that was kewl. anywayz, if you have
    any more info about this guy. like if you find out any stuff about him
    from a newzpaper or even from a faq then send me email. i will list
    the address at the end of this 'zine. right now i have his manifesto.

    also, if anyone sends me info about this guy that i dont already have.
    then you will be thanked and i will credit a FREE turbo issue to your
    account. <g>


x . ---[bombs]------------------------------------------------------------- . x

    how to make a fertilizer bomb...

    ingredients are as followz:
    -x- Newzpaper
    -x- Fertilizer (any with ammonia nitrate in it, or a chemical kind)
    -x- Cotton
    -x- Diesel fuel

    make a pouch out of the newspaper and put some fertilizer in it.
    put cotton on da top. soak da cotton wit da fuel. then light &
    run like a mutha fuqr! this blowz up about 500 square ft.

    or instead of using the newzpaper, just put in a welded sqaure or
    round metal box. and follow the same steps. this is the same bomb
    that timothy mcveigh used and left to blow the fuk out of oklahoma
    city federal building. good places to try this would be yer skool,
    federal building, mail office, yer enemies house, or jus any place
    that you feel like.


x . ---[6o2 syspimp of da month]------------------------------------------- . x

    this award will have to go to trip the syspimp of illegal immagrents.
    your board kicks, but some of yer userz are lamers. anywayz, yer alwayz
    there for me and get some of the new filez, even if i do like them or
    not.


x . ---[money]------------------------------------------------------------- . x

    money is what rulez are society and world. if it wasn't for money. you
    woould get everything free. now that doesn't that bad, but people are
    greed bastards and want to be better than everyone else.

    sometimes i wonder if you can buy these things:

    -x- friends
    -x- love
    -x- erasers
    -x- sex
    -x- monkey balls
    -x- bodyguards

    that was stupid. anywayz, if you are always trying to make a few extra
    buckz. here are some helpful tips to try. if you are a teen like me and
    your mom or dad give you lunch money everyday, try to save it. or say
    the prices went up like a buck. believe me alot of parents are stupid.
    then save theat money and go to school and beg for money and make up
    some story that yer parents aren't given you money anymore. try not to
    spend that money. like me, you will end up getting a bunch of ones
    everyday and then you will have a big wad. sometimes, girls dig that, if
    they see flipping threw alot of ones.

    or you could sell drugz, if ya wont to. but i don't. cuz i ain't about
    to get caught or nuttin like that.

    or if you have a friend that is big dick, steal his money.

    also a bunch of teacherz are real stupid at my school. they leave class
    to go to the bathroom before, durin', or after class. then is the perfect
    time to snag some of there money that you should be gettin. cuz we all
    put up wit the teacherz these dayz. they wont know what hit them. dont
    make a habit out this one, cuz soon they will catch on.

    another stealing money tip. just take the smallest billz possible, unless
    they have like phiv or more of the same bill. believe this snuff workz.
    try it and you will soon see how rich you may be.

    alwayz, try to store away some of this hard earned job. cuz remember,
    stealing is the most profitable job out there, unless you get caught.

    on and off the cursor. it can be helpful for sum programz.
