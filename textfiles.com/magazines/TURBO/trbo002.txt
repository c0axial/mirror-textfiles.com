.a$a. ___(intro for numba 2)_____________________________________________ .a$a.

      here is issue numba two. got bored again. my friends couldn't do
      anything. what dicks? most of them weren't home. i have a new
      format and style for the magazine. to imagine, i was just on irc
      just an hour ago and gave it to some people that liked it alot.

      they said it was better than p0rk!

      so i guess you could say that it is the other other white meat!

      anywayz, i ain't trying to compete wit you guyz at p0rk! actualy,
      in the first place i was gonna see if i could join you guyz, but
      decided to write my own.

      well, i have some kewl snuff to write about, as long as i can
      remember it all.


.a$a. ___(wings)_________________________________________________________ .a$a.

      this tv show rockz the big one. prolly the best one i watch, cept
      for wcw monday nitro (wrestling, figures!). for all of you that
      watch it, remember that chick helen, crystal bernard, which is
      fine. i wonder if anyone has pics of her. that means i have to get
      on the net again later tonight. well anywayz, she is a single women
      and currently working on a album by herself. maybe, i should send her
      some of my songs that i wrote (they kick, cuz i'm god!). she ain't
      gonna be single for long, cuz she'll be taken by me.


.a$a. ___(poker)_________________________________________________________ .a$a.

      everyone get there poker faces on! not really, but anywayz.

      phiv card draw is the easiest poker game out there to play. cept if
      you wanna play like 'go fish' or 'uno'. the easiest money maker out
      there is prolly hold 'em or a card game called 'between the sheets'.
      its not what it sounds.

      how to play between the sheets:
      two cards are dealt to each player and the object is to get a card
      that is in between these two cards. if you get it between the two
      cards, you win the pot, if not, then you dont get anything, cuz you
      plain out suck (not really, but you have no luck!). if more than
      one person gets it between there cards, then they split the pot,
      which majorly sucks some donkey ballz, but hey, you made some
      money.


.a$a. ___(babe of the month)_____________________________________________ .a$a.

      well the babe of the month for the month of november would have to
      be this girl that i like. her name is christen (she dont even
      know i like her, and i'm a lamer, cuz i'm like shy, thats why i bbs).
      she has long, silky blonde hair. shes only a freshman and has some
      growing to do. but she is so fine. to bad she has a boyfriend,
      which i will be able to take care of (lucky he goes to a different
      school, so when i get my guts out my stomach, i can mac on her).

      anywayz, i got sum kewl pics of demi moore and sandra bullock. it was
      tough to choose between the three of these beautiful women. but, it
      had to go to demi moore and the runner up is christen (which will be
      my future wife, i hope, get some balls and talk to her).

      anywayz, the babe of the month has been in many movies, like the
      scarlet letter, indocent proposal, disclosure and much more. jus
      can't think straight tonight.

      guess what? since i'm such a nice guy, i included in this issue of
      turbo the pics that i picked up of demi moore on the net. so don't
      jerk it to hard when you see them. she ain't that bad. so for you
      guyz that are gonna 'dis her pics, remember she is alwayz better
      than yer mom!

.a$a. ___(stephen king)__________________________________________________ .a$a.

      i think i will talk about stephen king. he writes the best books,
      cept there always to damn long, so i never get to finish them. too
      bad. maybe, next time i will just read the first chapter, then read
      the last chapter.


.a$a. ___(my x-mas list)_________________________________________________ .a$a.

.a$a. ___(couples at my school)__________________________________________ .a$a.

      damn! i get sick of all the couples at my school. they just grab
      each other out in the public. putting there hands down each others
      pants and up each others shirts. atleast they could go to the
      bathroom and do that shit. or maybe, i should rent out classrooms
      during school for them to do that snuff. then i would be rich.


.a$a. ___(jim carey)_____________________________________________________ .a$a.

      jim carey is the best comedy actor of all time. cuz he is. he gets
      paid for doing the stupidist snuff around that he makes up when he
      gets bored. ace ventura 2 jus came out and i still haven't been
      able to get to the movies and watch it. maybe this weekend or next.
      oh well, i heard this movie rockz and that makes me more despirate
      to go see it.

      he is funny in every movie. if it is a jim carey movie, its gonna
      be fun as hell.

      do you guyz remember when he was on In Living Color, that show
      wit all those black peoplez. he was dat fire marshall.


.a$a. ___(guess what?)___________________________________________________ .a$a.

      guess what? damn. forgot what i was gonna say. i guess this is
      really a space filler to take up space.


.a$a. ___(co2 bombs just rock)___________________________________________ .a$a.

                    how to make da co2 bombs

      you will have to use up the co2 cartridge 1st by either
      shooting it or whatever. wit a nail, force a hole bigger so as
      to allow the powder and wick to fit in easily. fill da cartridge
      wit black powdr and pak it in there real good by tappin' the
      bottom of the cartridge on a hard surface. insert da fuse.
      i recommend a good water-proof cannon fuse, or an m-80 type fuse,
      but firecracker fuses work, (if you can run like a black man runs
      from the cops after raping a white girl.) mow, light it and run
      like hell. it does wonders for a row of mailboxes (like da 1's
      in apartment complexes), a car (place under the gas tank), a
      picture window (place on window sill), a phone booth (place right
      under the phone), or any other devious place. this thing throws
      shrapnel, and can make quit a mess.


.a$a. ___(fast burning fuses)____________________________________________ .a$a.

      how to make da fast burning fuses
      (bout 40 inches per minute)

      materials needed:

      -x- Soft cotton string
      -x- fine black powder (empty a few shotgun shells!)
      -x- shallow dish or pan

      procedures:

      - moisten powder to form a paste-like substance
      - twist/braid three strands of cotton together
      - rub paste into string and allow to dry
      - check da burn rate...
