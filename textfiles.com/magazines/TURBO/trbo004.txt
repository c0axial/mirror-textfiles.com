<_bh_> first question.
<grimjack> sounds good to me....
<_bh_> why did you pick yer handle???

<grimjack> well, when i first started callin out, there was a comic book
         called grimjack i liked.... so i figured cool, it sounds cool...
         thats it.. :
<_bh_> what groups are you in???
<grimjack> heh, i figured as much.. :):) right now I'm in surge...
<grimjack> i'm sort of in anemia, but thats cause i was in suicide....
                     art scene over other scenes?
<_bh_> why did you pick the art scene over other scenes?
<grimjack> no real reason, i was a local little ansi artist, i joined a local
         group 'cause it was the thing to do.. :)
<grimjack> then i got my irc access and there it was.. teh ansi scene.. :)
<_bh_> thats kewl. i've been down that road a few times. actually quite a bit.
<grimjack> yeah, the ansi scene's pretty cool... people say its goin to hell,
         but i like it...
<_bh_> how old are you? and can you let the viewers of my 'zine know a lil
     about you and your life?
<grimjack> i'm 17, 18 in a few weeks..... i'm a freshman in college.. i go to
         uconn...
<grimjack> a computer science major (easy! :) and i've got a new girlfriend of
         about 2 weeks...
<_bh_> what do you do for fun?
<grimjack> fun?  anything i can really.. ;):) heh, hang with my g/f, play
         basketball if the weather lets me...
<_bh_> that reminds me, i like this chick, but she is like already taken and
     i'm in the situation of robert redford in indecent proposal.
<grimjack> listen to lots of music.. concerts.... all that.... :)
<grimjack> jsut saw king crimson this past saturday.. show rocked....
     sounds
<_bh_> that sounds like me.
<grimjack> kill the boyfriend, that's what i would do.. <g>
<_bh_> where do you live in the country?
<_bh_> lucky for me the bf goes to another school and she is fine as hell. <g>
<grimjack> i'm in connecticut, southwestern ct at home and northeastern ct at
         school..
<grimjack> heh, yeah, my g/f's cuter.. <g> :)
<_bh_> is there anything special that you would like to say to the readers in
     yer final words?
<grimjack> ummm.... final words... hmm..
<_bh_> heh, well this one has some growing to do, since she is a freshman in
     hs and i'm a junior in h.s
<grimjack> stay in groups dammit!  loyalty!  oh yeah, and nirvana sucks! :)
<_bh_> any advise to the readers, etc?
<grimjack> that should get me in trouble...
<grimjack> advise for readers... just keep drawing if you're into that... or
         whatever you do.. stick with it...
<grimjack> if you like it you'll get good at it..
<_bh_> so does that mean if i like girls, i get better at being a girl <g>...
<grimjack> i went out with a freshman my junior year.. loooong
         relationship....
<grimjack> lasted most the way through my senior year...
        at is about it for know
<grimjack> heh, well i like girls, and i got petter at picking them up.. close
         enough? :)
<_bh_> kewl. umm. why did you two break up?
<grimjack> which time?  we broke up and got back together five times.. .:)
are you for real. damn.
<grimjack> in the end, it was just too f'd up for me...
<_bh_> are you for real. damn.
<grimjack> .. and her father pulling a shotgun on me influenced my decision..
<grimjack> yeah, the whole thing was f'd up...
<grimjack> but like i stick with groups, i tend to stick with girls... <g>
<_bh_> umm. well. that must have sucked. do you think if there wasnt any probs
     between you and her and when you left for college, would there have
     been anything diff about the relationship
<grimjack> and i've left surge and came back to it twice too...
<_bh_> heheh...girls and groups are the same for ya, eh?
<grimjack> i wasnt' goin' out with her when i left, but i almost ended up
         back with her in october....
<grimjack> decided not to 'cause of the distance thing.. 60 miles was a long
         way.. .:)
<grimjack> well, treat a girl right, she'll treat you right.... same with a
         group i guess.. :)
<grimjack> or something.. <g>
<_bh_> damn. i guess you could say that. well, are you gonna grab the first 3
     issue of turb0
<grimjack> hell, if i'm in a mag it has to be good.. <g> :)
<_bh_> i guess. maybe, if we talk long enough, you might be the entire zine
     for issue numba 4
<grimjack> heh, then f0ur will be the shit, huh? :):)
<grimjack> damn, a whole mag just for me...
<_bh_> hell jeah.

     pissed when ld #'s show up.

<grimjack> hey, i gotta jet about now.. there's a cute girl i'm supposed to
         call..

<_bh_> umm. what do you believe is the proper way to treat a ladie (if you
     liked her and she was yers)
<grimjack> let me put it this way.. .
<grimjack> if you keep a girl happy, she'll keep you happy...
<_bh_> wow! heh...you readers, listen to that. do what the man says...<g>
<grimjack> that means you trreat her nicely, and she'll treat you.. :)
<grimjack> yeah, you'd be surprised how far 5 bucks worth of roses can go.. :)

  |____( a turkey story )____|

  here is a special turkey story from me to you. i'm jus thinkin up as
  i go, cuz i'm elite like that and dont forget that. grin.

  once upon a time there was this turkey named bob (you can spell bob
  backwards and it will be the same). anywayz, he wasnt fat at all,
  actualy a skrony lil thang like yer dog. anywayz, the owner said he
  needed to add sum weight. so bob da turkey at great for the next
  seven weeks (btw, anyone see the movie - seven) until one day.

  da owner came out of the house wit the sharpened ax. he had a big
  grin on his face. he either was gonna kill sumthang or he jus
  got laid by his wife, barney the dinosaur (you love me, i love you).

  well he took the turkey to the wooden stump. he was about to kill
  bob, when barney came out and said wait. so the owner said sure.
  barney came closer and the owner grabbed barney and shoved barney down
  and up'd barney a few times, then chopped off his head.

  bob thought he got off from being beheaded, but the owner grabbed him
  and shoved him down as he up'd him few times and the chopped off his
  head, wit the blood oozing out of the neck, wit the head on the ground.

  then the owners kidz came out and ...

  well i had to stop it there, cuz it would have gotten way way to nasty
  for you readers out there.

  we dont wont you to loose yer meals do we.


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |_____( lameness )_____|

  -x-phiv-x- cuz you eat chocalate covered toe jam
  -x-f0ur-x- you have six fingerz on one hand - oh jeah, yer jus a freak!
  -x-tres-x- cuz you dont know me
  -x-twoo-x- cuz i dont know you
  -x-onee-x- cuz you have more money than me and you aint givin me any

  rock, cuz if i find ya. i'll nuke ya wit da abomb.


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |_____( this issue )_____|

  why are you trying to drag this on? cuz i wanna.

  actually, i'm waiting for my mom to get ready, cuz she is taking me to
  her work, so i can steal top secret info. but she dont know that. so
  keep all of that a secret or else.

  lets see i'm currently writting on line numba 260. wow! lets see what the
  next line will be. guess what? its line numba 270. grin.


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  numba for his board get all of other issues of turb0 'zine. cuz its
  in one of those and right now i'm lazy, cuz its thanksgiving.

  |_____( should close this up )_____|

  well gues what. i'm not. grin


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |_____( might close this up )_____|

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |_____( greatness )_____|

  i would like to share my greatness wit ya. so join #ansi sumtime and
  like talk to me. or else.

  rememba i'm mr. perfect, mr. wonderful, da all mighty one, and god.
