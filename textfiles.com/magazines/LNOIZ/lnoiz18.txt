     Because of many unrelated reasons, one of them being a sudden
addictiveness to MU*s, Line Noiz hasn't put out an issue for a while, until
now....

     Line Noiz is finally back, and this time to stay...

     I've got a new system in place... We're all set up to put out issues
quickly... The new co-editor is Charles Leslie, he can be contacted at:
'cleslie1@ua1ix.ua.edu'

Know Jeff Minter?  You know, the guy that wrote Attack of the mutant
camels and Revenge of the mutant camels back in the good old CBM 64
days?  The Welsh loony that loves sheep, and Pink Floyd, and runs
Llamasoft?  Jeff used to have(?) a column in Commodore Computing
International, and back in June 1988 this article appeared (p64).

It didn't generate any fuzz.  I hardly noticed it myself.  Possibly one
of the reasons was that Jeff always entertained with some sort of
speculation about the future - most of them trash, all of them quite
wild.  But now, thinking about it, it is quite intriguing.

There was a piece about something almost similar back in Line Noiz 7,
but since I didn't have net access back then, I never commented it.
However I've drawn several ideas from this article for my "Tales of the
Book of Dreamscapes".

BTW:  I'm sure Billy would like you to submit any info you've got about
research in the areas mentioned in this article, wouldn't you, Billy?

OPINION by Jeff Minter

Jeff Minter postulates the God Program and Direct Neural Input, and
suggest reality may just be data fed to us by a computer...  As usual
the Welsh Hills are buzzing with ideas.


    Yow.  Hello again.  Suddenly, Spring has come to the Cych valley and
it's getting harder and harder to get any work done - I mean, you get up
and find that there's some groovy solar activity going on outdoors, so
why should you go sit in a semi-darkened room with your nose three
inches in front of a VDU all day?

    I've been well into the 'code, I've all but finished 'Space II'
after a year of work (!) and I've just got the macro-load and some final
debug to do.  I'm aiming for completed code to show at the Atari Show in
two weeks time.  THEN I have to write the documentation, which is going
to be a Big Task...  I've been relaxing with 'Sidewinder' on th'Amiga,
ZAP ZAP KERPOW or what???  I love it!!  I've also resurrected a
once-flagging Arkanoid addiction, but my Game of the Month isn't on the
Amiga, it's Fantasy Zone II on the Sega [and this J.M.  dared to write
in a Commodore magazine...  PP].  If you thought FZI was trippy, Wait'll
you see FZII!

    This month, I've decided on a little more SF-type speculation on the
possible futures available to us as the relentless tide of micro
progress continues.  With my piece on the Atari Discovery machine, I was
looking just tens of years ahead.  If you look a couple hundred years
ahead, and allow for parallel advances in other technologies as well,
the future begins to look a LOT more startling...

    Within 200 years, we can all be gods.

    I've made passing mention of the God Program before.  Here's how it
COULD work...

    First, we need some fundamental understanding of how the human brain
functions.  Specifically, we need to isolate the five sensory input
channels and find out how they are encoded.  This isn't as far-fetched
as it might seem; I'm not saying that we need to find out anything
unduly complex, like how thought works, or how the brain stores memory;
we need to look at (for example) the signal coming out of the optic
nerve and find out how that signal corresponds to the image received by
the retina.  Eyes and ears are not themselves as complex as the brain;
they're complex electro-mechanical devices, and with enough research we
may just find out how they encode the data they receive.

    Okay, let's postulate that we found out how the sense are encoded.
The next stage is direct neural input - instead of looking at a screen
with an image on it, the computer could be hooked directly into the
optic nerve and the image data from the machine encoded such that the
brain interprets it directly.  Graphics on such a system would replace
'normal' vision and have 'perfect' resolution - that is, anything the
brain is capable of resolving, you would see.  The pixel would be a
thing of the past.

    Extrapolate this idea to cover the rest of the senses and you have
fivechannel DNI. Hook this up to a really powerful computer running an
advanced version of the World Simulator which I described in the Atari
article. You've just created yourself a personal reality.

    (I had an argument with a chap down the pub about DNI. I was trying
to explain the whole God concept, and he kept saying 'but it wouldn't
be REAL!' But what is reality? All we use to function, all we have to go
on, is the flow of data coming in over our five sensory channels. Our
entire perception of the world boils down to as series of nerve impulses
from our sense organs. Replace all five channels with DNI input, and
that input becomes reality. It IS reality).

    Now, allow us to communicate with the computer that's generating our
new reality. If we want to go really far-out, we can postulate
'mind-control' - you think of something, the computer assesses your
thoughts and generates whatever you require. Of course, this requires a
little more than decoding of the sense inputs - to do thoughtcontrol
you've got to understand what thoughts are, and that's likely to be a
little difficult, at least at first. There are simpler ways - for
example, sample the outputs from the brain to the motor nerves and feed
this back into the computer, and any action you attempt to make with
your 'real' body will be reflected in the actions of your 'simulated'
body, and you can forget the necessity of any 'mindreading' by the
controlling computer. You tell the computer what to do by traditiional
human methods of communication - voice, written word, whatever.

    So now we have our own reality, we can move around in it and
communicate with the machine generating it. You want to fly? Just ask
the computer. You want a world with purple skies, populated entirely
with intelligent llamas? [Jeff probably would... PP] Ask the machine and
it will be given. (For a pretty good idea of what it could be like, I
would recommend Moorcock's 'Dancers at the End of Time' books).

   Fine, we're nearly gods - we have our own worlds and we can do
anything we want within them - but we still lack one characteristic of
godhood - Immortality. We're still dependent on our 'real' bodies here
in the 'real' world.

    So - and this is something I have talked about before at
considerable length - we use neural-net-image transfer to place our
functioning brainstate within the controlling computer and discard the
animal shell. Place the whole system in orbit and power it from the Sun,
and you're as near as dammit immortal.

    Okay, this is getting pretty far-out, but even simple one-channel
DNI would be pretty amazing, and given that study of the brain yields
some useful results, I don't see why at least some of these ideas
shouldn't come to pass. This could be the 'next stage' of human
evolution - each man a God [anyone remembers Nietsches Uebermensch? PP]

    (And who say that the reality we currently enjoy isn't being fed to
us all by some computer? I can just imagine the program listing: 10 LET
e=MC^2)...

    Back to the real world. Me for a fag and a cup of tea and sit in the
sun by the' stream of a bit. Enjoy your individual realities.

                                  Cyberpunk



What does the word mean to you... Is it JUST a literary movement, or is it
a new net.culture emerging in the technological underground?

Well, the media thought it was... For a while, Cyberpunk was the hype, the
latest craze, the newest buzz-word... The media considered it a high-tech
punk image of a rebel in a new-age society...

Maybe they were wrong.

Or maybe, they were closer than people thought...


Theory 1: Cyberpunk exists, but it's distorted, heavily. Lucky, most people 
who still believe in cyberpunk, have very developed opinions on the subject, 
most of which make sense...

In article <CtvCo6.4G6@freenet.carleton.ca> you write:
>Do you think that CyberPunk still exists as a culture??

Nope. Mainly because the "culture" of CyberPunk has grown around the idea,
rather than the idea growing from the people. A bunch of people naming
themselves after a badly-defined literary movement, than not being able to
define themselves does not a culture (or even a sub-culture) make.  The
hi-tech, lo-life ideals of Cyberpunks are primarily being propogated by
the middle-classes, holding onto their middle-class ideas, but allured
by the sleaze of life on the streets.

Read my own story Monkeytrick to get a further idea of this in action.

Yes.
I go to Science Fiction conventions all the time, in many places.
I see folks who both play for the weekend, or are living it all the time
(rather like the SCA).
Also, just look at the folks in the VR community.
There are starting to be a set of suits,
but many of the original, and a lot of the new folks,
are nerds who live by the maxim *the street finds its own uses*
The drugs are a bit more underground, due to the draconian
and totalitarian laws now in force
(1 in 6 US federal prisoners are in for pot, most for 10 years or LIFE
for minor amounts (one guy is in for LIFE for 0.16 grams!!!!)
- see the August 1994 issue of Atlantic Monthly - part 1 of a 2 part series).

I know there might be those who would draw a big line between nerds
and cyberpunk, but it really is just a spectrum.

        In a somewhat diluted form, yes. It's watered down unless you
know where to look for it and I don't mean at cafe wim or Zaphod's either.
It's all messed up, people who claim that just because they've read a few
books and buy Mondo 2000 that they are cyberpunk. Horse shit.

In a previous article, ae687@FreeNet.Carleton.CA (Billy Biggs) says:

>Do you think that CyberPunk still exists as a culture??

        I would say yes...and there are a number of proofs around. A most
recent one is the fact that the Vangelis just released the Original
Soundtrack of Bladerunner, and it is selling like hot cakes! Many of the
local stores are having a hard time keeping it in stock...I had to pick
mine up in Montreal! Another good example is WIRED magazine...the most
successful magazine launch in recent history. It caters to an upscale
cyberpunk audience. Cyberpunk books still sell well. Movies based upon
Cyberpunk works are in production...on the SF echoes on Fidonet, it is
still one of the more popular subjects of debate. The Ottawa Cyberpunk
Music and Culture echoes are going strong (you can access them on my BBS,
Solsbury Hill (613) 820-9545). I still get stopped on the street by people
who remember me from the Cyberpunk Article the Citizen ran over a year
ago. And the newsgroup, alt.cyberpunk, still generates huge amounts of
traffic.

Personally, I believe it has mutated into more than cyberpunk, crossing into
the mainstream yet still being underground, if such a thing is possible.

>Do you think that CyberPunk still exists as a culture??

Do I think hippies still exist as a culture (after 30 years),
yes, of course.  Same goes for CP.. culture doesn't just die out
over night.

Whether it is slowing up.. I think it must be, otherwise the
media wouldn't be making such hype about it.  As an underground
culture, when it comes above ground, the people that were _really_
part of it will move off to something else.

The whole thing with CP was that it was always really different..
if everyone is going on about it, how can it be different?

Cyberpunk _never_ existed as a culture, for the simple reason that
no one who fits into the fictional model of a "cyberpunk" would be
caught dead hanging with anyone lame enough to visit cyberpunk "clubs"
or read cyberpunk "zines."

: Do you think that CyberPunk still exists as a culture??

I dunno about that...but I'm friggin' tired of all those media bits with
titles like `Is this a wrong turn on the Information Super Highway', and
I'm getting tired of Wired (not that I ever read it).  Perhaps CyberPunk
will exist as a `culture' (something I really don't consider it to be in
the first place) much like Hippies do, in small VW vans.
I don't really even know why I read the alt.cyberpunk.  And now some guys
saying' my provider is to slow.  To slow?!? It's got some pauses here and
there, but I don't' expect it to be rockit fast.  I mean shit, it's got to
be one of the (if not _the_) biggest dial-ups' in town.  Definitely the
`classic' dial up.

Now, respect for Bill and all, but Aliens 3 sounds like something I would

lets go for high body count Rambo meets Aliens. Sure Aliens ^3 wasn't as
good as II but it was getting back to the original, suspenseful style of
alien... which had more style than all of them until the final Guy in a suit

Must say that Blade Runner is the film that defines my experiences of
youth, along with Pink Floyd The Wall. Thought Daryl Hannah was hot,
and Roy Batty ... psychotic!!

Neuromancer is the thing I remember best about my honeymoon. Says something.

Now cyberpunk is just nostalgia. Wish i had net access back when it was
all happening, instead of reading about the Gen Xers discovering it
posthumously.

At least I have a convenient definition for the whole teenage experience...
and it can all be packaged up and sold to me all over again.

Did it ever?  I guess it depends on how you determine what is a culture
and what is a fad.  Many of us that think along similar lines do not
want to be classified as anything different than the norm, because
then we stand out more.  We are still working towards the future
with the same beliefs and worldview we had before the fad was given
the name cyberpunk.

>Do you think that CyberPunk still exists as a culture??

No. I don't think cyberpunk exists *yet* as a culture. Unless you
equate the kind of stuff Case does in Neuromancer with someone
listening to Ministry while ftp'ing the latest issue of Phrack.

If you're asking, is there still a subculture that manifests itself
in an interest in hacking, industrial or metal or techno music, and
a certain type of SF novel, announce a William Gibson signing and
you'll have your answer: yes.

If you're asking, is there a subculture of people who specialize in
finding and distributing electronic information through illegal
means for corporate customers, acting as high-tech equivalents of
bank robbers or private eyes and wallowing in a high tech lowlife
of neural implants etc, then the answer would be no. Not yet.

IOW, without a single widely shared definition of cyberpunk, your
question can't be easily answered.

        I don't know when or why or how the Cyberpunk subculture became a
private club that allowed only the right kinda people in..<those
who wear the right kinda clothes, owned the right kinda music, and
looked and spoke the right kinda way>.  I have seen here on this news net
great discussion of who IS and who ISN'T cyberpunk. ==> WHY? <==
I do not know...or care.  Abraham Lincoln said that "A house divided
cannot stand."  Well... that was then, and this is now.
        Screw "CyberPunk" the term is outdated and it's time it died.
"Cyberpunk" has become the "IN" word for wanna bees and look alikes who
claim a stake in CyberSpace.  Forget that game!
I played that song in HighSchool with the Preppies.  Today  Polo shirts,
Polo cologne and duckhead pants have been replaced with leather jackets,
all black outfits, cigarettes and microwave dinners.  Some of you people
are trying to HARD to be "punk" and are being quite successful.  The
standards of "Cyberpunks" have been lowered to far. To think that you
could sit there behind your terminals arguing that Christians cannot be
Cyberpunk.  GET A CLUE FOLKS!
        There are bigger things then this going on in the world.
Governments are tottering on collapse.  People are dying in the streets
of YOUR hometown.  Did you hear about the guy in Texas that went into the
shopping mall with a gun and opened fire?? DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU PEOPLE
WONDER WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE WORLD??
        But the questions here will be..was he a Catholic? a Black? a
Whitey? a Pagan?  DOES IT MATTER?? NO! He was nuts... that's all that
counts.
        So like I said.... SCREW "Cyberpunk". I'm branching off on my own
path and I don't care WHO follows..or what religion they are.
        CALL ME A TECHNOCRAT.  I believe in the freedom of information.
I believe in the power of the human spirit and of the human mind.  I
believe that through technology ALL people can and will learn more about
themselves.... I believe that everyone has the right to live the way they
wanna...so long as they don't infringe on the rights of others.    and I
believe that every person here has the capability to go into that local
mall with a shot gun and pull that trigger......YES, that scares me; AND
AT THE SAME TIME IT TURNS ME ON.
                This is not about what kind of clothes you wear..or what
kind of music you listen to.  This is about the future....and how we as
HOMO SAPIENS are going to survive when there is so much working against
us.
        Take a look at society.  Take a look at yourself.    Take a look
at what it is you really believe. Then declare yourself free of this
societal game the "Cyberpunks" are playing.  You're above that.  You're
a person...an individual..not some cast iron soldier that just fell out
of some mold.
        You're an individual with ideas, beliefs, needs and wants,
feelings and emotions.  That makes you special. THAT makes you a TechnoCrat.

        Exactly, but TechnoCrat has been predicted in WiReD magazine so it's
not original, as a matter of fact it was used to describe EXACTLY what
cyberpunk is becoming, a watered down, leather jackets and e-mail fad.
I believe that through technology the mind will finally be able to reach its
potential, and that at that point the human spirit will be free to do as it
should, and not be limited by the world around it.

        PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't do that, PLEASE don't tell people what makes
them a TechnoCrat, it just makes you another Jesus, telling people to wake up
and then making another bed for them to lie in.  Don't give them anything to

see where this thread goes after that effort.

Here, here. Though I must admit the cyberpunk aesthetic does appeal to me,
the elitism i have seen here does not. Don't label me cyberpunk, i don't
want to be grouped in w/ those who delude themselves into being hot-stuff.
Cyberpunks have given hackers a bad name. When people like Billy Idol can
learn to type "dir" or "ls" or double click, <all w/ 1 finger no less> and call
themselves 'Cyberpunks' or even 'hackers' then something is wrong w/ your
definition.
     Cyberpunk has come full circle, it started out as *FICTION* with the works
of Gibson, or perhaps even Brunner, later turned into reality, (virtual or
otherwise) and has now become what it once wuz: FICTION.

Don't call me a TechnoCrat, don't call me a CyberPunk, Just call me
"Johnny Fusion" for that is who i am. (its ok to call me a hacker if you
insist)

        Nothing in life, sir, is more than a label.  People gives names
to all things. -Some names nicer then others.

"I think that people in power should be MUCH MUCH more afraid of my views

        This is EXACTLY my point. And a coalition of INDIVIDUALS would be
even scarier no??

" Well I found my clue.. I still like to hack upon the realities of

        Only through observing and questioning the obvious can we arrive
at the bare minimum of TRUTH that lies within.

"Exactly, but TechnoCrat has been predicted in WiReD magazine so it's not

        As I only own two issues of Wired.. neither of which I have
bothered to read... I was unaware that "TechnoCrat" was a term someone
had already coined and used for the exact opposite of what I believe in.
IT'S JUST A TITLE.  after all...a rose by any other name would smell just
as sweet.

"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't do that, PLEASE don't tell people what makes
them a TechnoCrat, it just makes you another Jesus, telling people to
wake up and then making another bed for them to lie in."

        I'm no Jesus.  Just another plain Joe Sixpack out here in
CyberSpace...speaking his mind.  and I was telling people what makes ME a
TechnoCrat.  No two people I have ever met fit into EXACTLY the same
mold.  I don't expect to be able to sit here and dictate who fits into
what category and why <remember..that was done already by the
cyberpunks.?>

"Hacking one culture and then laying the foundation for another to follow
the exact same path is not the way you should go."


As Robert Frost so aptly put it... "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
                                    I took the one less traveled by,
                                    And that has made all the difference."
I did not pave this path I tread.  I simply walk upon it...so that others
soon may follow.

beings are at the root of every title, name or classification that one

this book "Technocracy, Inc."  OH WELL.  The point is that my beliefs
will remain the same no matter WHAT TITLE I CHOOSE.  Be I a "cyberpunk"
or a "TechnoCrat" or even a "FyberStront".... the name does not
matter.... I think perhaps that we all need to look beyond the surface of
things; maybe then we can understand what things REALLY mean.

Let's face the music, folks, cyberpunk was first a science fiction genre
and then a style, a pose to adapt while wearing the right
clothes/accessories.   And this fellow had the courage to say "screw
this" (for which I say, let's strike a medal) but then created (with
the best of intentions I'm sure) another label to be popularized,
commercialized, etc, etc.  Let's drop all the fucking labels, abandon the
quest to be hipper-than-thou, disband this newsgroup, and go do something
worthwhile (I leave the definition of "worthwhile" to you, you individuals
and free-thinkers out there)
Don't get me wrong, I love my Gibson and Sterling too, but come on,
folks... this whole thing has degenerated beyond redemption.

    A Virus has been discovered on Internet that is disguised as
    CD-ROM shareware.

    Unknown hackers have illegally put the Chinon name on a destructive
    shareware file and released it on the Internet. This catastrophic
    virus is named "CD-IT". -- DO NOT DOWNLOAD. IT WILL CORRUPT YOUR
    HARD DRIVE.  The program, allegedly a shareware PC utility that
    will convert an ordinary CD-ROM drive into a CD-Recordable (CD-R)
    device, which is technically impossible, instead destroys critical

Subject: Ontario Government Computers: Prudes Veto Vulgarity in Cyberspace

This message is being posted anonymously, on behalf of
a Canadian reporter, somewhere in the vicinity of Toronto.


Ontario Government Computers: Prudes Veto Vulgarity in Cyberspace

by Steven Cooper

Environmental dudes can now jack-in to a new electronic database, but beware.
These Ontario government computers know if you're been naughty or nice!
And they know where you live ...

As part of Ontario's Environmental Bill of Rights,
citizens can now access environmental policies and other info in cyberspace.
Just point your modem at (416) 327-3000 (or 1-800-667-9979 outside Toronto).
If you're on Internet, telnet to 192.75.156.92 ... But mind your language!

When you first connect, the interface seems pleasant enough:

        Welcome, newcomer!  You have logged on to the
        Government of Ontario Information System.

        Before going into that, though, let's get acquainted.
        If you'll tell us a little bit about yourself, we'll create
        an account for you.

It seems rather nosy, asking you for personal information like:
address, phone number, place of work, etc., but what the heck.
Then it asks for a "password" --- just a little digital secret between you
and this box of circuits in some government basement.
The computer warns that if you forget the password you'll be "up the creek"
-- so make sure it's memorable.
Faced with this predicament, I paused, pondering potential passwords,
while my pet pussy purred peacefully in my lap.
Hmmm, how about "pussy" -- that should be easy to remember.

Suddenly the government computer turns nasty on me!

        Come on now, there's no need to be vulgar about it.
        Please enter a more wholesome password.

Huh? After an awestruck moment, I laughed out loud.
Then, after a few more moments, it hit me like a ton of bricks.

The Ontario government has developed an official database it consults to
determine which words are "vulgar" and which words are "wholesome",
and this database is built into this government computer's software.
Ann Landers step aside!  The Ontario Government has codified what
is proper etiquette on the information highway.

With the aid of a computer hacker, whose identity cannot be revealed,
this reporter has obtained "access" to the government's computer (a 486/66 PC)
and its official "nasty words" list.
In the electronic world of 0's and 1's, this computer classifies
all words as either Vulgar or Wholesome -- there is no middle ground.
My hacker companion assured me that the same cybernetic censor
that vetoes vulgarity in private passwords could easily be applied
to the bits and bytes of private electronic correspondence
whizzing through the links in Ontario government networks
to automatically ensure politeness in digital discourse.


        Ontario Government Quick Reference Table

        uterus                  womb
        whore                   hooker
        faggot                  nigger

The Ontario government has some quirky ideas about proper language.
For example, did you know that in polite company, computer hackers
are advised not to use fellatio or whore, but rather to use the more wholesome
terms blowjob and hooker.  Apparently the government thinks
getting a hardon while surfing the net is a no-no.  Be cool, be flaccid.
Still, I think the experts are a but confused.  It is okay to masturbate
while on-line, as long as you don't have an orgasm or ejaculate.
I checked, yup, blue balls are wholesome.

For some reason, there is still not equality of the sexes.
According to the government's language experts,
vaginas are more wholesome than penises.
On the other hand, cocks are in, cunts are out.
... and no foreskins allowed.  Circumcisions - yes.  Ouch!

Some of it just seems childish.  We can poop and tinkle
in CyberSpace.  But shit or piss ?  No can do.
Even my doctor would be considered rude.  He couldn't use
defecate or urinate.  Even scrotum needs to be replaced by the more
wholesome "testicle pouch".
One really gets the impression the government's nerdish programmer's
are more familiar with barbie-doll boobs than real breasts.
Tits are fine, as long as they don't have nipples.

Although the Ontario government and its computers seem
mostly obsessed with words, even clinical terms, having to do with
sex or genitalia, there are some recent additions.
Perhaps because of the new same-sex marriage laws in Ontario,
the term "faggot" is now considered vulgar.
Unfortunately, "nigger" is still on the wholesome list.

If you have any questions about the new environmental computer that
acts like a self-appointed expert on computer etiquette,
just call Michael Seto at (416) 323-5190.
He helped install the new government information system.
Maybe he'll know why beavers are more wholesome than pussies,
according to this Ontario government computer.

Subject: JAMMER plans

Hi all:

Well, here it is.  I finally got around to creating an e-mail compatible
schematic for the X-band RADAR jammer that I've talked with some of you
about.  Sorry about the delay, but it wasn't easy getting this thing
drawn-especially without the benefit of a scanner. I had originally
planned to charge $5.00 for the plans, (I should have since I spent about
5 hours getting the schematic into the computer) but I decided not to
charge members of my "electronic neighborhood." (Ain't that sweet??!)
HOWEVER, if anyone is feeling TERRIBLY GUILTY about all the WORK I put
into this thing, feel free to send in your $5.00 "registration" fee.
(heh,heh,heh, yeah right Kurt.  Find Vanna you need to buy a clue!)

This is a UUencoded zip file.  So you have to UUdecode it, then unzip it
with PKunzip 2.04.  The file name is Jammer.pcx after you unzip it.
Hopefully everyone has something they can view a PCX file with.

The most difficult part to find is the GUNN diode.  I used to have a few
of them, but they were all sold.  You should be able to find one for
around $35.00 to $50.00.  Most of the other parts are junk box or Rat
Shack items.  One exception is the NTE291 transistor. Any electronic parts
house should have one.  You should put some sort of a heat sink on the
transistor BTW.

Have fun.  Remember, even if you don't jam any RADAR, it's still great fun
to set off those truckers RADAR detectors! ; )

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

"Unfortunately, because we are defendants in this lawsuit, beyond our own
press release, which is attached, we are not at liberty to reply to all the
charges and allegations in the American Buddhist posting about Christine
Comaford's suit.

Suffice it to say that we believe the original Lenz article was extremely
well researched, and that we intend to vigorously protect our First
Amendment rights against the assault by a cult which has been the subject
of intensive media scrutiny. The only people trying to limit First
Amendment rights in this case are the Lenz cult itself, which is trying to
use the power of the courts to intimidate the press." - Louis Rossetto,
Editor and Publisher, WIRED.


WIRED Appalled at Accusations of Libel
**************************************

Intends to vigorously defend itself in Comaford case.


SAN FRANCISCO -- June 14, 1994 -- Award-winning WIRED magazine announced
today its intentions to vigorously fight recent charges of libel by a
computer consulting firm.

In the January 1994 issue, WIRED carried a story on the activities of Dr.
Frederick P. Lenz III, an alleged cult leader whose activities are coming
under increasing media scrutiny. Included in the article was a mention of
Christine Comaford of Chicago-based Corporate Computing Inc. An associate
of Mr. Lenz, Ms. Comaford has filed suit in Chicago claiming libel.

"WIRED believes this lawsuit is without merit," said Editor and Publisher
Louis Rossetto. "We intend to fight it vigorously."

WIRED Managing Editor John Battelle added, "The Lenz article is in the best
tradition of the First Amendment, in that it discusses an issue of real
public concern. Lenz and his followers have invited public and media
scrutiny, and we reported and commented on an issue of interest to our
readers."

WIRED, the journal of the Digital Revolution, is winner of the 1994
National Magazine Award for General Excellence, the highest honor in
magazine journalism, presented by the American Society of Magazine Editors.

This is NOT a hoax - anybody that's familiar with my reputation knows I'm
not in the joking business when it comes to the business end of the industry.

"COMPUTER FIRM SHUTTING DOWN"

Commodore International: The personal computer pioneer plans to liquidate
its assets.

By Dinah Wisenberg Brin
The Associated Press

   WEST CHESTER, Pa. - Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the
personal computer industry, said late Friday it is going out of business.
   The company plans to transfer its assets to unidentified trustees "for
the benefit of its creditors" and has placed its major subsidiary, Commodore
Electronics Ltd., into voluntary liquidation.
   "This is the initial phase of an orderly voluntary liquidation of both
companies," Commodore said in a brief statement.
   Company executives could not immediately be reached Friday evening.
   The company last month reported an $8.2 million loss for the quarter
ending Dec. 31 on sales on $70.1 million. A year earlier, Commodore lost
$77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million in the same period.
   In the latest report, Commodore said its financial limits had thwarted its
ability to supply products, leading to weakened sales. One of its new
products, the Amiga CD32 video game, had sold poorly in Europe, where the
company did most of its business.
   The company's net worth turned negative in the fiscal year ended last
June 30.
   Its stock, which had traded at around $3 per share before the quarterly
results were announced last month, closed unchanged at 87.5 cents oer share
on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.
   "This is a company that briefly captured the attention of the American
market and didn't know where the market was going," said David Coursey,
editor of the newsletter P.C. Letter in San Mateo, Calif. "They just never
managed to change with the marketplace."
   While grabbing some market share and attention in the late 1970s,
Commodore's products were something between PCs and game machines, "and
never quite became either," Coursey said.
   Commodore started 40 years ago as a typewriter repair company in the
Bronx. Its extension to the adding machine business paved the way for it
to make calculators and then personal computers in the mid-1970s.
   Commodore competed with Radio Shack for the first computers sold to
homes and co-founded Jack Tramiel became a highly regarded figure in the
fledgling PC industry.
   By the early 1980s, it was overshadowed in the PC business by Apple
Computer Inc. and IBM. Software manufacturers didn't create as much
software for Commodore's Amiga line as it did for Apple and IBM-compatible
machines.
   In recent years, most of Commodore's business was in Europe.

Yup, there is an article in today's (Tuesday's) Irish Times to the same effect.
"After Wall Street closed its doors on Friday night, Commodore put its US
operations into voluntary liquidation. It had already announced losses of $356
million for the 1993 financial year, yet despite substantially slashing its
operating costs the cash continued to seep away."

The article continues for half a page. There should be more info on the
comp.amiga.* newsgroups.

  Ok..I've seen enough about how good PC & MACS are...Take a look at this
  information regarding the AAA Chipset (Amiga Advanced Architecture),
  and be ready to once again be set back by the power of Amiga.
  Of course, most know that Commodore went out of business, but too
  little know that Amiga really was separate from Commodore anyway...
  Several companies at the moment are in the courts, bidding on who will
  take over Amiga's Licensing, and continue to develop the Amiga..
  Just before Commodore decided to call it quits, the engineers had
  already come to the completion of the A5000. Below are the specs.
  on the AAA Chipset, minus the CPU specs. The CPU at the time was
  being debated upon. It will indeed be a RISC processor, but one
  will be needed to handle the workload of the AAA Chipset...So far
  I believe the PowerPC chip was being considered...Anyhow here's
  what's been released......

   thanks go to Jim Redfield, Ed Hepler.
 o AAA is largely compatible with ECS
 o AA registers are not supported in AAA
 o ECS compatibility is to be eliminated
 o CPU bus can master the entire chip bus for more efficient CPU to
   CHIP bus access

 MEMORY BAND WIDTH
 -----------------
 AAA chips run a 4 cycle burst to Chip RAM, i.e. 4.56 x ECS or
 1.14 times AGA's two-cycle burst
 Bursts of up to 512 words can be run to keep up with hi-res
 displays.

 CPU BANDWIDTH
 -------------
 CPU access to Chip RAM is improved.
 AAA chips manage an asynchronous interface to the CPU.
 CPU with some extra support logic can completely master the
 AAA chip RAM bus, allowing Chip RAM access as fast
 as today's 32-bit Fast RAM.

 CPU BUS DMA
 -----------
 AAA chip bus DMA activity is dynamically managed.
 40 DMA channels, with dynamic allocation between BLITTER -> CPU

 BLITTER
 -------
 AAA blitter is much faster
 It scrolls 640x200x2 6 times the speed, 640x200x4  9 times faster
  than the old blitter.
 It has a 32-bitmode which operates in pixel addressing and can
  handle the chunky modes as well (2,4,8,16 bits)
 Line draw has auto-clipping.
 Blitter has arithmetic function now like "sort" and "tally" at
  any pixel depth,
  addition, average, subtracting, saturated subtractions, etc
 blitter speeds;
   DRAM single
  2 planes @ 640x200 = 489.06 frames/sec
  16 planes @ 640x200 = 41.61 frames/sec
  2 planes @ 800x560 = 124.54 frames/sec
  8 planes @ 800x560 = 14.96 frames/sec
   VRAM single
  2 planes @ 640x200 = 504.23 frames/sec
  16 planes @ 640x200 = 56.78 frames/sec
  2 planes @ 800x560 = 124.54 frames/sec
  8 planes @ 800x560 = 14.96 frames/sec

 COPPER
 ------
 Copper handles 32-bit operations
 Supports move-multiple
 Copper has interrupt capability, let it receive ints from blitter

 GRAPHICS
 --------
  single Chipset system:
  DRAM system: 800x560x9 planes
  VRAM system: 800x560x13 planes or 800x560x24 using "hybrid pixels"
  dual chipset system:
  DRAM system: 1280x1024x5 planes
  VRAM system: 1280x1024x8 planes or 1024x768x24 using "hybrid pixels"
 sprites are now 128 pixels wide.
 16 planes supported, 8-bit playfields
 AAA pixel clock is no longer ties to the AAA bus clock
 pixel clocks can be scaled

 NEW MODES:
  HAM10
  HALF-CHUNKY - 2, 4 or 8 bit dephs
  CHUNKY - 16 bits (5bit guns) no palette
  HYBRID - 24 bits, separate chunky planes
  PACKLUT - 2 bits per pixel decompress to 8-bit half
  chunky
     in 4x4 pixel regions, each region has  colors,
     8-bit values indexed thru CLUT and 16 pixels
  PACKHY  - 4 bits per pixel decompress to 24-bit direct
  pixels
     in 4x4 pixel regions, each region has  colors
     24-bit direct values and sixteen pixels

 VIDEO CAPTURE
 -------------
 AAA pixel bus is reversed, (ONLY ON VRAM), capture to chunky mode.

 SOUND
 -----
 64khz with 16-bit resolution
 8 channels, both sides  i.e. 1 channel on both sides with diff volume
 8-bit audio sampling is also supported

 FLOPPY DISKS
 ------------
 2 or 4 megs per disks direct, no tricks to it!!
 built in decoding hardware  MFM,  (RLL2,7), Biphase Mark
(CD-ROM)
 xfer in track, sector and CD-MODE and a high speed track mode
 xfer rate is 20x faster 11.4 Mbit/sec from 0.5 Mbit/sec though
  DMA peek is 9.9Mbit/sec
 hardware can decode IBM format as well
 Mac format supported as well with software

 UART
 ----
 2 UARTS are supported, 4-byte FIFO

 AAA chips descriptions

The vinyl version consists of four 12-inchers.  Each side has three tracks,
except side 2 of record 4 has only two (the last two tracks: 22 & 23).
So, everything is like 1-3,4-6,7-9,...,19-21,22-23.

ANYWAY...THE PLAY-BY-PLAY:

(1) is fairly chill-out.  Not like the dance 12" of 'Environ-Mentally' by
Microglobe.  (2) is pretty bizarre...funky chill-out.  (3) moves us into
four-on-the-floor minimal, soft trance.  (4) gets a bit acidic, but lacks
anything human.  Repetitious, minimal...just plain boring.  The second half
of the track adds a really strange acid-cat-meow...very weird.  (5) brings us
back to chill-out...at it's best!  (6) returns to acid trance.  The steady
paced repetition which seems to dominate this compilation as far as its
trance tracks.  This track has a nice sound, though...cool to chill to, or
trance out to on the dance floor...nothing energetic though.  (7) has a happy
feel...dancey, w/vocals.  (8) Dave Angels soft trance.  (9) Eat Static adds
a little bit off energy for dancing with this one.  Not very repetitious...
it has plenty of crests...changes...and a garden of sounds.  (10) Neat under-
water sounding acid...dance underwater!  (11) dance and bear it.  (12) has
some decent acid sounds...but there's an ANNOYING vocal "in the afterworld...
in the afterworld....in the afterworld....in the..."  UGH!! shoot her.
(13) trots through LOTS of water/watery-sounds...GREAT ambient chill-out as
is (14) which has samples of conversations (from a scanner...) while a type
some wonderful music & sounds make a soundtrack to them.  (15) continues the
ambiance with some bleepy melodies, a frenchman, and soft funky beats.
(16) is rather slow four-on-the-floor with melancholy chords and acid bleeps.
(17) is also slow, but with fast hihats...sorta locomotive sounding.  (18)
speeds up into housey trance...but it's still not keeping me awake at this
late hour.  (19) is even faster...with a decent, building acidline.  (20) also
has plenty of resonance...along with echoes, garden of reverbed sounds, but
not enough hype for the floor.  (21) is VERY similar to Locust.  (22) Hardfloor
could do better.  (23) has some indian chants, to a fast indian sounding beat,
but the newwave/pop sound to it just makes it sound dopey...I tend to like
tribal that is more...well...tribal...naturally.

OVERALL:  The ambient tracks are definitely AWESOME...probably the only
things worth while on this compilation.  All the trance tracks are minimal,
soft, repetitious...not that that's bad...that's trance... but, I personally
prefer stuff to excite the crowd on a dance floor.

I give it 6 or 7 out of 10.

I'm exchanging mine for a NEW one as this one has a skip, and I'll be SELLING
it.  BRAND NEW, UNOPENED TRANCE EUROPE EXPRESS 2 for $18 (includes postage).
$15 without the booklet.

EPIC Seeks Wiretap Data


             Electronic Privacy Information Center

                          PRESS RELEASE
  _____________________________________________________________

For Release:
August 9, 1994
2:00 pm

            Group Seeks Release of FBI Wiretap Data,
      Calls Proposed Surveillance Legislation Unnecessary

     Washington, DC:  A leading privacy rights group today sued
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to force the release of
documents the FBI claims support its campaign for new wiretap
legislation.  The documents were cited by FBI Director Louis Freeh
during testimony before Congress and in a speech to an influential
legal organization but have never been released to the public.

     The lawsuit was filed as proposed legislation which would
mandate technological changes long sought by the FBI was scheduled
to be introduced in Congress.

     The case was brought in federal district court by the
Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest
research organization that has closely monitored the Bureau's
efforts to mandate the design of the nation's telecommunications
infrastructure to facilitate wiretapping.  An earlier EPIC lawsuit
revealed that FBI field offices had reported no difficulties
conducting wiretaps as a result of new digital communications
technology, in apparent contradiction of frequent Bureau claims.

     At issue are two internal FBI surveys that the FBI Director
has cited as evidence that new telephone systems interfere with
law enforcement investigations.  During Congressional testimony on
March 18, Director Freeh described "a 1993 informal survey which
the FBI did with respect to state and local law enforcement
authorities."   According to Freeh, the survey describes the
problems such agencies had encountered in executing court orders
for electronic surveillance.  On May 19 the FBI Director delivered
a speech before the American Law Institute in Washington, DC.  In
his prepared remarks, Freeh stated that "[w]ithin the last month,
the FBI conducted an informal survey of federal and local law
enforcement regarding recent technological problems which revealed
over 180 instances where law enforcement was precluded from
implementing or fully implementing court [wiretap] orders."

     According to David L. Sobel, EPIC's Legal Counsel, the FBI
has not yet demonstrated a need for the sweeping new legislation
that it seeks.  "The Bureau has never presented a convincing case
that its wiretapping capabilities are threatened.  Yet it seeks to
redesign the information infrastructure at an astronomical cost to
the taxpayers."  The nation's telephone companies have
consistently stated that there have been no cases in which the
needs of law enforcement have not been met.

     EPIC is a project of the Fund for Constitutional Government
and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.


================================================================


           FBI Director Freeh's Recent Conflicting
   Statements on the Need for Digital Telephony Legislation
_______________________________________________________________


Speech before the Executives' Club of Chicago, February 17:

   Development of technology is moving so rapidly that several
   hundred court-authorized surveillances already have been
   prevented by new technological impediments with advanced
   communications equipment.

               *               *               *

Testimony before Congress on March 18:

   SEN. LEAHY: Have you had any -- for example, digital telephony,
   have you had any instances where you've had a court order for a
   wiretap  that couldn't be executed because of digital
   telephony?

   MR. FREEH: We've had problems just short of that.  And I was
   going to continue with my statement, but I won't now because
   I'd actually rather answer questions than read. We have
   instances of 91 cases -- this was based on a 1993 informal
   survey which the FBI did with respect to state and local law
   enforcement authorities.  I can break that down for you.

               *               *               *

Newsday interview on May 16:

   We've determined about 81 different instances around the
   country where we were not able to execute a court-authorized
   electronic surveillance order because of lack of access to that
   particular system - a digital switch, a digital loop or some
   blocking technology which we didn't have to deal with four or
   five years ago.

               *               *               *

Speech before the American Law Institute on May 19:

   Within the last month, the FBI conducted an informal survey of
   federal and local law enforcement regarding recent techno-
   logical problems which revealed over 180 instances where law
   enforcement was precluded from implementing or fully
   implementing court orders [for electronic surveillance].
