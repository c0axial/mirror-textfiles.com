Okay, so we are here, moving right along with issue 2. I still havent
really defined the actual style of the e-zine but most of that should
be settled by issue 3. Please keep the submissions comming and tell
me if you don't like anything in here.

This issue could have been better, I havent edited out all the bugs.
Sorry if I did anything wrong.

It looks as though we are going to put this out every 2 weeks or so.
Expect the next issue to be out around Dec. 1. If everything goes well
I might switch to 1 issue per week in January.

The main thing holding this back is submissions. Everybody loves to read
great stuff, but who wants to contribute it. If you see anything or can
write anything, please do.

Thanks,

- Billy Biggs

Here is an interesting article I was given to reprint. I hope this
clarifies who out there is or is not a cyberpunk. I will NOT be
including this in my list of defenitions. Sorry guys. I will not say
my opinions on whether or not this is CP, I intend to stay neutral.

Reich, Orgone and Cyberpunk
by Paul dArmond


What is the connection between Cyberpunk and Reich?  It all relates to how
you define CP.  If CP is just a fashion movement, if all that matters is
how you dress and what you say, then nothing is really connected to CP,
since in that case CP is just a fashion fad, a marketing tool for people
selling amusement and funny clothes.  On the other hand, if CP is really
about tech, specifically street tech, then there is a lot of linkage.  I
guess it comes down to the old do/be do/be do thing.

There is a lot of phoney chatter about VR and cybersex these days.
Personally, I think that VR is an expensive research grant scam/hoax.
There have been plenty of these:  AI, robots, Star Wars, and recently
cybersex and PDAs.  Well, if you are serious about doing something (rather
than just making amusing party-chatter with a bunch of people all dressed
the same way) then you need background research and theory.  Reich was
*the* guy who started a lot of the threads that weave into cyberpunk tech:

Memes - (Mass Psychology of Fascism, emotional plague, tension/relaxation
theory of life)

Cybersex - (orgasm theory, electrophysiology of the orgasm,
tension/relaxation, he also coined the term "sexual revolution", etc.)

Anarchism - (Reich's Natural Work-Democracy was the first anarchist theory
based on psychological principles.  This was the first big step forward in
A-theory since Kropotkin.)

Sexual Politics - (Reich was the first person in modern psychology to
state that orgasms are a crucial part of the dynamic of life.  He also was
the first to claim that male and female orgasms were *equally* important.
A huge amount of modern sexual psychology started with him, and he still
gets zip credit for his pioneering work.)

A whole slew of weird science - (electro-physiology, orgone energy,
cloudbusters, desert experiments, UFOs, bions, etc.)

Reich was suppresed even more thoroughly than Tesla was, probably due to
the fact that he was explicitly political and wrote and published a great
deal.  Tesla published very little outside of some articles on electrical
engineering and a slew of patents.  Reich, on the other hand, was
continuously busy working, teaching, writing and experimenting.  Also, due
to the provisions of his will, he left a trust fund behind to keep his
ideas and research available and accessible.

In the very simplist terms:  "How could the first guy to connect an
oscilograph to his erect cock NOT have a lot to do with cyberpunk?"

NEON BLUE                                                                 TEXT 1
________________________________________________________________________________




     The old gentleman had been looking to talk for me for weeks.
He was relaying and flashing messages everywhere.  I watched him
curious about his intensity in finding me.  Messages blurting and
crying out to me as if I was a god.  When people are looking for
me I burn with a mix of adrenaline and syrup.  I access
everything they have ever done.  Every word they have ever
entered.  All their thoughts, actions, manners, and loves are
mine.  I do my research.      It was simple what the Gentleman
wanted.  He wanted life.  Most everyone who asks for me asks for
that.  They ask for life for their children, parents, lovers, but
most of the time they just want it for themselves.  The Gentleman
was old.  He needed the surgery or else he would die.
     Surgery was not given to old Tech's.  Tech's owned 60
percent of the government before they were dismantled.  The
tech's were hated.  The CORP took them apart and blamed them for
the ruin of the organizations.  They were blamed for all the
takeovers by the Japanese Orgs.  The CORP reorganized the North
American management system and bought out the Central American
Tech's.  Now the major corps are a handful of japanese orgs. and
CORP.  The Tech's were denied any medicine or surgery.  Many of
the poor bastards don't even make it past one hundred anymore.
The CORP saw it as a bad investment in allowing surgery for a
Tech.  Me, I am not so picky.
     The Gentleman was in upper management in his Tech days.
Something called a lawyer, which translates into accountant in
CORP language.  He was also rich which translates into money in
my language.  They lived nice in the Tech days, money was not as
tight.  They could spend money on drugs and concubines then.  A
man in Gentleman's position could live off of drugs and
concubines.  Gentleman could pay the price so that I could live
like that.
     Old Gentleman's case was simple.  He needed to be someone
else so he could have surgery.  That would be no problem.  I have
spent half my life on the insides of CORP's machines.  Other
people think that I am the CORP's machine.  The SYS is well aware
of me.  I float inside of her as if I was her child.  Clinging to
the knowledge in her memory.  She tries to get rid of me like an
unwanted child but I love her way too much to ever leave her.
With Gentleman's score that could all change.
     This will cost Gentleman money and not credit.  There will
be raised eyes at all my money but it would still be safer than
helping a Tech and receiving traceable credits.
     Before I even spoke to the old man I had what he needed.  It
made the meetings go quicker and it helped with my reputation.
He was to meet me at the AMERCORP terminal station.  He said he
would not be followed and would not be bringing anyone.  They all
say that and they all lie.  I hate having meetings in the skin.
The skin is where you get hurt.  No one is going to hurt me
inside of the SYS so I know that they can come after me on the
outside.  I am a little bug, a worm on the inside.  Out there the
people are what is infected.  The only times I have ever been
touched has been in the skin. I got shot by CORP Security in the
leg a year ago.  It was in the interest of CORP to get rid of any
virus in their system.  This virus lost his leg, but that is for
the better, it goes with my fake arm.  My fake is filled with
chips of Stillgate RAM.  I walk like a cripple but I can fly in
the places that count.  I now carry a VMag Auto in the mid
section of my socket arm.  Five rounds a second, very loud, very
ugly but a wonderful conversation piece.
     People that are not an employee for the CORP live by a
different standard.  We are called farmers, I have never farmed
nor ever seen a farm except for holo-books.  The word farmer is
to increase our pride and industrialization. The farmers are
allowed to live as we wish as long as we pay our company dues and
do not rebel against the CORP.  The CORP live within their own
communities and their own strict living styles.  I would spend
hours watching, reading, and listening into the CORP's life.  I
would watch them at church, at home, and at the work place.  The
CORP's were only allowed two children.  One boy and one girl.
They went to church four time a week in their local corporation
headquarters.  They ate only food grown for the CORP employees at
the company stores.  I have seen farmer children shot for walking
into a CORP building.  CORP employees will also be shot if they
are in Farmer establishments for anything but business.  There
are CORP schools, farmer schools are around but they are quietly
discouraged.  CORP and farmers do talk and know each other but it
is rarely anything but business.
     One day a year all farmers have to stay inside their homes
while the CORP's parade the streets.  The CORP's pray and pour
water all over the streets and clean them.  They clean our
streets with their hands and pray for us for that whole day.
This day is called the Day of Cleansing.  I usually go outside
the next day and put out one of my smokes on the clean street.
The Day of Cleansing wasn't coming up for months and I might be
somewhere else anyway with Gentleman's money by then.
     I was at the station about a half hour early.  The place had
some nice shops in there that cater to the japanese tourist.  My
favorite was a sushi bar with a wonderful view of the main
terminal.  The place was the same as I remembered it.  Hazy and
smokey from the tourists cigarettes.  The only lights were the
blue ones coming in from the terminal station.  I got a table by
the window so I could see anyone coming in or out.  I can see the
waiter coming up to me to hassle me about my age.
     "Hey boy this is no place to hangout, you buy something or
go."  The waiters all look the same.  All wearing t-shirts with
food on them.  All with an apron on, cooking and waiting tables.
Kissing up to the businessman and tourists and flashing crap to
the plain men just like themselves.  This chap was smiles all over
thinking that I couldn't buy anything.
     "I'll have an espresso, and bring me lots of sugar."  as I
said this I saw him crumble inside as he would not be able to
tell me to get out.
     I set there drinking my coffee and looked through the
terminal.  It was just another busy day.  You could tell the
security guys a mile away.  They were trying to bust kids ripping
off telco numbers from the phones.  Small time stuff, but one of
the ways I grew up.  At least this was something that the cops
could catch people at.  SYS-junkies like me almost never get
caught.
     Gentleman came in and sat down where I was supposed to meet
him.  He was a tall man with a face that looked exaggerated with
age.  He was wearing an expensive charcoal suit with a red bow
tie and a red hat.  Most important of all he brought a red
briefcase with him. With the money in that case I could buy all
new chips and have a new socket put in behind my ear for faster
transmission.  The socket would just be the beginning.  He sat
there with his feet crossed and jumping about.  He would take his
hat off and play with it.  Straightening the brim, brushing it
off.  Then put the hat back on and then go through the whole
process again.  He was nervous, and he probably should be with
that much money.  What he was doing would get him shot be the
CORP Security on site.  Everything looked cool to me.  All of my
clients act nervous.
     I paid my bill and left a half credit for the chap.
Insulting people is an art, a half credit is not the most
creative insult but that was all the time I had.  I walked by the
shops and down by the Tram loading area, watching the Gentleman
play with his hat.  The two o'clock tram was about to arrive, so
the people were piling forward to get ready to get on.  The
safest way for me to do this was to just walk up from behind the
Gentleman and startle him.
     The people were all walking toward the Tram behind me as I
weaved forward against the grain of them.  My limp slowing me
down some, a couple looking at me with pity in their eyes,
Gentleman was right in front of me now.
     "Old man, I have your medicine." I muttered this and
startled him out of his seat.  Enough for me to grab his
briefcase.  "I hope you brought it all." I said as I started to
open up the case.
     The old man put his hand on top of the case and whispered "I
would like to see my package first!".
     I reached in and grabbed his package and tossed it
to him.  "Here you go and may you live a long and healthy life."
i said as he ripped open the envelope to look inside.
     The briefcase was stuck and I couldn't get it open.  Old
Gentleman started to laugh and pulled out a badge.  "I do not
think you will live a long and healthy life, boy."  he said as
the wrinkles on his face disappeared and melded into the face of
a middle aged man.  "Neon Blue, you are under arrest for violation of the
Anti-Virus Corporation Law."

Here is an interesting post that was floating around recently.


>From: KEITHWRITERS@delphi.com
Newsgroups: alt.cyberpunk
Subject: Mirrorshades & Prosody Release Cancelled Under NSA Pressure
Date: Fri Nov 12 13:47:36 1993


Technosys Press Release

For More Information, Contact:
Keith Boyle, marketing director
keithwriters@delphi.com
limetwig@mindvox.phantom.com

					For Release 10:47 AMEST
					November 12, 1993

Mirrorshades & Prosody Release Cancelled

The scheduled release of Technosys' text composition program Mirrorshades
and text revision/encryption program Prosody has been cancelled because of
pressure from a governmental group claiming to be the National Security
Administration (NSA) wishing to prevent the release of Prosody as an
encryption program.

The "NSA" has expressed concern over the encryption method used by
Prosody. They feel that it may be using an encryption technology similar
enough to another method of natural language encryption that Prosody might
be able to be used to break that coding method. Therefore, they would like
Technosys to hand over all existing copies of the software, technical &
development notes, and software related to Prosody (i.e. Mirrorshades) for
their research.

Since the next step, if Technosys were to refuse, would be the seizure of all
of the above materials by search warrant and criminal charges, Technosys has
chosen to consent to their request and will cancel the release of these
programs.

However, THE MAN can't seize what's in our brain cells...

(Technosys is looking for good information law representation.
 Anyone interested?)
