Issue 4. Here it is. I still have not recieved the next part of the sci-fi
story started in issue 2. Sorry. Anyways, it looks as though I will be going
into one issue a week in January, if I keep on getting enough stuff. For
Now I am not making any commitments as to when the next issue will be out.

This issue was put together fairly quickly, so there is not much stuff in
here. Expect a bigger-better one next issue.

THIS REVIEW APPEARED IN FACTSHEET FIVE: (WINTER 93-94)
Half high tech hacking...and half high weirdness. This is one excellent
zine. Two articles, one on God as a Cockroach and the other on various
doomsday cults, are the choicest bits from this truly wild zine. The
doomsday article includes a probability table for various scenarios. "New
York Diary" makes me glad that I live in Frisco. The Godzilla article is a
gem, as are the horrorscopes. ...The tech articles are good for the hacker
who frequents Radio Shack. It's weird, wonderful and worthwhile.

SF REVIEW OF: _ARISTOI_                 ____/  /    \ \
  by Walter Jon Williams                      _________\

------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT, WHY, AND WHEN
-------------------
I first was attracted to WJW's writing by his book "Hardwired",
which is a classic 'jack-in and go' tale.  I would love to
describe his other enjoyable books (and recommend ones to skip),
but I'm motivated tonight to share his latest: _ARISTOI_.

It was some time ago I finished _ARISTOI_, and it has stuck with
me for several reasons.  He presents several thought-provoking 
ideas, and their applications to the character's lives as well
as the world(s) in which they dwell.


THE SCOPE
---------
What WJW attempts in _ARISTOI_ is quite ambitious, and he pulls it
off fairly well.  In my limited reading, _ARISTOI_ is one of the
few books to really push the immaginative edge in concieving the 
eventual results of our evolving 'Information Age'.

There is a casualness in the introduction to the flood of his
ideas, which are *not* spelled out to us in spoon-fed detail,
introduced in a paced-out and predictable fashon.  Instead, they
sneek up on us, in the matter of fact banter and actions of the 
characters.


THE CONCEPTS
------------
The coolest concept I liked was the /daimones/ :

  Let the daimon come.  Let me wrestle with this 
  daimon.  Let me overcome the daimon and make him
  a part of me.  Let me take the daimon's power!

The idea is an /implant/, which is an augmentation device(s),
placed into one's grey matter, wired up to boost an existing
facet(s) of your personality.  The daimon becomes an actual 
evolving personality.  It is your work-slave, advisor, and friend,
who is loose and chattering about in your head.

In "Tides Of Light" by Gregory Benford, he described similar
implants containing the memory/personalities of past tribe members,
to be accessed for opinions and technical info when needed.

These daimones of WJW's are quite different; although, they too 
can access the Hyperlogos (a kind of Galactic Net).  They can also 
serve as a simulcron (sp?), representing you in your stead within
the Oneirochronon (the virtual world). 

Apart from these personalities, there was a similar item for
instant access to universal info in Delany's 
_The_Stars_In_My_Pocket_Like_Grains_Of_Sand_.  He describes an
on-line in-head info resource, where you could read any book 
in seconds just by willing it, and search for specific items
on demand.

But in _ARISTOI_, access to the Oneirochronon can be very real.  
To the point where it is difficult for one to spot an Aristoi's
daimon agent which is acting on his/her behalf.

Interaction with the daimones is frequently presented in a two
column format.  The events in one column being the external
activities, and in the other is the concurrent dialog and actions 
of the daimones.


THE PEOPLE
----------
There are two classes of humans, the Aristoi and the plain ol'
masses.  Occasionally, an Aristoi is selected from the masses. 
They become long-lived, get their implants, and receive sobering
responsibilities.  One task required of them is to care for the 
masses, building them whole worlds (called domains), lording over
all like some ultimate 'SimCity 10000' god.  

The Aristoi must take great care with the powerful technology
mankind has amassed (of which they wield unlimited control), 
and so they must also watch over each other... (uh-oh).

Their most difficult task is to stay sane and avoid boredom.  
The common role of the masses is to be played with.  Some of the
common folk don't know about their 'gods', others fall in love
or worship them.  


IN CONCLUSION
-------------
The story is an enjoyable tale for those who like slightly non-
traditional fare.  It presents an intriguing set of ideas to
entertain you, and the story possesses adventure, violence, love, 
and resolution.

I hope you enjoy it (if you read it).

               COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY '94
                    Conference Announcement
            Scholarships, Writing Competition Notice
                 23-26 March 1994, Chicago, Il.

     The fourth annual conference, "Computers, Freedom, and
Privacy," (CFP'94) will be held in Chicago, Il., March 23-26, 1994.
The conference is hosted by The John Marshall Law School; George B.
Trubow, professor of law and director of the Center for Informatics
Law at John Marshall, is general chair of the conference.  The
program is sponsored jointly by these Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Groups: Communications (SIGCOMM);
Computers and Society (SIGCAS); Security, Audit and Control
(SIGSAC).

     The advance of computer and communications technologies holds
great promise for individuals and society.  From conveniences for
consumers and efficiencies in commerce to improved public health
and safety and increased participation in government and community,
these technologies are fundamentally transforming our environment
and our lives.

     At the same time, these technologies present challenges to the
idea of a free and open society.  Personal privacy and corporate
security is at risk from invasions by high-tech surveillance and
monitoring; a myriad of personal information data bases expose
private life to constant scrutiny; new forms of illegal activity
may threaten the traditional barriers between citizen and state and
present new tests of Constitutional protection; geographic
boundaries of state and nation may be recast by information
exchange that knows no boundaries in global data networks.

     CFP'94 will assemble experts, advocates and interest groups
from diverse perspectives and disciplines to consider freedom and
privacy in today's Information Society.  Tutorials will be offered
on March 23, 1994, from 9:00 a.m. - noon and 2:00 - 500 p.m. The
conference program is Thursday, March 24, through Saturday, March
26, 1994, and will examine the potential benefits and burdens of
new information and communications technologies and consider ways
in which society can enjoy the benefits while minimizing negative
implications.

                    STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION

     Full time college or graduate students may enter the student
paper competition.  Papers must not exceed 3000 words and should
address the impact of computer and telecommunications technologies
on freedom and privacy in society.  Winners will receive financial
support to attend the conference and present their papers.  All
papers should be submitted by December 15, 1993, (either as
straight text via e-mail or 6 printed copies) to: Prof. Eugene

    Super model Claudia Schiffer is most likely not aware of the Internet
    and all of its possibilities.   Penthouse magazine might have heard
    of the Internet, but probably has not given it much thought.
    Claudia had her pictures taken when she was partying off the coast
    of France on a boat with Peter Gabriel.  Everyone was having a good
    time on the boat and Claudia decided to take her bikini top off and
    get some sun.  A curious sole with a camera took several pictures of
    her and now she will be appearing in the December 1993 Penthouse.
    Claudia probably knows this and is not happy. I wonder how happy she
    would be if she knew  these pictures have been available on the Net
    for quite some time now.

    A simple browse through the right section of USENET and you will
    find these shots popping up from time to time.  There are a steady
    stream of celebrity photos that appear on the Net/USENET and they
    come from all over the world.  The day is here when it is hard for a
    good newsman can get the story (or photos!) out in print before it is
    available on the Internet.


                                o-o-o-o

   Recently in the Chicago Illinois Online/BBS community a string of
   events have occurred that caused the Association of Software
   Professionals (ASP) to put out a nation wide warning.  It seems that
   someone has been contacting various ASP sanctioned BBS's and
   identifying themselves as a representative of the ASP.  This person
   is requesting full and unrestricted access to these boards so that
   they can do a 'system file check'.  Once access is granted they
   proceed to leech every file they can get.  One BBS was hit for 310
   ZIP files.

   According to Richard Holler , ASP BBS Membership Chairman , the person
   logs on as 'ASP Overlooker' and uses the ASP logo as their online
   signature.  Richard also said that the person has not done anything
   malicious or harmful, but only seems to want to bypass the validation
   and subscription fees common with ASP boards.  According to the
   Chairman, ASP does not conduct searches or have anyone authorized to
   do so at this time.

                                o-o-o-o

                       =-  I want my MTV.COM!  -=

   That is what over 1,700 Internet users have been saying.  MTV.COM is
   a recent entry into Cyberspace that has drawn a lot of attention from
   the online community.  Accessing it is as simple as telneting to
   MTV.COM and following the menus.

   Adam Curry is the force behind this new online service and he is providing
   it with his own resources.  MTV Corporate is aware and supportive of him
   but will not officially support the online service as of yet.  There
   are some other online services that are trying to get MTV to go
   online. The Imagination Network (Sierra Online Network) has been
   knocking on MTV's door for a while, but nothing has come of it as of
   yet.

   Adam sends out a daily newsletter called 'CyberSleaze' that can be
   sent directly to your Email account.  It is full of the latest gossip
   about the music industry and the people in it.  When I say latest I
   mean the VERY latest.  Adam provides information that never makes it the
   mainstream publications until much later.  As with the Claudia
   Shiffer pictures, you cannot beat the Internet to the presses.

                                o-o-o-o

   Just to confirm the report in the last issue of BandWidth,  Sprint
   has officially canceled new memberships to PC Pursuit.  They are
   closing it down as soon as possible.
   Last time I mentioned that PC Pursuit was a way for BBS callers to call
   other states without incurring long distance charges, and also
   discouraging illegal use of Sprints long distance network.  PC
   Pursuit was started in the 1980's when analog phone technology made
   it sometimes hard to trace a phone phreak.  We are now living in the
   Digital age and most phone systems are now on digital networks.
   Tracing calls are no problem.  I guess Sprint decided they did not
   have to discourage phone phreaks anymore now that they can trace the
   illegal calls and prosecute.
