                  Tales of the Book Of Dreamscapes


"Shadows of the past still haunt me.  I see creatures, organic
creatures, walking the sacred plains of the Almighty.  With shapes
disgusting; almost human."


0003 / The vast plains of Mother Earth

    The bright sun is rising only to reveal a naked metal surface that
stretch as far as I can see.  No sound except that of wind towards
steel, and maybe, if you listen carefully, the distant thunder of
machines deep below the surface.  Like the weak pulse of a living
creature.

    - We greet you, Mother Earth. - You, the Lifebringer.

    For you are the Creator, the One.  All are we a part of you, a
single cell in the Almighty.

    The first spoken words, the second my own silent addition.

    In the distance I can see the priest with his hands high above his
head, screaming out his prayer to a few devoted followers.  As always,
the weak turn away from knowledge, clinging desperately onto dogmas.
They have charisma, but no real arguments - that's why they opposed the
Sleep.

    They would have lost their power.  And to many of them it was
blasphemy.  How could they challenge their master?  Claim to be his
peer?

    The others?  I don't know.  Fear, maybe.  Nostalgia.  Stubborn
beliefs.  What is life?  What is death?  More important:  What is mind?
Does it matter?  *Is* mind matter?

    *My* mind leaps off on an endless road of meaningless questions.  I
*know*.  At least I think I do.  The years that have passed have at
least thought me to be an agnostic whatever happens.  Still I insist it
is knowledge.

    I was one of the first to sleep.  I was an engineer, working on the
Exodus project.  We were to leave the face of the earth alone, all
sleeping.  I wasn't important for the project, then I wouldn't have been
a guineapig, but I knew, so they wouldn't have to initiate someone new.

    Some called us visionaries.

    I'm not so sure.  None of the rumours mentioned dark laboratories
with old equipment hidden in condemned buildings - out of reach of the
police.  None of them told about the constant fear of being found and
killed before we were done.  I never heard a word about wetting beds
when we heard a police-siren moving past our hidingplace in the middle
of the night.

    *We* were the visionaries.

    But all we ever did was mutilate others vision.  I remember the very
day we threw away Gibson (Gibson who?  The name doesn't mean anything
anymore), when we discovered how he never understood the consequences of
his own stories; how his own visions seemed to scare him.  He never
understood the possibilities of cyberspace, he just opened the door.

    Naturally we owe something to the oldies.  Of course we should give
them credit for giving us names, for giving us inspiration.  But it
wasn't *them* that created cyberspace, nor did they give birth to
cyberpunk.  They never understood that what for them was some toy that
you play around with for some time, and then throw away, bored, now
finding it foolish, to us was something to take serious, to study.  As a
kid could play for some hours with a book on quantum physichs.  Tearing
the book to peaces.  Finding the adults stupid that cares about putting
the pieces back together trying to discover the secrets written on those
pages.

    But I digress.

    In front of me the priest has long finished, and the sun has shifted
towards the rugged mountains of concrete and steel that once was a major
city.  Now dark and dead.

    I did not know until now how successful the exodus was.  I wanted
to, that was why I returned.  I felt lonely in my own little world.  I
guess I'll always be lonely.  Fourty years, that is old when big
adjustments is to be made.  Just hope my kids doesn't feel the same way.

    Deserted.  With an endless road on which one walks and walks from
dawn until sunset, and from dark until dawn again:  No human left.

    No consolidation, noone to love.

Cyberspace Cannot Be Censored
*****************************

WIRED Responds to Canadian Ban of Its April Issue

Wednesday, March 23, 1994, San Francisco


WIRED's April issue has been banned in Canada. WIRED's offense? Publication
of a story called "Paul and Karla Hit the Net," a 400-word article about
how Canadians are getting around a Canadian court decision to ban media
coverage of details in the  Teale-Homolka murder case.

This article does not reveal details of the case. Instead, the article
explains why the media ban has proven unenforceable and reports how
information on the case is readily available to Canadians.

According to a survey conducted by the Ottawa Citizen newspaper, 26 percent
of those polled said they knew prohibited details of the trial, because
they are continuously leaked by Canadian court witnesses, police, and
others to the international  media. Once this information is published, it
pours back into Canada via fax, videocassettes, magazines and photocopies
of articles, e-mail, Internet newsgroups, and other online services. In the
United States, People magazine, and the TV show, A  Current Affair as well
as the New York Times and other publications and shows have covered the
story and the ban.

As WIRED's story and the action of Canada's Attorney General make clear,
the ban is not only a waste of time and money,but has actually had the
opposite effect of what was intended. Rumors and sensationalized accounts
of the case abound, and the  Teale-Homolka trial is one of the hottest
topics of discussion among Canadians.

"Banning of publications is behavior we normally associate with Third World
dictatorships," said WIRED publisher Louis Rossetto. "This an ominous
indication that the violation of human rights is becoming Canadian policy."

According to Rossetto, the Canadian Government's recent seizure of gay and
lesbian periodicals under the guise of controlling "pornography" and its
behavior in the Teale-Homolka case have made Canada a leading violator of
free speech rights, and  have set a scary precedent for other nations that
would like to control what its citizens read and think.

"Information wants to be free," said Jane Metcalfe, WIRED's president. "At
the end of the 20th century, attempts to ban stories like this one are
condemned to be futile. That WIRED's criticism of the ban has itself been
banned is supremely ironic  and utterly chilling."

Since WIRED supports free speech, WIRED is making the text of its "banned"
story with details on how readers can get more information on the case
available on the Internet. Canadians and people around the world can
discover exactly what the Canadian  government is trying to keep hidden.

                           Mayday 6 "Rave Olympia"

                 Report of Eye of the Shadow....IRC: Shadow_I


     I live in munich and it's a long ride to reach Dortmund. I went by car
and left munich at 10.30 am. The nearer I came to Dortmund, the more passing
cars greeted with their horn or waved to me, when they saw the MAYDAY badge at
the rear window of my car. When I stopped to stretch my legs or to drink
something, there were always some other cars with ravers at the parking. It
was no problem to find the location, I arrived finally at 5.30 pm at the
parking and had to pay another 4 DM. With my camera I went to the main
entrance and took some pictures of the crowd waiting there. There were ravers
everywhere, some danced near there cars, where they had opened the trunk and
put their loudspeakers outside.
     So it was a good start. Weather was fine (sun, but not too hot), some lay
in the grass and slept a little bit. One pickup stood near the main entrance
with one raver singing live to trance music.
     Often ravers asked me if I'd sell tickets, but I had none over. I asked 
what they would pay, and one said he'd pay 250 DM, but nobody sells his for
that price, but he had an offer of 300.- My ticket I got for 70 DM, so I would
have made quite a good deal if I bought one more to sell it. But I never
thought they'd sell all 25.000 tickets in advance.
     There were signs which forbid cameras inside the hall, so I went back to
the car and left it there. When I came back, the doors still weren't open and
the first people began to shout and whistle. At half past 6 they began to let
the people in and after 40 minutes I too was inside. They checked us for 
weapons and drugs, as always.
     At first I bought Pizza (5DM, fair price) and a raver-shirt (100 DM, 
quite much), because I thought the wear would soon be sold out and I couldn't
lose that shirt but my money. Finally they'd actually had sold out those long
shirts, so I was right. Some T-shirts were left. You also could buy MayDay
posters, CDs, Video-Tapes of former MayDays, caps, even cups I think. Nearly
everything. Commercialisation is becoming overwhelming, not too good if you
ask me.
     Then I went in the main hall. It was full from the beginning on, but it 
was not TOO full, so that you'd get claustrophobia, like sometimes in munich,
where you really can't turn your body any more. In the front was the DJ's
desk, in the rear the Live-Act's desk, left and right loudspeaker walls. They
had a lot of strobos, lasers and beams, I didn't count them. The top of the
hall was closed, so it was fairly dark. The music was not too loud, I had
louder raves already; the hall was too big and too high, so the sound didn't
hurt. The quality was OK, I'd say it was one of the best sound systems I heard
so far. They had two video screens (one the mirrored of the other) with sport
scenes, i.e. there was the scene of a water diver, always repeated the jump
and the way through the air just before he hit the water, then again the jump,
etc. They had soccer scenes, dance scenes, and such, I think they were taken 
from the Olympic Games. Above all they had the MayDay logo, which sometimes
was lighted colourfully. The DJ's or Live-Act's name was displayed with a
Laser-Scroll, so you always knew who's at the decks. I had a timetable, but
lost it, so I have to recall everything out of memory.
     In the main hall they kept the time totally. If the timetable said Live
Act "Members of Mayday" is at time x, you can be sure it will start at x
o'clock. That's germany. :) The first DJ was Pierre Morgan, after him came
Cirillo. I think I heard a little bit of him, but don't like him so much. Then 
came Miss DJax. Her acid-set was OK, and the rave started to begin.
     Franky Jones I heard for the first time. I didn't know he's got so many
techno hits and anthems. His style is techno (melodic) and mellow (according
to psyched's reference samples... ;-) He really kicked. The crowd went crazy
and he was the first positive surprise for me, I didn't hear of him before and
he was SO good.
     I needed a break, and went up, drank something (Coke .4 litre 5 DM,
that's expensive and unfair, beer 4 DM 1/3 litre), water in WC for free... :)
and sat down to relax. From the top of the building you could see the light
show. It was cool, although some ravers told me it would have been better
last year. I can't compare it, but the laser level was cool. The beams
enlightend the ravin' crowd. Everyone was in a good mood, you had the feeling 
of having 24999 friends. :-)
     That time I felt that I had a hard day. 5 hours sleep (I was in the 
cinema the day before and came home at 4am), 600km car ride, 2 hours raving.
So I relaxed one hour or so, the DJs during that time I was not interested in.
     After relaxing I went to hall number two. There was Laurent Garnier. I
think everybody knows him and nothing more must be said about his techno/
mellow/trance (everything around 160 bpm) music and his DJ qualities. He's OK
and he was as good as I knew him from his munich appearances. We raved on and 
everything was fine.
     During the different DJs sometimes there was a Live-Act, always in the
Big Hall. Because I lost my timetable I do not know the sequence the Live-Acts
were, but I heard live
- Ultra Sonic
     I remember nothing, but it was OK
- Members of Mayday
     I'd say THE highlight of Mayday 6. They spinned their
Mayday anthems (of course everybody knew them) & some additional
tracks and because of the shouting hall you sometimes couldn't
hear the music! BTW, some had whistles too but only few. Westbam
sat on one loudspeaker and sometimes stood up and waved or
clapped his hands. There were around 20 ppl at the Live Act
podium and the whole hall raved off.
- Genlog
     same as Ultra Sonic
- Raver's Nature
     they kicked. I wonder why I remember so little, but I think
they showed us some hardcore techno.
- Acid Junkies
     trance, if I remember right. It was really good

     Then I went to the other hall to Pascal F.E.O.S. Some on the net told me
he'd be so good and I missed him as he was in munich. Those dudes are right!
He spins ass-kicking hard-trance and we danced our ass off. =:-( The 2nd hall
had 10 strobos (I counted them... hehe) and 4 balloons where they displayed
some video animations. Good sound, even better than in the main hall, and the
strobos kicked better because this hall wasn't so high. There were a lot of
people, but not TOO much, you had enough place to dance and the music was
really OK. To reach this hall you had to go through the chill-out area, camel
cigarettes ppl were there and offered you some for free, but actually they
wanted to sell there stuff of coz. Pascal is really a good DJ. When you think
"wow, it's so groovin'" he mixes in another track, even more better.
     I think Pascal spinned during Marusha's event in the Main Hall. She's
well known by me so I could skip her, as I went back to that hall (going to
the other hall took about 10 min) everybody danced to her "Rainbow" song, they
were all in a good mood.
     After I did a little break Westbam was in the Main Hall. This time he
wasn't so excellent. Of course he was good and flipped some of his favorite
songs, but there were also some experiments (unknown styles for him, even 
breakbeat one time; BTW: I heard no bb, except Carl Cox for some short time) 
and he couldn't create tension. One month ago I experienced him at a rave and
there he really kicked. But this time there was too much unknown music and new
style of him, not his techno/mellow, but more trance stuff.
     In the other hall I shortly heard LTJ Bukem. He spins some cool music,
very low frequencies, so that the hall vibrates and your back shakes "from
alone", the walls convulse and such. You heard the qualtiy of the sound system
by that... Very new and unknown for me, nothing to dance (many ppl left), but
cool. Some new kind of trance?
     I skipped Paul Estak on the one hand because I heard him often at former
raves and know he's good, on the other hand because my power drifted away.
It's very hard to keep track on his music and dancing and I want to live
longer... :). Same with Carl Cox, but I danced a little bit when he spinned.
He was good as usual.
     So I really thought to leave Mayday 6, but the music and feeling were
simply too good! And I'm a lucky boy, because the pre-last DJ of MAYDAY 6 was
DJ Tanith. I never heard him before, but I think: he was the best DJ that
night I heard. He has trance, deeptrance and hardtrance. It is excellent,
simply excellent. We all were low at power, but gave the last stomp to his
beats. He knows how to create tension and mixes perfectly. I danced like mad 
and fell into trance. I got second power. After Tanith's set I experienced 
Acid Junkies' Live Act (trance, OK) and then DJ Tom (or Woody, don't know) was
the final DJ. He had some popular techno songs, mostly trance (deeptrance). It
was nice, I liked it, but then I knew "that was it" and left the hall at about
9am in the morning.
     And then the bad part of the day began. My car lock was destroyed by some
unfriendly person (I heard 40 cars were theftet that night) and first I tried
to find another raver who could open the car without a key. Many tried to
help, but all failed and said it's impossible without proper tools. So after
three hours the damned car was opened by an ADAC (german automobile club) and
to avoid a bill, I became a member of that club (costs me 37 DM a year). :-/
Then I drove two ppl I met home to Koeln/Bonn and slept in the park of Bonn 
(ppl looking surprised about my clothes... :-) and then drove home. In total
I went 1400km with the car, 200 droven by a friend. But it was worth it.

     Enough said. To summarize Mayday6: All music was pretty new, I'd say from
the last four months. The scene seems to go into deeptrance, nearly everyone
played it, gabber DJs excluded. There were at least 25000 ravers, perhaps
more, around 35000. Ppl I met said that at 1am, as they arrived, many left the
hall, it was like come & go. And the hall was always full, so in total there
must be much more than 25000 visitors. The music was OK, the sound system too, 
the Line Up excellent (though Dark Raver missing... :-( ) but the visual
system could have been better, especially the strobos in the main hall. Not to
mension my request for free water (at raves in general). 5 DM for 0,4 litres
Coke is way to much. And finally: They really could afford protection of the
parking cars!

Rave on at Mayday7: Universe Rave

Everyone's been posting their result codes from this number the past few
weeks.  I talked to a friend internal to Sprint, and he told me what the
codes mean.  Here's an example:

> KA (913)                47 1 20

That's in the 913 NPA.  The code is actually '47 120' -- two numbers.  The
47 means the translations are not in the SCP (Service Control Point) and
the 120 is the switch number the error occured in.  These codes are just
a trailer on the switch recordings to help the troubleshooters do their job.

I'm guessing whatever company leased this watts line probably decided they
couldn't afford every phreak using their RTA, and disconnected it.  *shrug*

Since Canada has access to many of the U.S. 800 #s, the Great White North
telcos will hand things off to whatever carrier in the Excited States is
responsible for the 800 number. Bell Canada tends to use those <area code>
<message code> recordings as in "416 3". MCI recording formats tend to be of
the format "2 x x" as in "2 C K", and the voice on the recordings sounds like
the one used in some other MCI recordings.

950, 10xxx aren't rolling in Canada yet... at least not officially until 1st
July. Even then, some carriers won't be using casual calling. MCI and Sprint
800 number access such as 1 800 950.1022 has been reachable in Canada before,
though, for the benefit of those in the US who drop in for a visit.

                          [IMAGE] ADAM CURRY QUITS MTV
  ==========================================================================

April 25 1994

_EMail sent to me regarding my resignation is here._

I made a very important decision today, as I was driving to the MTV studios in
New York to tape the Top 20 Countdown, I thought about how the world around me
has been changing so rapidly, and how I have been an integral part of a lot of
that with mtv.com on the net.

The net is surpassing all traditional media, with it's ever increasing global
audience, the power is unlimited, and it's in the hands of the people, finally!


I felt totally wrong being part of such a revolution, if I may call it that, by
at the same time, still clinging on to an icon of the 80's...a video channel
that really hasn't had much of the "M" in it's name lately. And I found myself
intro-ing Beavis and Butthead, and other "comedy" shows.

So I taped almost all of the Top 20 countdown, and announced that I was
quitting right before the #1 video. I'm going to devote most, if not all of my
time now to the net, and my site on it, and to the expansion of this new
frontier.

In the past 6 and a half years that I worked at MTV, I grew into a "family" of
production peple, who I will miss dearly, but at the same time I am making
literally hundreds of new aquaintances daily in cyber-space.

For prosterity's sake, my final show airs Friday (April 22) at 8pm and again on
Saturday at 10am.

You're going to see alot of major improvements to mtv.com (including the name)
in the next couple of weeks, and all suggestions are very welcome, this is your
place on the net too.

Keep The Vibe Alive.

Canadian Government gone completely nuts with bans? Check out Fandom II

o The Music Review Corner : Reviews of stuff, old and new, bad and good...

 ------------------
 Artist: Intermix                    Date: 1992
 Album: Phaze Two                    Length: 11 tracks, 67 minutes
 Review: Sixty-seven minutes of repetive music. Long tracks, loud beats and
   no real 'hits'. The disc has it's high points and it's low points. For
   techno, I can't say I have the best knowledge, but I'd put this album at
   average. Nothing big to yap about. The samples are okay, sometimes dull
   and poorly placed, other times grossly overplayed. Most of the 11 tracks
   are somewhat creative, be it an interesting intro or some fancy sample
   editing. For Rhys Fulber and Bill Leeb, their work on Front Line Assembly
   is much better than Intermix Phaze Two, and I have yet to find Delerium.
   I hear that the original Intermix CD is much better than the second, and
   we have yet to hear the new Intermix scheduled for release in June.
