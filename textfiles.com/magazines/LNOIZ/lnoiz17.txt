                  Tales of the Book Of Dreamscapes


"They were treated as heroes - noone ever saw them again"


0004 / Reaching for the stars

    We saw the bright sun on a black sky, and had to protect our eyes
with our hand not to be blinded by the intense light.

    Before us the plane that were to bring the members of the expedition,
us, to the ship.

    Music. I remember music, and flags almost torn away by the wind,
Neverending speaches, all imprinted in my memory forever.

    Together with the image of crying faces, partly hidden by my own
tears, these impressions are the last I remember before we sat aboard,
watching the earth become a distant object at which we only ocasionally
glanced.

    Finally it disappeared behind a gigantic steel blue ship, stretching
on until eternity.

    We were the first ever to leave the solar system. The first ever to
go so far that noone could come to our rescue.

    That was back in the days when I still believed in the lies we were
told. The stories about how we would conquer the universe to create an
eternal empire. The utopias our leaders desperately held onto while
trying to keep the last bits of power in their own hands; to keep their
fast dissolving empire together.

    As we went aboard the ship which were supposed to bring us
lightyears into outer space I remember thinking:

    - Why? Why shall we conquer the stars? What do we earn? What are
there to learn?

    As everyone else I had heard about the Sleep, and allthough it was
rejected as nonsense by our leaders, many of us believed that it must
be some truth to the story. If we had the Sleep, what more could we
want?

    The Sleep was supposed to be nearly a century old, yet to most of
us it was still a legend. The legend told us about the Net, an abstract
entity, a network, growing out of control. It told us about the Exodus
project. A project destined to discover a way to let us leave our
bodies; to float freely around in a simulated world.

    But some went further, or so the story says. They left the shell
created by the World Simulators; they merged with the operating
systems, grew one with the Net. They transcended human limitations.

    They were called the Visionaries. Even those of us who believed
in the existence of the Exodus project refused to believe they
existed. The stories were too unbelieveble. Some even insisted that
these visionaries had went as far as to disconnect their humans
shells, to let their _minds_ leave their brain and be one with the
Net.

    But in the few years I were awake during the centuries that passed
aboard the ship, the dreams and fantasies made me wonder. Even if it
wasn't possible when we left earth - what kind of advances had been
made while we had been away? We had received some transmissions, but
after two hundreds years they suddenly stopped. When we woke up for
maintenance, we found a twenty year gap in which not a single word had
been transmittted.

    I know some of the others were caught by intense fear. Everything
from plagu to nuclear war went through our heads, but we couldn't
really believe it. The ship compurtes were checked, but no error were
found on them either.

    It wasn't until we returned to earth a millenia later we understood
what had happened. I will try to recall some of my feelings, but it
will take time before I'll manage put them down in writing.

    Trying to reconstruct the last years of human kind, we worked
through tons of documents, gigabytes of data. Among all the books,
all the articles, one will always come back to haunt me.

    It was a travelogue. Written ten years before we left earth. It was
called The Book of Dreamscapes. Through short the author painted a
verbal picture of his adventures floating around the Net. He wasn't
one of the visionaries. He had returned to write his book before
returning to the Net. He wanted to tell the world about it's beauty.

    But he had met them. He had encountered strange beeings, some
almost human, some not at all. All separated from human body, though
some still occasionally visited the World Simulator system in human
bodies.

    He met the living Net; new forms of life, Godlike entities of
undescribable beauty stretching their arms deep into the World
Simulator, manifesting themselves as a part of nature itself. Telling
about the joys of Separation.

    The last chapter, "Reunion", had only one short line:

    Brave new world, what is it you will bring?

Come together in the summer of 1994 to celebrate the hacker world
and the tenth anniversary of 2600 Magazine. We will have speakers and
demonstrations from around the globe, a collection of films and rare
videos on hacking, and our very own network between all of us
and the outside world!

This is an opportunity to feel the real magic of hacking instead of
hearing about how we're about to destroy the world in some cheap tabloid
or on the news during sweeps week. Government propaganda and corporate
doublespeak have finally met their match!

If you want to help put together this historic event, contact us
by telephone at (516) 751-2600, through the mail at H.O.P.E., PO Box 848,
Middle Island, NY 11953, on the Internet at 2600@well.sf.ca.us.
We need ideas, people, technology, and karma.

H.O.P.E. - August 13th and 14th at the Hotel Pennsylvania,
right in the middle of bustling New York City (Seventh Avenue and 
34th Street, right across the street from Penn Station). We've rented out
the entire top floor (except for the mysterious NYNEX office). 
Special rates of $99 a night are available from the hotel (double rooms,
four can probably fit easily). Cheaper places are also available as is
nearly anything else. This is New York City, after all.

Admission to the conference is $20 for the entire weekend if you
preregister, $25 at the door, regardless of whether you stay for two days
or five minutes. We encourage you to bring a computer so you can tie into
our giant Ethernet and add to the fun. We hope you try to hack root on
the system we'll be running - all attendees will get accounts with
prizes for the penetrators.

Dancing and merchandising in the halls

Cellular phone workshop

Celebration of the Clipper Chip (not)

Hacker videos from all over the world

Surveillance demos

Hacker legends from around the globe

It's not Woodstock - It's The Future

Many more details are on the way.

           DEMANDE REJETEE D'INTERDICTION D'UN LIVRE
               SUR LES VIRUS INFORMATIQUES

Le 27 decembre 1993, le President du Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris
est saisi en refere d'heure a heure d'une demande d'interdiction et de
destruction d'un ouvrage informatique "Naissance d'un Virus" edite par la
maison d'edition Addison-Wesley France et distribue par Bordas.

Le 5 janvier 1994, le President du Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris
rejette la demande.

Le 19 Janvier 1994, le demandeur fait appel de la decision.

Le 8 mars 1994, l'affaire est plaidee devant la Premiere Chambre de la
Cour d'Appel de Paris. Le Procureur general se prononce alors contre
l'interdiction, qualifiant l'affaire de "proces de la science", accusant
le demandeur de "vouloir refaire le proces de Galillee". Par ailleurs,
Addison-Wesley France denonce alors le denigrement dont elle est victime
dans une revue editee par le demandeur, celui-ci refusant de publier un
droit de reponse precisant la position d'Addison-Wesley France.

En Avril, le droit de reponse est finalement publie.

Le 3 Mai 1994, la Cour d'Appel declare le demandeur irrecevable en ses
demandes, le condamne a tous les depens et a payer la somme de 20000 FF
a Addison-Wesley France.

Subject: Chaos Digest presents _Naissance d'un Virus_


New Chaos Computer Club France (CCCF)'s e-mail address: cccf@altern.com


"I think that this book will make much less difference in the amount of
viruses out there than most people would like. There are already plenty
of newsletters and underground digests, as well as many 'respectable'
journals that have already publih this information, from several
different perspectives. It is like the controversy over Popular
Science's articles about bugs and other detection and spying devices.
If the information was already available, why not compile and publish it?
Although a lot of harm can come to computer systems through viruses, the
best method of protection is education, not ignorance. That's already
been tried with schools where sex education programs are shot down by
parents, who don't want their children exposed to sex, and don't feel
comfortable with their children knowing, feeling that the more they
know, the more tempted they will be to try it. That is always a risk,
but young adults having safe sex in intelligent manner is better than
having fewer young adults engaging in sex, when those who do are unsafe
and uneducated. As it is whith viruses. There are potentially quite a
few applications for viruses, although many will border upon many lines
of morality/immorality and priveacy issues. All in all, I would have to
say that the punishment of any information is generally beneficial,
rather than detrimental, and education is most often the best course of
protection from any threat. Thank you."

=
              Written every now and then by Steven Elmer Baker                           StevenBaker@Delphi.Com                       "The Internet And The Writer"     For the writers of the nineties, the Internet is becoming one of thesharpest tools in
the shed.  The Internet provides access to other writers,editors, and readers through email critique groups, USENET newsgroups, andperiodic newsletters about writing.  Writers can enjoy access to countlesssmall press magazines, literary journals and the
sometimes chaotic mix ofelectronic magazines. These markets can prove more receptive to unpublishedwriters than the major markets.  If you are a writer, and have access tothe Internet, then you should learn of the valuable resources available toyou.    
The Internet has become a concentrated axis for many special interestgroups that have a national appeal.  Among these groups are programmers,musicians, hackers, and writers.  Using the efficiency of email and theworld wide bull!
etin board system known as USENET, groups of like mindedpeople can exchange ideas and join in discussions with thousands of peoplewith similar interests. Several vicinities exist on the Internet forwriters to discuss writing and critique the work of oth
rs.  The two mainresources for writers on the Internet are Internet Mailing Lists and USENETdiscussion groups.     Internet Mailing Lists are specialized discussion groups sent directlyto your electronic mailbox.  By subscribing to a mailing list a pers
n canreceive articles and comments from other subscribers.  Sending a message tothat mailing list in return, your comments goes to everyone alsosubscribing to that mailing list.  These lists are often moderated, meaningsomeone is making sure that inform
tion being posted is relevant, and notsome senseless chatter not about the subject of the list.  The volume inthese lists can get heavy, reaching multiple megabytes of text on a dailybasis, so you have to rationalize how many g!
roups you wish to subscribe to.Writers on the Internet use these list

s to maintain reading groups tocritique each others work and make announcements related to the writingindustry  --  such as new magazines and receptive editors.  EmailCOREY@PLAINS.NODAK.EDU (Pat Corey) for information on the Writers MailingList, and Chr
s Conn at SASCMC@UNX.SAS.COM for information on the FictionWriters Mailing List.     USENET groups are much like the BBSes that we call in our localcities, offering discussion groups on a variety of topics. They reach awider audience, for unlike Interne
 Mailing Lists you need not subscribe tothem  --  just have access to them.  There are thousands of USENET topics,called newsgroups.  When you post a message, within a short period yourarticle is available for anyone in the world to see and comment on. 
Somepopular newsgroups, if you measure popularity by sheer volume, are Alt.Sex,Alt.Urban.Folklore, and Comp.Sys.Ibm.Games.Action.  Writers use USENETgroups such as Alt.Prose, Alt.Writing, and Alt.Journalism to meet otherwriters!
, editors, and receptive readers for their material.  They can posttheir sample material for others to read or they can critique the work ofanother.  Periodically, the USENET groups tailored for writers will featurelists of Internet resources for the wr
ter.  These lists include InternetMailing List addresses, publications seeking submissions, email addressesof editors, and other useful material.  USENET newsgroups, and InternetMailing Lists can both be accessed from many BBSes and online services.
     Todays freelance writing market is increasingly difficult for a newwriter to get published in.  Saturated with established writers submittingtheir work to magazines and literary journals, unpublished writers areoften overlooked.  Publishing helps e
tablish credentials and bringsattention to the new writer from the markets that might otherwise ignorethem.  To pursue the goal of publication, the new writer might considersome alternative markets that can be reached on the Internet.  Thesemarkets incl
de small and large press magazines, literary journals, andelectronic magazines.     Electronic Magazines, or Ezines, are the biggest market that can bereached over the Internet.  These publications can be found in a variety oflocations around the Intern
t, including FTP sites and USENET groups.  Theyoffer a dynamic mix of prose and culture, and the markets that they serveare sometimes narrow, unaffected by the need to generate advertisingrevenue.  They are found near universit!
ies, and the editors are oftenstudents of journalism. The best way to approach the editor of an Ezine isfirst to familiarize yourself with the publication.  After deciding thatyour material has a place in that periodical, you can submit it to theeditor 
s if you were writing an electronic letter.  Payment is oftenlimited to recognition, but the chance to develop an audience for yourwriting is priceless.  If you browse through USENET groups such asALT.PROSE and ALT.WRITING, then you will find open calls
for submissionsfrom these periodicals.  Editors from Ezines like Line Noiz and CYBERKIND,two publications with recent requests for articles, eagerly wait for newwriters to submit their work.     The small press literary publications are the mainstay of 
he essayistand the poet.  Beginning and established writers can find a home for theirwork in the literary journals that proliferate the college campuses.Again, the college students and staff that publish these journals oftenhav!
e email addresses, and welcome submissions of any kind from goodwrite

rs.  Once accepted for publication, you will probably receive a fewissues of the edition you appear in, but some pay a small fee for yourwork.  These publications are read by small markets, but some in thatmarket have much influence in the literary worl
, making them an excellentplace for the un-established writer to make a name for themselves.     Access to publications on the Internet is not limited to the smalljournals, for many major magazines are finding their way onto themedia-blitzed Internet.  
iReD, Connect, Boardwatch, Details, and OnlineAccess are a few of the publications that have access to the Internet.Query letters can be sent as standard email, and the particular guidelinesfor that publication are often sent in return.  Standard format
is straightASCII, with the understood standard of proofreading done before submissionof manuscripts.     We have found it easy to contact the editors of various publicationsthrough Internet Electronic Mail  --  But how do they !
FEEL about gettingelectronic submissions?  I asked a couple of editors this very question.     Boardwatch magazine has been covering the Internet and the onlineworld for several years.  Charles Bowen and John Dvorak are featuredwriters.  Boardwatch has 
ts own BBS accessible by phone line or TELNETfrom the Internet.     "I do not recommend article submissions by electronic mail, though ofcourse we accept them.  You may find that surprising, and doubly so when Itell you that most of our writers do in fa
t convey their columns to us bye-mail, and that it works very well," says Jack Rickard, editor ofBoardwatch Magazine.     This answer stumped me, for Boardwatch is one of the magazinescovering the cutting edge of online technology.  I wondered how could
sucha progressive magazine have a discouraging attitude toward the technologythat it covers?     Mister Rickard added, "Since MOST of our traffic with our writers isvia Internet electronic mail, and since we obviously use elect!
ronictechnology every day, why would I take this position?"     In re

sponse to his own question, Jack told me about one of hisfeatured writers: Bill Gram-Reefer.  Bill is the president of WORLDVIEW, acompany in California specializing in connectivity and communications.  Hewrites the Macintosh column for Boardwatch.     
He sends a very professional package with printed pages - typesetreally indicating bold, italics, special characters, headings, etc. on thepage. It includes the ASCII text on diskette, along with color TIFF imagesof any screen shots or other graphics he
wants included - slides or photoswhen necessary. It is assembled into a folder with his business cardinserted.  It looks, smells, feels, and acts like a very professionalpackage."     Jack Rickards argument against electronic submissions is thatelectron
c submissions lack the aesthetic qualities of a well prepared hardcopy submission.  Straight ASCII text lacks professionalism in his eyes,and he feels that how you present the material is as important as what youare presenting.!
  Our dialogue over the matter will appear in an upcomingissue of Boardwatch, with an amusing story he told me about making a namefor yourself.     Bill Ryal is the editor of Connect Magazine, another publication thatcovers the Internet and the BBS worl
  Connect actively encourageselectronic submissions.  Email submissions are the preferred medium and theonly thing placed in the U.S. Mail are the final contracts to be signed.Connect has a presence on Compuserve, Delphi, Genie, AOL, and a popular BBSfo
cused on the magazine.  Bill replied immediately via email when I askedhim the same question I asked Jack Rickard.     "We encourage it. In fact, our CONNECT Writer's Kit is in electronicformat only, and we have a standing policy that writers SHOULD con
act uselectronically," Bill replied     He then explained that from an editorial standpoint, electronicsubmissions make a great deal of sense because of a number of reasons; " 1)It's faster, 2) The back-and-forth process betwee!
n editor and writer inpolishing an article can be handled at the conv

enience of bothparties...and still get accomplished in less time than conventional means.3) E-mail doesn't generate waste -- no paper, ink, printer cartridges, etc.4) Both parties, if they wish to, can maintain copies of all thetransactions, complete wi
h time and date stamping."     Mister Ryal ended by saying that there is a matter of privacyinvolved, with Internet email being vulnerable to prying eyes.  To preventunwanted eavesdropping into messages, public key file encryption methodscould be implem
nted.     Rickard and Ryal both mentioned to me in their letters that a writercould submit the initial version of the article in hard copy format, withan electronic submission.  This would allow the writer to demonstrate hisprofessionalism along with ut
lizing the effectiveness of electronicsubmissions.     Electronically, I have been able to query, submit, get accepted,rewrite, resubmit, and receive final confirmation within a one week period.The final contracts that must be !
signed will still arrive mail, but thecontract signing is an after thought when you are trying to get published.Your work can reach more markets in a shorter period than ever before, allwithout having to buy a single postage stamp.     The small literar
 magazines and Ezines that populate the Internet andits associated USENET are an excellent place for a beginning writer tostart.  Most of these small publications can only offer copies of thejournal in return for your writing, but they provide you a pla
e to cutyour literary teeth until you are ready to tackle the major markets.  Witha simple, functional email address you have everything you need to begintalking with other writers around the world and submitting your work as yougrow as an online writer

 - - MTV sues Curry - -

Last update: May 10 1994

_New Jersey, May 10 1994_

[...]

"Then I started to get a lot of press about mtv.com, and some people
started to wake up at 1515 Broadway (MTV's HQ in New York City). And I
was served with a "Cease and desist" on the use of mtv.com. MTV's
attorneys claimed that there could be "confusion" for users of the
internet, when connecting to *anything* that had the letters mtv in
the address, and then receiving music and entertainment information. I
was obviously hurt by this move, but did see what point they were
driving at, an asked if we could settle this matter amicably."

"The situation cooled down for a couple of months, but when I resigned
on-air from my job as a VJ, which MTV chose not to air btw, things
started to get ugly."

"Long story short, MTV Networks has filed a lawsuit against me, for
copyright infringement of their "trademark", that being their "MTV"
call letters, as well as having information online that was MTVN
"property". In this case they are referring to several press releases
I put up on mtv.com, such a an announcement about Beavis and
Butthead's "experience" cd release. Understand that MTVN sent me these
releases over their own internal computer network for this very
purpose! Again, I was only doing this to promote the channel, not for
my own personal gain..after all...mtv.com is free access for all, no
charge."

"Throughout all of this I have offered to maintain the site
specifically for mtv, but again they said "we're not interested".
Of course I have no problem whatsoever removing all references to MTV
Networks and it's projects from mtv.com, no that I don't work there
anymore gives me even more reason to want to do this, but the kicker
is they are moving for an injunction to make me stop using the
internet address mtv.com!"

"This is ofcourse totally unacceptable, I registered the domain name,
and I don't plan on giving it up. Sure MTV and their parent company
Viacom have a vast legal team, but david also nailed goliath, so I
have faith. In the long run, everyone knows that the only *true*
winners will be the lawyers."

[...]

"It appears to me that MTV has their mind set on the address mtv.com,
maybe not for now, but possibly for future use, and I feel extremely
used, in that I built up quite an audience for that address, and they
are basically saying "thank you very much, you may go"."

"A pre-motion hearing is scheduled for this thursday morning at 11am,
wit the honourable Judge McKenna presiding, in an attempt to get an
injunction to make me stop using the address mtv.com. I will update
the situation as it unfolds."

o The Latest Curry venture . . . . .

From: curryco@panix.com (Adam Curry)
Newsgroups: alt.rave
Subject: Rave Radio details

OK, here's some preliminary details.
Every week Rave Radio will be broadcast over the MBONE via rtfm's pipe, the are 
also responsible for "Internet Talk Radio.

Initially Rave Radio will be one hour long, and ofcourse the files will be
mirrored to all the known sites for ftp. RR consists of the latest House,
hardcore, mellow, progressive, trance and techno records. Many of them from
Europe, and a lot of promos! I like those the best, it's always fun guessing who
is behind them :)

The show will be free for all ofcourse, so don't worry about any of the shit I 
often get accused of.

At firs we wanted to try syndicating this show to traditional stations, but
I don't want to have to censor the records for lyrical content or myself
for thatmatter. SO we decided on doing this.

BTW, Ronald Molendijk, from Basic Beat in Rotterdam is my DJ, and talk will
be limited. We also plan to support the program heavily on mtv.com, or
whatever the new name will be for my current site. Detailed record info etc.

I'd love to hear some ideas, all input is appreciated. It's time we used this
medium to go beyond the crap most stations play. I know what alot of you might
be thinking..."Curry..rave? No way"...well, let''s just say you shouldn't judge
a book by it's cover eh?

Please email all responses to adam@mtv.com

Thanks,

Adam


o The Music Review Corner : Reviews of stuff, old and new, bad and good...

 ------------------
 Artist: Various                     Date: 1992
 Album: MIND and BODY  RMI CD #1     Length: MIND: 14 tracks, 77 minutes
 Review:                                     BODY:
 An interesting release, and one that requires alot of guts to listen to...
 The album ranges from the very bad, to the not that good, and to the wow, 
 what a neat idea.

 MIND: One the mind CD, one finds the more ambient, heavy and beatless
 music. The norm here is samples, lots of them, played loudly and obtrusively.

 The major highlights on the MIND CD were "The fall of Shartoa" by D.A.C.
 Crowell, with a hypnotic mix of uninvented string instruments played in
 dramatic sequences, and "Down at the Blue Cafe" by John Eichenseer, a very
 atmospheric mix of samples played to create the setting of a cafe. "Blue
 Cafe" was in my opinion the most origional song in the entire set. It
 blends music with theatre, technology with people and irony with blunt truth.

 Unfortunately, alot of the music has unused potential.

 BODY: While for me this was a much more plesant listen than the harsh
 sampling of MIND, this wasn't beautiful. Some of the groups were
 half-decent, the rest were fairly good. While there were no really original
 ideas or mind-boggling tracks, it is not a bad listen and I felt it was
 worth my money.

 The one song that made it to the charts, SNOG's "Born to be Mild", isn't the
 greatest song in the set, but one can say that it is the most, well, normal.
