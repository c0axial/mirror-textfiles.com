<Delerium> Hello All
<ThrdMind> also, nice choice of singer in Semantic Spaces :)
<Zippo> hi
<linenoiz> are they here?
<linenoiz> hey!
<ThrdMind> Kristy Thirsk is awesome
<Livewire> Heya!
<Lichaem> hello!
<Delerium> Were here.

<Lichaem> yes!!
<xplode> aha.. here y'are :)
<Lichaem> clap*clap*clap
<_Rick_> pheiw! :)
<linenoiz> Who's who?
* Zippo is waitinf for chaos to wear off..
<Delerium> OK. I'm (Jay) typing for Bill. Rhys might show up later.
<Livewire> I must admit, even though I don't much care for Rose Chronicles,
+she is amazing on Semantic Spaces.
<linenoiz> jeez, look at em all.
<ThrdMind> hey Jay
<Dsoul8> zippo : you don't have too wait that long I'm afraid :-)

*** Delerium is nettwerk@mindlink.bc.ca (Nettwerk)
*** on channels: @#Nettwerk
*** on irc via server elk.nstn.ca ([137.186.130.10] NSTN's Atlantic Canadian

<Lichaem> ceno!
<ThrdMind> Livewire:  Kristy's voice kicks ass
<Delerium> Bill figures she was better on Semantic as well.
<Zippo> hum... i think you better repeat that for the newcommers ;)
<dirk> yes---repeat it please..
<Delerium> We're live here at Nettwerk
<ThrdMind> delerium:  what label is FLA now on?
<Delerium> Any questions?
<Delerium> FLA is on Roadrunner.
<greendot> Are both Rhys and Bill here?
<Delerium> Just Bill is here right now.
<xplode> delerium: why leave 3rd mind?
<ThrdMind> delerium:  roadrunner?    is Will also on Roadrunner too?
<Lichaem> I believe Will no longer exists?
<linenoiz> When does FLA's Millenium come out?
<ThrdMind> Lichaem:  you like Will?   i think pearl of great price was pretty
+good
<Travis> This is odd.  I keep getting killed when I use my handle,
+"Livewiree."
<Delerium> 3rd mind disovled into Roadrunner and Will no longer exists.
<xplode> lich: that'd be tragic.. cant we say theyre asleep :)
<Travis> Livewire, I mean.
<Bones> well, delerium is still online
<Lichaem> I wish! x
<Delerium> Next question?
<dirk> Delerium: are you planning to continue with Noise Unit?
<greendot> So, why the big change in Delerium's style?  Stone tower was great.
+ This new one sounds like Enigma!
<M0RPH> delerium are you bill leeb??
<Lichaem> definitely! father forgive! ;)
<Delerium> Noise Unit will continue when time permits.
<Travis> Morph: It's Jay Sysop, typing for Bill Leeb.
<zoner_> Delerium- no more will????
<Delerium> Millenium comes Oct.11
* zoner_ cries in the corner
<ThrdMind> Delerium:  why did you decide to go with guitar samples in
+millenium
<Cenotaph> Re..
<M0RPH> did they have to pay for the pantera samples??
<linenoiz> delerium: is there rap in Millenium???
<Delerium> ThdrMind: Only half of the album is samples the other half was
+played by Devin Thowsend.
<haf> no
<Cenotaph> Bill: What label is the new Noise Unit coing out on? I heard you
+were looking??
<Delerium> ThrdMind: We wanted a harder sound and a new challenging sound
<M0RPH> will there be any more coordinate comps???
<kemper> Delerium:you mean Devon Townsend?  who sings for Vai?
<dirk> was your experience with M. Verhaegen a good one?
<Delerium> Ceno: Whoever pays the most will get Noise Unit.
<Cenotaph> Hello Yugo!
<prote> bill: why dont you have your lyrics printed with the cds?
<Travis> Morph: According to Mike Blach, two more.
<Travis> BALCH even.
<Delerium> kemper: Yes Devon is a hired guitar gun.
<Lichaem> Del:
<Cenotaph> Hehe...No Celtic Circle I guess...:)
<Lichaem> ack
<Delerium> dirk: Yes.
<Travis> Prote: GOOD ONE! :)
<M0RPH> they are onthe new one??
<kemper> brilliant! i love his work
* prote winks
<linenoiz> delerium: Is there rap in Millenium?
<greendot> Delerium:  Why the change in style?  To me, it sounded like this
+should have been an Intermix album... not delerium.
* zoner winks at prote
<ThrdMind> Delerium:  i think using heavy industrial beats is good too...like
+ministry twitch...but groups are getting much thrashier nowadays
<MarkW> Do you keep track of your sample sources?
<M0RPH> why tso many guitars on the new one doesn't that go against what
+frontline is about???
<Delerium> greendot: I don't agree. I think with the female vocals it doesn't
+sound like Intermix at all.
<xplode> mark: if not.. you do it for him :P
<dirk> when are you going to repeat a "Caustic Grip" like album, and on which
+project?
<Cenotaph> How did you get involved in mixing Penal Colony? I heard your
+emixes as well as some of the other bands involved..
* Zippo think there should be some order in this chaos
<_Rick_> Zippo: Yeah :)
<Delerium> linenoiz: Yes there is rap on Mill. "Victim of a Criminal"
<ThrdMind> heya guys......don't forget, that groups evolve!!!!
<greendot> Delerium:  I know it doesn't sound like Intermix.  But it doesn't
+sound like Delerium either.  Intermix is the closes to dance (non
+industrial)( that you do.
* Zippo think Delerium is having a hell of a job answering multiple
+questions.....
<Delerium> dirk: The new on is like Caustic Grip, plus it has guitars. Which
+is perfect for us.
<kemper> Delerium: will you be touring the SStates again for Millenium?
<prote> BILL&CO.:  why dont you print your lyrics with your cds?
<dirk> del: is it the new FLA or Delerium album?
<Delerium> kemper: We will tour USA in feb.
<M0RPH> but why the switch to guitars isn't that a sellout??
<Hayate> Lo all
<Lichaem> delerium: have you lost interest in doing a project with edward
+ka-spel? or just no time?
<ThrdMind> prote:  if you want lyrics, you can ftp them from  sites
<linenoiz> delerum: Will you tour canada too?
<ThrdMind> morph:   chill....evolution it's called
<Hayate> Lo Delerium!
<Delerium> prote: The new CD for the first we released a booklet with lyrics.
<kemper> Delerium: could we get a tour sched.?
<zoner> Delerium- do you think you will make it to most major cities?
<Delerium> Lichaem: I think it's no time and we don't know what planet Ed is
+on these days.
<M0RPH> ITS NO EVOLUTION ITS REGRESSION
<Lichaem> hahaha
<xplode> bill: gonna tour europe? we miss ya over here :)
<prote> 3rdMind..those are usually transcribed by fans..and i've seen some
+inaccuracies..
<Cenotaph> Delerium: Why a Spheres II release so quickly after the new Sem.
+Spaces??
<Delerium> zone: We'll make it to all major cities.
<Travis> Prote: It seems to be the "thing" for any industrial band.  A sense
+of mystey perhaps?
<kemper> delerium: TOUR SCHEDULE! MILLENIUM! PLZ! =] =] =] =] =]
<dirk> yes...come to Euorope!!!
* _Rick_ thinks that Delerium is quite busy :-)
<ThrdMind> prote:  very true...but they are quite close
<Delerium> xplode: We will do Europe.
<zoner> Delerium- cool beans.. make itto san diego :) hehe
<_Rick_> Delerium: Sweden?
<dirk> will you do Portugal?
* Zippo smiles
<prote> 'close' counts in horseshoes and handgrenades..heh
<M0RPH> WHAT SYNTH WAS USED IN THE BREAK IN THE MIDDLE OF MILLENIUM???
<Delerium> Ceno: Sphere's was supposed to be a double CD set. Most of the
+problem was shitty distrb.
* zoner ponders.. do portugal.. portugal has a hole? hehe jk
<ringworm> come to calgary again, we got ripped off the last time you played
+here.
<xplode> well, the japanese releases has had the lyrics?
<ThrdMind> Delerium:  i "heard"  that you might tour with LEAETHER STRIP...is
+it true?
<Travis> Delerium: And speaking of tours, aren't you neglecting your home turf
+a little bit?  Howe about some Vancouver dates?
<Delerium> M0RPH: An oberhime forbys (bad sp?)
<CoolBeans> Hey people
<Delerium> Travis: Vancouver will be the last show.
<Cenotaph> Delerium: Ahh sorry to hear that...What about the deal /w mixing
+penal Colony?? I heard your mixes..Nice! :) How did it come about??
<linenoiz> delerium: anywhere else in Canada? Orrawa?
<Hayate> Will you really tour with Leather Strip?
<linenoiz> ottawa i mean
<Travis> Figures. :)  Save a good show for us!!
<dirk> del: where are you expecting to tour in europe?
<Delerium> ThrdMind: We've talked about Leaether Strip before, but this time
+we may go with a bigger band.
<_Rick_> re Sorg
<kemper> Delerium: your show in Salt Lake City, Utah was ORGASMIC...
+Definately, one of the best if not the best shows i've ever seen... please

<xplode> hmm.. bill's getting busy.. we need a moderator?
<Delerium> morph: An anolgue synth. A beast and hard to find!
<Lichaem> tour alone!!! ;)
<Delerium> Ceno: We did a remix for pitchfork but we still aren't really crazy
+about them.
<M0RPH> DO FRONTLINE FLAN TO DO ANOTHER INTERMIX...PLEASE SAY YES??
<Hayate> That they do Rick.
<Zippo> Xplode : i think a lot agrees...
<Cenotaph> Delerium: Tour with THD! Ed would appreciate it!
<_Rick_> Delerium: What Analogue Synth?
<xplode> morh: stop screaming will ya?
<Cenotaph> Delerium: You did 2 remixes right?
<ThrdMind> cenotaph:  right on man!

<eklein> What's going on?  Everybody keeps disappearing.
<RiotNrrrd> I keep seeing mass Signoffs
<xplode> delerium: good news... how does the new intermix differ from the last
+one?
<Lichaem> IRChaos
<aTomos> Delerium...Why nettwerk records?\
<kemper> Delerium: could we get a tour schedule please? =]

<Lichaem> del: did mutual mortuary create any other songs besides shadow gods
+and hateless insanity?
<_Rick_> Delerium: A tour in Sweden with one of your bands?
<xplode> zoner: check out cold meat industry (the label) if youre looking for
+will-ish stuff (shameless plug) :)
<Zippo> Delerium : On Mindphaser there is a very special sound or sampling
+that also is on a song on Recoil's cd Bloodline... who snatched who.. or?
<BONES> I heard that Will folded because Chris Peterson didn't want to do it
+anymore.
* zoner pouts in hte corner
<Delerium> _Rick_: Sweden is for sure.
<yyy> delerium: you didn't go to Japan for TNI, did you? 
<prote> great Will album covers BTW
<hafnir> eerok - remind me how to whisper please (I ain't used IRC in 4
+years!)
<aTomos> Delerium: What ever happened to Chris?
<Cenotaph> delerium: So who else have you recently mixed for besides penal
+Colony??
<Delerium> BONES: Basically Will is over and a waste of time talking about.
<RiotNrrrd> Yugo, I thought Berkeley was in California, not Japan
<Delerium> Zoner: What's up?
<_Rick_> Delerium: Great, I heard that FLA didn't wanna come here because of
+the few listeners.
<kemper> DELERIUM: will there ever be another Cyberaktif?
<Delerium> _Rick_:Where?
<zoner> Delerium- i was whining that will is gone.. no more will. it went
+byebye :( major bummer
<ThrdMind> cenotaph:  i think they helped out with fear factor
*** Signoff: mufti (Error 0)
<Delerium> kemper: Only if hell freezes over and the moneys right.
<Cenotaph> Yeah, I ment NEW remixes...
<yyy> RiotNrrrd: yes, but I was in Japan during the last US tour... bummer
<_Rick_> Delerium: In the magazine Release (swed Mag)
<garten> delerium: can we expect to see a new intermix soon?
<BONES> Delerium:  Do you plan on bringing live guitars on tour now that
+guitars are again present in "Millenium" or will these be sampled?
<Livewire> Bill: Are you still involved with the Coordinate 0# compilations?
*** JonoB (badjoh@202.27.10.80) has joined channel #nettwerk
<Delerium> -RIck_ : Not true. We just didn't want t tour there.
<ringworm> Has there been another Coordinate CD?  I thought 01 was amazing.
<Delerium> BONES: Full metal guitars. Sez Rhys. He's here now.
<prote> DEL: do you watch any Anime?
<_Rick_> Delerium: Why not (if you don't mind me asking)
<dirk> del: are you EVER gonna tour in Portugal?
<Lichaem> Rhys!!
<Cenotaph> delerium: The Reanimate remix on Moonraker was good! Anymore
+exclusive mixes on comps. soon??
<greendot> Delerium:  If we plan an "industrial fest" would you like to
+headline?
<Delerium> Livewire: We have started a new series called Organisms 1 and 2
<_Rick_> Delerium: Skip my _ _ :-)
<Hayate> Will the tour be Frontline or Delerium?
<M0RPH> why the guitar though..I asked before and didn't get an sanswer
+..isn't that a step backwards????
<Livewire> Delerium: Really?  What's the theme??
<Delerium> Hayate: FLA! Of course.
<hafnir> I vote for an Intermix tour. But why do I doubt it'l happen....
<Hayate> I've never had the pleasure of seeing you live.
<ThrdMind> morph:   listen to it b4 you make a judgement
<kemper> Hayate: you've missed OUT! =]
<Lichaem> you're missing out!
<Delerium> FLA tour using guitars is a step forward. Not backwards.
<JonoB> Living in the middle of nowhere I'll never get to see you live :(
<M0RPH> I have ..dj friends
<BONES> Rhys:  You've been in Chicago alot lately, as recent as June (So Mercy
+says).  Are you involved in other projects in Chicago?
<nihil> Del: when fla tours, are you going to Milwaukee, WI???
<M0RPH> how do you figure???
<_Rick_> Delerium: Is you studio still Mushroom (or I'm i misstaken) or do you
+have your own?
<aTomos> Delerium: Who would you choose for a gutarist?
<kemper> TOUR SCHED!!!!???
<MarkW> The live FLA from Gashed... has guitars.
<Hayate> I'm in New Jersey and not far from NY. Where exactly do you think
+that you'll be performing? At the Ritz or Limelight?
<Zippo> Delerium : Have you got special song writing methods for your diffrent

<greendot> Delerium:  Could you define "Losts of Shit"??
<ThrdMind> woarloc:  heheehhe :)
<Cenotaph> hahaha...
<Hayate> What time do you guys got to sleep?
<dirk> Compilations: i recall the FLA song on  Latex TV Oblivion...really
+different!!
<BONES> Delerium:  how lomg does it take to do s song such as Mindphaser where
+there is just tons and tons of layering
<Delerium> insomno: Rhys: Most techo is crap. Bill: Thinks it's too much of a
+consumer product
<_Rick_> Delerium: How many PPL are involved in FLA?
<linenoiz> delerium: Will the new Intermix be aimed at the rave market?
<Delerium> We don't sleep
<Hayate> Does any one of you guys own a teddy bear? Hahahah
<Delerium> BONES: Mindphaser took 3 weeks.
<rabiez> yee haw
<Woarloc> Aphex Twin is a consumer product?
<Lichaem> here comes the process
<Delerium> linenoiz: The new INtermix is mostly tribal chanting with slow
+break beats.
<kemper> delerium: where do you get ideas for new songs?
<ThrdMind> DELERIUM:  what are your fave books/literature???????
<BONES> delerium:  only three?  yo guys are friggin' phenomenal!!!!
<hafnir> Closing the book on the Trent thing, I hope, I honestly think Trent's
+comments were dead wrong (no pun intended). Incidentally, I don't think I
+complemented you on the new FLA. I personally enjoyed it a ton.
<greendot> Delerium:  Mindphaser took 3 weeks?  How many hours a day?
+(average)
<_Rick_> Delerium: I mean in the band
*** Zippo is now known as Zippo_
<Hayate> How'd you keep track of what on such a layered song?
<rabiez> delerium: is it hard to answer all the questions at once?
<Delerium> Woarloc: Aphex Twin is a consumer product and overmarketed in
+London andf would be nice if he used more than 3 sounds per song
<dirk> R. Fulber: do you get involved in side projects like Bill?
<ThrdMind> woarloc: ain't this chaotic or what?
<insomno> what do you think about the intelligent techno scene
+...hawtin,namlock ,james,etc??
<BONES> delerium:  I'm converting a bystander here to your music
<dirk> what's intelligent about that?!
<Lichaem> consumer product? who let consolidated in the house? :>
<Delerium> dirk: Yes, producing other groups and keybopards for fear factory.
* ThrdMind *bops* trent reznor
<Woarloc> Minimalism is a style, it's hard to build a structure that works
+with few parts, instead of layering a million samples and drum/bass loops
<garten> what do you guys have to say about ripping off Egnima with Semantic
+Spaces?
<rabiez> yeah
<rabiez> answer that one
<insomno> and FSOL??
<Cenotaph> Why is that RIPPing off?!
<RiotNrrrd> dirk: plenty
<linenoiz> flatlands is good tho.
<BONES> delerium:  how much work did you do with Skinny Puppy, that is how
+involved was Bill in the songwriting and such when he was in?
<Hayate> How's your relationship with SP?
<Lichaem> to the victor goes the spoils..in re: enigma
<Delerium> Woarloc: It only takes one ply to wipe your ass, but it's nice to
+have 3 layers so your fingers don't get brown.
<Cenotaph> TONS of bands use other bands samples and stuff...BIG DEAL?!
<Lichaem> rofl
<Cenotaph> Snog is a good example..
<ThrdMind> ehehhe
<rabiez> eh
<Delerium> BONES: I sat in the same room with them.
<Woarloc> Del: nice analogy but has nothing to do with music
<_Rick_> Hahaha
<greendot> Delerium:  So you wouldn't be angry if I sampled you?
<insomno> or to cover the scabs on your fingers
*** Woarloc has been kicked off channel #Nettwerk by Delerium (Forced removal)
<MarkW> Delerium: How did you get started in music: what is your education?
<rabiez> FORCED REMOVAL. hm. sounds like the name of a song on CAUSTIC GRIP
<Delerium> greendot: I wish more people would sample us.
<Lichaem> Bill: cevin key once said you were a genius when it came to

<Delerium> LicH; Basslines are my specially.
<Lichaem> actually a phone interview that was done with cevin by someone
<Hayate> 40 more to go.
<BONES> delerium:  Are the videos you use for your live shows available
+anywhere?
<Hayate> He did him a favor.
<Lichaem> Bill: obviously! ;)
<Delerium> BONES: No live video available yet.
<Mouse> Delerium: Someone once told me that you guys did the Intermix stuff by
+pulling out all your worst records and sampling.  Is this a true account?
<dirk> here VDs are impossible to get
<BONES> delerium;  do you plan on a live video?
<rabiez> dang...
<dirk> Bill: where do you think i can order Noise Unit material?
<dwnwrd> yeah, where can we get any videos? I've heard great things about
+them.
<insomno> what does bills voice really sound like /??
<Delerium> Mouse: Partly true. The first was a parody. It was stuff he hated
+the most.
* zoner shoots that fuckin buffy outside that is luaghing for no reason.. argh

<Delerium> Hayate: Almost everything.
<Edisncrtr> Hayate: Taxes

<dirk> ra: ahahahah
<_Rick_> greendot: What kind of effects?
<Cenotaph> delerium: So what do you think about some of the new acts that

<BONES> According to a certain Mercy you do
<BONES> just kidding
<greendot> Rick:  I don't know.. I just know he wasn't using anything, and it
+sounded evil.. it was cool.
<Delerium> Ceno: It's flattering when someone tries to emulate what you do in
+there own way
<Hayate> What got you guys started and why industrial music?
<BONES> Delerium:  Is it true that after the TNI tour and release, that FLA
+went bankrupt for a period of time due to live and prod. costs?
<RiotNrrrd> deCay: that should be trying to tell you something
<_Rick_> greendot: Cool, sore throat afterward I think :)
<Delerium> aTomos: It's redundant to play local clubs till everyone hates you.
+We are not a bar band

+yelworC, etc? Do you like any of them>>
<Delerium> Hayate: we listen Industrial in 1983.

+Tactical Neuarl was a reaction to certain industrial bands turning so
+suddenly toward guitar

+spaces, which is the i bougbht?
<BONES> Dlerium:  I think alot of your older fans are pleased with the new FLA
+as well and don't feel let down
<Cenotaph> critical!
<bp14> Millenium is great.  Keep it up!
<Fiction8> doesn't capitalisism use the same philosophy?
* BONES is one of them
<Necron909> since there really hasn't been any innovation in the industrial
+genre for the last four years
<RiotNrrrd> Maybe they just like to do what they're interested in doing at the
+moment?  Whatta concept, eh?
<eerok> msg hafnir whoa
<prote> what was the last innovation necron?
<Delerium> Last statement by Rhys: We do it cause we like it. And if you don't
+like it then that's ok.
