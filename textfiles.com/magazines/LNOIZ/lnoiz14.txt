                  Tales of the Book Of Dreamscapes

"Ideas, always new ideas. We worshipped the evergrowing Net, and
    with it we grew from beeing a movement of the underground to
       becoming a new guiding light, a liberation army of the masses."


0002 / Awakening

    He wasn't the typical revolutionary - one of those you read about
in books. Either heroes living for their high ideals, or dangerous
villains, depending on your point of view. In fact he was rather dull.

    Pale from endless sessions in front of his computer, and shy from
lack of experience with people in general, he was unable to find a
girlfriend.

    And when some "friend" saw him outside, he was in a hurry, searching
trough a store for some absolute necessity before he once again went
back to his dark home, where the sound of the harddisk, and occasionally
the weird tunes created by a modem dialling a number, were the only
sounds that added to his seemingly endless hammering at the keyboard.

    His awakening came as his knowledge grew to embrace technology. As
long as all he knew was mother earth, as long as machines to him were
only cold substances which inner workings he didn't knew, he was lost.

    Truth only come to you in binary codes, he later told the children
that gathered around him like angels unseen, unheard but there. But
they already knew.

    He was never the typical revolutionary, still he was one of those
few, the silent, melancholic visionaries, that gave birth to the great
revolution - the one which at this very moment embraces us, suffocating
and liberating at the same time. The tidalwave of information that
washed away all old conventions.

    He wasn't the typical punk either. On the outside he was *the* most
conservative guy around. In his heart maybe; just maybe.

    Still his face always got a friendly, almost happy, look for a
short second those precious moments when he heard someone call him a CP,
but he always refused to label himself. Maybe he had been subject to too
much brainwash from the flamers on alt.cyberpunk, claiming such a deed
to be the most un-CP thingie one could do.

    It was his dreams that kept his rebellious mind going. The most
wonderful dreams crept into his head when he fell asleep. In his early
years it was images of earthly wonders, a beatiful sunset maybe or a
meadow bathed in light, or as he became a little older dreams of
steaming sex with hordes of women, sometimes even men, allthough he
never really could accept those feelings.

    Later his dreams grew dark. He pictured an empty sky above a naked
metal surface, and sometimes he even got to see what at a distance
seemed to be a little crack, but which when one came up close looked
like it almost parted the earth in two, no bottom within reach of his
eyes.

    In his dreams he named it the poweredge, but did not understand
what he actually meant by that name.

    As the years went by, and his dreamscapes were nurtured by his
rising knowledge, he envisioned the wonders of a virtual world, and the
Net later stood before him as the beginning of this world, a frontier
between the abstract idea of reality, and the eternity of unexplored
possibilities of cyberspace.

    His dark dreams were not so dark anymore, but occasionally his mind
granted him a glimpse of a future he sometimes feared, sometimes fell
in love with. A future where no human ever walked the surface of the
earth; Where all you could hear would be the wind and a distant sound
of machines.

    Mostly, though, he just tried to forget. To concentrate on his
fantasies.

                Square One - Part Four


        "Their computer has more meat to it than most of the stuff
I've seen lately."
        "There's no way in?"
        "Not with the deck I'm using, nope."
        There's a sigh.  My ears hand the conversation to me gently.
Behind it all is the low hiss of a ceiling fan, two actually.
        "I don't understand, why would the hospital's computer have so
much ice in it?"
        "Hospitals are part of the private sector, corps own them
nowadays.  And since corps are notorious for new ice..."
        I lay motionless, pushing the nearby conversation into the
background and pulling the memories of my week long life span to the
forefront. Everything violence. Everything blood. Everything a hunt.
        As my eyes wrench open sunlight slaps me with full force.  My
eyes beg to be shut again but my ears want to see the voices.
Softness surrounds me, caresses me.  Blankets wrap themselves about
me like welcome arms.  Across the linoleum floor on the other side of
the room stand the two voices.
        The bald one.  He drove the grey convertible.  Ambulence.
Girl. Bleeding. Leg.  Hospital.  Girl.  Rain.  Her.
        I don't know the other.  My mind see's him as much smaller, my
instinct tells me he's an easy kill.  On the back of his neck is a
small silver square.  It shines in the sunlight that now embraces
me.  Under one arm he holds what looks like a keyboard.
        Above me two ceiling fans challenge one another.  Occasionally
they turn in unison.  They wave to me.
        I move to sit.  I find a brace on my right leg, chromed and
cumbersome.  Looking into it I can see the reflection of my face and
my body, covered in bloodstained bandages.

        I still don't recognize me.

        "You're awake," the bald one walks toward me,"I didn't expect
you would be for quite some time."
        "Who are you?" I waste no time.
        His eyebrow shoots up and his head cocks.  The other one.  The
one with the keyboard, he sits down on the floor and stares like a
child.
        "Who am I?" He looks down at me, and moves closer.  Thats
when I see the gun in his hand.  The gun which was not there before.
"No my friend, I'm not the one with the identity crisis.  We want to
know who you are."

        Confusion sits with me like an old friend.

        His body is patient, his eyes are calm.  "You see I have a
friend named Kyle..."

        Kyle.  She called me Kyle.

        "...and he went missing a while back.  I've spent the past few
months trying to find him, and I managed to dig up you."  He talks
with his hands,  my eyes follow the guns movements.  Occasionally the
barrel winks at me curiously.

        "The problem being?" I ask.
        "The problem being, you look like my friend, you move like my
friend, you kill like my friend.  Everything I know tells me you're my
friend.  You can lie to my senses, but you can't lie to his."  He
points at the smaller one who now strokes his keyboard like a pet.
        I scan the apartment.  Aside from a few chairs and the blanket
covered couch that I'm sitting on there's nothing.
        The bald one turns,"You explain this part Goldie."
        The small one stands but doesn't move any closer.  He eyes me
intently, as if trying to read my reaction to him.  He's an easy
kill.
        He shifts his weight onto one leg,"You see when we were
patching you up we had to run a body scan to see how much internal
damage was done... You would have fooled any other computer you know,
but not mine."
        Baldie turns back to me and the gun is leveled at my
head,"Which leaves us with a question I will quote from you, Who are
you?"

        I don't follow a word of what they say.  My silence portrays
this.

        He pulls the keyboard up in front of him,"You're DNA pal.
There's an unexplained change in your DNA.  It's so insignificant a
difference I almost didn't pick it up."
        Goldie lets the bald one talk,"I'm going to ask you one more
time, very very slowly..."  I see a second gun slide into his other
hand from the sleeve.  Goldie edges toward the door.  His head turns
sharply.
        "Spiro someones coming up the stairs!"
        "Stay right there," The bald one says as he moves to the door.
The metallic click of two hammers being cocked in unison are almost
drowned out by the sound of a key hitting the lock.
        Thats when I see them, dropping in front of the windows.
Four men armed with submachine pistols. Wearing harnesses attached to
cords. They swing towards the expectant glass while Spiro and Goldie,
unaware, watch the door open.  I'm about to dive behind the couch,
when they hurtle through the windows blocking the sunlight, breaking
the silence, and she walks through the door.

RMI Mind/Body CD Project #2
c/o Steven Boswell
P.O. Box 22121
San Diego, CA  92192-2121

Recommended subjects for correspondence are given below, when
appropriate.

The project is divided into the following time frames:

[1] Finding interested people
[2] Artist submissions
[3] Judging
[4] Putting the CD together
[5] Collecting money, pressing the CD
[6] Shipping the CD
[7] Distribution of royalties

Here's the outline for dates:

Artist submissions: today to June 15th.  (About two months.)
Making review cassettes, getting money from each reviewer,
    sending out the review cassettes: June 15th to August 15th.
    (One month.)
Judging: August 15th to November 15th.  (Three months.)
Taking money for orders: August 1st and onward.
Pressing the CD: November 15th to December 31st.
Shipping the CDs: Late December, early January.
Distribution of royalties: When the CDs are sold out.

These rules will be adhered to as much as possible.  They may be
changed as I see fit, always in the interest of fairness.  Don't
be afraid to ask about bending the rules -- this is meant to be
a stable reference for discussion, not an inhibitor of discussion.

Here are the rules and details on each time frame.

[1] Finding interested people.

    I want to hear from people who want to submit songs, submit
    artwork, judge artwork, and/or buy the completed product.

    People who submit artwork may not be judges.  I want no
    possibility of a conflict of interest.

    Information on what each of these people need to do is
    spread throughout the rules below.  Therefore, there's no
    way to get out of reading the complete rules.  :-)

[2] Artist submissions.

    Artists may submit songs and graphic artwork.  The
    submission period will be one month.  Any submissions
    received after that time will not be considered for the
    project.  Songs may be submitted on cassette, but remember
    that a low quality recording will suffer in the ratings.
    If one of your submissions makes it onto the CD, then
    you will have to submit a higher-quality recording.
    No changes are allowed between the submitted copy and
    the final copy.

    Songs must be submitted in one of the following formats,
    in descending order of suitability:

    [1] DAT, with VTC indexing, and with a 1k tone for :30 at
        -12 db up front.  44.1kHz rate only.
    [2] 1/4" 1/2-track stereo at 30 ips, dbx I
    [3] 1/4" 1/2-track stereo at 15 ips, dbx I
    [4] 1/4" 1/2-track stereo at 30 ips, no NR
    [5] 1/4" 1/2-track stereo at 15 ips, no NR
    [6] 1/4" 1/2-track stereo at 7 1/2 ips, dbx I

    No non-NR 7 1/2 ips, no 1/4-track stereo, and _no_
    cassettes, no matter what they're encoded with.  All of the
    analogs need tones, also -- 1k@0 VU, :30/100Hz@O VU,
    :30/10k@0 VU, :30/1k@0 VU, :30 are preferred, but just the
    1k tones are OK in a pinch, all at -12db.  These are needed
    mostly to find out what your concept of -12db is so your
    final recording can be at the proper level.

    Any questions about recording format should be mailed to the
    recording enginner, D.A.C. Crowell, at dacc@tigerden.com.

    Recordings should be of the highest quality possible.  The
    quality of recordings will probably affect the judge's
    scores.  The submitted recording will be the one placed on
    the CD, should the entry be selected: no "new and improved"
    versions may be submitted after the song has been selected
    to appear on the CD.

    An artist may submit a maximum of two songs.  A maximum of
    one song from a single artist may appear on the final CD.

    Mail your submissions to the above address, marked "Music
    submission".

    Graphic art may be submitted in original form (not
    recommended) or in digital form in any popular
    Macintosh-readable format (recommended).  Art may be either
    snail-mailed or sent via ftp to primus.com in the directory
    /pub/rmi-cd/incoming, using the submitter's e-mail address
    as a filename.  (Following the submission with a letter to
    rmi-cd@primus.com is appreciated.)  Your e-mail or
    snail-mail should be marked "Graphic artwork submission".
    Snail-mail should be prominently labeled "DO NOT BEND" or
    else the Post Office will cram it into my P.O. box.  And
    even then, it's iffy, which is why electronic submission is
    preferred.

    Graphic art can be full-color, but must look good when
    shrunk to the size of a CD booklet panel, approximately
    120 mm by 120 mm.  An artist may submit a maximum of one
    graphic.

    Artists who wish their artwork returned to them must enclose
    a self-addressed stamped envelope.

    Artists whose work is selected to appear on the final CD
    must sign a form giving me permission to use their work and
    absolving me of any liability for any samples etc. used in
    the work.

[3] Judging.

    Anyone who has not submitted artwork may volunteer to be a
    judge.

    Once all of the artwork has been submitted, reviewing
    cassettes will be made, and color copies of some sort will
    be made of all submitted graphic artwork.  The cost of
    producing the review cassettes and graphic artwork will be
    split among the reviewers and each will need to pay that
    amount, plus shipping, in order to be a reviewer.  Because
    of this, the review materials are the property of the
    reviewer.  The only restriction is that copies of individual
    pieces may not be made, or played on the radio or whatever,
    without the consent of the artist.

    Each reviewer will have three months to review the artwork
    and submit scores.  The name of each reviewer that submits
    scores will be printed in the credits of the CD.

    Each song and graphic artwork will be given a numerical
    score, from 0 (the lowest rating) to 100 (the highest
    rating).  Art may be rated on whatever the reviewer feels
    appropriate.  Examples of criteria include recording
    quality, skill of execution, and "industrialness", whatever
    that means.  Shorter songs should be preferred over longer
    songs, since there is limited space (78 minutes) available
    on each CD.

    Scores may be returned via snail-mail or e-mail.  Scores
    should also include the opinion of the reviewer as to
    whether the song is "ambient" or "dance".  These opinions
    will be used to determine the CD (Mind or Body) that the
    song will appear on, should it be selected.

[4] Putting the CD together.

    Once the scoring is complete, the master tapes and artwork
    will be made.  The CDs will consist of the top-rated songs.
    The top-rated songs considered to be ambient will be put
    onto the "Mind" CD and the top-rated songs considered to be
    modern/dance will be put onto the "Body" CD.  This line may
    be blurred in order to put a higher-rated song onto the disc
    over a lower-rated one.

    The top-rated graphic artwork will become the cover.  The
    runners-up will be placed in other places on the booklet or
    inlay card as space permits.

[5] Collecting money.

    At some point, probably during the judging, those who showed
    interest in buying the final product will be asked to send
    their money.  Once there is enough money to press the CD, it
    will be pressed.

    The CD will be pressed by CEI Industries, who offloads work
    to Ritek of Taiwan.  They did the last RMI Mind/Body CD and
    are a very reliable company.  The artwork will be printed by
    Riddle Press, based in Oregon.  They did the last RMI
    Mind/Body CD artwork.

    Each CD will be numbered.  The artists who appear on the CD
    will get the lowest numbers.  Those who pay sooner will
    receive the next lower-numbered CDs.  I will keep the first
    10, in any case.

    Each 2-CD set will cost $10, plus shipping.  Shipping
    depends on how many CDs you order and where you live.
    Please don't send me money without asking me for a total
    first.  You may buy insurance for your order, if you wish:
    $50 worth of insurance is 75 cents, and it goes up from
    there.  (Insurance is provided by the U.S. Postal Service.)

[6] Shipping the CD
    
    Once the CDs have been pressed, they will be shipped to those
    who have paid, in the order they paid.  They will be shipped
    by U.S. Mail.

    Any band or graphic artist with a track or graphic in the
    final CD will get a free copy.

[7] Distribution of royalties

    For the first pressing, I will press as many CD sets as I
    think I can reasonably sell, but no less than 1000.  Each
    artist that was selected to appear on the CD, including the
    graphic artists, will get royalties.

    On the first 1000 CDs, half of the profit will go to me, and
    the other half will be split amonst the artists.  This
    reflects the huge amount of work it takes to do a project
    like this.  I will see less of any profit on CDs past the
    first 1000, to reflect the decreased amount of work.  If I
    am able to get mainstream distribution for the compilation,
    through a record label or something, my compensation will
    approach zero, and the artists will receive everything.

 Artist: Enigma                      Date: 1990
 Album: M C M X C  a.D.              Length: 7 tracks, 40 minutes
 Review: The first (to my knowledge) release by Enigma, the pop/techno
   group with that new hit 'Return to Innocence'. The album has it's strong
   points, and it's misgivings. The main samples used in most of the songs
   is a traditional Gregorian chant, creating a somewhat mystical atmosphere.
   Combined with the annoying panflute sample and the sexy french female
   vocals, it can be pleasent to listen to (although the heavy breathing
   can really get on your nerves). The major disapointment was in the
   percussion samples. Every song has the same overused techno beat, a
   minus ten for origionality. Finally, I'd say it's nice to have on tape,
   but I wouldn't buy the CD.
 Erland Rating: - 1

 Artist: Enigma                      Date: 1993
 Album: the CROSS of changes         Length: 9 tracks, 45 minutes
 Review: The second release by Enigma proved to be an improvement from their
   last album. While the group tends to use the same beat every now and then
   (listen to 'Return to Innocence' to hear it), this CD does present itself
   as being more origional then their first. Comparitavely, 'the CROSS' is
   less dynamic, losing the mystic feel of the first, but it gains in the
   use of more samples, more instruments and more vocals. The vocals are much
   more predominant in this release, the tracks showing a strong influence
   towards commercial pop. So much, that the inlay has ordering info for 'fan'
   merchandise, a big dissapointment. It's quite a short CD, the time unevenly
   spread out leaving some songs at +6 min. and others at -3min. Musically,
   'Return to Innocence' is not the best song on the album (a whole 3
   chords!), there are some very well put together pieces that will never make
   it in the charts. A good buy, if you're into this stuff.

 Artist: Various Artists              Date: 1993(?) 1994 here...
 Album: CYBERSPACE                    Length: 12 tracks, 76 minutes
 Review: A Positive Surprise
 Description: CYBERSPACE was advertised as a collection of trance techno.
   I saw a showy commercial on the TV and expected the album to be like the
   usual stuff: full of disco hits and definite money makers. Well, my
   first impressions were a little bit confusing, because after listening,
   I remembered there had been one or two tracks that could perhaps be
   called hits, but didn't remember that much of the others. The music had
   flowed fluently and I had surely enjoyed it. Had I been tranced? Now,
   weeks later, CYBERSPACE is still a difficult CD to review. Many of the
   tracks are somewhat out of the ordinary and surprisingly personal. A
   couple of them really meet my idea of good trance: hardcore basses with
   pulsating beats create an excellent atmosphere of hypnosis. CYBERSPACE
   has reached a successful whole: the tracks fit nicely into each other,
   and although some of them sound more like house instead of trance, it
   doesn't really bother. The other side of the coin is that nothing really
   bounces onto your face; no track really sticks into your mind. But
   perhaps that's what trance is all about. It's the state of mind that
   counts, not the music it's reached with. One more note of the nice-
   looking cover picture. A guy with a virtual reality helmet and a data
   glove, and the texts "information wants to be free" and "cyberspace is
   the beginning of a new era". Sounds like a cliche, yes, but fits into
   the theme nevertheless.

 Artist: path8                           Date: 199?
 Album: techno animal                    Length: 8 tracks, 72 minutes
 Review: Perfect when you're in the mood, when you want to listen to
   nothing but noises put together with a sampler.
 Description: If you're looking for experimental industrial, this is the
   album for you. The endless tracks consist mainly of noizy samples of
   all kinds, sometimes tied together with a simple beat. Some meditative,
   never-ending tones that some open-minded might consider to be melodies.
   If you're not in the correct mood, you'll probably get a headache.
   When feeling extremely dull, techno animal should be able to lift you
   up from the swamp. Aggressive? path8 will either make you mad or truly
   calm you down, depending on _how_ aggressive you feel. It would make a
   nice soundtrack for a cyberpunk movie, but is hardly recommended for
   the occasional music lover. Who should check techno animal out? Nobody
   who's looking for traditional melodies or dancefloor hits. If you're
   really into experimental stuff, have a listen before buying. Not for
   anybody who gets a migraine easily. A plus from the images on the
   booklet.
