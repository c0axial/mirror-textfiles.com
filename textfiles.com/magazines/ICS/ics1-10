    Well, it does get lonely in the editor's chair toward the end of the 
semester. As you can tell from the table of contents, most of this issue 
is the product of my lone voice; yea, and I went forth into cyberspace, 
untethered and alone ... way too melodramatic. Sorry. Anyway, In this 
issue: Jason tries on the epic form for his poetic vision, I bring you 
the second part of my series on CMC (electronic brainstorming software, 
this time), Damian Riddle, a new contributor to ICS (local) offers another 
poem, and your humble editor winds up the frag with a short story.
    The story was fun to write - drop me a short note if the premise or 
the protagonist seems familiar. I'm interested in finding out if this is 
one of those "cultural" stories which reaches many people. I guess it's 
all part of developing as a writer, this search for the culturally 
relevant stories that need to be told. But, hey, it's supposed to be 
entertaining first and foremost, so enjoy. 
    We'll be back in a couple weeks with the last issue of this term. 
we plan on producing two issues (or four frags) over the summer. So, if 
you'll be offline during break or away or need us to suspend delivery 
for a while, let us know.

DEATH OF A NATION  (Part 1)

It has begun!
The world has ended!
Lest, of course,
The rift can be mended.
They have started arriving
Through the hole they have made
In the fabric of space
When their master, them bade.

The invaders are here!
I fret for the ones
Who have not foreseen
That thus the end comes.

Death has little meaning
For these abhorrations.
They merely desire
The end of all nations.

They arrive by the hundreds,
The thousands, the millions,
And as they arrive,
They build their pavilions,
From which they can strike,
North, East, South, and West.
The human resistance
Will prove who is best!

I will be the leader,
As I know their plan.
If any can stop them,
The resistance can.

To all the people,
Great people and small,
I give you this message;
"Please heed our call"!
We will need all
The support we can get!
We will not give up
On victory yet!

The first attack!
It happened at eight.
These creatures
Are taught only to hate!

Machine gun fire
Filled up the night.
The people around me
Tried to scream out their fright.
We started resisting,
And killed some of them, too.
Though they were all dead,
We knew we still weren't through.

More of them came
And began to slaughter.
I heard my friend scream
As they killed her daughter.

They arrived en masse
That they could kill more.
Some began to revel
Insane from the gore!
You could see thousands
In a grenade's light.
The people retreated
From Death's unholy rite!

We will be triumphant,
I am sure of that now.
There are few of us left,
But we will win somehow!

                       ---------------------------
  
  
      In the first part of this series, I examined some of the initial     
Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) research conducted by Kiesler et.al.  
during the 1980s. From that work, I take five central questions which in- 
variably surface in subsequent research examining other, newer forms of CMC. 
These questions are: 
    
          --------------------------------------------------------             
          | Five Aspects of computer-mediated communication (CMC)|
          |    1) Time/Information processing pressures          |
          |    2) Absence of regulating feedback                 |
          |    3) Dramaturgical weakness                         |
          |    4) Few status/position cues                       |
          |    5) Depersonalization of social anonymity          |
          |______________________________________________________|

    In this, the second part of this series, I will examine recent research  
on electronic brainstorming software (EBS). Most of you are probably familiar  
with the traditional form of collaborative brainstorming which occurs in  
business and education. The basic idea is to gather people in a room and  
generate ideas in a free-form manner. Driven by a human sense of synergy,  
the traditional face-to-face form remains popular despite empirical studies  
that debunk claims of its efficacy (Gallupe 28).  
    Recent innovations in software development have brought the idea of EBS  
into the hands of corporate America in the form of programs such as Group- 
systems and Teamfocus. EBSs take the original brainstorming concept and bring  
it to LANs, dividing the process into its constituent parts. 
    The first step in the process - generating ideas - takes advantage of  
anonymous keyboarding in order to encourage participants to share ideas they  
probably wouldn't voice in a face-to-face setting. Aspects 2 and 4 are turned  
into advantages at this stage - without regulating feedback or status cues,  
inhibitions fade and more ideas are expressed. In a comparative study involving 
over eight-hundred people, EBS groups "have consistently been more productive  
than traditional brainstorming groups ... productivity advantages have ranged  
from 25 to 50 percent for four person groups and to nearly 200 percent for  
twelve person groups" (30). The same study notes "the advantages of parallel  
entry, anonymity, and, no doubt, novelty serve to make electronic brain- 
storming a much more productive way to brainstorm, particularly among larger  
groups"(30). While these programs overcome traditional problems of inhibition  
and "status-weighting", they lead to problems in the editing phase.
     Time and information processing problems mark the editing phase of EBS.  
Eliminating redundant ideas is described as the "grueling part." Anticipating  
such a problem, some of the available programs (in this case Groupsytems)  
offer a tool which enables users to "create his or her own categories for the  
ideas that have been generated. By scanning all the ideas generated, each group 
member can assign each idea to any number of categories. This process makes it  
easier for the group to identify similar ideas and combine or discard those  
that are redundant" (31). While sorting tools may speed the process up, asking  
participants to avoid obvious or trite ideas would seem to be a good idea.
    The next phase in the process, evaluation, also presents some problems.  
Traditionally, status and position determine the relative weight of an   
individual's influence. Recognizing the needs of corporate users, software  
developers have incorporated "rank-order voting" features to prioritize ideas  
according to consensus, or, in some cases, by caveat of management. Although  
weighted voting may streamline the process, "the anonymous evaluation of ideas  
is an important feature of EBS technology. We have all had the experience of  
seeing ideas adopted because they were advocated by powerful individuals.  
Once this happens, a groupthink process can produce unanimity on what some  
(privately) believe to be a bad idea" (32). Expanding on this theme, the  
authors note that "all the EBS procedures are designed to equalize power  
within the group ... when this [differential weighting] is done - and we        
acknowledge our misgivings about violating the power equalization feature  
of EBS - it should be made explicit that not everyone is equal in the    
group and why" (32). It is easy to see the resistance such equalization  
will engender in a hierarchical, profit-driven, competitive arena.
    Any resistance to the EBS process will likely surface in the next phase:  
implementing the ideas generated in a EBS session. Most of these programs  
offer a "window" style feature that allows individuals to enter steps used to  
define a "plan-of-action" for any given idea. If the plans are followed,  
employees seem to feel their efforts are worthwhile, and psychologically, they  
are likely to feel that "equalization of power" EBS offers. On the other hand,  
if management manipulates resources and funding to determine a course of  
action, employees may feel cheated and used at some level. 
    As with any new technology, the potential for abuse conditions the 
possibilities for progress. Generalizing from their research, the authors  
of this study provide two short lists of advantages and disadvantages of EBS:

    Advantages                                   Disadvantages
*Parallel entry of ideas                   *May be oversold as cure-all
*Anonymity                                 *Requires keyboarding skills
*More good ideas generated                 *Loss of power for senior people 
*Higher satisfaction with process          *Loss of social interaction
*Large groups can be effective             *Overload during idea editing
*Can be used by both face-to-              *Cost of facilities and 
  face and dispersed groups                  software    
*Records ideas for future                  *Not all topics are suitable
                     (34)                                           (35)

These lists give a concise view of the surface features of the medium; 
however, the deeper issues of control, office politics, and credit for
"intellectual property" will most likely determine if this sort of system 
actually gets adopted by a business organization.
    The "organization man" moving up a ladder of success in the traditional  
capitalistic sort of corporation will probably view the anonymity inherent  
to the EBS process threatening. As individual "scoring" systems give way to  
"team-based" measures of performance, the Horatio Nelson model of success  
undergoes a transformation from one of individualistic endeavor to one of  
collective, or team success. In cultures which already use team-oriented  
tactics to achieve their goals (e.g. Japan), EBS programs can be adopted  
with a minimum of resistance. In highly individualistic cultures (such as  
the U.S.), a "new order" of business practices must evolve in order for  
corporations to reap the potential benefits of EBS-style programs.           
    The basic purpose of CMC software is to exchange knowledge. Corporate  
America's interest in the medium reflects the growing role knowledge often  
plays in defining economic realities, good or bad. In a recent interview,  
Peter Drucker (known as the father of modern corporate management) stated  
"international economic theory is obsolete. The traditional factors of   
production - land, labor, and capital - are becoming restraints rather than  
driving forces. Knowledge is becoming the one critical factor of production.  
It has two incarnations: knowledge applied to existing processes, services,  
and products is productivity; knowledge applied to the new is innovation"  
(Drucker 80). Citing numerous examples of efficiency gains in corporate  
America, Drucker identifies a strong link between business success and the  
application of knowledge in design processes. It seems the dual pressures of  
international competition and mass marketing are forcing national and multi- 
national corporations to react to the growing sophistication of their business  
rivals and their customers.
    Determining the course of that reaction may prove to be the defining 
moment for many workers in the American economy. Systems such as EBS offer  
one possible method of cultivating the "knowledge base" that will give   
corporations a competitive edge in the emerging "post-capitalist" economy of  
the 21st century. 
    In the third installment, I will examine Group Decision Software Systems  
(GDSS), another form of CMC which may challenge the existing forms of corporate 
management. Stay Tuned ...

          Introverted Psyche                     
 
          
I frivolously disdain my outward appearence,
Frequently subsiding to the injections of eternal thought.
Crumbling slowly, logically at first, then wild,
Stumbling, bumbling out of reality.
My first reaction was no - no way!
Then I accepted the tedious chore and
Threw - it - away.
You know what I don't care
peace of mind is satisfaction enough. 
Life is cruel and I deserve it.
I will strive to be levelheaded and
full of meaning. Meaning is substance 
constant, relative thoughts, those 
which make us whole. Those that live and bleed.
The beast is inside us, exorcise the beast and you're in.
Only excessive force binds my style.
I realize I extrude, and
I retort inwardly, instantly.

         *Damian*

   Coffee and cigarettes: as Ron reached for his Camels, he scorched his  
tongue on the icky-sweet flavored coffee his secretary had just brewed.  
Hot cherry and white chocolate flooded his throat as he tried to choke down  
the viscous fluid; his eyes began to water and his hands started to shake.  
Ron coughed and sent a perfect stream of java splashing down: a direct hit,  
right into the middle of his keyboard. Cursing silently, he stabbed the
intercom button:
     --Marcy ... could you come here, my keyboard is down again.
     --I'll bring the spare ...
     Ron set down his mug and picked up the sodden keyboard. He began to  
shake the little brown droplets out onto the carpet, hoping to cover his  
slop before Marcy arrived. She'd been after him for months to get used to  
his new "secretary," and this was the third unit he'd trashed this month.  
It was starting to look deliberate, and the man upstairs had his "quota"  
of time "on-line" to measure, quantify, digitize, whatever they did with  
the little blips when Ron was done with them. He was glaring at the screen
when Marcy entered:
     --What happened, Ron ... ashes or fluids?
     She had the spare keyboard tucked under one arm; Ron thought it looked  
like some sort of new appendage, perhaps the wing she was using to fly away.
     --Coffee again, Marcy. That thing's a damn magnet.
     --Well, scoot out of the way, and I'll have you back up again in just a  
minute. Really, Ron ... you'd better get used to it being there.
     --Yeah, I know. Say, could you bring up those new sales forms for me?  
I keep getting lost in the windows.
     Marcy began to trace the cord to the back of the machine. Her movements  
had a confidence that Ron had never really noticed before. Ron started to  
thumb through his ancient rolodex, looking for his first calls of the day.  
Marcy stood up, tapped a few keys, and fixed Ron with a cold look:
     --There you go. Now which form did you want?
     --Carlson's little gem. It's called sp or spr94 or something.
     --O.K., watch ...
     Marcy grabbed the mouse and began pointing and clicking.
     --First, get out of this directory ...
     As Marcy droned on, throwing acronyms and clipped references at Ron,  
he thought back to his first regional spring sales campaign. Marcy had just  
started working for him, so fresh out of high school he could smell the  
bubblegum on her breath. He ran her like a dog, another order damn near  
every hour. And she had kept coming back for more. He missed that loyalty,  
those trusting quiet eyes.
     --O.K., now you're in the dbase ...
     God, he had power back then. Ron had owned his own region, sales were  
booming, and a man's personal secretary worked for him, not some damn machine. 
Marcy was staring at him, waiting:
     --Yeah, that's the one. How do I send them again?
     --Just like anything else, Ron, hit Control-Z and Enter.
     Marcy glanced out the door, then back at Ron.
     --Anything else?
     --Um, yeah, if you could get me the southeast Indiana figures from last  
year, I could get on the horn and maybe accomplish something.
     --I'll forward them right away.
     --No, no ... on paper, Marcy. I need the whole screen.
     --O.K., Ron, let me fire up the printer.
     Ron watched Marcy make her way out the door, quietly lusting after the  
Old Marcy, the girl he could manipulate. It had been years, but Ron still  
remembered the soft tenderness of his old conquest. Her quiet ease with  
numbers, with so-called logic, had changed everything. At first, that skill  
had made her valuable (Ron hated math); ultimately, it gave her the upper hand. 
Carlson was looking to promote her right out of the building; West Coast
was looking for bright minds ...
     Ron fired up a Camel and reached for his dog-eared rolodex. Flipping  
through, he stopped on a new one: fresh meat. Ron picked up the phone and  
started dialing, his fingers stabbing the buttons as he rifled through a pile  
of paper. In the background, a printer began its furious ticking and whirling.

                   *                   *                   *

     After a fruitless morning of cold calls, Ron had to face Carlson.   
The young turk of management, Carlson was obsessed with the machines. From  
his desk, he could monitor all the sales reports from the building as they  
were entered; everything was defined on his screen.
     The meeting was, of course, in his office: lots of chairs arranged in a  
web pattern around the terminal, a blinking cursor ready to reveal the frozen  
figures of a month's work.
     --Ron. I'm glad you're here early. I've been meaning to talk to you,  
I haven't seen you logged on much lately. Come on, old man, everybody's got  
to be part of the team. Let's face it ... nobody, not even you, can make sense  
out of that pile of dead trees on your desk. HQ wants it all digital, and if  
you can't get it online, Ron, you're going to be history.
     --Right, Carlson. All the ram in the world can't give you my contacts,  
my reputation. Twenty-five year's worth. Look, kid, HQ doesn't want me swingin' 
over to the other side, so save your empty threats.
     The other agents began to filter in. The monthly meetings had changed.  
All the ladies who used to remain safely behind their Selectrics had arrived,  
invading Ron's old domain and threatening his margin with their aggressive
forays into his territory.
     Carlson's monitor beeped and he began:
     --Good to see everybody. I've been watching, and I'm pleased to say that  
most of you have posted good numbers. Most of you even found the new form.  
Keep using it for now, I'll post an updated version after the spring season.  
As you all know, the secretarial pool will only be available on a limited basis 
from now on. So get used to those keyboards, men. These ladies are too valuable 
on the lines; they're not going to correct your grammar forever. Speaking of  
ladies ... congratulations Marcy, you win the bonus for this month: Marcy  
posted the best numbers, part or full time.
     --Thanks, Mr. Carlson. Our product sells itself, really.
     Carlson beamed, his latest convert shining brightly.
     --Mr. Carlson, I want you to know, I didn't make it happen on my own.  
Ron laid the groundwork in that area ... and your form kept me on track.
     Ron glanced at Marcy, then down at the floor. Carlson tapped a few keys,  
grabbed his mouse, and started clicking away. In a moment, he found what he  
wanted and swiveled the monitor around. On the screen, a chart listed the  
active areas and the numbers for last month, last year, and the averages for  
the last ten years. Ron noticed his territory was now called C-12:
     --Carlson, them old numbers are a lie. The law of averages don't obey you  
or anyone else. You can't expect us to maintain a quota based on a different  
time, a different world.
     --Ron, I hear you. Those numbers are for me. Do your best to hit the  
target. We need you on the team; don't worry about it.
     --Then stop breathing down my neck for those damn forms. I'll do    
my job ... the way I've been doing it for the last twenty-five years.
     --Relax, Ron. The machine is just another tool. And since we're all  
using it, the least you could do is try and join the rest of the world.
     Marcy tried to shrink into the background. Open conflict still made her  
nervous, and she thought Ron was making a fool of himself; a dinosaur stomping  
in the tar. She couldn't help feeling a little sorry for the old man, he had  
shown her so much.
     --Look, Ron, I don't care how much coffee you dump on your keyboard,  
that unit stays in your office. Get used to it. And just so you know, I drafted 
Marcy's transfer orders to San Jose this morning ... she won't be replaced.  
Starting next month, you fly on your own, buddy.
     Ron looked stricken as the news sank in. Marcy nervously shook the glad- 
hands and avoided looking at Ron. Her old hero was on his way down, and she  
felt a twinge of guilt. After all, she had done more than her share to bring  
the master dbase online. But, then again, Ron had used her, in many ways.  
Marcy steeled herself and leveled a gaze at Ron:
     --Thanks, Ron. For everything. I know you'll be O.K., you don't need me. 
     --Well, I guess that's that, Marcy. Good luck.

                 *                   *                   *

    The spring campaign was winding down, and Ron was alone in his office.  
His numbers were terrible, and he was stuck in some directory. No coffee,  
no Marcy, and no more mousing around.
     Ron flicked the switch on his power-strip, and grabbed a pen and his  
trusty legal pad. He slapped the keyboard on top of his monitor, cleared a  
space on his desk, and began dialing in a last-ditch effort:
     --Ralph, old boy, it's Ron. Can we talk? I know you've been buying from  
SunStar lately, but I need a favor. I need to move some product, and I'm ready  
to call a few in.
     --Ron, you sound desperate ... and I wish I could help, but things just  
ain't the same. Schumann would have a cow if I made someone reprogram the  
invoice code.
     --Invoice Code! Christ, Ralph, did you just say Invoice Code? Don't tell  
me they've gotten to you, too. What the hell is the point, anyway?
     --Beats me, Ron. Twenty years ago, they told us to send our kids to MIT.  
Now, them kids are runnin' us through the better mousetrap. Go figure ...
     --Yeah, don't I know it. See you at the club tonight?
     --Not tonight, Ron. Gotta go.
     Ron hung up and tried another number:
     --Hello, John Farris, please.
     --I'm sorry, Mr. Farris no longer works here. Would you care to speak  
to another member of our staff?
     --No. What happened to Farris?
     --He retired last month, I think. If you're interested, I could connect  
you to his replacement, Mr., ah, what did you say your name was ...
     --Forget it.
     Ron placed the headset on his shoulder and lit another Camel. After  
brooding for a moment, he got up to make some real coffee, none of that  
sweet stuff. There was a new girl at Marcy's old desk; she pointedly ignored  
Ron as he measured the grounds and water. Her monitor beeped, and she clicked  
to attention. E-mail from Carlson Central, no doubt.
     While he waited for his java to brew, Ron tried to make small talk:
     --How goes the battle?
     --Excuse me, did you say something?
     --Yeah, how goes it? If you'd like some good numbers, let me know ...  
I can dig some out.
     --No, that's O.K., Mr. Carlson has me working from the updated list.  
Thanks, anyway.
     She turned back to her screen, oblivious to Ron's lurking presence.  
She was young, as Marcy had once been. But this one was untouchable, as alien  
to Ron as the Inventory Code.

                   *                   *                   *

     May 15th, the end of the spring season. It was a bright, cool day and  
Ron was spiking his coffee with some very old brandy. He fixed his gaze on the  
blinking cursor and raised his mug:
     --A toast ... to progress, march on.
     Carlson was on his way down; the machine had crunched all of his    
numbers, and Ron's time was up. On his pad, in longhand, Ron had prepared  
his resignation. Why not. It was over: the boys were deep down in Florida,  
the kids owned it all now. Ron picked up his old rolodex, leaned back in his  
chair, and began plucking cards from the spindle. One by one, he flipped them  
into the trashcan, a vacant smile on his face.

   In today's technology based cultures and cliques there is a common 
interest in ideas that revolve around "CyberSpace."  This term was first    
popularized by William Gibson in his award winning book _Neuromancer_.    
Gibson presented computer networks as a global medium of power. Similar  
situations were described in books such as _Shockwave Rider_ by John Brunner.   
Brunner's literature predates Gibson's and is perhaps more accurate in terms  
of today's emerging computer networks.  The difference between CyberSpace in  
Brunner's and Gibson's books is that of perception.  In Brunner's book,  
cyberspace was viewed much as the internet is perceived today, but on a  
grander scale that could very well be a forcast of the future of the internet. 
Gibson's _Neuromancer_, on the other hand, projected the idea of a new   
interface.
   Gibson initiated the world to a new idea for a user interface.        
To understand the major leap in the Gibsonian vision one must understand  
what a user interface is.  A user interface is the method by which YOU,  
the user interfaces (accesses) the computer.  Computers initially had almost
no interface at all when one recalls the TOGGLE switches of the first
computers. This was followed by punch cards which were equally
unfriendly. The step-up from these now prehistoric interfaces was the
development of the Command Line Interface (CLI).  This enabled one to
type on a keyboard and have the typed-in material appear on a screen.
The user would then press RETURN (ENTER on some machines) and that
COMMAND would be processed by the computer.  This was a purely TEXT
interface.  This changed with the work of XEROX PARC research teams.
They were working on a Graphic Interface.  This interface was the
predecessor of the Macintosh, Amiga, GEOS, Windows, and several other
interfaces.  These interfaces are the CURRENT top of the line method
for user interaction with a computer.  This interface is a Graphical
User Interface (GUI).  Now one has a better foundation to understand
the vision of William Gibson.
   Gibson introduced what might be called a Sensory User Interface.      
This is a term just invented in this article. The interface as relayed by
Gibson involved all the senses and in fact was a step beyond the idea of  
Virtual Reality (VR) as practiced today. In Gibsonian CyberSpace a person  
perceives other users in computer systems around them as well as always  
being in a setting that corresponds to the contents of a computer and other  
computers in a geographical region.

ENTER MYTHOLOGY

   Gibsonian ideas were created on a typewriter by a man who admits to
knowing little about computers at the time. This is one of those fateful
situations where a person of little background in a field gains insight
into something that those in the KNOW were not aware of. His idea brought  
hope for more intimacy, realism, and excitement in the future of computing.   
Quickly the Gibsonian ideas were embraced as THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING.
   While the Gibsonian ideas should be used as a source of inspiration,
the current abilities of computers and the way they handle data causes
several blocks which inhibit the Gibsonian vision. These problems are
in areas of geopositional realism and speed.
   The Gibsonian vision pitches the computer user into a computer world  
that parallels that of the real world. If you JACK IN to your CyberDeck  
and look around you will notice that your next door neighbor is also 
jacked in. You will then look into the distance and see a sensory image  
for every computer in your neighborhood. In the distance, you will see the  
towering computer nets of local businesses. This is the geopositional aspect  
of Gibsonian cyberspace. Enter the problem.
   Computer networks do not work in a fashion that will enable this
geopositional aspect to function. Your computer does not know the difference  
between crossing a satelite uplink to reach the next computer and crossing a  
desk. Without this knowledge available to the computer, it would be difficult  
to establish a perspective of SURROUNDING LOCAL COMPUTERS. Likewise, computer  
networks function from computer to computer. Your computer can identify  
whichever computers it is directly linked to and none beyond. Using modern  
network protocols, you can still communicate with computers beyond your own.  
There is no guarantee that those computers exist until your request for that
computer traverses the net and either succeeds or fails and bounces back. 
   The second problem that makes Gibsonian CyberSpace an unlikely future is  
the issue of speed. Take a moment... Consider the processing speed required  
to maintain the position and state of every USER and COMPUTER in your network  
vicinity. IMMENSE processing time. It has been said by some computer     
researchers that the real time RAY TRACING (Image processing) that would  
enable VR of a minimum level to produce effects such as those seen in the  
movie _Lawnmower Man_ would require a computer with a processing speed of  
at least 400 million instructions per second (400 MIPS). Current desktop  
computers average around 10 to 20 MIPS. This is the speed necessary to   
maintain JUST the visual aspect of realistic VR. Gibsonian CyberSpace has  
full sensory aspects (visual, touch, smell, taste, and sound) as well as  
maintaining accurate geopositional setting and still leaving room to run  
other programs. The speed of ANY computer interacting with a Gibsonian net  
would have to be IMMENSE to the point of being most likely unattainable.

   While these problems may place Gibsonian CyberSpace in the halls of
mythology, Gibson's vision can still be an inspiration to the programmers
of today. New interfaces that are attainable can be created and implemented  
on even today's limited computer power.

   GEOPOSITIONAL: The geopositional aspect can be maintained by a series  
of localized computers that I refer to as MAP NODES. The sole purpose of  
these computers would be to respond to queries and send geopositional    
information to local computers. The map node would also handle incoming  
messages of computers coming on and off-line and update its "MAP"        
correspondingly.

   SPEED:  While keeping it real-time is currently unattainable, the
"MAP" updates could be often enough to make it workable. This would
not be a problem as long as each MAP NODE was only responsible for a
limited area.

   VR: The VR aspect could be accomplished by creating a simple
communication protocol for the MAP NODES that would enable them to pass
on quick graphic information with query responses. All that would be
[Brequired would be a program that can interpret and react to these
graphic messages for each platform (computer).

   Visionary thinking is useful no matter its plausibility. 
     Let all mistakes be a gateway to further knowledge.

	Love is the greatest feeling I have ever come across.  Love can 
cause people to do strange things.  Love can make nice people into jealous  
fools, or turn mean people into nice (but lovesick) people.
	Here's how it all started.  I was minding my own business, just 
killing time and a few other things, when she walked into my life.  She 
was beautiful.  I offered to help her get some experience in life, and 
she accepted.  We walked and talked together for a while.  We discovered 
that we had a few things in common.  We also discovered that we shared 
some interests.  Soon, I began looking for her whenever I was in the 
neighborhood.  
	Now that you know that, let me begin my tale:

	I am waiting for her to arrive at the airport.  I am beginning 
to get nervous.  "Is she even going to come?" I ask myself.  I am 
beginning to think about all of the time that we have spent together,    
and I think, "Yes, she'll be here."
	Her flight is due in in ten minutes.  How do I look?  What 
will I say?  Will she recognize me?  Will I recognize her?  I may not 
have decided to quit smoking soon enough, or maybe I shouldn't have?  
No, it was the right time to quit.  She will recognize me.  I will
recognize her.
	I walk into the lavatory to look in the mirror.  "Oh, no!" I 
gasp.  I look at my tie.  "Why can't I ever get the knot right when I 
need to?"  I ask.  I try in vain to think of a way to tie it correctly 
in a short time.  "Why do things like this always happen to me?" I think.
	I slowly walk back to the gate where her flight is to arrive. 
I wonder if she will notice the stupid looking knot in my tie.  It has 
been so long since I've seen her!  
	As I get back to the gate, her plane is pulling in.  Will she 
be one of the first people off?  Will she BE the first?  I can only 
hope.
	The passengers begin to arrive in the gate area.  5 people,      
10 people, 15 people, how big is that plane?  I start getting extremely 
nervous, where is she?  Did something come up?  Is she alright?  Did 
she decide she didn't want to see me?  What was I thinking in inviting 
her out here?  Who did I think I was?  Why would she want to see me?
	Wait a minuite, there she is!  I am impressed!  She looks great! 
She looks just like the goddess I expected her to resemble!  Oh, my 
heart is beating again!  I must be the luckiest man ever to walk the 
face of the earth!
	She walks right up to me.  She wraps her arms around me and 
gives me a long and passionate kiss.  She does remember me!  Now I know 
that my hoping was not for naught!
	We walk down to the baggage claims area and pick up her bags, 
(she packed light, smart girl!) both of them.  I carry her bags out to 
the car for her while we talk of old times and fond memories.  She has 
noticed that I trimmed my beard and moustache for her.  I unlock the 
trunk and carefully put her bags in.  I close the trunk and open up the 
doors.  As we get in, she notices the roses I placed on the passenger 
seat for her.
	We leave the airport and begin the long drive to my place, a 5 
hour drive.  The trip should go pretty quick for her, as she has never 
seen the mountains here.  We will talk and have a picnic lunch on the 
way home.
	As soon as we get home, I will grab my stuff and we will be out 
the door.  We are going camping.  I have already invested in a fishing 
license and a new fishing pole.  I packed everything up yesterday.
	How will I ever live up to her expectations of me?  Where should 
we go?  What fishing tackle should I bring?  Should I kiss her now?  
	A famous person once said, "These are the times that try mens' 
souls".  I now know what he was talking about.  He must have been in 
love.  The confusion, the overwhelming emotions, the chaos!  The funny 
thing is, I wouldn't give it up for the world!

    Well, the media is deeply engrossed in yet another orgy of contemporary  
myth-making. Or unmaking, as the case may be. Unless you've been hiding in a  
cave, you've probably been bombarded by the relentless coverage of the O.J. 
Simpson story: the initial allegations, reportage of the ostensible evidence  
(as it was being discovered), and, of course, the Juice's overdocumented 
flight - his final broken-field rush through the ranks of the media, his
adoring public, and the L.A. police force.

    The dismantling of an American hero lies at the heart of this sad little  
drama: the edifice of celebrity surrounding this rags-to-riches sports figure  
is being torn asunder by the same media which originally constructed it. 
Innocent or guilty, the Juice is squeezed dry - his place in the pantheon 
of American heroes has been erased by the taint of human failing.

    As the gruesome tale of the double-murder unfolded, the media descended 
on the grisly carcass of allegation and innuendo like a flock of vultures, 
intent on presenting the "human interest" with the shining bones of the Juice.  
The bizarre juxtaposition of footage from the funeral with late-breaking 
accounts of newly discovered circumstantial evidence set the stage for an
American update of the ancient "fallen hero" myth.

    Elevated to Olympian heights by the adoration of a nation transfixed by 
sports, many of which resemble the gladiatorial games of ancient Rome, our 
hero is brought down by a blood-lust for retribution; a lust which grotesquely  
demands instant gratification.
    
    Somewhere in the sub-conscious of our nation, we are willing to 
substitute implication and surface appearance for the slow wheels of 
Justice as we have fashioned them. In man-on-the-street interviews aired 
by the networks, individuals gave their verdicts: it was an even split:  
half believe he is guilty based on information presented by the media, 
and half were willing to either suspend judgement until the "facts" are
presented in a court of law, or were unwilling to condemn the hero at all.
Even if Simpson is found innocent by a jury of his peers, the perception of 
guilt among that fifty percent will ensure his fall from grace.
    
    The Juice's six hour flight past the lines of the police and the media  
(*AND the media* stressed in all t.v. accounts) is the most compelling act 
of this drama, so far. The audacity, the boldness, and the confidence Simpson  
displayed in his ill-fated "run from the law" played itself out like a tale 
from Homer - a modern day Odysseus sailing past the siren song of police cars
and screaming fans. Putting a gun to your head may be an unlikely trump card, 
but it proved effective in this case - gambling on the collective guilt of a 
nation can still pay off. Apparently, we're comfortable with taking over the 
grounds of the palace, so long as we don't have to actually pull any triggers
 - at least until we can drum up enough justification.
    
    Watching the coverage of the flight in progress, I couldn't help but feel 
like one of the suitors vying for Penelope's hand in Homer's epic: feasting on 
a memory of glory, gorging on a vicarious indulgence provided at the expense 
of a deposed king. The human fascination with tragedy remains alive and well 
heading into the 21st century; technology brings us hourly updates in techni-
color and stereo (hey, turn that up) and we find ourselves transfixed before 
the spectacle.

    Unfortunately for Simpson, there will be no scene in the hall, no storming 
the castle, no hope of reclaiming his place at the queen's side - she is gone. 
Nicole Simpson cannot wait for his, or anyone else's return. As the real 
victim in this all-to-human drama, she has paid the ultimate price for 
consorting with an American hero.
    
   The manner in which we tell our stories reflects the state of our cultural 
spirit. Focusing a field of lenses, bathing a subject in the glaring reflection
of a forest of lights, we demand the disintegration of the individual soul in 
a nova of invasive inspection. In our mad rush for information, consensus, and 
swift judgement, we sacrifice a measure of our humanity. As we bear witness to 
the continuing stream of media overkill, we must try to preserve our spirit - 
seek a balance between our relentless curiosity and our need to maintain the 
dignity of the individual soul.
    
    Ultimately, the Simpson case may lead the state of California to 
contemplate subjecting our former hero to the death penalty - the final 
chapter, closing the circle. Will the Simpson children understand the verdict? 
Or the tale? I doubt it.

   This MULTI-USER LIST was designed by the staff of ICS to inform you of  
the current status of MUDs, Talk Lines, IRCs, and other interesting multi-user  
internet connections that are brought to our attention.
   If you know of any internet places that should appear on this list, or
should be removed from this list, please send updated information to:
                          
                    ORG_ZINE@WSC.COLORADO.EDU
                          
   This list will always be limited to a few entries per issue. ICS will 
never list a place more than once unless a change in status needs to be
relayed to our readers.  You may want to read back issues to see what
sites have been mentioned in the past. The first issue to contain this
list is volume one, issue ten.

   Summer Snow. The cottonwood trees are in full, righteous bloom today,  
and the sunny rural village of Gunnison resembles the site of the world's 
largest pillow fight. So I'm in a goofy mood today ... 
   
   Life in a Dandelion Blossom aside, this frag winds up Volume 1 of ICS.      
With the changing of the seasons, a few members of our staff are leaving  
for a while - they all promise to e-mail and stay in contact, but still,  
it just won't be the same. Deva, our founding father here at ICS, is moving  
on to bigger places and opportunities. Occasionally, he'll drop in, zealously  
check our ideas against the facts, and bail us out on programming problems 
(uhm, where is that file, Deva?). 
   
   Meanwhile, I will be on a recruiting drive to harness more of the     
creative energy around here for everyone's amusement and amazement. 
Over the next couple months, we'll send out 3 or 4 more frags, and, 
as always, submissions are welcome. We're especially interested in your 
multi-user addresses and experiences, and, well, just about anything else 
you'd like to send along. Live Well, SP.

	ICS would like to hear from you.  We accept flames, comments, 
      submissions, editorials, corrections, and just about anything else  
      you wish to send us. For your safety, use these guidelines when    
      sending us anything.  We will use things sent to us when we think  
      they would be appropriate for the issue coming out. So, if you send  
      us something that you DO NOT want us to use in the electrozine,    
      then put the words NOT FOR PUBLICATION in the subject of the mail  
      you send. You can protect your material by sending a copy to your-
