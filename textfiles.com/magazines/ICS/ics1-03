     It is amazing how one person can so quickly ruin a piece of 
quality work.  A local BBS that I frequent is intended for constructive  
discussion of contemporary subject matter;  however, one subscriber  
has taken it upon himself to undermine the purpose of this conference site.   
The current state of affairs has become reminicent of a crusade where  
nobody fights.  Most of the regular contributors have vanished while  
only a few of the hardier type have remained to endure the constant  
tirade of meaningless junk that pours from the keyboard of our nameless
molester. 
     The paralyzing blow that this individual has released on those of us
who remain turns us into incapable, reactive, cyber-morons. 
All attempts to remove this person's access to the BBS have failed  
since he has not really broken any rules.  I find myself sliding up   
to the person sitting at the next work station asking, "Have you read  
my latest post about Him?"  What once was a healthy intellectual past-time  
has become something of a competitive obsession. I sit in my apartment  
at night and mull over tactical advances I might issue the next 
day, but what I as well as my fellow patriots of the Public Forum 
have accomplished in the end is equal to the sum of our nameless
assailant's contributions.  We have become essentially as destructive  
to the ultimate goal of the BBS as our enemy. 
     This phenomenon seems to occur on just about every BBS I can dig  
up, and I am convinced that some very rude person is following me around  
changing his address and alias every time someone has something meaningful  
to relay.  My personal experience seems to be becoming a rule rather than  
a solitary occurrence.  "Why?" I ask myself while raising my hands to the  
cyber-sky in a quasi-sarcastic manner, hoping for god-like intervention.   
The point of most BBSes and Public-Dial-Up sites, in my humble opinion,  
is to facilitate constructive and insightful discussion on an infinite  
variety of subjects -- why does the common "flame" and its brothers even  
exist?  Our subculture seems to be preoccupied with the art of bickering. 
Stop!  Our world, our lives don't need this nonsense.

           \___________________________________________________/

  Due to some difficulties experienced in the 'zine's "subscription
drive," as well as other questions that have been raised concerning
institutional liability, appropriateness of this and that, and other
such issues, I have been doing some research into the "law of the
cyberland."  

  That I have not found much probably comes as no surprise to many of
our readers.  The November/December '92 issue of TECHNOLOGY REVIEW had
a good essay on the evolution of standards for electronic publishing
("Of Bytes and Rights," by Herb Brody);  according to the author,
everything from network standards to Constitutional Amendments has been
proposed, but nothing has been universally adopted;  and the usual
continuum of positions ranging from ultimate control to ultimate
liberty is taking shape.  In this regard, we would appreciate a copy
of any network codes of ethics, proposed electronic legislation, or
other efforts to push the law into these new realms;  and we would also
encourage the submission to this 'zine of essays suggesting what kind
and degree of legal controls should be overlaid on the medium.

  This research, however, gave rise to larger thoughts that really need
to be addressed before proposing legislation, and these thoughts have
to do with what I think of as the "basic analogy" of "paperless
publishing" in general and this 'zine in particular.  More simply: 
what are we "like"?  Or what are we trying to create?  Brody's essay
suggests a lot of possibilities.  From the "global bulletin board," he
moves on to the electronic neighborhood, the electronic village, the
"electronic watering hole," the library, the bookstore, as possible
metaphors for "what we are like."  

  One of the most interesting observations I've encountered on the "lay
of the land" in cyberspace, however, was in the second issue of the
Electrozine:  Benjamin Price's "Final Opinion."  Price says, "A
computer screen and a connection to the world become the greatest
equalizing force I have ever known.  Once you sit down and enter
Cyberspace, there are no longer any judgments.  There is no race, no
creed, no gender. . . . You are defined simply by how much you know
and how you choose to use that knowledge."  

  A skeptic might point out that a "literacy requirement" makes "some
animals more equal than others" in Cyberspace--but in a way, that is
one of the things that I like most about the medium.  The need to put
everything in text files makes electronic publishing--at this point,
at least--the most totally literate medium we have:  no pictures, no
infographics, not even any italics--none of the things paper publishers
have come up with to make the printed word more palatable to a larger
(and increasingly less literate) audience.  

  When I asked a class of "Sci/Tech in Culture" students to evaluate
the Electrozine concept, most of the students saw this lack of graphics
as a major strike against the idea, and stopped there. 

  One student, however, thought that through such media "we might
develop our writing to the extent that we return to using our
imaginations."  While I haven't asked her, I would guess that this
student might have had little or no access to television in her young
years, because what she said reminded me immediately of something my
son had said, years ago at about the age of six, before he was
"captured" by the visual culture (which was not present in our home). 
He had gone to a friend's house to watch a televised version of C.S.
Lewis's "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"--a book that we had
already read aloud.  When he got home, and I asked him how he'd liked
it, he was quiet for a minute, then said, "It's better when you make
your own pictures."  

  In a new book, TECHNOPOLY, educator and cultural critic Neil Postman
describes a "war for the future of education" currently in process
between a "knowledge monopoly" based on the printed word and the
emerging knowledge monopoly based in visual/interactive media.  He
derides the notion that the print-based knowledge monopoly, still in
control of the classroom but on the run everywhere else, can "contain"
the visual media by declaring television to be "okay for some things but
not for others";  this, says Postman, is like the medieval church or
some other institution grounded in the oral tradition telling Gutenberg
that books were okay for stories and essays but not for religious and
inspirational works.  

  I would be more sanguine about this "war for the future of
education," had I not spent most of the past decade in the classroom
with students who are, in effect, the first generation of "displaced
persons" created by that war:  young people primarily educated by the
visual media which have been so uncritically embraced by the culture,
but still "doing time" in the classrooms which are the last holdout of
the old knowledge monopoly.  For the most part, these are people
without imagination:  so overloaded with images created by others
(expertly, with virtually unlimited resources) that they have no room
for--or respect for--their own incipient halting efforts.  

  The nature and outcome of this war is made even more disturbing when
one reads Jerry Mander's new book, IN THE ABSENCE OF THE SACRED, in
which he points out that "about 75% of commercial network television
time is paid for by the 100 largest corporations in the country," which
"leads to certain kinds of information dominating the airwaves."  The
same figures probably apply to the visually-oriented popular magazines
that most of my students love and consider to be a literate medium. 
All of these advertisers, says Mander, essentially have the same
message:  "Whether you buy this commodity or that one, satisfaction in
life comes from commodities."  The spiritual and imaginative writers
on the human experience have never managed to come up with such a
simple and consensual message/massage.

  I will close by relating of one of my own skirmishes in this war for
the future of education.  Here at Western State College, we have been
trying hard to develop a set of coordinated "core" courses focusing on
the development of both creative and critical thinking skills--in
essence, how to effectively ask "why" about what is, and "why not"
about what is not.  Like everyone else in public education, we are
"bootstrapping on a shoestring":  broadly defining the investment to
encompass the whole reorientation and diversion of resources including
faculty, development of the program has probably cost $10 million over
the past half decade.

  Meanwhile, however, Anheuser-Busch has invested $70 million in
inundating our students (and everyone else) with its "Why ask why?"
campaign--the very antithesis of critical and creative thinking.  I've
stopped buying Budweiser as a result--that would be like G.I. Joe
buying German war bonds in 1943.  But given the resources the visual
media can muster, compared to what print-based public education can
muster--should I be such a fool as to be optimistic about the outcome?

  Only, I guess, so long there are students with enough of a vestigial
imagination to imagine an appropriate environment for its full
development, or students like Ben Price and the rest of this 'zine
staff looking for themselves in front of a screen that stays blank
until they put something of themselves there--in an environment that
requires their receivers to flex their own imaginations enough to "make
the pictures."

  No doubt many well meaning technicians are hard at work on making
visual information easily accessible in a text-file format;  but I
won't buy into it, and I would encourage others to "think large" about
it.  My own emerging "basic analogy" for this medium is more that of
"the great unexplored continent," a place in which I keep meeting
people I already know who, here, are not quite the same old people. 
Knowing of course that it probably can't, I nevertheless wish that this
abstract unexplored continent would stay this way:  a place for the
word and its pictures, and those humans willing and able to imagine,
to make their own pictures.

                 /___________________________________\   
 
     This issue's WorldNet Tour Guide is on the topic of ARCHIE. 
 ARCHIE is a program that will search many sites very rapidly and return 
information on the location of files you are seeking.  It is an incredible 
time saver. 
 
     ARCHIE sites should be connected to using the TELNET command.   
This command is what we use on our VAX/VMS machine here and is common on 
most platforms.  The command you use may be different; unfortunately  
it is not available to BITNET users. 
 
TELNET EXAMPLE: 
TELNET <address of computer> 
TELNET ARCHIE.ANS.NET 
 
     Once connected to a computer hosting an ARCHIE program, you will 
be prompted to login.  The LOGIN is usually `archie.'  There is no  
password required.  Once connected you can use the ARCHIE program to  
help you find files.  Four commands will be described in this Tour  
Guide.  They are all you need to get started. 
     You the reader should be informed now that the ARCHIE sites 
request that your site install a CLIENT program that enables you to use 
ARCHIE without TELNETTING to their site.  The information on where to 
obtain the client software will be displayed on some sites upon connecting.
This software can be obtained using FTP(see ICS Volume 1 Issue 2). 
 
     The four commands that will be discussed here are HELP, SET SEARCH, 
PROG, and MAIL.  These commands should be sufficient to get you started 
with ARCHIE. 
 
HELP 
The HELP command tells the ARCHIE program to display a list of  
commands.  These are commands that you can use from ARCHIE.  Most of 
these commands you will not need.  The commands needed to get started are
in this WorldNet Tour Guide article. 
The HELP command will enable you to request more help by typing
HELP <topic>. 
 
SET SEARCH <mode> 
This allows you to set how detailed a search you wish to use. Some 
archie sites are set to search mode SUB and occasionally they are
set to EXACT.  The difference is that SUB takes longer and will return 
every occurence of the word you are searching for, but EXACT will only 
return occurences that are exactly what you typed in.  It is very fast. 
These modes and others will be discussed in more detail here. 

MODE--What it means: 
---------------------- 
SUB     This mode sets the ARCHIE program to a case insensitive(does 
        not matter whether caps is on or off) substring search. It 
        will set the mode to search for any occurence of that pattern. 
SUBCASE This is the same as SUB, however it IS Case sensitive. 
EXACT   This mode means that it should report any EXACT occurence of 
        what you type in and nothing more.  This is the fastest search 
        method, but it requires that you know exactly what you are looking 
        for. 
REGEX   This is the DEFAULT setting of most ARCHIE sites(ARCHIE.ANS.NET 
        is defaulted to EXACT mode).  This allows searches to be made 
        for regular expressions.  There is a lot of information available 
        concerning this search mode.  To obtain it, just type HELP SET SEARCH 
        at the ARCHIE prompt.  More information can be obtained by typing 
        HELP PROG REGEX at the ARCHIE prompt. 
 
PROG <expression> 
This ARCHIE command tells it to go into the database and search for occurences 
of the expression based on whatever the current search mode is set to.  It 
will keep you informed of progress as it goes.  When it is done, it will
display the results to the screen.  You can have the results mailed to you
using the MAIL command that is described next. 
 
MAIL <email address> 
This tells the ARCHIE program to send the results of the search to the EMAIL 
address that you indicate.  Large amounts of information will be fragmented 
into several pieces of mail. 
 
                               ARCHIE SITES:

[]        How to finger and to create a plan for your Vax account.         []

      Why would one want to? If you ever wondered if a friend was on-line

      could finger their account. One way to do so would be to type FINGER 
      @SITEADDRESSHERE, an example on how you would do so to WSC:
      Finger @WSC.COLORADO.EDU / this would show you everyone who is
      currently on the WSC system, and ours also shows personal names, 
      system status, et cetera. By scanning this list you would be 
      able to see if that special someone was on-line.
           One can check to see if selected individuals 
      are on. Say you wanted to know if I was logged-on during a 
      certain part of the day then you would type the
      following <Finger stu445666405@wsc.colorado.edu>.  This would show 
      you if I was currently on the system along with my current system 
      status.  You may encounter a person who has created a little 
      addition to their account.  When a person fingers this type of account
      they encounter a PLAN file that the user designs. Try the 
      Electrozine account at <ORG_ZINE@WSC.COLORADO.EDU>.       
           What is going on when you encounter something like:
     
      stu445666405         204243405  *DCL*          .LT4354SRV13/PORT_2
      [No Plan]
     
      The stu445666405 is the person or site you fingered. 
      The 204243405 is the process ID.  The *DCL* is what that person is 
      currently doing.  This may say "not logged on."  The 
      ".LT435SRV13/PORT_2" is the present local terminal
      location. The [No Plan] is stating that this person has no plan. 
           What is a plan? A Plan is an attached graphic or some text 
      that you can add to your account that comes up when fingered.
      On the VAX/VMS environment you need to do the following
      to create a plan file.  Enter to your DCL prompt and edit in an 
      ASCII format. Type edt plan.txt at this point you should be in a
      edit buffer.  Command files are not necessary -- at this point 
      what ever you type will show up.  So type in your name and email,
      then write I READ ICS, YOU SHOULD TOO!  Exit and save it. 
      The protection on your plan.txt should be set so that it is like 
      this: (W:r) plan.txt; the World should be able to read it.
           Try to finger your own account.  Also try to finger your 
      account from a different account (like a friends) to make sure 
      it works.  You now have a plan. make it look neat and descriptive.

 (_)he sky was dark and a blanket of moisture was all around.  The sound
of divots in the road were droning background sounds to the intoxicated 
youths in the back seat of the Pontiac Firebird.  The party they had just
come from had supplied three passengers with more than ample alcoholic
beverages.  It was times like this that they were thankful for sober 
people to drive them home.
	The snow had all melted and spring had come and brought the 
green back into the trees on the side of the road.  The trees could be
seen for a long way on this very straight road.  This was not an 
unfamiliar road to the driver.  Actually this was the road the driver had
to drive every night to get to his house.  The driver turned up the 
stereo as the quiet music reached a song he particularly enjoyed.
	The heavy metal and stuporous state did not stop one of the 
passengers from commenting on the mist that was quickly thickening around
the road.  Notice they did, and of course some drunken comment was made that
the other passengers felt was amusing.
	There were no visible lights of cars in either direction and as 
near as the passengers and drivers were could tell it was near midnight.  
The absence of other car lights and the mist made this a particularly 
dark stretch of road.
	Suddenly, not far ahead, the occupants of the car noticed a white
figure on the side of the road with an arm extended and thumb pointing
upwards.  The car was closing the gap to the figure fairly rapidly.  The
occupants of the car looked on with curiosity which gradually shifted to
fear and concern.  This was a lady dressed in white and she appeared to
be leaning outwards into the road at a near 45 degree angle.
	The passengers quickly noted that this was not a natural angle
for a human to stand at.  The driver turned the wheel and entered the
other lane of the road.  As they past the figure they saw it vanish.
	The next few years the passengers would relate this tale to anyone
interested in this tale.  After all, it wasn't the first report of ghostly
hitchhikers.

	Frank climbed to the top of the ladder and stepped onto one wing
of his delta shaped fighter.  He began to cross over to the cockpit, the 
material of his pilot suit making an annoying, abrasive sound as the legs
rubbed together.  Frank clambered into the war machine and tried to think about 
anything to keep his mind off the upcoming battle.  The canopy began to seal 
with a hiss that reminded him of the videos of snakes that he had seen when 
he was a boy.  Frank wondered if he would ever see a snake in real life. 
	'Maybe when this war between Earth and the Mars colonies ends
I could go and visit Earth.  Of course, since the gravity of Earth is
so much stronger than that of Mars, I'll feel like a weak child,' Frank
thought.  'And I can't afford it, unless Mars wins this war.  It's
funny to see how history repeats it's self.  America broke away from
Britain because of extreme taxation and political manipulation, yet the
Earth didn't learn from this example and is mishandling the Mars in the
same fashion---'
	The voice of his flight leader snapped Frank out of his reflective
mood.  "SMITH!  Wake up and sound off if you're there."  
	Frank winced at the flight leaders sarcastic tone.  "Sorry, Sir!"
	"Better.  Now listen up boys and girls, the assault force is 
going to be dropping out of lightspeed in forty seconds.  Begin warming
up engines, lasers, and particle cannons."
	Following instructions, Frank activated all systems.  The weapons
display screen showed that both lasers in each wing were ready, also the
particle cannon was charging and the missile pod was loaded with six 
separate 'flights' of ten missiles per 'flight.'  Frank placed his helmet
on his head, feeling comforted by the sound of the weapon capacitors charging,
but his entire body was coated in sweat that heightened the discomfort of 
his flight suit.
	Even in training flights, Frank always broke into a cold sweat and life 
seemed like an event that was happening to someone else, but that changed 
when the action started.  Frank was the best combat pilot in the Martian 
fleet, and he tried to use this knowledge to calm his nerves as best as 
he could.  He also reminded himself that surprise had been achieved even 
though Earth had known, two hours ago, that the attack was on its way.
The attack became obvious when the missiles launched from Martian 
surveilance ships destroyed the defense satellites of Earth and the moon.
	Frank ANGEL fighter, and those of 17 other pilots, were riding
aboard a battlecruiser named the "Vengeance".  The thick, titanium-shelled
battlecruiser had been mined from the astroid belt, assembled in Earth 
orbit and given to Mars to protect it from raids by other inhabited 
solar systems.  The Vengeance was a massive hulk measuring about half
a mile in length and would weigh over 800,000 tons in atmosphere.  Now
this goliath of battle, and 21 other ships, were turning their weapons
on the planet and factories that had built them.
	The weapons that would spell Earths defeat had been designed
and redesigned over the past 500 years and were the cutting edge of
technology, deuterium fluoride chemical lasers which created lethal, 15
megawatt beams of infra-red light, invisible to the human eye.  Hyper-velocity
missiles that could lock-on to targets 2,000 miles away, reaching them
in 30 seconds and causing devastating damage.  Coilguns that fired 
500 pound to 2 ton explosive shells down launch tubes that reached lengths
of up to half-a-mile.  And particle cannons that fired 20-45 megawatt 
streams of neutral particles, destroying the molecular bonds of the 
target area and causing almost instant vaporization.
	The voice of the flight leader invaded the cockpit of Franks 
ANGEL, "O.K., the game plan is to concentrate firepower on the two 
battlecruisers first, then the destroyers.  Light deceleration will 
commence in 5 seconds."
	Frank felt a sudden dizzying sensation as the Vengeance dropped 
into attack speed.  Vibrations, from fighters launching on the upper 
flight decks, lightly shook his ANGEL fighter.  Then, with the muffled 
whirring of gears, the platform elevator that was holding his ANGEL 
rose upward to the flight deck.  Frank closed his eyes and took several 
deep breaths.  When the elevator stopped he opened his eyes and stared 
calmly at the flight deck doors.  Then all sound outside the fighter 
stopped when the doors snapped open and the surrounding air rushed out 
into the void of space.  The only sounds left were those of Franks 
breathing and the comlink.
	With a sudden kick Frank was pushed heavily back into his 
control seat.  The delta-shaped ANGEL fighter leapt from the left side of 
the Vengeance and followed the bright lights of another ANGEL's drive 
engines.  Frank eased his fighter above the Vengeance accelerating 
over and past huge spheres of the four launching trooplanders, attached 
to the Vengeance like massive ticks.  Each one of the trooplanders was 
approximately 200 feet in diameter and carried 400 Martian marines.
The laser lights from the Heads Up Display, originating from the top of 
Franks helmet, quickly highlighted all possible targets, making them 
stand out against the star filled backdrop of the battlespace.  The 
H.U.D. listed the distance to Earth at around 500 miles and the fleet 
was closing at almost 200 miles per minute.
	All of the larger war-ships had the same basic shape, long 
cylinders with protruding weapon pods, sensor arrays, maneuvering 
thrusters, and so forth.  The only major exceptions being the, 800 foot 
long 12,000 ton fighter carriers.  The back halves of these ships are huge 
delta-shaped wings that are actually fighter launch tubes.  Frank could see 
many other ANGEL fighters, each easily spotable because of the twin sparks of 
light coming from the engines of each fighter.  The fighters the Earth 
Defense Fleet used were called BATs and looked like a single straight 
wing with a reflective plastic composite cockpit in the middle.  The 
BATs had much lighter weaponry, consisting of one particle cannon and  
two missile racks similar to the ANGELs on either side of it's cockpit.
But the BAT fighters have three drive engines each and can out maneuver 
the ANGEL fighters.  
	As Frank accelerated past the bow of the Vengeance, he gained a 
complete view of the battlespace.  The Martian flag/battleship was 
turning its massive 4,000 foot, 1,500,000 ton bulk towards the 
earth-orbit space station. It was followed by two frigates and two 
heavy cruisers, each massing around 745,000 tons and measuring over 2,300 
feet in length, the cruisers being slower but carrying more weapons.  
Eighty ANGELs sped ahead of the battleship and its escorts to engage the 
enemy fighters while twenty fighters remained behind for fighter defense.  
The space station, called "Garden," looked like a titanic mushroom with a two 
mile long 'stem' and a three mile diameter 'cap.'  Garden was also surrounded 
by two, 3,000 foot, 600,000 ton destroyers, a dozen trooplanders, and almost 
50 fighters.
	Two fighter carriers began to accelerate towards Earth, followed  
by four corvettes and the longest ship in the Martian fleet, a 
troopcarrier.  The 400,000 ton, 1,300 foot corvettes were straining 
their engines to try to catch up with the carriers and the 5,000 foot 
1,500,000 ton troopcarrier was quickly out-distanced by the other ships.
But this goliath made up for its slowness with its ability to carry 
twenty-five trooplanders alone.  Together with the thirty-four other 
trooplanders from the rest of the fleet and 146 ANGELs this part of the 
fleet vectored towards the planet, which had three frigates, about 
eighty BAT fighters and 30 trooplanders guarding it.  
	The rest of the Martian fleet headed for the main Earth Defense 
Fleet that was halfway between Garden and Earth.  The last fighter 
carrier lead the charge followed closely by two corvettes.  These, in 
turn, were followed by two more frigates and the Vengeance.  Lastly were 
four older-version battlecruisers.  Weighing 850,000 tons and measuring 
nearly 4,700 feet, these  ships were slower and carried less armor than 
the newer battlecruisers like the Vengeance.  Together with 106 fighters,
one of which was Frank, this group was to seal the fate of the rest of 
the Earth Defense Fleet.  The EDF consisted of four destroyers, three 
corvettes, nearly seventy fighters, and the primary target for Frank and 
the Vengeance, two of the newest heavy cruisers.  Measuring at around 
2,700 feet and weighing 740,000 tons, these heavy cruisers carried 
nearly twice the weapons and armor of the Martian heavy cruisers.
	Pushing their fighters to maximum acceleration, the Martian 
pilots raced ahead of their fleet and began breaking into pairs.  One 
fighter in each pair had a hyper-velocity missile from one of the 
warships jury-rigged to the bottom of the fighter.  A missile as long as 
the fighter its self.  Franks fighter was one of these missile carriers.
Franks wingman pulled in above and behind him.
	"Good mornin' Frank, how's the wife?" the wingman 
asked.
	"Rosie is just fine, Rick, how are you?"
	"Never better...Man, there sure are lots of badguys today.  It 
looks kind-of vicious out there."
	"Hey, just remember, we're not surrounded, we're in a target 
rich environment."
	"Right.  Good luck at the office today, Bawanna."
	"You too."
	Even as the fighters passed the halfway point to the enemy, 
brilliant lights began to flash all over the EDF, caused by the 
invisible lasers and particle beams of the Martian warships.  Then the 
blur of coilgun rounds and the streaks of light from the hyper-velocity 
missiles rocketed past, erupting into orange-white explosions whenever 
they hit.
	Three fourths of the way to the EDF the Martian ANGELs 
encountered the Earth fighter defense.  (TO BE CONTINUED)

VIII        _______________X____BY FRED SKANES____X_____________ 
 
 
Laying the slice of olive and pimento on the nacho shivered up a memory.  
These often came when Michael was unprepared, or at least unsuspecting. He  
would be involved in a simple task, something routine and everyday, when a  
quick flood of remembrance would bolt him back to another time. Back to  
himself, back to her. His present thoughts were glazed over. Disoriented,  
Michael sat down by the stove. The chair wobbled underneath.  
Michael took a long draw on his smoke. He watched the cool blue smoke  
wither in the air. His gaze drifted over to the pan of nachos. He noticed  
that only half of the chips were streaked with the red and yellow pieces of  
hot banana peppers. She never liked them. Old habits die hard. Michael  
chuckled silently. The pepperless side was smothered in Cheddar and Jack.  
That's all she liked. He thought, she isn't here really, but she is. 
 
Nearly a year had passed. Michael pushed ahead, trying to start fresh. He  
would seek comfort from his friends but that was sporadic at best. They had  
their own lives and now he was the odd man out. They were all `coupled off'. 
 
On occasion they would all sit around and relate their stories about the  
everyday things that made up their lives -- dirty diapers, work, rows and  
booze. A diverse hodgepodge  of matter of fact discussions. One day, tired  
of Michael's usual referrals, his friends, with exasperated tones, echoed  
each other. 
 
-- Mike it's been a long time -- 
-- Get on with your life -- 
-- Mike, for jesus sake, let it go will ya -- 
 
Whether they were talking about food, money, sex or the problems of the  
planet, Michael always pluralized his viewpoint. 
 
-- Yeah, _____ and I never liked that much -- 
-- No, we thought that was unnecessary -- 
-- The Continental was our favorite -- 
 
Often Michael thought that their remarks were selfish and insensitive. He  
was getting on with his life but in his own way, not theirs. He sprinkled  
some red pepper on the nachos. 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________ 
In the car his frozen toes made the day constant. It was a cold winter thus  
far. As they moved along the brackish road, the hardened wheel well slush  
continuously rubbed the tires. They pulled into a flower shop to collect a  
friend. 
 
Stirring from a daydream, ignoring the frosty chat, Michael begrudgingly  
squeezed from the back seat. As he entered the earthy warmth of the shop  
his thoughts quickly moved to memory. The last time in this place was with  
her. Ferns, that was their goal on a Sunday. 
 
Trying to ride the crest of this emotional wave Michael clung to his  
friends. He followed them around the store. He somehow felt that by keeping  
close to them he would be secured from his past. Companionable shelter in  
a tormenting emotional storm? Louisiana Hot Sauce dribbles over the pepper  
and cheese. 

_______________________________________________________________________________ 
Thinking back, a bit brave for the task, Michael often felt that the `break  
up' period was not really a breaking up of anything. Easily categorized, he  
thought, to neatly file away the pain and confusion. A quick way out for some. 
 
She left, he stayed. Michael lived in the same place. He dealt with sleeping
in `their bed', alone. Rolling over, and over to the other edge.  
He picked up her mail, answered her calls, cleared away her things. He  
wasn't `breaking up' anything. Yet. His contacts with her were still around  
him, a part of his daily life.  
The more someone tried to figure out why someone was leaving them, the more  
confusing it all seemed. When Michael focused on her departure, the brief  
note that summarized a relationship, he conjured up a smattering of  
theories as to why? 
 
Michael butted the smoke in the popcan ashtray. He thought of the letters.  
Jesus, how many did he write? It all happened so fast. He remembered trying  
to balance the speed of her departure with introspection. He penned body  
and soul in at least fifteen letters in the first three weeks! 
 
Each letter attempting to explain in some way the chaos of thought and  
emotion. Each one a new stab at trying to let her know how he felt. Each  
time, Michael was never sure of the end result but they went in the post  
just the same. Michael thought that somehow through all the fragments she  
could see how strong his love was for her. 
 
No matter what flowed into each letter Michael never crumpled one for the  
trash can. He mailed them all thinking that this diligence and honesty  
would strengthen his position. He sent her all of his feelings whatever  
they were at the time of writing. These letters became hurried glimpses of  
truth. The pre-heating light went out. Michael slid the Nachos into the hot  
oven. 
  
_____________________________________________________________________________ 
His beard is full now except for two vee shaped spots hanging off his lower  
lip. All in all a shaggy reminder of her. She hated the coarse rub of his  
face. Growing the beard somehow signalled a change. He checked to make sure  
the nachos were not burning. 
  
______________________________________________________________________________ 
They both lived in the same neighbourhood now. Their paths never crossed. A  
chance encounter seemed likely but never materialized. Michael could  
somehow relate this to their separate lives but he still found it funny  
that in such a small community there never was a run in of any sort. Their  
crowd watered at the same hole and yet on many anxious occasions as he  
pulled open the local bar door, she was never there. It was as if she somehow  
knew the nights that Michael would decide to spend those last few UI dollars  
out and about. 
 
Her friends would be there many nights. They were `her' friends now; before  
they had been mutual friends, but owing up to past alliances from before they  
became a `couple', friends now camped with old allegiance. 
 
One day while clearing the cobwebs with coffee at a new cafe, Michael  
sighted her across the street. She was attending a community college nearby.
An anxious moment nearly knocked the coffee and cream mugs off of the  
uneven table as Michael crazily thought of scrambling to the door and  
shouting out her name. Gathering himself he sat back down to agonize once  
more. 
 
From that day on, the cafe at the top of the hill became a symbol of  
Michael's torturous days. In the days of unemployment, time leads to many  
thoughts. On many occasions, even though the relationship had been long  
snuffed, Michael would daydream himself to the door of the cafe.
It became a focal point, almost a refuge of sorts.  
 
Confused, he often left without even looking in through the window. Love  
and anger mixed together, fueling moments of panic and indecision. The  
next hour or so left him emotionally paralyzed. His concentration became a  
struggle. Any conversation with friends that he would bump into would wane;  
Michael would curtly drift away. 
 
Finally, one day, Michael and a friend, Jamie, decided to go for coffee. It  
was no surprise to Michael when he suggested the cafe at the top of the  
hill. As they entered the smokey lunch time crowd and situated a table,  
Michael's stomach tied itself tightly. There she sat. With Jamie in the  
lead, feeling blind and crippled, Michael grappled to a corner table.  
MIchael felt that he could touch her by simply thinking about it.

Jamie continued the conversation from the car. Michael faintly nodded  
concern; income tax and the cost of living could take a back seat for the  
moment. The reach of his hearing centred on her table.  
 
Michael picked up his coffee and for a moment the movement disentangled him  
from Jamie's words. He tried to quickly snatch her voice, wanting to know  
what she has been up to. A moment summarizes months of living, Michael  
thought. 
 
There would be no acknowledgment that day. They would both have lunch,  
talk to friends, and go on to the afternoon. Such days were random. Michael  
went to the cafe sporadically after that first encounter. He thought that  
maybe this was a sign of something. A change occurring in his outlook on  
the past. 
 
Getting up from the chair, he shrugged off the daydream. The oven had  
filled the kitchen with sleepy heat. Michael opened the oven door to check  
on the nachos. They were almost ready, the cheese beginning to bubble.     
 
_____________________________________________________________________________ 
It gave way one day. That day. Funny thing was, Michael had thought of this  
exact moment. He conjured up daydreams while on the bus of such symbolic  
events. He took it as a sign to let go. Finally. 
 
Michael so often imagined this day. He felt glad that the earthy colored  
`weavy', as she called it, had fallen off unnoticed. It had dangled on  
his wrist for a year or thereabout. A constant reminder. 
 
Michael knew that to prepare for this moment would have been a troublesome  
gesture. A parting glance back, somehow ceremonialized, would have  
undoubtedly yielded substantial flashbacks. A jaunt to the liquor store for  
two litres of Bull's Blood would have been in order. 
 
He was glad that it remained. Like the two he angrily cut from his wrist  
when she first left, this one would hang around as well. He stuck it in the  
fold of the cookbook that lay open on the table. Holding a place of  
reference, keeping a memory. Michael pulled the finished nachos from the  
oven.

  On March 1, 1990 Steve Jackson found out his company was on the list  
of places to raid during Operation Sun Devil. The secret service paid  
SJ Games a visit. The SS broke into locked file cabinets, ransacked the place,  
and left carrying 3 computers, 2 laser printers, and a lot of hard disks  
and papers.  Later, a posting on the BBS run by SJ Games, used to keep up  
communications with role players, related the following: 

  "So far we have not received a clear explanation of what the secret  
service was looking for, what they expected to find, or much of anything  
else.  We are fairly certain that Steve Jackson Games is not the target  
of whatever investigation is being conducted; in any case, we have done  
nothing illegal and have nothing whatsoever to hide. However, the 
equipment that was seized is apparently considered to be evidence in  
whatever they're investigating, so we aren't likely to get it back any  
time soon. It could be a month, it could be never." 
 
  Later in another game, Steve Jackson said: 
 "In 1990, Steve Jackson Games was raided by the U.S. Secret Service during
a 'hacker hunt' that went disastrously out of control.  We lost several 
computers, modems, and other equipment.  Worse, we lost the manuscripts to 
several uncompleted games, most notably _GURPS Cyberpunk_, which a Secret 
Service agent the next day called `a handbook for computer crime.'  The
company had to lay off half its staff, and narrowly avoided bankruptcy. 
 
 "Eventually we got most of our property back (though some of it was damaged
or destroyed).  The Secret Service admitted that we'd never been a target of
their investigation.  We have a lawsuit pending against the officials and
agencies responsible." 
 
  One reason the secret service raided SJ Games is because of one of the  
staff writers, known as The Mentor of the LoD (Legion of Doom). The  
LoD is a band of hackers, and all hackers are evil in the eye of the  
law. The book, `GURPS-Cyberpunk, High-Tech Low-Life Role-Playing,' is  
now advertised as "The book that was seized by the secret service".  
 
  If you are interested, SJ Games operates a BBS with discussion areas  
for several games, including GURPS. Its up 24 hours a day at 521-447-4449,  
at 300, 1200, or 2400 baud. 
 
  Now with the help of the EFFector 'zine, SJ Games has won its
law suit.

Yep, we won. By all means, print info - that's why we sent out the 
press release! Thanks for the interest. Best of luck to you; electrozines 
are a wave of the future.

We won. 
Pete Kennedy, our attorney at George, Donaldson & Ford, called me
with the news about 3:30 today. Apparently the decision came in late 
Friday while Pete was at the CFP. The judge ruled for us on both the PPA  
and ECPA, though he says that taking the computer out the door was not an  
"interception." (I have not read the decision yet, so no quotes here.) 
He awarded damages of $1,000 per plaintiff under the ECPA. Under the PPA,  
he awarded SJ Games $42,259 for lost profits in 1990, and out of pocket  
costs of $8,781. Our attorneys are also entitled to submit a request for  
their costs. No word on appeal yet. 
  
Look for a more complete and coherent account after we all read 
the decision. Please copy this announcement to all electronic and 

other media. Thanks for your support through all this!

Secrest Elementary School	6875 W. 64th Avenue
Arvada, CO 80003		USA
Mar.12, 1993		

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

For those who have missed previous notices about "Project: Indiana Jones and the
Power of the Internet" I would like to take a minute or two to update you.

My name is Sam F. Radovich, 6th grade teacher here at Secrest.  I've been
teaching 19 years in Jefferson County, the largest school district in the State
of Colorado.  I've been at Secrest for 5 years.

I'm not a computer scientist or programmer, just a creative, innovative
classroom educator who is trying to implement the use of technology to enhance
and enrich  basic education.

This all started several years ago when I wrote a "Long Distance Learning
Proposal" that was rejected.  A second one that was networking two of our sister
elementary schools, which was also rejected so the local high school could pay
for a cd-rom program instead of the "Power of the Net."

Thanks to Mr. Ken Harmon, Executive Director of Colorado SuperNet, this dream is
becoming a reality on a daily basis.  He adopted us and has provided us with the
access to the Net.  This "Educational Partnership" has provided unlimited
learning opportunities.

I'm trying to educate and convince the public of the importance of technology
for accessing the world classroom that we all know exits via the Net.  Many feel
this is not important in elementary school. We just had a super demonstration
with "Educating a Superintendent."

We had responses from around Colorado and the Nation, also from Australia, New
Zealand, and yes even from South Africa.


Sincerely
Sam F. Radovich
(aka Dr. Jones or Indy and Associates)
P.S.  We've just made it into the South Pole and Iceland, too.

{That's great to hear. Schools should definitely be using the incredible 
  resources out there as much as they can; it is good to know that there 
  are teachers out there making an effort to make it happen. -BP}

Hello all,

      I have to make a confession.  I did something appalling and I can't
keep it bottled up anymore.  It really is terrible, but here goes.

      When I received the first edition of your electrozine, I was very busy
and didn't really have time to read it, so I ... PRINTED IT!  Can you believe
I would do such a thing to an electronic magazine.  Whew,  I feel so much
better now that I got that off my chest.

      Congratulations, it was an excellent edition and I wish you all the
best of luck.

  was utterly unforgivable, and it breaks my heart to hear about a true

  thanks. -BP}

   Hmmm. The lab is fairly quiet at last. Most of the research paper  
strugglers have given up and decided that scholarship isn't worth it. Or  
who knows? Maybe they even finished the things. There are still a few  
dedicated souls at work, though, and occasionally a staccato keyboard  
run announces a DikuMUD in progress. The wall clock tells me there are  
forty-five minutes left before I get kicked out.  
   It is time to get to work. 
   For the past couple years, I had a project: to make Matthew Thyer's  
Internet life a hell. With one last look around, I call up the local 
BBS, and begin to post horrible, senseless gibberish. First, I make fun  
of Mr. Thyer's grammar; next, his spelling; and lastly and most 
enjoyably, I attack him personally. I use great imagination, making sure 
I have completely addressed his every shortcoming. 
   Gosh, what fun. 
   No, that is not a true story. But is it accurate? 
   Considerable debate often arises over public access bulletin boards.  
It is unfortunate that so often they become war grounds instead of  
whatever the programmer originally intended. There are a great number of  
very intelligent people using the boards who tend to see posting as a 
competition; for them it is a great source of pride to be the one who has the  
most skill in programming, language, articulation, or whatever is on the 
table for discussion. 
   The ones who get hurt by this are those who are unable or unwilling  
to play aggressively. Bulletin boards become unusable by less willful  
information or socialization seekers because of the antagonistic nature  
of the board. 
   I realize this is not a universal problem, but it is certainly a  
common one. And an aggressive personality and/or intellect can also be a  
great asset to a BBS, guiding and providing. Our minds are everything in  
this environment. We have a responsibility to be aware of the power that  
gives us.
