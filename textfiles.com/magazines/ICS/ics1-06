	Greetings,

	We finally managed to send you issue number five, and just to
	prove we are back and producing zines on an ALMOST regular 
	basis, here begins ICS Electrozine issue number six.  The staff is
	changing as regularly as we produce new issues. *snicker*

	This is the first ICS issue to be sent out in fragment form.  The
	survey that was sent out during the spring indicated that a large
	percentage of our subscribers wanted ICS to be sent to them in
	smaller and more frequent issues.  Thus, we are switching to the
	fragment system.  We will be sending each issue out in the form
	of two or three fragments.  These fragments will then be compiled
	into one large issue to be stored on anonymous FTP archive sites.

	The new staff and the old are gradually going their own ways, as
	not all people can continue to put as much time into the zine as 
	is neccessary.  This is my way of saying that my presence in the 
	ICS Electrozine will be much less than it has been in the past.  
	I still plan to write for ICS, but I am also giving the new regime 
	their chance to do the zine better and take it to new heights.  
	After this issue, Jeremy Bek will be the ICS Technical Director and 
	I will be on call if something arises that the regular ICS staff 
	cannot handle.  Anyone that would like to learn of my other
	internet projects feel free to write me at through EMAIL and I
	will let you know what things new are being contemplated.  You
	can mail me at ADP_DEVA@WSC.COLORADO.EDU.

	This issue features a review of a unique card game.  The review
	is written by Russell Hutchison.  This issue is also being put
	together by Jeremy Bek as his first attempt.  So, contact him
	at ORG_ZINE@WSC.COLORADO.EDU if you have any comments, criticisms,
	or just want to congratulate him on his meteoric promotion.

	Let this issue represent the dawning of a new era.  Let the staff
	know if you like what you see.

                        By Steven Peterson

    In this, my maiden voyage into the brave new world of electronic 
communication, I would like to explore my reactions to the impending 
changes facing the television industry in America. As I sit here, large 
multi-national corporations are battling for control of the next stage 
of cable television expansion. This expansion involves bringing hundreds 
of channels to the average citizen of our country, allowing individuals 
to specifically program entertainment in a pseudo-interactive way. In 
using the term "pseudo-interactive", I am attempting to describe the 
limitations of programming choices offered by our entertainment 
industry and the implied boundaries this will place on true 
intellectual engagement. American television has evolved to a point 
where it effectively defines reality for a growing segment of our 
population. Realizing this fact, various corporate and political 
entities have fused psychology, marketing, and video technology to 
create a new science of indoctrination. The intellectually passive 
nature of television provides a perfect forum for the dissemination of 
these new, subtle forms of propagandistic persuasion. Currently, 
free-market demands are the only limiting force (aside from our Federal 
Communications Commission) controlling manipulative programming.
    In many ways, the American theatre of television has compromised our 
democratic form of self-government. Our entire electoral process is 
already conducted as a sort of "ratings battle". We elect our leaders 
pretty much on the basis of appearance. All of our major (and many minor)  
political decisions are now resolved according to criteria imposed by    
broadcast methods. Our elected leaders are more or less forced to reduce 
any statements of policy to "sound-bites", six to eight second fragments 
of discourse designed to appeal to television news editors. These fragmented 
statements effectively alienate viewers from adopting a well-informed 
position on any of the major issues facing our nation. Cut off from any 
valid forms of political revelation, the average citizen in America has 
grown to view the entire republican approach to government as divorced 
from the effects of individual involvement and perhaps beyond comprehension. 
Personally, I feel it is this "distancing" that is responsible for the lack 
of civic identification I have felt over the course of my life. I simply 
cannot develop any measure of respect for community leaders who seem to 
be "playing for the camera". And play for the camera they do ... from minor 
press conferences to national elections, image has replaced substance as 
the common coin of political success. All too often, political indiscretions 
are obscured and hidden by finely crafted efforts to manipulate public 
reaction to imagery. The media's portrayal of Oliver North springs to mind 
as a perfect example of this use of imagery. I believe most Americans wanted 
to believe the defense this "all-american" looking patriot offered during the 
potentially devastating Iran-Contra trial. When faced with allegations 
of massive improprieties condoned by our President (an inference on my 
part), our citizenry generally chose to accept any explanations 
this seemingly upstanding individual offered. It is this willingness to 
accept the world as it is portrayed on television as reality that       
concerns me. This modern "blind-faith" compromises any attempts to challenge 
(and improve) the course of our development as a nation and as individuals. 
Ironically, Americans depend on this same media to expose and protect 
ourselves against these types of abuse. When technology gains the capacity  
to control and influence our standards for expression, public and private,  
it also gains the potential to control the minds and hearts of every     
individual in our society. 
    Socially, the spectre of five hundred channels of programmable 
entertainment will most likely contribute to the increasing 
fragmentation of our society. Allowed to descend into the depths of 
factional interests, most individuals will see little reason to 
"decentrate", or attempt to understand other's perspectives. At this 
point, I run into one of the central conflicts inherent in the 
"information age" - how to balance highly specialized information 
against a bewildering array of valid viewpoints without becoming bogged 
down in a morass of confusion. This lack of a viable common context in    
which to place our individual impressions and beliefs effectively 
prohibits the use of technology as a focal point for unifying the people 
of a nation. On the bright side, technology does offer the people of our 
world the chance to dissolve the barriers which separate us physically 
and intellectually.
    The most troubling aspect of this cable revolution is the 
overwhelming amount of control large corporate entities are battling 
over. These corporations are seeking to control the sources of 
programming material as well as the mechanical means of delivery. They 
seem to be willing to offer hundreds of choices, but they will still 
retain control over which choices you are allowed to make. I find this 
system somewhat reminiscent of the former Soviet Communist Party's methods of 
maintaining and controlling power. Ultimately, our most fundamental 
right to simply turn the damned thing off may be compromised by strong 
social pressure to "participate" in this new culture. Given the choice 
between a propoganda-free mind and social isolation, most Americans will 
choose "interpersonal" indoctrination every time. This new multi-        
billion dollar industry will create an opportunity to amass the 
necessary capital for monopolistic control over the production 
facilities required to produce programs. I can easily forsee the 
anti-trust suits that should accompany the resolution of the corporate 
take-over battles, and I truly hope that there is an organization out 
there with the courage to file a true "class-action" suit. 
    Perhaps I have just grown cynical about the average level of 
independent thinking American citizens are capable of. Then again, I 
walk into my college classrooms and see my peers (?) approaching 
education itself as a passive activity. Bean counters, I call 'em, 
people who are attempting to collect their daily doses of knowledge with 
this unstated expectation that wisdom will magically spring forth 
with no effort on their part. This attitude, a product of television 
viewing habits, insidiously taints my education by forcing the 
faculty of my college to "play" to this type of student audience.        
Simply increasing the scope of material available doesn't promise to alter  
this fundamentally passive habit of blindly accepting statements made 
from a position of relative authority. 
    So, is there a solution to this dilemma? Probably not. Television 
has gained such a powerful hold over our society that any attempts to 
regulate it will be resisted by entities with the money and clout 
required to block any such attempts. The real battle will be fought at 
the individual level by people committed to maintaining the intellectual 
integrity of our nation. Personally, I am currently preparing to embark 
on a career of secondary teaching, so this issue is of more than passing 
concern to me. The spectre of a sub-literate nation controlling vast 
nuclear and other weapons technology doesn't exactly fill me with 
confidence, or hope. The final irony may be that the technological 
revolution responsible for these weapons may also rob us of the 
judgement required to maintain control over it.

     Recently I was in a game store in Colorado Springs when a friend of
mine noticed four decks of cards of the game Magic, The Gathering, on 
display.  He pointed them out to me and informed me that the game was 
sweeping the nation.  In fact, he had called around to multiple game 
distributers all over the mid-west and said he wanted some Magic.  "Doesn't 
everybody", was the common response.  After hearing several stories
from the shop owner about how fast the game was selling (Up to 40 decks
of cards after one demonstration!) I decided to get a deck and try it 
out.  My friend whipped out his VISA and bought the other three.  I felt
that he was going over board with the game, until I played it for the 
first time.  Now I wish I had bought at least another deck.
     The game was designed by Richard Garfield Ph.D., and is published
by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.  It is a combination of trading cards
with art from over 20 artists and a card game that is more or less like 
the card game called War, except infinitely more interesting and fun.
Within each deck of cards are cards which represent various types of Land,
Creatures, Artifacts, and Spells.  Land cards represent the the magic
power that is accessable to each player.  Certain types of land are 
necessary to put different cards in play.  Creatures are used to cause 
"damage" to your opponent and to defend you from your opponents' 
creatures.  Artifacts are cards that are used to strengthen your power
and weaken your enemy.  Spell cards are used to damage your opponent, 
his/her creatures, or artifacts and strengthen your creatures.
     The most common game played is a two player version, called a Duel,
but multi-player games are possible.  Games are usually played to win
an ante of one random card.  By winning certain games the strength of 
your deck will increase (or decrease) and there will be weaknesses that
you will need to repair through trading or Duels.  
     One aspect of the game that makes it much more interesting is that 
there are 300 cards in the series (so far) and each deck holds only 60 
randomly selected cards.  Thus, the contents of any one deck is never 
known when opponents first meet.  More types of cards are in the works
and so are booster packs for those who just want to add a little spice 
to their decks.  
     All in all this game is one of the most fun games to hit the scene
in quite some time.  The play testers of the game have been playing
for more than two years and are still going strong.  So, I have high
hopes that this game will provide entertainment for many years to come.

It's a story eagles have always told,
But humans are just again learning to hear it.
It's a story from back when the dragons ruled
And bigger was known to be better:
Bigger and tougher and more armored against all
Even life, those were the standards:
Might made right;  the strong got stronger
And the big just got bigger and bigger.

That's like the story the humans tell;
But as humans tell it, it goes nowhere:
Things changed, and the dragons simply perished.

But the story the eagles tell is different,
The story humans are just learning to hear.
The way the eagles tell it, some of the little dragons,
Little in some ways, but strong in their own way,
Began to change too.
They gave up on the claws and armor;
And their claws grew long and delicate and fragile,
And their scales became long, soft and fluffy.

How the big dragons laughed!
Har! Har! thundered the thunder-dragons,
As the soft little lizards hopped and flapped along
Little soaring leaps to avoid being clawed and bashed
Trampled and smashed by the heavy armored feet.

But the webbing claws and the feathering scales
Continued to lengthen even as the thunder-dragons
Continued to laugh their thunderous laugh, repeating the wisdom:
Bigger is better;  might makes right;  nothing succeeds
Like success:  bigger claws and thicker scales--

Think of that now, says the eagle,
As you watch me ride the shatter of light
Up the face of the mountain.
Think of that as you strain to see the cranes
A mile up with their great transcontinental wingbeat,
Or follow the dart and swoop of the swallow.
Think of that as you look for your way
In a world going mad with bigness, toughness, armor.

     The dark cloak of sleep was pulled slowly away from Eric's eyes 
and mind.  He knew something was happening, something important, but he 
felt as if he was trying to think through a black gauze bandage.  The 
young boy opened one of his eyes, his half-gaze fell upon a small, 
dark, hunched shape, with multiple, blazing red eyes, squatting well 
within his arms reach.  Panic started to build in Eric's chest with a 
warm pressure and a heady, almost fuzzy feeling gripped his still 
groggy mind as adrenaline kick started his thoughts.  At the same 
time the creature's unseen jaws snapped shut.  Eric hardly noticed that 
he screamed as he slammed his back into the wall behind his bed, trying, 
by force of will, to merge with the wall or grind a path to safety through 
it with his shoulder blades.  The creature, which seemed to be smaller 
than a toaster, didn't even flinch.  Eric's vision finally cleared and in 
the weak moonlight he found himself staring at the glowing face of his 
new digital clock.  He stared at it a while longer while his breathing 
returned to normal and his hands began to shake slightly.
     The sound of foot steps approaching his closed door and his 
mother's voice calling his name helped to calm him down.  The door was 
pushed open and the vague shape of his mother's head poked through the 
dark rupture.
     "Eric, honey, are you alright?" Eric could hear the worry in his 
mother's voice and the sound of her hand sliding across the wall, vainly 
searching for the light switch.  He closed his eyes, waiting for his 
vision to become red.
     "I'm fine, mom." Eric heard the heavy, ponderous footsteps of his 
barrel-chested father coming closer.  "I had a bad dream, and the clock 
scared me."
     "We heard you scream," his mom said.  There was a sharp click and 
the insides of Eric's eyes glowed red.
     "Yeah, I thought the clock was a monster, it scared me."
     "Awful short monster," said his father from the hall.  His balding 
head visible in the light spilling over the mother's shoulder into the 
hall.  "I don't think you have anything to worry about, son."  A yawn 
contorted his face into the visage of a man in pain. "Good night, pup."
The father disappeared from view.
     "Good night, dad."
     "Good night, Eric.  Get some sleep, you have school tomorrow."
     "Yes, mom.  I love you."
     Eric looked back at the clock, making sure that it was really a 
clock.  A small tag was taped to the clock.  It read: "Happy eleventh 
birthday!  Love ya bro',  Mike."  There was a click and the room was 
draped in darkness again.  Only the glowing numbers on the clock were 
visible as his eyes adjusted back to the moonlight.  Eric watched the 
time change from 1:10 A.M. to 1:11, and his night vision had almost  
completely returned.
     But the horror, when, in the crystalline silence left in the wake of his 
parent's departure, the sound of the monster's jaws snapping shut sounded 
from the far side of the room.  Eric tore his gaze from the glowing machine
and tried, fruitlessly, to spot the creature.  But the moonlight pooling on 
the floor made the section of the room between the window and the light 
as black as pitch.  Young Eric was about to call to his parents again 
when the sound happened again.  But this time he knew the source.  
Someone was bouncing pebbles off his window.
     Eric hopped out of bed and walked quietly to the window.  Pressing 
his face against the cool, clear glass he saw his best friend, Paul, 
waving to him from the ground, one floor down.  Wasting no time, Eric put 
on warm clothes that were warm and dark in color.  He then slipped out 
his bedroom door and took his usual path, the one where he knew all 
the squeaky floor-boards to the front door.  He checked to make sure he 
had the key in his pocket before he closed the door.  While he did this 
Paul had come around the corner of the house, moving in the shadows around 
the base of the house.  The two boys held their greetings until after 
the door was closed and they had safely crossed the street into a greenbelt 
between the neighbors yards.  
     Eric slapped Paul on his shoulder, "You dork, you scared the hell 
out of me!  I thought Mike's clock was a monster...for a second."
     "It's good to see you, too.  I sneak out of my house, risk getting 
grounded for life by seeing you, all just to say happy birthday, and you 
slap me because your rapist brother's clock scares you. " Gawd, what a 
jerk!"  Paul, with arms akimbo, fixes Eric with a gaze of mock hurt.
     "I'm sorry about hitting you, but I was scared...and don't talk 
like my brother is bad.  He's my family...even if he was guilty.  And 
how can you say bad stuff about him when he used to play with us both 
all the time?"
     "I guess my mom is rubbing off on me.  She still forbids me to see 
you.  I guess she thinks that you'll turn out bad too, and you'll pull 
me down with you.  She says that you only care about him because you've 
never known a female who was raped."
     "Bull, I know what I feel! Your mom is full of it!"
     "Who cares anyway?  I just want to go stealthin'.  We haven't done 
that since Mike's trial."
     "Yeah, lets go. I...I need to be moving or something."
     The two boys started to play their game of stealthin', and within 
twenty minutes of dodging and hiding from cars and people Eric's humor 
returned.  But then, while they were hiding in a bush, the faint sound 
of Paul's mom calling his name drifted to their silent hiding place.
     "Oh no! I gotta go!  I'll see you later, Eric," Paul jumped up from 
behind the bush, startling a group of college kids who were heading home 
from last call.
     "Take care!" whispered Eric, but Paul was long gone.
     When the students had passed he stood up and decided that it would 
be best to go home.  He began to sneak his way from bush to bush, and 
car to car.  He only had a few blocks to go and was cutting through a 
greenbelt when he noticed the dark shape of someone walking into the 
other end.  The person was stumbling around, drunk, and since he was 
already hidden Eric thought that he would stay behind a bush and wait 
until the person was gone.  As the dark figure got closer he could tell 
it was a woman.  Then, a large figure burst from the bushes, followed by 
two more.  The first shadow tackled the woman with a shoulder in the 
small of her back.  Eric heard the breath burst from her lungs as she 
hit the ground.  Then the other two shadows swarmed over her.  He 
watched as they cursed at her, wrapping their hands around her throat,
hit her, tore her clothes.  All the time he could hear the woman's sobs, 
labored breathing, and choked off pleas to be released.
     Eric was shaking, he knew he had to do something.  Everything was 
so terrible that he felt like he was watching T.V.  Then it occured to 
him that, if it was T.V. then he couldn't get hurt.  All he would have 
to do is yell or something, then the shadows would leave.  Slowly he 
stepped around the side of the bush.  The dark pile of people was making 
strange noises and saying words that only older kids used before they 
fought.  Eric tried to yell but he couldn't while looking at the 
writhing pile.  He looked up and tried to keep away the sounds by covering 
his ears.
     "Go away," he said, in a voice barely louder than a whisper.
     "GO AWAY!" his shriek tore the muffled comments of the shadows into 
silence.  
     "GO AWAY!" He yelled again.  Eric was starting to feel panic, like 
he was watching the dark monster again, but this time it was moving. 
This time it was saying words, words that he couldn't understand.  They 
were quiet, deep in tone and spoken quickly.  It's voice was like a 
hypnotic spell that was placing the black gauze back around his mind.  
Then a small wimper, from a female voice, escaped from under the 
monster.  The spell was broken and Eric inhaled to scream again.  But 
the monster struck and the world flashed bright as the sun, then faded 
to darkness.
     When he woke it was still dark.  There was no sign of the 
monster or the woman, except for a piece of clothing or two.  Eric 
couldn't see out of one eye and his face ached with heat and pain.
He ran the rest of the way home, racing through the neighborhood like 
something was chasing him.  He threw open his door and rushed through 
his house.  As he ran, a long yell began to leave his throat.  He shoved 
open his door, slamming it into the wall.  In three steps he was on top of 
the monster squatting by his bed.  He grasped it by the tail and whipped 
it against the nightstand over and over, screaming.
     "I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU..." finally the monster shattered in 
his grasp.  Eric dropped to the ground and began to cry.  The world 
flared white and a pair of arms grabbed his shoulders.  It was his 
mother.
     "What's wrong, what are you doing?!"
     Eric looked down at his hand, where an electrical cord was clenched 
instead of a tail.  A tag reading: "Happy eleventh birthday! Love ya 
bro', Mike" lay in the wreckage of the clock.
     "I never want to see Mike again," Eric whispered.  "He's a 
monster."
     "What happend to your face?"
     "The Monster bit me."

			Right After the Middle Word
                          by Jeremy Bek aka rApIeR


	Wheww!  We finnaly got this frag out.  With late assignments and
multiple systems errors we were not quit sure this issue was going out.  
Well, here it is.  Sorry that it is a little late.  We also had another 
technical problem.  So some of you that wanted to subscribe or 
unsubscribe were over looked by the program.  This will be corrected by 
the next issue.  Thank you for your patience.  
	A funny thing happened to me on my way to the computer lab 
today.  I decided to stop off at the local soda shop and pick up some 
refreshment.  As I sat down to drink my freshly cooled rootbeer I 
watched as a little pig came in and ordered a beer.  My eyes watched as the 
bartender served him, while my mind tried to figure out if there was a 
no pets sign outside or not.  After a minute the pig was done and asked 
the bartender for the directions to the nearest bathroom.  After the pig 
explained his bad need to use the lavatory due to pigs haveing small 
blatters, the bartender happly pointed to the nearest restroom.  The pig 
left and the bartender looked at the costumers and announced that ,"The 
bloody pig was going to have an accident on my floor."  We all laughed 
at the thought of the bartender mopping up the pigs mess.  I went for a 
second rootbeer.  By the way, did I tell you I was really thirsty?  All 
the sudden a second pig came in and ordered a beer.  The same thing 
happened with a third and forth pig.  The bartender look confused as he 
wondered what kind of shape his bathroom was in after being used by four 
pigs.  Finaly a fith pig came in and ordered a keg.  The bartender 
happily hoisted it on the table as the pig began to drink the entire keg 
from the spout.  I watched in amazement that pigs had such alcohol 
tolerance.  In the end he stood on three legs and tried to walk out of 
the bar.  Realizing that this did not work he tried it with two and 
found it much easier to work with.  As he dizzly walked out of the bar 
the bartender asked with a confused look on his face,"Are you not going 
to use the bathroom like all the other pigs?"  The pig turned arround 
with a lit cigar in his mouth and said,"No, don't you remember?  I am 
the piggy that goes we-we-we all the way home."
	Hope you caught the joke *EvilGrin*

	This report is for everyone, whether you believe in magic or 
not.  This report should clear your mind of some of the negative rumors 
about thaumaturgy.
	Thaumaturgy is magick.  'Nuff said.  Magick, currently spelled 
magic, is not the evil creation of Satan, as some would have you 
believe.  It also really does exist.  Magic has been around since long 
before the birth of Satan and Satanism.  Magic is simply a different way 
of looking at the world.
	For those of you who believe that magic is evil, let us look at 
why it is viewed as evil. Like  religion, politics, math and science, 
magic is not commonly understood.  We often choose to see magic as 
evil, while we see the other things as merely difficult, but still good. 
Because of the nature of magic, it has a power to it, and we know that   
power has a tendency to corrupt.  Thus, we see people using magic as corrupt;  
therefore, they must be using magical power for destructive purposes.    
We simply choose to ignore or not even see the beneficial ways that magic  
can be, and is, used.  
      Most people associate magic and witchcraft. Witchcraft is commonly  
viewed as worship of demons and devils and Satan. Witchcraft is the study  
of an organized religion, Wicca.  Magic, on the other hand, is the 
study of the forces that make up our world and how they can be used.  
Magic is also known as the study of the Thaumaturgical Sciences, and as 
a science, it is split into subsciences, each dealing with a separate 
way in which magic works.  
	Magic can be, and is, useful in many modern ways.  One way in 
which magic is useful is in the aspect of healing.  Healing magic is a 
powerful method of curing what ails you.  Think of it this way, you 
spend hundreds of dollars a year on medical bills.  Now imagine spending 
just pennies on the dollar going to a spellcaster to cure you of the 
same ailment, using a different method.
	Another way in which magic is useful in modern times is in the 
creation of other substances.  For example, a spellcaster may conceivably    
be able to separate molecules and atoms and combine them magically to create 
completely new atoms and molecules.
	This is all for my report this week.  Next week I will go into 
some of the separate sciences of magic.  Remember, nothing, in itself, 
is evil.  It is those who use it for evil purposes who make things 
appear as evil.

	The cold, bitter wind crawled across Ed's chest as it easily     
worked it's way past his up-turned trench coat collar.  He lowered his 
chin in an effort to break the winds flow and cover the gap at the throat 
of his coat.  The breeze going down his chest stopped.  But there were 
enough gaps between buttons for the wind to leach away all his coveted 
heat, despite his vigilant collar-watching.
	Ed wanted to leave this alley as soon as possible.  He felt that 
all the wind in the city was being channeled through this one concrete 
canyon.  Shivers wracked his body for a second or two but he knew that 
they were more from his withdrawal symptoms than the cold.  He needed to 
get some heroin, soon.  But first he needed the cash.  He could think of 
many places where he could be warmer while he waited for a mark, but 
this alley held a perfect hiding place to jump out of and was between a 
favored slumming place of rich snobby kids and the parking lot.  No 
street lights shed their ambient protection from the dark in this alley, 
and Ed took measures to destroy any such devices that were placed in 
the area to safe-guard the men and women who made the trek through his 
best picking grounds.  However, he wasn't foolish, he never came here 
more than once every two months.  No good hunter ever over-hunts his 
prey.
	The thick clouds blocked out the moon and made the alley a black 
scar between two tall buildings.  The white condensation of his breath 
would be impossible to see even if the wind wasn't there to tear it from 
his chilled lips.  The feeling in his feet had been fading and his 
fingers were getting numb, especially those of his left hand, those which 
grasped the frigid metal of his heavy knife.  
	Then the noise of footsteps approaching were carried to him on 
the wind.  Ed flattened himself against one of the shadowed walls in his 
hiding place and drew out his blade.  A button from his coat pressed 
coldly against his cheek.  He shifted his grip so that he could use the 
pommel of the knife like a hammer to stun or knockout his target long 
enough to take what he needed.
	But as the footsteps got closer Ed heard multiple voices blended 
together by the wind.  He leaned casually against the wall and remained 
as quiet as possible.  A group of two men and one women walked past, but 
it was hard to tell gender in the darkness of the alley. Their foot steps 
were irratic and their voices slurred from drinking.  Ed watched them 
stumble by, only two steps away, black shadows drifting by in a bobbing 
fashion.
	Four more groups stumbled past, the first groups leaving 
after last call.  But none were small enough for Ed to strike out against.
He nervously tapped the flat of the blade with his forefinger as the wind 
began whittling away at his resolve to stay in this frozen spot waiting  
for someone alone.  
	More footsteps approached the alley.  Ed again flattened against 
the wall of his hiding place, this time scooting right to the edge of 
the tiny nook.  No one else had seen him in his spot, and he felt 
confident that he was still hidden.  He was worried about his grip on 
his knife, though.  His hands were so numb that he could hardly hold his 
blade.  The brief scent of perfume and alcohol tore past in traces on the 
wind.  Ed watched as a lone figure entered the mouth of the black path.  
The shadow-ghost came even with his hole and Ed saw that she was alone.  
She passed by and Ed stepped out to strike, his shaky foot settling in to 
a frozen puddle.  The ice cracked loudly.
    	Ed jumped foward and swung his hand in a downward arch at the 
shadowy shape, but the figure had reacted to the sound faster then he 
expected.  He hit nothing.  The shape had stepped forward and turned 
around.  A female voice screamed out, "Get away!" and a warm spray 
burned a horizontal path across Ed's neck.  The line across his 
neck burned like fire.  He then swung a back hand strike, with all his 
strength at the origin of the sound with the pommel leading 
the way.  He felt his swing strike home under the chin of the woman, 
his knife flew out of his grip, disappearing in the darkness.  She fell 
to the ground making sick choking noises.  Ed grabbed her purse and ran.

	Later, while he was riding high on a drug wave, he recieved a 
phone call from his mother.  His cousin and been killed, her throat 
crushed, but the police had a lead on the killer.  Ed was in another 
room when the call came so the answering machine took the message.       
He checked the machine a couple of hours later, only minutes before      
the police arrived to arrest him.

                     """"""""""""""""""""""""""""           
 	During the past few weeks I've been working on an article that 
was originally suggested by George Sibley (Faculty advisor for the ICS) 
that would describe exactly how and if the NET could be a school. When I say 
school, I don't exactly mean a conventional school - one having a teacher 
sit over you day after day informing you that you're behind in your 
homework, your attention skills suck, and if you don't pass next week's 
test you'll be kicked out of your institution and thrown to the dogs. 
	A school can be many things, but for my purposes I'll include 
the most general definition I can find. A tool that helps you search for 
knowledge. To be a little more specific, how does your computer help you 
search for knowledge throughout the vast cosmos of cyberspace? I asked 
several people over the net and I got many answers. 
	I found that if you enter the world of Rhostyshl as an invader 
from the quote RW (Real World) many people will tell you that the NET is 
an incredible world of social interaction. You can be whoever you want 
to be, wherever you want to be and still have "tiny sex" with a 
beautiful princess. When I entered the world of Rhostshyl I explored 
several plains of existence. My character's title was "reporter" and 
here is what I looked like.
 
	"A short and stocky man holding a pad and pencil. Roving around 
	the mysterious world of the NET in search of information wherever he
	can find it!"

The world of MUD games is one that I find takes integrity and believability 
away from the NET. 
	While I was on Rhostshyl I also talked to several people in an 
almost "RW" tense. I asked users why they thought the NET was a 
school, or how the NET helped them learn more than they already knew. 
Several said that it helped them experience a separate social life that 
they could create and control. In my opinion this was a very valid 
argument. The user enters a world in which no racial barriers are held, 
and yet cliques are still formed. A world where the only bias is a person's 
actions. If the contemporary classroom was like this then we wouldn't 
have to worry about Education in Multicultural Societies, all students 
would just be electronic images!  Others said that it versed them in several
different types of computer languages that are necessary to operate on the MUD. 
	I talked to one individual from the University of Illinois who 
sounded like he was doing absolutely incredible things with his life. He 
had his B.A. in Chemical Engineering and is working on his Ph.D. I 
personally admired this man and his accomplishments, so I asked him to 
submit material for the ICS. He informed me that he had "prior commitments".  
I found out later that he was talking about prior commitments to his 
"Guild." 
	At this point I was discouraged. How could the NET be a good 
source of "knowledge" if it made people make a priorities of playing games 
as opposed to learning more about our current world and the people 
within it. Then a ray of hope shone throughout the tunnel of darkness, 
Listserves!
	Listserves, for those of you who don't know, are a type of 
mailing service that sends basic information on specific topics to anyone 
in the NET who wants it. The really neat thing about listserves or 
LSV's is that when someone writes to a general audience you can get 
great publicity! In fact just today I heard about a worldwide contest 
being held by a group of seventh graders who are trying to show the 
world that youth do have the power to influence our environment and our 
future. WOW! talk about a net idea! (bad pun!)  From this same listserve,  
I recieved a direct transcript of Clinton's "Goals 2000" speech, which covered  
the nation's course for improving education. To get this I would have had to  
search all over the U.S., but the listserve gave it to me when I didn't even  
know I wanted it!
	Listserves are not just limited to education. They also include 
the areas of Laser Medicine, Money, Ecology, Horror, Physics, British 
and Irish History, and even Alternative Learning Approaches. 
	The most amazing thing I discovered from was the fact that almost  
any piece of information can be picked up from the listserve ..... eventually!  
If you wait long enough on a couple of different listserves, you will find  
that you can get information within days or sometimes weeks. In my next 
installment I will address the question, "How can a NET student find 
specific information in a timely manner?"

	This is the first of what will be a once an issue column about 
listserves. I will analyze each listserve on the basis of useability, 
friendliness, enjoyment, and activity.  I will also publish the amount 
of average daily mail and memory use and tell you where to mail to 
to subscribe.  We hope this will be useful to our readers, allowing  
you to see the different listserves without using up precious memory.    
I will be going through various forms of listservs, ranging from the political  
to the recreational.  
        In this issue I will be discussing the Shadowrun listserve.      
The Shadowrun listserve is a discussion group on the fantasy role playing  
game Shadowrun tm.  On the basis of usability this group gets an A+. 
This group is a great source for thoughtful discussion and debate of the  
rules of the game.  The members of the listserve are very knowledgable about  
their subject and are generally helpful to anyone who asks for their 
help.  They also have very inventive minds and come up with some pretty  
good ideas. On the basis of friendliness they also get a high score.    
As mentioned earlier, they are always willing to help you think out an   
idea no matter how ridiculous the idea may seem.  If you are a shadowrunner  
you will love the humor created by this group.  In the seven weeks I 
spent analyzing this group I laughed hard enough to knock me off my chair  
a half a dozen times or more.  Very prolific, they put out several yearly 
reports and magazines reporting their inventions, ideas, and major 
discussions.  One of these is called NAGEE(Neo-Anarchists Guide to Everything  
Else), it is approximately .16 megabytes long and is published in several text 
formats. To pickup a copy go FTPing to TeeTot.acusd.edu and look under the  
subdirectories Pub, Beelzebub, Role-Playing, Shadowrun, NAGEE.

	There are a couple of things you may want to know in order to 
subscribe and enjoy this Listserve.  The first is that they use a 
plethora of abbreviations. If you ask, they will send you a complete 
list of terms and what they mean. The THWAP is another thing you may     
be curious about. A THWAP is the sound that a wet carp makes when it 
hits bare skin. This is used when another member of the listserve gets 
really goofy.  You might want to ask for the complete history of the 
THWAP.  Just for fun.  In all this is an extremely useful listserve 
and if you are into Shadowrun I would suggest you join.

			THE FINAL WORD
			       by
			  Ted Sanders



	During my normal search of the world of the NET I've found many 
great and interesting things. I've found that some people MUD too much, 
I've found that some users don't explore enough into the NET, and I've 
also found that a few cyberpunks don't even know what the NET is. The 
entire purpose of the I.C.S. since it was started last December is to 
explore the regions of the "unknown" and make them the regions of the 
known. 
	For those of you who took the time to write back to the staff 
and myself, we thank you, but that's not all that we need. The I.C.S. is 
not only part of the staff writing, but it's a part of the NET. If you 
are recieving the electrozine, we would like you to start thinking very 
seriously about submitting to the I.C.S. At one point in the I.C.S.'s 
history, submissions came pouring over the net (approximately 10 an 
hour), but this year people are beginning to forget about it's 
existance. We LOVE to recieve your articles, it enlightens our world and 
it will probably enlighten yours.
	This Halloween I had a young friend of mine on campus (Western 
State College, Gunnison Colorado) turn in a very interesting story to 
the I.C.S. It was a really great horror story about a modern day 
headless horseman. I told him that I would take a look at it and see 
what we could do. The story that I edited was quite interesting and it 
showed myself and the staff about the incredible imagination of ten 
year olds! Hopefully this story will be out in issue no. 7 Fragment 
no.1. 
	These past few weeks the I.C.S. has been exploring new territory 
that no electrozine has journeyed into before. Our new "Frag" technique 
has thus far proven to be a success. If you feel that the new technique 
is a success, or a failure, we would like to hear from you. As I've been 
told by our new Technical Director, thus far many of you have responded 
saying that the fragment technique has been quite helpful. 
	In conclusion, all you cyberpunks, hackers, users, and solar 
cowboys, keep dreaming of electric sheep and I'll see you in Virtual 
Reality!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	ICS would like to hear from you.  We accept flames, comments, 
submissions, editorials, corrections, and just about anything else you 
wish to send us.  For your safety use these guidelines when sending us
anything.  We will use things sent to us when we think the would be
appropriate for the goal of the issue coming out.  So, if you send us
something that you DO NOT want us to use in the electrozine, then put
the words NOT FOR PUBLICATION in the subject of the mail you send us.
	You can protect your material by sending a copy to yourself 
through the mail and leaving the envelope unopened.
