  "WINGED PHILOSOPHY"

  by
  Travis Ray Cole


  Washed away pain and he dream believed
  defend burning magic dose beliefs
  wish tomorrow wanted to be
  smiling pressure points mark the earth
  time dust stopped clock anti-beliefs
  bats hiding over me uniformed
  save the love,feeling apathy
  where they nailed jesus to the cross
  maybe because he came instead of me
  white smoke against angels wings
  nails in your hands and feet
  lines of life preying fetish mind diease
  acupunture rinse killed a tree
  a tree for a cross
  tell on me lift it for society
  blame them for the flag meaning nothing but
  preacher's humour is no longer amus-ing
  trade christmas headstones trip for seeds
  in need of new love
  playing games strong as the sea
  released to hold on to me
  in the arms of rock and roll
  ive wanted you and only dreamed
  burning in love
  i know you wanna believe theres nothing up above
  lighting skies made easy and moved tornados
  war time lust what could it mean
  rivers glowed with blood
  envy green spells turning
  man made god god made dream
  its you i really love
  throw away thoughts never again seen
  angel didnt have to love at least not me
  lust would see no where is ever home
  run out on me
  go the moon is full
  i'll always wait and see
  the snake die and bleed.
  shadows in the garden eating glass
  as the second hand moves lie to me
  in coming for the last strike
  never wounded with lost love

  ========================================================


  "The Non-Art of Angel's Wings"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole


  Angel a miracle psyche's in love with me
  truth in love magic honesty
  whose breath creates more than material possessions
  speak philosophies wait for me
  stone castles have stone walls they fall
  bridge across the rivers of hell
  I taste her dream loves beautiful form
  mind shadows wizards gods and kings
  all pray to angel's wings
  past life lust balance mind healing
  shes got power over me
  entangled in routine
  universal thoughts more art than poetry
  burden of beliefs worship is she the devil i see?
  I put her on a cross
  goddess halo hearts break and roses feeling
  real can not be lost
  unlocked her heart is free
  only to want only me

  ========================================================


  "The Game"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole


  I lead and die,retreat
  next turn sacrafice exceeds
  beyond the limit of need
  one more time your move
  don't try to why would you cheat and lose
  next is a forced turn
  no dice your off your feet
  time runs out it seems
  clock takes its lonely turn
  opens the board filled with war
  rules and church of life theme
  mind win trip scheme
  I think we win to lose
  not ever knowing the price of dues
  I dream of your next move
  keeping score by death once more
  knowing what the other side holds
  not greener and there is no gold
  the many pieces that don't fit the puzzle
  not thinking we lose each other
  so left is the ghost of knight
  the dying mustang ride
  and as many queens as death warrants
  a pawn that don't want to be a number anymore
  leaving only the colors of hurt
  never living in check anymore
  do you wanna play some more
  the black widow no viel
  slides across the crossroads
  no devil to take my name

  ========================================================

  "Same Question"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole


  Is this what you want it to mean?
  lie awake and dream another minute of speech
  words bite me and birds sing
  like it was a joyous thing
  rollercoaster waste lines
  rip apart my very mind
  don't stop to let me breathe
  breath of fire
  poision scream
  I can't think about you
  or what you've stolen of me
  could've held you in the rain
  mind lost am I without you
  rusted metal piercing
  blood.....run
  mine keeps flowing
  out of the life I seek
  am I just dying?
  honey's been too sweet
  stealing time taking dreams
  while it could've been you and me
  theres one way to save the heart
  thats stabbing outward in a hell of greed
  still its left without me
  leaving only the echo of need
  all I could ask myself
  is'nt it just a nightmare?
  does it mean anything?
  As the clouds keep turning
  black and piccasso grey
  killing the art around us
  making life into time dust waste

  ========================================================


  Demon Seed

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  I wanna bite the apple,I wanna kill the snake
  I wanna skin him alive for heavens sake
  I wanna bite the apple,spit out the seed
  cause the lord knows I'm the demon seed
  in revelations or on page one
  when he comes calling the deed is done
  I wanna eat the apple,I got the hunger and need
  for the taste of Eve the morning brings
  I wanna bite the apple,kill the snake
  take all the blame,it's not her mistake

  ========================================================


  The River

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  If I go off................................to war,
  will you still wait for me?

  If the pigs set me up tomorrow
  will you wait till I'm free?

  you still have cable television
  to save your nites alone

  we will always be together just like a country song and believe in true
  love like it'll never end

  I know I'm just thinking about the future
  and the day I'm gone I lose

  If something comes between us
  is it me that you will choose?

  theres no guarentee
  as boring as life could be
  will you always be true
  and chain your ass to me?
  oh let our love flow AT$T

  ========================================================


  "What's in a name"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  A rose by any other name,does not equal you
  don't judge a rose by it's color,
  one petal is not even close to the truth
  roses dying on the cross,no way to rebloom
  give me your love, I'll give it back
  I only want a girl like you
  a path of rose petals opening up
  for love feeling truth
  a lie about a rose could come back
  & stick right into you
  a trail of roses on the ground for you to walk upon
  even without love, a rose dies and is gone
  when your love grows deep in the heart of the sun
  with the mist of dew in its mind,
  waiting for the summer
  all the time... you spent waiting,
  thought I'd never come
  from the bush where
  love emerges and unfolds our love
  a bud has awakened ,everythings coming up roses
  and the rose water that is steeping
  is distilling for your lucious loving mind

  ========================================================


  "How do you start over"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  I started with nothing
  I want nothing
  I need nothing
  I have nothing
  I leave it all behind
  theres to much weight to carry
  to keep these things with me
  I need this,this is mine
  I want nothing
  I have nothing
  I am nothing
  nothing is mine
  there is to much to keep
  I really dont need this muesum of mine
  I leave it
  I start over
  yeah its over
  and I dont even have or need what was/is mine
  I start with nothing
  not even a memorie I try to forget the time
  I start at the end
  I start to begin
  I start without you this time
  Ive got to keep going
  I can not stay here and rust and rot
  while you are doing fine?
  I start again
  I see no end for me I have to try
  you can have what you need or what I dont
  thats ok...yeah it is fine
  I leave these things that slow me down
  Ive got to far to climb
  I would take you with me but you couldnt last
  and I dont wanna leave you whereever
  Im not coming back to in this life
  I start without you
  I am without you
  I dont feel it
  like its a lie
  I...
  wish you could run with me
  I wish you had my seed
  I wish I could hold you and make it alright
  I WISH
  that I could believe
  I wish I lived the dream
  and never want to die

  I want nothing
  I need nothing
  I have nothing
  I leave it all behind
  theres to much weight
  to carry
  to keep these things with me
  I need
  this is mine
  I want nothing
  I have nothing
  I am nothing
  nothing is mine
  there is to much to keep
  theres no such thing as deep
  its just levels you and I
  that might be why
  I really dont need this muesum of mind
  ========================================================



  "Another Rose"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  You to me,romanticlly
  love like we hold hands
  wrapped like a thorny vine
  catching holding never letting go to what is inside
  your frozen heart lets go and fly
  like the very meaning of our very bieng
  and love discovers what?
  what we mean,defined what is us what we mean
  love begins to know
  to what is not,you close the door
  I am what you know
  from the middle till the end
  across the street and back again
  as a bird not raven flys
  the darkness turns to light.
  and freedom screams our dream
  light shut out the night alone we two
  just me and you
  from the crossroads the devildog is gone
  you are not a dove we two are just love
  and held like it was gods hands holding me you
  rolling the dice in the middle
  of the intersection of our life.
  you fly
  but not away
  not away from me
  not away from me this time
  there is no him
  there is no her
  there is us
  love in the heart of lust
  could the choice be made
  could the decision be wrong?
  we will live within while living out this poem.
  stealing from the games score
  We keep playing
  play somemore
  kiss me one time I adore
  the heart that you do hide
  the love in your mind
  the times we said goodbye..

  ========================================================


  "War Room"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole


  Yes I have been there
  it was me
  getting my share of some fantasy
  the war room
  all things of war
  make your move
  war whore
  the war room
  with piece of mind
  looking to acceppt what is me this time
  I dont know if I can deal with what is me this time
  it is me inside
  it is peace I find
  the war room
  and its been sometime
  the medals of hate to celebrate
  the photos of what the rich have left
  do your napiolian james dean
  the war room
  holds onto me
  and loves only me
  because theres no one else around
  and the devil comes as pretty
  as push comes to shove
  the war room
  with a hundred doors
  its got its own asmosphere
  dont leave me alone
  come back and love me
  until I love
  the war room
  a fantasy
  relived
  the war room
  from where I have lived
  the war room
  a block from where I was born
  the war room
  the war whore
  the bullets and shells stained with blood
  the pieces of hundreds of years
  and countries that fell
  at no price
  the cost is mine
  the past of time
  the peace that I find in
  the war room
  the lust too.
  I never thought of dying soon
  where is my self
  I love myself
  where is the dream
  I think fantasy
  so I come to
  THE WAR ROOM...
  ========================================================



  "Filth"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  Shes so burnt out on love
  I could do anything
  she dont think of love
  and now her hearts not frozen

  she sometimes goes without
  and it does'nt get her anything
  she wants to end the life that needs a life
  to get over living again

  she wants to run from the problems
  of love that no love is taking
  she knows theres no where to go
  but shes gotta get outta the rain

  shes so burnt out on love
  theres no lust in anything
  shes not turned on
  or in tune to what I am playing

  she is thinking of something else
  and her minds not on what Im saying
  so I get bored with lust
  until you show me something

  ========================================================


  "ART OF WAY" by

  Travis Ray Cole


  The Artist is the art
  she moves,she moves me
  she speaks and calls my name
  she laughs I can smile and dream
  I said shes love
  reason
  I've waited all this time for something
  not really knowing until I seen it
  at this point there is no season
  the begining
  she gives me clubs hearts and diamonds
  the spades I dig up on my own
  she lets me win until the last moment
  and puts me in checkmate again
  she spins and tries to get it off the ground
  its up to the wind to choose to take it
  I run with her
  I run for her
  I run to her
  she is a gift
  she is she I am me
  together we listen
  to her I whisper
  don't I tell her my best line
  and go back and rewrite them?
  can I ever really love what is love
  am I the only one
  I should not say anything about it
  its too late
  I could'nt wait
  just outta the blue
  from nowhere
  "I love you"
  across the sound
  from now on
  would I say the right thing
  would'nt I do anything
  and be crazy enough to quit
  whatever got in the way
  crazy about the reason I have to love
  me and you
  ========================================================


  Bread and water"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  Bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  The airs to thin to run
  The sky ain't blue
  Bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  nowhere to hide
  your love ain't true
  Bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  If I can't be free
  I can't be cool
  dying to live my life with
  without with without
  am I on the right track
  or am I just another?
  am I going to ever win
  you as my lover
  everything that comes my way is SHIT compared to you
  bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  bread and water think of you
  I don't belive in free
  I belive in you.

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  Ink or die bleed again color not fade away,mine

  "Lab Rats"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  THIS IS A TEST,THIS IS ONLY A TEST
  Mice and monkey,wheel in cage
  test you until your trained
  toxic rodent losing rat race
  tastes like chicken,fed to the snake
  infectious disease research cell freezing
  lost in a maze cheesy albino with lesions

  Rat brain in space,sattlite reception
  double dose of cloned mutation
  micrscopic study prevention
  genetic strain of humane intervention

  from the brain and seminal fluid
  of the rat comes acid phosphate
  dying in a rat trap,last in the rat race
  not really giving a rats ass
  I smell a rat in space

  domestic lab rat died here insane
  rat pack,rat patrol,rat breath,cat bait
  dying of strictnine poisioning
  rat acid ,rats bane

  "Dream Catcher"

  by

  Travis Ray Cole

  If she took all this time to follow me to stalk me
  and stake me out ,study me without a doubt
  read my words my every thought
  break into my mind,hide out then get caught
  shes a little bit more than a part of me
  common factor is we're both into me
  she knows more about me than I do myself
  and I thought I needed help
  who the hell is she I want to know
  I'm really flattured but I don't know
  I could take her out for burritto's
  and hold her close nibble on her ear and kiss her eskimio
  is she crazier than me should
  I run hide or just say cheese
  i could lose her if I wanted too
  but I'm strangly attracted to
  I could out run her
  day or night
  but somehow turning hunter
  into hunted just seems right.

  Travis Ray Cole

  THE CRYSTALS ON THE LITTLE RED HAIRS
  REACHING OUT FROM THE LIGHT GREEN
  SOILD MASS TURNING TO DUST
  GREEN AND RED DUST
  GOD MADE ART LIVING DIE LIVE AGAIN IN MIND

  REACHING FOR THE LIGHT
  AIR MOVING IN AND AROUND
  ROOTS THAT KNOW NOT THE GROUND
  WATER FILLED WITH AIR

  WE CAN SAVE THE WORLD
  WE CAN SAVE OURSELVES
  WE CAN SMELL THE FLOWERS
  THE DARKNESS THE ROOTS KNOW
  THE REACHING FOR NIGHT AND
  WANTING TO GROW.

  "Signal from nowhere" by

  Travis Ray Cole


  How clean her wrists looked.....uncut
  viens shining through
  bieng scutinized critized and trapped
  under the microscope
  all the time
  how clean her thoughts were
  with the truth only to lie to her
  no time for like today
  taking
  lying because she cares
  yeah
  loving because lifes there
  shining like cold blue steel
  cold water wont stop the cruel
  pain in flesh,fog dense thick haterd
  a victim of yourself
  reaching to yesterday for help
  no heaven to save a soul
  the ground is so cold
  go not to hell
  and you'ld rather not love me
  than love yourself
