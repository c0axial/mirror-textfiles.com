*                               Gently down the stream
*                               Merrily merrily merrily merrily

May  May  May  May  May  May Releases 2002:

594: "Anthem For Humanity" by Eric Chaet.  Mr Chaet sat and ate at an
amazing rate to impress Kate, as they were late to catch the bus to
their fate, using hate as bait. - Thanks Eric! -

595: "Top 10: Why Life Is Like A Bed Of Roses" by DIzzIE.  Do not let this
seemingly happy title fool you. This file is written by the notorious
existentialist/frustrationist DIzzIE. We all know what that implies. Get
ready to get depressed and suicidal. Schopenhauer is Prozac in
comparisation.

596: "Sore Loser's Anthology" by Freon.  A bunch of poems written by Freon,
most of which he wrote recently, though there's one very old one in there
too. Freon himself considers this file "extremely bad," and will not object
if you do so too. (But the uXu does not.)

597: "My Neighbors & I" by Eric Chaet.  Take the time to follow the
discussion between Eric and his neighbors in a wide range of topics. The
only connection between all the stories seem to be... well, find out for
yourself, duh!

598: "Glasgow City 2001" by The GNN, Freon and ChameleonMessiah.  Last
summer, The GNN went to Glasgow to attend a conference in philosophy. Now,
who did he meet there, if not the talented writer Freon and his friend
ChameleonMessiah. After ten hours of hard drinking, this text (or what the
hell is should be called) emerged on the computer screen.

599: "I Dance in Circles from the Bridge" by Jay DeKalb.  Jay is back and
is inviting you to dance. Dance with your eyes. Dance with your mind.
Inspiring work of the sensitive kind.

600: "Decade. One. uXu." by uXu.  It has been more than ten years since
The Chief began his quest for the holy text files. Be sure not to miss what
he has to say about what happened along the way. Reading between the lines
is required. You have been warned.

601: "Second Coming, Limited" by Freon.  This is a silly, blasphemous
ten-minute play about the never-ending struggle between good and
incompetence, starring Jesus Christ, a dude named Lester, and God. Some say
money is not everything. That is true. Usually it is not even enough...

602: "Jack & The Reformatory" by Eric Chaet.  What is fair and what is
unfair? Follow the discussion in this text by the notorious Chaet who is
back again with another tale about the ones we hardly ever hear from.

603: "Stained Hands" by Joseph.  Joseph is probably more known to the
Swedish audience of uXu. This Mianaserin/Imovane-addict, who spent last
Christmas at a porn club in Gothenburg, now wish to share some of his
English poems with you. For maniacs and women only.

604: "Majik" by Lisa Guliani.  This is the story of a woman living in a
reclusive cabin in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. She finds comfort in
friends she meets online at her computer. She meets the mysterious "Majik"
in a sexroom chat, and little by little, over the course of months, she
begins to fall in love with this faceless stranger. A story for every
internet junkie.

605: "My Castle Called Life" by Matthew Hewitt.  A detailed description of
a piece of poetry is robbing the experience from the eventual reader of the
same. Read and enjoy and send us and/or the author some feedback.

606: "Five Poems" by Eric Chaet.  The highly productive writer Eric Chaet
here gives you a collection of five poems that mixes humble views at the
present situation with powerful explosions of insights. Should be read,
as a poem a day keeps the doctor away. In other words, read or die.

607: "Altruism And The Open Source Movement" by Freon.  Who would come up
with the crazy idea to compare ground squirrels and women? Freon would.
Freon is. He is back to make you even more confused than you ever thought
you would ever become.

608: "Personal Essay: Bookwarez & Text File Scene" by DIzzIE.  One of our
most active contributors is sharing his view on the contemporary bookwarez
and text file scene. Some ups, some downs and a list to sign.

609: "An Apologetic For The Pretty Pictures" by Huewle.  Four big poetry
bits for you to chew on. Do not be shy, come and eat what we have here.
Served at room temperature, and going down from there.

610: "The Anti-Apocalypse" by Peter Hogg.  Not your usual good vs evil
text. They go at it as they should. That is what they are there for.
Something for the Nostradamus fans, as this seems to be heavily influenced
by his cryptic way of expressing himself. But that is only my opinion.
You could be wrong.

611: "When they speak of books, the nation..." by Eric Chaet.  Letting us
all know how things really are, after the long sleep. You wake up and find
yourself in a place called reality. It is not a nice place, but there is
nowhere else to go.

612: "Sperm Donor Clown" by Rachel I. Dotson.  Here are five real-life and
in many ways true poems by one of our new contributors. Rachel is a
21-year-old college student from Ohio, seeking to be an English
professor/freelance writer. She is currently working on a B.A. in English.

613: "From the Deep" by Eric Chaet.  Hush! This song should be played and
sung quietly, so as to not wake anyone... Permission is granted for others
to record the song with their own music, provided they credit Eric Chaet
and notify him.

614: "Trotting To China" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  Making the world a better
place is certainly not easy. But some at least try, and they are worthy of
all admiration. Have you heard about Paul Coleman and his one-man crusade
to save the Earth? If not, read this file and become inspired.

615: "Imagine Being In Power" by Eric Chaet.  Imagine you were in a
position of power in the world. That is the situation. How would you spend
your money to do good, rather than only to further enrich the richest, at
the expense of everyone else and of the common wealth of the planet? That
is the question. What is the answer?

616: "Bowed heads of Palms" by Stephanie.  Giving us this short poem,
Stephanie introduces herself to the uXu readers. Nothing more to add. Just
go ahead and read it. The text itself will fill in the blanks.

617: "uXu Index #40" by uXu.  Thirty nine indice later, here we are.
Another release, another index. Within it you will as always, find a list
of all files that goes with this release, including the Swedish ones.
