                         THE DAY OF THE SPEED DEVIL
                             by THE GNN/DCS/uXu



Paranoid? I really had to know.
   Modus operandi: I did number two in a shoe box and placed it outside the
door to my apartment. Then I dialled a random number and told the person who
answered that he now could come by and pick up that kilo of methamphetamine
I had promised him - it was placed in a package outside my door. Before
whoever-it-was had the chance to reply, I hung up. Then I waited. It took
four and a half minute before two boys in blue burst into my apartment. One
held the shoe box. The other explained with a happy voice that I was a damn
pusher, but that it was all over now, etc. Really? I said. Oh yes! they said
and tore up the box like two children on Christmas day. Needless to say,
they split immediately after a brief investigation of my excrement. (One of
them will hardly use his fountain pen ever again.)
   So now I knew: I was not paranoid. My phone was actually tapped.



                                                             A true story.
