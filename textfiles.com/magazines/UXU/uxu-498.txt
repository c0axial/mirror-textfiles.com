*   The intro. "Quotes are good -
*               when you run out of interesting things to say."
*
*   I am currently training my two sons to become politicians. I want
*   them to be successful, well known (maybe even famous) and of course,
*   rich. I began early to teach them that they can get away with
*   anything, as long as they got an excuse. We have training camps
*   where the art of lying are taught and exercised. Then we also have
*   fraud-&-scam, overthrowing-foreign-democracies and hiding-treasures-
*   where-nobody-can-touch-it camps. They have greatly improved their
*   scores in all these areas, and I am so proud! I will get back to
*   you all on this subject when I own an island or two in the Pacific.
*   Long live the free world!
*
*   Three long months, but here we are again. Besides from the content,
*   we have not changed much. We are still bringing you mind fodder,
*   to keep you fit for intellectual challenges, and sensitive for
*   true work of art.
*
*   We bring you fiction, poetry and more in this release. Written
*   purely for your reading enjoyment by seven newcomers: Jay DeKalb,
*   Mobys Dick, BJ Moore, Cindy, Kevin James Miller, Sweety Boop, Nadene
*   Wiggins and Absolute Zero. Then of course we got our uXu veteran
*   The GNN, along with Dr Robert James Berry and Max West giving you
*   their latest works.
*
*   Enjoy.

December  March  December  March  December  March  Releases 1999:

483: "Twist" by The GNN.  Classic science-fiction is usually about one out
of three things: time-travelling, space encounters or teleporters. This is
not a classic piece of sci-fi (as it was written 1999), but it is about
time... hey, haven't we used this long description before? Oops! We have!
Right - what this text is about cannot be described, it must be read.

484: "Of fear" by Nadene Wiggins.  Some fear roses, some fear violets.
Some poems rhyme, but this does not. Make yourself ready to dive down
and explore fear as it is presented in this short poem. Recommended even
for the faint of heart.

485: "The Anatomy Of Hate (Revised)" by The GNN.  People love, people
hate - and people change! This is the second version of a text that was
originally written seven years ago. If you want to know if the author has
changed, contrast the two texts. Surprised?

486: "Riding The 5:15" by BJ Moore.  Taking a bus ride can change your
life, but it can also change the lives of other people. And you need not
even be aware of it. Believe it or not. This is a piece of poetry that
examines that possibility.

487: "A Dish Served Very Cold" by Kevin James Miller.  Welcome to a tale
that is really, really, really, really tiny! (Less than sixty words, in
fact). It is about a dish served very cold. Much more cannot be said, or
this long description will be longer than the file...

488: "Eight Poems" by Robert James Berry.  Our man from the Far East
is back again, tickling our emotional senses with aesthetic values and
professionalism. Mr. Berry knows how to write poetry. If you do not like
this - there is something seriously wrong with you.

489: "A Conspiracy Of One" by Kevin James Miller.  Yep, here's another
really, really, really, tiny tale. This one is about a conspiracy of one,
as the title reveals. Kevin James Miller manages in fifty-five words to
capture what the writers of The X-Files needs sixty minutes and a load of
bullshit to miss.

490: "Mendoza's Jelly Problems" by Max West.  Mendoza is on a mission, a
bizarre one indeed. To do what he gotta do (the 'ard 'n cool man he is),
he speeds down the highway in his car - which runs on hard drugs. Enough
said. "Max West... is an acute and stylish writer, in fact the only one
who deserves to be called 'writer' this century." (uXu)

491: "The Machinery of Desire" by The GNN.  Would you give up your real
life in favor of a faked one? Oh, no? But what if your real life is a
total misery, and a faked life would be extremely cheerful? Say what? You
still wouldn't choose it? This text is about a guy who is given the
opportunity of entering a machine which will give him such a life. What
will he do?

492: "Smoke" by Mobys Dick.  Life is often said to be a gift, but if one
got the chance of inspecting the present before one received it, I am not
sure one would accept it (Schopenhauer said this). Because life is filled
with so many complicated relations, and the be or not to be of love is
always a cause of anxiety, as this text is about - to a certain extent.

493: "States Of Confusion: Reply To Critics" by The GNN.  Oh dear, GNN
must always to prove himself right, no matter which absurd theories he comes
up with. Do you honestly believe that doing drugs on a regular basis can be
equally good as delightful family life? Or that they could be equally bad,
in relation to "the good life." What the writer of this text believes is
as usual hopelessly obscure.

494: "The Lost Bar Fight" by Jay DeKalb.  Disclaimer: none of the writers
of the uXu have ever lost a bar fight. So do please don't push us. Oh,
sorry, we almost forgot: this is a piece of poetry, worth learning by heart.
   drip   drip   suspending

495: "Zula Betula" by Cindy.  A poem a day keeps the doctor away! Medical
research at Bristol University indicates that poetry reading is as good a
cure for depression as pills. (No, we are not making this up.) Initiate
your new happy life with this file.

496: "True Robot" by The GNN.  Beware! There is a new computer virus
around! And it is mean! Oh, don't worry! Your six gigabyte HD crammed
with porn is not in danger. Nevertheless, keep your hands away from two
specific keys on the keyboard...

497: "Nothing Comes From Nothing" by Absolute Zero.  So you think you
can change the world. Ha! Think again. Stop saving those trees. Start
your graduation in the class of ignorance. Here is an introduction
for you beginners out there.

498: "uXu Index #33" by Bravemoore.  The latest English and Swedish
files are mentioned here, as well as an update on where you can get
the complete works of the uXu. Read the index. Read the index. You
are now in my control.

           [#498 also includes an index of the latest uXu-S series]
