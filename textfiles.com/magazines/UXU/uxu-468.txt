Instant Witness
by Bravemoore


THE DUCTPRO COMPANY

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Columbus, Ohio. To meet popular demand, the DuctPro Company have 
decided to distribute their product prototype Instant Witness.

The Instant Witness gained alot of attention from the murder trial of
famous actor Ben Love. The district attorney's main witness, Robert Green,
who was introduced at the end of the two month trial, put an end to any
jury doubt whether Ben Love was guilty or not of the murder of his wife
Helen and her alleged lover Oswald Rhod. 

Two weeks prior to the hineous crime, Green had a prototype of the
Instant Witness installed, to try it out in everyday-life-situations.
Later, when the crime was just about to take place, Green just happened
to walk by the house of Mr and Mrs Love. Thanks to the Instant Witness,
Green was able to record everything that took place, and at the same time
it was an excellent record of what he himself did to prevent or limit what
he saw.

Mr Love was convicted for the two murders and was given two lifetime
sentences. Robert Green was convicted for not using his cellular phone nor
made any other attempt to get help and stop the crime that was in session.
He did not have to serve any time in prison, because he voluntarily came
forward and handed over the recording made with his Instant Witness.


COMMERCIAL ADVERTSMENT

The Instant Witness - "for the moments you know will come, and want to keep"
  The Instant Witness continuously records everything that happens to the
  user. High quality stereo audio and high resolution video, in a
  device no larger than a deck of cards.
  The shortest re-usage time-span is 24 hours, but may be longer depending
  on which quality the user has chosen. There are four quality levels;
  Quick, Normal, High and Certified Witness (CW). The latter is a so-called
  non-falsifiable mode, and is legally approved to use in any criminal or
  civil court, without closer examination than a check of the CW-recording
  to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.
  When using the Instant Witness, and you see something you'd like to
  view later, you can easily command the device to store the last ten
  seconds, half minute or anything ranging from five seconds to 24 hours.
  If you would like to have the option to store even more, additional
  memory may easily be added.

The Instant Witness comes in three different models, for all kinds of
purposes and occasions.

"Instant Witness SLIMM"(R) $200
   A very small camcorder you can keep in your shirt- och trouser pocket,
   and a wireless combined audio- and video sensor you put behind a
   button in your jacket or hide within your hair, moustashe or beard.
   The sensor is one inch long and 0.015 inch thick, and is as good as
   transparent. At least one end of the sensor must have a clear view
   in the direction in which recording is wanted.

"Instant Witness PRO"(R) $250
   Basically the same model as SLIMM. The PRO sensor may also be inserted
   under the skin (human/land animal) to further prevent it from
   detection.

"Instant Witness STEALTH"(R) $800
   The latest model which is attached to the outside of the (human) cranium,
   since it do not demand a clear view. STEALTH magnifies, translates and
   transmits the brain's signals when it is processing the audio and
   visual impressions. The information is recorded in a new type of bio-
   memory, which is made from a cell sample (skin/muscle/bone) of the user.
   The new memory cells along with the sensor are installed with a quick and
   easy surgical operation. It will not be detected by any traditional
   detection devices. If specifically searched for, the STEALTH sensor
   may be found however. The cell memory is practically impossible to tell
   from the user's normal tissue.
   
   This model is to date illegal in fourteen states. The DuctPro Company
   is fighting several legal battles in court for their right to sell this
   model in the remaining states. Contact The DuctPro Company for more
   information about your state's laws on this subject, and what you can
   do to help.
