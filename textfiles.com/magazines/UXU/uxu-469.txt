Stay

"Stay!" He cried. "I can't. without you."
I stared mesmerized.
I had never seen such beauty.
Six years into this marriage
I had just now seen his soul,
just now heard his heart.
I moved to him and cupped his face
his eyes welled with tears.
"Stay." He whispered.
"I love you."


Reality

I don't know who I am these days
I don't know right from wrong
The music sounds familiar
I can not place the song.
It seems I have just words
A message I must share
I'm too confused to write it out
Too depressed to care.
What has happened to my life?
Did I quit or lose the race?
I am filled with such despair.
I feel so out of place.
I seem lost to even me
Depressed beyond despair.
The road it seems has been too long
The load too much to bear.
I climbed inside my head
I kissed the world farewell.
Steeped in the flood of tears for years
My mind became my cell.
