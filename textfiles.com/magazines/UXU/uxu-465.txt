*   The intro. "Everything has already been said, but as no one
*               ever listens, we have to say it over and over again."
*                                                      (Andre Gidé)
*
*   The number three is special to me; I've got three testicles, only
*   three toes left on my right foot (hunting accident), we have writers
*   from three different continents in this release and I've lied three
*   times in this sentence alone.
*
*   The GNN summarizes his recent trip to the US: "The white trash of
*   Boston have no sense of style. It is actually true that Swedish women
*   are prettier. I left a secret in room four on the 17:th floor of the
*   Warren Towers." (If anyone finds out what this secret is, tell me
*   and I'll send you a prize / Bravemoore)
*
*   We've got eight brand new contributors for this release, telling
*   you all kinds of stories to keep your senses alert and your mind
*   clear, or? You be the judge...
*
*   We welcome Rich Logsdon, The Dwarf, drazQ, Lamont Prell, Janet Buck,
*   Noel Ace, Robert James Berry, Marie Kazalia and invite you - the
*   reader - to enjoy this release!
*
*   Last of all a small thanks/hi to yesOKAY for installing the bot
*   on IRC/EFNet #uxu.

July  October  July  October  July  October Releases 1998:

447: "Nicky And The Porn Queen" by Rich Logsdon.  Poor Nicky, not only
has his girlfriend made a career in the sex industry. No, she is a
nymphomaniac too, and temptations are everywhere. Life can be hard, but
let me assure you that some problems in life can more easily be solved
when you are unable to die.

448: "Help" by The Dwarf.  Most times, you won't know they were here
until they're gone. They live among us and they are more common in
so-called wealthy countries. Some are spectacular, others try not to
draw so much attention to themselves. Who are these people? Read
this and you might know who we're talking about.

449: "Hacker Ethics" by drazQ.  No matter which underground community
you encounter, you will soon discover that they have some form of
'ethics' embodied in their activity. Hackers are known for notoriously
upholding certain rules of conduct. But are these 'ethical rules' really
worth anything at all, considering the notion of 'ethics' from a broader
perspective?

450: "Sphincter Hatch" by Max West.  This is an extract from a work in
progress. Welcome to the future, utopia. Here is everything possible;
here you can fulfil all of your wishes, dreams and desires. Santa Claus
on this matter is of course technology. But even the neatest garden has
a snake or two...

451: "The Mystery Of The Dead Fish" by The GNN.  Modern science has
the answer to all questions. Okay, not maybe the answer, but certainly
the true method. Okay, not maybe the true method, but at least one that
works. Okay, maybe not one that always work, but... ah, heck, consider
this file for a funny episode from the Dark Ages.

452: "Dream Bursts" by Lamont Prell.  Love hurts. Some people learn from
both their own and others mistakes and try not to repeat them in
sometimes pathetic attempts not to get hurt again. Which way have you
chosen? In either case, this will let you know you're not alone.

453: "So You Want To Be A Hacker?" by drazQ.  Who would not like to be
a hacker? Thanks to the media, the movie industry and ignorant publishers
who desperately look for a good story, being a 'hacker' nowadays is not
merely being a criminal nerd, but a sexy motherfucker who do electronic
magic with strange machines. Our latest writer on this matter is fed up
with this seemingly never-ending stereotypical load of bullshit.

454: "Writhing Wisdom" by Janet Buck.  Lovers of poetry are in for a
real treat in this thirty-first release of uXu! Here is yet another
collection of well-chosen words, sentences and concepts that certainly
will appeal to your aestethical sense. (If not, reconsider you ability
of appreciating true art.)

455: "After Keflavik" by The GNN.  Do you remember that alcoholic
courier we told you about in uXu file no. 434? As you might remember,
he ended up reading a card over and over again at an airport on
Iceland. Strange guy, strange card, indeed. If you wish to find out
what happened next, read this file.

456: "Strangers" by Noel Ace.  Two strangers at a bar - man, woman,
alcohol, alone. What are they searching for? What obligation do they
have to each other in a modern world of alienation and the fear of
getting too close to someone? This is a piece of flash fiction using 323
words to explore relationships.

457: "Death Is Not The End" by The GNN & Bravemoore.  Scientific
progress, medical science in particular, always has one good and one
ugly side. Will we care more about laws and order than compassion and
empathy tomorrow? We don't know yet, but we'll get back to you
when we do. Meanwhile, ponder this file.

458: "Mudfishes" by Robert James Berry.  Here are five beautiful
poems, submitted by our first writer from West Malaysia. If you
are feeling down, these calm and sweet texts from the far east will
get you back on track again.

459: "Erratic Sleep" by Marie Kazalia.  Beware, the poetry of Marie
Kazalia is rough, tough and uncompromising. Still a highly rewarding
and powerful experience. This file will not disappoint you, no matter
if you are into poetry or not.

460: "Inability - Operators Manual" by The GNN.  Now, here is the
manual you have looked for! In five easy steps, you will learn not
only how to do political work, but also how to perform it without
actually doing anything! Money back guarantee, thirty days trial
period, fits easily under your bed!

461: "Website Oblivion" by Max West.  The title is actually the
name of an upcoming website created by Max himself. No one knows what
those two have in common as of yet, but I promise you this: if
the site has only half the weird bizarreness of this file, I'd mail
it's URL to popesmailreader@fastlanetoheaven.va, hoping to score
some points for the afterlife. You've been warned.

462: "Teenage Killer Strikes Again" by The GNN.  Lock your doors!
Hide your women! Bring out the guns! The teenage killer is back, and
this time he is really mad! A mystery! Horrible deeds taking place
behind locked doors! A damsel... uh, no... 'something' in distress...
well, not really 'distress' either for that sake.

463: "Five Site Reviews" by Speed Devil Show.  We need no experts when
it comes to the Internet. We need idiots. Yes, we need complete morons.
We need amateurs. If you do not think so, keep dreaming for a better
tomorrow. The fools are here to stay. Here you will find proof.

464: "Epoque" by The GNN.  It is often said that history repeats
itself. This is not true. People do mistakes over and over again,
but seldom, if ever, exactly the same mistakes. Perhaps we are
sometimes too concentrated to not make the same mistakes, so that
we open up possibilities of doing other mistakes.

465: "uXu Index #31" by Bravemoore.  The point with this index that
comes with each release is to inform you of what's happening in
the world of the uXu.

       [#465 also includes an index of the latest uXu-S series]
