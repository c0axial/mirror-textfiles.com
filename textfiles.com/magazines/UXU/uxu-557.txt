back in New York

that whore hit me
right above
my right eye
(closed fist)
head spitting blood
on the white carpet
screaming YOU ASSHOLE
FUCK YOU AND YOUR GOD DAMN STORIES!
all my papers
thrown out the window
cutting the sky
on the way down
to the front lawn
children frozen in the street
listening
more screaming:
LEAVE... JUST LEAVE YOU . . . YOU
FUCKING ASSHOLE!
seeing all my stories -
white rectangles
on the green lawn-
I grabbed a towel
pressed it against my cut
and headed
for the door.

-----------------

at college/into canada

the canadian border-
pulled tight
as we drove under
the toll booth
paying our money
from the rusted out van
drinking
smoking
and
yelling WE'RE HERE!
WE'RE HERE!
then into
a chant of USA

how patriotic.

we hit all the "hot spots"
-bars
-clubs
-the social scenes,
and a few guys
met some girls
and went down
to the falls.
we watched Niagara
throw heaps of
black water
over the edge
into the river,
a loud thundering
shaking the dozens
watching.

amazing.

-----------------

forgetting black mosquitos


stayed at a hotel in Africa
no electricity
no bed
dirt floor
the manager spoke perfect
english
wore orange leather pants
and his whole room
was filled with sex toys.

do a lot of people stay here?

no, you are the first one in months. there
are too many mosquitos in this place.

mosquitos?

yes, they are everywhere in this damn place, and the
strange thing is that there are more damn mosquitos
in here, then in the jungle. I think you are too
young to be staying in a place like this by yourself.


I didn't sleep
on the dirt floor
the mosquitos were very bad
one bit my eye lid - another bit my cock
and I ended up in a corner of the room
trying to kill every one of them
until morning came.

sleep well?

no, the mosquitos got me.

they get everyone. sometimes it's better to stay in the jungle where
everything blends in. in these rooms they find you much easier.

-----------------

Midnight

The combination
Of those
Two sounds,
The rain hitting the fall leaves

And

The symphony on the old radio

Made me think,

"It's all very sad - the music, the nature - but both
are very beautiful,
and very true."

I listened.
I felt.
