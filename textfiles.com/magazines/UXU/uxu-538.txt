THE CHILDREN
BY: DIzzIE

And the children watch
And the children laugh

As their parents burn
As their parents melt

And the children sing
And the children dance

And the children die from the mustard gas
From the mustard gas out of Hitler's ass

And now the children are dead
And now the voices are gone

And the evil is fed
This is the greatest con

That we children are gone




THE STALKER

I bathe in the blood of your unborn child
The demon inside me has really gone wild

I blow up the Town Hall
And then go stalking at the local shopping mall

I find a target
Her name is Mrs.Margret

I follow her to the shoe department
And then I go to her apartment

I hit her with a baseball bat
And then I skin her little cat

I poke Mrs.Margret with poisoned darts
And I chop her into little parts

I put the pieces around the house
As I eat a juicy mouse

I hide in the attic
Because here comes Pattic

He is the son of Mrs.Margret
Now he is the new target

I creep behind him holding gasoline
Not to be confused with kerosene

Now he is on fire
And I have almost fulfilled my desire

Now Mr.Margret comes home
He sees his family dead in his home

He silently gets a knife and puts it to his throat
Then he lies in his blood, moaning like a goat

I bathe in the blood of his unborn child
The demon inside me has really gone wild




A VOICE

Stop the Insanity
Save the humanity

Assassinate the president
Never trust the government

We must fight and we must win
We must destroy all forces of sin

We will dominate the world
Farting chunks of dead green gold!

YEAH!




FAMILY VALUES

Your life sucks, so why don't you kill yourself?

Just get your daddies gun
and get ready to have some fun

Just point the gun at your head
and soon you'll be very dead

Then your brains will be all over the floor
And maybe even on the kitchen door

Your parents will be very sad
Well ain't that just too fucking bad?

And then your mom will stop screwing your dad
And that will make him even more sad

So he'll reach for the machete
And chop the bitch up like confetti

Then your dad will meet a whore
And he'll keep pushing her for more

But your dad wont have any more money
So she'll say "Goodbye Honey"

And that will make your daddy mad
And he'll do something very bad

He'll tie the whore to the bed
And fuck her until she's dead

Then he'll eat the cold dead whore
And then he'll probably drink some more

Then your daddy will go walking around the city
Looking for someone to share his pity

He'll meet your grandma on the street
And she'll dance to his funky beat

And then he'll tell her to suck his dick
But she'll say her heart belongs to a hobo named Rick

And then your daddy will get tired
Besides, he just got fired

And then your daddy will meet Bill
Who just seems to want to kill
So he'll push your daddy of a hill

And thus, this is the end of your shitty family




LAME-ASS PRICK
BY: DIzzIE (C)1999

You fucking piece of crap
You think you're all that, 'cus you listen to rap?

You're nothing but a fucking looser
Just another drunk old boozer

Now let me tell you something my friend
The game is over, this is the end

I got my gun here, it's an AK-47
Yup, the same one I used to rob the 7-11

I'll blast off your little wrinkled nuts
Then you'll probably barf up all your guts

I'll rip off your cock
And then I'll get a big-ass rock

And I'll drop it on your head
And you'll be shaking with dread

Thinking that you should have never fucked with me
You motherfucking wannabee

Oh yes, you're dead now, so you don't get to fuck the cow
Oh well, I guess that just means there's more milk for me! WEEE!
