*   Exclusive: Down a beer with uXu!
*
*   Boston, USA. August 10-16 1998. The World Congress of Philosophy takes
*   place. We have received word that our own The GNN will be there.
*   If you'd like to meet him in person (at your own risk), send an email to
*   him at - gnn@uxu.org - and give him detailed information of your
*   whereabouts during this congress. Check out http://www.bu.edu/wcp/ for
*   more info about this event.
*
*   There's been a bunch of changes with our mail services. From now on,
*   all subscribing/unsubscribing/back issues requests will go through
*   uxu.org. More on, we've tried to make things even easier for you to do
*   all the above mentioned things. See "The uXu Connection" at the end for
*   more information. 
*
*   We're back with another uXu compilation! Ten different writers give
*   you sixteen reasons to lean back and read this latest release.
*   Starring in this release are of course The GNN, but also Michael W Dean,
*   who's back with another glimpse into the life of a starving rock'n roll
*   artist. DisordeR couldn't give his already overworked fingers some rest,
*   and is back with no less than two texts. Back after some resting is
*   also Intoxicating with some spiritual thoughts.
*   We would also like to welcome James M Ramone, Clown Manne,
*   Speed Devil Show, First Kid, Max West and their first files published
*   through the uXu.
*

April  July  April  July  April  July Releases 1998:

430: "Virginia is for Fighters" by Michael W Dean.  Our favorite
rock-n-roll writer from San Francisco is back with yet another episode
from his life in the fast lane. Prepare yourself for sex, drugs, sex,
a rock concert, and some more sex. Should preferably be read after
smashing a Fender Telecaster in a drunken rage, live on stage.

431: "Teenage Killer" by Bravemoore.  An evil man, dedicated to
fulfil one of the deadly sins! A damsel in distress! Horrible
actions taking place behind locked doors! A mystery! Yes, this file
got it all!

432: "To Kill Time" by The GNN.  Let me hear you say it, come on, let
me hear you say it! Say it! Oh, you do not fool me. I know you will
say it, today, tomorrow or next year. Some day, you will be pushed into
a corner and you desperately need to defend your lifestyle. You will
say it; you will explicitly kill time.

433: "Saving Johnny" by Max West.  Make your acquaintance with Jake, Al,
Roy and Frank; four youthful alcoholics on the road to St. Louis. Their
mission: to pull their pal Johnny away from the claws of an incredible
ugly woman. Drugs, rednecks, prostitutes and boozy common sense et cetera
naturally complicates things. No doubt, one of the best uXu files ever.

434: "The Strangest Things Happened In Keflavik" by The GNN.  Strange
things can happen when you watch television, wait for the bus, drink
beer, have sex, sit still, enter the sauna; and the strangest thing
happened to this writer at an airport far up in the north of Europe.

435: "George" by DisordeR.  History is nothing more than an array
of conflicts between secret societies, someone once said (unfortunately,
I cannot remember who). I truly believe this. On the other hand, the
conspiracy says I am paranoid. You want to be paranoid too? Study this
text and... what was that noise?

436: "Conceptual Clarification: Right" by The GNN.  The most popular
theory for wanna-be philosophers to put forward during parties and
coffee breaks is that the notion of 'right' has no meaning. Everything
is relative, blah blah blah. This file clears out some blurred concepts
on this confused matter.

437: "What Happened After" by James Michael Ramone.  This is an excerpt
from a work in progress. A surreal tale (to say the least) - an
stimulating mixture of poetry and prose; starring Robespierre, among
others. The proof-readers of uXu nowadays chant 'Foutre la Salaud!' all
day long.

438: "Brief Note to Headquarters" by The GNN.  The most popular
theory for wanna-be philosophers to put forward during parties and coffee
breaks is that man is an egoist, seeking her own pleasure above all
other virtues. Now, this is of course not correct. Man seeks knowledge.
Humanity seeks knowledge. What could it cost us? Find out now.

439: "Intruder Alert 1991-93" by Clown Manne.  In our day and age,
it is an art to shock people. Many give their best shot (hey, we ought
to know, we have tried for almost seven years!) but most of them fail.
Anal Intruders, on the other hand, succeeded. Read all about it.

440: "Black and White" by DisordeR.  To say that different individuals
'see' things differently is nothing new. True as it is, the statement
often turns into an empty cliche, as it really says nothing. Disorder
will take you to the other level of the game, he will explain to you
what it means to actually have your retina stimulated in an unusual
manner.

441: "Screenplay: The Terrorists" by The GNN.  Actually, this file
is nothing more than a variation of a theme - a theme you could read
in uXu file no. 423. But if you do not like short stories and prefer
silverscreen editions instead, consider this version.

442: "First File" by First Kid.  Thanks to our reproductive members,
the crew known as Underground eXperts United will live forever. Here
is the proof. We assure: you have never have never ever read a file
like this one before; and it is sure open to a wide variety of
interpretations.

443: "Forbidden File" by The GNN.  Do not read this description. Do
not download this textfile. Do not read this textfile. Do not spread
this textfile. Do not sue us.

444: "Modern Metaphor" by Speed Devil Show.  The masses constatly revise
their language so that the most obvious truths become false, the bluntest
lies the enlightenment of tomorrow. What exactly is the 'world wide web',
and what is it really not? Here you will find a pedagogical answer.

445: "Standing Before God" by Intoxicating.  How far will you go, being
an atheist and all? What will it take to make you convert? Will you ever?
Could you really tell 'God' from a bum? Could God tell you from one?
While you're thinking, read this file.

446: "uXu Index #30" by Bravemoore.  This index, like the ones before,
contains information about the uXu, how to get in touch with us and a brief
introduction to this release. You'll also find a list of the current uXu
writers and uXu dist sites. Check it out and find out what all the fuzz
is about.

       [#446 also includes an index of the latest uXu-S series]
