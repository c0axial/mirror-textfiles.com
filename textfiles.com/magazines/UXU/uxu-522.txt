The Investigator's Problem
by Bravemoore


It looked just like your average suburban homicide, until the first lab
report arrived.

The woman was found dead in her own apartment. Judging from the blue lines
around her neck, she had been strangled with a cord, rope or similar. No
obvious signs of struggle, but the whole place had been turned inside out.
Clothes, furniture, home appliances and newspapers lay scattered in every
room. This had though been done after or during the murder, according to the
witness reports.



                          BomDNA Inc. is proud to present the

                                             Also called "The Contaminator"

                          Note: No synthetic DNA has been used in any of
                                these products, only samples from real
                                people, taken from real environments.




It had come to the attention of the police that a new company was selling a
brand new product, that was getting more and more used by criminals to hide
their tracks at various crime scenes.

Apart from other existing similar products, this company had gone through
great lengths to improve theirs. They used cheap imitations of state of the
art techniques to store biological samples without degrading and without the
the need to keep it in a sterile container.

Also, with these products there was no easy, if any, way to know which
DNA samples were planted and which were the ones from the perpetrator. Why?
The planted traces of human presence came from hospitals, hair dressers,
public toilets, subways, trains and many other places where a lot of
people use every day. Since it is possible to find DNA in very small
samples, the company's claim to have products which include traces from a
million people is sadly true.

The investigator shook his head and seriously thought about his choice of
career.
