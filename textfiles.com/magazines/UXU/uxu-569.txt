        BETWEEN THE SEXES

        There's this little kid down the stree,
        cute, maybe two, her mother always
        dressin' her like a doll.  Older kids
        come 'round all the time an' play too.
        Always some big scene ona porch.
        One day this boy, maybe three or four,
        stops by with his dad.  The kids play.
        I ain't got nothin' better to do so I watch.
        About ten minutes later, outa the blue,
        I mean there ain't no way to see it comin',
        the little girl whacks the boy ona head
        with a toy telephone, then she pinches
        his cheek an' tries to bite.  Jeez.
        I'm waitin' for the kid to lay her out,
        but he's a gentle soul an' just stands there
        like his feelin's hurt an' nothin' else.
        His ole man finally picks him up,
        takes him home.  I only hope
        he tells that kid to watch out, stay away,
        once them women get an early start,
        you ain't got no chance at all.



 WHAT AM I, A WEATHERMAN?

 It got so cold last night
 I thought I saw snow on the trees.
 It's the end of May fahcrissake!
 Ina morning I take a closer look,
 see it ain't nothin' but flowers
 dyin' on the dogwood tree.
 Just goes to show you
 what you see is what you feel
 an' it ain't necessarily real.

 Believe me, I could tell you stories 'bout that
 but you heard enough of them already.



        SO LONG

        There ain't no givin' up in me.
        No matter how I wanna lay down, let go
        I keep poppin' up, strokin' for shore.
        Talk about shipwreck, jeez,
        whales ain't seen so many.

        But today ain't a day to think about the dead.
        The sun's sharp, cuttin' clean shadows
        against the concrete stoops, telly poles, an' fences.
        The ole guy down the block is pumpin' Italian music
        out to the street where folks is strollin, smilin',
        some even wavin' to kids across the way.
        I give you there's a cold wind but winter
        she's gone to some other country.



 MY CAT FREDDIE KAT

 There's this gray tiger-stripe,
 left ona street, just a kitten.
 So I pick her up an' she squeaks
 real pitiful like an' I take her home.
 Make a space, buy food, litter, all that.
 She's not much on gratitude,
 but she's a good cat an' gives me space too.
 We go our own way much of the time.
 But in the evenin' when I'm feelin' easy
 an' in that rockin' chair, she hops on my lap,
 paws an' curls, then hums that sweet lullabye
 we both end up dozin' to.
 That's what I call good pussy.



        DREAMS YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT

        Damn night visitors struck again.
        This time my ex-wife was raped.
        Twice.  She tells me about it
        after we make love.  Jeez,
        I say, didn't you go to the hospital
        or nothin', maybe call the police?
        No, she says, I just came home to you.
        But, I says, why are you so calm
        an' only tellin' me after we do it?
        She shrugs.  I can't figure it out.
        I mean, I start to say somethin' but give up
        not knowin' what to think.
        She sighs.  I fumble in the dark for a cigarette
        knowin' there ain't been any ina house for 20 years.
        Maybe, she says, I want you to have what I caught
        so we could always be together.
