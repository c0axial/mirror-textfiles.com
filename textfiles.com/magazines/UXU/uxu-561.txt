False Confessions from a Fallen Angel
by Laura Aurora


Disobaying toughe

 What can I do
 when I lost my sense of time
 Where can I go
 when I'm fallen through the ground
 Where can I hide
 when my secret place has been discovered
 How can I tell you
 when my words are empty?


The opening night

 He raped me over the props
 I stared at a big mushroom with dots
 I was on soon; my dress was a mess
 My make up was smeared
 And you could tell I had cried.

 The play was funny, not supposed to be though
 I had the leading part
 A princess or so, with a prince or duke
 I knew all my lines perfectly
 And all the other girls envied me

 It was raining a lot that night
 I couldn't find my car keys
 I must have dropped them
 Maybe they're next to the mushroom now
 Or maybe the fake tree or stone

 I walked home in the rain
 I didn't bother to change my clothes
 The night was ruined anyway
 The lines were forgotten, the crowd had whispered
 Things I was supposed to know

 Shakespeare is no picnic when
 You are broken inside
 Or your dress has white stains of someone else,
 Your thighs hurt from being pushed to the sides
 And the hickey on your breast burns

 The girl I stayed with wasn't home that night
 I stood in the shower for quite some time
 Just for thinking about stuff, one, two, three
 Now what can I be?
 My career as an actress is over

 It was probably my fault
 That be the cutest guy ever raped me
 Among the props when I had the part as Ofelia
 And my dress right then was green and pink
 The mushroom must have been laughing at me

 He just had to do it on my opening night
 Couldn't wait a day or so to not resist me
 Or show his power or whatever
 It pisses me off anyway
 I can't play that part anymore now
 I hate that mushroom


Return of the lost maiden

 Returned from my trip ago
 just a few minutes ago
 My suitcase is still filled
 I'm wearing dirty clothes
 and I smell

 Here I am again
 Not quite as before
 I didn't go where I was supposed to
 Didn't bring the things I needed

 I needed you
 I needed to get away from you
 But here I am again
 Fighting to get loose
 Yes, here I am again
 Just the same as before


Darkness

 Don't be afraid of the dark
 the light's just resting
 For we cannot see the stars
 unless the darkness the surroundings is possesing
