Riding the 5:15      by BJ Moore

Riding the 5:15 with my sister
we sit in the upper deck
feet on the rail
Helen pulls two beers
from her cavernous bag
and stations slip by as we laugh

Harried commuter in stern grey suit
envies us our beers
cool & refreshing
symbols of happy times

Fireman freshly scrubbed
with his suit & protective boots in hand
eyes greedily our breasts
swaying with the train
and a fire of his own begins to stir.

While its our laughter & companionship
that the homeless woman strains to hear.
Her eyes squeezed tight to better see
herself with friends of old.

Old man, behind his paper
remembers his own youth
and ventures on this train
the ride then - not this limbo
but a small adventure like ours
not a lulling, rocking sense-dulling lapse
but a chance to laugh & share
viewing the world anew

And we unaware
how,  with our old boots up on the rail
sharing a ten ride pass
& cheap beers from a bag
talking gaily of sites we'll see
Have affected this car of traveler's on the train.
