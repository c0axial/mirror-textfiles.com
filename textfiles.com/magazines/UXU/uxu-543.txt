*   The intro.  One Nation under God has turned into
*                  One Nation under the influence of one drug;
*               Information, the drug of the Nation
*                  Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.
*                                           - Michael Franti (revised)
*
*
*   The uXu crew is getting older. We are no longer young and angry
*   teenagers looking for trouble on (and outside) computer networks
*   just for the sake of it. Nowadays, we shave every morning and go
*   to work. We raise children and pay income tax. We are not so sure
*   anymore of what is right and wrong, good and evil; the world has
*   presented itself in disturbingly bright resolution to be far more
*   complex than we could ever imagine as youngsters. But we are still
*   the underground experts. And we will be for many years to come.
*
*   But for now: sit down and relax. The future can wait. Laugh and
*   forget, love and remember. We got a truckload of texts this time,
*   on subjects ranging from a secret network of insurance fraud, a
*   short analyzis of the russian Brothers Karamazov to a big collection
*   of classic "old school" texts on the subject of analogue mischief,
*   fresh from the author's twisted mind - but in the same genre where
*   uXu took off about nine years ago. Nine years? Oh dear, we have
*   really had some time to breed ignorance and feed radiation with the
*   help of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. (If
*   you are interested in finding out what is counted as "old school"
*   in the t-file industry, investigate <http://mindsec.textfiles.com>.)
*
*   Debutantes in this release are Russel Hallberg Jr., Kenneth Pobo and
*   DIzzIE. Familiar names we got with us this time are The GNN, Eric
*   Chaet and Speed Devil Show.
*
*
*   Source of pleasure and pain is as usual <http://uXu.org>.
*
*
*                                         Marching on in March,
*                                           Bravemoore and The GNN

December  March  December  March  December  March  2000:

531: "Fatal Accident Liability Insurance Fraud" by Russell Hallberg Jr.
There are lots of conspiracies around, if we are to believe the paranoid
people. Contrary to the usual fairy tales expressed by these clinical
nuts, this text does not stem from the author's vivid imagination, but is
based upon facts. You will not like these facts. Are you American? Are you
married? Beware...

532: "The Coup" by Eric Chaet.  Let Eric Chaet take you to another time and
place: America back in the sixties. He will tell you about himself and his
life. You will not be disappointed. Sneak preview: "I was already 18 when
my first-ever date with a girl was cancelled because of the assassination
of the president..."

533: "Old School Collection" by DIzzIE.  In this big collection of
DIzzIE's files, we dive deep into the mind of almost half the textfile
writers back in the mid-80's to the beginning of the 90's. We got
scams, harmful stunts and much more.

534: "Viv's House" by Eric Chaet.  Starting out in an asylum but ending
somewhere else, this story is about hopes and dreams in a complex and
confusing world which relentlessly refuses to adjust itself to the desires
of its inhabitants. An anatomy of love - and madness.

535: "The Day Of The Speed Devil" by The GNN.  There are ways to turn the
tables against those bores who do not understand that reality is just a
crutch for people who cannot cope with drugs. All you need is a shoe box,
a telephone, and an ability to drop a load. You have no idea whatsoever
what I am talking about, right? Read this true story and find out.

536: "Child Molester And More Poetry" by Kenneth Pobo.  Kenneth brings
you his artistic view of the world, with the children in focus. How much
abuse can a child take? By abusing our kids, do we create next-generation
abusers? Are we creating monsters?

537: "The Shunned Consultant" by Eric Chaet.  (I fully believe that the
lives of most people would make good stories - if they were told by those
who actually know how tell a story. The author of this text can indeed tell
a story.) Based upon events in his own life, Eric Chaet explores the tension
between the things you want to do, and the things you just have to do, to
be able to do the things you want to do. Two words: hard labour.

538: "Poetry Collection" by DIzzIE.  Far from his last Old School-text,
this is not your average day Old School poetry. Or is it? I am not sure,
but watch out for the spicy vocabulary of our new writer. Not for the
easily offended, nor the beginner.

539: "Perpetual Masquerade" by The GNN.  Individuality and personality are
not things that are automatically given to us by nature. We are just given
some fundamental conditions, consciousness and free will, the rest is up to
ourselves. If you are too eager to become Someone, you might end up being
No One, as the unfortunate teller of this text.

540: "Dostoyevsky And The Brothers Karamazov" by Eric Chaet.  Dostoyevsky
was a man of great intellect whose fate it was to live, primarily, among
non-intellectuals, and to see through the errors and pretensions of the
prominent intellectuals (and wannabe intellectuals) of his time. Consider
this text for a brief introduction to one of the greatest writers and books
of all times.

541: "Transparent Ribbon Campaign" by The GNN.  Alleged campaigns for or
against something are not uncommon, so it is unlikely that this title will
raise any eyebrows. But this campaign is very different, we assure you! It
is the only one you will ever need to get involved in, now and forever.

542: "Lost And Found Years" by Speed Devil Show.  You will die. You will
die. You will die. You will die. You will die. You will die. You will die.
You will die. Sure, you do not deny that, but do you really understand what
that fact implies?

543: "uXu Index #36" by Bravemoore/GNN.  We are in ASCII here, we are in
ASCII on the web. It is all just a bunch of characters combined into
fascinating strings. Someone said the pen is mightier than the sword, but
I do not agree. Without a mind behind the hand which holds the pen, you got
nothing at all. Explore the minds of the writers, read this release or
sleepless nights will be your damnation. In other words, enjoy!
