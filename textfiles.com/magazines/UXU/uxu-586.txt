 tuchas offen tisch

    we were served raspberries peeking
    out atop our Sno Balls

    it was very difficult to resist
    laughing aloud



 mad about the something

    it is a piece of paper a document
    evidence of thought intention will
    what have you

    at the bottom there is a signature
    that is they have
    the bottom well-lined

    beyond this have well-learned
    something or other about this
    thing over here somewhere

   I would you'd have supposed
   sometime differently subject natch
   to this discourse on above or of us



 newsroom

    here you are
    and I have to ask myself exactly why
    but the message is wish you were elsewhere
    and then my atonement
    my gags
    and the crimson-filled congregation
    where girls read Posh and Flirt
    and learn to hump dick
    why there is I have to myself wonder why
    to save itself the world creeping madly
    up the around down the staircase
    wondering myself
    what there is all for
    and asking myself if I can ask myself



 moral turpitude

    if I come to save the ocean
    myself besides
    it is to come here and ask yourself
    for my forgiveness it is to ask myself
    on the other hand if I were to ask myself
    and it is such another questions
    and still others
    with a great steaming pile of such turds
    and the moral message questions is
    is any such besides myself free?



 the average bureaucrat

    in the rogue state or any nation like this one
    or unlike he is there doubtless unlikely there
    sucks teat wonders about maybe fire or hire
    vainless jokes abstracted from vanless desires



 city pol

    ah patience is my virtue it is my glorious thing
    if I can remember it is my thing if I do my recall
    this if anything

    have a danish & coffee sit back see if my recall
    can worry my about-face thing
    you know my ass
