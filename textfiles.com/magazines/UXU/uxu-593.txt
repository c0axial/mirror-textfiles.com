*   The Intro.                  Following the rules
*                                       is the easy part
*                               Motivating oneself why
*                                       might be impossible
*                                              (Unknown)
*
*
*   This year is a like any other year, except for the fact that
*   this autumn, the uXu celebrates its tenth year as an electronic
*   publication. Ten years of ASCII - that fact alone makes us very
*   proud. We have not changed much over the years, as a concept.
*   The contents have varied though, as our faithful readers have
*   noticed. Some say we have been turning more "serious" as time has
*   passed. In some respect, perhaps you are right - but we only
*   publish what we get submitted and/or write ourselves. Perhaps our
*   readers have become more serious?
*
*   This release is filled with both authors new to the uXu and
*   experienced uXu contributors. Take your time and get to know the
*   authors by what they write. In this pack of files we get
*   frightening news revealed to us, a taste of Eden, two book
*   reviews, standard and unusal poetry, weird ways to create text
*   files, dancing at different times of the day, and much more.
*
*   We welcome our new contributors: Ralph Singleton Jr, Freon,
*   Dr R.K. Singh and Christopher Mulrooney. Welcome back Eric Chaet,
*   Simon Mol, DIzzIE and the interesting combination Bravemoore,
*   The GNN and Hedge.
*
*                                  Early summer greetings from Sweden

December  May  December  May  December  May Releases 2001:

577: "United States Reserve Insurance Fraud" by Ralph Singleton Jr.  We do
not know who has written this text, as it was submitted to uXu anonymously.
Even worse, we do not know if the conspiracy it describes is a fact or
fiction. We take comfort merely in the hope that this intrigue is not for
real; or, if it is, it has nothing corresponding to it in Sweden, at least
not yet. Scary stuff, prepare for paranoia.

578: "Green Leaves & Yellow Flowers" by Eric Chaet.  This is the lyrics
of a song Chaet wrote alongside an American highway a quarter of a decade
ago. If you fancy it, feel free to make up your own music and record it
all you like. But please credit the author, and let him know about it...

579: "Eden" by Freon.  The short time we have on earth is not easy to
administer. We want to know what to do, how to understand what has been,
what is, and what will be; but also how to pass on our insights to our
children. But if "the first word i speak will destroy my understanding",
what should we do? Well, we must find other paths to walk, as expressed
in this fine piece of poetry.

580: "Charlie's Exile Blues" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  When younger, Simon and
Charlie knew each other very well. But circumstances separated them. Almost
a decade later they came across each other again, in another part of the
world. They were now adults, and had both experienced a lot. This is a text
about that encounter, but also how it is to be a refugee in Europe.

581: "Little Johny" by DIzzIE.  This is a lovely collection of short
rhymes, beautifully expressed in a charming poetic language. Ha ha. Just
kidding. These rhymes are extremely violent, vulgar and tasteless; they
constitute yet another proof of Dizzie's clinical insanity. (We thank
the author for keeping uXu away from being too serious.)

582: "Review of 'One World, Ready or Not'" by Eric Chaet.  William Greider
is the best living journalist in English, as far as Chaet knows. He is
current, understands history, makes it his business to comprehend as many
factors as possible, including financial. Unlike most of his journalistic
colleagues in English, he has at the same time a comprehensive grasp of
the global situation and a conscience.

583: "Listen!" by Freon.  The sword of Damocles dangle over our heads. It
will drop any second, unless we take action. So why do we not? Because we
have also put ourselves in a strait-jacket of paradoxical Necessity; what
we need to live are the same things that will end our lives, sooner or
later. Can we free ourselves and cut down the sword? Maybe if we actually
listen. Listen!

584: "Gothenburg City 2001" by Bravemoore/The GNN/Hedge.  Now and then,
the Swedish division of the uXu crew actually meet outside the digital
world. This file is the outcome of such a gathering. At first glance, it
might look like nothing special; but one part of it actually proves the
rejected hypothesis that it is possible to write a textfile when you are
dead drunk and sound asleep on the floor.

585: "The Sea" by Freon.  Oh, what a lovely text this is. Freon has by
means of a sublime short story managed to capture the complicated issues
of loneliness and love. Love is like a disease, it takes a certain state
of mind for it to take. But if you are a loner, this state of mind might
never come around, no matter how much you crave to love and be loved.

586: "Tuchas Offen Tisch" by Christopher Mulrooney.  Poetry is the hardest
art of text to master. Anyone can type, many can write prose, but only a
few are able to combine a few selected words so perfect that it turns into
an overwhelming totality. The uXu debutant Mulrooney is one of these few
good poets, here giving you six of his works.

587: "Two Haikus and One Poem" by R.K. Singh.  We are happy to welcome
our first writer from India, Doctor Singh from the Indian School of Mines
in Dhanbad. As the very title reveals, this text contains two haikus and
one poem. We are certain none of them will disappoint you.

588: "The Midnight Dance At Noon" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  Love is powerful,
but so is religion and tradition. And when the respective interests of such
super-powers collide, anything could happen - and it is not always for the
best. This is a short story (with a parapsychological introduction) about
strong but impossible love, and the quest for breaking free without losing
one's identity, situated in contemporary Africa. Highly recommended.

589: "Review of 'The Crisis of Global Capitalism'" by Eric Chaet.  Chaet
here reviews a brilliant book written by one of the world's most powerful
financiers. The book suggests that it might be wise not to get too used to
current economic conditions, developing the concept of 'reflexivity', and
talking about the 'open society' and more than one threat to it.

590: "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" by DIzzIE.  Oh dear. Dizzie has
turned this classic piece of poetry dealing with the joys of Christmas
into a hellish nightmare. You should not read this text if you are of
the sensitive type. When we think about it, no one should actually read
this text. Stay away from it if you wish to remain sane.

591: "The Spirit of Wigilia" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  Christmas is the time
for being with your nearest and dearest. But if you are far away from home
and cannot return, the season can indeed be quite lonely. Simon, "the fourth
unwise pilgrim", here tells the story about how he was invited and "went
with nothing" to a Christmas party in Warzaw, learned about the spirit of
Wigilia, and "returned with a pen and paper to write this for you".

592: "I'm Trying" by Eric Chaet.  This poem is in a form that some would
refuse to call a poem. Chaet tries to synthesize apparent opposites, in
order to get a grip, and get on with his business of changing the world
forever for better. Overly pretentious? Not at all. Admirable, rather.

593: "uXu Index #39" by Bravemoore.  Yet another long period of time has
passed. Five months of people asking when the next release is due...
We have been spending hours, braincells and money on our upcoming
celebration. The release is finished now however, you are reading it this
very moment. Nothing more to read here, get on with reading the new files!
