                         BRIEF NOTE TO HEADQUARTERS
                            by THE GNN/DCS/uXu


transmission ready:from ELITE5:
'we make the universe a better place':
brief note to headquarters:success again

   In accordance with the plan regarding the intellectual mopping up
   work of the entire universe, we arrived at the third globe from the
   star known as 1.33 at 89.89 holistic time. The third globe, for its
   intelligent inhabitants known as 'tellus:earth' (in 'solar:system'),
   is the only one which carries specienoid creatures in this area
   (homo sapiens:sapiens). Sapiens turned after scan analysis out to be
   biologically advanced in such a way that they passed the limit for
   transmutation (Good:Enough-2). Sapiens explicitly welcomed the idea
   of being biologically transmuted into a specienoid that could expand
   its mind and society faster than material nature ordinary allows,
   after being assured operation:secure, and that Sapiens would never
   reach the level of Intellectual:Elite alone, merely Good:Enough-4
   before solar:system:collapse. This opportunity, quote: "served
   their:wildest dreams". Transmutation began at 92.89 and finished 93.
   (Expected irrational side-effects (grief:anger:sadness) took place.
   As usual, the creatures did not like to have reproductive modules
   removed:offspring exterminated:eternal life. We expect the irrational
   side-effects in this case to wear off in less than one thousand
   earthly revolutions around star 1.33.) We expect them to reach level
   Intellectual:Elite in around one billion revolutions.
