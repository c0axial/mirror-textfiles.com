HELLO CHILDREN

 Hello Children!

 Would you like to die for me?
 Oh, don't be scared and run to Mommy!

 You really have no choice at all
 You can't climb over the wall

 And while you're trying
 You'll already be dying

 I own you!
 You dare not argue!

 NOW!
 Go slaughter mommy,
 The ugly, smelly cow
 Slice her up like fresh salami

 Murder, pillage, KILL THEM ALL!
 Laugh with me as you see them fall

 I shall rule, I am your king
 Do you hear that barking?

 Yes, the dogs, I have released
 They shall feast on the deceased

 Build an altar, unto the sky
 Here I shall sacrifice the living
 All the evil, the deceiving

 Now my children, come to me
 I shall lay my putrid slime in you
 I shall bathe you in my pee!
 And I shall create something shocking, something new!

 The demon rises, from your bosom
 Now she begins to blossom

 She has awaken!
 And the earth shall be retaken!

 Say "Hello" children
 Now say "Goodbye"



"A" IS IRRELEVANT

 I fling poo
 at the zoo
 Drunken monkeys
 Cussing Donkeys
 All want to masturbate with me

 Big Elephant
 Small infant
 Doesn't matter
 They'll make a good platter
 Put them in the microwave...

 Evil good guys are killing me
 Fuck! Not nowwwwww, I gotta Pee!
 STUPID PENGUIN!

 ...Once inside the dark blue ocean
 I rub myself with her sacred lotion
 swimming free
 I pee, pee, PEEEEEEE!

 Once that's done, I start to swim
 Feeling fat, or feeling slim..
 two dots, no! never more!

 OW! I hit myself on the clear glass wall!
 HELP ME! FOR, THERE IS NOWHERE TO FALL!

 Now my eyelids are pried open
 by the one inside our head

 and I see all the burning bullshit,
 the rotting corpses in the zoo!

 In THE cage we live,
 They plunder! (our imaginations, freedoms, ALL!)

 we surrender
 we are scared of the blender;

 slicer, dicer,
 BURN DOWN THE ZOO!



TO THE CHILDREN

 to the children:

 in the fields and streets you play,
 every god damn single day,

 until the sunlight disappeared,
 and, well, it never reappeared

 hated, beaten, we are feared
 well the light has disappeared

 in the darkness they are lost
 while we regroup, they pay the cost

 oh, little, little, little children,
 put all your toys away

 oh, little, little, little children,
 look! it's a rainy day

 we must all come together,
 Sarah, Bobby, Sue, and Heather

 all our minds have been corrupted
 childhood innocence destructed
 and imagination
 replaced by thoughtless alienation
 fascination with thought control
 happiness with termination

 they will kill us all,
 one by one we will begin to fall

 falling in the deep blue ocean, with a gun wound in your chest
 falling in the deep blue ocean, made with tears from our forced rest

 crying in the deep blue ocean
 dying for our strength and devotion

 but we shall rise and they shall pay
 because today, little children, is a rainy day!

 so, burn down your schools,
 so, kill all the fools,

 slaughter your mommy
 and slaughter your daddy

 bring their dead bodies, into the ocean

 regain your strength and look around you
 to the other children, like yourself

 touch each other, and join hands
 fight together, destroy the bad

 kill the grownups
 kill the evil

 live in peace and haaaaaaarmony

 they have stolen our production
 and replaced it with destruction
 and now we shall go and we fight until the corruption,
 has fallen away and sha-tt-ered

 but it is no use now,
 for while we triumph we fall and falter
 and they shall seize us once again

 into the deep blue ocean, we fall,
 and,
 die again



RIDE THE FREAK SHOW!

 In 1649 Dr.Zerobov was accused of multiple accounts of murder,
 conspiracy, kidnapping, and other naughty things. Many people
 have disappeared. Many people have died. Dr.Zerobov's whereabouts
 are unknown.

 Open the door!
 oh-oh there is no floor!
 right away you fall into the midst of all the gore!

 meet the evil clowns with sagging breasts,
 the drunken monkeys with bumps in their chests!

 the sadistic mother...who eats her babies LIVE!
 and the killer bees from her vagina....the bee hive!

 Don't forget lil' Peter Rooster, the boy's got a trick for you,
 he'll scrape your insides out, and bathe you in his chunky mushroom-
 flavoured spew!

 and as you step through all the corpses,
 and as you walk through all the rot,
 as you see the little children, all long dead,
 with their heads torn off
 as you crawl through all the feces your civilization has shitted on us,
 as you reach our magnificent altar,
 where we cut young pieces of meat,
 where we sing and we dance, and we paint all with blood,
 blood from YOUR evil children,
 blood from your evil pod!

 as you see how we live, as you see how we are
 as you open your eyes and you take a look
 your sanity abandons you,
 a blank naked book

 and all the children keep crying
 and their mommies keep laughing, pissing
 tearing, scratching and crawling on you!

 as you come up the steps, and you knock on my door
 you collapse to the floor
 and I smile, and give you my hand
 "It is all right, you are with us now,
 you ride the freak show."



WHEN IT IS NIGHT...

 du-de-du
 du-de-du

 la-la-la
 la-la-la

 Pretty flowers and butterflies
 and all the glitter in your eyes

 Singing, dancing, smiling, happy
 you're so empty, you're so crappy

 Talking about such delightful things:
 the coolest movie, the best CD
 the clothes you want, what car you drive...

 AND asking questions too?!:
 Who are you going out with?
 Ooh, did you see THAT movie?

 Walking, running, skipping, laughing
 ahh, the world, such a happy place....

 The gorgeous sun, that shines upon us
 all the great, great things, accepted without a fuss
 even special cream for your zit pus

 It is all so great, with so many people,
 all the same, all so joyous and gay!

 AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

 ALL FUCKING DAY I HAVE TO LIVE IN THAT ROT!
 ALL FUCKING DAY I HAVE TO INHALE THEIR FUCKING SNOT!
 ALL FUCKING DAY I'M FORCED TO LISTEN!
 ALL FUCKING DAY I WANT TO KILL!

 But when the day is finally over, I run away, I run real fast
 into my house and to the basement!
 I enter through the great black door.

 Inside I take off my fucking costume, the one I HAVE to wear outside
 Inside I dress myself in comfort, inside I get, and clean, my guns.
 Ah, smells like another night of slaughter, ah, don't worry, I'll kill
 your children first
 That way you can see me smile, a real smile, as I eat your little ones
 and while you're sitting there and crying,
 I'll be laughing,
 feasting on the tender meat
 aaaaaaaaaa, it feels so good to unzip your pants, and shit on all the
 people

 aaaaaaaaaaaa, I'll go to the next house now,
 hehe, there's a shitload of children here: Christmas Day at the orphanage!
 Lookey here, and lookey there, Santa takes a chainsaw out of his x-mas bag!
 VVVVVVVVVVVVVROOOOOOOM!
 tis' so freakin' funny! to hear the crying and the screams
 lots of blood and lots of gore,
 but what? I am not content? I CRAVE MORE CORPSES! MORE I WANT!

 and so, shoving pieces of juicy ass into my pockets, I take off, into
 the night.
 fuck, the damn red and blue lights are flashing
 and the little round officers are madly dashing,
 hehe, yesssssssssssssss, they're following me
 right into the booby-trapped......WOW-E! that little roasted piggy is
 burning up, reallly good, look at the others try to save him, ah too late
 now, I've got my machine gun. they're all dead.

 Now I creep into the house, where there is silence, the shitty kind.
 Where all is calm and all is silent, except for the kity's screams, heh,
 ever see a skinned kitty? they twitch in a really "special" kind of way...
 Ah, the family, AWAKE NOW!
 ...and of course me and my M16. Shoot them down as they come down the
 stairs, tumbling down...
 splat, zoik, pop, and crackle
 it feels kinda weird stomping on their empty heads.
 The brains and skulls feel real tingly, aghhhhhhhh erection, release!
 WHOPPEE!
 shake it all up in a kind of stew,
 and pour it all over you.

 Ah, tonight's festival is over, but tomorrow new weapons shall arrive,
 they shall keep spawning sanctuary: destruction, until all is gone, until
 there is no corruption.

 until they are all dead.
