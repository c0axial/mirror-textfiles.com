*   The Intro.                   This is the way the world ends
*                                Not with a bang but with a whimper.
*                                                   (T.S. Eliot)
*
*
*   Seriously speaking. What have we done to deserve all these good
*   texts from all these good people around the world? This we do not
*   know, and sometimes we actually think that they must have been
*   sent to the wrong magazine by mistake. After all, why the hell
*   would any sane writer like to publish their works through an
*   antique electronic magazine that still fancies ASCII (instead of
*   modern www-aestethics), never pays, and has the rather cryptic
*   name "Underground eXperts United"? This we do not know. But we
*   are really trying to find out.
*
*   Anyway...
*
*   Do not hesitate to investigate the delicate pieces of ASCII art
*   we offer you in this release, number thirty-eight. When finished,
*   you will know how it is to be a refugee, why you should not drink
*   the water, what the notion of 'natural capitalism' implies, how
*   to get rid of stress and maintain happiness, and much more. We
*   welcome seven new underground experts: Vasilis Afxentiou, Steven
*   Zeigler, Jason Gurley, Curwen and Shape, Josef Lisowsky and Doug
*   Tanoury.
*
*   Good news! The book "People I Met Hitchhiking On USA Highways" by
*   Eric Chaet (one of the greatest writers of the Underground eXperts
*   United) will be available January 2001. We know that this is an
*   excellent book, and we are not alone in thinking so.
*
*   "This is an attractive addition to that by now old and honourable
*   American literary genre, footloose and oddball people driving and
*   hitching across and around America, encountering every kind of
*   person. This traveller has no money, must pay his way doing the
*   kinds of work not often described in American writing."
*                                       (Doris Lessing)
*
*   More information: http://www.geocities.com/eric_chaet
*
*   We would also like to congratulate our writer Simon Moleke-Njie,
*   a political refugee from Ghana that finally has been given
*   permission to stay in Poland and travel freely. Come visit us
*   some day.
*
*   It is December. Simon says:
*
*      December is here again!
*      My body is heavy with the weight of a year...
*      My spirit though is light and ripe
*      With cislunar fruits;
*      Seasons' cup spill vernal wine,
*      Vestal virgins pledge their prime...
*      It's time to sigh -
*      Flap and fly with my wings of solitude.
*                                 (Simon Moleke-Njie)
*
*   The world has not yet come to an end. Pay <http://www.uXu.org/> a
*   visit before it is too late. We guarantee you that the words that
*   you will find there are not quiet and meaningless (as wind in dry
*   grass, or rat's feet over broken glass in our dry cellar).
*
*
*                                       We are the hollow men
*                                         We are the stuffed men
*
*                                    Season's greetings from Sweden
*                                              The GNN and Bravemoore

August  December  August  December  August  December Releases 2000:

559: "Don't Drink the Water" by Jason Gurley.  If you are that kind of
person who believe in all conspiracies, you certainly should not read
this text. Because then your paranoia will reach tremendous heights.
Why should we not drink the water? Read and find out. (Actually, we are
not certain if this is mere fiction. To be on the safe side, the uXu
crew only drinks Perrier nowadays.)

560: "Freedom" by Eric Chaet.  Such a big word, with so many different
meanings - most of them somewhat removed from actual fact. In this case,
the story of a hitchhiker who has achieved his immediate objective, but
has not yet returned to where he can rest. This is a beautiful story of
rain and lightning, of an escaped convict, of drivers who want to talk
about Jesus, and more.

561: "False Confessions from a Fallen Angel" by Laura Aurora.  We confess
that the poems which move us most are those that are very personal. The
poems of Laura Aurora are very personal, so they move us a lot. We are
certain that they will move you too, if you pay attention.

562: "How To Maintain Happiness And Relieve Stress" by DIzzIE.  Believe
it or not! Dizzie has proven himself able to write textfiles that are
NOT pragmatic manuals on violent anarchistic mayhem! In this file he
explains some basic techniques for staying happy and relieving stress.
Read a good book, have a cup of tea, trash a house... oh dear... Dizzie
will always be Dizzie.

563: "A Saga Of The African Child" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  Few would
deny that child labour is one of the worst crimes against humanity.
Few in the western world have however actually seen it with their own
eyes. But Simon Moleke-Njie have seen it all. This is his sad saga of
the exploited children in contemporary Africa.

564: "Review of 'Natural Capitalism'" by Eric Chaet.  Ecology is an
acute issue. Unfortunately, most people just speak about the importance
of saving nature without actually doing so. Action indeed talks louder
than words, but how take action if one does not know what to do? Eric
Chaet here reviews a book that aims to arm the reader with knowledge
that can be deduced into action on this matter.

565: "Hold On" by William Hockney.  The content of this file is perhaps
best described by help of a quote: "Woody Allen was right when someone
asked if he thought sex was dirty and he said 'if you do it right'. Sex
is not some sort of pristine, reverent ritual. You want reverent and
pristine, go to church." (Cynthia Heimel, "Sex Tips for Girls", 1983.)

566: "The Day All Words Lost Their Meaning" by The GNN.  The complete
works of this highly productive author for the uXu magazine exceeds two
megabytes in more than 250 files. But during the past six months he has
not been able to write a single text (except for this one). Why is that
so? The GNN himself do not think he knows the answer; but actually, he
does...

567: "DIzzIE Poetry" by DIzzIE.  This is a collection of intensely raw and
furious poetry. Dizzie dives deep into the darkest realms of his mind and
explores those horrible thoughts that occasionally strike all of us. We
strongly advice sensitive readers to stay away from this file.

568: "At A Trailer In The Woods" by Eric Chaet.  You set out to do what
everyone else considers impossible. Would it not be nice if you did not
have to confront them again until it was proven that you were right and
they were wrong? Unfortunately, it does not work that way, as we all
know. How to deal with it? That is the main question of this fine and
personal piece of fiction by Eric Chaet.

569: "Stashu Kapinski In A Family Way" by Joseph Lisowski.  Take off your
Armani suit if you really want to dig your teeth into Lisowski's poetry.
Observing life around him, life's questions are answered right before
his very eyes. Noticing the connection to the condition called daily life,
or bluntly: reality.

570: "From Warsaw To Room 134 At Debak" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  The
author is a political refugee from Ghana, currently living in Poland
where has been granted permission to stay. This is his autobiographical
journal, in which he shares his experiences from the especial "refugee
world". This is truly a very important textfile in this day and age.

571: "USA Election 2000" by Eric Chaet.  In order to have a real chance
of getting a majority of votes in the election for president of the USA,
it is necessary to be able to speak to large numbers of potential voters,
and to say to them what they would like to hear. So it is highly unlikely
that these ideas will be presented by someone, soon, who will then become
the president of the USA, and be in a position to at least get them'
seriously debated. But this will do for a start.

572: "Hesiod And The Muse" by Doug Tanoury.  Here Doug carefully lay it
all out to you. About art that is. A piece of art consists not only
of what meets the eye. There is a meaning, a point in it being created.
Finding that part out is the artist's contribution to the movement
the uXu's part of: Making people think.

573: "Forest Thump" by DIzzIE.  If you did not appreciate the hyped movie
with almost the same title, you will find this piece at least amusing,
which the original certainly was not. This version is not even depending
on actors pretending to be retarded.

574: "Ratt-Tat-Tatt" by Vasilis Afxentiou.  This text constitutes
undoubtedly the most aggressive attack on the American Way we have
ever read. If you thought that the NATO assault on Yugoslavia was
a 'humanitarian war', prepare yourself for a radically different
account on the matter. Utterly controversial, a badly needed
provocative text.

575: "Living In Hawaii" by Steven Zeigler.  Would we not all want to
live on Hawaii, the mysterious paradise island? The sun, the long
beaches, the long drinks, the long days, Magnum P.I. Could anyone not
love such a lovely place? Well, yes. The place is a shit hole, as the
author of this text is well aware of. If you plan to go there, remember
to keep your mouth shut...

576: "uXu Index #38" by The GNN.  Four long months have passed by, and
in time for the uXu and our writers' to give you a release crammed with
files from a bunch of new writers, along with some other you already
know, but now it is time for me to put an end to this very very long
sentence with the necessary period.
