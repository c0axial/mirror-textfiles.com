USA ELECTION 2000
(c) 2000 by Eric Chaet


If I thought I had a chance, and were running for (USA) national office,
November, 2000, the following would be my platform:


  1. Revise the tax and subsidy system's perverse incentives:

  -> more justice (for each CITIZEN, not this or that GROUP whose votes
     can be conveniently courted with promises of money for this or that
     advantage)

  -> alternative energies, less pollution

  -> REAL education (not test scores, not even necessarily schools,
     certainly not compulsory for youths) non-required but available
     (at any age, like public library):

     - basic skills: reading, writing, computing
     - basic knowledge base: natural laws, especially physical development,
       plus the rudiments of commerce - at least enough to avoid being
       outrageously taken advantage of
     - insightful history of humanity (context):  religion and philosophy
       (if this proves a sticking point, preventing all the other good
       reform, leave it out, like now);
     - introducing technologies of agriculture and other industries,
       commerce and professions (necessarily sketchy, but presented so that
       everyone KNOWS that it's sketchy, with a procedure for following up);
     - basic principles of ecology
     - non-core: foreign languages, electro-mechanical-electronic principles
       and techniques, arts, particular science techniques (e.g., use of
       microscope, calculus)

  -> health, not "health care," certainly not insurance, insuring access to
      a crazy system of frantically treating this or that symptom

  2. Apply the obligations of citizenship to corporations, holding
     particular executives accountable for what they do, in the name of
     shareholders or not

  3. Stop arousing enemies world-wide by insisting on USA's right to the
     lion's share of everything USA-based corporations and USA consumers
     value, and by supporting unjust regimes who cooperate with USA's
     insistence on that lion's share, mainly by obsequious and lucrative
     cooperation with corporations based in USA

  4. Get people out of jail whose "crimes" had no victims

  5. Tho it would no doubt be abused by many, legalize marijuana, i.e., end
     Prohibition thereof. What to do about cocaine and heroin, I don't know.
     But the CRIME should be, if you rob or otherwise injure someone, in
     order to get your drug. So the law doesn't have to be against
     possession, or even delivery - only against what you do to injure
     others, whether you are on drugs or not, or trying to get money for
     drugs or not. Then, it would be necessary to enforce laws, no
     favoritism. Corruption of the law would then become the worst crime.


Probably you have some ideas to add? I'd be glad to hear them.
