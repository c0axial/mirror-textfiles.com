*   The intro. "Nothing, nothing, nothing will happen.
*               Don't pay any attention to my parachute."

*   ...med poesi besvarar jag ert sladder... (C Vresvijk)
*
*
*   Hello all. I hope you had a nice and relaxing holiday, because we
*   are back with another release, not holding back on your hopefully
*   regular brain exercise.
*
*   Coming from an extremely rich family, I really do not care about
*   poor people. Poor people make me sick. Some say I do not have the
*   right to think this way, but I say I do. With what right does the
*   poor people take up so much space everywhere? This space could the
*   rich people use much better. If I just had some money, I would
*   make sure we had some more space.
*
*   Writers marching through the files this time are: Laurence Overmire,
*   Duane Locke and Eric Chaet. All brand new contributors, but they
*   are backed up with our regular staff: The GNN and myself.
*
*
*   Yes way http://uXu.org/ .
*
*
*                                         Between xmas and another year,
*                                            Bravemoore, uXu Editor
*   (anything)                                  mailto:editor@uxu.org

September  December  September  December  September  December  1999:

517: "Killers" by The GNN.  They are all around us. Most of them
(we sincerely hope) are nice and dedicated to their work. But some
of them are homicidal maniacs. Perhaps you will be the next victim.
Who are they?

518: "We The People & Mythical Advice" by Roz.  Here Roz gives us
two poems to interpret, contemplate, analyze, criticize and then
finally comment on. Some of us just enjoy them as they are. Step
on in to Roz's poetry corner.

519: "In The Western World" by Laurence Overmire.  Mr Overmire
present five poems from his collection. Not your everyday writer,
displaying both funny and disturbing texts, all typed with
the energy you expect from a dedicated poet.

520: "Aesthetics" by The GNN.  All living people have one thing
in common: their bodies. No body - no life. Is this finally going
to change with the help of technology? On the other hand, what
would be able to stop this from becoming commonplace? Not the ones
you would expect...

521: "Ionization" by Eric Chaet.  This is a story about a man who
hitchhikes around USA. His humble mission is to change not only
America but the whole world for the better forever. Based upon
true events - in a sense still going on. Fascinating reading.

522: "The Investigator's Problem" by Bravemoore.  Your genetic
code is unique and you cannot escape it. So why bother use gloves,
wipe the gun, wash the knife - when a single damn eyelash found at
the crime scene will be all the police needs to catch you? Until
now, that is. Now you can get away with murder. The uniqueness of
DNA is now your partner in violence...

523: "The Perfect Mechanical Clone" by The GNN.  Would it not be
nice to own a robot that is a perfect copy of you? Imagine! It
could go to work (instead of you), fight with your spouse (instead
of you), raise your children (instead of you). In short: do just
about everyting you do not want to do! But then... who are 'you'?

524: "Regarding My 'Signs'" by Eric Chaet.  Would You like to take
part in a global artistic project? It will not cost you anything
but time (and perhaps a photo and a letter, if you want to). Read
this text, then contact Eric Chaet. Staff members of the uXu have
already done so. (And we had lots of fun in Sweden and Finland.)

525: "End Of Noise" by Bravemoore.  You know how it is. You try
to get around. Live your life. But there are just too many people,
too many problems, too much to do, so little time, distress distress,
and all of this painfully framed in noise noise noise, I just can't
take it any more! KILL KILL KILL

526: "Worlds" by The GNN.  Virtual Reality. Actual Reality. Who can
really say which is which? If you are able to simulate actual reality,
does that mean we could all be living in a computer with a poor,
crash prone operating system just waiting to die and when it does,
take every living being with it... Where was I?

527: "Wild Orchid Moments" by Duane Locke.  Dr Locke serves us his
short/quick and sometimes traumatic poetry without mercy. If your
friends likes when you read them your own poetry, try these ones
on for size. Surprising icebreaker when the "quiet moment" arrives
when visiting your mother in law.

528: "Anatomy Of The Cynic" by The GNN.  Some people reveal and
analyze important and complex problems in our world with sound
arguments. Others just see their own nose and whine. Some people
are philosophers. Others are merely plain cynics. Cynics believe
they make the world a better place, but the truth is that they
just make it worse. Learn their anatomy; avoid them.

529: "BBspam v0.1" by The uXu.  We strongly recommend you to put
the software available through this file into use before it is too
late. Perhaps you are not already examined, monitored, controlled
and valued by certain forces. Perhaps you do not care. But oh! You
soon will! Believe us. Unless you do something. Quickly.

530: "uXu Index #35" by Bravemoore.  In the last index this year,
we give you what you expect to find here, such as: list of the
latest uXu files, how to contact the uXu crew, the URL to our
website and much, much more. Enjoy!

           [#530 also includes an index of the latest uXu-S series]
