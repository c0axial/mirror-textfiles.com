*   The intro. "The result of the survey showed,
*               that no user had a single bad thing
*               to say about the electric chair."
*
*   The spring has passed, so has the summer and we are now right
*   in the middle of a very hot autumn. Like the sun, the uXu brings
*   you interesting, fascinating and enlightening rays that fill your
*   entire being when properly exposed. But unlike our hot hydrogen
*   giant neighbor, there is no such thing as "too much uXu."
*
*   uXu Release numero thirty four is packed with poetry, fiction, a brief
*   celebration and a small chunk of true weirdness. The number of authors
*   is yet again massive. Defending the poetry in this release are
*   Uthana Faith, Mark Broomhall, Ivy Lou, Travis Ray Cole & Murphdog. They
*   are all brand new uXu authors. Welcome!
*
*   Stormavik, Gene-Michael Higney and Chieftain brings you more things
*   to think about. Welcome to you too!
*
*   People who has stuck around us for some time, tells you more about
*   their relationship with the uXu. Joseph, Hedge, Jericho/F.U.C.K.
*   and myself writes about how it all began.
*
*   The regular and semi-regular authors contributing to this release
*   are Max West (still in shape), Michael W Dean (still rockin') and of
*   course, our own The GNN (still here to make you cry).
*   
*   Much pleasure.

March  September  March  September  March  September  1999:

499: "Last Flight To Keflavik" by The GNN.  The courier is back again. This
last part of this triology(?) digs even deeper down into the mystery of the
voluntarily mute man at the airport of Keflavik/Iceland. Suspense, suspense.

500: "Just A Number" by The uXu Concept.  Five hundred files later, it is
about time to spend some quality reading remembering all the years that has
passed and all the things we have gone through. From being distributed
strictly on BBSes to almost exclusively an alive magazine on the web. Join
us for some good looks back in time. Do not miss what some of the authors
has to say about the Underground eXperts United.

501: "Tired" by Matt Broomhall.  You are sick of it all; the lies, the fake
smiles & your last paycheck just bounced. Instead of picking up the good old
.38 and go settle the score at work, why not write a few lines about it.
Learn from Matt.

502: "Happiness" by Chieftain.  This file is an uncompromising defence of
hedonistic utilitarianism, a classical ethical doctrine. According to
Chieftain, merely sensations of happiness bears the quality of intrinsic
value in this world. The only truly Right thing for us to do is to bring
out as much of this value as possible, wheter it be through acts, thoughts,
life-styles, and so on. Controversial... or true?

503: "Five The Younger" by Ivy Lou.  More poetry, but this one is for you
out there who are tired of all the love, all the warmth and all the
understanding. There must be more to life than that? Yep, there is. To get
into that low down mood, read ahead.

504: "Micro$haft" by Stormavik.  Is this huge company really that bad? Where
is the proof that its founder is the son of satan? I mean, there are
several more appropriate candidates than Willie to that title. You wanted
capitalism, here it is. Do not be such a cry baby just because one single
man now has the financial strength to buy almost any part of the world. The
same man is going to have the most angry children ever after he has given
away most of his fortune, so you should all pity him instead. More than you
are now.

505: "I Carry" by Murphdog.  A short glimpse into the life of the character
in this poem reveals buckets of sadness. At the bottom of each bucket
you can however see the easy recognizable reflection of hope. What the
hope consists of, is up to the reader. You know how to become one of them.

506: "A Reason Why We Do Not Learn From History" by The GNN.  The title
pretty much covers it all, so I will instead tell you that if you do have
some evidence of yourself having learned from history, send gnn@uxu.org
a mail with the details.

507: "Toes, Man!" by Max West.  When travelling around the world, you meet
a lot of strange people, but when you get back home, everything is back to
normal again. This is however not the case with Max West and his
adventures. He does not have to go far to be right in the middle of some
scenario straight out of a demented porno director's mind. Read and behold
the world as it is.

508: "The Change In The Computer Elite" by Stormavik.  Apathy is spreading,
but nobody cares. When certain layers of the computer culture consists of
just theorists, who will keep them up to date? There must always be people
around that actually perform, instead of becoming the armchair activist
who did nothing.

509: "While The Rest Of The World Is Asleep" by The GNN.  Give the poor
man some money, so he can buy some food for the day and perhaps find
somewhere to sleep tonight. Sometimes, no matter what good you do, it
turns out bad. Some cynics make this an art, though.

510: "To Stephen After the Storm" by Utahna Faith.  Longing for someone
can be fun, exciting, expectant or just terrible. They go away for a trip
far, far away. The postcards, letters and phonecalls do not sothe your
feelings. They amplify the pain of not having a physical person to hold,
whisper to nor look in the eyes. Agony. Come home.

511: "Peter Haynes International Operations" by The GNN.  Some people
you know by name, some by their face. Some people control practically
everything you do, everything that is around you and perhaps also what
you are. Mr Haynes is one of those people, read more about him, he
probably already knows about you.

512: "The Poetry Of Travis Ray Cole" by Travis Ray Cole.  The biggest
collection of poems from a single writer so far. In this file, Travis
presents nineteen (19) of his poems. They range from anything to
everything. If you choose well, you can pick a poem for every occasion.

513: "Jabberwalk With Me" by Michael W Dean.  Mr Dean sure put uXu's
"we publish anything" policy to the test with this weird piece of
text, which we had to put our cryptoanalysis team on to see if there
were any hidden messages. Making sense is for amateurs... the author
himself explains: "... this was done by running my writing thru bad
voice recognition software..."

514: "Diary Entry 8[15]99" by DisordeR.  Welcome to a day in the life
of a girl. Get to know her better, as well as Mr Shy, the jock and
what they did to make life a little lighter that very day... but
seriously, what does it take to make you change your idea of who/what
a certain person are?

515: "Are You A Closet Intellectual?" by Gene-Michael Higney.  It has
been a while since the last quiz, but here is one for you all. No
prizes to be won this time, not something we will mail you anyway.
What the heck am I jabbering about? Find the answer yourself,
read file UXU-1000000000 (presented in binary mode where available).

516: "uXu Index #34" by Bravemoore.  It has been a handful of months
since the previous index, but we are back with another release. Find
out e-mail addresses to the uXu staff, distribution sites, homepage
URLs and much much more. The index is your introduction to each
release, and this is how it is described.

           [#516 also includes an index of the latest uXu-S series]
