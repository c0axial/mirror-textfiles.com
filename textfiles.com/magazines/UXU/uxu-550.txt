Only an Angel
by Sevrin

Barefoot and dirty, I crawl across my bottle strewn bathroom floor. I lift
the lid on the toilet, and barely hang my head over in time to wretch up the
few ounces of bile that where left in my stomach.
   I drop back to the floor. My face lies in a puddle of some bad smelling,
yellowish liquid as I convulse and choke.
   I cry out.
   "Oooohhh! I swear, I'll never ever watch 'Friends' again!"
   Somehow I am able to muster enough strength to break the skin on my wrist
with my rusted out razor blade.
   The room spins. My blood pumps out across the tiles in a rhythmic spurt.
I smile, as the crimson crescendo of my life petters to a close. All is
black, and I see a light. I know what it is! The afterlife!
   "Here I come! Here I come!" I shout.
   I race toward the light and it grows so large it is all I can see.
   Then I run right into it. BANG!
   "Ow!" I thought.
  BANG BANG BANG
  I keep running into it.
  "What the fuck is going on?" I wonder.
  I look around me. I see angels everywhere. They all look like giant moths,
and they too are repeatedly crashing into the light. I fly back a few
hundred feet, and look at the light. Just as I suspected: a giant light
bulb. Everything was starting to make sense. I spin and fly off into the
darkness. I see another, more blue, light. I turn my attention to that, and
head straight for it. Suddenly, and invisible barrier blocks my forward
progress. BAM!
   "Ow!"
   BAM BAM BAM
   There is no way to get past this barrier. I settle down, and land upon
it, clinging to it. I peer toward the light, and my hunch is confirmed: a
giant television! I know now, beyond all shadow of a doubt that I have been
reincarnated as a moth.
   Clinging to the barrier, which can only be called a window, I peer into
the television, in hopes of entertainment. It comes back from commercial,
and "Friends" is on.
   I scream in agony.
   I spin away from the window and fly off into the night in search of a
spider's web to entangle my self in.
