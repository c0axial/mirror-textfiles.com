Eden
by Freon


        the sand falls through the air
        clear sparkling in a bright sun
        the surf rolls in and i feel as a bird
        riding on the updrafts
        the buffeting of the warm air
        on my wings my chest
        my soul

        and i am a man
        and i can feel these things
        and i can understand these things
        these things that i can never truly experience

        and the first word i speak will destroy my understanding
        and the first club i raise will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for a word
        no use for an utterance
        but a murmur of joy unclear undefined
        they know what i mean
        the things i love
        and they murmur with me
        and i can hear them
        just as they hear me
        the palms shade i use as my tool
        a gentle tool that brings me but pleasure
        and cool
        in the beautiful sun

        i lie on the beach and feel its love for me
        is the same for my love for it
        the sand against my skin
        cradles me like my mothers arms

        but the first cloth i wear will destroy my understanding
        the first clay pot will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for a cloth
        no use for a cover for my body
        but the skin that is part of me
        that i am a part of
        alive bronzed comfortable
        against whatever is inside of me
        be it flesh or bone or blood or spirit
        i am all and more pressed against it cannot add to me
        robes kill my spirit and my freedom
        i am alone and happy within myself
        and safe and happy with all my friends

        the old and wise
        the young and strong
        all so equally valued for just being alive
        by the others who show their appreciation
        by being alive themselves
        by being different and unique
        not trying to fit in
        with anything that is expected
        because nothing is expected but that they be themselves

        and the first man i strike will destroy my understanding
        the first war i wage will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for hostility
        but a friendly companionable jostling
        joking scuffles in the sand with friends
        competition demonstration of strength and skill
        but all in good will for this man i pin to the sand
        for my strength shall be used to defend him when needed
        and he knows
        and i know
        that we are not fighting but showing
        how well we will protect each other
        and how well we will protect our brothers

        when the time comes
        and we know it will come

        and the first God i beg for aid will destroy my understanding
        my first sacrifice unto Him will destroy the things i love

        there is no use for a God
        no use for an imaginary saviour
        as i lick the sweat from my goddess's breast
        and inside her
        inside her my eternal life will grow
        and be born to this world of a million different colours
        this world of a million different sounds
        a million different tastes
        a million different smells
        a million different emotions

        and not one name
        not one blasphemous sacreligious name or label or category
        to tear the meaning from the things i love themselves
        to rip my very heart out through my very mouth
        each time it falls open to emit
        another precise moronic utterance
        about the so called science that i would cling to
        if this understanding was gone

        but if this understanding was gone
        what would there be to teach my children
        what could i teach them that they did not already know
        that i was a failure
        a freak of nature
        destroyed by my own arrogance
        glorified by my words
        and numbers
        and ingenious inventions

        that reduce me to a grovelling vomiting wreck
        or a cripple before a television screen
        or a mass murderer of animals to feed my obsession with gore
        or a murderer of men with my clean and oiled gun

        see how it sparkles when in the sun my boy
        whose rays i have poisoned with my cleverness
        see how it bangs and we can hear the sound
        desensitised as our ears have become
        by the roaring of our own applause
        for our rotting selves

        see how it tears the flesh and shatters the bone
        of the bird or deer or fox whose understanding we envy so
        see how i clean it with my leather cloth
        ripped from the hide of a herbivore
        so much like myself
        but so different because it is convenient for me to think so

        while i smash its skull with a captive bolt pistol
        and wrench out brain tissue with a wire

        cut its throat and hang it by the feet
        wait for it to drain

        no

        without words i will teach my son
        and without words he will answer
        that he loves me in a way that words
        in their clumsy overgeneralising foolishness
        cannot hope to describe or replace
        but still try
        and i will not send my son
        to be instructed by men and women i have never met
        men and women i will never know
        and who will never know my son
        as my mate and i will always know him

        and i will not test my son
        to see that he has learned enough
        if he doesnt he will die
        that is the rule
        that he knows when he is born
        so he will learn

        and the first test i devise will destroy my understanding
        the first school i found will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for a test
        no use for an insubstantial measurement
        of this living breathing child
        this man like me that i have helped create
        this man who has helped without even trying
        to make me a man
        this man who is to me as i was to my father

        though i am old now and my father is gone
        and there are no moans and wails
        as we carry him to the cliffs
        no black stinking death machines
        no gilded shovel handles
        no self important ministers
        no preaching on a corpse
        no rebirth into eternal life
        no eternal bliss

        this is how it is
        this is how it has always been
        this is how it will always be


        no one need say it we all know
        and we lay him on the clifftop

        perhaps he will return
        not buried in a fatal grave
        if he is not dead he will return to scold us
        with gentle knocks around the head
        playful fistfuls of sand tossed carefully to avoid the eyes
        as he did when i was young
        and he was alive

        and we shall return and live
        on our beach by the sea
        in the sand and trees
        until we too are carried away
        to the clifftop where the bones grow white
        and the scavengers feed on our useless dead flesh
        before the grass and weeds claim all
        in time

        and the first medicine i mix will destroy my understanding
        and the first disease i cure will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for a medicine
        a destroyer of the meaning of illness
        a perverter of the course of life
        a product of sick experiments
        on other things i love
        just to sustain my existence
        perhaps
        another day
        or two

        and though my bones are brittle
        and though my legs are weak
        and though my heart does pain me
        and though my breathing rasps
        i am old and it is better
        at this time in my life
        to die from a disease
        than from a side effect

        and the first breath i took destroyed my understanding
        and the last breath i exhale will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for breath
        no use for another drawing of the air
        of this still green world
        this still beautful world
        this still unpoisoned world
        this still untainted world
        this still inhabited world
        where no man laughs when a friend is suffering
        where no man takes lives but to save his own
                or the lives of the ones he loves
        where no man travels far beyond his home in hope of plunder
        where no man enslaves another
        where no man pollutes anothers air or water
        where no man crashes through life with his raucous yelling
                of a salvation beyond
        where no man rots the minds of others with preaching
        where no man feels his mind rot from idleness
        where no sense is dulled

        no mind is unclear
        no heart is broken
        no body is tainted with drugs
        no teeth rot out from bad food
        no lungs rot out from bad air
        no livers rot out from bad water
        no lives rot from hateful thoughts
        because no words are spoken
        because no words are known

        and this is as it has always been
        as it is
        and as it will not always be

        and the first word i speak will destroy my understanding
        and the first book i write will destroy the things i love
        and there is no use for a word
        a meaningless broken metaphor
        for the feelings of my friends
        and their tears of joy and pain combined
        and their hopes and dreams and futures
        their loves and hates and lives and deaths
        as they lay me on the clifftop
        now that i have breathed my last
