TOP 10 REASONS WHY LIFE IS LIKE A BED OF ROSES
by: DIzzIE 2001


1) Lots of people are allergic to roses, leading to severe sneezing, teary
   eyes, runny noses, and in some more serious cases, prolonged exposure can
   result in death.

2) A rose has many thorns. Hence, a bed of roses has many many thorns.
   Unlike a bed of nails, the thorns are not distributed in a pattern so
   that you will feel no pain when you lay down on it, no no: a bed of roses
   has sporadically random thorns and hence when you lie down or even try to
   pick one up, you will always get pricked, and usually start bleeding. In
   more serious cases, the initial bleeding can expose you to more severe
   deceases, and once again this may result in death or to a lesser extent,
   possible amputation of the infected area (usually being the finger(s))

3) While the roses may look quite beautiful and even exquisite at first,
   they very soon begin to rot, loose their vibrant colors, as well as their
   intoxicating fragrance, and hence they become dried up brown looking
   pieces of shit that stink.

4) Roses are constantly being rooted from their home (the ground), and are
   either being taken to stores and are being sold (hence they are basically
   slaves), or they are taken home, separated from the other roses, or are
   kept in small bushels, but are still separated from all the other roses
   in the original bed, and are put in a small vase, where they are usually
   kept in water, not in soil as that is their natural habitat, and because
   we are talking about a bed of roses, not a bed of water lilies (which
   roses are not of course) the lifespan of the rose is drastically
   shortened.

5) A bed of roses has no purpose other than to serve higher beings. They
   exist, and are allowed to exist, because they produce gas(ses) that we
   need to survive. They are also pretty to look at. As soon as they loose
   those two qualities, or are replaced by more efficient ways to produce
   the two qualities, the bed of roses will quickly be annihilated.

6) While at first glance, a bed of roses may look pretty, a closer
   examination will reveal that many roses have a wide assortment of
   diseases that make their leaves shrivel and die, and the diseases spread
   to other roses... and soon the whole bed is a Petri dish for various
   bacterial cultures.

7) When you bend down to snort a rose, you may notice that there are ants
   crawling all over the stem and are rapidly crawling up your nose as you
   sniff. You may also notice that there are bees hiding in the roses. But
   of course, you notice that after the bees have already stung you. This
   may once again, in severe allergic occurrences, cause death.

8) In order for the roses to be planted where they were, other, less
   attractive (but perhaps more useful) plants had to be cleared out of the
   rose bed zone and either transported to another location, or more likely,
   they were simply tossed into the trashcan or the compost heap, all to
   make room for the bourgeoisie roses.

9) What where the aforementioned bees doing hiding in the roses in the first
   place? They were robbing the roses. Stealing the sweet nectar. Hence,
   roses are constantly being robbed of what they produce by the droid bees,
   who are, in turn, only serving the bee queen. Hence, the bee queen rules
   over all.

10) Roses are probably the most exploited flower ever. They are constantly
    being referenced to in poems, novels, etc... They are displayed on wall
    paper, on clothing, on shower curtains, on table clothes, on furniture,
    on advertisements, etc... Never have the roses consented to this
    exploitation, nor have they ever received any retribution, neither in
    the form of monetary compensation, nor in any other form.
