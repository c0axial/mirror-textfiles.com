*   The intro.     The Big Electron. It doesn't punish, it doesn't
*                  reward, it doesn't judge at all. It just is.
*                  And so are we. For a little while.
*                                          - George Carlin
*
*   Despite hours and hours and hours of thinking, the uXu crew was unable
*   to come up with anything intelligent to write in this introduction for
*   release thirty-seven. We stared at the computer screen until drops of
*   blood started to form on our foreheads.
*
*   Nevertheless, this release had to be put out. Something radical had to
*   be done. Therefore we hired Professor Common Sense from the University
*   of Customary Rationality to help us out. Professor Sense made the
*   following statement: "Dear readers of the Underground eXperts United
*   magazine (est. 1991). What the hell are you imbeciles doing? Reading is
*   a waste of time, words are a waste of space. The collection of concepts
*   accumulated by this insignificant irregular electronic publication will
*   not change anything in this world. Neither will you for that sake. You
*   are merely one out of six billion trivial human beings; i.e. you are
*   nothing, you are expendable. Leave progress of the human race in the
*   hands of faith (or at least those who know how to operate machines for
*   mass destruction). Do like everybody else: work, engage in sexual
*   activity, breed children, die. These are the only things you might have
*   a chance succeeding with in this gigantic world. Come on, be realistic.
*   Quit dreaming. Stop reading!"
*
*   Still here? All right. Then you might want to examine the fourteen arts
*   of .txt written by nine good people we offer you in this release. When
*   you are through, you will know how it is to be in jail in Ghana, what
*   kind of people you meet if you hitchhike in the USA, why you might be
*   killed in an highway accident any day now, what Chomsky and Mander says,
*   how afterlife could be for someone who hates certain popular television
*   shows, how poetry should be written, and much more.

March  August  March  August  March  August Releases 2000:

544: "Godfather Dad" by Russel Hallberg Jr.  This is a hazardous text. We do
not know if it is facts or fiction. But we have reasons to believe that the
previous file of this author (UXU-531) have had unexpected fatal effects. We
no longer know if Hallberg is our friend or foe. All we can advice you to do
is to keep away from highways and large trucks if you want to stay alive.

545: "Conveyor" by Eric Chaet.  This is a tale about a man working as a
laborer in a warehouse in the Upper Midwest of the USA, with a lot on his
mind (to say the least), a partner in northern Mexico - and a secret agenda!

546: "Yearning For A Fish And Gasoline" by Sevrin.  Poetry can be used to
get your point across. Sevrin takes a look around him and tell you through
this instrument what he is seeing. What is it? Read it! Comprende?

547: "Song Of A Bird Perched On A Rusty Gear" by Eric Chaet.  So you have
not been exactly been awarded the Nobel Prize for your efforts, and you are
at the very end of your resources. A contractor from whom you hitch a ride
gives you a less than ideal job as part of a crew re-organizing the storage
of tools in a factory, seventy-two hours a week. Are you going to live?

548: "We Did Not Whimsy" by Mark Phillips.  Death and dispair with a
Christian twist. If you like your poetry with a ancient feel to it, but
still something new to feast your eyes upon - this is what you have been
looking for.

549: "People I Met Hitchhiking From Minnesota To Nevada" by Eric Chaet.  A
true story about a light-hearted hitchhiker of a few thousand miles across
the USA. Eric Chaet shares his experiences of an angry police man, western
Americans and a French visitor. But what exactly is the ultimate aim of this
long ride? Read and find out.

550: "Only An Angel" by Sevrin.  "... the room spins, and my blood pumps out
across the tiles in a rhythmic spurt. I smile as the crimson crescendo of my
life petters to a close. All is black, and I see a light. I know what this
is! The afterlife!" (Ha! Get ready for a surprise!)

551: "Looking Back in Terror" by Simon Moleke-Njie.  Ending up in jail for
merely six weeks might not sound all that terrifying to us spoiled people in
the western world. But you will soon understand why the author of this text
have all reasons for looking back in terror when he recalls what happened
during six weeks after he had been apprehended at the airport in Ghana,
Africa. This is indeed a very important text, and the uXu feels honored to
have been selected for publishing it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

552: "Cripple Quota" by Bravemoore.  Defending the sanctity of human life is
intellectually easy: you just have to assume that human life has untouchable
value, period. Politically however, such a standpoint will inevitable have
practical consequences. This text explores a possible future in which
everyone must share responsible for all human life. Do you find it utopian?

553: "Collected What Nots" by Laura Aurora.  Laura is back, this time she is
doing her poetry in English. She gives you five new pieces, just for you and
absolutely nobody else. So feel privileged when you lean back and enjoy some
healthy emotional brain tickling.

554: "Manouvers Far From The Front" by Eric Chaet.  Once again, powerful and
important people are blowing up a lot of people far away. What if you have
managed not to be drafted to participate in such madness, but still it makes
you sad and approximately powerless? Why not visit a like-minded friend to
try to amuse your spirits?

555: "Old School Collection II" by DIzzIE.  The first collection of good old
school texts from this writer (UXU-533), turned out to be quite popular.
That fact made the uXu crew jump to the conclusion that we must immediately
put out yet another collection, to satisfy those of our readers that are
crazed sociopaths whom only want to read about mischief, terror and evil
madness. HERE YOU GO! TAKE SHELTER!

556: "Central Ideas In Books By Noam Chomsky & Jerry Mander" by Eric Chaet.
This must be one of the briefest introductions to books by two great thinkers
of the anti-establishment, Noam Chomsky and Jerry Mander. Chomsky and Mander
distrust what those who govern and what those who sell the glories of new
technologies say, and the results of what they do. Short but to-the-point.

557: "Back In New York" by Shane Jones.  Four fresh and raw pieces of poetry
for you. Shane will take you through New York, Canada, Africa. Prepare to
walk through blood and strange bars. There are some black mosquitos here
to visit you, by the way.

558: "uXu Index #37" by Bravemoore/GNN.  Come here folks, we got it all!
Big files, small files, funny files, depressing files. To find out which
file is what, feel free to thoroughly examine each one of the included
text items and decide for yourself.
