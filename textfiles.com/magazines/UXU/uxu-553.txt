Oh Darling

   You disconnected freak
   Pollution in my air
   Fresh now when you're gone
   - wasn't I left then?

   Happy shit comes through
   Blend mixed my mind
   What you're desperate to be
   - she'll make you

   You dumb asshole jerk
   Dragging me away,
   In my feather naked skin
   - have to make you stay ...

   Not hard to believe
   Looks all falls down
   I'm your baby
   I'm your queen
   - she's your dolly

   Love solves everything



Poem of the week

   My pregnant Monday burns my ears
   and how am I to go to the store today?
   My feet are swollen and my breasts have grown

   The hungry Tuesday comes so quickly
   I really don't have anything to wear you know
  it's too tight over my feminity

   Anyway, Wednesday seems pretty much ok
   I sure did it, didn't I?
   I shouldn't bother - I'm smiling in the bubbles of
   laughter

   It's Thursday
   I don't care

   My overthrown Friday smooches me with passion
   It's nice to dive under water and be caressed to death
   It's too late now isn't it?

   The comitment of Saturday is no misunderstanding
   Pling plong as in ping pong
   I can't recall the escape to home

   The harsh Sunday tickles me
   I undress myself and get a grip
   I deliver on the cold floor of stone

   Once again then

   My dead Monday
   The overeathen Tuesday
   Fragile Wednesday
   Important Thursday
   Shifting Friday
   Apathetic Saturday
   at last
   The soft Sunday

   I'm still waiting in line.



Personal possesions

   Don't I miss you
   As I miss the warm winds of May

   Don't I ache for you
   As for the genuine summer's day

   Can I only hold you but once
   Before I go

   My wish,
   Damn that wish which makes it so

   Precios irony
   Dearest regret
   My life rests
   In the hands of thee



The misjudgement of the sleeping beauty

   desperation
   tempetion

Dear Friends

   The crippled
   the naked
   the forgotten

   buried in floods of
   words of

   the bright
   the wonderful
   the amazing

   torn apart
   at the sight of

   the doomed
   the mistaken
   the frightend

   torted for lifetimes by

   the clever
   the imaginative
   the apprichiated

   all to be drowned in the dreams of their own
