				Hold On

Her breath came in short, hot puffs on his whiskered cheek as he pinched her
nipple between his thumb and forefinger. He could smell the smoke from the
bar in her hair. It was stale and limp. She eased her head onto his shoulder
and thrust her back into him. The heat from his sex rippled up her spine. It
stood rigid and alert against the small of her back. She turned her head
towards his, her mouth open, waiting for his tongue. He plunged it in. She
could taste celery salt and gum as she clamped her mouth around it.

	He continued to circle her nipple and, with his free hand, trailed a
line down her belly to her crotch. She spread her legs for him but he was
patient, in control. He brushed his fingertips around the flesh of her inner
thigh. Strands of rogue hair poked through her underwear. He ventured
further, tantalizing her with his fingers. He could feel the dampness
through the bleach-worn cotton. She groaned and arched her back, inviting
him in. He pulled the elastic band of her shorts as she undulated her body
out of them. She kicked them off with her ankle and they floated to the
floor like a waterlogged snowflake.

	They laughed together as he spun her around roughly, shaking her
shoulders playfully, her breasts held close to her body with taut skin. She
ran her fingers through the sparse hair on his chest and pulled him close
to her with a collected handful. He yelped before kissing her hard, their
teeth chipping against one another. She reached down between his legs and
held him fast, the heat of his skin cradled in her shifting grip. Pushing
her hand away, he eased her onto her back and looked at her in the half-
light. Her body stretched out before him. It was long and thin, her hips
rounding with soft pads of flesh. He ran his hand up her side the same way
a man might rub the polished surface of a car. Growing conscious of the
attention, she pulled him down to her and rolled onto her side. He followed,
their feet meshing together above the sheets.

	He started at her forehead, kissing her softly, slowly, on the
eyebrows and eyes. His fingertips skirted her hips and crotch. He kissed
her cheekbones, her lips individually, the slope of her neck and the bones
that rounded out above her breasts. His hands roamed her body and face. He
felt her balled calves. They were meaty and round. The hard bones of her
ankle stuck out like flesh-covered mountains. Her kissed her breasts
attentively, carefully. He kissed the skin beneath her breasts. It was salty
from sweat.

	He eased her onto her back, still kissing her while doing so. Her
hands went to his head, her fingers meeting through his hair. He continued
further down her stomach and thrust his tongue through the ring in her
navel. The metal was cool. He was careful not to pull on it too hard. He
eased it away from her body with the tip of his tongue. She pulled his hair
into tight balls. Tufts of black hair exploded through her clenched
fingers.

	He slid his chin down her stomach and rested it there on the coarse
hair of her crotch. He could smell her now. It was the musky smell of
anticipation. He lowered his face into the black tangle and inhaled her
deeply. Her legs opened slowly for him like a crypt. He darted and circled
his tongue slowly inside her. He bit her gently. He sucked and pulled on
her with his lips. Her body rose and fell with the tide until she could
take no more. She was close now and she wanted to orgasm with him inside
her. She clasped her hands underneath his armpits and drew him up to her.
He fumbled briefly with the condom he had at the ready before setting it
right. He too was ready.

	"I have to be on top," she said. "I can only cum when I'm no top."

	He flopped onto his back and she straddled him. She eased him into
her with her hand and began to rock on him with her hips. His hands went to
her breasts and he drew her down to him.

	"Fuck me," she cooed. "Fuck me."

	He could feel himself lose control. He tried with all his might to
stop it but couldn't. His release was quiet and without ceremony. She sat
up straight and felt him melt inside her. She began to grind her hips
harder, hoping to rescue him from the abyss.

	"Hold on," she said. "I'm close."

	There was nothing for him to hold on to. His erection died like an
apologetic sigh. She lifted herself off him.

	"It's okay, don't worry about it," she said, and rolled over and
away from him.

	He got up to leave.

	"Where are you going?"

	"Bathroom."

	He stumbled to the washroom, his soft dick still encased in its
ribbed tomb. The light in the bathroom was on to guide him. He stood over
the toilet, his cock limp and lifeless in his hand like a dead fish. He
peeled off the condom and dropped it into the water below. His dick was
wet. He brought his fingers to his nose and smelled them. He could smell
her. He could smell the latex. Together they reeked of defeat.
	
	He choked back the urge to urinate. Looking at his cock more
closely, he could see a see a single black hair sticking out of the eye of
his dick. It stuck out of him mockingly like a black tongue. He took a hold
of the offending hair and tried to thrust it all the way in. He couldn't so
he pulled it out as slowly as he possibly could. It wasn't painful but he
could feel it. He could feel something.
