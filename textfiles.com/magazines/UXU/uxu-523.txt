                          THE PERFECT MECHANICAL CLONE
                              by THE GNN/DCS/uXu


After I had woken up and recovered from the rather trying neural scan/clone,
I was led into the chief technicians sterile office where I found myself
sitting on a chair with my legs crossed.
   The result was astonishing. The robot looked just like me, moved like me,
talked like me. Every single detail of my external appearance had been
perfectly copied.
   But how about the inside?
   "Everything you know, the robot knows", explained the technician, and did
not attempt to hide the fact that he took great pride in his work. But then,
why should he? The robot was marvellous.
   "Which means that I... I mean 'he'... well, perhaps I ought to say 'it',
will be able to do everything I can do? He can do my work?
   "Without any problems. No one will ever know that a robot has taken your
place. Go fish. Relax. Do you know what the word 'robot' comes from? Russia.
It means worker. Slave. It has been designed to obey you."
   I went closer to my mechanical alter ego. It stayed put in the chair,
observing me.
   "Hello", I said carefully.
   "Greetings", it answered and waved its hand.
   "What's your name?"
   "The same as yours, of course."
   I touched its skin on the forehead. The robot did not seem to mind. It
was impossible to tell that this was a machine.
   "Fantastic!" I had to say. "Amazing! Incredible!"
   The technician nodded. The robot nodded. Everyone agreed.
   Then some strange thoughts popped into my mind. They were diffuse at
first, but I soon came to comprehend their meaning and turn them into an
enquiry on existentialism. What about the deepest things inside? Where they
also identical?
   I sincerely hoped that the robot would not be offended by my question.
   "Do you know that you are a machine?"
   No answer. The technician clapped his hands in joy. "You see!" he said.
"There it was! The ultimate proof I dare to say!"
   I did not understand.
   "Proof?"
   "That the robots we create are perfect clones! Nothing is missing!"
   I still did not get it. But I began to understand as I turned to the
technician and realized that he had not been talking to me. Just as I
grasped the whole situation, they switched me off.
