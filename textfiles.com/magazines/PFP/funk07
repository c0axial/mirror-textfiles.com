SENATE GIVES HEALTH CARE A BIG FAT COLOSTOMY


Washington (PETER FUNK PRESS)

              The US Senate's effort to implement health reform has
        ground down to a deadlock, and debate on the subject has ceased.
        Republican and Democratic Senators cannot come to agreement on
        anything about American health care with the exception of the
        Senate passing a bipartisan, nonbinding resolution which said,
        "Every American, if he or she lives long enough, will die .... 
        well, pound our senatorial puds."


              The Senate resolution passed 93-2 with the two dissenting
        votes coming from Sen. Ted Kennedy (Dem.) and Sen. Jesse Helms
        (Rep.). This seemed like a strange alliance, since the two men
        usually stand on opposite sides of the political spectrum. For
        instance, Kennedy would look at a theoretical glass half filled
        with water and say, "This scotch and water is half empty; it
        doesn't have any scotch in it; whereas, Helms would look at the
        same theoretical glass of water and say, "Look at this! The NEA
        has funded another piece of anti-Christian piece of art." 


              The five woman Senators abstained from the vote in protest
        to the words "pound our senatorial puds" in the resolution,
        although they said they would have voted for the resolution if
        the Senate had changed the objectionable words to something more
        gender neutral like wank our senatorial gadgets or canoodle our
        senatorial privates.


              Upon the passage of the Senate resolution, the debate over
        health care deteriorated into partisan bickering and soon members
        of the Senate stopped addressing each other during debates with
        complimentary terms such as:


             Will the fascinating, well-proportioned, dolce vita Senator
             from Rhode Island yield me some of his time so I can       
             respond to his bucko-jockstrap but, nevertheless, obtuse   
             argument, and will he give me a swig from that bottle of    
             bourbon he carries around in his pocket?

             Why certainly I'll give the incredible, funky and
             superfly Senator from Minnesota some of my time. [Takes
             a swig from his flask of bourbon and then gives the flask
             to the Senator] And sure, take a pop of my hooch, my
             toothsome, goomba-muchacha from Minnesota.


              As the debate fell into bitter partisanship, Senators
        addressed each other in this manner:


             Will the ribald, grody, second story man from Rhode Island
             yield me some of his worthless, pecuniary time? It will give 
             him the opportunity to swash down that bottle of limp wristed,
             weasel-piss inebriant he carries around in his back packet.
                 
             No, I will not yield my time to the fourflushing,
             lounge lizard, abomination from Minnesota. How can I
             libate my libation when he is always leeching my hooch.
             Besides, I'd rather share my liquor with a rattlesnake than
             the bovine lump of mendacious monkeydom from Minnesota.


              When the Senate decorum broke down, the ratings of C-Span's
        televised segments of the US Senate climbed twelve billion
        percent. The major networks, alarmed at C-Span's success,
        preempted their prime time programming with televised
        proceedings of the Senate health debate and preceded each
        broadcast with major TV anchors like Peter Jennings, Ted
        Baxter, Tarzan, and Larry the Wonder Opossum making an
        announcement something as this:


             Tonight we will broadcast the Senate debate on health care
             and hopefully the partisan bickering will become so intense 
             we will show you a Senator mowing down another Senator with
             an illegal assault weapon right on your screen LIVE!! 

             But first this commercial message from Harry and Louise,
             that wonderful couple whom the insurance companies paid
             millions of dollars to hate the Clinton plan and to say how
             much they hate it on national television. What a deal they
             got. Most Americans already hate the Clinton plan, and they
             don't get a dime for it. That's the greatness of our
             American free enterprise system.


              The partisan bickering resulted from each party's approach
        to health care. The Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader
        George Mitchell, formerly Mr. Peepers, support a comprehensive
        health plan for Americans with universal coverage. The Mitchell
        plan has a full range of health benefits such as preventive
        medicine, internal medicine, minor and major surgery, hair
        styling, manicures, and lawn services. To pay for the plan, the
        Democrats will put it on the federal government's Visa card.


              Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who has no reflection and
        whom Anne Rice recommended to play the part of Lestat in the
        upcoming film _Interview with a Vampire_, leads the Republican
        effort. The Dole plan relies on incentives, deregulation, and
        market forces. The central part of the plan consists of allowing
        Americans to sell or barter their organs, blood, bone marrow,
        brain tissue, etc, to pay for their health care. It also would
        give tax breaks to all Americans who don't become sick or die.


              However, the Dole plan has fewer benefits than the Mitchell
        plan. In the Dole plan, Americans will receive only two benefits:
        a lifetime supply of tongue depressants and a bedpan that one can
        wear also as a ten gallon hat. The Dole plan pays for the benefits
        through an organ inspection fee in which a meat inspector from
        the Department of Agriculture tests Americans' organs for such
        contaminants as salmonella. If the organs seem devoid of
        contamination, the meat inspectors approve them for
        transplantation by stamping "USDA approved" on them. By paying
        for the benefits in this way, the Republicans can say their plan
        has no tax increases.


              Proposals for a health care plan compromise look dim. Sen.
        Phil Gramm (Rep.) of Texas, who threatens secession if either the
        Dole plan or Mitchell plan passes, said either of the proposed
        plans in the Senate will ruin the American health system. "We
        have the greatest health care system in the world," says Gramm, "
        Why just a few years ago American doctors transplanted a baboon's
        heart in a man; in a few years they will be able to transplant a
        chicken's brain in a man, and I refuse to let a meddling Congress
        stifle such a breakthrough advancement like this in American
        health care."



SPECIAL INTERESTS BLEED HEALTH CARE

Jawbone (PETER FUNK PRESS)

              Many political experts believe special interests have
        killed major health care reform in the Senate. Their intense
        lobbying, peremptory whining, and incendiary groveling has
        immobilized the legislative body. The experts point to three
        groups as particularly effective.


              For instance, Lesbians Against Government Waste oppose the
        Mitchell plan. They insist the federal government cannot pay for
        the Mitchell plan, for due to the country's persistent budget
        deficit it has a bad credit rating, which puts a $50 credit limit
        on its Visa card.


              The Association of American Channelers Clairvoyants, and
        Ouija Board Repairmen has attacked the tax breaks in the
        Republican plan, for those who die lose their tax break, making
        the plan biased against dead people. 


              Physicians for the Protection of Loot, Moolah, and Gravy.
        (PPLMG) doesn't like the deregulation aspects of the Dole plan.
        The organization says it will would allow average Americans to
        read government pamphlets and do brain surgery on themselves in
        their homes and get tax breaks. The PPMLG also hates the Mitchell
        plan because it has a 90 day money back guarantee on medical
        procedures, meaning if doctors don't cure an American completely,
        he or she will get a full refund even if inflicted with an
        incurable or unknown disease. 


              If either plan passes, the PPLMG says it would put doctors
        out of business and they would go on welfare and eventually
        become homeless. To survive they then would need to stand on busy
        street corners, dressed in ragged lab coats with their medical
        equipment in shopping carts and accost people, give them physical
        exams without their permission then demand $95 in cash or credit
        card in payment. The PPLMG predicts some desperate doctors will
        go beyond just exams and start X-raying people and demanding
        money, and it does not want to speculate on what a homeless
        proctologist might do to people.
