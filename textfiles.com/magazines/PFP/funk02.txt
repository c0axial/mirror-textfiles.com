 NEW WHITEWATER REVELATIONS REVEALED, YIKES 

 Washington (PETER FUNK PRESS)

     Today, unnamed, reliable well paid sources in the special prosecutor's
 office investigating the Whitewater scandal have turned over a secret memo
 to the Peter Funk Press. It outlines what special prosecutor Robert Fiske--
 whoops, scratch that -- Kenneth W. Starr*  has discovered about how the
 Clintons became involved in the Whitewater scandal.

     The memo seems very important to the special prosecutor because it has
 written in its margins the words, "Hey bub. Secret stuff here. Do not leak.
 Keep this memo at least 500 miles from any journalist. Should a journalist
 come within 500 miles of this memo, eat it immediately then set yourself on
 fire."  However, the special prosecutor's office refuses to acknowledge the
 memo, for when the Peter Funk Press asked Robert Fiske, that is to say,
 Kenneth W. Starr about the memo, he replied, "I can't talk to you right
 now. I am expecting a very important phone call from my bookie."

     According to the memo, the Whitewater incident began as a business
 deal between James McDougal and his wife when Clinton lost his reelection
 bid for governor. Clinton won the governorship of Arkansas by promising the
 citizens of Arkansans that as soon as he became governor he would leave the
 state and not come back. However, Clinton broke this promise immediately
 and stayed in Arkansas to govern the state and undress unsuspecting women. 

     The people of Arkansans didn't mind his undressing unsuspecting women
 so long as he did it as part of his official duties as governor, but they
 became furious over his breached campaign promise to leave the state and
 not come back. Therefore, when Clinton ran for re-election they denied him
 a second term by electing the Republican gubernatorial candidate, a frozen
 chicken by the name of General Sterling Price, who served only one term
 because the cooks in the Arkansas governor's mansion accidently fried it
 and served it an official state dinner for the American Fatback Council to
 celebrate the influence of cholesterol on the American civilization.

     The memo goes on to say the Clintons became involved in Whitewater
 through James McDougal, a former door to door bagpipe salesman, who became
 famous for leading a scientific expedition up the legs of a Scotsman named
 Ian McMacbeth to find out what a Scotsman wears under his kilts. He made a
 film documentary of the expedition that appeared on PBS. Unfortunately, the
 expedition failed because all of its members failed to bring a flashlight,
 and when they reached McMacbeth's kilts they couldn't see anything and had
 to turn around. Later, he became a millionaire by manufacturing psychedelic
 tartan and non-representational tweed.

     McDougal donated a lot of money to Clinton's first campaign for
 governor. In fact, he gave so much money to Clinton's campaign he made
 Clinton's "platinum list," which allowed big campaign donors to go into the
 governor's mansion, sit on Clinton's lap, and lobby him. McDougal used this
 privilege often, and during the hours he sat on Clinton's lap lobbying
 their conversations often diverted into long discussions about politics,
 culture, world affairs and their mutual interest in eating very large
 cheeseburgers. 

     Thus, over the long hours of their conversations, they became very
 good friends. The two men became especially close when McDougal lobbied
 Clinton for a hair transplant subsidy. Clinton got him one through the
 Arkansas Department of Agriculture by declaring McDougal's head a tobacco
 farm in an executive order. Unfortunately, the hair transplant failed, but
 McDougal wisely had obtained crop insurance and recouped most of his
 losses. 

     McDougal never forgot what Clinton did for his head, so after Clinton
 lost the governorship he came to Clinton with a business offer in a land
 development called Whitewater. He sat on Clinton's lap and offered him a
 50% partnership in the land deal. The two had become so accustomed to
 McDougal sitting on Clinton's lap they continued to do it even after
 Clinton lost the governorship. Clinton became very excited about the offer,
 and he jumped out of his chair hollering, "Suuuuuey! I'm going to get rich.
 Oink oink."  Meanwhile, McDougal fell out of Clinton's lap onto the floor,
 injuring his head which entitled him to a disaster payment from FEMA.

     Despite his feeling of excitement, Clinton told McDougal he had to
 talk to his wife Hillary about the matter before making a decision. She had
 the business knowledge in the family he said. For instance, according to
 the secret memo, she once made $500,000 in five minutes trading chocolate
 chip cookies on the commodities market on the advice of some Keebler elves
 living in trees who worked for the Keebler Cookie Company. In return for
 their advice, she promised the elves she would advise Gov. Clinton to
 replace bacon, banana and peanut butter sandwiches with chocolate chip
 cookies as the daily lunch for the Arkansas school lunch program. 

     McDougal gave him a prospectus of Whitewater for Hillary to read.
 After reading it, Hillary became very interested in Whitewater. McDougal
 wrote in it he intended to sell lots on the Whitewater land and attract
 buyers by making Whitewater into a recreational resort with such
 recreational activities as chewing, spitting, snoring, and standing on the
 summits of Ozark hilltops and rolling rocks down on mankind. 

     Hillary Rodham Clinton liked the recreational aspects of Whitewater,
 particularly rolling rocks down on mankind.  She thought it would go over
 big in Arkansas, for it has become the most popular form of family
 entertainment in Arkansas, next to firing a gun in the air. 

     When Hillary Clinton read the terms of McDougal's offer, she decided
 to accept his offer. McDougal valued the Whitewater investment at 1.5
 million dollars and to cover their $750,000 share of the investment he
 asked them to put up their living room sofa. They did and became partners
 with him in Whitewater.


 * A federal court panel replaced Robert Fiske with Kenneth W. Starr when it
 questioned Fiske's objectivity because he bought a new Cadillac with
 President Clinton's Visa card.
