 BARNEY DOES BREAKFAST AND CHARGED WITH MURDER 

 Washington (PETER FUNK PRESS)

     Barney the dinosaur, star of the children's television show_Barney_,
 went berserk this morning during his show and ate three of his child co-
 stars. 

     The mayhem occurred in the Pretend Room while Barney and his co-stars
 sang the song "Shoo Fly Don't Bother Me." In the second verse, Barney
 stopped singing and muttered that he had not eaten breakfast. He started
 staring at the children. Drops of saliva dripped from his mouth. His
 stomach growled. His eyes widened and pupils dilated much like someone on
 the third week of a radical diet of designer water and raw grass, who
 stumbles upon a cheesecake in a bakery window. Just as the children
 finished the song, Barney started to shiver. Suddenly, he just grabbed the
 children and one by one dropped them down his mouth like appetizers. 

     A fourth child only escaped because Barney ate the third child too
 fast, and he bent over choking for several minutes, allowing the child to
 run away. Barney nearly passed out, but a fortuitous belch cleared the
 obstruction. He then stood erect, complained of a severe thirst, and asked
 for a double gin and tonic. 

     This all seemed very ironic, since Barney had just given a ten minute
 lesson, demonstrating to children how to chew one's food properly to
 prevent choking. The lesson even included a rhyming song with lyrics
 instructing children on the proper technique of the Heimlich maneuver.
 Following it, Barney gave a ten minute plea for responsible drinking among
 kindergartners. 

     Before Barney finished his gin and tonic, the police arrived and
 arrested him on three counts of first degree murder, one count of attempted
 murder, and a misdemeanor charge of chewing with his mouth open.
 
     The Public Broadcasting Corporation (PBS), producers of_Barney_,
 estimates seven million children and 300,000 very strange adults saw the
 killings. However, it estimates that over sixty million people saw the show
 that night when many of its local affiliates broadcast the show again as
 part of their fund drive. PBS local affiliates claimed record donations
 from viewers during the rebroadcast, especially when the stations ran
 Barney eating breakfast in slow motion. They also reported receiving
 thousands of supportive letters which said, "Now that's what I call
 culture. Keep it up!"

     News of Barney's arrest shocked the show business world. Barney comes
 from a show business family. His grandfather did stunt work in the film
 King Kong and worked as technical advisor on the film _King Kong Versus_
 _Mohammed Ali_. Barney's father played in the movie _1,000,000 Years B.C._
 and its sequel _1,000,001 B.C._ His mother ran an acting school, which
 became famous for teaching lizards the Stanislasky methods. 

     Barney began his career as a tap dancer. Later, he starred in many
 Broadway shows in which he broke down many barriers against reptiles. He
 played Professor Higgins in an all serpent version of Lerner and Lowe's _My
 Fair Lady_. He played Curly in _Oklahoma_ in the first show produced and
 directed by stegosauruses. His music theater career ended though when he
 tripped over his tail during a dance scene in _West Side Story_. He
 received a severe head injury, and his I.Q dropped seventy points, giving
 him the intelligence of a learned potato. He had to quit the music theater
 but got a job playing himself on own children's TV show.

     Upon Barney's arrest, he hired flamboyant defense attorney A.P. Hee-
 Haw Ripsnort to defend him. Ripsnort is a smooth, down home, southern
 lawyer who speaks with a New York accent. He wears Rhet Butler suits with a
 prostitute's lace garter belt wrapped around his upper arm. In court, he
 wears no shoes or socks and asks beautiful jurywomen it they'd like to arm
 wrestle sometime. While cross-examining witnesses, he eats corn on the cob
 and offers prosecuting attorneys a chew of his tobacco. He specializes in
 defending TV creature actors. For instance he has defended Dino of _The
 Flintstones_, Alf of the show _Alf_, and Herve Villachaez of _Fantasy
 Island_. He became famous for successfully defending Kermit the Frog of the
 Muppets from a vicious palimony suit brought on by Miss Piggy.

     Ripsnort said he would base Barney's defense on temporary insanity,
 for only hours before the killings Barney had watched a pirate video
 cassette of the film _Jurassic Park_ fifteen times consecutively. Ripsnort
 will make the argument that the gratuitous violence in the film _Jurassic_
 Park_ motivated Barney to consume children, a diet that even the American
 Pork Producers does not approve because of its high cholesterol. Ripsnort
 intends to present clips from _Jurassic Park_, showing dinosaurs hunting
 and eating humans, to the jury as part of Barney's defense. He will precede
 the clips with a Bugs Bunny cartoon.

     No matter the outcome of the trial, however, Barney has no future on
 television. The Federal Communications Center (FCC) intends to ban him from
 public airwaves for eating children in daylight hours, a violation of FCC
 rules.
