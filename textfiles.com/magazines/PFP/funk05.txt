 SPERM BANK BECOMES IMPOTENT

 San Francisco (PETER FUNK PRESS). 

     Today, The First National Sperm Bank of San Francisco declared itself 
 impotent and closed its doors. Within an hour of the closing, a crowd of 
 about 500 of the bank's depositors, mostly men, gathered around First 
 National's front door, demanding the return of their sperm deposits. They 
 hurled plastic bags full of 2% milk at the building and chanted over and 
 over "Return my sperm!" When the bank refused to open its doors, the crowd 
 became violent and tried to break into the bank. First National bank 
 managers then called the police who broke up the enraged crowd with tear 
 gas and saltpeter.
 
     Samaritan Bootlick, a fertility expert from the Congress of Copious
 and Gala Fertility (CCGF), says the bank's failure exemplifies the problems
 of the sperm bank industry, and he predicts more sperm bank failures in the
 future. He has even suggested a fertility panic, a run on sperm banks, and
 the collapse of the entire sperm industry unless the federal government
 intervenes.   

     The problems of First National Sperm Bank of San Francisco began when
 its young and aggressive manager Moot Protege invested the bank's sperm
 reserves in venture fertility schemes. The bank suffered incredible losses
 in these high risk investments. For instance, First National lost 50,000
 units of sperm in a venture to improve the efficacy of sperm by teaching
 them the crawl stroke and the scissors kick. However, it failed when the
 sperm could only learn to dog paddle very fast. Even though this venture
 scheme cast doubt on the ability of sperm to learn, First National
 continued to invest in such projects and lost more than 300,000 units of
 sperm in ventures to teach sperm things like assertive training and dead
 reckoning.

     The bank lost another 10,000 units of sperm in a eugenics venture
 called Truth Justice and the American Way, run by a company called Hot
 Pants Associates. First Bank lent 10,000 units of sperm to Hot Pants, which
 used them to trade for 100 units of Superman's sperm. Hot Pants intended to
 inseminate American women for a fee and breed Americans that can fly.
 However, this project failed because confidence men sold Hot Pants
 Associates 100 units not of Superman's sperm but that of Alfred E. Newman. 

     The death blow came to the bank when Protege, fearing the loss of his
 job, then tried to recoup the bank's sperm loss by his own fraud. He
 inflated First National's sperm reserves by buying billions of units of
 sperm whale sperm, depositing it in the vault, and registering it as human
 sperm. The inflated sperm reserves allowed First National to borrow sperm
 from other sperm banks and buy sperm on the open futures market. 

     So long as the world spot sperm price rose Protege could pay off the
 interest on the loans; however, the world sperm price fell when the
 Chinese, desperate for foreign capital, went on a crash program to gather
 sperm from its population and dumped 50 billion units of sperm  on the
 world market. The world spot sperm price dropped 30% in a week. First
 National couldn't meet its margin calls and Protege's entire scheme
 collapsed, forcing First National Sperm Bank of San Francisco to close its
 doors. 
     
     Ironically, Samaritan Bootlick and the CCGF blame the federal
 government for the sperm bank industry's problems. They believe an act of
 Congress, the Ying Yang Act, laid the foundation for sperm banks to abuse
 regulations and engage in speculation. Passed in the middle of the night by
 Congress, the Ying Yang Act deregulated the sperm bank industry, enabling
 sperm banks to extend their intercourse into risky enterprises. Bootlick
 says the act favors speculation, and the Congress should reverse it before
 the entire sperm industry collapses, forcing an immense federal bailout in
 which every able-bodied American man will have to donate some of his sperm
 to save the sperm bank industry from certain ruin.
