                        Peter Funk Press 

An mythical, satirical news service published in the form of a
small online ezine. It reports what did not happen but probably
should have happened in current events and modern culture.

Byron Lanning (swipe@well.sf.ca.us or blanning@crl.com) writes
and publishes it.
