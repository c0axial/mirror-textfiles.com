 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT KIDNAPS FROG

 Bowel Movement (PETER FUNK PRESS)


     At Out-Herod High School, in Bowel Movement, North Carolina, a tenth
 grade student named Eliot CrudeRot walked into his biology class carrying a
 shotgun. His class had just begun a frog dissection lab, and when his
 teacher Mr. Factotum asked him why he brought the shotgun into the class,
 CrudeRot replied he feared the frog he dissected "will jump out of the
 dissection pan and get me."


     CrudeRot distrusted frogs. It originated from a tragic childhood
 incident that occurred sometime during his boyhood. One day he put his pet
 housefly Marlowe on a leash and took him for a walk beside a pond. Marlowe
 loved the sight of water through his compound eyes. Unfortunately, CrudeRot
 walked too close to the shore, and when Marlowe buzzed the bank a large
 bullfrog swallowed him. The loss devastated CrudeRot. His parents tried to
 give him other pet flies, but they could never replace his beloved Marlowe,
 and he always opened the window and let them fly away.  


     Mr. Factotum assured CrudeRot the frog had pins stuck through all of
 its appendages which would hold it in the dissection pan, but CrudeRot
 said, "So what. They put chains on King Kong and look what happened." He
 then walked over to his lab station, pointed the shotgun at the frog in the
 dissection pan, and said, "I'm putting you under citizen's arrest." 


    He then carried the frog at gun point to the sheriff's office in Bowel
 Movement, presented it to Officer Colossal Underpants, and demand he arrest
 the frog. "On what charges?" asked Officer Underpants. CrudeRot said the
 frog wanted to jump out of the dissection pan and get him. "I can't arrest
 a frog on intentions. It has to jump out and get you before I can arrest
 him." CrudeRot made the demand once more, and when Sheriff Underpants again
 refused to arrest the frog, CrudeRot pointed the shotgun at him and said,
 "I am putting you under citizen's arrest." 


     Officer Underpants quickly reminded CrudeRot that he no longer had
 citizenship in this country. It seems he had a severe disagreement with the
 present Administration, which refused to make him the king of Hawaii. In
 protest to their decision, CrudeRot donated his citizenship to the
 Salvation Army. 


    CrudeRot suddenly broke down in tears. "Why, why," he howled. "Why did
 I give up my citizenship. Now, I can never serve on a jury and send traffic
 violators to the electric chair... Jesus. H. Christ." As he wailed, Sheriff
 Underpants slapped some handcuffs on him, charged him with kidnapping and
 making unfounded accusations against a deceased amphibian. 


     After he locked up CrudeRot, Officer Underpants took the frog safely
 back to the biology class at Autotoxemia High. There, Mr. Factotum
 commended Officer Underpants for his bravery and said, "Your act of courage
 deserves a medal," so he hung the Order of Herpetology around his neck.

 JELL-O JELL-O, IS ANYONE IN THERE?

 Autotoxemia (PETER FUNK PRESS)


    This morning, Beauregard Vaudeville, an eleventh grade student at
 Autotoxemia High in Autotoxemia, New York snuck a rocket propelled grenade
 (RPG) launcher and four grenades past the school's metal detector. Although
 the weapon and grenades set off the metal detector's alarm, Vaudeville told
 the security guard they belonged to part of his science project. 


     He told the guard he wanted to find out if he could raise the pulse
 and respiration rates of teachers by pointing a loaded grenade launcher at
 them. The security guard, a graduate of Autotoxemia High, said, "Finally,
 somebody is doing a worthwhile science project instead of some stupid thing
 like germinating seeds. Go on in."


    Vaudeville then walked into the school cafeteria where he held the
 entire cafeteria staff hostage with the grenade launcher. He said he
 wouldn't release them until the school's principal removed fruit filled
 bowels of Jell-O from the cafeteria menu. He had a deep personal grudge
 against the bowels of Jell-O, for they had turned down his repeated
 marriage proposals. 


     Meanwhile, a janitor had alerted the police and they surrounded the
 school building. The crisis ended abruptly, however, when police
 negotiators tricked Vaudeville. They told him some Jell-O butterscotch
 pudding had just asked them for his phone number. Vaudeville replied,
 "Really," and as he set down the grenade launcher to write down his phone
 number on a piece of paper the police handed him they grabbed him, beat the
 crap out of him, and arrested him.

 GUNFIGHT AT THE OK SCHOOLYARD

 Washington (PETER FUNK PRESS)


     Shocked by the recent news reports of gun violence in public school,
 the National Rifle Association (NRA) demanded the revocation of all laws
 and regulations preventing students from bringing guns into public schools.


     In an interview with the _PETER FUNK PRESS_, NRA spokesman Jocko
 Smoothbore said the NRA believes teachers and administrators cannot stand
 by each student every minute of the day to protect them from the criminal
 students and the growing violence in public schools. Therefore, law-abiding
 students need to carry guns for their self-defense.  


     He said the regulations preventing law-abiding students from carrying
 guns in school only promoted violence in school because the law-abiding
 students have no way to protect themselves. In fact, he said society can
 stop violence in public schools only if law-abiding students carry guns in
 them and use them for self-defense. For instance, Smoothbore said if law-
 abiding students could carry guns they would have shot the frog kidnapper
 in Bowel Movement, NC and the obsessive Jell-O lover in Autotoxemia, NY. 


     Smoothbore gave the example of an experimental high school in Two Nice
 Guys, Texas in which all students carry guns. Before the school board began
 the gun reform, which allowed law-abiding students to carry guns, gangs of
 armed cheerleaders roamed the halls of the high school shooting innocent
 nerds in the butt. After the reform, the nerds got guns and fired back,
 inflicting heavy casualties on the cheerleaders, causing them to disband,
 and reform themselves into armed after school Bible clubs.


     This year the school has not had single act of student violence,
 although it had several gun deaths due to the school's intermural Russian
 roulette league.


     Smoothbore said the NRA will offer direct support to public schools
 that enact gun reform. For instance, the NRA would set up gun libraries in
 these schools. Students could check out guns from the gun libraries, carry
 them around in school, use them for self-defense if needed then return them
 at the end of the school day. The students would use them only for lawful
 purposes. If the students use them in unlawful activities like robbery,
 murder, or suicide, they immediately would lose their gun-borrowing
 privileges.


     He suggested the NRA also could provide an education program for
 schools enacting gun reform. Students would learn the proper use of a gun,
 including techniques such as how to speed load a revolver and how to bring
 down a criminal with one shot and not have to pistol whip him to death and
 how to build your own tank in case the government bans assault weapons. It
 also will have seminars on forming student posses and student off campus
 vigilante groups.

 SCHOOLS IN TROUBLE ... SEND LIMBAUGH, GUNS, AND MORALS

 New York (PETER FUNK PRESS)


     Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has joined the National Rifle
 Association (NRA) and its effort to enable students to bring guns in
 school. To show his support for this important empowerment of students, he
 has put together a "Gun Totin' Update" for his show. 


     It consists of Franciscan monks humming and snapping their fingers to
 the rock and roll version of the _Requiem Mass_  while the somber voice of
 Dirty Harry whispers over and over the deep religious question of "Well
 punk, do you feel lucky today?".

     
     Limbaugh breaks in during the music and summarizes news stories about
 criminal students using guns to cause mayhem in schools. He follows it with
 a diatribe that declares the lack of morality in school not guns causes gun
 violence. 

     
     He ends the update with an appeal to public schools to instill morals
 in students by reintroducing prayer and the teaching of moral absolutes
 such as "Thou shalt not kill unless somebody messes with you" and "Thou
 shalt not commit adultery with thy neighbor's gun."
