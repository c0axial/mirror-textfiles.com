    We began 1995 with our largest issue yet! After that, severe internal
conflict plus a diminished interest by our writers (and even our readers)
combined to halt POM from being made.

    As the sole member of the editorial staff who remained, I decided to let
the magazine go. But recently, there has been a minor thirst for a magazine
such as ours, and so I decided to get POM back together. Unfortunately, POM is
all the result of one man: me. And I _know_ can't do this by myself. I need
people who are DEDICATED who can write me an article every month or two months.
I also need contributers, who can write every once in a while. And most
importantly, I need more distributors who can take POM to places like
Compuserve and America Online.

    POM has been cleansed, that is for sure. If this mag continues, it will be
because of dedication. But I need help, and I need it bad, so please try and do
something if you want to see this magazine succeed.

    Stay tuned to POM for more news, info, and thought-provoking articles.
After four issues, I am beginning to see a light ahead of us. Perhaps this mag
will make it after all.

    We'll see you next month!

           ... The Editor ...  (Hopefully that will be plural by next issue)

    Well, I am back again! This month we deal with a fiery topic: religion in
school. Some people are completely against any type of religious expression
being displayed in school. Other say it is unconstitutional for students to not
be allowed the freedom to express themselves religiously. Let's go ahead and
plunge into the topic!

    Ever since prayer was removed from school in 1962, illegitemacy rates,
juvenile crime rates, drug usage rates, and high school dropout rates have
increased dramatically. Many people attribute this to coincidence. But does it
make sense to say that every stastistic that measures immoral activities has
increased since prayer was removed? When this fact is pointed out, some will
respond "It makes no difference. What about 'seperation of church and state?'"
Here's what: That phrase is found no where in the Constitution. It isn't found
in the Declaration of Independence. Not even the Articles of Confederation. No
Founding document from our country contains the phrase "seperation of church
and state." Would you like to know where it DID come from: A letter Thomas
Jefferson wrote to a Baptist church. You see, this Baptist church had heard
rumors that the Congrationalist sect of Christianity was about to become our
national sect. They fired off a letter to President Jefferson, who replied,
telling them that no official sect would be established. Indeed, look at this
quote: "Our nation was founded as a Christian nation. The Constitution protects
us from coming under the rule of any one sect. You are in no danger. There is a
protective wall seperating the church and the state."

    Have you ever heard the first half of that quote before? Probably not. In
the case of Christian Science Church vs. United States, the Supreme Court
provided 87 precedents that upheld the Unite States' support of Christianity.
Religion was a normal part of all society, even government, until the
humanistic era began. When Franklin D. Roosevelt became a king by serving
almost four terms and enacting numerous pro-government, anti-religion,
pro-humanist bills, he set the stage for humanism to roll in. Because of this,
by the 1960s, people were getting hooked on humanism, and almost didn't care
that prayer was being removed.

    Unfortunately, it would seem that that removal of prayer and religion from
all aspects of the school has backfired in the extremists' faces. Why is it
that world religions classes are allowed to teach about Buddhism, Islam,
Hinduism, and other religions, but NOT Christianity? What is wrong here?

    Here's what's wrong: There is an out-and-out attack on Christianity. By
keeping the generation of the '60s from receving reinforcement, they grew up
and kept their children from receiving any religious instruction. And now we
are suffering the consequences.

    The solution? Allow voluntary prayer. Put Christianity back into world
religion classes. Give the students a time after the Pledge of Allegiance to
have a "moment of silence" where they can pray if they wish. There need not be
a "generic prayer" that all students could pray without some being offended.
That idea is ridiculous. By _allowing_ Chrisitianity and other religions to be
taught and excercised, we allow our children to grow and make up for the
mistakes of a generation past.

    Racism on the rise?  You had better believe it! ...At a point when
the world has seen communism falter as an imperfect system to manage
people, democracy seems to be headed down the same road. No one is
seeing the "big" picture. Maybe we have to combine ideologies to achieve
the perfect utopian government. Remember, government-sponsored health
care was a communist idea. Should only the rich be allowed to live long?
Does that say that because a person is poor, he is a lesser human being
and doesn't deserve to live as long, because he doesnt wear a tie to
work?

    [Ed: This is from a letter by Timothy McVeigh to the Union-Sun & Journal
in Lockport NY.]

    Does this sound like the rambling of a right wing extremists... or
perhaps a voice from the far left?

    Some serious questions are emerging from the bombing that need to be
answered, yet the FBI nor the media are even addressing them.  These questions
are as follows.


1. What caused the second explosion?  Scientists familiar with
   seismographic recordings can find no explaination other than a second
   bomb to satisfy the second blip.  It was assumed at first the second
   blip may have been the debris hitting the ground, however the
   demolition of the entire structure didnt even register.

2. Why were there no ATF agents in the building that day?

3. There was an unexploded bomb found in the building by the ATF, what
   type of device was it and why was it there?

4. The FBI put out an all points bulletin for the capture of two men in
   a brown Chevy pickup recorded on an ATT video setting this bomb and
   leaving in the truck.  Who were these men, now never discussed?

5. McVeigh was arrested at a time and location from Oklahoma City that
   demanded he drive a minimum of 85 miles per hour on a well patroled
   interstate hiway[sp], with a vehicle ('78 mercury) that had no license
   plates and carrying a loaded pistol for which he had no permit.
   McVeigh offered no resistance and volunteered the information that he
   was armed, this after he should have been aware of the bombs destruction
   and the death of at least 5 people.

6. The cost of making this bomb, renting the vehicle and motels is in
   excess of $10,000 dollars.  Where did McVeigh, who had been working
   for minimum wage, get this kind of money?

7. Ramsay Clark who has been hired to represent the Waco survivors in a
   law suit against the government has subpoenaed all government
   records and phone calls concerning Waco. Were all these records
   stored at the Alfred P. Murrah building?

    The government has recently asked for more time in building a case
against Nichols, [as] they have no substantial evidence to present as yet
that would assure an indictment.  The same is true of Timothy McVeigh
even though he does have some ties to this case.

    Since I have written this I have found out that one of the suspects who
was driving the brown Chevy pickup has been found. From reports he is an
Iraqui[sp] soldier, a survivor of Desert Storm who was brought to this
country along with many thousands of Iraquis[sp] by our government. There
are a number of witness[es] who place him at the scene of the bombing and a
barmaid who served him at a tavern said he was there with McVeigh. She
remembers this because the Iraqi kept asking her if she was married and
sho could not understand him because of his accent which she recognized
from TV coverage of Desert Storm.

    This person has been found by a TV reporter and private investigator
working under contract for the TV station, they have kept the FBI
informed of all they do and what they observe. The FBI has ordered them
to turn over all videos they take during surveilance but so far the FBI
has not seen fit to arrest him; the national media as of today are
maintaining a complete silence about this. This has been going on since
April 23, and has been on local news media in Oklahoma City.

    Could there be some political considerations here?  Could it be that
some politicians felt there would be less impetus to pass Clinton's
terrorist bill if this was known and also detrimental to Clinton's push
against the militia?   This could explain the FBI's reluctance to arrest
and question this man.

    Well, I'm back, and happy to be with you again. I'm sure you're wondering
about the title of my column... Well, it suits me best. Instead of focusing on
one single topic, I'm going to switch back and forth over several.

    First of all there is the Oklahoma bombing. Much of the furor surrounding
this incident has died down. However, it riled many people up to realize that
an American would commit such an act against his own country. Much concern
arose concerning militia involvement in the attack.

    Which brings me to militias. What _are_ they? Well, I am fully for the
militias, however, it is important to realize they do not all fit in the same
category. Many religious and racist militias are evil in their intents.
However, the question is; what does the government do? Well, nothing yet. The
problems from militias won't arise for a few years.

    Republicans in Congress continue to dominate American politics. President
Clinton is finding himself forced to agree and appear to be cooperative towards
the Congress. Even so, the President issued his first veto on an economic bill
he called "more pork." In truth, this bill cut funds that government
departments hadn't used this year in next year's budget. I have yet to find the
"pork" portion of the bill. And in related news, President Clinton
half-jokingly requested that Speaker Newt Gingrich attend an open-forum polite
debate in New Hampshire. To the White House's shock, Gingrich agreed, and the
two men came together to discuss issues with a group of senior citizens. The
dialogue went smoothly, and both were very courteous, even sharing some laughs
together. This was too short of notice and to surprising to have been
planned... Could a new cooperation be on the horizon? Maybe so..

    And finally, I can't leave you without mentioning O.J. Simpson and his
officially one-year old murder trial. Frankly, this case is ridiculous, it's
gotten far too out of hand, and it has shown us just how far out of whack the
Jury Selection System is. A politically correct jury? Did the thought ever
occur to the powers that be in the judicial system that perhaps they could
choose RANDOMLY? This case has cost more than any other in U.S. history, and
most Americans are tired of it. One last soundbite: To shows like American
Journal -- STOP CAPITALIZING ON O.J.! I now call American Journal "O.J.
Journal" because all they do is talk about the day's progress in the O.J. case.
I wonder what would happen if the case adjourned for a day... Would they have
anything to talk about?

    I hope you enjoyed my rambling thought processes... I'll see you next
time!!
