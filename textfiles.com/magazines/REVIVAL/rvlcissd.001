                          FOOLING BELL 800 ANI

     Bell Canada 1-800 numbers are all blessed with the gift from bell
hell... Automatic Number Identification. And all is fine and well if you
are PBX'ing, but why?! The following is a simple, and consistent method
with which to fool BELL ani, to the extent where they only know what city
you are in.

     You must train your ear... on just about every phone call you make,
you hear a faint 1300Hz tone accompanied by white noise. Each '='
representing this sound, and '-' representing silence, the pattern of sound
for a 1-800 number is approximately this:


     ----==========--==-----------------===========================RING

     As a hacker, it is your duty to link to your three way node(where a
trusty hacker freind is waiting) at the '*' in the following illustration:

     ----==========--==-*---------------===========================BEEP!

     'Your number please sir??'

     '800 666 girl'

     'Your number *AGAIN* please sir????'

     'Oooops, that was my sisters number.. mine is [my area]-[my
      exchange]-random four digits!'

     'Thank you for (ab)using Bell Canada'

                                  ---

                    ADDITIONAL WAYS TO FOOL BELL ANI


     You have just read a method of fooling Bell ANI for anyone equipped
with a 3-way line.  However, some of you may not have 3-way, or may require
another method.  Thus this article, Alternate methods of fooling Bell ANI.

     The first step to fooling Bell Ani is very simple.  We must connect with
the operator.  Divert if you wish, but it is not neccessary.  Once you have 
gotten the operator say the follwing being careful to say EXACTLY what
I have written.

"Hello.  Could I please speak with ANI?"

     This is a keyphraze that will instantly gain you access to ANI.  AT this
point we must fool ANI, and lull all suspicions.  The following works for 
me as a general rule.

"Hi ANI.  I really love you!  I'm VERY sorry about last night.....
 let me take you out again tonight and make it up to you!  I REALLY LOVE
 YOU!  I'll give you my real phone number!  And I won't use aliases anymore! 
 I promise!  I don't know what I'd do without you!  Please give me another
 chance.  We can meet at my place...."

This is generally a safe way to fool ANI.  After this, the most difficult
phaze is completed, it is up to you to close the conversation quickly
(can only talk to a bitch for so long....) and meet her after she
gets off work.

If this is done properly, You will gain access to wonderful crevices of Bell
employee property that will keep ypu going for weeks.  However, be warned, 
as with codes, an ANI is only good for so long....  after a week or two
it is best to find a new ANI.

Telephone Pirates. Not just hackers anymore  by Gerry Blackwell
-------------------------------------------

Two years ago, a teenage hacker 'broke into' westing  house canada inc. sl1
PBX in missisauga, and stole $5000 worth of long distance telephone calls.

The company was lucky. It was petty crime commited by a not very clever
kid. That amount was peanuts. Still, westinghouse canada took a stand. It
tracked down the perpetrator and unlike other companies in similar
circumstances, brought the police in and went public with the story. 'We
were determined not to get a reputation for backing down.', says telecom
manager Al Addis.

Westing House had set up an 800 line terminating at a direct inward service
access(DiSA) port on the SL1. Executives on the road or at home could call
in to the switch, then dial out on the outWATS line to make their long
distance calls. Each executive had a four digit authorization code, and the
company monitor call detailed records regularily. The problem surfaced when
one senior executive long distance calling throught the disa port suddenly
skyrocketed.


DISA PORT BREACHED
------------------

It wasn't hard to figure out what had happened. Somebody had found out the
telephone number of the DISA port, possibly by using a PC program and a
modem to repeatedly dial numbers in sequence until it hit one that answered
with the wright kind of tone. Then a different PC program repeatedly dialed
then number, each time trying a different authorization code until one
worked.

That's the high tech method. It may be the theif learned the number by
shear accident. Westing house, like many other companies, had not stressed
the importance of keeping DISA numbers confidential. The kid who did the
hacking in this case only used the authorization code for his calls to
freinds and computer bulletin boards. The long distance charges appeared on
the Westing phone bill.

The company was lucky. The kid didn't, as many have, pass the authorization
code around to all his buddies, or worse, broadcast it on a hackers
bulletin board. Telecom staff at wessingtn house started phoning some of
the unnacountable numbers on the executive CDR printout. They ended up
talking to the parents of a freind of the perpatrator.

Again, they were lucky, this was an inexperienced hacker who didn't bother
to cover his tracks. 'It is unusual that the freinds parents were willing to
help.', Addis adds.

At that point, Westing House called the police, who went to the suspects
home with a search warrant. They found a PC set up for hacking. The company
stopped short of prosecuting, and eventually had to write off the $5000.
Westing House has now re-configured it's DISA ports so callers can only
access local lines, thus minimizing potential financial loss from further
hacking.

A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY
-------------------------

THe Westing house case, unfortunately, is only the tip of the iceburg.
Theft of the telephone service and, more importantly, from customers is
endemic. Estimates in the US aggregate losses by customers at somewhere
between 500 million and 1 billion dollars a year.

Bell canada director of regional security in Ontario estimates losses by
phone company customers in Canada 'in the millions'. Srgt. Val King, in
charge of the computer crime unit of the RCMP economic crime directorate in
Ottawa has investigated at least one case in which the victims losses
topped $50 000. Other involved amounts of $20000 - $30000 and $40000
dollars.

EMBARRASSED VICTIMS
-------------------

The only thing remarkable about the Westing House case, is that the company
freely admits it happened. Most victims wont talk about the problem out of
the embarrasment, or fear of losing investors confidence, or the mistaken
idea that clamming up will prevent other criminals from figuring out how to
do it. "It can be a problem if you're not carefull", was the comment, all
too typical of the telecom manager of a large Canadian resourse company.
"But the less talking about it, the better."

That's the kind of attitude, said atlanta based security consultant Larry
Rigdon of communications consultants Ltd. that makes DISA fraud the
dirty little secret of the telecom industry.

"It's a major major problem", he said, yet nobody's talking about it. Not
even the media. In one of the hush hush cases, Rigdon claims the city of
New York was hit for $750 000 in a year, "But they won't admit it", he
says, "It's all political."

The RCMP's Val King says the unwillingness of coorporations to prosecute, or
even report a phone fraud case is one of the major problems in bedeviling
police work in this area.

"Even if a company doesn't wish to prosecute, we still like to know about
it.", he said, "it might help in advising companies on how to prevent other
crimes, AND you may actually have evidence that could help us prosecute a
criminal in another case.".

KIDS AREN'T THE REAL PROBLEM
----------------------------

But even with more help from the victims, prosecuting phone crooks won't be
easy. Rigdon and other security experts say, juvenile hackers are not
really the problem.

"If a company gets hit for $1000 in a month, maybe that's a kid", says
Rigdon, "But when it's $10 000, $50 000, $250 000, that's not a kid. That's
a proffesional who knows exactly what he's doing".

Says King, "it's falsely to think that hackers are all kids. It's just that
they're the ones who are easy to catch. As they get more experienced, they
learn to cover their tracks better.". Rigdon, and another US based security
consultant, Jim Ross, of Ross Engeneering Inc., in Adams Town(?) MD believe
many of the most dramatic cases of DISA fraud in the US can be traced to
drugs, trafficers, and other organised criminals. Bell Canada knows that
some of the cases investigated in Canada involve drugs or organised crime.
King admits some of the cases the RCMP investigated had links to organised
crime.

IN one US Case criminals stung a Harrisburg PA coorporation for $250 000
over a period of months. When the company discovered the fraud initially,
it upgraded security on its DISA ports so callers had to enter six digit
authorization codes instead of a four digit code. That didn't stop them for
long. All the calls were going to Columbia. When investigators finally
traced them back, they found the calls originated from a bogus construction
trailer set up on a vacant lot in manhatten. Of course the trailer was long
gone by the time investigators got there.


$50 000 in 8 days
-----------------

In another case, criminals bilked a chicago company of $50 000 in 8 days.

The same magnitude of loss can result when amateurs broadcast a DISA number
and authorization code on a Bulletin Board, Ross Says. For a few days,
hundreds of hackers may use the numbers wracking enormous phone bills for
the companies victimised.


HARD TO PROSECUTE
----------------

Inexperienced Phreakers(the term for telephone hackers), such as the kid
who stung Westing House are hard to prosecute, even when they leave a track
of muddy footprints behind them.

"Suppose you find the house where the calls are originating.", says
Detective Dave Hodgson of the Metro Toronto Police Fraud Squad. "There may be
five people in there. How do you know who commited the offence? You also
have to be there when they're doing it to charge them.". Hodgson has
investigated 'half a dozen' cases of phone theft in the last year, and
wasn't able to lay charges in any of them. King says his unit success rate
in prosecuting phone crooks is 'Less than 25%'.


THE VOICE MAIL DOOR
-------------------

The other major weak spot in modern telecommunication systems is the Voice
Messaging System. 

In one case in the US, hackers broke access codes on a new
voice mail and automated attendant system installed in the Los Angelos
based certified grocers of california. The system included an 800 number for
the convinience of the grocery, wholesalers, employees, and customers.

Criminals broke into the system and temporarily commandeered 200 of 300 mail
boxes. They replaced the mail boxes owners greetings with recorded messages
giving up to the minute new york cocain prices and information about
hookers services. The company didn't detect the situation until it noticed
a suddent increase in the use of its 800 numbers.

Only in America you say? Think again. RCMP Srgt. Val King in charge of the
forces computer crime unit in Ottawa says there have been almost identical
cases in Canada, involving drugs and prostitution.

In one instance a hacker posing as the system administrator, broadcast a
message to select user saying the company suspected there was fraudulant
use of the system and was investigating. Could they please assist by giving
him a private message leaving their passwords, and ID? Luckily someone
checked with the real system administrator, and blew the whistle.

Hackers can easily, and will, if they haven't already, call into a Voice
Mail System, and through dial to the public switching network. If the line
is busy, or ringing no answer, the system allows callers to dial 0, and
then dial another extention rather than leaving a voice message for the
original recipiant. On many systems you can dial 0 and then 9 for an
outside line. From there, you can dial anywhere in the world.

So is there a problem with phone theft in Canada? you bet. How big is
harder to say, but if you accept estimates from experts like Ross and
Rigdon who say it's a billion dollar program in the US, it must be worse
than it seems in Canada, or it's soon going to get worse.

In addition to this letter, a page was recieved detailing methods that
Canadaian companies shoud, and undoubtedly will use to protect themselves.
Hackers, take out your cyberdecks:

BEGIN _|


     1. Best Defence:
        Disconnect all DISA ports, using calling cards instead.

     2. Next Best Defence:
        Block all trunk calls to DISA ports or ??? All overseas calls.
        (The biggest theft has involved overseas calls.) 

     3. Turn off DISA ports at night. Many fraudulant calls are made late
        at the night.

     4. Set the system to wait at least five rings before answering, and
        don't answer with a steady tone. Answer with dead air, or a voice
        message. (Hackers use many programs to automatically dial numbers
        in search of DISA ports. They count the hit when the number answers
        on the first or second ring with a steady tone.)

     5. Issue a different DISA authorization code to each user. Do not
        implement one code for all users.

     6. Set mailbox password at a minimum six digits, and enforce frequent
        password changes every 30 days if the feature is avaliable.

     7. If users select their own authorization codes, set a poilicy and
        make it stick that they can not use extention numbers, company ID,
        or social insurance number. Make someone responsible for testing
        codes for hackability.

     8. Delete all Authorization codes programed into your PBX for testing
        and service. Purge codes of former employees, or any code a former
        employee might have known.

     9. Implement DISA ports so that entering an invalid authorisation code
        causes the system to drop the line.

    10. Monitor the system continually through alarms status logs.

    11. Study call detail reports on a regular basis to spot fraud related
        calling patterns early.

                SO YOU KILLED THE MUTHA FUCKA. NOW WHAT?

   The computer underground offers files which instruct in everything from 
the weapons of death to methods of murder without remorse or being caught.
However, one encounters a fatal flaw in these ACSII councellors when one 
actually commits a murder.  As for the killing, we will assume 
that you are capable of pulling this off yourself.  Various creative methods
will be discussed in future editions, for now, however, we deal with the
after-effect.  

   Guns are always an easy way out.  So, say you  have just shot some bitch
... NOW what are you going to do?  If you are reading this you are not made of
the stuff that would have you sit down and cry.  Perhaps flight has entered 
your mind?  Well, running is not advised.  In the before mentioned scenario
of having shot a woman, one is presented with a multitude of wonderous,
once-in-a-lifetime opertunities.  For all eternity man has been obbsesed with
putting his penis in women.  Vagina, mouth, butt, if its a hole, we stick it
in gleefully.  So, now your looking at a WHOLE NEW HOLE!  While unconventional,
this is a wonderful oppertunity.  

   Before even considering entry, one must take a few precautions.  We are not
animals after all.  Firstly, clear the entrance of any bone fragments that
could hurt poor ol' Jimmy.  That done, finding a latex condom is advised since
the whore probably has aids.  Now, get to it.  Intercourse like its never been 
before!  You will find that various organs and mucle formations add and
decrease from the effect in very interesting ways.  If you are fast enough to 
do this while blood is still flowing, it is a very pleasant feeling.

  I will discuss other things to try in the future also.  However, before 
I go, I will leave you with two other ideas.  A nice slit with a knife 
thats a bit tight also offers possiblity.  Secondly, you may say, sure its 
good fun, but I am going to get caught!  Well, fear not.  Murder usually 
gets you caught anyway, and this will present an IDEAL insanity plea, 
even though we know your not!

                           #1 WITH A BULLET         

This article extracted from the Toronto Star Dec 26, 1992.

Montreal inventor touts a new age in ballistics
-----------------------------------------------

MONTREAL (CP) -

Picture the scene: a police officer finds a spent bullet at the scene
of killing.  

Whose gun fired it?

Ask Michael Barrett.

Barett has come up with a system to automate the identification of
bullets after their discharge.

Every fired bullet bears markings from the gun that are just as 
distinctive as a single fingerprint.

Barrett's computerized system, which is called Bulletproof, was developed by
forensic technology division of Walsh Automation Inc, a Montreal firm.
Barett says it advances ballistics - the science of projectiles and 
firearms - into the next century.

The system carries a $500,000 pricetag, which may explain why there hasn't 
been a rush to buy it, although ballistics experts throughout the world
have shown interest.

Barrett, of Montreal, said in a recent interview his microscope-data system
can identify and store data taken from test bullets from every registered 
firearm in Canada.

He says the system can also:

        - Trasmit data to any law enforcement agency or crime laboratory
        in the world.  That could alert authorities to the possibilty that
        a security killer may be operating, and help track the movements
        of criminals orginizations or terrorists,

        - Help law-enforcement agencies solve crimes involving shooting.

        - Save forensic examiners thousands of hours of tedious work
        trying to link slugs to specific firearms.

        - Cut down the handling of bullets used as court exibits, reducing
        the chance of their damage or loss.

"Its an interesting, but expensive system," said Yves Ste-Marie, head
of Quebec's police labratory.

Gaylan Warren, a member of Association of Firearms and Toolmark Examiners,
a global organization, said the system has great potential.

"I've been to Montreal twice to look at the Walsh system and I'm convinced
that it does what they claim it can do," Warren a firearms examiner,
said in a telephone interview from his home in Newport, Wash.

"In ballistics you're dealing with cylindrical objects, and at times it takes
hours of painstaking work at the microscope before you can arrive at the
verdict."

Barrett's invention advances the microscope by years, Warren said.  It has
a computer operated motor that can stop 50,000 times a revolution.  
The slug can be videotaped and freeze-frames producd.

John W. Matthews, who was the RCMP's cheif scientist for firearms until he
retired in 1989, agreed with Warren that examining bullets takes a great 
deal of time.

"Four to eight hours isn't uncommon."

Matthews, interviewed by telephone from his home in Ottawa, was excited 
about the possibility that ballistics examiners could compare notes via
computer link.

Matthews, who said Barrett asked him to critique the system, termed it
"progressive.  And when it gets on ine, (it) should prove a time-saver
for harried ballistics examiners.""

|~ END



    Well, there's no real advance in technology here.. but the idea is
good, and it sounds like implementation might be welcomed by the wealthier
law enforcement agencies. The 8 hours examining a bullet could be the
escape of a criminal, or worse(in most cases), the death of another
individual.

    On the other hand, aren't we surcomming to the enemy?.. What ever
happened to anti-big brother ideology? I'll show you my serial number if
you show me yours...

 	    C I S S D 's  ANARCHY SERIES: UNDERWATER ANARCHY

                    Things that make you go BOOM!


Water. You can't set it on fire, and it makes a lousy bomb. Most of the time
it actually Impedes any attempt at being anarchic. However, water contains one
thing that can open new and unexplored forms of anarchy and physical violence:

The Scuba Diver.

Yes, the Diver. Scuba Divers love to explore new depths and flash their
high-tech and expensive gear all over the place. Divers are often upper class
middle aged men, which makes them an ideal target.  Rich thrill seakers who
can flaunt their money, and in great quantitiy . Divers are also many times
the neuveau-riche, the very polluters of our society. No matter how you look
at it, Divers are filthy rich and are stinking bastards - the best kind for
attacks of anarchy.

In response, from the twisted depths of the CISSD's Collective Penii, I
present to you the Famed Underwater Diver Bomb.

Materials Needed:

1 Fairly Large Jar or othen type of Sealable Bottle.
Enough oil to fill half of the bottle
Enough Potassium to Fill the other Half of the bottle
Some kind of Trinket, or Toy (Preferable Shiny)  to entice the Diver.

Remember, Potassium will burn quickly when exposed to air, and explodes in
water but not Oil.

What to Do Beforehand:

1) Take the Oil and fill the jar half way with it.
2) Place the Trinket inside, so it is quite Visible to anyone seeing the jar.
3) Fill the Other half of the jar with the Potassium and Close the lid as
   Quickly as possible to Prevent YOUR injury.
4) Go to your local (or if you're on holliday, the beach) area where divers
   Hang out and dive/explore and plant the bottle Underwater somewhere,
   in a place where it can be seen easily, and attract a Diver's attention.
5) WAIT for the Fun and Fireworks.

Just what the hell does this sucker do anyways?:

Whats happening here is Simple, Potassium is a chemical that burns with air
and EXPLODES when comes in contact with  water.  The Oil Removes all the Air
from the jar as so the Potassium will not Burn and waste the Bomb. The
Shiny object or trinket is there merely to make the diver interested enough
in the Jar as to Open it.

Because OIL is LIGHTER than WATER, the oil floats away, and the water rushes
into the jar and hits the Potassium. Now, we all know what happens to the
Potassium when the ater hits it. By Bye Mr. Scuba Diver. Have PHUN!

dead chicken.  Well, let me explain first with the breif history of the 
chicken:

A year or so ago (1990), it occured to me that while people frequently 
spoke of Cat Bombs and the like, nothing new had come out in quite a while
in this area.  And I have a need to be origional.  Also, liking my cat, I
did not like the idea of exploding feliones.

However, I have a DEEP and NUTURED hatred for Chickens, thus, the 
LIVE dead chicken was born!  You will find this 'recipe' is also an 
effective weapon - read on to see.


THE REAL SHIT
-------------

There are two versions of the LIVE dead chicken.  The first is effective, but 
its much weaker.  The second is MUCH more powerfull.

Ok, now, here is what all y'all people FUCKED UP 'nuff to try this (like me)
will need:

1  Chicken.  It is best that the chicken be alive, or atleast recently dead,
   however, a (un)frozen whole chicken will suffice with lesser results.

   Several film canisters and/or any other smallish container.

   A generous supply of Red phosphorus and Sodium Chlorate.

   Sewing materials and/or Industial stapler

   Duck Tape

   Knife and other blunt instuments.



All right.  Now that you have run about collecting everything, we start the 
fun.

Assuming you have a live chicken, You will now need to end is filthy
life.  Holding it down and making a lenghtways incision up its belly
is functional, but not so fun.  I recomend beatting it a bit first and
various other stupid things that come to mind are always fun.
We ALL know its fun to cut their heads off, but don't.  Makes the bomb
non-functional.  Do that with another chicken tomorrow.

Now that the chicken is dead we need to worry about explosives.
In the weaker recipe (still not too weak), we use a sodium chlorate mixture.
This particular mix is IMPACT sensitive, so BE CAREFULL OUT THERE!
Anyway, mix the red phoshorus and sodium chlorate in 1:1 proportions
and fill whatever containers you have chosen.  The containers should then
sealed and taped with duck tape.

At this poin you MAY want to hurl a container of the explosive at something a 
little way away so you know how well you made the mix, and what you are 
getting into.  Play with them and see exactly how hard an impact they need,
thus, you will not accidently blow you face off.

Now, you will have to make a judgement call.  I recomend taking SOME guts out
to fit more canisters of explosive in.  See, the guts cusion impact thus
making the chances of explosion less likely. I recomand a small amount of
inards be removed an a rock be added in with the explosives.  BUT, I leave
this to your discretion.

Once you have every conceivable item inside the chicken (you could even leave
a message in a steel container!) you will want to sew up ALL holes in the chicken.
Sewing should be done well, ie: stiches less that 3mm apart, for best effect.
You may noe tape up the chicken a bit.  It help the blast, but dont tape
too much - you want the feathers free!


Basically, what you now have is an impact projectile.  Drop/throw the sucka
and you get fireworks!

Now you see the beauty of this 'grenade'.  You can FUCK someone up with it
in is powerfull forms, AND people will LAUGH!  Imagine the hummilation
of dying from a Chicken bomb!  Lying dead as the feathers settle around 
corpse!  heh, Also, one gets a good chance at a get-away.  People tend to 
stand transfixed wondering why a chicken exploded - or why the exposion
put feathers everywhere, and whether the guts on themself are the chickens 
or from a victim.  NO ONE will be paying attention to you most of the time!


Even better - terrorism and assassanation.  WHO would stop someone with a 
chicken??  You can carry this explosive pretty well anywhere with only a few
odd looks!

booooooooOOOOOOOOM !
--------------------

Now I will introduce the 'alternate' LIVE dead chicken ideas.

The following is the LIVE dead chicken but MUCH more powerfull:

Astrolite G is a form of ROCKET FUEL.  It has a detonation velocity of
8600mps (meters per second) while TNT only packs 6900mps!
Now, astrolite g is made by:
mixing 2 parts by weight ammonia nitrate with 1 part anhydrous hydrazine.
This will make a clear liquid explosive!  Note, you can spill this shit
on the grass - have it rain - come back 4 days later - it'll still blow up.

SO, ya pack a canister or two of this (maybe even a plastic lunch baggie)
with the rest of the explosive, and your BOOM is MUCH bigger.

I have also receive suggestions for the NAPALM CHICKEN.  In this one would
replace the explosives with a full plastic baggie of Joy and gasoline[Ed:
or your favorite napalm recepie ], and place several ammonia pellets in the
chicken.  When the bag breaks - there should be much napalm!  This sorta
defeats the purpose of having a chicken with feathers.... but napalm is fun.
Especially when used in combonation with several unsuspecting police
officers.

                        BRAIN TO COMPUTER HOOKUP


Baltimore Local Paper - Harry - October '91

This paper MYSTERIOUSLY dissapeared after this issue was published.. [Ed:
Thanks IBIX ]

BEGIN _|

How would you like to recall what you thought as you were being born? A new
computer, being tested in Cupertino CA, connected to your brain and is able
to print out your entire memory. Every fact and feeling you have
experienced thorought your lifetime will be avaliable to you with the push
of a button.

Hideo Masayama, Japans leading computer designer, unvailed plans for the
device at this years computer expo in Yolkahama. The only catch is that, in
order to have this information avaliable to you, you must have a small plug
installed in your head. Masayama demonstrated the ease with which the
device is used once the emplant has been installed, by plugging a small
connector into a recepticle behind his own ear, and punching up the year
1948 on his computer. In an instant, his printer was in furious operation,
spewing out page after page of information, some of which was passed out to
the media in attendance. The scientist, who was 22 in 1948, talked to the
assembled press conference while the printout was in progress, and didn't
show any ill effects from the tap on his brain. The first printout page
passed out to the media had to do with his first day on the job at a
construction site where he worked while attending graduate school. The page
dated April 22, 1948, was in chronological order, according to the time of
day. "6 am.," it read. "Awake to terror and depression about first day on
job. Can't get out of bed. Can't get out of bed.

"6:04 am: Get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. Feel sad, because I know
I am too intelligent for this construction job, but since americans bombed
us into submission, can't find anything else. Hope to god, country can pull
out of it, so I can become the scientist I know I can be."

The printout went on to chronicle all the feelings and experiences of the
day.

"Clearly, this is a breakthrough unlike any other we have ever seen.", said
Masayama. "I am not going to share with you my birth memories, but I will
pass among you copies of a womans memories of her own birth. Her identity
is to remain, however, anonymous."

The womans birth memory printout began with the first light she shaw when
emerging from the woumb. It read, in part, "Dim light, brighter, brighter.
BLINDING LIGHT!! DANGER!! DANGER!! MEN!! WOMEN!! HANDS!! Hands holding me.
CUTTING ME!! DANGER!! DANGER!! THEY HAVE CUT MY CORD!! OH MY GOD!! THEY CUT
MY CORD!! WAKING ME!! BLOOD!! BLOOD!! FEAR!! FEAR!! PAIN!! PAIN!! TERROR!!
TERROR!! Wrapping me! Giving me to my mother. Oh, oh to be with my mother,
my mother."

Dr. Masayama claims that this process will teach people much mor about
themselves and their minds then they ever knew before. So many mental
ilnesses, he says, are caused by repressing bad things that happened to us,
and then having the bad memories come out in other harmful ways. If we
understand what has happened to us in the past, from birth to the present,
we have a head start in understanding what makes us tick, and what does
not. When asked about the operation to emplant the receptacle in the skull
Masayama described the procedure as simple. "No problem, really. We shave
an eighth inch of your hair behind the ear, and then drill a tiny hole in
the head directly to the brain."

The operation takes an hour, and can be done in a doctors office. The only
problem is that it's difficult to find a doctor experienced enough to do
the drilling, since the probe goes into the skull several inches deep, and
connects directly to the brain. "This is a problem at the present, but we
feel this is going to become so popular it will be as avaliable as ear
peircing."

Aside from the deep dark secrets locked up in our memories, which this will
let us in on, the computer brain memory printout has it's practical side.
"Forgetting simple everyday things will be a thing of the past. Where you 
left your car keys, a forgotten telephone number, an important paper you
locked away? All of these things can be called up from the computer with
the push of a button."

Some experts are predicting that printouts of the partners involved will be
required to be avaliable to all persons getting married. They must be
required in some business deals, and there is worry that wives might plug
into husbands brians in order to check up on their sexual activity. The
future for brain computer memory devices is expected to be unlimited, and
could spell the end to civilisation as we know it. Think about it.

Dr. Masayama says the device could be on the market in time for valentines
day.

    Well, to wrap up for this issue, I'd basically like to say Thank You.
It's been a SHITTY year, but thank you anyways. Y'see, however shitty, it 
has allowed me to be exposed to more cruelty, feel more emotions, taste more
flavours of life, and be more people than any other year has.

    It's time to settle down. Time to understand the cruelty, explore the
emotions, savour the flavour, and be myself. I finally love myself..
because however much i search for myself, I haven't the foggiest idea who i
am.

    I know who the rest of these people are though.. [signing off.. TX]
