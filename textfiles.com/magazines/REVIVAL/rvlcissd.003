=========================================================================
THE CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR SOCIAL DEVIANCY    MAY (C) 1993/94
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Once again, the frog has overestimated our stupidity. Surely we will
not fall for the same trick twice.

     We have learned a few things about frogs. They don't have very much
to do.  They're  rather bored most of the time,  but they impress you by
breathing a lot of hot air out of their lungs, and then they sit quietly
in order to lure you in.  They smell funny, but it's one of those smells
you have to  sniff again to make sure that your  nose didn't decieve you
the first time.

     If you  lick  a toad,  you get high,  but  frogs are  not toads,  so
everyone  sucking up to a  frog finds out shortly that  it's not all it's
cracked up to be, and generally leaves it be.. it's smell was unappealing
in the first place.

     You can  buzz about trying to find  a place to observe the frog,  in
order that you might protect yourself from its self serving, greed driven
actions,  but when the frog  thinks you are  sitting pretty,  he tries to
aggrivate you again.  If you are silly enough to become aggrieved  by his
mischeivous  tactics,  he will  stick out his  tounge,  and  swallow  you
whole.

     For once, a group of flies, known as CiSSD, has outwitted a group of
amphibians,  who for  the most  part,  aren't  frogs,  but all  wish they
were. We learned the only way to get high from a frog is to smoke him.

     But we flies don't need to get high.. I think we can be content with
removing his  lilly pad..  He will  no longer be part  of this  amphibian
community.

     [No one will appreciate  this as much  as those who  are involved in
the war against the evil frog.  Entertainment for your efforts.  Thanks a
lot guys..  Zap the Frog, rejoin the scene when you grow up.  For now you
are only a tadpole.]

     Due to the hustle and bustle of a busy  end of school term,  some of
our regular columns were forced to flee. 'NEWS AND NATTERINGS OF THE DOPE
MAN' will  most definately  be back for  next issue,  and will  more than
probably be joined by 'NEWS BYTES (and usually bites too!)'.

     Despite  these  ommisions,  we hope  sincerely that  you enjoy  this
issue.  After all, some things may come and go in waves, but the computer

      ---=[ ANONYMOUS LETTER re: ABUSE IN THE HOME AND SCHOOL ]=---
                          (Edited for Clarity)

  The look at school system as being a  negative aspect in kids lives was
obviously  a  biased one by  a disgruntled teenager  who doesn't have the
ability to look  at the whole picture.   I'll give you  credit for seeing
the problem as  being the parents.  The whole problem lies  in the homes.
These so  called disceplinary actions at high schools  are those a person
would face in everyday life, so I say GET  USED TO IT! And to answer your
question, it is the  parents jobs! It is not the job  of a highly trained
teaching  professional  to  teach   common  manners  in  a   high  school
enviornment!

     I would like to point out that the  article had many good points and
the point of parental expectations in school, is an excellent one!  I can
not count the  times a  parent  has come  in saying I  should be  doing a
better job!  Like what[?] Go home and make  the damn  student do  his/her
homework! I can't make a student do  his/her work[.] It's motivation[that
is needed!]  I remember  when a  good education  and  having your parents
proud of you was motivation enough. You'll make a good adult TX[.] I hope
you remember the things you know now when you have your own kids.

  P.S

-  Blame  the  government [that] we're  underfunded and  can't afford the
   extra support personel we would all like for the new generation.


                        --- Editors Response ---

     You are perfectly right to refer to me as a disgruntled teenager.  I
think, however, that I do have the ability to look at the whole picture..
I simply chose not to. That was clearly a serious error on my part.

     I feel  that,  maybe  not the whole  problem,  but  at least a large
proportion of the problem lies in the homes.  A good chunk of the problem
would  be  solved  if  parents  made  a concious  effort  to  control the
environmental variables that are in their hands.

     It is not the teachers responsibility to teach discepline at school,
but because it seems so neccesary,  and because children are so neglected
in  their  homes,  I  feel  that  the  school system,  given  appropriate
government  funding,  should take  a different  approach to  training the
large  majority of  students  who have  no motivation,  and little  self-
respect.

     Although I believe I  was reffering to  parents  expectations of the
_students_ in my article,  it is also very true that parents expectations
of _teachers_ are also quite ridiculous in many cases. My own mother used
to always blame my teachers for anything I would do wrong.  I allowed her
to, because I had no reason to want to take the blame myself,  but due to
this long period of time  when I took no responsibility,  I later had(and
am  still having)  trouble disceplining myself  to work effeciently,  and
productively.  At this  stage in  my life,  most of my  school grades are
borderline failing due,  not to any fault of  my teachers,  but to my own
lack of motivation, and my own lack of self discepline.

     I still feel that proud parents,  and achievement in school might be
enough motivation  to continue doing well,  but it's up to the parents to
give their  children a  kick-start at  an early age,  so that  they might
continue to maintain their pride in achievement later on in life.

     I still haven't  ranked myself as  being responsible  enough to have
kids.  Maybe when I'm  significantly older,  or  at least,  more mentally
developed,  and able to meet the challenges that modern society places on
parents,  I will  reconsider.  Too many  parents,  unfortunately,  assume
that bringing up children is easy.

     Finally (as this  is rather a long response),  the government should
indeed be blamed  for underfunding.  The problems that I continually pick
at in the  educational system  would be  solved if  any one  school had a
complete,   full   time  staff..   including  the   neccesary   teachers,
councillors,  and administrators  it takes to help the children who don't
get a fair shake at home.

           ---=[ Split Adrenalyn's LETTER re: REVIVAL #2 ]=---

     Well,  I just finished reading Revival  Issue #002 and I have to say
that  it's the best  "underground" mag I've  EVER read.  The articles are
well written,  discussing topics that we all can relate to,  the articles
pose questions which  I'm sure many of us have all asked  ourselves about
whatever topic.

     It's also not the same old underground mag  (it doesn't have a whole
bunch  of  TEXT  files put  together  into an  "issue"),  but more  of an
information mag, giving you the insight to the PHAC scene.

     Good job on this one guys, when's #003 coming?


                        --- Editors Response ---

     Well, it's here!  Assuming that I'm  sticking to any deadlines,  the
magazine will be released on the last saturday of every other month.  The
deadline for  submissions by non-CiSSD members  to REVIVAL! magazine will
be two weeks before the release date.

     Thanks for  the glowing  compliments.  While I  doubt they're  fully
deserved,  it is  true  that the  magazine is  more than a bunch of  text
files.  I think that  most CiSSD  members  take a  special  pride in  the
magazine,  as it acts as a forum for us to air  our views to  the public,
and the public to air their views to  the rest of the public!  It is very
important that we  have an appeal to everyone,  from some  perspective or
another.. We will continue to be political, and provocative.

                        TELEKOM STUPIDITY REVEALED
                                  Lister

This week's "Research and Technology" section of the German news magazine
{Focus} (Nr. 17/93, pg. 106)  features an *interesting* article about the
German telephone network.

According to the article all you need to tap into another phone line is a
phone line which is hooked up to  a modern digital switch and a simple 16
key touch tone beeper. The article shows the original TELEKOM beeper. For
interested  users, {Focus} included  the TELEKOM  reorder number  and its
approval ID.

By dialing one of the special "A","B","C" or "D" keys (rightmost column),
you get acces to TELEKOMs switch testing facilities. After you are in the
testing system, you have to enter a three-digit switch id. Then enter the
phone  number you wish to  call or listen to.  If the phone line is busy,
then just enter "1" and you will have a *forced* three way call.

With  a  modem or  any other  computer controlled  dialing devices  it is
rather simple to find the available switch ids in several hours.

Since  the testing  facility will  identify itstelf  by sending  a rather
loud test tone,  most persons will  find  out,  that  there is  something
strange  going on,  if they  are tapped  by someone.  But there  are also
others that will never take much care about this situation.

Isn't it STUPID that TELEKOM  apparently  has NOT  learned anything  what
happend around  20++  years within  the USA with the  blue/red/ ... boxes
that gave interested users nice and mostly free features?

This time you even do not need any *illegal* devices, but a rather common
and widely available touch tone beeper give you full control over several
local switches!

As elementary mathematics shows,  any additional key to press would lower
the chance by 1 to 16  to get access to such a  testing system.  It would
have been  so simple  to hide  the access  code to  this system  within a
normal number range.  If that  number would have been  changed regularly,
then nobody would ever get access to it. But these measures require work,
and that seems to be hard for a monopoly company!

                         POLITICS AND THE HACKER
                              The Dictator

   Everyone  reading  this magazine has  a reason  to do  it..  for their
freedom may depend on it.   Why, you ask?  Because you  are dealing  with
the Cyberpunk Realm of fantasy, virtual reality, and revolution.  Fantasy
is  apparant  with  every hacker  or cyberpunk  reading this  article and
imagining the possibilities of  society and technology,  working together
towards perfect harmony--or anarchy, the Virtual Reality of a world where
no one's money  is their own,  where people are not  more than the sum of
their words as they flicker past on your screen,  where personality is no
more than  who  you can  impress with your extended vocabulary  or "K-Rad
K00lness."

   However,  another aspect is not so obvious,  but it is there,  perhaps
more than any other.  We, as hackers, phreakers, cyberpunks etc. have the
want,  the burning desire  to change the world into  a place that we have
all had a glimpse of, The 'New World' of the 90's, so to speak.
   
   The underground is  not a happy  place.  It is  a place where  one can
obtain  seemingly  endless  flows  of  information,  but  where  one must
constantly be  prepared to show  up a counterpart,  and to deal with  the
obligations of group affiliation, the backbone of the Underground.
   
   It's  all  for  status,  for  knowledge,  for  power.  But  the power,
ultimately, is for the change of OUR lives, for the change of our ability
to control what will become of the future. it is SO enticing that we may,
at times,  forget that the methods we  use are  the methods  we have  all 
strived to pull away from:  Commercialism, and Capitalism.  We attempt to
use all means necessary to  amass  power,  power  which  will  ultimately
affect our future for the better.
   
   We do this by squeezing money,  time,  and belongings from the average
citizen, thereby undermining our very goals, for when we have amassed all
the power required,  and are ready to return to normal life,  we  will be
forced to  deal  with  the  same  CyberPunks who  were once  our  allies,
partners,  or even counterparts,  thereby, in the end,  succombing to the
realities of our ways, the same realities as Capatalism: the reality that
there is NO escape.
   
   It does NOT have to be that way,  however!  We have all seen the world
in which we  all work together to  further a common cause,  to accomplish
certain tasks. We all know the power of the underground. we all know that
the power  held by  each  individual,  if  harnessed,  would  produce  an
invaluable machine for change.
   
   We NEED to pull together. CiSSD has created a group whose purpose lies
in the free-flow of  information, and we  consistantly work  towards that
goal.  We all know  what can be,  if we only try.  In Toronto,  Canada in
early may,  the working class held a  march on parliment hill demanding a
reform.  If this was  backed by  the  prowess  of  every  hacker  in  the
underground,  we would have a message that could be heard EVERYWHERE  the
telephone or computer screen reached!
   
                  What we need is ORGANIZED REVOLUTION!

   The Great Dope Man put it best when  he remarked that "Deviency is its
own reward."  Whether or not he realised it at the time,  this phrase had
the potential to  be  the  catalyst  for  the  greatest  revolution  ever
recorded.  Deviency,  the art of going against the norms  of society,  if
proctised by enough people with enough frequency,  WOULD become the norm,
thereby rewarding all who wished it with an altered standard of living.
   
   Now the only way to  ensure that this standard of  living would be for
the  better,  would  be to  have 'organized  deviency'  or  an  ORGANIZED
REVOLUTION.  One in which  the entire underground  drove  for  something,
putting all of our  amassed strength  against those  we hate  in society,
instead of one another. The potential is enormous.  We are not limited by
restrections  on  what  information we  can amass,  nor on  how far  this
information can be destributed.  We are not limited as to what aspects of
this Capatalist  world we live in we can gain control of.  We CAN  make a
difference!  We CAN change  our downward plummet  into extinction.  But a
CAPATALIST world will never be able to make  the changes,  as the changes
would be looked upon as inefficient or irrelevant. 
   

    We have the power in our HANDS! We now need only make use of it.
           For we have the reasons, just look into you paper.
 The time is Upon us, we must act. The WORLD calls for a change. It's our
    responsibility, because WE are the only people who can change it.

    HACKERS, PHREAKERS, CYBERPUNKS OF THE WORLD, UNITE TO BRING ABOUT
                          THE NEW WORLD ORDER!

               EMOTIONAL MATURITY, FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE!
                               Essence/TX

     Most  of my  articles are  provoked  by a real  life experience that
leads me to think about a topic from a completely  different perspective.
This one is  no different,  but I am quite  shocked and surprised  that I
haven't seen anyone take my perspective before.. and why?.. Maybe because
it's a confusing one.

     I've never been one to base decisions on age. I feel that generally,
age  is  an  unimportant  factor   when  deciding  what  privelidges  are
appropriate for  each individual.  More important than age,  is maturity.
Clearly, when it comes to this, 'The law is an ass'.

     Canadian law bases emotional maturity on  i) age and  ii) chasteness
of  character.  More notably,  the law states that  any female,  fourteen
years  or older,  who  has not  previously been  of chaste character,  is
emotionally  mature  enough  to make the decision  to have sex.  In plain
english,  this means that any girl age fourteen who acts like a whore can
be  taken advantage of.  Any girl  age fourteen who  acts decently is not
mature  enough  to  have sex.  Having sex  with any  girl age  14  to  18
inclusive who has behaved decently and with self respect, is rape.

     Despite  all the complaints  about males having to  worry about rape
charges, whether or not they rape a girl,  I think the laws pertaining to
rape are particularily flacid, and weak. There are clauses that shift the
responsibility of rape onto the victim  females if the  male can show the
female to have 'provoked' the incident. Are we in a day and age where sex
is  so important that  the male partner  can't  even take the  time to be
reasonably  sure  about  the emotional  stability,  and  maturity  of his
partner?

     Any  guy  who  justifies  his  sexual  activities  by  rattling  off
sex-laws,  and how they pertain to his case,  should be  removed from our
society. We don't need the inconsiderate. We don't need the low-lifes.

                               CYBERPUNK!
                              The Dictator

     The following article  was featured in TIME magazine.  I felt it was
an  accurate  portrayal   of  cyberpunks  in   the  computer  underground
community.

 BEGIN _|

   In the 50s it was the beatniks, staging a coffehouse rebellion against
the conformity of  America in the Eisenhower era.  In the 60s the Hippies
arrived,  combining anti-war activism with the energy of Sex,  Drugs, and
Rock'N'Roll.  Now a new  subculture is bubbling  up from the underground,
popping  up  from  computer  screens  around  the world  like a  piece of
hypertext.  
   
   It's  called  CYBERPUNK,  a  late - 20th  centure  term  derived  from
CYBERNETICS,  the  science  of communication  and control,  and PUNK,  an
antisocial rebel or hoodlum. 
   
   Within this odd pairing lurks the essence of CYBERPUNK's international
culture:  a way of looking  at the world  that combines infatuation  with
high-tech tools and disdain for conventional ways of using them.
   
   Origionally applied to a school of hard-boiled science-fiction writers
and then to certain  semi-tough computer hackers,  the word CYBERPUNK now
covers  a broad  range of  music,  art,  psychedelics,  smart  drugs  and
cutting-edge technology,  as well as the computer hacker who  laboriously
tries to put this new  subculture to work.  I have heard CYBERPUNK called
everything from "Technology with an Attitude" (Stewart Brand, Whole Earth
Catalog)  to  "An  unholy  alliance  of  the  technical  world  with  the
underground of  pop culture and  street-level  anarchy"  (Bruce Sterling,
Science-Fiction writer). 
   
   As in any counterculture movement,  some denziens  would deny they are
part of a movement at all.  Although the largest CYBERPUNK journal (PUNK!
Magazine) claims to have a readership  of 70 000,  there are  probably no
more  than  a  few   thousand  computer  hackers,  futurists,  phreakers,
computer-savvy  artists  and  musicians,   and  assorted  science-fiction
'geeks' on the planet who would actually call themselfes CYBERPUNKS.
   
   Nevertheless, this may be the  defining counterculture of the computer
age.   It  embraces,   in  spirit   at  least,   not  just   the  nearest
thirtysomething  hacker hunched  over a terminal,  but  also  nose-ringed
twentysomethings gathered at clandestine RAVES,  teenagers who feel about
the   Amiga  the   way  their   parents  felt  about  records,  and  even
preadolescent  VIDKIDS  fused  to their  SNES and  Genesis games  --  the
training of CYBERPUNK.
   
   Obsessed with technology,  CYBERPUNKS are  future-oriented to a fault.
CYBERPUNKS already have one foot in the 21st century, certain that in the
long run, everyone will be a CYBERPUNK.
   
   The CYBERPUNK look,  a kind of  science-fiction  surrealism tweaked by
computer graphics,  is finding its way into art galleries,  music videos,
and Hollywood  movies.  CYBERPUNK  magazines,  many cheaply  published or
distributed by electronic medium, are multiplying like cable-TV channels.
CYBERPUNK music is hot enough to keep several record companies and scores
of bands cranking out CD's.  CYBERPUNK oriented books  are snatched up as
soon as  they hit  the market.  And  CYBERPUNK  films  like  BLADERUNNER,
ROBOCOP,  VIDEODROME,  TOTAL RECALL,  TERMINATOR 2 and  THE LAWNMOWER MAN
have moved out of the cult market and into the mainstream.
   
   In the US (and therefore Canada), CYBERPUNK culture is likely to get a
boost from of all things, the Clinton Administartion,  due to his intrest
in  the  US's  "Data Highways"  and  what  the  CYBERPUNKS  refer  to  as
CYBERSPACE.  Both  terms  refer  to  the  globe-circling,  interconnected
telephone network  that is the conduit for  billions of voice,  fax,  and
data transmissions. This huge CYBERSPACE, the INTERNET,  stretches across
the atlantic,  touching down in Iceland,  and western Europe,  then on to
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. CYBERPUNKS look
at the wires  from the inside;  and talk of  the network as if it were an
actual  place,  a virtual  reality that  can be  entered,  explored,  and
manipulated.
   
   CYBERSPACE  playes  a  major  role in  the CYBERPUNK world  view.  The
literature  is  filled  with  'Console Cowboys' who  prove  themselves by
donning virtual realitry gear and  performing heroic feats in the imagery
'matrix' of CYBERSPACE. "CYBERPUNK",  a 1991 book,  features  profiles of
three canonical CYBERPUNK hackers,  including Robert Morris,  the Cornell
University student whose computer  virus brought the entire INTERNET to a
halt in 1988.
   
   However,  CYBERSPACE is more than a playground.  It's a medium.  Every
night on GEnie, Compuserve, and thousands of smaller BBSes, people by the
hundreds  of  thousands  are  logging  on  to  a great  computer-mediated
talkfest, an interactive debate that allows them to leap over barriers of
time, place nationality, sex, and social status.
   
   Most computer users are content to visit cyberspace now and then,  but
the CYBERPUNK goes there to live, and play, and even DIE. the WELL (Whole
Earth 'lectronic Link), an INTERNET site, was shaken 2 1/2 years ago when
one of  its  most  active participants  ran a  program that  erased every
message  he had ever left - it  involved thousands of posts - an act that
amounted to  virtual suicide.  A few weeks later he committed suicide for
real.
   
   The WELL has been  a magnet for  CYBERPUNK thinkers,  and the question
is,  is there  a CYBERPUNK  movement?  The WELL  launched a  freewheeling
campeign that ran for months and filled more than 300 pages of text.  The
debate  yielded,  among other  things,  a  concise list  of wants  of the
CYBERPUNK movement:

   INFORMATION  WANTS TO  BE FREE.  A  good  piece  of  information  will
eventually get into  the hands of thouse who can make the best use of it,
despite the best efforts  of censors,  copyright lawyers  and the  secret
service.

   ALWAYS YIELD TO THE HANDS-ON IMPERATIVE. CYBERPUNKS maintain that they
can run the world for the better, if they can only get there hands on the
control box.

   PROMOTE  CENTRALIZATION.  Society   is  splintering  into hundreds  of
subcultures and designer cults, which is a no-no.

   'SURF THE EDGES'.  When the world is  changing by the nanosecond,  the
best way to keep your head above the water is to stay at the front end of
the Zeitgeist.


   For CYBERPUNKS,  pondering history  is not  so important as  coming to
terms with the future.  For all the flaws,  they have found  ways to live
with  technology,  to  make it  theirs,  something  the  back-to-the-land
hippies never  accomplished.  CYBERPUNKS use the technology to bridge the
gulf between art  and science,  between  the world of literature  and the
world of industry.  Most of all,  CYBERPUNKS realize  that if  you didn't
control technology, it would eventually control you.  It is a lesson that
will serve CYBERPUNKS  -  and the rest of the world  - well into the next
century.

                          LASERPRINTER FORGERY
                                 Kryten

Most of us remember those pre-historic typewriter things.  If you do then
the  correction key that  some models had  was your best friend,  and can
be your best friend again.  That is the correctable (carbon film) ribbon.
The manual  warned against using  this ribbon for typing  legal documents
because undetectable alterations would be too easy.

Recently I heard a taped interview with Frank Abagnale, a reformed forger
who  now  advises  companies on  fraud  prevention.  It  was a  quite  an
interesting cassette.  This is where I tie in my first paragraph.

Abagnale said that output from most laserprinters and photocopiers can be
removed in  a  similar  manner with  correction  tape  because the  toner
powder,  like carbon film ribbon,  only sits on  the surface of the paper
but does not impregnate the fibers.  I tried it and he's right.

                                   ---

                CALLER ID INFORMATION AND SPECIFICATIONS
                                 Lister

     I know this  information may be  regarded as old hat, and that  it's
not  very   sensitive  in  nature;  but  it  makes  an  interesting  read
nonetheless.  Hopefully, it  will shed a bit of  insight as to  the inner
workings of Caller ID.


                              INTRODUCTION

     Calling Number Delivery (CND), better known as Caller ID, is a
      telephone service intended for residential and small business
      customers.  It allows the called Customer Premises Equipment
    (CPE) to receive a calling party's directory number and the date
    and time of the call during the first 4 second silent interval in
     the ringing cycle.  The customer must contact a Bellcore Client
                    Company to initiate CND service.

     According to Pacific Bell representatives, the following states
     and district currently support CND service:  Delaware, District
    of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
      Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
                  Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.

      The following states are scheduled to support CND service by
     April, 1992:  Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois,
      Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New
     York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island,
                           and South Carolina.

                               PARAMETERS

     The data signalling interface has the following characteristics:

     Link Type                     2-wire, simplex
     Transmission Scheme           Analog, phase-coherent FSK
     Logical 1 (mark)              1200 +/- 12 Hz
     Logical 0 (space)             2200 +/- 22 Hz
     Transmission Rate             1200 bps
     Transmission Level            13.5 +/- dBm into 900 ohm load

                                PROTOCOL

      The protocol uses 8-bit data words (bytes), each bounded by a
     start bit and a stop bit.  The CND message uses the Single Data
                       Message format shown below.

     Channel   Carrier   Message   Message   Data      Checksum
     Seizure   Signal    Type      Length    Word(s)   Word
     Signal              Word      Word

                         CHANNEL SEIZURE SIGNAL

      The channel seizure is 30 continuous bytes of 55h (01010101)
    providing a detectable alternating function to the CPE (i.e. the
                            modem data pump).

                             CARRIER SIGNAL

    The carrier signal consists of 130 +/- 25 mS of mark (1200 Hz) to
                    condition the receiver for data.

                            MESSAGE TYPE WORD

       The message type word indicates the service and capability
    associated with the data message.  The message type word for CND
                           is 04h (00000100).

                           MESSAGE LENGTH WORD

    The message length word specifies the total number of data words
                               to follow.

                               DATA WORDS

     The data words are encoded in ASCII and represent the following
                              information:

     o  The first two words represent the month
     o  The next two words represent the day of the month
     o  The next two words represent the hour in local military time
     o  The next two words represent the minute after the hour
     o  The calling party's directory number is represented by the
        remaining  words in the data word field

     If the calling party's directory number is not available to the
    terminating central office, the data word field contains an ASCII
     "O".  If the calling party invokes the privacy capability, the
                 data word field contains an ASCII "P".

                              CHECKSUM WORD

    The Checksum Word contains the twos complement of the modulo 256
     sum of the other words in the data message (i.e., message type,
      message length, and data words).  The receiving equipment may
     calculate the modulo 256 sum of the received words and add this
     sum to the reveived checksum word.  A result of zero generally
       indicates that the message was correctly received.  Message
                    retransmission is not supported.

                     EXAMPLE CND SINGLE DATA MESSAGE

    An example of a received CND message, beginning with the message
                           type word, follows:

     04 12 30 39 33 30 31 32 32 34 36 30 39 35 35 35 31 32 31 32 51

     04h=      Calling  number  delivery  information code  (message type
               word)

     12h=      18 decimal; Number of data words (date,time, and directory
               number words)

     ASCII 30,39= 09;
          September

     ASCII 33,30= 30;
          30th day

     ASCII 31,32= 12;
          12:00 PM

     ASCII 32,34= 24;
          24 minutes (i.e., 12:24 PM)

     ASCII 36,30,39,35,35,35,31,32,31,32= 6095551212;
          calling party's directory number (609) 555-1212

     51h= Checksum Word

               DATA ACCESS ARRANGEMENT (DAA) REQUIREMENTS

      To receive CND information, the modem monitors the phone line
    between the first and second ring bursts without causing the DAA
    to go off hook in the conventional sense, which would inhibit the
       transmission of CND by the local central office.  A simple
     modification to an existing DAA circuit easily accomplishes the
                                  task.

                           MODEM REQUIREMENTS

    Although the data signalling interface parameters match those of
       a Bell 202 modem, the receiving CPE need not be a Bell 202
    modem.  A V.23 1200 bps modem receiver may be used to demodulate
    the Bell 202 signal.  The ring indicate bit (RI) may be used on a
        modem to indicate when to monitor the phone line for CND
     information.  After the RI bit sets, indicating the first ring
      burst, the host waits for the RI bit to reset.  The host then
         configures the modem to monitor the phone line for CND
                              information.

     According to Bellcore specifications, CND signalling starts as
    early as 300 mS after the first ring burst and ends at least 475
                     mS before the second ring burst

                              APPLICATIONS

    Modem manufacturers will soon be implementing new modem features
         based on CND information as this service becomes widely
                               available.

        Once CND information is received the user may process the
                    information in a number of ways.

     1.   The date, time, and calling party's directory number can be
          displayed.

     2.   Using a look-up table, the calling party's directory number
          can be correlated with his or her name and the name
          displayed.

     3.   CND information can also be used in additional ways such as
          for:

               a.  Bulletin board applications
               b.  Black-listing applications
               c.  Keeping logs of system user calls, or
               d.  Implementing a telemarketing data base

                               REFERENCES

         Bellcore publications TR-TSY-000030 and TR-TSY-000031.

                       THE DIATRIBES OF GRAPPLING
                              The Grappler

         "My non-existence never bothered me before I was born."

     Grappler Speaks:

     From the electronic wilderness,  As I look  down upon the scene with
dismay a question formulates within the depths of my conscious reasoning:
What the hell is going on?   All I see is the senseless  leeching of text
files,  etc.  So you've got all this info on pbx,  freemasonry,  virus's,
etc.   but what good is it if  it only ends up on some disk,  never to be
read again?   What are we really  trying to  accomplish here?   I mean so
what if you can call long distance for  free via some pbx if you only use
that pbx to call your friends, etc.   Do you think that BELL really cares
if you hack  someone's calling card?   They only benifet from the average
phreaks  activities  and you are just playing  into their game,  and they
only tend  to prosecute when activities  get out of hand and the customer
catches on that  some 15 yr. old  computer devotee just  charged $1000 on
his/her calling card.

     What is the gain in  this situation?  The only winning party is Bell
and no one  besides!  This brings me to my point,  everything you do must
be oriented towards a specific goal by  which you as a person will profit
by.  Now when I say profit,  I am not just referring to the materialistic
sense of the word,  I am also  talking about the  spiritual and emotional
aspects of this as well.

One of the #1 rules of Grappling is:

              "Strive for the Infinite in all that you do."


     It is upon this law that all of  grappling hangs so therefore we can
say that it is a solid foundation upon which to build from. Now what this
means is  that in  order to  get anywhere  in this lifetime,  one must be
prepared  to  always  sacrifice  the  lower  for  the  higher.  One  must
carefully weigh every  move and make sure that  any actions will not be a
regression to any  previous plane of existence.  A classic  demonstration
of this principle is as follows:  (Fantasy)

     You sign a pact with the devil which states that he will provide you
with 1 million dollars in exchange for your soul.  You being an average
person consent, you end up spending all of the money within a years time
and going broke.  With this abrupt end to your material wealth comes the
sudden realization that you have nothing left to sell.

     So as you can see,  as illustrated above  one must always ascend the
planes and never ever move down as you may end up stuck there!

     Now I realize that the illustration above is not a very good example
of how one may apply this theory to  everyday living but I think that you
get the gist of it.  (I hope)

     I believe that our time on earth is far too limited and we must take
advantage of every single second that we are alive. Conformity is for the
weak  and  those  who  fall  into  society 's  trap are  as lambs  to the
slaughter.  By this I am not saying that one must deliberatley go out and
break the law but what I  am saying is that if you  always play according
to  societies rules then you  are just wasting time.  Let's  look  at the
average persons life:

            birth -> school -> marriage/kids -> job -> death.

     Now  this  is not necessarily  in the stated order  and there may be
some deviancy from this projection but not by any significant margin.  So
as  you can see  nothing that the  average  person does is really  of any
importance other than the obvious procreation bit.  Now you may object to
this statement and if you do  then I welcome a debate but if  you look at
this from an unbiased viewpoint and  step out of the confines of everyday
thinking you will come to realize that the only thing that really matters
in the end is death.  This is a  rather morbid statement but if you think
about it:  Death is a fact of life  and therefore something which must be
confronted everyday,  death makes everything that we do irrelevant and in
the end the average joe's life has amounted to a 15 minute eulogy that no
one really cares  about anyway.  So you may  be right now  sitting before
your computer screen with a look of "what the fuck is going on here, this
guy is baked!".  How does this pertain to you  or fit into the context of
this  article?   Well I'll  tell you:  What  I am trying to  do with this
article  is  to  make you  analyze  things very  acutely,  I want  you to
scrutinize  every action you take  from this  point forward,  and realize
that any action that  you do take should be  in conformance with your own
will.  If you commit an  action against your own  personal will then  you
are stepping back into the chaos that is society and well on  your way to
becoming a slave.

                  "Your all a bunch of FUCKING SLAVES!"
                              *Jim Morrison

     So applying  this to computers and  the point of this article,  it's
all  fine and dandy to download thousands  of text files on  HPACV but is
this all that  the scene is about?  Are we  merely content with  this?  I
for  one  am  not  and  actively  utilize  my  HPACV knowledge  to attain
information  that the average  person is not even  aware exists.  Why let
those in  control  reap  the rewards  of the  slavedog morality  which is
society when you can have a  piece of the  pie to?  Computers practically
run the  world or  at least  play a sizeable role  in wordly  affairs and
therefore  it  would be  safe to  assume  that  if you  own one  then you
probably  have access to the  same.  Organization is the key and  that is
why I have recently applied to  CiSSD in the  hopes that  membership will
raise  me up  to bigger  and  better  things as  opposed to  just being a
spectator as most are.

     Now, I have  noticed that there  is alot  of interest  in conspiracy
among  the  members  of the  local boards,  well so  what  if there  is a
conspiracy because what can we really do about it if there is?  Awareness
is only 1/8 of the  big picture,  what I am saying is that why not create
your own conspiracies?


     "I don't know about you but I'm gonna have my kicks before the
                 whole shithouse goes up in flames man!"
                              *Jim Morrison


     I feel that I have rambled on incoherently long enough,  I know this
article  has  jumped around alot  but that is  merely a reflection  of my
frustrated  state of  mind.  I feel very  strongly about all that  I have
said and will accept with open arms any criticisms,  flak,  etc for these
views.  I have chosen to embrace  this life with unbending  determination
to achieve something of significance, have you?  This ends the diatribe.

                                   ---

Here guys (and gals), this  is a nice  little article by Dorothy Denning,
and it may be of interest  to you.  Quite a frightening prospect if you'd

 Subject: THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
 Date: 19 Apr 93 18:23:27 -0400
 Organization: Georgetown University


     The  following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used,
how  programming of  the  chip  is  coupled  to key  generation  and  the
escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.

     Since there has been some  speculation on  this news group  about my
own involvement  in this project,  I'd like to add that  I was not in any
way involved.  I found out about  it when the FBI briefed  me on Thursday
evening,  April 15.  Since then I have  spent  considerable time  talking
with the  NSA and FBI to learn  more about this,  and I attended the NIST
briefing  at  the  Department  of  Commerce  on  April 16.  The  document
below is the result of that effort.

INTRODUCTION

On April 16,  the  President announced  a new initiative  that will bring
together the Federal  Government and industry in  a voluntary program  to
provide  secure  communications  while  meeting  the  legitimate needs of
law  enforcement.  At  the  heart of  the  plan  is  a  new  tamper-proof
encryption  chip  called the  "Clipper Chip"  together with  a  split-key
approach to escrowing keys.  Two escrow  agencies are used,  and the  key
parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key.

CHIP STRUCTURE

The  Clipper  Chip   contains  a  classified   64-bit   block  encryption
algorithm called  "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses  80 bit keys  (compared
with 56 for the DES) and has  32 rounds of  scrambling (compared  with 16
for the  DES).  It  supports all  4 DES  modes of  operation.  Throughput
is 16 Mbits a second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key  that unlocks all messages  encrypted with the
      chip.

ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the  chip is  used, imagine  that it  is embedded in  the AT&T
telephone  security device  (as it will be).  Suppose  I call someone and
we both  have such a  device.  After pushing a  button to start  a secure
conversation,  my  security device will  negotiate a  session key  K with
the device  at the  other end  (in  general, any  method of  key exchange
can be used).  The key  K and  message stream M  (i.e.,  digitized voice)
are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

The  law enforcement  block  thus contains  the session  key K  encrypted
under  the  unit  key  U  concatenated  with  the  serial number  N,  all
encrypted under the family key F.

CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All  Clipper  Chips  are   programmed  inside  a  SCIF  (secure  computer
information  facility),  which   is   essentially  a   vault.   The  SCIF
contains a  laptop computer  and equipment to  program the  chips.  About
300 chips are programmed during a single  session.  The  SCIF is  located
at Mikotronx.

At the  beginning of a  session,  a trusted  agent from  each  of the two
key escrow agencies enters  the vault.  Agent  1 enters an  80-bit  value
S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters  an 80-bit value S2.  These  values
serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.

To generate the  unit key for a serial  number N,  the 30-bit  value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit  block to  produce a  64-bit  block  N1.
S1  and S2  are  then used  as keys  to  triple-encrypt  N1,  producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other  34-bit  blocks to  produce N2  and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2,  and R3  are then  concatenated together,  giving 192  bits.  The
first  80 bits  are assigned  to U1 and  the second  80 bits to  U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The  unit key U is  the XOR  of U1  and U2.  U1  and
U2 are the key parts  that are  separately escrowed  with the  two escrow
agencies.

As a  sequence of  values for  U1,  U2,  and  U are  generated,  they are
written  onto three  separate floppy  disks.  The  first disk  contains a
file for  each serial  number that  contains  the corresponding  key part
U1.  The second disk  is similar but  contains the U2  values.  The third
disk contains  the unit  keys U.  Agent  1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is  used to  program the  chips.
After the  chips are programmed,  all information  is discarded  from the
vault   and  the   agents  leave.   The  laptop   may  be  destroyed  for
additional assurance that no information is left behind.
 
The protocol  may be  changed  slightly so that  four people  are in  the
room instead of  two.  The first two would  provide the seeds  S1 and S2,
and the second  two (the  escrow agents)  would  take the  disks back  to
the escrow agencies.

The escrow  agencies have as yet to  be determined, but they will  not be
the NSA, CIA,  FBI,  or any  other law enforcement  agency.  One or  both
may be independent from the government.

LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When  law  enforcement  has  been  authorized to tap  an encrypted  line,
they will first  take the  warrant to  the service  provider in  order to
get access to  the communications  line.  Let  us assume that  the tap is
in place and that  they have determined that  the line is encrypted  with
Clipper.  They  will  first decrypt  the law  enforcement block  with the
family  key  F.  This  gives them  E[K; U] + N.   They will  then  take a
warrant  identifying the chip serial  number N to each of the  key escrow
agents  and  get  back  U1  and  U2.   U1  and  U2 are  XORed together to
produce the unit key U,  and  E[K; U]  is decrypted  to get  the  session
key  K.  Finally  the  message  stream  is  decrypted.  All this  will be
accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT  AND DISTRIBUTION  NOTICE.  All  information  is based  on
information  provided   by  NSA,  NIST,  and   the  FBI.   Permission  to
distribute this document is granted.

                             THE WHITE HOUSE
                      Office of the Press Secretary

     For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993

                    STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY

The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the
Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to
improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while
meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate
the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications
networks and wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private
sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension
between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting
Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes
competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement,
previous policies have pitted government against industry and the
rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect
electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to protect electronic
mail and computer files.  While encryption technology can help
Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of
personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers,
and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has been
developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a new approach
to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, relatively
inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary
telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption
algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and
prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically.  At
the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state
and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone
conversations of criminals.

A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the "Clipper
Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each
device containing the chip will have two unique "keys," numbers that
will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages
encoded by the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys
will be deposited separately in two "key-escrow" data bases that will
be established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be
limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no new
authorities to access the content of the private conversations of
Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney
General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices.  In
addition, respected experts from outside the government will be
offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess
its capabilities and publicly report their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the privacy
of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and
terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other approaches that can
both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they
need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal
activities.  In order to assess technology trends and explore new
approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed
government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption
that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy
rights of individuals as policy options are developed.

The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to
spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which
will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give
Americans unprecedented access to information.  This infrastructure of
high-speed networks ("information superhighways") will transmit video,
images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as today's
telephone system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role
in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to
develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use.  The
Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans'
right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the
law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  The
provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new encryption
technology are also available.

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE

Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.

                              Notes on 800
                              ------------

Where  local  telcos, such  as  Illinois  Bell offer  800  service,  they
purchase blocks of numbers from AT&T on prefixes assigned  to  AT&T. They
are free to purchase blocks of  numbers from any  carrier of their choice
however.

Often, exchanges of the form NN2  are used internally within an area code
or region,  such as 552 or 772 in  Saskatchewan,  or for intra-state use.
Specific  intra-state or  intra-provincial uses are not mentioned in this
document.

The information was updated according to carriers accessible from Canada.
As far as can be  determined,  only the AT&T, MCI and Sprint 800 services
are  accessible from  Canada  at present. However, 337 (assigned to First
Data Resources)  seems to be connected  to MCI. This  could be due to the
purchase  of some companies;  the prefixes  would  then be assumed by the
buyer.

N0X/N1X prefixes for 800 service are starting to appear. The first widely
known one is 800 used by  Sprint (as in 1 800 800 xxxx). This is the only
N(0/1)X prefix for 800 to be accessible from Canada at present.

                With the unquenchable thirst of an ocean
                  Death drinks of lifetimes in a flinch
                      I am but a cups worth of this
                   As meaningless as a glass of water
                    To know this is the mortal cross
                            we all must bear.

                              My Teddy Bear

                 Without my teddy bear, I cannot sleep.
                    I cannot breathe, or concentrate.
                   I cannot set my mind out straight,
                   but my teddy bear doesn't miss me.

                  Without my teddy bear, I cannot feel.
                     I play a game, I act in haste,
                   romantic thoughts are put to waste,
                   but my teddy bear doesn't miss me.

                  Without my teddy bear, I cannot see.
                  It's all pitch black, and in the day,
                    without a map, i've lost my way,
                   but my teddy bear doesn't miss me.

                 Without my teddy bear, I cannot smell.
                 There's no purfume, no sweet soft skin,
                       No hugs to be supported in,
                   but my teddy bear doesn't miss me.

                 Without my teddy bear, I cannot taste.
                     I cannot taste her loving kiss,
                    the interweaved celestial bliss,
                   but my teddy bear doesn't miss me.

                     My teddy bear, come back to me.
                    It sickens me to think you might,
                 alone and lost, be filled with fright,
                      and maybe, you might miss me.

                                 Victim

            Like ice, her cold heart controls her warm hands.
                        Inticing me to join her,
                        Inviting me to touch her,

               She melts my heart but inside she is cruel.
                      My face her hands carressing,
                       My body, hers is blessing.

            Intense her hatred runs right through her blood.
                       Her passion makes her sexy,
                      Her warm lips make her sexy.

               I enter her, and let my heart breathe fire.
                      My fire, and love exhausted,
                       yet she has just molested,

                             Another Victim.

                                 Lister

                  ERRATUM - CORRECTIONS FROM LAST ISSUE
                                 Essence

     Last issue got through the mill pretty well..  the errors were small
and  misplaced,   but  a  few  notable   errors  should   be  taken  into
consideration.

                         i. You Didn't Get Duped

     You weren't actually  given an  imitation file if  your filesize was
wrong..  the official  distribution copies  were screwed  around  in  the
quality  control phase,  and there  was a  discrepancy  in  the  official
distribution.  Here are  the reported,  and  actual  file  sizes  in  the
distribution copies.

                     REPORTED SIZE IN BYTES [119895]
                     ACTUAL SIZE IN BYTES   [120034]

     The byte size of the magazine  is reported in every issue(except for
the first)  so that we won't have  multiple distribution errors as we did
with the first issue.  It is a quality control measure.  Of course,  this
will not prevent  imitation files from spreading.  Anyone can fake a file
and  adjust  the file  size.  Zencor Technologies(tm)  has threatened  to
discredit us,  and we feel they may potentially  be a source of imitation
files.  We will  leave it up to  the reader to determine  if the magazine
lives up to the standards you have come to expect from CiSSD, and whether
it is therefore, a fake.

     If you want to  be sure to get  the real  deal every issue,  you can
download the official distribution version from the internet site:

           ftp  141.214.4.135  docs/zines/revival/rvlcissd.xxx

     where 'xxx' is the issue number.  ie: 'rvlcissd.003'.  If you do not
have internet access, then check 'Getting Revival', near the beggining of
this magazine for distribution sites.


                   ii. Voice Mail BBS date was WACkO!

     The projected date for the  Voice Mail BBS was somewhat unrealistic.
Several  CiSSD  members,  including myself,  are undergoing  geographical
repositioning  at  this time,  which  would make  it impossible to  run a
stable voice  mail.  This date  has been  corrected  in  this  issue,  to
September 1st 1993.

     The FAX date,  on the other hand,  accurate to  a week,  and the fax
line is now active.

 -                   REVIVAL: New Distribution Sites                  -
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Revival magazine  is looking for  new distribution sites  all over
 the world.  Requirements are not stringent.  Any board with a positive
 image,  a few megs of hard-drive space,  any hacking oriented  message
 base, and a knowledgable Sysop qualifies to be the first in its area.

     Revival issue #4 is on its way,  and we would like to set up sites
 for  distribution  right away.  Preffered  sites  are those  who  have
 access to Internet,  who can request  revival from  our internet  site
 automatically every other month.

     To apply  as a REVIVAL  distribution  site,  write  a  message  to
 annon08ea@nyx.cs.du.edu,  containing the password to an account by the
 name 'REVIVAL'. For a faster response, phone The Downtown Militarized
 Zone (+1 416 450 7087), and comment with your boards name and number,
 as well as the password to the 'REVIVAL' account, or finally, you can
 call voice to +1 416 417 0214, and have the same information handy.

                                ZEN WHAT?
                          The Dope Man/Essence

     Over the last  few months,  CiSSD has been  having a problem  with a
group  named  Zencor.  We  found it  rather disturbing  when we  recieved
several apologies, for Zencor's misjudging our intent, and specially when
we  stopped  recieving threats  from Zencor  members,  but all  the quiet
seemed  only to be a cover.  Now they've  gone and  thrown the  following
underground newsletter in our path.  Mind you,  they did TELL members not
to give it to  us,  but  unfortunately,  not  all of their members are as
intellegent as their leader Zoth The Frog,  and now we have  a chance for
rebuttle. Oh and, shhhh.. don't tell Zencor!


Z>                                     ZENCOR
Z>                                     ======
Z> 
Z>                   Progenerate Newletter Issue #1 : April 1993
Z>                   ===========================================

     Y'know,  that's  mighty interesting  Zoth.  I  clearly  remember you
lecturing  me on  how our  group was in  it's  infancy,  and  Zencor  was
experienced.  You told me about how Zencor was  King of the  Commodore 64
scene back  in the day and we would  die put up against a group with your
experience and knowledge.  Hrmm.. Issue #1?  Your first newsletter?..  Oh
that's because  you used to teleport  to group members houses right?  Tsk
Tsk.. I'd hate to think you were telling a fib!

Z>                    CiSSD Group Exposed As CanTel Informants!
Z>                    -----------------------------------------
Z>
Z> The Canadian International Society Of Social Deviancy, composed of
Z> Dope Man, Terminator X, and Lister, has been exposed as a group bent
Z> on causing legal troubles for various underground societies, including
Z> ZENCOR.

     Shoot!  How'd you find  out about this one?  BTW: It's  "Society FOR
Social Deviancy", but you don't have times to remember unimportant things
like that, Zoth A Frog.

Z> While Frog was in prison, members of ZENCOR (particularly ShortMan and
Z> Mystic Ruler) became friendly with these so-called hackers, and
Z> disclosed quite a bit of sensitive information to them.

     While  Frog was  in prison?  Oh yeah!  I remember when  you were  in
Juvinile  Hall  having your asshole  reamed*.  BTW,  you're group  wasn't
exactly freindly  with us,  but they  were as  nice as  you could  expect
anyoine to be to their babysitter.  Like you said Zoth A Frog, "They're a
bunch of fucking lamers, and you can babysit them if you want to". Sorry,
we're done babysitting for now.

     Sensitive  information?  Since  when  was your  Ex-Girlfreinds  name
considered  sensitive information?  BTW: She's a wonderful  person..  you
should take her out sometime!

Z> Suspicions on the part of high-level ZENCOR members lead to entry into
Z> the CiSSD VoiceMailBox.

     Suspicions on the part of your high-level Zencor member(s)?  Who are
they?  I mean,  I know there (is one)/(are some),  but who are they,  and
more importantly,  why?  By the way,  you're  the first  person  to  ever
penetrate  our voicemail  box.  I feel so raped.  I'm sure  you know  the
feeling, fluffy.

Z> A number of messages were intercepted and recorded.

     Congratulations.  Which amazing Zencor brand phone did you use to do
it? The 'Super ZencordaPhone II'?  What's the list price on that anyways?
$1580?  Oh. Out of my budget,  but since members pay to be in your group,
they get a 10% discount, right? How do I join?

Z> Amongst these were communications with a CanTel security
Z> officer. Apparantly this pig had apprehended CiSSD members (who were
Z> never overly adept at hacking activities) hacking VoiceMailBoxes for
Z> their own use.

     ... as opposed to for sale to the general public, like yours.

Z> There had been a deal arranged in which CiSSD members
Z> would inform the security officer (known as Bird Of Prey) of other
Z> hacker's activities in exchange for immunity. Frog extrapolates on
Z> this and theorizes, with supportive evidence that the thought-dead
Z> bunch of lamers (YAM) contracted CiSSD to "shut down rival groups".

     Aha!  And what supportive  evidence would  that be?  Really!  Please
write, and let me know.. more than likely this would be based on the same
supportive  evidence  that  showed santa  clause to  deliver presents  by
reindeer rather than via Federal Express.

Z> The following is a transcript of two of the most important messages
Z> intercepted:

     In order to improve readability, I will title them for you.

Message #1:
 
Z> Dope Man, I havn't talked to you in a while, not that I'm sick of you
Z> or anything. I enjoy the conference calling that you guys do. You guys
Z> blend together, did you know that? Here's today's give and take.
Z> Here's my take and I'll give you my give after. I was talking to
Z> someone at Metro 55 division today, fraud, and someone has been
Z> hacking into some additional VMBs, nothing new, but this time leaving
Z> threatening messages to customers. On a tip from Bell Security they
Z> are going to the home of [SHORT MAN]. I don't know if your eyebrows
Z> have lifted or not, but it happens that this guy is also blind. It
Z> happens that this guy is hacking into US networks and has done about
Z> thirty-five thousand in fraud. [SHORT MAN] is going to be in a lot of
Z> shit, the guys in the US want to prosecute. Mabye you want to chat
Z> with him a bit. That's between you and I. I'm gonna give you the VMB
Z> and the password to SATAN and STAR. The conversations you will hear
Z> are the result of me taking back their VMBs, much like I did with you
Z> guys, but these guys aren't as trusting. These guys are on the heavy
Z> metal/drug end from what I can tell.

     Now quickly,  before we go on,  lets take some time  to organize our
minds. What did Bird of Prey say in this message?

     GIVE                               TAKE
     ----                               ----

   - Password to a random Drugee's    - Request for us to talk to
     Voice Mail System.                 Short Man regarding his phone
                                        hacking.

     Shall we go on now then? Good.

Message #2:

Z> Bird Of Prey. Gotta like that. Satan has won the award for the
Z> stupidest non-paying subscriber ever at CanTel. So we've had to rub
Z> him out of the VMB hacking community for good. I was up till 1 last
Z> night, all he did was complain, calling me OPP, Rent-A-Cop, and I
Z> offered many times to do something and he kept saying "What's your
Z> game?". Well, he's toast, so goodbye. The total was about twenty-eight
Z> VMBs.

     Now let's summarize this message.  Bird Of Prey  wipes out the VMB's
belonging  to some hackers  because they wouldn't accept  the new ones he
was trying to give them, and he had to go to bed.

Z> Disgusting, isn't it?

     Oh, I'd say! Gawd forbid he should get some sleep! (?!)

Z> Now then, what is ZENCOR going to do about it?
Z> The following plan has been enacted:
Z> 
Z> 1) The RCMP has been dispatched to shut down all pirate CiSSD BBS
Z>    systems, with ZENCOR-obtained file and user lists, recorded
Z>    conversations and other evidence. All CiSSD computer equipment will
Z>    be confiscated and a number of criminal charges will be laid.

     Oh good!  Call the  police!  That's what  we should  have done,  but
you're the smarter hacking group..  only you would think of bringing  the
Canadian equivelant of the FBI into it!

     Only shutting down  the CiSSD pirate systems?  Oh!  BTW,  which ones
were those again?  If you could  let me know,  we'll  shut them down  for
you.

     Also, seing as you're so adept to taking down Pirate BBS's, I'm sure
that  you'll  have a great time getting access  to any in the next little
while.

Z> 2) CanTel management has been informed of their "double-agent". Bird
Z>    Of Prey will lose his fucking job.

     Well,  actually,  it's not a fucking job,  but coincidentally,  it's
rather close to yonge street.  Either way,  the fucking jobs are best out
on jarvis.. oh.. and watch me shiver as I take you seriously. Unlike you,
Bird of Prey still has a job.

Z> 3) Other groups have been informed of CiSSD's plans to harm them.

     Which would explain why they've been  posting in our network so much
recently.  I await  their  revenge.  BTW:  Are  these  the  plans  you've
SPECULATED we have to harm other groups?  Or  are these  the ones  I keep
hidden in  the cookie  jar,  underneath  the  section  carefully  labeled
'DOUBLE FUDGE' in red ink?

Z> 4) Everyone involved in or connected with CiSSD has been successfully
Z>    CN/Aed and all their personal information is on file.

     Successfully?  Wow!  I'm  impressed.  I was beggining  to think  you
didn't know how to speak to an operator in english.

Z> 5) All ZENCOR systems to which CiSSD has any knowledge has been shut
Z>    down completely.

     Actually, no. Would you like a list?

Z> Furthermore, there will be NO FURTHER fraternization with CiSSD. Frog
Z> warned everyone about this sort of thing!

     Frog  this,   frog  that.   Apparently,  frog  is  a  schizophrenic,
constantly  reffering  to  himself  in  the  third  person,  but  I won't
complain..  as long as  _Zoth A Frog_  doesn't  fraternize with  me,  I'm
happy. Oh wait, did you want the last word? Here you go:

Z> Furthermore, there will be NO FURTHER fraternization with CiSSD. Frog
Z> warned everyone about this sort of thing!

                       LAST WORDS FROM THE EDITOR
                               Essence/TX

     I pushed  my luck long  enough.  It was  only a  few weeks,  but  my
parents got sick and tired.  When  sleeping at  home becomes  an optional
extra,  you definately have  family  problems.  Interestingly  enough,  I
enjoyed being  out on my own.  I relied on my parents  for food every few
days when I  needed it;  and if I was  exhausted from  overactivity,  and
unable to sleep in -5c degree weather,  I still had a bed at home where I
could sleep but I  rathered not to.  I was sick of  being at home.  I was
sick of my two parent, boy and girl child,  middle class family.  I hated
the american dream.

     The  dream was  never quite what  the stories tell  you.  Whenever I
showed my love for someone else, they were unresponsive. I gather,  I too
was unresponsive when someone loved me. Whenever there was an argument, I
was  reason and my mother,  or my sister was emotion.  My dad and I never
fight.  He too is reasonable.  He too argues with my mother.  They should
never  have stayed together,  as respectively they are  'bad logic',  and
'bad love'.

     Had they only loosened the noose a little, and let me be me, instead
of  someone  they were  moulding me into,  I might still want  to be with
them; I might still care. But they didn't and I don't. They reach for me,
and I break their hearts.  I don't have time for them,  I need to get out
and be with my freinds.

     Had they only  seen what I  was feeling,  heard what  I was  saying,
known what I knew,  we could still be the american dream.  Sometimes,  to
really love  someone,  you have to let them go.  I guess,  they were only
dreaming. Maybe next time round, they'll listen closer.
