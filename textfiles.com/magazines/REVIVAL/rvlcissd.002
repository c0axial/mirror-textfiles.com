     "Backstabbers. All of you are traitors..."

     Well, that  hurt. For two weeks, we  all ate & slept  fear, of Short
Mans  anticipated arrest.  We schemed around  the clock to  stop it,  and
shamefully,  we even  schemed around  the clock to make  sure he wouldn't
rat.  We protected our informants,  and we didn't allow ANYBODY to get in
the way of our  minute moral fiber that told us this arrest was wrong.  I
personally found  it hard to believe that the local blink who gets off on
telling 976 operators about his "Steel Penis" (The replacement because of
his mining accident),  had enough time, or reason in the world, to run up
a $35000 phone bill for some PBX that isn't even in Canada.

     We'd spoken about  dissasociating with him before.  He was the cause
of 911 pranks galore on our teleconferences..  he was the reason for some
international  tension in  our hacking circles..  he could even have been
the reason  for an FBI  investigation that brushed  the livelyhood out of
our  original 800  meridian,  but  he didn't  understand..  and we  never
considered  his  foolish  mistakes  an act  of war.  We liked Short Man..
despite our amazing problems with him, some might even say we loved him.

     But it only took  one sentence to break it all  down.. one person to
say "don't trust them.".. one anti CiSSD comment, to scare Short Man into
submission. Now he's busted, and we all fear prosecution. You can't trust
someone who can't trust you.

     Well,  its been a long 3 months since the last issue of REVIVAL, and
a lot  has gone on  in this time.  Apart  from the  misunderstanding with
Zencor,  DNR on  a few lines  and other such news (which is common to all
area codes), CiSSD has acquired a few new members.

     As director  of the group,  it is  my privilege  to welcome  our two
newest members, The Dictator and Hypnotech.  We at CiSSD are confident we
have  make  good  decisions...   Both will make submissions  to   REVIVAL
and we  are confident that good  choices have been made in both cases.

     If YOU feel you might have what it takes to be a CiSSD member,  then
let us  know!  Our  phone number  appears at the bottom of this text,  so
give us a call.  Remember , you don 't have to be  a Phreak  or Hacker to
become  a member.   CiSSD has  many legitimate  interests,  and  talented
applicants may apply.

                         legitimate   business    practice   under,    by

     Its  people like  this  that kill  the scene.  Why  are they allowed
to exist until  shit jumps off?  Its inevitable,  yet  we wait  for it to
happen....  We seek to discipline rather than prevent.

     It isn't working.

that fits rather well,


                     "It is the end of the amateurs"


     Its both true and necessary.  The lame jeopardize our existence.

     I don't  suggest not  letting  people learn,  everyone  must  have a
"lame" period of knowing little,  but more that those with lame attitudes
must be dealt with in some way.   They jeopardize everything,  yet can we
censor just as the government does?  What do we sacrifice?

     Do we go down with our morals intact?  Or make a trade-off?

     Its a decision that  must be made for each individual,  yet an issue
that must be dealt with immediately.

     "Some of the  devices used to best  the computer are  engagingly
      simple -- as in the case of a young man who,  obviously knowing
      something about the ways of computers, applied for and received
      a  twelve-month  installment  loan  from a  New York  bank.  On
      receiving  from the bank,  together with the loan,  the book of
      computer  coded coupons  he was  supposed to  send in  with his
      monthly payments,  he tore  out the last payment  coupon in the
      book instead of the first and sent  it into the bank along with
      one month's  payment.  He then  received  a  computer-generated
      letter from the bank thanking him effusively for paying off his
      loan so  promptly  and  assuring  him of  his  excellent credit
      standing. The  young man didn't exactly  steal from the bank --
      he just left it up to the computer to make the next move."

                  BELL CANADA'S INTENT TOWARDS HACKERS
                              The Dictator

     In a conversation I  had recently with  two internal members of Bell
Canada,  I was  priveledged to  learn  that bell  "Frankly  doesn't  even
recognise a problem of system  hackers and Long-Distance Phreakers, apart
from calling-card fraud."

     It seems as though  Bell Canada (who incedentally profited in excess
of $950 Million last year) doesn't  find everyday phreaks a problem, even
going so far as to call 416 686-5890 a 'Fluke'.  "The [Bell] Hiearchy  is
too short-sighted to realize that  there is definately the potential  for
repeated hacking of PBX's,  seeing how there population has grown to over
1000 in the metro area alone" said one Bell official. This attitude seems
to hold for other segments of H/P/V as well. "We don't even want to catch
the hacker,"  said a  Bell investigations  officer, "We just want to find
out how, and more importantly,  why they hack."  Bell believes Hackers to
be nothing more than bacteria on the phone trunks.

     Bell Canada  does  not intend  to alter  service any further to deal
with  hackers , and  believes  overseas  billing  via  payphones will  be
reinstated  before 1994.  Also,  they have  no intentions  to stop third-
billing overseas from  Non-Millenium  (Digital) Payphones. "We can see no
purpose in affecting our customers' service any further."

     When it comes to Cam-Net, Unitel, UTI and others' hacking problems,
a bell official simply stated  that "They should get used to it. This is
the  real world.  If you  can't  forsee hacking  of your  services,  you
shouldn't be offering them." It should also be noted that Bell wished no
part  of Short-Man's trial.  "Why should we get involved?  He's just the
scum hackers scrape off of their shoes in the morning.  Nothing would be
gained by prosecuting him.  Besides, amassing the evidence would be more
exspensive than what we could possibly hope to charge him with," was the
response of a bell investigations officer.

     With all this, Bell still intends to go ahead with their 800-Dialup
service which will allow you to third-bill to any number,  regardless of
wether the  number accepts  the charges or not,  by simply offering your
Visa or  MC  number  in case  the  charges  are reversed.  "We  have  no
intention of  offering a  credit-card  dialing service," stated one bell
official,  "But we believe that  this service will be  benificial to our
customers, as well as sucessfully detering hackers.

     All in all,  Bell stills seems uptight in believing that they can't
be hacked  into for  any signifigant  sum of money.  That would  seem to
leave most of us in 416 safe for the time being.

                             SAVE THE SCENE!
                              The Dope Man


     The computer  underground is in a  time of crisis.   Ten years  ago,
being a  hacker was an ideal,  something that every  kid who ever watched
War Games  wanted to do, but couldn't.  Back then, the scene was tiny and
efficient and busts  were scarce.  However,  in 1993 things have changed.
In fact, one can hardly recognize the underground.  Busts are commonplace
and even the average  person with a modem can access deviency text files.
However,  these developments pale  in comparison with the one true issue,
the one thing that will be the  end of it all.  Hackers are no longer the
good guys.

     Over the last few  years tens of millions of  dollars have been lost
worldwide due  to the underground.   Much of  this figure  is theoretical
loss,  money that was  never taken,  but is rather the  loss of projected
profit.  The unfortunate thing  is that the public does not differentiate
between these  two types of loss.  The media  says "Teenage hacker steals
$100 000  in phone  service"  and it  is accepted by  the masses  without
question.  And why should they question?

     The corporations and the  police give the media  the information for
their articles.  Their motives for this are plain.  These institutions do
not benefit from public sympathy for hackers, and they have both realized
the problem, and how to solve it.  The media can only print what they are
told.  Thus,  we have the articles  that condemn even 13 year old phreaks
as  organized  criminals.   There  is  no  mention  of  the  morality  of
phreaking,  or Bell's over-pricing.  Just a simple article reporting on a
criminal.  Or, even better, as is the the current trend, feature articles
on the underground (which describe all of the anarchy files,  but none of
the ethics).  The media, the government, the police,  the corporations  -
All have it in for the scene, and they seem to be winning.

     All is  not lost,  however.  The  Underground in its  inflated  size
spans  the world,  and  encompasses many  thousands  of  people.  It  may
generally be said that members of the hack and phreak communities tend to
be of  an intelligent  stock.  Thus,  we find our solution.  They give us
bad media, we give ourselves good media.  Its easy to do, and it works.

     - Letters to the editor of papers explaining the morals behind the
       boy they call a crook.

     - Calling in to "answering machines" for radio shows.

     - Phone-ins on the radio

     - Call your local paper and tell them you will give them the inside
       scoop on the computer underground, and guide them through, showing
       the positive sides.


     All  of  these  activities  are  relatively  easy,  none  are  major
projects. However, on a massive scale,  they will make a difference.  The
difference between the life and death of the computer underground scene -
something none of us want  to see in our life times.  Police busts become
less frequent when the public disagrees (and you don't  want to be busted
now do you?), and certainly hackers are treated better by police officers
who feel  they are  arresting  a "nice  kid who just  fools around on his
computer too much".

     Cops want to arrest crooks; not kids.

     Society wants cops to bust crooks; not kids.

     Crook is relative to the morals of the masses.  You and I can change
these morals,  reverse the damage,  save our place  in Cyberspace.  But I
need  your  help,  and you  need  mine.  If we  all  work  together,  the
momentum of the movement will be unstoppable.

     We will win - but we must care enough to try.

                      ABUSE IN THE HOME AND SCHOOL
                              Terminator X

     It's a  crying shame,  believe it or  not that 20 - 30% of  children
are abused  in their  own homes,  and a far  larger number are  abused in
their  schools.  I speak  not of cuts and  bruises,  nor broken teeth and
broken bones,  but rather,  of a much more  lasting pain;  that of mental
abuse.

     The offenders; Parents,  teachers, and administrators.  The victims;
our future -- the youth of today.

     The figure is staggering.  It is also  very approximate,  but before
you  dismiss it,  consider the following:  What outlet  does a  child who
feels  neglected,  or maltreated,  have in order to  relieve the pain and
suffering..  or the feeling of aloneness? Who is it that sets guidelines,
and  shows  children where to  go when they  are hurting.  When you  were
growing up, or if you still are, who did you go to when you had a problem
you couldn't  deal with?  Your parents,  the abusers? Your  best freind..
what if you  couldn't see your freind,  or talk to him/her? How would you
feel? Surpressed?

     Sadly enough,  childen who are abused usually  have a distinct inner
feeling that the  abuser is right,  and they  are wrong.  In an interview
with  a   young abused  girl,   she said   she  thought that   maybe  her
parents would be less abusive if she followed the rules.  When asked what
rules she broke,  she responded,  "Sometimes,  I don't clean up my room,"
She said,  "I've never  been grounded for  more than  2 months, although,
even when I'm not officially [grounded], I can't go out, because I'll get
yelled at when I get home.

     "My mom hasn't beat me since I was eight."  She is sixteen now.  Her
father spends most  of his time fighting with her  mother,  which used to
tear her apart.  "I'm used  to it.  Sometimes I just yell randomly in the
middle  of  an  argument,  and  then  laught  riotously!  It's  the  best
entertainment I get."  She added,  "TV has lost its edge. I'm sick of it.
I could do without it."

     "Sex  is  the  best.   It's  the  only  escape  from   the  constant
screaming.", she said when asked what she does to relax.  She has been on
birth control pills since the age of fourteen,  and often has intercourse
without  the use of latex protection.  "I hope I get AIDS and die.",  she
chuckled.

     Abuse  in the school  is also from neglect.  Since the advent of the
school designed  for mass indoctrination (a.k.a. 'public school system'),
administration  has become  so impersonal  that matters  of phsycological
difficulty  caused  by  neglect  at  home,  are  treated  as disceplinary
problems. The victims are treated as 'delinquents'. They are demited, and
eventually  become  unemployable.   Favorite  phrases  of  administrators
include "I don't want to know" and "only you caused this situation."

     We  should  work to  have the school  problem solved.  The  board of
education for your area  should be encouraged to  hire guidance officials
with phsycology experience. Problems of attendance and deteriorating work
habits should always be approached with the idea that mental problems due
to excessive stress in everyday life,  or abuse,  could be the underlying
reason for substandard acheivement.

     Parental expectations need  to be lowered to attainable levels.  Not
every child has  the capability to perform straight  'A's in all of their
subjects.  Not every  child has  the will,  and not  every child  has the
desire.

     In Canada,  there are  laws against  mental abuse,  but there  is no
sufficient platform for enforcement of these laws by the children who are
most hurt by the cruelty of their 'superiors'.

     When asked why disceplinary action for attendance and smoking was so
severe at  Thornhill Secondary School,  a Vice Principal responded "These
kids  simply  need to follow  the rules.  If they can't do it,  then they
deal with the consequences.  It's not my job to  oversee how they live at
home.

     Who's job is it?

                        FREE CALLS, THIRD BILLING
                              Terminator X

     In the  (416) area code,  it has  become  common  practise for  many
phreaks to third bill telephone calls to illegaly obtained Voice Mail Box
systems.  Recently,  however,  phreaks are noticing it to be increasingly
difficult to third bill to these boxes.. and they can also no longer have
their boxes  accept collect  calls.  The reason  for this  is DMS  number
blocking.

     The switch can be programmed to  automatically reject third bill and
collect calls placed to a block of numbers.  The system administrator for
the company owning the VMB exchange calls up,  and has the phone company,
Bell Canada in our case, install a number screen on the VMB exchange.

     DMS number blocking has one significant  flaw. It is only capable of
placing a screen on  number blocks of 1000  or more. If  you are aware of
any VMB exchanges containing 900 or less VMB's, not only does the company
not have blocking,  but cannot obtain blocking to  prevent you from third
billing.

     Another  interesting footnote regarding  third billing in  the (416)
area is that Bell Mobility  Cellular has opted  for the time being not to
block  their exchanges..  if you can  hack Bell's, then that's the way to
go.. not  that I  support  any  of this  at all.  Seriously!  Other  than
emergency situations, third billing illegitimately provides nothing but a
shure-fire way to get caught.

     Finally,  it might  be noted  that  Bell  Mobility  has  experienced
approximately  $20000  of similar  fraud every month  since this flaw was
uncovered..  That only includes  that which  DOES get  caught.  Those who
don't  get  caught  are  stealthier..  they spread it  around..  and  any
customer without  detailed billing pays the  bill without question.. they
really don't  know if they used $500 of phone time this month.. how could
they?

                       FEATURE: ALL SYSTEMS SECURE
                          Lister - The Dope Man

     This month,  CiSSD's independant  researchers  went off  to look for
articles and we  came up  with a concensus  on a single  topic..  systems
security.

     In addition to the other topics this month,  we decided to publish a
few of the documents  they found in our feature this issue,  'All Systems
Secure'.



Sourced by: Lister
     Topic: DDN Security Management Procedures for Host Administrators
          : Volume I of II
    Length: 74.7KB

Begin ---*


                           VOLUME I

1.  Purpose.  This Circular is the first of two volumes
describing security management procedures for the Defense Data
Network (DDN).  Volume I provides operational security
guidance for the DDN and describes the Host Administrator's
management responsibilities.  It is based on review of
Government and industry documents on the DDN, local area
networks, and computer security.  Volume I establishes methods
and procedures for detecting and reporting unauthorized
activity.  It describes the resources and tools available to
the Host Administrator for investigating local incidents.
Additionally, it discusses the procedures and tools needed for
reporting network related incidents to the DDN Network
Security Officer (NSO).  Volume II prescribes the policy for
enforcing network operational security and describes the
management responsibilities of the DDN Network Security
Officer (NSO).  Volume II will receive limited distribution.

2.  Applicability.  This Circular applies to DCA Headquarters,
DCA field activities, and Government and commercial activities
using or managing the operation of the DDN.

3.  Policy.  DCA continually strives to improve its resources
for providing a reasonable level of security for the DDN.
These resources include the network access control system and
its audit trial analysis capabilities for detecting
unauthorized and illegal network activities.  These detection
and audit capabilities will be used to identify and prosecute
unauthorized individuals who access or attempt to access
databases or system software of host computers connected to
the DDN.  In addition, DCA has created the DDN Security
Coordination Center (SCC) to gather information regarding DDN
security problems and to disseminate problem definition,
status, and resolution information under the direction of the
NSO.  These resources and tools alone are not sufficient.
Site personnel such as the Host Administrators need to assume
an active role and assure their constituents and the DDN that
they are providing for a reasonable level of protection of the

network and computing resources under their jurisdiction.
Host Administrators are required to report suspicious
activities to their network manager.  Formal investigations of
unauthorized or illegal activities occurring on the DDN must
be coordinated with the DDN Network Security Officer.
Individuals suspected of unauthorized access or use of host
computers over the DDN will be subject to prosecution under
Title 18 of the Federal Criminal Code.

4.  Procedures.  Chapters 4 and 5 describe the procedures for
performing the security functions of the Host Administrator.

                   CHAPTER 1.  INTRODUCTION

1.  The_DDN_Security_Resources.  This Circular is intended to
provide Host Administrators a set of security guidelines to
operate on the Defense Data Network (DDN).  This Circular will
assist you in maintaining the security of your local host
computer site, as well as the overall DDN.  It does not in any
way supersede any current Service Regulations or Procedures
governing the security of ADP facilities not related to the
DDN.  This Chapter provides you with a definition of your
security responsibilities as a Host Administrator.  You must
have contact with certain offices to fulfill these
responsibilities.  The duties of these offices are discussed
here to assist you in understanding their missions.

    a.  DDN_NSO_(Network_Security_Officer).  The DDN NSO is
the single point of contact for dealing with network-related
operational security issues.  The DDN NSO also implements
applicable policies included in DCAI 630-230-19, Security
Requirements for Automated Information Systems.  The NSO
recommends security policy affecting the DDN and is
responsible for its general enforcement.  The NSO also works
closely with Host Administrators to resolve network and
related computer security problems and incidents affecting
their sites.

    b.  Host_Administrator.  A Host Administrator is the
person who has administrative responsibility for the policies,
practices, and concerns of a host, or hosts, connected to the
DDN, including responsibility for that host's DDN users.
Specifically, the Host Administrator is responsible for the
following activities:

        (1)  Assisting with network management by ensuring
that network policies and procedures are observed by the
users.  Locally administering the TAC access control system
(TACACS), ensuring that all of their host users have been
authorized for DDN and TAC access and are registered in the
NIC user registration database (WHOIS/NICNAME).

        (2)  Locally managing the network access control
procedures and password system.  Reporting network-related
host break-ins and assisting with investigations as needed.

    c.  NSC_(Node_Site_Coordinator).  The NSC has physical
control over hardware and software, and coordination
responsibility for the DDN circuits and equipment located at
the DDN node site.

    d.  NIC_(Network_Information_Center).  The NIC registers
all users in the WHOIS/NICNAME database and operates the
Network Auditing and Usage Reporting System (NAURS) computer
system that produces the MILNET TACACS audit and incident
reports.  Call (800) 235-3155 for more information.


1-2                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

    e.  DDN_SCC_(Security_Coordination_Center).  The SCC
gathers information about DDN computer and network security
incidents and works closely with the NSO to disseminate the
information necessary to contain, control, and resolve these
problems mainly through the DDN Security Bulletins.  The
hotline number is (800) 235-3155.

    f.  CERT_(Computer_Emergency_Response_Team).  The CERT
gathers and distributes information about Internet security
incidents.  They work closely with the NSO and SCC on DDN-
related security problems.  The hotline number is (412) 268-
7090.

2.  Responsibilities_of_the_Host_Administrator.  Host
administrators have the overall responsibility to provide a
reasonable level of protection to host sites from the
possibility of network compromises.  They must act as liaisons
with the NSO, SCC, vendors, law enforcement bodies, and other
appropriate agencies to resolve any outstanding security
problems and prevent their future recurrence.  They are
responsible for the enforcement of DDN policy at their site.
Because information acquisition and distribution is such a
vital part of the responsibility of the Host Administrator,
the use of electronic mail is a basic tool to support this
function and should be used whenever possible.  Not all Host
Administrators have access to this valuable tool, but given
its value, these sites are strongly encouraged to implement
this capability.

3.  Responsibilities_of_Other_Site_Representatives.  There are
several other levels of responsibilities for the provision of
security for the DDN.  At the most basic level, the individual
users should take the necessary precautions to minimize the
chances that their accounts could be compromised.  They bear
the primary responsibility for the protection of their
information.  If users took this responsibility seriously and
acted accordingly, the majority of computer incidents could
not occur.  System managers have the responsibility to
maintain the resources and procedures to establish an
environment for "safe" computing (e.g., implementing
procedures for proper installation and testing of system
software, adequate backups, and reasonable system monitoring).
Vendors have the responsibility to notify their customers of
problems with their software (especially problems which could
compromise system security) and to distribute timely fixes.

             CHAPTER 2.  THE DDN SECURITY PROBLEM

1.  General.

    a.  A computer network is a telecommunications system
primarily designed to allow a number of independent devices
(i.e., host computers, workstations, terminals, or
peripherals) to communicate with each other.  Essentially, the
DDN is a worldwide collection of computer networks.  As the
DDN expands its capabilities and resources, and as more
consitituents gain DDN access, the risk increases to the
overall security of the information and data flowing in the
network.  Therefore, a major concern is that security problems
will rise in response to this expansion.  Additionally, the
possibility of espionage activity also increases as the
network gets larger.

    b.  On November 2, 1988, Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.,
drastically changed the attitude of network users and
administrators regarding security network and computer
security problems.  He unleashed his infamous Internet Worm
which afflicted over 6,000 MILNET and other Internet hosts.
The incident caused a fair amount of panic because most of the
sites were ill-prepared for such a massive scale of
intrusions.  It was fortunate that, due to a miscalculation,
the attack was unrestrained.  In its original manifestation,
Morris' Worm might have gone undetected at many sites.  The
main lesson to be learned from that incident is that everyone
connected with the use of network and computing facilities
must always take into account the vulnerabilities of network
resources to compromise or attack.

2.  Attack_Points.  The DDN security problem is defined as the
accidental or intentional disclosure, destruction, or
modification of information flowing or accessed through the
DDN.  Potential points of attack include terminal-to-network
interface connections, terminal-to-terminal interface
connections, terminal-to-host interface connections, and
interfaces or circuits themselves.

3.  Categories_of_Network_Abusers.  Identifying the security
problem or threat is a key element in determining security
risks.  Consider the fundamental characteristics of the
threats to your assets before you worry about specific
techniques (to be discussed in the following section).  For
example:

    a.  Unauthorized access by persons or programs which
amounts to the use of any network or computer resource without
prior permission.  Such unauthorized access may open the door
to other security threats including the use of your facility
to access other sites on a network.


2-2                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

    b.  Disclosure or corruption of information.  Depending on
the sensitivity of the information, disclosure without
modification may have more damaging consequences if the event
goes unnoticed.

    c.  Denial of service which prevents users from performing
their work.  In fact, an entire network may be made unusable
by a rogue packet, jamming, or by a disabled network
component.  (The Morris Worm contained all of these
characteristics.  If you have considered options to address
these general characteristics, you may be well-equipped to
handle variations of historic penetration strategies that may
evolve in the future.)

4.  Common_Penetration_Techniques.  In evaluating the security
relationships between the security of your host computer and
the DDN, you may wish to consider the following penetration
techniques.  These are methods that may be used to penetrate
your computers.  Therefore, you must take precaution to
prevent the possible success of these types of attacks.
Several techniques exist to aid in the unauthorized access to
computer system components.  These techniques are closely
associated with a system's vulnerabilities.  Therefore, their
successful application first requires identifying a system's
vulnerabilities.  Through analyzing a systems protection
mechanisms (or lack thereof), how they function, and their
deficiencies, consideration can be given to how such
mechanisms can be circumvented, nullified, or deceived.  Many
of these techniques can be categorized by the types of
activity they involve and the system vulnerabilities they
exploit.  A particular type of technique may be used to
exploit more than one vulnerability, and a vulnerability may
be exploited by more than one technique.  Some techniques
leave signatures (i.e., traces of their utilization), others
do not.  Such signatures, their detection, and analysis are
fundamental to threat monitoring and security auditing.

    a.  Browsing.  An individual gains unauthorized access to
a user's files by exploiting the vulnerability of a file
access authorization mechanism in the operating system.
"Browsing" requires knowledge of file names and use of a
program, and it characteristically includes the following
operations:

        (1)  User's program A references a file not authorized
for such use.

        (2)  The operating system does not check the activity
and permits access.

        (3)  Program A gains access to the file, reads it, and
formats it for printout, or deposits it into a local file
under the penetrator's control.  Unauthorized system users (if
they know all the file names in a system) can use this


DCAC 310-P115-1                                            2-3

technique numerous times to browse through all the files
looking for classified or sensitive information.  This is not
generally possible, however, when files are protected by
passwords.

    b.  Masquerading.  Gaining unauthorized access to a system
component by assuming the identity of another authorized user
is called "masquerading".  Success of this technique stems
from a computer system having no means of establishing a
user's identity other than through symbolic identifiers.  The
easiest method of masquerading is to obtain the password and
other identifiers of an authorized user from some report or
document that was carelessly left exposed.  This situation is
most likely to occur in installations that support remote
terminals where no option exists to have such identifiers
suppressed by the terminal during the SIGN-ON procedure.  Even
when a suppression capability is provided by the terminal that
overtypes any such identifiers before or after their printing,
they can still possibly be discerned.  A more sophisticated
technique for gaining access to an authorized user's
identifiers is to wiretap the terminal and intercept the
identifiers when they are transmitted in the clear over
communication lines.

    c.  Scavenging.  This penetration technique exploits the
vulnerability of unerased residual data.  Both primary and
secondary storage media used for processing sensitive
information may continue to retain that information after
they have been released for reallocation to another use.  The
latter may then "scavenge" the information by reading the
storage media before making any other use of it.

    d.  Unknown_System-State_Exploitation.  This method takes
advantage of certain conditions that occur after a partial or
total system crash.  For example, some user files may remain
open without an "end-of-file" indication.  The user can then
obtain unauthorized access to other files by reading beyond
that indicator when the system resumes operation.

    e.  Asynchronous_Interrupt.  This technique exploits
system vulnerabilities arising from deficiencies in the
interrupt management facilities of an operating system.  If a
processor suspends execution of a protection mechanism to
process an interrupt and is then erroneously returned to a
user program without completing the security check then the
protection has been circumvented.

    f.  Spoofing.  Spoofing exploits the inability of a
system's remote terminal users to verify that at any given
time they are actually communicating with the intended system
rather than some masquerading system.  This deception, also
known as a "Mockingbird Attack," can be perpetrated by
intercepting the terminal's communication lines and providing
system-like responses to the user.  A variation of spoofing is


2-4                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

the use of an application program to provide responses similar
to the operating system, so the operator will unknowingly
provide the passwords to an applications program and not to
the operating system.

    g.  Trojan_Horse.  In this technique computer processing
is covertly altered by either modifying existing program
instructions or inserting new instructions.  Once this has
been accomplished, whenever the altered processes are used the
perpetrator will automatically benefit from unauthorized
functions performed in addition to the routine output.  This
modification is usually done by hiding secret instructions in
either the original source-code or the machine-code version of
a lengthy program.  An even harder to detect method would be
to alter the operating and utility system programs so that
they make only temporary changes in the target program as it
is executing.  The hardware version of the Trojan Horse
technique is relatively rare.  However, the replacement of
valid micro-chips with slightly altered counterfeit chips is
entirely possible and would be very hard to detect.  In either
the software or hardware Trojan Horse method, only someone
with access to a program or the computer system could become a
perpetrator.

    h.  Clandestine_Machine_Code_Change.  This technique is
closely related to the Trojan Horse technique.  This method
allows system programmers to insert code into the system that
creates trapdoors.  At specific times based on certain
combinations, these trapdoors can be activated by a user from
the user's program.  Individuals who initially design the
system, contract maintenance personnel who fix the system, or
people who are able to gain access to the supervisory state
also have this opportunity.  The technique could be as simple
as users stealing job card information on work that has
already gone through the system.  They then resubmit this
information to the system on their own job card along with
another program.  This particular job may have dealt with
sensitive data and therefore a security violation would have
occurred.

5.  Necessary_Precautions.  The aforementioned techniques are
only a few ways that unauthorized access or usage of your host
computer system may be obtained.  You must enforce proper
access control on remote terminals to prevent unauthorized
personnel from abusing unattended terminals used for input or
data modification.  You must also emphasize the physical
protection of the terminal and the administration and control
of password access and use.  Terminal users must be instructed
on the importance of protecting their user identification
(UID)/password.

              CHAPTER 3.  NETWORK ACCESS SECURITY

1.  General.  Access control is the primary method of
providing protection from unauthorized access into the DDN.
There are two basic kinds of access control systems -- those
that detect intrusion and those that stop an intruder from
gaining access to the network.  Both intrusion detection and
network access control are functions of the TAC Access Control
System (TACACS) which monitors terminal network access.  The
security of both the network and connected hosts is greatly
enhanced if the Host Administrator can provide local security
systems which can complement the TACACS.  Possibilities
include installing security systems which limit physical
access to terminals connected to their hosts.  Another weak
link in the security chain is dial-up access and host-to-host
connections (not under TACACS control).  There is a great need
to establish some manner of access control with auditing
capabilities to cover these situations.

2.  TAC_Access_Control_System_(TACACS).  This section on
TACACS is provided to inform you of the tracking capability
that exists if your computer terminal is connected to a
Terminal Access Controller (TAC).  The information obtained by
the TACACS will be quite useful in enforcing proper access
control for those users entering the MILNET through TACs.
TACACS uses a login procedure to control access to MILNET.
When a MILNET user attempts to open a connection to a host,
the TAC prompts for the user's TAC user ID and access code.
TACACS is automatically monitored; a variety of reports are
available for use by the NSO.

    a.  User_Registration.  DCA's Data Network Operations
Division establishes policy for the MILNET and administers the
MILNET TAC access and control system through the Network
Information Center (NIC).  TACs are used on MILNET to provide
controlled network access to most locations.  The Host
Administrator is responsible for registering all users of
their hosts who have network access and who have been
authorized for MILNET TAC access through MILNET TACS.  All of
those users must be registered and given TAC access cards by
the NIC.  The access cards are valid for one year at which
time the TAC User must request a renewal from the Host
Administrator.  If a password is compromised, the UID/password
can be invalidated (hotlisted).

    b.  Guest_Accounts.  A limited number of temporary guest
cards are available for distribution by each Host
Administrator on MILNET.  These cards have a limited lifetime
and are not for permanent use.  They are for users without
TACACS privileges who temporarily need network access, or for
new users at startup time before they receive their own UID
and password.

    c.  WHOIS/NICNAME_Database.  Every request to authorize a
new TAC user or renew an existing TAC user must come from a
MILNET Host Administrator.  Information about authorized users
is kept in the WHOIS/NICNAME database on a host at the NIC.
Host Administrators can request information on authorized TAC
users that are changed or deleted from the database.  The
WHOIS/NICNAME database can be accessed by anyone on the MILNET
but can be changed only by operators at the NIC.

        CHAPTER 4.  OPERATIONAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF
                       UNCLASSIFIED NETS

1.  General.

    a.  This Chapter provides operational guidance on security
management of an unclassified network.  Chapter 5 provides
guidance for operating on a classified net.  The potential
exists for authorized and unauthorized users to conduct
illegal activities on shared communications networks such as
the DDN.  Network abusers fall into three categories:

        (1)  A person sponsored and authorized on the DDN who
engages in an unauthorized activity.

        (2)  A person accessing the network illegally.

        (3)  A person with access to a host system who need
not log-in through a TAC and engages in unauthorized activity.

    b.  While your individual databases may be unclassified,
compiling large amounts of unclassified data may result in the
creation of sensitive information.  [SENSITIVE UNCLASSIFIED
INFORMATION is defined as any information the loss, misuse, or
unauthorized access to, or modification of which adversely
might affect U.S. national interest, the conduct of DoD
programs, or the privacy of DoD personnel (e.g., FOIA exempt
information and information whose distribution is limited by
DoD Directive 5230.24.)]  Network security can only be as
effective as what the local Host Administrator/ADP system
security officer does to enforce strict access control
procedures.  Network security is a principle responsibility of
Host Administrators.

    c.  You may wish to investigate additional authentication
systems to protect local computing assets (i.e., systems such
as smart cards or Kerberos, developed at MIT.  This is a
collection of software used in a network to establish a user's
claimed identity and to control access to a large number of
interconnected workstations).

2.  Access_Vulnerability.  Connection to the DDN will require
a reevaluation of the risk assessment concerning threat and
vulnerability of your host locations.  Users accessing these
hosts should be told what level of data security will be
provided.  For example, do maintenance contracts exist with
the system software vendors to fix defects that might
otherwise compromise the resources?  You should consider what
is the level of sensitivity of data that users should store on
your systems.  It would be unwise for users to store very
sensitive information on a vulnerable system whether the
information was classified or not.  It is also very important
that your site does not seem to encourage penetration attempts
through the use of a welcome banner as part of the login  


4-2                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

request response of the host.  The courts have given great
leeway to intruder defendants who claimed that they were
encouraged to browse by the banner.  Additionally, your login
challenge should not include information about the operating
system.  It helps a would-be abuser determine which
penetration techniques would probably be most effective.

3.  Risk_Assessment.  Risk assessment is a requirement of DCAI
630-230-19.  A checklist providing guidelines for reevaluating
the threat and vulnerability that results from connecting to
the DDN has been included (see Tables 1-6, Vulnerability
Analysis).

4.  Security_Policies_and_Procedures.  This section covers
many diverse aspects such as physical security and data
security, authorizations, education, and training.

    a.  Physical_Security.  Physical security includes the
facilities that house computers as well as remote computer
terminals.  Within security parameters established by the Host
Administrator, work areas must be restricted with physical
barriers, appropriate placement and storage of equipment and
supplies, and universal wearing of identification badges, as
applicable.

    b.  Authorization.  Another crucial factor that must be
considered in devising a security program is user
authorization.  Only people with a "need to know" and with a
realization of proper precautions can be given access to
sensitive or proprietary information or to ADP facilities.
The use of passwords and terminal access restrictions can
provide extra security for highly sensitive information.
Passwords can be used to reduce accidental or non-accidental
modification by authorized personnel by restricting access to
their respective database files.

    c.  Data_Security.  Although it is not foolproof, the best
known identification/authentication scheme is the use of
passwords.  The Host Administrator must assure that passwords
are kept secret by their users.  The Host Administrator must
also assure that passwords are long enough to thwart
exhaustive attack by changing them often and by adequately
protecting password files.  (In the case of MILNET TAC Users,
the TACACS generates passwords with the proper attributes.
The users are not given the option to create their own TAC
passwords.)  When creating passwords, the following
restrictions should be observed.  Failure to do so will result
in passwords that could be found in a database dictionary, or
otherwise easily discovered.

        (1)  Don't use words that can be found in a
dictionary.


DCAC 310-P115-1                                            4-3

        (2)  Don't use traceable personal data.

        (3)  Don't allow users to create their own passwords.

        (4)  Change passwords frequently.

        (5)  Keep passwords private.

    d.  One-Time_Passwords.  [The following is excerpted from
CSC-STD-002-85.]  One-time passwords (i.e., those that are
changed after each use) are useful when the password is not
adequately protected from compromise during login (e.g., the
communication line is suspected of being tapped).  The
difficult part of using one-time passwords is in the
distribution of new passwords.  If a one-time password is
changed often because of frequent use, the distribution of new
one-time passwords becomes a significant point of
vulnerability.  There are products on the market that generate
such passwords through a cryptographic protocol between the
destination host and a hand-held device the user can carry.

    e.  Failed_Login_Attempt_Limits.  [The following is
excerpted from CSC-STD-002-85.]  In some instances, it may be
desirable to count the number of unsuccessful login attempts
for each user ID, and base password expiration and user
locking on the actual number of failed attempts.  (Changing a
password would reset the count for that user ID to zero.)

    f.  Monitoring_Terminal_Use.  The Host Administrator
should also have some method of monitoring terminal use.  A
log-in sheet is convenient to provide an audit trail if the
host has no automated access control and audit capability.
This record should contain such information as login and
logout times, purpose, project being worked on, project
classification, and anything else deemed necessary by you as
the Host Administrator.  Additionally, the classification
level at which the terminal may be used should be prominently
displayed at the terminal location.  You will need to work
closely with the system manager to assure that host activities
are monitored as well.  This information will be extremely
valuable in conjunction with TAC connections and will be the
primary information for incidents where access originated from
an external host and no network audit data is available.

    g.  Terminal_Usage.  You must also ensure that proper
procedures are enforced when using computer terminals.  The 4-
following points should be considered:

        (1)  Automated login procedures that include the use
of stored passwords should not be allowed.

        (2)  Terminals logged onto the DDN network or to the
host computer should not be left unattended.

4-4                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

        (3)  Some form of access control for dial-up telephone
connections, such as dial-back procedures, should be used.
[Note: Dial-back is not acceptable on lines that may be
subject to Call Forwarding.]

        (4)  Unclassified sensitive information in printed
form or in terminal display should be revealed on a "need to
know" basis only.

        (5)  Proper disposal of printed information (i.e.,
tearing, shredding, or otherwise obliterating such material)
is mandatory.

        (6)  Securing of terminals and access lines during
non-business hours.

        (7)  Securing of software programs and stored data
during non-business hours.

        (8)  Recording of equipment, custodians, serial
numbers, and equipment locations to aid in identifying lost or
stolen equipment.

    h.  Electronic_Mail.  Any electronic mail host
administrator should have written procedures for users to
follow in the event that any mail in the host is determined to
be classified.  The Host Administrator must be notified
immediately to purge any backup files containing the
classified mail, retrieve it from addresses and mail boxes,
and remove it from the active data base.  Such an event is an
administrative security violation that must be reported to the
offender's organization security officer immediately.

    i.  Internal_Controls.  Even the most sophisticated access
control system is ineffective if an organization has weak
internal controls.  Case studies of commercial firms often
describe abuses made by employees who have resigned from a
company, but still have active user IDs and passwords.  It is
just as important for Military or DoD organizations to remove
network access, as well as local host computer access, from
anyone being transferred, retired, or otherwise leaving the
organization.  Changing (all of) the password(s) associated
with a user's account(s) should be part of the local exit
procedures.  Every Host Administrator should have written
procedures for retiring e-mail accounts.  Consideration should
also be given to establishing a procedure to reevaluate an
individual's requirement to access the network when the person
is transferred within the organization.  It is the Host
Administrator's responsibility to enact the following:

        (1)  Procedures to remove individuals' access to the
DDN upon that individual's departure.
















DCAC 310-P115-1                                            4-5

        (2)  If sponsoring a non-DOD organization's access to
the DDN, procedures must be established to require a written
agreement that the non-DOD organization will have an
individual's access to the DDN removed upon that individual's
departure.

    j.  Encryption.  Another method of securing data is
encryption, a powerful method of protecting information
transmitted between the host computer and remote terminals.
It limits access to information stored in the computer's data
base.  An individual user not possessing the proper encryption
key has little chance of gaining usable information from a
computer protected in this manner.

5.  Education_Program.  Security training is a key element of
a security program.  Evaluating the risks within a DDN
environment and implementing an active DDN security program
requires properly trained personnel.  An effective training
program will provide both formal and informal instruction.
Depending on the size and complexity of the ADP environment
and the level of data being processed, the instruction will
range from security awareness education for top-level
management, to highly technical security training for DDN
operations personnel.  (See DCAI 630-230-19).

    a.  General_Information.  Users of the host system should
be provided with information regarding their computing and
network environment and their responsibilities within that
setting.  Users should be made aware of the security problems
associated with access to the systems via local and wide-area
networks.  They should be told how to properly manage their
account and workstation.  This includes explaining how to
protect files stored on the system, and how to log out or lock
the terminal/workstation.  Policy on passwords must be
emphasized.  An especially important point that must be
emphasized is that passwords are not to be shared.

    b.  Specific_Topics.  The below listed training areas must
be taught at the appropriate administrative, management, and
staff levels.  You must also implement testing plans to assure
that personnel will know their responsibilities in emergency
situations.  Drills should be scheduled periodically to
determine that the emergency procedures are adequate for the
threat to be countered.  The Host Administrator's security
training program should include specifics in the following
areas as applicable:

        (1)  General security awareness.

        (2)  User security.

        (3)  Security administration.

        (4)  Transition control and computer abuse.

        CHAPTER 5.  OPERATIONAL SECURITY MANAGEMENT OF
                        CLASSIFIED NETS

1.  General.  Unauthorized user activities obviously pose a
greater threat to the classified nets.  Since the classified
communications nets are closed communities, classified hosts
must maintain their own access control and audit system to
detect and analyze problems.  For specific details concerning
security in the WIN Communications System (DSNET 1), refer to
JCS Pub 6-03.7, Security_Policy_for_the_WWMCCS_Intercomputer
Network (Unclas), dated April 88.  For specific details
concerning security in the Sensitive Compartmented Information
Network (DSNET 3), refer to the following documents: DIAM 50-
3, Physical_Security_Standards_for_SCI_Facilities (FOUO); DIAM
50-4, Security_of_Compartmented_Computer_Operations (C), dated
June 80; and DCID 1/16, Security_Policy_for_Uniform_Protection
of_Intelligence_Processed_in_Automated_Information_Systems_and
Networks (S), dated July 88.

2.  Limited_Terminal_Access_Controls.  Terminal access
controllers, when used on the classified subnetworks, are
currently limited to controlling access into the network.  The
TACs do not collect and forward audit information of network
activity to a central location for analysis, usage data
collection, and processing as is done on the unclassified
networks.  The TAC Access Control System (TACACS), necessary
for dial-in access, has not been implemented on the classified
networks because there is no dial-in access.  In the WIN
Communications System, for example, TACs are not used; network
access is controlled by the interconnected hosts.  The WWMCCS
Intercomputer Network (WIN) hosts also collect audit data of
user activity at each host location.

3.  Closed_Community_Characteristics.  Most, if not all, of
the guidance given in Chapter 4 is incorporated in creating a
"closed" community.  A major difference in access control of
classified networks is that no dial-up access is allowed.
Also, personnel having access to a facility will have, as a
minimum, a system high clearance level for their site.  There
are multiple classification levels at some locations.  The
Host Administrator must take special precautions to ensure
that the classification of passwords and the access authority
of operating personnel are at or above the classification
level of the operation being performed.

4.  Security_Awareness.  Because of the nature of classified
systems and the greater threat that security infractions can
cause, it is incumbent that the host administrator assure that
there exists sufficient exposure to security awareness and
training.  The listed training areas must be taught at the
appropriate administrative, management, and staff levels.  You
must also implement testing plans to assure that personnel
will know their responsibilities in emergency situations.
The Host Administrator's security training program must

       CHAPTER 6.  DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED HOST ACCESS

1.  General.  Because you, as the Host Administrator, are
responsible for the security of the host computer, early
detection of potential abuse will serve to prohibit losses.
Effective monitoring will also deter potential perpetrators
from attempting to experiment with illegal schemes if the
probability of detection is high.  The following points
provide guidance for the types of events you should look for
to detect unauthorized activity:

    a.  Unexplained use of disk space.

    b.  Unknown files listed in the directory.

    c.  Repeated failed attempts to access the host.

    d.  Unusual log-in times.

    e.  A file being accessed by someone who has no
authorization to be in that file.

    f.  Excessive time (hours) on line or a pattern of
unusually short access times (less than one minute).

2.  Detection_Training.  Detection of unauthorized activities
at host locations is a responsibility shared by all personnel
within the work place.  The Host Administrator, however, may
find it necessary to educate personnel on this point and
delegate responsibilities.  Apart from the measures taken to
manage the security environment, Host Administrators must act
with diligence regarding technical or quasi-technical areas
affecting security.  For example, their responsibilities might
include enforced cycling of password changes,
compartmentalizing proprietary information away from the
generally accessible system and limiting its accessibility to
those with a bona fide "need-to-know," monitoring access logs
and maintaining audit trails to facilitate detection of
unusual activity, and using security systems and services
offered by their network systems and service providers.

3.  Logging_Events.  Illegal attempts to gain access into
sensitive areas (i.e., trespassing or guessing at passwords in
order to sign on or access files from remote terminals) should
be logged and reviewed regularly.  One effective detection of
unauthorized activities is to display the last log-on time and
date on the screen after the user has successfully logged onto
the system.  Statistics of access violations should be
collected with regard to details of the particular terminals
being abused and the files being accessed.  The results should
be reviewed by the NSO.

4.  Peculiar_Behavior.  If not typical of or appropriate for
your organization, beware of unsupervised work especially if a


6-2                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

person regularly volunteers for overtime work and is allowed
to stay on the premises unsupervised.  Have two-man control
procedures for sensitive information work.  In addition, be
advised that many computer crimes occur during holiday
periods, or during times when host computers are experiencing
low traffic.  Pay particular attention to peculiar activities
during these periods.

5.  Legal_Recourse.  Public Law 98-473, known as the
"Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of
1984" added Section 1030 to Title 18 United States Code on
October 12, 1984.  It was the first federal computer crime law
that criminalized unauthorized access to classified national
security information or information in certain financial
records.  Additionally, it criminalized certain unauthorized
accesses to computers operated on behalf of the Government.

6.  Prosecution_as_a_Deterrent.  When there is adequate
evidence collected for conviction, the perpetrator should
always be prosecuted.  This action would serve as a serious
warning to others contemplating making similar attempts and
can be extremely effective as a deterrent.  However, as recent
world events have revealed, this really doesn't deter abuse
adequately.  Therefore, you must assure proper protection of
your computer systems.

7.  Incident_Reporting_by_Subscriber.  The flow of security
incident reporting should be from the end user to the Host
Administrator, or other appropriate individual who determines
if the problem is local or network related.  If the problem is
network related, the problem should be referred to the
appropriate Network Manager/Security Officer.  The Network
Manager/Security Officer would contact the DDN NSO, if
appropriate, for assistance in obtaining audit trail data from
the NIC for MILNET.  Depending on the seriousness of the
incident, the DDN NSO would assure that the appropriate
investigating agency was involved, and support requests for
information for formal investigations.

8.  Contacts.  To correspond with the DDN NSO, use any one of
the following methods of contact:

    a.  Via network mail to: SCC@NIC.DDN.MIL or
DCA-MMC@DCA-EMS.DCA.MIL

    b.  Via U.S. mail to: HQ Defense Communications Agency,
Code: DODM, Attn: DDN-NSO, Washington, DC 20305-2000

    c.  Via commercial phone to: (800) 451-7413, or
(800) 235-3155 for the SCC

    d.  Via DSN/AUTOVON to: 312-222-2714/5726

    e.  Via AUTODIN to: DCA WASHINGTON DC//DODM//


DCAC 310-P115-1                                            6-3

    f.  Classified correspondence must be forwarded via
AUTODIN or U.S. mail using procedures appropriate for its
classification level.

9.  What_Information_To_Report.  Your incident reports must
include certain minimal information to enable the DDN NSO to
take action.  The DDN NSO requires a brief, unclassified
description of the incident and the name, telephone number,
and organization of the person reporting the incident.  If the
incident's occurrence is classified, the report and any
classified discussions between the DDN NSO and officials at
the affected organization must take place using secure modes
of communication.  The following is the minimum information
necessary for an incident report:

    a.  Date of report (Day-Month-Year, e.g., 01 Jan 87)

    b.  Date and time period of incident(s) (Zulu time)

    c.  Personal data of person reporting the incident:

        (1)  Name

        (2)  Telephone number

        (3)  Organization

    d.  Network involved (e.g., MILNET, DSNET 1, 2, or 3)

    e.  Did unauthorized access come from the DDN, if known?
(If not, refer reporting person to his/her Host
Administrator).

    f.  Presumed classification of incident (i.e.,
Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, Top
Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information.  [Note: Contact
the DDN NSO should you have any questions concerning the level
of classification of a particular incident.]

    g.  Brief description of incident (Unclassified).

10.  Follow-up_Information.  Follow-up contact with Host
Administrators might be required to obtain more detailed
information that may not have been initially available.  The
DDN NSO would try to determine the following factors:

    a.  Where the activity was initiated (i.e., at another
host or specific TAC)

    b.  What routines the intruder ran on the host system

    c.  What files the intruder accessed on the host system


6-4                                            DCAC 310-P115-1

    d.  What user identification log-in was used.  For
example, was there a password?  Was the password the same as
the log-in?  Was the account password protected?  Did the user
change the password initially provided?  Security incidents
that are discovered to be a local problem will be investigated
at the Host Administrator level.

         CHAPTER 7.  TOOLS FOR INVESTIGATING INCIDENTS
                       AT THE HOST LEVEL

1.  General.  This Chapter will help you, the Host
Administrator, with investigations of security incidents that
are determined to be a local problem.  The tools available for
investigating network incidents are products of audit trail
data collected in the TAC Access and Control System for the
unclassified networks and in the audit data collection systems
of the individual hosts (if they exist) in both the classified
and unclassified networks.  The network traffic data collected
by the network utilities at the community of interest
monitoring centers is useful for network control and design
purposes, but its use for network security investigative
purposes is limited.

2.  Host_System_Logs.  The host system can provide a wealth of
information that can complement the network data.  Most
operating systems automatically store numerous bits of
information in log files.  Examination of these log files on a
regular basis is often the first line of defense in detecting
unauthorized use of the system.  Lists of currently logged in
users and past login histories can be compared.  Most users
typically log in and out at roughly the same time each day.
An account logged in outside the "normal" time for the account
may be in use by an intruder.  System logging facilities, such
as the UNIX "syslog" utility, should be checked for unusual
error messages from system software.  For example, a large
number of failed login attempts in a short period of time may
indicate someone trying to guess passwords.  Operating system
commands which list currently executing processes can be used
to detect users running programs they are not authorized to
use, as well as to detect unauthorized programs which have
been started by a cracker.

3.  Other_Tools.  The tools available for conducting an
incident investigation on unclassified nets consist of the
TACACS reports, provided to the DDN NSO, and the Host audit
and log book, if used.  Additionally, personnel may be
interviewed to provide necessary insight.  The tools available
for conducting an investigation on classified nets include the
Host audit, system logs, physical log book, and personnel as
well.  Additionally, the UID/password and the specific
terminal will provide further useful information.  No TACACS
reports are available for the classified nets.

4.  TACACS_Reports.  TACACS incident reports are reviewed by
the DDN NSO for unauthorized network activity.  Other TACACS
reports are available to the DDN NSO to help investigate
illegal or unauthorized network activity.  You as the Host
administrator can request investigative assistance from the
DDN NSO to obtain TACACS audit data for MILNET.  Assistance
may also be requested by the Host Administrator to involve an
investigating agency (e.g., FBI, OSI, NIS, MI, etc.).

SAFETY CHECKLIST  (CANADIAN TELECOM Feb 93)


Ultimately,  human factors  are the weakest  link in any protection plan.
Some of these protection steps will cost money and cause inconvenience to
your users,  but the only  way to eliminate  CPE-based  toll fraud is  to
manage equipment you control.

Your  telecommunications equipment can  be protected against virtually all
toll fraud if  you follow this checklist.  You should  consult your vendor
to obtain  detailed (in writing,  if there  are liability concerns)  about
your equipment.


     1.  Deny unauthorized access to long-distance trunking 
         facilities through your voice-mail systems.
       - block activation/assign passwords.


     2.  Secure Direct Inward System Access (DISA) numbers.
       - do not publish DISA numbers.
       - use long authorization codes.


     3.  Foil "Dumpster divers".
       - shred CDR records.
       - switch printouts and other documentation.


     4.  Change codes frequently.
       - delete former employee codes.


     5.  Secure authorization codes.
       - use many digits.
       - do not share among employees.
       - treat like credit card numbers.


     6.  Block DISA in all equipment.
       - at least restrict nights, weekends,
         holidays (prime times for fraud).


     7.  Monitor call records.
       - look for suspicious calling patterns.
       - automate exception reporting.


     8.  Restrict international calls.
       - block or selectively allow for certain
         country and area codes.


     9.  Restrict call forward.
       - do not permit forwarding to long-distance
         or trunking facilities.


     10. Secure access codes and passwords.
       - discourage employees from having them
         in plain view.
       - warn of "shoulder surfing".


     11. Secure your equipment rooms.
       - know who has access to them.
       - do not use for janitorial storage.


     12. Deactivate ports access.       
       - block access to remote maintenance ports.


     13. Keep telephone numbers private.
       - do not discuss number plan outside of company.
       - destroy old internal phone books.

Bell bans overseas card calls from pay booths

By Dana Flavelle/Toronto Star - Toronto, Ontario

     Long-distance telephone fraud is  an estimated $100 million headache
for Canadian  telephone companies and some  of their biggest customers --
and it's growing, says a telecommunications industry expert.

     "It's become a huge  issue in the last  year or so in  Canada," said
Ian Angus, a consultant who's writing a book on the subject.

     At least some  long-distance fraud is committed  by computer hackers
who gain access to major  corporate telephone networks and  start ringing
up big bills, he said.

     But most of it is "low-tech" credit  card and telephone calling card
fraud,   Angus  said  in  a  telephone  interview  following  yesterday's
announcement by Bell Canada that  it will no longer accept  overseas card
calls from pay phones.

     "We didn't want  to do this,"  Bell spokesperson Una MacNeil said in
an interview.  "We  know it's  an inconvenience.  But it's  a significant
enough  problem that we  have to put  a plug in  it until we  work  out a
longer-term solution."

     In the  past two months,  one in five overseas  calls made  from pay
telephones has been fraudulent, she said.  Bell is not revealing the cost
of the fraud for "security" reasons, she said.

     Effective yesterday,  a customer  who tries to  use a credit card or
telephone calling card to make an  overseas call from a pay phone will be
given the following options by an operator:

     []   Go to a non-pay phone to place a card call;

     []   Have the call billed to a third party, provided there's someone
          avaliable to accept the charges;

     []   Make a  collect call,  except in  cases where  no collect  call
          agreement exists between Canada and the coutry being called; or

     []   Pay cash.

     In  addition,  Bell has  stopped accepting  cash calls  from certain
kinds  of  pay  phone  to  five   overseas  contries:   China,  Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Macao and Hong Kong.

     Situated mainly in airports and major hotels,  these are the kind of
pay  phones that  simply "read"  the magnetic  strip on  the back  of the
credit or calling card, and will also accept cash calls.

     For reasons Bell officials wouldn't explain, phony cash calls can be
placed from these kinds of telephones to these specific countries.

     "We don't like to talk a lot about  this issue because we don't want
to give people ideas," MacNeil said.

     Credit cards  and calling cards can still  be used to make pay phone
calls within North America,  where fraud hasn't been a big problem,  Bell
said.

     Most of the  fraud is being committed by organized theives,  who get
hold of calling card numbers  by watching people use their  cards in busy
public places like airports, said Angus.

     Then, they set up shop around public  pay phones using those numbers
to make calls for customers who are charged about $5, he said.

     Police in Montreal busted one  racket operating  in a subway station
earlier this year, he said.

     A task force  of Bell and  Northern Telecom  engineers  is trying to
devise  electronic  ways  of  thwarting such  frauds and,  better  still,
detecting people in the act.

     MacNeil  was confident  full overseas  service  will  eventually  be
restored, but couldn't predict when.

     "It is a  large problem and we have a  lot of people working on it."
she said.

     Topic: Bell anxious to compete in cable, other markets
    Length: 2.9KB

By Kevin Dougherty/Financial Post - Montreal, Quebec

     Bell Canada  wants to be  able to  deliver  cable television or  any
other value-added  telecommunications sercice to the  homes or offices of
its telephone customers, the utility's president said yesterday.

     "The telephone  companies must  be allowed  to  fully compete in all
communications markets  for the benefit of all Canadians," Robert Kearney
said at a  Canadian Club  luncheon.  "Bell Canada should be able to carry
anything, independant of technology, for any customer anywhere."

     While   Bell  Canada  wants   the  Canadian  Radio - television  and
Telecommunications  Commision to  consider it a common  carrier,  it also
wants  "other access  carriers, like  cable companies"  to be  designated
common carriers as well.

     Kearney  said Bell Canada agrees that basic telephone service should
continue to be regulated,  paying tribute to the Canadian "social agenda"
that has allowed a 98% penetration rate for telephone service in Canada.

     But he said all other services should be deregulated.

     The regulatory  commission will have to untangle what is competitive
and what is not competitive,  he added.  The commission began hearings on
broadcasting last week and plans further consultations later this year on
telecommunications.

     Kearney said  Bell Canada is  not prepared to  offer its definitions
yet.

     But he said  that five years  from now  -- if the issue has not been
resolved  -- the cable companies and telecommunications carriers won't be
fighting over technologically irrelevant barriers.

     They will be fighting for their survival.

     "Everybody should be a common carrier," he told reporters.

     More immediately,  Bell Canada is  pressing the CRTC to grant a rate
increase, hiking charges for local calls for the first time since 1983.

     Bell Canada is allowed a rate  of return in the 12.5%-to-13.5% band,
he noted,  but this year,  the return will fall  to 10.75% and in 1994 it
will be below 10%.

     Resellers,  who buy space on Bell Canada wholesale and sell services
at a discount,  accounted  for 7% of  the telecommunications  market last
year, not the 2% the CRTC had predicted, he said.

     This year,  resellers and Unitel Communications Inc., which offers a
competing long-distance service to Bell Canada's will together hold a 15%
market share.

     Reflecting  Bell Canada's  declining revenue,  New York  bond rating
service Standard & Poor's  has lowered the  rating on its  debt.  Kearney
speculated it  could  take  another  downgrading  before Bell  Canada  is
allowed an improved rate of return.

     He said  U.S. telephone  companies  cross-subsidize  local telephone
service 2cents-3cents a minute,  while 17cents a  minute of Bell Canada's
long-distance revenue, or about $2 billion a year goes to subsidize local
service.

     "The subsidy keeps our local  rates low,  but is an incredible drain
on our competitiveness."

Broadcasteres demand cable firms pay for carrying programs

By Richard Siklos/Financial Post - Hull, Quebec

     Canada's   private  broadcasters   yesterday  appealed   to  federal
regulators for  permission to start  charging cable operators  up to $200
million a year to carry their signals.

     The  fee-for-carriage  plan put forth by the Canadian Association of
Broadcasters is  perhaps the most  radical proposal  before the four-week
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications  Commission hearing into
the structure of Canadian television.

     From the  broadcasters' perspective,  it is no  longer equitable for
cable to distribute local over-the-air  television signals without paying
for permission to do so.

     "It's an issue  of fairness,"  CAB chairman Douglas  Holtby told the
hearing. "The taking of our signals by cable is fundamentally contrary to
basic Canadian values."

     CAB is seeking between 35cents  and 80cents a month per local signal
from cable.  Its case is  supported  by an  angus  reid group  Inc. study
showing that  most  subscribers  either  believe  a portion  of  the $1.6
billion  consumers spend  on cable  already goes to private TV,  or don't
know where the money goes.

     Despite the advent  of cable only specialty services such as CNN and
The Sports Network, local  private  broadcasters, such  as those owned by
WIC   Western   International   Communications   Ltd.,   CanWest   Global
Communications  Corp. and  Baton Broadcasting Inc.,  accounted for 52% of
cable viewing in 1992.  And it is not fair,  the broadcasters argue, that
they shoulder  the burden of  producing the bulk  of Canadian programming
required by regulators.

     The  broadcasters'  plan has  met with  stiff opposition  from cable
operators,  who maintain  TV owes its  success to  cable.  Maclean Hunter
Cable TV  last week  said private TV's  aregument that  it cannot live on
advertising  revenues alone  is a result  of takeovers and the industry's
profligate  spending  on  U.S.  programming,  which  increased  from $142
million in 1985 to $248 million in 1991.

     The CAB  has similarly rejected  cable's  counter-offer  to create a
fund of  up to  $100  million a  year over  five  years  for  independant
producers.  CAB president  Michael McCabe said the cable fund would be an
administrative  nightmare that doesn't address the issue of broadcasters'
signals.

     McCabe  said the  broadcast system  would be  better served by cable
fees,  from  which  at  least  33%  and  as  much  as  100%  would  go to
programming. "I'm not impressed by your fears," CRTC charman Keith Spicer
told McCabe,  noting independent  producers have  expressed  reservations
about the plan.

     The CAB is  hoping fee-for-carriage  regulations recently instituted
by the  U.S.  Federal  Communications  Commission  will  buoy  its  case.
However,  their cable opponents privately predict the plan is doomed on a
range of fronts.

     It's 2:12AM.  I should  be heading over  to Dope's  place  tommorow.
Sometimes  I think his house is a  big black hole..  except it's not that
big,  and it's  rather colourful,  but that' s besides the point.  It's a
black  hole  in the sense that  while physical objects,  and the  thought
process remain intact,  the ability to be productive  is sucked away into
no-where!

     The  only thing we  can consistently produce  is a couple  of  large
pizza's, and a day of joy and happiness.. but then,  isn't that what I go
over there  for?  Certainly,  I don't go for  the Brampton 'chicks'.. and
there's no  way in hell I  go for the big beatiful  Brampton Downtown.. I
think I go  to have fun and pal  around with a real  freind. If you don't
have one, I suggest you pick one up.

     They make great birthday gifts..
