5.04 CyberPunk Follys
---------------------
        I have only gotten one reply to my "State Of The Union" speech, it
seems that either people don't care what I say or they areto lazy to call up my
board and give me a response.  It seems that the Hacking community has
turned to shit more then I had thought.  But maybe people will get the idea one
day and move on to a higher level.


5.04b State Of The Union Reply by Psycho
----------------------------------------
In response to Haywire's "State of Hacking Today" editorial in IRG #05, I would
like to make the following comments:

I agree with Haywire 100%- This shit over "Hacker Wars" has gotten WAY out of 
hand... What in the hell is wrong with people?!? Isn't hacking supposed to be a
means by which we SHARE information and spread the wealth of knowledge? We 
hackers have before us an incredible realm of POWER- This has been exhibited 
time and time again; Everytime you hear of some kid who hacked into NASA or 
someplace and got caught, there are probably dozens more getting away with 
something just as spectacular.

In short, we have the ability to manipulate and control the flow of ALL manner 
of electronic information. The authorities are starting to realize the actual 
scale to which systems can be hacked into, but it is far too late to do 
anything about it. For every hacker that gets busted, five more take his place-
and it's a never-ending cycle.

United and working together as one, hackers have the propensity to virtualy 
control (or shut-down) many facets of our society on a GLOBAL scale: banking, 
sattellite communications, military, law enforcement, etc., etc.... But instead
of working together, the hacker community is splintered into many factions, all
more or less working against each other. Instead of liberating information for 
all, we are instead battling it out in our own little area codes, searching for
short-lived fame.

I'm not saying that we should shut down all systems and holds the world's data 
for ransom; That would be futile. Instead, we need to help educate those with 
an interest in hacking but lack experience. Not that we should toss info out to
anyone- There are still (and always will be) certain type of people that "just 
don't get it"... A little information and a lot of stupidity can be a dangerous
thing with this type of "wanna-be". By a careful process of weeding out these 
types, the data will begin to flow into the hands of those that can best put it
to use.

So, in 1991, let's try to unify and SHARE our expertise- And I think you'll 
find that the hacking/phreaking community will benefit from this like never 
before. Hats off to Haywire and everyone else involved with the IRG for 
publishing this fine newsletter and making an effort for change.

   Ok dudes this is my phirst seriers of Anrkey philes on Kat's.  Don't you
  just hate those little pussy's, i sure in the hell do.  Anyways,  the phile
  is all How to do it yourself Home Kat abortions.  Why the reason for kats,
  well i hate the goddamn shitheads for specific reasons.  That i won't get
  into.  Well enjoy the phile and have phun.


  SHiT YA'LL NEED 

  Propane torch
  Koat Hanger
  Gloves    <should be able to resist heat>
  Rope                <optional>
  Nails               <optional>
  Hammer              <optional>
  Drugs
  & a Kat of kourse


  GET'N STARTED 

   Ok, now get the above required stuff.  Now toke a little, phry or whatever
  get's ya going.  Phirst off take the koat hanger and bend it into a phairly
  straight wire.  Take the koat hanger and make a noose on one end.  You need
  to make sure that the noose is small enuf to phit into da Kat's Kunt.

  PHUN PART 

   Ok now go out and phind yer victim.  Well you have phound a kat, put on
  the gloves so you don't get scratch to hell and back.  Now this is where
  the optional shit komes in.  You kan either Nail the phucker to the ground
  by hammer'n nails thourgh it's pheet.  This technique i phind to be the most
  effective.  Or if your one of those squemish types (why the phuck are you
  read'n this then??) you kan use the rope.  Just spread the phucker's legs
  to the phour korners.  Tie the rope around each paw and tie to something
  else.  Now you have the kat down supplied and bagged.  Reach over and grab
  your nice instrument(koat hanger) and also grab the torch.  Now you should
  be still wear'n the gloves, if not jack'n off will be a little harder phor
  you to do now.  Anywayz, heat up the end of the noose with the oval end or
  however the phuck you made it.  Wait until the shit is shine'n real bright
  orange or yellow.  Some koat hangers will even turn white, now make sure
  you don't melt the damn noose. duh  Insert the heated end of the noose into
  the kat's kunt, now jam the phucker all around, make sure you get every last
  one of those bastard kittens outta there.  After you have phinished, unnail
  or untie the kat.  Now i doubt it will walk away, but if you know who owns
  that kat, be a phriendly neighbor and drop it off at their house phor them.
  Now you really don't know which Kat is or not pregneat so hell try evey one
  of those pussy's.  Now this also works for dogs, and even try this on yer
  girlphriend if you even knock her up.


  OTHER SiCK SHiT 

   Now some other phun shit to do while do'n this.  Bring along a tape recorder
  or a kamcorder and record the shit.  Go home listen or watch it over and
  over again.  Loads of phun dude.  Now for you sick perverts,  take a knife
  and just make the kat's kunt big enuf to slide yer dick in, hell a phree
  phuck.  You kould also bang the phucker up the ass to if ya wanted.  The
  best part about this is that it's like bust'n a virgin everytime and you
  don't have to wear a kondom either!  Oh yea while ya do this phry really
  hard too.

  Yo'S & PHUCK oFF'S

                        Written EXCLUSIVELY for The IRG



For those of you who are budding anarchists or Mad Bombers, but don't feel
comfortable cooking up nitroglycerine in your mom's kitchen or making pipe
bombs in the garage, here's a fairly decent alternative that is safe, easily
transported, cheap, and effective if used properly.

All you need is a good supply of those shitty disposable lighters, like a Bic
for instance. These can be bought cheaply (or stolen, if you're so inclined) at
every damn convenience store between here and East Camelfuck, Iraq. Prices 
range from about 39 cents for averaged-sized lighters, up to about $1.79 for 
the extra-large ones, such as the Cli-Cla (my personal favorite- it is a HUGE
disposable, holding about 65% more butane than the large Bic! They're available
at fine truck stops everywhere...). Here is a chart to help you decide which
lighter is best for your explosive needs:

        Lighter                   | Size of Explosion *
       ---------------------------|----------------------------------
        Mini Bic                  | Small; 4 to 6 inch fireball
                                  |
        Scripto                   | Medium; 6 to 12 inch fireball
                                  |
        Regular Bic               | Large; 12 to 18 inch fireball
                                  |
        Cli-Cla                   | HUGE; 24 to 30 inch fireball
       --------------------------------------------------------------
*(NOTE: These sizes are only an APPROXIMATION based on past observances-
        fireball size and intensity may be affected by such factors as 
atmospheric pressure, wind speed, humidity, manufacturing defects, etc. 
Your results will vary.)

As you can see by the above chart, some of these lighters can be quite 
powerful. To give you a better frame of reference, consider the Mini Bic to be 
as powerful as an average firecracker, the regular Bic as powerful as an M-80 
firecracker ( a REAL M-80... You can only get them illegally in this country- 
they are equal to 1/4 stick of dynamite), and the Cli-Cla as powerful as 1/3 to 
1/2 stick of dynamite, under perfect conditions.


                     PREPARATION AND METHODS OF DETONATION

To prepare a lighter for use as an explosive device, the only real modification 
that must be made is the removal of the flame guard. The flame guard is the 
semi-elliptical piece of metal that is found on top of the lighter which 
encases the gas jet and flame adjustment mechanism (if present). This is easily 
removed by using a screwdriver (or even a finger) to pry away one edge of the 
flame guard, and thus popping the whole thing loose.

With the above out of the way, you are ready for the placing of the device. 
Keep in mind that since the laws of physics declare that a force will always 
follow the path of least resistance, some forethought should go into the 
placement of the device for best results. If you just want a purely-for-the-
hell-of-it explosion, the lighter can be placed on open ground, but for a 
specific purpose, such as the destruction of an object, opening of a door, 
etc., the lighter will need to be wedged as tightly as possible against the 
target.

The only "timing device" you will have, such as it is, is the actual flow of 
gas from the lighter. Some lighters have no flame adjustment mechanism, and 
thus you have very little control over when the explosion will take place. On 
lighters where the control is present, you will be able to approximate the 
point at which detonation will occur. This is accomplished by turning the 
adjustment wheel toward the <+> or <->, with the <+> side naturally exploding 
faster. In some lighters, the maximum <+> setting can be over-ridden to allow 
the butane to escape very quickly, but keep in mind that the faster the gas 
escapes, the lower the power of the resulting explosion. You may find some 
experimentation necessary with different types of lighters you plan to use      
before you can become familiar with the approximate detonation times.

Once you have decided on a target and length of time needed to escape and/or 
take cover, you are now ready to ignite the lighter. The most important element 
to keep in mind it that the gas release lever MUST remain depressed for the 
duration of time until the explosion occurs. There are many methods for 
assuring this, as pointed out below:

    A. Wedge the lever in the open position by placing an object between it and  

   the striking wheel.

B. Glue the lever down with a glob of Crazy Glue.

C. Tape the lever down with aluminum strapping tape (regular tape will not   
   work due to rapid melting).

D. Wire the lever down with a few inches of light-gauge copper wire.

These methods are not the only absolute choices you have, but I have always had 
good luck with them.

Once the lever has been secured, you need to act as quickly as possible, to 
ensure as little butane as possible is wasted. Using another lighter, ignite 
the stream of gas escaping from the one you want to explode. Another factor you 
might want to consider for timing is the physical direction of the tank of the 
lighter in relation to the flame- If the flame is above the tank (as in normal 
operation), it will take much longer for the heat to melt the plastic and cause 
the detonation than it would if the tank was placed at a 45-or-so degree angle 
with the flame being BELOW the tank. Here is a chart of approximate times based 
on positioning of lighter and gas flow:


               Gas    |   Lighter Upright   |  Lighter Inclined
               Flow   |  (flame above tank) | (flame below tank)
              ==================================================
               MIN.   |     5-10 minutes    |     3-5 minutes
              --------|---------------------|-------------------
               MED.   |     3-5  minutes    |     1-3 minutes
              --------|---------------------|-------------------
               MAX.   |     1-3 minutes     | 60 seconds or LESS

Again, these figures are APPROXIMATE- Times will vary according to many factors 
including, material used in manufacture, quality of butane, etc.

Using the above chart as a guide, plus some experimentation on your own, you 
should be able to discern timing factors relating to your individual needs in 
certain situations. Of course, lighting the butane and allowing it to melt the 
plastic tank casing is not the only method for detonating disposable lighters-
other possibilities include:

    * Affixing a large firecracker or other small explosive device to the tank

* Placing the lighter in an open flame (campfire, fireplace, etc.)

* Placing the lighter on, in, or near a heat source (engine block, tail 
pipe, oven, space heater, etc)

As you can see, however and wherever you choose to use a lighter as an 
explosive, it is a cheap and (usually) ample solution. Always use great care 
and common sense when handling ANY explosive device, and have your escape route 
or cover picked out well in advance. Also be aware that, due to the materials 
used in it's construction, an exploding lighter will hurl bits of metal and 
molten/flaming plastic, sometimes for several yards in all directions.

5.08 Vending Machine Revenge
----------------------------


                            VENDING MACHINE REVENGE


                                   by Psycho

                              Written for the IRG



How many of you have ever been ripped off by a vending machine? I would guess 
that EVERYBODY, at one time or another (and probably MANY times), has met up 
with a "change eater". This can be frustrating as hell, especially if you're 
hungry or thirsty and the machine took all the change you had. Worst of all, 
many times the owner of the machine takes his sweet time getting it fixed- 
After all, any money you lose is pure profit for him. The following is a 
collection of various techniques that have been used with great success to 
extract revenge on these money-grubbing bastards, and can put a few bucks in 
your pocket as well. I guess some unscrupulous person COULD use this 
information just to rip off other hapless consumers, but that is their 
discretion (ha ha!).

1.0 SLUGGING
    This is one of the most common forms of Vending Machine Revenge (from 
herein referred to as VMR), and also one of the safest. Basically this 
involves putting something into the machine that is not a coin, but the 
machine will think it is. Experimentation of a high degree will be in order 
here, as all machines have different levels of sensitivity. Some of the 
more common items used include: metal washers, arcade tokens, foreign 
coins, plastic discs, etc. I think you get the idea. I have even heard of 
people using a bench grinder to file pennies down to dime size, but that 
seems like an awful lot of work for 9 cents, but how you want to spend your 
time is up to you. Again, you'll have to experiment a lot with this one. If 
anyone finds some that work particularly well, leave me a message on the  
IRG/Insanity Lane node, and I'll draw up a chart for a future issue.


2.0 TIPPING
Another quite popular method, this is accomplished by physically tipping 
the machine forward as far as you can get it, hence the name. This works 
best on those machines that have potato chips and stuff dangling from long 
metal rods, and also those that use spiral rods to hold the stuff. If you 
want to use this method of VMR to the fullest, it's best to take along a 
couple of stout friends. Reason being, you will get the best results by 
practically putting the front of the machine down to the floor, and some of 
these bastards can be REAL heavy. So, DON'T try this one alone (unless you 
look like Arnold Schwarzeneggar), and make sure you do it quietly and in an 
out of the way area to avoid getting caught.

3.0 ROCKING
The Rocking method for VMR is similar to the above, but is seems to work 
best on coke machines which dispense cans. To get free cokes, you rock the 
machine back and forth, really banging the hell out of it. This confuses 
the machine's coin mechanisms, and it will usually start spitting out 
cokes. This VMR method will also require the assistance of friends, for 
obvious reasons (coke machines are the heaviest of all vending machines). 
This one must also be executed in a very deserted place, due to the 
excessive noise level created. You'll also want to remember to take along 
some backpacks, pillowcases, etc., to put your free cokes in. I have seen 
machines completely emptied using this method.

4.0 PLUGGING
So far, we've only discussed methods with which you can obtain free snacks- 
Now, here's one that can net you some good pocket change. Unfortunately, 
this will only work as described on newer coke machines. Perhaps with 
experimentation, it can be adapted for use on other machines. Plugging is 
accomplished by doing just that- you use something which will get hung in 
the coin slot, such as a penny, slug, etc., but will still fall through 
when the coin return is pressed. On newer coke machines, the coin return is 
a long piece of horizontal metal that presses straight down. After 
inserting your plug, use a flat-blade screwdriver to bend the coin return 
bar so that it cannot be depressed. Now, take the rest of the day off and 
do whatever. When you return later that night, use your screwdriver to bend 
the return lever in the other direction. When you press it down- JACKPOT! 
You get all the coins that other people have "lost" that day. Rotate among 
different machines, and don't plug the same one more than once a week to 
obtain best results. By doing this to enough machines in various locations, 
it's possible to make around $100 PER DAY (the average take for one machine 
is usually around $5). Another good place to do this occasionally is coke 
machines in expensive hotels, since they usually inflate the price of their 
drinks by 50% over normal machines. Be extremely careful and don't get TOO 
greedy, and this method is very safe.

5.0 JAMMING-1
This type of VMR is one of the best for getting lots of free stuff. What 
you do is actually jam the "product chute" (where the goods come out). Any 
manner of things can be used to do this. For instance, open the little door 
on a coke machine where the cans come out. Now, take a stick, huge wad of 
paper, etc., and cram it as far up into the machine as you can comfortably 
reach. This will block the arrival of anyone's purchase, and you only have 
to pull out whatever you blocked it with on your return to retrieve the 
stuff. On cigarette machines, you can even put tape over the side slot 
where the smokes are dispensed to accomplish this. As in some of the above 
methods, experimentation will be in order here to learn about the machines 
in your area. This is a fairly safe method of VMR.

6.0 JAMMING-2
This is the same as the above method, but instead you jam the change return 
slot. It's not as profitable as screwing up the coin return, but hey- it's 
FREE money. You may have to use a small wire to accomplish this on machines 
that have a small door that opens inward on the change slot. Again, if done 
smartly and not too often to the same machine, this VMR method is safe.

7.0 ZAPPING
Personally, I have never been able to get this one to work, but I know 
people that swear by it and say they use it all the time. Also known as 
"shorting", this type of VMR involves locating the socket where the machine 
is plugged in, and rapidly working the plug back and forth, causing the 
electronics in the machine to screw up. I'm told it only works on machines 
that have an LED display showing the amount you've dropped in. One person 
claims to have "maxed-out" the display at $9.99 and got that much OUT of 
the machine when he hit the coin return! Like I said, I've never been able 
to do this, but there are lots of people who claim it can be done. 
Experiment and find out for yourself, and drop me a line if you get it to 
work.

8.0 KILLING
This isn't as drastic as it sounds- It actually means that you unplug the 
machine, thus "killing" the power to it. Some machines, when unplugged, 
will simply NOT return any coins. And, you'd be surprised at how many 
people will go ahead and stick money in a machine, even if it's not lit 
up... And most people won't look for the plug to check it, either. This is 
a very safe, quiet method that has been proven to work on certain machine. 
As before, experiment with machines in your local area.

Well, that should be enough ideas to get you started- I'm sure there are many, 
many more. If you have a particular favorite, leave me e-mail on Insanity Lane 
and I'll include them in any future updates of this article. In the meantime, 
just remember not to get too greedy, and you can have a tidy little income from 
your VMR exploits.

of use here.


Part 1: Scanning, the art of
Part 2: Scan-Pages v1.00


Disclaimer: This phile is for informational purposes only, and I
cannot be held responsible for the actions of anyone reading it.

WARNING: If the words "k-kewl", "d00d", or "k-elyte" are a part of
your every day vocabulary, stop reading now, you are to far gone for help. 


Scanning:

Scanning is one of the most legal aspects of hacking, and a lot of fun too.
I'm not saying that scanning IS legal, I really doubt you could get anyone
to answer that question. If the SS wants to bust you, they will do it for
scanning, or anything else they feel like, if theres no law against it,
they will make one up! You can't win, so I would just recommend that you
watch your step no matter what you do.

You can scan many diferent places, like x25 networks such as TymNet and
Tele(Sprint)Net or simply telephone exchanges, which is what I'll be 
going into here: Scanning your local exchanges, I basically view this as
'getting to know your neighborhood' - its good to get an idea of how 
many modems are in yer area, and just what sort of 'puters are connected
to them. You'll more than likely come across a few Unixes, and some VMS',
if you're lucky, you'll find a LAN or WAN, and be able to reach a bunch
of different systems from one number, some of these even connect to far
systems, some with outdials (which you can scan other areas through), or
gateways (where you can hook into even more systems and/or psn's). 



Things You Need:

*Personal Computer -  (almost any type) (Amiga recommended)
*Modem - (any baud) (at least 2400 recommended)
*A Wardialer or Scanning program - These are available for just about
 every type of computer, but if you can't find one, they are easy to
 write yourself, in either basic or even scripting. (I would highly
 recommend you write your own, its a good way to get started programming
 and you can customize it to do exactly what you want it to.)
*References - You should have on hand (or commited to memory) some
 text files or manuals that will help you identify the systems you find,
 and then give you and idea of how to get in and possibly use them.
 (You can find detailed 'how to' files on just about any operating
 system you might find in many Phrack newsletters, if you don't have
 them all, get them!) - (See appendix A of this file for simple system
 identification).
*A little common sense - sorry, you're on your own with this one.


Getting Started:


Using that little bit of common sense, you should fire up your computer
and modem. (If you can't get by this part, you should stop reading this
file immediately, run down to your nearest computer store, and trade
your PC in for a nintendo!)

For best results, you will want to do some sort of sequential scan, this
way you won't miss any carriers. If you are paranoid about leaving a
sequential patern, (the SS looks for this sometimes, trying to catch
'c0dez kidz') then you will have to make some part of the dialing random.
Making the whole scan random has a few problems; if you wan't to make sure
you get all of the numbers, and don't keep going over the same ones, you
have to keep track of all the numbers dialed and check it every time
before dialing. This is a big waste of time, the best way to do a sequential
scan without a patern, is to use a node dialer. Node dialers are common
in code hacking programs, and these are easilly modified to just scan.
The ideal configuration for a node dialer (the one I use) would be to
use 10 nodes, each scanning 1000 numbers in the same exchange, then just
randomize which node is dialed.
Example:

Node 1 Dials 0000->0999
Node 2 Dials 1000->1999
Node 3 Dials 2000->2999
Node 4 Dials 3000->3999
Node 5 Dials 4000->4999
Node 6 Dials 5000->5999
Node 7 Dials 6000->6999
Node 8 Dials 7000->7999
Node 9 Dials 8000->8999
Node10 Dials 9000->9999

ATDT <prefix>+<random node>

This method is just as fast as dialing them straight out, you don't
miss any numbers, re-dial any numbers, and you aren't using any
detectable dialing pattern (other than possibly 300 calls per hour).


Now that you've got your dialer configured, you need to find a good time
to scan. Again, if you're paranoid, you should stick to scanning
between 9AM and 5PM. This is for two reasons; 1) This is the when most
buisness calls are made, and in the huge volume, you will be that much
harder to detect. 2) If you DO get busted (can you imagine going to court
for such a thing? hah!) you will have a good case, as many people dial
sequential numbers durring this time, (re: telemarketers, surveys...).
This is also probably the time when you'll be at work/school/whatever,
so you won't be needing your CPU. (I personally scan while I'm asleep,
at night - I'm not that paranoid!) As a rule of thumb, don't watch the
dialer. For some reason, no carriers are detected while you watch the
scan in process. (I've heard rumors that this is the result of a minor
disturbance in the local space-time-continuum caused by invisible 
emissions from the iris, but have seen no proof to back this theory.)

Okay, now you have your dialer ready and a good time to scan. Fire it
up and check on the progress every few hours. After you scan out a fair
sized list of carrier signals, you should give the dialer a rest, boot
your favorite term program, and investigate all your finds. Don't expect
to see something like this: "Welcome SysOp!" on the systems you check, 
in fact, expect nothing. Many systems don't wave any banners or tell
you anything, you have to try and coax a responce out of them. Things
to try would be: <Carriage Return>'s, Ctrl-C, or any other Ctrl-'s,
(if you send a Ctrl-S, be sure to send a Ctrl-Q after it, because many
systems use this as a 'halt-output' switch, and you may discover the
right keys to press, but never know it because all output is stopped.
Try sending "..." or s, [Esc], and sending a hard break almost always
gets some responce, if none of the above work, try any character on 
the keyboard, and words like "boot, start, run, load, logon, login".
If you have an external modem, keep an eye on the "Recieve Data" light,
if it flickers and you aren't getting anything echoed to your screen,
or possibly a lot of garbage characters, switch to 7E1, or call back
at a lower baud rate. (I've found a bunch of systems with modems that
will connect you at 2400, but the com ports will only transfer data
at 1200 or 300) If you try everything and can't get any responce at all,
it could be a company which turns its computers off at night, but
leaves the modem on (so call back in the day), a crashed system, or
a hacker who got your scan-call at 3am and wistled an unerring 8N1
into his reciever at a steady speed of 2400 bits per second. -heh

When(if) you identify the operating system, break out your references,
and try all the default accounts. If you get in on a default, but
you're unfamiliar with the particular OS, don't mess around, just log
off and do a little research, learn how to turn off all the logging and
cover your tracks, then go back and have phun to your hearts content.

Remember: keep notes on all the systems you find. You never know when
some ancient OS might come in handy, or what you might find that
relates to any system while trashing at a later date!

The following is a short chart to help you identify operating systems.

        This is hardly a complete list, its more or less the result
of boredom, and fairly random scanning through an outdial, it does
cover about 1/3 of the 619-753 exchanange, but I never finished because
of lack of time and other projects taking precedence. I would like
to try and organize a concerted effort to map out any/all NPA's, and
eventually publish a masterlist of all detectable carrier signals. Its
easy to do, and you can usually let yer computer scan while yer gone
to school/work, so if you'd be interested in helping out, leave me a
note on one of the IRG boards and tell me the NPA and exchanges you'd
be able to scan, via local call or some sort of outdial, so we can make
sure that different people aren't wasting time scanning the same exchanges!
Anyone who helps to build the list will get full credit in IRG News, and
be privy to all versions of the pre-released masterlist, including any
system logins found on any of the carriers.





        Until next time...

CompuServe Information Service is one of the largest commercial systems
available today, with over 600,000 members, hundreds of Forums(SIGs),
access to a managre of data bases globally, and boasts local access in
almosy every city in the USA, and quite a few world wide. CS is located 
in Doublin Ohio, and employs approximately 40+ microcomputers, most of
which are DEC KL-10 or chained SC-30 CPU's, running highly customized
software, written mostly in BLISS, FORTRAN, MACRO-10 and (more recently)
in 'C'.



Dialling CS:

To find a CS port in your area, you can call Customer Service at
(800)/848.8990, tell them you're travelling and need a dialup for
the XXX (your area code) area. You may also reach CS through just about
any of the Packet Switching Networks. (Telenet, TymNet, DataPac, LATA).
For Telenet, the NUA is: 202202, -or- 614227. From a TymNet port, type
'CPS' after the terminal identifier.
Note on dialling CS directly: After connecting, hit Ctrl-C, or [RETURN]
and then 'CPS' at the 'Host Name:' prompt.




Generating Accounts:

There are several ways to generate CS accounts, I'll briefly go into
each. The only 'default' accounts I've come accross so far are these:

User ID: PHONES
Password: PHONES

;This one will only let you look up CS access numbers, or report problems.
;which could be useful, if you wanted to vary the numbers you call in to,
;for security reasons. (most places have more than one dialup, in addition
;to whatever PackNets available.

User ID: 77770,100
Password: FREE-DEMO

;This isn't to useful, as it only lets you 'ride' along a guided tour
;of the system -- though I'd recommend it for getting used to the 
;command structure and just having a looksee.




First thing you need is a sign-up User ID, Password and Agreement number.
Here is how to get one:

Intro-Pac:
---------
These are usually included with your modem when you buy it, so you might
have one already! - if not, you can purchase one in most computer stores,
and some book stores. (or just rip it open in the store and memorize the
ID, password and agreement number). The intro-pac is superior to the other
methods of obtaining sign-up ID's, because it isn't as limmited. With an
account generated by an intro-pac, you can access just about anything
a regular CS subscriber can.

Intro-Pac note: Try reusing the intro-pacs, it usually won't work, but
several times I've gotten two ID's from one pac.


Ziff Account:
------------
These are try-out accounts available to subscribers of PC Magazine and
ZMac. They are usually VERY limmited, without a second password, you
cannot get to CS, you'll be stuck in PC-Magnet.

The current PC-Magnet sign-up ID is:

User ID: 177000,5000
Password: PC*MAGNET 
Agreement Number: Z10D9000

Ziff Note: The User ID and Password are permenant, but they periodically
change the Agreement number. I've noticed that it usually goes up, in
multiples of 10, so if you get a message saying that the agreement number
is outdated, try something like: Z10D9110 or similar - or better yet,
find someone who subscibes to PC Magazine and just ask them.

More Ziff Notes: There is currently a hole in the account limmitations
on Ziff accounts; if you choose a European address (see "Billing Info")
you will be able to access the CS system, and have the same privs/abilities
as a Intro-Pac generated account. I don't expect this hole to remain forever,
so have fun while it lasts. - Also, choosing a European billing address
might make it difficult to get your seccond password, so this account
would only last until that took affect (usually 10 days).


Social Engenering:
-----------------
You can call up CS at (800)/848.8990 and tell them:

* You just saw a commercial or read and ad with the number and are
  curious about CompuServe - they will ask some questions and will
  either give you a sign-up id, or try and 'send you more info' -
  try and get the id and tell them you want to look around first.

* Tell them you want to sign up for 'The Source'.
  CS bought the Source and is trying to convert all former or 
  possible members. (this will work much like the above method).

* Tell them you saw it on 'NetWork Earth' and want to try the demo.
  (NetWork Earth the TV program has a forum (SIG) on CS and is
  promoting a try-out demo).

Social Engenering Note: Do NOT try telling them you lost you password,
they never give them out, they just send them in the mail. Also, if you
fear ANI on the 800 number, the Columbus number is: (614)/457-8650



Billing Info:
 
After you obtain a sign-up ID, and sign on, it will ask you a lot of
silly questions, most of which you can just breeze through and answer
in whatever way you want to, however there are two important parts
you will need to get right; the billing address, and the CCard number.

Billing Address:
---------------
If you want a permenent account, or at least a long lasting one, you
will need to use an address where you can pick up the second password.
You will also need to use a valid CC number, or shortly after you
do get that second password, the account will be suspended for charges
not authorized anyway.

If you only need the account for a little while, just make something up.
The account will last about 10 days, which is when the mail-only second
password should have arrived. There is a loop-hole here also; if you
log on on the 10th day, a little before midnite (not more than 15 minutes
before, and definitely NOT after), you can 'GO PASSWORD' to change your
password, and hang there at the prompt until after midnite, then enter
a new password. If you do this on the exact day, you'll increase the shelf
life of the account by about another week, at that time, you will recieve
a message upon logon that your charges have been refused and it will prompt
you for new billing information before proceding -- just use the same
stuff you did the first time, that should last you another 2 to 4 days, 
depending what day of the week it is. Thats about as far as you can
squeeze it, because at that time they will try to call you voice and
hassle you.


Credit Card Info:
----------------
CompuServe will only accept true card numbers, just making one up is
completely out of the question. It does accept cancelled cards however,
so feel free to use any old card #'s you may have around (if you only
want a temporary account, that is). -- For this reason, you cannot use
CS as a way of checking to see if cards are valid or not.




Once you're in:

If you have the IQ of a small rock, you should have had no problem 
aquiring an account. Here are some of the things you can now do with
your account:


Important Commands:
------------------
 
GO   - the go command is what takes you places, you use it to move
       to differen't areas on the system. (re: "GO IBM" will take you
       to the IBM subsystem) This command can be shortened to 'G',
       (re: "G IBM") and case is NOT sensitive anywhere on the system.

FIND - very useful, you just type: "FIND subject" and it will give you
       a list of related sections along with their GO command keyword
       and page number. (re: FIND modem).

HELP - doesn't need any explanation :-) (there are help screens for 
       every area on CS, make use of them).


Areas:
-----

FORUMS: GO FORUMS

Forums  or SIGs are like mini-bbs's. They each have a number of message
bases, file libraries and a real-time chat or conference area. There are
forums for just about everything you can imagine, with PD software,
informational text files and a lot of other goodies. I won't go into the
special forum command structue, just use the HELP feature and you'll be ok.

Some noteworthy forums: 

DECUNET - a wealth of information to be found here.
IBMBBS  - ms-dos telecomm stuff
ROCKNET - excellent COnferences are held here
PRACTICE- you can find info on all other cis commands in this forum's LIBs
and many more


DATABASES: 

There are over 1000 databases you can search via CS, ranging from stuff like
Colleges and Magazines in print to your up the minute local weather forecast
and an AT&T buisness yellow pages. Find data bases with the FIND command.


CB Simulator: GO CB

This is the online-chat system. CB is just like the COnference areas in the
forums, but attracts a much larger crowd. At peak hours, you can find 
between 200 and 300 or more users on the chat system. Type: "/?" or "/H" for
a list of available commands here. Note: all commands are preceded with
a slash (/) in COnference or the CB simulator (re: "/GO IBM").

CB Notes: On Band B of the CB Simulator, you may encounter many CS employee
accounts (see "Account Numbers") beware them. -- I'd recommend staying on
Band A. 
* This is by far, one of the best chat systems I've ever seen.




CompuServe Mail: GO MAIL

This is CompuServe's E-Mail system, and is VERY powerful. The docs to this
alone are far longer than this entire file. I would suggest that you;
GO MAIL, and then type the following: "HELP ..." -- this will print out
the mail documentation and all its features. (its about 30-40 pages, make
sure you have a capture buffer open, or your printer on!)

Some Mail Features Include:

* Sending Mail to any other CompuServe member, or CompuServe Mail 
  subscriber. (text or binary mail transfer are available, with or
  without a transfer protocol).

* Sending a hard copy letter anywhere that has an address -- I wouldn't
  recommend this, for obvious reasons.

* Sending to any FAX machine -- GREAT feature.

* Sending to any BitNet or InterNet address -- (yea cyberspace!)

See the Mail HELP facilities for information on any of the above, and more.

Account Numers:
--------------
70000,xxxx   - Said to be CS security accounts, but the only ones I've seen
using these are CS employed programmers and high level execs. -- This type
of account carries the highest privelge level.

70003,xxxx
70004,xxxx   - These are CS employee accounts. For the most part, people
using these aren't dangerous, they are free of connect charges but usually
(not always) without special command templates.

70005,xxxx   - A standard demo account. Commonly used by Radio Shack and
other computer stores, or even museums. (usually there is no one operating
these accounts)

70006,xxxx   - Standard WizOp account. Tthese people can kick you offline
instantly, or GAG you. People using these accounts are usually product
managers, or SysOps of CS owned Forums. Beware these accounts.

70007,xxxx   - Complimentary account. These accounts are given to people
who write books on CS or other such material.

767xx,xxxx   - This account is ambiguous, and carries many different
privelige flags. Privately owned forum SysOps may use these accounts,
as well as Forum Co-Sysops, Message SysOps, Customer Service, and the
CB-Helpers. To be on the safe side, steer clear of these.

7xxxx,xxxx   - A regular CS subscriber.

1000xx,xxxx  - This is the new account format given to all non-US subscribers.
If you sign up with a European or Japanese mailing address, your account
will look like this. (Note: using one of these accounts from a US CS port
may look suspicious, recommend using a packet network with these.)


Account Number Notes: Privilege and FREE flags may be attatched to ANY
account numbers, including WizOp flags, so look at every account, even
the most common as a possible CS security person.



Hidden Areas:
------------
There are many areas on CS which will not show up with the 'FIND' command.
These may include; special testing areas, areas closed for one reason or 
another, or private Forums (SIGs), once in a while you can stumble onto 
these by more or less 'scaning' GO [keyword]'s. Keep your eyes open, you
just might find something interesting.
Some of the places I've found are:
The SysOp Forum  - GO SYSOP
CB Bands C and D - GO CB3 and CB4
There are many more, I'm sure, just look. -- Some areas like these aren't
accessable directly, if you find one of these, try going to the page
beyond them, then hit 'B' for backup, or go to the root page, and from
there "GO xxx" where xxx is a number 2-999.


Special Messages:
----------------
While in a Forum COnference, or on the CB simulator, you may recieve 
a message stating that "your language or actions have been deemed
unacceptable and any continuance of such will result in account suspension."
If this happens, you know you are being monitored, so it would be a good 
idea to hangup.

While logging on, you might get a message stating that your account has
been temporarilly suspended. This means they are on to you, don't try
usng that account again.

While logging on your password may come up invalid. This is OK, it just
means you didn't get your second password,a nd they are problably NOT
on to you, but if you don't have the second password, this account is
history.


Nodes:
-----
These are a three letter abreviation of the city you're calling from.
Usually not useful, but I would watch out for anyone logging on from
Doublin Ohio, as these people may very well be logging on via console.
For a list of nodes; "FIND nodes" -or- there is a compiled list downloadable
from both the PRACTICE and CBFORUM libraries.

 
Tips and Tricks:
---------------
Use common sense. Don't look for someone using a CS employee account and
send them a "FUCK YOU!" message, don't use a name like "The Ultimate Hacker!",
maintain a low profile and enjoy. Notes on calling: vary youre calls,
you can usually find at least 3 or 4 different numbers in any city wich you
can connect through. If you are really paranoid, do something like this...
DIVERTER->TymNet->Outdial->Telenet->Outdial->CS Port --- hehe this will
slow down transmitions, but I think you get the idea.

 
Note: I gathered all the information in this file on my own, through
trial and error, and talking to friendly CS SysOps, but I thought I'd
mention these previously released CIS files, since it was after reading
them, and finding them either useless, incorrect and/or out of date
that I got the idea to put together this file. Files as follows:
"Hacking Compuserve Information Service" - By Shadow Lord Esq.
"Compuserve Info" (Phrack #8) - By Morgoth and Lotus

5.11 DOS Tips by </\>asteland </\>arrior
----------------------------------------

A lot of times games require you to put them on separate floppies 
in order to install them.  Since floppies are slow and not always 
available, I decided to write an article that quickly covers some 
tricks that others might not use to bypass the disk checks.

Most  programs  just look for A:FILENAME.EXE so  no  matter  what 
subdirectory  it may reside in, the program is checking  whatever 
directory  A:  is  currently set to (via  CD\).   For  these  use 
ASSIGN.  The format is:
     ASSIGN x=y 
     where x is the floppy drive and y is the hard drive 
Example:  ASSIGN A=C.  Now you can type A: and simply go  to  the 
directory the game is in and install it.  ASSIGN makes drive x an 
exact  copy  of  drive y, including directories.   To  reset  all 
drives, simply type ASSIGN with no parameters.

Some  programs look for A:\FILENAME.EXE so the files must  be  in 
the root directory.  You could use ASSIGN but then your root  dir 
gets all messy.  In this case use SUBST.  The format is:
     SUBST d: d:path
     where  d: is the drive you will refer to and d:path  is  the      
     directory that SUBST will refer to.
To remove an assignment:
     SUBST d: /D
     where d: is the drive to remove
Example: SUBST A: C:\SAVAGE

Sometimes  they get real tricky and check for SUBST or  ASSIGN... 
in  order  to  fool these, you'll need  DesqView  or  some  other 
multitasking program (DesqView being the best).  Setup as large a 
DOS  partition  as possible with whatever options you  think  the 
program  will  use.  Be sure to allow it to be swapped  to  disk.  
Right  before  the program will check for the  files,  switch  to 
another  DOS shell and load ASSIGN or SUBST, then switch back  to 
the  install... this may hang some machines but it usually  works 
fine for me.

SUBST and ASSIGN are both built into Digital Research DOS 5.0 and 
the commands should be very similar on IBM DOS if not exactly the 
same.

5.12 Running The ShadowNet
--------------------------
        ShadowNet is working, but having problems becuase I only have two
members and it is hard to help people who are a few hundred area codez away.
I have one new member, Pyscho, who will be a big help and I hope the rest of
you people out there will come over and join us...


5.13 VMB's From Hell

        I have found no support for this section of the newsletter so it will
no longer be in service...Sorry.
