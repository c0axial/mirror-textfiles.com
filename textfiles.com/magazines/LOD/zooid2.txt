                  The Legion of Doom is NOT back.
    

  Approximately two weeks ago I issued an announcement that I
intended to revive the former supreme hacking group The Legion
of Doom. While this was a sincere effort on my part to bring the
hacking community back to its glory days, recent events
suggest to me that my efforts were misguided and that my
energy can be best applied to other ventures. While it is true
that I want to help the hacking/phreaking scene to rise from
its current nadir, this clearly cannot be accomplished by
attempting to revive a group that is best left in the realm
of past history, nor by appropriating a name which neither I nor
anyone else not associated with LOD has a right to use.
 
 Following release of my message proclaming the return of the
golden days of hacking and the Legion of Doom I was contacted
by both voice and netmail by several members of the former
Legion of Doom. After a few discussions and hearing what they
had to say and their view on this I began to realize several
things. First, I do not have a legitimite right to use the LOD
name because I was never afiliated with the original group and
(truth be told) I do not possess at this time the hacking
and phreaking knowledge which would have gotten me into the
group to begin with if it were still around. Second, even if I
were an original member I would still not have a right to use
the name; the group is disbanded and no one (except maybe the
founder?) can ever assemble it again. The best thing to do is
to let the LOD name live in history only and be retired in
dignity. I regret that I may have tarnished the LOD name and
reputation with my actions. Third and lastly, even if I had a
right to use the name, it does not make any sense to do it.
Experienced hackers and phone phreakers could just as easily
be assembled under an entirely different group name (such as
"the Digital Intruders") and still rise to pre-eminence in the
hacking community. A group of good hackers by any other name
could be just as elite. Basicly, nothing is gained by using
the LOD name and in persisting to do so would be risking the
acrimonious contempt of the real LOD and the whole net.
  
  Finally, I hope this message will cause the whole affair to
just die off. Since 99% of the response I got was negative and
I have not yet received any articles for publication, I here
and now declare my part in the futile LOD revival to be
ended. I apolgize for any inconvenience/aggrevation that I
may have caused anyone, especially but not limited to the
following real LOD ex-members: The Marauder, Lex Luthor, 
Professor Falken, Mark Tabas, Bill from RNOC, Lord Digital, 
Doctor Who, and Phantom Phreaker.
 
  All of the ex-LOD members that I spoke with were curteous and
no one has made any threats of any kind to my person or
telephone. I appreciate their patience with my sincere but
misguided folly. It was the product of inexperience, not
malice.
