Anyone hacking in Melbourne and Victoria in general, should understand the
above.  Lets face it, they have gone too far.   As soon as the new laws were
passed, they unleashed their terror, purpouse of which was to scare us, and
I am afraid It worked.  As soon as the word got out that boards were being
raided, by the feds and friends, over 50% of existing hacking establishments
have been whiped from the face of this earth, and virtually all the rest have
been so severelly straightened out, and that's not funny.  Apart from
The Realm, there are two hacking boards still operating as before, with just
one being of decent quality. Congratulations to the sysop. You know who you are
.
Lets just hope things will get back to normal soon.  I would just like to say
few words to telescum and DI if they're watching.
"You haven't killed the hackers, they will always haunt you. All you achieved,
is to remove the only means by which you can find out what we are up to"

I must admit they got to me as well,  but sometimes, you got to say what the
fuck, and go for it. As a result here it is, Globe Trotter Volume #5 and plans
are on the way for future issues, which I hope will get even bigger and better.

Look on the bright side, if you ever stuff things up, ten years in jail will
go very quickly and there is nothing few cc's of Ethylene Glycol can't fix.

PHREAKING
~~~~~~~~~

I don't really want to write this section, so I will try to organise someone
else to do it for me.  One of the reasons being that I have enough to do
with the rest of the file, and I know there are people out there far more
qualified in the art of Phreaking.   Phreaking is technically, ripping off
the phone companies, which I think is ok, since they rip us of rather badly
themselves.   Phreakers however define phreaking, as using the resources
available for the sake of knowledge. There is no doubt everyone has their own
definition.   To get started, I'll talk about the technology, what systems
are being used and how they work, as well as other related topics.  This is
only an introduction, based on the technical side and on how the system works.
 The Information on HOW TO, will follow over the next few issues.

CLASSES OF TRANSMISSION MEDIA
=============================

OPEN WIRE         This is the most original of all transmission media. It
                  consists of a pair of copper wires strung between telephone
                  poles, carrying one voicegrade channel that is used
                  alternately by a number of subscribers on the network. One
                  pair of wires can serve only two points at a time. Since the
                  early days of telephone, wire pairs have largely been
                  replaced by other transmission media for voice
                  communications, but are still used in certain countries and
                  even certain rural areas of AUSTRALIA, USA, CANADA etc. For
                  data transmission over long distances, wire pairs are not
                  desirable since they are suceptible to such problems as cross
                  talk, electromagnetic interference, loss of attenuation,
                  etc., resulting in poor line quality.


CABLE             The cost of installing open-wire pairs and the rapidly
                  increasing requirement for transmission channels soon led to
                  the bundling of insulated wires into a large cable, with each
                  pair uniquely coloured for identification. As many as
                  several hundered pairs of wires can be bundled in one cable.
                  This method not only reduces cost of installing telephone
                  facilities, but also protects the wires from the elements.
                  Most telephone lines between central offices and local
                  subscribers are cables. Significantly, each pair of wires is
                  now capable of carrying a number of voice channels.

COAXIAL CABLE     A coaxial cable is composed of a conductive cylinder with a
                  wire in the center, with the space between the conductive
                  cylinder and the wire filled with insulating medium. A
                  coaxial cable can transmit at a much higher frequency than a
                  wire pair, allowing greater amounts of data to be transmitted
                  in a given time period, that is, the channel is "wider". A
                  great number of voice channels can be sent over coaxial
                  cables, which are shielded from noise and other forms of
                  distortion.

CARRIER SYSTEM    A carrier system is not a physical entity, rather, it is a
                  technique of utilizing various transmission media. Through
                  the use of multiplexing techniques, a carrier system can
                  accomodate a number of channels on the same physical line, be
                  it an open wire pair, cable, or a coaxial cable, by placing
                  each channel on a different frequency level.


HIGH FREQ. RADIO  Instead of sending electrical signals over metallic media as
                  in the cases of open wire, cable and coaxial cable, a
                  long-wave radio system transmits radio signals over ope air
                  space at a specific portion of the frequency spectrum. High
                  frequency means that a much larger number of signals can be
                  transmitted, compared with other media.

MICROWAWE         MIcrowave transmission utilizes the high end of the radio
                  frequency range and requires special equipment for
                  transmission and reception. It is currently being used by
                  common carriers and specialized common carriers alike,
                  primarily on long-haul communications links. Its advantage
                  over radio, and cable systems is that it requires less
                  frequent reamplification, and that no wire stringing is
                  needed. Also, the possible bandwidth capacity is much greater
                  with microwave radio transmission. By the same token,
                  microwave transmission requires a line of sight path; a high
                  transmission tower and antenae are also needed. A
                  long-distance microwave line is made up of a series of relay
                  towers spaced approximately 30 miles apart, with every two
                  consecutive towers within sight of each other. Signals are
                  amplified and retransmitted by the towers along the route.


SATTELITES        These are, in fact forms of microwave transmission in that
                  the satellites which orbit around the earth in
                  geo-synchronous orbits, represent relay stations for earth
                  bound communications links. This type of microwave
                  transmission is ideal for long-distance communications since
                  the high altitude of the satellite avoids the interference
                  caused by earth's curvature and other physical obstructions
                  such as mountains and atmospheric conditions. A large number
                  of communication satellites are now orbiting the earth, and
                  are utilized for domestic as well as international
                  communications.


UNDERSEA CABLE    These are special types of coaxial cables laid on the seabed
                  across the ocean. They provided an important means for
                  intercontinental telephone communications before the
                  introduction of the satellites, and are still used heavily.

WAVEGUIDES        These are metal tubes that serve as paths and confinement for
                  very high frequency radio waves. There are two types of
                  waveguides: rectangular and circular. The rectangular
                  waveguide has been used for some time as a feder line between
                  microwave antennae and their associated ground equipment. It
                  is useful only for very short distances, usualy not more than
                  1000 feet. The circular waveguide can provide much longer
                  transmission lengths and is being implemented on Experimental
                  Basis. Waveguides can prowide vast transmiossion capacity for
                  voice as well as data. They hae beep,proven feasible, but
                  their large scale implementation will most probably never
                  take off.

FIBRE OPTICS      Fibre optic Cables a really a form of a waveguide, in this
                  case light waves are used.  The high frequency means a very
                  large number of logical channels can be transmitted over a
                  single fibre.  Fibre optic cables are now replacing the wire
                  pairs, and allready are being used for links between
                  subscribers and the local offices, where as few years ago,
                  they were restricted to land lines and inter-exchange lines.
                  This transmission medium, is likelly to dominate the world of
                  telecomunications, within the next few years, because it is
                  cheap and free from distortions and electromagnetic
                  interference, which the wire pairs and other cables suffer.
                  A single Fibre Optic Cable is very thin, thus hundereds of
                  strands can be bound together into a small sized cable, and
                  at 2 cents per meter, per strand, it is becomming very
                  economical.

LASERS            Laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission
                  Radiation. Just like the fibre optic transmission, a laser
                  utilizes a much higher portion of the electromagnetic
                  spectrum. It can thus be used for transmission without tying
                  up all ready crowded radio frequency spectrum. The laser is
                  limited to communications along a line of sight, which
                  suggests a possibility for short links betwwen large
                  buildings for example. The laser is still being developed,
                  and posible hopes are for communications with satellites and
                  over interstellar distances.

I have set a limit to the maximum size of each file, and I seem to be going

TRIX OF THE TRADE  -  LOOPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is very hard to find a loop in Australia, and I guess you can all imagine
how many uses they have. There are rumours that they do exist down here, but
as I yet I have never seen a REAL ONE. Luckilly, there are ways around
everything.
There are certain numbers, which you can call, mainly some old PBX's and my
favourite an out of order telecom recorded message service.  Next thing you
will need is to boost the signal which your phone sends out, so that the
current leaks across the relays and other circuits.  Basically if you can
find the right number, and there are a few around, you can create your
own artificial bridge. Then if people call the same number, there is enough
signal leaking from one line to another to get an audible connection. If
you are lucky, you will not need any extra hardware to boost the signals
from your phone. This is usually the case if you can come across a telecom
recorded message service which is out of order. They work exceptionally well.

The second method of building your own bridges, involves few alterations
to a telecom junction box.  It is a relativelly simple circuit and all you
have to do is pick two or more people and install it on their lines. The
circuit has to keep the line open, after the real user hangs up the phone.
Second thing, via few resistors you connect two lines with an identical
circuit on each. Thus one person calls one number, other the second,
say it was a wrong number when the real owners answer and after they hang up,
the two lines get connected. This is the most simplest circuit, all it does is
keep the line open, Connect the two lines after the real owner has droped
his receiver and disconnect you as well as the link when he picks up the
phone. Basically when the owner drops the line it activates a switch which
keeps it open and links with another, and when he picks up the phone it turns
itself off, cutting the link and disconnecting you.  This also makes an ideal
phone tap, since you can listen in from any phone anywhere in the world.

If you happen to be a serious electronics buff, then something a little more
elaborate is possible.  A circuit that hooks up 3 line and is controlled
from one line. If you send a particular tone or sequence of pulses, you
can activate/deactivate the connections to the other lines and even use them
as extenders.  Basically the sky is the limit and all of the circuit are
cheap to construct,  and can be made reasonably compact.

This is a very interesting System, I have found in HONG KONG.  (yes, the
complete scans are comming soon).  It is most probably an outdial, or some
some sort of a datafax conversion service which it claims to be. I have no
idea what a datafax conversion service does, but it does prompt you to enter a
number, and the accepted format is identical to the local phone numbers.

DNIC UPDATES
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The number of networks is growing every day, and any new network is mostly
virgin territory, full of bugs, and security faults.   I will have a revised
listing of all the dnics in few months time, but at the moment, here are few
new networks and updates which I came up with this month.

CONTRIBUTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Globe Trotter has been running for almost half a year now, and it now enjoys
international audiences, so how about putting something back into it.  I am
really finding it hard to come up with the usual two files, and i can no
longer release one issue every month, although I'll keep trying.
If you have anything please mail me.  We require Information, Files, Sample
Logins of Hacked Systems, Nua's, ANYTHING.

Ahhh, this reminds me. As you may have noticed, I am obssesd with mapping out
the networks on this earth, and I really get exited every time I make a new
entry into the Realm Dbase, which now occupies arround 1 meg. If anyone has
any Primes (with Netlink) they would like to contribute to the cause, I'll
supply you with all the results gained, and I will give the use of the dbase
which we all ready have, for searches and for info on particular areas.
(Not the complete Dump by the way!).
Secondly, if anyone would like to co-ordinate scanning from a particular
system, or the areas being scanned, Please, again contact me, since a lot
of resources would be saved.
Lastly, if you have your own compiled lists of NUA's or even single adresses,
I would also appreciate their donation. A lot of little bits make up something
really nice.

Now, to the problem of actually getting the information to me. Well, I have a
mailbox on Altos which I visit quite often, so that's a good place to start
(username: force), or I can be reached via these BBS's.

                       MEGAWORKS
                       PACIFIC ISLAND
                       THE FORGOTTEN REALM (USA)
                       ZEN
                       GREYHAWK

Or you can pass the info along any member of The Realm, and please put the date
on the file, and your handle if you want credit to be given where credit is
due.  Thanx!

PRIME ACCOUNTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It would be too long and too hard to explain the step by step procedure
involved in setting up accounts on primes, so you can use the help files
which are online, and battle your way through it on your own.  Just use
some common sense and you should be all right, provided it's a version
19.x and higher. Anyway, here are some important tips and information,
which will be of use to you.


Primos 17.4   Arrrggghh, This is a real bastard.  I have recently played with
              such a system in Brazil and have stuffed it up pretty well.
              I didn't have enough time to learn too many things, but I can
              tell you what i did, and what mistakes I have made. First of all,
              a little about the early versions of primos, which are not far
              behind the dinosaurs.  There are very few help files online, and
              almost no help for the utility used to create accounts. Secondly,
              The familiar comand EDIT_PROFILE does not exist. The command to
              create new users in this case is ULM.  This brings up an
              important point.  The command names often vary from one revision
              to another, and some have lot more commands. To find what is
              available, attach to the CMDNC0 directory, and have a look. This
              is how I found the ULM command.  It is then a matter of trying
              the various commands untill you get the right one. Often its
              name will suggest it's function. OK do this.

OK, A CMDNCO
OK, CATA      (note CATA is a much nicer catalog Command, if it's not installed
               use LIST instead)

              When you type ULM, you will be prompted for a username, and
              password. This means you can use any account to create the users,
              as long as you know the password for the high level account.
              This is very good, since you don't have to log on under that
              command, which helps to keep the account alive.
              Once you're in, you have several commands available.
              WARNING! Before you experiment with anything, get out of the
              record you have logged under.  When you type LIST, you will get
              the statistics of the account you are logged under and any
              changes will be made to this record.  Note all the details
              you are given, and type USER USERNAME.   If the username exists,
              you will access the USERNAME record, otherwise you will be
              prompted whether you want to create the user, so just respond
              with YES or NO. Don't type USER on it's own, for it will return
              an error and dump you out of the program. If you respond YES,
              you will be asked few questions about the account, access level,
              group etc, so just duplicate the results you have seen with the
              LIST COMMAND previously.   To change the entry of a particular
              User, attach to it, then type commands such as 'GROUP NEWGROUP'
              which changes the Group to Newgroup, ACCOUNT NAME, which changes
              the account name to 'NAME' (i think).  PASSWORD NEWPASSWORD will
              change the password.   There is something very beautiful from
              a hackers point of view.  The passwords for each record are
              printed out in hexadecimal, so instantly you can get all of the
              user passwords.
              Now we're getting to the part where I stuffed things up.  I found
              a command called RESUME. When I typed it, I was prompted for a
              file name. I tried to abort, not wanting to change anything, but
              it took my atempt to abort as the file name.  I am not exactly
              sure what the command did, but I could not run the ULM program
              again, and when attempting to log on, I got a command file not
              found error and was logged out.  I think, it either changes the
              login command file for the account, the login directory, or it
              changes the file from which all the Record Data is being taken
              for each account. Without a manual, I can't tell you what it is
              I actually did, but I recomend you keep away from that command,
              if like me, you don't know what you're doing.


Well, at least they had the good sense to make the more up to date versions
of primos far more user friendly.  There are online help files to help you
create accounts, so by all means use them.  All the commands you need will
be given to you when you type EDIT_PROFILE, followed by HELP, so I will not
go into that, but here are some tips, which apply to creating accounts on
All systems.

Before you start, list all the information on other users, in full, and make
a note of all the details you are given.  You will find that you need to know
information about which login directory to assign as well as which group, to
make the account blend in.  Secondly, look at the user names, and pick a
username that looks like it's meant to be there. In other words, use the other
users to hide your own account.  it would be stupid to create a user called
'RADICAL' for example when all other usernames lok like COM10023, COM10064 etc.

As far as your login directory goes, see whether users have a common directory,
or each has their own.  You can then either create yor own for the new account,
or simply use one of the communal ones.   I personally prefer not to create
my own directories, but to use existing ones, with  large numbers of entries.
Again you can blend in any files you want to use, with the right choice of
words, and with 500+ records in the directory looking simmilar, it makes it
very hard indeed to spot anything odd, particularly if the directory
experiences frequent use.

Last bit of advice I can give is to get manuals IF POSSIBLE!, and try to cut
down on the amount of blind experimenting. This means, find as much as you can
about the system before hand.

THUNDER DOWN UNDER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, the time is comming.  Thunders court case comes up on the 30th of August.
Unfortunatelly I will not be in Melbourne at the time, but I have no doubt,
a majority of the hacking community will attend.  It will bring tears to
your eyes either from Joy or Despair, how ever you are inclined.  Some people
are planning to bring a large supply of Condoms and Candle Sticks, to hand
over as the neccesities when the sentence is passed.
VERY CRUEL, BUT VERY CUTE GUYS!

Ahh well, it will not be long.  CAN THUNDER DO IT YET AGAIN, AND ESCAPE THE
HANGMAN'S NOOSE FOR THE FOURTH TIME?   Miracles do Happen, and knowing Thunder,
anything is possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATAPAC NETWORK PROFILE   PART #3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the Last Issue for a while that will have any Datapac NUA's.  I am sick
of this network now, and it's time to move on.  I have found some new areas
which I have yet to sprint so there will be another feature on Datapac, but
I'll Leave that for the far Future.

OK, SO I HAVE LIED -  I have just discovered that I don't have enough space
to put all the Datapac Areas Into this file.  There are But Only few left,
So I will Add them in next Month, with some smaller network.

                     IN THE NEXT ISSUE OF GLOBE TROTTER
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Definatelly the last of Datapac for a while.  I will release some Nua's
  either from PSS, DATEX-P or one of the Asian Networks Not Exactly sure
  which, so it will be a surprise.

- I am planning a Guided Tour of The Realm, so it might be in the next issue,
  in which case it will be larger then usuall.   Lot of people wanted to have
  a look around, so this is the only possible way.

- Various Bits of information which I hope will come up in time

Till Volume #6
