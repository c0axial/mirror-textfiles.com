NOTE:  I have removed the NUA from the above contact messages.  I mean, the
       yanks seem to have an endless supply of nui's and since there are
       over 200 million of them?  Well, I guess you can imagine the sort of
       congestion problems it creates.

FROM THE EDITOR:

There is one thing which is holding down the expansion of phreaking and more
local Hacking in this country, and that is the blatent inefficiency of telecom.
It makes my blood boil when my $200 + bill comes, knowing all of that is
from the few attempts I make each night on Exchnage Scanning.   We know that
there are a lot of things phreaks use in the states which is common to
Telscum, but finding a steady supply is very difficult.   We are being charged
20.1c for each local call, and massive phone rentals as well as the exchange
costs and the equipment.  Makes you feel rather ripped off when countries like
USA, CANADA etc have got free local calls in most areas.  For one thing,
using a computer to scan an exchange 24 hrs a day would no longer be a fantasy
if telescum took the example of some US Companies.
All I can say, till they come down to earth,  and get their act together, rip
em off to the maximum, Because that's what they are doing to us.  I saw
some statistics somewhere that we all make over 9 billion calls a year.
The cost of each call is 20c,  That's a total of 12 Billion Dollars they make.
It does get worse, since some of the calls are ISD and STD, which again boosts
their income to somewhere around 12+ billion.    Apart from that there is the
profit they make on selling phones, PABX's, Phone Rental, Exchange Fees, etc
etc etc etc.    It really makes you wonder where the hell all that cash
is going???   (The official figure from telescum is 9 billion phone calls,
and only about 438 million profit.)

If you ever wanted to see a real example of classic blundering I have a recent
example of my encounter with Telscum while trying to find out a simple bit
of information on AUSTPAC.  (REFER TO FEATURE SECTION)

Ok, nuff of that.  Lets get on with it..

OUTDIAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It  is now totally impossible to come up with outdials and since alternate
methods have been found, no one bothers anymore.  I have a list of 3 for
you, including one I just found few hours ago.  The other two may be dead,
since I have not tested them for a while.  Anyway, for all you people that
don't like other methods  (phreaking), here are some outdials.

302083500040    -  No, this is not a typical DATAPAC Outdial.  It is a
                   GANDALF SYSTEM, and it looks very nice.

3106005566      -  Rumours have it that this one is now dead. Since I don't
                   have any others I can releace, here it is anyway.

3106002046      -  Mitel canata,  used long time ago, now password protected.

SYSTEM PASSWORDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have promised you something different in the last issue and that's what you
will get.   A bit of bad news to the prime haters since I am now fully
stocked up with semi-useless primes, thus you can look forward to many more in
the future hehehe.  In this issue, I have a prime in GERMANY, SINGAPORE as
well as a rather refreshing VAX in ISRAEL.

TRIX OF THE TRADE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a very usefull list of file types and devices which are
standard on most VAX systems.   The file types are a reference for each
file, so that you can easilly figure out what to do with each file and how
to use it.  The device list, will show you how large the system is, and what
devices you have to work with which include modems etc.

UNUSUAL SYSTEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was just about to terminate the life of this section, but in the last
minute I came up with something rather different. It is the only system
I have came across that gives hackers some recognition.  Try to connect
and see what I mean.

026245890090218    It will come up  "Enter Remote Password: ", or something
                   along these lines. This time what we don't want, is a valid
                   password.  Have a look at it, and I am sure you will be
                   surprised..

INSIDE INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a new section which will appear in the GLOBE TROTTER from this issue.
It is like the title suggests, The Inside Information for hacking into systems
and in general that will mean the user list like a root directory for a unix.
If you have tried some of the accounts I have given you in the first 3 issues,
you will know they are usually totally useless, but you can't really expect
anything better, since if I were to post them here, they would be dead within
days.  It is very hard to hack a system blind, but this will make it a lot
easier, and I hope it will get the accounts into capable hands only.

To start of with, I have a dialcom system 84 BT GOLD.  You will have to find
the NUA yourselves which will again elliminate some of the looser readers.

LOOSERS
~~~~~~~

NOTE:  The following statistics are the opinions of the majority of hackers in
       melbourne, and not neccasarilly my own personal views, so if you have
       been offended, please remember, it's not my faut!!

When we started out, this list was to include the top 10 hackers, but I don't
think that's such a good idea.  As long as HACKWATCH have nappies listed as
the most ELITE and most NOTORIOUS of hackers in their records, I don't think
the jerks should be corrected.

THE LOOSERS
~~~~~~~~~~~

TAXI CAB   -  This is the first name that pops to mind.  I have never met the
              guy or talked to him, but do get the point when looking at the
              log list of some multiple line chat BBS's and his name is listed
              5 times.  I was not impressed with 4 calls to chat while
              d/loading some files.  So he wins.

OLLIE      -  Not many people like Ollie, and he managed to squeeze at number
              two. I have talked to him, and I think he's ok.  He may not be
              a great hacker but unlike most people has got potential so how
              about giving him a chance?

THE INTERCEPTOR  -  Yes, number three.  The notorious leader of LOM, otherwise
                    refered to as the Loosers Of Melbourne.  He's better then
                    a lot of people calling themselves hackers, but still one
                    of the people they love to hate.


BLUE THUNDER     -  Now Here is a man that really put the word HACKER into
                    the gutter. He would have to be THE MOST FAMOUS PERSONALITY
                    in the hacking world.  Pitty a lot of hackers would shoot
                    him on sight.


There is no clear contestant for the number five on the list, but some
candidates were  SYSOP OF TELEGRAPH ROAD, THE WARRIOR, MASTER BLITZ and
THE BLOWFLY. It was too hard to derive at a conclusin, so the list stands
as above with TAXICAB as the winner.


Now for the BEST and WORST BBS In Melbourne.  Virtually All BBS have been
Judged, over the last two months, and only a very small percentage cater
for hackers, so don't asume they have anything to do with hacking.

TELEGRAPH ROAD - Wins the Looser BBS award by a mile.   There are two others
                 Which are reasonably new that are rather shocking, but It
                 Wasn't fair to judge them at their early stage of operation.
                 SYSOP used to go under the name KIT, but I think it has been
                 changed.  It doesn't really matter, since no one cares anyway.


MEGAWORKS      - This would have to be one of the finest systems.
                 Congratulations Meggie and NYB for the nice job, Although
                 it would be nice if the sysop was there more often to chat!


Few other boards that deserve a mention are PACIFIC ISLAND, ELECTRONIC
CROSSOVER and TARDIS.
The boards have been judged on people's opinions, Number of New Messages,
ease of use, Sysop, Responce Speeds, Number of Files Online, and Personality
of the system in general.

THE REALM, Other private hacking and Non Hacking boards have not been judged,
along with any recently formed systems.

Lastly, few not so elite hackers which I think have got a lot of potential are
THE MENTAT, THINGO IT and THE SHADOW.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THUNDER DOWN UNDER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, the boy has done it again. His court case has been moved to sometime in
August, so that's the third time our friend Thunder has slipped the hangman's
noose.  I know half of you were very upset, when the news got out that Thunder
was still free, but latest developments may change your mind.
You should all know the story if you read the papers, but if not, here are few
details.

   THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,   Alias:  BLUE THUNDER,  or DEAR JOHN, has been
   charged with the following.

   8 counts of obtaining property by deception
   4 counts of attempting to obtain property by deception
   2 counts of conspiracy to defraud property.
     attempting to defraud
     sending offencive phone calls 'to police'
     theft
     and finally resisting arest.

I just made some rough notes which I can't read at the moment, but I think
it's something simmilar, to give you the general idea.

This is all bad enough, and under our law that's just enough for about 3 months
but there is more.   I have got my hands on some inside information, and if it
is correct, it will add a new list to the present charges, which will swamp
the credit card fraud and others, which he faces now.

Here is the bad news.   The new charges will probably include phreaking and
hacking and as such it will become the first case of it's type in australia,
and we all know what that means.  Yes, telecom will most likelly go all out
to win this test case, and if he looses, others will go in his footsteps.
In other words, we will benefit if he wins, although I know some people that
are gladly prepared to pay the price, just to see him put away.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW HACKING LAWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, they have finally done it!  Using Mr BIT MAPPER and BLUE THUNDER as the
excuse, new laws have been brought in, and are effective as of 15/05/88 I
believe.  The fines are now $2000 or 3 months in jail for illegal entry to
a computer system, or $100000 or 10 years jail for falsifying data, causing
damage or using information for own financial advantage.  I am not sure
how far telecom are going to exploit the laws, but it will pay to be more
carefull in the future.  As of today, I will probably dissapear from the
world and close the realm, since if I add this to the things which have
been going on recently, it is not worth it.

THIS IS AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT TO DATA INVESTIGATIONS, FEDERAL POLICE and
THE JERKS AT HACKWATCH.  I HAVE NOW RETIRED AS FROM TODAY, SO GET OF MY CASE!

I might include some update information about the recent hacker hunt initiated
by telescum folk.   The list which was rumoured, that they compiled does
exist.  Anyone who used the BEAVER NUI, along with few others in their
dying stages, is most probably on it.  They have not traced a majority
of the people, but have obtained their PSEUDONYMS (probbaly from watching them
on altos, caling BBS's etc) and are now checking up on it, trying to locate
the people which go under that name.  We know of at least one person that has
been located, shown the list and asked to identify people listed. If DI come
knocking on your door, make sure you keep your mouth shut.  Their favourite
trick is to say they will let you off the hook if you dob in some of the
other people.  Unfortunatelly as a person we all know found out, this is
not always the case and the people you dob in tend to turn up as witnesses
for your prosecution!!  So don't be intimidated and don't say a word before
you get good legal advice, and try to have a solicitor present!  Often they
have no usable evidence, although they make it sound good, so by trying to
save your neck, you can dig yourself very deep indeed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TELESCUM
~~~~~~~~

This is only a mild example of what happens every day if you try to get
somewhere with the telescum system.

Imagine you want to find a little bit of information about one PAD profile
which Austpac uses.   Here is what I did.

I took the white pages,  NO LISTING for AUSTPAC under Austpac.
After a bit of searching I found the number at the front of the book under
Data Communications.

Me:        RING Phone Book NUMBER  605 5099  (Cost 20c)
Telscum:   Hello, Can I help you
Me:        I am trying to get some tech info on austpac.
Telscum:   I can't help you, but try  605 6500
Me:        RING 605 6500     (cost 40c)
Teledick:  Hello, Can I help you   (Should be   Hello, I can't help you)
Me:        I am trying to get some tech info on austpac.
Telsdick:  What is your problem I might be able to help.
Me:        I need some info on a PAD PROFILE profile.
Teledick:  Sorry, That is out of my legue, ring the austpac people.
           (That's what I have been trying to do from the start, so now
            were getting somewhere I thought)   RING  663 4344  (he says)
Me:        RING  663 4344    (cost 60c)
Telewank:  Hello Austpac
Me:        I am trying to get some tech info on austpac.
Telewank:  Hold on a second, I'll put you through to someone.
           (I think meant to say hold on a Hour)
Eon Fm:    Music, music commercials, music.....
Eon Fm:    Music, music commercials, music.....
Telewank:  Sorry,  the person who can help you is to lunch, call back
           in an hour.
Me:        One hour later:     RING  663 4344  (Cost 80c)
Telewank:  Hello Austpac
Me:        I am trying to get some tech info on austpac.
Telewank:  Just a moment, I'll put you through.
Eon Fm:    Music, music, commercials, music.
TeleJerk:  Hello, Can I help you?
Me:        I am trying to get some information on a Pad Profile.
TeleJerk:  Just a moment, I have to change phones.
Phone:     Silence.........Silence
Telewank:  Austpac Can I help you...  (Now we're back to the switch board,
           where we started about two hours ago.)
Me:        Did i speak to you before?? Seems like I spoke to every telescum
           employee.   Anyway, I am trying to get a little bit of information
           on a pad profile (u phucking wanker) is that too much to ask??
Telewank:  Just a moment I'll try to find someone.
Eon Fm:    Music,  (phucking) Music.
           (As you can see, the language is getting worse, this is getting too
            much to handle)
Telenerd:  Can I help you?
Me:        I am trying to get some info on a pad profile?
Telenerd:  Yes?
Me:        (Finally I get the chance to explain my problem, this looks good)
Telenerd:  OK, let me check on that.
Phone:     Silence.......Silence........Silence........Silence....
Telenerd:  Hello, you there.. Well, I am not sure if this is the information
           you are after, but the only reference I have which could be
           relevant to your problem is profile #3, Set to either 0, 2, or 6
           I am afraid I can't help you any more than that, but if you
           have any further problems,  give me a ring.
Me:        Thank you,  If I have any further difficulties, I will mail an
           unaddressed letter, it will be faster.  Bye


Ok, what should have taken one phone call, worth 20c, and about 15 minutes
maximum, took several hours, with no positive result, AND IT HAS GENERATED
80c  WORTH OF INCOME TO TELESCUM.    I Think suicide is the only option.
What do you think????

TELESCUM IN LOVE WITH THEMSELVES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am refering of course to their annual report.  Only a four page leaflet,
covered by photographs, intended to subconsciously hypnotize the customer.
Here are few extracts:

NOTE:  First line...

 Quote:    This year, TELESCUM is proud to announce a profit of 443 million.
           It'a less then we made last year, but still a very credible 10.6%
           return on our assets, and an impressive reflection of the dedication
           of our staff and THE EFFICIENCY of TELESCUM AS AN ORGANISATION.

           (You can't help feeling sorry for the poor bastard forced at a gun
            point to write all that crap.  It gets better)


 Quote:    We are achieving our objective of keeping prices as low as
           practicable BECAUSE TELESCUM is a HIGHLY EFFICIENT ORGANISATION.

           (Here is the keyword again..  EFFICIENT!)

 Quote:    With an exclusive responcibility (MONOPOLY) for australia's
           telecommunications network, we firmly believe there is no excuse
           for INEFFICIENCY.

 Quote:    In 1975 there was an average six to eight week delay in the
           connection of new services. Today, the delay is normally less then
           ten days.

           (on the last subject.....here are the real facts:

              - Took them 6 mnths to install my line.
              - Switch to ISD, 12 MNTHS waiting period.
              - I have been told to virtually forget about EASY CALL
                and tone dialing, since I will not be alive by the time
                they install it.
              - To Change Phone number, they said 3 weeks. It has now been
                two months and I am still waiting to get my number changed!

The last one was a classic..... Force:  I'd like to change my number I am
                                        getting abusive phone calls.

                             Telescum:  To change it will be $32.00 and about
                                        2-3 weeks. (Great, huh? If you have
                                        a heavy breather on your line, might
                                        as well make friends.)

All you can do is wonder how they can even contemplate writing the above. I
guess it might have looked something like this before the censors got to it.

- 433 million profit from a gross income of some 12 Billion. We are a sort of
  an efficient organization, relative to the MARCOS Family.  Perhaps.

- We have achieved our objectives, thus the strategy of not settin any has
  payed off.  We have thus achieved 99% efficiency.

- We have a monopolly on communications so we can do what ever we want. If you
  don't like it, take your business elswhere. If we say we're efficient, it
  is law, and not even god can touch us.

The next section lists some of the major systems interfaced to data networks.
we are not including things like a PC's running a XENIX etc, and some brand
new models are not included, so if you know of any let me know so that I
can update the list.

JANET
~~~~~

Janet is the European academic network. It is fundementally simmilar to
Vicnet, but far larger.  It links the major universities and academic
institutions in europe, with gateways to countries outside europe.
These systems are perfect for things like finding privatelly operated
satellite uplinks.

This is the second part of a series on JANET, and the majority of info
has been taken from the JANET's information Dbase.

First of all lets start of with the most usefull item, the network addresses
for various systems accessible from Janet.

 Introduction
 ------------

 This is an address list of all  the  JANET  mnemonics  that  can  be
 accessed via the JANET Packet SwitchStream Gateway.

 The list is sorted in numerical order using the machine address.

 The list is divided into 3 columns which show:

 a. The numeric address (DTE address)
 b. A mnemonic for the address
 c. A description of where the machine is located.

JANET TUTORIAL PART #2
 ________________________________________________
 7.2  Account Facility and Changing Your Password

 An account can be inspected and the password changed by using this facility.
 First make a call to the Gateway  as  described  in  section  5.   When  the
 Logging in /User prompt appears type ACNT.

 After a short delay, there will be a prompt for a Userid.   Enter  your  PSS
 userid, you  will  then  be prompted for your password.  Enter your password
 (this is not echoed), three  attempts  are  allowed  to  enter  the  correct
 password.  The message 'Enter command' will now appear.


 Example

      OS4000+Rlix V30 PSS Gateway
      Logging in
      user ACNT
      ID last used Wednesday, 10 December 1986 09:14
      Enter userid FRED
      Password

      Enter command

 The following commands are available:

     ACCOUNT   Prints the state of your account on the terminal

      PASSWORD  Allows the password to be changed. The new password
                should be typed in twice on the following two
                lines when prompted. It is not echoed
      END       Terminates the session.

 Note that each command may be abbreviated to a minimum of 2 characters.

 _____________________________________________
 8.   Facilities Available Through the Gateway

 ___________________________
 8.1  Demonstration Facility

 There is an account available which has a  small  allocation  available  for
 users to try out the Gateway.  The password will be supplied on request from
 the Network  Executive.   Note  that excessive use of this account will soon
 exhaust its allocation and deprive others of its use.

 ___________________________________________________
 8.2  Address Mnemonics of Remote Hosts on Networks
      ________________________
      Connected to the Gateway

 Many network addresses consist  of  12  or  even  14  digits  which  may  be
 difficult to remember and awkward to enter.  To make life easier the Gateway
 has a  table  which  consists  of a number of mnemonics and their respective
 network addresses.  When these mnemonics are typed within a call through the
 Gateway the mnemonic is translated into the appropriate network address.

 Therefore if you have a frequently used network address which is not in  the
 table, please  contact  the  Network  Executive with a request to insert the
 address along  with  an  appropriate  mnemonic.   Equally  if  you  know  of
 mnemonics which are no longer useable contact the Network Executive.

 It is hoped that the Gateway will support the  Network  Registration  Scheme
 (NRS) in the near future.

 JANET User Notes 5 and 6 include mnemonics for a number of  remote  machines
 and networks on both PSS and JANET.

 _______________________________
 9.  Facilities Available on PSS

 ________________
 9.1  Fast Select

 This allows calls to have up to 128 bytes in the Call User Data field.   You
 can use this to expand address information available for the next hop of the
 call.  As  a  PSS  user  we  have  subscribed to this facility;  however you
 should note that some remote Hosts on PSS and IPSS cannot accept Fast Select
 calls.  If a Fast Select call is made to an address which does not subscribe
 to the Fast Select facility the call will fail with clearing  code  Hex'29'.

 When a mnemonic is used, the Gateway  will  know  whether  the  address  can
 support Fast Select or not, and will make the correct call automatically.
 If the full numeric address is used, then the Gateway has to be told not  to
 use Fast  Select.  This can be done by preceding the address with the string
 'NFS-'.  In fact the NFS is a mnemonic which translates  to  a  null  string
 with the  No  Fast  Select attribute and the minus is just a delimiter which
 will be ignored.

 For example, calling TELENET

       PSS(FRED,XYZ).NFS-311012345678

 ____________________________
 9.2  Reverse Charge Facility

 If this facility is used the remote Host will accept all the  call  charges,
 therefore your  allocation  on  the Janet Gateway will not be debited.  Note
 that there are not many remote Hosts which will accept  'reverse  charging'.

 Unfortunately the only way to find out if a remote Host will accept  reverse
 charging is  to  experiment.   Do this by appending 'R' to the authorisation
 field, for example

 (FRED,XYZ,R)

 If this does not work, it could be because the remote host will only  accept
 calls from 'known' network addresses and the JANET addresses are 'unknown'

 ___________________
 9.3  Access to IPSS

 It is possible to access  IPSS,  the  International  Packet  Switch  Stream,
 through PSS.   This is done by entering the IPSS address in place of the PSS
 address.  IPSS calls are accounted separately from PSS so you will  have  to
 make a  specific  request  for  an  IPSS allocation before you make calls on
 IPSS.

 ___________________________________________________
 9.4  Calls to Other, Non-Transport Service Networks

 Some networks (for example, TYMNET) require a Call User Data  Field  with  a
 different format from the one normally generated by the Gateway.  A facility
 has been  provided  to enable an arbitrary string to be included in the Call
 User Data Field.  This is  done  by  terminating  the  numeric  address  (or
 mnemonic)   with  the  delimiter  '*D'  followed  by  the  required  string.
 Everything following the '*D' is then copied into the Call User Data  Field.


 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).NFS-31060000*DZRRT;IPSSLON

 This would call a (fictitious) address on TYMMNET.

 Finally some machines do not expect to receive any user data at all, so  you
 will need to enter '*D' on its own for these.

 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).YONDER*D

 ___________________________
 9.5  Adjusting Packet Sizes

 The Gateway normally tries to establish its calls with a packet size of  256
 bytes, even  if  the incoming call had only 128 byte packets.  This normally
 does not cause problems, but there may be difficulties  with  some  systems.
 If you  find  your  call  being  cleared  even  though all the addressing is
 correct, or if it fails as soon as data starts to flow, try calling with the
 additional data, '*P7W2', to force a packet size of 128 bytes.

 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).OVERTHERE*P7W2

 If you also need to use the *D parameter that must follow the *P/W paramter.

 _______
 Example

      PSS(FRED,XYZ).HERE*P7W2*DTOYOU

 ___________________________________________________
 10.  Protocols Available if Supported by Both Local
      ________________________
      and Remote Host Machines

 Other sorts of calls, besides terminal calls, may be  possible  through  the
 Gateway.  In  these  cases  Transport  Service  is required.  The mechanisms
 required for insertion of authorisation information vary  from  computer  to
 computer, and  therefore  your  local  support staff should be consulted for
 information in this area.

 Care needs to be exercised here, especially when replying to MAIL  from  PSS
 without considering  how  the  authorisation  will be managed.  Problems can
 also occur with FTP, which will continue to retry a call until it receives a
 fatal error, causing unnecessary network traffic.

 _____________________________________________________
 10.1 Network Independent File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

 This allows files from one computer's file store to  be  sent  to  the  file
 store of  another  computer.   Although  the  two  computers  may  have very
 different ways of working internally, FTP will overcome  these  difficulties
 and arrange for the transfer of the file without the user being aware of the
 special procedures that are being carried out.

 ______________________
 10.2 JNT MAIL Protocol

 This allows MAIL messages to be sent from one user  to  another  user.   The
 users may  be  using  the same machine or may be using machines on different
 networks.  In both cases the user types his message into the  machine  being
 used and  the MAIL program then adds a header to the message, so that it can
 be transmitted to the remote Host by FTP.  The received message is stored on
 the remote Host and made available to the addressee.

 __________________________________________________
 10.3 Job Transfer and Manipulation Protocol (JTMP)

 This protocol lets you:

      transfer files for storage or execution
      make status enquiries and get reports on these files.
      modify the progress of the above.

 This protocol requires standard FTP to carry out the transfers.

 ____________________________
 11.  Restrictions and Errors

 _________________
 11.1 Restrictions

 Due to the present lack of a full Transport  Service  in  the  gateway,  the
 ADDRESS, DISCONNECT  and  RESET primitives are not fully supported.  However
 this should not present  serious  problems,  since  the  ADDRESS  and  RESET
 primitives are  not widely used, and the DISCONNECT primitive can be carried
 in a Clear Request packet.

 The gateway does however support continuation of Transport  Service  Connect
 messages into  the  first  data  packet.   This  is particularly useful when
 attempting file transfers for which the  12-byte  CUDF  limitation  pertains
 (i.e.  NSF- calls).

 ___________
 11.2 Errors

 When a call fails, there is an error code associated with the failure  which
 will normally be displayed on your PAD.  A list of the most common codes and
 their meanings is given in Network User Note 15.

NETWORK PROFILE             DATAPAC PART #2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have found sevarel new areas on Datapac, and since I think this will be a
two file edition, there will be DATAPAC PART #3 in volume #5. To give you
a bit of change, in the next time, I might include few scans of networks
in asia as well as datapac.

That's it for another month.  I hope you have found something interesting in
the above, and if so, how about doing something in return, like writing an
article, tutorial ANYTHING.

The next issue is rather hazy, and I am not sure whether there will be one or
not, but if we decide to make volume five, it will include the following.

  - The Final Scans on DATAPAC, with several brand new areas.

  - A tutorial on how to create accounts on Primos versions 19 and above.

  - Inside Info on other dialcom systems.

  - A feature on TROJANS, NUI Snatchers etc.

  - Possibly a brand new regular feature will appear on Phreaking.
