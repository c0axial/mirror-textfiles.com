FROM THE EDITOR:

This has been a very, very big month.   A number of large hacks have been
made including GENERAL ALEXEI LEONOV's Mail Box. (Yep, Russian Generals
are just as stupid as ordinary people, when it comes to passwords).
United Nations Network, as well as few I don't want to mention.
Such A BIG month deserves a BIG issue of Globe Trotter, so here it is.
For the first time, a four file Issue, with a look inside The Realm.

Thunder has worked his magic yet again, so read about it.  Looks like I should
set up a regular feature, just for our dear friend. Ahhh you love it John don't
you?   All this lovelly publicity for you, and yes, I am going to mention

It's all looking up.  Now we have added another method, to the phreaking way
off life, and the future is looking brighter all the time, with possible
introduction of new services such as SPRINT to Australia.  Boxing is also
becoming a reality, and early boxing tests with 2400 & 2600 tones are
yielding some good results. Ok, now to continue where I left off last time.

FREQUENCY, BANDWIDTH AND TRANSMISSION SPEED

Each transmission medium (carrier) operates on a different portion of the
electromagnetic frequency spectrum, although various media often occupy
overlapping frequency ranges. Open-wire pairs, for instance, use the portion
of the spectrum between 400 and 6000 Hx, only a slice of approximately 5600 Hz.
Microwave radio, by contrast, uses the portion of the spectrum upward between
approximately 2000 and 12000 MHZ, or a giant slice of 10000 MHZ.

When the telephone system was being developed, it was determined that the
frequency range of between 300 and 3400 Hz or a slice of approximately 3000 Hz
was sufficient to transmit the human voice intelligibly.  A voicegrade line is
a circuit that offers 3000 Hz nominal frequency capacity. A 3000 Hz slice can
be taken out of anywhere on the frequency spectrum modulated, and used for
transmission as though it were taken out of te 300 to 3400 Hz portion of the
spectrum. Therefore 3000 Hz, normally considered the bandwidth of a voicegrade
channel, indicates the size of the channel, rather than its location on the
frequency spectrum.


MULTIPLEXING

Given a specific channel, the goal is to utilize it to the fullest in order to
reduce transmission costs. In many cases, this can be accomplished by
multiplexing. As described below, there are two types of multiplexing commonly
used.

Time-Division multiplexing can be thought of as a process in which a number of
parallel signals are represented sequentially and transmitted on a single
high-speed circuit. In small segment of time. each of the number of input
signals is sampled in sequence and that sampling sequence is repeated until
the transmission is completed. The speed of the sampling cycle is important
because it affects the accuracy of the process. (With analog signal, the
sampling must be at least twice as fast as the highest frequency to achieve a
satisfactory accuracy.)

In frequency-division multiplexing, a number of signals each occupies a
different portion on wider bandwidth circui, that is, each is given a descrete,
narrow frequency range. This is possible since most circuits have much wider
bandwidths than those required by the voice signal. The circuit is used more
efficiently, therefore, by spreading a number of signals over the available
bandwidth and transmitting them simultaneously. At the receiving point, the
signals are reducedto their original frequencies and distributed on individual
circuits.

A "concentrator" is a term used almost synonymously with "multiplexor," but the
functions of the concentrator may also include code and speed translation
functions. When a concentrator is used, operation of various types of remote
terminals is "transparent" to the computer in the network.

Next month will have the last part of this boaring jargon.  SWITCHED FACILITIES
and LINE FACILITIES, then we can tackle the juicy bits.

Since primes are the flavour of the month, this month and every other month,
why not go along with more of them.   Ok, I must level with you.  The reason
you are being swamped with primes, is because they, apart from UNIX Systems,
have commonly got useless accounts, that don't really lead anywhere.  If you
think I am going to make a regular habbit of leaving decent accounts in this
section, then you are indeed dreaming. After all, it would only benefit the
first few readers of this issue.  This way, the accounts keep on living, ie
the ones left in volume #1 are still alive, and only if you're good enough
will you be able to take it a step further.

26245221040595   PRIMENET 21.0.3  TWF_K    Username: PRIME  Password: PRIME

26245890090831   PRIMENET 19.3.4-Z  GRAF   Username: TEST     No password
                                           Username: SYSTEM   No password

311061700255     primenet 20.2.6v.R8.A  PBN43    Username: TEST   No password


I guess out of the above, the second with the username SYSTEM is the most fun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRIX OF THE TRADE
``````````````````

Earlier on,  I have told you about the use of the C_ID file, to keep away,
unwanted people, while you're using a Prime Account.  Naturally, the people
must be very ignorant of primos in general, since there are ways around
it.   This is the same thing, only a cpl version.  It will do several things.
Each time some logs on, it will create a T$xxxx file, thus you can check
how many people have attempted login and at what times, since the files are
dated and stamped with the time. If your using TELENET, it is still reasonably
easy to abort the sequence, but using a network such as MIDAS or AUSTPAC,
has some nasty effects.   THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THESE
TWO NETWORKS AND TELENET.  When we first did it, on a fresh;y engineered
account, we though it was lost forewer and it took about 6 attempts before
we managed to abort the sequence.  arrgghhh nasty.    Second version, is
to keep away people that know about primos and have the capability to abort
into primos and undo your efforts.  Ok here is how it goes.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
TYPE  ****  THE SYSTEM IS DOWN FOR HARDWARE UPGRADE, PLEASE TRY LATER  ****
&DATA LOG
&END
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Name this file T.CPL

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
CPL T
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Name This File C_ID

OK, that's all there is to it. When anyne logs on, they will get a message
saying the system is down, and will be logged off.

Now for the more nasty version

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
TYPE ****  THE SYSTEM IS DOWN FOR HARDWARE UPGRADE, PLEASE TRY LATER  ****
&DATA COMO -N
PASSWD
OLDPASSWORD
NEWPASSWORD
NEWPASSWORD
LOG
&END
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Save the above as T.CPL yet again, and have the same C_ID file.

Now some explanations.   COMO -N, will turn off the output to the user logging
on, therefore he can't see what is going on. If you have a high level account,
you will need to remove the OLDPASSWORD command.  It basically changes the
password from the old one to a new one you select, if by any chance the person
tries to log on, he will not be able to get back in later, after he realises
the C_ID logs him off.

The last variation could be used to give you a warning when a person logs on,
by activating a CHAT to you.  There are lot more applications for modified
versions of this program, ie.  with a system managers account ie 001 on
DIALCOM's, you can install it to prompt the user for a new password every
20 or so logins.  Save the password in his or other directory, change the
password by using the PASSWD -LONG command so that you will be able to attach
to his work directory as a non owner, to read his new passwords. A lot of
accounts all ready have a C_ID file present, and even if they don't, they get
lost in all the files in the directory.  To write something like this, you
need to know a bit about CPL, so i think I'll let you work it out for
yourselves, since it will stop non-primos people tackling something like
that in their early days.

U N U S U A L    S Y S T E M S
```````````````````````````````

I have been playing around with datapac a fair bit, as you may have noticed.
And as well as a tip, I have found some very weird systems.  The tip is that
I have found some NUA's  above 999 range in some areas, so if you feel game,
you can sprint higher the 999 which i have done, since I will not bother
with this network for quite some time.

302082500532  Is the first of the weird ones. This is 3274 Controller Emulator,
              and it looks like it may control some powerful hardware. There
              is option to get into the manager or supervisor mode, so if you
              have some tie, might be fun to play with.

302043600902  This system is  2250 Remote Controlled Serial Test, and again,
              it is unlike anything I have seen before.  It has several
              systems and you can access each oe, ie BERT, AUX etc, by typing
              OPEN BERT or OPEN AUX etc.  Some of the commands I have found
              are tabulated below, but it looks lot more complex, so I am
              sure there are more.

               MAIN SYSTEM:        MONITOR, STATUS, LOOP, INJECT, SELECT
                                   OPEN, CLOSE, LOOK


               BERT:               HELP, HOME ABORT, CH, CM, UPDATE, L


              I haven't played with the other systems, but there are functions
              there to change passwords such as CH for Bert, provided you
              know the old one.  On the whole it looks like some sort of a
              TEST/CONTROL facility for a decent size network.

Other NUA's include 484 and 485 instead of 902, so it suggests it's something
big, with three separate addresses for it.

Well, the trend is certainly continuing.   There are more and more networks.
The entire world, including third world and eastern block countries are
becoming computerised, so our playground is growing by the minute.

This month, some new networks, including RUSSIA, yes  the RUSKIES have
taken the plunge and have a X25 link access from austria.  Now the fun
really starts.

Now for a summary of new networks, or recently discovered ones.

COUNTRY              NETWORK             DNIC

That's it for this issue.  Next one will have the complete file, which is a
great reference.  The one first released is now out of date and has at least
fifty networks missing.

Ahh yes michael what makes him tick.  Well first of all, he really loves
his job.  Busting our asses on Keylink,  HACKING OUR ACCOUNTS ON ALTOS
AND ABUSING OTHER PEOPLE FROM THEM, are just some of his little joys in
life, second only to self masturbation.  Like him or hate him, he is the
source of most of our problems.  Soon after graduating from a computer
course, he joined OTC, and being smarter then the ordinary OTC dickhead,
cleaned up the act for them pretty well.  I must admit it's a pretty good
effort, considering he has been with KEYLINK for around a year or less.
I know most of you hate his guts rather bad, but I can't help liking the
guy.  He provides a mental challenge, and he's quite fun to play with.
I am still trying to convert him into a hacker every time I get a chance,
so he might even be a great asset, although it doesn't look likely.

Few pieces of information. Anyone using KEYLINK, would know, that michael
can link other accounts you have hacked, to the one he caught you on. As
a result you loose all your accounts.   Now the only way I can think off,
this can be done, is if there is a log kept from which port, either from
austpac or midas you logged on to. If there is a record, of other accounts
being connected to, by the same person on the same connection, he can link
it together.   When I raised this idea with him, he denied it, but there is
nothing else it can be. At least no easy way, and I doubt they would install
complicated algorythms to work something like this out.

To survive on KEYLINK: - NEVER HACK a SUPPLY OF ACCOUNTS, always have one,
                         or a maximum of two and hack a fresh one when it dies.

                       - Never Use the ON ABCXXX PASSWORD Command if you can
                         help it.

                       - DISCONNECT THE LINE and redial, before logging on to
                         another account.

                       - Don't connect to Altos, not directly anyway. Remember
                         it's keylink which kills 99% of all accounts.

                       - Choose your times of use carefully, and learn the
                         operators habbits. Try not repeat certain patters,
                         which would identify you, and remember be prepared
                         to loose any account you log on to using netlink.

Now if you plan on using KEYLINK, how about giving OTC a call first and see
if Michael Rosenberg is in.  If not, there is the chance he has logged on
from remote, but it will help.  Now if you want to talk to the man, try:

               02-287-5000 or 02-287-4437

Hope it helps  Have fun.   Next month, I guess few words about Stuart Gill,
one of the greatest CONN artists of our time.  He made his fortune,
terorrising the Computer Industry by scaring them shitless.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE YEAR THAT WAS
=================

We are preparing a special issue for Globe Trotter, to be released in about
three months time.  It will be a cronicle of this years hacking.  A look at
the year in summary.  We need your help with the research.   If you have
hacked any systems this year and you can tell us about it, I would like to
hear from you, and possibly just get the details or a sample login. Even a
simple count of VAX's UNIX's etc hacked would help.  It should be an impressive
list, since a decent hacker can easilly hack several hundered accounts in a
a year.  Anyway, if you have any info for me, let me know, and state whether
you want credit for the hacks, if mailing a file.

The court case which took place last month, certainly did not live up to
expectations, although the feds had a great day playing SPOT THE HACKER,
among the crowds. Over the past few issues there has been a great build
up towards this event, which a lot of you saw as a great anti climax.
YES, THUNDER HAS WORKED HIS MAGIC, and is a free man, although with a
police record or two.  He pleaded guilty to stealing a rubber stamp, and not
guilty to other charges. Resisting arest, defrauding $13000 or so dollars
and he gets away with 200 hours of community work.  You may be pleased to
know that his first few hours were spent varnishing a chair.
Here is the punch line.  Thunder is starting up THUNDER CORE, a computer
security Consultancy.  He has been seen on TV, trying to plug the company. I
guess you have to ask yourself a question.   WOULD YOU TRUST HIM WITH YOUR
SYSTEM SECURITY?

The concept of Hacker terning Security Consultant is not new, in fact seems
like every second person I know has some plans to start up such a business
in the future. Ahh well, that's life.

So, what impact has thunder made?  Well:

 -  We all think the same of Dear John.
 -  Feds got severelly pissed off and will try harder next time.
 -  CC Fraud has taken off like a rocket. There are now more CARDERS then
    HACKERS and PHREAKS.   Although Note!!!!!!! Most Carders are NOT
    I stress NOT HACKERS, although that won't stop the media linking the
    two together.
 -  It proves what an ASS the Law is.

Anyway, that's about all.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK JOHN, At least I have
something to write about.

Ok, first of all for this months Network, MIDAS 5053, followed by the some
more DATAPAC 3020 Areas.

NETWORK PROFILE:     M I D A S   -   O T C   D A T A   A C C E S S
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

NOTE: MIDAS is now refered to as OTC DATA ACCESS.  No idea why they changed
      the name.

Dnic:             5053
Location:         AUSTRALIA
Owners:           OTC - Overseas Telecommunications Company (Government)
Host Responce:    Excelent
Network Rating:   Good
Nua Structure:    5053     2            00000               00
                 <DNIC>  <AREA>      <HOST NUMBER>  <OPTIONAL SUB-ADDRESS>

NOTES:  MIDAS has got very good security.  NUI's have a certain Limit, which
        when exhausted, terminates the NUI.  It's a very good network, a lot
        faster going directly, rather then via AUSTPAC.

        NUI's are six digit alpha-numeric strings.

Well, I hope you have enjoyed, this issue of Globe Trotter, however it
doesn't end here just yet.  There is a Special Issue Volume 6.3 and 6.4.
These two files deal with The Realm, and are not a part of this issue.
The files are available on request to approved people, so if you have a copy,
please do not distribute them, without our permission.

The numbers of dedicated hackers are still falling, however the quality of
hacking is improving all the time.   Could be that the two factors are related.
Interesting concept.   Anyway, in volume #7, hmmmmm it will inclume:

    - GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS INC & DIALNET Information

    - Revised List of DNICS

    - A Profile on DATEX-P, with possibly some more of DATAPAC thrown in hehe.

    - Hopefully some more interesting bits, which I have yet to think off.
      This is becoming a mental strain, and without some decent contributions,
      Globe Trotter will not survive past Volume #10. HINT!

A lot of people have asked for a guided tour of The Realm, So this is about
the best I can do.  The Following is very close to the real thing, although
it has been edited to remove variouse sensitive sections.  I hope you will
enjoy your tour, and remember we are always looking for good people to join
our society.

!       system. It can be programmed by the users, so that inbetween callers,
!       it can hack systems, scan Nua's etc. It hacks on it's own for few

! Well, I guess that about covers the major parts. The last thing remaining is
! the Archives Section.   It is hard to keep all the files online, thus two
! archives exist.  One is offline, locked away, so that a back up copy always
! exists, and the other is on a Unix System, which one of the members owns.
! the unix is generally off line, but a specific file can be uploaded, or
! on request it can be put temporarily online.

! etc.... Again the file is far too large to be put in this section.

===============================================================================

There are a lot of sections which don't need any explanation, and some which
have been edited out, but that's more or less it.

Now for some more information about the membership criteria:

- First off all, any applicant must be a competant phone freek, and have
  means of making free phone calls internationally etc. If in australia or USA,
  it is not as important since we can supply all information and resources
  needed to get you communicating at economy rates.

- References!  Yes, it helps to have them.  If you know a realm member and
  they can put in a good word for you, it goes a long way.

- A person must have a definate ability, and good knowledge in some field.
  We love people that know something we don't, since we can learn from them,
  and they can learn from us.

- One has to be dedicated to the art, and willing to learn and expand the
  knowledge.  Contribute and not parasite of the others.

- Trust and Ethics, are the two most important.  We share just about everything
  we get, knowing it will not get abused or destroyed. This is what makes
  everything work.  There is no trading of information, but a free flow.

Again, if you would like to become a part of our group, contact me or other
members, via Altos username 'force' or on some good BBS's.
