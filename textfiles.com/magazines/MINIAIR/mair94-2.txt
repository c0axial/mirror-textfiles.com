1994-02-02      Pieces of Schneerson

Pieces of Schneerson: Culturing the Immortal Cell Line RMS94

by Sam Greenberg, New York City. Translated from the original
Hebrew by Karen Hopkin, Yeshiva University.

This month, members of the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitch Hasidic group
mourned the death of their Grand Rabbi Menachem Schneerson.  Many
of the Rebbe's followers apparently believed Schneerson to be
immortal--the Messiah predicted in the Old Testament.  To
determine whether Schneerson could be considered immortal, we
obtained cell samples from the Rebbe's frontal cortex, left
forearm, and lower intestine during his 3-month hospitalization at
Beth Israel in New York.  These cells were tested for their
ability to grow indefinitely in culture.

We found that neurons from Schneerson's brain [1] exhibited growth
patterns typical of immortalized cells --growth in the absence of
contact with the culture plate; a decreased requirement for serum
growth factors; and the ability to overcome replicative senescence
(cultures were monitored for more than 250 median population
doublings).  The other cell types did not exhibit immortal growth
[2].

Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis indicates that
Schneerson's neurons (cell line RMS94) contain a mutation in the
tumor suppressor Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene. This point mutation
would lead to the replacement of a glutamic acid residue (E) in
the Rb protein.  Further studies are needed to determine how the
RbE mutation leads to immortality.

NOTES:

[1] Cell line RMS94 will be available through the American Type
Culture Collection, ATCC #4494R for further physiological and
genetic analyses or for divine inspiration.

[2] The significance of the immortality of only the Rebbe's brain
cells is currently under investigation by a team of molecular
biologists and biblical scholars.

1994-02-03      Announcing AIRhead Project 2000

With year 2000 fast[1] approaching, many [2] scientific, medical,
engineering, legal, educational, governmental and marketing
organizations are sponsoring research projects that involve the
number two thousand.  The Annals of Improbable Research is
compiling a list of such studies. Randomly selected items fro the
list include:

        #1.     "Library 2000," MIT

        #2.     "NASA MINDS 2000+," Eastern Michigan U. and NASA

        #3.     "Education 2000," United Kingdom

        #4.     Goals 2000 Initiative," U.S. Dept of Education

        #5.     Information Management 2000," Univ. of St. Gallen

We are also assembling a complete collection of products (and/or
advertisements for products) which are related to the number two
thousand. The collection presently consists of these items:

        #1.     "Biomek 2000 Laboratory Automation Workstation"
                from Beckman.

        #2.     "Lever 2000 soap."  The manufacturer's advertisements
                point out that the soap can be used to cleanse
                a human being's 2000 body parts.

        #3.     "2000 Flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaner."

        #4.     "2000 Flushes Blue automatic toilet bowl cleaner."

        #5.     "2000 Flushes Chlorine Clear automatic toilet bowl
                cleaner."

AIRhead Project 2000 is seeking additions to our list of projects,
and additions to our collection of products and/or ads for
products. Please do not send products that have been previously
used and/or ingested. All materials should be sent to the address
given below.

NOTES:

1. The rate of approach is approx. one year per year.

2. Approx. two thousand.

1994-02-03      Recap (by pop req) of 1991 Ig Nobel Prizewinners

Many readers have requested that we publish a list of previous
years' Ig Nobel Prizewinners.  The first public ceremony was held
in 1991. The winners that year included:

1991 Ig Nobel Chemistry Prize: Jacques Benveniste
prolific proselytizer and dedicated correspondent of "Nature," for his
persistent discovery that water, H2O, is an intelligent liquid and for
demonstrating to his satisfaction that water is able to remember events
long after all trace of those events has vanished.

1991 Ig Nobel Education Prize: J. Danforth Quayle
consumer of time and occupier of space, for demonstrating, better than
anyone else, the need for science education.  (The acceptance speech was
delivered by someone who claimed to be Vice President Quayle but who
appeared to be an eight-year-old girl.)

1991 Ig Nobel Biology Prize: Robert Klark Graham
selector of seeds and prophet of propagation, for his pioneering
development of the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank that
accepts donations from Nobellians and Olympians.

1991 Ig Nobel Literature Prize: Erich Von Daniken
visionary raconteur and author of "Chariots of the Gods," for explaining
how human civilization was influenced by ancient astronauts from outer
space.

1991 Ig Nobel Peace Prize: Edward Teller
father of the hydrogen bomb and first champion of the Star Wars weapons
system, for his lifelong efforts to change the meaning of peace as we
know it.  (The Ig Nobel Committee was unable to find anyone who was
willing to accept the prize on behalf of Edward Teller.)

1991 Ig Nobel Economics Prize: Michael Milken
titan of Wall Street and father of the junk bond, to whom the world is
indebted.

1991 Ig Nobel Pedestrian Technology Prize: Paul Defanti
wizard of structures and crusader for public safety, for his invention
of the Buckybonnet, a geodesic fashion structure that pedestrians wear
to protect their heads and preserve their composure.

1991 Ig Nobel Interdisciplinary Research Prize: Josiah Carberry
bold explorer and eclectic seeker of knowledge, for his pioneering work
in the field of psychoceramics, the study of cracked pots.

1991 Ig Nobel Medicine Prize: Alan Kligerman
deviser of digestive deliverance, vanquisher of vapor, and inventor of
Beano, for his pioneering work with antigas liquids that prevent bloat,
gassiness, discomfort, and embarrassment.

1994-04-04      Specimen of the Month

Taxonomic and analytical text prepared by Emmert Lowery, Jr.
This item is on exhibit at The MIT Museum.

Item #83002D. "No Knife. A study in mixed media earth tones,
number three." Realized by James Tetazoo. December 1984.

This object d'art was found in the midst of an art Exhibit at
MIT's List Galleries in the Weisner Arts and Media Building,
installed by students whose identity remains unknown. It consists
of a gray plastic tray surmounted by two spoons, a plate, a bowl,
a glass, and a fork.

The artist's mode d'emploi relies upon minimalist kinematic
methods; space and time are frozen in a staid reality of
restrained sexuality. Temporary occasionalism, soon overcome
throughout by symbolic nihility, pervades our earliest perception
of the work. An overturned throwaway obelisk functions as symbolic
pedestal; the work rests upon a manifestation of grey toned
absence. Epicurean imagery is employed most effectively by
Tetazoo; the glass, the porcelain, the plastic move in conflicting
directions and yet are joined in a mood of stark pacifism. The
sterile lateralism of the grouped utensils (sans knife), conveys a
sens of eternal ennui, framed within the subtle ambience of
discrete putrefaction. The casual formalism of the place setting
draws upon our common internal instinct of existential persistence
to unify us withe the greater consciousness of human bondage.

1994-02-05      May We Recommend...

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"A Partial Form of Lycanthropy with Hair Delusion in a Manic-
Depressive Patient," by H. Verdoux and M. Bourgeois, "British
Journal of Psychiatry," vol. 163, pp. 685-686.

1994-02-07      AIR extracts now syndicated on USENET

"Extracts from the The Annals of Improbable Research" will now
appear in the form of a syndicated weekly column.  The items there
will be different from those which appear here in mini-AIR.

If your Internet site subscribes to the Clarinet newsgroups,
you can read these extracts in the USENET news group named

        clari.feature.imprb_research

[EDITOR'S NOTE: Through no fault of our own, our column is
appearing at the same time Dave Barry's column is disappearing.
Dave's column was one of the few things on the Internet that we
read faithfully, and we will miss it sorely.  Apparently, an
executive at Knight Ridder, the corporation which owns the rights
to Dave's column, decided that the Internet is a dangerous place.
By the power vested (by ourselves)in us, we hereby proclaim that
executive (whose name we do not know) to be an honorary AIR head.]

1994-02-08      News about AIR

1. We will be announcing details soon about how to subscribe to
the print version of AIR.  We hope to publish the first issue this
fall.  Any generous support we receive from patrons of the
improbable will help hasten that day.  If you or your organization
would like to help, please get in touch.

2. Our office is in the MIT Museum, where AIR and mini-AIR are
published. When you are in town, please drop by to say hello and
discuss your research or lack thereof.

3. Several mysterious people have inquired whether it is possible
to obtain group subscriptions to AIR as gifts for customers,
employees, students, patients, or whatnot. The answer is yes.

4. We are looking for volunteer interns to help with
correspondence and research. If you live in the Cambridge area and
feel so inclined, please get in touch.

5. Marilyn Geller, our Technical Brains, will soon depart from
MIT, leaving us, technically speaking, half-Brained at best.
Many, many thanks to Marilyn for her help, wisdom, patience, and
foregone sleep in launching first mini-JIR, then mini-AIR.
Marilyn has consented to remain loosely affiliated with mini-AIR,
in exchange for the odd (tasting) cup of coffee.

accepting data ONLY for lectures that are of standard academic
drone length (50-60 minutes).  If your data concern several
different lectures, please list the data separately for each
lecture.
Data should be submitted concisely in the following format:
        Name and city of institution
        Name of lecturer
        General subject of the lecture (e.g., physics,history,etc.)
        Number of times the lecturer spoke the word "um."

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS for the 1994 Ig Nobel Prizes. Ig Nobel Prizes
are awarded for achievements that cannot or should not be
reproduced. Nominations may be submitted, anonymously or
otherwise, by e-mail or by standard mail.


******************************************************************
1994-02-10      Purpose of mini-AIR (*)

The mini-Annals of Improbable Research (mini-AIR) publishes news
about improbable research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of
research news and satire from the Annals of Improbable Research
(AIR).

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony. Ig Nobel Prizes
honor "achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced." A
public ceremony is held at MIT, in Cambridge Massachusetts, every
October. The ceremony is sponsored jointly by The MIT Museum and
AIR.

C) News about other science humor activities intentional and
otherwise.

WHAT IS AIR? (An introduction, of sorts)
AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR)," the
world's oldest satirical science journal. The new magazine's co-
founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited JIR from 1990-1994, and
Alexander Kohn, who founded JIR in 1955 and was its editor until
1989. AIR is published at the MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA.
The new magazine's editorial board consists of more than 40
distinguished scientists from around the world, including, among
others, seven Nobel prizewinners and Marilyn Vos Savant (who is
listed in the Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame for
"Highest IQ"). Every October, AIR and the MIT Museum together
produce the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose
achievements cannot or should not be reproduced.

Readers who are curious about why the entire staff felt compelled
to leave the old magazine and start AIR may wish to consult the
June 9 issue of the research journal "Nature."

----------------------------------------
1994-02-11      How to Submit Articles (*)
