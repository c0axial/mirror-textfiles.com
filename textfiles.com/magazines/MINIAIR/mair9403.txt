1994-03-02      News: AIR, Curiousity, Kilt, the, CAT

1. Yes Indeed!
We are very pleased to announce:
You can now become a charter subcriber (whatever that means) to
The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR).  The magazine will appear
on your doorstep 6 times per year.  For details, see section 1994-
03-11 below.  PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!!!!!!

2. Curiousity
We AIRheads continue to receive queries from former readers of The
Journal of Irreproducible Results (JIR) hungry for details of why
the entire staff (1955-1994) of JIR felt it necessary to resign
from that publication and create The Annals of Improbable Research
(AIR).  The matter is explained in news reports in The Scientist
(July 11), Science (June 24) and Nature (June 9).  Details can
also be obtained by emailing a request to air@mit.edu.

3. Kilt
Would the Scottish reader who mailed a kilt to the AIR editorial
office please inform us of your address?  We are otherwise unable
to send you a letter acknowledging that the contribution is tax-
deductible.

3. the
Effective with this issue of mini-AIR, we must discontinue our
popular data feature "The 'The' Count."  "The 'The' Count"
reported how many times during the previous month the the word
"the" appeared in major metropolitan newspapers in 162 cities.  If
and when Internet sites in Asia and Australia agree not to censor
the data, we will resume publishing the column.

4. CAT
The winner of the CAT scanner lottery is Norman F. Lee of Hong
Kong.  Second prize, a wooden tongue depressor, was won by Traian
Mihaescu of Iasi, Romania.

1994-03-04      Additional, Unreported Dangers from Mexican food

by Steve Mirsky
New York City

The recent report from CSIPI [1] on the high fat and salt content
of Mexican food, though long overdue, still neglects to
implicate the myriad other health dangers consumers face when
dining in Mexican restaurants.

The plates upon which Mexican food is traditionally served
can be very, very hot, indeed approaching the "yip yip woo
hatcha" stage.  Contact between said plates and human skin
can result in tissue damage followed by vigorous hand waving
and blowing that in turn can cause hyperventilation.

A little-discussed danger of Mexican dining is the finite
probability of encounters with roving Mariachia bands.  A
condition known as Castanet Culjone, though rare, is
particularly painful and debilitating.  In addition, the
small mobile orchestras are exceptionally annoying, which can
lower the immune response.

Finally, there is the much observed but little discussed
"twice-burned" phenomenon, consistent with the relative
indigestibility of certain key ingredients of Mexican food
that register particularly high on the Scoville Organoleptic
Test (the official scale of hotness)[2].  At least one Navy test
has shown that window cleaning fluid, especially if it
contains ammonia, can be an effective topical neutralizing
solution for SOEYYWH (Sudden Onset Egress Yip Yip Woo
Hatcha)[3].

1994-03-04      International Sweetness Ages

by Susan Andersen, Lennox University, London, U.K., and Bernadette
Highwood, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts

In virtually every culture, people who have generous, kind
dispositions are described as being "sweet."  However, this term
is usually reserved (by other adults) for individuals who have
reached a certain age.  We conducted a cross-national study[1] to
determine how "the minimum age of adult sweetness" varies from
country to country.  Our results our presented below.[2]

1994-04-05      Specimen of the Month

Taxonomic and analytical text prepared by Emmert Lowery, Jr.
This item is on exhibit at The MIT Museum.

ITEM #786-4591-089      Ferdie The Cow

This fiberglass bovine, measuring eight feet in length from tail
to snout and four feet tall at the shoulders, appeared on the
morning of  October 31, 1979 perched atop MIT's 150 feet tall
Great Dome. The previous  night Ferdi had been, "liberated" from
its home in the Hilltop Steak House  in Saugus, Massachusetts, by
an unidentified group of MIT students. Ferdi's visit to the Great
Dome attracted wide media coverage, and the Hilltop management
took it in good stride, displaying Ferdi with mortar board and
diploma after its return home.

Ferdi returned to MIT in 1990, as part of the MIT Museum's exhibit
on science humor. Since then she has served both as exhibit
artifact and landmark. "Take a right at the cow," has become a
standard instruction to visitors.

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Identification of Gourmet Meat Using FINS (Forensically
Informative Nucleotide Sequencing)," by Alistair Raymond Russel
Forrest and Patrick Robert Carnegie., "Biotechniqes," 1994, vol.
17, no 1, pp. 24-26.  The report reads in part:
"To protect both producers and consumers from illegal substitution
of cheaper meats for expensive meats, it is necessary to have
tests available that are effective with both cooked and processed
meats.... This high cost of development cannot be justified for
gourmet meats, such as emu, crocodile, and buffalo...  As an
example of the application of the improved FINS technique, a
sample of an emu shish kebab ordered at a local restaurant was
analyzed..."  It was found that the "emu" shish kebab was actually
buffalo shish keb.  (Thanks to Gene Cutler for bringing this to
our attention.)

"An Automated Feeding and Testing Device for Elephants," by
Charles W. Hyatt, Andy T. Richardson, Bruce W. Copeland, John R.
Lehnhardt, "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,"
Vol. 43, No. 1, February 1994, pp 100-101.  The abstract reads:
"An automated feeding and testing device was developed to provide
behavioral enrichment and research instrumentation for the
elephants at the National Zoological Park/Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, DC."  (Thanks to Steve Goldstein for bringiing this
to our attention.  Goldstein points out that this device may be
the world's biggest touchpad keyboard.)

******************************************************************
1994-03-9       Purpose of mini-AIR (*)

The mini-Annals of Improbable Research (mini-AIR) publishes news
about improbable research and ideas. Specifically:

A) Haphazardly selected superficial (but advanced!) extracts of
research news and satire from The Annals of Improbable Research.

B) News about the annual Ig Nobel Prize ceremony.

C) News about other science humor activities intentional and
otherwise.

WHAT IS AIR? (An introduction, of sorts)
AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff (1955-1994) of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results
(JIR)," the world's oldest satirical science journal. The new
magazine's co-founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited JIR from
1990-1994, and Alexander Kohn, who founded JIR in 1955 and was its
editor until 1989. AIR is published at the MIT Museum in
Cambridge, MA.  AIR's editorial board consists of more than 40
distinguished scientists from around the world including seven
Nobel Laureates. Every October, AIR and the MIT Museum produce the
Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose achievements cannot
or should not be reproduced.


----------------------------------------
1994-03-10      How to Submit Articles (*)

The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) publishes original
articles, data, effluvia and news of improbable research. The
material is intended to be humorous and/or educational, and
sometimes is. We look forward to receiving your manuscripts,
photographs, X-rays, drawings, etc. Please do not send biological
samples. Photos should be black & white if possible.  Reports of
research RESULTS, modest or otherwise, are preferred to
speculative proposals.

Articles are typically 500-2000 words in length.
Articles intended for mini-AIR should be much shorter.
Please send two neatly printed copies.
Alternatively, you may submit via e-mail, in ASCII format.

Because of the volume of submissions, we are unable to acknowledge
receipt of printed manuscripts unless they are accompanied by a
SELF-ADDRESSED, ADEQUATELY STAMPED ENVELOPE.
