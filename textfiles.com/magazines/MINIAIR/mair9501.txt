1995-01-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

A. There was an error in last issue's notice concerning higher-
level communications.  The correct Internet address for God ends
in .ORG, not .GOV

B. On this, day 91 of the Official AIRhead Slogans Competition,
the leading contender for AIR's official German-language slogan is
"Luft, luft, nichts als is luft."  Entries for any of the
languages should be e-mailed to BOURBAKI@NEU.EDU   As stated
previously: [1] we reserve the right to ignore all entries in
languages for which we do not readily have translators;  and [2]
we reserve the right to ignore all entries in languages for which
we do have translators.

C. Home, home (page) on the AIR
On Tuesday, January 17, the AIR home page on the World Wide Web
will be ready for your improbable reading pleasure.  This
delightful academically deviant work is called "Hot AIR."  An
ever-changing kaleidoscopic cornucopia of delights, it [probably]
contains such useful data as: an X-ray image from our research
project on "The Taxonomy of Barney;" images from various Ig Nobel
Prize ceremonies; exhibits from The Museum of Burnt Food; the
complete ancient archives of mini-AIR ("Stale mini-AIR"); photos
from the AIRhead Time Caplet ceremony, and more.
The URL is:
http://web.mit.edu/afs/athena/org/i/improb/www/home.html

D. The definition in mini-AIR 1994-10 that "an acre is the amount
of land that an ox can plow under one man in one day" was
misleading, if not inaccurate.

E. The official first premiere commemorative etcetera print issue
of AIR is now off the presses.  It is therefore hot.  Our AIRhead
printer printed a not overly large quantity of extra copies of
this historic first etcetera print issue.  Therefore, shrewd
individuals who subscribe to AIR before this little treasure trove
runs out will receive the premiere etcetera issue as the first of
their subscription.  Hurry hurry hurry, for your children's sake
and so forth.

F. On advice of counsel, we will not, after all, be publishing Lee
L. Franklin's treatise on "Obesity Among Feminist Economists:
Every Tub on its Own Bottom."

G. Because AIR is still so new, fresh, and partially gaseous, we
are unknown to the world at large.  Please help us change that.
If you know of specific publications (newspapers, magazines, etc.)
that might like to write about AIR, please tell us the pertinent
info (name of the publication, mail and e-mail addresses, phone
number).  Names of specific reporters/editors are especially
helpful.

1995-01-03      Valentine's Day AIRhead Chocolate Gender Survey

In honor of Valentine's Day, we are conducting a survey of gender
preferences for dark chocolate and light chocolate.

Votes can be cast by visiting the Hot AIR home page on the World
Wide Web (See section 1995-01-02).

Alternatively, please clip the following ballot, fill it out, and
e-mail your data to:  BOURBAKI@NEU.EDU

=============================
AIRhead Chocolate Survey Form

____MY GENDER IS: FEMALE
____MY GENDER IS: MALE

____I PREFER DARK CHOCOLATE
____I PREFER MILK CHOCOLATE

==============================

NOTES

1. Due to reasons, we cannot acknowledge receipt of individual
data submissions.

2. If you don't like chocolate, tough.


------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-04      Correction: Mass Murderer Accreditation

The survey presented in mini-AIR 1994-12 contains data and/or
conclusions that may be invalid.  The research grant money was
withdrawn during the final stages of analysis, skewing both the
results and the researchers.  Particularly suspect is the chapter
reproduced here:

     VOTING PREFERENCES OF MASS MURDERERS
     WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1994 US NATIONAL ELECTIONS

     82% voted Republican
      7% voted Democratic
     11% voted for themselves


------------------------------------------------------------
1995-01-05      More Skinny on Internet Barbie

Many readers requested that we publish the full text of Donald
Turnblade's essay for the AIRhead Time Caplet Interment Contest.
Our contest was to determine "What/who should be placed into the
Time Caplet?"  The contest winners received nothing, as this
contest was devised by AIRheads.  However, their names and winning
essays are included in the AIR home page.  The home page also
contains a separate list of items that were actually buried in the
Time Caplet.

Donald Turnblade's essay:
        "I propose that a symbol embodying
        the properties of the Internet be enclosed
        in the proposed time capsule.  It should represent
        the interconnected-ness of the Internet, the human
        nature of the inhabitance of the Internet, the
        character of Internet communications, and the intellect
        of the Internet.  Therefore, a half naked Barbie doll
        with fiber optic cables instead of doll hair would
        represent things fairly well."

1995-01-07      Ig Nobel Interlopers!!!

Several of the Nobel Laureates warned us that this would happen.

We were shocked, shocked to discover that a lobbying group in
Washington, DC has issued a press release announcing that it has
chosen the winners of the Ig Nobel Prizes.

The group is called "Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine
(PCRM)."  Neither AIR nor the Ig Nobel Board of Governors had any
previous knowledge of the group. In short, we AIRheads have no
connection with any would-be AIRheads in Washington.

While we sympathize to some extent with PCRM's underlying
sentiments (for example: we no longer advocate that monkeys be
forced to become crack cocaine addicts), we cannot permit this
group to appropriate the good name of the Ig Nobel Prizes.  We
must We must protect the purity and essence of the genuine Ig
Nobel Prizewinners.

It seems unthinkable that a group called the "Physicians Committee
for Responsible Medicine" would knowingly commit an irresponsible
act.  Yet, it has oft been observed that we live is an imperfect
universe.

The misappropriation of the name "Ig Nobel Prize" has already
begun to cause confusion and consternation -- we first learned
about it via a perplexed phone call from a magazine editor.
Anything you can do to help get the word out would be appreciated
by AIRheads everywhere.

ADDENDUM:  Perhaps you have an opinion as to whether this
unauthorized use of the phrase "Ig Nobel Prize" was a responsible
act on the part of the "Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine."  If you wish to make them aware of your opinion, you
can telephone them at 202-686-2210 or fax them at 202-686-2216 or
mail polite letters to them at 5100 Wisconsin Avenue NW,
Washington, DC  20016.

1995-01-10      Calls for Papers

CALL FOR PAPERS on the topic: "Chocolate Research."  Reports of
your research RESULTS are preferred to speculative essays.

CALL FOR NOMINATIONS for the 1995 Ig Nobel Prizes. Ig Nobel Prizes
are awarded for achievements that cannot or should not be
reproduced. Nominations may be submitted, anonymously or
otherwise, by e-mail or by standard mail.

1995-01-11      Teachers' Guide

[We might repeat this section in future issues.  Then again, we
might not.  Please pass it on to any teacher friend who would find
it useful.]

Three out of five teachers agree: curiosity is a dangerous thing,
especially in students.  If you are one of the other two teachers,
AIR and mini-AIR can be powerful tools.  Choose your favorite
hAIR-raising article and give copies to your students.  The
approach is simple.  The scientist thinks that he (or she, or
whatever), of all people, has discovered something about how the
universe behaves.  So:

* Is this scientist right -- and what does "right" mean, anyway?
* Can you think of even one different explanation that works
  as well or better?
* Did the test really, really, truly, unquestionably, completely
  test what the author thought he was testing?
* Is the scientist ruthlessly honest with himself about how well
  his idea explains everything, or could he be suffering from
  wishful thinking?

Kids are naturally good scientists.  Help them stay that way.

1995-01-12      WHAT IS AIR? (*)

AIR is a new magazine produced by the entire former editorial
staff (1955-1994) of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results."  The
new magazine's co-founders are Marc Abrahams, who edited The
Journal from 1990-1994, and Alexander Kohn, who founded The
Journal in 1955 and was its editor until 1989.  AIR is published
by the MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA.  The editorial board consists
of more than 40 distinguished scientists from around the world
including seven Nobel Laureates.  Each October, AIR and the MIT
Museum produce the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, honoring people whose
achievements cannot or should not be reproduced.
