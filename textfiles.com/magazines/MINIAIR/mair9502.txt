1995-02-02      AIRhead News Flashes and Flushes

A.  The official AIRhead German language slogan, "Luft, luft,
nichts als luft," which was announced in mini-AIR 1995-01, has
become the source of disputatious consternation.  A typographical
error, compounded by the obscurity of the quotation source,
infuriated or inspired many readers, especially Dr. W-------f from
Munich, who kindly mailed us an autographed sixteen volume set of
his German grammar textbooks.  Our thanks to him.

B.  A photograph of the Pop-Up Medical Thermometer is featured as
this month's new poster in Hot AIR, our WWW home page.  The
thermometer, described in detail in AIR 1:1, is a prime example of
technology transfer (in this case, from the poultry industry).

C.  We are in dire need of interns, volunteers, and lost souls to
assist the editor.  If you within driving distance of the MIT
Museum, have a few spare hours a month, and would like to impose
your mark on science history and yourself on the editor, please
contact us.

D.  The Gallery of Bearded Men, our project to document nature's
full range of bearded men, is now accepting photographs.  The
Gallery will eventually go on display in our WWW home page, and
will become the subject of a scholarly analysis in AIR itself.
All bearded men whose photos are included in the Gallery will be
invited to be part of the official Bearded Men delegation to this
October's Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony.

C.  We are preparing a report on Improbable Research at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory.  This will be the first in a chronic
series of reports devoted to improbable research at the world's
great scientific and medical institutions.  Each report will be
accompanied by a review of the cafeteria.

B.  The second issue of AIR will be emerging from our subterranian
printing press later this month.  In response to questions from
several (proudly) confused readers, let us clarify that:  Yes, the
continuing existence of AIR and mini-AIR depends entirely on paid
subscriptions to AIR.  We hope you will subscribe, for the sake of
future generations.

A.  A special thank you to the gentleman at CERN in Geneva who
shipped us his collection of autographed socks from members of the
European physics community.

B. Please be assured that we DO read all of our incoming
correspondence.  However, the amount we receive far surpasses our
ability to send replies.  If you really, really need a response,
please so indicate thank you very much yes indeed and please
accept our humble apologies sorry about that chief.

1995-02-03      Valentine's Chocolate Survey: Phase I Results

1088 people participated in Phase I of the 1995 AIR St Valentine's
chocolate survey. We would like to thank each and every one of you
- especially those who were kind enough to vote more than once.

73.27% of respondents were male; 25.42% were female; 1.03% could
not or would not reveal their gender; 0.28% claimed to be both.

AGGREGATE PREFERENCES
62.34% prefer dark chocolate, 33.37% prefer milk chocolate, 1.03%
voted for white chocolate, 1.78% were undecided.  In addition,
there was one vote each for light turkey, light beer, dark beer,
marzipan and chocolate licorice.  One person preferred the white
chocolate in the form of a bunny.  Two votes were of the X-rated
variety. The answer "yes" was given twice.

We also received one Haiku.

There was one person who reported being born on Valentine's Day,
and one person who reported being lactose intolerant and who
considers milk chocolate to be the spawn of Satan.  Seven people
pointed out that we confused sex with gender and one gave the
following reference: "Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn of the
Millenium," by Judith Martin, page 192.  One person suggested an
age factor be brought into the study, and two people recommended
we examine the gender of the chocolate, i.e. with or without nuts.

As you may have noticed, we added white chocolate into the survey
even though it was omitted from the original questionaire.  This
was suggested by a number of individuals, not all of whom voted
for white chocolate.  On the other hand, we recieved the following
comment "White chocolate is an aberrant albino abomination which
I'm glad to see you're ignoring."

The detailed results of Phase I:

FEMALES
64.34% preferred dark chocolate
31.25% went for milk
01.10% for white chocolate
01.84% split their vote in favor of a dark milk chocolate
00.64% were undecided or other

MALES
62.37% preferred dark chocolate
34.31% preferred milk chocolate
01.02% preferred white chocolate
10.2%  split for dark milk
00.64% were undecided or other

HERMAPHRODITES
66.67% went for dark chocolate
33.33% chose milk chocolate

UNKNOWN/OTHER
9.09% went for dark and milk respectively
27.27% opted for dark milk
54.44% were undecided or other

We leave it to educated readers to perform their own chi-square
tests.

Phase II of the survey is being conducted by ABC-TV's World News
Now program, and on a continuing basis via our WWW home page.
Results will be reported in a future issue of mini-AIR.

1995-02-04      Selected Abstracts from AIR 1:2

Selected abstract from articles published in the March/April 1995
issue (vol. 1, no. 2) of The Annals of Improbable Research.  For
details and accompanying photographs and data, see the issue
itself.

"Effectiveness of Chinese Fortune Cookies, " by Robert Feldman.
The author conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of
Chinese fortune cookies at predicting the future.  The results
were conclusive, and unexpected.

"Xerox Enlargement Microscopy (XEM)," by David P. Cann and Phillip
Pruna.  A revolutionary new microscopy technique makes it possible
to achieve subatomic resolution levels by using standard copying
machines. The process consists of iterative enlargements of
enlargements.  The authors present several examples, including a
15,392 magnification image of ferroelectric barium titanate and a
1,367,481 X image of a deuterium ion.

"The Dead in the Classroom," by Stephen Rushen.  To an early
morning freshman economics class of thirty live students, fifteen
dead students were added.  Performance of both live and dead
students was observed through the course of the semester.  Data
are presented in the categories of:  attendance; behavior;
participation; and exam scores.  In three of the four areas, the
dead students' performance was the equal of, if not superior to,
that of their living peers.

"Cindy Crawford Discovers," a new regular column written by Alice
Shirrell Kaswell.  Kaswell reports on the scientific efforts and
achievements of supermodel Cindy Crawford and her ilk, as
documented in published works in the research journals "Vogue,"
"Cosmopolitan," "Elle," etc.  This premiere column concerns
certain of Cindy Crawford's recent discoveries in chemistry, and
more.

1995-02-05      In re L. Ron Hubbard

We recently received this letter, dated 2/1/95, concerning a
recent Ig Nobel Prizewinner.  The letter is reproduced here in its
entirety:

"I recently learned that L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of
Scientology, received an 'award' from the Annals of Improbable
Research and the MIT Museum last October.

"Few men in history have had so positive an influence upon the
lives of others through their writings as has L. Ron Hubbard.

"Millions of individual men and women have achieved greater
abilities, success and happiness through his work.

"Because of this workability in improving the lives of others L.
Ron Hubbard's books have been published in 32 languages and
distributed in 103 countries.  To date, his works have sold a
total of 116,000,000 copies, making him one of the most acclaimed
and widely read authors of all time.

"For more information on his works readers can feel free to
personally contact me by correspondence to The Church of
Scientology, 448 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02115 or phone me at
617-266-9500."

        Sincerely,
        Kit Finn
        Community Services Director
        Church of Scientology

1995-02-06      'Studmuffins of Science' Calendar

by Karen Hopkin

Attention, afficionados of the academic Adonis. The curators of
the all-new Studmuffuns of Science Calendar seek photos and
biographical blurbs on the hottest young scientists from
astrophysics to zoology.  Designed to give female students and
faculty members something to ogle while they run their gels or
prepare their grants, the calendar will feature a dozen of the
smartest and sexiest science studs around.  We'll show these
brainy boys at work and at play... and reveal their intimate
secrets... their favorite board games, bacterial media, ftp sites,
and pasta recipes.

Nominate yourself.  Nominate your chairman.  Nominate the poor
unsuspecting slob slaving away at the lab bench next to you.
Remember, if you have a Y chromosome and a PhD, you could be Dr.
December.

We anxiously await your entries.  Please send calendar candidate
photos to:  Studmuffins of Science Calendar, c/o Karen Hopkin,
Producer, Talk of the Nation: Science Friday, WNYC Radio, One
Centre Street, New York, NY 10007 or c/o The Annals of Improbable
Research (address given below).  If you have any recommendations
or would be interested in getting your hands on a copy of the
steamiest science calender ever conceived, drop us a line at
khopkin@npr.org.

1995-02-09      May We Recommend...

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Cannabis in the Ear--the Legal Aspects," by S.R. Saeed, M.S.
Timms, and T. J. Woolford, "Journal of Laryngology & Otology,"
vol. 107, no. 10, 1993, p. 979.  (Thanks to John Carne for
bringing this to our attention.)

"Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of
Harold Zurcher," by John Rust, "Econometrica," vol. 55, no. 5,
Sept. 1987.  The research concerns the replacement of internal
combustion engines, not of Mr. Zurcher.  The author's name is
apparently genuine.  [NOTE: This paper won the 1992 Frisch medal
given by the Econometric Society, announced on p. 1443 of the Nov.
1992 issue of "Econometrica," vol. 60, no. 6, Nov. 1992, p. 1443.
(Thanks to Arthur Lewbel for bringing this to our attention.)

"Data manipulation: Dr. Factifuge Meets the Three Stooges," by
P.F. Dillon, "Perspectives in Biology and Medicine," vol. 33,
1990, pp. 231-236.  The paper concerns how to deal with a changing
baseline.  (Thanks to Joe Clark for bringing this to our
attention.)

(We welcome your suggestions for this column.  Please include full
citations. If possible, please send us a photocopy of the paper.)

1995-02-12      Teachers' Guide *

[We might repeat this section in future issues.  Then again, we
might not.  Please pass it on to any teacher friend who would find
it useful.]

Three out of five teachers agree: curiosity is a dangerous thing,
especially in students.  If you are one of the other two teachers,
AIR and mini-AIR can be powerful tools.  Choose your favorite
hAIR-raising article and give copies to your students.  The
approach is simple.  The scientist thinks that he (or she, or
whatever), of all people, has discovered something about how the
universe behaves.  So:

* Is this scientist right -- and what does "right" mean, anyway?
* Can you think of even one different explanation that works
  as well or better?
* Did the test really, really, truly, unquestionably, completely
  test what the author thought he was testing?
* Is the scientist ruthlessly honest with himself about how well
  his idea explains everything, or could he be suffering from
  wishful thinking?

Kids are naturally good scientists.  Help them stay that way.

1995-02-13      WHAT IS AIR? (*)

The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) is a splendid educational
magazine produced by the entire former editorial staff (1955-1994)
of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results."  AIR's co-founders are
Marc Abrahams, who edited the Journal from 1990-1994, and
Alexander Kohn, who founded the Journal in 1955 and was its editor
until 1989.  AIR is published by the MIT Museum in Cambridge, MA.
The editorial board consists of more than 40 distinguished
scientists from around the world including seven Nobel Laureates
and a convicted felon.  Each October, AIR produces the Ig Nobel
Prize Ceremony at MIT, honoring people whose achievements cannot
or should not be reproduced.
