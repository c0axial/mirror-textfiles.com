1994-01-02      BIG NEWS: The Revolt of the Mad Scientists

The entire editorial staff of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results,"
fed up after years of fighting red tape, has resigned to start a new
science humor magazine. The new magazine will be called The Annals of
Improbable Research (AIR).

AIR will be editored by Marc Abrahams, the father of the annual Ig Nobel
Prize Ceremony, who edited "The Journal of Irreproducible Results " from
1990-1994. The new magazine's name was chosen by Alexander Kohn, the Tel
Aviv University virologist who founded "The Journal of Irreproducible
Results" in 1955 and edited the journal until 1989.

All of the former "Irreproducible Results" columnists and editors haved
migrated to the new publication, as have more than 40 editorial board
members -- scientists, doctors, Nobel laureates (such as Dudley
Herschbach, Linus Pauling, Sheldon Glashow, William Lipscomb, Mel
Schwartz, Sir John Kendrew, and Jerome Friedman) and other mischievous
researchers.

The first print issue of AIR will appear later this year.
This miniature electronic version, the mini-Annals of Improbable
Research ("mini-AIR"), is available FREE on the Internet beginning with
this issue.

The Ig Nobel Ceremony, now in its fourth year, honors people whose
achievements cannot or should not be reproduced. Beginning with this
year's ceremony on October 6, the Ig Nobels will be produced jointly by
The MIT Museum and The Annals of Improbable Research.

1994-01-03      FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) about The Revolt

1. Is there a connection between The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR)
and "The Journal of Irreproducible Results?"
A. No! AIR is IN NO WAY associated with the name "The Journal of
Irreproducible Results" or with the publisher of "The Journal of
Irreproducible Results."

2. How can I help?
A. Help spread the word. Gather the horses, mount up the forces,fire up
the presses, gear up the fax machine, e-mail your loved ones, plaster
the walls and stalls, and help us get the news to everyone who might be
interested. Many of those who most need to know are not connected to the
Internet -- especially please tell them the news.

3. I have been receiving (free!) mini-JIR over the Internet. Will I
receive the new publication automatically?
A. Yes. If you were included on the old list, you are now automatically
included on the mini-AIR distribution list. You don't need to do
anything at all.

4. If I have a subscription to the print version of "The Journal of
Irreproducible Results," what will happen to that subscription?
A. That is not for us to say.  We can only suggest that you contact the
publisher of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results." AIR is IN NO WAY
associated with the name "The Journal of Irreproducible Results" or with
the publisher of "The Journal of Irreproducible Results."

5. How can I subscribe to the indispensible print version of this
wonderfully AIRy new publication?
A. We will be announcing details soon. To get details the moment (more
or less) they are ready, send a SASE to: The Annals of Improbable
Research (AIR), c/o The MIT Museum, 265 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge,
MA 02139  USA

6. How should gopher owners, librarians, etc, deal with all this?
A. Please refer questions about how to handle the new title in your
gopher, bbs, ftp site, etc. to our Technical Brains, Marilyn Geller
(mgeller@mit.edu), who is always cleaning up after the editor.

7. I want to get involved with writing, publishing, advertising or some
other aspect of AIR. How do I do it?
A. Get in touch with the editor, Marc Abrahams (air@mit.edu) or send
mail to: The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR), c/o The MIT Museum,
265 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139  USA

nickname "AIR"?
A. No.

1994-01-04      Low Probability of Any Further Abductions by Aliens

by Leonard X. Finegold
Physics Department, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA

You may well be worried about being Abducted by Aliens; Jacobs (in
"Secret Life- Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions"[1]) reports detailed
hypnotism-induced regression interviews (in which subjects recall their
past) by people who claim to have been abducted by Aliens[2] into UFO's
(Unidentified Flying Objects). You recall that D. Jacobs and his
colleage J. Mack received an Ig Nobel Prize for this work.  A numerical
analysis, of birthdates of people who have been Abducted by Aliens,
shows that people born after 1970 are not abducted. Hence one may safely
assume that the probability of further Alien Abductions is very low,
perhaps even zero.
[The complete paper, with full details of avoiding Abductions, will
appear in a print issue of The Annals of Improbable Research].

Notes
[1] Jacobs, D.M., "Secret Life - Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions,"
Simon & Schuster, New York, 1992.
The thesis of the book is that the Aliens temporarily abduct the
Abductees into UFO's to use them in sexual reproductive processes. The
book features an inroduction by John Mack.
[2] It should be stressed that "Aliens" means not simply "un-American",
but "un-Earthly." Well-documented abductions by aliens from other
countries are therefore excluded from this discussion.

1994-01-05      Student Science Writing Skills Documented

by Rebecca German
Biology Department, University of Cincinnati

A non-biology majors course in Introductory Biology was given this
assignment:
  Prepare a one page summary of Stephen Jay Gould's essay about
  the evolution of the Panda's Thumb, published by W.W. Norton.
On the assignment sheet, the author and publisher's names were displayed
in large print, courtesy of Kinko's Campus Copying. The instructions
including the following details:
  Your opening sentence should summarize the author's central idea.
  Do not start this sentence with "The main idea is...."; rather use
  something like "Darwin maintains that survival of the fittest is the
  basis of natural selection".

Results of three sections, totaling 426 students:
  68.1% started their essays with the sentence "Gould maintains that..."
  9.2% started their essays with the sentence "Darwin maintains that..."
  0.2% started their essay with the sentence "W.W. Norton maintains..."

1994-01-06      May We Recommend...

Research reports that merit a trip to the library:

"Injuries due to Falling Coconuts," by Peter Barss, "The Journal of
Trauma," vol. 24, no. 11, 1984, pp. 990-991. The abstract reads in part:
"A 4-year review of trauma admissions to the Provincial Hospital,
Alotau, Milne Bay Province, reveals that 2.5% of such admissions were
due to being struck by falling coconuts. Since mature coconut palms may
have a height of 24 up to 35 meters and an unhusked coconut may weigh 1
to 4 kg, blows to the head of a force exceeding 1 metric ton are
possible." (Thanks to James Barone for this to our attention.)

"Do Men Lie on Fear Surveys?" by K. A. Pierce and D. R. Kirkpatrick,
"Behavioral Research and Therapy," vol. 30, no. 4, July, 1992, pp. 415-
418. The authors conclude that the answer to this question is yes.
