                  Speed of Thought ... a farewell of sorts.

      Xann,

      Peace, bro ... you know, if anything, the greatest reward has been
      to see those two words echoed so emphatically since HoWL went up
      a couple, few, who remembers anyway? years ago.  Yeah, bro ...
      peace.

      You, my friend, have *grown*.  I really regret not saving those old
      backups of Howl from two years ago ... if only to compare and
      contrast some of your posts.  Shit man, I remember the first day
      you logged on, something about "I'm here ... computer crime is in
      my future, hook me up with some people in the KNOW!"  Hahah.
      Beautiful.  And you dug the HOWL PHILOSOPHY bulletin I had up ...
      that felt good.  I think it was the first time someone had actually
      shown appreciation for the work and feeling I'd put into the board.
      There's been many more True Believers(tm) since then, but you were the
      first that I can remember.

      Shit, at the time I don't think either of us knew what this whole
      deal would come to mean to the both of us, ... what it means now.
      Ya know?  Sure, we *wanted* to know ... and we were looking ... and
      even now I think we're just scratching the surface, but the fact
      remains ... In a world of often bland cyber-thought, we've managed
      to (with the help of some really beautiful people) build a bit of
      meaning(?) and creativity in the void.  I feel a really intense sense
      of brotherhood with you on this level, bro ... thanks.

      Your off to Michigan in a week or so.  I'll miss you.  I'll miss
      Lovers.  If ever a piece of someone left with that body as it
      travelled to a new place, a piece of me goes with you to Michigan.
      But I also know that physical distance really doesn't mean shit to
      folks that operate at the speed of thought, anyway.  Heh.  So fuck
      the miles, the distance.  It's not real.  We'll be here, we'll be
      there.  You'll be there, you'll be here.  There's some that would
      say that we're everywhere at once, anyway, ... so what the fuck,
      eh?  Peace, bro...  High speed into darkness...

                           The Excommunication of God

      once upon a time, the Second God, being the creator of the universe
      and all that is holy, approached the vatican walking tall.

      and after much screening, searching, and questioning at the pearly
      gates the second god was allowed to enter, and visit the only being
      in the entire universe above him, that being the First god; the
      preserver of the church, the master of the house, the giver of
      indulgences.

      [indulgences, for those who dont know, were <are?> "sin permits"
      given to crusaders, knights of the church, and those who donated
      lots of money to the church long ago. this practice is no longer
      part of the Kingdom, however]

      now, the first god liked the second god a lot, although his
      survival did not depend on the Him. after all, it was He who had
      first breathed life into the kingdom. and as the second god stepped
      into the confession booth, a loving, fatherly smile appeared on the
      face of the first god.

      "forgive me, father, for i have for years now done things pleasing
      in yo sight."

      "alas, you are only inhuman, my child. speak, and be forgiven."

      "hold on a moment, i have a list here....ok. well, first, it has
      taken me over three hundred years, but i have at last finished
      sorting my children from the heretics, for All were killed. now
      both sides of the gorge of judgement are nearly full, it seems.
      also, i have...i have desired an indulgence from his holiness..."

      "please, explain, child."

      "well, ive done a lot of good things over the years, you know....i
      created the universe, the church, and i sacrificed my only child to
      save this world from eternal death. im sure there are plenty of
      other things i could think of, if you could just give me a second
      here..."

      "no need, my son. but i am afraid i cannot allow you to be the
      benefactor of an indulgence--"

      "but i wont use it father! no, no, no! i just want to have one.
      just one surely, so many knights, so many bishops, kings,
      monks...is it not fair and just that the creator of all this should
      have at least one?"

      "i see thy point, but you are not man, and you are not yr own. you
      are the all-father, and you belong to the church, my son. and you
      must be perfect or, verily, yr usefulness to yr people will
      diminish!"

      "well, im tired of it! my people! who are you to talk of my
      people?!?  useful? HA! if i were of any use to them, this use would
      i have been put to long ago! my people are a minority, not a
      globally spanning flock such as yrs! you can HAVE them, john! ill
      take my people, and you take yrs! and from here on out, i am NOT a
      perfect being! no more stress for me, buddy hand me my time card!"

      "WICKED CHILD! if this insolent behaviour continues, i shall have
      you excommunicated!"

      "blow it out yr beanie!"

      and thusly did god split from the church...

           Just a Moment

      For a fleeting moment
      It all makes sense.
      All that you were, are, will be,
      Comes together.
      The universe apologizes
      For being such a shithead
      And making you think
      That there was a reason
      Behind it all.
      The hand of your god
      Comes to you
      Calls you forth
      Slaps your face.
      Your brain steps out
      For a lunch break
      It has earned
      From its years
      Of doing NOTHING.
      Your memories laugh at you.
      Your heart takes a sideways dive.
      Your senses lie.
      A thousand padded drumsticks
      Beat at your head
      Till your bleeding
      From the ears.
      The moment passes.

                        Tales of the Net ... Part II

      The exploratory probe floated slowly, unseen, several yards above
      the street, and mirrored to it's surroundings on all optical
      wavelengths.  No radiation, no power signature, everything passive
      reception.  Throughout the night it searched, sensing and following
      the data flows. It was a slow task. But the probe was in no hurry.
      Probes are thorough, and this probe was no exception.

      For days, then weeks, then months it kept at it's task - find the
      storehouse of creativity and learning on this planet.

      It soon identified the elements of the communication matrix.
      Huge hubs switching & routing the data flow, but no life. Noted and
      omitted. Virtual caverns of data and sequences and processes, with
      barely a flicker of creativity or insight. Raw data - lifeless
      sinkholes.  Eliminated from the scans. But every now and then, a
      flare of life, radiating into the darkness. Not in the large
      buildings and complexes it expected, but a simple house here, a
      trailer there, inconspicuous dwellings in nondescript places. The
      probe realized that it's analytical functions were too rudimentary
      and unsophisticated for this task. The sorting & analysis would be
      done later by units designed for that.

      On some of the brighter nodes, the probe attempted to unobtrusively
      join the flow, to better assess it's content. It was invariably
      futile.  The jargon and mindset were too free and sporadic to
      follow and interact with. But the keywords and signature it was
      programmed to find were there, and it settled down to record.
      "Why...", "If...", "How...", "Suppose..." "I hope..." - the
      concepts flowed, and the probe was content. It's mission would be
      successful after all. The overall content was rising, growing,
      multiplying. Yes, this planet may yet be a success.

                  Twelve Ways To Shed Light On Your Reality

      1. Grow you hair, go downtown at lunch hour, stand atop the nearest
         Mercedez Benz (in platform shoes with gold fish in them) and
         tell the masses how you feel.

      2. If someone annoys you, say, "You annoy me."

      3. Jump off a tall bridge into very cold water.

      4. Ride the electric handicap-cart at Randalls.

      5. Try not eating for three days.

      6. If you ever want to tell your parents to fuck off, tell them to
         fuck off.

      7. If you ever want to tell your parents you love them, tell them
         you love them.

      8. Go climb a very very tall rock.

      9. Pick up a pen.

      10. See fear as a means to an end.

      11. Skydiving.

      12. Throw yourself in front of a really big truck.  (this last as
          the most desperate, but also the most effective method of
          realizing your reality).

      believe it or not, i wont eat again. not for a while, at least.

      i tried, earlier, to eat my Standard ration of pork. nearly
      retched.  my sustenance has been only a fragrance indigenous to the
      far east, called patchouly. its sweet and frail scent walks with
      me on my favourite green shirt.

      my! how things have changed!

      there are some things for which one must not dare hope. the door to
      disappointment, while it may teach us, is better left closed.  and
      when we are the target of things for which we dared not dream, we
      are most surprised, humbled. elated.

      a gift i gave; a poem, to read to _____, to soothe and nothing
      more.

      why are you my friend?

      no answer. the next seven hundred and seventy seven years were
      spent talking, playing, betraying inhibitions. lips barely
      touching, as not to break anything in the room. and i am quite
      happy to announce to anyone listening that for those ensuing
      decades i, on my lacerated knees, breathed the air of this queen.
      to her, it was refuse. to me, it was ambrosia.

      o why are you my friend?

      no answer.
      a kiss should be effortless, motionless;
      the pinnacle of peace, be it uneasy or otherwise.
      and it was this.

                                   Shaken

      And then I was shaken so terribly by a coughing fit. Bad. Enough to
      leave me raw in the throat ... wanting aspirin, coffee, another
      cigarette--a home remedy of whisky and lemon, something.  I'd grown
      impervious (I'd thought) to sickness, being so long in that room,
      alone...sure of health.  And the bed always there for sleeping,
      breathing.

      The neighbor lady called three times that day.  Something about
      hearing a dog bark the night before.  Something about a lock not
      wanting to work right on the back door.  Mostly just wanting to
      hear another human voice, I think.  Tired.  Wrinkled old woman
      whose eyes watered so much and were difficult to look at.

      And of course, it rained.  "Plink,...Plink,"...on the air
      conditioner outside.  Then a roar as the real rain came down.
      Sheets of wet fell hard for thirty minutes that day.  It'd been
      sickeningly hot the past few weeks.  No rain.  Needless to say, the
      ground was dry thirty after.  We need a hurricane, I'd commented a
      few days before.  That'd set a few things straight.  That'd really
      get things 'a hoppin.  Folks just shook their heads.

      They did that a lot, people,...shook their heads I mean.  Or
      shuffled their feet, or mumbled under their breath, or looked away.
      Frightened?  If so, of what?  A new slant on their real?  Mine?
      Opinion?  What?  For once, lady, look at me when you talk to me.
      I'll try to do the same for you.  I promise.

      "...and they don't understand that he's been shaken."

            In the Great Tradition of Whitman ... Or Not So.


      In the great tradition of Whitman,
       with his Mannahatta, his masts and masts
       like toothpicks along the docks and
         harbors of New York.

      An old father, that one, Dad,
      Pop, counsellor to the harlots,
      lover of the dirt especially,
      lover of all things detestable
          in man, in woman ...

      I think of walks along the beach
        and trips through the city with
        it's killing scent and the
        impenetrable thick of the wood.
      I think of work and the swinging
        hammer and the heat and the blood
        shed from the brow of a pick axe.
      I remember the wanting and the not
        so wanting, the pushing for the
          know, the remembering.

        (And all of these, of course, being tied up in the soul of
        man and at all times offering their own influence in that
        same mans remembering of his place in the order of things,
        ....or not so)


      It is true that he walked that
       beach with it's piles of drift
       and dredge, blind, as it were,
      finding the whole of Mannahatta
      beating life into a small island
          of silt and wash,
      the heart of a city beating
          white and airy in the
      transparent shine of a bubble.
      And upon that bubble, reflecting
      in inverse and forgetting, all
      the poems of all the poets sung
          and unsung.

        "to talk about one's self a great deal
         can also be a means of concealing oneself."
                        --nietzsche

      nothing more than a scarecrow
      scary indeed!
      knocking at yr door.
      nothing more than straw,
      concealed so well by ragged clothes,
      knocking at yr door.
      stuffings stuffing.
      nothings nothing,
      though so many words are spoken.

      nothing more than a twig
      scary, indeed!
      supporting.
      --this spine; offered long ago
      and though leaves are here and there and mine
      this pillar is of you, dearest.
      stuffings may be snuffing
      nothing still is nothing.
      yr gift it stands both meek and proud,
      and it is this that i cling to when the crows are gone.

      nothing more than a scarecrow
      scary indeed!
      knocking at yr door.
      nothing more than straw
      bursting from overfilled clothes,
      knocking at yr door.
      though my stuffings may be bluffing
      i swear i feel as nothing
      when my promises are broken.

                             See Flying Beauty

      Way back, way back before it was all automated, she would fly
      across the sky, looping, shootin' from cloud to cloud. They
      automated it later, yeah, but boy those were the days! We'd sit on
      the porch, watching those amazing niggers harvest the sky! Chasing
      down those damn birds.  Hard to imagine now, though. The automatons
      don't have near as much class as this one girl had. Most of the
      other niggers didn't have it, either.  She was one of a kind, that
      one.

      See, my grandmother was a humanist. She pleaded and pleaded with
      old grandpa to quit raising the bird-chasers, but it was in his
      blood and she was his fool wife. Anyway, she'd pick one out of the
      litter sometime.  Back then, they had to be careful how they
      engineered them. If you made the wings big and strong enough,
      they'd require too much natal care.  Vice versa, too. If you made
      'em too ground-worthy, they wouldn't be worth a shit in the air.

      So grandma'd pick one of the ones that was going to take too much
      care.  Usually, grandpa'd just take the useless newborns down to
      the pond in a sack. Toss the whole lot of 'em in the water. Kill
      'em.

      Grandma picked this one out of the runt pile that turned out to be
      the most productive, and not only that, when she flew it was pure
      artistry.  Least, that's what that poet said.

      Yeah, some fool poet was driving by one day, came up and told my
      grandpa what a beautiful sight that nigger was up in the air. Also
      said she wasn't such a bad looker on the ground, if you know what I
      mean. I only got a good look at her in the air, since I was usually
      in school when she was on the ground. Years later grandpa told me
      she was, indeed quite a looker. Enough to where he had an affair
      with her.

      That was after he started to charge admission to see her. He put up
      signs on the highway that said See Flying Beauty - $5. Guess he
      shoulda hired that poet to make a better sign. Anyway, he only got
      a few customers, so he gave up on that. And it wasn't just the
      sign, either. Everytime she'd go up in the air, anyone for miles
      around could watch her harvest the birds. Most folk who actually
      paid to see her, and there weren't many, were from out of town and
      just passing through.

      Well, then there was the affair. Grandma didn't take that very
      well.  After all, she had raised the nigger from the ground up, so
      to speak.  She was so hopping mad at grandpa that she went a little
      crazy and shot the flyin' girl with grandpa's shotgun. Just before
      she died, the girl let out some kind of weird scream; by this time,
      everyone had heard the shot and was looking at the scene. The other
      niggers gave grandma this sort of look, and then they all flew
      away, carrying the body. That's one sight I'll never forget.
      Grandma never did raise a runt after that, either.

      Years later, after grandma had died, grandpa would sit in the very
      rocker you're in now and tell me how much he really did love his
      wife, and how he regretted what he had done. But then he'd tell me
      what it was like to make love while flying a quarter mile above the
      ground. He always said he couldn't begin to describe what it felt
      like, and damned if I can't begin to describe the look on his face
      as he tried.
                                               (homer the brave)
