	Aiiight. This is Wisdom holding down the Music section with the
flava in for your ears.

	ORGANIZED KONFUSION "Stress: The Extinction Agenda" This is the
motherfucking shit. From start to finish, your ears are treated to a lyrical
masterpiece. Although a dark cousin to their first album, this is not a guns
and blunts album like most of (c)rap out there right now. The album starts
with an intro that clearly describes the state of the average hip-hop buyer,
CONFUSED (by all the booty shit available). Although I wish the (Extra)
Large Professor remix of Stress was included, there are more than enough
joints to nod ya head to. Let's Organize is the motherfucking shit for any
DJ to rock at a party with the upbeat track and the phat chorus done by
Q-Tip from ATCQ. But the vast lyrical complexities come to life with Bring It
On and Stray Bullet. Bring It On displays Pharoah Monch's lyrical skills that
even non-heads will be open to. Stray Bullet may easily be the definitive
cut for 94 describing a stray bullet as travels from victim to victim. The
lyrics draw you so close you can feel the shell strike each (unintended)
target.
	"Stress: The Extinction Agenda" is a definite winner in a race full
of losers and also-rans (see Warren G and Da Brat albums)

	RATING: * * * * 1/2 (4.5) Near Classic


	Not much else to mention right now except that new Raekwon single
from the Fresh soundtrack "Heaven or Hell" is straight butter with no chaser
needed. More on that next iss... And who is this kid Mic Gernonimo, I 
caught a ear kinda late but this kid is nice.... And the new Common Sense 
will get all you motherfuckers open, mark my words.... One more thing, if
you know where to get some fat mix tapes (Ron G, Kid Capri, Funkmaster Flex,
especially Doo Wop). E-Mail the address at the top with the 411. Peace!

		with your host: WISDOM

	"The Killer" - This is the perfect filck to watch while sessed. The
movie has so much action, it's ridiculous. The story revolves around a         
hitman who while making a hit, blinds a female singer. Later, feeling sorry
for her, befriends her and tries to help her get her sight back. To get the
loot, he decides to make one last hit. Something goes wrong and now the cops
and his client are after him. This movie is Chinese with the dubbed voices
(like the kung-fu flicks). there are so many dope scenes in this flick that
you will straight tip (especially when you're high!).

	RATING: * * * 1/2 (3.5) A Hit


	"Blue Chips" - This movie is about a coach who is at a once success-
ful basketball program which is now just mediocre. He decides to cheat (like
every other Div. I coach) and get those "blue chip" players he needs. The
movie is so-so and does prove that Anfernee Hardaway can't act (but can ball
his ass off!). It's OK at times but didn't keep me from snoozin.

	RATING: * * (2) Needs Help.


	"The Inkwell" - I though this shit was goin to be a waste of time,
but actually was pretty cool, if just to see Jada Pinkett almost naked!       
(Treach you lucky motherfucka!) It's about this kid whose having problems
growing up (he 15-16 and playing with a doll and riding a fucked up bike!)
His parents don't quite understand him much (Dad's a Panther or Panther
wanna-be) and take a vacation down to Virginia on some island full of 
brothers. He hooks up with his cousin and his boys and slowly but surely
begins to come of age. First off, I wanted more Jada Pinkett (just too dope
for words!) but the movie is pretty funny, espicially a fightthat happens in
the middle of the movie. I especially liked the music (from the 70s) and a
appearance bu Jade (more fine honeys!).

	RATING: * * * 1/2 (3) A Hit

	I'm goin to make it to see Fresh (if the ends are right) so I'll have
that for you next issue. Peace!

	Well it's the Lo-Life here as usual, and I've been so high I let
Wisdom do his thang but it's time to drop bombs on ya mental.

The info contained here has been taken from various sources and I could give

take it personal! (And Thanx!)

VMB Hacking
-----------

	How to Hack Them:

	VMB systems have very different setups. they can be a single #, there 
you enter the VMB #, and seperate dialups for each vmb. OK to hack these out, 
you can randomly try different passcodes all day. (#, * or 0 are common ways 
to get into VMBs). You want your own virgin system that has had no experience 
with hackers, ot you'll never get access to a VMB. You can get a semi-
automatic VMB hacker (I know of none offhand) and try it. Some systems have
vacant boxes that have a pattern to them. You always want open boxes because 
the operators won't notice anything, and people won't leave stupid messages 
and nobody will steal your box.

	Patterns:

	They always make simple patterns for vacant VMBs until the real owner 
recieves their new box. These patterns are very simple. Usually, they are just 
the box #, or none at all. Others have formulas where you can add/subtract #s 
to find different passcodes. These will only work on vacant boxes, real ones 
have the passcodes personalized. You can tell because there will be no 
greeting, or a mechanized greeting. I have found that systems like to use 
5XXX, 3XXX, 1XXXX, 6XXXX, 9XXXX. But they can be anything, it's just some 
people like them organized. if you can't get any boxes, move to another 
system because they have had hacker encounters of the 3rd kind.

	Operation:

	They always have menus, so that's self-explanatory. Just push the 
letter of the function on the phone.(If you don't have 3s on your phone, get 
one!)


----------------
Credit Card Info
----------------       

	Their is a misconception that all cards are credit cards. This is not 
true. For example, American Express is a charge card and not a credit card. 
American express is a charge card since the owner of the card must pay off the 
whole amount when his bill comes. +If the owner doesn't, he or she is in 
serious shit. One thing about the American Express card is that it has no
limit on how much the person can spend as long as the person can pay off the
bill when it comes. basically, the card is based on the person's good judge-
ment on how much money they have. Why is there American Express Gold and 
regular American Express then? It still has a hidden limit which you cannot 
buy a Ferrari with a regular American Express card. You could however do it 
with an American Express Platinum (if you can find one!). This means you can 
buy more expensive things at one time with a Gold or Platinum card. Credit
cards have a set limit after you apply for the card. Usually a classic Visa 
has about $700 plus or minus $100. Mastercard on the other hand has about a
$1000 limit on it.

	Types of Cards:

	Credit Cards                    Charge Cards
	------------                    ------------
	VISA                            American Express
	Mastercard                      American Express Optima
	Discover                        "    "         " Gold
					"    "         " Platinum

	Here's a couple types of cards I do not know what category they fall 
into since they are never accepted by mail order companies. One is Diner's 
Club International and Carte Blanche.

	VISAs are grouped either 4XXX XXX XXX XXX or 4XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This 
is either a C or a P. The two groupings used are C for Classic (regular) and 
P for Preferred (better, much better). There are banks preferred cards that 
are grouped in 4333.

	Mastercards are 12 digits grouped in blocks of four each 5000 BBBB 
XXXX XXXX. BBBB being the bank'd ID number. The bank may have more than one ID 
number for their 5000 XXXX XXXX XXXX cards.

	Mail Order Companies:

	Most of the mail order companies will accept Visa or Mastercard. Some 
will also take American Express and Discover. These mail order companies check 
the card by calling a TRW center to check if the amount of the order will 
exceed the limit. In either case of an approval or declining, the mail order 
company will call you back to check with you the order you have placed. 
Anyways, a way of finding a valid card is to call a credit approval system 
yourself. Here's some ways of checking:

	1-800-554-2265 for checking Mastercard or Visa

		for mastercard 10#1067#24#CARD number#EXP date#XX*XX#

		for VISA       20#1067#24#CARD number#EXP date#XX*XX#

		- 10 and 20 are the types of cards
		- 1067 is the banks ID number
		- 24 is the merchant number (52 will also work)
		- EXP date must be in the form MMYY (month/year)
		- XX*XX is the amount. Use a small number like 16*39 for 
		  $16.39.

	Another way mail order companies use to verify cards is to call the 
bank of the card and verify the name of the person and the billing address 
versus the name you gave the mail ordetr company and the address (drop site). 
So the only way of getting pass this is to have the stuff sent to the person's 
address or getting the waybill number from the mail order company and 
intercepting the package at UPS or Federal Express office before the package
arrives at the card owner's address.

More Credit Card Shit
---------------------

		Mastercard       - 5xxx xxxx xxxx xxxc
		Visa             - 4xxx xxx xxx xxc
		Visa Gold        - 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxc
		American Express - 3xxxxxxxxxc

	If you have an IQ above 0 the you would know that the X's can be 
filled in with a random number from 0-9. But what are the C's filled in with? 
The C is the check digit for the whole card. In order to compute this check 
digit, you must use a mathematical formula. First, let's assume the Mastercard 
we made up was '5123 1234 1234 123c'. The first thing we need to do is assign 
each number a place value, so we would start from the right and work our way 
to the left, for example:

15  14  13  12    11  10  9   8    7   6   5   4    3   2   1 c
|   |   |   |     |   |   |   |    |   |   |   |    |   |   | |
5   1   2   3     1   2   3   4    1   2   3   4    1   2   3 c

	Now starting from the right (#1) and moving to the left (#15) we would 
take every -ODD- number and multiply it by 2. [(3*2)+(1*2)+(3*2)+(1*2)+(3*2)+
(1*2)+(2*2)+(5*2)] The would come out to be 38 from our example. We would now 
round the number to the nearest number divisible by 10 which in this case 
would be 40. We would subtract 38 from 40 (40-38=2). Our check digit in this 
example would be 2. 

	Check this number with the above process and have fun!

	(NOTE: I tried this and when you call the TRW # it says the merchant
ID is incorrect or something like that. Let me know if you have any success
with this. LL 9/20/94)

Rocket Tubes
------------

(Reprinted from and F.B.I. (not the agency) article and edited by Wisdom)


  The rocket tube is a simple device that will let you destroy things at 
extreme distances with relative ease!  This desturctive mechanism allows you
to take out buildings, low flying aircraft, doors, and even people out from 
afar.  Interested yet?? Well read on..

  The rocket tube can be easily manufactured by taking a few trips around 
town....  A working knowledge in Model Rocketry will help you VERY MUCH!  The 
better you are at rocket building, the more accuracy and power your tube will 
have!

The back end should be TOTALLY sealed.. unless you want your face ripped apart.
a blast shield around the front end made of sheet metal would also be a good 
idea! But is not nessecary if you put the handle farther back.
NOTE- the farther back the handle is.. the harder it will be to keep the 
rocket straight.. and your accuracy will suffer considerably.

Now.. the rocket is simple to construct... just build a basic rocket..
Now, cut the fins in a manner as shown...
		






		       ______________
		      /             /
		     /             /

		     \             \
		      \_____________\

The total width of the rocket(with 4 fins!) should be equal to the diameter of 
the rocket tube.. sand them off so they fit nicely.
 
Now put the little straw on the side of the rocket.

Find yourself a long piece of metal, round and thin.It must be able to fit 
into the little straw on the side of the rocket, and should be 3 inches longer 
than the rocket tube.

Put the metal piece through the straw, and fit the rocket into the tube.. You
need to secure the metal dowel in a place in the sealed end of the tube. this
will serve as a guide for the rocket. It may be easier if the seal on the back
is removable, or at least seal it on AFTER you put the dowel in.
The entire tube, dowel and all should be greased smooth, all throughout the
inside. This will insure a smooth launch.

Now.. to build your rocket.. I will give a distance estimation based on some
Estes charts, and personal knowledge..

Engine size |  horizontal range |  verticle range |
---------------------------------------------------
A8-3        |  200-400 ft       | 200-600ft       |
b6-4        |  300-600ft        | 300-900ft       |
C6-5        |  350-1000ft       | 400-1450ft      |
d12-5       |  600-1500ft       | 800-2300ft      | (the best! most advised)


You will want to select your engine depending on the range of the target.
Also remember..  these are MUCH heavier than normal rockets.. it is not 
advised to aim low!! Aim just high of your target, depending on the distance.. 
For very long distances.. aim at a 30-45 degree angle.. Practice makes perfect. 
Practice with weighted down duds before you go indiscriminatly blowing up 
nuke plants..

A normal rocket is made with recovery wadding, and a nice little parachute.. 
Fuck these.. This should be made the following way.

A)Take 1 paper towel.. soak it in gasoline.. 
B)Take 1 paper towel.. soak it in battery acid, and muriatic(HCL)acid. let dry
(optional ^^^)
C)Mix gasoline and gunpowder in a 3:1 ratio.. disolve thouroughly. Soak 2 
paper towels in this and let dry.

 Now take your tube and do the following..

---------------------------------------------------------------------
  nose || gunpowder           |     C      |  B   |   A  |engine
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(a,b,c correspond to the steps listed above)

Now, there are two ways to build this rocket..

1)  Rocket will fly until out of fuel and then explode..(can be delayed)
  This is good for kiling people, scare tactics, and airplane destruction.

2)  Rocket will run out of fuel, engine will eject.. and will explode on 
  impact. The uses for this are obvious, doors, cars, buildings, landforms.

For number one.. glue the nose cone on.. and launch(more on that later)

For number two.. replace C with A.  Omit c and b.  place a stopper about 1 
inch thick in front of the engine. Glue this in.. Fill the remaining space 
with more gunpowder.  Now.. take the shotgun shell, and glue it in so that 
the primer faces out the front of the rocket. Drive the nail through the nose 
cone, so that the head of the nail is at the tip of the cone. Get some more 
tubing and.. 

       ---b-----------
a------         --c-----------
-------         --------------
       ----------------

a is the nose cone, b is the extra tubing, and c is where the shotgun shell 
is.. the nail tip, sticking out from A should just touch the primer. put some 
glue around it to insure the placment.  B should be glued around C. and A 
should have a very WEAK bond to b.

When the rocket hits cone first.. the bond between a and b breaks. this causes 
the nail to break the primer, and set off the shell.. causing a VERY nasty 
explosion.


Ok.. now the last part.. the engine...
Take your engine.. and make a slow burning fuse... 15-20 seconds should be 
enough.. (depending on how fast you want the rocket going off)..
Now.. Scrape a larger hole out of the clay in the back.(use a drill bit)
FIll this with gunpowder and a fuse. place a little glue on the end to hold it
all in.


To launch..  place the straw(from the rocket) on the dowel(in the tube). Get a 
lighter.. Light the fuse. Tilt the tube back so the rocket falls back into the 
tube. DO NOT PUSH IT IN YOURSELF..(I shouldn't need to explain this one!)
Aim the tube, and wait for the rocket to fire.. hold steady.. this mutha kicks 
one damn ass punch! Also.. wear goggles.. don't be an idiot.


NOTE- The engine bit can also be done with the regular igniters from a rocket.. 
but remember.. they have a 50% failure rate.. so by gaining an electrical push 
button system.. you can lose your launch speed.. and possibly your life!



What to use this for..

  These rockets will be refered to as TYPE A (launch/explode) and type B
(launch/impact/explode). Type a is normally used to cause a BIG fireball in 
the middle of nowhere..  but if launched into somebody's stomach.. can be 
quite cool! Also this type is used to blow up aircraft, due to the phenominal 
aim you would need to actually HIT the plane.. this can take it out as long 
as you get near the craft.. and time it right.  These are also used to destroy 
crowds.. This tactic is quite deadly! Launching one of these into a crowd is 
like blowing up a bomb in the middle. These rocket tubes are comparable to 
RPGs and bazookas!!

Type B is used to take out tanks, cars, doors, buildings and other assorted 
non moving objects. The explosion from type B is MUCH bigger than a.. but will 
not travel as far!  Type B can also be used to set off a pre-planted explosive
somewhere by aiming at the general vicinity.

NOTE:
If the engine fires and the rocket does not leave the tube.. Chuck the 
tube .. and hit the deck.. you fucked up somewhere.. and the rocket will still 
explode!!!

Also- These tubes are REUSABLE.. so you can make 400 rockets, and only need 
one tube... but try and re-grease it FREQUENTLY.. otherwise the above may 
happen to YOU!

Also.. the first time you make this.. try it without the dowel in the middle.. 
sometimes it works better with, and sometimes better without. I suppose it
depends on the quality of the rocket.

Homemade Grenades
-----------------

	Got problems with motherfuckas sweatin you, bitches trying to key up 
your car or put sugar in your tank, or punks ass cops fucking with you for 
no particular reason... Whatever the case may be, they little gems may help 
you out in your predicament!


Gerbil Feed Bomb:
-----------------
GERBIL FOOD
TWO CONTAINERS OF AIRPLANE GLUE
GASOLINE
GLASS JAR
FUSE OR WICK

	
	Take the glass jar and powder up the gerbil food (preferably the green 
pellets but the little cylinders will do) to about half full of the jar. Now 
take the modeling cement and pour it in. Mix it very thoroughly. Now fill the 
rest of the bottle with gasoline. Shake it up. Now drill a hole in the top and
put the fuse (wick) thru the hole. Light and run like hell!! This is VERY 
POWERFUL! One went off in Beirut and killed 57 people!!!!


Force Grenade:
--------------
VINEGAR
BAKING SODA
PLASTIC BOTTLE (2 Liter is good)


	This liitle fucker will blow just about anyone 30-100 feet back!! Can 
cause a car to nearly flip over and cause nuclear damage to a window!!

	Take some paper towels and fill them with a lot of baking soda. Wrap 
them VERY thoroughly (but small enough to fit in the neck of the bottle). Fill
the bottle about a little more than halfway up with the vinegar. Take the 
baking soda rolls (about 10) and drop them in. Then just close and THROW 
FAST!! The reaction causes a HUGE amount of CO2 gas to be produced which 
cause a BIG BOOM!! You could use a glass bottle, which will create MANY nice, 
sharp glass shards to be an anti-personnel device (but I don'r recommend it!).


Death Grenade:
--------------
AMMONIUM CONTAINING LIQUID (Ammonia water is good)
CHOLRINE CONTAINING LIQUID (Chlorine Bleach is good)
A PLASTIC BOTTLE

	Like the Force Grenade, except it releases a cloud of poison gas SO 
deadly it will kill anyone nearby! (not to mention the explosion itself!)

	Replace the baking soda above with the ammonium liquid and the vinegar 
with the chlorine liquid. This will produce QUITE a blast and green cloud 
will sweep a city block, so stay downwind of this little MF. It takes a little 
longer to explode also BUT DON'T think you have all the time in the world or 
YOU WILL BE VERY DEAD!! You may have an EXTRA 10-15 seconds before you have to 
throw it!!

	This issue is more of the length that the rest of the issues of URBAN will be and
let me know what you think of the articles and if you have tried any of the 
stuff in Da Good Shit (lord knows I have tried most of them!) and give your 
recommendations, results, etc. And if you know of some good Mail Order Catalogs 
mail me the 411 on them. Not much really else to say so I'll turn it over to 
Wisdom to finish. 

	I just want to say get that new Roots single "Distortion to Static" 
cause it's fatter than Moby Dick after eating Rerun!! And that I would like 
that if you enjoy this magazine, spread it around... print it out for others 
to see and give us your thoughts!!

	Out... Swayze!!!
