        What's up this is Wisdom here with the shiznit for dat ass. Oh and
        fuck you Lo-Life...

        REDMAN "Dare Iz a Darkside" - This motherfucka was so phat, I rushed
to get it when Lo-Life told me how dope it was. Now first let me say for the
most part I HATE FUNK (P-Funk, G-Funk, E-Funk...the E-Double Shit) but this
album hooked me. The lyrics are so fucking wild on this bitch it's incredible.
I knew Red had lyrics but damn! The music starts off OK but as it moves on 
the productions get better and better and one of the best cuts "Can't Wait"
is produced by Erick Sermon. But this MF rocks except they should've put the
"Rockafella" remix on here but "Tonight's the Night" remix is here so I can 
deal. The bets cuts are "Can't Wait", "Cosmic Slop" w/ E-Dub and Keith
Murray still letting us know he got mad skillz, "Green Island" love it, and
"We Run N.Y." w/ Hurricane G (this girl is cold! yes I still say that!). 
There are no faults with this album in my book but I wouldn't rate it perfect
cuz I hate FUNK. BUT IT TODAY! BUY IT NOW!!!

        RATING: * * * * 1/2 (4.5/5) Almost a Classic

        METHOD MAN "Tical" - This motherfucka slams. I hate to say it but it
probably make the loot I think it deserves because there's no song on here
that will really have that much mass appeal even though G'z around the way
like "Bring The Pain". Method Man is his usually wild self dropping bombs
for the earlobes while the RZA handle the WuTang style of production. This
reason is the reason I like it and the reason it won't go gold (to me any-
way) but maybe that's good cuz I'm tired of toys thinking they down when they
pick up a little flavor. There are a lot of joints on here that are dope
especially "Meth vs Chef" Raekwon & Meth go at it in verbal mortal kombat,
"Mr. Sandman" the Wu get bizilly!, "All I Need" for the Earths out there, and
of course "Tical" what's that shit you smoking? Yeah that's the flav. Anywayz
you can't lose buying this especially if you like the WuTang flavor.

        RATING: * * * * (4/5) Slamming!

        Double L here enough with the intro...                                         
        
        "Carlito's Way" - Another movie with Al Pacino as a Hispanic gangsta
and yes I like this one too. Anywayz, Al is Carlito, a former heroin dealer       
and killer, who gets out of jail on a technicality and decides to go straight.
His plan is to make some loot, and open a car rental place in the Bahamas I
think it was. He ends up not making getting shot and the movie goes back from
when he left court to when he got shot. This flick had some fat ass scenes 
especially when he had a shootout in this bar or whatever and ran out of
bullets. It gets a little lame with his love story with an old flame but
it's a straight flick if you haven't seen it. (I've had the tape a hundred
times but never got to completely watch the whole movie for one reason or
another. Damn company! :) ) But peep the Puerto Rican honey in Carlito's
that talks to him after he meets Benny Blanco from the Bronx. She's fucking
slammin and I'd hit that before the broad Carlito had!!! 

        RATING: * * * * (4/5) Slammin!

        "Drop Zone" - Another action flick with Wesley Snipes. This ain't too
bad I just had the problem with the plot. It went by too damn fast. The 
action scenes are good and the skydiving scenes almost make you want to go do
that shit! (Yeah right!). Back to the plot, Wesley is a US Marshall who's
escorting a prisoner on a airplane. The bad guys hijack the plane kidnap the
prisoner, whose a computer genius, and jump off the plane. In the meantime,
they kill Wesley brother,also a US Marshall, who falls from the plane. 
(Ouch!) The rest you watch. The movie is OK but I'd wait til the $1 show or
it comes on video.

        RATING: * * * (3/5) Good.

        "House of Buggin" - I watched the premier episode of the new FOX show
starring John ? well "Benny Blanco" from Carlito's Way. It's kinda like an
Hispanic In Living Color. The skit they did with Koji and little known
siblings of famous people was kinda funny. (Rosie Perez and Gregory Hines 
were the targets. They did Rosie wrong!) They one about illegal alien
makeover was OK. The one with the three chicks singing I didn't really watch
cuz I had company. (Damn company! :) ) From what I saw in the first show,
it'll be OK as long as John doesn't dance. God Damn I though he was white
after the opening of the show.

        RATING: * * * (3/5) Good.

FEMA File #5:

FEMA's structure for fascist rule

By Kathleen Klenetsky and Herbert Quinde

"You have an authoritarian structure. . .with FEMA."

--Harold Relyea, chief specialist on presidential directives at the
Congressional Research Service, in an interview with EIR.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency was founded during the
presidency of one Trilateral Commission member, Jimmy Carter, and it
seems increasingly likely that its fundamental purpose -- to seize
control of the reins of government through emergency fiat -- will be
realized under the presidency of another, George Bush.

The Trilateral link is no accident. Together with the other leading
Eastern Establishment think tank, the New York Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR), the Trilateral Commission effectively brought FEMA
into existence.

The leading theoreticians behind the creation of FEMA were Samuel
Huntington, a National Security Council consultant under Carter, and
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as Carter's national security advisor.
Before that, Brzezinski was executive director at the Trilateral
Commission, a "New Ager" who envisioned a "technetronic society" in
the United States. Nominally a Democrat, Brzezinski nevertheless
became a leading adviser on strategic policy to George Bush's 1988
campaign, and continues to serve as an informal consultant to the Bush
administration. Huntington is currently a member of the FEMA Advisory
Board. Both Huntington and Brzezinski belong to the CFR.

FEMA was established in March 1979 by presidential Review Memorandum
32, with the mandate to maintain "the continuity of government" (COG)
during a national security emergency. PRM 32 bypassed the U.S.
Constitution, and awarded power to the _unelected_ officials at the
National Security Council to direct U.S. government operations by
emergency decree. By placing FEMA under the NSC's control, Huntington,
Brzezinski, et al., turning the NSC into a shadow technocratic
dictatorship, waiting for a real or manufactured crisis to seize
control of the country.

Although FEMA was sold to Congress and the public as the vehicle
through which the United States could mount an adequate, centralized
response to natural and other disasters, the agency has consistently
failed to fulfill that purpose. In its last major interventions, in
1989's San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo, FEMA's ineptness
and bungling enraged disaster victims and local officials. FEMA was
more interested in psychologically profiling the population's response
to the disasters, than it was in assisting their physical survival.
That was typical of FEMA's 10-year record, which began with its
panic-mongering handling of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in
1979.

Burying the Constitution
////////////////////////

FEMA has proven by it's own actions that it is not a disaster
preparedness agency. Its true purpose is found in the 1970s policy
decisions of the CFR and the Trilateral Commission, decisions which
ushered in the "post-industrial society" and "limits to growth" era
which brought the United States into the current depression.

It is clear from viewing these policy decisions, that the
Establishment had made a conscious decision to deal with economic
contraction and concomitant social unrest by resorting to fascist
emergency rule and other forms of "fascism with a democratic face."

In one of the earliest Trilateral Commission reports, "The Crisis of
Democracy," published in 1975, Huntington demanded that democratic
government be curbed in times of economic crisis. "We have come to
recognize that there are potentially desirable limits to economic
growth," he stated. "There are also potentially desirable _limits to
the indefinite extension of political democracy_. . . . A government
which lacks authority. . .will have little ability, short or
cataclysmic crisis to _impose on its people the sacrifice which may be
necessary_" (emphasis added).

In 1973, the Council of Foreign Relations launched its "1980s
Project," which it called the "largest single effort in our 55-year
history." By its own account, the 1980s Project was aimed at
"describing how world trends might be steered toward a particular
desirable future outcome." Zbigniew Brzezinski belonged to the 1980s
Project's governing body, and Samuel Huntington served on its
coordinating group.

Among the most important products of the project was _Alternatives to
Monetary Disorder_, by the late Fred Hirsch, senior adviser to the
International Monetary Fund. Hirsch wrote: "A degree of controlled
disintegration in the world of economy is a legitimate objective for
the 1980s and may be order. A central normative problem for the
international economic order in the years ahead is how to ensure that
the disintegration indeed occurs in a controlled way and does not
rather spiral into damaging restrictionism."

"Controlled disintegration" became the policy of Jimmy Carter's
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, whose high interest rates
wrecked the U.S. industrial and farm base during the Carter and Reagan
years.

Another Key 1980s Project document was _International Disaster
Relief_, by Stephen Green. It predicted that the future will bring
about "megadisasters" that will "create conditions of political
instability and, in all likelihood, of conflict, which will further
erode the capacity of societies to cope with natural disasters."

Green recommended rapid implementation of new disaster preparedness
efforts. He called for the creation of a central, global agency, under
the United Nations, with a mandate to intervene in disaster
situations, despite opposition from local governments. "Such a shift,"
he wrote, "would reflect increasingly widespread _dissatisfaction with
the constraints posed by the recognition of sovereign national
jurisdictions" and the "abstract notion of national sovereignty"
(emphasis added).

"Disaster relief" thus became an excuse for tossing out existing forms
of government which stand in the way of fascist economic policies (for
which "sacrifice" and "controlled disintegration" are merely
euphemisms) which the Eastern Establishment has decided must be
imposed.

Oliver North and FEMA
/////////////////////

FEMA's powers have been enhanced during the Reagan and Bush
administrations to the point that the agency is now positioned to take
over the country in the event of a national security crisis, such as a
war with Iraq or an interruption of oil-imports.

A preview of FEMA dictatorship can be found in the Iran-Contra affair.
One of the key components of the FEMA apparatus is a group of 100
persons it has positioned throughout the government bureaucracy. Known
as the "continuity of government" (COG) structure, these 100
individuals are charged with running government departments in times
of crisis. One member of this group was none other than Oliver North
-- whom President Bush called a "national hero."

Bush was at the center of both the Iran-Contra fiasco, and the broader
FEMA-linked crisis management apparatus set up during the Reagan
years. In early 1982, Reagan created the Special Situations Group
(SSG), designating Vice President Bush as chairman.

In May 1982, the Reagan administration is sued a memorandum which
announced that the SSG "is charged, _inter alia_ with formulating
plans in anticipation of crisis. In order to facilitate this crisis
pre-planned responsibility, a Standing Crisis Pre-Planning Group
(CPPG) is hereby established."

North was assigned to the CPPG -- and later helped to write the 1984
"Rex" exercise for police-state rule in the United States.

Through an outgrowth of this structure, the Iran-Contra controllers
wielded extraordinary power and ran various foreign and domestic
initiates, including the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos of
the Philippines through what became the Project Democracy apparatus,
the Iran-Contra affair, and the government's effort to jail Lyndon
LaRouche, who was rightly seen as a major threat to the FEMA network's
"government by fiat" scheme. (As EIR has previously reported, Buster
Horton, the foreman of the jury which found LaRouche guilty on
trumped-up charges in December 1988, belonged to the same 100-man COG
structure as North.)

On July 22, 1982, President Reagan issued his National Security
Decision Directive 47 to complement the operations of the SSG and
CPPG. Titled "Emergency Mobilization Preparedness," NSDD 47 defined
the responsibilities of federal departments and branches of the U.S.
government to respond to a national security crisis or domestic
emergency. The president charged the Emergency Mobilization
Preparedness Board with implementing the programs detailed in the
directive, which included a restriction of civil rights, bordering on
explicit police-state measures (see accompanying article --
"12656.TXT").

As one of his first acts in office, Bush issued National Security
Directive 1, which boosted the powers of the National Security
Council, the body that runs FEMA.

Bush also stacked the FEMA leadership with "old boys" from the
intelligence and covert operations networks, among them Jerry
Jennings, who was confirmed as a FEMA deputy director in May.
Jenning's background includes nearly a decade of White House service
as an advisor to the President's national security adviser under four
administrations, beginning in 1973. Before that, he worked with the
CIA in the Far East during the gear up for the Vietnam War (1965-68),
and for the FBI, where he specialized in drugs.

    Date: 31 May 92 14:38:33 GMT

To the Editor(of my local paper):

Several Presidents have signed the following Executive
Orders(EOs) which can be put into effect by President Bush
without Congressional approval in the event of a national
emergency:

EO10995 provides for government control of all communications media.

EO10997 provides for government control of all power, fuels and minerals.

EO10998 provides for government control of all food and farms.

EO10999 provides for government control of all transportation,
highways, seaports, etc.

EO11000 provides for the mobilization of all civilians into work
brigades under government supervision.

EO11001 provides for government control of all Health, Education
and Welfare activities.

EO11002 authorizes the Postmaster General to operate a national
registration of all persons.

EO11003 provides for government control of all airports and aircraft.

EO11004 provides for relocation of any populations.

EO11005 provides for government control of railroads, waterways
and public storage facilities.

E011490 combined all of the above Executive Orders and puts all
of them into use simultaneously if a NATIONAL Emergency is
declared.

On July 11, 1990, the U.S. Senate passed the "Omnibus Anti-Crime
Bill", part of which is contained in the GINGRICH ANTI-CRIME BILL
HR4079. This bill, if enacted, would permit use of the above-
listed previously signed Executive Orders to establish nation-
wide martial law, completely suspending all rights and liberties
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The Gingrich Anti-Crime Bill HR4079 called for "A Declaration of
NATIONAL Drug and Crime Emergency". It would be in effect for 5
years. The federal government would use the National Guard to
force compliance with the activated EOs. This would come as a
complete surprise to almost all citizens and the National Guard
personnel.

This Bill, HR4079, has been referred to the House Committees on
Judiciary, Energy and Commerce, Public Works, Transportation,
Education and Labor and Armed Services. The passage of the
Gingrich Anti-Crime Bill HR4079 would permit the suspension of
Constitutional government in the U.S. with one stroke of the
President's pen.

This kind of legislation is what the War on Drugs has led to. The
Drug Threat is considered so severe that the Constitution must be
suspended to deal with it. Does anyone think that these Draconian
measures can be justified by anything less than a meteor impact
on the North American continent? Does anyone think that such a
state of emergency, once declared, would ever be completely
repealed? Individual rights as we know them today will cease to
exist after such an event. "The living", as Krushchev once said
about the survivors of nuclear war, "will envy the dead".

Do you trust President Bush (or any President) with that kind of
power? Call or write your Congressperson and Senators and demand
the defeat of any legislation containing ideas from HR4079. Also
insist on the repeal of all of the above Executive Orders to
prevent the establishment of a totalitarian government in the
United States on the whim of a President.

"The entire thrust of the Republican Whitehouse for the past 12 years
has been to ignore laws passed by Congress and to break secretly whatever
laws impede the implementation of Whitehouse policy. Dan Quayle is the
latest example." - me

FEMA File #7:



                             INTRODUCTION: URGENT!


                   On July 5, 1987 the front page of the Miami Herald
         Newspaper carried a now famous article describing secret
         White House plans to:

         A.) DECLARE AN UNDEFINED "NATIONAL EMERGENCY,"

         B.) RE-OPEN CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR PREVENTIVE
                   DETENTION OF LEGAL DISSIDENTS CERTAIN ETHNIC
                   GROUPS, AND

         C.) SUSPEND OUR UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION

                                   ---***---

                   Those of us viewing the Iran-Contragate hearings,
         then being broadcast live on TV, had our curiousity peaked
         when one committee member began inquiring about an article
         alleging secret White House plans to suspend the
         Constitution.

                   We were even more puzzled when committee chair
         Daniel Inouye interrupted him demanding all discussion on
         that question take place in closed session, out of public
         hearing.

                   Not content to wonder, I researched the original
         article, transcribed it, and now present it to you for your
         urgent consideration. You have a right to read this. In
         fact, you'd better know about it because it's about secret
         White House plans to remove your rights by SUSPENDING OUR
         UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. It's about a government which
         we, the people, did NOT elect but which has gained power
         nonetheless.

                   What follows is not the whole story but a crucial
         and overlooked part of it. Read "between the lines" and
         very carefully. This is not some paranoid's nightmare or
         some fanatic's fantasy. This is reality in the Reagan White
         House.

                                   ---***---

                   Please copy this article and circulate it among
         your friends and co-workers. If George Bush gets into the
         White House, we'll have "elected," or had selected for us,
         precisely the same carnivorous crew comprising The Secret
         Government referred to in this article.

                                   ---***---

                   First, I offer three appropriate quotes which
         provide a certain perspective in which to view what follows.
                   Then, I present the "sidebar" articles which
         summarized and accompanied the main article.
                   Finally, I give you the complete text of the
         original article, unedited and uncensored. While local
         papers ignored this historic article or presented only
         extracts from it, none of them gave you this, the entire
         text.

                                   ---***---

                   The following did not appear with the original
         article but they provide a certain appropriate perspective
         on it:

                      "Perception of reality is sometimes
                      more important than reality itself."

                "He who controls the past, controls the future.
                 He who controls the present, controls the past."

           from THE MIAMI HERALD....SUNDAY JULY 5, 1987....page one:


                             SOME SECRET ACTIVITIES

                   Sources say the parallel government behind the
                   Reagan administration engaged in secret actions
                   including:

         A CONTINGENCY plan to suspend Constitution and impose
                   martial law in United States in case of nuclear
                   war or national rebellion.

         1985 VISIT to Libya by William Wilson, then U.S. ambassador
                   to Vatican and close Reagan friend, to meet with
                   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.

         HAVING ROUTES of sophisticated surveillance satellites
                   altered to follow Soviet ships around world.

         LAUNCHING of spy aircraft on secret missions over Cuba and
                   Nicaragua.

         PROPOSAL in 1981 to provide covert support of anti-
                   Sandinista groups that fled Nicaragua after
                   Sandinista revolution in 1979.

         DISSEMINATION of information that cast Nicaragua as threat
                   to neighbors and United States.

                                   ---***---

                   Before Reagan was elected, campaign aides who
                   became the president's top advisers carried out
                   these secret activities:

                    REAGAN AIDES AND THE 'SECRET' GOVERNMENT

                  by ALFONSO CHARDY, HERALD WASHINGTON BUREAU


                   WASHINGTON -- Some of President Reagan's top
         advisers have operated a virtual parallel government outside
         the traditional Cabinet departments and agencies almost from
         the day Reagan took office, congressional investigators and
         administration officials have concluded.

                   Investigators believe that the advisers'
         activities extended well beyond the secret arms sales to
         Iran and aid to the contras now under investigation.

                   Lt. Col. Oliver North, for example, helped draw up
         a controversial plan to suspend the Constitution in the
         event of a national crisis, such as nuclear war, violent and
         widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S.
         military invasion abroad.

                   When the attorney general at the time, William
         French Smith, learned of the proposal, he protested in
         writing to North's boss, then-national security adviser
         Robert McFarlane.

                   The advisers conducted their activities through
         secret contacts throughout the government with persons who
         acted at their direction but did not officially report to
         them.

                   The activities of those contacts were coordinated
         by the National Security Council, the officials and
         investigators said.

                    There appears to have been no formal directive for
         the advisers' activities, which knowledgeable sources
         described as a parallel government.

                   In a secret assessment of the activities, the lead
         counsel for the Senate Iran-contra committee called it a
         "secret government-within-a-government."

                   The arrangement permitted Reagan administration
         officials to claim that they were not involved in
         controversial or illegal activities, the officials said.

                   "It was the ultimate plausible deniability," said
         a well-briefed official who has served the Reagan
         administration since 1982 and who often collaborated on
         covert assistance to the Nicaraguan contras.

                   The roles of top-level officials and of Reagan
         himself are still not clear. But that is expected to be a
         primary topic when North appears before the Iran-contra
         committees beginning Tuesday. Special prosecutor Lawrence
         Walsh also is believed to be trying to prove in his
         investigation of the Iran-contra affair that government
         officials engaged in a criminal conspiracy.


                 ADVISERS FORMED SHADOW GOVERNMENT, PROBERS SAY

                   Much of the time, Cabinet secretaries and their
         aides were unaware of the advisers' activities. When they
         periodically detected operations, they complained or tried
         to derail them, interviews show.

                   But no one ever questioned the activities in a
         broad way, possibly out of a belief that the advisers were
         operating with presidential
         sanction, officials said.

                   Reagan did know of or approve at least some of the
         actions of the secret group, according to previous accounts
         by aides, friends and high-ranking foreign officials.

                   One such case is the 1985 visit to Libya by
         William Wilson, then-U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and a
         close Reagan friend, to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
         Gadhafi, officials said last week. Secretary of State
         George Shultz rebuked Wilson, but the officials said Reagan
         knew of the trip in advance.

                   The heart of the secret structure from 1983 to
         1986 was North's office in the Old Executive Office Building
         adjacent to the White House, investigators believe.

                   North's influence within the secret structure was
         so great, the sources said, that he was able to have the
         orbits of sophisticated surveillance satellites altered to
         follow Soviet ships around the world, call for the launching
         of high-flying spy aircraft on secret missions over Cuba and
         Nicaragua and become involved in sensitive domestic
         activities.


                                Many initiatives

                   Others in the structure included some of Reagan's
         closest friends and advisers, including former national
         security adviser William Clark, the late CIA Director
         William Casey and Attorney General Edwin Meese, officials
         and investigators said.

                   Congressional investigators said the Iran deal was
         just one of the group's initiatives. They say exposure of
         the unusual arrangement may be the legacy of their inquiry.

                   "After we establish that a policy decision was
         made at the highest levels to transfer responsibility for
         contra support to the NSC..., we favor examining how that
         decision was implemented," wrote Arthur Liman, chief counsel
         of the Senate committee, in a secret memorandum to panel
         leaders Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Warren Rudman, R-
         N.H., before hearings began May 5.

                   "This is the part of the story that reveals the
         whole secret government-within-a-government, operated from
         the [Executive Office Building] by a Lt. Col., with its own
         army, air force, diplomatic agents, intelligence operatives
         and appropriations capacity," Limon wrote in the memo, parts
         of which were shared with The Herald.

                   A spokesman for Liman declined comment but did not
         dispute the memo's existence.

                   A White House official rejected the notion that
         any of Reagan's advisers were operating secretly.

                   "The president has constantly expressed his
         foreign policy positions to the public and has consulted
         with the Congress," the official said.


                                 Began in 1980

                   Congressional investigators and current and former
         officials interviewed -- members of the CIA, State
         Department and Pentagon -- said they still do not have a
         full record of the impact of the the advisers' activities.

                   But based on investigations and personal
         experience, they believe the secret governing arrangement
         traces its roots to the last weeks of Reagan's 1980
         campaign.

                   Officials say the genesis may have been an October
         1980 decision by Casey, Reagan's campaign manager and a
         former officer in the World War II precursor of the CIA, to
         create an October Surprise Group to monitor Jimmy Carter's
         feverish negotiations with Iran for the release of 52
         American hostages.

                   The group, led by campaign foreign policy adviser
         Richard Allen, was founded out of concern Carter might pull
         off an "October surprise" such as a last-minute deal for the
         release of the hostages before the Nov. 4 election. One of
         the group's first acts was a meeting with a man claiming to
         represent Iran who offered to release the hostages to
         Reagan.

                   Allen -- Reagan's first national security adviser--
          and another campaign aide, Laurence Silberman, told The
         Herald in April of the meeting. they said McFarlane, then a
         Senate Armed Services Committee aide, arranged and attended
         it. McFarlane later became Reagan's national security
         adviser and played a key role in the Iran-contra affair.
         Allen and Silberman said they rejected the offer to release
         the hostages to Reagan.


                              Briefing book theft

                   Congressional aides now link another well-known
         campaign incident -- the theft of confidential briefing
         materials from Carter's campaign before the Oct. 28, 1980,
         Carter-Reagan debate -- to the same group of advisers.

                   They believe that Casey obtained the briefing
         materials and passed them to James Baker, another top
         Reagan campaign aide, who was White House chief of staff in
         Reagan's first term.

                   Once Reagan was sworn in, the group moved quickly
         to set itself up, officials said. Within months, the
         advisers were clashing with officials in the traditional
         agencies.

                   Six weeks after Reagan was sworn in, apparently
         over State Department objections, then-CIA director Casey
         submitted a proposal to Reagancalling for covert support of
         anti-Sandinista groups that had fled Nicaragua after the
         1979 revolution.


                         [THE IRAN-CONTRA CONNECTION:
             NORTH HAD BIG ROLE IN INNER CIRCLE, INVESTIGATORS SAY]

                   It is still unclear whether Casey cleared the plan
         with Reagan. But In November 1981 the CIA secretly flew an
         Argentine military leader, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, to
         Washington to devise a secret agreement under which
         Argentine military officers trained Nicaraguan rebels,
         according to an administration official familiar with the
         agreement.

                   About the same time, North completed his transfer
         to the NSC from the Marine Corps. Those who worked with
         North in 1981 remember his first assignments as routine,
         although not unimportant.

                   North, they recalled, was briefly assigned to
         carry the "football," the briefcase containing the secret
         contingency plans for fighting a nuclear war, which is taken
         everywhere the president goes. North later widened his
         assignment to cover national crisis contingency planning.
         In that capacity he became involved with the controversial
         national crisis plan drafted by the Federal Emergency
         Management Agency.


                              NATIONAL CRISIS PLAN

                   From 1982 to 1984, North assisted FEMA, the U.S.
         government's chief national crisis-management unit, in
         revising contingency plans for dealing with nuclear war,
         insurrection or massive military mobilization.

                   North's involvement with FEMA set off the first
         major clash between the official government and the advisers
         and led to the formal letter of protest in 1984 from then-
         Attorney General Smith.

                   Smith was in Europe last week and could not be
         reached for comment.

                   But a government official familiar with North's
         collaboration with FEMA said then-Director Louis O.
         Guiffrida, a close friend of Meese's, mentioned North in
         meetings during that time as FEMA's NSC contact.

                   Guiffrida could not be reached for comment, but
         FEMA spokesman Bill McAda confirmed the relationship.

                   "Officials of FEMA met with Col. North during 1982
         to 1984," McAda said. "These meetings were appropriate to
         Col. North's duties with the National Security Council and
         FEMA's responsibilities in certain areas of national
         security."

                   FEMA's clash with Smith occurred over a secret
         contingency plan that called for suspension of the
         Constitution, turning control of the United States over to
         FEMA, appointment of military commanders to run state and
         local governments and declaration of martial law during a
         national crisis.

                   The plan did not define national crisis, but it
         was understood to be nuclear war, violent and widespread
         internal dissent or national opposition against a military
         invasion abroad.


                               PLAN WAS PROTESTED

                   The official said the contingency plan was written
         as part of an executive order or legislative package that
         Reagan would sign and hold within the NSC until a severe
         crisis arose.

                   The martial law portions of the plan were outlined
         in a June 30, 1982, memo by Guiffrida's deputy for national
         preparedness programs, John Brinkerhoff. A copy of the memo
         was obtained by The Herald.

                   The scenario outlined in the Brinkerhoff memo
         resembled somewhat a paper Guiffrida had written in 1970 at
         the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., in which he advocated
         martial law in case of a national uprising by black
         militants. The paper also advocated the roundup and
         transfer to "assembly centers or relocation camps" of at
         least 21 million "American Negroes."

                   When he saw the FEMA plans, Attorney General Smith
         became alarmed. He dispatched a letter to McFarlane Aug. 2,
         1984 lodging his objections and urging a delay in signing
         the directive.

                   "I believe that the role assigned to the Federal
         Emergency Management Agency in the revised Executive Order
         exceeds its proper function as a coordinating agency for
         emergency preparedness," Smith said in the letter to
         McFarlane, which The Herald obtained. "This department and
         others have repeatedly raised serious policy and legal
         objections to the creation of an 'emergency czar' role for
         FEMA."

                   It is unclear whether the executive order was
         signed or whether it contained the martial law plans.
         Congressional sources familiar with national disaster
         procedures said they believe Reagan did sign an executive
         order in 1984 that revised national military mobilization
         measures to deal with civilians in case of nuclear war or
         other crisis.


                            ORCHESTRATED NEWS LEAKS

                   Around the time that issue was producing fireworks
         with the administration, McFarlane and Casey reassigned
         North from national crisis planning to international covert
         management of the contras. The transfer came after North
         took a personal interest, realizing that neither the State
         Department nor any other government agency wanted to handle
         the issue after it became clear early in 1984 that Congress
         was moving to bar official aid to the rebels.

                   The new assignment, plus North's natural
         organizational ability, creativity and the sheer energy he
         dedicated to the issue, gradually led to an expansion of his
         power and stature within the covert structure, officials and
         investigators believe.

                   Meese also was said to have played a role in the
         secret government, investigators now believe, but his role
         is less clear.

                   Meese sometimes referred private American citizens
         to the NSC so they could be screened and contacted for
         soliciting support for the Nicaraguan contras.

                   One of those supporters, Philip Mabry of Fort
         Worth, told The Herald earlier this year that in 1983 he was
         told by fellow conservatives in Texas to contact Meese, then
         White House counselor, if he wanted to help the contras.
         After he contacted Meese's office, Mabry received a letter
         from Meese obtained by The Herald advising him that his name
         had been given to the "appropriate people."

                   Shortly thereafter, Mabry said, a woman who
         identified herself as Meese's secretary gave him the name
         and phone number of another NSC secretary who, in turn, gave
         him North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, as contacts.

                   Meese's Justice Department spokesman, Patrick
         Korten, denies that Meese was part of North's secret contra
         supply network and notes that Meese does not recall having
         referred anyone to North on contra-related matters.

                   In addition to North's role as contra commander
         and fund-raiser, North became secret overseer of the State
         Department's Office of PublicDiplomacy, through which the
         Reagan administration disseminated information that cast
         Nicaragua as a threat to its neighbors and the United
         States.

                   An intelligence source familiar with North's
         relationship with that office said North was directly
         involved in many of the best publicized news leaks,
         including the Nov. 4, 1984, Election Day announcement that
         Soviet-made MiG jet fighters were on their way to Nicaragua.

                   McFarlane is now believed to have been the senior
         administration official who told reporters that the Soviet
         cargo ship Bakuriani, en route to Nicaragua from a Soviet
         Black Sea port, was  probably carrying MiGs.

                   The intelligence official said North apparently
         recommended that the information be leaked to the press on
         Election Day so it would reach millions of people watching
         election results. CBS and NBC broadcast the report that
         night.


                               CLARK HAD KEY ROLE

                   The leak led to a new clash between the regular
         bureaucracy and the president's advisers. The official
         State Department spokesman, John Hughes, tried hard to play
         down the report, pointing out that it was unproven that the
         Bakuriani was carrying MiGs. At the same time, employees of
         the Office of Public Diplomacy, acting under North's
         direction, insisted that the crates were inside the ship and
         that MiGs were still a possibility.

                   To take a closer look, the source said, North
         requested a high-flying SR-71 Blackbird spy aircraft be sent
         from Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., to fly
         over the Nicaraguan port of Corinto while the Bakuriani
         unloaded its cargo. The pictures showed that the Bakuriani
         unloaded helicopters, not MiGs.

                   North was not the only adviser who operated
         outside traditional government channels, investigators have
         concluded.

                   Others were known as the RIGLET, a semi-official
         unit made up of North; Alan Fiers, a CIA Central American
         affairs officer; and Elliott Abrams, the current assistant
         secretary of state for inter-American affairs, according to
         Abrams' subordinate Richard Melton. Melton revealed the
         existence of the RIGLET in a deposition given to the Iran-
         contra committees. The name is a diminutive for RIG, which
         stands for Restricted Interagency Group.

                   Among the RIGLET's actions was ordering the U.S.
         ambassador to Costa Rica, Lewis Tambs, to assist the contras
         in setting up a front in southern Nicaragua. Tambs, who
         resigned suddenly last year after his links to North were
         revealed, testified about the instructions to Iran-contra
         investigators.

                   But perhaps the key to the parallel government was
         the role played by Reagan's second national security
         adviser, William Clark. It was during Clark's tenure that
         North began to gain influence in the NSC.

                   Clark also recruited several midlevel officers
         from the Pentagon and the CIA to work on a special Central
         American task force in 1983 to push aid for El Salvador, a
         task force member said.

                   "Judge Clark was the granddaddy of the system," he
         said. "I was working at the Pentagon on another issue when
         my boss said that because of special circumstances, I was to
         be reassigned to the task force."

                   A former administration official familiar with
         Clark's activities said Clark also had approved contacts
         between Vatican Ambassador Wilson and Libya before Wilson's
         November 1985 journey, which came after McFarlane replaced
         Clark at the NSC.

                   The former official said Wilson also had carried
         out secret missions for the Reagan administration in a Latin
         American country where Wilson reportedly maintained contacts
         with high-level officials. The source asked that the
         country not be identified because the system is still in
         place and had reduced tensions by circumventing the regular
         bureaucracies of both countries.

                   Calls to Wilson's and Clark's offices in
         California were not returned.

U.S. PREPARATIONS FOR MARTIAL LAW
Transcript of a talk given by officer Jack McLamb (retired) of
the Phoenix Police Department.

Biographical note: Officer McLamb was one of the most highly
decorated members (if not *the* most highly decorated) of the
Phoenix Police Department. Besides many acts of heroism, officer
McLamb is also the originator of the "Officer Friendly" program,
a program in which police officers visit school children to help
them be better acquainted with the police. Officer McLamb was
disabled in the line of duty and is now retired from the Phoenix
Police Department. He currently hosts a radio show which can be
heard Monday through Friday, 7 pm cst, on WWCR, 5.810 mHz
shortwave.

JACK MCLAMB: Well it's so good to be here with you this morning.
Let me tell you, it's *real* good to be with you this morning. I
had a rather bad day, yesterday. I apologize for missing my
appointed duties last night, to some of you that came last night
to hear the gun rights talk. But I'll tell you, I was fortunate
to have someone that knows more about gun rights, and about law
enforcement, than even *I* do. Officer Rick Dalton was here last
night and took my place. Some of you were able to attend the gun
rights talk and the panel. And I'm sure officer Dalton did a
marvellous job. Because he spends a great deal of his time
studying the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and how that
interplays with law enforcement in our country today.

I want to say that, you know, since I was disabled from the
Phoenix Police Department, I've had some good days and bad days.
But, you know, it all depends on how you look at things -- your
perspective and your belief system -- as to how you look at those
times when you may be sick. There may be some people in the
audience -- I know there's a person here -- that has a disability
also. That I've talked to. And some days you have that you're not
really able to perform like other days. But the wonderful thing
about it is, that some of my best inspiration and my best time to
think and commune with God, has been when I've been down.

How about some of you? You know what I'm talkin' about? When
you're down and you're not feelin' well, when you just have to be
*still* and you just have to be *quiet* -- some of your best
communications go on at that time.

And so, so it was yesterday. I am so pleased because, for about a
year now, I have been perplexed about how to follow up, and the
other officers that help me have been perplexed how to follow up,
with Operation Vampire Killer II. {1}. And we'd been wondering
what to follow up with this publication we put out last year
under the new police organization, Police Against the New World
Order.

Well yesterday, it came to me. And I'm just thrilled to death
because we've been struggling with what to do as a follow-up for
officers that are today reading that publication and passing it
all over this nation -- as a matter of fact, to many foreign
nations.

Some of you don't... probably don't know what I'm talking about.
But this publication, Operation Vampire Killer 2000, that the
Police Against the New World Order put out last year, is
literally sweeping law enforcement across this nation and
sweeping the military at the same time. Because, for some reason
we were blessed by being able to put in, down on paper, exactly
what was happening to America and the rest of the world; and what
part the military is playing, and what part law enforcement is
playing, to bring about this New "Utopian" World Order that Bush,
Clinton and Perot are pushing. {2}.

Well, we were very pleased with the success of that manual [i.e.
Operation Vampire Killer 2000]. I talked with an officer here
this morning, with the Phoenix Police Department, a personal
friend of mine for many, many years. And he talked about the
success of it in the Phoenix Police Department. He talked about
the lieutenants and the management people that were reading it
and are ready to help the American people regain their freedoms
and liberties. He said that he's been handing it out to so many
officers, and other officers are handing it out to each other,
that he went out to his mailbox the other day and he's got one in
his own mailbox! [laughs] That's a great sign. That's a great
sign.

And we also have officers reporting back, now, saying that they
asked officers, "Have they ever heard of Operation Vampire Killer
2000, or officer Jack McLamb, or the American Citizen and Lawmen
Association, or Aid & Abet Police Newsletter." And we're finding
now that it seems like about 1 in 10, or 1 in 8, is kind of where
we're falling, of the officers that are reporting, "Yes. I've
heard about it." 1 in 10, or 1 in 8. Somewhere in that
neighborhood.

So this is wonderful! I tell you, because it means officers are
beginning to get what one of our nationally known old fellas on
radio said, "The other side of the story," "The rest of the
story." Right? And so we're really pleased. And we want to thank
all of you in the audience here, too, that have taken that
manual, duplicated it or bought more from Police Against the New
World Order, and handed it out to police officers and soldiers
around the country.

Now this morning, we're going to touch on a subject that is...
Actually, it's the most vital subject to our nation's recovery
that we could talk about. And that is, the thing that is actually
causing the American people to gravitate towards a socialist, a
totalitarian, type of government in our nation. It's the subject
that causes the American people, as a whole, to want to give up
some of their rights so that the government can "save" them from
the problems that abound in our nation today.

Edwin Meese made a statement back in 1980. Edwin Meese said, at
that time, he says, "I think..." (Now Edwin Meese... Let me
explain: He's the attorney general under President Reagan. Now he
was one of those that was working towards a global government.)
And he said very piously, in 1980, that "I think now the American
people are ready to give up some of their Bill of Rights so that
we can do something about the drug and crime problem in America."
Now I don't know who told him that. I didn't. Did any of you tell
him that?

But he's right, to a great extent, is he not? There are many
people who do not know what is happening in America that *are*
ready, at the suggestion of their government, to "just give up
the 2nd amendment," "just give up the 1st amendment," "just give
up the 4th amendment," and the other parts of the Bill of Rights,
and we'll "take care of" you. We will make you "safe", we will
make you "peaceful".

And indeed, there is a lot of Americans that have fallen for that
game.

Now to start off this morning (because I see a lot of new faces),
I'm going to read a couple quotes. Because, we have law
enforcement people in the audience today that are brand new to
what we're talking about here at the expo: And that is
preparedness for the times that are coming in the future, and
possibly the near future.

And so, I wanted to start off with a couple quotes for you, to be
sure that... Uh, we have some good officers all over here. I
appreciate you coming. We love to have the police officers come
out to our meetings. Let's give a hand to the officers here
today. [applause]

This is so important. And I want to say that, uh I want to talk
to you about a meeting we had in Colorado here, in the
summertime. We had about 500 people in the audience. And I always
like to start out by saying "welcome" to the police officers in
the audience and military people in the audience. Because they
play a pivotal role, they play a pivotal role in what's going to
happen in our nation. Very pivotal. Matter of fact, if the
national guard, the other military, and the police departments,
say "no" to the New World Order, most of youhere probably
realize it can't happen. It cannot happen in America, anyway, if
that were to be so. So that's the thing we're keying in on.

                     [...to be continued...]

--------------------------<< Notes >>----------------------------
{1} As I recall, the etymology for the name "Operation Vampire
Killer" had something to do with a common perception that the New
World Order bunch were sucking the life out of us. Hence the
name, Operation Vampire Killer 2000.

{2} Call me naive, but I don't see Perot as part of the New World
Order plot. Or else, why did he fight so hard against NAFTA?

JACK MCLAMB:
But at the Colorado meeting, in June, we had about 500 people. We
had the sheriff sitting on the front row with a couple of his
deputies. We had a national guardsman sitting beside him. And the
meeting went very well. For an hour I talked, and I forgot to say
"thank you" to the police officers for coming.

So I waited until the end of the meeting, and then it hit me: I
didn't thank the police officers. And so I said, "Oh! We want to
take a moment to thank all of you officers in the audience, that
are here off-duty, for coming to the meeting. And we'd like you
to stand up so we can give you a round of applause and show you
how much we love you and appreciate you."

Well a lot of the officers stood up and we applauded for them.
And then I said (and I do this at every meeting, but this is a
first: what I'm about to tell you about), I said, "Now the
undercover officers that are here," (and we have some here
today), I said, "we love you being here. We wish you'd tell your
boss when you go home that you need 10 times as many undercover
officers back here. Because you guys are trapped. You have to
stay through the whole thing. The other officers can get up and
leave, but you're here on assignment. You've gotta record
everything. You've gotta report back. So we've got you for the
whole meeting. And that's why we love you to be here!" And I
said, "And I want to show you how much we love you. We want the
undercover agents to stand up so we can show you how much we love
you."

And it's totally quiet, right? And all of a sudden, two guys in
business suits stand up, on each side of the aisle, hang their
head like this, and the meeting just broke up. Everybody just
clapping and howling and whistling. [laughs]

But you see, that's the thing. If we can just get these officers
in our meetings to find out that we are not the enemy of America;
that we are actually the salvation of America -- and that is,
God's people turning back to him and turning back to the
foundation of our nation. That God gave us this nation. Then we
are actually the remnant, here, that can cause the recovery! And
we've gotta get the officers in the meetings, don't we? And the
military people and the police officers, federal, state and
local, or they can't find out who we are and what we're all
about!

So anyway, that was very exciting. Another very exciting thing
[that] happened was, we attended, for the first time this year,
and had a booth, at the National Sheriffs Convention, the annual
convention, in Salt Lake City. And we were able to put literature
in the hands of thousands of sheriffs around this country. And we
had a tremendously successful meeting, sharing this type of
information with all the sheriffs we could reach within 3 days,
at the National Sheriffs Convention.

I'm telling you this because I want you to feel what is happening
today, and how successful we're becoming in reaching these very
dedicated, proud, honorable and patriotic Americans in uniform:
the military, and also the police officers. [applause]

I'd better put my disclaimer in here. You see me standing here in
a police uniform. Well I'm retired, now, from the Phoenix Police
Department. After they tried to retire me twice, I finally had to
take a medical retirement because of injuries suffered in the
line of duty. And so I'm wearing this uniform for 2 reasons: I
loved wearing this uniform. I was very proud to wear this
uniform. And also I'm wearing this uniform because they told me I
could not. [laughter] And I paid for it myself, so...

All right. Well, so, I'm gonna read you a couple quotes, for the
new people in the audience, because I want you to understand:
When you hear about President Rodham's new program -- er, I mean
Clinton. I'm sorry. -- for this New "Utopian" World Order... And
you heard President Bush talk about the New World Order. I want
you to understand what we're talking about here.

So here's a couple quotes from people -- you'll recognize their
names. And it's coming from Operation Vampire Killer 2000, the
manual that was put together for police officers to help stop
this new world government rule. And here's what we hit the
officers with on the first few pages. We quote two Prime
Ministers of England.

O.K. Benjamin Disraeli, 1844, he made this statement. He was a
Prime Minister of England, and he said, "The world is governed by
very different personages from what is imagined; by those who are
behind the scenes." 1844. Think about that, how long ago that
was.

Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of England, stated in 1922, he
says, "From the days of Spartacus Wieskoff(?), Karl Marx,
Trotsky, Bella Kuhn(?), Rosen Luxemborg(?) and Emma Goldman, this
world conspiracy..." -- Now who used that word, that the media
laughs about all the time and pooh-poohs all the time? Listen to
this: Winston Churchill used the word "conspiracy". He says,
"...this world conspiracy has been steadily growing. This
conspiracy played a definite, recognizable role in the tragedy of
the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every
subversive movement during the 19th century. And now, at last,
this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of
the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian
people by the hairs of their head and have become the undisputed
masters of that enormous empire."

You see how much he told us in just one paragraph here? He knew
about the conspiracy, in 1922, to rule the world. He also tells
us -- which is true -- that the 1917 revolt, the Bolshevik
revolution, was indeed part of the conspiracy, and it was well
planned by people in America and in Europe! In other words, the
communist government was built up for a reason by Americans --
American internationalists and European internationalists. That's
what Winston Churchill told us.

Now listen to this: One of our Supreme Court justices, Felix
Frankfurter, said, "The real rulers in Washington are invisible
and exercise power from behind the scene."

John Hyland(?), mayor of New York in 1825, said, "The real menace
to our Republic is the invisible government which like a giant
octopus has spread its slimy legs over our cities, states, and
nation."

I could go on. Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- now there's many,
many quotes in here. I'll end with Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He
said, in a letter to Colonel E. Mandell House in 1933 -- and this
is in the [National] Archives, this letter to E. Mandell House --
he says, "The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know,
that a financial element in the large centers has owned the
government of the United States since the days of Andrew
Jackson."

Now. So for any of you sitting in this audience, thinking this is
not for real and we do not have a serious problem in the United
States with conspirators that were named by Presidents, Prime
Ministers, Supreme Court justices, and many others in this manual
-- you're wrong! Because it's real, and we are fighting a real
enemy. We're not fighting at windmills and ghosts and things like
that, like the media today tries to make you think we are.

So that's important. I like to start out this way, because we
have new police officers, new soldiers, and we have new private
citizens here that really come into these meetings and they don't
know what we're about and what we're doing.

JACK MCLAMB:
So that's important. I like to start out this way because we have
new police officers, new soldiers, and we have new private
citizens here that really come into these meetings and they don't
know what we're about and what we're doing.

What does this have to do with Clinton's new plan to bring
together all the law enforcement agencies in the nation? It has
everything to do with it. And so I'm leading into that. People
say, "Well, Jack: Get to the subject!" Well this *is* the
subject! It's very important that we understand *why* Clinton
wants to bring together a national police force. And why there is
an international police force already set up.

And so, in order for us to understand if we do have a conspiracy
to take over the united States and mold us into a world
government -- How are these people going to do this?

And oh, by the way, there's another quote I want to give you,
from the head of the Ford Foundation. Now this is a part of the
Congressional Record. And this is where we'll start into our talk
today about the importance of the national police force.

A man by the name of, uh... uh... Norman Dodd (yeah, thank you,
Ralph. That's my fellow police officer, there. He knows more
about it than I do!) A guy named Norman Dodd was an investigator
for the Reese Commission -- a congressional investigation into
the tax-free foundations of the nation. And he was going about
his duties every week, talking to the heads of the foundations,
the tax-free foundations of the world... er, the nation. And his
duty was to find out why they were there, what their purpose was,
and how they were using their tax-free funds.

Well he was caught totally off-guard when he went to talk to Mr.
Rowen Gaither(?), who was the president of the Ford Foundation,
one morning. He sat down with Mr. Gaither, and he said, "Mr.
Gaither, I'm gonna ask you the same question I've asked all the
other heads of the tax-free foundations. And that is, What is
your purpose? And how are you using your tax-free foundation
funds?"

And he looked at Mr. Dodd, and he said, "Mr. Dodd," he says. (And
this is almost verbatim. I can pretty much quote it verbatim.) He
says, "We operate here out of directives that emanate from the
White House. And the subject of those directives are, we are to
use our grant-making powers to alter life in the united States so
that we can be merged with the Soviet Union."

Well Mr. Dodd about fell out of his chair. Because he had not had
anyone speak to him candidly at all the tax-free foundations he'd
gone to. They didn't want to have him come in the door. They
tried to cover up information. And this is the first one he went
to where Mr. Rowen Gaither, the head of the Ford Foundation,
actually told him what the real reason that they were in business
for.

Now. That was 1954, folks. 1954. Now he says that "Our directives
emanate from the White House." Who was in the White House in
1954? Ike. "I like Ike." -- remember that little sticker? I know
that, because I was born in Washington, D.C. and I went to the
inaugural parade of Eisenhower as a little boy. And I remember: I
was very proud that day to be in Washington, D.C. and attend the
inaugural parade and see the President of the United States.

And I always thought Ike was a nice guy. But now I know
differently, because I've studied history. {1}. But he was the
one, his White House issued the directive to the tax-free
foundations that they were to use their grant-making powers to
alter life in the united States so we could be merged with the
rest of the world.

And now, that is probably the most critical statement I can tell
you today, folks. Don't forget that. Because you're gonna find
out why the economy is falling. You're gonna find out why we're
losing our farms. You're gonna find out in that statement why
we're losing our homes, and why everything in America is just
dissolving. And we are being lowered, in every aspect, from our
Constitutional rights. We're losing our Constitutional rights.
We're losing our economic, our sound economic base. We're losing
*everything* in America. We're being levelled so that we can be
comfortably merged one day with third world nations.

So in that statement... Don't forget that. That's in this book,
too, by the way. In *Vampire Killer*.

All right, now, if they're going to do this, if they're going to
do this, folks, how are they going to do it? How are they going
to do it? And this leads us into "crime" and it leads us into
drugs, in America. And why we "need" a national police force (so
we're told), we "need" a national police force.

How are they going to do it? Let me share it with you. [Pauses
for a drink of water, apparently glances at something] (Here's
another *Operation Vampire Killer 2000*.) And on another page, we
have the way that they're going to destroy our nation and level
it with the rest of the nations, so we can be merged together.

See if you can figure out, now -- in the 1800s, when these
conspirators first put together a serious plan to bring the
united States to its knees -- how they were gonna do it? Now I'm
gonna read you some statements here, by our founding fathers. And
*you* put your place in, self in the place of a conspirator and
you try, out of these statements, to find out the way to destroy
America. And you tell me what it is.

Listen to this: the founding fathers said this: Uh, Benjamin
Franklin said, "Man will ultimately be governed by God or by
tyrants." He's talking about our free nation, nation of free
people. Where does our freedom come from? Benjamin Franklin tells
us.

George Washington says, "The people know it is impossible to
rightly govern without God and the Bible."

Andrew Jackson says, "The Bible is the rock on which our Republic
rests."

Daniel Webster said, "If we abide by the principles taught in the
Bible, our country will go on prospering."

And there's a man, name of Alexis De Tocqueville, who was a
French historian, that came to our country in the 19th century.
And he looked at the American system. Because France wanted to
know why we were so successful and we were growing so rapidly and
our economy was booming. And we were becoming the greatest nation
on the face of the earth. The French wanted to know, so they sent
Alexis De Tocqueville to America to do a 2-year study. And at the
end of that study, this is what he said. He really nailed it down
in just one line. He said, "America is great because America is
good. And if America ever ceases to be good, it will cease to be
great."

                     [...to be continued...]

---------------------------<< Notes >>---------------------------
{1} "...I always thought Ike was a nice guy. But now I know
differently..." One incident that supports this statement is
Eisenhower's participation in the brutal suppression of the so-
called "Bonus Army" in Washington, D.C. in the 1930s.

JACK MCLAMB:
Now think of what the founding fathers said; what made America
great. Now, if you're a conspirator and you're trying to look how
you're gonna destroy this nation, and you now know the foundation
of that nation is its spirituality, its belief in God and the
principles in the Bible -- How are you gonna destroy America? The
founders told you how to destroy it. You've got to get rid of
God. And you've got to get rid of what God gave us to make our
nation free: that's the Bill of Rights.

Now, we're coming to the drug and crime problem. Hold on, O.K.?
All right.

So now we know that they now know how to destroy us; what they
have to destroy. What is one of the first things that happened
back early in this last century? Something called the
evolutionary theory came out, did it not? And this theory swept
throughout our nation like gangbusters. I'm tellin' you, it was
in every school. When I went to school we were taught the
evolutionary theory. (I went to school years ago. And some of you
are older than I am, so you probably got caught up into this
too.)

And I was one of those people that I was raised as a christian by
a christian mother. And my family had taught the principles
taught in the Bible. But when I saw the professors, and I saw the
teachers, who told *me* they were much smarter than my mother --
I didn't have a dad growin' up -- and made me believe they were
much smarter than her, and she had old and antiquated ideas, and
I should learn what the "truth" was and believe in evolution,
then I was caught up with that. And I got away from Scripture and
I got away from the Bible. Because after all, my mother was not
highly educated.

And these great men in these edifices built to man, the
universities {1}, I looked to as my God at that time. And I said,
"I've gotta look at these guys. And if they tell me that 'God is
dead,' that 'God is not real. It's for people that are soft and
people that are steeped in superstitions' and everything, this
must be so."

Well thank God, when I was in the military during the Vietnam
war, someone loved me enough to send me a book. And it proved to
me, from a scientific basis, that evolution is not true at all.

You say, "Well how do you prove that? It can't be proved."

Yes it can. How many of you heard of Dr. Henry Morris? Raise your
hand if you've heard of Dr. Henry Morris. He's one of the
greatest blessings America's ever had. Because he was an atheist
scientist, he was a world-known scientist, and he set out, years
ago, some 30 years ago, to prove that creationism was not true.
And after 2 years study, he became a born-again christian. He
gave his heart to God. And he wrote a book called, *The Troubled
Waters of Evolution*. And here it is. There's that book. That was
the book I was given back when I was in the military; the very
book. I've kept it. It's been around the world several times.
I've given it away to many people and they've, thankfully, given
it back to me.

But Dr. Henry Morris *proved*, and wrote his evidence in here to
prove, creationism. And that little book will prove it to anybody
that'll read. And of course, we're having less and less people in
America that are *able* to read, nowadays, you know. But someone,
one very intelligent man once said, "Those that will not read are
no better off than those that cannot read." So if you've stopped
reading, you're not going to have this educational material that
you need in your life, and so you can pass it on to others.

*The Troubled Waters of Evolution*. I'll have this at my booth.
Dr. Henry Morris started a group of scientists all around this
world. He started a group called "The Creation Research Society"
in San Diego. Years ago, at that time, they had 200 scientists
that had studied his reports and studied his evidence and turned
to God. And now there's over *thousands* of these scientists,
world scientists, who have now turned back to God because they
proved that evolution is a bunch of bunk and creationism has all
the facts and evidence.

I'm bringing this up, see, because the government, this
conspiracy, tried to destroy God in the minds of the American
people. It tried to destroy the principles in which our country
was based, which was the Bible and the Ten Commandments -- which
gave us the Bill of Rights.

So we can recover the hearts and minds of those people like me
that have been, have *lost* that, and caused our country to be
levelled with many of the other nations of the world that were
*not* based on the Bible and God's law.

There's a second part of the conspiracy, however. And it has to
do with this same thing. If they're going to destroy God, they
also have to have a "something else" for people to go into. Now a
lot of people went into the evolutionary, atheist thought. But
others, that were still spirit-filled, in some fashion, had to go
somewhere else. So they created something called the "New Age"
thought. The "New Age".

And this is, I think, worse than the political conspiracy. The
spiritual conspiracy will destroy you faster. You can know all
about the political conspiracy. You can understand everything
about 1917 and how Jacob Schift(?) and others funded Trotsky to
go take 200 street thugs in New York City to Russia and start the
Bolshevik revolution. {2}. You can know all this political
conspiracy and still lose your nation and the world, if you don't
understand the spiritual conspiracy.

Now we just ordered some of these books through the American
Citizen and Lawmen Association. This man, Dr. Randall Baird(?),
published this book in 1989. He was one of the leaders of the New
Age movement. And he explains about the spiritual conspiracy and
how these conspirators at the very top are actually spiritual
people. They're not atheists. Atheism is for those that they can
convince, and drive away from God. They *have* their "God". They
have their "God", and it's not the God that you and I believe in.

And so, this book is on our table. I think it's booth 304. We
just got a shipment of them in. By the way, all of us police
officers that work in the American Citizen and Lawmen
Association, myself included, officer Rick Dalton, and all of us
-- none of us make any money off all of this. We're not selling
books to make any profit. We're selling books to save our nation.
{3}. And to educate people [about] what's going on. *Don't* miss
out on this book. It's called *Inside the New Age Nightmare*. Dr.
Randall Baird published this book. It hit the stands on May 5th,
1989. And that's an important date to remember: May 5th, 1989. He
published this work after he was one of the three top leaders in
the New Age movement around this nation. And on May 5th, 1989, he
mysteriously drove off a cliff in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and died
in a car crash the minute this hit the stand. The very day that
this hit the stand. A very suspicious accident, and we just heard
about it just months ago. And the American Citizen and Lawmen
Association's gonna look into the death of Dr. Randall Baird.
Because he's done a great service for the American people in
exposing the number one conspiracy, that is actually *above* the
political conspiracy, is the spiritual conspiracy.

All right. Now. We're going to take you now into *how*, once they
have destroyed God, which was one of the foundations the nation
was built on, how are they going to destroy the Bill of Rights?
Well, they're going to destroy the Bill of Rights by creating
fear in society. Now we're getting into the area of crime, and
why we "need" a national police force. Because the American
people are very fearful now.

"Ozymandias", by Percy Bysshe Shelley:

    I met a traveller from an antique land
    Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

    Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
    The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
    And on the pedestal these words appear --

    'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'

    Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

power. After the prolonged disaster (for the Russians, at least)
of the First World War; after the subsequent uprising; several
factions were contending for power. At that point, "200 street
thugs" could very well have tipped the scales so as to favor a
particular faction.

*Operation Vampire Killer 2000* [OVK-2000]. McLamb recently (ca.

Transcript of a talk given by officer Jack McLamb (retired) of
the Phoenix Police Department.

Biographical note: Officer McLamb was one of the most highly
decorated members (if not *the* most highly decorated) of the
Phoenix Police Department. Besides many acts of heroism, officer
McLamb is also the originator of the "Officer Friendly" program,
a program in which police officers visit school children to help
them be better acquainted with the police. Officer McLamb was
disabled in the line of duty and is now retired from the Phoenix
Police Department. He currently hosts a radio show which can be
heard Monday through Friday, 7 pm cst, on WWCR, 5.810 mHz

JACK MCLAMB:
The uh, in controlling the American people by getting them to
give up their Bill of Rights, they had to use a system that Dr.
Stewart Crane, who's been a patriot for many years... for 30
years, Dr. Stewart Crane. Some of you probably have heard of him
because of his patriotic activity. One of the most brilliant men
in our nation, he had three Ph.D's: In history, and political
science, and I forgot what the other one was. He's been in and
out of jail so many times over the last 20 years, you wouldn't
believe it -- because of his stand against this Satanic, evil
system that has gripped our nation and the government systems of
the world.

And he made this statement about anarchy: "If you're going to
take over the united States, and you want to get you and I to
give up our Bill of Rights," (and like they talked about last
night, give up our guns so the government can "protect" us), "how
are you gonna do it?" Well Dr. Stewart Crane made this statement.
I think it's very important you understand what he says about the
word "anarchy".

Does everybody know what anarchy is? It's total fear of crime or
something that causes the breakdown of society. Now what we have,
in our country, doing it, is crime and drugs that Clinton and his
minions say we need a national police force to take care of; to
make us all "safe".

But Dr. Stewart Crane says this: "The use of anarchy, to come
into dictatorial power, is as old as civilization itself. Anarchy
is always used when a small minority wants to come into power
over the majority." {1}. He says, "A result of successful anarchy
is always a police state."

Now what is happening? Anarchy, crime, and drugs in the street is
causing what in America? A police state. Officers, you know that
and I know that and so does everybody else here.

But he says, "The result of a successful anarchy is *always* a
police state." He says, "Russia, Germany, Italy, or the U.S. --
if the type of government is decided by violence and crime in the
streets, an autocratic, ruthless dictatorship is inevitable,
because the people will demand it."

Now what is being used to take away our Bill of Rights and to
level us with the rest of the world? What makes us different than
any other nation in the world? The Bill of Rights, basically!
We've thrown God out of our government a *long* time ago. Now all
we have left is the Bill of Rights. What other nation on the face
of the earth has a right to free speech? A total right to free
speech. A 2nd amendment where we have [the right] to keep arms. A
4th amendment or a 5th amendment, all these things. Only the
united States of America. So they *must* destroy the Bill of
Rights.

But as professor Stewart Crane says, the way to do it is to get
you to *want* to give it up. And how are they gonna do that?
Anarchy in the streets. And it's working very, very successfully.

How do you create anarchy in the streets, now? Well, you've got
to do what the dialectic, the Hegelian {2} dialect, said. And the
Hegelian dialect was something that was conceived to cause you to
do things you wouldn't do unless there was something serious
happening in your community.

Here's the dialectic: The Hegelian principle is, revolutionaries
in government have created economic chaos; shortages of food,
fuel; confiscatory taxation; a crisis in education; and the
threat of war, crime, and other divisions, to condition Americans
for the New World Order. The technique is as old as politics
itself. It is the Hegelic principle to bring about change in a
three step process: the thesis, the antithesis, and the
synthesis.

The first step, the thesis, is to create a problem. Crime. Let's
use that as an example. Drugs. Illegal aliens coming in. Uh, the
economy collapses as the illegal aliens come in. The economy gets
worse. Whatever the problem is, you create it on purpose, O.K.?
That is the thesis.

The antithesis is, to generate opposition to the problem. [CN --
The reaction to the problem.] Fear. Panic. Hysteria.

And then the synthesis is, to offer the solution to the problem
created in step one!

Now what's the solution to the problem of crime and drugs in
America, offered in step one? A national police force. You give
up your Bill of Rights, and we're gonna "save" you from yourself.
Isn't it wonderful that our government would do that for us?

Well, how did they create crime at the magnitude that we have it
today? If you talk to Colonel "Bo" Gritz, if you talk to people
on the right of the political spectrum, if you talk to people on
the left of the political spectrum, you will find out that
there's been much research, *much* research, and much
documentation to the fact -- and I say *fact*, fellow police
officers (We've got some female police officers here too. Thank
you for coming.), -- but I'm telling you, I want you to hear
this, I'm talking about *fact* that we can prove, we've got the
evidence -- an evidentiary foundation that would stack as high as
*I* am, the evidence, I've seen it -- that the U.S. government,
certain factions in the U.S. government, have been involved in
importing the majority of drugs in the united States since the
'60s. Since 1960. We've got the evidence. We've got book after
book, research document after research document. If you come by
the table, I can give you some of this. I could give you a
newsletter that we've talked about it, the police officers.

We have, folks, in the united States, a phony war on drugs.
Because Richard Armitage(?), Theodore Shackley(?), and other
people... Richard Armitage is now still in our federal
government, very high up in the State Department. He served... He
was in Vietnam importing the drugs for many, many years during
the Vietnam war, from the "Golden Triangle". He now serves in
the... Let's see. Reagan appointed him Secretary of State, uh no,
assistant Secretary of Defense. And then Bush had to kind of make
him go away for a short time. But now, Clinton's got him in the
State Department running things! And these guys have been
involved in bringing the majority of drugs into the united
States. Why? To create a synthesis. Which means, to create a
problem so that you will react differently than you would have
had there been no problem.

The problem is drugs and crime in America. And what do they want
you to do? What did Edwin Meese say in 1980? "I think the
American people are ready to give up part of their Bill of Rights
so that we can do something about the drug and crime problem."

                     [...to be continued...]

{1} "The use of anarchy, to come into dictatorial power, is as
old as civilization itself." Here's an example: The Reichstag
fire, in the 1930s. The Nazis set fire to the Reichstag building,
then they blamed it on the Jews, which in turn they used as
justification for increased repression.

Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. (e.g. Hegel says this, the idea is from
Hegel, the idea is Hegelian.)

Police Against the New World Order: Many of our nation's

culminate before the year 2000, to usher the United States, along
with the rest of the nations of the world, into a "utopian"
global community allegedly under the control of a "philanthropic"
United Nations. A great many of our fellow Officers and National
Guardsmen are taking a stand against this plan because they
realize that their fellow Americans were never allowed to know of
this plan nor given the opportunity to vote on such a change in
their government. In addition, the officers are concerned
patriots and realize that this plan of world dominion is
injurious in the extreme and a total fraud perpetrated against
the people of the world.

*Operation Vampire Killer 2000* outlines *the plan* of Police
Against the New World Order which they believe will stop this
diabolical agenda.

JACK MCLAMB:
Now. We're comin' right down to what Bill Clinton has in mind,
and Hillary Rodham Clinton has in mind, for our nation.

Well their plan is to continue setting up a system in America
where, number one, they can control every police agency across
this nation. And number two,  they can set a plan together to
remove every gun away from the American people. This is a very
vital part of their plan! It is so vital, folks, [that] they
cannot go forward, they cannot go forward, until they somehow get
all the police in the nation together that will react at the same
time, at the same moment, and create the same activity on the
west coast and do the same activity on theeast coast, in the
north and the south of this nation, at the same instant moment.

For example: if we wanted to, as law enforcement people -- or
let's say if we were directed to -- come and get the guns of the
American people... *Or*, perhaps before that, if we were to have
to go and pick up all the "crazy" radical right-wing fanatics in
the nation one early morning, like 4 o'clock in the morning when
all of you [were] in bed, maybe -- We would have to be totally
synchronized across this nation! How can you have this happen in
L.A. two hours after it happens on the east coast?! You can see
what would happen. Word would spread so fast, you'd have a
revolution in one part of the country! So it has to be done,
synchronized, at the same moment.

So how are they going to do that? Well number one, they have to
be able to standardize every policy and procedure across the
nation in every law enforcement department.

Now they tried it with LEAA. Some of you will remember that name.
The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration was set up, it was
set up specifically for two reasons. The Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration was set up for two reasons, and two
reasons only. And that was, to remove the guns away from the
American people, put a plan together to do this. And number two,
to set up a national police force.

Now. Let's take "national police force" first. How were they
going to do that? Two ways: They were going to fund, put federal
funds into, every law enforcement agency across this nation,
until they could gain total control over those police agencies.
So LEAA started doing that. They had millions and millions and
millions of dollars pumped into every small and large police
department across this nation. And they *did* gain great control
over those agencies. It's just like, here in Arizona, we're now
being told by the federal government what to do. And if we don't
do it, they're gonna take our highway funds away from us, and
they're gonna take *this* fund, or they're gonna do *that* to us.
The same thing they've been [doing] on the other political
levels, they did in law enforcement in the early 70s -- started
funding crime prevention programs and equipment for law
enforcement agencies across the nation.

Well that was very successful. In the Phoenix Police Department,
I remember one lieutenant telling me one time, "Jack, go out and
spend this money." I was working in the area of crime prevention,
and he was working in the area of community service, in the
Phoenix Police Department. And this lieutenant told us all,
"Listen. We've got all this money left. We'll you've gotta get
out and spend it, 'cause if it's not spent before the end of the
fiscal year, we won't get that money back next year." So we had
to find ways to go out and spend this money so we could get it
back next year.

So it wa
