	What up peeps, it's your friendly neighborhood Wisdom here to kick
  the info on the flow (and the non-flows) goin on in da record store.


	BOOGIE MONSTERS "The Underwater Album" Well this is the fall joint
that a lot of people have been waiting for. It has the hard type joints for      
niggas that's into that and enough smooth & mellow joints to play while 
gettin sessed or having a little get together (common on college campuses).
My personal favorites are Mark of the Beast (dark and just phat), Bronx 
Bombas (a lovely chill track), and Old Man Jacob's Well (one of the best
storytelling songs I've heard in a long time!). Oh can't forget Salt Water
Taffy! I freestyled to this track for about a fucking day in my Walkman. The
lyrics are consistently cool with no awesomely spectacular displays of skills
but these kids seem like they could hold their own in a cipher. But the music
makes this a definite tape for the jeeps & walkmans. Butter baby!

	RATING: * * * * (4/5) Slammin!!


	FRESH SOUNDTRACK Well I didn't know what to expect when I got this,
but in the end, I rather enjoyed it. The little Genius joint "Watcha Back" is        
nice with the Genius droppin jewels for those that don't know. My favorite
is the Raekwon's "Heaven or Hell"... this is the motherfucking shit!!! If you
don't believe, BETTER ASK SOMEBODY cuz this shit is dope! I played this at
least 50 times the first night I got this CD. The music..slams, the lyrics..
slam, and Raekwon's voice adds the flavor to make it butter! The remix of
"..All So Simple" is lovely too, with a much harder edge, different lyrics 
and different track (sorta) with Ghostface Killer's part being rather lovely.
The rest of the CD may not appeal to non-heads or new schoolers, but it
brought back memories of better times for me with lots of classic hip-hop
joints like Whodini's "Freaks Come Out At Night", Fresh 3 MCs "Fresh", and
more. Overall, I loved this CD but some may not feel the same.

	RATING: * * * 1/2 (3.5/5) A Hit!

	B.I.G. " " OK I really didn't expect much from mister Smallz but hey
I liked "Party & Bullshit" & his little cameo on the last Heavy D tape made
me slightly curious as to this fat man. One word describes my feelings about
Biggie Smallz...Nice! The kid is definetely nice! His lyrics not on the level
of a Nas, Rakim, or Del more than convey his views across. He is a very
good storyteller and his voice only adds to the effects his lyrics convey.
The productions goes from OK to DOPE, but gems on this CD are "Machine Gun
Funk", "Everyday Struggle", "Suicidal Thoughts", and the shiznit "The What"
a duet with the Method Man (please make this a single w/ a video). Unlike
some guests on albums, Meth doesn't upstage BIG but they flow like to insane
brother split at birth. This album is a move in the right direction. (I hate
Juicy but it's puttin $$$ in his pockets so it's all good I guess)

	RATING: * * * * (4/5) Slammin!


	Lo-Life with the album I had to review...

	COMMON SENSE "Resurrection" Before I continue, I must first say that
I am from Chicago, have known Rashied Lynn (Common Sense) since about 7 and
although you may think this is biased, I read the Source's review and I think
the Source is fulla shit anywayz but they would have given that nigga 4 1/2
mics if he was from NY but enough of that, one with the review...
	This album contains no guns, no blunts, no bitchez just straight
lyrics about a nigga and his love for Chicago (which he represents to the        
fullest) and his love for hip-hop. The subject goes from hangin on the 
streets of Chicago (87th to be exact - my old strip), kickin it with females
in high schools (makes reference to my old HS - Kenwood), and even small
references to gangs in the Chi. The lyrical depth and methods come at you in
bursts so quick you have to rewind to pick them all up. He stills quote TV
like Peg Bundy might and if you from Chicago you will just laugh at the local
jokes he sticks in his lyrics ("I got more rhymes than folks in the Manor").
The production is nice on all the tracks, with standouts being "In My Own
World", "I Used to Love H.E.R.", "Nothing To Do". The album is a winner in
my book with even non-heads being able to sit back and enjoy 90% of the songs
on the CD. It seems kinda short compared to the first album but it's still
got mad flava!

	RATING: * * * * 1/2 (4.5/5) Almost A Classic

	And a fuck you to anyone who doesn't like my fucking rating, cuz the
shit is slammin so don't front!!


	Anywayz, I still haven't heard that new Black Moon shit yet, but out
in the Midwest, shit seems to take forever to get here anyway. That new Craig
Mack remix video is the shit! How'd he get LL to work with them I'll never
know but it's nice to see LL doing something beside the "Big Bad Wolf"!!

	with your host for today: Lo-Life

	I've seen so much shit lately between tapes & the movies this is
	goin to be a little longer than usual. So let's kick it...


	"The Professional: Golgo 13" Yep a cartoon, but a PHAT ASS CARTOON!
If you even like action movies a little, this shit will be the mother-
fuckin bomb! Sex, violence, action, plot twists, the whole nine. Duke Togo,
a world famous hitman known as Golgo 13, is paid to do a hit on a rich MF's
son and of course finishes the job and that's when shit starts to happen. 
After that job, he's goes on another to kill some big Mafia guy in Italy who
turns out to be a bitch, who he fucks a couple times and then kills. Then 
the big guns (CIA, FBI, Armed Forces, etc.) try to off Golgo 13 but to no
avail. The rest of the movie revolves around the rich MF paying the big guns
to off Golgo-13 while Mr. Togo is still getting his loot on (and his fuck 
on!) The people they throw at him are dope yet he overcomes and the ending is
classic. I must say one thing, he gets more pussy in the first 30 minutes 
than a lot of niggas do all week! But, this shit is dope and go rent it (or
take it, whatever you prefer) from Blockbuster and just get blunted (or not,
I wasn't for once) and enjoy!


	RATING: * * * * 1/2 (4.5/5) Almost a Classic!!

	"Above The Rim" OK so I'm a little late peeping this movie, but for
those that haven't seen it either, I'll kick the Willie Bobo. The story is       
about this kid (Duane Martin) whose ball skillz are goin to get him to 
college at Georgetown (my favorite school!!). He's a gun (a fucking rocket
launcher!!) and a showboat, but has skillz notheless. He become torn between
his coach whose trying to help him get to school and a thug from around the
way (Tupac) who wants him for this tournament to win some loot. Tupac's
brother (Leon) is a former school legend who tries to keep Duane from fallin
off like he did and keep him on the right path. The end is the usual sappy
shit with Tupac's team beating the shit (literally) out of the school team
in the finals and Leon's lacing up the Js to play with Duane and they win.
The end is kinda funny though cuz... well I'll let you see it for yourself
but it tickled me a little (I'm a sick person!). It's a straight flick but
it ain't quite what I expected.

	RATING: * * * (3/5) Good


	"Jason's Lyric" I hated this movie and I'd give it no stars but it 
had redeeming qualities. First, the plot is sad. It's a love story that tries
to be gangsta flick that tries to be a love story. It's a about this guy
Jason(Allen Payne from New Jack City) ,his just released brother from jail
(Bokeem Woodbine from Strapped) and this girl Lyric (Jada Pinkett -her FINE 
ASS, why she got blond ass hair NOW?!?!) and their little three way joint.
Jason tries to keep his brother Joshua off the streets and keep him straight,
Lyric wants Jason to leave and go somewhere (?!) with her, and Joshua just
wants to hustle and get drunk everyday. Treach (get to him in a minute) is
Lyric's brother who get Joshua in on this little heist and well... the plot
follows formulas after that. 
	Now, my many beefs!!!! First, why is Lyric a goddamn space cadet?!
This broad drove me nuts with the shit she said and did! Jason an fuckin       
idiot who literally chases Lyric down to get with her! (She's fine but stop
sweating please!) Joshua's an idiot for gettin in on the heist with Treach 
and his crew cuz he don't know them MFs and you never do no dirt with MFs
you don't know cuz they will trick off in a minute if they caught! (Go see
Resevoir Dogs - dude didn't trick, he just was 5-0). Oh, and the big one,
TREACH CANNOT ACT!!! He couldn't act up if he was on cloud nine with
directions!!! His character who was supposed to be SO HARD, after getting his
ASS KICKED didn't tell his "crew" who did it, and cried like a bitch when
they got killed and his sista got shot! 
	Now, the few good points. Jada Pinkett naked....YES is all I can say
cuz that nigga Jason GOT BUSY!! The movie was funny when it wasn't supposed        
to be (I was lifted but the rest of the audience wasn't and they laughed at
the same shit!) like at the end when Lyric gets shot, just peep what Joshua
says! The shit was stupid funny. And I don't care about telling what happen-
ed in this movie cuz it was BUTT!!

	RATING: * (1/5) w/o noticing a naked Jada Pinkett

	RATING: * 1/2 (1.5/5) noticing a naked Jada Pinkett


	Tupac Interview on BET. No rating here, but those who missed it, it
was kinda cool seeing "Mr. Thug Life" being calm and relaxed and talking like
the individual we know he is. He sounded very intellectual (no surprise I
always thought he was smart) and talked about his various experiences and
scuffles with the law. I think he has always be "hard" but not the insane
maniac he portrays himself, or I should say the media, portrays him to be. He
just anotha nigga out here with a few more papes than the rest of us, and 
after his incidents with police kickin his ass and crackin his dome in 
Oakland (I think it was) and them off-duty bitches tried to shoot him down
South he kinda like FUCK IT & THEM. But if you get a chance to see it, just
watch and listen to Tupac Shakur, not 2PAC, talk about himself and you will
understand him if you didn't already!

	
	OK. There's not much else to not on the idiot tube or at the flicks
except there's a new Spike joint comin out, I missed the new Nightmare (had
free passes and lost em), and some other shit too. So next iss, I try to 
catch some more shit and get back with ya. Peace!

		Presidential Powers
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This nation has been gearing up for internal problems for many years.
Hundreds of Presidential Executive Orders have been issued to allow
emergency powers under any type of crisis-- perceived or real. A
Presidential Executive Order, whether Constitutional or not, becomes law
simply by its publication in the Federal Registry, bypassing Congress
completely. Here are just a few Executive Orders that would suspend the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These Executive Orders have been on
record for nearly 30 years and could be enacted by the simple stroke of a
presidential pen:

PEO10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation
and control of hihgways and seaports.
PEO10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication
media.
PEO10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas,
petroleum, fuels and minerals.
PEO10998 allows the government to take control of all food sources and
farms.
PEO11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades
under government supervision.
PEO11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and
welfare functions.
PEO11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national
registration of all persons.
PEO11003 allows the government to seize control of all airports and
aircraft, including commercial aircraft.
PEO11004 allows the housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities,
build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and
establish new locations for populations.
PEO11005 allows the government to take control of railroads, inland
waterways and public storage facilities.
PEO11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning
and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times
of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.
PEO11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the
plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to
establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to
operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the
President.

Without Congressional approval, the President now has the power to
transfer whole populations to any part of the country, the power to
suspend the Press and to enforce a national registration of all persons.
The President, in essence, has dictatorial powers never provided to him
under the Constitution. The President has the power to suspend the Bill of
Rights in any real or perceived emergency. Unlike Lincoln or Roosevelt,
these powers are not derived from any wartime need, but from *any*
crisis-- domestic or foreign, hostile or economic.

		How To Fake Mail using UNIX
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     Don't really care why you'd want to but hey knock yourself out!
     
Telnet to port 25 of the machine you want the mail to appear to
originate from.  Enter your message as in this example:

 HELO bellcore.com
 MAIL FROM:Voyager@bellcore.com
 RCPT TO:president@whitehouse.gov
 DATA

	(Enter your mail text)

 QUIT

On systems that have RFC 931 implemented, spoofing your "MAIL FROM:"
line will not work.  Test by sending yourself fakemail first.


		How to Fake Posts on USENET
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Use inews to post.  Give inews the following lines:

 From:
 Newsgroups:
 Subject:
 Message-ID:
 Date:
 Organization:

For a moderated newsgroup, inews will also require this line:

 Approved:

Then add your post and terminate with <Control-D>.

Example:

 Subject: Pathetic bunch of wannabe losers
 Message-ID: <esr.123@locke.ccil.org>

 A pathetic bunch of wannabe losers is what most of you are, with no
 right to steal the honorable title of `hacker' to puff up your silly
 adolescent egos. Get stuffed, get lost, and go to jail.

Note that many systems will append an Originator: line to your message
header, effectively revealing the account from which the message was
posted.

NOTE: I haven't quite got the bugs out of this cuz the one system I tried,
it kept saying I left out Subject when I put in. But maybe it's the UNIX
system I'm using.

		Soda Can Bomb
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-

     This is an anti-personnel bomb meant for taking out crowds. The bottom
of a pop can is half cut out and bent back. A giant firecracker (or other
explosive is put in and surrounded with nuts and bolts or rocks. The fuse is
then armed with a chemical delay in a plastic drinking straw.
	After first making sure there are no kids around, the acid or 
glycerin is put in the straw and the can is set down by a tree or wall where
it won't be disturbed. The delay should give you three to five minutes. It 
will have a shattering effect on any visitors.

		Soda Can of Death II
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
		Edited by Wisdom


	This is one of the most deadly, evil,  vile, destuctive and just plain
dire explosive devices known. This weapon operates on the "Deadman's  Switch"  
theory, but is easily disguised as an innocent recyclable object. The reason 
it is so demonic, is that once it is set, merely TOUCHING the device will set 
it off. Thus one could place it on a doorstep, behind a car, or just in the 
middle of the street where some innocent passer-by could mistakenly set it 
off. Even worse, some cheap fool, or environmentally concious person could 
set it off. Depending on what type of explosive you use, and whether or not 
you add shrapnel, the device's power could range from a small flare, to a 
tremendous detonation!

	The concept is quite simple, and will be given in an easy step by step
format, for your reading pleasure. :)

1.  Decide what you want to do with the bomb, to use it as a scare tactic, or
    to detonate a city block, or maybe just a small, but powerful explosion.

2.  Pick up the following ingredients for the bomb:
       (1)   Aluminum can used for soda or beer.  Ranging from 12oz and up.
       (1)   Spool of wire, any color. Preferably solid. Fone wire works nice.
       (1)   Mercury Switch.(optional)
       (1)   Mini SPST Switch.
       (1)   SPST pushbutton switch. Normally ON.
       (1)   Spool of solder, and a nice iron. Neatness counts!
       (1)   Nine Volt Battery.

2A. Now  here's where your decision in step 1 counts.. If you want a scare
    tactic, Pick  up  some  flash powder (or flare powder) and a nice 1.5V 
    flashlight bulb. (convieniently available at  your local RADIO-SHACK)

2B. WHAT!? You want to detonate a city block?!  You are a lunatic!  
    Go  to  your local  store and  pick up some ammonium nitrate (instant  
    coldpacks, or fertilizer ).  Now aquire,  or make (not advised) a nice #8 
    blasting cap.   On second thought, making one might be better for your 
    purposes, because you can make it MILITARY style. (75% more powerful than 
    conventional blasting caps. )  #8's have a tendency not to work well with 
    Ammonium Nitrate.

2C. Just a nice routine explosion eh?  Pick up a flashlight bulb (1.5V) and
    some gun powder, or black powder.

3.  Take your nice, innocent can, and empty the contents.  Cut the top CLEAR
    off right under the rim.  DON'T Be messy, if you bend the can, start over.
    Neatness makes the bomb WORK.

4.  Drill a hole in the direct center of the bottom of the can, barely big
    enough to thread the pushbutton switch in, and secure it with the handy
    bolt that comes with it.

5.  Now cut a small rectangular hole, near the inside edge of the bottom of 
    the can to house the mini switch.

6.  OK, the CAN section of your process is complete.  Time for the hard part.
    
    Hope you can solder.

   Ok, now that I've wasted your precious time with that horrid diagram, I 
will explain it.  The wires leading to and from the mercury switch are NOT 
TO BE PUT in if the mercury switch is omited.

	Simply enough, The current goes through the wires to the first switch,
if the first switch is ON, it goes to the next switch, if this switch is on,
It goes to the detonator, which in turn explodes the device. I recommend you
test your circuit with a multi-tester before you  go about  construction of 
the bomb.  This will help to assure a NON-DUD.  I advise that you remove the 
nice detonator before doing this, unless of course you are a masochist.

7.  You managed to follow the diagram and constructed the WORKING(optimal 
    word here) circuit.  OK..  now the fun begins.  Place the pushbutton 
    switch in it's proper  hole, and secure. Do the same with the mini 
    switch.  Tape the good ol nine-volt battery to the inside of the can. 
    Add some epoxy for safety's sake.  MAKE SURE NO WIRES TOUCH EACH OTHER!  
    IF THEY DO.. well.. alas.. a good militant was he.

8.  OK, fill the can up about 1/4th the way up with your explosive of 
    choice. Pack if  desired.  Get a  small  amount of  shrapnel if  desired 
    and add generously. Add no more than 1/4th the total weight of the can.
      
9.  If you  opted to use the  mercury switch, place that here.  Place it in a
    manner so that if the can  is moved from  the vertical  direction it will
    set off the detonator.

10. If you are mercury-less place the detonator here. If you used the  switch
    fill  the can  with enough  explosives to cover  your newly  placed 
    switch. If you have used the flashlight  bulb, now is the time to 
    CAREFULLY break the bulb, WITHOUT damaging the filament.. test with a 
    multi-tester.. If you screw up.. your bad luck. 

11. If you used the switch, place your detonator here. In either case, fill
    the can the rest of the way up.

12. Get out the epoxy and glue the top back on.

     You have just made a soda can..  Now, if you are proceding with this file,
before reading it completely, you are probably dead about now.  Here's why you
died:

   During the final stages, you left the mini switch ON. This is the arming
switch, and should ONLY be used during testing, and planting.

   You managed to build up a large amount of static electricity and discharged
it into a can full of explosives. Bad move. Use ANTI-Static spray to avoid
this.

   You did this by a nice, warm open fire. Or better yet you smoked nearby the
device.  Bravo on an excellent demise.

   You left the device stiing in your nice hot window sill, where it exploded
killing your family. I applaud you.

   You decided the instructions weren't good enough for you, and WINGED it.

   You let some wires touch in the final stage of construction. Avoid this by
coating all wires and leads with melted plastic, use electical tape, or
covered wires. The second method is prefered.

Well, If you got this far.. you are alive. (I hope!!)

	OK, you have your nice, prepared device, and wish to plant it. This is
simple. Sort of. There is a danger factor involved, so be forewarned.

	Take the device to the site. DO NOT arm it until it is absolutely
ready! This is CRITICAL! The easiest place to put is is on a raised platform
such as a door step. Place the can on the edge of the step, make sure it is
perfectly vertical.  The pushbutton switch should be pushed in now, and in the
OFF position.  Now CAREFULLY arm the device. CAREFULLY slide it over to about
the center of the door step, so that it gets kicked over when someone steps
outside.  If you used the mercury switch, you now realize why it is optional.
If you move the can too fast, the switch will detonate you.

	If you are placing this on a large flat surface, using the mercury
switch is HIGHLY advised against!  Place a VERY thin sheet of paperboard under
your can, compressing the bottom switch. Poke a hole in the bottom of the can,
so that it can be armed. Arm the device, and place it on the ground. Push down
on the top of the device, and SLOWLY remove the paperboard. If the paperboard
was thin enough you survived.

	Get the hell out of there, and DO yourself a favor, and wear gloves..
finger prints are NOT A GOOD THING!!

	Ok,  The  mercury switch is VERY VERY dangerous, but it also makes it
absolutely impossible to disarm the bomb should someone discover it. The
paperboard can be simply cut away from the edges in the flat surface bomb.
This can be extremely useful in circumstances where you are placing the bomb
in an area that is very bumpy, or rocky, like loose sand or  dirt. Or if you
just prefer to keep your life.

	How Your Bomb Works:

   Well, simply enough, once it is armed, if the pushbutton switch is released
the circuit will be completed. With the mercury switch added, if either the
switch or the button is tripped, it will explode. The current will set off
the detonator, or if you used the flashlight bulb, It will cause a high
intensity flame to be produced for about 1-2 seconds. This is quite enough
to explode any light explosive.

   To tell you the truth, you can use any explosive that you desire with this
bomb. One time  I even saw one of these made completely of THERMITE. Holy shit
the whole can just melted, and fused with the road tar. If you want, you can 
use plastique, or just pour in some nitroglycerine(HA!).

		Saltpeter (or Potassium Nitrate)
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Potassium Nitrate (Saltpeter) can be extracted from many natural
	sources (as well as bought from some drug stores) and can be used
	to make nitric acid, black powder, and many other pyrotechnics. The
	yield ranges from .1 to 10% by weight, depending on the fertility of
	the soil.


Ingredients:                            Source:
============                            =======
Nitrate bearing earth or                Soil containing old decaying 
other material, about 3-1/2             vegetable or animal matter;
gallons (13-1/2 liters).                Old cellars and/or farm dirt floor;
					Earth from old burial brounds;
					Decayed stone or mortar building
					foundations

Fine wood ashes about a 1/2 cup         Totally burned whitish wood ash powder
(1/8 liter)                             Totally burned paper (Black)

Bucket (or container) about 5
gallons (19 liters) in volume
(Plastic, Metal, or Wood)

2 pieces of finely woven cloth larger
than botton of container

Shallow pan or dish, at least as
big as bottom of bucket

Shallow heat resistant container
(Ceramic, Metal, etc...)

1-3/4 gallons of water
(6-3/4 liters)

Something to make holes
(Screwdriver, knife, etc...)

1 gallon of alcohol (4 liters)
(Whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc..)

Heat source (Fire, electric heater, etc..)

Paper
Tape

NOTE: The ratios of ingredients are only important. For double the saltpeter,
	double the quantities used.


	Punch holes in bottom of the bucket. Spread one piece of cloth inside
the bucket. Place wood ashes on cloth and spread to make a layer about the
thickness of the cloth. Place second cloth on top of the ashes. Place dirt in
the bucket. Place bucket over shallow container. Bucket can be supported on 
sticks if necessary. Boil water and pour it thru dirt in bucket a little at a
time. Allow water to run thru holes in bucket into shallow container. Be sure
water goes thru ALL the dirt. Allow drained liquid to cool and settle for 1 to
2 hours.

NOTE: Do not pour all the water at once because this may cause a stoppage.

	Carefully drain off liquid into heat resistant container. Discard any
sludge remaining in bottom of shallow container. Boil mixture over hot fire 
for at least 2 hours. Small grains of salt will begin to appear in the 
solution. Scoop these out as they form, using a strainer of some kind. (Paper
,etc..) When liquid has boiled down to have it's original size, remove from
fire and let it sit. After half an hour add an equal amount of alcohol. When
mixture is poured thru paper, small white crystal will collect on top of it.
	
	To purify the potassium nitrate, re-dissolve the dry crystals in the
smallest possible amount of boiled water. Remove any salt crystal that appear
and pour thru an improvised filter made of several pieces of paper and 
evaporate or gently heat the concentrated solution to dryness. Spread crystals
on flat surface and allow to dry. The potassium nitrate crystals are ready for
use!

		Uses for Saltpeter(Potassium Nitrate)
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


     Black Powder
     -------------
     This can be used as blasting or gun powder.


Ingredients
===========
3   cups Saltpeter, granulated          (3/4 liters)
2   cups Wood Charcoal, powdered        (1/2 liters)
1/2 cup  Sulfur, powdered               (1/8 liters)  
5  pints Alcohol (Same as above..)      (2-1/2 liters)
3   cups Water                          (3/4 liters)
Heat Source
2 Two gallon buckets (one being heat resistant)
					(7-1/2 liters)
Flat window screen, at least 1 foot square (30 cm)
Large wooden stick
Cloth, at least 2 feet square (60 cm)


	Place alcohol in one of the buckets. Place potassium nitrate, charcoal
and sulfur in the heat resistant bucket. Add 1 cup of water and mix thoroughly
with wooden stick until all ingredients are dissolved. Add remaining water to
mixture. Place bucket on heat source and stir until small bubbles begin to 
form.

CAUTION: Do not boil mixture. Be sure ALL of the mixture stays wet. If any is
	dry, as on the sides of bucket, it may ignite!!

	Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring
quickly. Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through
cloth to obtain black powder. Get rid of liquid. Wrap cloth around black 
powder and squeeze to remove excess liquid. Place screening over dry bucket. 
Place workable amount of damp powder on granulate but rubbing powder thru 
screen. 

NOTE: If granulated particles appear to stick together and change shape, re-
	combine entire batch of powder and strain again and go from there!

	Spread granulated black powder on flat dry surface so that layer about
1/2 inch (1-1/4 cm) is formed. Allow to dry. Use radiator, or direct sunlight.
this should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in one hour. The longer
the drying period, the less effective the black powder.

CAUTION: Remove from heat AS SOON AS granules are dry. Black powder is now 
	ready to use.

	More uses for Saltpeter in later issues....

		FM Transmitter
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Always wanted your own radio station where here's how to do it!!


Ingredients:
============
One HAM radio 6-meter band linear amplifier, to boost the FM signal from
  the tuner for broadcasting. A bandwidth of 6 MHz will work.

One 6 meter HAM radio antenna (feet I think?!)

One tuner that you will use to send out the signal. The use of a stereo tuner
  is HIGHLY recommended (the part you plug the other components to...)

Two phono plugs to Tinned wire (Radio Shack CAT. No. 42-2371) Cost: about $2

2 long piece of copper speaker wire


	First take the two phone plugs and plug them into any audio OUT jacks
in the back of the tuner. Now wrap the 2 Tinned wires from the end of the       
phone plugs around the input screws on the linear amp. Next wrap each of the
speaker wires onto the output screws on the linear amp. Take the end of the 
speaker wire and connect it to the HAM antenna.

 ---------               -------                 ----\ /----
[  Tuner  ] ----------> [  Amp  ] ------------> [  Antenna  ]
 ---------               -------                 -----------

	Once you finish the sctual construction of the transmitter you have
to decide on what sation to broadcast on. The station you choose depends on
the length of the HAM antenna. The equation to find length of the antenna to
use for a station is: Antenna's length in feet is 468 divided by the freq in
MHz.

Like for 96.3 you divide 468 by 96.3 then that answer is the length of the
antenna: 468/96.3 = 4.86 feet, so cut off 1.14 feet of the 6 footer.

	Now play whatever you want through the audio out jack on the tuner and
it will be amplified and sent out to the public.

     ------------------------------------------------------------


		Napalm Light Bulb Bomb
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     Take a light bulb and crack the globe part off. (Don't break the glass!)
Take some gasoline and dishwashing detergent and mix it until it looks like
honey. Fill the globe up about 1/2 inch full (don't let it touch where the
filaments wound be). Place the top back on and scotch tape (or superglue) it
back together (lightly). Now, turn OFF the lights and replace the bulb. The
next person to flip the switch will get sprayed with flames that can't be
put out! (They have to burn out!)


     ------------------------------------------------------------



	Well that brings us to the end of another fabulous issue of URBAN
	magazine, the zine for the urban dweller who just might need to be
	informed just in case FEMA knocks on your door ready to put you
	in a camp! (More on that next issue!) And if you know where I can
	find more info on FEMA then E-Mail me and we'll give you full credit
	(put your name in here, etc...) So peace to the next time.

	Same URBAN time, same URBAN channel!!
