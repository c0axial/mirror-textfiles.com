	Iiiight! What's up B-Boys and Girls, we got mad shit to review so 
	let's kick this shit off right with the flava...

	PETE ROCK & CL SMOOTH "The Main Ingredient" - One word: DOPE!! This
album is straight butter! I loved this motherfucka from start to finish. The 
production is consistent throughout the album and CL lyrics are at the top
of the motherfucking game. If Boogie Monsters was the tape for fall, this is
the definite slammer for the winter. The tracks are more laid back this time
than last but are all sure shots and PR has his little intros on most of his
cuts and in the liner notes thanks niggas for samplin his shits! The best
cuts on this definite winner are "Escapism" (PR flows slightly but the tracks
is so FUCKIN DOPE!!), "Worldwide" (Rob-O rips this track to threads!), 
"It's on You" (CL makes his debut as a gangsta who ready to take care of 
business!) There's is no way anyone who remotely likes rap should not buy this
album!!!

	RATING: * * * * 1/2 (4.5) Slammin just missed being a classic!

	PARIS "Guerilla Funk" - This album dissapointed me. The P-Dog from
The Devil Made Me Do It has pretty much seemed to have died. Before your 
black medallions in an uproar, he's still pro-Black but his productions
sounds like a lot of the West Coast (read G-Funk bullshit) music that's out
right now. The title track and "It's Real" if I didn't read the liner notes
I thought were produced by Dr. Dre. The rest of the CD is OK, with "Keep
Running", a nice mellow jam. "One Time 4 Yo Mind" is also pretty straight.
But the dopest and funniest song is "40 oz & A Fool" where Paris becomes
Paris Dogg and talks about the house nigga who sells out for some loot.
This album fell short of my own expectations:

	RATING: * * (2.5) Needs Work

	O.C. "Word..Life" (Half of the original review got erased somehow)
First before I go on, Wisdom has this to say about the Source's 3 mics review
of this album, "The Source can suck my dick". This album is fat as hell.
It's starts out with the "Intro" with Organized Konfusion chipping in to
load shots up to the dome. Then "Word..Life" comes in with more butter
to add to the verbal sandwich O.C. delivers. "Born to Live" is my favorite
song because of the track and the lyrics (although the reminiscing thing is
kinda played). "Point O Viewz" is fat as is "Constables" and "Ga Head" is
fucking stuck in my head and describes how any nigga feels when his lady
tricks off with another LADY?!?!
	This is definetely a dope album and although I'd have liked more
tracks like "Time's Up" this is straight butter!

	RATING: * * * * (4/5) Slamming

	BRAND NUBIAN "Everything is Everything" - First, I didn't buy the
second album cuz motherfuckas told me it was butt. (Then I realized the niggas
that said it was butt, fake ass wanna be bitches!) But, I was looking forward
to this and much to everyone else's (alt.rap) dismay, I like this shit. Yes,
this is not "One For All" II but these Gods are about taking heads and 
educated youth. The biggest beef alt.rap peeps had was the fact that BN
advocated (or seemed to) guns and their use, but lets be serious... if niggas
want you or your shit, you got to protect self which is basically what they
saying.
	"Word Is Bond" and "Nubian Jam" are more for the video shows but are
both musically and lyrically sound. "Alladat" has Busta Rhymes on the chorus
and the song talk about them bitches and nigga that think they all that. 
"Step In Da Cipher" is a cipher jam where Serge, Maestro Manny and 
Snaggapuss rip shit over a basic track. When are these kids gonna get signed?
"Off Da Head" is exactly that, Lord Jamar and Sadat X freestylin with some
pretty fat lyrics. The rest of the album is pretty nice but "Down for the
Real" is kinda uneven with the rest of the album cause it sounds like some
West Coast (gangsta-rap) shit. (not musically just topic-wise)

	RATING: * * * (3.5/5) Straight

	KEITH MURRAY "The Most Beatifullest Thing in The World" - This album
really hurt. This kid has mad skills but has boring ass track. Will somebody
please tell Erick Sermon to try some new shit cuz the funk shit is giving me
added Z's. The lyrics throughout the album are phat with Keith's use of big
(usually not found in Webster's) words. I hate "Herb's Pumpin" and "Psycho-
ward" so please skip them. Standout cuts are "How's That" (with Redman and
Erick Sermon rapping), "Bom Bom Zee" (with Hurricane G), "Take It To The
Streets" (with LOD), and "Escape From The World". Basically, if you got spare
loot get it, otherwise save the papes and dub the songs you want.

	RATING: * * 1/2 (2.5/5) Needs Work

	That's it here, but I just got Redman and it's phat review in the 
	next issue of URBAN. That new Group Home single "Superstar" is dope
	and I heard some new Kool Keith shit (something about murder in the
	paper or something like that more next issue)

{---------------------------------------------------------------------------}

			T V  &  M o v i e s 

{---------------------------------------------------------------------------}

	Yo, wassup kids this is that nigga Wisdom with the phat ass flicks
	for you to peep so let's motivate...

	"You So Crazy" - This Martin Lawrence movie is pretty straight and if
you have heard "Talkin' Shit" (his tape) then you might feel like I felt. The
shit was funny but I didn't really seem to be too much new shit in this one.
If you like Martin, you'll like this.

	RATING: * * * (3/5) A Hit

	"True Lies" I had no idea this movie was going to be this funny.
(Intentional or not) This is the funniest Arnold Swartznegger(?!) has ever 
done. The basis of this movie is that Arnie is a secret agent who saves the
free world, while masquerading as a computer sales guy. This movie is larger
(and funnier) than life. In on scene, Arnie plays a trick on his wife and 
she (unknowingly) dances sexy for him and while pole dancing, loses her grip
and falls on her shit. Another scene involves Arnie being handcuffed and under
truth serum, tells his tormentor how he's goin to kill him and the guard and
when the doctor asks how, he replies that he picked his cuffs and he kills 
the doctor.
	This movie was pretty good if not unbelievable. I was very high with
crew when I watched this but we got our $1 worth, so catch this shit if you
can. the action is even pretty good.

	RATING: * * * (3/5) A Hit

	"The Crow" - This was to be Brandon Lee's breakout movie and if he 
were alive today we'd have fat ass flicks to watch while high! This movie,
high or not, is the fuckin bomb! The plot is... Brandon & his girl are killed
by a gang and he's resurrected for revenge against them. His powers lie with
a magical crow by his side. The fighting scenes are very well done and Mr.
Lee kicks ass like dad. The special effects and settings are so fuckin dope.
There's not much more to say but just see this movie and you'll love it!

	RATING: * * * * (4/5) Slamming!

	"Sugar Hill" This movie is in the mold of most drug dealer movies
except the drug dealer is trying to get out. Wesley Snipes plays a heroin      
dealer in NY who has the blocks sewed up but meets a young lady and decides
he wants more out of life that drugs can give him. His lunatic brother is
his main man who runs shit right along with him and in the end turns into
his downfall. While trying to get out, the Italian who supply him and his
brother cross them and they cross back and a war ensues...
	This film was straight, but I've seen this all before. Drug dealer
with heart of gold meets lady wants to settle down... Yawn! The action
scenes (the few that exist) are OK but this ain't the greatest flick that
Wesley ever did. If you got some extra $$$ see it, otherwise wait til HBO
gets it.

	RATING: * * 1/2 (2.5/5) Needs some work

	Well that's it for the TV type shit, but I'm gonna see Speed and
	kick the 411 on that next time and I might have seen that Street
	Fighter movie by then so look out!

FEMA File #1:

[From the CONTACT 5/31/94 with permission]

THE GREAT ELECTION
FRAUD OF 1994

A great legal fraud has come to light which must be resolved in 1994
or the elections normally held to fill all public offices may have to
be cancelled, nationwide, based on the statutes of fraud. Here are
the facts to be considered:

On March 9, 1933, the U.S. Congress delegated to Franklin D.
Roosevelt (FDR) the WAR POWERS--emergency rule by Executive
Order--(which temporarily SUSPENDED THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND THE BILL
OF RIGHTS, hereinafter referred to, collectively, as CBR) in order to
deal with the [orchestrated] monetary crisis then existing. Much of
the bureaucracy with us today was created during the first one hundred
days of the FDR Administration, when most official acts were, delib-
erately, unconstitutional--but nobody cared because of the so-called
monetary crisis. This unconstitutional "bureaucracy" created in 1933
could only exist and operate WHILE EMERGENCY RULE REMAINED IN FORCE
AND THE CBR REMAINED SUSPENDED! Keep this in mind.

However, it soon became apparent to those [crooks] in the seats of
power that a permanent state of "emergency" was deemed necessary
if the unconstitutional (fully socialist) bureaucracy, created in
l933, were to remain functional and given some form of accepted
legality. To accomplish this without alerting the people, a practice
was developed [National Emergencies Act., Sec. 202(d)] whereby the
President transmits to the Congress (quietly) a notice to extend the
"emergency" for another year. President Clinton did his part on May
25, l993 when he "extended" the national emergency created by George
Bush the year before [Executive Order #12808] using the crisis in
Bosnia for the excuse. Clinton will have to repeat that "extension"
again in 1994, using the same, or some other, contrived "emergency"
to keep his fullv socialist and unconstitutional bureaucracy alive and
well for one more year.

But there is a far more sinister side to these yearly "extensions"
which we need to examine here and now. When the President "extends"
the Emergency, he also fully SUSPENDS AND NULLIFIES THE CBR WITH THE
FULL COOPERATlON AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONGRESS--BUT WITHOUT THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEOPLE. It is NOT a media event. These are deliberate
and premeditated acts of TREASON and SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY TO
OVERTHROW the CBR by the Federal Government. It has resulted in
61-years of governing where the CBR has been "OFFICIALLY", BUT
SECRETLY, SHELVED. Now we know how and WHY unconstitutional bills
get legislated. (NAFTA, Brady Bill, etc.)

This "OFFICIAL" SUSPENSION OF THE CBR--see Title 12 USC Sec. 95(a) &
(b)--the current law of today--needs to become the chief issue for
anyone running for public office, except those who are Democrats or
Republicans, as they are responsible for the above crimes. Candidates
winning an election could never promise, or give their constituents
any REPRESENTATION whatsoever and COULD NOT BE SWORN-IN, by law, to
support and defend the CBR when IT HAS BEEN,AND STILL IS,
"OFFICIALLY" SUSPENDED, BY STATUTE!

THE ENTIRE ELECTION PROCESS IN 1994, for reasons above, is only for
fools and knaves for it is total FRAUD as long as "EMERGENCY RULE"
REMAINS IN EFFECT.

You can become a prime mover TO END EMERGENCY RULE and restore the CBR
to its rightful place in the affairs of Government. Get yourself
informed on this issue (see below) and may God guide you and bless you
in this Pursuit!

NEWS RELEASE
MAY 26. 1994

CONSTITUTIONAL TREASON

(Puyallup, Washington) Just in case you missed it, on February 1,
l994, CBS Radio News announced that Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas had been "enlisted" to fight the so-called "WAR ON CRIME".
The "sound bite" containing Senator Dole's own words stated he had
become a "convert" and that he would now support a "thirty-million-
dollar FEDERAL GUN BUY BACK program", similar to ones that have been
utilized with mixed success at the State and local levels. Dole
admitted, however, that with 200-million guns on the streets, the
program won't do much to stop crime.

[H: Dear ones, don't you see what is more important HERE? A 'WAR' is
the same as announcing an "emergency". By declaring the ongoing "war
on crime" you have JUST EXTENDED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY!]

Under the disguise of "crime prevention" and "health care reform", a
massive effort is under way to disarm Americia, being promoted under
various pretenses at all levels of Government. Here, in Washington
State alone, a total of 65 or more anti-gun measures had been
impressed upon the Legislature, some under the heading of "youth
violence reduction". This anti-gun feeding-frenzy threatens honest,
law-abiding Citizens and their unalienable right to keep and bear
arms for self defense. But why is it that those who are most in favor
of "gun control" are the ones softest on the criminal? Why is it that
collectivist methods are the only solutions they propose? The answer
should put you inta a state of fear.

Little is known about an obscure, yet dramatic, piece of legislation
that was enacted into law by the Congress in 1961. At the behest of
then Senator Prescott Bush of Connecticut (yes, the father of George
Bush) President John F. Kennedy signed into law Public Law 87-297 on
September 1, 1961. This law can be located in the United States Code,
Title 22, and beginning at Section 2551. This law set the stage for
the creation of the "United States Disarmament Agency" and set in
place the political machinery to DESTROY our nation's sovereignty.
Notice the word "disarmament" in the title of this agency. Every
Congress and every President since 1961 has worked, methodically, and
craftily, to implement various provisions of Public Law 87-297. It
is all part and parcel of the march to merge America into the "New
Wor1d Order" All public policy is a result of the "emergency" OF
1933. WHAT "EMERGENCY...you say? Read on.

With the foregoing in mind, are we now to believe that all of a sudden
Senator Bob Dole has had a "change of heart" from his previously
stated position, that he was now a "convert" and would support the
WAR ON CRIME, and that he will now support the filibuster of the
Schumer/Feinstein Amendment, the socalled "Assault Weapon Ban"
contained in H.R. 42967 which let the first salvo of the Brady Bill
pass with only THREE SENATORS ON THE FLOOR. In January, he urged the
President-- on national television--TO SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION OF
THE CRIME BILL containing the FEINSTEIN GUN BAN. This is the same
Senator Bob Dole who also introduced a resolution SUPPORTING
CLINTON'S POSITION ON THE CHICAGO GUN SWEEPS--WITHOUT WARRANTS--TO
SEARCH FOR AND SEIZE GUNS.

And remember well: with the suspension of the Constution FOR The
United States OF America on March 6, 1933, and its continuation for
the past 6l years by various Presidential Executive Orders,
including those recent Executive Orders of President William J.
Clinton, the American people are under the awesome power of a
Constitutional Dictatorship, under the War Powers and the Trading
with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917. Since 1933, the American people
have not had the often quoted and misheralded 2nd Amendment Right to
"keep and bear arms". It is only through "license" by the "statutorily
created right" that you presently have the ability of firearms
ownership. One must understand the legal meanings of the words:
"owner" and "transfer" as used in the law as it pertains to the
Federal Firearms--under license--as a result of the Constitutional
Treason and the Acts of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the 73rd
Congress of 1933.

The remedy? First things first. Because the American people are
unaware of being unaware, they must first be made aware. Therefore, we
strongly recommend: that Americans be made aware of the treason and
seditious conspiracy, and the "emergency" we've all been under for the
past 61-years, by obtaining the material presented in the prior
writing. The materials are not copyrighted; therefore, once you obtain
a master set, you may duplicate and distribute them at will. But
remember: the messengers have paid dearly  to bring you this research
to put all of the pieces together, starting at a single focal point,
from which all the rest of America's problems originate. Once the
American people understand what the problem is, we can then begin to
correct the misdeeds of the past 61 years of the "emergency". Once the
American people understand the perfidy, greed and avarice that have
held them in bondage all these years, there will be no need to run in
circles from one Patriot meeting to the next in search of that elusive
and magic "silver bullet".

FEMA File #2 & #3:

FEMA stands for the "Federal Emergency Management Agency." It isn't
an elected body, it has a quasi-secret budget in the billions of
dollars, and it has more power than the president of the United
States -- it is the most powerful organization in the United States
and most people don't even know it exists.

It was originally created to insure the survival of the U.S.
government in the event of a nuclear attack. It was also provided
the task of being a federal coordinating body during times of
domestic disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes.

But it wasn't created under Constitutional law or an act of
Congress, it was created by EXECUTIVE ORDER.

There was an Act, called the "Emergency Management Act" that was
passed in 1935. This act says that the President can issue
Executive Orders in times of National Emergency. Since that time,
we have *always* had a declared state of "National Emergency" in the
United States, even though you didn't know it. You can find these
"declarations of National Emergency" in the Combined Federal
Register and the records of Congress. We are in one right now. Many
Executive Orders have been issued since then. The order inacting
FEMA is one of them. Since only Congress has the authority to
appropriate funds, the Executive Order creating this agency is
unconstitutional or, at best, it should have remained unfunded.]

An Executive Order, whether Constitutional or not, becomes effective
upon publication in the Federal Register. Congress is by-passed.

General Richard Secord and Lt. Col. Oliver North who orchestrated
the Iran-Contra operation that smuggled in weapons and cocaine to
this country, using our CIA and US Air Force to do it, was in charge
of FEMA for several years, during which it grew into the monster it
is today.

Some of the black helicopter traffic reported throughout the United
States are flown by FEMA personnel. FEMA has been given
responsibility for many new disasters, in addition to floods,
hurricanes, and earthquakes, including: urban forest fires, home
heating emergencies, refugee situations, urban riots, and emergency
planning for nuclear and toxic incidences.

In the West, FEMA works "in conjunction with" the 6th Army.

FEMA has only spent about 6% of its budget on National Emergencies.
The bulk of their funding has been used for the construction of
secret underground facilities to "assure continuity of government in
case of a major emergency, foreign or domestic" and to build prisons
and "holding facilties" under the designation of "refugee
facilities" (which have never been used for holding refugees).

---- Executive Order #12148 created the Federal Emergency Management Agency
that is to interface with the Department of Defense for civil defense
planning and funding. An "emergency Czar" was appointed.

---- Executive Order #12656 appointed the National Security Council as the
principal body that should consider emergency powers. This allows the
government to increase domestic surveillance of U.S. citizens and restrict
freedom of movement within the United States, granting to the government the
right to isolate large groups of civilians. The National Guard may be used
to seal all borders and take control of US air space and all ports of entry.

The following orders are written but not implemented and could be implemented
at any time, suspending the Constitution of the United States and using FEMA
to do it:

---- Executive Order #10990 - allows the government to take over all modes of
transportation and to control all highways and seaports.

---- Executive Order #10995 - allows the government to seize and control the
communication media.

---- Executive Order #10997 - allows the government to take over all
electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuel, and minerals.

---- Executive Order #10998 - allows the government to take over all food
resources and farms.

---- Executive Order #11000 - allows the government to mobilize civilians
into work brigades under government supervision.

---- Executive Order #11001 - allows the government to take over all health,
education, and welfare functions.

---- Executive Order #11002 - designates the Postmaster General to operate a
national registration of all persons.

---- Executive Order #11003 - allows the government to take over all airports
and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.

---- Executive Order #11004 - allows the housing and finance authorities to
relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to
be abandoned, and establish new areas for populations.

---- Executive Order #11005 - allows the government to take over railroads,
inland waterways, and public storage facilities.

---- Executive Order #11051 - specifies the responsibilities of the Office of
Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all executive orders into
effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial
crisis.

---- Executive Order #11310 - grants authority to the Department of Justice
to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial
support, to establish judicial and legislative liason, to control all aliens,
to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the
President.

---- Executive Order #11049 - assigns emergency preparedness function to
federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative executive
orders issued over a 15 year period.

---- Executive Order #11921 - allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness
agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of
production and distribution of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and
the flow of money in U.S. financial institutions in any undefined national
emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by
the President, Congress cannot review the action for 6 months.

COVERT ACTION INFORMATION BULLETIN
The Rise of the National Security State:

FEMA and the NSC

by Diana Reynolds

A STATE OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY

Since the advent of changes which took place during the Reagan
regime, America has been a presidential directive away from a
civil security state of emergency which, if ever enacted, could
create a constitutional crisis equal in severity to the American
Civil War.

A national state of emergency can be declared by a concurrent
resolution of both houses of Congress or by the President in the
case of natural disasters, nuclear war, a massive mobilization in
anticipation of an enemy attack on U.S. territory, or domestic
civil unrest.

A disturbing shift in policy occurred during the Reagan years
which could have profound consequences with respect to civil
liberties. Whereas civil defense planning in the past had focused
on disaster relief, the national security focus of the Reagan
administration meant implementing new ways to expand police powers
in times of nuclear war, domestic unrest, or civil disorder.

Bending under pressure brought by the Reagan Administration,
Congress gave the president and his executive agencies sweeping
emergency powers. This article will examine how those powers came
to be, and will explore a possible scenario--the U.S.
government's war on drugs--in which these powers might be used.

CIVIL SECURITY PLANNING

Since WWII, the U.S. government has had contingency plans in
preparation for a large scale disaster or attack. However, during
the last twenty-five years--beginning with civil unrest at the
height of the Vietnam War--the government's plans have
increasingly on focused ways of controlling political dissent.

On October 30, 1969 Presdent Richard Nixon issued Executive
Order 11490, "Assigning Emergency Preparedness Functions to
Federal Departments and Agencies," which consolidated some 21
operative Executive Orders and two Defense Mobilization Orders
issued between 1951 and 1966 on a variety of emergency
preparedness matters.

In 1976 President Gerald Ford ordered the Federal Emergency
Preparedness Agency (FEPA) to develop plans to establish
government control of the mechanisms of productions and
distribution of energy sources, wages and salaries, credit and
the flow of money in American financial institutions in any
(heretofore undefined) "national emergency." This
Executive Order (EO 11921) also indicated that, when a state of
emergency is declared by the President, Congress could not review
the matter for a period of six months.

Even arch-conservative activist Howard J. Ruff was quick to point
out that, since the enactment of EO 11490, "The only thing
standing between us and a dictatorship is the good character of
the President and the lack of a crisis severe enough that the
public would stand still for it."

While Ruff thought a national emergency might be used to destroy
the free markets in the U.S. and take away the C.B. radios and
guns of Americans, <The Washington Afro-American> was alarmed
for more rational and obvious reasons. In an editorial, the paper
repeated Ruff's warning:

  "Executive Order No. 11490 is real, and only the lack of a
  crisis big enough, a president willing enough, and a public
  aroused enough to permit it to be invoked, separates us from a
  possible dictatorship, brought about under current law, waiting to
  be implemented in the event of circumstances which can be
  construed as a `national emergency.'"

President Carter evidently did not share this concern and, in
1977, he signed Executive Order 12148 which created the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to replace the Federal
Emergency Preparedness Agency. This Presidential Directive
mandated an interface between the Department of Defense (DOD) and
FEMA for civil defense planning and funding.

When Ronald Reagan came to power he gave FEMA vastly expanded
executive emergency powers and appointed retired National Guard
General Louis O. Giuffrida as his "emergency czar."
Giuffrida's creation of contingency emergency plans to round up
"militant negroes" while he was at the Naval War College
caught the attention of then-Governor of California Reagan and his
executive secretary Edwin Meese III.

As Governor, Reagan called on Giuffrida to design Operation Cable
Splicer. Cable Splicer I, II and III were martial law plans to
legitimize the arrest and detention of anti-Vietnam war activists
and other political dissidents.

In 1971, Governor Reagan, with a $425,000 grant from the
Federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, established
a counterterrorism training center--the California Specialized
Training Institute (CSTI)--and made Giuffrida its commandant.

Shortly after he assumed the directorship of FEMA in 1981,
Giuffrida had flooded high-level FEMA posts with friends from CSTI
and the military police, had created a Civil Security Division of
FEMA, and had established a Civil Defense Training Center in
Emmitsburg, Maryland--based on the CSTI model. By 1984, the
Center had trained one thousand civil defense personnel in
survival techniques, counterterrorism and military police
methods.

From February to July of 1982, President Reagan signed a series of
National Security Decision Directives (NSDD)--presidential
decisions on national security objectives--on civil defense
policy and emergency mobilization preparedness. While Reagan's
real U.S. civil defense policy is contained in the classified NSDD
26, some of the law enforcement and public safety provisions of
the policy are made public in NSDD 47. This National Security
Decision Directive provides for an intensified counterintelligence
effort at home and the maintenance of law and order in a variety
of emergencies, particularly terrorist incidents, civil
disturbances, and nuclear emergencies.

Reagan gave the National Security Council (NSC) authority over the
planning for civil defense policy with its expanded civil security
powers. He mandated the creation of a senior-level
interdepartmental board, the Emergency Mobilization Preparedness
Board (EMPB), and charged it with responsibilities for policy and
planning guidance, coordination of planning, resolution of issues,
and monitoring progress.

The members of the EMPB were the Assistant for National Security
Affairs (as its Chair), the DOD's Secretary of Defense for Policy,
the Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and representatives
from 10 other federal agencies. FEMA provided the staff, support
secretariat and operational supervision for the EMPB and their
working group on civil defense. According to then Secretary of
Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, by February 1983, the EMPB had
prepared--and the President had approved--a national policy
statement on emergency mobilization preparedness.

Oliver North served on the EMPB, having been assigned there from
1982 to 1984 by former National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane.
General Giuffrida was there too, providing operational
supervision. By forming the EMPB, Ronald Reagan made it possible
for a small group of people, under the authority of the NSC, to
wield enormous power. They, in turn, used this executive
authority to change civil defense planning into a military/police
version of civil security.

MILITARY RULE

In January of 1982, FEMA and the Department of Defense issued a
joint paper entitled, "The Civil/Military Alliance in
Emergency Management" which specified many of the provisions
of Reagan's policy on emergency mobilization preparedness. This
document indicates that FEMA had been given <carte blanche>
emergency powers to acquire resources from federal and state
agencies (including National Guard personnel) and the private
sector (banking, communications, transportation, etc.) "for
use in civil disturbance operations."

Apparently General Frank S. Salcedo, Chief of FEMA's Civil
Security Division and Giuffrida's former colleague at CSTI, wanted
more. In 1983, in a workshop at the annual meeting of the Academy
of Criminal Justice Sciences, Salcedo recommended expanding FEMA's
power further in the areas of survivability training, research on
imposing martial law, and the potential threat posed by foreign
and domestic adversaries. As he saw it at least 100,000 U.S.
citizens, from survivalists to tax protesters, were serious
threats to civil security.

Salcedo saw FEMA's new frontier in the protection of industrial
and government leaders from assassination, and of civil and
military installations from sabotage and/or attack, as well as the
prevention of dissident groups from gaining access to U.S. opinion
or a global audience in times of crisis.

"THIS IS ONLY A TEST, REPEAT..."

While improving capabilities to respond to civil security
emergencies was for the most part a planning activity with the
Reagan Administration, FEMA was also active in exercises to test
these plans. In 1981, FEMA and DOD began a continuing tradition of
biannual joint exercises to test civilian mo,bil,ization, civil
security emergency and counterterrorism plans using such names as
"Proud Saber/Rex-82," "Pre-Nest," and
"Rex-84/Night Train."

The Rex-84 Alpha Explan (Readiness Exercise 1984, Exercise Plan),
indicates that FEMA in association with 34 other federal civil
departments and agencies conducted a civil readiness exercise
during April 5-13, 1984. It was conducted in coordination and
simultaneously with a Joint Chiefs exercise, Night Train 84, a
worldwide military command post exercise (including Continental
U.S. Forces or CONUS) based on multi-emergency scenarios operating
both abroad and at home. In the combined exercise, Rex-84 Bravo,
FEMA and DOD led the other federal agencies and departments,
including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Secret Service, the
Treasury, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Veterans
Administration through a gaming exercise to test military
assistance in civil defense.

The exercise anticipated civil disturbances, major demonstrations
and strikes that would affect continuity of government and/or
resource mobilization. To fight subversive activities, there was
authorization for the military to implement government ordered
movements of civilian populations at state and regional levels,
the arrest of certain unidentified segments of the population, and
the imposition of martial rule.

Attorney General William French Smith finally became aware of the
abuses of the Emergency Mobilization Preparedness Board operating
under the NSC. He admonished McFarlane, Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, who theoretically chaired
the planning group. In a letter dated August 2, 1984, Smith
responded to a request by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) to review, for form and legality, a draft Executive Order
revising the powerful EO 11490, assigning emergency preparedness
functions to federal departments and agencies. The Attorney
General said that apart from the legal review by the Office of
Legal Counsel,

  "...I believe that the draft Executive Order raises
  serious substantive and public policy issues that should be
  further addressed before this proposal is submitted to the
  President. In short I believe that the role assigned to the
  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on the revised
  Executive Order exceeds its proper function as a coordinating
  agency for emergency preparedness.

  "This Department and others have repeatedly raised
  serious policy and legal objections to the creation of an
  `emergency czar' role for FEMA. Specific policy concerns regarding
  recent FEMA initiatives include the abandonment of the principle
  of `several' agency responsibility and the expansion of the
  definition of severe emergencies to encompass `routine' domestic
  law enforcement emergencies. Legal objections relate to the
  absence of Presidential or Congressional authorization for
  unilateral FEMA directives which seek to establish new Federal
  Government management structures or otherwise task Cabinet
  departments and other federal agencies.

THE FALL OF FEMA

Smith's letter signaled what seemed to be the beginning of the end
for FEMA and Reagan's Emergency Mobilization Preparedness Board.
Federal Bureau of Investigation Director William Webster had
previously complained when FEMA's Director of Civil Security,
General Salcedo, had intruded into the FBI's domestic intelligence
jurisdiction under the rubric of counter terrorism. Salcedo was
forced to turn over to Webster some 12,000 names he had been
compiling on a list of potential threats to civil security.

Furthermore, it came to light that while FEMA had been expending
the lon's share of its energy and funding on building a civil
security infrastructure, it had neglected its authorized civil
defense role. On June 15, 1984, barely a month after Giuffrida
filed his glowing accomplishment report with Meese, Robert Guffus,
Inspector General of FEMA, wrote a draft report on FEMA's
Comprehensive Cooperative Agreements (CCA) (with states) in civil
defense preparedness.

He concluded that management actions were needed to improve the
effectiveness of programs with state and local governments. In his
review of the CCAs he found inadequate FEMA management control,
imprecise program guidelines and a lack of personnel resources.
Programmatic and financial weaknesses were a result of fiscal
mis-management, unclear assignment of responsibilities,
overlapping job descriptions, inflated training figures, and lack
of written procedures.

McFarlane removed North from the EMPB and assigned him to help
with conducting unconventional warfare in Nicaragua. Giuffrida
resigned in 1985 after a House subcommittee charged that  FEMA was
being mismanaged, and it was publicized that Giuffrida had staffed
FEMA with his military/police cronies and had allowed $170,000 of
agency funds to be used to outfit a deluxe bachelor pad at the
Civil Defense Training Academy at Emmitsburg. He now operates a
security consulting firm in Washington, D.C. General Salcedo has
moved on to be Presidential Liaison to Veterans Organizations at
the Veterans Administration.

There is some debate about what happened to the plans for a civil
security emergency. There was a rumored joint investigation
conducted by the Defense Department and the CIA into the
unconstitutionality of planning for a civil security emergency by
several government agencies. Supposedly, the two investigators,
Special Forces Lt. Colonel Kvererdas and the CIA's William
Buckley, prior to his fatal Beirut assignment, destroyed the plans
and the exercise data.

Some believe that much of the planning was incorporated into Vice
President Bush's Report from his Task Force on Combatting
Terrorism which has inspired civil security contingency planning
at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service by an Alien
Border Control (ABC) Committee. The working group within the INS
was designing plans and programs regarding the control and removal
of alien terrorists, potential terrorist aliens and those "who
are likely to be supportive of terrorist acti within the
U.S."

The most obvious resting place for the material is the National
Security Council. In 1987, Reagan signed another NSDD, number
259, which superseded both NSDD 26, the secret civil defense plan
of February 25, 1982 and the unclassified version dated March 16,
1982. Even though the 1987 version is shorter and more vague than
its predecessors, no significant changes are evident in civil
defense planning and programs from the 1984 EMPB scenarios.

Just before he left office, Reagan signed Executive Order 12656
which assigned new emergency preparedness responsibilities.
Reagan's final national security legacy to civil defense planning
puts the NSC clearly in charge. In Section 104, EO 12656 states
that the NSC is the principal forum for consideration of national
security emergency preparedness policy and will arrange for
Executive branch liaison with, and assistance to, the Congress and
the Federal judiciary on national security emergency preparedness
matters.

The Director of FEMA has now been promoted to advisor to the NSC
on mobilization preparedness, civil defense, continuity of
government, technological disasters, "and other issues, as
appropriate." The Director of FEMA is also authorized to
assist in the implementation of national security emergency
preparedness policy by coordinating federal departments and
agencies; as well as state and local governments. The exercise
program is to continue and plans and procedures "will be
designed and developed to provide maximum flexibility to the
President for his implementation of emergency actions."

On the same day that Reagan signed EO 12656 he also signed the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 which provided yet another in a series
of get-tough-but-do-nothing drug policies produced by the Reagan
Administration. If and when the Anti-Drug Abuse Act fails--a
victim of underfunding and bureaucratic in-fighting--then
Executive Order 12656 could become an historic document in the war
on drugs.

THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE AND THE DRUG WAR

The U.S. government's proposed "war on drugs" is one such
case in which the U.S. government will have the authority to use
the national security apparatus to suppress civil liberties. It
may be the first opportunity to call into action the years of
planning and expense used to develop the emergency preparedness
network.

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act was passed in the final hours of the 100th
Congress, when incumbents were anxious to return to their
districts in order to campaign and when public opinion was calling
for drastic action in the war on drugs. The Act was quickly
drafted by <ad hoc> congressional committees and private
consultants, then passed by Congress without the usual legislative
hearings and debate.

The Act broadly defines the programs, goals, guidelines and
appropriations for all the 58 federal departments plus the
thousands of state and local agencies involved in the national war
on drugs. Some provisions were made for drug education,
prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, but much of the text
focuses on the punitive measures to be taken by the government.

The anti-drug policy authorizes the use of the U.S. military to
assist in the drug war at home. If you live in federal housing or
if you reside in large urban areas such as New York, Boston, Washington
DC, or Los Angeles--where crime and addiction have
turned neighborhoods into combat zones--this Act will authorize
the military to fence off your streets, keep track of who comes
from and goes to your home, stop and frisk you, your friends and
family, and regularly inspect your home and belongings. If you or
anyone who visits you is suspected by the authorities of using,
selling or trafficking in any kind of illicit narcotic substance,
you can be evicted from your home whether your landlord is the
government or a private party.

The Act increases state powers in the areas of government
surveillance, intelligence gathering, and seizure of private property.
It authorizes regional intelligence sharing centers, which
not only compile statistics but provide contracts to states, local
criminal justice agencies, and non-profit organizations for
purposes of identifying, targeting and removing criminal
conspiracies and activities spanning jurisdictional boundaries.

The Justice Department is given the power to confiscate private
property and deny state and federal entitlement by decree. Once
caught, even casual marijuana users could be subject to the
confiscation of their homes, cars, and bank accounts. The
government seizure takes place through civil proceedings where the
burden is on the defendant to prove his or her innocence, unlike
the "innocent until proven guilty" due process guarantee
of criminal proceedings.

A NATIONAL DRUG CZAR

William Bennett, as the Director of the Office of National Drug
Policy, is an adviser to and voting member of the National
Security Council. It is here in the NSC that the ultimate drug
war could be fought. All it would take is a President determined
enough, a Congress pliant enough, and people desperate enough for
the drug war in America to be declared a national security
emergency. If and when that happens, the NSC--as part of civil
emergency preparedness--would be in charge of its implementation
under the guidance of the President.

A national security emergency would without a doubt decrease drug
use in America. The government would be authorized to increase
domestic intelligence and surveillance of U.S. citizens. State
security measures would be enhanced by restricting the freedom of
movement within the U.S. and granting the government authority to
relocate large groups of civilians at will. The U.S. Continental
Forces and a federalized National Guard could seal off borders and
take control of U.S. airspace, all ports of entry, and interstate
highways.

It was James Madison's worst nightmare that a
righteous faction would some day be strong enough to sweep away
the constitutional restraints, designed by the framers to prevent
the tyranny of centralized power, executive privilege and
arbitrary government authority over the individual.

These restraints, the balancing  and checking of powers among branches
and layers of government and the civil guarantees contained in the
Bill of Rights would be the first casualties in a drug-induced
national security state with Reagan's civil emergency preparedness
unleashed.

Nevertheless, there will be those who will welcome the National
Security Council into the drug fray, believing that increasing
state police powers to emergency levels is the only way left to
fight America's enemy within. In the short run, a national
security state would probably be a relief to those whose personal
security and quality of life has been diminished by drugs or drug
related crime. And as the general pblic watches the progression
of institutional chaos and social decay, they too may be willing
to pay the ultimate price: one drug-free America for 200 years of
democracy.

		Exploding Pen
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	This little gem will make a small explosive device out of a regular
	clicking pen. Enjoy!!


Materials:
----------

1       Clicking Ball Point Pen
	Gun Powder or Black Powder
8-10    Match Heads
1       Match Stick
1       Sheet of Sandpaper

	Unscrew the pen and remove all the parts but leave the button in the
top of the pen. Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where
the other little parts and the ink fill was. Roll sandpaper up and put 
around the match stick that is in the clicker. Put the remaining match heads
inside the pen, make sure that they are on the inside on the sandpaper. Put a
small piece of paper in the other end of the pen where the ball point comes
out. Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gunpowder. The paper is
to keep the powder from spilling. It should look like this:

Small Paper Clog                Gunpowder       Matches & Sandpaper

		Mousetrap Switch
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Materials:       
----------

1       Mousetrap
1       Hacksaw or File
	Some connecting wires

	Remove the trip lever from the mousetrap using the hacksaw or file.
Also remove the staple and golding wire. Retract the striker of the mousetrap
and attach the trip lever across the end of the wood base using the staple
with which the holding wire was attached. (If the trip lever is not made of
metal, a piece of metal of approximately the same size should be used.) Strip
one inch of insulation from the ends of 2 connecting wires. Wrap one wire 
tightly around the spring loaded striker of the mousetrap. Wrap the second
wire around some part of the trip lever or piece of metal. (If a soldering
iron is available, solder both of the above wires in place.)
	
	One way to use, is place the switch inside a box which contains the
eplosive and the batteries. The spring loaded striker is held back by the lid
of the box and when the box is opened, the circuit is closed.

	--------------------------------------------------------

		Coin Changer Fraud
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	You need a coin changing machine and a dollar. Look at which way the
dollar goes in. Take some ink that is DARK BLUE (black and green) and run        
the whole side of the dollar (the right side) thru the ink. Get it dark
blue about 1/4" into the bill. If the dollar goes in the long way first,
then left side of the dollar with ink. Now insert the dollar. If you are
lucky, it will come out, with part of the ink pushed back to the point the
dollar went in furthest. Mark that point. (The ink should still be wet!)
Now get a ruler and measure the distance between the first part of the bill
that goes in, and where the ink stopped. Be VERY accurate! Do this 5 or 6
times!! With this measurement, you can cut a small (1/8" slit) into the bill
like so:

		____________________
		|#####
       ink----> |#####             |
		|#####             |
       slit--->  =========         |
		|/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\|

       Now, if you insert the dollar, and the measurement is correct, the
money will spring back out, and the change will come out too! Usually the
dollar only works a few times, because once it starts to unstiffen (a new 
dollar is a good dollar!), is stops working and you only get your dollar back
or just the change.

		Butane Bomb
		-=-=-=-=-=-

	(Originally written by FBI and edited by Low-Life)


    Well, this bomb was constructed by us in an attempt to not only make an
antipersonnel device which was easy to construct, but also to create the
biggest fireball that the world has ever seen.  So, you get the power of pure
butane, with the added advantage of simplicity in construction...have phun!

    1.  A Cannister of Butane Fuel: Easy to obtain, this can be found at just
	about any good drugstore, certainly at a hardware store.
    2.  Gun Powder: See above.
    3.  Plastic Container: Preferably a TupperWare-(tm) glass, as it will both
	melt away and explode, while glass will shatter with heat, and metal
	will not explode.
    4.  A Fuse: You can buy these in places, but if you don't want to go thru
	the hassle, simply rub model glue all over a string, it'll work just
	as well.
    5.  Masking Tape: Or electrical tape, or cellophane tape, or whatever kind
	of tape that you've got lying 'round the house.
 
 Assembly:

    1.  Fill the plastic container with 1/4 to 1/2 inch of powder.
    2.  Center the butane in the container, atop the powder.
    3.  Fill the rest of the container with powder, around the butane.  Pack
	it down -- lightly, just so that it fully fills in the container.
    4.  Insert the fuse at least 1/2 inch into the powder, and pack the
	surrounding powder as in step 3.  Seal the top of the container around
	the butane with a small covering of masking tape.
    5.  Plant the device in a target area.
    6.  Light the fuse, and...
    7.  RUN LIKE HELL!!
    8.  (Detonation): If this is done correctly, and you get well out of range
	of the fireball, the immediate, (and non-immediate), area will be "up
	in smoke," persay.

 Use propane instead of Butane.
 Use an oxygen tank along with the butane/propane.(BIG WHITE BOOM!!)
 Ever see those HUGE propane canisters used in outdoor BBQ's? Get the idea?!?
 No oxygen tanks?? Use Whipped Cream(in the spray container)
 No butane/propane?? Use WD40 or other aerosols!! (WD40 and other lubricants 
 are the best tho)

All of these should make your little butane bomb capable of nuking a city..
Or.. just drop yours off by the local propane cylinder exhange at your corner
store.. heh heh..

Of course.. there are those HUGE propane canisters.(6-20 ft long!!)
those would be fun to watch.

		Ammonium Nitrate
		-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Ammonium Nitrate is easily found in instant cold packs in your
	local drugstore. Just break them open and the AN is the white 
	crystalline powder you find inside with a pack of water.

	Ammonium nitrate is used in the making of dynamite and other
	explosive compounds like nitroglycerin, picric acid, etc. due to
	the amount of oxygen it furnishes.
