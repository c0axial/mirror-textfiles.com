AN OPEN LETTER TO ATARI CORP


Here's a proposal for Atari.  It seems to me (from what I've heard at
the superworkstation company I'm working for this summer and experienced
during three years at Stanford University) that there are a few things
Atari needs to do now to avoid _losing_ market share as well as to gain
more.  This starts out sounding negative, but ends up positive so bear
with me.  Any replies are welcomed.

Dear Atari: 

1. Even people who _know_ about the Atari ST computers see them as
   stagnant, especially as far as graphics are concerned.  Someone
   who works with me (and is very familiar with Macintosh II computers)
   was shocked to hear that we only had 512 colors available.  His
   response was -Do you mean at one time?-  Then when he heard sixteen
   at one time, his interest ended.  It shouldn't be too difficult to
   modify SHIFTER and the MMU to provide, say, 256 colors in low rez,
   and sixteen in medium from a palette of 4096 or more.  While you're
   at it, how about making the MMU support 8 or 16 meg?  For the graphics,
   all you have to do is read more information at a time.  You could
   still support the same monitors.  Or how about gray scaling on the
   graphics, even using the same resolutions as the current ST monitors,
   you'd sell twice as many computers and regain the interest of the
   academic world. 

2. The same people see the ST as a dead end.  It's not even possible to
   upgrade the memory without soldering or buying -special trick-
   boards which plug into all sorts of different sockets.  How about
   using SIMM's like everyone else, Atari?  You could make ST's easy to
   expand (what a concept!).  I find it hard to believe that even your
   -high end- Mega computers can't be expanded.  (And many others too.) 

3. Three cheers for the GDOS installation program!  That's the right way
   to go.  For one thing, GDOS is a very advanced system as graphics go.
   biggest problem has been that people can't figure out how to use it.
   Your installation program makes that easy!  I couldn't believe what a
   simple matter it was to change from high resoultion to medium 
   resoultion fonts on my boot disk.  One thing I really think you do 
   need is outline fonts, though.  People familiar with Macintosh expect
   to have a good number of fonts available.  This is easy when your 
   printer fonts are the same as your screen fonts, (as in the Macintosh
   computer), but to be device independent has its price in memory.  If 
   you can implement scalable outline fonts _in_ _addition_ _to_ raster 
   fonts (like current GDOS fonts), people with little memory will be 
   able to use a variety of fonts, and those with more memory will still
   be able to enjoy the speed of raster fonts.  All this without 
   rewriting anything but the device drivers and GDOS! 

4. Few people know that Atari makes computers, and many of those who
   do don't think very much of them.  I suggest that you make up a large
   number of bumper or window stickers that have a brightly colored 
   Fugi on them with the words -Atari Personal Computers- or something to
   that effect.  You might want a picture of an ST and a MEGA.  I see
   people all over with Apple stickers on their cars, and I think that
   if you distributed these, free of charge, to user groups and people
   who wrote requesting them (even on GEnie) you would get widespread,
   -advertising without the price.-  Be sure to put the word computer
   on them! 

5. Finally, a good educational discount is essential!  When students
   get a computer, that's often what their parents end up with, and
   that's the computer they'll lean towards when _they_ are making the
   purchasing decisions for their company when they graduate.  To get
   this going, you will need to compete with Apple.  Atari will probably
   need to donate a few computers and a laser printer or at least offer
   them a deal they can't refuse.  Stanford students buy Macintoshes
   not only because they can find them (at a very good price) at the
   Stanford bookstore, but also because they can go to the library and
   print their papers on an Imagewriter there (or, for a price, on an
   Apple LaserWriter).

Please keep in mind that these opinions have been formulated over my 
very nearly three years as an ST owner.  I believe in my computer's 
potential, and in that of Atari, but other people still need convincing.
Don't rest on your laurels, Atari!  The Amiga already has more flexible
graphics, and the 2000 model's memory, CPU, and graphics are upgradeable!

                                                      Steve Whitney
                                                       S.WHITNEY

Editor Note:  We felt this letter made some very strong and valid points
for the Atari Genius Designers to ponder..thanks Steve, maybe ..just maybe
they may listen or perhaps a third party developer will release an
expansion cabinet that will allow us to use expansion cards etc...

ICD UPDATE

NOTICE to all 8-bit Atari Users:

This is a report of the progress of the much anticipated SpartaDOS X.

===================================

As of 8/11/88 SpartaDOS X (SDX) is 99% completed.  Over the next few days
we will be finishing the new MENU and tying up a few loose ends.  We still
have much work to complete on the manual but we expect to be shipping in
September. Outside beta testers have been working with SDX for almost 1
month and it has been thoroughly tested in house much longer than that.

SDX includes 64K of the tightest machine code ever written.  This is all
in our special X cartridge which allows you to plug a language cartridge
into the top.  SDX has complete control over this cartridge allowing it
to turn it on and off as desired.

SDX offers the most free memory of any available DOS!  Presently MEMLO
can be as low as $0E22 with no handlers installed in an extended memory
machine like the 130XE.  64K machines have MEMLO at $12D1.  Of course
handlers push MEMLO up but MEMLO should still be lower than SpartaDOS 2.3!

High Speed data transfer is standard on stock Indus GT drives, Atari XF551
drives, US Doubler enhanced 1050 drives, and Happy 1050 drives. All
densities are supported (single, dual, and double) single and double sided
drives are supported from 40 to 80 tracks, 3 1/2, 5 1/4, and 8-.

Hard drives on our Multi I/O are handled with ease!  The files per
directory limit has been increased to 1424 files!  Support has been added
for hidden files along with an archive bit for backup.

SpartaDOS X now also supports the old 800 computer!  An Axlon compatible
RAM upgrade is required for it to be useful but it will actually work in
a 48K machine with BASIC and  other relocatable languages.  With an AXLON
type RAM board, MEMLO is below $1000!  A 48K stock machine will have a
MEMLO just above $3000.
                             
SpartaDOS X batch files now support parameter passing.  16 I/O channels
are now included!  9 drive support allows D9: as a RAMDISK.  Up to 1 MEG
Ramdisks are supported aslong as they conform to 'standard' banking
methods.

ICD has developed ARC as part of SpartaDOS X!  This is very close to the
IBM version 5.22 of ARC by SEA. Many of the X cart routines are used for
exceptional speed.  SDX ARC is the fastest and most efficient file
compactor available on an 8-bit computer.  As a bonus, our ARC will De-ALF
your ALFed files!

ARC Usage:

ARC cmd[opt] arcfn [flist]

Where -cmd- is one of:
a : add file(s) to archive
m : move file(s) to archive
u : update file(s) in archive
f : freshen file(s) in archive
d : delete file(s) from archive
x,e : extract file(s) from archive
p : copy file(s) to screen
l : list file(s) in archive
v : show storage method of file(s)

Valid -opt- options are:
b : retain backup copy of archive
s : suppress compression (store only)
w : suppress warning messages
n : suppress notes and comments
h : higher speed (screen off)
g : encrypt/decrypt archive entry (followed by password - must be last
    option)

-arcfn- is archive filename (drive, path, and ext are optional)

-flist- is the list of files to extract, add, list, etc. in the archive.
Wildcards are allowed in each filename.  -*.*- is assumed if no filename
is given.

Future options for SpartaDOS X are:
a Developers Tool Kit, Database program, and XEP80 handler if there is
enough demand for it.

TECHNICAL CORNER (Wico Trackball & Atari ST)
by George Robbins

Per request, I am reposting the original article on converting WICO and
perhaps Atari 2600 trackballs to mouse-compatible devices.  While I have
not tried the conversion, what the original author describes seems to be
quite reasonable.

One other approach that might be easier would be to obtain a spare mouse,
extract the little logic board and attach it to the various LEDs, photo-
sensors and switches...

The original article in comp.sys.amiga describes how to convert WICO and
Atari 2600 track balls to work with the Amiga.  Converting for the Atari
ST is essentially the same, except for some disagreement between Atari and
CBM on which quadrature signals go to which -joystick- lines.

Pin     Amiga                   Atari
===     =====                   =====
1       Vertical                X-B
2       Horizontal              X-A
3       Vertical-Quatrature     Y-A
4       Horizontal-Quadrature   Y-B
5       Pot X                   N.C.
6       Left Button             Left Button
7       +5V                     +5V     
8       Ground                  Ground
9       Pot Y-Right Button      Right Button

As you can see, the pin-outs are compatible enough that no harm will result
if the two are interchanged, however since the quadrature outputs don't

match up you will get pointless twitching instead of useful motion.  Simply
switch the wires going to pins 1 thru 4 until you get it right.

A minor problem is that the WICO trackballs are discontinued, so unless you
already know where to find one, you may have problems.

Original (corrected) article from blgardne@esunix.UUCP (Blaine Gardner):
Title: Wico trackball mouse VERSION 2.0 (BUG FIX & ATARI NOTE)

Ok, here it is, sorry I took so long to post it. I have tried to make this
understandable, if you don't know what an LM 339 or a DB9 is, maybe you
shouldn't try this.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wico track ball modification.

Converting the Wico track ball into an Amiga mouse compatible track ball
is a fairly simple procedure. But if you are uncomfortable with a soldering
iron, get some competent help.

    You could damage your Amiga if you make a mistake when
    assembling this project! You could also void your Amiga
    warranty! You will definitly void your trackball warranty!

                   YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

Ok, now that that's out of the way here are the gory details. The stock
trackball contains a small pc board, this will be removed and replaced
with one containing an LM 339 quad comparator.

The comparator simply converts the output of the opto-coupler to a TTL
level pulse. Both the X and Y axis use two emitter-detector pairs. The
output of each of these detectors is fed through one of the comparators.
The output of the comparator is then fed to the Amiga's mouse port. Since
the output of the trackball will be identical to the mouse's output, the
modified trackball will work with ALL software that uses the mouse.

Here we go!

Remove the 6 (six) screws from the bottom of the trackball case and open
it (right-side-up please). In the lower-right corner there is a small pc
board with two connectors. Remove the board & connectors. You can toss the
board, and the cable that has the joystick connector. (The cable only has
7 wires and we need 8. You can scrounge the 11 pin male header off of the
board.)

Cut a piece of perf board the same size as the original board. Just make
sure it fits in the same place as the original. The plastic grooves will
hold it perfectly.

Two cautions here: make sure the top can be screwed down without hanging
up on the new board, and make sure all your components will clear the
standoff near the board!

Using the (crude) schematics below, wire up the circuit. You will need to
drill a hole in the case to mount a second switch (for the right button).
Make sure the second switch will clear all existing hardware! Wire the
second switch between ground and pin 9 on the DB 9 connector.

It is a good idea to place a medium sized capacitor (10-20 uf) across +5
and ground where power enters the perf board.

There it is! The above information was obtained from the Amiga Hardware
Reference Manual, and from tearing apart my mouse & trackball and trace-
ing out the schematics myself. (Mostly from tearing my hardware apart!)

Any errors in the above information are mine (but for a few hours work
they can be yours too! |^) ), not Evans & Sutherland's. They are kind
enough to pay me to play with their computers, they have no control over
my ramblings here on usenet.

The above infomation is the correct version. In my first posting + 5 volts
and button 2 were switched on the DB9 pinouts.

There have been a lot of inquiries about doing the same modification on 
the Atari 2600 trackball. I hadn't seen the Atari untill two days ago, but
I can now tell you that the same procedure will work for it. In fact it is
a little easier on the Atari trackball because the LM339 is already present.

Just remove all the components from the board except the 339, the supply
voltage filter (inductor + electrolytic cap near the 6 pin header), and
resistors R9 - R18. Actually you'll have to remove those too because they
are the wrong values, and the 339 socket blocks several traces that need
to be cut. (As I remember 430K and 10K should be swapped for 100K and 3.3K
respectively.)

The biggest problem is that Atari wired the 339 as a non-inverting
comparator, and Amiga uses an inverting comparator. So you'll have to CUT
AND JUMPER (those that flinched may leave the room) to get the inverted
configuration (see above data for the correct circuit).

I don't plan to do a detailed plan for the Atari trackball, if the above
information doesn't mean much, don't try it yourself.

This general plan should work for all trackballs that use a pair of opto-
couplers on each axis. The old TG trackball for the Apple II (and probably
other computers) will NOT work since it uses a pair of pots.

I hope this helps all you hardware hackers that can't live without a real
trackball. Have fun, and don't blow up your Amiga!

YMODEM DOWNLOADING ON GENIE
Ctsy GEnie Services

by Marty Albert (GEnie SysOp)

(C) 1988 by Atari Corporation, GEnie, and the Atari Roundtables.  May be
reprinted only with this notice intact.  The Atari Roundtables on GEnie
are *official* information services of Atari Corporation. To sign up for
GEnie service, call (with modem) 800-638-8369.  Upon connection type HHH
(RETURN after that).  Wait for the U#= prompt. Type XJM11877,GEnie and hit
RETURN.  The system will prompt you for your information.

                                FILE NAMES
     
Due to the recent implimentation of Ymodem downloads on GEnie, we must
place a few rules in effect for the names of files uploaded to and posted
in the Atari 8-bit RoundTable Libraries.
     
These rules are so designed to allow the Ymodem terminal programs to
correctly open and save the downloaded file.
     
When you do a Ymodem download, GEnie sends the file name exactly as it
appears in the directory of files.  If the terminal program receives a file
name that is not a -legal- Atari file name, one of two things will happen:

   1>  The file will not be saved at all and the transfer may abort.
   2>  The file will be saved with a -bad- name and you will not be able
       to access and use the file.

In either case, the file would be worthless and you would have just wasted
your time and money doing a download.  This is far from what you had in
mind when you decided to download the file!

                                  NOTICE
     
ALL FILES UPLOADED TO THE ATARI 8-BIT ROUNDTABLE LIBRARIES MUST FOLLOW
THESE RULES!  ANY FILES THAT HAVE ILLEGAL NAMES WILL BE RENAMED BY THE
SYSOPS TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES AS STATED BELOW!
                                       
The rules are simple and, we hope, not too restrictive.  Please make sure
that your uploaded files meet the requirements when you upload them.

                                  RULES

#1.   File names may not contain any spaces.

#2.   File names may not contain any punctuation marks other than a single
      period <.> to seperate the file name and extender ala Atari DOS <ie;
      filename.ext>.  EXCEPTION -- Files that state clearly that they are
      for use with SpartaDOS *only* may have the underline character < _ >
      in them.

#3.   File names must start with a letter as the first character.

#4.   File names may be any length up to the maximum that GEnie supports.
      (Your DOS will drop anything more than eight characters before the
      period)

#5.   The extender should be as per the help file FILETYPE.HLP and should
      be descriptive of the type of file that you are uploading.

#6.   If you are uploading several related files, be sure that the names
      you select will each be different when only the first eight
      characters and the extension are considered.  (ie; FILETEST1.TXT
      and FILETEST2.TXT would end up having the same file name
      <FILETEST.TXT> but FILE1TEST.TXT and FILE2TEST.TXT would be
      different)  If this is the case, please consider using AlfCrunch or
      ARC to group the files into one larger file.

                                DISCLAIMER

The SysOps have made every effort to ensure that the file names now in use
in the Atari 8-Bit RoundTable Library are fully compatable with the Ymodem
download protocol.  Each and every file has been examined and modified as
needed to conform to the above rules.

GEnie, the SysOps, and Atari Corp. assume no responsiblity for the failure
of a file to download with Ymodem other than to rename the file as needed
upon notice from a user that the file has failed to download.

                                CONCLUSION
     
If you find a file that for any reason will not download using Ymodem,
please drop a note to MARTY.A or CRAIG.S.THOM as soon as possible!  We will
fix the file name and get back to you.
     
If you have a question about how to download with Ymodem, please see the
file called YMODEM.HLP.  After reading this file, if you still have
unanswered questions, please send GE-Mail to MARTY.A or CRAIG.S.THOM and
we'll be happy to help you get started.

ST REPORT CONFIDENTIAL #47 
==========================

New York City  The ST game system persists and does, for all intents and
-------------  purposes, exist.  Seems this firm was given the inside
               track to being the first one to be able to sell the -new- 
               game system

Sunnyvale      The portable ST is a full scale reality, seems it's even
---------      nicer than the one displayed at Hanover.

Denver         A number of dealers have unified and are preparing a formal
------         request to be sent to Atari asking for more sales oriented
               professional area representatives.

Albany         IBM has now gone after the midi market with a vengeance,
------         with a keyboard that has both the video and audio
               controllers built in and full audio spectrum available 
               with full video potential also available.

Sunnyvale      Transputer system is a fact but not for the USA for many
---------      months to come.. watch for it in Europe (UK) first.
