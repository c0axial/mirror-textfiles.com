Z*Magazine: #208

This issue was released as an .arc file containing many small text files.  I
have appended them all together into this document, with no further editing
besides these comments.  For lack of a better system, I chose to append the
text files together in alphabetical order by the names of the files.

I have done this completely without permission from the publishers of
Z*Magazine.  Actually, there isn't even any evidence that it was the publishers
of Z*Mag that collected these files.

This issue is almost entirely Lynx games reviews.  For the 8-bit Atari computer
user there is: A review by Jeff McWilliams of the Newell 1088K product, and: my
-Perusing the Internet- column.

At first glance this game seems impressive, but after playing this game
for some time I feel as though it could have been improved.  It was too
much like all the -jet-fighter- arcade games, just the same thing over
and over.  I will admit though that it does allow you to destroy ground
targets unlike any other arcade game other than G-LOC.

I hate the fact that you can't really turn around and attack what you
just flew over, and I don't like having the airplane right in the middle
of the screen blocking my view.  But the animation is amazing.

This game is visually impressive, and was a sell-out during the Persian
Gulf War.  The gameplay is quite simple, even though there are 9 different
missions.  This is one of the only Lynx games that even a small child
could play well.  I prefer more complex, thought provoking challenges.
Nevertheless, this is an excellent game to show off the Lynx's graphics
and animation capabilities to prospective Lynx buyers.

Since this game is really 4 in 1 I'd like to add the following about each
section:
   BMX  Good-It's a lot of fun, the detail in the graphics is great.  Really
challenging.  In order of fun this one would come in second of the 4 games.
   SURFING  Great graphics and animation.  This is the event to most benefit
from linking up with another person.  It is also the most fun alone.
Out of the 4 events this is the most fun best out of the 4.
   HALFPIPE  The most difficult to learn, but very easy once you know how. A
lot of fun but very limited in actions available.  (Well, they all kind of are
but this one more so.)  Out of the 4 it is tie for 2nd (w/BMX) for fun.
   FOOTBAG  Others may like but this is BORING!  It does offer more moves than
Halfpipe skateboarding but WHO CARES!  However, for whatever reason, I LOVE the
scenery.  The flowing river, the bridge, it all looks great!  The only fun I
ever had with Footbag was when I linked up with someone and kept tripping them.
But that's been it.  Out of 4 it comes in third for fun.  (If I was to rate it
on a scale of 1-10, it wouldn't make the scale!)

CA Games is of course the oldest Lynx game I have, but it is still one of the
most enjoyable.  I certainly can claim that I play it more often than any
other Lynx game from the first half dozen that came out.  That of course,
attests to its long term playability, but that is due to other features
too...although simple in concept, it is a blast to play multiplayer CA Games
- even with the early 'buggy' version of the ComLynx software.  Also, this is
one of the only Lynx games that I get so engrossed in that I find myself
flexing my legs and moving my Lynx back and forth while trying to surf and
skateboard.  And even going for 50,000+ on Foot Bag sets my nerves on end! Of
course none of these events would have survived on its own.  Perhaps this
concept should have been applied to another Lynx game--RoboSquash!

Even though this was the first game I ever played for the Lynx, I still
have a blast trying to beat my high score in surfing and BMX.  To this
day I cannot help myself from twitching while doing a quad in surfing
or doing a triple forward flip in BMX.

When I got my Lynx I thought this was a nice graphics and sound demo, but was
immediately bored.  There is no gameplay.  It is fun to try to knock people
off their surf board.  I got a lot of laughs watching the surfer fall.

California Games is one game that I first got when i bought my LYNX.
At first I kind of ignored it and pushed it aside because I was more
into the action and arcade sort of games, but when my friend Donny challenged
me to a game and soundly whipped my butt I really got into it, vowing
for revenge.  After a while I started getting into it majorly.  Donny can
still whip me any day but I now try to play the game for its own sake.
It really is the kind of game you can get into.

Well, I've decided to leave comments on CA Games.  After rating this
game I started to play it again.  I think this is a great cart to package
with the Lynx!  It shows off a lot of the capabilities of the Lynx and
once you pick it up it's hard to put down.  I think its one of the most
addicting and thumb-numbing games out!  If you bought a Lynx without
this game included (basic system) I would suggest trying it out...

While the sound is not quite up to par, the gameplay and options are
excellent. The Lynx is very hard to beat, even on the easiest level!

Even though I finished this game I still pop it in now and then to just
have some fun.

Lots of absorbing puzzles.  Definite buy.

Pretty good game.  Amazing how many different levels can be made out
of so few objects!

GET THIS GAME!!!

Chips Challenge is a very exciting game. It involves lots of time and
brain strain!!!! The best way to play is too be calm and if at first
you don't suceed, try try again.  I would recommend this game for
anyone who likes to solve clues and problems.

Chip's Challenge is a very addictive, thought provoking game. It's very
refreshing to play a game where a fast brain is involved than fast fingers.
The graphics are not great and can turn you off of buying the game, but
the playability and challenge is great!  I would strongly recommend this
game.

This has to be among the best in long term playability!  This is the
type of game that you play in cycles- you might not play this game for
months but all of a sudden you will find yourself humming Chip's theme
and be back playing its challenging levels over and over again.  I was
very suprised at this because the game does not look very fun when you
look at the box at the store, but it IS!  If you like puzzles get Chips!

From looking at the previews in the magazines the last few months, I
had my doubts about this one.  When it was originally envisioned, it was
to be a 16 player game, it has since been scaled back to a six player
game.  This has great graphic intro animation, and awesome digitized sound
compleat with echo.  Unlike Roadblasters, this game plays like a dream.
The -steering- problems found in Roadblasters have been solved.  The game
is presented very well with some slick box art and game design.  Those
posters really are annoying.  There are some good options for gameplay
although you have only one choice of car.  You can change the color of your
car, the sex of your driver, practice, single heat, or tournament racing,
and a selection of 18 tracks to choose from.  The widely rumoured track
editor did not make it to the final product though.  Despite that, this
is a first rate game and should be a part of everyone's Lynx
collection.

The graphics and animation on this driving game are very impressive, a lot
of nice little touches like the flag wavers and 7 speed manual trannies!

If you liked Pole Position you will like this one, steering is very easy
with the joypad. In fact this one handles better than any driving game
I have played on any computer with a joystick.

I thought I might not like this game because the lack of a steering wheel
but that has been dealt with very effectively.  I find the game to be
nice and exciting.  The ability to choose the tyope of car, track, and
length is great.  If you liked Pole Position (and even if you didn't)
you will love this game!

Checkered Flag is a great racing game, but keep in mind that it is an
arcade type racing game, not a racing simulator with pit stops, deadly
wipeouts, etc.  What makes this game so great is a number of things.
First of all, the graphics are outstanding, with different backgrounds
and scenery items for each of the 18 tracks.  Scaling is handled better
than we've seen on any Lynx game yet, no chunky pixels if you get too
close to things.  Secondly, there is a wide range of options for both
the race and for your car.  You can even pick the sex of the driver!
Finally, control is excellent, with none of the steering problems found
in RoadBlasters.  Altho the rumored track editor didn't make it in, with
the 18 tracks supplied there is more than enough to keep you racing for
a long time!  No apparent slowdown with ComLynx racing either.  We've
played with as many as 4 players.

Gameplay and driving is excellent.  It's amazing that they've squeezed so
much game onto such a small game card.

This is the game that made me decide to get a LYNX.

Sianara (John Gall from Paradise Valley, AZ)

This game is great! I like all of the things you can change so that,
unless you play this game every day for a month, each time you play it
can be different.  Personally, I like to choose between a manual or automatic
transmission (auto preferred).  I give this game an overall A.

Qwerty (Chris Cox from Mesa, AZ)

Checkered flag is a very exciting game when played with other opponents
through the ComLynx cable but not very exciting when played 1 player.
The sound affects are REALLY awesome when listened through a pair of
earphones and not through the speaker because you can hear everything
in depth.  You can hear if a car is coming from your left, or from your
right!  GREAT ending graphics.  If the girls in the game were real,
I'd go for it!  Great graphics!

When this game was new, it was my favorite of the first 4 games available
for the Lynx.  The graphics are awesome, and the perspecive is unique.
To solve this game, I made maps--they are available in the Lynx download
library.  Once solved, this game loses its appeal-it's one of those
games you just aren't interested in very much once you finish.  I still
like to look at the opening animation sequence, and listen to the opening
music.  A great game to show off the Lynx's scaling capability--the whole
screen is being scaled as you walk toward and away from the screen--with
no chunky pixels, because the scaling is only being used to reduce the
original graphics, not blow them up more, like in Blue Lightning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norman Bates from Stockton, CA

I feel that the graphics are just too difficult to discern what is going
on.  My initial reaction is: Bleeech!  However, if this feeling changes
I will so state but for right now I am non-plussed.

I found Electrocop much to hard for my tastes.  I had a lot of trouble
with the -through the walls- view of the game.  Hard to judge where you
are in relation to other monsters on the screen.  It has potential but
it's just not for me.  I quickly traded this one in for another game.

Here is an explanation of the 10 Rating Game categories:

GRAPHICS: Your rating of graphics should cover all non-animated features
of the game. This includes backgrounds, choice of colors and how much
detail is included in the game's screens.

ANIMATION: Your animation rating should include all moving objects (such
as characters and vehicles) as well as the game's horizontal/vertical
scrolling. Does the game scroll from screen to screen nice and smooth? Is
the movement of characters smooth from frame to frame?

SOUND EFFECTS: Your rating of the game's sound effects should cover any
non-musical sounds and noises. Are the sounds clear and distinct? Are
they appropriate to the animation? Are the sounds original or do you feel
like you've heard them all before? If this is an arcade conversion or
you've seen the game on another system, how does the sound compare?

MUSICAL SCORE: Some Lynx games have more music in them than others. Your
rating here should cover originality and how appropriate the theme is to
the game itself. Do you find yourself enjoying the music or does it seem
to drone on endlessly?

GAMEPLAY AND DESIGN: Actual gameplay, of course, is very important. A
game can have poor sound effects and average graphics and still be a
winner. When rating this category ask yourself if the whole premise
behind the game is good. Is the concept well thought out? Are
expectations fair or does the game seem impossible to beat? Do the
controls react well to your touch and are they easy to use?

COMLYNX FEATURE: This category, of course, only relates to those games
which are designed for multiple players. Many games, in fact, may not
come across very good as a single-player game, but really shines in
ComLynx mode. Do individual players interact well? Does animation
continue to be smooth? If a player dies, is he still able to continue?

EXCITEMENT: When rating a game's excitement level, you should ask
yourself whether you find yourself looking for another game to play or
whether you find yourself staying up late to try it 'just one more time'.
Do you find yourself yawning and ready for bed or telling all your
friends about it?

CHALLENGE: Challenge is also very important in a game. A game should be
easy enough to keep you from becoming discouraged, but at the same time,
be challenging enough to keep you coming back for more. Did you almost
make that level and want to go on? Or did you finish it easily or get
blasted away after just a few minutes?

LONG-TERM PLAYABILITY: This is another very important factor in rating
the game. Can you return to the game and enjoy it even after you've
finished it? Do you still find yourself playing it even though you've
owned it for several weeks or months?

PRESENTATION & PACKAGING: Your rating in this category should cover the
package artwork as well as any screenshots which are included on the box
or in the instructions. Is the manual well-written and accurate? Does the
game desciption on the box accurately describe the game? Does the game
give you everything you expected when you read the box?

as opposed to $35

While this game is visually exciting, gameplay is very straightforward.
Also, the aliens are completely predictable, with no variance in their
movements from game to game.  The best part of this was enjoying the
graphics, lots of aliens and different scrolling backgrounds make this
an eye pleaser.

Not a bad shoot-em up. It does become rather easy to beat over time since
all the enemies follow the same pattern. At least the game has one of the
Better ending sequences on any game so far.

Gauntlet 3 is at first, an impressive little endever, but as you continue
playing the game, it soon becomes hopelessly impossible!  I really enjoy
the game, but it would have been nice if Atari had made the game a bit
easier by making the first levels fairly simple and then gradually build
up the tension rather than giving you one easy level and then throwing
you into the thick of things.  Not a bad game, just not a great one though.
For real Gauntlet lovers, try Gauntlet 2 on the Atari ST!

This game is a *MUST_HAVE* !!  If more games had the sound clearity KLAX
has, SEGA Game Gear owner would drop-kick their machines and replace
it with a Lynx!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trekker (Al Horton from Lansing, MI)
01:45:32 pm  July 7, 1991

This was the ** MUST ** game I had to have when I bought my Lynx.  It is
one of those games where you just HAVE to keep on playing to see if you
can reach another leveI especially like the -Pick a Level to Start-
feature.  And the digitalized sound enhances the game greatly.  Klax comes
highly recomended from me if you are into strategy/thinking games.
Addictive!

Juggernaut (Arthur Joe Narvaez from Cambridge, MA)
10:00:58 am  July 30, 1991

This game is surely one of the best available for the Lynx.
Those who enjoyed the arcade version will not be disappointed
at all. This version of KLAX has been said to be better and
more faithful to the arcade version than _ANY_ other version
(namely the Sega). This is not a game you -solve- it is a game
of skill and fast-thinking!! That makes this game a sure bet to 
continue to be a heavily played cart for long after you first buy it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kyle Miller from Universal City, TX
10:50:40 pm  Sep. 6, 1991

The game can get very exciting if you can get the -X- on wave 6.  It
takes you to wave 51.  From there, things REALLY move!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jabberwock! (S. Michael Hallack from Jacksonville, FL)

sound.

Norman Bates from Stockton, CA
01:34:16 am  Sep. 24, 1991

This is a really nice game.  At first I thought the vertical playfield
would be a hindrance but it becomes second-nature after awhile.  I think
the packaging should be better to reflect the great game inside the box.
The sound effects are GREAT but the music lacks!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Erik (Erik Fortune from Palo Alto, CA)
02:04:50 am  Nov. 1, 1991

The first tetris-like game I enjoy more than tetris.
Addictive!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Kovach from Mesa, AZ
01:28:08 am  Nov. 7, 1991

From the opening screen on, this game is a fine polished gem!  More games
with this much attention to detail are needed.  It performs flawlessly,
and the digitized sounds are a super special treat!  The music on the
title screen is pretty jammin' too.  The art work on the box doesn't
do this game justice tho, and more background graphics would have been
nice, but those digitized vocals do use up a lot of RAM.  Also, more
arcade conversions of RECENT arcade hits are needed in order for the
Lynx to remain competetive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yar (Peter Johnson from North Bay, ON, Canada)
09:39:40 pm  Nov. 10, 1991

This has to be the best arcade conversion for the Lynx and a definite
show piece.  No one should be without this cartridge!

APRIL CONTEST RESULTS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   Qwerty (aka Chris Cox, of Mesa, AZ) was the April winner in our monthly
Lynx Rating Game.  Chris wins a free Lynx game of his choice - he picked
the highly rated WWI air battle simulator, Warbirds.  Congrats Chris!

   March's Contest winner, The Postman (aka Bernie Bresnahan of Waterford, MI)
chose Crystal Mines II as his prize, citing the fact that he loved the
classic computer game Boulderdash, which is similar in concept.  Recently,
Bernie called us to let us know he had received his prize, and rated it for
us, giving it a 4.22 rating.  He also offered these comments:

      This is  definitely  one  of  the  best  titles I own.  I found
      the manual  annoying in  that  it  doesn't  catalog many of the
      features/power-ups  that  can  occur  during  play.  It's  nice
      that  it  comes  with a book (no poster), tho it's  only  about
      8 pages  thick and half of it's in French.  Excellent gameplay,
      if you liked  Boulderdash  or Supaplex you  won't  want to miss
      this one..

EASTER EGG FOUND IN CRYSTAL MINES II
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   As a few Crystal Mines players across the country have noticed, the
manual for this game mentions that there are 31 hidden bonus levels in the
game.  And, now that the game has been out for a while, some of these
players are having a very hard time finding that last bonus level.
   Well, we at STAR*LINX have the answer, as usual.  The 31st bonus level
is NOT accessed like the other ones.  This one can only be accessed by a
password.  And, after this bonus level is completed, you are sent to level
one.  Also, if played right, you can score nearly a million points on it!
   We aren't going to ruin your fun by telling you tho!  A couple of hints
should be enough for you to find it yourself.  First of all, the folks at
Atari were nice enough to make the password to this level an actual WORD,
not some meaningless 4 letter code.  And, finally, the code for the level
makes perfect sense, and you will be kicking yourself once you find it.
   IF YOU FIND IT PLEASE KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.  Feel free to tell us you've
found it, but don't ruin the fun for other Lynxers.  This is one that
everyone ought to have an opportunity to find for themselves (with our
hints).  Thanks!
   If you can't figure it out after hours of searching with dictionary in
hand, leave me (Jeff Kovach) a private message for a more explicit hint.
Happy Hunting!

INVINCIBILITY IN SLIME WORLD
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   We at STAR*LINX can really keep a secret!  We've known about the existence
of the Ultimate Slime World Easter Egg for OVER A YEAR now, and haven't told
anyone outside of our elite Lynx group.  Recent discussions with Atari have
revealed that they feel that Slime World has been out long enough now, and
all secrets should be revealed.
   With some sadness, we are going to have to tell you our greatest secret,
how to activate the Invincibility feature in Slime World.  But we aren't
going to straight out tell you!  The biggest joy of Easter Eggs is the joy
of discovery.  We will answer questions on STAR*LINX and CompuServe, and
hopefully our answers will get you pointed in the right direction, and enable
you to discover it before we give out the complete instructions.
   STAY TUNED!

GAME RATINGS SUMMARIES
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   A new function of the Game Rating & Review System in STAR*LINX's Lynx Club
is now available.  It lists the total ratings for each Lynx game, bypassing
the listing of each individual person's ratings.  This allows you to see how
all the Lynx titles stack up against each other.  Using this funtion on
STAR*LINX gives you the most current Lynx game rating stats available, as
the numbers are automatically updated whenever someone rates a game.
   Weekly updates, with the games sorted by order of rank, will also be
available in the Lynx area (GO LYNX) on CompuServe.  You can enter our free
monthly drawing for a free Lynx game either by rating a game when you call
STAR*LINX, or by sending your ratings via CompuServe mail to Jeff Kovach

BATMAN RETURNS!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

   On Tuesday, April 27th, sources inside Atari confirmed that final release
to production had been granted for the Atari Lynx version of the videogame
Batman Returns, based on the upcoming blockbuster film from Warner Bros.,
starring Michael Keaton, Michelle Feiffer, and Danny DeVito.
   The game will be on dealer shelves starting June 20th, coinciding with the
film's national release date.
   Batman Returns is one of the most complex and ambitious Lynx video games to
date.  Released on 256K card, it follows the plot of the movie closely, and
features sound and graphics taken from designs made for the film.  Programmed
by Eric Ginner and Jerome Strach, (programmers of Ms. PacMan, Shanghai,
Checkered Flag, Rampart) with animation by Susan G. McBride (et al.), and
music by Bob Vieira and LX Rudis, the game was produced under the supervision
of John Skruch of Atari Entertainment, Sunnyvale.
   Though details of the cartridge are still under wraps, a full preview
appears in Atari Explorer Magazine's May/June issue, on newsstands the week of
May 8th.

ATARI LOSES LAWSUIT WITH NINTENDO
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    Atari Corp. was unsuccessful in its antitrust suit against Nintendo of
America.  The jury found in favor of Nintendo.  The jury did however, find
that Nintendo did have  monopoly power  in the  videogame market  but that
Nintendo did  not monopolize  that market.   The  jury was  also unable to
reach  a  decision  on  two  other  points  regarding  monopolization  and
restraint of  trade.   During the  10 week  trial, Nintendo claimed it had
only engaged in vigorous competition and that its exclusive had legitamate
business justifications.

    -We are  disappointed the jury did not understand the negative impacts
Nintendo's exclusive  contracts had  on competition  because of Nintendo's
power  over  its  suppliers  and  customers,-  said William Jaeger, senior
partner,  Khourie,  Crew  &  Jaeger,  the  San  Francisco  law  firm  that
specializes in complex business litigation and represents Atari.  
  
    -The consumer  also loses  from this result because the antitrust laws
have worked very effectively to maintain a strong  competitive environment
with lower  prices and  better choices  for consumers.  This decision will
seriously weaken those vital laws.-
 
    -In this  case, it  was clear  that Nintendo's  practices violated our
antitrust laws  and thwarted  Atari's ability to compete.  Atari should be
compensated for its substantial damages.  This award is also  necessary to
send  a  strong  message  that  our  antitrust  laws protect and encourage
healthy competition -- no more, no less.-

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

According to the Wall Street Journal, Atari has signed an advertising
contract for the Lynx.  This advertising campaign with Hal Rinney &
Partners for $7 million, follows pre-Christmas test marketing in Los
Angeles.  The firm customized a UK television commercial for presentation
in the US market and the LA tests were nothing short of spectacular.
Plans now call for a new nationwide campaign in April.  New television
commercial developed by Hal Rinney will be used worldwide.

Ren & Stimpy, the characters from the cartoon show of the same name (seen
on Nickelodeon and MTV) are making their way to the Lynx.  Acclaim has
licensed them, and announced titles for the Lynx and other systems.

Atari is working on a multiplayer outer space combat game, sure to appease
Star Raiders and Star Wars fans everywhere.  The name has not yet been
announced, but look for this game to be a sure-fire hit!

Shadowsoft, developer and publisher of Robotron for the Lynx, is working
on some original titles.  One of them is a yet unnamed side-scrolling
shoot-em-up.  According to Shadowsoft President Dave Dies, this will be
the definitive Lynx shoot-em-up, comparable to R-Type for other systems.

Eye of the Beholder, a long awaited RPG conversion for the Lynx, is going
to be the first Lynx game with battery back up for saved games.  Programmers
are hard at work getting the save game file under 8K.  The saved game files
for the PC version are around 32K each.

Shadowsoft, developer and publisher of Robotron for the Lynx, is planning
to release Joust in May.  Also, a deal is being worked on to produce the
arcade hit Smash TV for the Lynx.

Rumor has it, that the next game to be signed in the Telegames-Tradewest
alliance will be the super popular, award winning BattleToads!

Bug found in Toki - On level 3, you can slip above the ceiling and bypass
part of the game.  This can sometimes cause strange screen distortions or
crash the game.  This is a bug having to do with sprite collision detection.
It might be fixed in a later production run.

According to sources at Atari, there are Easter Eggs in all 3 of the latest
Lynx games (Crystal Mines II, Toki, SuperSkweek).  In the case of Crystal
Mines, there is at least one more in addition to the secret level already
mentioned.

The digitized sound sample 'Gentlemen, start your engines!' in Checkered
Flag, takes up 24K of cartridge space!  Eric Ginner of Atari states that
so far, Rampart is the only game where he wishes he had more memory to work
with.  5 digitized samples from the arcade are included.  He wanted more.
 
The developer that did Viking Child for Atari, Imagitec from the UK, is
developing Daemon's Gate, an overhead scrolling Role-Playing Game.
 
A new 3rd party Lynx developer, Intense Gaming, has announced 3 games under
development: Time Gates-Time travelling game-4 players, Space Canyons-Space
game with 3D graphics-4 players, Driving Demons-Racing game with digitized
graphics-4 players.

This is a very faithful translation of the arcade classic. The size is
a bit small, but well done... Sounds exactly like it's arcade parent
and if you close your eyes, you will swear you are playing the original.
The control pad is a little clumsy for a game of this type, but you
get used to it after a while.
Press PAUSE, OPTION ONE, A, OPTION 1 for a little surprise...

Couldn't believe it plays as well as the arcade original.  The extra
levels add more long term play to the game.  Well done!

I liked Ms. PacMan in the arcade in the early 80's so I thought I would
enjoy it on the Lynx.  Not so.  The Lynx controls do not lend themselves
to this game at all.  I get frustrated when I want to go one way and
Ms. PacMan goes another.  If you are a die hard Pac addict get it,
otherwise forget it.

     The Newell 1088K
     Review by Jeff McWilliams
     
     
     Before acquiring a 1 meg plus 800XL, with memory busting out of the
     seams everywhere, my 800XL had a RAMBO XL 256K upgrade in it.  I was
     happy with it because along with that I owned an ICD 1 meg MIO board. 
     My main storage media are 720K 3.5- disks, via the Innovative Concepts
     modification for my single XF551 disk drive.  The 1 meg RAMdisk in the
     MIO was important to me, because without it, it was very difficult to
     back up those 720K disks with only one drive.  A special sector copier
     would have been okay if I had wanted to do sector copies, but such was
     usually not the case.  By backing up the disks file by file, not only
     would I get an emergency back up of the disk, but the new disk was
     also unsegmented.  That meant that unlike the original which could
     have files scattered in pieces all over the disk, the backup has each
     file stored one right after the other.  This helps to increase the
     disk access speed, because the disk drive doesn't spend all its time
     searching the different sections of the disk looking for the file. 
     Some people wouldn't bother with worrying about disk segmentation
     unless it were on hard disk where things can really get messed up. 
     Call me finicky.  Onto the Newell 1088K...  When I deciced to install
     the Turbo816 16 bit card into my 800XL, I discovered my 800XL no
     longer liked talking to the MIO.  There are some problems with the
     Parallel Bus after wiring in the T816 upgrade.  Determined to stick
     with the new 16 bit processor, I decided to dump the MIO, and sent my
     800XL to Newell  Industries to have them install the 1088K upgrade
     they offer.
     
     The board measures approximately 3.5- by 2 3/4-.  A little smaller
     than those 720K floppies.  The board holds the 8 1 meg RAM chips, plus
     8 logic chips.  There is a small cable attached to the board that
     plugs into the first 64K RAM chip socket on the computer.  The 64K RAM
     chip is moved onto a socket on the Newell board.  In addition are two
     14 conductor ribbon cables connected to the Newell board.  These
     attach to various sites on the 800XL motherboard as well.  That's
     about 28 connections to wire.  I'm not the greatest on keeping my
     wiring straight, which is why I had Newell Industries wire in the
     upgrade for me.  There are three variations to the wiring that will
     give you different degrees of compatibility with the 130XE.  Mine is
     wired so that both the CPU and ANTIC chip can see the extra memory. 
     In exchange, my internal BASIC is now wired to a toggle switch; it's
     no longer software selectable.
     
     The Newell 1088K package comes with a modified version of MYDOS,
     version 4.5 M1.  This version allows the access of 1 full megabyte of
     RAMDISK.  It also contains a sector copying program that utilizes all
     that memory to copy up a 720K disk in a single pass.
     
     If you're a SpartaDOS fan, you'll be pleased to know that there is 1
     meg ramdisk driver on GEnie that will work with SpartaDOS 3.2d and the
     Newell 1088K upgrade.  SpartaDOS X automatically recognizes the extra
     memory, and will report 64 banks free when the -MEM- command is
     entered at the DOS prompt.
     













     There are a few problems that I've encountered using the Newell 1088K.
     Most seem to center around the use of the SpartaDOS X cartridge.  The
     first problem occurs upon booting up the computer.  Often it will fail
     to boot properly, and you have to power down and try again.  I've also
     encountered frequent lock-ups when trying to format a disk using the
     -FORMAT- commmand of SpartaDOS X.  Let me just repeat what I said
     earlier about my 800XL though.  It has a Turbo816 board installed into
     it.  In addition, it also has a Transkey keyboard interface which
     allows me to type on this really nice Northgate keyboard.  That's
     quite a bit of hardware wired into one computer.  I can't prove the
     Newell 1088K is causing the problems, although they didn't happen when
     the RAMBO XL was in its place.  It could be a mixture of the Turbo816
     and the Newell 1088K that is causing the problem.  Remember the MIO
     that didn't like the T816?  Currently, I'm not willing to try removing
     the Turbo816 to find out which upgrade may be the culprit.  I'd have
     more luck fixing a wristwatch with a cutting torch than I would
     digging into my computer with a soldering iron.  I do plan on talking
     to both Newell Industries and Dataque Software, maker of the T816
     board, to see if there may be a conflict between the two upgrades I
     have in the computer.
     
     I am glad I have the 1088K.  There are a few kinks here and there; 
     otherwise it works as promised.  Just after I got the computer up and
     running I decided to back up my main SpartaDOS X work disk, which
     contains that endless list of .COM files half of which I hardly ever
     use.  I found six files which were bad due to errors on the disk. 
     Luckily those were on an older backup, so I restored them promptly
     after fixing the bad disk.
     
     The Newell 1088K is available for the 130XE, the 1200XL, the 800XL,
     and 65XE.  To my knowledge, it is the only commercially available
     1088K upgrade for the Atari 8 bits.  I also believe it is the only
     upgrade that will take a 1200XL beyond 256K.  If you're still not
     satisfied with 1088K, with slight modification you can install 4 meg
     RAMS into the Newell 1088K and have a 4096K monster.  For the price of
     the 4 meg DRAM chips though, you'd be better off purchasing a hard
     drive setup if possible on your system.  That would depend on which
     model computer you have.  The 1088K cost me $49.95.  Installation cost
     $40.00.  You can supply your own 1 meg DRAMS or have Newell Industries
     supply them.  Call for current prices on the RAM chips.  Newell
     Industries, P.O. Box 253, Wylie, TX, 75098.  Phone 214-442-6612.

Ninja Gaiden is truly an awsome game for the LYNX that supports a genre
that was sorely lacking on the LYNX.  Unlike the GAMEPRO review, it is
intelligent and challenging.  It does not have unlimited continues, it
only has 3.  There are also many enemies to fight, including Black Ninja,
White Ninja, Jasons, Sumo, Claw men, etc...  The Art is Excellent, with
some of the best animation yet on the LYNX.  Even better animation than
Slime World or Xenophobe.  With the exception of a bit of color mixup at
the beginning of the 2nd level, your sprite is clearly visible through the
whole game.  There is a music on or off option.  Not that you'd want to use
it.  The music is really exceptional in all parts except the beginning of
the first level.  (When you think about it the beginning level should have
the best music since you always go there.)  Sound effects are good as well,
with excellent punch and breaking effects.  There are four levels to the
game and so far I have only seen the end section of level 3.  I have been
playing steady for 3 days now.  I am not a begining player either.  This
is really a challenging game that is very fun to play.  Especially if you
flip your enemies into things!!!!  I have to take a moment to talk about
the art.... It is soooo good.  The backdrops are incredible!!!  And the
halftime screens at the end of each level, especially the 2nd, are really
well done.  GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMME.

If you like the arcade game, I hear this is a good translation, but I
don't like the game (I'd never played in the arcade).  It is dull and
mindless.

I see that I gave this game lower scores than everyone else, but don't
let that be misleading.  I like this game a lot and it reminds me of
Golden Axe for the Genesis, and an old Atari 800 game called Bruce Lee.
Compared to the arcade version though, the game is way short, and the
various enemies are greatly reduced (in variety, not number).  I think
that after people beat this game, they won't go back to it too often,
and the lack of a two player mode leaves out what I think is the Lynx's
best feature.  I like this game because I like to beat on the various
guys, but for the above reasons would give it a -good- rating, not a
great.  Just my opinion.  By the way, I love the new Lynx.

This game was somewhat of a disappointment.  The background graphics
are very detailed, although the choice of colors could have been better.
Animation was disappointing.  The player's character moves well, but
the bad guys are pretty jerky.  I also feel that some of the background
graphics could have been animated for effect.  Music was irritating at
best.  The lack of a ComLynx feature caused me to lower the Gameplay
and Design to 2 (Fair).  I couldn't say I got very excited while playing
this game either.  The challenge level seems ok, but the fact that there
are only 4 levels, and that I got thru most of 3 in the first 2 hours
of having the game makes me give it only 2 for Long Term Playability.
Finally, I like the poster idea for the instructions.  For those of you
who didn't know, the game comes with a poster of the box art, with the
instructions on the back.  Overall, I'd say for all the hype around this
game, it is pretty disappointing.  I like Rygar better (similar concept
of gameplay, but funner game!)  I'm glad I was able to rent this game instead
of buying it!

I was really disappointed that this game (unlike the arcade) was not for
two players.  Hard to believe that this game does not take advantage of
ComLynx, one of the most exiting features of the Lynx.  Everything else
in the game was just good.  Not anything exeptional.

I've been playing this game for over a week now and have found that under
the glitz, the game play tends to be a bit weak.  Ninja Gaiden is a good
game, but it seems a waste when once considers that Gaiden III is now
available.  I would have been more interested in seeing Northstar being
translated to the Lynx.  Nevertheless, great graphics, and smooth scrolling.
This game needs a sun visor to be seen anywhere there is light.

This is a great game but it is a little easy.  Graphics are excellent.
Some digitized sounds would have been nice when you hit the guys.  I'm
glad I bought it, it was worth the money.

Trekker (Al Horton from Lansing, MI)
07:57:34 am  Aug. 31, 1991

Ninja Gaiden is probably the weakest game in the Lynx lineup.  The graphics
and animation is outstanding and sound is very good.  But the control is
terrible.  The onscreen characters look and move like human beings instead
of like robots.  Seems such a waste to have a good looking game spoiled by
clumsy control and repetitive play.  After about 4 hours I still have less
than 50% success at grabbing an opponent and throwing them, or grabbing a
bar.  The combination of pushing the joypad up, hitting the A button and
then the Option 1 button is very clumsy.  The gameplay is very repetitive
from level to level.

Bottom line is the game looks great, but has little long term value.
I don't recomend it.

   When I first got this game, I almost brought it back.  The graphics were
great!  The musical score wasn't bad.  But, the controls were complicated.
After playing it about 3 times, I was able to master the controls.  This is
when the game got really interesting.  This cart is definetely worth
purchasing if you're a fighting game fanatic!  Don't get discouraged with
the controls.  With a little practice, you'll get used to it.
   I've also finished the game without any continues, but still find myself
coming back for more.  Let's see Ninja Gaiden II and III now!

This is the 2nd game I have seen with the instructins on the backside
of a poster.  I like the graphics BUT when there are too many people
on the screen it flickers a bit, not too much but I much prefer the well
documented Lynx: -Too many sprites then slow down- 'feature' to this
flicker.  Other than that it is pretty good and just difficult enough
to be fun.

DJ Dave (David Scarpa from Palmer, MA)

Ninja Gaiden features very nice Animation,graphics and gameplay. I only
take it down a notch on documentation. The poster instructions are horrible.

Juggernaut (Arthur Joe Narvaez from Cambridge, MA)
12:48:30 am  Sep. 17, 1991

This game is truly an accurate translation from the arcade version.
The graphics are simply great in that they are not only attractive and
discernable but they also are functional.  Any fans of the arcade version
will find this game to be great!  I would have prefered a bit more speed
on the combat but the speed actually is more representative of the arcade
version which ran a little slow in my opinion.

Leo (Leo Black from Colorado City, AZ)

A good game.  I didn't like it to well but my brothers play it like crazy.
I have a dislike of R-J-P-K-D-R games (Run Jump Punch Kick Die Restart)
This however lasts a little longer than the avrage R-J-P-K-D-R game in that
you have 3 lives and you can pick a few up along the way.  I did not like
the music and the Title Screen sucks!  The most you want to do is play it
enough to get 30% of your moneys worth and trade someone else for a better
one.  In fact, I got half way through the third level before I got sick of
it.

Excellent game... VERY good translation from the arcade version.  I actually
prefer this Lynx version over the arcade one.   I brought this one into
work one day and never got a chance to play, everyone else loved it and
kept grabbing at it... this game is really well made!!!

This has to be the worst game in existence!!!!  There is just one or two
houses which they just recolor.  There is no variation to the gameplay.
No stunning graphics or sound.  I believe that I would have better time
delivering newspapers for a living.  Maybe then I could earn enough money
to buy a 'real' game.

Why they chose to make this game for the LYNX is beyond me.  I never
liked the game in the arcade nor do I like it for the LYNX.  There is
just not enough variety to the game.

To: <a href="mailto:Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%20#208">Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu</a>

Recently I talked to an -expert- on our university on the issue of
MIO cables. He owns an Amiga and he have had exactly the same problems
with signals breaking down while using long data/address/control cables.
He hadn't been able to use cords longer than some 25cm (10-).
Now he is able to transmit data over a distance of 2m (80-?, 3 ft + sth)
He has managed this by redesigning his flat ribbon cable. Between each
two data/control/address lines there _must_ be a line connected
to ground (0V). This measure prevents the signal from flashing over
to adjacent lines, which is especially true with long cables.
The MIO cables don't seem to have additional GND lines inbetween each
two signal lines. That way they aren't designed for long distance
connection.
I admit that it is hard to build a cable described above because as a
matter of fact you'll need at least some 20 additional lines just
connected to GND (monster cable if you are using a flat one).

I think it is at least an interesting idea worth considering.
It works great on an Amiga.

BTW: the guy I asked doesn't think the idea of adding buffers to
lines would help.

To: <a href="mailto:Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%20#208">Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu</a>

I haven't read all the messages so far posted on this subject, but being
someone in PAL land with NTSC Atari 8-bits I may be able to help.  Dean, you
have my telephone number so, if you wish, give me a call.

Some interesting points have already been raised.  I read with interest
Dean's definition of a 65XE, as a cut down 130XE.  This is true for the UK
models.  My PAL 65XE has the same mother board as my 130XEs.  However, my
NTSC 65XE has a completely different motherboard, without the extra IC
places for the extra bank of memory.  In fact, this 65XE looks more like my
800XLF (yes, you read that right - 800XLF is a standard 800XL with a Freddie
chip, and is the prototype for the 65XE.  A number of these beasts were
released within the UK).

I solved the NTSC compatibility problem by buying a TV that support PAL and
NTSC (it also support SECAM - anyone got an 8-bit SECAM they want to sell?).
You can modify standard PAL TV/Monitors to accept NTSC by adjusting cct timers,
however, you will have no sound or colour.  The adjusment is very small, however
some TV/Monitors just won't accept the 60Hz signal.

You are lucky, at least on the S.A.M. issue. Like many other German
commercial and non commercial software S.A.M. is entirely in English.
Actually there isn't even a German version available.
English has a great impact on German software production. In Germany
you find more programs that are in English than in German
(we are talking about programs written by German authors!).
Many people here in Germany don't like this, they want to have more
German speaking programs but there is no way of getting English
out of German programs :-).
Anyways, the docs for S.A.M. are in German. :-(
You are out of luck according to english-language versions of
-AtariMagazin- they are only in German (still published after a
break!).

Yes, there is some commercial software here in Germany produced
by dedicated users and small companies. Take -Quick- for example
which is a commercial compiler language a little bit like
-C- and -Action!- and like -Assembler-. It is very fast.
You can even write procedures for the VBI. This language supports
a ST-mouse, digitized sound, P/M graphics and lots more.

I hope this gave you a vague idea about the situation in Germany.

See ya,

I've seen this other SAM on a C=64 too, but it's a different S.A.M.
I'm gonna explain to Bill and all other interested people.

S.A.M. stands for Screen Aided Menagement. It is a piece of commercial
software produced by a small German software house.
It is a user interface with integrated applications.
It uses an 80 columns screen on a standard TV set. It looks a little
bit like GEM on the Atari-ST. You have pull down menus on the top
of the screen where you can select items with your mouse or joystick.
There are standard items like -directory, lock file, format disk,
read sector, duplicate disk, etc.-. Then you have some special
applications you can pick up. They will be loaded from the S.A.M. disk.
One of them is a spreadsheet program. Another is a program called
-Memobox-. It is a small database with the possibility of creating
your own data cards. Also included are two character editors.
One for standard B/W characters and the other one for GRAPHICS 12
color character sets. Next application is a painting program
which uses 128 colors but only 4 on a single line (standard DLI).
It has many usefull functions like fill and unfill!, draw lines, draw
circles, mirror etc.
Another part of S.A.M. is a word processor. It has all the functions
I need like text formatting, cut, paste, block text, preview function
(you see the whole layout of the page), support for Atari printers
and Epson printers.
Next item you can open is a monitor program to browse the memory.
It has some kinds of display functions like showing screen code
or ATASCII code or showing bytes in their binary appearence
(eg.  $A800: 01011100 ) so you can easily scan for character sets.

I think I have described all the implemented applications.
All of them have full 80 column and mouse support. But there is more.
S.A.M. is a kind of extention of the operating system. There are
documented interfaces for routines of S.A.M. so you can write
your own software. For example you can use the -open window- routine
just by putting the coordinates in a special location and calling
the apropriate S.A.M. subroutine. Then just give your application
a special filename extension and place it on the S.A.M. disk.
Next time you use S.A.M. your application will be awailable in the
pull down window.

Due to this flexibility there are some new programs for S.A.M.
awailable. To name one: a 'Breakout' game.

Ok, I think that's all I remember about S.A.M.
I hope this gives you a vague idea about it.

I don't recall what the resolution of the koala pad is, but it's plenty
large for my purposes.  If I can scratch an inch-high -A- on the pad and
have the computer identify it, then I'll be happy.  This isn't going to
be very useful in the real-world because of the hardware involved (IMHO
any useful hand-printing-based system must be completely portable).  I'm
more interested in the neatness of the project.

The algorithm I'm planning to use is based on one described in the April
issue of Dr. Dobbes Journal.  It's far easier to do than I'd ever thought;
I don't see any trouble in using the Atari for this project.  Not much
number crunching is involved, and I wouldn't even call it artificial
intelligence.  However, for at least the initial implementation I plan
to use a unix system to do the analysis so the software will be more
portable.  The atari will be little more than a digitizing pad.  Later,
I may start to move some or all of the analysis services over to the atari.

Well, I wouldn't call it simplicity...but I might call it -simpler than
I thought-.  Actually this is one of those examples where the difficulty
lies more in having a correct -vision- of the solution than in the actual
implementation.  I suggest that anyone interested in this sort of project
get the april issue of Dr. Dobbs journal...

Well, READNEWS is down on my end,so I am doing this the hard way.

Bill Kendrick wanted to know the differences between some of the 65xx
processors.

Here's my best....

The 6502 is pretty much what you expect it to be, and is the cpu in
the 800 and 400 computers.  The 65C02 actually are two different
CPU's.  One is the R65C02 made by Rockwell, the other is the
65C02 by Western Design Center. Both are low power, CMOS
versions of the 6502 with some extra instructions added, but the
R65C02 had more instructions added to it than the 65C02 did.
The 65C02 is in the Apple //c.

I believe MAC/65 supports the 65C02 extra instructions.  It could
be plugged into an Atari 800 or 400.

The 6502C is an Atari custom version of the 6502 from what I gather.
They added some extra buffers or something to chip.  I also wonder
if they corrected a bug in the 6502 as it was documented in
my -Programming the 65816- Book.

Because of the differences between the 6502 and Atari's 6502C,
you can't plug in a 65C02 or even the Pin compatible 65802 and
expect it to work properly.

What is a 65802?  It's another processor From Western Design Center
that has all the extra opcodes of the 65C02 plus extras, like
move memory commands, stack relative addressing, and the ability
to set the Accumulator and/or the X and Y registers to 16 bits.
The nice thing about the 65802 is that it is -Plug compatible- with
the 6502 and 65C02, meaning you can pull out a 65C02 from an
existing system, and plug in the 65802 and it will work.
The 65802 has two modes, emulation and native mode.  In emulation
mode, the processor acts just likea 65C02 with all the extra opcodes.
In Native mode, the registers can be changed to 16 bits..  There are
some other more technical differences, but probably not worth
mentioning them here.

Next comes the 65816.  Another Microprocessor, only this one has
a 24 bit addressing bus in addition to all the goodies of the 65802.
This means it can easily address 16 megabytes of RAM.

What more could you want? Well, WDC is working on the 65832, which
according to the pre-release specs I have, will just have
the ability to have 32 bit registers.  In the 65816 documentation,
WDC said the 65832 would have built-in floating point OPCODES, but
apparantly that idea has been dumped (sigh).

So in a nutshell, that is basically the differences between the
various processors.  I hope I've helped more than I've confused.

Subject: Digi-Studio new prices ad again!
To: <a href="mailto:Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%20#208">Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu</a>

Yes, sorry folks, it's Digi-Studio again! Since I last posted the info for it,
I have been able to reduce the prices to the US and other countries by quite a 
lot. Package 1 on its own now costs 7pounds to other countries, and packages
1 and 1.5 together costs 10pounds to other countries. This means a saving of
around $6 on packages 1 and 1.5. This leaves me with barely any profit at all,
but if that's what it takes to sell some copies outside the UK, then so be it.
The only way I can make the price lower is to have a US distributor. The way
I have decided to do this is as follows: the distributor would receive a 
specially produced US version of the two packages on disk. He/She would also
receive the user manual in A4 format for making into booklets in the US, or
straight photocopying. This would be up to the distributor. Sorry, we don't
have your strange paper sizes in the UK, so it has to be A4. A4 is slightly
longer,
but not quite as wide as your standard paper size. I would need a royalty on 
each copy sold. The amount would be sorted out once a distributor was found.
Of course, I would need somebody I could trust, because it would be impossible
for me to know how many were being sold. I could send registration cards over
as well. One would be sent with each copy of Digi-Studio asking the customer to
complete the card and send it to me. This would be a good way for me to know
how many copies have been sold. The US distributor would have absolute control
over Digi-Studio in the US. He/She would advertise it, and do the duplicating
of disks/booklets. I have already advertised it on the net quite a lot, an have
received some interest in Digi-Studio. If anybody is willing to have a try at
this then please email me:

                         Digi-Studio Information
                         -----------------------

     Digi-Studio is a new piece of software for the Atari XL/XE series.

     It allows you to play music using real sounds which have been digitized.

     Digi-Studio comes with a keyboard player and tune player. The keyboard
player lets you use your computer keyboard like a piano keyboard to play tunes,
but using real sounds, rather than computer-generated noises as is usually the
case with this type of program. You can have 3 sounds in memory and can quickly
change between them while playing tunes.The keyboard player has responsive keys
so that the sound will only play for as long as you hold the key down.Just like
a synthesizer!! The Digi-Studio disk contains many sounds for use with the
keyboard player, ranging from church bells, to pig grunts, to a baby crying, to
screams, and lots of synthesizer sounds. In fact around 25 sounds in all. Why
buy a synthesizer when your Atari can do the same?!

     The tune player allows you to play pre-programmed tunes using any of the
available sounds on the disk. Five tunes have been included on the disk for you
to play.

     Digi-Studio comes on a DS/SD disk, and includes a printed manual. It is
aimed at everyone, whether musically inclined or not! You may just want to use
it for fun, or compose a tune with it! The comprehensive user manual makes it a
joy to use!

     Digi-Studio will only work on XL/XE computers with 64K RAM. No extra
hardware is required. The sound samples just play through your TV speaker!

     The full Digi-Studio package costs just 5pounds in the UK, and 7pounds
for foreign orders, including printed manual, and shipping. All payments must
be made in UK funds (pounds sterling) and paid by money order in sterling if
you are ordering from a foreign country. Order your copy today!

     Package 1.5 for Digi-Studio is now also available offering more features
for Digi-Studio and loads more samples and tunes. This extra pack is available
with package 1 only. Check the next section for details of this new package.

                        Digi-Studio Package 1.5

     Digi-Studio Package 1.5 is a new set of programs which form part of the
     Digi-Studio suite of programs and utilities. It is NOT an upgrade to
     package 1. It is intended to be used in conjunction with package 1.

     Package 1.5 contains two new programs for Digi-Studio: The Sample
     Editor and the Tune Compiler. Also included are 26 new samples and 18
     new tunes for use with Digi-Studio.

     The Sample Editor allows you to edit existing Digi-Studio samples, and
     also allows you to create your own by using a joystick. The Sample
     Editor has facilities for reversing samples (playing them backwards),
     copying pages of sample to other pages of sample, and also contains
     facilities to edit samples very accurately using a joystick. This edit
     facility also allows you to create your own samples. By using all the
     supplied facilities, you can create some very weird sounds! You can
     then save your samples to disk and use them in the Keyboard and Tune
     Players in package 1.

     The Tune Compiler creates stand-alone Basic program modules for
     including Digi-Studio tunes in your own Basic programs. The resulting
     modules are output in LIST format for merging into your own Atari Basic
     or Turbo-Basic programs. The modules are self-contained and do not
     require any Digi-Studio program to play. Just imagine your game
     starting with a chorus of God Save the Queen in pig grunts, church
     bells, electric guitar, ..., or your own sounds created using the
     Sample Editor!

     Also included on the disk are 26 new samples, including pan pipes,
     various guitars, dog woof, organs, synth sounds, and lots of effects!
     Also, 18 new tunes are supplied for playing with the Tune Player, or
     for compiling using the Tune Compiler. These include: Yesterday, Hey
     Jude, View to a Kill, God Save the Queen, Happy Birthday, This Old Man,
     and many classics.

     The manual is in A5 booklet format, and has been typeset using LaTeX,
     and printed using an Agfa Laser printer. The clear instructions make
     the software a joy to use!

     Package 1.5 is not much use on its own, so will be sold along with
     package 1. The two packages together will cost 8pounds (UK) including P&P.
     Copies to other countries will cost 10pounds (UK sterling paid with IMO).
     Just fill in the order form below and send it with a cheque/PO/IMO
     payable to DEAN GARRAGHTY.

     Package 1 on its own is 5pounds UK, and 7pounds other countries. See
     the first section of this posting for full details of package 1.

                                  -----CUT-----
                       Please send me (tick relevant box):

To: <a href="mailto:Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%20#208">Info-Atari8@naucse.cse.nau.edu</a>

Marek Tomczyk's comments on ribbon cables w/the Amiga were interesting
(IA8 V92#106), since I did spend a little of my vacatiuon time last week taking
another look at the problem.
I'm generally skeptical of the validity of making comparisons to a similar
problem on another machine w/out knowing what frequencies/waveforms are involved
.  I'm also skeptical of signal crosstalk being a significant contributor to the
problem.  I did a little checking on ribbon cable specs.  Crosstalk for a 3m
(10-ft) cable was spec'ed at 1.5% for the near end to 2.6% for the far end.
I have trouble believing 2% crosstalk will totally scramble a digital signal.
Alternating sig-gnd-sig sounds like a step in the right direction, it would
reduce crosstalk & improve RFI resistance somewhat.  But for long cables you
would need to do more than just isolate the signals.

Crosstalk is a function of capacitive reactance.  The reason cross talk is isn't
a major factor is because- somewhat to my surprise- specific capacitance of
28AWG ribbon is actually rather low: about 12 pF/ft which is as good as the
best lo-cap shielded cables.  I don't see capacitance as the problem.

What about DC resistance?  Specific resistance of 28AWG ribbon is given as
0.08 ohms/ft.  Ten feet of this cable will impose less than 1 ohm of resistance
to any AC or Dc signal.  That-s not even enough to cause a measurable voltage
drop in most systems, forget about DC resistance as the cause.

Of course, the total impedance of the cable is the vector sum of the reactances
plus the Dc resistance.  Having disposed of capacitive reactance & DC resistance
as proximate causes of the signal degradation, that leaves one major quantity
not yet considered: inductive reactance.  It is my personal opinion that in
fact inductive reactance is the real culprit here, all the other factors are
minor contributors.  Specific inductance for standard 28AWG ribbon is given as
80uH/ft.  Eegads!!  In other words, it's an RF *filter*!  A 5-foot cable will
impose a 0.4mH inductance upon the signal.  People, that much inductance will
attenuate *audio* frequencies; an RF signal will just plain be squashed.  In
other words, you can't do it, period.

So, how do you get round the problem?  Certainly not with ribbon cable!  The
only way to reduce inductive reactance is to increase the conductivity of the
medium.  There are 3 ways: 1.) Lower the temperature (liquid helium is nice);
2.) Use the most efficient room-temperature conductor (100% pure silver comes
to mind); 3.) Use heavier gauge copper wire.  Obviuosly the last alternative
is the only practical solution.  Combined with Marek's idea of isolating the
signals w/grounds, it should work.  So, what gauge cable should you use?  I'm
not sure, I didn't study up on the properties of other gauges, especially their
specific inductance.

There is some good news.  Lo-cap shielded cable is readily available.  I think
the wire in these is typically #22AWG.  Assuming inductance is a linear function
of wire thickness, & if my memory is correct in recalling wires double in thick-
ness every 3 standard values, then lo-cap cable w/22AWG conductors should 
attenuate only half as much as the same length of ribbon cable.  This might be
enough margin to allow lengths of 2-5 feet (I'm guessing).  Each signal should
be paired with its own local gnd return (twisted pairs) to provide a lo-
impedance ground, with an overall braid grounded at one end to prevent the thing
from radiating/attracting RFI.  Since the MIO & BB do not actually use every
finger connector on the PBI (I think there are only about a dozen signals),
you should be able to get by with lo-cap shileded cable bearing 25 #22AWG
conductors (12 twisted pairs + shield drain) terminated w/shielded DB-25 hoods.
Of course, some weirdo adapter will be needed to go from 50-pin edgecard to
DBN-25, then another adapter at the MIO/BB end.

FOOEY!!!

I'm right now in process of getting my BB online, & converting from edgecard
to shielded round cables is a royal pain in the butt.

For myself, I solved the PBI cable problem by buying a whole new desk!  I
needed more space anyway, to add 1.4M floppies & hard drives.

-Swiss Army Desk-, made by O'Sullivan, very nice, I got it at an office supply
place.  One of those things you have to assemble yourself, after you have
recovered from the hernia you got dragging the heavy cartons from the car to
the living room.

Even though Rampage is one of my favorite games at the arcade the Lynx
seems to take all the fun out of it.  Yes, the game is kick (if you want
to kick your friends that is).  I wish there was more to this but what?
I don't know.

Steven Foust from Tempe, AZ

When converting an arcade hit to a video game system that has better graphics
or sound capabilities, they should take advantage of the opportunity and
create an even better game.  I guess that they made up for that by adding
several -EASTER EGGS- that are somewhat amusing.

Pretty decent overall. I got it at a discount ($22) at Good Guys (it was a
demo, box and all but it had been opened).  Hey, if they think that is worth
$13 off the price I am not going to argue!  I believe it is definitely worth
it at that price!

Surprisingly good, reasonably faithful version of the arcade game!

Very good coin-op translation BUT the need for a steering wheel is SO
apparent.  It is not easy but repititous.  I loved it in the arcade and
on the Lynx it is outstanding!

Evan (Evan Black from Colorado City, AZ)

Good graphics & animation.  I miss the steering wheel from the arcade,
however.  The diagonal moves are kinda hard on the Lynx controller.

I went into the store to by WARBIRDS and they didn't have it, so I bought
RoadBlasters and regret it.  The game is a bore.  Lasted for 5 hours....

As far as a coin operated rendition...which I love, this is great! I
must admit I however, am like the other users I prefer a steering wheel
as opposed to the joypad.  Other than this one can easily get used to
the handling that must be done and enjoy themselves.

G Hill (George Hill from Opelousas, LA)

This game in my opinion is as close to the arcade version as is possible,
right down to the digitized voices. My ONLY gripe about this game is
that it is difficult to hit any enemies who are coming at you in a curve.
That's were the arcade steering wheel helps more than the Lynx Joypad.
Buy this one!

Eric (Eric Goodman from Paradise Valley, AZ)

RoadBlasters is quite an amazing peice of work.  Between the barrage
of special weapons made available throughout the game and the music and
the digitized voice it is really quite fun.  I would recommend getting
this one.  HINT:  There are two secret screens
           HINT 2:Trees, Programmers, Bubble City, B Button, 1st Tree,
                  Crash

Really has a great completion music score.  Worthy of completing the
50th level.

Sianara (John Gall from Paradise Valley, AZ)

A great translation of a great game.  Even the Warp feature is included!
I still like to play it just to try to beat my old scores.

This game has some of the worst sound ever heard on the Lynx!  When played
on the new Lynx while wearing headphones, the only thing you will want to
do with this game is turn it off.  AVOID AVOID AVOID

This game is pretty good if a bit difficult to master with a joypad. The
need for a mouse is evident!  I think the packaging is a bit misleading
in that you get the feeling that weird things will be coming at you but,
alas, it is only a ball.  I got mine on sale at Good Guys for $23 so for
that price I would reccomend it.  Any higher than $29 and I think it is
a bit high!

Rygar has some pretty fantastic background graphics.  And, the scrolling
background really adds to the depth of the game.  After seeing this game,
I can see that -Shadow of the Beast- will look great on the Lynx!

This arcade conversion still needed some work.  In the first level you
meet all the enemies there are except for two.  There is not enough variety
in the game.  I just feel that they could have expanded the game to make
it more enjoyable then the arcade version.

I found this game a little harder to get into but once involved it only
took me a few hours to complete.  Some of the colours used were not the
best and caused a little on screen confusion.

This is a truly great game with excellent gameplay and graphics. Too bad
the tune is so repetitve; better sound effects would have made it even
better.

Norman Bates from Stockton, CA

On the whole I really enjoy this game, however, I think that Rygar is
a bit ill-defined in terms of graphics.  I have seen them do better but
this one is not bad by a longshot, it just could be a bit better.

HeadHunter (Bob Jones from Chicago, IL)

Rygar is a great shoot-em-up type game but suffers somewhat from poor
color choice on the backgrounds.  They should have chosen colors that
had better contrast which would have made it easier to see all the action.
Overall the playability is great despite the color scheme.

Althougth the game is visually pleasing, the game play sucks canal water
to put it politely.  You meet all the meanies in the first few screens
and the game gets monotonous after that.  I really have nothing to say
about this game except STAY AWAY FROM IT!!  Buy Klax instead.

This is a great game.  You're Louis and your mission is to save your little
dog Scrapps from the evil Mr. Big.  Scrapyard Dog is a run & jump & shoot
in the Super mario vein with great graphics a good tune and excellent
gameplay!  It's a shame that Atari is still providing posters with the
games it's the only thing that brings the overall look of the game down.
Special items, secret rooms and games make this one of the best games
to hit for the Lynx...hurry and get yours...Scrapps life hangs in the
balance!

Shifter (Hunter Hardy from Little Rock, AR)

Obviously by my ratings, this game doesn't enspire my love for the Lynx.
It's very plain and simple and doesn't compare with Mario-type games
in any way except concept.  The music is cutesy and the game itself is
just not enough to keep you going.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norman Bates from Stockton, CA
03:03:02 pm  Oct. 13, 1991

Again I HATE the poster instructions.  Beyond that I dislike this game
beacuse it is yet another Super Mario Brothers type game and if I wanted
that I would have bought a Nintendo.  I do believe this thing tries to
be cute and fails miserably.  It is just a matter of jumping and timing with
no thought whatsoever.  It does not even have the benfit of a shoot-em-up
(buying a weapon not included).  Avoid it if you are tired of Mario
and Luigi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atarian (Dan Ramos from Ludlow, MA)
11:03:40 pm  Oct. 22, 1991

Even though the game seems to look like it's another -Run and Jump- game
(like Mario Bros.) it is nowhere near as fun as most games of that category,
but it IS pretty fun anyway.  I think the playability is the worst part
but the animation should have also been worked on a little more.  Artwork
is REALLY lacking and the music is MUCH too -cutesy- for my taste.
Altogether a relatively -fun- game, but not enough to go up with some
of the best -run and jumps- like Super Mario Bros., Super Giani Sisters,
or MegaMan.

Leo (Leo Black from Colorado City, AZ)

I have played Scrapyard Mutt.  It is really quite fun, but the first
level gets boring fast.  It kicks PacLand.  It has a lot of hidden stuff.
The game is really quite easy to play.  I have found warps to all the
levels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Groo (James Nickeforek from Vancouver, BC, Canada)
04:47:10 am  Nov. 12, 1991

I found the game to be boring until I started finding some of the better
hidden warps and rooms... quite cool.

I can't say a bad thing about this game.  I've played it on the computer
before and the Lynx version is very well done.  No trouble at all in seeing
the tiles.  The musice adds to the game alot.  4 different songs to choose
from.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HeadHunter (Bob Jones from Chicago, IL)
12:22:42 am  Sep. 24, 1991

This is a must game for the Lynx or any computer for that matter.  I
have the ST version and this one is even better.  This is a game that
you will always find yourself playing long after the initial purchase.
Since each game is different the challange remains fresh.  The only
drawback I saw is that the tiles are a bit hard to see.  But then I'm
use to playing the ST version.

Commander (Heather Perry from Scottsdale, AZ)

This is an AWESOME game and the music is wonderful.  My rating on the
ComLynx feature in this game is really quite unfair as I haven't played
it with the link-up.  I'm sure, by the way the rest of the game is,
that that feature deserves more credit than I gave it.:)

    To be honest I've had my Lynx for about a year and it has become
mostly a Shanghai slave.  Nothing quite like playing Shanghai before
heading to sleep...

My favorite game.  The multiplayer combat mode is the best thing around.
Plus, you get a nifty exploration game in other modes.  Either would
justify purchase.

Steven Foust from Tempe, AZ

This is the best mutli-player game to date.  This game is filled with mazes
galore in which you compete to find the exit or just survive the barrage
of other players attempting to -slime- you.

OUTSTANDING!  This game is a must have!  Kept a friend & I ComLynxed
from 1am to 5am playing Action from beginning to end!  NOT for the faint
of heart!  I spent three days completing Logic.  The zit-popping contest
is just gross enough to make you play it!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Big J (Jared Addington from Fort Worth, TX)

This game is very good but and a lot of action but gets a little boring
after awhile but the passwords help along in this catagory.  The multiple
levels changing in appearance as you move along is a nice touch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G Hill (George Fill from Opelousas, LA)
04:29:44 am  Aug. 5, 1991

The graphics on this game are very good. No music to speak of except
for the title screen. The rest sounds more like random sound effects.
The game got very repetitious after awhile.  But then again I haven't
played it multiplayer yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jabberwock! (S. Michael Hallack from Jacksonville, FL)
09:52:16 pm  Sep. 12, 1991

Slime World is the only 8 player Lynx game to date.  At first, it may
not seem to work well as a multiplayer game, yet there really can be
a spirit of cooperation.  If another player gets slimed, you can douse
him with your water gun and wash all of the slime off!  More importantly,
when in multi-Lynx mode, a new adventure is added, combat!  The animation
is outstanding, the walls seem to be alive, as does the slime-falls that
cascade over the subterranean landscape.  It is either a game you will
love or hate, there is nothing in between, either slime facinates you,
or it disgusts you, but if it interests you, there is a HUGE amount of
terrain covered with it in this game.

Yar (Peter Johnson from North Bay, ON, Canada)
09:42:16 pm  Nov. 10, 1991

This is a great adventure game.  I still find new passages and short cuts
to the exits on each level.  Keeps the game interesting long after you
have finished each level.  That is not to say each level is a snap tho,
they can take several hours  to complete.  The only dislike about the
game is the annoying scroll which doesn't seem to display the areas that
are the most interesting to you.  It does its own thing.  Still it should
be included in everyone's library.  Lynxing with other players really makes
the game shine!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dale Overton from Mesa, AZ
01:07:02 am  Nov. 24, 1991

  Keeping in mind I've had a Lynx and Slime World a short time, I've
been thoroughly impressed with Slime World.  I've only finished 3 of
the Adventures so far, but found each one intriguing in it's own way.
I feel I will continue to enjoy it after all adventures have been solved,
and I imagine multi-players adventures would be quite entertaining.
  If there is a fault, it is only the intro.  Slime World has perhaps
the most boring intro screen I've seen so far, and an uninspiring musical
score.  The game itself more than makes up for that, however.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dolphin (Rob Besett from Scottsdale, AZ)
12:53:54 pm  Mar. 5, 1992

This game is a must in your game library.  Its stunning graphics and
chilling music are fantastic.  The only problem I have with this game is
that you can't put it down... and when you finally get past the different
levels you might not want to play this game again for a while.  In short,
this game is to Lynx carts what Star Wars is for a video tape library-it's
great, well done, and a MUST have.

OK Atari...enough with the posters.  Who's idea was this anyway??  Turbo
Sub from Atari is a pretty straight forward shooter from the first person
perspective (i.e. Warbirds).  The controls are very sensitive and responsive
for the most part except when there's too many aliens/objects on the
screen at once, then you have a nice little slowdown.  It's not too bad
but enough to be annoying.  Good graphics and smooth animation for the
most part and a pretty good tune at the title screen along with some
of the smoothest scaling I've seen yet on a Lynx game make this that
high action shooter that Zarlor Mercenary should have been.  This is
suposed to be a two player game.  At least according to the box and that
awful poster with the instructions which tell you virtually nothing especially
how to play TurboSub as a 2 player game.  If you like blowing away hordes
of nasty alien hordes..this one's for you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leo (Leo Black from Colorado City, AZ)

Turbo is the word.  This game is a lot of the same thing.  You go up
above the water and then down below up above down below.  I don't like
it.  The title screen and music are very poor!  A bunch of the same old
thing up and down.  You start with 10 Lives, you need them but usually you
don't play it that long though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Dukeshire from Haverhill, MA
08:00:00 pm  Oct. 6, 1991

Turbo Sub is a pretty good show-off game for the Lynx.  Every person
I've shown this game to has been impressed and couldn't put it down.
 
I personally thought the game was too easy.  First off, you get too many
lives at the beginning of the game.  It should have been dropped down
to around 5 lives instead of 10.  This would have given it more of a
challenge.  The graphics are nice, especially the dive-up sequence from
the ocean.  The windshield wipers gives a nice effect.
 
If you're looking for a mindless shoot'em up game, this is the one to
grab!  You may finish it pretty fast, but you'll probably still find
yourself picking it up again and again.

What a waste!  When I saw this game at CES I thought, -Wow, that looks
like a game I would want.-  But now that it is out, its one of the last
games I want to get.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norman Bates from Stockton, CA
02:59:12 pm  Oct. 13, 1991

Again, I REALLY DISLIKE the poster form of the instructions.  The fact
that the instructions are vague at best does not help matters any either.
I think the explosion sound effects could be better instead of sounding
like an 8-bit Sound statement!  All-in-all I really do like this game
it has keep me entertained since I got it it.  I think it is difficult
but not too difficult.  I believe that the 10 ships is a nice touch to
enable you to at least get started in the begining on how to use it.
If you have to spend $34 to get it I think it is worth it (that is what
I paid).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Big J (Jared Addington from Fort Worth, TX)
07:03:32 pm  Nov. 23, 1991

I thought Turbo Sub was a great game.  Nice graphics and smooth animation
plus some great scaling effects.  The sound could have been better but
it did not downgrade the game itself any.  If you like a multi-level action
shoot'em up with a little challenge then Turbo Sub is for you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G Hill from Opelousas, LA
11:42:56 am  Nov. 25, 1991

Turbo Sub is a nice little shoot'em up game.  But it has the potential
to get old real quick.  There doesn't seem to be much variety in the things
you go up against; at least as far as I have gotten into the game.  The
game is a nice little diversion after a hard day of trudging through
Slime World or getting puzzled out on Shanghai.

   Warbirds offers the best mulit-player action to date.  While it is a
little too easy in single player mode, multiplayer offers a great deal of
challenge.  The ability to tailor each player's ammunition, damage and
number of lives helps even out the game for inexperienced players.  The
manual packaged with the game is the best Atari has produced for any Lynx
product so far.  It includes many illustrations and is in FULL COLOR.
Overall a good single player game and a great multiplayer game.

Makes my Lynx just what I always wanted - a pocket flight simulator!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Kovach from Mesa, AZ
01:35:48 am  June 12, 1991

Finally, another Lynx game that causes me to physically react in relation
to the action on the screen--my legs move from side to side, and I find
myself moving my Lynx in futile attempts to make my plane turn more sharply!
If this game did not have the ComLynx Feature, it would rate about 1.5
points lower overall, in my eyes.  The single player game opponents are
not nearly as challenging as my friends are.  Also, the fun is doubled
for every additional person playing!  I've played with as many as 3 people,
and can't wait until next week when we play 4!  The Gameplay and ComLynx
make this game--the graphics could be a little more detailed (the ground
in particular), but that probably would have slowed things down.  The
landing sequence looks a little strange-but who has time to land anyway!
Not only is this a 'pocket flight simulator', it is a 'multi-player pocket
air battle simulator'!

Clinton Smith from Chicago, IL

Warbirds is a real stunner that shows just how powerful the Lynx is and
what it's capable of.

This is the first time I gave any game a 5 for Packaging and Presentation
because the booklet was very well done and was in -COLOR- as well.  The
ComLynx feature is beyond words.  This is the first flight sim that I
actually have head-to-head combat with three other players instead of just
one.

Great graphics, amazing game.  My 1st Lynx game, so far still challenging.

Great multiplayer capability.  Could use more options (teams or battle
against the computer)  gets rather dull with only 1 player, though.

Wow!  This is the type of game that you always wished a game system could
do!  Although the graphics are not highly detailed, they are very clean,
well done, and frankly, anything more would probably just get in the way
during combat.  The ComLynx feature in this game is fantastic!  The one
player game, against the computer, is far too simple.  You'll quickly
learn to send all the enemy planes down in flames without much trouble...
hook up with another player, however, and watch the sparks fly!  Controls
are smooth and give the sensation of flight.  I was particullarly
impressed with the sounds when using headphones instead of the built
in speaker...  GREAT GAME!!!

Warbirds is the quinessential ComLynx game for the Lynx and it must be
viewed in that manner.  The manual is the best and unfortunately last
such effort before the horrendous posters took over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Postman (Bernie Bresnahan from Waterford, MI)
09:43:50 pm  Sep. 11, 1991

The best thing about Warbirds is it GamePlayability.  You have several
options to pick from so that each game is potentially different.

The Jabberwock! (S. Michael Hallack from Jacksonville, FL)
09:59:22 pm  Sep. 12, 1991

The first true flight simulator for a dedicated games machine, and it's
on the Lynx!  Dogfighting other players is awesome, but it's too easy to
run into them, bur that's ok, because that feature can be turned off.
Most importantly, this game has the BEST clouds I have ever seen...  it's
really interesting to hide in them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leo (Leo Black from Colorado City, AZ)

Warbirds is a great multiplayer game.  Every Lynx owner should have one.
Gets dull fast with one player.  Very exciting with 4 players.  Needs
more multiplayer options, and could use more weapons (like back machine
guns and missiles on the front.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ike (Isaac Black from Colorado City, AZ)

This game is better as a multiplayer game, however it is a good game
for killing time if you don't have something better to do.

I can't believe they finally made a totally 3-D flight-simulator-type game.
It's just like playing something on the ST, or as close as you can get!
It's pretty amazing, the stuff they put on a little chip--everything is in
-real space-, so it's more realistic than, say, the typical shoot-'em-up.
Good one if you like simulators!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jarius (Jarius Jenkins from Bronx, NY)
10:39:08 pm  Mar. 29, 1992

This game NEEDS extra players.  Shooting down a friend is always great...
that's why plane simulations are so popular, and this is a good one for a
game system (especially a hand held).

Personally, this game was one of the best I have played.  Well at that
time it was.  I soon got tired of it even after mutli-player mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Foust from Tempe, AZ

This is another arcade conversion that I feel would be better if they
would have spiced it up in some way or another.

Eric (Eric Goodman from Paradise Valley, AZ)

Xenophobe is a pretty good shoot-em-up.  It also has some cool effects and
graphics.  There are also some neat aliens.  As good as it sounds I might
not recommend it because it's probably one for shoot-em-up fans ONLY!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Captain Fantastic (Steven Cordine from Fayetteville, NC)
10:54:12 pm  Sep. 18, 1991

Xenophobe is one of the best games I've played on the Lynx.  As to long term
playability, I have played it for up to 5 hours at a setting.  The graphics
outperform any version of Xenophobe I have seen on any other system
(especially Nintendo).  The animation is smooth, and quite believable.  The
sound effects and music are also top notch.  It's quite challenging when you
get up to the higher levels, but with a team, (two or more ComLynxed) it
becomes quite easy until you get to the highest levels.  This however does
not detract from the fun of the game.  This is one of the first games for the
Lynx I have gotten, and I still play it almost every time I pick up the Lynx.
To close, I must give this game my highest recommendations as a definite
MUST HAVE!

Sianara (John Gall from Paradise Valley, AZ)
01:14:44 am  Oct. 18, 1991

A great game, but it slows down when you get too many -Critters- on the
screen at the same time (The ONLY drawback).  I believe it would be cooler
if you could be an Alien anytime, not just when you're ComLynxed.

A very good game.. Only thing is sometimes you wish it would scroll faster
and if you got to the sixth level you could get a code to start there again
if you die.. Also includes the game of LIFE.. See other articles on that..
There's is a 4 player mode with the ComLynx cable.  I have never tried
it but heard it's great with 4 players but teamwork is the keyword.

John Thornburgh from Mountain View, CA
12:04:28 am  June 1, 1991

I don't like games like this where you just shoot and get shot all the
time.  I prefer discreet hits that matter.  It is better to have to aim,
and dodge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sean Bryant from Mesa, AZ
09:59:58 pm  June 30, 1991

The only thing I really found fun to play with in this game was the LIFE
Easter Egg.  I have more fun with that then the game itself!!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Foust from Tempe, AZ
12:22:34 pm  July 6, 1991

This game has received mixed reviews.  First of all I would like to say that
the graphics in this game are incredible, second I can finish this game
every time I play it because the enemy is so predictable.  Even so I still
have a blast playing this game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Big J (Jared Addington from Fort Worth, TX)
01:00:46 am  July 7, 1991

This game was excellent.  This kind of fast moving multiple level game
is the most challanging and fun.  Although there is no password feature
learning the levels little by little get very interesting.  The animation
and end level boss characters were very nice. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Groo (James Nickeforek from Vancouver, BC, Canada)
12:47:38 am  July 16, 1991

I found this game to be a good arcade game along the lines of Xenon II
but once completed there is little to draw you back.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norman Bates from Stockton, CA
11:35:38 pm  July 29, 1991

I thought it would just be another shoot-em-up BUT I was way WRONG! 
I really do enjoy it a lot!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Praetor (Scott Standiford from Salt Lake City, UT)
02:15:40 am  Sep. 3, 1991

First off, if you don't like vertical scrolling shoot'em ups, you probably
won't like Zarlor Mercenary.  However, if games like Xevious are your
thing, you'll probably love this game.  The graphics are very well done,
the backgrounds are highly detailed and the sprites are equally well
done.  This is a hard game, make no mistake, but fun, none the less.
When I finally finished level 6 I found myself wishing there were more.
It is a somewhat short game, but it is fun getting to the end.  All in
all, a very well done game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JeffTz (Jeffrey Tschiltsch from West Hills, CA)
11:58:46 pm  Mar. 6, 1992

This game looks great, with some excellently detailed graphics. While
the number of enemies on the screen at one time is impressive, I felt
the ship moved too slow (even with powerups) and the difficulty too high
that I quickly became bored with the game.  Might be better ComLynxed,
but I doubt it.
