 Xx COMDEX PREVIEW - ATARI TO LOOK GOOD!
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            by John Nagy
 
 
 Fall '89 COMDEX is billed as the -Gateway to the Global Marketplace- and
 begins Monday, November 13.  Atari is preparing a major exhibit
 featuring a two-floor impressive booth, similar to the gala plazas from
 IBM and ZENITH that dwarfed the Spring '89 Atari booth.

 The placement for the Atari booth will again be outstanding, facing a
 major entrance to the Las Vegas extravaganza that will feature over 1700
 exhibitors.  COMDEX is an international convention of computer industry
 manufacturers who are looking for distribution.  Everything is aimed at
 the reseller, who comes to these shows to make deals and plans for the
 next year's marketing and sales strategies.  Vendors will include Micro
 and Super Micro Computers and software, Mini computers and software, CAD
 /CAM, peripherals, communications and board level products, Desktop
 Publishing and graphics, custom software, furniture and accessories,
 supplies, support, and more.  Seminars are scheduled each of the five
 days of the show, which will be one of the years larger Vegas crowds.

 Atari will repeat their format of presenting -MANY- third party
 developers at the sprawling Atari booth.  The attendance list is like a
 who's-who of Atari developers, each showing their product to help
 demonstrate the power of the Atari market.  This year, Atari will be one
 of only two booths that will be showing a MAC compatible laptop.... Dave
 Small's GCR cart in the STACY makes it just as capable at 1/3 the price
 of the Apple version... and those who have seen both say the STACY has a
 better screen!  Dave will be at COMDEX, having just made some successful
 last minute adjustments to his system after finding that the internal 40
 meg hard drive in the sample STACY would not operate with the GCR.

 Lots of Atari hardware will be shown, with the TT 68030 machines in the
 spotlight.  Numbers of popular applications will be shown running on the
 new machines, many on the huge Moniterm monitors that will be everywhere
 in the booth, in order to demonstrate the compatibility and speed
 advantage of the new machine.

 The PC line will be again shown, featuring the ABC nameplate (ATARI
 BUSINESS COMPUTER), with the PC4-X AT 286 machine as the flagship.
 Availability is posted as -first quarter 1990-.

 Portfolio will likely bring even more attention since the world has
 found out about it since the last COMDEX, and may lure many dealers and
 distributors to the full Atari lineup... or at least make them more
 aware that there IS a lineup.

 The STE will likely be there showing the first Atari software to make
 use of the 4,096 color palette and digital stereo sound... a game called
 -White Water- with lots of action, graphic sophistication, and super
 sound.  Some of us will moan, hearing that the STE will thus begin its
 public life with a GAME branded on its screen.  But what else should we
 expect from an Amigakiller?

 Atari will have several announcements during the show, including the
 formal introduction of DESKSET II, actually ready for market and in the
 warehouses.  This long-awaited -typography- system differs from other
 Desktop Publishing packages in at least one dramatic way... it ONLY will
 print to an ATARI SLM804 Laser printer OR a LINOTYPE setup!!!  This
 incredible limitation will certainly make DESKSET II look for a very
 narrow market.

 Also long awaited is the -document processor- called WORDFLAIR.  Long
 under development by BLUE CHIP under contract to Atari, WordFlair rights
 were released by Atari and it will be sold as a third party product.
 Atari is rumored to have wanted changes in the product that Blue Chip
 was unwilling to make, so they parted ways.  Blue Chip will, however, be
 at COMDEX as well, looking for their own distribution channels.

 Look for COMDEX announcements from ST*ZMAG/ZMAG during the week as we
 will keep up on any breaking news.  ST*ZMAG will have reporters on the
 COMDEX floor to bring the latest information to our readers.  Also be
 sure to get our next ST*ZMAGAZINE issue as we will present a detailed
 overview of the COMDEX that may have the largest ATARI presence of all
 time.  ZMagazine readers will see an overview of the Comdex show in two 
 weeks in Issue #181, November 26.

 The McDonnell Douglas/St. Louis Computer Fair was held in Building 33 of
 the McDonnell Engineering Campus today.  Several thousand people enjoyed
 viewing a wide variety of computers ranging from the Timex Sinclair to
 the the NeXT.
 
 Atari turned out to be the suprise hit of the show thanks to the well
 orchestrated displays and demonstrations of the entire range of Atari
 hardware.  Crowds around the Atari area were typically two to four times
 larger than those observing the other computer families.  I couldn't
 help but grin as I heard -Atari makes computers too?- from folks
 strolling through.  The various local Users Groups, Randall's Computers,
 and Atari all contributed to the Atari area at the show.

 Items demonstrated at the Fair never before widely seen in St. Louis
 included the Stacey, Spectre GCR, MegaFile 44 removable cartridge drive,
 Moniterm Monitor, Atari Laser Printer, the T16 Accelerator board, PC
 Speed, and the Portfolio. 

 This was my first opportunity to see the STacey.  The machine at this
 show was a production prototype that contained 4 meg of memory and a 40
 meg hard drive.  The blue backlighted LCD screen was sharp and easy to
 read.  The keyboard had a very nice feel with a positive click when
 pressing a key.  The trackball will take some getting used to.  I
 thought a little extra friction on the ball would help keep the cursor
 from running away.  Bob Brodie indicated the machine did not have a
 Blitter or internal modem in its current configuration.  He also gave me
 the impression Atari is as anxious to start shipping STacey as are those
 waiting.   Atari is currently working towards FCC approval of the
 machine.  I hope so, Atari will not have any trouble selling these guys.
 
 Calmus occupied a Mega 4 connected to the Moniterm Monitor most of the
 day printing documents to the Atari Laser Printer.  The Moniterm is as
 wonderful as every one has claimed, the Atari Laser is faster than I
 imagined.  The MegaFile 44 was also connected to this machine.  Bob
 Brodie indicated he thought the MegaFile 44 should be very close to
 release.

 A VCR in the front rest area played ST generated video animations to the
 enjoyment of those needing to rest their feet.  Another ST displayed
 animations real time.  Sterling Webb, the author of Seurat (published in
 the 3/89 issue of STart) demoed his latest creation tha allowed full
 screen manipulation of IMG files in color.  He had not decide how to
 sell/distribute the program at this time.

 MIDI demo's made sure the entire hall knew where the ST area was
 situated.  Members of the MIDI Sig showed all the latest in MIDI
 hardware and software.  I noticed the Amiga Sig on the other end of the
 hall never did get their MIDI hardware operational :-)

 PC Speed performed flawlessly throughout the show.  It also flawlessly
 emulated how boring the PeeCee's really are ;-)  The Portfolio generated
 a lot of interest also.  I wonder if Bob ever got a chance to show it
 off over in the IBM end of the hall?

 The Spectre GCR generated a great deal of interest from Atari and
 Macintosh users alike (a Mac Portable was at the show also).  Many of
 the top Mac products were loaded into the machine and demonstrated.
 Operation was so easy and straight forward most people didn't even
 notice the GCR.  Claude Bramwell of the MDC RCC Atari Sig was sucessful
 in getting Adobie Type Manager operating under GCR with a Star printer
 during the show, generating some very nice printed output.  Towards the
 end of the show, the Spectre GCR was moved to the Mega/T16 providing a
 pronounced performance increase.  Several people who use the Mac every
 day were noticably impressed (me too).

 A couple of Atari 8 bit machines faithfully demonstrated Atari's roots.
 Matt Ratcliff had his latest software creation displaying full
 resolution Degas pictures on a monochrome 130XE screen.

 Local Atari users particularly appreciated the visit by Bob Brodie of
 Atari and Jeff Williams of GEnie.  Bob and Jeff kept busy answering the
 same questions a thousand times while showing off the STacey and
 Portfolio to all.  After the show, members from the three local users
 groups accompanied Bob and Jeff for supper before the area wide users
 group meeting.

 The Users Groups meeting was opened by Bob Brodie giving a little
 history of how and why he came to Atari.  Jeff Williams presented GEnie
 and the services it offers (half those present have GEnie accounts).
 The meeting then moved on to a very frank and open 2 1/2 hour discussion
 of Atari and its future.  The bottom line was the impression that Atari
 users have a valuable resource in the form of Bob Brodie listening to
 their needs within Atari.  We, as Atari users, share responsibility in
 having our needs met, by effectively communicating what we need from
 Atari.

 The STacey shown at the McDonnell Douglas Computer Fair on November 4
 was a 4 meg model with a 40 meg hard disk built in.  Also the STacey has
 midi in and out ports.  Being a self-contained system, the STacey will
 become the computer of choice for musicians. 

 The STacey has a very readable blue LCD screen and a full size keyboard
 that had a nice touch to it.  It has a built in track ball and a port to
 plug in a mouse.  The track ball makes use away from home convenient.  I
 found the track ball to be a little to fast for me.  A hope that the
 final production version is slower.

 The STacey that Atari showed had the ADAP software from Hybrid Arts
 installed on the hard disk.  Since we just found out the details about
 the show only two days in advance, our attempts to get in touch with
 Hybrid Arts failed.  Our calls to Hybrid Arts were answered by a
 receptionist who tried to be helpful but didn't know the answers to our
 questions and was unable to connect us up with anyone who did in time
 for the show.

 The STacey with sampling and sequencing software installed in it will
 make a killer system.  The Atari Rep at the show stated that Atari was
 shooting for an under $4,000 price for the 4 meg STacey with 40 meg hard
 drive.  The STacey has not yet been released in the United States.

 As part of the midi demo at the show, we were running demo version of
 Tiger Editor by Dr. T.  It got a very good response from all who tried
 it with the only negative comment being the amount of time to load a
 .MID format file.

 We demoed sequencer programs for most of the day ranging from Music
 Studio 88 to Miditrack running synthesizers from Kawai and Casio.  The
 stereo Tweety Board was also installed on the system we were using.

 A thanks goes out to Randall Kopchak from ACE Saint Louis and Tom
 Bergeron, editor of Recording and Publishing News, for working the midi
 area of the Atari booth all day.

 Yes, Bob and Jeff did an excellent job.  We should note that the STacy's
 640x400 display is similar in resolution to a standard EGA display for a
 PC.  Just down the hall Epson was showing off its latest 80286 laptop
 machine with EGA resolution, backlit LCD graphics.  The STacy's display
 beat it hands down.  The STacy was sharp and crips at every pixel.  On
 the Epson's display the screen was -mottled-, inconsistend shades of
 gray over a full screen - it was a bit difficult to look at.

 The STacy display is quite impressive.  It will sell very well, as soon
 at it makes it to market in force.

 Thanks for the kind comments, one and all!  Of course, *NONE* of this
 would have been possible without the efforts of the fine folk in the
 St. Louis area!  Kudos to the McDonnell Douglas Recreational Computing
 Club- Atari SIG for inviting Atari to the show, Randall's Home Computing
 for their presence, and willingness to act as a receiving agent for all
 the material I sent, Eastside Users Group- President Hank Vize, who took
 a phone call from me and made things happen, and PEOPLE show up (thanks
 a lot, Hank. REALLY!!), the many members of St. Louis ACE that I got to
 meet, and last, but certainly not least, my good friend, Matt Ratcliff
 who was the personal chauffuer of the -Jeff and Bob Show-, hauling us
 all over town, to and from the airport, and to miscellaneous other
 functions!

 I had a great time, I think WE all opened a lot of eyes to the many fine
 benefits that Atari Computers offer!  I look forward to visiting St.
 Louis again!  Maybe by then we can give a Stacy for the door prize!!  If
 we do, let's hope an Atari user wins!  The 520-ST FM was won by an IBM
 user, who promptly approached Randalls about trading up to a 1040!!!!!!

 I was really impressed with the effort put forth by all of the users at
 the show.  They helped put on 99.9% of the demos.  Spectre GCR with the
 Turbo 16 is very impressive indeed.  The big Moniterm had the Mac users
 looking at their Radius screen rather fornlornly. <<Thanks, Nathan!!
 You nailed the problem on the head!!>> The others who have already
 described the ongoing activities have already listed most of the events
 of the day.

 Thanks, once again, for inviting Atari, and supporting our efforts in
 such a fine fashion!! It was indeed a pleasure...

                                                           Press Release
 
 From Z Innovators

 If you or someone you know is planning to order OASIS 4.6 BBS, then
 please read this notice.  The contract between MAX Systems and Z
 Innovators is null and void.  The agreement announced by MAX Systems in
 a press release on August 21, 1989, is NOT in effect.  The following NEW
 policy is effective immediately.
 
 You must pay a support fee of $25.00 for access to Oasis 4.6 files and
 SysOp help on XBN BBS.   Once your BBS account has been validated, you
 will have access to download all OASIS 4.6 files.

 I apologize for any inconvenience this new policy may cause you.  If
 necessary, send a copy of your cancelled check to MAX Systems, or a copy
 of your money order receipt, (no stubs will be accepted), and I will
 grant you access.
 
 I recommend that if you plan to order access to OASIS 4.6 support, you
 should first obtain OASIS TEST DRIVE from a BBS nearer to you.  OASIS
 TEST DRIVE is a FREE, shareware version of OASIS 4.6 BBS.  The only
 differences are that OASIS TEST DRIVE is limited to only two MBE's, 70
 password accounts per MBE, and no user file transfers.  You can run a
 BBS with OASIS TEST DRIVE and thereby better understand the system
 before you order access to support.  Converting an OASIS TEST DRIVE BBS
 to OASIS 4.6 is very simple.

 To download OASIS TEST DRIVE, or to obtain more information, call XBN
 BBS at (617)-380-7886.  This number is PC Pursuitable on the MABOS node.
 The program and a support section is also available on GEnie services.

 To order access to OASIS 4.6 support, send a check or money order for
 $25.00, made payable to Z Innovators, to the following address:

 Z Innovators
 1344 Park St.
 Dept. 187
 Stoughton, MA 02072

 In summary, you cannot order OASIS 4.6 BBS from MAX Systems.  MAX
 Systems is NOT authorized to sell OASIS BBS.  Instead, order access to
 OASIS 4.6 support on XBN BBS, from Z Innovators.

 Xx THE CURIOUS FUTURE OF ATARI 8-BIT COMPUTERS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         Commentary by Douglas Skrecky of Garden City ACE, Victoria B.C.
 
 
 An Atari 8-bit computer plus disk drive costs about the same as a new
 Atari ST with a single sided drive.  So much for the Atari 8-bit.  We
 wouldn't give two bits for the future of the 8-bits, or would we?

 A few years back Atari was selling more videogame machines than anyone
 else.  This machine, called the 2600 wasn't the best unit around.  All
 of the major competitors offered machines with superior graphics and
 sound.  Why did the 2600 beat Intellivision and the Coleco to the punch?
 It was cheap, very cheap.  The 2600 was the result of a sort of pre-
 Tramiel 'Power without the Price' strategy.  What does the past success
 of the 2600 have to do with the future of the 8-bits?

 Granted, a disk drive is going to cost about the same whether it is for
 an ST or an 8-bit computer.  Granted, that as a result the 8-bits are
 finished as a viable computer system.  Atari must have realized this
 when it repackaged the system as the XE game machine.  If the machine
 were successful, it would encourage programers to port versions of all
 the new games onto the 8-bit, and thus insure a continued support for
 present 8-bit computer owners.

 The only trouble is that the XE game machine is a bust.  The reasons for
 this are not hard to find.  Videogame machines are as popular as ever.
 Nintendo is making a fortune selling its videogame unit.  Why does the
 Nintendo fly while the XEG flops?  Quite simply, it is the better unit
 of the two, and it sells for about the same price.  Atari made the
 mistake of competing head to head with Nintendo using an inferior
 machine.  An 8-bit game machine could easily duplicate the success of
 the 2600 provided the 2600 strategy is used.  Forget the laser gun.
 Toss out the keyboard.  Remove the built-in game and BASIC.  Even the
 64K of RAM is not needed to run the vast majority of cartridges.  Cram
 the 8-bit down into a modern version of the 2600 and you could sell it
 with a modest joystick for $40, or the price of a single Nintendo game
 cartridge.  Then sit back and make the profit from the sales of $15
 Atari cartridges.  It'll sell like hotcakes.

 Editor's note:  Doug Skrecky enjoys programming his 8-bit Atari using
 Action!  He has had several articles published in Antic Magazine.

 Xx  -REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPTS- PART 1 - -COMPATIBILITY-

 The -Concise- edition of the RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY defines
 comzpatzizble as -capable of existing together in harmony-.  It falls on
 page 179 in my edition... just under -compassion- and just above
 -compatriot- and lost amongst the more than 70,000 entries from cover to
 cover.  It is interesting to note that a 1969 edition of the CONDENSED
 COMPUTER ENCYCLOPEDIA published by the McGraw-Hill Book Company does not
 have a definition for compatible listed at all.
 
 Somewhere during the twenty years designated from 1970 to 1990, the word
 -compatible- has leaped from the pages of our desktop dictionaries and
 into our narrowly focused computer minds.  It is possibly the most
 referenced word we use while making an effort to describe a system or
 inquire about one.

 I can not be certain about you, but -compatibility- is extremely
 important to me.  -Compatibility to what?-, you may logically ask.
 Well, if you are reading an Atari orientated publication, we may be able
 to assume that an article printed there would be about Atari computers.
 Your assumption that compatibility is important to me relative to Atari
 computers would be accurate.  If I am very specific, I may be directed
 to an Atari ST publication.
 
 Atari Corp. has recently released Portfolio; an MS-DOS -compatible-
 micro-wonder.  They may soon release their threatened PC clones here in
 the U.S.  Now, while an Atari publication has the ability to instantly
 be compatible to whatever Atari decides to manufacture, my disk drive
 still clunks on anything except Atari 16-bit compatible software.
 
 The Portfolio is a fine piece of equipment.  It certainly has its
 advantages to the non-traditional Atari consumer, but it does not
 support the machine I invested thousands of dollars in.

 When I am in the market for a Portfolio I will reference the honorable
 mentions in the Atari publications.  For in-depth coverage, I will buy
 an MS-DOS magazine.  I am extremely pleased to know that the Atari
 publications are supporting the established base of Atari users... not
 necessarily non-compatible electronics Atari decides to put it's name
 on.
 
 I can't imagine an established Atari magazine publishing an
 -incompatible- issue, can you?

 For information on how you can -JOIN THE REVOLUTION- and actively
 support the exposure of Atari computers, send $6.00 to ARTISAN SOFTWARE,
 P.O.  Box  849,  Manteca, California 95336.  An ST/MEGA compatible disk-
 based HANDBOOK will be rushed to you by return mail.  The HANDBOOK is
 also available from ST INFORMER, MEGABYTE COMPUTERS (Hurst, Texas) and
 as a download from COMPUSERVE, GENIE and DELPHI.
