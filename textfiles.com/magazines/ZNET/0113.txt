A few things to tell you about before we get into this weeks edition.  As 
you may have noticed, we have changed the publishing date of this 
magazine.  This has been done at the request of the editor.  Future issues 
will become available after 9pm eastern time on the services.

I have received a few letters over the past few weeks in reference to the 
Syndicate BBS being down.  At the present time, I DO NOT plan on putting 
the BBS system back online.  Due to obligations and my schedule, I cannot 
donate the time to a BBS system.  We are however planning a return soon 
after summer.  I will update this situation when warranted.

PCPursuit users of the Newark area have been given a break.  PCP has 
announced on the service BBS that they are going to continue service in 
the area.  Good news!  They are also adding more call nodes to New Jersey 
cities.  Stay tuned for more details next week.

This week I have included a ZMag Survey.  This survey is intended to poll 
the readers on future plans.  Please take a few minutes and print it out 
and send it to the addresses listed.  You can also leave email on the 
services.

I would also like to ask everyone a question about the 8 bit computer they 
might be reading this issue on.  How do you feel about it?  Do you feel 
that it has a future life?  Do you think there is going to be future 
software releases worth running?  If you have a comment, I would love 
reading it and will include it here.  Let your voice be heard!!

ISGUR REPORTS ON ATARI           BY GREGG PEARLMAN, ANTIC ASSISTANT EDITOR

The following information about Atari Corp.  comes from May, 1988 report
from Lee Isgur, first vice president of PaineWebber Inc., advisor to the
Antic Publishing board of directors and author of the Isgur Portfolio:

(#) Atari will introduce a 68030-based computer in the fall, as well as a
    laptop ST with a built-in hard drive.

(#) In January, 1989, Atari will introduce -what will probably be the
    first 68000-based game machine.-  It should retail at around $199.

(#) Atari will double the $10 million it spent advertising video games
    last year.

(#) Management is cautious about video games and expects the current
    excitement to wane, so Atari plans to undersell the market
    continually.  Atari also will increase its emphasis on software,
    which is seen as less risky than hardware.

(#) Because of the DRAM shortage, Atari is currently producing a few
    thousand PC clones a month, but later this year, the company will
    begin making the PC-5, an 80286 machine.

(#) In addition to the 50 transputers currently in the hands of
    developers, Atari will have sent 200 more in June. The transputer
    should be available to the public before the end of the year.

(#) Atari Corp.'s first quarter 1987 results confirm that the company has
    $68.5 million cash on hand and should earn well over $1 per share in
    1988.  The Federated retail division, which Atari didn't own during
    the first quarter of 1987, lost 16 cents a share.

(#) Under Atari Corp., Federated's employees have fallen from 3,000 to
    1,900 as six stores have been closed and several others have been
    reduced.

(#) Demand for Atari products, mostly computers, exceeds supply by at
    least 50%, and that if DRAM shortages ease in the second half of
    1988, so will comparative gross margin declines.

(#) Video game sales this year should be twice last year's $80 million,
    with the Atari 7800 and XE Game System accounting for more than half
    of these sales.

(#) Over 80% of Atari's computer sales, around $400 million to $500
    million this year, are outside the United States.  Management hopes
    for 50% of computer sales to come from the United States in 1990.

(#) Atari will probably open a factory in the United States before the
    end of the year.

A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF ATARI
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

TO ATARI USER GROUPS AND ALL ATARI ENTHUSIASTS:

I was disappointed to read the negative letters and articles regarding
comments made by Neil Harris at the West Coast Computer Faire.  We at
Atari feel that our computers are the clear technological leaders in
their classes.  The XE/XL line is superior to the Commodore 64, and the
ST series beats any '286 or 8088 MSDOS machine; it also beats the touted
Macintosh (68000) machines, and even surpasses the Amiga in all areas
except for internal sound.

The educational, productivity, and entertainment software available for
the Atari machines makes for an excellent combination which yields many
uses.  My family knows, as we use an 800XL, an XE Game Machine, and a
1040STf.  Neil was only saying that the future will bring EVEN MORE
POWERFUL computers which will be easier to use, and I am sure he is right.
This statement is not meant to belittle today's models or users.

While I am communicating with you, let me clear up a few things and also
ask for your help.

The DRAM shortage is still with us and it is inhibiting our distribution
in the U.S.  We hope this will get better in the 4th quarter of '88.  In
the meantime, we will CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ATARI COMPUTER presence in the
U.S.  We will advertise this fall to keep our presence in the U.S.

I ask all of you is two things:  first, please do not pirate software.
Talk your friends out of it also.  The software community is suffering
and complaining, please police pirating so Atari software companies can
thrive.  The other favor I ask of you is to be the evangelists of the
Atari world.  Tell your friends, associates, teachers, etc., how great the
XE/XL and ST are.

LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ATARI MACHINES A STANDARD IN THE U.S.
             --- Sam Tramiel, President, Atari Corporation

YOUR 8-BIT COMES ALIVE   Bill Pike PAC
######################################
review copy loaned by IB Computers

   Here is a old fashioned hackers program.  The program retails for
$24.95 (why couldn't they just say $25.00?) and comes with a disk of
demonstration programs including a library of basic and machine language
routines to implement the various sections.  The handbook is published by
Computer Spectrum Inc.

   These sections include: Basic electronics, from how to read resistor
color codes, on to how to build power controllers and interfaces.  How to
build and use your own light pen.  How electronic switches work and how to
use them.  What serial data is and how to use it in programming and
interface it to the outside world, such as house lighting controllers etc.
How to extend the frequency range of your 8-bit computer.  How to make
your computer into a music synthesizer.  How to control a lighting display
with an 8-bit, from Christmas tree lights to commercial displays.  Other
subjects discussed include 120v power controllers, data encoders, data
decoders, event detectors and many others.

   The book is written on the High School Graduate level and assumes that
you know how to solder and assemble breadboards.  Most of the basic
information on hardware is reviewed rather than instructed until you get
down to the meat of the book.  The book includes hardware construction as
well as programming.  I wouldn't recommend this for a child, but with help
a highschooler should be able to handle it without much problem.   

   If you want to see what hacking really was, in the early days of
computing, rather than the piracy, phbreaking, and what hacking has since
been equated with.  This is the book for you.  The book also teaches how
to make a computer work in the real world not just how to get the highest
score on PACMAN.  I feel that in itself is enough to highly recommend the
purchase of this program.

8 BIT MODEM NOISE KILLER (MOD)

Captured from GEnie Services

Modem Noise Killer (alpha version).

With this circuit diagram, some basic tools including a soldering iron,
and four or five components from Radio Shack, you should be able to cut
the noise/garbage that appears on your computer's screen.  I started this
project out of frustration at using a US Robotics 2400 baud modem and
getting a fare amount of junk when connecting at that speed. Knowing that
capacitors make good noise filters, I threw this together.  This is very
easy to build, however conditions may be different due to modem type,
amount of line noise, old or new switching equipment (Bell's equipment),
and on and on. So it may not work as well for you in every case. If it
does work, or if you've managed to tweek it to your computer/modem setup
I'd like to hear from you.  I'd also appreciate any of you electronic
wizards out there wanting to offer any improvements. Let's make this work
for everyone!

Please read this entire message and see if you understand it before you
begin.  OK, what you'll need.....

   1    Radio Shack #279-374   Modular line cord   $4.95
( You won't need one if your phone has a modular plug in its base.)

   1    Radio Shack #279-420   Modular surface mount jack  $4.50
       (4 or 6 conductor)

   1    Radio Shack #271-1720  5K Potentiometer    $1.10
(  This is a 5k audio taper variable resistor.)

   1    Radio Shack #272-1055  Capacitor. Any non-polarized 1.0 to 1.5 uf
        cap should do. Paper, Mylar, or metal film caps should be used,
        although #272-996 may work as well.  (272-996 is a non-polarized
        electrolytic cap)     $.80

   1    100 ohm resistor  - quarter or half watt.  $.20

 
   1    Radio Shack #279-357 Y-type or duplex modular connector.
(Don't buy this until you've read the section on connecting the Noise
 Killer below. (A,B,or C) $4.95

First off, open the modular block. You normally just pry them open with a
screwdriver. Inside you'll find up to 6 wires. Very carefully cut out all
but the green and red wires. The ones you'll be removing should be black,
yellow, white, and blue. These wires won't be needed and may be in the
way. So cut them as close to where they enter the plug as possible. The
other end of these wires have a spade lug connector that is screwed into
the plastic. Unscrew and remove that end of the wires as well.  Now, you
should have two wires left. Green and red. Solder one end of the capacitor
to the green wire.  Solder the other end of the capacitor to the center
lug of the potentiometer (there are three lugs on this critter).  Solder
one end of the resistor to the red wire. You may want to shorten the leads
of the resistor first.  Solder the other end of the resistor to either
one of the remaining outside lugs of the potentiometer. Doesn't matter
which.

Now to wrap it up, make a hole in the lid of the mod block to stick the
shaft of the potentiometer through. Don't make this hole dead center as
the other parts may not fit into the body of the mod block if you do. See
how things will fit in order to find where the hole will go.  Well, now
that you've got it built you'll need to test it. First twist the shaft on
the potentiometer until it stops. You won't know which way to turn it
until later. It doesn't matter which way now.  You also need to determine
where to plug the Noise Killer onto the telephone line. It can be done by
one of several ways:

A. If your modem has two modular plugs in back, connect the Noise Killer
   into one of them using a line cord. (a line cord is a straight cord
   that connects a phone to the wall outlet. Usually silver in color)

B. If your phone is modular, you can unplug the cord from the back of it
   after you're on-line and plug the cord into the Noise Killer.

C. You may have to buy a Y-type modular adaptor. Plug the adaptor into a
   wall outlet, plug the modem into one side and the Noise Killer into
   the other.  Call a BBS that has known noise problems. After you've
   connected and garbage begins to appear, plug the Noise Killer into the
   phone line as described above.  If you have turned the shaft on the
   potentiometer the wrong way you'll find out now. You may get a lot of
   garbage or even disconnected. If this happens, turn the shaft the
   other way until it stops and try again. If you don't notice much
   difference when you plug the Noise Killer in, that may be a good sign.
   Type in a few commands and look for garbage characters on the screen.
   If there still is, turn the shaft slowly until most of it is gone.  If
   nothing seems to happen at all, turn the shaft slowly from one side
   to the other. You should get plenty of garbage or disconnected at some
   point. If you don't, reread this message to make sure you've connected
   it right.

OASIS BBS UPDATE
######################################
GLUE DEMO 6-12-88  By Z INNOVATORS Co.
 
The following DEMO is of a new ONLINE, SysOp MODULE for OASIS IV BBS. The
GLUE method of combining files is 100% compatible with the 8-bit and 16-
bit version of LIBRARY.COM, written by Ralph Walden.  GLUE is a more
powerful .COM file, and a revised version of Ralph's LIBR.COM and
DELIBR.COM.  GLUE does no compaction, and is used mainly for combining
and uncombing small files, quickly.  For example, a SysOp could download
a new module and it's small text file DOC, from his OASIS term mode, and
UNGLUE it and test it online.  .GLU files can be ARC'd and XARC'd and ALF
CRUNCHED with no problems ungluing after they're extracted.

This OASIS module program will be converted to run offline, and be released
into the Public Domain.  The P.D. offline version will have an added
option to do:
                         BATCH - ALF - CRUNCH   
 
 
The following sequence of commands were captured from a call FROM REMOTE
to the Official OASIS Support BBS.  The module, GLU.BBS was run online
over the modem.

Explanation of DEMO steps:
 
<#>  Went into SYSOP menu on OASIS BBS and deleted all files on D7:UGH>*.*
<#>  Ran a directory on D7:UGH>*.* to show the directory is empty.
<#>  Used SYSOP command [W] to run the module called GLU.
 
* Following functions all performed by the GLU module while BBS is up. *
 
<#>  ARC-View of contents of an ALF-Crunch file of a module shared with us
     by a Canadian OASIS SysOp.
<#>  Set BATCH filename to D1:GLU.BAT
<#>  Ran a DIR-TAG directory on D5:*.BAS
<#>  Entered my letters for filenames to be tagged in any order. They are
     saved into the D1:GLU.BAT file.  I could have done another directory
     and had those files tagged and added to the same .BAT file.
<#>  Used GLU option which used the .BAT file to get files to be GLUED.
<#>  Used View option to see contents of the file, D7:UGH>TEST.GLU.
<#>  Used UNGLU option on my .GLU file.
<#>  Did a normal DIRECTORY (no TAG) of D7:UGH>*.* to show the .GLU and
     UNGLUED results.
<#>  Quit to BBS, and ended up at BBS Main Menu prompt.
 
Be on the lookout for the P.D. offline .COM file version of GLUE!

VIRUS UPDATE Number 2    Bill Pike PAC
######################################

Well now it looks like the government has been hit by the virus scourge.
The Environmental Protection Agency & NASA have both been hit by a virus
program on personal computers within their systems.  The virus was
apparently brought in from the outside by one or more of the employees. 
It spread from there thru out the system of PC's.

It is not yet know how much damage was done over a 5 month period starting
last January.  Although damage to government data appears to be limited,
due mostly to the virus being designed for IBM and IBM clone type of
computers while most of the sensitive data was in main frame computers
which the virus couldn't infect.  The program was called the -scores
virus- it was not stated just what the virus did but it was said that many
files and data on PC's were damaged.

The FBI has been called into the investigation however since the original
source is difficult, at the least, to pin down it appears that most of the
effort is going to prevent reinfection by another more insidious virus in
the future.

The spread of the -scores- virus was exacerbated when private contractors
in the Washington and North Carolina area inadvertently sold dozens of
computers carrying the virus on hard disk to government agencies .
