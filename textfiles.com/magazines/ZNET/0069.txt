Xx ATARI NEWS UPDATE
______________________________________
From GEnie ST RT

The Atari SX212 modem is currently
shipping to Atari dealers in the USA.
The first shipment arrived at the
Sunnyvale warehouse during this past
week.

The SX212 is a Hayes-compatible modem
which operates at 1200 baud (and also
at 0-300 baud).  Its Hayes-
compatibility extends to the
S-registers.

The SX212 modem includes both the
standard RS232 port and the Atari
8-bit SIO port.  However, 8-bit users
should be aware that the software to
support this modem through the SIO is
not yet released -- in the meantime,
the modem can still be used through
an 850 or equivalent interface.

The modem package includes a power
supply (identical to the 2600's), a
detailed manual, and special offers
from the GEnie (General Electric) and
BIX (Byte Magazine) online services.

To connect the SX212 to an ST or to
any other RS232-equipped computer, a
full RS232 cable is needed -- a
3-wire cable does not work with smart
modems.

When the software is ready, Atari
will market an add-on package for
8-bit users. This will contain an SIO
cable and a disk which includes the
modem driver and the SX Express
terminal program by Keith Ledbetter.

The suggested list price of the SX212
modem is $99.95.

Commodore is about to announce a
special upgrade program for owners of
its Amiga 1000 computer system.  A
Commodore sales executive says that
the firm has just recently completed
dealer notification of the plan's
details. Participating dealers are
authorized to accept an Amiga 1000 in
trade, along with $1000, for a new
Amiga 2000 computer.  Except for a RAM
expansion device, all A1000 peripheral
devices will work with the new
computer.   --James Moran Online Today

Xx________User Group Focus___________
___________by M. G. Brown____________

As I said in my last report, The Atari
MAGIC show was a wealth of information
about what has been happening with the
Atari User groups here in the upper
Midwest. If any one group can lay
claim to the title of -host- for the
show, it would have to be the Michigan
Atari General Information Conference
(MAGIC). Now, before I get a bunch
more -hate E-Mail-, let me remind
readers that there were MANY user
groups that worked hard to produce the
successful show held in Detroit. Last
issue I mentioned the efforts of the
major players in the Detroit 'Fest.

Anyway, back to MAGIC, they are a
relative newcomer to the southeast
Michigan area, somewhat overshadowed
by longer established clubs such as
MACE. Unfortunately, I was not able to
speak much with any of the officers of
MAGIC, due to the fact that they were
somewhat short-handed at the show, and
were very busy! I did pick up a copy
of their newsletter -The Sorcerers
Apprentice- and will base all of my
comments on the information contained
in it.

First of all, MAGIC is following the
trend of other Michigan user groups
and the Michigan Atari Magazine of
format more like a magazine as opposed
to a standard newsletter. I found the
printing quality to be first rate,
although the various type styles, etc.
detracted a bit from the finished
product. It appeared as if they are in
the process of converting to an ST
based typesetting program, but this is
purely speculation. One of the most
impressive things about the MAGIC
newsletter is the fact that it is
almost 90% original material. This is
almost unheard of when so many groups
have problems getting members to
submit articles.

Something new for MAGIC, is the -disk
of the month-, available for a nominal
extra cost with the newsletter. I
found several useful utilities on the
-A- side and a neat PD slide show
utility with micro painter files
filling up the -B- side. The
newsletter was also unusual as they do
have commercial advertising. This may
become a trend as more and more clubs
strain under the burden of printing
costs for their newsletters.

The MAGIC meetings are held the first
Tuesday of each month at 7:30PM at the
Italian Community Cultural Center,
Warren Michigan, Located near Hoover
and 12 Mile Road. The annual dues are
$15. They operate two BBS systems that
can be accessed by the public:
    -MAGIC Express- at
     313-978-1685
and -MAGIC Clipboard- at
     313-368-6882.

The current officers of MAGIC as of
August 1987 are as follows:
  President- Mike Simpson
  Vice President- Chuck Macek
  Treasurer- Henry Malavolti
  Membership- Paul Attard
  Secretary- Norm Browne
  Mem. At Large- Mike Lechkun
  Newsletter Ed.- Norm Browne
                  Mike Lechkun
  Disk Librarian- Chuck Cobb

MAGIC welcomes membership applications
from individuals and would like to
swap newsletters with other groups.
Please send inquiries to their mailing
address at 28111 Imperial Drive,
Warren, MI 48093.

One more time I will ask for
contributions for this column. Due to
the recent snafu with CVACC, I will
not do any further profiles of user
groups unless the information about
the group is supplied directly by the
club itself, and I have the permission
of the club (via written approval of
the club president) to publish a
story. This will probably mean the end
of this column as a regular feature
because of the lack of submissions. If
I am to report accurate and up to date
information on group activities, I
feel that it is the responsibility of
the club itself to provide it so they
cannot come back and say that what was
reported is out of date or incorrect.

Thanks to everyone who is a regular
reader of this column for your
support. Take Care!

[Ed.  Mike is referring to an article
preview he wrote on the CVACC a few
weeks back.  We made a few errors in
the text and printed a retraction and
a correction notice.  If your local
user group would like to supply info
to Zmag for publication, Please send
to:

      WHAT'S NEW IN SIG*ATARI
        (September 7, 1987)
FIGHT THE FCC!

As previously reported, the Federal
Communications Commission has issued a
proposal that if adopted could
increase your CompuServe connect fees
by as much as $5 per hour. Unless you
take action now, this interstate
access fee could be in effect by
January 1.  CompuServe strongly
opposes the proposal and urges all
subscribers to join us in protesting
the measure by writing directly to
Congress and the FCC by September 24,
the extended deadline for filing
comments.

To help subscribers understand the
proposal and the issues surrounding
it, CompuServe has established an FCC
Information Database. The database
contains a summary of the proposal,
CompuServe's position, a list of
important points to include in your
letter to Congress and the FCC, and a
sample opposition letter.

Enter a GO WRITE or GO FCC command at
any system prompt to reach the FCC
Information Database. Educate yourself
on this most important issue and write
a letter today.

HAVE A QUESTION?

Don't forget that the message board in
all of the ATARI Forums is the best
place to ask any questions concerning
your Atari system or CompuServe.  In
addition to the very friendly and
knowledgeable Forum members who want
to help you out, each Forum is staffed
with several Sysops who want to help
you get the most out of CompuServe and
your Atari system!

Leave a message TO: ALL, SYSOP, or to
a specific person.  A listing of the
SIG*ATARI Sysop's User ID's is
available by reading the Sysop Roster
Bulletin in any of the Atari Forums or
by typing GO ATA-13.

We are looking forward to hearing from
you!

Xx COMPUTE  OCTOBER 1987
   ..From Chicago Zmag 9/9/87
______________________________________
Compute October 1987

Back when videogame magazines were all
the rage, I always used to get a kick
out of the -can I use an Atari disk
drive with my Colecovision- letters.
This month's Compute has a letter that
ranks right up at the top. A guy asked
if he could expand his Vic to run
64, 128, Amiga, or ST programs. A 64
or a 128 I might understand, but an
Amiga or an ST? Give me a break.

This month's Compute has a an indepth
look at the Amiga 500. The so called
low end of the Amiga line carries a
price tag of $595 without a monitor.
Oh one other minor detail, it doesn't
have a port to allow the use of a
composite monitor or a TV so you have
to buy the Amiga monitor which runs
for $300.

<grin>
