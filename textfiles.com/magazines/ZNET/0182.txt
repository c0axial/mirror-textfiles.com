 EDITORS DESK by Ron Kovacs
 
 This is a very special issue since it is our LAST regular edition.  
 ZMagazine will still continue through a new publication called ZNET 
 ONLINE starting January 5, 1990.
 
 With the lack of 8-bit news and reviews available we are sad to stop 
 publishing an exclusive 8-bit online, but with nothing to review or 
 cover, we are forced to use material from our sister publication 
 ST*ZMagazine.
 
 We have 4 years and over 183 issues of material which is available.  
 There will be some special 8-bit only editions released in addition to 
 the regular Friday release of ZNet Online, although not on a regular 
 basis.  The latest news in the 8-bit areas will be contained in ZNet 
 whenever possible.  Please note that we are NOT leaving the 8-bit, just 
 using another system to provide the news.
 
 In January, we will release a special index of ALL ZMagazine issues, so 
 staty tuned to your local BBS or the pay services for the file.  You can 
 also stay up to date on all releases on the ZNet BBS at (201) 968-8148.
 
 See you in January!  For the latest Atari News First, read ST*ZMagazine 
 between now and the end of the year in the ST areas on both pay 
 services, your local BBS and the ZNet BBS.
 
 Thank you for your support over the last four years.  I am very sorry 
 the state of the 8-bit community has caused us to make drastic changes. 
 We want to survive and continue our weekly updates, but can not see any 
 light through the tunnel!

 STACY CONDITIONALLY APPROVED BY FCC -- by John Nagy
 
 Atari announced two weeks ago that the FCC had finally passed the STACY
 Laptop Computer for U.S. distribution.  However, the type acceptance is
 as a CLASS A device, which is a designation for business and industrial
 use only.  This means that Atari cannot sell the Stacy as a consumer 
 device at this time, but will be able to market it to the largest and
 loudest group currently clamoring for it - professional musicians.  The
 Stacy, with its built in ST MIDI ports, is a Godsend to musicians who
 need portable equipment for performances.  As a result, the Stacy will
 be shipping -within 30 days- to anxiously waiting music stores across
 the USA, according to Atari sources.

 It seems that the power supply has been one of the most problematic of
 the electrical noise output that has prevented Stacy from FCC acceptance
 to date.  The -Type A- rating is much more forgiving than the -Type B -
 Computing Device- acceptance that will be needed before regular consumer
 /computer stores will be able to market the computer.  Atari plans to
 continue the efforts to obtain the more favorable type acceptance, even
 if some re-design of the Stacy becomes necessary.

 Musician demand appears to already be large enough to eat all of the
 first production runs of the laptop ST.  While later internal revisions
 may be drastic, even to the point of an entire new motherboard, the
 features that musicians need will likely be unchanged.  Potential
 changes include incorporation of the STE design, which is cheaper to
 manufacture and uses fewer parts, while offering added palette colors
 and digital stereo internal sound.  If this route is taken, expect a
 revised Stacy to finally make it into the consumer channels as late as
 mid 1990.

 Mac users will be livid... even Atari officials concede that a huge
 market for the Stacy lies in the Macintosh emulation of the GCR from
 Gadgets By Small.  At a third the cost of the MAC portable, the Stacy/
 GCR looks better and runs faster.  On the brighter side, the FCC has no
 -home patrol-... so just because Atari can't market through home
 computer store channels does not mean you and I can't go buy a Stacy at
 the local music store and take it home.  This is all part of the wide
 and wonderful world of Federal regulation.  Makes you feel safe, doesn't
 it?

 MIKE MORAND QUITS AS ATARI PRESIDENT: SUCCESSOR NAMED ALREADY

 In a move reported to us this week from several sources both in and
 outside of Atari, recently appointed President of Atari Computer Mike
 Morand has resigned.  Reasons for his decision are not public at this
 time, but many observers noted that Mike has not participated in recent
 public events, a signal that all was not well.  Mike was not visible at
 COMDEX, despite other Atari officials (from Jack Tramiel on down) being
 on hand.  It has been suggested that promises of what it would mean to
 be President of the family-run Atari Corp may not have panned out as
 Morand expected.

 Mike's replacement is DAVID HARRIS, a former Atari VP who left two years
 ago to start his own calculator company.  David arranged to license the
 ATARI name for his calculators, and his company was recently merged into
 Atari's consumer products division.  David is a knowledgeable and
 personable businessman who knows what to expect from the Tramiels.  We
 welcome him and hope that his return to Atari will bring success.

 
 NEW YORK DEALERS LOOKING FOR LYNX MACHINES
 
 New York retailers, who are trying to keep the new Atari Lynx portable
 color video game system on their shelves for holiday shoppers, have been
 asking Atari to ship reorders by air.  Two New York City retailers
 stated that as soon as they receive a new Lynx shipment, they call
 customers that are on the waiting list.  Any units that aren't spoken
 for are rushed to the shelves.  Managers at both FAO Schwarz and Kiddie
 City said that Manhattan consumers are snatching up the system because
 it's the only portable unit available that features full-color graphics
 and four-channel sound.  People from as far away as Los Angeles are
 phoning and asking to have the Lynx shipped to them.  In 1990, Atari
 plans to produce more than one million Lynx game systems and additional
 game cartridges.  In addition to California Games, which comes with the
 Lynx, other games, including Blue Lightning, Gates of Zendocon,
 Electrocop and Chip's Challenge will be arriving soon.

 BURGER KING GOES ONLINE

 Burger King restaurants will soon begin using an electronic ordering
 system and electronic mail as an ordering system to replace manual
 methods.  Ordering supplies for it's restuarants will become more
 accurately and consistent.  The e-mail system provides instant
 communication between restaurants through hand-held computers, PCs and
 point-of-sale work stations.
 
 FORDHAM SPONSORED BY ATARI
 
 Atari UK sponsored a 17 date UK tour of female vocalist Julia 
 Fordham.  Fordham appeared at the PC Show earlier at Atari's Music 
 stand, and Atari was present at each location showing off their 
 business and entertainment hardware and software.

 TURBO-816: For those not familiar with the Turbo-816:
 
 The Turbo-816x is a 16-bit CPU upgrade for the Atari XL/XE computer.
 This upgrade will add 16-bit working registers, a 24-bit address bus,
 and numerous new addressing modes and instructions.  All this new power
 is available to new programs written to take advantage of the new CPU,
 while maximum compatibility with current hardware, and software is
 maintained.  Included with the Turbo-816x is a new operating system
 PROM, which can be installed to replace your current Atari OS, or using
 a switch circuit, used in addition to the Atari OS.
 
 The Turbo-816x is clocked at the same speed as the original Atari CPU,
 so that current games and such will run at approximately the same speed
 as with the stock CPU.  Since the OS, Interrupts, and Floating Point
 package are more efficient than the stock OS, existing applications will
 realize a speed increase proportional to their OS usage.
 
 The Turbo-816x comes packaged with the following:
 
    - Turbo-816 adapter board for the XL/XE computer systems.
    - Turbo-OS Operating System 28-pin PROM (2 for 1200XL).
    - CPU 12 inch ribbon cable with connectors.
    - Installation, and Operating Directions.
 
 Included also are the following files on two SSSD disks:
 
  T816XRF.DOC  Turbo-OS  to Atari 400/800 & XL/XE OS cross-ref guide.
  T816CAL.DOC  Turbo-OS  function call information.
  T816INC.DOC  Turbo-OS  MAC/65 compatible include file.
  T816MAC.DOC  Turbo-816 MAC/65 compatible macros for 65816 instructions.
  T816MAP.DOC  Turbo-OS  memory map guide.
  T816BUS.DOC  Turbo-816 expansion bus pinout.
  T816SYS.DOC  Turbo-OS  system call examples.
  T816PAL.DOC  Turbo-OS  menu features, and issues.
 
 Several Example files are also included.
 
 TURBO-SRAM/PROM: The Turbo-SRAM/PROM boards are also available now.
 These boards will hold two memory devices.  Supported types are 62256
 (32k SRAM), 66204 (128k SRAM), 27128 (16k EPROM), 27256 (32k EPROM),
 27512 (64k EPROM), and 27010 (128k EPROM).  Information to configure the
 card for other devices is supplied.
 
 Both devices should be the same size, although you may have one SRAM
 device, and one PROM device.  Normally if the two devices are not the
 same size, the board is configured to support the size of the larger,
 unless the smaller device is a SRAM, in which case it is suggested that
 the card be programmed for that device (due to foldback).  This is
 programmable within certian limitations.
 
 The Turbo-SRAM/PROM board may be located from $010000 to $08FFFF as
 explicit memory, or $090000 to $0FFFFF as expanded memory.  The memory
 card will only work with the DataQue Turbo-816 proprietary bus
 structure.  It will not function with a normal 6502 (at least not
 without changes).   If used as expanded RAM, 4k of the total available
 expanded RAM will be dedicated for memory management.
 
 Included with the board is a user guide and 12- ribbon cable with with
 connectors.  The cable will support one memory card.  A larger active
 cable will support multiple (eight maximum) cards when released.
 
 TURBO-CALC:  Turbo-Calc is a cartridged based spreadsheet program for
 the Atari 800/XL/XE/XEGS/T816 systems.  It will work with, or without a
 Turbo-816 installed.  With most DOSes, there is about 20k of space
 available for spreadsheet data using Standard RAM.  If expanded RAM is
 available, the spreadsheet could potentially support up to 8Mb of cell
 information.  Obviously the Turbo-816 is required to allow access to
 expanded RAM.
 
 Turbo-Calc functions may be called one of two ways.  You may either use
 Hot-Keys to activate all commands and functions, or by a special user
 environment.  Turbo-View, is a graphical operating system (GOS), which
 is resident with application programs.  This allows the GOS to be
 customized for each application, while maintaining a common
 functionality between applications.
 
 Turbo-Calc and Turbo-View source code are available seperately to
 registered owners of Turbo-Calc.  See the price list for more
 information.  The source code of Turbo-Calc, allows the beginning 65816
 programmer a clear reference as to applying the Turbo-816, while still
 maintaining compatibility with the current 8-bit line.  The actual
 source code remains the property of DataQue Software, and is provided
 for reference purposes only.
 
 Turbo-View source has routines for handling drop down menus, buffered
 windows, joystick control, and routine selection.  The source code is
 available to developers to include into their applications.  There is a
 one-time licensing fee for Turbo-View, for programs which are to be
 distributed, in addition to the normal cost of the source code alone.
 The only other requirement is that the used of the Turbo-View routines
 be acknowledge within the application, as outlined in the provided
 documentation.
 
 PRICING: Current pricing as of 11/15/89.
 Prices subject to change without notice.  All prices are in US Dollars.

 PORTFOLIO -> 8-BIT CONNECTION
 
 
 In order to connect your 8-bit to the new PORTFOLIO computer, you have
 to know three things;
 
   1.  You have to have an RS232 interface connected to your 8-bit; the
       850, P:R: CONNECTION, or MIO devices all work well for the purpose.

   2.  You will need a null modem cable. This is a cable which connects
       two computers without the need for modems (cutting out the middle
       man, so to speak).
 
   3.  You will need to make the null modem cable (or have a friend do it
       if you subscribe to the ancient Code of the Programmer);  -Hey, I
       don't do that, it's a hardware problem!-

 ////////// PART ONE: THE PROBLEM
 
 The PORTFOLIO has file transfer capability... through the parallel
 interface.  I don't know of any 8-bit aplication to redirect
 communication software into the parallel port, so ignore the File
 Transfer section in the SETUP application.

 The RS232 ports on 8-bit computer interfaces are not compatable with
 -standard- RS232 DB-9 cables, (having been developed a few years before
 IBM stuck their foot in the PC door); pinouts are as shown below.

        8-bit           STANDARD
          1 DTR            1 CD
          2 CD             2 RD
          3 TD             3 TD
          4 RD             4 DTR
          5 GND            5 GND
          6 DSR            6 DSR
          7 RTS            7 RTS
          8 CTS            8 CTS
          9 (none)         9 RI

 Fortunately, PORTFOLIO's Serial Interface does conform to this standard,
 so that modems and IBM AT cables can be used with it.

 One other problem; the diagrams in the Serial Interface manual are wired
 wrong.  If you intend to make your own standard cables, refer to this
 service for the file detailing proper connections.  (NOTE: this file may
 be found in the ST sections of this service; for CIS, GO ATARIPRO; for
 GEnie, type ST.)

 ////////// PART TWO: THE SOLUTION

 Well, Part One ought to have scared the willies out of all but the most
 determined Solder-Jockies, so we can now proceed with our interface.

   1. Get two (2) DB-9 -D- style connectors; one Male, one Female. (NOTE:
      if you don't want to go through the hassles of soldering, pick up
      the Radio Shack crimp-style connectors [CAT #276-1427 & 276-1428,
      respectively]; with these connectors, all you do is insert the
      wires and crimp the pins closed.)

 You will also need hoods for your connections; I used the metalized
 hoods [276-1513] for my cable, as they offer the shielding ability of
 metal with the light weight of plastic.

 For the cable, I recommend [278-775] double-shielded cable, especially
 for the MIO user; the PBI bus is flat-out full of RFI, and the chance of
 data corruption from that monster makes the extra cost worthwile.

     Connections are as follows;

   8-bit (MALE)  PORTFOLIO (FEMALE)

  +--1 DTR             4 DTR--+
  +--2 CD              6 DSR--+
  +--6 DSR             1 CD (N/C)
     5 GND-------------5 GND
     3 TD--------------2 RD
     4 RD--------------3 TD
  +--7 RTS             7 RTS--+
  +--8 CTS             8 CTS--+
     9 (N/C)           9 RI (N/C)

 Cable shield attached to PF hood ONLY.

 Double check your connections before connecting to either computer.
 
 To test your interface, connect the cables to their respective
 interfaces and fire up your favorite 8-bit term software (I've used 850
 EXPRESS! and BOBTERM with equal results), and set the terminal for 300
 baud, half duplex, ATARI. The ATARI mode will be important once you
 start binary file transfer.

 For PORTFOLIO, go to the RS232 option in the SETUP menu, and set 300
 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits, and initialize.

 Force the TERM mode on your 8-bit.

     At the c> prompt, enter:

        COPY CON AUX

 Type something in to your Portfolio, press ENTER: your message from
 PORTFOLIO should echo on your 8-bit monitor.  If not, check the term
 program settings, connections, and cable pinouts.

 Congratulations! You now have a handheld computer that -talks- with it's
 older brother.

 The advantages? You can use your full-screen 8-bit for communications
 and D/L to your palmtop.  You can fill your Portfolio with programs
 without having to borrow somebody's IBM.

 And, best of all, you can compute respectfully during the day, and
 _still_ blast the bloody bejeezus out of DEFENDER at night.

 WRITE 'TIL IT HURTS   by Cy Kurtz
 
 Beautiful downtown Augusta, GA.  You've got four Atari BBS's and tens of
 others.  Competition among SysOps is rough, to say the least, for the
 attention of a limited number of users.  With a general population of
 200something thousand, the CSRA(Central Savannah River Area) is
 definitely wallowing gleefully in a glut of Bulletin Board Services.
 Most BBS's in the area boast at least 20Megs of on-line storage and some
 as much as 200Megs.
 
 Into this huge garden party, introduce a pigheaded, diehard Atari8 user,
 a dying BBS, and bingo!  You've got four aces.  THE FOUR ACES BBS, that
 is.  Running on an Atari 130xe, 3 U.S. Doubled 1050's, one ATari 810
 (can you believe it?), and an Atari SX212 modem, and severely under-
 powered, this little BBS continues to amuse, amaze, and attract more
 than its fair share of users.
 
 Who, you ask, is this SysOp?  Donald Trump?  Lee Iacocca?  Bill the Cat?
 No, Cy Kurtz is the one at the controls of this amazing vessel.  Seeing
 the BBS in severe trouble due to the ignorance and apathy of a mostly ST
 user, Cy asked for (I'll repeat that, asked for) and received steward-
 ship of his users' group's BBS.  He has been running the Aiken Augusta
 Area Atari Computer Enthusiasts (AAAACE) BBS for four months now.  Cy
 had a rough go of it for a little while, as problems ranging from
 telephone company ineptness through modem failures to lack of
 documentation plagued the BBS.
 
 Having committed time and, more importantly, money, Cy was not going to
 let all of this go to waste.  After making the rounds of the self-
 appointed geniuses in the area and receiving the same condescending
 drivel from most of them, he bought a modem.  That brought the system
 online once again and Cy was about $80.00 the wiser for it.
 
 Having the system online, while an accomplishment, was hardly enough.
 Cy set to work.  He downloaded the documentation, now shareware, from
 GEnie.  With documentation firmly in hand, he set about changing
 everything in sight.  From the welcome screens, to the logoff screen,
 nothing was safe.  He changed the upload/download file descriptions to
 allow diversification to non-Atari users.
 
 Cy, having realized that the hardware was not able to compete with other
 BBS's offering 20Megs and up, began to labor to make the users' online
 options more appealing.  Zmag began to appear with astonishing
 regularity.  Online games sprang out of the woodwork.  The results were
 beginning to show as users returning from long abscenses were pleased to
 see that the BBS was not at all what they remembered.
 
 This story of a modern day Prince Charming, whose kiss of hard work,
 intelligence, and creativity awakened a sleeping beauty BBS is a much-
 needed shot in the arm for the Atari8 telecomputing community.  It is
 not, by any means, the only good thing happening today for Atari 8-
 bitters.  Just the only one about which someone has taken the time to
 write.
 
 Cy's philosophy, of which he'll inform you with alarming candor, is that
 the Atari8 home computer is a machine.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The
 purchasers of which were and still are extremely thrifty and common-
 sensical people.  Manufacturers and software developers, armed with this
 knowledge and unable to offer anything with a similar 'bang for the
 buck', have chosen to invest elsewhere.
 
 The burden for the support of the Atari8 line rests squarely on the
 users themselves.  The sooner we quit protesting simple economic
 principles and get up off of our collective duff, the sooner we'll be
 able to reap the full value from our machines.
 
 You can call THE FOUR ACES BBS at 404-790-5593.  It's online at 3/1200bd
 24hrs/day unless Cy's working on it.

 Update!
 -------
 As of December 1st, 1989, we are now shipping version 2.0 of our XF35
 Kit ROM.  Owners who purchased the kit before that date (has -Rev. 1.0-
 labeled on the ROM), can now upgrade to this enhanced version, for only
 $10, along with their original XF35 Kit ROM.  Or, for those who prefer
 to keep the original XF35 ROM, you can send in $15, along with a copy of
 your receipt, and have the upgraded ROM as well.  Note: These prices
 INCLUDE S&H for USA/APO/FPO orders.  Add $3.50 for Canada/Mexico, or
 $6.50 for all other countries.

 Features: The Upgraded XF35 ROM fixes that -No DOS- error message, that
 you normally see on first boot-up.  Next, the density change problems
 (from single to do double, or vice versa) has been fixed.  Also, the
 read/write time has been further optimized.  A real time-saver, when
 copying several files!

 Special THANKS to Bob Woolley, for his continuing efforts on this XF35
 Kit project, and helping us make them available to the Atari community!
 Hey Bob, I want to see that Super-Deluxe Drive Controller! <grin>

 POKEY STEREO UPGRADE by C. Steinman (GEnie User:  DataQue.1)
 Presented 12/16/1989
 
 Information file for adding stereo to an Atari 8-bit computer using two
 pokey chips.  Note:  Installation of this modification will void any
 warranty you may have on your computer.  Chuck Steinman, DataQue
 Software, or GEnie telecommunication service cannot be held responsible
 for the installation of this upgrade or any incidental or consequential
 damage to any equipment or persons using this upgrade or any variation
 of it.  In other words.... you are on your own.
 
 This is upgrade version #1.  It will only provide stereo output for
 software written specifically for this upgrade.  It will not produce
 stereo output for existing software.  Also, the keyclick will NOT be
 fed into the stereo outputs, as it does not originate from POKEY.
 
   A) Parts Needed:
 
    1) Second Atari POKEY Audio Chip
       a) BEST                    CO12294         $5.00
       b) B&C ComputerVisions     C2294           $3.50
    2) 74LS14/74HCT14 Inverter
       a) BEST       (74LS14)     CO16541         $0.30
       b) Jameco     (74HCT14)    74HCT14         $0.29
    3) 1000 Ohm, 1/4 Watt Metal Film 2-5% Tolerance

       b) Radio Shack (2 lot)     Dont know P# or $
    4) Two RCA style phono jacks
       a) Radio Shack, Jameco or other electronics outlet
       b) 
    5) Two 0.01 (or close) 16V (or more) bypass capacitors.
       Jameco                     DC.01           $0.10 each
    6) Two short (6-12- each) sections of shielded audio cable.
    7) A standard dual RCA to RCA patch cable.
    8) Optionally two 50k single turn trimmer pots.
       Jameco                     63P50K          $0.89 each
 
  B) Hardware
 
    1) Inverter Information
 
     a) Bend up all pins of the inverter except for pins 7 and 14.
     b) Cut off the narrow part of the pins which were bent up.
     c) Install the inverter over top of the existing 74LS14 (or another
        74LS part if more convenient) on the motherboard.  Make sure that
        the new chip has its locator notch/dot on the same end as the
        chip below it.
     d) Solder pins 7 and 14 of the inverter to the same pins of the
        lower IC.
     e) Run a small wire (wire wrap type works best) from pin-1 of the
        inverter to pin-13 of the CPU.  The CPU is part number CO14806 on
        the XL/XE series.
     f) On the old POKEY there is a 3k pullup resistor connected between
        pin-31 and Vcc.  You will need to unsolder this resistor and
        remove it.
     g) Run a small wire from pin-2 of the inverter to pin-3 of the
        inverter, and then on to POKEY pin-31.  Note, you can use the pad
        where the resistor was just removed.  Be sure to get the correct
        one.
 
    2) POKEY Information
 
     a) Bend up all pins on the new POKEY which are marked with a minus
        on the diagram.  This includes POKEY pins:  8,9,10,11,12,13,14,
        15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, and 29.
     b) Cut off the narrow part of each pin bent up.
     c) Tin each lead which was NOT bent up.  This includes pins 1,2,3,4,
        5,6,7,17,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39 and 40.  These pins are
        marked in the diagram as *,>>, or <<.
     d) Now, bend up the pins indicated by the >> and << symbols.  Do not
        cut these pins short.
     e) Place the new POKEY on top of the old POKEY in a piggy-back
        style.
     f) Solder the unbent pins of the new POKEY to the old POKEY.  If
        your original POKEY was in a socket, then it is easier to connect
        the two if it is removed.  Make sure no excess solder flows down
        the pins to the narrow part of the OLD POKEY.  Reinsert both
        POKEYs into the original socket.
     g) Solder the 1k resistor from pin 37 to Vcc.  The most convenient
        location to pick up Vcc is where the 3k resistor was removed
        earlier.
     h) Solder a wire from pin-31 of the new POKEY to pin-4 of the
        inverter.
     i) Mount the two RCA jacks on the rear of the case, preferably in an
        area close to the POKEYs.
     j) Solder a bypass capacitor to each of the center conductors of the
        RCA jacks.
  *  k) With the trim-pot knob facing you, pin 1 should be to the left
        side.  Solder a wire from this pin on each trimmer, to a ground
        trace on the motherboard.
  *  l) Connect the free end of the bypass capacitor to the center pin of
        the trimmer (one capacitor to each trimmer).
  *  m) Connect the shields of the audio cables to the provided solder
        lugs on each RCA connector, and the center conductor of the free
        terminal of each trimmer.
     n) Connect the center conductor of the free end of the audio cable
        which is connected to the left RCA jack/trimmer/cap to pin-37 of
        the OLD POKEY.
     p) Connect the center conductor of the free end of the audio cable
        which is connected to the right RCA jack/trimmer/cap to pin-37 of
        the NEW POKEY.
     q) The shield of the audio cable on the POKEY end, should be cut and
        taped (or heat shrinked) so that it does not touch anything.
     r) Run a 18-20 AWG wire from the ground lug of the RCA jacks to the
        wide ground area on the motherboard.  This normally makes contact
        with the shield box that covers the motherboard.
     s) You will now be able to connect the two RCA cables to an AUX (or
        Tape) level input of a stereo or boom box.
  *  t) I would suggest centering the trimmers in their travel, and
        adjusting them as needed to get the best clarity.  You may want
        to glue the trimmers to the back of the cabinet to keep them from
        moving around.
 
 * NOTE: On my system the POKEY outputs worked fine without the
 trimmers.  So I just connected the bypass capacitor on each RCA jack to
 the apropriate audio cable center conductor.  This was driving an AUX
 350mV input of a Pioneer SPEC-1 preamplifier.

   C) POKEY Registers:
 
 I will only elaborate on registers used to produce sound in the stereo
 upgrade.  All registers which were in the original POKEY will appear in
 the second POKEY 16 bytes higher in memory.  The extra UART, key
 scanner, and pot scanner could be used for all kinds of neat projects.
 
    Location   Name   R/W  Function

      $D210    AUDF5    W   Audio Channel #5 Frequency  (Divide F/n)
      $D211    AUDC5    W   Audio Channel #5 Control    (Vol/Distort)
      $D212    AUDF6    W   Audio Channel #6 Frequency  (Divide F/n)
      $D213    AUDC6    W   Audio Channel #6 Control    (Vol/Distort)
      $D214    AUDF7    W   Audio Channel #7 Frequency  (Divide F/n)
      $D215    AUDC7    W   Audio Channel #7 Control    (Vol/Distort)
      $D216    AUDF8    W   Audio Channel #8 Frequency  (Divide F/n)
      $D217    AUDC8    W   Audio Channel #8 Control    (Vol/Distort)
      $D218    AUDCT2   W   Audio control for channels 5-8
      $D21F    SKCTL2   W   Serial Port Control
 
 
 Each Audio Channel Frequency Register is an 8-bit value which is a
 divisor of the primary frequency.
 
 Each Audio Channel Control Register Controls the Volume and Distortion
 of each channel.  The bits are assigned as follows:
 
        76543210
        ----vvvv   Volume control bits.  Range controls vol. as follows:
            0000   lowest volume level
             \/   
            1111  highest volume level
 
         ---s----   Volume only bit.  Directly controls audio output:

                      0  Speaker output is off
                      1  Speaker output is on
 
         ddd-----   Distortion code.  Code is assigned as follows:
                    000  5-bit/17-bit poly noise
                    001  5-bit poly noise
                    010  5-bit/4-bit poly noise
                    011  5-bit poly noise
                    100  17-bit poly noise
                    101  pure tone
                    110  4-bit poly noise
                    111  pure tone
 
 The AUDCTn register controls all channels.  There are several functions
 assigned to this register as follows:
 
         bit-7   Makes 17-bit poly into 9-bit poly counter
         bit-6   Clock Channel-1 with 1.79 MHz (CPU rate)
         bit-5   Clock Channel-3 with 1.79 MHz (CPU rate)
         Bit-4   Join channel 1 and 2 to form 16-bit range
         Bit-3   Join channel 3 and 4 to form 16-bit range
         Bit-2   Insert filter in channel-1, clocked by channel-2
         Bit-1   Insert filter in channel-2, clocked by channel-4
         Bit-0   Switch clock base from 64kHz to 15kHz
 
 The SKCTLn register controls various functions of the POKEY device, and
 only has to be initialized to a value of three to assure all four
 channels of POKEY are active.
 
 Note:  To detect if the upgrade is installed, look at the 8 extra pots,
 they will be all zero.  Also the key code register will be also zero.
 If you compare the keycode at $D209 with that of $D219, and $D219 is
 zero, the upgrade is installed.  You may want to mask IRQ's during the
 test for safety.
 
 Let me know what wild things you all come up with for this upgrade...
 and in a few days I will try to have the version 2 upgrade, if it is
 possible.  thanks,   Chuck
