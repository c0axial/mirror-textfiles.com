<*> ANALOG Computing Editorial
##############################
February 1989
by Clayton Walnum

Reprinted by permission.

It's now been over seven years since the first copy of ANALOG Computing
hit the stands. Over that period of time, Atari has had its ups and downs,
and through it all, ANALOG has been there to provide its readers with the
information they needed to get the most from their computers.  But after
seven years of publishing, it gets very tough to come up with new topics
for discussion.  Even though the Atari 8-bit computers have had a couple
of face-lifts over the years, they are still essentially the same machines
they were when they were first released. There is simply nothing new that
can be said about them. (We would be delighted if someone out there could
send us an article to prove us wrong. That's a challenge!)

It occurred to me that there are a great number of new ANALOG Computing
readers--readers who are experiencing Atari computers for the first time.
And these new readers have a need for much of the information we Atari
veterans consider -old hat.- After all, it has been years since such
topics as player/missile graphics, display lists, page flipping and
modified character sets have been covered at a level that the novice
programmer could understand. Should we, perhaps, cover these topics again?
Write to us and let us know!

I've always envisioned ANALOG's growth as a long line that projected from
the past into the future. But with recent developments (or should I say
_lack_ of developments) it appears to me that maybe ANALOG should start
coming full circle, should start providing some of the information that
new owners have missed.

One thing that people are constantly asking for is reprints of the early
Boot Camp columns. This assembly language tutorial started way back in
Issue 13, and is without a doubt the finest series of tutorials of its
type ever written. (I can say that without boasting because back then I
was an ANALOG Computing reader just like you, not involved editorially at
all. Boot Camp was one of ANALOG's features that I most looked forward to
each month.)  With this issue, Karl Wiegers, our current Boot Camp author,
is retiring his position. And since most every assembly language topic has
been covered anyway, we have to make a decision.  Do we drop Boot Camp
from our table of contents? Or do we try to replace it?

My suggestion to the publisher was that we dig all the way back to Issue
13 and start reprinting the column.  First of all, most of those early
issues are out of print, so the initial Boot Camp columns are completely
unavailable to our readers.  Second, there is no one I know who can cover
the topic better than Tom Hudson, so I don't see any point in having
someone rewrite what has already been covered splendidly.

The bottom line is that it's up to you, the readers. Drop us a line and
let us know if you'd like to see the early Boot Camp articles reprinted.
Drop us a line if you _don't_ want to see them reprinted.  We'll tally the
votes and come to a decision based on what you want.

And speaking of making decisions, please take a look at the short survey
we've included in this issue. We hope that most of you will take the time
to check off your responses and mail it in. If ANALOG is to continue to
grow, we have to know what you want.

Category 15,  Topic 2  Message 1         Sat Feb 11, 1989
MARTY.A [RT*SysOp]           (Forwarded) 
 
At a recent meeting of the Sacramento ACCESS <Atari Computer Club
Encompassing Suburban Sacramento> club, I asked Sig Hartmann of Atari
Corp. about the lack of support that Atari provides to the -little-
programmers of the Atari 8-bits.

What I meant by this is the almost impossible to find tech info on the 8-
bit hardware/firmware, and the lack of response by Atari to questions
asked about many things relating to the 8-bits.  Also brought up was the
absence of an 8-bit -developer's kit- for 8-bit owners.  <Atari has an XE
developer's kit for the ST that amounts to a 6502 cross compiler, but if
you don't have an ST, it is of no use>

Sig's response to this was VERY favorable!

What he asked was that we try to get a concensus of just what we would
need to do a better job of getting our programs written and out to the
users.  Sig then asked that when we get that together, that we send that
to him and he will see what can be done about it.

Now, I'm willing to take the initiative to gather, organize, and transmit
the information to Sig, but *YOU* have to tell me what is needed.

So, this is your chance, folks! If need be, I'll set up a special CATegory
for the discussions.  Let me know here if you think that is needed.
Otherwise, let's see some ideas on just WHAT Atari Corp. could do to help
you program.

<*>  KEYS TO YOUR ATARI
##############################
by Mike Lechkun, MAGIC (MI)

One of the least thought of -options- on your Atari computer is the
keyboard.  If you have the occasion to work with a PC/compatible, you're
aware that the keyboard that comes with the machine isn't necessarily the
one you're stuck with. In the IBM world you have your choice of 84 or 101
keys, depending on if you have PC-XT, PC-AT, or PS/2 (alphabet soup
anyone?). Unfortunately, with the Atari, your options aren't very many.

In fact, if you own an ST or MEGA, your options are one: the keyboard in
the box.  By the time you read this, there may be more, and if there is,
we at ZMag would like to hear of it.  My own opinions are that it is a
reasonable keyboard.

The tactile response (the long way of saying -feel-) in my opinion is OK-
to-good.  If I had to type for a living, I would not be happy with it. But
for occasional banging, it's allright.

With the 8-bit world, there is somewhat more of a choice.  The hands-down
loser in my book is the 130 XE.  That's assuming we're talking real
keyboards and not the flat panel of the old Atari 400.  The 400 did have
it's advantages: for a while, it was cheaper than the 800.  It was also
water-proof.  That was it, until third party manufacturers came out with
alternative keyboards. But the cost of these keyboards brought the price
of the 400 up to the 800's level.

Now, in 1989, they're a good deal IF you can find one for your 400.

The best of the lot was the good ol' Atari 800.  You could type to your
hearts content.  The response was great, and your fingers knew when they
made a mistake--that is what I look for in a keyboard.  The System Reset
key was guarded against accidental pushing by two guide panels above and
below the key.

The only thing missing was the -help- key, which was thoughtfully added
too late to be of any use.  Had that key been on the 800, software
manufacturers would have written their works accordingly.  But to keep
compatibility amongst (then) all Atari computers, it was rarely used.  As
a side note, I understand that Atari has -officially- dropped support for
the 400 and 800 series--sad to see, in a nostalgic sense.  The XL/XE
series are, for the most part, the same machine and will last for many
years.

After the 400/800's reign, Warner-Atari introduced their Edsel, the 1200
XL. This keyboard wasn't as good as its parents, but still was good in its
own right.  More keys were added in the -function key- row: the
aforementioned help key, as well as F1 through F4 (LED's L1 and L2 were
also added, but more on those in another gripping expose).  The -function
key- row was also moved from the right hand side to the top, one row above
the number keys.  Again, a good idea, if not for the incompatible OS the
machine had to endure.

Back to the drawing board went Atari, and this time they got it right. The
600XL (16K memory) and 800 XL (64K memory, plus other differences) emerged
with keyboards close (if not the same) as the 1200 XL.  The -function key-
row, however, was moved back to the right of the keyboard, and reduced in
numbers to 5 (Sys Reset, Option, Select, Start, and Help).  During this
model run, there were a number of different suppliers that made keyboards.

In the 800 XL I own, the keys seem to get -sticky- at times; fortunately,
that is the BBS computer which I don't type much on--it is annoying,
though.  One of the major computer resellers advertises their stock of
800 XL's as containing keyboards that are -good, better and best-.  Judge
for yourself.

Three 8-bit machines are now in current production: the (64K) 65 XE, the
(128K) 130 XE, and the (64K) XE Game System.  The keyboard on the XEGS is
detachable from the main system.  You can sit back in your easy chair and
type away with the keyboard in your lap...until you have to use a function
key.  Except for the help key, the other 4 are on the main system box. But
you can't miss 'em, as they are 1- round pastel colored mounds.  Easy to
hit, but easy to mistake for if all you're typing by is the light of the
silvery moon and your TV monitor. Make sure that you know which one is the
Reset key, and more importantly the on-off key (also a mound, but with a
red LED so as not to be mistaken).

As for the keyboards on the XE series: they are a -Nightmare on Borregas
Avenue-.  Their toy-like construction leaves a lot to be desired, and
minimal wear can cause failure of certain keys.  These are not keyboards
you can -bang away- on.  The response and feel stinks, and I'm frequently
pressing two keys and adding extra characters when I know I've hit the key
square on the head.

What are the alternatives?  As far as third party manufacturers go, there
are none for the XL/XE/XEGS series.  There are some interesting oddities
out there.

Predating the 400/800 computers, the venerable 2600 VCS once had plans for
a keyboard add-on, and by more than one party.  Atari's -My First
Computer- (later reintroduced as -The Graduate-) option was canned when
they realized that it could have cut in to computer sales.  Spectravideo
(anyone remember the -SX- standard?) and another company also had VCS add
ons that never made it to market (by the way, if you've still have your
VCS, and have seen the cartridge called -Basic Programming- avoid it like
the plague!).

The Atari 400 had two alternative keyboards, one that was hard wired in,
and a mechanical one that had little hammers that pressed down through to
the keys.

At this point, ANYTHING was better.  For both the 400/800, there was a
keyboard/keypad setup marketed by RCE in Grants Pass, OR.  The Commander
2400 allowed use of computer and auxilliary keyboards simultaneously, and
appeared to be a quality product.

Currently, the Atari issue CX-85 is still out there in numbers.  This unit
is a 16 key adding machine style keypad, and was to be a great aid to
spreadsheet users and budget fixers.  But the unit required the loading of
a special handler program which conflicted in memory with just about every
program written.

Innovative Concepts, out of Warren, Mich., have reworked the unit creating
a keypad that works with EVERY 8-bit Atari program.  They have also re-
added the function keys F1 through F4 (which were sort of like the human
appendix--always there, but never accessed) as an option to their ICX-85.

There you have it.  When composing that term paper or programming the next
great video game, keep in mind these alternatives.

<*> SURVEY RESPONSE     Part 1
##############################
Compiled by Ron Kovacs

To date, I have received 300 responses to the survey printed in ZMAGAZINE 
and ST*ZMAGAZINE.  The survey was also uploaded seperately to the services.

The best possible way for us to report our findings is to list the
original questions and supply you with a summary of the responses.  Some 
of the questions asked for commentary, while many others were simple 
multiple choice.

Questions that have been omitted will be published as soon as they have 
been compiled.  Look for those in a few weeks.  Please keep one point in 
mind while reviewing the responses, we released the survey and more of the 
choices selected are biased to our magazines.

ST-REPORT was included in the first edition of the survey, since all of 
the responses were included, I have allowed those results to appear.

THE SURVEY
==========
1).  Sex:      Male: 260      Female: 40
2).  How many people in household?     Average was 4-5
3).  What is your age?
     Lowest age reported was 11 years old.
     Highest reported age as 69 years old.
     Most responses ranged between 28-37 years old.

4).  What City/State do you live in?
     Surprisingly 60% of the responses came from the midwest, states like 
     Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana. 10 responses came from overseas in 
     areas like England, Germany, Italy, and Ireland. 5 responses were 
     from South of the border, Panama, Mexico, and Costa Rica.

5).  Are you employed?
     98% responded they were employed and the prinicipal wage earner.
==========
1).  Type of computer you presently use most at home
     Atari 800.............7
     Atari XL/XE..........70
     Atari 520/1040......102
     Atari Mega...........21

1a). Type of computer used at work:
     Only 65 responses to this question.  The responses ranged from an 
     Altos system to the not surprising IBMPC or Tandy system.

2).  Number of computers you presently own:
     Most responses stated they owned 2 or more computers. Some detailed 
     them to all 8 bit systems, mixed with an ST or mixed with an IBM.  
     Responses mixed with an IBM were almost 50%.

3).  Which computer did you purchase first?
     The first computer purchased by 30% was the Atari 800.
     From another 30% is was the Atari 800XL.
     From 25% is was an IBM or Radio computer.
     From 15% is was an ST as the first computer.

3a). Which computer do you presently use most:
     More 8-bit owners answered this question then ST owners.  65% use the
     Atari 800XL or 130XE as the mostly used system, the rest use the ST.
     3 responses said they used the IBM more then an Atari.

8).  Have you ever purchased a 2600 game system?
     60% of the responses DID purchase a system, the other 40% DID NOT.

9).  Have you ever purchased a 5200 game system?
     116 people responded to this question, 31 of them DID purchase it.

11). Have you ever purchased any other game system?
     Same as above, except the responses stated yes and listed Nintendo or
     Sega as an alternate system. 19 people listed Nintendo, 4 people 
     listed Sega.

12). How many game system cartridges do you own:
     Of the 60% answering the 2600 question, these readers has 15 or more
     cartridges.  A few listed 45 or more.

13). How many cartridges for the 800/XL/XE computer do you own:
     Everyone who owned an 8 bit answered this question.  The smallest 
     amount entered was 2 and largest was 11.

=======
1).  How long have you been an 8 bit user?
     This question was answered in a number of ways.  Some readers entered
     a specific tiem frame like (1978-1982).  Other simply stated years.
     Most responses were 4 or more years, 20% were 8-bit owners for more
     than 7 years.

2).  How long have you been a 16 bit user?
     Most responses were 2-3 years.  Seems like a normal response, since
     the ST isn't as old as the 800.  A few responses were 1-2 years.

3).  If you are presently an 8 bit owner, Do you plan to purchase an ST or
     other 16 bit computer?  Please explain below.
     This question was NOT answered by more then half of the 8 bit 
     responses. Some stated they were interested, but felt the price 
     wasn't worth starting over again.  Others stated they were more then
     pleased with the preformance of the 8-bit and would NOT purchase an
     ST.

4).  If you are presently an 8 bit owner as well as a 16 bit owner, do you 
     still use your 8 bit computer? 
     If the reader was an ST user and had the 8-bit, it was either being 
     readied for sale, or sitting in a closet collecting dust. 98% of the 
     ST people are NOT using the 8-bit any longer.

6).  For ST owners:  How do you presently feel about the 8 bit Atari?
     The response was typical across the board.  -Great for it's time,
     no support any longer, sell it while you can, poorly marketed,
     now dead, has a future if Atari wakes up, it's last breath is close
     this year-, and - What is an 8-bit Atari?-.

7).  For 8 Bit owners:  How do you feel about the ST computer?
     Here the reponses were different.  Very few typical responses. Some
     stated, -Wish I could justify purchasing it, very impressive, great
     for it's time, poor marketed, will have the same life span of the
     8-bit if Atari doesn't wake up, waste of my money, and no support so
     no purchase from me.

    ST owners responded will similiar answers, many were positive however
    like, -Would like more slots for add-on boards, I want more support
    from third party developers, Want to upgrade to a Mega, it's fast,
    can't beleive I waited so long to buy it!- and -Being able to run MAC
    and IBM software is a great plus.-

9).  Do you feel Atari Corp has provided you the proper support?
     Every answer was the same, -NO-.

12). What do you think we as users can do to convince the developers to 
     support our computer system.  Be it 8 bit or 16 bit.

     This question brought a number of responses, here are a few of them:

     * Stop pirating on BBS systems, report them!
     * We can't do anything
     * Why should we do it, Why not Atari?
     * Developers should get more involved in the User Groups and see
       what we have to say.
     * Developers should listen to the needs of the users and write 
       software we want to see.
     * Give us something to support!
     * Show these people we aren't pirates!
     * ZMag should regularly survey about a specific product and report
       the findings to that developer!
     * Stop reporting everything as a crisis and show them we are in full
       support of the product

=========
1)  What is your present opinion of Atari Corporation.
    (Please write your comments in the space provided)

    Responses were similiar and very direct.  Of course, some people
    didn't want to answer this and the next few questions.  Since the
    answers asked for commentary, we can reproduce the bottom line opinion
    which is:

    -A good company, but it needs better structure and a better advertising
    campaign.  Keep your promises and don't report anything unless you
    intend to produce it.-  Others stated, -Be on the services more and
    make us feel we purchased a computer that will be supported and 
    improved.-
