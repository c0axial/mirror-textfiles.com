About Z*Magazine - the 8-bit Atari Online Resource


Z*Magazine is the ORIGINAL Atari-related online magazine from which most
others have descended, including STZ-Magazine, STReport, Z*Net, and Atari
Explorer Online.

This board holds ALL issues of Z*Magazine available.  While there is
some information in Z*Mag on all Atari products, the focus is predominately
on the 8-bit 400/800/XL/XE line of Atari computers.

The Atari SIG thanks the following people for contributing the bulk of the
issues found here:

  Frank Seipel, an533
  Joe Sabatino, ap105
  Kit Kimes, <a href="mailto:kimes@iwcs.att.com?subject=Re:%20About%20Z*Magazine">kimes@iwcs.att.com</a>
  Jeff Potter, <a href="mailto:potter@sunny0.dab.ge.com?subject=Re:%20About%20Z*Magazine">potter@sunny0.dab.ge.com</a>

If you appreciate this source of Z*Mags, consider sending notes of
thanks to these people!

It took nearly two years for your Atari SIGOps to collect all the Z*Mags
found here.  We believe the immense amount of information contained
herein is an important information resource not only for 8-bit Atari 
computer users, but for all Atari users.
