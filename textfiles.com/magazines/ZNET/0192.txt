 ATARIUSER MAGAZINE DEBUTS - UPDATE
 ==================================
 by John Nagy
 
 ATARIUSER MAGAZINE will be the Guest in the Real-Time-Conference on
 GEnie this coming Wednesday night, May 1, at 10 PM, 7 PM Pacific time.
 AtariUser is the new FREE Atari monthly magazine, formerly ST JOURNAL.
 John Nagy, John King Tarpinian, and Steve Lesh will be on hand to
 discuss the new all-Atari magazine.  Attendees will get an extra free
 offer... be there.

 The crew of AtariUser will be attending the conference from the CODEHEAD
 QUARTERS BBS, at the birthday party for the first year of operation of
 the BBS.  Ron Berinstein, host of the CodeHead Quarters system and PD/
 Shareware reviewer for Z*NET and AtariUser, also manages the Vine Street
 Bar and Grill in Hollywood, California, and the conference will end in
 an appreciation party for all the system users.  As the name implies,
 CodeHead Quarters BBS is the home base for support of John Eidsvoog and
 Charles F. Johnson's CODEHEAD SOFTWARE.

 Here is the Editor's Viewpoint column from the May issue of AtariUser
 magazine, now on newsstands, dealer shelves, and user group meeting
 tables.  (Reprinted by permission, Copyright 1991 by Quill Publishing,

 HIGH RESOLUTION:  Viewpoints and Responses from our Atari Community

 Welcome to ATARIUSER MAGAZINE      by John Nagy, Editor In Chief
 
 You are holding a rare commodity in today's world: an Atari specific
 monthly magazine.  In fact, ATARIUSER may be the U.S.'s ONLY monthly
 commercial Atari magazine-format publication.  That's both an exciting
 opportunity and a heavy commitment.

 We USED to be ST JOURNAL, a widely praised but relatively low-production
 ST specific glossy magazine.  Despite ST JOURNAL's popularity (where it
 could be found), we could not afford to print more than 10,000 copies
 with the ad revenues we were earning... and couldn't raise more revenues
 without increasing circulation.  Even while our acceptance and quality
 increased with each issue, the numbers just weren't going to work.

 Enter ATARIUSER MAGAZINE.  Steve Lesh of Quill Publications and I had
 been kicking around the concept of doing a dealer-distributed free
 computer magazine for quite a while.  There are several non-specific
 computer regional magazines that have done well in the -free- format,
 particularly on the West coast.  We decided to risk trying to do the
 first national (international, really) -free- distribution magazine.  By
 a series of trade-offs of production numbers against printing and
 binding methods, ad rates, and distribution schemes, we think it is
 going to work.  We even figure to be able to clinch the title for
 largest circulation Atari magazine in the USA... and provide a FREE
 product.  Every month!  I agreed to become the editor and Steve will
 provide his outstanding layout and art direction.  Also from ST JOURNAL
 are Kevin Horn heading up advertising, Gantry Gappmayer, John King
 Tarpinian as Assistant Editor, and a number of contributors from the old
 JOURNAL staff.
 
 You may have noticed the $1 -Bookstore Price- on the cover... and some
 of you may have had to pay it.  Sorry, but some major bookstores and
 businesses simply can't and won't cope with a totally free magazine.
 Rather than have to give up the substantial potential circulation, we
 allow them to charge meagerly, if they must.  This is not an uncommon
 solution for other, similar -free- publications... but see -Getting
 AtariUser, below!
 
 AtariUser will cover the ENTIRE Atari computer product lineup, including
 the TT, STe, ST, MEGA, MEGA/STe, Portfolio, Lynx, and even the out-of-
 production Atari 8-bit series of computers.  And as Atari's product 
 family grows in the coming months, so will we.  We'll focus on the facts
 that will make life easier for ATARI USERS.  Every month we will try to
 cut to the meat of what is happening, what is available, what it can do
 for you, and how to get it.  And we'll do it FAST, with less than two
 weeks between final edits and distribution.

 We are maintaining close alliances with other magazines and news
 agencies to be sure our information is as current as possible.   We'll
 exchange material with Z*NET INTERNATIONAL ATARI NEWS SERVICE, Germany's
 PD JOURNAL, and several other foreign magazines.

 Our departments will regularly include all Atari product lines, plus
 rotating focuses on DTP, communications, graphics, MIDI applications,
 new software and game reviews, top PD and SHAREWARE software, user group
 news, emulation, hardware hacking, etc.  And I'll be keeping you current
 with ATARI NEWS AND COMMENT, continuing the column I've done for years
 in COMPUTER SHOPPER magazine.

 You'll find two specific constructs recurring throughout our pages:

 * the ALERT BOX
 This will be at the top of each department's column with quick news and
 facts about the subject in general.  You'll be able to keep up with
 developments in each department with a glance.
 
 * the RESOURCES
 Each month we'll feature a RESOURCE FILE for one or more of our
 departments, giving a comprehensive listing of available products,
 dealers, user groups, BBS's, etc.

 We're continuing the advertiser and product indexes that were popular in
 ST JOURNAL.  We'll even do something unheard of since Kris Kringle
 suggested MACY's in MIRACLE ON 34th STREET...recommend you to the OTHER
 Atari publications, let you know what each of them feature in their
 current issue, and how to subscribe!

 We want to make it easier to be an ATARI USER.  Our concept and goal is
 to be your standard monthly reference for all Atari interests... at a
 price Atari Users can truly say is POWER WITHOUT THE PRICE... FREE!  Let
 us know how you think we're doing!

 John Nagy, Editor in Chief, AtariUser Magazine

 UPGRADES AND OTHER TID-BITS
 ---------------------------
 by Eugene R. Case
 
 Please NOTE: This text may be copied for distribution, as long as the
 Authors name, and Text have not been altered.  This is (C)1991 ERC
 Products for the Public Domain.
 
 Well this is my first attempt at writing for Z*Mag/a\zine.  I have a few
 things to offer first, and that is, thanks for the Online Mag/a\zine,
 and the continued support for the XL/XE computers.
 
 I am currently waiting patiently for the Newest Version of BobTerm XE,
 or 1.22 as it is dubbed.  This version may only work on XE's, and
 upgraded XL's.  128K+ will be required to use the full functions of this
 program.  Also in the wings, as most of you know, is TextPro 5.0, and
 all source codes will be included for those that program, who want to
 make it do more that the Initial Release version.  This text, however,
 is being written with TextPro 4.54, and the Atari 800XL with the RamboXL
 (C)ICD, Inc. installed.
 
 Speaking of upgrades, there is a company in Texas, Newell Industries.  I
 am sure most of you have heard of them, and may have even purchased
 their 256K upgrade, instead of ICD's.  Well in the newest, or most
 current, Atari Explorer, they have an ad for thier products now
 available.  In it, is the 256K upgrade, and also a 1MB (One Mega Byte)
 upgrade, that even supports 4MB.  As you all ask, -What am I going to do
 with 1MB of RAM in my Atari?-.  Well there are many applications that
 access the Ram area of your computer before it can actually run itself.
 If your computer doesn't have the RAM available, then it may not even
 boot up.  Another upgrade is from Data-Q Software.  The Turbo-816, if
 this and the Newell 1MB upgrade are in your computer at the same time,
 well you'll need to upgrade the casing too.  It just won't fit.  The 1MB
 upgrade requires you to cut away, or remove the RF Shield, and then the
 T816 is another OS alltogether.  I have a friend that has the 1MB
 upgrade in his XL, and it takes up some space.  It's larger than the
 RamboXL, and needs more connections.  I personally like this, as it
 allows the computer to be -Shut OFF-, and then turned right back on,
 with NO Bootup problems, just like your 64K computer did.  Then there's
 a BASIC Switch to install, and this allows you to have BASIC on or off,
 your choice.  So, as I said, the 1MB is a great tool, and will put you
 up there with the BIG Boys.
 
 Now, there's also a Memory Management problem.  The ORIGINAL OS that
 Atari has installed in your XL/XE just won't handle this 1MB very well,
 it has to access -Banks- of memory.  Now for the good news, you probably
 know about an OS from Synergy Concepts.  It's no longer available as I
 can see.  It was at one time, from Best Electronics, in California, but
 I haven't seen one, nor do I know what it does.  Then the Newell
 Industries RAMROD XL OS that allows you to have Fastchip Floating point
 routines, and is compatible with the 400/800 OS.
 
 For more Information Write:
    Newell Industries
    P.O. Box 253
    Wylie, TX 75098
    (214)-442-6612
 
 Now for the next OS, there's the CSS (Computer Software Services)
 upgrade called -Ultra Speed Plus-, and this will manage 2MB of RAM
 easily.  Also has that ability to use 400/800/800XL/130XE OS too.  Yes
 CSS are the ones that have the -Super Archiver II- for the 1050 drive.
 Anyway, the US+ is in my opinion a good OS to have too.  It is however,
 the only one that says you can FORMAT your RAM-DISK in True 256 Byte Per
 Sectors, Double Density.
 
 Call CSS for more Information at:
   (716)-586-5545 9 to 5 EST.

 The last here, is the Turbo-816, from Data-Q Software.  There are MANY
 things needed for this OS.  It will manage 16MB of RAM, and it's Linear
 Decodeing of the RAM select, is best, better than ANY of the other OS's.
 There is even Software out that supports it, and a NON Modified Computer
 too.  I would suggest that you get intouch with Chuck Steinman, of
 DataQue, and discuss it with him.  It would do me no good, other than to
 -REVIEW- it, to let you decide what you want to do with your XL/XE
 computer.
 
 The Address is:
  DataQue Software
  Post Office Box 134
  Ontario, OH 44862

 Well that's about all for this time, so have fun with all this information, 
 and Remember to Support Your Atari.  Buy products, and upgrades, maybe Atari 
 will look at this, and start supporting it.  Who Knows?

 PORTABLE ADDICTION MAGAZINE
 ===========================
 by Tjerk Heymans Visser and Yiri Kohl
 
 Issue #00 April
 The newsletter for the Atari Lynx and the Atari Portfolio
 
 Welcome to this very first issue of Portable Addiction.  This issue is
 just a test issue, so if you find this newsletter interesting, please
 send us a message.
 
 This is a monthly newsletter for both Portfolio and Lynx users.  We will
 try to cover all the new software that is being released for both
 machines, but we are also planning to do tips, previews, news and a
 letter page.  To test all newly released software for the Lynx, we have
 made a nice little deal with the local Fun Tronics store.  They are now
 officially supporting us.  On the Portfolio front we have a PC expert.
 He calls most BBS' every day, so if new Portfolio software is released,
 you'll be the first one to know.
 
   Y.T.Kohl -  Editorial assistant
 
 ALL THE LATEST NEWS...(AND GOSSIP)
 ----------------------------------
 The NEC TurboExpress will not be released in Europe.  This is done
 because the Lynx is far more popular over here, and because the PC
 Engine never made it to Europe!  This means that here, in Europe, NEC is
 out of the race and the Lynx has won again!!! Hurrah!!!!
 
 More and more shop's are selling the Lynx in Holland, the shop's that
 are selling the Game Boy are now selling the Lynx along with it.  It
 will not be long untill the Lynx will have won definately (The price has
 already dropped from HLF 500 to HLF 300, the Lynx II will be HLF 200)
 
 A Portfolio II is in production.  The only thing we know about it is
 that it will be an improved version of the old model.  More info when we
 have it.
 
 Release dates for the Lynx II have yet to be set(for Europe), but we
 expect to see it in England this Christmas, and early 1992 in the rest
 of Europe.  In the US it has already been released, at $99,-.

 Here follows a list of the Lynx games currently available.  If a game is
 not yet for sale at your local dealer, you know that the game is on it's
 way.  Here comes:

           California Games                    Rampage
           Chip's Challenge                    Klax
           Zarlor Mercenary                    Gates of Zendocon
           Xenophobe                           Electrocop
           Gauntlet III                        Blue Lightning
           Slime World                         Paperboy
           Road Blasters                       Ms.Pacman
           Rygar                               Shanghai
           RoboSquash

 RoboSquash - LYNX Review - OUT NOW
 ----------------------------------
 Remember PONG?  No?  Well, think back, about ten years back.  Pong, a
 game where you slide your bat to the left and to the right to catch a
 ball, which then bounces away the blocks above.
 
 RoboSquash is exactly the same, except for some gameplay enhancements,
 and the addition of an extra demention.  In other words, RoboSquash is
 3-D Pong with power-ups.  You can play against the computer, or
 challenge a friend.  The latter is the only thing that makes RoboSquash
 reach the AVERAGE accolade.  And this is indeed a very average game,
 almost below average.  PONG was great when it was released.... in the
 beginning of the '80s!  But please, leave these games in the decade
 where they were born!  Get real!  It's 1991 and an improved version of
 Pong is just not enough to keep today's gameplayers happy!
 
   Graphics    _6  : Simple but functional
   Sound       _3  : Sound hasn't improved much since Pong!!!
   Playability _7  : Quite playable at first
   Lastability _4  : After a few goes inerest starts to wane
   Overall     _5  : A pathetic attempt at resurrecting an ancient game
 
 Blue Lightning - LYNX review - OUT FOR A LONG TIME
 --------------------------------------------------
 Blue Lightning is out since the beginning of the Lynx, it's a good
 flight-simulator and demonstrates the great scaling features of the
 Lynx.  The game play is good (very fast play), but it does not really
 stand out from the other flight simulators.  There are nine missions,
 each with a different goal like attacking radar bases, nightflights and
 dogflights.  There is no music, but who wants to hear music, you're
 supposed to be flying an airplane, the only sound you hear are those of
 the plane and your gun.
 
 Overall it's quite nice (graphics are stunning), but it's adviced to buy
 it at a reduced price, unless you really want it.
 
   Graphics    _8  : Beautyfull, detailled and fast
   Sound       _6  : No music but it does not bore
   Playability _7  : Game play is very good/fast
   Lastability _7  : Missions are just right (not to easy and not so hard
                     so you give up
   Overall     _7  : Great, one of the nicest simulators I've ever seen

 GAMING TIPS
 -----------
 Chip's Challenge 
 The code for level 144 is GVXQ. also worth a try if you are a maths
 freak, is the code MAND.  This will enter the hidden Mandelbrot
 explorer.  A tip on using it: all buttons have a function!

 Xenophobe
 The Poofer gun is the most powerful.  It may have a very short range,
 but if you want to survive till the very last level, give it a try!
 
 Zarlor Mercenary - a players guide:
 At the start of the first level you'll find a laser, an auto fire and
 speed.  To destroy the most aliens you must put the palm of your hand on
 the lowest A-button and press the B-button with your thumb, so you shoot
 your cannons and laser at the same time (autofire is needed).
 
 End of level guardians:
 The first and second guardians are easy, just keep moving to avoid the
 bullets (and lasers on, level 2) and don't stop shooting.  On level 3
 there are 3 end of level guardians, just keep flying above the center,
 so you can't be hit by the lasers, you'll be hit by all the mines and
 bullets but if you use mega bombs you'll make it through.  On level 4
 you must shoot all the balls first (watch out, when they explode they
 will shoot one bomb at you) after you've done that you must shoot the
 big ball in the center, there will be about ten ships coming out of it
 (mega-bomb is adviced).  Level 5 is not special, just shoot it and watch
 out for the alien ships that fly around.  Use all your megabombs on the
 last end of level monster, when it still lives use your laser, so you
 can hit it any time you like.

 Shopping:
 Buy whatever you need, if you have money left, use it to buy extra
 things on the first 3 levels.  Sell every thing you don't need after
 level 5, that's where you make the most profit.

 My high-score is 3,56 million Zarbits (Supreme Mercenary).
 
 PORTFOLIO
 ---------
 This month only a small section, but we will have large reviews next month.

 A hot item to look out for is the harddisk for the portfolio.  This 20
 MB harddisk is about 1cm high and easily clicks under the portfolio
 itself.  This makes the portfolio about 2cm high, but it doesn't make it
 any bigger.  The only problem with this item is the fact that it runs on
 batteries.  The harddisk does make the storage capacity of the portfolio
 quite large, and therefore makes it more like a PC.
 
 If you just love small machinery, you'll love this harddisk, but we doubt it 
 very much if normal people will really find this thing worth the bucks.

 Here's some hot news for programming freaks!!!  A basic has just been
 released for the portfolio.  PBasic, as it's called, is saved in
 compressed, downloadable form on CIS and GEnie, in a file called
 PBas1.zip.  You'll need the archiving tool called zip to unzip the file
 first.  To order PBasic 3.0 on RAM card (if you don't have access to a
 PC), send a RAM card of 64K or bigger size, and a self-addressed stamped
 mailer for return posting to the following address:

                 BJ Gleason
                 The American University
                 CSIS
                 4400 Massachusetts Ave. N.W.
                 Washington D.C.  20016

 We'll have a full review on it next month.  All I'll tell you now is that 
 PBasic is compatible with Quickbasic, so that means that you can now program 
 while on the run!!!  Mega great!!!  There are also some extra portfolio-only 
 commands!!  Just wait one month and you'll hear all about it!!

 P.S. There is also a Basic in production made by Atari self (this will
 not be a public domain basic!).

 Well that's all for this month.  If you have any suggestions or tips for
 improvements in this newsletter, just mail us.
 
         Yiri and Tjerk.

 SENDING MAIL VIA COMPUSERVE TO INTERNET
 =======================================
 Copyright (c)1991, CompuServe
 
 Internet is an electronic mail system connecting governmental
 institutions, military branches, educational institutions, and
 commercial companies.  There is no surcharge to send or receive messages
 through Internet.  Only ASCII (text) messages up to 50,000 characters
 can be sent through this system.
 
 The service agreement for utilizing Internet follows:
 
 The Federal Research Internet Coordinating Committee requires us to make
 users aware of the following terms and conditions prior to sending
 electronic mail via Internet.
 
 1) Not to advertise by means of the Internet.  An example of this type of 
    prohibited traffic is a message offering goods or services for sale.
 
 2) Not to solicit by means of the Internet.  An example of this type of
    prohibited traffic is a message offering a job to a user of Internet.
 
 CompuServe recommends customers follow these guidelines while utilizing
 Internet.

 SENDING MESSAGES FROM COMPUSERVE TO INTERNET USERS
 
 To send a message to an Internet address you must use a special
 addressing format.  The command is:

 Send to (Name or User ID): >INTERNET:  user@organization.domain

 For example:
 Send to (Name or User ID): >INTERNET:<a href="mailto:Jdoe@abc.michigan-state.edu?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%2030-Apr-91%20#193">Jdoe@abc.michigan-state.edu</a>

 Where ->INTERNET:- is required to send your message to the Internet
 system.  -Jdoe- is the valid address for this user on the Internet
 system.  The -@- tells the system that the domain address is following.
 The -abc.michigan-state- is the organization address.  The -.edu- is the
 domain address.
 
 Note:

 - Domain address elements must be separated by periods and the domain
 must be separated from the recipient's address by the -@- character with
 no spaces.
 
 - The ->INTERNET:- is essential.  It alerts the CompuServe system that
 your message is going to a remote mail location.  Remember to include
 the ->- sign.
 
 - You can have a space after the ->INTERNET:- or have no space.

 - The correct valid address used by the member on the Internet system
 is essential.  Without the exact address used by the recipient, the
 message will not be delivered.

 - The amount of time it takes to deliver an Internet message varies from
 a half hour to two days.  This is a function of Internet and CompuServe
 is not responsible for this time frame.
 
 - Internet and non-Internet addresses may be included in the same SEND,
 separated by semi-colons.
 
 - Messages sent to some Networks via Internet require special addressing
 formats.  For example, messages sent to:

 Bitnet addresses - .BITNET must be appended to the Internet address.

 Example:  >INTERNET: <a href="mailto:Harryw@EDUNAB.BITNET?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%2030-Apr-91%20#193">Harryw@EDUNAB.BITNET</a>

 UUNET addresses - Generally, the regular Internet address format can be
 used.  However, occasionally, the more complex form is needed, such as:
 
   >INTERNET: <a href="mailto:user%25organization.domain@UUNET.UU.NET?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%2030-Apr-91%20#193">user%organization.domain@UUNET.UU.NET</a>

  Example:  >INTERNET:<a href="mailto:harry%25edunab.msu@UUNET.UU.NET?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%2030-Apr-91%20#193">harry%edunab.msu@UUNET.UU.NET</a>

 Undeliverable messages
 
 If your message is undeliverable, it usually will be returned to you
 along with the text of your message.  Whether the message is actually
 returned to you depends on the remote mail system, but you always will
 receive notification if your message cannot be delivered.

 Confirmation/Receipts

 Requests for receipts will be generated only when the message leaves
 CompuServe and is transmitted into Internet.  Receipts to indicate when
 the user actually receives the message are not available through
 Internet.

 RECEIVING MESSAGES FROM INTERNET
 
 CompuServe allows a message to be received from the Internet system to
 your mailbox.
 
 Format

 The Internet user needs your correct Internet address to send a message
 to your mailbox.  Your address is:

 1 - Your User ID with the comma changed to a period.
 2 - The CompuServe domain which is -compuserve.com-
 3 - The correct addressing format to send the message.  This format
     varies from one system to another.  Typically, the address is shown
     as -User <a href="mailto:ID@COMPUSERVE.COM?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%2030-Apr-91%20#193">ID@COMPUSERVE.COM</a>-.  For example:

            <a href="mailto:70002.002@COMPUSERVE.COM?subject=Re:%20Z*Magazine:%2030-Apr-91%20#193">70002.002@COMPUSERVE.COM</a>

 The sender should check at his/her mail location for the correct format.
 Remember - the format may vary, but the essential elements of the
 address will stay the same.

 NOTE:
 
 - Your User ID MUST be addressed using a period NOT a comma
 - -COMPUSERVE.COM- is essential
 - Messages sent through Internet to CompuServe mailboxes include routing
   information and headers which are added to the top of the message
   before it reaches CompuServe's system.
