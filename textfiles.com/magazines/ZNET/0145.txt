I am pleased to announce that we have selected a new Editor.  Harold 
Brewer will stand in this place next week.  Also, 80 column formatting 
will be suspended while we return to 40 column Atascii editions.

Harold will bring new life to this publication which has been hurting for 
attention.  Due to the present commitments I have, editing two and three 
publications can take it's toll.   However, I will still be around with my 
words and commentary.

Your feedback is important.  Harold can only produce material with your 
assistance.  Keeing the editor up to date on YOUR ideas can only help this 
electronic magazine.  We are comitted to continuing weekly publishing for 
the 8-bit Atari.

Z*Net has finally been released after a long period of discussion and 
planning.  If you missed the official press release, I have included

Subj:SDX

El B.B.S. esta corriendo bajo el cartucho Spartados de ICD. (SDX), y por
tanto, estamos a metodo de prueba. El cartucho trae varias utilidades que
me facilitan el uso de la maquina, pero por momentos me da a pensar que no
es totalmente compatible con el sistema. Poco a poco ire arreglando los
'bugs'.

Los mensajes de Swap Shop y File FActs fueron borrados porque en su gran
mayoria estaban lejos de la edad de vencimiento y habian tomado 'hilos'
que no tenian nada que ver con el uso de esas bases. Por favor limiten las
discusiones generales a Round Table, Ladies' Forum, y TUPLAG, y eso,
dentro de lo que cabe.

Por cierto, me gustaria mucho si los usuarios 8bit empezaran a enviar sus
programas ARC-eados en vez de metodo normal, con un pequeno texto
explicando su funcion y como utilizarlo. Eso ahorraria mucho espacio en el
BBS. Desgraciadamente el club no tiene el dinero para aumentar el sistema,
y por lo tanto no lo preveemos en un futuro cercano. Ahora mismo se le
esta dando prioridad de recursos a Pan*Atari*News (de la que por el
momento tambien soy editor) ya que este es un servicio que llega a mas de
200 familias.

Si alguno tiene ideas 'innovativas'  en como podemos levantar el dinero,
para digamos, un hard disk para est e bbs (alrededor de $700), estamos
abiertos al dialogo. Aunque una simple donacion tambien sera aceptada
(ja).

##############################
<*>  GALAXY STARLINK
##############################
by WK Whitton
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you well know, the folk at PC Pursuit have decided to really stick it
to its faithful users, and has initiated a new policy of a cap on online
hours while at the same time increasing the rates charged. In a flurry of
rage, a mass cancellation of user accounts took place, all in protest of
these unfair tactics.

I am pleased to announce that someone has seen the monetary potential in
providing a similiar service, and we are now able to share the details of
this with you. The very best part of this is that the service is already
in effect and ready to roll!

ANNOUNCING: GALAXY STARLINK     What is it?

Galaxy STARLINK is an asynchronous outdial service that permits you to
make off-peak calls to thousands of Bulletin Board Systems in 91 cities in
28 states for only $1.50 per hour of connect time.

When will it be available?

It is available right now! Users may sign up by modem for the service.

Who operates it?

STARLINK is a service of Galaxy Telecomm Division, GTC, Inc., the
publishers of BBS Telecomputing News, Galaxy Magazine and other electronic
publications, located in Virginia Beach, VA.

Why is this service available?

GTC purchases large blocks of time from Tymnet, the national packet
switching network, for the users of Galaxy Information Network, and makes
these connect hours available to anyone wishing to avail themselves of the
service. Galaxy Information Network is GTC's multiuser online information
and -Chat- system.  In addition to connecting with Galaxy, STARLINK
members may use the Tymnet Outdial service to place calls to thousands of
other systems and receive one bill each month from GTC for the connect
charges.

How much does it cost? What do I get for my money?

There is a one time sign up charge of $50.00 and a monthly service charge
of $10.00 to cover administration and billing services.  Each member
receives two hours of free system time on Galaxy Information Network each
month (exclusive of connect charges).  All network connect charges are
billed at the end of each month for actual time used at $1.50 per hour.
All online system time in excess of two hours per month is billed at $2.00
per hour.

Example:

Member calls Galaxy Information Network for five hours during the month
using GTC's STARLINK service through the Tymnet system and makes twenty
hours of calls to other systems through Tymnet:

        Monthly Service charge          $10.00          $10.00

        First two hours free            $  .00
        Excess hours                    $ 6.00
                                        ------
        Total system charges              6.00          $ 6.00


        STARLINK charges
        (5 hours calling Galaxy)        $ 7.50
        (20 hours calling elsewhere)    $30.00
                                        ------
                                        $37.50          $37.50

        Total Charges                                   $53.50

(each additional hour of connect time would add $1.50 to this bill)

There is no requirement to use the Galaxy Information Network.  The two
free hours are included as this is where billing invoices are left for the
members.  Galaxy is, however, a fun system to use with on-line live
chatting, live interactive games, up-to-the-minute national news and many
other services.  Members may simply use the STARLINK service to access
other systems.

Is there a limit to how much I can use?

No, you can use as much time as you wish each month.

Can I get a discount for higher volume usage?

Sorry, no!  Our low rate of $1.50 per hour precludes this.

What payment methods do you have?

You may charge your monthly bill to Visa, Mastercharge, or sign up for
checkfree automatic bank debit.  You will be notified of charges via
e-mail message to you on Galaxy.

What do I do to sign up?

Have your computer call 804-495-INFO. Have your credit card number ready
if you are charging your account to Visa or Mastercard.  If you are
planning to use Checkfree, have a check ready to get information from.
After you have answered a few questions and your account has been
established, you will be mailed a member's agreement with your STARLINK
username and password along with your local access telephone number.  When
STARLINK receives your signed agreement, your Username and password will
be activated and you will be able to start making calls.

Can I call by voice?

No!  They simply cannot handle the volume of calls.  All signups must be
done by modem.

What cities can I call out to?

The following is a listing of major cities.  In addition to these cities,
there are many others that are a local call from the ones listed.

subscription cost and is exclusive of the hours used.

<*>  ANTIC MAY 1989 CONTENTS
##############################

The May issue of Antic is our Seventh Anniversary issue, featuring the
1989 ANTIC AWARDS For outstanding Atarian achievement.  Each year at this
time we try to single out the best of the companies who support the 8-bit.
With the lack of 8-bit support these days, these companies deserve our
thanks more than ever! 

We also have a review of three NEW 8-BIT POWER TOOLS. Matt Ratcliff, our
own hardware maven, reviews Quintopus, XF551 Enhancer, and Atari View 8.
Matt also provided this issue's Disk Bonus:  COVOX COACH and YAK-SPELL.
For use with the COVOX Jr., COVOX COACH is a tutorial that will show
intermediate to advanced BASIC programmers how to make their own talking
programs that play back without hardware add-ons.  Even if you don't have
the COVOX Jr., and don't program, you can still run YAK-SPELL, a spelling
quiz that talks -- in Matt's own voice! 

More goodies for programmers: 

ATARI BASIC ENHANCEMENTS by Paul Alhart is a library of handy high-powered
routines that let you do DOS functions from BASIC, without going to DOS --
and without losing your program in memory. 

Fumble-fingered programmers can now protect themselves from accidentally
clearing the screen.  BUTTERFINGERS by Kevin Gevatosky is a handy little
BASIC program that disables the screen-clearing [SHIFT][CLEAR]
combination. 

Just for fun, IRRATIONAL COMPUTING is Brian Siano's account of his -Kook
Mail- database.  He's got them sorted by categories ranging from -Dull and
Boring- to -Truly Strange Minds- -- and they're an interesting bunch.

More seriously, George Lockard tells how he uses his 8-bit on a NASA
research project in SPACE-AGE ATARI. 

Thomas Simmons tells how to make your own thermal printer ribbons in
SIMMONS THERMAL RIBBONS.  You can ink your own -- and sometimes get better
copies. 

Dr. Jeffrey Summers reviews MIDIMAX, an affordable 8-bit MIDI interface,
with software.  If you're interested in MIDI, this review is definitely
worth a look. 

This issue also has two great games.  For adventure/maze game fans, THE
SECRET OF KYOBU DI by Bernard Taylor is a complex death maze and treasure
hunt, set in old Japan. CRIBBAGE ATARI by David Osborn is a fun version
of the card game, complete with -pegs- onscreen.  The computer makes a
wily opponent, and a good instructor, showing you the scoring system even
as it adds up the points.


##############################
<*>  MICROMISER UPDATE
##############################
(Editors Note:  A few weeks ago we published released material about 
MicroMiser Software.  THe following is another response from the President 
of the company.)

2/13/89
Dear Atari user,

As president of Micromiser Software I wish to respond to Kenneth Gilbert's
letter (irate customer) which appears in Atari8 Roundtable, Category 12,
topic 2.

We charge extra for shipping to Canada because there are several added
expenses for us. First, due to the volatile drug situation, the Post
Office sometimes enforces the requirement of a customs declaration, even
to Canada. Since this seems to vary from day to day and among different
package sizes and types, at least at our Post Office, and because we have
no shipping department, we go to the Post Office with every foreign
shipment to make sure there will not be a problem.

Secondly, mail delivery in Canada is not as reliable as it is in the
United States--many Canadians have told us so. The delays and undelivered
products increase our average support cost, telephone calls, etc., to
Canada. Since we send free update disks, product updates, and support
disks to our foreign customers, this multiplies the expense. One of the
biggest problems is the Customs inspection. They variously open mail,
handle it, bend it, X-ray it, etc., though we stamp it with the -FLOPPY
DISK- message.

On average it costs us more than $5 extra per sale, though we billed
Kenneth only $3.80 extra. Due to this some retailers refuse to ship to
Canada period, for instance Horizon Computers, who are the largest 8-bit
Atari distributors. We usually minimize the value declaration to save our
customers import fees, for which Kenneth, in apparent ignorance of this,
takes us to task.  Other than Kenneth, all 200+ Canadian customers have
understood the shipping charge with no explanation required. We think it
is obvious to anyone and that it does not require lengthy explanation.

His rationale about the legal requirements of advertising is irrelevant,
not to mention unfair. The entire extent of our media advertising for
Turboword to date has been one line in 7 pt. type at the bottom of our
(already too wordy) Turbobase ad, -80 Col word processor $49.- and this is
in U.S. magazines only. He sent us the price without shipping, and, not to
cause a 20 day  delay for him, we provided an unusual service, sending the
program and billing the shipping. He is right that he is not legally
obligated to pay the shipping, and he can legally take advantage of our
trust.

His -error 168- tells us exactly what caused his various -bugs,- since it
is a device command error, and in that function the command is contained
in the programming--it is not entered by the user. No others, including
us, have had this -bug- or his other disk I/O -bug.- So his disk had to be
damaged in shipping; most likely by the Customs inspection. The logic: it
is the customs inspection that causes the shipping charge, it is the
shipping charge Kenneth refuses to pay unless we add new features for him
for free, we can't add new features for him for free, therefore we cannot
support his application.

Incidentally and unnecessarily, double-spacing is not an -assumed
feature- since many word processors don't have it and most printers do.
We wrote the first version primarily for our Turbobase customers, who do
not need double spacing, and all have good printers. We never implied
otherwise in ads or on the package. Kenneth saw our feature list. Double
spacing wasn't on it. He never called to ask. Seems strange since it's so
important to him. By the way, any word processor can be made to double
space on most printers just by setting the dip switch to add a carriage
return to the Atari return.

I received a letter from one customer compaining that Turboword would ONLY
double space--she didn't change the dip switch when switching to the
parallel port on the XEP-80.

His suggestion for more -intuitive- printer instructions would destroy the
WYSIWYG feature, which is why we wrote the program.  Turbobase, grudgingly
acknowledged even in it's most critical reviews as the most powerful
productivity product for 8-bits, is written in BASIC. This offends almost
everyone's OPINION about BASIC, but it is a fact easily verifiable by
anyone. I wonder if Kenneth also gives his doctor such technical hints.

Because of Kenneth's diatribe, which is the most illogical we have ever
received, and that I have ever received in 30 years of successfully 
operating four businesses, I knew that a logical explanation would have
been useless.  I therefore sought a quick reply that would be productive
to someone--anyone. Since Kenneth's letter had upset my wife, who sorts
the mail, the -space- letter cheered her up a bit. But mainly, it was
designed to attract attention and to be entertaining. Obviously many have
found it so.

When logic does not apply, one defaults to an alternative method, and
entertainment is equally as bad as any. I thought it would get good play
around the dorm, necessarily causing Kenneth to show his letter to other
students. Hopefully, that would provoke one of his friends to suggest to
Kenneth that, perhaps, his letter was not a model letter for a support
request. Well, it worked too well, as you know.  Kenneth's letter was
designed to waste our time, which is now accomplished. There are two
unopenned packages containing disks in my support file from serious
customers who will now have to wait another day.

Some sympathize with Kenneth and this response won't change those minds.
To those: Why must you write such letters, use the the -legal eagle-
standard, and the -guilty until proven innocent- standard?  What do you
gain? Who are you punishing? Me? For what? Writing Atari software, being
imperfect, making mistakes? Or because you can't get someone else's
hardware/software to work? Who knows in a particular case? Why is my desk
your philosophical garbage dump? Because I'm accessible, answering the
phone and responding to mail myself? Please buy products from our
competition. They have plenty of hold buttons, elevator music, form
letters and $4/hr -support technicians- to solve problems like Kenneth's.

It has been proven redundantly that it is not profitable to do business
with you, and that you ruin a good thing for everybody. Next time you're
in a disco and a drunk starts a fight, don't ask the -greedy proprietor-
to throw the guy out--remember, you are on the side of the -customer.-

We'll continue to serve and support to the best of our ability those who
consider a business transaction as a constructive enterprise with fair
responsibilities on both sides, designed to reach a common goal. 98% of
the market is profitable enough for us. We thank those 98% of our
customers who have made our endeavors so rewarding. I hope you will
continue to send suggestions and inform us of any difficulties you are
having. And, as always, we will do our best to help you.
