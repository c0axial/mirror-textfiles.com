|_______________|
| COMPATIBILITY |
|_______________|

I tested the SupraModem 2400 while running my OASIS BBS and calling out with
both EXPRESS! 850 v.3.0 and the OASIS terminal program.  The SupraModem 2400
worked fine with the following RS232 interfaces:

     - ATARI 850 interface with RS232.COM R: handler
     - ICD P:R connection with PRCSYS.COM R: handler
     - ICD MIO internal RS232 port with NO R: handler

I was able to run my BBS in all three configurations.  Of course no external R:
handler was necessary to run EXPRESS! 850 v.3.0.  Also note that the SupraModem
2400 will operate with the DTR signal from the ICD MIO internal RS232 port.
Another compatibilty note is that the SupraModem can be used by software that
is looking for the AVATEX modem, or a HAYES modem.  I used both configurations
on the BBS.  Lastly, under 24 hour operation, the SupraModem 2400's casing
temperature is still cool to the touch.

_________R-Time Resurrection!________
_______________________________________
by Mike Brown

Possibly one of the neatest, but least understood of ICD's fine product line is
the R-Time 8 cartridge. Simply put, this inexpensive module allows you to 
automatically enter the TIME and DATE into your system, from a battery backed
up clock.

If you are running SpartaDOS or a BBS, it is handy to have your files
automatically -timestamped-. It is useful to know how -old- a file is 
sometimes, especially if on-line disk space is limited. If you are using BBS
EXPRESS, it will -look- for the R-time and update the Time, Date, and Day of
the Week for you at BBS initialization. True, it is not a big deal to enter
these values each time you start the BBS, but if you are like me, it is so much
nicer to have your computer -tell time-!

Like anything that runs on batteries, the day will come when a new battery is
needed. This day came for me just this past week. Suddenly the time/date
functions were all whacko, ranging from before world war II to the 60's! It was
time to fix the way-back machine, Mr. Peabody.

Prying open the case that the R-time 8 is enclosed in (looking like a new-wave
video game cart) gave both good news and bad news: First the good news- The
battery used in the RT is similar to a standard 3 volt lithium -coin style-
(looking like an overactive thyroid watch battery) style that is used in
popular IBM-PC multifunction boards. The bad news- It is SOLDERED ON to the RT
printed circuit board (Actual Ray-O-Vac part number BR2325-T3)! Faced with the
prospect of a long wait in the mails to get it fixed at ICD, I knew there must
be a better way.

Having had some experience with having a battery like this go dead on an (IBM
Type) AST SixPack multifunction card, I went to the shop where I had that board
fixed to see if they had the battery and the -holder- in the style that the AST
board used (Snap In-- Not Solder!).

I have to give these guys credit, they threw themselves into it with vigor- It
took Ken and Tom about 2 mins. flat to rip the old soldered-in battery out, and
solder in the new pop-in holder (about $2). After that work was done, it was a
simple matter to pop a BR2325 battery (about $3).

If you are ever in Ashland, OH, please stop in to INFOPRO on Main Street; they
have been super in helping with my Atari-related questions (even though they
sell Kaypros).

Wow, less than 5 mins work, and now I can change my own batteries, and -never-
have to worry about it again.  The catalogs I have show the battery ICD used at
about $4.40, and the holder/battery combination that I used costs less than $5.
I wonder why ICD went that route? Be sure to trim the excess length of the
leads on the non-component side of the PC board, and be sure you get the
POSITIVE (+ Generally the side with all of the printing) side of the -coin- UP.
Those are the only two tricky parts to this installation.

Note of CAUTION! If you have not worked with soldering components to PC boards,
get an experienced friend to help you. Too much heat can damage your R-Time 8
badly! We cheated and used a Vacuum desoldering station; nice if you can afford
one.

Of course, this modification will VOID your ICD warranty! When you plug the
R-Time 8 back into your computer, be sure to do a TIME and DATE command if you
are using SpartaDOS to reset the R-Time 8's clock! (other DOS users should
consult the ICD documentation to set the clock)

If you have further questions about this modification, please call me on the
Balloon Works (419-289-8392 300/1200) and we'll help as best we can.

Message response to BEKENNEDY. My Genie address is G.FEID. I rarely get on CIS
anymore - 

DO IT YOURSELF HARD DISK DRIVE

The only CLAUG project being worked on right now is a Hard Drive project. It is
being done as an educational program  where the group is getting together all
the parts for a 20meg Hard Drive, including the drive, cables, a Berkeley
BMS-100 board, case and power supply for approximately $400, and the people who
have ordered and paid for them will all get together in a one or two night
session and assemble the units for themselves. This will accomplish several
things - First, it will allow an ST owner to get a brand new HD for $400 or so.

Second, it will give the uninitiated a new look at the inside workings of a 
Hard drive, and Third, it will give the drive owner a sense of accomplishment
because they are literally building it themselves from a pile of parts.

CONNECT STANDARD IBM DRIVE TO ST

Yes, it is VERY possible to attach a 5 1/4- IBM drive DIRECTLY to your ST. All
you need is an inexpensive 360k 5 1/4- floppy drive and a cable with a 34 pin
connector on one end, and an ST drive connector on the other. Plug the 34 pin
edge card connector into the circuit board on the IBM drive, and plug the ST
DIN connector into your A drive, and you are ready to go! This can be done
fairly inexpensively by ordering the case, power supply, and drive separately -
as low as $126, and then getting the cable. Make that $125. The cable is the
hard part. There is only one place I know of that makes them for sale, and that
is E. Arthur Brown in (I believe) Minnesota. They want $40 + shipping for the
cables. If there is enough interest from your group I suggest that you get a
local supporting dealer to order you a bunch of cables, drives, cases, etc.,
and that you hold the same type of seminar - have the people assemble their own
drives as a project. It saves them money, they get a drive they need, and it
gives people who are basically afraid of the inner workings of hardware a
chance to  'Get their feet wet' a little by doing something that is NOT
technical or dangerous. If you want more info, let me know - I'll be glad to
help.

Gerry.

ORIGIN OF THE ZMAGAZINE NAME
_______________________________________

The following are excerpts from a message from Bruce Kennedy. The subject
discussed is the origin of the Zmag name.


I PICKED IT UP FROM TWO BBS MENUS IN THE CHICAGO AREA. ALAN REEVE WAS THE ASST.
SYSOP ON ONE OF THEM, WHICH HAS SINCE CLOSED DOWN. THE OTHER WAS Gerry Feid's
Claug II board which has since become Blue Moon. Those old Boards ran a Zmag
section but nobody was contributing. When I made it happen, that's when it
started. I liked it on a menu because it always scrolled up at the bottom. My
objective was to target new users and emphasize user friendly programs
epitomized by KL's 1030 Express!

ATARI SCUTTLEBITS--NOVEMBER
_______________________________________
By Bob Kelly

ATARI and It's Competitors .........

Prior to -Black Monday- (October 19, 1987), the stock market had been in a
period of decline since August.  Atari stock at closing on October 16, 1987
stood at $10, down over 30% in the last month and a half (see September column
for more details).  Rumors about Atari continued to circulate in the user
community: Gary Tramiel was focusing on shaping-up Federated stores while Sam
runs Atari, implying, of course, that Jack lost interest in running both;
dealers didn't have the new products on the East Coast and Canada, implying
either poor management or a break down in the Far East supply chain. The rumors
multiplied and I could not verify a single one of the many.  Complicating the
picture is one known fact, Atari fired the last three successive Vice
Presidents for marketing, faster, it seems, than the blitter chip can refresh
the screen.

To the outside world, this turmoil makes Atari seem not only to be at war with
itself, but also with its customers.  Thus, by either inference or divine
judgement many investors believed something to be wrong in the house of
Tramiel.  Now along comes Black Monday, the stock market falls by 508 points.
Atari's stock (ATC) drops another 20% to $8 per share.  Coupling the general
economy-wide factors negatively impacting the stock market with Atari's
perceived unsettled management situation leaves an investor less than
optimistic about short-term performance potential.  I have placed an automatic
sell order to minimize my loss should ATC decline further.

While this story has been unfolding, other computer manufacturers reported
impressive returns for 1987.

Apple:
It was all smiles at Apple Corporation prior to October 19.  The firm
experienced its second record growth quarter in a row.  For the quarter ending
September 25th, sales were $786 million versus $511 million for the same period
last year, an increase of 54%.  For the preceding quarter, sales increased by
42%.  For the entire fiscal year of 1987 sales were roughly $2.7 billion versus
$1.9 billion in 1986, a 40% increase.

In the final quarter of the 1987 fiscal year, it is believed Apple sold more
than 175,000 MacIntosh computers, compared with 85,000 for the same three
months of 1986.

The Wall Street Journal reported that some analysts believe Apple can continue
pricing the MacIntosh at what the market will bear since IBM will not have a
comparable graphics machine for at least 18 months, more likely 24 months.  It
would appear, market analysts simply do not feel Atari at this juncture is a
threat to the dominance of the Mac.  Quite simply, the Atari ST appears an
also-ran in the business market where the MacIntosh is now considered to be a
significant force (see table below).

Market Share By Manufacturer
(Jan-Aug. 1987)

IBM...........40.3%
Apple.........19.1%
Compaq........15.5%
Epson..........4.1%
AT&T...........3.1%
Kaypro.........2.8%
Others........15.1%

Source:  InfoWorld

Despite the success of the Mac, Apple still relies quite heavily upon the Apple
II computer line estimated to account for nearly 40% of the company's total
sales.  A considerable portion of the Apple II sales are to the educational
market.  Although IBM introduced a machine specifically targeted at the
educational market last September, sales have been a disappointment to-date.
This criticism can also be aimed at Atari, which seems to have had little
impact in the educational market.  School systems in the Washington D.C. area
which were in the earlier years committed to the Atari 8 bit line do no seem to
be purchasing either the 520 ST or 1040 ST as they upgrade.

Apple closed at $36.5 on October 19, down more than $25 per share in the last
month.  It looks like a good buy at this price.

IBM:
International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation announced it's first
significant increase in profit since early 1986.  For the 3rd quarter of 1987
profits rose by 12.2%.  For the 9 months of 1987, total revenues rose by 5.5%
to $36.2 billion from $34.3 billion for the same period of 1986.  (Did you
notice that IBM's total revenues over the last four quarters are more than 25
times larger than Apple total sales for fiscal 1987.)

Despite this impressive gain, IBM stock did not appreciate prior to Black
Monday.  Investors held back puzzled as to why IBM's profitability failed to
improve more significantly given that 14,000 employees were laid off at the end
of the second quarter.  On the other hand, IBM profitability was aided by the
fall in the U.S. dollar which added roughly $300 million in profits and over $2
billion to revenue over the first 3 quarters of 1987.

IBM closed at $125.25 per share on October 19.  If I only had some more cash on
hand to buy.  This market close was more than $50 below its August high.
However, be prepared to move out again quickly with the blue chips such as IBM.

Nibble Bits:

o WordPerfect 4.1 for the Atari ST is now available.  It has all the pull-down
  menus and features that accompany the MacIntosh version released last month.
  Early purchasers say it has a few bugs but knowing the folks from Word
  Perfect, they will be corrected in very short order.  L&Y Computers in
  Woodbridge is selling version 4.1 for around $200.

o A high resolution color monitor is being made for Atari right now in the Far
  East.  It will be compatible with both the ST line of computers and the Mega.
  Look for this monitor around June 1988.

o According to a rumor reported in InfoWorld, look for Steve Jobs of Apple fame
  to share with Atari Corp. a custom graphics chip.  According to this report,
  it will be shown at Atari's booth at COMDEX.

Next month some Christmas suggestions for both the ST and 8 bit machines and
electronics in general.

128K 130XE COMPATIBLE RAM EXPANSION FOR THE XE-GAME SYSTEM

by Ray McGoldrick

I have tested this expansion and found it to be fully compatible with the 128K
Atari 130XE, HOWEVER I can assume no responsibility for how this expansion is
installed. The procedure requires soldering directly to IC chips in the XE-GAME
System and should be preformed by an Atari service center or someone
experienced with this type of procedure.

I've made up a 'kit' with all the required parts for $25.00. To receive the kit
send check or money order to.
