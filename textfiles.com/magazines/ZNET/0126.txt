FROM THE TOP-SUMMARY of COMPUSERVE CONFERENCE WITH SAM TRAMIEL
by Michael Brubaker  Editor, O.P.A.C.E. JOURNAL
Ohio/Pennsylvania Atari Computer Enthusiasts

Atari Corp. plans to be number two or three in the world personal computer
market and hopes to make its ST computer line one of the standard machines
in the US during during 1989 according to Sam Tramiel, Atari Corp.
President. (Sam and his brothers Leonard and Gary work with their father
Jack Tramiel running Atari which Jack Tramiel bought from Warner
Communications in July, 1984.) Mr. Tramiel made these comments during a
conferance on the Atari SIG on COMPUSERVE recently. (A transcript of the
conferance can be downloaded from Library 15 on the ATARI16 forum on
COMPUSERVE, or read in ZMAG Issue #126. The conference file is named
SAM-T.CO.) Approximately 95 people joined in the electronic conference
according to Ron Luks, SYSOP and conference coordinator. This was a record
level of participation in an ATARI SIG conferance said Luks.

Other topics of interest that Mr. Tramiel mentioned were:

- At the present time Atari is shipping all of its announced new models
  (unnamed, but presumed to be the MEGA4 ST, MEGA2 ST, PS clone machines,
  and the XE computers) to Europe. It is also shipping its Abaq transputer
  to European developers. The Abaq is now called the ATW for Atari Work
  Station.

- Atari plans to start shipping the above computers -in earnest- to the US
  market in 1989.

- Mr. Tramiel blames the DRAM shortage for Atari's inability to make many
  of its computers available in the US. He said Atari cannot keep up with
  demand for its computers in Europe and other parts of the world, but
  hopes to improve this in 1989. Atari has just signed a major deal with
  a large DRAM supplier, he said.

- Atari's current low level of advertising and marketing of its computers
  in the US is due to the above noted supply/production problems. -We feel
  that advertising wihout product availability is helpful in selling our
  competitors' machines, and therefore, will just waste money.-, he said.
  Atari is already diverting products it could sell in Europe and other
  parts of the world to supply its -few but loyal- US dealers.

- Many of the conferance participants expressed feelings that Atari's
  support for US software and hardware developers is minimal. They pointed
  out that Word Perfect Corp. seems to have put its ST product development
  on hold, and Compute has dropped its COMPUTE ST magazine. Mr. Tramiel's
  answers to these questions were essentially that Atari has lots of
  support available for developers and figures that its planned increase
  in US product availability and resulting increase in sales (-tens of
  thousands of ST's sold monthly in the US.-) will attract third party
  development and support for its computers. Meanwhile, Mr. Tramiel
  encourages US developers to export their products to Europe where the
  ST is very popular.  This -would help themselves and the (US) economy.-

- Highlighting European and world support for Atari's products Mr. Tramiel
  described recently attending the Annual Atari Fair in Dusseldorf,
  Germany. Over 30,000 people attended the show in one weekend! Also,
  Tramiel said -we are selling many tens of thousands of the XL/XE line in
  Europe, and in the Middle East, and in Latin America. Atari plans to
  bring European ST software into the US market.

- Atari appears to have few plans for further major support of the 8 bit
  computer line in the US. Atari perceives that -the US market seems to
  want more powerful machines.- They are marketing the XE Game System in
  the US as a combination game system/computer. Their marketing positions
  the XEGS at the same price as a Nintendo system with an exercise mat.
  Atari is now offering a $50 rebate on the XE Game System which prices
  it at $99.

- Regarding new ST products and beyond Mr. Tramiel said that a portable ST
  model is being worked on and will be shipped as soon as it is ready.
  Atari is also working on a 68030 TT computer. Mr. Tramiel made no
  further comments about the TT except -it will knock your socks off!-
  Atari has no plans for an IBM 286 type board for the ST line.

- The new ST TOS ROMS should be available in early 1989 at a -reasonable-
  price.

- Atari has just had three RECORD profit quarters. Mr. Tramiel attributed
  reoprts that Mike Dendo [VP-SALES] had told people in Michigan Atari had
  just had three soft quarters and needed a strong fourth quarter to
  survive to misquotes.

*** October 18, 1988 ***

      *** Welcome to the NEW ATARI ST ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT Forum ***
                     NEW ATARI ST PRODUCTIVITY Forum

This is one of two NEW ATARI forums to support the ATARI ST community. 
Be sure to also try out the ATARI ST PRODUCTIVITY Forum (GO ATARIPRO).
We've moved the appropriate files from the old ATARIDEV and ATARI16 data
LIBraries to their new classifications here, but it wasn't practical to
move over the old messages.  Be sure to check out the names of all the
new message sections and data libraries by issuing the -DES-cription
command once inside the forum.   The sysop staff is the same, old familiar
bunch but we hope you find the new forum configuration to be a big
improvement.  Be sure to check out all the forum ANNouncements, too.

Although we've tried to port over the old membership, your high message
pointers may or may not be reset properly.  (New messages in this forum
start at approx. 40 or so.)   Any journalists who may be operating under
a free flag should be careful to check the entry banner to make sure these
flags carried over.  It may take us a few days to get this situation in
order, so please let SYSOP*Ron Luks know about any problems with special
section access or special membership flags.

                                 OVERVIEW

The Atari ST Arts Forum is comprised of a set of communication tools which
together create a unique environment where you can exchange information
with a whole community (located in different parts of the world) who share
your interest in the exchange of information and programs relating to
Atari ST graphics and entertainment (games).

The Atari ST Arts Forum, like all CompuServe Forums, is comprised of the
following major areas:

                                 MESSAGES

The Message Board of this Forum is where you will find many people
corresponding with each other on a 24 hour basis.  Being that message
correspondence does not require you to be online at the same time as the
person you are exchanging messages with, you can log-on at any convenient
time to read your waiting messages and reply to them in order to keep a
conversation on-going.  This is one of the best methods for meeting new
people from all different types of backgrounds and who are located in
different parts of the world. Enter -MES- at any Forum -!- command prompt
or select the appropriate menu choice to access the Message Center.

                                LIBRARIES

The Libraries section of the Forum is a resource area containing thousands
of programs, text files, picture files, help files, and text files such
as past transcripts from online national conferences, professional
reports, news, and reviews.  Most text material can be read online or
downloaded to your computer system for lasting reference.  Our Libraries
are also filled with a wide assortment of Public Domain and Shareware
entertainment and graphics-related programs which will make your ST do
some unbelievable things! Enter -LIB- at any Forum -!- command prompt or
select the appropriate menu choice to access the Forum's Libraries.

                           CONFERENCE COMMANDS

/NAME    -   Allows you to set/shorten the name you use in conference.
/ROOM #  -   Allows you to change conference rooms.
/USERS   -   View the list of users in the conference area.
/EXIT    -   Exit the conference area.
/HELP    -   Obtain a complete list of conference commands.

Remember - Press CONTROL-V to view your current text (which has not been
transmitted).  Press CONTROL-U to erase your current text (which has not
been transmitted).

Keep your text lines as short as possible (no more than 80 characters is
recommended).  End your lines with a -...- to indicate that you will be
continuing your statement with the next line.  End your line with a single
period or a -GA- (GO AHEAD) to indicate you are done.

We are really glad that you have chosen to join us here in sharing
information and top-quality public domain graphics and entertainment
software for your Atari 16-Bit (ST) computer system.

SIG*ATARI has certain operational policies that were established to help
make the forum run more smoothly and professionally.  A list of these
policies and other very useful forum information can be found in the
Membership Information file which can be found in the ANNOUNCEMENTS area
of the Forum.  If you haven't read it yet, we urge you to read it at your
earliest convenience.  Most of the rules are very straight-forward and
easy to follow.

                             ** IMPORTANT: **

One of our policies is that we require all of our members to use their
REAL FULL name in the forum; -Handles- or just first names are not
accepted.  If you made a mistake when the forum asked you to type in your
name, no problem!  As soon as you are at the Forum's MAIN MENU, type
OP;NAME followed by pressing [RETURN] and the forum will ask you to type
in your name again.  REMEMBER -- your FULL REAL name!

If you are confused or need assistance, the HELP command will work at most
levels in the forum.  If you are still confused or have a question or
comment about your Atari computer, POST A MESSAGE!  One of the Sysops or
members will get back to you with a speedy reply. We are here to help you
get the most out of your Atari and CompuServe so do not hesitate to call
on us!

Step by Step Solution

This step by step solution is for the under ground tunnel system only and
not every move you have to make in the game is here but only the steps you
have to make in the tunnel system. When you see E6 this means you turn
East and make 6 step by pressing East when done press GO and continue to
the next instruction at the end of the steps you go UP and you are now at
the location specified. If you ever make an error or miss a step you will
have to start over because you have to do this exactly.

You start at T (Starting Point)
      go E6, N4  you are now in Swiss

From S to E (Swiss to Egypt)
      W4, N1, E6, S2, E1 you are now in Egypt

From E to G (Egypt to Greece)
     E1, N1, W1 you are now in Greece

From G to I (Greece to India)
     E1, N2, E2, S3, E1 you are now in India

From I to O (India to New York)
     W1, N3, W16, S1 you are now in New York

From O to J (New York to Japan)
     W6, N1, W14, S2, E5 you are now in Japan

From J to N (Japan to China)
     W4 you are now in China

From N to C (China to Carrabean)
     E1,  S3,  E2, N1, E4, S1, E2, S1, E2, S1, E8, N3
     you are now in the Carrabean

From C to L (Carrabean to London)
     E8, N2, W2, N1, E3 you are now in London

From L to F (London to San Francisco)
     W3, S2, W12, N1, E1 you are now in San Francisco

From F to W (San Francisco to Washington)
     W1, S1, E10, N2, W2, S1, W3 you are now in Washington

Easy Hacking -- 1050 Drive Select Switch by Don Neff
 
Preface
 
When I began writing this hardware hacker's column, I thought it would be
of interest to only the most experienced hackers.  To my surprise, I find
that there is a large number of beginners who are interested in hardware
hacking but don't know how to start.  Unfortunately, some of you started
with my projects and found them to be too hard.  Therefore, this month
we'll address the needs of the beginning hackers.  The following project
is an easy one which can't hurt your drive if you make a mistake
installing it.
 
The Project
 
We'll be installing a switch on the front of your disk drive to allow you
to assign it as Drive 1, 2 or 3.  To change the drive number on a standard
Atari 1050, you must turn the drive around backwards and move the two
hidden slide switches with a pen or screwdriver.  Since I never seem to
remember the proper positions of these switches, I had to spend a lot of
time looking up the information in one of my books first.  This meant that
I, like most of you, never changed my drive numbers once they were set,
and always booted off of the same drive.  After a while that boot drive
became noisey and finally wore out while my other drives received little
use at all.  The solution was to install an easily accessible switch on
each drive and boot off of a different one each time I used the computer.
 
The things You Need
 
Everything you'll need is available from Radio Shack.  When I mention each
item for the first time, I'll include the Radio Shack part number in
parantheses after the name of the item.  Radio Shack stores display their
parts in numerical order so you can locate what you need by the part
number instead of the part name.  Their sales people can help you locate
anything you can't find by yourself but, they can't help you a bit with
your electronic questions. (People who understand electronics don't have
to work for Radio Shack wages.)
 
First you'll need a low-power soldering pencil (64-2070), a stand
(64-2078) to keep it off your work table, and some thin solder (64-005).
Use stranded (not solid), soft copper wire (278-1307) of 22-24 gage for
hookup wire (avoid any wire the phone company uses).  Long-nose pliers
(64-1843) and diagonal cutters (64-1841) are required for almost every
project.  If you find you can't strip wire with the diagonal cutters
without amputating the end of the wire, you should also get an adjustable
wire stripper (64-1952).
 
The resistor color code is easy to remember if you know the story about
Violet and the Bad Boys; however, this is a family magazine so I had
better not tell you about it here.  Instead, you can pick up a pocket
guide (271-1210) which tells you the value of a resistor when you dial in
the colors.
 
This project requires only one part -- a Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT),
Center Off, Toggle Switch (275-325).  You'll need one of these three
position switches for each of your drives.

Getting started

Clean off an area on your work bench or table to give a comfortable
amount of room to work in.  Wet the sponge in your soldering iron stand,
set the soldering pencil in the wire coil and plug the power cord in to
warm it up. We'll disassemble the drive while the pencil warms up.
 
Opening the Drive
 
Disconnect all the cables from your drive and set it upside down on the
work bench.  Unscrew the six phillips head screws which hold the case
together. You'll be able to remove only the two which hold the front panel
in place, the other four sit in deep holes.  Hold the case together with
both hands and turn the drive right side up again, allowing the four
remaining screws to fall out. Set the drive on the bench and lift up the
back of the top half of the case. The top half of the case will pivot at
the front until the front panel snaps out.  Set the top of the case and
the front panel out of the way for now.
 
The drive mechanism sits on four posts above the circuit board and is not
fastened to anything.  The wires connecting the mechanism to the circuit
board are fragile and can not withstand any pulling so we will not attempt
to remove them.  The circuit board is held in place by two plastic tabs,
one on each side of the drive mechanism.  Gently lift up on the front of
the circuit board (not the drive mechanism) as you hold each of the tabs
back with a screw driver. Hold the circuit board and the drive mechanism
together and lift them out of the case, front first.  Four plastic washers
on the mounting post may loosen and fall out as you do this , but no harm
will occur.  Turn the board and drive mechanism up side down on the bench
so you can work on the bottom of the board. Set the bottom of the case out
of the way.
 
Preparing the Soldering Pencil
 
Touch a piece of solder to the end of the soldering pencil to see if it's
warm enough to use -- if the solder melts, it's ready.  Wipe the tip of
the pencil on the sponge to clean it off, and then coat the tip with
solder.  Wipe the extra solder off of the tip with the sponge.  Apply
more solder to the tip and try to get a coat of solder all over the tip.
Once again clean the extra solder off with the sponge.  The tip should now
have an even, shiny coat of molten solder on it.  This is the way it
should always look when you are using it.  If the tip gets dirty or the
solder coating gets dull, you must clean the tip with the sponge again.
 
Installing the Switch
 
Figure 1 shows the area of the bottom of circuit board we will be working
with. It is located at the rear of the board, in the corner with the black
and white drive select switches.  Cut three 15-inch lengths of wire, each
a different color, and strip 3/8 of an inch of insulation from all the
ends. Apply a little solder to the bare ends of the wires (this is called
-tinning- the wire) by holding the tip of the soldering pencil, the end of
a wire and the end of the solder together (you do have three hands, don't
you?) until the wire is hot enough to melt the solder.  Tinning is easier
to do if you have a small vise (64-2094 or 64-2093) to hold the wire.
 
Solder one end of each wire to a pin on the new SPDT switch.  Do not apply
too much solder (if your solder joints are little round balls, you used
too much). If a wire moves before the solder cools, you must resolder that
joint.  Use the diagonal cutters to trim off the excess wire close to the
pins so there are no shorts between the pins.  The free end of the wire
which is soldered to the center pin of the SPDT switch must be soldered
to the connection point labeled A in Figure 1.  The other two wires may
be soldered to the points labeled B and C in Figure 1.  It does not matter
which of these two wires goes to either point as long as there is one wire
on each point.  Only the wire from the center pin of the switch is
critical, and must go only to point A. Check all your solder joints to
make sure they are shiny and smooth.  If any of them are dull or wrinkled,
do them over.  If any of your joints are round balls, remove the excess
solder with solder wick (64-2090) or a solder sucker (64-2086). Make sure
there are no solder bridges between any two solder joints (use a good
light and a magnifier).
 
Hold the circuit board and drive mechanism together and insert them back
into the lower half of the drive case.  The new switch should be extending
out the front and the drive mechanism must be resting on its four support
posts again. Set the black and white drive select switches to the position
for drive 1 (both switches moved away from the cable connectors) and
reconnect the drive to your computer.  Turn on the drive, set the new
switch to its center position, insert a DOS disk and turn on the computer.
The drive should boot as normal as drive #1.  Now turn the new switch to
one of its two side positions and call for a directory of drive #2 from
DOS.  If the directory of the same drive comes up on your screen, the
switch is installed properly.  If DOS times out without giving you a
directory, turn the switch to the other side position and call up the #2
directory again.  If you do not get a directory of this drive either time
you must recheck your wiring and solder joints again.  When you are
successful at getting a directory of this drive as #2, leave the switch
in that position and return the drive to your work bench.
 
Locate a spot for the switch on the front panel and drill a 1/4 inch
mounting hole for it.  Insert the switch through the hole and fasten it in
place with the supplied nut and washers.  The switch should still be in
the same position it was when DOS read the directory as #2 drive.  Mark
this position as #2, mark the opposite position as #3, and mark the center
position as #1 drive. Use a can of compressed air (64-2325) to blow the
dust out of the drive mechanism and apply some oil (64-2301) to the two
metal rails which the head slides on.  Snap the front panel and upper half
of the case back into place and reinstall the six screws on the bottom.
 
Make this modification to all your drives and spread the work evenly
between them from now on.

CIS Uploading Assistance
#########################

Question: what is a 'file type' and why should CompuServe ASK me about it
everytime I upload??? Glad you asked.

When working in the Libraries, you're probably familiar with the series
of menus that come up. Lessee .. we're putting up the DOC file, so first
we tell CIS that we want to UPL MYFILE.DOC (catchy name, huh?)

Got the protocol okay and ... wait a minute ... ANOTHER MENU?? 'file types
available ...' As Dick Vitale says: 'FREEZE IT!'

What is this 'type' stuff??? I JUST WANNA PUT MY FILE UP! Don't Panic.
Time for Small Explanation.

TYPE:BINARY

A 'BINARY' (also called '8-bit') upload means that CIS will accept ANY
character you send it with XMODEM. That means inverse characters, control
characters, and all that other esoteric Atari stuff.

*IMPORTANT*

Note the implication. As explained below, on an 'ASCII' upload, you are
LIMITED to characters with an ASC value LESS than 127!  For this reason,
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE 'BINARY' upload for any kind of program file,
compacted file (ARC, ALF, DCM), or picture file (unless it's in GIF or RLE
format in which case you can choose the appropriate choice from the menu.)

If you DON'T specify 'BINARY' for files like these, chances are they will
arrive at CIS in unuseable form, and you'll have to go through the upload
all over again. No fun...

There's a tag involved with binary UPLoads. Once CIS has your file merged,
it ASSUMES that it's not READable in ASCII (that is ...Straight Text.) So
it puts that /binary flag on it you've undoubtedly noticed on filenames.

Result: if you try to <R>ead a 'BINARY' file online, CIS will first warn
you that it contains 'non-ascii' characters. This goes back to the fact
that CIS is a large service, whose users access it with a wide variety of
machines. ASCII characters less than 127 are generally readable by just
about any machine. Above that, you get things ranging from an Atari RETURN
to IBM Graphics characters. Thus the warning. Normally, you will want to
<D>ownload, rather than <R>ead a binary file.

TYPE:ASCII

Hmm .. with only two choices, would that imply we want to do an 'ASCII'
(aka '7-bit') upload if we want the file Readable Online? All Right! Go to
the head of the class.

That's it exactly. But we have to play fair with Our Host, here, and
follow some rules. If you select 'ASCII' upload, CIS will expect you to
send a STANDARD ASCII file. CIS will <not> accept any character with an
ASC value greater than 127. Any control characters in the file MUST be
intended for ONLY their normal ASCII function. And THAT narrows the field
down to just <TWO> allowable control characters. Control-M for End of
Line. Control-J for Line Feed (hereafter referred to as EOL-LF)

What we're talking about here is a file that is ONLY LETTERS AND NUMBERS.
No inverse, no special characters like 'arrows', 'backspace', 'tab', etc.
This is the kind of file that would be created by most word processors
with a 'print to disk' (not 'SAVE to disk!') command.

Catch the implication there? Your text file <CAN NOT> contain regular
ATARI RETURN characters. Remember, that's a CHR$(155) and we just told
CIS that we weren't gonna send it any bytes bigger than 127!

*IMPORTANT*

Here's the critical part. <IF> you are doing an 'ASCII' upload, you MUST
REPLACE ALL RETURNS IN THE FILE WITH EOL-LF (control-m control-j)!
Luckily, it's not that hard. If you have a word processor that does a
straight 'print to disk', you can probably do it with a simple 'search
and replace' on a 'printed to disk' file and subsequent save.

(Hint: if you're not sure, use the DOS 2.x Copy File command to Copy your
text upload file to the screen. If it's working right, you should see the
file with no break between lines, and EOL-LF being the only 'non text'
characters.)

You can also use one of the several 'conversion' programs available in our
libraries here. My favorite is FILEFIX.COM in Library 3.  Have your file
ready on disk, run FILEFIX and tell it you want to convert CR to EOL-LF.
Viola!  NOW, once you've got your file with all the nasty stuff removed,
you can go ahead and confidently tell CIS you want to go '7-bit' and
proceed. The result is a file with no '/binary' flag. Folks can <R>ead
(and capture) it online. Note, though, that if you DOWnload a file like
this the EOL-LF might still be there. But that's easily handled, again
either with Search and Replace or FILEFIX (this time you'd want to Convert
EOL-LF to CR)

That's about it. Except for one thing. How about BYPASSING those menus all
together? That's where the CIS command line comes in. When working in the
Libraries, you can issue a single command that selects all those options
for you!

Uploading a 7-bit text file? At the DL! prompt, input something like this:

UPL MYFILE.DOC/PROTO:XMO/TYPE:ASCII

See? You've answered those menu questions all at once. If you wanted to
upload an '8-bit' file, you'd use something like this:

UPL MYFILE.BAS/PROTO:XMO/TYPE:BIN

That should get you started. If you have questions, don't hesitate to
yell.   >>don [76704,41]

A Look at ARC

OK, I know that the last time I did this, I said it would be the last.
Well, I lied.  So sue me!  <grin>  The reason for another look at ARC
programs for the Atari 8-bit is the arrival of two new programs for us to
use!
 
The first is the SpartaDOS X cartridge from ICD, Inc. with its built-in
ARC program.  Next, we have the new Super ARC and Super Un-ARC from Bob
Puff, the author of Disk Communicator and other fine programs.

This time, I am sure, will be the last test and comparison that I will do
for the Atari 8-bit ARC programs since there seems to be little room for
improvement, but I'll get to that later.  Since I do believe that this one
is really the last, I have gone into more detail and the article is a bit
longer than its predecessors, but trust me, it is worth reading!
 
Those who have read the older articles that I have done on this subject
will note the absence of Disk Communicator, SCOPY, and other -boot-disk-
programs.  The reason that I have dropped those is that comparing them to
ARC is like comparing apples and oranges <or IBMs>.
    
                        Just What is ARC, Anyway?

ARC is short for ARChive.  It is, basically, a way to reduce the size of
a file, or group of files, so that they may be more efficiently stored or
transfered by modem.

The original ARC was written for the IBM by SEA <System Enhancement
Associates> and has been around in various versions for quite a number of
years.  It has since been ported to the ST, Amiga, Macintosh, Tandy, CP/M,
and other machines.  ARC is very efficient, reasonably fast, and extremely
reliable.  <note that Commodore, Apple, and a few other machines have
-ARC- programs, but they are +not+ compatable with the SEA ARC>  The mark
of the -real- ARC is compatability from one machine to another, that is,
the ability of, say, an ST to recover a file ARC'd on an IBM.  <note that
all three of the ARC programs for the Atari 8-bit pass this test
perfectly> ARC, when compressing files, will use one of five compression
routines.  These routines are:

STORED    --  No compression used.  This is seen mostly with small files.
PACKED    --  Strings of repeated values are collapsed and replaced with
              -tags- that tell where what string goes on recovery.  Note
              that all files are packed before the heavier compression
              routines are called.
SQUEEZED  --  This method uses what's called the Huffman system.  Usually
              only beneficial for large binary files.
CRUNCHED  --  This is the famous Lempel-Ziv compression. It is the most
              effective of all compression routines in general.  There are
              some files that MAY do better with Squeezed, but most will
              be Crunched.
SQUASHED  --  This is a modified LZ compression and is used by the PKARC
              program for the various 16 bit machines.  Because of the
              size of the needed buffers, it may not be possible to ever
              do this type on the Atari 8-bits.

ARC 1.2 uses only the first three methods of compaction, but ARCX 1.2 can
indeed recover Crunched files.  The only disadvantage to this is that ARC
1.2 could not make the smallest possible files.

AlfCrunch uses a modified Crunch system as its only method of compaction.
Because of this modification to the LZ routines, ALF files can not be
recovered with ARCX 1.2 nor can ARC'd files be recovered with AlfCrunch.

Super ARC uses STORING, PACKING, and CRUNCHING.  Just as with SEA ARC
5.21, the SQUEEZED routine was dropped because it was so seldom used and
not checking for SQUEEZED files increased the speed of ARC. I have yet to
see Super ARC STORE a file.

SDXARC uses all four routines.  You could easily have one file in an ARC
that is done in each of the routines.

ARC 1.2, Super ARC and SDXARC will test each file before compacting it to
see what routine will result in the smallest possible file with the least
chance of error.  This all takes time to do.  Super ARC does have an
option that allows you to force it to a Crunch Only mode where all files
are Crunched and no testing is done.  This option greatly increases the
speed of Super ARC.

All this talk about Packing and Crunching is really moot -- It is not
really needed to use ARC but may help you to understand what is really
going on when you ARC a file or recover one that you have downloaded.

So, the bottom line is that ARC is intended to save you time in
transferring files, and space when storing files.

                             A Little History

For many years, we in the Atari 8-bit world had nothing to compress a
single file with.  We had a number of programs to do -boot-disks- with,
such as Masher, Crunch, Shrink, Scrunch, etc., but they were all
unsuitable for doing a single file because they did no compression of the
data.  Then, from Bob Puff, came Disk Communicator.  While still a boot-
isk program, it did do compression.  But, alas, we still had nothing to
really work with.

For a few years, we all stared longingly at the IBM and ST with their
great ARC program, but had to live without it.  Then, thanks to Ralph
Walden, there was an ARC for us to use!  Atari ARC is slow and has a
number of bugs, but it was the best thing going for the past 2 years.

1988 saw an explosion in the Atari 8-bit ARC world.  First, there was
AlfCrunch, by Alfred, that taught us all a lesson in humility.  Yes, the
8-bit CAN run faster than an ST!  Next, there were -rumors- of a new ARC
coming from the Rochester area, and then, -rumors- that ICD would put ARC
into the SDX cart.

Well, those rumors are true!  Super ARC/Un-ARC and SDX ARC are both here
for you to use, right now.  At last, we have a -real- ARC, and not only
that, but we also have a choice.  What more could one ask for?

                              Time is Money

Anyone that uses one of the online data services, such as GEnie or
CompuServe, can tell you this - time is indeed money!  They can also tell
you just how addictive the services are and how expensive all that -free-
software can get!  How can you save money online?  That's easy to answer.
.make things faster!  How?  Well, you can go to 1200 bps, or even 2400
bps.  You can do Ymodem batch downloads of files. You could even use MNP
protocol at 2400 bps to go even faster!

But no matter how fast you get your system, you still have a certain
number of bytes to transfer, and that is really out of your control.

-Well-, you ask, -can't we reduce the bytes that I need to transfer to get
a working program?-  You sure can!  That's where ARC comes in.

Since I am the Atari 8-bit SysOp there, I'm more familiar with GEnie,
I'll just talk about that.  At 1200 bps non-primetime, GEnie will cost you
about $0.083 per minute.  Using Xmodem CRC, you can transfer about 79
characters per second.

What all this means, in everyday terms, is that if you want to download a
file, or group of files, that is 80K bytes long at 1200 bps on GEnie, it
will take you over 17 minutes and cost you $1.44 to do it.

Now, if we ARC the file and reduce its size by 30% <not an unreal figure>
we would only need to download 56K bytes, which t will take only about 12
minutes and cost a mere $1.01 to download.

That 43 cent difference doesn't sound like much, but add it up.  In a
GEnie survey earlier this year, it was found that, of those answering the
survey, over 300 users downloaded at least 500K total bytes per month in
files.  That works out to be a savings of nearly an hour of GEnie time per
month!  If you happen to be at 2400 bps or use Ymodem/1K-Xmodem, the
savings are even greater.

Just to clear things up, most users will not see a decrease in their
GEnie bill.  They will simply download more files and make GEnie an even
better value for their money.

                             What Was Tested?

The programs that were tested were:

AlfCrunch version 1.4 by Jeff Williams <GEnie address ALFRED>
Super ARC/Un-ARC version 2.0 by Bob Puff <GEnie address BOB.PUFF>
ARC/ARCX version 1.2 by Ralph Walden <GEnie address WALDEN>
SpartaDOS X cart ARC version 4.16 by ICD, Inc. <GEnie address ICDINC>

These are the latest versions that I am aware of.  Any use of a non-
urrent version is an over sight.


                         System Used for Testing

The system that I used for testing is the same that I use daily.  It
consists of the following:

Atari 800XL with RAMboXL for 256K RAM
Atari 1050 drive with US Doubler chips
1Mb MIO by ICD, Inc.
Magnavox Color 40 monitor
Atari SX212 modem via MIO
Star NX1000 printer via MIO
SpartaDOS X cartridge, version 4.16 <beta>

The disk drives are set as follows:

D1:  -->  MIO 192K RAMDisk
D2:  -->  1050 floppy
D3:  -->  MIO 832K RAMDisk
D4:  -->  Internal 128K RAMDisk

The SDX CONFIG.SYS file is:

USE WINDOWED
DEVICE SPARTA
DEVICE SIO
DEVICE JIFFY
DEVICE ATARIDOS
DEVICE RAMDISK 4
SET BASIC
SET CAR
SET PROMPT=$L>

The SDX AUTOEXEC.BAT file is:

LOAD COMMAND.COM
TIME
DATE

The machine MEMLO is at $1BBA

There was a BASIC XE cartridge plugged into the SDX cart at all times.


                           The Test Conditions

Before each test was run, the SDX command COLD was given and MEMLO was
confirmed by PEEKing the appropriate memory locations.

Each test was run 4 times and the resulting times were averaged to reduce
the impact of any errors in reading the stop watch.

All times were kept with a stop watch.  Note that I estimate the error
factor to be less than +/- 1 second.

All programs were run from the SDX command line except for ARC12 which was
run from a batch file.

In all cases, the screen was off to increase processing speeds.

In creating the *.ARC/ALF files, the source files were on D4: and the
*.ARC/ALF files were written to D3:.

For recovery testing, the *.ARC/ALF files were on D3: and the recovered
files were written to D4:.

All byte counts are as shown by the SDX DIR command.

Note that while the SpartaDOS X cart is not widely available yet, I used
it to test all the programs.  The reason for this choice is that the SDX
ARC works only with SpartaDOS X.  To pit Atari DOS 2.5 against SpartaDOS
for speed would be crazy.  This way, all the programs are running under
the same conditions and have equal chance to perform.


                             The Source Files

The source files were NOT picked at random.  I tried to select a group of
files that would include one each of as many Atari 8-bit file types as I
could and end up with a total byte count between 70K and 80K bytes.  The
only factors considered when selecting the files to be used were type and
size.

In the chart below, FILE TYPE is the type of file, SIZE is the byte count
of the file, XMODEM is the number of Xmodem blocks needed to transfer the
file, and COST is the approximate cost in dollars to download the file at
1200 bps non-primetime on GEnie using Xmodem CRC.

The files used were:

                            The Test Procedure

The test procedure was a tedious one.  As noted above, each test was run
four times to minimize any errors in the timing values.  Running the old
ARC/ARCX 1.2 four times each was SLOW!

In addition to this, each of the ARC'd files was recovered by ALL the
other programs in order to check for cross compatability problems.
<luckily, there were no such problems encountered>  In other words, the
file created by Super ARC was recovered by Super Un-ARC, ARCX12, and SDX
ARC.  <note that AlfCrunch can not recover ARC'd files nor can ARCX12
recover ALF'd files>


                             The Test Results

The following table gives the results of the tests.  See the legend

In the above table, the program names are as follows:

ARC12  = ARC/ARCX 1.2       ALF    = AlfCrunch 1.4
SupARC = Super ARC/Un-ARC   SDXARC = SpartaDOS X ARC

Note that there were two files created with Super ARC.  SUPARC is the
file created with the default setting of checking each for the type of
compression to use.  SUPARC2 is the file created with the Crunch Only
mode on.

SIZE is the size in bytes of the compacted file.
XMODEM is the number of Xmodem blocks to transfer the file by modem.
COST is the approximate cost to download the file from GEnie at 1200 bps
   non-primetime with Xmodem-CRC.
% REDUCED is the percent of reduction in byte count as compared to the
   total bytes in the single files.
A --m- suffix is the -make- file area and a --r- suffix is the -recover-
   file area.

Example:

To find the time needed by SDXARC to recover a file made with ALF, look
down the left side to find -SDXARC-r- then read across to the right to the
vertical column for ALF to find the time of 0:29.71.  To find how long it
took SDXARC to make a file, find the -SDXARC-m- area on the left side and
read across to the -SDXARC- field in the vertical columns to find the time
of 0:46.07.

Note that the -*- indicates an error condition.  Read the section on
Super ARC below for more information.


                            Editorial Comments

The discussion that follows is an editorial.  It is my opinion based on
the above tests.  It should not be taken to be the opinion of others.

                               ARC/ARCX 1.2

Well, here we are again, talking about ARC/ARCX 1.2 for the 10th time!
This will be short since it is obvious that Ralph's ARC/ARCX has served
its purpose in the Atari world.  We all owe a great debt to Ralph for
doing the first version of ARC for us.  Without his hard work, we might
still be without ARC for the First Atari.  Thanks, Ralph!!

The only errors that I encountered in the testing involved ARC/ARCX. In
the file created with ARC 1.2, when recovered, there were CRC errors on
two of the files.  This was the same no matter what program was recovering
the ARC'd file.  Both files were Squeezed, but note that not all of the
Squeezed files had the CRC errors!  So, based on that, it is fairly well
proven that ARC has the flaw, not ARCX.

Let's move on to bigger and better things now, though.

                              AlfCrunch 1.4

Now we have AlfCrunch.  This was the first of the new programs that
started the 1988 ARC Revolution for the Atari 8-bit.  Out of the blue it
came, with no warning!  When I spoke to Jeff -Alfred- Williams about it,
he was flabergasted at the response from the Atari community.

Sadly, ALF is not compatable with the -real- ARC in any way, but we were
all ready to give up that portability for the speed that ALF gave us.
Lightning fast and very reliable, ALF made us all think that somewhere,
somehow, we may have missed the boat.  If ALF is this fast, why can't ARC
be at least as fast?

Well, it can be.

ALF has been the prime mover in the ARC War, the battle to get we Atari
8-bit users a usable version of ARC.

Again, we all owe Jeff a great vote of thanks for getting us moving!


                        Super ARC and Super Un-ARC

First on the scene with a usable ARC for us was Bob Puff with his Super
Un-ARC.  This program not only recovers ARC'd files fast <faster in fact
than the ST can do it!>, but also recovers ALF'd files faster than
AlfCrunch can.  It has the now characteristic excellent menus that made
Bob and Disk Comm popular.

Just like all of his previous works, Bob has made Super ARC/Un-ARC <just
Super ARC from here on!> very easy to use, fast, reliable, and about as
close to bug free as I have seen.

The only hint of a bug was when Super ARC was recovering the -bad- file
created with ARC 1.2.  When the first CRC error was encountered, the
screen came on and stayed on.  That is why the time for recovering that
file was so long.  <see the -*- in the table above> Even at the 50+
seconds that it took, this is still quite fast!  I personally don't see
this as a bug.  The system told me that something was wrong and wants to
be sure that I know about it.  In fact, I sort of like that.  (NOTE: Bob
has informed me that this is indeed NOT a bug, but a feature that he
programmed into Super Un-ARC.)

In the test result table, you'll notice that there are two files created
by Super ARC.  The one called SUPARC was done with the default settings
where each file is checked to see what compression method would be best
for it.  The one called SUPARC2 was created by forcing the program to use
only the Crunch method.  Because using Crunch Only eliminates the need to
test each file, there is a dramatic speed increase.

With the files tested, Super ARC used the Crunch method in all cases
anyway, so there was no difference in the size of the resulting file.

Super ARC offers a number of handy items for you to use.  First, it seems
to work with almost any DOS <there are some problems with TOPDOS and disk
swaps>, it allows disk swapping under most DOSs for those single drive
users out there, allows recovery to a -null- device to check the integrety
of an ARC file, with the screen off, you still get a status line that lets
you know that something is happening, and much more.

Bob has even put in support for SpartaDOS and DOS XL command line
execution of the programs.

Frankly, I see few, if any, problems with Super ARC.

Now, the best part!  Super ARC is ShareWare!  Both files are now available
online on GEnie for downloading.

Don't forget to send Bob a few $$$$ for all his hard work!  I personally
know that Bob has spent a lot of time on these programs.


                             SpartaDOS X ARC

Well, here it is!  The long awaited SpartaDOS X cartridge.  And to make a
good thing even better, it has a built in ARC program!

SDXARC is fast, easy to use, and reliable.  The command structure is
almost identical to the commands used in MS/DOS ARC by SEA.  This is
intentional and ICD has at least two notices in the SDX manual that the
-look and feel- of ARC has been licensed from SEA.

SDX has a number of options that are not available from other programs,
such as Freshen an ARC file, Move files to ARC and delete the old files,
Update ARC, Delete a file from within the ARC, Suppress all compression,
Suppress all notes and/or warning messages, and more.

The biggest use that I have found so far SDXARC is that, with its ability
to Freshen and Update an ARC, it is ideal for backing up my MIO RAM Disks.
I can give the command to ARC FNH and it takes off, only adding files
that have changed since I last did the backup. This is a real time-saver
for me!

                          So, Which ARC is Best?

What is the best ARC to use is a hard question to answer.  We now have a
number of good choices to pick from, but that can make life hard
sometimes!

Because of speed and errors, we can drop ARC/ARCX 1.2.  They simply can't
compete anymore.

AlfCrunch is an excellent program, but the lack of compatability is a
serious draw-back.  I think we will have to pass it by as well.  If you
have a bunch of ALF'd files on your disks, or if you SysOps have a bunch
of ALF files on the BBS, don't worry... Both Super ARC and SDXARC can
recover them, and recover them faster than AlfCrunch can to boot!

So, that leaves with Super ARC and SDXARC.  Which program you select will
really be dictated by what DOS you use.  Super ARC works with nearly
anything.  SDXARC is, of course, available and works only with SpartaDOS
X.

If you purchase the SpartaDOS X cart, why have another ARC program lying
about?  That just doesn't make sense.

But, if you are one of those people that just simply does not like
SpartaDOS, or you refuse to go out and buy the SDX cart, then the obvious
answer is Super ARC!

Both are excellent programs, easy to use, extremely fast, and very
reliable.

SDXARC was faster in recovering files in all but one case, but not
radically so.  When ARCing files, using the default compressing scan,
SDXARC again was faster, but only by 30 seconds or so.  <I just wonder
what the speed of SDXARC would be like if it didn't scan every file for
the best compaction type and just did Crunch....>

But, the time differences are trivial.  I for one don't have a lot of
things that I could do in the 2.8 seconds that SDXARC saves me.

So, I'm afraid that I can't be of much help for you.  If you have or get
the SDX cart, use SDXARC.  If you don't have the cart, use Super ARC.

My personal choice is SDXARC.  I like the -look and feel- of MS/DOS ARC,
and the SDX cart in general.  For hard disk owners, the ability to do the
ARC backup of the HD is almost indespensible.  It can, as I stated above,
also be of great use for the ICD MIO.

                              In Conclusion

Well, there you have it!  The last comparison/review that I will do for
Atari 8-bit ARC programs!  <at least until the next one!>

I hope that I have answered a few questions for you and given you a little
more information to use when selecting just what would be best for you and
your Atari 8-bit computer system.

I welcome any questions or comments that you may have.  I can be reached

                                 Credits

I would like to thank ICD, Inc. and Tom Harker for the oportunity to Beta
Test the SpartaDOS X cartridge and, in particular, the SDXARC program.
Looks great, Tom!  If *you* don't have SpartaDOS X yet, get it soon!

Also, my thanks to Bob Puff for letting me help with the testing of Super
ARC and Super Un-ARC.  You have really helped out the entire Atari
community, Bob!  Keep the great 8-bit programs coming!

Thanks to Jeff -Alfred- Williams for making us all get off dead center
with the ARC issue.  You have shown us that the First Atari is far from
dead and still has more than a few tricks left up its sleeve!

And lastly, thanks to Ralph Walden for starting this mess!  Without
Ralph's first effort at ARC for the Atari 8-bit, we would probably still
be using a boot-disk program for file compaction!
