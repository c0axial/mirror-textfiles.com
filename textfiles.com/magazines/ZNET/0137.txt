I was pleasently surprised with the many downloads of our first issue of 
STZMAG.  You can get the latest ST news and reviews by downloading STZMAG 
on CompuServe in the AtariArts forum, and on GEnie in the ST RT library.

With the publication of STZMAG, we can once again focus our attention on 
the 8 bit Atari.  Occassionally however, I will publish ST news here.  We 
shouldn't close our eyes to what is happening there.

Please update your ZMAG BBS Listing with the following changes:

Remove: S074-402  S.T.U.N.N.  (402) 466-5339

Add: Z106-814  SAGE BBS  (814) 833-4073

If you haven't responded to the ZMAG Survey yet, please do so soon.  
January 15th is the close.  I need all responses to complete the article.  
If you would like a copy of the survey, Please let me know.

The Turbo 8-16 project is getting closer to release.  Beta testers have 
been selected and reports should be coming in shortly on some type of 
release.  Stay tuned for details.

<*> DIAMOND UPDATE
##############################

 Press Release: Diamond OS SuperCart
 From: Alan Reeve/Reeve Software
 
Attention Atarians,
 
It has been a little over six months since our first press release for our
Diamond OS. Since then a lot has changed. We initially intended to ship
Diamond as a disk based product and it was to require at least 64K.
 
In August of 1988 we were contacted by Shelly Merrill of Merrill Ward &
Associates. Originally Diamond was going to compete against their product,
however, things fell apart with the developer and Shelly has been
assisting us with the marketing of Diamond.  We elected to unite as I felt
that his marketing knowledge could greatly boost the sales of our product,
and also create a resurgence of interest in the Atari computer. Shelly has
since moved on, formed USA Media, and has been very helpful in the
marketing of Diamond.
 
We shipped our disk based version of Diamond at the end of September. It
did much of what we said that it would, however we have received many
comments and criticisms regarding some areas. The most common complaint
was that the disk version functioned solely with Atari DOS 2.0.

Since the release of our disk based version of Diamond we have spent the
last ten weeks adding to it in order to create our much more powerful
cartridge version of Diamond. The cartridge version adds a lot of power
over our initial disk version:

* Supports two windows on the DeskTop.
* Supports Quit to Basic and direct return to the DeskTop.
* Supports most DOS types (Atari DOS 2.X, DOS XE, and SpartaDOS).
* Supports folders (subdirectories) and time/date stamping.
* Windows have sliders, and fullers that support full reversing.
* It's on cartridge and consumes minimal system memory to function.
* Much more...

Diamond is also completely programmable. We initially intended to have a
separate Programmer's Kit, however, along with the cartridge will come
complete documentation for programming the environment...it can even be
programmed in Atari Basic.

The disk version was also to have memory drivers and be followed up by
many external applications. Due to our continued work on creating such a
powerful environment we have delayed the applications until the cartridge
was completed. We will now be releasing the applications and they will
support the cartridge, however, Diamond Paint and Diamond Write will also
include versions that support the 64K disk version.

We are now pleased to announce that the cartridge version of Diamond is
100% done and will be shipping very soon as we produce the cartridges. It
will first be available to users that wish to upgrade from the 64K disk
version, and will then be available in stores nationwide. Please contact us
for more information:

The separate applications will be arriving shortly as Diamond acts as a
very solid foundation for external programs. The first Diamond based
program will be Diamond Paint. Diamond Write, News Station, Diamond
Publish and more will follow. The first three are almost complete.

Lastly, we'd like to thank those of you that have been supportive of our
efforts to revitalize the Atari community. I believe that Diamond is the
most powerful program written for any 8-bit computer and will lead the
Atari 8-bits into the 1990's.

We hope that you will join us and Diamond as your Atari 8-bit soars to new
heights.

<*> BILL OF RIGHTS
FOR SOFTWARE USERS
##############################
by David Browning  (Reprinted by request)

The following version of the Bill of Rights for Software Users was
presented for approval by the Capital PC User Group, Inc. Board of
Directors at the May 1985 board meeting, and has been distributed to the
press, industry and to legislators.  This bill is intended to set forth in
writing our needs as software users, and is not intended to take away the
right of software vendors to protect their products or compensation. It is
time we let the industry leaders know how we need to use their products
so they will know better how to interact with us.  I may be contacted on
this subject by  writing at WBS and Associates, Inc., 7620 Little River
Turnpike, Suite 600, Annandale, VA 22003.

1.  Right to Product Quality:

The user has the right to expect a software product to perform with a
level of quality consistent with industry specified or implied standards.

2.  Right of Functionality:

The user has the right to expect a software product to perform basic
functions common to the generic program type, with any exceptions or
caveats fully disclosed prior to purchase.

3.  Right of Continuous Service:

The user has the right to have on hand sufficient backup of program
packages and authorization devices to continue operations uninterrupted by
loss of or damage to the primary package or authorization device.

4.  Right to Program Support:

The user has the right of access to information from the software
manufacturer concerning known errors, fixes or temporary work arounds.
The user also has the right to reasonable updates to the released versions
for the correction of errors.

<*> YOUR 8-BIT COMES ALIVE
##############################
by Bill Pike PAC
review copy loaned by IB Computers

Here is a old fashioned hackers program.  The program retails for $24.95
(why couldn't they just say $25.00?) and comes with a disk of
demonstration programs including a library of basic and machine language
routines to implement the various sections.  The handbook is published by
Computer Spectrum Inc.

These sections include: Basic electronics, from how to read resistor
color codes, on to how to build power controllers and interfaces.  How to
build and use your own light pen.  How electronic switches work and how to
use them.  What serial data is and how to use it in programming and
interface it to the outside world, such as house lighting controllers etc.
How to extend the frequency range of your 8-bit computer. How to make your
computer into a music synthesizer.  How to control a lighting display with
an 8-bit, from Christmas tree lights to commercial displays. Other
subjects discussed include 120v power controllers, data encoders, data
decoders, event detectors and many others.

The book is written on the High School Graduate level and assumes that you
know how to solder and assemble breadboards.  Most of the basic
information on hardware is reviewed rather than instructed until you get
down to the meat of the book.  The book includes hardware construction as
well as programming.  I wouldn't recommend this for a child, but with help
a highschooler should be able to handle it without much problem.   

If you want to see what hacking really was, in the early days of
computing, rather than the piracy, phbreaking, and what hacking has since
been equated with.  This is the book for you.  The book also teaches how
to make a computer work in the real world not just how to get the highest
score on PACMAN.  I feel that in itself is enough to highly recommend the
purchase of this program.

January Update
--------------------------------
    - pinout of the Xformer cable
    - new Xformer utilities
    - other odds and ends

(C) 1989 Darek Mihocka
This file may be reprinted provided that it is kept in its entirety.

Last month, I made available the pinout of the Xformer serial cable,
which allows 8-bit disk drives to be connected directly to the ST so that
files can be moved back and forth between GEMDOS disks and Atari 8-bit
5 1/4- floppy disks.

There was an error in the pinout diagram of the DB-25 connector. I am
repeating some of the information, along with the corrected diagram.

To build the cable, you require one (1) DB-25 male connector, and one (1)
DB-13 3-foot Atari 8-bit serial cable (the black disk drive cable).

The pin numbering of the DB-13 is as follows. If you hold the connector so
that the row of 6 pins is at the top, and the other 7 pins are on the
bottom, the pins are numbered:

       ------------------------
      / 12  10   8   6   4   2 \

    ------------------------------

_____ 1. Cut one end off the cable, so that you have a 13 pin connector at
         one end and 13 bare wires at the other.

_____ 2. You now require a male DB-25 connector. These are the 25 pin
         connectors found at one end of your ST printer cable. Radio Shack
         sells them cheap.

The DB-25 cables have the pin numbers printed in very small print on the
actual connector. If you hold the connector with the 13 pin row on the
top and the 12 pin row on the bottom, the pins are numbered as follows:

   --------------------------------------------------------
    \ 13  12  11  10  09  08  07  06  05  04  03  02  01 / 
     \  25  24  23  22  21  20  19  18  17  16  15  14  /
      \------------------------------------------------/

The pins you need are 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 18. The following table shows
which colored wire gets soldered to which pin of the DB-25 connector.
Again, these are usual colors, but vary from cable to cable, so use an
ohm-meter to find the exact wires that correspond to pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
and 10.

    13 pin connector        color       DB-25       serial port function
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
            2                red          3          CLOCK OUT
            3                orange       11         DATA IN
            4                black        18         GROUND
            5                green        5          DATA OUT
            7                purple       7          COMMAND
            10               blue         1          +5 volts

Sometimes the black wire corresponds to pin 6 rather than pin 4. This is
okay since both pins 4 and 6 are GROUND in the Atari serial cables.

_____ 3. Once soldered, screw the DB-25 covers over the connector, and use
         the ohmmeter once again to test the connections. If you made any
         mistakes, you could fry your ST!

Recently I updated the Quick Transfer Utility and the File Xfer Program,
two utilities provided with the ST Xformer II emulator, which are used
in conjuction with the Xformer serial cable. Both programs are documented
in the ST Xformer User's Manual (October 1, 1988).

Both programs are available, ARCed, on the two ST Xformer support BBSs.
If you are not yet a user of these boards, the numbers are listed below:

ST Xformer supports boards (300/1200/2400 baud, 24 hrs):

    Golden Gate BBS,   Gatesville, Texas (817)-865-6352
    L.U.ST BBS, London, Ontario, Canada  (519)-432-5144

Online services support:

    Compuserve - ST XFORMER library in ATARIPRO   I am 73657,2714
    Delphi - ST databases in the ST Log SIG       I am DAREKM
    Genie - ST download library 14                I am DAREKM

As always, I can be reached by voice in case you have some problems. My
phone number is (519)-747-0386. I will be hard to track down over the next
few months, so most likely if you call you will get my answering machine.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you within a few days.

Remember that the ST Xformer emulator and the Xformer utilities are part
of a shareware package, and if you use the software, or build the Xformer
cable (which then requires that you use the software), you are expected to
register by sending in the $20 shareware fee. If you wish to buy an
assembled and tested Xformer serial cable, add $23 US or $28 Canadian.
Postage is included.

The mailing address for registering yourself or buying cables is:

  Darek Mihocka
  Box 2624, Station B
  Kitchener, Ontario  N2H 6N2
  CANADA

If possible, include a mailing label, but don't send a SASE.

Be on the lookout on February 1, 1989, for a major ST Xformer II
announcement. I will upload text files to Compuserve and GEnie on that
date with availability information of the new 130XE/320XE emulator. The
emulator is faster, supports the extra memory of the 130XE, and provides
considerably improved disk support. And, it will now work on the 520ST!
Full details, February 1.

Registered users: do NOT send in your disks for updating yet. They will
just sit around here until February. Wait until the last week of January,
then mail in your Xformer disk and $1 to cover return postage, and
sometime in February you will receive the updated Xformer software,
including the new versions of the File Xfer Program and the Quick Transfer
Utility.

% The ATARI ST and HAPPY COMPU conference is beginning

  Your moderator is Job 1  SYSOP-Ron

(SYSOP-Ron) Let me introduce our guest tonight Richard ADAMS, president of
HAPPY COMPUTER, makers of the HAPPY 810 famous in the 8-bit world and now
the DISCOVERY CARD for the ST.

Tonights CO is moderated questions, to get in line to speak, type /QUE and
when its your turn, i'll notify you.  Before we start the questions, Lets
ask Richard if he has any opening comments.

(Richard Adams) My name is Richard Adams.  I am the president of Happy
Computers, Inc..  I am the chief designer of the Discovery Cartridge
hardware and software.  I am able to answer all of your questions
regarding Happy Computers and the Discovery Cartridge.  I begin with a
brief description of the Discovery Cartridge product.

First, lets abbreviate Discovery Cartridge as DC.  The DC is a product for
the Atari ST and MEGA ST computers.  It consists of a hardware device, and
software utilities.  The hardware device contains a custom designed IC
chip, that allows the ST to read and write virtually any floppy disk
format.

The disk based software utilities provide access to this chip's features.
Various functions are supported by our current software. First, the user
can backup copy protected software, that cannot ordinarily be backed up.
Next, the unit allows converting Macintosh format disks into the Magic Sac
or Spectre format, for use with those MAC emulation products.  It also
permits conversion of Magic Sac or Spectre format disks back into
Macintosh format.

Finally, well there is no limit.  With the right software and drive, your
ST could read and write any disk format up to a maximum of about 800
thousand bits per second.  The custom chip in the DC eliminates the
limitations of the disk controller in the ST.  The DC surpasses the
capabilities of any other disk controller system for any other personal
computer, in its price range.

The standard unit which includes disk backup and Mac format transfer sells
for a suggested retail price of $249.95.  If you mention COMPUSERVE when
ordering, you can get special $30.00 discount, now through January 31,
1989. Here is our info:

  JOE QUINTERO <2>

(JOE QUINTERO) Dear Mr. Adams, I would like to know, what HArdware and
software do you have for the Atari 8-bit line and 1050 disk drive. Thank
you! ga

(Richard Adams) We have the 810 disk drive Enhancement, and the 1050 disk
drive Enhancement.  These are in limited production now, since the demand
has lessened.  The 1050 version allows backup of copy protected disks,
high speed reading and high speed write with verify, also true double
density and transfer of IBM PC files to and from Atari files, mostly for
text and data, not programs.  The current price for either Enhancement is
$149.95... ga

  David Hagood <6>

(David Hagood) Will the DC allow the reading/trasferring of files from IBM
1.2MB, Amiga, 8 bit Atari, etc? ga

(Richard Adams) Although the DC can read and write single, double, and
high density, each computer operating system has a different file
structure.  We cannot immediately support all possible file structures
with our software.  We are about to release a questionaire to our
customers, to get their help in prioritizing which computer's file
transfer we will support first.  Also, other authors may contribute to the
task.  I have started talks with several authors for this purpose. ga.

  JOE QUINTERO <2>

(JOE QUINTERO)  Dear Mr. Adams, do you need specific drives for the d/c??
(ect..Ibm...you would nned a IBM drive, Macintosh you would need a
Macintosh drive..ect.. ga

(Richard Adams) For MAC disk transfer, most standard Atari 3.5- drives
would work for High Density 5.25-, or 3.5- special mechanisms are needed.
For disk backup of ST copy protected disks, no special drive is needed.

  David Hagood <6>

(David Hagood) Did you ever release the tech manual on the 8 bit
enhancements? I asked 'bout this when you first mentioned it in one of
your newsletters, but never hear any more 'bout it (I own 2 1050
enchancments) ga

(Richard Adams) There wasn't enough interest to devote the time to this.
Perhaps when I have more time, I might decide to release some of the
product's source code, which includes all kinds of inline docs! ga

  JOE QUINTERO <2>

(JOE QUINTERO) Mr. Adams, can you tell us are there any neewsletters,
pamphlets, etc, that we can receive in the mail on how the HAPPY, INC. is
doing, new hardware and such? ga

(Richard Adams) Give us a call, or drop us a line. Whatever is current,
I'll be glad to send you.  Haven't had a general mailing since Nov 1987,
when the DC was first announced.  ga

% Moderator recognizes queue #14

(JOE QUINTERO) Mr. adams, I would like to know, do I have to send any S&H
costs when write you for your pamphlets?

(Richard Adams) Not usually, but a SASE, normal size, about 4 by 9 is
appreciated. ga

[ Well Mr. Luks tapped part of my question.  In it's place.. What is the
current situation between Happy and Gadgets??  ga ]


(Richard Adams) Just last November, some thoughtful persons brought to my
attention the fact that David Small had been making false statements about
me and my products.  These false statements included the following:

 1) Happy Computers illegally copied Data Pacific's Magic Sac design.
 2) Happy Computers shipped an unproven, unworking product.

The DC product was entirely of Happy Computers' own design.  No portion of
any other company's product was illegally copied.  All of the DCs I have
shipped have been fully tested and working units. Even the earliest
advance order units were and still are fully functional.

All of the features of the DC work correctly, including reliable and fast
reading and writing of MACINTOSH disks, and backup of copy protected
disks. This is precisely as my literature and documentation state.

David Small had been making statements of this nature on both Genie and
Compuserve, for some time.  I have found false statements like this going
back into the 2nd quarter of 1988.   Only recently was I made aware of
this.  I had to respond.  It does appear that David Small was the
originator of these less than truthful statements.

Since then, several persons have echoed what David Small said. Perhaps,
since David Small does have some credibility, in that he has written
articles and designed products for the ST computer, people were taking for
granted that his statements were truthful.

I am definitely considering legal action against David Small and others
that were involved in this campaign of defamation.  These lies definitely
hurt my credibility and sales. I am currently collecting evidence to
reflect the scope of the actual financial damages that David Small has
inflicted.

If you or any person you know, was influenced into not buying our
products, by these false statements, please contact me immediately.
(408) 779-3830  ga

(Ron Kovacs ZMAG) I see you were ready for this question. Perhaps David
Small would like to respond since I cannot speak on his behalf. ga

(SYSOP-Ron) David-- ga.

(Richard Adams) I would strongly recommend that such a discussion be in a
more proper place.  ga

(Gadgets Inc. (Dave)) All this legaltalk I'm sd *grin* I hardly know what
to say.  Ever s I'm sorry Richard feels that way.  It's unfortunate that
a couple of old 8-bit hands like us aren't getting along.  .ga.

(SYSOP-Ron) Lets keep things back to an informative nature....

(Richard Adams) Re-read my message, There is a better...

(SYSOP-Ron) and leave the legal troubles to the courtrooms. okay?

  John Nagy <12>

(John Nagy) Richard, I wonder when reading the variouys messages in the
bases here and on the other services. Why it is that programmers that work
to protect their efforts are being cast as somewhat villanous as compared
to your effort to thwart their protections.  Seems they have the right to
prevent backups without their direct consent? ga

(Richard Adams) Quite to the contrary, It is my understanding that the
copyright laws of the United States allow the user to make backups of
magnetic media.   When the software publisher disappears, as most do in
time, even for example,  my brother Scott Adams (Adventure International),
the users of our disk backup products will still be enjoying the software
products they legitimately paid for! ga

(John Nagy) My point is only that it seems that a programmer who wants to
prevent your or any product from copying his product is not per se a bad
guy. Thats the whole point of the protection in the first place. ga

(Richard Adams) With a disk backup device as thorough as the DC, copy
protection at least serves as a reminder that the authors should be
compensated for their hard work. ga
