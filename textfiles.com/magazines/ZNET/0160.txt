How many times have you been in the
middle of writing a BASIC program and
needed a directory listing?  One, maybe
two million?  You could put the file
away, go to DOS, list a directory, go
back to BASIC, reload the file, try to
remember why you left BASIC in the
first place, and eventually pick up
where you left off--even more confused
than before.  Another solution is to
type the following in immediate mode
(i.e. type this is one long line of
BASIC code, without a line number, and
it will execute immediately):

Figure 1:

CLR:DIM B$(20):O. #1,6,0,-D2:*.*-:FOR
I=1 TO 64:I. #1,B$:?
B$:I=I+64*(B$(2,2)>-/- AND
B$(2,2)<-:-):N. I:END

Now, any time you wish to see a disk
directory without leaving BASIC, or
affecting the program you have in
memory, simply type this line and press
RETURN, right?  That would be tedious.
Well, maybe we could make it a BASIC
line of code in our program.  Then any
time we need a disk directory, simply
list it to the screen, edit out the
line number, and smack RETURN.  Right?
Well, it isn't quite so simple.

A single logical line of BASIC code,
when entered, cannot be longer than 3
screen lines.  Notice that OPEN was
abbreviated as O., INPUT as I., and
NEXT as N., in figure 1 above.  Atari
BASIC's support of abbreviated
commands is rare among programming
languages--a very nice feature.  If you
were to enter this line of code with a
line number in front of it, then LIST
the line to display, you would see that
it comes out to be MORE THAN 3 screen
lines!  The line, WHEN INPUT FROM THE
KEYBOARD, must be 3 screen lines or
less.  Once the abbreviations are
expanded, it doesn't matter.  With the
line number 10000, the above line is
expanded by BASIC as follows:

Figure 2:

10000 CLR :DIM B$(20):OPEN #1,6,0,-D1:
*.*-:FOR I=1 TO 64:INPUT #1,B$:? B$:I=
I+64*(B$(2,2)>-/- AND B$(2,2)<-:-):NEX
T I:END

If we move the cursor up to the 1 in
10000 and press CONTROL-DELETE, it will
gobble up the 1, and move everything up
one position up to and including the
-X- in the NEXT statement.  However,
since the rest of the program
statement, -T I:END- is beyond the
third logical line, it doesn't get
moved up.  So, this isn't such a simple
fix either. However, there IS a better
way!

Take a look at the program listing
below, QUICKDIR.BAS.  This program
creates that cryptic looking segment of
code shown in figure 1, but on a DISK
file.  Any time you want a disk
directory, simply ENTER that file into
BASIC.  Atari BASIC will treat it as if
you had typed it from the keyboard,
and, viola, you have a directory
listing on the screen.  It won't
interfere with the BASIC program in
memory.  It does clear (CLR) any
DIMensioned strings, and potentially
will add two new variables to your
program, I and B$.  These can be
cleaned up by LISTing your program to
disk, using NEW, and then ENTERing it
again.  This is advisable occasionally
to clean out other variables that may
have sneaked into the VTOC (variable
table of contents) due to typographical
errors, while programming.  If you
didn't follow that last part, don't
worry--Quick DIR will have no adverse
affects on any of your BASIC programs.

When run, the program prompts you for a
drive number that you would like to
make a directory command file for.
Type a number 1 through 8, and press
RETURN.  Next, a prompt requests that
you get a disk in drive one ready and
press RETURN.  If you selected drive 2,
then file D1:DIR2 will be created.  The
contents of the file will be identical
to that displayed in figure 1.  Any
time you want to see a directory
listing for drive D2:, simply type:

E.-D:DIR2

and press RETURN, while in BASIC.  You
may run Quick DIR to create files DIR1
through DIR8 if you wish, which will
provide complete access to a directory
listing of any floppy disk, hard disk,
or RAMdisk you might use.

New Products!


We at I.C. are proud to announce the
availability of 2 NEW products.  They
both are available NOW.  If you have
any questions reguarding these, or any
of our other fine products, please
contact us.


Ramdrive + XL to XE

Finally, a low cost memory upgrade for
the Atari 800XL computer!  This upgrade
brings the total RAM to 128K, AND gives
you 100 percent compatibility with the
130XE, including the Extended Antic
Modes!  This allows you to run programs
like:  AtariWriter+, Basic XE,
Typesetter, Synfile+, and many others.
Or you can use the extra 64K of memory
to set-up a RAMdisk (a FAST simulated
disk drive) which is EXCELLENT for disk
maintenance.  Coming soon:  A 128K
upgrade for the 600XL (yes!).

Installation is required by an
experienced kit builder (requires some
soldering).

Price: $59.95 (+ S&H - see below)


Happy Doubler

Now, Happy 1050 Drive owners (and
clones) can program their drive to be
fully compatible with ICD's U.S.
Doubler!  This includes formatting
disks in the U.S. Sector Skew--making
reads and writes MUCH faster!  Also,
the software allows you to re-program
the drive numbers to be D1: thru D8:
without having to use the drive's
dip-switches.  This allows you to to
have up to 8 drives online!

Best of all, since the Happy Doubler is
completely disk based--no installation
is required!  And, unlike hardware
mods, you only have to buy the software
ONCE, no matter how many Happy 1050s
you have!

Price: $19.95 (+ S&H - see below)


U.S.:  Be sure to include $3.50
Shipping and Handling with your order.
COD is available (U.S. only) at $3.00
extra.

APO/FPO: Include $3.50 with order.

Canada/Mexico: Include $7.00 with
order.

ALL other countries: Include $10.00
with order.


For more information on our MANY other
fine products, you can download our
catalog from our Data Library (15) on
CompuServe.  Just BROwse for the
keyword -CATALOG-.

  The following was captured from
     the Repair Shop BBS (801-967-8738)
     and is an adjunct to a message
     posted on GEnie's 8-bit bulletin
     board:

-May 25, 1989 I bought the rights from
Supra Corp. to their 8-bit hard disk
drive interface and will be producing
them under the name of K-P Hard Disk
Interface.  I have opened a Base here
for information relating to them.  It
is on base 20 and the file sig for it
is 13. 

-I have the boards being made now--they
should have been finsihed today but due
to minor problems the company couldn't
get them done until Monday...

-There will be two places the interface
will be available from:  here and the
Stormbringer BBS in Bangor, Washington.
Other than these, the interface will not be available through any catalog or
distributer.

     I haven't been able to contact
     Supra to confirm this message, but
     have included it here in the hopes
     that some ZMagazine readers can
     help out.



  Roy Goldman, author of Daisy Dot
     series, says he continues to work
     on DDIII.  However, Roy asks for
     the loan of a Prowriter and Atari
     XMM801 printer.  These are,
     apparently, slightly different
     from the Epson-compatible
     standard, and Roy needs their loan
     to make sure Daisy Dot III will
     consistantly work with these
     printers.


  The exceptional piece of shareware
     terminal programming called
     BobTerm has had another version
     released.  BobTerm v1.10 fixes a
     problem or two, and incorporates
     several more features.  One of
     these is BobTerm's ability, like
     DeTerm, to load external modules
     which BobTerm uses in its
     function.  As of this writing, 
     two modules are included:  one for
     the XEP-80, and one for a command
     line processor when using
     SpartaDOS 3.2d or X.  I am extatic
     about the latter.  Those who know
     me know how I carry on about
     Amodem.  With this latest BobTerm
     version, my Amodem may have been
     overwhelmed.  Thanks, Mr. Puff,
     for all your efforts.
