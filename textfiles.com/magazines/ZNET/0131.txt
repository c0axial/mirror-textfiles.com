Editors Desk  by Ron Kovacs

I hope everyone enjoyed the holiday weekend and had a great Thanksgiving.  
News material related to Atari has been slow this week.  Earlier though, 
Atari released a note that they sold their 26th millionth video game 
system. Congrats....

The ST-Report -- ZMagazine split seems to have left many in query as to 
why??  Well, I felt the press release issued and reprinted here last week 
covered the facts.  If not, Please leave me some email and perhaps I can 
fill you in a bit better??

Once again for everyones knowledge:  ST-Report has been given to Ralph 
Mariano and it remains under his control and editorship.  WE ARE NOT 
aligned any longer. This means that the magazines are seperate and will 
not be linked in the future to ANY project or promotion.  This will become 
more apparent in a few weeks.   Please direct your commentaries about ST-
REPORT to Ralph Mariano and NOT ZMagazine.  Thank you for your 
cooperation.

Read December's Michigan Atari Magazine for some interesting information 
in the CHAOS User Group section in the BACK of the magazine.  Look for 
more comments should they be required in a future edition of ZMag.

Thanks to John Nagy for the nice article in Computer Shopper about ZMag. 
If you havent read it yet, purchase a copy.  Thanks again John!!

Atari Comdex Report  Part 2

Copyright 1988 Darlah J. Pine. All rights reserved.

Comdex Overview:
  A Wealth of Items to Report On
    By Darlah J. Pine and Sandy Wilson

(CONTINUED FROM LAST WEEK)
John Russel Innovations was displaying its JRI Genlock System for the ST.
Genlock allows you to use drawing and animated programs in low and medium
resolution mode to be combined with an outside video source such as a
camera, VCR or camcorder. You can install the printed circuit board inside
the Mega without any modifications or soldering. Genlock is hardware ONLY.
No software is required. Suggested tentative pricing is $500. Genlock is
currently awaiting FCC approval. A version for the 1040 and 520 ST is now
in development.

Neriki Computer Graphics from Australia was showing the Neriki Image
Master. This software allows the ST to interface with the Polaroid Palette
Image Recorder through the serial port. This combination enables a quick
transfer of the screen image to 35mm slide, print or overhead transparency
for graphic presentations. The software costs around $600, and the
Polaroid Palette lists for around $2,000.

Navarone was showing its new version of ST SCAN, which allows you to print
directly to the Atari SLM804 laser printer as if it were a copy machine.
The pictures may also be saved in DEGAS, IMG and Postscript format. The
quality of the laser prints was very impressive! Roger scanned a $100 bill
and it's a good thing it was not printed on a light green paper, otherwise
the Feds may be after him. Yes, the quality was that good.

Seymore-Radix was showing its image scanner with nothing new. 

The Wuztek Omnimon GS monitor was being used in high resolution and looked
quite good. This monitor is capable of displaying all resolutions using up
to 128 grey scales. There were also a number of applications being shown
using the Viking 2/91 monitor.

Antic was showing Cyberpaint as well as kicking off its new magazine,
Amiga Plus. There was a box for Cyber Sculpt on the Cyberpaint desk, but
it was not being shown when we were there. Cyber Sculpt allows you to add
an array of 3D modeling tools and capabilities to Cyber Studio. Suggested
Retail $89.95

Human Technology was displaying ZZ-Lazy Paint, which is a drawing program
from France. The result on your printer is one of extreme quality. It has
all the functions of other paint programs plus a lot more. It utilizes
powerful filtering functions to obtain 64 levels of shading. You can save
your formats in IMG, PI3 and Postscript. Also being displayed was ZZ-Rough,
which is a computer-assisted tool for artistic drawing. With ZZ-Rough, you
can create renderings, sketches and drawings. In addition, there is a
photocopier and a library of 3-dimensional objects that you can move and
turn in space. No suggested retail price was available.

Abacus was showing Beckercad. The program lets you draw with ease with
drop-down menus for beginners. The program has an powerful toolbox and
an integrated programming language oriented toward standard page
description languages such as page script. No suggested retail price was
available.

Abacus was also showing its Computer Viruses book that describes not only
what computer viruses are but how to protect yourself from them. This book
is written with the PC in mind, but it includes some sample listings in
Basic, machine language and Pascal. Though it comes at a time of hype and
we wonder if such a book will create more activity instead of halting such
a problem, it certainly might be worth looking into. The suggested price
is $18.95

Biolog Systems was showing MEDI-ST, a flexible package designed for
physicians in private practice, that has been available in France for two
years. It includes all the functions of a database, word-processor and
telecommunication program, and allows graphics to be included with an
individual patient record and/or follow-up instructions. A password system
allows this package to be shared by more than one physician.

In the educational area, First Byte was showing its full line of
educational wares for children. Computer Curriculum Corporation has a
system designed for schools that allows you to have a complete educational
package including math, reading, language skills and computer education.
The system is available for all ages. For more information, call (415)
494-8450.

Several games were demoed. Electronic Arts was showing Zany Golf while we
were there. Zany Golf is a miniature golf program with a few twists. It
has jumping hamburgers, holes that move and lasers and energy orbs. It
looks like this game will hold your interest. Also noted to be shown was
Advanced Dungeon and Dragons -- Heroes of the Lance. We didn't get a
chance to see this one, though. They did say that they were putting out
a commercial version of Monopoly. Hmm, no wonder why all those pd versions
of this game disappeared. We were told it was to be much better, though
we did not get a chance to view it. Suggested retail price for the above
programs was $39.95

Spectrum HoloByte was showing -Falcon,- the F-16 fighter simulation
program. It looks like it is quite interesting and appears to be keyboard
intensive. It is slated to be out at the end of November. No suggested
retail price noted. 

FTL's next entry in the Dungeon Master series, Chaos Strikes Back, will
hit the market around Christmas...hint disk will hit in about four weeks.
The preview disk to dealers will hit RSN. The hint disk will be able to
be loaded in when you get stuck at a certain point. The best part about it
is it senses where you are and will not give you any hints other than the
ones pertinent to where you are. 

MichTron and Microdeal from England were sharing a booth. Viva was shown
from their booth again as well as well as GFA Raytrace and HiSoft Basic.
Microdeal products looked exciting. We saw a program called Tale Spin, and
that is exactly what you can do. It allows you to create an adventure with
graphics that can be reused on up to 50 different pages but using the
minimum amount of memory. With the ability to import NEO/DEGAS pictures
and an internal art package, it makes for a very easy creator for a new
user as well as a computer-experienced one. You can also import St-Replay
sound files for sound effects when a new page is displayed or when you
click on a character. The best part about this is you can create
adventures and lock them so no one can change your adventure, or leave it
unlocked so those you share it with can add to and create a more intensive
adventure. This is a must-have for any adventure lover. Approximate price
was not set, but $89.95 was discussed. Jug was also mentioned, but we did
not get a chance to see it.

(Next week we will conclude this series on Comdex)

Compaction Extenders on CompuServe
by Don Lebow

QUESTION: how to deal with 'compacted' files downloaded from the Libraries?

Answer: They need to be 'decoded' before being used! Herewith, an
explanation....

UP FRONT: the reason for 'compacting' files is that it makes them easier
and faster to download. That's a given. It <does> take an 'extra step' to
make these files useable. But that step comes OFFLINE! And that's nice.

SOOOOO ... what kinds of 'compacted' files are here??

Easy enuff ... they can be identified by the filename extenders used. (An
extender is the three characters following the 'period' in filenames ...
you can find more info on the most common extenders used here in FILNAM.TXT
in Library 0.)

Normally, you'll run across these three that indicate a Compacted File.

 .DCM    .ARC    .ALF

Here's the basics on each...

DCM

Stands for DISKCOM. This program, by Bob Puff (a great friend to all
8-bitters who, trust me, you will learn to know and love) converts WHOLE
DISKS into files which can easily be downloaded and uploaded via modem.
The key here is 'DISK.' DISKCOM files faithfully echo the 'format', 'boot
sectors', etc. of their source. It does, indeed, put a disk into a file!

TO DECODE DCM files you need to have DISKCOM 3.2. You can find it in
Library 3 with the command: BRO DISCOM which will pull up both the ML
program and the documentation.

*SPECIAL NOTE*

There's been some confusion on the DiskCom menu. But if you reason out
what the program actually DOES, you'll see that the menu really does make
sense.

[A] converts the DISK you specify into one or more files (DISKCOMs it!
    this is the option you'll use when you're MAKING a DCM file.)

[B] converts files (mayhap, the DCM file you just downloaded?) back into
    a whole DISK! This is the option to use when you are extracting a DCM
    file.

A Hint here, on extraction, ALWAYS let the program FORMAT the destination
disk! It really does lead to fewer problems. See the DOCs for more info.

ARC

ARC is short for 'ARChive'. This is a Standard Format used on many
different brands of computers to 'compact' one or more files into a
package.

Note the difference: DCM is 'disk oriented' ... it encodes WHOLE DISKS
(and does so with minimum compaction .. the files really aren't that much
shorter.)

ARC is 'file oriented.' (And normally does a LOT of compaction. ARC files
will usually be a lot shorter than in their 'expanded' state.) Unless a
given application requires a specific disk format, DOS, sector layout,
etc., ARC is usually better for compacting files. Again, extracting ARC
files is made easy by Bob Puff (told ya!)

In Library 3: BRO UNARC2 and you'll find UNARC2.OBJ and UNARC2.DOC. The
.OBJ program lets you 'extract' ARC files to disk so you can run 'em.
<Do> get the DOC file (it's formatted for a printer dump.) It explains a
LOT of options available in this really nifty program.

ALF

The last, but by no means least, option is a variation on the ARC theme.
ALF 'compacts' individual files BUT, unlike ARC, it is '8-bit Specific.'

Meaning, ARC files created on, say, an ST can normally be 'un-arced' on
an 8-bit. ALF files are limited both ways to 8-bit computers. No bad
thing, unnerstan' ... but something to consider. Whatever, it's quick and
efficient!

The various ALF program files can also be found in Library 3:
BRO KEY:ALFCRUNCH 1.4  The decoder you want is ALFDZ.OBJ ... check out
also ALF14.DOC which explains the ins and outs (including use from the
SpartaDos command line!)

WOULD YOU BELIEVE ... ALF files are ALSO decoded quite nicely by UNARC2!
(by this time, I hope you're getting out your checkbook and SERIOUSLY
thinking about sending a check to The Redoubtable Puff in support of
Serious Shareware!)

(NB. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that SPARATDOS X <also>
contains an absolutely GREAT ARC program .. and it extracts ALF files too!
Who sez the 8-bits are 'orphaned!' .. grin)

That about covers it. If you have problems getting ANY file you download
to run, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO YELL TO THE SYSOPS! We really are here
to try and make things easier...

Atari 800XL Split Chroma Modification
by Charles D. Koontz

This easy modification to the 800XL provides a true chroma output to the
800XL monitor jack.  It allows the use of -split video- monitors for
sharper images and truer color.

This modification involves installation of one wire to the foil side of
the the 800XL main circuit board (motherboard).

The following warnings are necessary for my peace of mind and your safety.

Modification is installed at the risk of the user.  Any warranty on the
800XL will be invalidated.  The author assumes no responsibility for
damage done during, or by, the modification.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:

(1) Screwdriver - Phillips head
(1) Soldering iron & solder
(1) Wire cutters or knife

1.  Disconnect all power, TV, stick, paddle, drive, MIO, or other
    accessories from the 800XL.

2.  Turn the 800XL upside down on your work surface.

3.  Remove the six Phillips head screws securing the bottom of the 800XL
    to its top.

4.  Carefully holding top and bottom together, turn the unit upright.
    Position it to the left side of your work surface with the keyboard
    facing you normally.

5.  Loosen the top, lifting it slightly above the bottom.  Flip the top
    over to the right of your work surface without disturbing the Plastic
    ribbon cable connecting from the right side of the motherboard to the
    top/keyboard assembly.

6.  Grasp the sides of the ribbon cable and gently lift it free from the
    black connector on the motherboard.

7.  Set the top/keyboard assembly aside.

8.  Remove the two Phillips head screws which attach the motherboard to
    the plastic bottom shell.  They are located at the rear of the metal
    shield.

9.  Work a finger under the left forward edge of the motherboard and lift
    it slightly while pressing outward on the right side of the bottom
    shell near the joystick ports.  With a little jimmying, you should be
    able to work the motherboard free of the plastic bottom shell.

10. Set the bottom shell aside and position the motherboard upside down on
    your work surface.

11. Carefully note the positions of the ten Phillips head screws securing
    the top and bottom metal shields to the motherboard.  It is important
    to mark their positions with magic marker or small pieces of tape
    since one hole is used for another purpose.

12. After marking their positions on the bottom shield, remove the ten
    Phillips head screws holding the shields, expansion slot clips, and
    motherboard together.  REMEMBER - THOSE SHIELD EDGES ARE SHARP.

13. Remove the expansion slot clip, metal shields, and bottom insulating
    sheet from the motherboard.

14. Set the motherboard, component side up, on your work surface.  The
    joystick ports should be on the right; the metal R.F. module should
    be at the rear.

15. Locate transistor Q5.  It is the leftmost of three transistors in a
    row, about two inches in front of the metal R.F. module.

16. The left lead of Q5, viewed from the component side of the
    motherboard, is where the chroma signal is available.  Put a finger
    over Q5, turn the motherboard upside down, and locate the
    corresponding connection on the foil side.  Verify your choice by
    holding the motherboard in front of a stong lamp and viewing the
    connections with the shadow of Q5 visible through the motherboard.

17. Cut a piece of hookup wire to ten inches. Strip one end and solder it
    to the connector you identified in the last step (on the foil side of
    the board).  Again, make sure this connector corresponds to the left
    lead from Q5 when viewed from the component side of the board with the
    joystick ports to your right.

18. Route the free end of the hookup wire straight toward the edge of the
    motherboard occupied by the R.F. module.

19. About 1/2 inch from the edge of the motherboard, bend the hookup wire
    at a right angle toward the five board connections of the monitor jack.

20. The free end of the wire will connect to the monitor jack connector
    for pin 5.  Of the five circuit board connectors, it is the second
    nearest to the expansion slot.  It has no foil lead.  (The middle
    connector of the five also has no foil lead so be careful not to pick
    it.)

21. Cut off the excess length of hookup wire, strip the free end and
    solder it to the connector for pin 5 of the monitor jack.  Verify the
    pin by examining the monitor jack pin identifiers printed on the
    component side of the motherboard.

22. Reposition the top and bottom metal shields on the motherboard. Make
    sure the insulating sheet is placed between the motherboard and the
    bottom shield.  Check to make sure the new wire exits the bottom
    shield through the slight elevation in the shield edge near the R.F.
    module.

23. Slide the metal extender slot clip into place and fasten it and the
    two shields to the motherboard with two Phillips head screws.

24. Secure the shields to the motherboard with the remaining eight
    Phillips head screws.  These go in the holes you marked earlier (step
    11).

25. Retrieve the plastic bottom shell and position the motherboard
    assembly in it.  It's helpful to start the joystick ports into their
    holes first, then gently sliding the motherboard into place.  You may
    have to bend the plastic shell in the area of the power switch to get
    everything seated.

26. Once the motherboard is seated in the bottom shell, secure it with the
    two slim screws you removed earlier.  One goes near the power jack, the
    other goes near the peripheral (SIO port) connector.

27. Lay the top assembly to the right of the bottom assembly with the
    keyboard ribbon cable near its long black connector on the motherboard.
    Grasp the sides of the ribbon cable and gently insert it into the
    connector.

28. Fold the top/keyboard assembly back over the bottom/motherboard.
    Check to make sure the ribbon cable is not folded sharply or pinched
    between the top and bottom.

29. Holding top and bottom together, turn the 800XL upside down and
    replace the six Phillips head screws that hold it together.  Do not
    overtighten the screws.  They are anchored in plastic that strips
    easily.

30. You're done!!!  Find a monitor cable terminated with four phono plugs
    and you're in business.

Radio Shack has such a cable. (If its the same as mine, the plugs are:
BLACK  - audio,  RED    - luminance,  YELLOW - chrominance,   WHITE  -
composite video (unused) with a split video monitor like the Commodore
1702.))

On the chance your cable is wired differently, some experimenting will be
necessary to find the right hookup.  Plug the DIN connector end into the
800XL monitor jack.  Turn on the 800XL and run a disk or cartridge program
that uses sound and color.  (A nice AMS selection?)

a.  Find the audio plug by sequentially plugging each plug into your
    monitor's audio input jack.  When one plug yields the right sound,
    MARK IT!

b.  Find the luminance plug by sequentially  plugging the remaining three
    plugs into your monitor's COMPOSITE VIDEO jack (the one on the front
    of the Commodore 1702).  The jack may be marked simply -video-. You'll
    know you have the right plug when you get a good picture, but
    monochrome (black-and-white).  MARK THIS PLUG as the luminance or
    -luma- plug.

c.  Find the composite video plug by sequentially plugging the remaining
    two plugs into your monitor's COMPOSITE VIDEO jack.  When you get a
    fine color picture, that is NOT washed out, MARK THE PLUG.  This
    composite video plug is not used with split video monitors like the
    Commodore 1702.

d.  The remaining plug carries the chrominance signal.  When plugged into
    your monitor's COMPOSITE VIDEO jack, you should get either no picture
    or a very washed-out color image.  MARK THIS PLUG as the chrominance
    or -chroma- plug.

e.  Connect the audio, luma, and chroma plugs to the corresponding input
    jacks of your split video monitor.

f.  Why are you still reading?  The modification is done and your computer
    is correctly connected to a monitor.  Play DONKEY KONG.

Seriously, if you have trouble, leave electronic mail for me at:

HELP! or whatever happened to-?)
by Dave Holden

Atari General Information Conference

PERMISSION TO REPRINT GRANTED AND GREATLY APPRECIATED!

As we all are aware of (and complain about most of the time), a great deal
of truely worthy software has been -lost in the shuffle- over the years,
starting with the demise of the APX and continuing to the -great EA
(Electronic Arts) gobble-.  Some of this has been re-issued thanks to
ANTIC, THUNDER MOUNTAIN, MAIN STREET, and HI-TECH to name a few, but there
are many more titles which are -in limbo-.  It creates an interesting
dilemma-most are copyrighted and -pirating- is definitely illegal.  But
THEY CAN NOT BE PURCHASED!

Admittedly, some of the games and utility programs are out-dated, but
especially in the Educational field, there are many with on-going value.
Attempts to make contact with the authors or publishers of some of these
personally have been fruitless.  So this broad-based appeal for
information is being made in the hope that Atarians can recover part of
this eroding software base by attracting the author's attention to either
re-issue them or allow them to become part of the rapidly expanding
network of user group Public Domain Libraries.

The following list is in no way complete, and will hopefully be added to
as it is re-printed and passed around the country.  We complain and talk
about writing letters to obtain Atari versions of software currently
available for other computers- let's do what we can to preserve what was
already available!  If you know how to contact (or are!) any of these,
please contact your local user group about public domain release follow-
up, or the MAGIC group through:

Reprinted from THE SOURCERER'S APPRENTICE 6-88 MICHIGAN ATARI GENERAL
INFORMATION CONFERENCE FILE UPDATE 11/22/88 dave holden:

To date there have been no replies to the above article directed to MAGIC.
As the author does not have direct access to either Genie or Compuserve,
this file was U/L to local boards in the hope that it would be -passed
around- - possibly this has not happened.  ZMag readers may leave replies

What is DigiSpec?

DIGISPEC from TRIO Engineering, a 512-color conversion and display program
for the Computereyes video digitizer.

DIGISPEC is the first program for the Atari ST that makes it possible to
capture real-world images from the video camera or VCR in full color -
using all of ST's 512 colors in one picture.  

Why do you need all these colors?  To make your digitized pictures more
colorful, sure - but there's another even more important reason: shading.
Proper shading is what makes images look -real-, 3-dimensional - and it
requires A LOT of colors. Not 16, not even 512, but thousands and
thousands! That's why on top of 512 pure colors DIGISPEC has 2 dithering
options:  2-level and 4-level.  They bring the effective number of colors
to 3375 and 24389, respectively.  For those images where subtle shading
is essential (like full-screen human faces) dithering makes all the
difference between ridiculous and sublime.  Instead of wide color bands
and patches you have exquisitely smooth color transitions that make the
objects look just like on good quality color TV screen.

To use DIGISPEC you need the Computereyes color video digitizer (and
Computereyes system software) from Digital Vision, inc.

DIGISPEC displays the 512-color image on the screen, allows you to make
any necessary adjustments (color balance, brightness and contrast) and
then saves your picture to disk using SPECTRUM 512 file format. You can
view your pictures later with the slide show program SPSLIDE.PRG provided
on your DIGISPEC disk.  You can also use SPECTRUM 512 painting program
from TRIO Engineering (published by  Antic Publishing) to edit and resize
your images, create compositions with other digitized and hand-drawn
images, etc.  Like SPECTRUM 512 itself, DIGISPEC produces only low
resolution images (320x200). You can use it only with the color monitor
(or color TV).

How DIGISPEC works

Your DIGISPEC disk contains 2 versions of the program - one is a stand-
alone program (SPECCE.PRG) and another is a desk accessory (SPECCE.ACC).
You can use either one - the end result will be exactly the same. The desk
accessory version is faster and more convenient, but it can only be used
on ST's with 1 megabyte of memory (or more).  If you have 520 ST without
the memory upgrade you should use the .PRG version.

When you capture an image with the Computereyes digitizer it's stored in
memory in the form of raw video data.  This raw video data is what
DIGISPEC needs to produce the 512-color picture (obviously, you can't
restore 512 colors AFTER the image was converted to the usual 16-color
picture).  If your machine has enough memory for both DIGISPEC and
Computereyes program (so you can use DIGISPEC as a desk accessory) then
DIGISPEC can process freshly captured image and produce the 512-color
picture in just a few seconds.  If you don't have enough memory for both
programs you should first use the Computereyes program to capture the
image and save it on disk in the form of raw video data (not as a
NEOchrome or DEGAS picture!), quit the Computereyes program, then use the
.PRG version of DIGISPEC to load the raw data file back from disk and
convert it into 512-color picture.

Version 1.1 of DIGISPEC is available now by mail from Trio Engineering. To
place your order call 617-964-1673.

Release Notes for REVOLVER Version 1.1  11/23/88

A text file with common questions and answers has now been included
on this disk.

The ST has a software clock and a hardware clock.  The hardware clock is
not changed during switching or rolling in programs but the software clock
will lose accuracy during switching and when rolling in programs.  If you
prefer to have the clock reflect accurate time you should add REVTIME.PRG
to your AUTO folder.  This program will cause all accesses to the ST's
clock to be made from the hardware.

NOTE: The Set Time & Date function in REVOLVER set the hardware clock.

Partition copy is a new feature that copies the contents of one partition
to another one. To use it click -COPY- on the main menu, then select the
target partition.  An example of a good use for this feature would be if
you have partitions that are the same size, you only need to boot one of
them, and copy the others, making startup faster.

Revolver 1.0 intercepted system crashes 2 and 3 by displaying a message in
the upper left hand corner of the screen.  This display has been removed
in Version 1.1 so that a system crash is handled by the operating system
in the normal manner.

Revolver 1.0 could be fooled into not making a media change when switching
between single and double sided floppy disks.  Version 1.1 forces a media
change to occur whenever a partition is switched to, thus fixing the
problem.

Version 1.1 will not activate the Forty Folder Fix when used with the
Version 1.4 Operating System (since this problem is solved in 1.4).

Version 1.1 allows the user to turn off REVOLVER's sounds and visual slide
in effect (selectable in the Configuration Menu).

A folder rename has been added the the Disk Commands Menu. 

The file selector will now show folders when using a wild card pattern for
the file name.

REVOLVER dialogues may now be exited using either the left mouse click on
the EXIT button or by pressing the Return Key.

The Mouse Accelerator in version 1.0 conflicted with Word perfect and
several other programs that used their own mouse drivers.  This has been
fixed in version 1.1 thus allowing the use of such programs with REVOLVER.
However if problems occur simply de-install the mouse driver and reboot
without it.

The partition allocation block size has been decreased from 256K to 128K
thus allowing for a greater combination of partition sizes.  This is of
particular benefit to 1040 users.  Additionally, the allocation of
REVOLVER's overhead across partitions can be handled in two ways... EVEN
allocation will allocate the overhead equally across all partitions (this
was the way Version 1.0 did it), PERCENTAGE will allocate the overhead
based on the percentage of memory in each partition.  PERCENTAGE is
recommended if you wish to allocate a minimum size partition (1 block).

Version 1.1 will force partitions with less than 160K of memory to become
TOS only partitions.  You may run only small TOS applications in such a
partition but REVOLVER will be accessible through them.  This will allow
you to use REVOLVER with minimal overhead should you desire not to use the
GEM switching functions.

The mouse color has been changed so that it is easier to see on monochrome
systems.

The mouse driver has an added feature selectable in the Mouse Configuration
Dialogue that allows you to use the Right Mouse Button to simulate a Left
Mouse Double Click.

A boot manager has been added and can be turned on in the Configure
Dialogue.  It allows you to select auto programs and desk accessories as
each partition is booted.  Simply select ACC or AUTO on the lower left of
the dialogue then use the mouse to move your selections to the USE column
(if you want them) or the POOL column (if you wish to boot without them).
Pressing Return or clicking on Desktop will allow the boot process to
continue normally, clicking on the CLI will cause the booting partition to
boot only to TOS.

Normally REVOLVER can easily be called up using the ALT-LEFT SHIFT key
combination and switching to the next partition can be quickly accomplished
by pressing the CONTROL-ALT-LEFT SHIFT combination. Some programs will not
respond to these combinations unless you depress another key (such as the
space bar) while waiting for REVOLVER to acknowledge (the screen flash).
Some example programs that demonstrate this are DCOPY, DBMAN and GULAM.

Most programs that do not successfully work with REVOLVER are those that
place the keyboard into Joystick Monitor and/or Fire Button Monitor mode.
This includes many games.  You can often successfully rollout then rollin
such games from their title screen or menu screens.  Rolling them out from
the action screen will cause them to be fully restored when rolled back in
except that the Joystick Fire Button will not work. 

Programs that must boot directly from the master disk will not allow
REVOLVER to load (since REVOLVER is not on the master disk). This category
is also usually games.  

Programs that make major changes to the architecture of the operating
system (such as PCDITTO and MAGIC SAC) will remove REVOLVER and all of its
Partitions and should be run without REVOLVER loaded (Hold down the ALT-
LEFT SHIFT while booting to boot without REVOLVER).  

REVOLVER has several functions that can be called through the trap 13
handler.  They were designed to aid in integration of REVOLVER with
standard applications.  See REVBIND.C for examples.
