Xx Atari Beginners Sig Formed
Beginners SIG
-----------------------------------
This letter appeared in the most recent SCAT newsletter:           
We are new SCAT members and looking for help with our 800XL. 
Specifically, we would appreciate a SIG for Atari basic. Is eveyone too
busy with the ST? We refer to the Scat Newsletter of February 86 and 
an excellent article by Jim Roberts - -An 8 bit machine is only dead if
you kill it. And I think there is a lot of life left in it!-
At this time, Atari basic is killing us. Can anybody help?
Looking forward to a new SIG.
                The Hirshfelds
Dan and Eileen Hirschfeld have decided to do something about their
own letter, and will be heading up the beginners SIG at SCAT, which 
will include explorations of BASIC.
If you have any questions you would like answered as part of the SIG, 
direct messages to ZMAG at your favorite BBS, to the ZMAG message 
base at SCAT, or mail your questions to SCAT BEGINNERS SIG
             c/o The Hirschfelds
                 8702 N. Osceola
                 Niles IL 60648
These questions will be answered in special ZMAG issues, and used as a 
basis for setting the SIG agenda.....FIRE AWAY!

Xx ELECTRONIC ARTS PLANS TO RELEASE         8-BIT SOFTWARE
----------------------------------
   Electronic Arts software company president Trip Hawkins has written 
the last letter he will ever need to send to Antic Magazine.

   -The response of your readers to Antic editorials is growing,- wrote
Hawkins.  -We have received quite a few letters.-  Quite a few indeed. 
In a letter-writing campaign initiated over nine months ago with
a May, 1985 Antic editorial, not only Antic readers but the entire 
Atari community begged EA and other major software publishers to 
release more software for the 8-bit Atari computers.

   EA promises to release Adventure Construction Set, Heart of Africa, 
Mail Order Monsters, Marble Madness, Racing Destruction Set, 
Skyfox, Software Golden Oldies (Software Country), and Ultima IV 
(Origin Systems) for the Atari XL/XE 8-bit line of computers in 
1986.

   -We hope to see at retail the kind of response we have seen in 
our mailbox!- Hawkins says in conclusion.

Xx     BRODERBUND STILL GROWING
Broderbund Grows
----------------------------------
   The media broadly proclaimed that 1985 was a -dismal- year for 
the personal computer industry. Broderbund Software proved 
otherwise.  Bolstered by several top selling home productivity and 
educational packages, spearheaded by the phenomenonal bestseller, 
Print Shop, Broderbund doubled their sales to $20 million during 
1985.

   The December issue of Inc. magazine ranked Broderbund as the 
13th fastest-growing privately held compay in the United States. 
Microcomputer software distributors First Software and Softsel 
International also experienced rapid growth during 1985.
-----------------------------------
Xx     ATARI VS. THE WORLD
Atari Sued
-----------------------------------
   Atari Corp. has been sued again. This time for $55.2 million by an 
(unnamed) Japanese printer maker that claims Atari reneged on a contract to buy 500,000 printers.
-----------------------------------
Xx     ST DESKTOP PUBLISHING
DeskTop Publishing for ATARI
-----------------------------------
   Will the ST become a challenger to the Macintosh in the hot desktop
publishing market?  According to the United Kingdom Atari magazine, 
Page 6, a new software package, Fleet Street Editor, could change 
the face of society newsletters and small publications. This full 
design and layout system from Mirrorsoft is capable of driving a 
phototypesetter.  Expected UK debut is next month.  Meanwhile, 
stateside computer market analysts are calling desktop publishing -the
hula hoop of 1986.-
-----------------------------------
Xx     THE YUPPIE ST
Yuppie ST
-----------------------------------
   -Atari's now computer serious threat to the Macintosh.  Will the 
Amiga survive?-  You'll find this headline in Newsweek magazine, but 
it's not on a news story.  It's an advertisment.

   JS&A, a nationwide mail order marketer that pitches 
high-technology product. Their full-page ads claim -the ST will 
open up a major fight in the personal computer market,- and then
proceed to make a detailed comparison of the Macintosh to the 
ST.
 In a bold approach, the Northbrook, IL company invites 
owners to -put the ST next to your Mac or Amiga or even IBM,- after a 
small down payment, for a 30-day trial basis.  The components are 
sold separately. The ST computer and mouse for $299, disk drive 
$199, and monochrome monitor $199.
----------------------------------
Xx     NEW PRODUCTS
What's New
----------------------------------
   Epyx Software will release Winter Games, Rogue (originally a 
mainframe adventure game popular on college campuses) and Temple of 
Apshai Trilogy for the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga in March. 
   Paul Henckel, of Quickview Systems of Los Altos, CA and the 
author of -The Elements of Friendly Software Design,- (Warner Books, 
1985) has finished Zoomracks for the ST and IBM PC family.  It uses
-racks- rather than files to display information in a compact 
way onscreen.  Visualize this as a stack of time cards.  All of the 
cards are visible at once, with most of one card hidden behind the
next card, and only one or two lines  of information about each 
card visible.  Antic saw this one at our office and the review is 
underway.
----------------------------------
Xx     ATARIS HELP BILK THE BANK?
Atari Con
----------------------------------
   How did Richard Mamarella get $22 million in bank loans from a 
New Jersey bank?  According to a recent Wall Street Journal account,
Mamarella bribed a junior bank officer with $30,000 and two Atari 
sets,- to approve the fraudulent loans.  After pleading guilty to 
bank fraud and extortion charges, Mamarella is serving a nine-year 
prison term.
----------------------------------
Xx     AMIGA HAS TOS, TOO
AmigaTOS
----------------------------------
   What's in a name?  Metacomco, the British company that developed 
LISP and Metapascal for the ST also developed the operating system for 
the Amiga PC. The name of a multitasking OS at the core of the 
Amiga OS -- TRIPOS.
----------------------------------
Xx     DRI
Digitalis
----------------------------------
   Batteries Included may have a difficulty shipping Atari ST GEM 
applications by their original April deadline.  Like other 
programmers and developers, BI is  anxiously waiting for Digital 
Research of Monterey, CA to finish up the GEM 68K developer's kit. 
Industry analysts say delays in shipment of final versions of the 
kit is a serious problem for ST software developers. 
   Research and development seems to be continuing at the Monterey, 
CA-based developer of the GEM operating system for Atari and IBM.
DRI has placed ads in the Silicon Valley-Area San Jose Mercury News 
searching for graphics development Software Engineers.  -Become 
involved with the team responsible or developing this leading 
technology of the future -- right now!
Responsibilities include exploratory development and 
prototyping of new products, writing graphics applications in C
for the GEM environment, and implementation of new device 
drivers.-
-----------------------------------
Xx RUMOR HUMOR
HO HO HEH HEH
-----------------------------------
   This satirical product announcement by Albert Lew of 
ABACUS, was found recently in the San Francisco-area users group's 
newsletter:

   -Did you hear about the new $10 EPROM burner coming from Atari? 
Stick some 128K EPROMS in the blue  plastic slots, and pop into the 
toaster oven.  The docs  recommend that you think hard about what you
want burned,  (Commodore, Apple, 
and IBM are suggested topics) and pray.  If you are agnostic, you are
requested to  send more money to Atari until you get reasonable 
results.-
-----------------------------------
Xx     XANTH, NOT XEVIOUS
Oops
-----------------------------------
   XANTH Computer Systems,the Seattle, WA dealer inadvertently 
responsible for one of Atari Corp's most successful marketing ploys, 
the famous 8-bit Boink!, 130XE Fuji Boink! and the parrot and waterfall
ST public domain demo disks  -- was incorrectly identified as XEVIOUS 
Computer Systems in Antic Online's Consumer Electronic show coverage.
