Contents February '89 Antic Magazine

Just what you've all been waiting for -- this issue's theme is POWER
PROGRAMMING.  No, we're not talking supercomputers, we're talking about
pushing your 8-bit to its limits.

On top of that, this is an ALL 8-BIT ISSUE. No ST reviews or new products,
just unadulterated 8-bit info and programs. No longer will you be
needlessly tantalized by those ST games you can't get for your computer!
We've got a good line-up of 8-bit programs this month:

EQUIVALENCE, by new author Doug White, shows how to speed up your BASIC
programs.  The article includes some detailed info on floating point
variables, variable tables, and ways to make those little numbers jump
through hoops. Some interesting demos prove it works!

HARD-WIRED RAY TRACING, by Michael Bjorkman, is an 8-bit ray tracing
program.  You've seen Xanth Park's -Shiny Bubbles- on the ST, with its
floating, mirrored spheres? This does the same thing (well, almost) on
your 8-bit.  You generate a single sphere in a strange landscape derived
from your own MicroIllustrator screens.  Generate enough screens, changing
the sphere's size and location, and you have the potential for a great
page-flipping animation.

ERROR TRAPPING IN ATARI BASIC is by Heidi Brumbaugh, START Programs
Editor. That's right, you remember -- Heidi started out as a lowly clerk
here at Antic. She showed definite talents at Atari programming, and look
where it got her. She's now the harried disk editor over at START, and it
serves her right.

Anyway, Heidi wrote up a useful article on error trapping for Antic.  Not
only does it show you how to avoid errors by trapping them, it also gives
tips on using those errors to make your program work better and more
efficiently. This is definitely a useful subject for all those beginning
programmers out there.

Matthew Ratcliff reviews the STAR NX-1000 RAINBOW printer in this issue,
and he's pretty excited about this machine.  It may well be the world's
first affordable COLOR dot-matrix printer, and not only that, it turns out
some pretty decent graphics.  Matt's been inundating our offices with
sample printouts, and we're pretty impressed, too.

In our EDUCATION department this month we've got SPELLING FLASHCARDS, a
type-in program by Andy Barton.  It's a friendly quiz that lets you make
up your own list of spelling words.  The program flashes each word on the
screen, and then you get to try to spell it.  Great for dyslexics!

The GAME OF THE MONTH is ROULETTE, ATARI STYLE by Michael Pemberton.  Yet
another 8-bit type-in.  You won't lose your shirt to the 8-bit croupier,
but you will get to know the different kinds of bets.  If you've wanted
to test that winning system of yours in a safe environment, this is the
game for you!

This issue's DISK BONUS is MANDALA MOVIES by Mike McFarlane.  Want a
colorful display for a computer fair or shop?  This 8-bit kaleidoscope
construction set lets you make bright, exciting kaleidoscope patterns that
will run endlessly on your monitor.  Easy to learn and operate! Just a few
keystrokes and a nudge of the joystick set your patterns running.

Now, not everyone will want to kill hours of time trying to create the
most beautiful patterns possible, but personlly, I think it's the niftiest
program on the disk. So, it's particularly unfortunate that we've lost
touch with the author.  When last heard from, Mike McFarlane lived in
Springfield, Oregon.  If anyone knows where we can find him, please let us
know!

DEMON RACER by Jon Peterson is an ACTION!  type-in game. It's an auto race
against time on a devilish course, as a desperate commuter detours to the
Twilight Zone.

Our Feature Application this month is REAL-WORLD INTERFACE by John
Little. Mr.  Little was a man with a big problem -- he needed a way to
keep his greenhouse cool when the power went out.  (If you've ever been to
Austin, Texas in the summer, you'll understand how serious a problem he
had!) With some hardware modifications and a special valve, he set his 8-
bit up to run a sprinkler system for his orchids.  Get all the details in
this month's issue of Antic!

Wrapping up the issue, we have the usual New Products section, Tech Tips,
and the I/O Board.  In addition to the Star Rainbow review, 8-BIT PRODUCT
REVIEWS scheduled for this issue cover Celebrity Cookbook, and Cheat!

Atari Comdex Report Part 3

Copyright 1988 Darlah J. Pine. All rights reserved.

Comdex Overview:
  A Wealth of Items to Report On
    By Darlah J. Pine and Sandy Wilson

(Ed. This is Part 3 of 3. Continued from Issues #132,133)

GEnie was promoting its product with a full staff including Neil Harris.

QMI was showing ST Professional. It was noted that it will be more active
online now that the mad rush has partially passed. Coming real soon from
QMI is Disk Librarian. This product allows you to keep track of your
software and data files with an easy-to-use Gem program. Disk Librarian
allows you to sort, search and add comments to your database of files. The
number of entries is limited only by the memory in your computer. Lets
hope we see this sooner than real soon now. 

Intersect was showing Masterlink. Masterlink contains all the features of
Interlink plus multiple buffers with buffer reformat, tabs, word wrap and
search/replace. It has an advanced script language, which helps you to
develop your own scripts. You will be able to execute your scripts in the
background. A built-in answer mode gives you complete remote control.
Masterlink will be available in the first quarter of 1989 with an upgrade
policy available for registered users of Interlink. Suggested retail
prices is $59.95. This looks like one we want to see as soon as it ships.

Nite Lite Systems was demonstrating its the Lantech RS232 local area
network. With this system you can control up to seven nodes, which can be
computers, printers, terminals or modems. The Lantech Lan requires one meg
of internal RAM to run. Suggested retail price is $799.

Atari continues to do well in the music world. Hybrid Arts, Dr. T and
Midisoft were there showing their current product lines, and Sonus was
showing the new version of its scoring and sequencing package, Superscore
1.3. They have added a number of extra editing features as well as now
allowing music to be entered using the mouse.

Passport Designs was demoing Master Tracks Jr and Master Tracks Pro. These
programs retail for $129.95 and $349.95 respectively. The major difference
between the two versions is the addition of a graphic step editor, which
greatly enhances editing capabilities. The latest version of Master Tracks
Pro (version 2.5) should be available in about a week. SMPTE capabilities
will be available with version 3.0, but no release date for that version
was mentioned.

Legend Software Systems from Canada was showing its sequencing program,
The Final Cut. This program is very user friendly. It utilizes animated
tape reels and standard tape-recorder-type controls to facilitate easy
input from the synthesizer. It also has a good variety of editing tools
for everything from manipulating any section of your song to MIDI event
editing and special effects. The Final Cut lists at $89.95 and is
currently available at Federated stores.

DLR (Digital Laboratory Research) was showing AMADEUS ST. This is a
computer-assisted music learning program that is currently available in
France. The program is designed for all skill levels, from beginner to
professional, and includes instruction in music reading, theory and
harmony. Also included are a couple of games, and the ability to score
practice sessions to determine progress. It's current price is $245. 

ICD was showing its Fast Tape Backup. Need we say we all need this?? Fast
Tape Backup allows you to recover individual files on restore under TOS or
MS-DOS partitions. Will the Spectre/Magic Sac users be left out?? An Image
backup mode is also supported on these partitions. Along with another 50
meg hard drive, this too will be on our wish list.

Astra was showing its full line of products with its new cases. Astra has
one of the best hard drives on the market along with ICD.

Upgrade Editions had its product, Twist. Twist allows you to load
several applications in the ST memory (up to 14 on the Mega 4) and use
them without ever having to reload or save files. Twist is sold in the
U.K. by HiSoft. With MichTron picking up their HiSoft's basic, maybe this
will be available through MichTron as well.

ViewTouch was showing its touch-screen computer system, known mostly for
its restaurant POS computer system. One can order food and drinks by
touching the screen without having to wait for a waiter or waitress.
Technology comes to restaurants. Lets see how far this concept spreads.

Visi-Comp Systems was one of the first professional vertical market
applications for the ST. It is a complete professional optometric office
management system.

IBP was one of our favorite stops in the Gold Room. This company from
Hannover has great possibilities. It was showing the 190ST. The 190ST
allows you to design a system for different industrial applications, such
as a concrete-mixing plant, but different ideas come to our mind, like a
more portable computer?? The central unit of the system is equipped with
a CPU MC68000 and can be optionally extended by a mathematic co-processor
and by the blitter. All sockets are existing. With up to 2 Mbyte of RAM
and modular add-ons, the system is set up for quite a few ideas that one
may have. We were told that all you need to do is let the people at IBP
know what you need your system to do, and they can do it. The graphic
resolution of the monitor shown was 640x400 in high res with color being
320x200 in low res and medium being 640x200. We were told that the high
picture repetition frequency, noninterlaced with 71 Hz in the monochrome
mode, results in a absolutely flicker-free picture. The system is equipped
with interfaces all accessible on the front panel, including a centronics
printer connection, buffered DMA interface with a transmission rate of
10MBit a second, keyboard with V24 levels and ST records, midi-in/midi-
out/midi-thru with 126k baud option and a RS232 interface. This system is
Atari ST hardware and software compatible.

On the business end, Logical Design Works was showing LDW Power, its
spreadsheet for the Atari ST.

Precision Software was showing Superbase 3.0, which is a major upgrade
to Superbase professional. Among its new features, this version comes with
telecommunications capabilities, more powerful forms editor and a cross-
file file validation and lockup. The telecommunications area supports
Xmodem, Xmodem CRC and WXYmodem. Suggested retail price is $349.95. These
folks had a strong interest in getting online with GEnie. Maybe we will
see them soon.

Regent Software was showing its latest version of Regent Base II as well
as a keyboard stiffening springs kit for the 1040 and 520ST to allow you
to have a stiffer keyboard. It was noted that this may increase typing
speed. They were also showing SQL Database Add-On, their program that
brings SQL database capabilities to GFA BASIC.

There were three word processors being shown. Neocept was there with its
latest upgrade for WordUp and TurboJet, which is a GDOS driver for the HP
DeskJet. WordPerfect was showing the current version of its word
processor. There is also a new word processor from Blue Chip due out in
January. It has graphic capabilities and supports GDOS output. Suggested
retail price is about $100.

Nice and Software presented a cash-register inventory-control program for
the ST called Cricit. It not only has complete cash-register functions but
allows you to do everything from daily/period/yearly reporting to
customized receipts, coupons, inventory and reporting. It seems to be
quite user friendly. There are so many features, we just do not have room
to mention them all.

Datafree Industries was presenting an inexpensive order entry/inventory
and receivables program. These two programs are quite sufficient for the
small-business owner. Suggested retail price for each is $79.95

Turning Point Software was showing Fast Forward Video Systems, which is
a networking video-store management system. It has all the features
necessary to run a video store. 

As you can see, there was definitely a tremendous number of items being
displayed at the show. We are sure we may have missed some, but with a
lack of sleep and many hours compiling this article in alternating shifts,
you must forgive us. Was Comdex worth it?? The answer is a definite YES.
Watch for more detailed reports on specific items in the GEnie bulletin
board as well as future articles in ST Profile.

DataQue Update

From:   DataQue Software
        Post Office Box 134
        Ontario, Ohio

This File will serve as an application and information source for those
people who are concidering purchasing a beta test unit of the Turbo-816
and Turbo-OS Set.

Anyone who would like to be on the beta-test team, and receives a beta
unit must fill out this form and mail it to DataQue Software at the above
address.  Orders will be accepted by either COD, Personal Check or
Cashier's check.  Since there are a limited number of beta units
available, all orders will be held until I have all the units through the
primary testing, and ready to ship.  At that time if orders exceed the
number of available units, We will sort orders by the information provided
on the form.

What you will get in the beta test package is:

1) a Turbo-816-XB adapeter board.  This is for the XL/XE units only.
2) A 6- CPU extension cable.
3) A preliminary Turbo-Install manual.
4) A preliminary Turbo-User Guide.
5) A suggested testing procedure format Guide.

The main purpose for theout-of-house beta testing is the wide range of
hardware, and software which would be prohibitive, and in many cases
impossible for DataQue Software to purchase.  There are several guidelines
that have to be agreed to before A beta unit can be released, and these
are also listed in the application form.

It is expected that the beta test units will be through burn-in sometime
in the first or second week of December.  There are several options and

Subject: Re: LAN CARDS?

We just received the first 8 prototype boards of our TAXI controller board.
TAXI stands for The Atari eXtended Interface. The TAXI board will plug into
the Mega's expansion slot, or be driven through the Atari ACSI interface.
Some of the features are:

1 Full Ethernet interface (thin is builtin, thick requires a transceiver box)
1 Full (true) SCSI interface independent of the Atari ACSI interface.
8 Full duplex serial lines (RS232-C compatible)
2 Centronics/parallel printer interface
1 MC68000 processor (when used as standalone configuration).
128K dual ported DRAM + 64/128K EPROM

This board can be incrementally configured as an Ethernet controller, 2-8
channels serial cross point switch; with or without parallel or SCSI
interface.

NOTE:  The CBL-35DR should work with any industry standard IBM 3.5- drive
(360K or 720K) that has a 34 pin double header connector. The CBL-IBDR
connects to standard 5 1/4- drives (360K 40trk or 720K 80trk) with a 34
contact edge connector. Getting a 5 1/4- drive to work properly with an ST
may require finding and cutting out the pull up resistor in the drive
(see Antic Nov 85). The default seekrate on the ST is 3ms and many 5 1/4-
drives require a 6ms seekrate, so you may need a program such as SIXMS.PRG
found in the ST SIG on GEnie or Compuserve. You may also want FORMAT40.TOS
if using a 40 track 5 1/4- drive. On either size drive you will need a
proper power supply and also may have to set the drive select switch.
Putting your own drive together can save you MONEY, but make sure you know
what you are doing, or have someone help you who does. Help your fellow
Atarian's and me by uploading this file to your local BBS.


New Operating System
====================

MINIX is a new operating system that is system call compatible with V7
UNIX. Unlike real UNIX, it is available with all the source code, both the
kernel and all the utilities.  The purpose of this message is to announce
its availability on the 68000 CPU, specifically the Atari-ST.  However,
since it should not be too hard to port it to other 68000-based computers
(e.g., Amiga, Macintosh), this message is being crossposted to a number of
newsgroups. This will be the only announcement outside comp.os.minix.

When MINIX is run on the Atari ST (or MegaST) it replaces the native
operating system (TOS) and turns the computer into a normal UNIX machine.
MINIX has been running on the IBM PC, XT, AT, and many clones, including
386s for almost two years.  The IBM version is in widespread use all over
the world. The original (IBM) version was written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.
The Atari port was done by Johan Stevenson and Jost Muller.  MINIX does
not contain even a single line of AT&T code.  Thus both the operating
system and the utilities are all brand new code.

MINIX FEATURES:
  - System call compatible with V7 UNIX (except for a few very minor calls)
  - Kernighan and Ritchie compatible C compiler is included
  - Shell that is functionally identical to the Bourne shell is included
  - Full multiprogramming (fork+exec; background jobs in shell:  cc
  file.c & )
  - Full screen editor inspired by emacs (modeless, autoinsert, etc.)
  included
  - Ability to read and write TOS disks
  - Over 90 popular utilities provided (cat, grep, ls, make, mount, sort,
  etc.)
  - Over 100 library procedures provided (atoi, fork, malloc, stdio, etc.)
  - Works with floppy-only systems or with hard disk systems
  - Full operating system source code (in C) is included
  - Source code for all the utilities (except C compiler) is included

The Atari disks come with a little booklet telling how to boot the system
and how it differs from MINIX-PC (IBM version).  Effectively it is a diff
listing between MINIX-ST and MINIX-PC.  It makes no attempt to repeat the
500 or so pages on MINIX from the book or manual.

AVAILABILITY

MINIX is something of an intermediate form between AT&T UNIX and GNU.
Unlike GNU, MINIX is not public domain.  It is copyrighted by Prentice-Hall
and is being sold by them.  The price for the Atari disks in the U.S. is $80
+ shipping (somewhat higher abroad)  and includes all the source code.  On
the other hand, unlike AT&T UNIX, the source code is readily available, and
may be copied for bona fide educational and research use.  For example, a
professor teaching a course on operating systems could legally buy the disks
and then make copies for all his students.  A very limited amount of private
copying (say, no more than 3 copies per original) for personal friends is
ok.  If this gets out of hand, and Prentice-Hall decides that not enough have
been sold, they will just drop the Atari and have future versions be for the
IBM only. It is the intention that future versions be compatible with POSIX.

In the U.S. you can order the software and books from most bookstores or
directly from Prentice-Hall in NJ.  The ISBN number for the Atari software
is 0-13-584392-8.  Prentice-Hall's phone number is (201) 767-5937.


PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT
====================

TWEETY BOARD from Practical Solutions, Inc.

Stereo sound for the Atari ST is here!  Tweety Board provides true stereo
output that will blow you away!  Now you can play all your favorite games
and hear a whole new sound dimension with true-to-life effects.  Music
programs sparkle with a vividness never before realized.

The ST computers already have three channels of sound supported in their
hardware.  Atari combined the three together, resulting in one monophonic
channel, to make it compatible with the monitor's sound.  That's fine for
monitors but hardly impressive when listened to with a stereo system.

Tweety Board solves the problem with it's small circuit board specially
designed to access those hidden channels.  It works in parallel with the
ST's existing sound circuitry making it completely compatible with all ST
software.  You can also program your own effects or music!  The sound from
your monitor remains untouched and still functions in it's normal use. 
Simply plug Tweety Board inside your machine and the three independent RCA
jacks are ready to hook up to your three amplified speakers.  An adapter
cable is provided for hookup to a standard two-channel sound system.

No matter which way you connect it, you've never heard such vibrant 3-D or
crystal clear stereo sound from your ST.  No buzz or noise and an easy,
solderless installation - what more could you ask for?

Tweety Board will be available in the 1st week of December with a retail
price of only $59.95.

Transformer Update

ST Xformer BBS Support and Update Info for the Atari XL/XE emulator
-------------------------------------------------------------------
by Darek Mihocka  11/15/88

For the last 4 months, ST Xformer II (versions 2.0 thru 2.3) has been
available for download on Compuserve, Delphi, and Genie. This has proved
to be an effective distribution method, allowing me to put up new versions
once a month, and also provide online support to Xformer users. This
online support benefits the users, and has also benefited me, allowing
me to hear of bugs and suggestions. I compared my latest development
version of Xformer 2.4 to the version 2.1 which is up on the online
services, and can see quite an improvement in compatibility. Several major
titles, including some popular video games, which do not run under 2.1
do run under 2.4, and I still plan to spend about a month on 2.4 before
releasing it.

As nice as this may seem, this online support costs me and you money. My
monthly bill for Compuserve, Genie, and Delphi is about $250, which is
barely offset by the registration fees of those users who have been honest
enough to send in the $20. And from the user's point of view, paying $10/
hour or more to use these services becomes prohibitive if you try to
download every Xformer update and the megabytes of 8-bit software that I
have uploaded for use with Xformer, not to mention the many more megabytes
of 8-bit software regularly available. Although Genie is cheap at $5/hr,
I have to call it long distance and only get 1200 baud access, and
although Compuserve and Delphi have local numbers, their 2400 baud file
transfer speed is much slower.

Since September I have been planning to set up Xformer BBSs, which would
provide a cheaper method of support, both for me and the users. After
getting nothing but bombs from STadel 3 BBS software, and after not
getting some badly needed phone support from QMI for the BBS I half
finished in ST Talk Pro, I started looking around for existing BBSs which
could give me space for Xformer support. I have several BBSs ready to
provide the support, but for now, I'm only going to give out one number,
and see how things go.

The L.U.ST BBS in London, Ontario is a 300/1200/2400 baud 24 hour BBS
which is giving me 20 meg of space for Xformer files. I already have over
30 meg of p/d 8-bit software, so there will be no lack of Xformer-ready
.SD and .DD files. It is in the heart of southern Ontario, so it is a
cheap long-distance call from anywhere in the Great Lakes states, like
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York State. At 2400 baud, an ARCed
.SD file only takes about 5 minutes to download, which is quicker and
cheaper than calling Genie at 1200 baud.

By the way, L.U.ST (London Users of STs) produces of one the highest
quality newsletters around. If you belong to a user group, consider
exchanging newsletters with L.U.ST.

This BBS will start the Xformer support this weekend (Nov. 19). Since it
is in my area, I will call frequently to provide support. Registered users
of Xformer will also have access to other downloads, such as Xformer 2.4
and later, version 2.5 (the 130XE emulator). Xformer 2.4 will _NOT_ be
uploaded to the pay services but will be available to new registered users
and as a free update to current registered users.

Of course I am not dropping support of the pay services, just limiting it
slightly. If you do subscribe to Compuserve, all the latest available
Xformer related files can be found in the ST XFORMER download library in
the Atari ST Productivity SIG. To enter it, type -GO ATARIPRO-. If you
subscribe to Genie, type -M 476- to enter the Atari ST download section,
select category 14 (Product Support) and do a file list back until about
July. Look for files uploaded by me (DAREKM). On Delphi, enter the ST Log
databases, and scan through the Recent Arrivals section for the latest
files, and the other sections for older files. Type -SEA XFORMER- to do
the search. I did at first provide support on BIX, but stopped after I
calculated my billing rate to be about $30 or $40/hr.

If you are a registered user who has contributed $20 or more in shareware
fees, you can get the latest Xformer files from me by either calling the
L.U.ST BBS or simply mailing in your Xformer disk and I will mail it back
to you with the new files. The current latest files are: ST Xformer
version 2.21 and 2.31, FXP 1.1, QTU 1.1, and there is a new boot disk
effective Nov. 6th. Version 2.21 should only be used for the Apple and C64
emulation, since version 2.31 has some nice improvements:

- smaller size, uses less memory
- faster text and graphics scrolling
- marginal overall speed increase (trust me, you won't notice it)
- support for 1200XL function keys and the Help key
- faster 800XL ROM/RAM swapping
- elimination of virtual joysticks 3 and 4 to match XL/XE design
- now runs the G.O.E. demo and some more versions of SpartaDOS
- more accurate serial port emulation (requires the disk drive cable)
    which allows you to connect any self-powered 8-bit peripheral, e.g.
    the 850 interface and the various Atari printers and plotters.

ST Xformer source code is available on the pay services and on the BBS,
and is described fully in the latest ST LOG #26. It is helpful to check ST
LOG #17 and #18 as well, since they contain my first docs of the original
Xformer 1.1 source code.

L.U.ST BBS - (519)-432-5144  300/1200/2400 baud  24hrs.
U.S. BBSs coming soon.

Compuserve - ST XFORMER library in ATARIPRO   I am 73657,2714
Delphi - ST databases in the ST Log SIG       I am DAREKM
Genie - ST download library 14                I am DAREKM
Xformer support (voice): (519)-747-0386, 24hrs, me or a machine.

I now have a permanent answering machine set up, so if anyone has any
questions or things they'd like to talk about, give me a call, and if I'm
not home, leave a message and I'll most like phone you back within a day.
Leave your name, area code and phone number, city or time zone, and a
convenient time when you can be reached. If you have questions, leave them
on the tape too so that I can answer them when I phone you back. The
number is listed above, and I can usually be reached in the late afternoon
(eastern time), or around midnight.

I will _NOT_ answer questions regarding pirated software or release dates
of Xformer 2.4, 2.5, or 3.0. Announcements will be made on the support
BBSs and online services when they are available. I trust that if you are
using -cracked- files of disks and cartridges that you do own the
originals. If you have an 8-bit disk drive and are using it with Xformer,
there is no need to crack most software. The serial cable to connect the
8-bit drive to the ST is available from me for $23 US.

Hope to see everyone calling the BBS this weekend. Leave a message to the
sysop and let him know you are an Xformer user. If you don't yet have the
Xformer files, you will be able to download them, but not all the files
that the registered users have access to. When you register you will
receive the printed manual and latest software on an 800K disk. Add $2 if
you'd rather have 2 400K disks, i.e. you only have a single sided disk
drive. Having at least a megabyte of memory is almost a must. The 8-bit
disk drive cable is only available to people who register.

Xformer is quickly reaching the level of Atari XL/XE support that emulators
like the Magic Sac and PC Ditto provide of their respective machines, but
like those other emulators, it has taken a lot of time and effort. Since 
this program is shareware, my income from it relies solely on the shareware
registrations of users. At $20, it's cheap, and you will get the free
updates and support through 1988 and 1989. Some time in 1989 I expect the
program to be at an advanced enough stage to not require any more updates.
But don't wait until then to enjoy it!
