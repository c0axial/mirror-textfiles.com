Xx  EDITOR'S NOTE
____________________________________
This is our last regular edition of ZMAG for 1986. We hope you've enjoyed 
reading it throughout the year and look forward to your continued support 
in 1987.

Our -Special Zmag Systems- issue is in the works now and will close out 
1986 with a listing of the network's BBS's. This issue will contain  
information on each of the Zmag boards. It's our way of saying thanks to 
those systems that have supported us this year. Look for this edition on or 
about December 29th.

The next regular issue of Zmag will be published January 5, 1987. Zmag goes 
to Monday publication in the  new year, so watch for it each week.

In the December 6th edition of Zmag we ran a column devoted to gamehints 
for several ST games. Unfortunately, the person that sent us these tips 
neglected to attribute them to an article appearing in Family Computing 
magazine. We regret this oversight and wish to give credit to Family 
Computing for these gamehints. In the future, when submitting articles to 
Zmag, please advise us if your submissions are from sources other than your 
own. Thanks.

Finally, the Zmag staff extends Season's Greetings to all our readers as we 
wish you Happy Holidays and a healthy and prosperous New Year!

THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS
======================
ATARI CORP. reported results of operations for the 3 months and 9 months 
ending Sept. 30, 1986. Sales for the quarter were $59.9 million versus 
$28.9 million for the prior year--a 107% increase. Net income for the 
quarter was $9.2 million.

Sales for the 9 month period ending Sept. 30 were $165.5 mil versus $76.6 
million for the same period in 1985--a 116% increase.

Sam Tramiel, President of ATARI CORP., stated -consumer acceptance and 
retail takeaway continues extremely strong.  Demand for the Atari video 
games and the 16/32 bit ST computers exceeded our expectations.-

He also said, regarding the successful initial public offering completed 
during November 1986, -ATARI CORP. is now aggressively pursuing its 
leadership role in the personal computer industry from a position of 
strength, that is, we are virtually debt-free and have a solid equity base 
on which to build the company's future.-

SOFTWARE BLUES FOR 8-BITTERS
============================

 Help needed from 8-bitters by Dave Pettit

Ever since I heard about programs to create a mini-newspaper with an 8-bit 
computer I have been searching for one for my Atari 800.  So far I have 
only found one program for other computers and one from Xlent Software that 
is apparently hard to use.

The first program is 'The Newsroom' by Springboard Software, Inc.  Their 
program allows the user to enter their own text, choose from several fonts 
and several graphics, and merge it all together to form a fancy 8 1/2 by 11 
newspaper.  This copy could be printed several times on your printer or 
used as a master at a professional printing shop.  Newspapers could be made 
for your social club, for your church, for school announcements, for 
classroom writing activities, your families annual newsletter, and more.

Another program by Springboard Software, Inc.  is their -Certificate 
Maker-.  This program is similar to Printshop but it makes an 8 1/2 by 11 
award with border, graphic pictures, and text to the user's specifications.  
This program, too, could be used by a myriad of people -- probably you, 
too.

The problem is that Springboard Software, Inc. is -not currently planning 
on converting these programs to the Atari- according to a representative of 
the company.  But it came to me that if enough 8-bit Atari owners expressed 
a real interest in their software, they would be foolish not to make it for 
the Atari.  I believe this is what happened to Broderbund Software and 
their Printshop program.

Here is what you can do.  Write or call Springboard Software, Inc.  (7808 
Creekridge Circle, Minneapolis, MN 55435, Ph.  (612)944-3912) and tell them 
in your own words that you would like to see both programs converted to the 
Atari 8-bit computers.  Tell them how you plan on using them, giving them 
the idea that there are more people in the country like you with an Atari.

Your efforts may convince Springboard that there truly is a market for 
their fine products.  If it does, it will provide us all with some terrific 
and useful software and keep me from buying an Apple clone which I will not 
use except for this software.  I thank you in advance for your help.

ST NOTES by LeRoy Valley
========================

P-K4, P-K4, P-Q4, PxP...  -Would you please stop kibitzing!!!- -Checkmate 
in three moves-...  -Checkmate !-...

By now, most of you can probably guess what my column is about this month. 

For those few uninitiated of you however, the answer is --- CHESS! That's 
right, chess has finally arrived for the ST, and OH has it arrived! I'm 
still dazed by my latest loss. CHESS, by Psion Ltd., is simply the best 
computer chess game I've ever played.

Just to give you some point of reference, I am NOT a beginner.  I've been 
playing chess for 13 years and my USCF rating (even if it is 2 years old) 
is 1856.  I've played Chess 7.0 and Sargon III on the Atari 8 bits and 
numerous other dedicated chess machines (Fidelity, GGM) and nothing 
compares with this offering by Psion. Psion claims that this program won 
1986 World Microcomputer Chess Championships, and I believe it. It's the 
first machine that beats me consistently at tournament level (at times even 
decimates me).  Anyway, enough of that, you get the idea.  It does play a 
strong game.  Now let me tell you about the features it has.

When first booted, you are greeted by an impressive 3 dimensional display 
of a chess board and pieces. By moving the mouse to the top of the screen, 
you can select a number of options from a menu that only appears when the 
mouse is actually at the top of the screen.  During normal play, the menu 
is not visible, and therefore will not distract you. Movement is as simple 
as pointing at the piece and clicking, then moving to the square you want 
and clicking again.  (Don't worry, the computer will not let you make an 
illegal move.)

There are 7 main menus at the top of the screen PSION, GAMES, PLAYERS, 
LEVELS, DISPLAY, MOVES, and FEATURES. Under the PSION menu you have three 
choices:  HELP, LANGUAGE, and QUIT. The manual included is only 4 pages 
long (the English version), but HELP describes every option in great 
detail. LANGUAGE allows you to select any of 6 languages to display all of 
the options in:  English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish.

I am NOT going to explain the QUIT option to you!

GAMES has 4 selections:  NEW GAME, to start a new game at any time, OPEN 
GAME, to load a previously saved game, SAVE GAME, to save the current game, 
and MASTER GAMES, to access any of the 150 Master games stored on disk.  
One note about NEW GAME.  When you select it, the pieces aren't merely 
placed back on the board. Each piece left on the board glides back to it's 
home square.  Nice touch.

The PLAYERS option allows you to select PLAYER vs ST, PLAYER vs PLAYER, and 
ST vs ST.  In the case of PLAYER vs PLAYER, Psion Chess will monitor each 
players moves and all options are available to each player (such as 
Analysis, Hint, and Take Back).

LEVELS gives you a full range of levels to choose from.  Timed levels 
include:  Novice (immediate response), 2 sec., 4 sec., 6 sec., 15 sec., 30 
sec., 45 sec., 1 min., 1.5 min., 2 min., 3 min., 4 min, Equal (Chess will 
take as much time as you do), and Infinite (Chess will search until it has 
found it's best move).

Unlike most computer chess games, Chess plays very well even at the lower 
levels. Setting it as low as 6 seconds per move still yields a challenging 
game.

For those of you who think that the 3D board looks a little cluttered (or 
unconventional), DISPLAY offers a 2D BOARD option. Using 2D BOARD yields a 
reduced size flat 2D chess board, where movement is the same as on the 3D 
board.  Once 2D is selected, the choice changes to 3D BOARD.  You can 
switch between the boards as often as you like during the course of the 
game.  The nice thing about the 2D BOARD version is that you have a 2nd 
window opened next to the chess board that shows a record of all moves by 
both you and Chess.  The record (and the board!) can be printed out. 

This move record is always carried internally whether you're in 2D or 3D.

Other options under DISPLAY include HIDE MOVE RECORD, which closes the move 
record window (it can be retrieved at any time), SHOW ANALYSIS, which, when 
enabled, will show the current expected line of moves and the relative 
advantage held by either side, and finally INVERT BOARD, which simply 
changes the colors of the pieces (you still play your pieces, they're just 
black instead of white, or vice versa).

The MOVES menu allows you to get a HINT, TAKE BACK a move (or moves), 
CHANGE SIDES so that you're playing Chess's pieces and vice versa, OFFER 
DRAW, REPLAY (used on a loaded game or on a master game to replay the 
game), NEXT BEST which tells Chess to take the next best move (this helps 
when looking for multiple mates), MOVE NOW which forces Chess to move NOW, 
and BEST SO FAR which forces Chess to use the best move that it's found.

The final menu, FEATURES, allows you to SET UP the board (for mate problems 
or analysis of games), ENABLE RESIGN to allow Chess to resign if the 
situation becomes hopeless, STOP CLOCKS (yes Chess does keep time for both 
of you), RESET CLOCKS back to 0, turn the SOUND OFF, PRINT MOVES to print 
the entire move record (very nice!), and PRINT BOARD (even nicer!).

If it seems like this column is long winded, you're right.  But this 
program is worth it!  Unlike many programs which play 'I'll wait till he 
makes a mistake and then get him' chess, Chess plays a very aggressive 
game.  The opening game is complete and endgame play is devastating. For 
$49.95, you can't go wrong if you want a good game of chess. If you're 
looking for something to beat, then this might not be the program for you.

Well, I've got to go now.  This infernal machine just challenged me to a 
best out of five series. Until next month.

THREE INDICTED, TWO MORE ARRESTED IN ALLEGED MCI CRACKING CASE
====================================

Last summer's alleged theft of MCI telephone codes has resulted in 
indictments of three Baltimore, Md., people and the arrest of two 14-year-
olds.

Charged in the Baltimore County indictments with theft, unauthorized
access to a computer and using a device to avoid telephone charges are 
James S. Meenen, 28, of Annapolis, Gregory J. Thomas, 26, of Baltimore, and 
Courtney L. Wood, 21, of Baltimore County.

Authorities told The Associated Press more indictments are expected. In 
addition, E. Jay Miller, Baltimore County police spokesman, says two 
teenagers were arrested Saturday and turned over to the Juvenile Services 
Administration in connection with the case.

MCI also had begun its own investigation, says AP, -after identifying 
confidential customer numbers that were being used without authorization.-

Miller said he had no estimate on the value of the stolen services, but 
quoted MCI as saying that industrywide, an estimated $500 million in 
services were stolen from long-distance companies in 1985.

MICROSOFT RIGHTS CASE EXPECTED TO GO TO SEATTLE JURY THIS WEEK
===============================

A Seattle jury is expected this week to get the case of who owns the rights 
to the MS-DOS operating system used on IBM PCs and compatibles.

As reported earlier, Seattle Computer Products Inc. brought a $60 million 
suit against Microsoft Corp., claiming rights to the DOS, which former 
employee Tim Paterson wrote.

Seattle Computer sold MS-DOS to Microsoft in July 1981, a month before the 
announcement of the IBM PC. The company received a relatively small sum and 
the right to receive future versions of the product for free, to sell in 
conjunction with its own line of computer equipment.

Notes The Associated Press, -What the jury must decide is what constitutes 
a version of an old product and what is a new product, and which of those 
'versions' Seattle Computer is entitled to receive.-
