ZMag Special Report

-The First Canadian Atari Users Convention-: In the Promised Land
By Anthony L. Robinson (CHAOS, Michigan)

It was a cool day in Toronto, but for the Atari enthusiast it was a
beautiful day.  It was the -First Canadian Atari Users Convention-. Over
fifty booths of nothing but Atari hardware and software of every kind.
There was even a 260 ST on display at one of the user group tables.  The
convention, open from 10am-6pm, had nearly 700 show-goers in attendance
by 1:30 in the afternoon.  The place was packed!  A great beginning for a
great show.

Many well supplied dealers and user groups were there for the curious and
seeking, even a few programmers, but most important presence for many was
the Atari (Canada) Corporation.  Business was swift and rewarding for all
in attendance.  Inquiries received demonstrations, and questions were
given real answers.  On the hardware end there were no such thing as
shortages or unavailability of products, practically everything that Atari
has manufactures in computers was on hand - in great quantities.  Atari
support, both from the company and from the users, was clearly evident.
While at the Atari booth, it seemed like the only feelings of doubt or
overall complaint came from the U.S. attendees.

Conversations with the Atari representatives revealed several new 
developments, and responses to many current speculations.  Although the
representative was not free to announce all the facts (a privilege
reserved for those at Comdex), he did talk about things in general.  We
can expect to see new products (ie...machines) to start coming out shortly
after the first of the year.  One of the computers coming will be a 68030
chip-based ST.  It will be endowed with enhanced graphic resolution, a
stereo chip, more colors, and the new TOS.  It will remain completely
compatible with existing ST software via the ability to load in old TOS,
and it will support Unix in the same manner.  A '30 upgrade for current
ST's is being worked on, but may prove to be unfeasible due to the amount
of reworking that seems to be necessary.

Other goodies to be released will include a portable laptop ST, a -Amiga
Beater- ST (not the 68030 one!), and later, a ST based game machine -
currently incompatible, but still under development.  On a lighter note,
ST owners can also be on the lookout for a new light gun of the ST, as
well as some new games to utilize it.  The gun will basically be the same
as the design currently available for the XE game system (let's hope the
aim will be better!).  One of the games to use the new gun will be
-Crossbow-, already available on several other computer systems.

Another topic that came up was the company's image as a business company
or game company.  One of the attending users apparently felt that Atari
was wrong to show the ST running games in its advertising.  The Atari rep.
said that there was nothing wrong with it.  In fact, he said that Atari
was interested in showing the business side of the Atari, but was not
trying to kill the game side at the same time.  Almost half of Atari's
profit last year was from the games.  When challenge with the low ratio
of games available for IBM, the representative countered with statistics
that almost 65% of the software available for the IBM was game oriented.
Obviously, Atari wants to have something to offer for everyone.

Further talk with the Atari rep. included references to Atari's efforts to
encourage third party programmers to stick with the U.S. market till they
get more ST's out in the U.S. (ST's are doing great in the UK and Europe,
approaching around 200,000 ST's in the UK alone by Christmas!).
He recited that they've already had success in this activity with
programmers such as Epyx, Electronic Arts, and several others with more to
come.  He stated that all the ST will remain as upwardly compatible as
possible, to help insure a long and happy life for the computer line.
Another activity that Atari is conducting is the importation of european
software to this side of the ocean.  This brings hot, new titles to the
users and helps show U.S. programmers what's being done in Europe on the
ST - yet another market waiting for more Atari titles.

Indeed, most Canadian Atari users seemed very happy with their machines
and its creator.  With plenty of dealers, products, and availability
backed-up with plenty of advertising and promotions, its easy to
understand all the positive and enthusiastic feelings found at the
convention.  To an American, it felt like being in the -promised land-
(imagine what being in the UK must be like! Nirvana!?).  Atari (U.S.) is
promising to bring this -land- to the States.  If Toronto is just a taste
of paradise, it was a taste that should become a regular meal for every
Atari user everywhere.

PRESS RELEASE: OVERVIEW OF COMDEX 1987 ATARI BOOTH
CONNECTIVITY, SOLUTIONS, AND TECHNOLOGY: ATARI ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCTS

(Las Vegas, NV -- Comdex Fall 87)... In a series of major product
introductions, Atari Corporation emerges as a maker of a complete line of
high-performance, low-cost solutions for the business world.

New technology is showcased by Abaq, an ultra-high-performance workstation
with blazing speed and dazzling graphics.  The Abaq, based on a
sophisticated -transputer- chip, runs more than 10 times faster than a
PC/AT technology and more than 5 times faster than the 68020 with math
processor.  The parallel processing capability of Abaq lets a single
system multiply its processing power by adding extra transputer chips.

Atari unveiled its new CD player capable of reading CD-ROM disks and of
playing musical CD disks.  The CD-ROM is supported by a Mega and ST-
compatible DMA interface, and will retail in early 1988 for under $600.

Atari's connectivity answer is a LAN which is compatible with the NETBIOS
standard used by IBM and Novell.  It communicates data at 1 megabits-per-
second to PC's and over 250K bits-per-second over Appletalk.  Atari is
planning to manufacture -PromiseLAN- adapters for the Mega, ST, and PC
computer lines.

The Atari Mega computers are showcased with a variety of solid business
solutions.  Desktop publishing is represented by both the Atari SLM804
Laser Printer and by G.O. Graphics, who are porting their Deskset program
(CompuGraphics compatible) which Atari will market.  Word Perfect is
displaying the recently shipped Word Perfect ST and Atari is displaying
Microsoft Write.  A group of vendors are appealing to VARs with vertical
packages running under the IDRIS multi-user multi-tasking operating
system.  Several new high-end CAD packages are on display including
Foresight's Drafix 1.

Atari expanded its PC-compatible offerings by adding two new models, the
PC2 (PC XT compatible) and PC4 (PC AT compatibile), both with EGA graphics
high clock speeds, and low price tags.  A variation of the PC3 will
operate in VGA graphics mode as well.  The PC2 and PC4 will be offered
with 3.5- or 5.25- floppy disks and with hard disks.  These new models
join the PC1, which at $799 is a basic 512K PC XT compatible, suitable
for use as a LAN workstation and for standalone personal computing.  The
PC2 includes XT-compatible slots, while the PC4's slots are PC AT
compatible.

-We offer complete systems for the office,- said Atari president Sam
Tramiel.  -I can see Atari Mega computers with laser printers as desktop
publishing stations exchanging data with a satellite group of PC1's as LAN
stations.  An entire office environment can be created.  The PC, the
Macintosh, and the Atari computers co-exist.  Each can do the things they
do best.-

(PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRESS RELEASE WAS REPRINTED FROM THE ZMAG ARCHIVES.
AND IS REPRINTED HERE AS A FEATURE BEFORE THE 1988 COMDEX SHOW.  THIS 
COULD VERY WELL BE CONFUSED FOR A 1988 PRESS RELEASE.  PLEASE MAKE A NOTE 
OF THIS.!!)

WHAT IS GIF?
 
GIF is a graphics format common to all machines that read GIF.  What this
means to us is that we can all see the same graphic from ONE file.  The
format allows for 256 level color and BW gray level.  This 256 level is
refered to as -8 Bit- graphics.  Your machine does not display 8 bit you
say, well the Gif format will show you the graphic as your machine can see
it.

I strongly believe in giving credit where credit is due.  GIF is a format
copyrighted by Compuserve, and they have placed it in the Public Domain.
I want to thank Compuserve for the GIF format (even though Im a sysop on
GEnie) because it serves a need that we have, and it does a good job. As
to what machines do the best job, let me say this: I have seen GIF on Mac
SE & Plus, Mac II, Atari ST, MS/DOS EGA,VGA and Super VGA.  I have also
seen Amiga Gif on my Mac II.  There is a lesson to all of this ...Dont
judge one machine from what you see on your Screen.  Obviously the systems
that can show the full 256 levels (8 bit) show up the best.

The best displays I have seen by far are the  Mac II and Super VGA.  Next
would come the Amiga (5 bit), then EGA.  IF you are viewing on an SE or
Plus, you really should stick to the MacPaint conversions (which we will
discuss soon).  On the EGA and other 16 color (4 Bit) machines, you will
see a good image but wont be able to figure out why the rest of us are
raving.  To our ST friends, the ST gif I have seen was not super good, and
I assumed it was under the potential of the ST; therefore I THINK its a
software problem and thereby fixable.

The quality of a Mac II and super VGA is reasonably close to that of a
photograph.  While the topic of 24 bit graphics will soon come up, GIF
does not at this time support that high of graphics.  Besides, the file
transfers would be unreasonalbly long due to size of the files. A 24 bit
file of 5x7 size (75dpi) is 544 K before compression, while an 8 bit of
the same resolution is 181 K. 
 
HOW TO GIF
  
How to Gif? Easy!  All you need is a viewer and/or converter. A viewer is
written for your machine and will open the GIF file.  Many times it will
convert that image to a graphics format common to your computer system. So
all you really need is to download a file and have your viewer open it for
viewing and possible conversion to your favorite graphics format. Where do
I get these programs? Another good question!!

We have all the files you need for most popular systems.  Following is a
list of file on the Photo RT Library that you may download at your

The subject of -Stripping- must also be mentioned.  When a Mac is the
source of the image, that system adds some information to the top of the
GIF file. With this added information used only by the mac system, other
Gif systems will not reconigeze the file as a GIF and will not open it.
Most systems now have strippers that take off this information. Therefore
IF, you have a GIF file you can not open, try a stripper on a COPY of the
file.  This is only true for source files from MAC systems! (More on this
subject in the next topic.)
 
EPHOTE GIF
 
Anyone may upload GIF files or anyother format of photos and art.  GEnie
rules of ratings on the sexual nature of the files is enforced.  If you
have questions as to what this policy is, please Email the questions to
EPHOTE. On the subject of -Stripping-, scans from the PHOTO RT are done on
a Mac II.  While the older files do need stripping, the new files do not.
Confused?  Well if you see the words -pure GIF- the file will not need
stripping. As a general rule, any file uploaded after 10-1-88 by EPHOTE
will not need stripping.  Thanks to Fritz Kass of INFO CENTER BBS, for
showing us how to take out that Mac header.  If you are a mac user and
dont know how to strip out the header, I have placed the proceedure in the
PHOTO RT Bulletin Board Category 15, or you can Email EPHOTE for the
proceedure.

The Graphics Operating Enviroment
>From Total Control Systems
Designer David R. Sullivan

If you are tired of hearing about the GEOS on the Commodore, the GEM
desktop on the ST, and the desktop on the Macintosh, then this is the
productor you!  GOE, the Graphics Operating Environment from Total Control
Systems, is THE desktop operating system for the 400/800/XL/XE/GS systems.
First jus the facts, then I will give you my personal opinion.

GOE is a desktop user interface similar to the desktop on the ST and many
other machines.  GOE will be released on a 64k -super cartridge- about the
first week of November, 1988.  It uses icons to represent the disk drives,
a trash can for deleting files, and different icons to represent the
different types of files on a disk.  GOE operates on all Atari computers,
including the older models as well as the new XE Game System.

GOE supports windows that are resizable, slidable and movable.  You can
have up to 16 windows open at one time!  There are drop down and pop up
menus.  The drop down menus at the top of the screen are definable by the
user.  This means that if you prefer to have the windows drop down when
you point at the top of the screen with the mouse icon, it can be set up
that way.  However, if you prefer to have them only drop down when and if
you -click- on the title of the menu, you can set up it that way.  On the
ST, the drop down menu stays on the screen, once opened, until you either
click on an option, or drag the mouse icon to a blank section of the
screen and click it to close the window.

With GOE you can decide whether you want to -click- to close the drop down
menu or have it close automatically upon your exit from the menu.  In the
desk accessories section, you have a control panel built into the
cartridge, that allows you to set the screen width to 40 or 64 columns and
define in which joystick port you want to use one of the following:
joystick, mouse, koala pad, or touch tablet.  You can also use the
keyboard instead of any of the above.

The CX85 numberic key pad can also be used with GOE, instead of the number
row on the keyboard or the mouse pointer to choose numbers.  You are not
limited to the arrow keys for directional control of the pointer with GOE,
as you can define which keys you want to uses the controlling keys.  Also
you can set the color of the background and the color of the drop down
menus.

There is a calculator included that allows you to do multiplicaton,
addition, subtraction, division, square root, and percentage calculations.
Of course there is also a notepad built into the cartridge that allows you
to leave notes to yourself at almost any time.

When copying files with the ST you are allowed to -lasso- a group of files
and then copy them all to a new disk.  This is also allowed with GOE.  The
function keys are also used with GOE.  The HELP key is used for online
help comment boxes. The START key takes you to DOS.  The SELECT key brings
up the control panel and the OPTION key allows you to change controllers.

GOE works with the MIO, the ATR8000, the 850 and the P:R connection.  GOE
also works with any DOS, including SpartaDos X, MyDos, Atari ADos, Atari
Dos 2.0, and more. Subdirectories, known as folders, are also supported.

GOE comes with over 45cons to choose from, built into the cartridge, with
an editor on a seperate disk.  Disk naming and comment storage for files
is provided for use even with MyDos.  Time/Date stamping is supported for
SpartaDos users.  Directories cane sorted, on the screen, either by name
or file extender.  GOE only uses 8k of memory for a 64k program.

If all this isn't enough, if your user group orders before October 28,
1988 you can get 10% off of an order of 5 or more GOE cartridges, 20% off
of an order of 15 or more.  Discounts must accompany user group presidents
signature and information about the group's member's:  size, types of
computers owned, etc.  Suggested retail price is $79.95 but for a limited
time, you can take the above discounts, with the restrictions mentioned
above, off of the special price of only $50.00 which includes a coupon
for goWrite and goPaint at a special low price.  These two products should
be out soon.

Now for my personal opinion of GOE versus the competition.  There is no
comparison!  GOE is the best desktop operating system for the 8bit Atari
available.  ST jr. or Diamond, whatever the name, cannot compare to GOE.

The GOE demo does more than the released version of Diamond!  GOE takes up
only 8k compared to a disk based program that uses up the limited amount
of RAM in the Atari 8bit computers.  GOE works with all DOS's compared to
Diamond only working with Atari DOS 2.0.

GOE is a very powerful easy to use interface for the novice or experienced
user.  It brings the ATARI 8bit into the 20th century.  I have used it
extensively, the demo version that is, and found it to be very easy to use
and very powerful.  I have loaded several terminal programs with no
problem.

The demo goPaint and goWrite are exciting in what they promise to do. In
all, I heartily endorse Total Control System's Graphic Operating 
nvironment by David R. Sullivan and urge you to send in your orders soon
as possible!  I did!

Bit versus Baud
by Peter Vaughan

I'm a telephone engineer. I get involved in the -bit rate- of modems, as
opposed to the -Baud rate-.  I was talking to someone recently about my
SupraModem 2400 -Bits per Second- (2400 BPS) modem. He came back talking
about 2400 -Baud-. You all probably know that our -2400- modems operate
at 600, not 2400 Baud.  But, just in case anyone doesn't and is
interested:

1) The Atari XM301 and 1030 modems operate at a 300 per second -bit rate-.
   The Baud rate is also 300, because the modulation method is simple
   frequency shift keying.  One bit of digital information from the
   computer results in one tone frequency being transmitted on the
   telephone line.  The rate at which information enters the telephone
   line is called the -Baud rate-.  So the bit rate equals the Baud rate,
   and both are 300.

2) At a 1200 -bit rate-, (for example the SmarTeam 1200, or the Supramodem
   1200) the Baud rate is not 1200, but 600.  In this mode of operation,
   TWO consecutive bits of digital data from the computer are examined
   together.  Depending on what these two bits are, they are then
   converted into a SINGLE phase shift of the previous tone, and then
   transmitted.  Again, the rate at which information actually enters the
   telephone line is the -Baud rate-. So, it's two for one again, and the
   Baud rate is 600, being one half of the 1200 bit rate. This modulation
   method is called Differential Phase Shift Keying, or DPSK.  At the
   receive end, the modem compares the PHASE of the signal with the
   previous phase. Depending on what that phase shift is, it demodulates
   into TWO unique bits of data.  Hence the -two for one-.

3) At the 2400 -bit rate-, the Baud rate is still 600. The modem uses a
   modulation system called Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), which
   is based on the Bell V.22bis protocol. This QAM takes FOUR sequential
   bits at a time, and combines them into a SINGLE signal, which is a
   combination of phase and amplitude.  At the receive end, this single
   piece of information is demodulated back into the original FOUR bits.
   So four bits of digital information from the computer result in one
   transmitted symbol, and the Baud rate is 2400 divided by 4, or 600.

The reasons for reducing the Baud rate are twofold:

A) Stay as near as possible to the middle of the passband of the telephone
   line. Stay away from the high frequency roll-off.  The lower you make
   the highest frequency of a signal on the line, the easier it is to send
   it hundreds, or even thousands of miles without excessive roll-off of
   the highest frequency components. (For example, my brother lives in
   England, and uses our Compuserve network. The one-way path is about
   45,000 miles! The path includes his analog tones on a lot of copper
   wire, some pulse code modulated transmission on more copper wire, an
   up-down satellite path of about 45,000 miles, followed by the same
   landline travel at this end, to a computer in Ohio.)

B) With a low signaling information rate (that is, a low Baud rate), the
   duration of each piece of information sent is relatively long.  So any
   momentary glitch on the telephone line is more likely to be too short
   to cancel the information, or change it in any significant way.  The
   signal goes through, and the receiver demodulates it correctly.

ZMag Download Count Update
by Ron Kovacs

In the recent conference on CompuServe, a question came up about the 
circulation/download counts of ZMagazine.  The following is a survey taken 
during the period of Nov 10-12.  These counts were added together to 
arrive at the amounts indicated.  The sources for these numbers were 
various BBS systems which carry ZMag for download and the online pay 
services.  The BBS systems that were surveyed gave the information via the 
system sysop.  There is NO validation procedure for this listing, other 
then the numbers on the online services.  BBS Systems count = 15, online 
services count = 3.  The current average per system ranges between 20-25 
downloads per week of each issue.  Either ARC or TEXT.  Current listing of 
BBS systems lists 303 systems.

Most operators stated that the issues are downloaded on Thursdays - Sunday 
evenings.  Of the systems surveyed, 10 stated they only include ZMAG in 
the download section.  Meaning NO other online magazines are offered.  Of 
the 5 that offered ST-Report or other online publication, Zmag was NOT 
downloaded as much.  Usual download count on these systems ranged between 
5 - 10 downloads.
