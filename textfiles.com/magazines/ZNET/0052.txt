Xx Special Claug Meeting *
**************************
 This is the second time that Claug has invited Atari officials and Atari
supporting companies to a special meeting to allow us users the opportunity
to ask them questions and hear more about what's coming from their companies.
 This year's Summer CES is truly good news for the 8-bit owners.Atari's area
was heavily supporting the 8-bit products(the STs will probably recieve more
preferencial treatment at the Comdex show that begins in Atlanta this week.)
mostly through the new XE game system.
 I got to the meeting a few minutes late(the Polk Bros warehouse fire had
traffic near Triton running at a snail's pace)but I didn't miss any of the
major news.
 First up was John Skruch,head of XE development.These are some of the exciting
bits of news he let us in on.
The 8-bit 3.5 drive has indeed been cancelled(as reported by John Parchem last
week).However,Atari is coming out with a new higher capacity 5 1/4 drive that
will replace the current 1050s.The drive,called the XF551,is a double sided
drive that supports single,enhanced(10500,and(finally)true double density.
The drive will hold 360k and is 2.9 faster than the 1050,and it will come with
ADOS(written by O.S.S.).ADOS supports features such as time and date stamping
,subdirectories,and is both menu and command line driven.You can type in 3 line
s of commands,hit return and ADOS will perform all the tasks.The Price will be
around what the 1050 is running.Also,the drive is styled to match the XE line.
Expect the drive around August.

 The XEP80 is in production,but due to the shortage of the chip that drives it,
mass production of it has been slowed.

 Toys stores are very excited about the XE game system and are eating it up.
Basically,it's like someone seperated the console and the keyboard and
connected them with a cord.
 In order to have a good software selection for the system Atari has been
liscensing games from companies such as Electronic Arts,Broderbund,Epyx,and
Accolade to name a few,to come out with as cartridges.
 Speaking of cartridges,Atari has come out with a new 256k bank switch cart
for the system that will work on present XL+XE systems(I don't know if 800's
can handle them).One of the first programs to use it will be Flight Simulator 2
that comes with the XEGS.It uses 188k of the cart and completley eliminates the
need for disk access.
 Ten years ago Atari started selling the 2600.It went for $150.Atari has sold
24 million of them.Now Atari is selling the XE game system for $150.It'll be
interesting to see how many of them will have been sold 10 years from now.

 Nat Friedland,the editor of Antic,had some interesting news concerning the
June 87 issue editorial urging 8-bitters to write Springboard and demand an
8-bit version.While at CES,Nat ran into the president of Springboard who said
the following,-Okay I give up,we've started work on the Atari 8-bit version.-
An interesting sidenote:Later,John Skruch said that Springboard had called him
 and asked,-Are you still alive?,Who is Antic?,and why the hell are all these
people writing us?-

 James Yee(The spelling might be wrong,what with all the ways you can spell
James),from Xanth systems(the people who did the ST and 8-bit boink and fuji
boink demos,and the ST Shiny Bubbles demo)was talking about their new ST game
,Midi Maze.Also known as Kill a happy face,the game allows 16 STs to be hooked
together to play it.Each player goes through a first person perspective of a
3-d maze trying to shoot your opponents.A nice feature allows you to create
your own mazes with any St word processor.Hybrid Arts will release the program.

 Neil Harris,well known among Atari modemers on Genie,was very interested in
the critcal nature of the local Atarifest and was going to talk with Claug
officers after the meeting(I'll try to let you know the status of Atarifest by
next week).Atari is planning to buy a chip or drive company in the near future
so it will be easier to come out with products at lower prices.

 Frank from Hybrid Arts(I didn't catch his first name)had a number of comments
concerning the ST and Midi.
It's becoming somewhat of a musician's status symbol to use an ST.One of the
most famous ST owning musicians is Peter Gabriel(Sledgehammer and Big Time).
Later this month,Atari is going to become the first major computer manufacturer
to have a display at the NAM(National Association of Musicians)show here in
Chicago.

  Leonard Tramiel brought up the fact that a number of companies who refused
to support the ST are now doing ST software.Along with Electronic Arts,Passport
and Sonus(2 midi companies) are also supporting the ST with software.
 Question and Answer Period:
Will the Atari Light gun be sold seperately along with the Bug Hunt cart(game
that they were demonstrating the gun with at show)?
 Yes,after the XE game system has been out for a couple months they will start
selling the gun(most likely packaged with the Bug Hunt game)seperatley.
 Two other light gun compatible games are being worked on,Crossbow(the Exidy
arcade game)and Barnyard Blaster(shooting bottles off of fences and vegetables)
. 
 John Skruch also mentioned that Atari is going to be coming out with an
original game called Cracked.It was writtrn by a 19 year old on an ST.Amazingly
it was his first ST program that he wrote.Versions of Cracked will be available
for the 2600,7800,XE,and ST systems.It is also going to appear as a Coin-op
game in the arcades.

 What about the rumored 32 bit TT computer?
 It probably won't come out until 2 or 3 years from now.

 Is Atari working on a network system for the ST?
 Atari isn't working on one,but they have heard of some third parties working
on them.One that is available in the UK can supposedly handle 20,000 STs at
once!

 Why is Atari coming out with the XE game system,when the 5200(which was a
stripped down 400)failed?

 The major difference is that the 5200 was designed to be completely incompat-
ible with the computers,even though they used many of the same chips and such.
The XEGs is completely compatible and makes for a number of good marketing
oppurtunities.
 The 8-bits have been slipping the past few years(in terms of being in stores)
and Atari needed to give it a boost.
However,Atari 8-bits are a huge hit in Poland(no joke).Atari sold 100,000 there
last year.The XEGS will be able to sneak into homes under the disguise of being
a game machine,while it will be increasing the 8-bit computer's user base.An
increased user base will make more software companies interested in supporting
the 8-bits.
 Atari isn't just waiting for other companies to start supporting the XE again
,they've started liscensing programs from top software houses.Some of the
titles I heard were One on One,Archon,Hardball,Rescue on Fractalus,and
Ballblazer.
 Is Atari planning 3-D LCD glasses,such as the ones that were shown for the
Sega and Nintendo Video game systems,for the XEGS?(Editor's Note:It was also
brought up that the glasses for those systems bugged the hell out of your eyes
after a few minutes)
 Atari is exploring a number of 3-d techniques along witha bunch of other neat
things that John Skruch can't talk about.
 Is Atari planning an extended graphics ST?
 Down the road,possibly after the TTs,Atari may come out with an enhanced
graphic system that would be compatible with the ST.

Xx CES Product Analysis by the Editor*
**************************************
 When I first heard about the XE game system back in January,I thought it was
going to have a positive effect on we current 8-bit owners.While,many users
thought of it as a derogatory product,I had hope.Well,my hope has paid off.
 Firstly,if you've been wishing for an 8-bit that had a detached keyboard,like
a Mega ST or Pc clone,your wish has been granted.Secondly,if you've ever wanted
a light gun controller for the 8-bit,that wish has been answered.Anything that
Atari comes out with for the XEGS will also work on current XL+XEs.Probably the
most exciting XEGS development is the new 256k bank switched cartridges.The
cartridge of Flight Simulator 2 just whets your appetite for what else can be
done.Games that load in segments from disk(like Karateka)can now be put in one
cartridge and the slowdown caused by disk access will be gone.Imagine being
able to purchase an Infocom adventure on cartridge that wouldn't have to access
the disk every time you make a move,responses would be instantaneous.
 These new cartridges also make the way for games that required larger memory
or bigger disk storage.One of EA excuses for not having an 8-bit version of
Bard's Tale was that -Atari 8-bits don't have the memory or disk space to
handle it,and EA can't justify coming out with only a 130XE version.-.Well,it
appears that that excuse is out the window now,considering that the carts can
be used on 800XLs,65XEs,and 130XEs.There should be enough of these systems
combined to financially justify a version of Bard's Tale for the 8-bit.
. 
 The XF551 disk drive more than makes up for the 3.5 drive cancellation.
At a whopping 360k,8-bit owners can now store as much data as an ST owner with
a SF354 single sided drive.It's support of all three Atari densities(Single,
Enhanced,and Double)makes it the consumate drive for 8-bitters.
The new ADOS that comes with the drive was written by Atari programming great
,Bill Wilkinson.8-bit owners who envy ST disk features such as time/date
stamping and subdirectories will finally get their wish with the XF551/ADOS
combination.The high capacity of the XF551 also opens up the possibility of
a graphic type operating system being made available for the 8-bits.

Xx The 1987 Zmag Best of Atari Survey *
***************************************
 This survey is being done to help you out when you say to yourself(I need a
good printer,but which one is best?).But we're not just interested in printers.
What follows are 2 lists(one for 8-bits and the other for the St)with the
categories of products.If there is one that you think should be included in the
survey,bring it up in your response.
