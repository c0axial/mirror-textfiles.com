     Presently, computer-to-computer
communication is confined to the
telephone network.  Millions of
computer owners find that it is
increasingly expensive to utilize this
network to satisfy their
communication needs.

     I am advocating the establishment
of a Public Digital Radio
Service, permitting computer owners to
communicate by radio.  An
infinite number of local area radio
networks would be interconnected
into a national packet radio network.
This would allow computer
owners to exchange messages, bulletins
and other information by radio
at no cost.

     The FCC feels the petition might
have merit, but if they do not
receive a significant response from
computer owners, they will
conclude that the public isn't
interested in this service.  If you
feel that computer owners should have
a communicatons alternative,
please show your support.  by writing
to the Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, D.C.  20554.

Trak Drive Problem?

ANTIC ONLINE            ANT-2181
-----------------------------------
November, 1985 issue of Antic.--ANTIC
ED

     ON WRONG TRAK?

     A few weeks ago, a
not-so-briliant friend of mine jammed
two
diskettes into my once-great, Trak
AT-D2 disk drive.  Obviously, the
drive no longer works.  It acts as
though there is no disk in the
drive, except for when it reads the
first sector after about five
minutes.  None of the local shops know
how to fix it and American TV
says it can't be done.  I would really
appreciate any help to trak (ha
ha) down someone who can fix it.  I
don't want to throw away a $400
drive.

     Jason Knapp Fresno, A 746,1331

   @(According to Computer Support, an
official Atari repair center,
even before Trak went out of business
over one year ago the company
did not furnish necessary schematics
and parts to independent repair
outlets.  If your drive requires a
proprietary part, such as a chip,
no repair shop will be able to fix it.
 You may be in luck, however.
Computer Support says it sounds as if
you simply have an alignment
problem which can be fixed.-- ANTIC ED

   CHROMA, XL/XE, and 1702
----------------------------------
   8/19 - Here's suggestions
about accessing chrominance
monitors (Commodore 1702) on
the Atari XL/XE.  Matthew
Ratcliff (75756,2710) says,
-I send the composite video
to the composite chroma input
at the back of the 1702.  It
even gives you a sharper
picture than that of just the
video at the front of the
monitor.  No problem.-  Ray
McGoldrick (76556,710)
observes similiar results.
-----------------------------------
  MORE CHROMA
-----------------------------------
As reported p.6 Feb Antic with diagram:
Regarding Antic'S December, 1985 I/O board: Lthere is a solution for the lack of chroma output on the 800 XL. The chroma output is at the e
e at the junction of R67 and R68. The other side goes to pin 5 on the monitor connector. YOu will have to extend the 200 ohm resistor by 
m
e
ans of an insulated wire. The Chicagoland Atair Users Group get credit for this solution.

Atari JACKINTOSH
The Macintosh look-alike

from January 28 Inforworld
downloaded from Windy City BBS
-----------------------------------
Let'S step back a little more than a year and see what Jack had in mind for us then:
-----------------------------------
  Atari announces (6) new computers and a long list of peripheral hardware, and all a rock bottom prices.

Two Machines in the ST line of (Jackintosh).

  The 130ST with 128k at a cost of less than 399.

  The 520ST with 512k at 599.

  They are both 16-bit computers, which differ only in memory size,boast of graphics capacibilities rivaling those of the $2,195 Apple Ma
c

i

ntos,
 thanks to a version of Digital Research Inc.'S (GEM (Graphics Environment Manager) operating environment,which works with the TOS(Tramiel

 

O

erati
ng System.)

  Like the Macintosh, Atari's ST line,which is driven by a two-button Mouse(the Macintosh has a one-button mouse),features windows that
 

c

a

e enlarged
 or contracted, pull-down memus, and icons.
  The display even shows a trash can to dispose of unneeded files,another feature of the Lisa and Macintos.

  As with the Macintosh,the Motorola 68000 microporcessor provides computing power to the Atari .The Atari ST line offers a built in MID
I

(M
usical Insturment Digital Interface)port,which will enable users to connect up to 16 instruments serially;a hard disk interface with a 1

ive $399.(by June); RS-232 seial and Centronics parallel ports; and a 3 1/2- disk drive($99.00);a 5 1/2- drive($100.)
  The ST machines will be sold with either Basic or Logo according to Craig Suko,Atari software design engineer.
  Sig Hartmann, head of Atari's software efforst, vowed that there would be at least 25 to 30 software titles on the shelves when to com

hipped in early April. Tramiel said that be the second half of the year ,Atari will be producing 200,000 ST units a month.

The 8-bit Computers are:

   65XE (6502c cpu)64k memory,4 indipendent sound voices,built-in Basic,22 Graphics modes,256 colors,full-stroke keyboard w/graphic pri
n

t

e
d on the keys and a ROM Cartridge slot..Although more advanced,it will be offered at the same price as the 800XL less than $120.

   130XE Exactly the same as 65XE except twice the memory for less than $200.


   XEP is a Portable version with 64k memory that includes a 5-inch monochrome monitor,a 3 1/2- drive,and a ROM slot..


   65XEM (Music Micro) which is the same as the 65XE except for its Amy chip...
   This chip is so highly advanced that if you close your eyes,you can't tell if the music is coming from a piano or the computer,..the

 should 
retail for less than $150.00


   Tramiel said tha typical Atari user is 16 to 26 years old. To saturate that customer base, the firm will begin a national school compu
t

e
r
 program March 1. -Every educational instiution that is eligible under our program will receive computers at no charge to the school.


(Ed.) Well, not much happening at the school level, but keep an eye on those other promises......

Chicago Atarian Gordon Reiher has built his own portable Atari...we hope he will soon give us the details!

NEIL HARRIS' TALK 
AT SAN LEANDRO CA COMPUTER CLUB
                                    2/4/86                             By George
 Langworthy


   Neil Harris discussed a wide range of subjects covering 8 bit new
   products, 16 bit products out or nearly out and future 
products and
   nonproducts. They are divided up into three groups below.  The reporter's
   comments and interpretation are in b
rackets[ ].  Otherwise the statements
   are Neil's or a paraphrase.

                          Atari 8-Bit Product
s: 130XE

   A $399 list package is being delivered through computer dealers and mass
   merchandisers which include: 130XE, 1050 drive
, 1027 printer, cables, 5
   software packages.  Announced to Dealers at CES Las Vegas, January 1986.
   [A real buy.]  --- 3 1/2- disk drive prototype is floating around for
   130XE and is likely to get out the door late this year. --- There is a
   box for the 130XE with a parallel printer port and 80 columns in some
   stage of development. No release date. --- No word about a 260XE but may
   come out sometime. --- STAR RAIDERS game may be available in mid March.
   --- PLANETARIUM by DELTRON coming out for 130XE around March 1.  This has
   won several best educational software awards for Commodore version.  ST
   version out mid-April to early May. --- Only new printer for 130XE will
   be the dot matrix XM801.  No release date. --- No hard disk for the 8 bit
   line is planned.


                           ST Products; 520 AND 1040

   Next revision of TOS in ROM will be out in summer 1986 or later. ---
   There will be a patch in the hard disk boot program to take care of this
   problem in TOS: after too many openings and closings of GEM windows, TOS
   quits taking any more. --- 20 megabyte hard disk has been delivered to
   developers; hardware fine.  Cleaning up software as in #2.  Should be
   available late February or early March. --- JOUST in process for ST.  No
   release date. --- Unauthorized version of CP/M software emulator for ST
   done in Germany that showed up in USA didn't work with TOS in ROM.
   Running fine with Wordstar and Microsoft BASIC faster than Z-80.  To be
   released by ATARI probably in March. --- MS-DOS Emulator is a hardware
   and software black box with an 8088 chip and 512K of memory.  Plugs into
   DMA port.  Will list for about $200 without 5 1/4- drive and run faster
   than a  standard IBM PC.  Because of hardware development needed, release
   date not firm now. --- No tape drive backup for hard disk planned at
   present. --- H & D Base clone of DBase II is a Forth language program
   with DBase-like commands.  Runs faster on ST than DBase II on IBM  PC.
   Out now. --- The DRI GEM vs APPLE controversy has no effect on ATARI, as
   ATARI is a licensee of DRI.  If there is a future problem, ATARI will
   deal with it at that time.  --- GEM PAINT, WRITE, CALCULATOR and DESKTOP
   ACCESSORIES are still under development.  No release date. --- BORLAND
   has announced they will have TURBO PASCAL for  the ST.  [BORLAND San Jose
   Mercury News display ad, Sunday, February 2, 1986 was for programmer and
   engineer for CD ROM product development. Turbo Lightning improvement
   could be retrieval -engine- for information placed on CD ROM disc.] ---
   RISING STAR's MIDI program coming along.  ATARI has  first refusal on
   VALDOCS software it might want. --- ACTIVISION's MUSIC STUDIO 16 channel
   MIDI software to ship in February.  With electronic keyboard and drums,
   sounds like a full band.  Other MIDI software due from HYBRID ARTS. ---
   No SCSI adapator in works for ST line. --- OS-9 operating system in
   development for ST.  No release date.


           Other Products Talked About But Not Officially Announced

   AMY music chip proved to be too complex and expensive to develop for the
   potential ATARI market.  Turned over to SIGHT AND SOUND to develop for
   synthesizer market, with ATARI retaining rights to computer market.  No
   release date. --- 1200 baud modem for ST under study but not under
   development at present. --- In response to question about EXCALIBUR,
   response was that ATARI was in advanced stages of negotiation with major
   telecommunications network to revive APX for both public domain and low
   cost commercial software.  This will be ATARI's own SIG system. --- Bit
   blitter chip for improved graphics and other information about rumored
   products covered in BYTE March 1986 article, out in late February.  Will
   talk about products to be introduced at March Hanover Trade Fair, West
   Germany. [Atari 520 ST reported by Atari and others to be best selling
   microcomputer in Germany.] --- TT 32-it add on computer box to contain
   memory management chip.  It is designed to be a high-compute processor
   system, a -VAX on a desk,- running some version of UNIX with
   foreground/background processing. [32 bit internal and external processor
   chip selection not made or not known by outsiders.  Amount of memory not
   known.] Release date not known.  Very much guess as to price is $1,000.

THE 256K    1200 XE 


Compuserve Download Files
-----------------------------------
          This file will contain any useful information that pertains
          to the 256K memory upgrade in DL3 - FREDD.XMO. Anyone with
          something to add, leave me a message and I'll put it in.
          BOB WOOLLEY [DAD]  [75126.3446]
          A. 2/04/86 The new 256K ram chips can retain their data for
an amazing length of time after power is shut off. If you
don't wait long enough before you power on again, the OS does
a half-hearted warm start and you hang in limbo. Ten full
seconds is usually long enough.... Be patient!
B. 2/04/86 On a 1200XL - If you replaced the OS ROMS with 28
          pin devices, you can choose between two different OS's with
          the TV CHAN 3/4 select switch. Solder a wire between the top
          of W6 (just to the right of U12 - remove the W6 jumper),
          through a 1000 ohm resistor to the bottom of the black bodied
inductor, L14 (between cartridge slot and modulator). Use
          27128 EPROMS - Burn $C000-$DFFF of OS #1 into $0000-$1FFF and
      $C000-$DFFF of OS #2 into $2000-$3FFF. This EPROM goes into
          U12. Burn $E000-$FFFFof OS #1 into $0000-$1FFF and
     $C000-$DFFF of OS #2 into $2000-$3FFF. This EPROM goes into
          U13. Now you can select which OS boots on power up with the
          channel select switch!! Sort of a Junior RAMROD.
          C. 2/4/86 The 1200XL modification runs BASICXE just like the
          130XE - without the DOS 2.5 RAMDISK. If you boot ATARI BASIC
          under DOS 2.5 without the ramdisk, POKE 4838,163, go to DOS,
          and write DOS to the disk, you will be able to run BASICXE
          and the DOS 2.5 RAMDISK at the same time.
