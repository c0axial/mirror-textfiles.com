 ATARI DEVELOPER CONFERENCE HELD
 Atari held a developer conference in London with over 120 developers in
 attendance on June 27, 1992.  Attendance at the confernce was by
 invitation only which included staff from Atari Sunnyvale including Sam
 Tramiel, Bill Rehbock and John Skruch.  In addition to the Atari
 personal, a few experts where brought along to discuss features of the
 Atari Falcon and specific information on programming the DSP.  Reactions
 from the intense one day affair were positive and widly enthusiastic. 
 While some were not Atari developers, the features of the new machine
 captured the imaginations of all.
 
 
 NAGY MIFFED ATARI MUM
 In Issue #826 of ST-Report contained defamitory information about
 AtariUser Editor in Chief John Nagy and Atari Corp..  Nagy called the
 editor of the publication to complain and request removal of the issue
 from all the distribution services, later a new issue was released minus
 the offending comments.  The file however generated over 355 downloads
 on GEnie alone before the replacement was uploaded.  Nagy was pleased
 with the action taken, however, officials at Atari Corp had no comment
 on the matter.
 
 
 SPA SETTLES ACTION
 The Software Publishers Association and Consolidated Micro Services
 announced the settlement of a copyright infringement suit brought
 against Los Angeles area computer dealer Consolidated Micro Services and
 its owner, Gary Johnson, by SPA members Fifth Generation Systems, Lotus,
 Microsoft, Novell, and WordPerfect.  As part of the settlement of the
 suit, CMS agreed to make a contribution to SPA's Copyright Protection
 Fund and to distribute a policy against unauthorized copying or
 distribution of software to all CMS employees.  Since 1988, the Software
 Publishers Association has filed over 150 lawsuits on behalf of its
 members and obtained numerous search and seizure orders against
 businesses, computer dealers, bulletin board services, and educational
 institutions that have violated its members' copyrights.  The SPA's
 anti-piracy hotline, 1-800-388-7478, accepts calls reporting software
 violations.
 
 
 PC/TELEVISION SHIPS
 50/50 Micro Electronics announced this week Wednesday that its PC/
 TELEVISION- product is now shipping.  PCT is a new add-on board for
 IBM-compatible computers that incorporates a 119 channel tuner capable
 of handling VHF, UHF and cable TV frequencies.  Standard cable TV
 coaxial cable can be connected directly to the card as well as an
 external TV antenna.  Other input devices can include a VCR, laser disc
 player, a video camera or an internal private broadcast TV cable.  The
 product is compatible with all IBM XT/AT (286/386/486) style computers
 and runs under MS-DOS 3.1 or higher.
 
 
 MAXTOR INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCT
 Maxtor has introduced the MXT-340, an inch-high drive with 340-megabytes
 of formatted storage capacity.  The MXT-340 uses the same components and
 features the same fast seek times and data transfer rates as its parent
 drives, the inch-high MXT-540 and the full-height MXT-1240, which
 provide 540MB and 1.2 gigabytes of formatted storage capacity,
 respectively. 
 
 
 ATARI WITHDRAWS APPEAL
 Nintendo and Atari Corp. announced that Atari has withdrawn its appeal
 of a jury verdict and judgment in favor of Nintendo in Atari's antitrust
 case against Nintendo, which was recently tried in Federal Court in San
 Francisco.  Nintendo will not proceed with its request to recover
 certain court costs from Atari.

 IN SEARCH OF THE ATARI FALCON 030
 
 Even though no official word is available, even though Atari has
 maintained a lid on details, and even though some leaks claim that the
 new computer to be unveiled this fall won't bear the name FALCON, the
 rumor mill has provided ample pseudo-information on what is expected to
 be a remarkable machine.
 
 Atari held an invitation-only Falcon developer conference in London on
 June 27th, attended by over 120 developers.  Sam Tramiel, Bill Rehbock,
 and John Skruch were among those attending the conference for Atari.  In
 addition to the Atari personal, a few experts were brought along to
 discuss features of the Falcon and programming the Digital Signal
 Processor.  Reactions from the intense one day affair varied from the
 positive to the wildly enthusiastic.  A number of the developers that
 attended are not currently working on Atari platforms, but the
 demonstrations and discussions appear to have convinced all of them to
 either reconsider their position or to immediately add Atari to their
 development programs.
 
 Sam Tramiel has planned to reveal the Falcon technical details in live
 conferences on the GEnie and Delphi telecommunications networks in early
 August.  This will be in preparation for the huge Dusseldorf Atari Messe
 (-fair-) in Germany, August 21-23, where the public should see the
 Falcon for the first time.  Commercial availability for the units is
 projected for later this fall.
 
 A first look almost came early, through the efforts of Atari Advantage
 Magazine.  An exclusive Falcon story, complete with photographs of the
 outside and even the motherboard of the Falcon, was planned for their
 June issue.  However, delays in production caused that issue to become
 the June/July issue, and then negotiations with Atari Corp regarding
 non-disclosure matters caused the photographs to be dropped and the
 printing to be further delayed until late July.  The photographs will
 instead be featured in an upcoming issue of Atari Explorer (see related
 story, below).  The Atari Advantage Falcon article remains generally
 complete, and is recommended reading, even getting -thumbs up- from
 Atari officials.  The Falcon issue should be available at Atari dealers
 well into August.
 
 Speculative Specs

 The Falcon 030 (it may still be called something else when released, but
 this name is now seeming to stick) will feature a 68030 running at
 16mHz, be in the 1040-style one piece cabinet, and feature -more colors
 than you can see, more sounds than you can hear-, and use a Motorola
 Digital Signal Processor DSP 56001 (like in NeXT).  It will have an
 updated TOS operating system that will include MultiTOS multitasking.
 That much is official.  The rest is via leak and speculation, and as
 such, subject to change.
 
 MultiTOS was developed by ATARI Corp. in cooperation with Eric Smith of
 the Mathematics Department at the University of Western Ontario.  Eric
 designed the multitasking kernel called MiNT, which forms the basis for
 MultiTOS, a combination of ROM code in the TOS and extensions on disk.
 Message pipelines exist between parallel running applications, allowing
 controlled interaction of simultaneous processes in different windows.
 Old-standard desk accessories now unnecessary due to CPX modules and the
 ability to run programs simultaneously, in effect, making every
 application work like an accessory.  Under MultiTOS, if one of many
 parallel running applications should crash, the others remain protected
 and safe.  A more limited version of MultiTOS for older ST computers is
 expected to be available as software.
 
 According to the Atari Advantage Falcon story, the Falcon case will be a
 dark grey, similar to the color of the Portfolio and STacy.  It will
 feature an STe/TT compatible LAN port plus and industry standard SCSI II
 peripheral port, stereo microphone and headphone jacks,  STe extended
 joystick ports, a DSP port, and a built-in speaker.  This last item is
 important as the Falcon will be able to use standard high resolution
 color multisync monitors which typically have no audio.  Older Atari
 monitors will also be usable with an adaptor.  Broadcast quality TV
 compatible video is offered with built-in genlock and -true color-
 32,768 color capacity plus a variety of other modes (including all ST
 modes).
 
 Sound?  Yikes.  Sixteen-bit digital record/playback in resolution up to
 50 kHz (better than an audio CD) in up to eight channels, with direct-
 to-hard-disk recording, with a DSP port allowing digital audio transfer
 rates of up to a megabyte per second.  And STe 8-bit and ST three-voice
 sound will be supported, making the Falcon as close to 100% backwards
 compatible as possible.
 
 Also in the copyrighted Advantage article are observations of on-board
 sockets that appear ready for addition of alternate CPU devices, such as
 PC or MAC emulators.  With the dramatic speed and PC compatible video,
 emulation should be a snap.  Other internal items included a fan and an
 internal hard disk--a 2.5- 40 meg unit in the one Advantage cracked
 open.  A daughter board held 16 meg of RAM in a plug-in module.
 
 Price?  It is rumored that the Falcon 030 will start at under $700.
 
 
 ATARI EXPLORER TAKES ADVANTAGE
 Atari Advantage has ceased publishing operations after only three
 issues, as the publisher and editor have been hired to take over
 production of Atari's in-house magazine, Atari Explorer.  Mike Lindsay
 and Darren Meers are relocating to Sunnyvale to pilot the glossy bi-
 monthly Explorer after their short but well-received stint producing
 their own Atari magazine.  According to Lindsay, many subscriptions were
 either not billed or charged in anticipation of the move.  Paid
 subscribers will be given options on conversion to a subscription to
 Atari Explorer.
 
 Lindsay and Meers were part of ST-INFORMER for four years, and both left
 Informer in January 1992 over a dispute regarding ownership and control.
 Their own magazine, Atari Advantage, had established a respectable
 circulation, but Atari Corp. elected not to bring Advantage in-house as
 an additional magazine.
 
 The naming of editorial staff for Explorer ends months of conjecture
 about who would take over for John Jainschigg.  John declined to move to
 Sunnyvale from his New York offices where he produced Explorer for the
 last two years.
 
 Bringing Atari Explorer to the home offices is part of an overall
 consolidation of executive effort and attention at Atari.  Overseeing
 the magazine operation will be Atari's Bernie Stolar.
 
 (Editors Note:  Since this story was written, Atari Advantage Magazine 
 has been purchased by Castle Publishing in Texas and will be edited by 
 Neil Simon.)
 
 
 LYNX GOES WEST
 As Atari gears up for the Jaguar game console to be released in 1993,
 the Lombard Illinois offices of Atari Entertainment are being relocated
 to Sunnyvale.  Home of the Lynx development team, Lombard will remain
 open as a programming center, but sales, marketing, and support for the
 Lynx and soon the Jaguar will be part of the California operation under
 the guidance of Bernie Stolar.  Leaving Atari are Larry Seigal and Dana
 Plotkin, who did not wish to relocate.
 
 
 ATARI IN FORBES
 The August 3, 1992 issue of Forbes Magazine recounts the Atari story in
 a two-page article called -Cheap Didn't Sell- by Dyan Machan.  The famed
 business/industry reporting magazine blames Atari's troubles on the
 Tramiel family's penny pinching.  Machan claims that second-quarter 1992
 financial statements (unavailable at press time) will be far worse than
 the first quarter when Atari lost $14 million on $44 million in sales.
 Further, the article says that Jack Tramiel has personally taken over
 day-to-day operation of the company, moving his son Sam out of his
 former office.  The article does mention the new line of Falcon
 computers and the Jaguar game console, but speculates that Atari has
 less than half of the cash needed to perform an appropriate roll-out of
 the new products.  Atari officials aren't happy with the Forbes
 article's tone, but some observers are saying, -Any press is more press
 than we have had.  A lot of readers will discover that Atari is not
 dead, at least.-
 
 
 NEW SUPERBASE COMING
 Superbase database systems for the Atari have been acquired by Oxxi Inc.
 who now offer upgrades for the popular line of software.  The charge to
 upgrade either version of Superbase Personal to SB Pro 3 is $85,
 available only through Oxxi.  The upgrade includes full product, manuals
 and all.  A new product, Superbase 4, is expected in the near future.
 Oxxi Inc., P.O. Box 90309, Long Beach, CA  90809-0309, USA, FAX (310)
 427-0971.
 
 
 NEW HOST BRINGS CD, FLOPTICAL TO ATARI
 ICD Inc. has announced a new host adaptor that will enable standard ST
 computers to use industry standard SCSI devices, including hard drives,
 CD ROM drives, and flopticals designed for IBM, MAC, and Amiga.  Pricing
 has not been announced, but -The Link- will be a self-powered molded
 cable-box affair that will connect to Atari's DMA (ACSI) port and plug
 directly to standard 50-pin centronics style SCSI ports, giving instant
 and complete access to virtually any peripheral using SCSI, with up to 8
 devices at one time being supported.  Better yet, MS-DOS formatted
 devices will read and write directly and transparently from the ST
 without modification, using ICD's driver software.  CD-ROMs are now
 supported through The Link's extended SCSI commands, with a re-written
 MetaDOS driver to support the SCSI-2 standard for CD-ROM players.  The
 ICD Link will be premiered at the Atari Messe in Dusseldorf, Germany in
 August.  ICD is taking orders now with shipments expected in mid-August.
 For further information, contact Thomas Harker at ICD by phone (815)
 968-2228 extension 120, or FAX (815) 968-6888.
 
 
 CD's, PHOTOS, AND ATARI
 Atari's been dodging the CD-ROM technology for almost three years, and
 now it looks like the wait might pay off.  New CD technology is becoming
 available that makes most older disk players obsolete.  The Kodak Photo
 CD system provides a way for consumers to have their color photographs
 printed to a CD in resolutions exceeding all but the most sophisticated
 computers and monitors.  But the new format can't be read by many
 current CD player drives.  The new system is called Mode 2, XA, multi-
 session capable.  If you are buying a CD ROM, look for those
 specifications to preserve your value.  New format drives might be
 readable using the ICD LINK (see story above) or by using ICD's revised
 MetaDOS on a TT or Falcon.
 
 
 PHOTO CD CONVERSION FOR ATARI
 Picking up the torch of CD photos and accessibility to quality color
 conversions of photographs, Randall Kopchak of It's All Relative is
 offering to make ST-readable STe Spectrum format files of any photograph
 on a Kodak CD for only fifty cents each (PC standard GIF files will be
 made at $1 each).  The first ever published STe conversion is of a
 fountain in Keiner Plaza in Saint Louis, Missouri, and shows dramatic
 detail in the water and sky.  Originally shot on standard film, it was
 converted to CD by Kodak, stored in 24-bit RGB at a resolution of 2048
 by 3072 pixels.  Kopchak says that when Atari settles on the CD driver
 systems, his company will offer a direct view software system for the
 Kodak CD's.  In the meantime, the company does offer software to convert
 CD photographs to GIF format via -Virtual BookMaker PC-, available for
 $25, and requiring a 386 or better PC with VGA or better, 2 meg or
 better memory, XA CD ROM drive, running Windows 3.1 or higher.  For
 processing CD's to regular computer disk files, enclose the required
 payment plus $3 per order for postage and handling, and send your Kodak
 CD to Randall Kopchak, It's All Relative, 2233 Keeven Lane, Florissant,
 MO 63031, (314) 831-9482, GEnie address: GREG, CIS address: 70357,2312.
 
 
 ATARIUSER REDUCES SUBSCRIPTION RATE
 AtariUser Magazine, a monthly Atari publication with coverage of the
 entire Atari line of computer products, has announced a promotional
 price cut in their home subscription rates.  New and renewal subscribers
 can take a $5 discount and pay just $15 for one year, 12 issues of the
 magazine with standard 3rd class delivery.  A new offering of FIRST
 CLASS DELIVERY is now also available for only $5 more than the standard
 rate, or $25.  -We had complaints from parts of the country where 3rd
 class takes three or more weeks to deliver,- said AtariUser Editor John
 Nagy, -and since we publish our issues in real-time rather than
 'newsstand time', our August issue is shipped July 30.  That allows us
 to include news we receive as late as July 24.  But it means that a few
 subscribers get the August magazine on August 24.-  Dealers and user
 groups are shipped their copies of AtariUser via UPS, which takes about
 one week to cross the USA.  The FIRST CLASS HOME DELIVERY OPTION will
 allow home subscribers to get the magazine within three days of printing
 at a total yearly (12 issue) subscription rate of $25.  The $15 standard
 and $25 First Class subscription rates will be good for orders received
 by October 1, 1992.  For this promotional rate, payment must be included
 (by check, money order, or VISA/MASTERCARD number and signature) and
 orders may ONLY be by mail.  Be sure to include your complete address
 and phone number.  Send your order to QUILL PUBLISHING CO., 113 W.
 College Street, Covina, CA 91723-2008.
 
 
 I DON'T LIKE YOUR TONE
 It can happen to you: replace your toner in your Atari SLM laser printer
 (or others!) and suddenly you get light print with streaks.  You can
 keep increasing the toner darkness dial inside the SLM until it's all
 the way on, to the point of spooning toner onto the drum, and your
 printouts are still light and streaky.  Woe is you, you need an
 expensive new drum.  NOT.  Although it is a little known fact, all toner
 is not created equal--even name brands.  Differences between production
 runs, age, storage, etc. can each affect the quality of the toner, and
 your new toner may be the culprit.  Before you shell out for a drum,
 replace the toner again with a fresh box, bought somewhere or sometime
 other than the first box.  You are likely to find, once the new toner
 circulates, that your printer is happy again.  And you can't lose if the
 drum is to blame after all, just use the replaced toner later.  But
 store it carefully--its a mess.

 LYNX BRIEFS
 
 ~ Look for unexpected fun in the new Lynx game TOKI (reviewed last
 month in AtariUser).  On level 3, a bug in the program (rather than an
 intentional -Easter Egg- surprise) allows you to go through the ceiling
 and bypass part of the game.  It can make the game crash or distort the
 display if you do go exploring.  This might be fixed in a later
 production run, making this a limited-time passport to the unknown!
 
 ~ As summer approaches, video game companies start dropping their prices
 and the competition starts to heat up.  This year is no exception.
 Turbo Technologies started out by packing Bonk's Revenge with the
 Turbografx-16 and slashing the price of their CD-Rom peripheral to an
 amazing $150.  Sega made their move next by dropping the price of
 Genesis to $130, and were quick with a commercial that touted their
 price advantage over the $180 Super Nintendo system.  This would have
 been a real coup if Nintendo hadn't dropped their price to $150 at the
 same time.  Who's going to be the winner?  The game buying public.
 
 
 LYNX SURVIVAL - The Essentials
 
 What Lynx accessories and games are absolute necessities for Lynx
 fanatics?  AtariUser asked me to come up with some suggestions for you.
 
 Accessories
 
 The Lynx is a compact portable system, but if you plan to have your
 essentials with you, a carrying case is a must.  Atari's kit carrying
 case is readily available and does the job nicely.  However, if you can
 find someone who has one of the modular Realm cases, see if they'd be
 willing to part with it.  The costs for making the cases was too much
 for Realm to absorb and attempts to do a new case haven't panned out, so
 they're something of a collector's item.
 
 If you're planning on doing any outdoors Lynx play, you'll need a sun
 screen.  These handy items from Atari are very affordable (only $5) and
 are available in versions for the original Lynx and the new smaller Lynx
 (the original models are starting to get scarce so if you need one, be
 sure to pick one up).
 
 If you don't feel like buying tons of AA batteries to keep your Lynx
 running you have two excellent options.  If you're in range of a power
 outlet, the AC adaptor will provide you with continuous power and tons
 of playing time.  But you're probably saying, -Clint, the Lynx is
 supposed to be portable.  What if I want to play a long time while I'm
 on the move?-   No problem.  With the newly released Lynx battery pack
 and 6 D batteries, you can go portable for 30 straight hours and play to
 your heart's content.
 
 Games
 
 Best Puzzlers: If you want brain-twisting, you have 2 terrific choices.
 Chip's Challenge was one of the first Lynx games and is still regarded
 as one of the best (since its debut on the Lynx it's found its way onto
 most computer platforms and the NES).  Crystal Mines 2 is much newer but
 is just as addictive.  Fans of the classic Boulder Dash will be pleased.
 
 Best Shooters:  Want something less cerebral with more firepower?  Blue
 Lightning is a jet jockey's dream that makes excellent use of the Lynx's
 scaling abilities.  If you like the scrolling-power up-bosses type of
 games then Zarlor Mercenary delivers.  Expect to invest some time before
 you see the final boss.
 
 Best Run and Jump: This category has become a staple thanks to the Mario
 Brothers, and the Lynx has a real standout with Scrapyard Dog.  It has
 lots of gameplay and plenty of hidden stuff to keep you interested.
 
 Best Multi-player: Think you might run into some fellow Lynx
 enthusiasts?  The Lynx was built with multi-player fun in mind and it
 has 2 real standouts.  Slime World was the first game that really showed
 just how good multi-player action could be (up to 8 people can join in).
 Feel like a little dogfighting between friends?  Then you need Warbirds.
 Players take to the skies in World War 1 biplanes in a contest to see
 who's the real ace.
 
 Best Arcade games: Need some arcade action without the quarters?  Tackle
 the classic reflex tester Klax (regarded by many to be the best
 conversion available).  Martial arts more your speed?  Then take on
 Ninja Gaiden which is a tremendous mimic of the arcade game.  An arcade
 game that few thought could be done justice on any home system (let
 alone a portable system) was the popular Stun Runner.  Guess what?  The
 folks at Atari somehow pulled it off and it's very impressive.
 
 Best Sports games: As I write this, we're still waiting for the flood of
 new sports titles but there are now two goodies for sports fans.
 Checkered Flag brings you formula 1 racing action and lets 6 people
 compete against each other.  If you fancy a round of golf, Awesome Golf
 lives up to it's name.  It's easy to grasp and quite challenging.

 * THE 12-VOLT 8-BIT                                      By Jeff Golden
 =======================================================================
 
 
 Who says, -You can't take it with you-.  With the aid of the following
 modifications, it is possible to power your 800XL or 130XE from the car
 battery without affecting its 120VAC operation.
 
 You can take along your favorite computer games for those long road
 trips, and if you are into writing travelogues, you can take along your
 TextPro disk and take notes along the way.
 
 Now that your car has some programmable -computer smarts-, how about
 getting carried away with a monitor-based instrument panel and a voice
 that nats at you when you forget to check the oil.  Add in those
 instruments that you have always wanted, like a low oil sensor or a
 miles-per-gallon meter.  This isn't as silly as it might sound.  A 600XL
 with some cartridge software and a few extra sensors could do all that.
 
 Let me hasten to add a disclaimer at this point.  If you manage to zap
 your computer, burn up the car, run off the road, or achieve some other
 undesirable result after following these instructions, we cannot assume
 any responsibility.  You are strickly on your own.
 
 The modifications have been tested and work on my equipment, but because
 of the wide variety of 8-bit devices and user skills, there is no way
 that we can assure you that the changes will work on your equipment.
 
 Let me caution you that any connections to the car's electrical system
 should be properly fused and to check all voltages and polarities with
 a VOM before you connect any equipment.  Futhermore, you should check
 the equipment for signs of overheating, particularly during the first
 hour of use, and never leave the equipment unattended while it is
 plugged into the electrical system.
 
 Do not operate or connect the equipment after it has been subjected to
 rain or condensation.
 
 Powering up the computer:  The 800XL and the 130XE are powered with 5.18
 volts of DC that is fed into the computer by means of a 7-pin male DIN
 plug.  There are two ways of providing this 5VDC from your car battery.
 The easy way is to obtain and modify one of the early XL power supplies,
 (the black and white XL supply that can be taken apart).  The other, and
 more expensive way, is to make your own 12VDC power supply which is
 actually easier done than said.  (The old cliche reversal is
 intentional).
 
 If you have one of the old style XL power supplies, you can modify it in
 the same manner that is described below for the 1050 disk drive,
 otherwise we will need to replace the AC power supply brick with a
 similar sized brick that reduces the 12-15 volts of car power to 5
 volts.  This is easily accomplished by wiring a simple voltage regulator
 circuit and mounting that circuit in a ventilated plastic box.  (See the
 wiring diagram).
 
 Radio Shack has the perfect power supply box for this purpose, and it is
 highly recommended.  (270-287).  This box will insulate the heat sink
 both thermally and electrically. (The heat sink is charged at +5 volts).
 The other parts are also available from Radio Shack with the exception
 of a heavy duty heat sink.
 
 The regulator will generate about 10-15 watts of heat that must be
 carried away from the regulator chip to prevent it from destroying
 itself.  You may be able to buy a heavy duty heat sink at an electronics
 store, or you may want to fabricate one from heavy aluminum scrap.  I
 used an aluminum bar 18- X 1- X 1/8-.  The bar was folded accordion
 style to fit into the case.  The regulator chip was fastened to the
 center of the bar with heat sink grease in between and no insulators.
 
 My regulator chip was mounted vertically with the pins projecting
 upward.  The regulator mounting screw was also used to mount an L-shaped
 bracket which in turn was used to support a small circuit board above
 the heat sink.  A coaxial jack was fastened to the case for the 12VDC
 input.  A 2-conductor 18ga lamp cord and a DIN plug were run out the
 other end of the case for the 5V output.
 
 Be sure to check your DC-converter brick for proper voltage and polarity
 before connecting it to the computer.  The output should be between 5.15
 and 5.25 volts at the DIN plug.
 
 Powering up the 1050:  This one is easy.  All that we have to do is
 mount a 12VDC input jack on the 1050 case and then let the regulators
 inside the 1050 take care of the rest.  See diagram.  No circuit
 cutting or switching is necessary and the 1050 will still run under AC
 as well as DC.  Wire the DC jack to the plus and minus poles of the AC
 rectifier as shown.  The DC jack can be double-checked by connecting the
 1050 to AC power in the normal way and then checking the empty terminals
 of the DC jack for approximately 11 volts of DC with the expected
 polarity.
 
 Warning!!  Plugging AC into the DC jack could damage the electrolytic
 capacitors and other components.  I recommend covering up the DC jack
 with a piece of tape whenever the drive is not being used in the car.
 
 Atari uses a negative signal ground which corresponds nicely with the
 majority of cars which also use a negative ground.  To minimize possible
 shorts to the car body, I connected the negative DC line to all of the
 outer (exposed) rings of the coaxial DC plugs and connected the positive
 DC line to the center tips.
 
 Plug the TV monitor and the computer into the cigar lighter using a Y
 adaptor.  (AC/DC TVs usually come with a lighter cord).  Using the
 lighter socket enables the driver to easily disconnect the system when
 parking the car, and it also enables the easy removal of everything
 when the vacation is over.  Cigar lighter plugs can be bought with
 built-in fuse holders.  The computer/disk drive combo needs a 5-amp
 fuse.  It only draws about 2 amps, but there is too much of a voltage
 drop across a fuse that is smaller than 5 amps.
 
 Operational notes: Disk boot errors may occur when the car's engine is
 not running.  Startng the car generates a higher voltage that should
 take care of the problem.  Also any dirt in the cigar lighter can cause
 similar problems.  Run the engine when you want to use the computer.
 Otherwise the combined current of the TV and computer may be enough to
 run the battery down in the middle of your Donkey Kong game.
 
 One Final WARNING!  It is illegal to operate a TV in the front seat of a
 vehicle.  Put the whole thing in the back where it is impossible for the
 driver to see and/or assist in its operation.  Even folks with the best
 of intentions will find it impossible to resist the need to twiddle the
 knobs when the kids are having difficulties.  It could be your last
 twiddle.
 
 Here are the detailed directions for modifying a 1050 disk drive.  This
 also applies to modifying the -old- style 800XL supply.
 
 1.  Open the case and locate the four rectifier diodes.  These are small
     black cylinders, 1/2- long by 3/16- diameter, mounted on the circuit
     board right next to each other.
 
                  BACK OF 1050
      -----------------------------------
      A.C.             !
            -------    !    -------
        *--! diode !---*---! diode !--* 
           !
        !   -------         -------   ! 
        !                             !

        *--! diode !---*---! diode !--*
        !   ---- --    !    -------   !

        !                             !
       (-) minus DC          plus DC (+)
 
 2.  Using care, use your voltmeter to determine the plus and minus
     poles of your rectifier diodes.  These are labeled (-) and (+) in
     the above diagram, but could be different on your machine.
 
 3.  Wire a coaxial power jack to the plus and minus poles of the
     rectifier.  The jack leads can be easily soldered to the appropriate
     diode leads.  Do NOT attempt to run the wires under the board.
     There isn't enough room and the sharp pins will pierce the
     insulation. 
 
     Connect the minus lead to the outer ring of the jack and the plus
     lead to the center tip.
 
 4.  Mount the jack.  I enlarged the hole in the 1050 case where the
     drive select switches are and mounted the input jack there.  Tape
     the jack wires to the tall capacitor to prevent them from draping
     across the 1050 heat sink.
 
 5.  Reassemble the case and check out your work by plugging in the A.C.
     transformer.  You should see a DC voltage of the correct polarity on
     the empty 12VDC jack.
 
 If you have one of the old style XL power supplies, you can modify it in
 the same fashion as the above 1050 modification.  The regulators in the
 XL supply will properly reduce the 12VDC to the 5VDC needed by the
 computer and the change can be made for the price of a jack and a piece
 of wire.  I mounted my 12VDC input jack between the leads coming out of
 the old power supply.
 
 If you have to build your own supply then use the following wiring
 diagram:
 
                --------
               !        !
      +12VDC   ! LM317T !       +5.18VDC
      *---*----!        !----*------*----*
          !  IN!        !OUT !      !   (+)
          !    !        !    !      !   DIN
          !     --------     Z      !

          !        !         Z OHM  !
          !        !         !      !
          !        !         !      !
          !        *---------*     === 1.0
          !                  !      !   uf
          !                  !      !
          !                  Z      !
         === 0.1uf           Z 680  !
          !                  Z OHM  !
          !                  !      !
          !                  !      !
      *---*------------------*------*----*
      -battery                       (-)
                                         DIN
 
 Just in case the above diagram does not survive the file transmission
 and is out of alignment, the negative ground line is common across
 both the input and output voltages.
 
 The +12VDC input connects to the IN pin of the LM317.  The 0.1uf
 capacitor connects between the IN pin and ground.  The 1.0uf capacitor
 connects between the OUT pin and ground.  The 220 Ohm resistor connects
 between the ADJust pin and the OUT pin.  The 680 Ohm resistor connects
 between the ADJust pin and ground.  The +5.18VDC output is present on
 the OUT pin.
 
 As you can see, the circuit is a very simple one.  About the only place
 you can go wrong is in identifying the IN, OUT, and ADJ pins of the
 LM317.  Refer to the back of the package for the pin locations.  They
 are numbered in an odd fashion.
 
 The wiring for the DIN jack is shown on a label on the Atari Power
 Supply.  Compare the voltages with a voltmeter between the Atari supply
 and your new supply.  It is easy to get confused about which end of the
 connector you are looking at.  It is also easy to short out and destroy
 a power supply, so be careful with your test leads around the metal
 collar of the DIN plug.
 
 I used 2-conductor 18ga lamp cord for both the input and output lines
 on my supply.  Using an input jack on the computer power supply allowed
 me to bring the power from the cigar lighter out to three identical
 5.0mm O.D. coaxial plugs, one for the TV, one for the 1050, and one for
 the new 800XL supply.
 
 Now, a few words on choosing a portable AC/DC TV to use as a monitor.
 Don't expect much from a TV while on the road.  About the time someone
 gets interested in a program, you usually drive out of the station's
 range, and they don't have many stations out there in the boonies.  Try
 to get a TV with an all-channel scan feature.  This will enable you to
 find all of the available stations when you are far from home.
 
 A TV weather report now and then could save you a lot of trouble on the
 road.  One way of beating the lack of stations is to buy a set with a
 built in video tape player.
 
 As to size: A 9- set with a tape player looks pretty small in the store,
 but it is a real monster inside of your car.  Hopefully you have a motor
 home, or at least a van, otherwise you may want to get a 5- set.
 
 Well that should just about do it.  By now you should be out there in
 the car playing Donkey Kong.  Just remember, -Don't leave home without
 your joystick-!
 
 Parts List:
 
   2  274-1567   DC Power Plugs
   2  274-1565   DC Power Jacks
   1  274-335    Fused Lighter Plug
   1  270-1535   Lighter Plug Y-Adapter
   12 feet of    18ga 2-cond. lamp cord
 
 The above parts are all that you need if you can modify the old style
 XL supply.  If not, you need the following additional parts:
 
   1  276-1778   LM317T voltage regulator
   1  272-1432   0.1uf capacitor
   1  272-1434   1.0uf capacitor
   1  271-1313   220 Ohm resistor
   1  271-021    680 Ohm resistor
   1  276-159    Dual printed circuit bd.
   1  276-1372   Heat Sink Grease
   1  NA at RS   Heavy duty heat sink
                  (See text above)
   1  270-287    Power Supply Case
   1  274-029    7-pin DIN Plug
 
 You will need some small nuts and bolts to fasten the parts together.
 The screws that come with the DC Jacks are a little too short to be used
 in this application.
 
 Enjoy.

 * 2600 WHERE ARE YOU?                                     by Tim Duarte
 =======================================================================
 
 
 The following article is reprinted in Atari Explorer Online by
 permission of AtariUser magazine.  It MAY NOT be further reprinted
 without specific permission of AtariUser.  AtariUser is a monthly Atari
 magazine, available by subscription by calling (818) 332-0372.
 
 
 How were you first introduced to Atari?  Most Atari users will answer
 this question the same way, tracing their roots to the early days of
 video games.  You may have played one of those early Atari Pong machines
 on your television set.  You may remember a few game variations, but the
 systems were very limited.  The game ROMs were built-in, making it a
 dedicated video game system.
 
 The 2600 - The King of Video
 
 The Atari Video Computer System (VCS), later known as the Atari 2600 as
 well as the Sears VCS, turned many people on to video games, too.  The
 2600 was a dream come true for many wanna-be owners who shied away from
 the dedicated Pong systems.  Since the game ROMs were now stored in
 cartridges, it opened up a whole new world of video games that offered
 color and variety.
 
 As many of us upgraded and became excited about the potential of
 computers, the 2600 and other cartridge-based game systems seemed to
 become forgotten and obsolete.  Game software for Atari computers (then
 the 8-bit 400 and 800) began to flourish on cassette tape and floppy
 disk, as well as ROM cartridges.  Some owners decided to sell their
 system, others stored it away in a cellar or an attic, and despite it
 all, some remained loyal.  Underneath the success of home computers, the
 cartridge-based game market has remained alive.
 
 Atari released a number of systems to the gaming public.  The most
 popular, perhaps in all video game history, is the 2600 game system.
 Millions of these systems have been sold since its introduction in 1977.
 It also has an impressive library of games that some fans have
 calculated to number near 500.  To keep the 2600 from obsolescence,
 Atari planned an expansion kit called The Graduate.  It was a keyboard
 add-on unit that transformed the 2600 into a home computer.  The product
 was never released.
 
 In 1982, Atari released the 5200 game system, which was based on the
 same internal components as the Atari 400.  The system looked great on
 paper, but it didn't catch on with the general public.  It didn't have a
 large selection of games to choose from, and the joysticks were odd and
 very easy to break.  Still, the 5200, which offered graphics that
 compared to arcade versions, was well-received among many game players
 who chose not to upgrade to the home computers.
 
 The 7800 - the Super Machine that Almost Was
 
 The later Atari 7800 game system tried to make up for the mistakes that
 the 5200 made.  Without a need for adapters, the 7800 runs its own
 cartridges and is compatible with the hundreds of cartridges that were
 made for the 2600 and the dozens for the 5200.  The joysticks were an
 improvement on the standard Atari joystick, and the games created for
 the 7800 were even of a higher quality than the games for the 8-bit
 computers.  This system has a lot of potential, but it never seemed to
 catch on like the 2600 did.
 
 Atari then released the XE Game System.  The XEGS is essentially a 65XE
 8-bit computer in disguise.  It came packaged with a light gun and tried
 to contend with the 8-bit Nintendo and Sega Master System.  The XEGS
 came in third place out of the three and could not attract a large
 number of consumers who were impressed with the more detailed graphics
 (but inferior processing power) of Nintendo systems.
 
 We could consider the ST computers as part of the game evolution, but
 for our purposes here, we're really dealing with the machines that Atari
 intended to be -game machines,- not computers.  And for home consoles,
 Atari fell off of the crest of the game wave.
 
 Of course, the next step was the remarkable LYNX, and Atari has rumored
 first a PANTHER and now a JAGUAR advanced game console, to be released
 sometime next year.  Details are absolutely unavailable, and it's
 thought that even Atari hasn't decided what features will be in the
 final system.
 
 But the -classic- Atari gaming community has survived through all of
 this.  For a number of reasons, price and performance among them, many
 users are regaining interest in the older Atari systems.  In these days
 of 16-bit Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, the Atari systems remain in
 the shadows, but won't go away.  Longevity speaks for itself, and the
 2600 has been around for 15 years!
 
 And Yet It Lives...
 
 Only months ago, Atari released some hot new games for the 7800 -- Alien
 Brigade, Basketbrawl, Motor Psycho, Midnight Mutants, Planet Smashers,
 and Ninja Golf, to name a few.  Four titles -- Ikari Warriors,
 Motorodeo, Sentinel, and Xenophobe -- were also released for the 2600
 system.  And there's a huge variety of game cartridges available for all
 four Atari systems.
 
 The 2600 is popular in other countries, including England, Belgium,
 Australia, Japan, and Algeria.  I recently acquired Klax for the Atari
 2600 from a friend in Belgium.  Oddly enough, even while releasing new
 titles, Atari decided not to release Klax in the U.S.
 
 Unfortunately, as of Christmas 1991, Atari decided to discontinue the
 XEGS, 2600, and 7800 systems.  Much inventory was sold to Consolidated 
 Stores/Big Lots Stores, who have been selling brand new games at bargain
 prices -- $1 to $3 each.  How can you go wrong at this price?  Atari
 still has some games in stock, but not at such discounted prices.
 
 So, you've just bought a 2600, or you dug your 5200 out of the attic, or
 were given a 7800 system.  You're itching to blast some Space Invaders
 out of the sky, or play a few rounds of Pac-Man.  Where do you start?
 Most toy stores and video games stores have phased out their supply of
 -older- products, so if you find a nearby store that has a selection of
 Atari games, consider yourself lucky.  Otherwise, here are some mail
 order companies that sell 2600, 7800, 5200, and XEGS game cartridges and
 accessories through the mail:

 These companies are a good starting point, but you don't have to rely on
 mail order companies to find games for your Atari systems.  Atari games
 are also popular items at yard sales, flea markets, rummage sales,
 computer swap meets, thrift shops, pawn shops, and more.  Try scanning
 the -for sale- classified ads of your local newspaper and online
 bulletin board systems.  I've been trading games all over the United
 States and I'm building quite a large collection of games.
 
 Even though the 2600, 7800, 5200, and XEGS are no longer being
 manufactured, it doesn't mean the users who play these game systems will
 go away and vanish.
 
 Some folks regard the Atari game system as an ideal system for beginners
 and youngsters, while others are attracted to the economical and
 affordable prices of the systems and game cartridges when compared to
 Nintendo.  Atari systems are fun, simple to use, innocent, and fast.  No
 waiting for a disk to load into memory--just pop in a cartridge and
 play.
 
 Classic Game Support Groups
 
 Personally, I'm a big fan and supporter of the 2600.  Two years ago, I
 began research and wrote letters to other fans, and I discovered I was
 not alone.  There's many video gamers out there who support the Atari
 machines and show a lot of excitement about them.  There is definitely a
 need for the formation of clubs or user groups for these machines.
 
 In that vein, I started my own newsletter specifically to support the
 Atar VCS line.  -The 2600 Connection- newsletters average 8 to 16 pages,
 but they contain lots of interesting and useful information that you
 won't find in the professional magazines.  Each contain game reviews,
 game solutions and tips, letters and questions, classified ads, and
 more.  I've produced 11 bi-monthly issues of The 2600 Connection so far.
 A six-issue subscription is $6, and samples are available for $1 each.

 * GROWING UP WITH ATARI                                    By Bob Smith
 =======================================================================
 
 
 I have read many articles and magazines on computers, everything from
 building a mainframe to programing your cat's feeding time.  Seldom have
 I read how someone has progressed through the ranks from pure novice to
 actual productive use.  Hopefully, I'll convey some of that here.
 
 About six or seven years ago, we were having Thanksgiving dinner with my
 wife's family.  The usual topics were discussed and as the dinner wound
 down, my brother-in-law, who is heavily involved with computers as his
 vocation, started to discuss a home computer that he had just bought for
 about $800.  My father-in-law was captivated by this conversation and I
 just sat there, drinking my coffee, wondering how I was going to
 gracefully leave the table so I could get back to the major professional
 football game on TV.  The two of them were throwing around terms such as
 ROM, RAM, disk drive, etc., etc., and I was at a complete loss.
 
 Well, my wife, not to be outdone purchased the same type of computer
 that my brother-in-law had purchased previously.  That was my Christmas
 present that year, the very first time that I had an up close and
 personal visit with a home computer.  Oh, I didn't mention that these
 fine pieces of equipment, which could not do much in my eyes at that
 time were Atari 800's.
 
 On Christmas morning, I looked at this monster and wondered what in the
 blazes I was going to use it for.  Little did I know, years later that I
 would be so addicted to these wonderful machines that I would not only
 have a house full of them, but that I would use these Atari computers in
 one form or another in my business.
 
 As my father-in-law started to learn to use his, I couldn't help but be
 a little curious about what he was doing and I started to read.  I
 learned what those silly terms of ROM and RAM meant, learned how to
 change the cartridge in my trusty 800 and what basic and machine
 language meant.  Now please don't misunderstand me, I am in no way any
 type of genius but the ways of computing were starting to make some
 sense to me.
 
 To this I give full credit to that wonderful gentleman, my dad-in-law.
 Why?  Well, he just kept having me do all of the grunt work, like
 turning on the computer, looking stuff up in the various owner's manuals
 and programming books that we had.
 
 I want to jump ahead a few years now to when I starting to do basic
 programing and word processing.  My professional business is consulting
 and employee benefits, which entails a lot of proposals and
 presentations.  At the time, all of this was being done on the old
 typewriter and very slowly at that.  I started to wonder, why not try
 the old 800 in a business setting.  I took stock of the available
 programs available and settled on AtariWriter and several public domain
 database programs.  This was going to be a one machine experiment in the
 office for one week.  We had a particularly difficult proposal to do and
 what better way than to try the computer in this situation.
 
 I spent approximately 4 hours doing various formats for this proposal
 and then discarding them.  The major drawback was the 40 column screen,
 but with a little practice, that drawback was overcome.  Finally after
 several attempts a proposal format was designed and used with great
 success.  The young lady that was working with me at the time bluntly
 said that using the computer was the only way to go and she would never
 again use the old  typewriter.  To this day, that poor typewriter sits
 in a closet covered and holding up a pile of old forms.
 
 From that one week experiment, which has never ended, we have progressed
 to using multiple 8 Bit computers in our office.  We now use 130XE's
 with a variety of disk drives and printers.  One question I'm frequently
 asked is why not upgrade.......the answer that is given, is that a
 business must watch its expenses and if the current equipment is doing
 the job, why change.  We have offices in other states and the same
 philosophy is true there as well.  We do almost all of our operations
 from accounting to proposal preparation on these wonderful 8 bit
 machines.  Oh yes, we did get the client that we did that very first
 proposal for.
 
 As I started to use the computers in business, several events occurred
 almost simultaneously.  I became involved with the Mid-Florida Atari
 Computer Club and was given a 520 ST.
 
 Here I was just starting to feel very comfortable in my 8 Bit world,
 using my computers in business, learning to program, etc. and along
 comes a good friend, misguided, but non-the-less a good friend and tells
 me he is going into the world of another computer and would I like this
 poor 520ST.  Well, being the gracious person that I am and not wanting
 to hurt his feelings, I said OK.  Not long after that, he arrives at my
 home with several boxes and various cables, power supplies, disks and
 other things.
 
 I took a look at this and suddenly had a great deal apprehension and
 fear.  Why fear?  Well, having just gotten comfortable and on a first
 name basis with my 8 Bit equipment, what was I going to do with this
 monster and where was I going to put it.... I didn't verbalize my fears
 to my friend, not wanting to insult him in anyway, so I just put the
 boxes in my den in one corner and went on with my happy computer life
 and promptly forgot  about the ST and all of the related boxes, cables,
 disks, and other parts.
 
 About this time I had joined The Mid-Florida Atari Computer Club and met
 many experts in the ST field.  One of these people by the name of
 Tipton, who subsequently became a very good friend, came to my home one
 day and noticed the ST monitor sitting very forlonely sitting on my
 desk.  It was only there for lack of any other place to put it and he
 asked me  about it.  I explained the circumstances on how I came have it
 and all of it's related parts.  He looked at me with a gleam in his eye
 and said -let's fire it up-.  I replied, -no thanks, I really don't want
 to unpack everything-.  I really knew that if I did start to play with
 it, I might not want to stop, having previously experienced that with my
 trusty 8 Bit equipment.
 
 But Dave, being of the persuasive type that he is, talked me into just a
 'quick' bootup and then I could shut it down and put it away.  As you
 have probably guessed, from that inauspicious beginning, it has grown on
 me to the point that the 520 ST now sits side by side with my 8 Bit and
 is used for many tasks, not the least of which is my fetish for modeming
 and Bulletin Boards.  I still have a very long way to go, but there are
 a lot of excellent programs available for the ST and it is still
 supported rather well.  Atari Corporation sure does know how to make an
 excellent platform.  Oh yes, I never did get even with Dave for getting
 me hooked on the ST, but I guess I am really greatful.
 
 As I had briefly mentioned before, I got involved with the Mid-Florida
 Atari Computer Club (M.F.A.C.C.) very innocently.  I was invited to
 attend a meeting by a member named Carolyn Hoglin. Some of you may know
 the name from the articles that she has published in the late Antic
 Magazine and other newsletter publications. I attended this meeting and
 found many kindred spirits of the Atari world. I was rather quiet at
 first as I didn't want to open my mouth and show how dumb or naive I
 really was about computers, but these people put me at ease and included
 me in the meeting without making me feel like an outsider.
 
 I joined immediately and got somewhat involved in that first year, but
 little did I know that I would become totally immersed in the Club and
 some of the people who have since become good friends.  Finding people
 with a very common interest can be difficult, if not impossible, but
 here I was among a whole nest of them and I was as happy a computer with
 a brand new 100 megabite harddrive.
 
 As a direct result of being in the Club, I was and still am a part of
 the Newsletter staff.  I have learned a great deal on how a newsletter
 is put together and the tremendous effort and hardwork that goes into
 it.  I was elected president for three straight terms and as you read
 this, I have just finished that third year.  The club has been the
 catalyst for meeting some of the finest people that I have met in many
 years, such as Bob Brodie of the Atari Corporation.  That's an entire
 story in of itself and I'll cover that in the final installment of this
 trilogy in the next edition of Z*Magazine!

 Recently there was a write-in campaign to ralley support of an all 8-bit
 Atari magazine, The Atari Classics.  The effort seems to have been in
 vain.  Unicorn Publications, to where the campaige was directed, says it
 is definitely not going to split off what little 8-bit coverage it now
 offers to create Atari Classics, although would continue serving the 8-
 bit community as long as 8-bit users express interest.  Various opinions
 all have valid points.  Unicorn believes it is better to have more
 interaction between St and 8-bit owners, not less and it is better to
 treat St and 8-bit owners as equals rather than act if neither exists in
 the same reality.  There are just not enough developers and advertisers
 to support separate magazines.  How many 8bit only/16bit only
 publications have gone under in just the past year?  Unicorn's Aim
 presently carries both St and (some) 8-bit articles and disk of the
 month for both.

 While I agree with the rest of Bill and Pattie Rayl's editorial (there
 wasn't much to disagree with actually), I must pick on this little
 section.
 
 It amazes me, even though I do it sometimes, that they can criticize an
 Atari action even though they don't know all that's going on.  There was
 a definite reason for Atari moving Explorer to Sunnyvale and many
 suspect it is to gain greater control, lower cost, and it even makes
 sense to have the house mag run from headquarters.
 
 I like John Jainschigg a lot.  I'm sorry to see him leave the magazine,
 since he did an excellent job.  I worked with him on an editor/author
 basis and he is one cool dude. :^)  I worry what will become of Explorer
 after John's last issue, but I know that Bob Brodie and others at Atari
 will do their best to fill the position.

 YES!  There have been four issues of AEO so far, and they're only
 distributed bi-weekly.  The next one should be out this weekend.  I
 believe they're distributed on Usenet/Internet via the same mailing list
 which distributed Z*Net.  Unfortunately, I don't know what the mail
 address is to get a subscription; hopefully someone else can help us
 out.

 Well, Soap Box Attack so you can hit stop reading anytime. Patty Rayl
 addressed this & the demise of another ST only mag in the latest issue
 of AIM.  When I read about the demise of the 'other' ST mag I was
 touched by how sensitive & rational her comments were.  On reading the
 Classic comments; I was a little upset.  AIM is right in their covering
 all Atari products, but the 1st and last shot for exclusion was NEVER
 fired by 8-bitters.  All you have to do is read this forum to figure out
 we have everybody from 2600 to ST, IBM, etcetera in here.  Go to the
 freaking ST sig & mention anything but an ST & see what happens.  It
 almost make me embarassed to own an ST!  You get comments like
 [obsolete, get a ST, get out of this sig].  Patty's right in that the
 Atari community is all things Atari & common interest such as people
 dropping by to ask about what modem to buy for their clone, but 1/2 of
 the ST users have serious emotional difficulty with anything other then
 an ST.  You don't really have to worry about an 8-bit mag being split 
 off AIM.  As I see it, one of two things will happen:
 
 1) ST users complain about to much Lynx, 8-bit, etc news & leave.
 2) The ratio of 8-bit to ST submissions will go up to the point where it
 will seem like an 8-bit mag.
 
 We really need to get rid of about 1/2 the ST users out there.  They're
 causing 90% of the problems in the Atari world.  Sheesh!  Even Bob
 Wooley owns & works on an ST!  Does that stop him from being a Club
 pres & doing 8-bit stuff?  He works on IBM mainframes for a living.  he
 could just say anything with less then a 64 bit data buss sucks, but he
 doesn't.  I know from my own point of view, anybody that wants to be
 here is welcome.
 
 It would be great to see if any other SIG could make that boast.  Right
 now if you look at AIM the article break down goes something like: 60%
 ST software review 30% 8-bit umbrella [soft/hard/tutorial] 10% general
 [lynx, portfolio, news]  I wish Atari Corp all the sucess in the world,
 but it'd be interesting to see if new software for the ST dries up what
 they'll have to talk about.
 
 The only mistake Jeff & Ben may have made was not waiting until the ST
 letters to the Editors asking to drop 8-bit coverage piled up.  Well,
 FLAME OFF!

 UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 The last Update was posted to the Net around the end of May but many
 people did not see it as I was experiencing difficulty with my USENET
 connection, so it went directly to naucse then out to the Internet.  My
 apologies.  I will try to bring everyone up to speed on the past 7
 week's developments.
 
 Following the official close of the mail-in Campaign on May 2 &
 subsequent dissolution of the Campaign Committee, Jeff McWilliams
 shipped me all the cards he had received as of the first week of May.
 (During the first week of June he also sent me a 2nd shipment of cards,
 consisting of late returns/stragglers.)
 
 The final count of returned cards was just under 600, the number 580
 comes to mind.
 
 I spent a couple weeks sorting all the cards into alphabetical order,
 reading all the comments on every single one, and taking notes.  Jeff
 McWilliams also sent me a copy of the Campaign database; at the moment
 there is a problem with merging in the final batch of respondents but he
 is working on that & expects to have it squared away soon.
 
 With notes in hand, during the last week of May I commenced work on AC's
 Publication Manifest, a document that describes in detail our proposal
 for the organization and functions of the magazine.  This turned out to
 be a non-trivial task.  It took 5 weeks.  My barber noted an unusual of
 grey hair on my head...
 
 The Manifest was completed June 28.  It was submitted to Unicorn
 Publications early today for their consideration.  There has as yet been
 no response, but of course it's very early & the Manifest runs 38K of
 text, so it will take them awhile to digest it all.  With the submission
 of this document to Unicorn, the pledge made by the Campaign Committee
 to submit our ideas to them has been fulfilled.  The ball is now in
 their court, we are awaiting a response, & we naturally are very
 anxious.  The next few weeks will no doubt be very critical to the birth
 of AC, as delicate political and financial arrangements are debated
 until both sides achieve a resolution of their respective concerns.
 
 At the moment I am very optimistic that a positive resolution of
 concerns will be obtained, leading to production of the Premier Issue of
 Atari Classics.
 
 Within the past few weeks a few irresponsible individuals have taken the
 proposals set forth in the Campaign literature, allowed their paranoid
 fears to run rampant, and expressed their concerns directly to Unicorn.
 If these people had instead expressed their concerns directly to the
 Chairman of the mail Campaign, Jeff McWilliams, he could have dispelled
 their fears in short order.  The main thrust of the concern seems to be
 loss of 8bit coverage in AIM by splitting it off as suggested in the
 Campaign letter.
 
 Individuals who own both 8bit & ST machines are not happy about this, &
 Unicorn has strongly rejected the idea of removing 8bit coverage from
 AIM.
 
 This issue was a subject of considerable discussion within the Committee
 even while the Campaign was in progress, & by the time the Campaign
 ended we had pretty much arrived at the same conclusion ourselves: i.e.,
 that there should be continued 8bit coverage in AIM pretty much as it
 has been, perhaps with a certain amount of shared material between the
 two publications.  This would satisfy the demand for an 8bit-only
 publication while not forcing those who are satisfied with AIM in its
 present format to make an unhappy either/or type of choice.  So, in
 effect, we of the Atari Classics movement are in agreement with the
 position taken by Unicorn & tend to view the recent hubub as much ado
 about nothing.  I would point out that whereas the number of these type
 negative responses to the Atari Classics effort is fewer than 10, I
 maintain it is a decidedly minority opinion compared to the nearly 600
 positive- even rabid- responses the Campaign garnered.
 
 Recent posts to the Net seem to suggest that Unicorn's rejection of
 splitting off 8bit coverage into AC constitutes a rejection of the
 entire Atari Classics movement.  Not true!  In their response per the
 June AIM, Bill & Pattie made their position clear & left the door open
 for the exploration of possibilities related to our effort.  As far as I
 am aware, relations between AC & Unicorn remain cordial, both parties
 have contined to express interest in discussing proposals, & we have
 exploited the open door by finally submitting our detailed plans for
 their consideration.
 
 Dealing with this tempest-in-a-teapot has had the effect of siphoning
 off my time & energy that should have been devoted full-time to AC.  It
 strikes me ironic that so far the greatest threats to the success of
 this admittedly shaky enterprise have arisen from the ranks of the 8bit
 community itself.
 
 Idle & irresponsible speculation will only damage our cause.  I urge
 everyone to please exercise restraint & be patient.  Have faith that we
 are doing the best we can to fulfill the promise of the Campaign & bring
 into being a unique user-based 8bit-only publication.  These are very
 very anxious & critical times for all of us who support the movement.
 
 I said this before, I'll say it again:

 What's the difference? Atari Explorer is ALREADY a puppet of Atari Corp,
 whether located in Sunnyvale or New Jersey.  The way they take two years
 to review a product, or the way they rip off their advertisers by
 accepting payments for advertising space in non-existant issues sounds
 a lot to me like the same kind of incompitency that plauges Atari Corp.
 I'm still trying to recover money from them for an ad that was to have
 appeared in a non-existant issue from last year!  I keep getting the
 same kind of -the check is in the mail- runaround that I'm more than
 used to getting from Atari Corp. Interestingly enough, Atari Explorer
 deposits its checks not in New York or New Jersey, but directly into
 Atari US Corp's account at the Wells Fargo bank in Sunnyvale.  After 6
 months of phone calls and promises, I am now told that I need to resolve
 the problem with the folks in Sunnyvale.  So as far as I'm concerned, it
 doesn't matter whether Atari Explorer is located in Sunnyvale, New York,
 or Upper Tibet, they are still just a useless propoganda machine for
 Atari Corp.
 
 BOYCOTT ATARI EXPLORER! Support AIM, ST Informer, Current Notes, Atari
 User, Atari Advantage, PSAN, and all of the other publications that
 actually do something constructive.

 I'm sorry guys, you'll have to forgive me if I mis-read your thoughts
 about this issue.
 
 I'm a little confused.  People have cited our June issue, and the
 comments in it about the Atari Classics campaign.  I don't see how that
 leads to  the idea of no 8bit only publication.  What Bill and I were
 saying is how we feel AIM represents a lot of varied readers, so we
 would not be willing to turn AIM into an ST only mag.  AIM coverage
 would continue as it has over the last several years, picking up
 Portfolio and Lynx along the way.
 
 One person was upset over the languag we used.  That is understandable,
 since we a little surprised at the kit when we saw one (after the
 campaign was over), when the kit said we would split AIM up.  We were a
 little taken aback at the presumptions it seemed the campaign was
 taking! :)  Bill and I sent off a letter very similar to the nots in AIM
 to Ben and Jeff, explaining our thoughts on the whole subject.  Ben got
 back to us, explaining how that phrasiology (sp?) happened to get into
 the kit, and that en and Jeff felt very much as Billand I did/do.

 (please forgive the typos -- I'm typing faster than the net can handle,
 it seems)
 
 So, everything is fine.
 
 I just got Ben's maifest today, and we'll be getting back wih him as
 soon as we look it over and make our suggestions/changes.
 
 Again, if I misunderstood the messages, please forgive me, since I'm
 relatively new to the UseNet.  In fact, we made an effort to get on the
 net because of the Atari Classics discussion/campaign.

 Ed,
 
 I don't completely understand your criticism of what Bill and I said in
 the Editorial Rampblings for June.  Granted, there may be times when no
 one can no the actual reasons Atari does stuff unlss they work in
 Sunnyvale (and not even then, in which case, you'd have to look in Sam
 or Jack's mind!).
 
 However, I think we have a better than average chance of figuring what
 those reasons could be.  I guess the biggest complaint would be, If it's
 not brroken, why mess with it?
 
 You say Atari would gain more control over Atari Explorer by moving it
 in house.  Atari officials (mostly Bob Brodie, I think) already ok each
 and every page of AE efore it's printed.  To me, that's a lot of control
 already.
 
 You suggest Atari could save money.  Atari Explorer isn't printed in NY,
 but PA.  If atari kept the same printer, and there's no reason to think
 they'd change, thre's no savings there.  Sure, they wouldn't have to pay
 John, but in exchange, they have to pay someone who lives in CA, with a
 very high cost of liivingrate.  Moving AE inhouse also means Atari has
 to get new art directors and graphics artists, which John already had on
 staff, not to mention new support personnel like an advertising persons.
 And, adding those new people are all on the assumption Sam's willing to
 pay for new employees when there've been big layoffs.  The gossip going
 around now is that Sam's not even willing to authorize the salary for
 an editor, and I know one person can not put out an Atari explorer
 alone.
 
 My view is clear: I think AE should be left in John Jainschigg's hands.
 If any one else would like to get me on the soap box, please join in!

 Chu,
 
 Yes, Newell Industries still sells two Operating system ROMS, the
 Omniview 256 and the Omnimon XL.  The first has a built in 80 column E:
 handler, similar to what you get when running vt10squared, Omnicom, or
 Kermit65.  It also has a built in Ramdisk handler for Newell 256K
 upgrades, and a monitor program called ATRMON, which was used for
 running CPM on the ATR8000 in 80 columns.
 
 My friend uses it for his ATR8000 is CPM every now and then and he
 really likes it.  The Omniview 256 also uses the older 800 version of
 the OS, to solve those compatibility problems with some software.  It
 also can automatically copy the OS into the RAM under the OS ROM area,
 for whatever reason you would want to do this.
 
 The Omnimon XL chip is also an 800 OS, and has a very nice machine
 language monitor/debugger built in.

 GCR OWNERS REJOICE - MacSEE from Reeve Soft
 Will every GCR user who has had problems moving files between their ST
 and Mac-emulation partitions, please raise your hand.  Just as I
 thought, there are lots of us.  We move between the ST world and the Mac
 world and struggle to transport files easily and quickly between the
 two.  Transverter is -okay-, but it only works with MFS formatted disks
 and partitions ... and as you well know, EVERYTHING is in HFS format!
 But now you have an alternative!
 
 I was just given a pre-release copy of a new program for the Atari ST
 and TT systems.  The program is called -MacSEE- and is created by Reeve
 Soft.  Simply put, the program allows you to move files between your ST
 and a Macintosh (or GCR/Mac-emulated partitions) with complete ease and
 efficiency.  MacSEE lets you --
 
 * Read Macintosh (HFS & MFS) volumes with your Atari ST or TT
 * Write to Macintosh volumes with your Atari ST or TT
 * Read and write 800K Spectre-format disks & 1.44-megabyte disks
 
 PLUS, MacSEE supports --
 
 * MacBinary and translated modes
 * Spectre format hard disk partitions
 * Macintosh format hard disk partitions
 
 And MacSEE can be used on a wide range of removable devices, including
 SyQuest hard disks.
 
 After using the program for a few hours, I found it to do everything it
 promised ... and flawlessly!  It's completely GEM-drive, so all you do
 is -click- through the choices, select the file you want moved from a
 standard item selector window, and BOOM -- Done!  No fuss, no strain, no
 pain ... just simple efficiency.  And in comparison to Transverter,
 MacSEE is a speed demon!  Hard drive partition to partition copying took
 no time at all.  Partition to floppy was just as fast a copying a
 standard ST file.
 
 Distribution and technical support for MacSEE is being handled by:
 
 Compu-Seller West
 220 1/2 West Main Street
 St. Charles, Il 60174  (708) 513-5220
 
 To order your copy of MacSEE, or for more information, call CompuSeller
 West at 708-513-5220 and ask for Don Bahr.  Tell him -Monochrome Steve-
 sent you!
 
 
 CHICAGO COMPUTERFEST '93 CANCELLED
 Chicago ComputerFest by Atari 1993, a continuation of the successful
 cooperative venture between the Lake County (Illinois) Atari Computer
 Enthusiasts and Atari Corporation, planned for May 15 and 16th 1993 at
 the Ramada Hotel O'Hare has been cancelled.  Director of Communications,
 Bob Brodie, stated that he expected to only make show appearances for
 the remainder of 1992, for which Atari has already purchased non-
 refundable discount airline tickets for him.  LCACE enjoyed the
 partnership with Atari to bring major Atari-oriented developers and
 vendors to the Midwest, and is disappointed that Atari is apparently
 unable to commit support of this event.  LCACE is uncertain if they will
 organize a local-oriented show such as the two shows prior to the 1991
 ComputerFest.
 
 
 KAO UNVEILS NEW BRANDED DISKETTE PACKAGING
 Kao has unveiled its new branded diskette packaging which is intended to
 enhance the company's strong and growing position in the branded
 diskette market.  Kao's new tiered packaging approach clearly
 differentiates diskette capacity for the user.  The double-density
 diskettes, in silver packaging, are designed for users requiring a
 standard-density product; the high-density diskettes, in gold, have
 twice the storage capacity of the standard-density diskettes.  The new
 packaging features a -100 Percent Certified- seal, highlighting that
 each diskette is individually tested for error-free performance.  Each
 diskette package also features a -Made in the USA- or -Made in Canada-
 logo emphasizing that the diskettes were produced locally.
 
 
 OS/2 2.0 SURPASSES ONE MILLION
 IBM announced that its new software product, OS/2 Version 2.0, has
 vaulted past the one million shipment mark.  Historically popular with
 corporate users, early indications are that OS/2 is also gaining
 widespread acceptance in the end-user community as a result of its
 power, reliability and ease-of-use.  To commemorate their on-going
 support and commitment to OS/2, Caterpillar was presented with the one
 millionth copy at the Windows & OS/2 Show at Boston's World Trade
 Center, August 18-21.  Between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31, 1992, users who call
 the 1-800-3-IBM-OS2 phone number can purchase OS/2 for the following
 prices: Windows upgrade $79; DOS upgrade $99 and first time buyers $149.
 OS/2 is an advanced 32-bit operating system that supports DOS, Windows
 and OS/2 applications in a single package.
 
 
 ADOBE SHIPS 22 NEW TYPEFACE PACKAGES
 Adobe announced the availability of 22 new typeface software packages

  6. Programming Forum... 
     Led by the Atari SIG's programmer-in-residence, Peter Haller
 
 The 8-bit is still a popular choice among programmers.  The 8-bit Atari
 computers allow for a level of control over the hardware that is both
 straight-forward and powerful.  Even though these machines have gone out
 of production, the dedicated user base support these machines.  This
 forum is for those programmers - both novice and the die-hard hackers
 - to share secrets, ideas, problems, and remember the 'good ol'e days'.
 
 The 8-Bit Programming Forum is broken down into the following areas:
 
 1. About this Forum - You're reading it!
 
 2. 8-Bit Programming FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) List - the name
    says it all!  This will hopefully release the open forums from the
    simple and common questions that newcommers have.  This list will be
    updated at the beginning of every month.
 
 3. Resource Center - This is where you will find code samples, helpful
    hints, and the best PD development tools info, among other things.
    Post your neat little hacks in here for all to enjoy.  If a group
    project ever gets started, then this is where all the code will be
    placed.  This is a moderated area, so we can keep it clean.  This
    newsgroup may eventually expand into a submenu depending on the
    amount of information it contains.
 
 4. 8-Bit Hacking Board - This is the catch all area.  Any programming
    related questions - from BASIC to Assembly - will be fair game here.
    This area is unmoderated, so watch the language.
 
 5. The Asylum - Grab a Jolt and call up Dominos!  This is the General
    Programmers Forum of the Atari SIG.  All programmers are welcome.
    Take a browse, flame at your machine, or just listen in on Atari
    related programming subject.  This is totally and completely
    unmoderated, so if you can't take it...
 
 6. Product Summaries - A place for 8-bit users to share shorter product
    summaries which make obtaining a new product that much less of a
    hassle
 
 7. Product Reviews - One of the biggest assets of the 8-bit area.  This
    board holds reviews of many of the most popular products available
    for the 8-bit Atari (and some of the duds too).  Check here before
    making your purchase, or write reviews for the SIG for the benefit of
    others.
 
 8. Tips & Tricks - A place for you to share those neat little things
    you've discovered while using your computer that make the system even

 | | |  DUSSELDORF REPORT
 | | |  Story by John Nagy, Courtesy AtariUser Magazine
 | | |  ----------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Copyright (c)1992, AtariUser Magazine.  MAY NOT BE REPRINTED WITHOUT
 WRITTEN PERMISSION OF QUILL PUBLISHING.
 
 
 Atari's Newest Machine is introduced in German Atari Fair
 
 The floor of the world's largest annual Atari fair had -Falcons all over
 the floor of the show, in almost every booth,- according to Nathan
 Potechin of DMC Publishing, Inc., who gave AtariUser eyewitness accounts
 during the show.  Other estimates said that about 20 Falcons were
 roosting throughout the sprawling conference center.  Many show-goers
 thought they were looking at regular 1040's since the Falcons on display
 were not black as originally thought.
 
 The Dusseldorf, Germany locale for Atari Messe was again inundated with
 Atari--the huge trade show spans roughly four football fields of floor
 space.  Nathan reported that the show this year (August 21-23) is
 similar in size and attendance to last year's event, which brought
 30,000 of the faithful to visit 180 vendors.
 
 The announcement of the Falcon 030 was the first order of business at
 Dusseldorf.  The crowds knew what they were coming to see after months
 of nearly-accurate profiles of the coming machine were offered by most
 of the Atari media, and the excitement was high as they saw it
 firsthand.
 
 However, numerous reports have been made by developers and attendees
 that indicate that the Falcon is not quite ready to fly.  While many
 existing software products are said to run flawlessly and swiftly,
 reports of spectacular crashes when running software already loaded on
 the demo units hard drives blemished the premier.
 
 In any case, many vendors at AtariMesse had new applications that
 exposed the power and features that are new on the Falcon 030.  DMC
 Publishing (Calamus) again had the largest booth on the floor, spanning
 4,000 square feet with about 40 people working in it alone.  Other large
 booths included TMS, Matrix, 3K, and Maxxon.  Many new products were
 shown, and AtariUser will report on them in detail in our next issue.
 
 Prices and Plans
 
 The -base- Falcon 030 will retail for $799 in the USA in a one-megabyte
 configuration.  The next option up the scale will be a four-megabyte RAM
 Falcon with 65 megabyte hard drive at $1,399.  Availability in the US is
 slated for -October- in limited quantities.  The FCC type acceptance for
 domestic sales is not yet in hand, but is predicted to be a sure thing
 this time, due to extensive tests done in-house at Atari.
 
 Marketing plans for the new machine in the USA were also revealed in
 Germany.  Sam Tramiel told dealers and developers at Atari Messe that
 the US launch will be via regional marketing build-ups.  Individual
 regions of the USA will be targeted, one at a time, with major -dog and
 pony shows- to both woo and educate computer dealers.  Significant co-op
 advertising money will be offered to dealers who join in the roll-out.
 Once enough regions are served by a new operating dealer network, Atari
 will launch a national advertising campaign.
 
 Industry observers suggest that this plan will make the most of Atari's
 cash and production resources.  By serving a small but growing dealer
 network with product, on-board Falcon dealers can be more assured of
 delivery of product during the build-out stages of the plan.  Dealers
 will help and be helped in promotional costs, enabling Atari to make a
 bigger splash in smaller ponds with less of their own money, and
 allowing Atari's resources to go towards increasing production of Falcon
 computers.  As production and sales increase, so will revenues with
 which to attack new regions.  Meanwhile, Falcon specific software will
 mature and present a solid base for the later national marketing
 efforts, to come in 1993.
 
 The Word on the Bird
 
 Atari's CEO Sam Tramiel made conference appearances on the GEnie and
 Delphi telecommunication networks the week before AtariMesse, giving the
 fans worldwide a chance to -talk- to him -live.-  Communicating via
 modem to the conferences, the audience could ask questions directly of
 Sam and the Atari technical team, and get answers in real time.  The
 result was the best look we've had to date at the intention and
 potential of Atari and the new Falcon.
 
 The corporate view of the Falcon 030 is that it exceeds all of the
 multimedia expectations of the computer buying public, while being an
 exceptional value as a home computer system.  Sam took fire on the
 conferences over the 1040 style case, which is seen by some as a curse.
 Sam reiterated the Atari position that the Falcon 030 is the consumer/
 introductory unit of a new series of computers, and alluded to a 68040
 to come, but would say no more.
 
 Conversely, Sam Tramiel said of sales and advertising of the current
 line of Atari computers: -We felt that the present ST/STE family was not
 strong enough to market in the US.  We have been waiting for this new
 product, and we do plan to support it and market it in the US.  It will
 be a hard battle, but we will put a good effort behind it.-  He added
 that the STe and especially the TT lines will continue to be produced
 and supported.
 
 More:

 ||| MultiTOS is a combination of rom and disk based software.  Most well
     written applications seem to work fine.  MultiTOS will be available
     as an upgrade for the TT030 and future 68030 and above machines.
 
 ||| Bundled software will be packaged with the Atari Falcon030 will
     include games written especially for the Atari Falcon030, including
     LandMines and a BreakOut kind of game.  There will also be a Rolodex
     type of application called Cal/Apt, a calculator application called
     ProCalc, and a Talking Clock desk accessory.
 
 ||| New STe compatible analog joysticks will have 15 buttons, with three
     fire buttons and a 12 key keypad.
 
 ||| A true expansion bus via a direct processor slot with all of the
     necessary data and control lines to allow plugging in optional third
     party coprocessor boards.  This will allow more complete PC and Mac
     emulators, for example.
 
 ||| According to Sam, there are some 30 new developers that are
     producing software for the Atari Falcon.  Several of the developers
     are also NeXT developers.
 
 ||| Contrary to a few scare rumors, the MIDI and cartridge ports are
     still standard.  However, there is no external floppy connector for
     a second disk drive, and no ACSI/DMA port for Atari brand hard
     drives and laser printers.  Sam explains that Atari opted for the
     industry standard and faster SCSI II.  Third party companies have
     developed converter boxes to allow the SLM printers to connect to
     the Atari Falcon 030.
 
 Memory Matters
 
 The Falcon 030 can have 1, 4 or 14 megabytes of RAM.  The memory is
 addressed continuously, and any application or MultiTOS can see all the
 memory at once.  Memory upgrades will be through a -Atari Falcon- ram
 board.  There are no memory controllers on the board like on the TT, and
 Atari's pricing on the RAM will be -very competitive.-  The RAM in the
 Falcon is 32-bit wide, and the limited total RAM configurations allow
 faster memory access than other multiples.
 
 Why 14 instead of 16 or more megabytes?  In order to maintain a high
 degree of compatibility with ST software, a 16 meg window was maintained
 despite the ability of the 68030 chip to -see- far more memory.  The top
 two meg of the 16 meg a 68000 is capable of addressing are mapped as I/O
 device handling areas, so they are not used by the Falcon either.  The
 result is a lot of RAM that is used just like ST memory instead of the
 switching scheme used in the TT.
 
 Sightings

 The Atari Falcon030 will work with any VGA, or Atari ST Color Monitor...
 SC1224 or SC1435.  The 16 bit True Color (non-palette) mode will work in
 640 x 480 interlaced on a TV or ST style monitor.  A special cable will
 let you use an older ST monitor.  True Color will also work in 320 x 480
 on VGA monitors.  The BLiTTER Chip has been sped up to 16 MHz to handle
 the extra bandwidth and does double duty for fast hard drive access.
 
 The Falcon 030 is easily -Genlockable- for multimedia and TV use; a
 cheap third-party external device is required to strip the sync from the
 external signal.
