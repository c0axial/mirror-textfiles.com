 Z*NET; WHERE ARE WE, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

 by Ron Kovacs and John Nagy
 
 Anniversaries... they make us think about the past and the Future.
 
 Ron Kovacs is about to begin his SEVENTH YEAR of weekly online
 publishing for Atari users.  March marks the beginning of our third year
 of Z*NET MONTHLY, our hard-copy newsletter supplement that has served
 over 50 user groups world-wide.
 
 ROVAC INDUSTRIES, Inc. was legally incorporated in 1989 in the State of
 New Jersey by Ron Kovacs for the purpose of furthering what had, until
 then, been a solo, totally volunteer effort to bring Atari users the
 best information available.  John Nagy became a regular contributor,
 editor of the monthly newsletter, and staff manager for the growing
 number of -Z*projects-.  The online magazine remains to this day to be
 100% volunteer supported, non-commercial and non-profit.
 
 In 1990, -Z*NET International Atari Online Magazine- became the single
 name for what had been ZMAGAZINE and ST*ZMAGAZINE.  Distribution of the
 weekly electronic magazine under Ron's editorship was on CompuServe,
 GEnie, Delphi, USENET, and over 600 registered carrying private
 bulletin board systems.  Later in 1990, Z*NET entered the FNET system
 and has primary distribution to 50 FNET BBS systems... and ultimately to
 perhaps thousands more independent BBS systems around the world.  Z*Net
 maintains staff writers in the USA, Canada, England, Germany, New
 Zealand, and Japan, with correspondents in many other countries.

 On GEnie alone, JUST the 1990 Z*NET issues have been downloaded 30,000
 times (thirty THOUSAND!), with another 8 THOUSAND downloads of related
 files, pictures, Z*BREAK news bulletins, etc.  This made Z*NET the
 NUMBER ONE ONLINE MAGAZINE and the most prolific of ALL GEnie
 contributors in 1990!  We are convinced that part of what makes us
 respected and popular is Z*NET's continued resolve not to preach, push,
 pirate, or pander.

 During 1990, Z*NET continued to evolve.  First, the Z*NET NEWS SERVICE
 was featured as a regular contributor to the German magazine PD JOURNAL.
 Later, Z*NET NEWS SERVICE was recognized by several British Atari
 magazines, and was also quoted as an original source in reports
 appearing in non-computer-specific national news services.  Reprints or
 quotes of Z*NET articles appear regularly in almost every user-group
 newsletter and have also appeared in many commercial publications
 including COMPUTER SHOPPER, ST INFORMER, ST WORLD, CURRENT NOTES, AIM,
 PSAN NEWS, and while in publication, ANALOG, ST-LOG, and ANTIC.  In
 1990, Z*NET became a continuing column in ST JOURNAL magazine, then moved 
 to become the exclusive news agency for START, the largest US Atari magazine.

 Z*NET was first with major Atari stories.  The 32mHz TT, Elie Kenan
 resigning, layoffs, the MEGA STE introduction, and more stories were
 broken by Z*NET special reports.  Even though many of those stories were
 denied vigorously by Atari officials and decried by other publications,
 each of them came to be shown as true, accurate, fair, and FIRST.  By
 Z*NET's writers doing on-site reporting at major Atari events, including
 live mini-conferences and pictures of the shows, often while they were
 still in progress, Z*NET's credibility had crystallized; it had become
 widely accepted that, if it was reported by Z*NET, you could depend on it.

 That's not to say that we were always right... occasionally we reported
 what was in fact true at the time of the report, only to have situations
 change.  And of course, we occasionally really blow it, and make a plain
 error in interpretation or timing.  We also have inadvertently angered
 the occasional developer, dealer, user group, or Atari official with our
 reporting of things that might not always put them in the best light.
 But we haven't been shy about owning up to errors in reporting as soon
 as they were detected, nor about offering reply space for any irritated
 reader.  And yes, we've been threatened with lawsuits on several occasions.  
 None, it turns out, have actually been filed, despite continued harassment.

 Also in 1990 and since, Ron Kovacs began several Atari and non-Atari
 projects under the Z*NET auspices:

 *  Z*NET MECHANICS ONLINE NEWSLETTER was the first, offering the proven
    format of the online publication to automobile mechanics, both
    professional and amateur.  Gatewat Associates, a development company
    formed by Bruce Kennedy, the original Z*Magazine editor and founder,
    has been the co-publisher/editor of the publication since the start.
    The MECHANICS ONLINE may be continuing or may change format and
    distribution in support of a commercial sales effort of completely
    databased auto service bulletins.
 
 *  Z*NET MACINTOSH ONLINE MAGAZINE had a trial run and is being
    considered for continued status.

 *  Z*NET PC ONLINE MAGAZINE has just been test released, and is enjoying
    remarkable startup success and favorable commentary, despite some
    very vociferous complaints from Atari users who believe that it shows
    Z*NET is abandoning Atari.

 *  Z*NET ATARI CD-ROM DISK was planned and prepared, but is currently on
    hold due to the unavailability of Atari CD-ROM players.  If that
    situation reverses, the Z*NET disk will offer a terrific collection
    of many hundred megs of Atari software, pictures, animations, sounds,
    and information.

 ... and there is more that we just aren't ready to discuss!
 
 Also, lets not forget Z*MAGAZINE.  The online publication that started
 it all.  Back in May 1986, regular weekly editions, released locally as
 NEW JERSEY ZMAG started and ran weekly until the end of 1989.  In late
 1990, we re-started the publication and release on a monthly basis to
 die-hard 8-Bit Atarians.  There are 190 editions of ZMagazine available
 in BBS archives and by request.

 Keep in mind that the ROVAC/Z*NET effort is entirely a -hobby- on many
 levels... each of us involved have a -real- full time job, and do
 Z*stuff on our own tabs on our own time.  Only a few of our enterprises
 actually pay for themselves.  Some regular readers seem to forget that
 and are less than charitable when Z*NET is not available for them quite
 -on time-, or when the Z*NET BBS is down for a while due to waiting
 hardware repairs or PHONE BILLS to be paid!

 What will the future bring for Z*NET?  No, we are NOT abandoning Atari
 despite new activity in other areas.  Z*NET International Atari Online
 Magazine will continue to be published as long as there is Atari news
 that deserves impartial telling.  It may be that the staff will change
 somewhat, but Ron Kovacs will remain the publisher and will retain final
 editorial supervision.  Z*NET MONTHLY will continue under the editorship
 of John Nagy, supplementing user group newsletters until or unless it
 becomes unnecessary or impractical.  And our other projects will
 continue to expand... to take up every spare minute of time available!

 But Z*NET Atari Online remains as our center, our touchstone and
 template for all our other projects.  In some ways, the weekly magazine
 is the engine that keeps all of our other projects in motion.  We WON'T
 be dropping it in the foreseeable future.

 We DO need to solicit for more input, more contributors, and even more
 -permanent- staff members.  So, readers, consider yourselves solicited.
 You can reach us to volunteer your talents (and heck, we wouldn't turn
 down offers of hardware or cash, either!) via EMAIL, US mail, or phone.
 The relevant numbers are at the top and bottom of every issue of Z*NET.
 
 And Thanks for Reading!  Your appreciation is our greatest reward.

 Now let's begin our seventh year together...

 We have ordered PD disks from Bellcom in the past and it is (in my

 and the guy that runs it seems to be very nice.  I had a problem a few
 years back with one of the disks I had ordered and not only did he
 replace it (promptly) but sent another disk to make up for any
 inconvenience.  Bellcom gets an A+ from me.

 Rumor Mill
 ----------
 Two rumors that I have seen around:

 Rumor #1 - Atari will be coming out with a new line of 8-bits.  (This
 one first Cropped up on my Networked Message base, and things got a
 little out of hand!  It started looking like a convention of Wouldn't it
 be Nice If...-)

 Rumor #2 - Atari has sold the rights to the 8-bits!

 These seemed a *little* contradictory.  Having been an Atarian for a
 while, it did seem 'possible' that one of these could be viable! <Grin>

 Well, its not April 1st yet.  These were checked into, and...

  >>>neither one has *ANY* substance to it!<<<

 Atari 8-bit Inter-BBS Networking?
 ---------------------------------
 More than one person is rumored to be 'looking into the feasibility of
 the various 8-bit BBS programs networking with each other, and possibly
 even Forem-ST boards.

 The 8-bit programs of which I am aware of that are now 'capable' of
 networking are: FoReM-XEP, Express! Pro, Oasis, and Puff II BBS.  There
 may be more, but I don't know about them - yet!  Of these, only FoReM-
 XEP and Express! Pro can -thread- their networked message bases.

 Some of the problems which need to be overcome are: different methods
 and protocols used, different maximum message sizes, different
 procedures used for Networking, and the different formats of the packets.

 I will try to find out more information about this and pass it on in a
 future article.

 New Stuff Coming?
 -----------------
 Black Box owners might have an alternative to the R-Time 8 cartridge.
 Nothing -firm- on this yet, but the concept has been investigated, and
 is being pursued.  Hopefully, it will come to fruitation.  At this point
 it will only be for BB owners though.

 A New Version of Express! Professional will be released shortly!  It
 will be the second 8-bit BBS program to offer Y-Modem Batch upload, and
 the First to offer Sealink Batch, L-Modem Batch in addition to Y-Modem
 Batch!  Bob Klass has F-Modem 'waiting in the wings' to sweeten the pot!
 
 A New Multi-Pro! version is presently being Beta tested on three systems
 and is working.  This version will be capable of running up to 8 Atari
 8-bit system off of one hard disk!  It takes advantage of Bob Puff's Mux
 for the 8-bit systems.  As of this writing, I don't have a release date
 for this baby, but it should be a hit for those Systems who suffer the
 -Busy BBS Blues!-  <Grin>

 Well, until next time!  If you would like to submit a review, article,
 or a rebuttal(ANYTHING is welcomed!), feel free to upload to myself or
 Z-NET Online BBS.  I can be reached on my BBS (908-805-3967), GEnie

 8-BIT MODIFICATION
 ==================
 by Dan Knauf

 INSTALLING A DRIVE SELECT AND A RESET SWITCH IN YOUR 1050 DISK DRIVE
 
 (This article originally appeared in the Puget Sound Atari News
 magazine, the newsletter of the Seattle Puget Sound Atari Computer
 Enthusiasts.)
 
 
 When people see my 1050 disk drives for the first time they seem to
 respond to all the levers, buttons, and lights with something akin to
 awe.  (Is that another way of saying 'confusion' maybe?)  I have never
 figured out whether this is because they are impressed with what they
 are looking at or because they just don't understand why someone would
 put all that stuff on his disk drive.  Maybe I'm the first really lazy
 person they have ever met.  Naw... I think they're impressed with the
 high technology.

 All of my 1050's have one or two drive select switches and a RESET
 button on the front.  The one 1050 I own that isn't a Happy drive has a
 write protect switch and accompanying LED on the front.  Two of my Happy
 1050's have Happy Controller boards which add two more switches and an
 LED.  There is nothing complicated about any of these switches - except,
 maybe, for the ones on the Happy controller board.

 In case anyone is interested, the RESET button RESETs the 555 timer
 which causes the drive to RESET.  While the RESET button would probably
 be usless on a stock 1050, it is handy for Happy and US doubler drives
 since both upgrades occasionally forget that they are upgrades.
 Especially when used with SpartaDOS since Sparta kicks them into slow
 speed sometimes when it encounters a disk error.

 Here's how I install my drive select and RESET switches.

 Parts: 1 - SPDT center off toggle switch.
        1 - normally open pushbutton switch.
            some wire and some solder.

 Figure 1 is a view of the back left corner of the 1050 motherboard.
 This view assumes that the board is upside down and the front of the
 board is facing you.


 --------------|SIO plug|

 |   o o w        switch pads.

 |   4 5 6        the w's are.)
 |
 |
 |

         Figure 1
 Bottom of 1050 motherboard

 To install the switch, open up the drive by removing the six phillips
 screws from the bottom of the drive.  Remove the top cover then the
 front plate.  Next remove the screws that hold the motherboard to the
 bottom of the plastic drive housing and lift up the motherboard while
 carefully bending out the two plastic ears that hold the sides of the
 board down in the front.

 Now the important part.  You must decide where you want to mount the
 drive select switch.  I settled on a spot about two inches to the right
 of the power LED next to the on/off switch.  Once you have decided where
 you want to mount the switch check carefully to be certain that
 everything will fit ok when you go to put the drive back together.
 Myself, I have never put a switch in the wrong place.  Well, maybe just
 once.  (Ok, ok!  I never said I was honest!)

 Go ahead and mount the switch then run a wire from the center pin of the
 toggle switch to pin 5 of the drive select switch as depicted in figure 1.

 Run a wire from one of the end poles of the toggle switch to pin 3 of
 the drive select switch.

 Run a wire from the other end pin of the toggle switch to pin 6 of the
 drive select switch.

 Now when the toggle switch is in the center position, the drive is set
 to drive 1.  In one of the other positions it is drive 2 and the last
 switch position sets the drive to D4:.

 If you want to be able to make the drive D3: from the front, you can
 install a SPST switch and run a wire from the two end poles of the SPDT
 switch you just installed to the two poles of the SPST switch.  Turning
 the SPST switch on and setting the original toggle switch to either D2:
 or D4: will make the drive respond as D3:.

 Now for the reset button.  Here is the layout of the 555 timer chip looking 
 at the bottom of the motherboard with the front of the drive facing you.

           1 2 3 4

           w o o o
           8 7 6 5

           Figure 2

 Decide where you want to mount the pushbutton switch then drill a hole
 and mount the turkey.  Next, run a wire from pin 2 of the 555 timer chip
 (see figure 2) to one pole of the pushbutton switch.  Run a wire from
 pin 8 of the 555 timer to the other pole of the switch.  You're done!

 Now hurriedly, re-assemble the drive so you can test out the new bells
 and buttons!

 
 THE COMPUSERVE INFORMATION SERVICE
 ==================================           Z*Net Special Report
 by Scott Lapham
 
 If you are reading this, you probably have a computer.  If you have a
 modem with your computer, you've probably heard of CompuServe
 Information Service (CIS).  If you don't have a modem, or haven't heard
 of CIS, then read on.  You may decide to get a modem just to be able to
 gain access to this wealth of information, services and products.  And
 it's not expensive, either.  Only $6.00 an hour connect charge for up to
 300BPS, $12.50 an hour for 1200 or 2400BPS.  9600BPS service is being
 expanded this year.
 
 CIS certainly is a diversified service.  The first menu you see when you
 log on gives you a good idea of what's available.  It currently looks
 something like this:
 
 1.  Member Assistance (FREE)
 2.  Find a Topic (FREE)
 3.  Communications/Bulletin Boards
 4.  News/Weather/Sports
 5.  Travel
 6.  The Electronic MALL/Shopping
 7.  Money Matters/Markets
 8.  Entertainment/Games
 9.  Hobbies/Lifestyles/Education
 10. Reference
 11. Computers/Technology
 12. Business/Other Interests

 Choosing any of the above categories brings you to sub-menus that break
 down the generic choices into specific choices.  For instance, if you
 chose -1- (Member Assistance) from the main menu, you would be given the
 following choices in the sub-menu:

 1.  Tour/Find a Topic
 2.  Command Summary/How to Use
 3.  Ask Customer Service
 4.  Membership Changes
 5.  What's New
 6.  Practice Forum
 7.  Billing Information
 8.  Telephone Access Numbers
 9.  Order from CIS
 10. Rules of Operation/Copyright
 11. Membership Directory
 12. Specials/Contests

 You then make a choice from the sub-menu and you either get the
 information you were looking for or another sub-menu to give you more
 choices.  How could it be any easier?

 Not only is CIS a great place to get information, it's a great place to
 go shopping!  The Electronic Mall on CIS lets you shop to your hearts
 content without ever leaving your home.  And we're not talking about a
 few stores.  There are almost 100 merchants that sell items in
 departments such as: apparel/accessories, arts/music/video, auto, books/
 periodicals, business/finance, clubs/memberships, computing, gifts/
 flowers/gourmet foods, health/beauty, hobbies/toys/pets, information/
 services, merchandise/electronics, office supplies, sports/leisure and
 travel/vacations.  And you'll find many very familiar stores like Sears
 and JCPenney.  All it takes is a quick -GO SEARS- or -GO JCP- command at
 any prompt on CIS and you're off and shopping.  Beginning this spring,
 the ELECTRONIC MALL will be free of connect charges.
 
 Hobbyists will find CIS very useful too.  Some of the hobbies supported
 in the forums include aquaria/fish, astronomy, food/wine, ham radio,
 model aviation, photography, and science fiction, just to name a few.
 More on how forums work later.

 Need to fly somewhere?  Log on to EAASY SABRE and make your own flight
 arrangements.  Even write your own ticket and have it sent to your home!
 There is a small monthly charge to use this service, but if you fly
 often, it could be worth it.

 CIS doesn't forget about your children's education either.  The Groliers
 Academic American Encyclopedia is available online to help with the
 toughest homework assignments.  And it's updated far more often than a
 normal encyclopedia, too.

 Or if you need to send someone a quick letter, CIS' electronic mail
 service is also a snap to use.  You can compose your letter online or
 compose it offline on your computer and upload it.  And your recipient
 doesn't have to be a CIS subscriber.  You can also exchange messages
 with any TELEX or TWX machine, or a subscriber of the MCI Mail electronic 
 mail service.  You may also send electronic messages to FAX machines.

 CIS and ATARI

 Now let's look at CIS from an ATARI point of view.  And there is plenty
 to look at, too.  Whether you have and 8-bit, ST, game machine or
 portable DOS machine, it's covered on CIS.  All you have to do, once
 you're logged onto CIS, is type -GO ATARI-.  In a few seconds you're
 taken to ATARINET (Atari Users Network).  Once there, it's just a matter
 of choosing the right forum.  Your choices are:

 1. What's New in the Atari Forums
 2. Atari File Finder
 3. Atari 8-Bit Forum
 4. Atari ST Productivity Forum
 5. Atari ST Arts Forum
 6. Atari Vendors Forum
 7. Atari Portfolio Forum

 Each of the Atari hardware and software forums can be reached without
 going to this menu if you want to save a little time.  Type -GO ATARI8-
 (Atari 8-Bit Forum), -GO ATARIPRO- (Atari ST Productivity Forum), -GO
 ATARIARTS- (Atari ST Arts Forum), -GO ATARIVEN- (Atari Vendors Forum) or
 -GO APORTFOLIO- (Atari Portfolio Forum).

 The overall Forum Manager/SYSOP and contract holder for all Atari Forums
 on CIS is Ron Luks.  He can be contacted via electronic mail (userid
 76703,254) or on any of the forum message boards if you have any
 questions about ATARINET.

 All the forums have message boards.  They are used to discuss any and
 all subjects pertaining to the particular forum.  The boards can be very
 handy, whether you are an old pro or a new Atari user.  You can post a
 question there you may have about your hardware or software and will
 most likely get an answer from someone in just a day or so.  There are a
 lot of very knowledgeable people logging onto these boards that would
 love to help you out if they can.  Or you can just read the messages
 there to keep abreast of what's going on in the Atari world.

 All of the forums have libraries.  The libraries contain thousands of
 files that you can download; games, utilities, applications, demo's of
 commercial software or just informational text files.  Or if you have a
 program or file you'd like to share with other Atari users, you can
 upload it to the library.  Not a bad place to try to sell your old Atari
 400 when you decide you want to upgrade to a TT!  All of the files
 uploaded to the libraries are previewed by a SYSOP to make sure they
 work as described.

 With all those hundreds (or even thousands) of files contained in the
 Atari libraries, how could you possibly find a particular file you may
 want?  No problem.  The Atari File Finder to the rescue.  The File
 Finder is an online comprehensive keyboard searchable database of file
 descriptions from Atari related Forums.  It was designed to provide
 quick and easy reference to some of the best programs and files
 available in the Atari ST Productivity, Atari ST Arts and Atari Vendors
 forums.  It provides you with seven common search criteria for quickly
 finding the location of a wanted file or files.  You can search by
 topic, file submission date, forum name, file type, file extension, file
 name or submitter's user identification number.  File description, forum
 and library location are displayed for the matched files giving instant
 information on where to find a most wanted file.  You can access the
 File Finder by selecting option 2 on the main ATARINET menu or type -GO
 ATARIFF- at any CIS prompt.  Once at the File Finder main menu, you get
 the choices:

 1. About File Finder
 2. Instructions For Searching
 3. How To Locate Keywords
 4. Access File Finder
 5. Your Comments About File Finder

 Take your pick and off you go!  It's very user-friendly.

 ATART8 (Atari 8-Bit Forum)

 The Atari 8-Bit Forum supports the Atari 8-bit line of personal
 computers and Atari video game machines, including the portable Lynx.
 They have a real-time conference every Sunday night at 9:00 PM EST in
 Conference Room 4.  These conferences give you the opportunity to talk
 to and ask questions of a variety of people related to the Atari 8-Bit
 Forum.  It could be anyone from an Atari Corporation executive to the
 author of your favorite piece of software.  Try one some night.  I think
 you'd enjoy it.  The library in this forum includes files in the following 
 categories (my comments, in brackets, do not appear on the actual menu):

 1.  New Uploads (all new uploads, regardless of category)
 2.  Telecommunications (helps get the most of online time)
 3.  System Utilities (various utilities)
 4.  Graphics/RLE/PIC's (mostly clip-art)
 5.  Productivity Software (be productive)
 6.  Sound & Music (pretty self explanatory)
 7.  News & Reviews (see above)
 9.  BBS Programs/Information (in case you run a Bulletin Board)
 10. Games/Entertainment (self explanatory)
 11. ZNET Online (Atari specific online magazine)
 14. Programming Aids (in case you are a programmer)
 15. Innovative Concepts (to support their software)
 17. Misc./HELP (just as it says)

 ATARIARTS (Atari ST Arts Forum)

 The Atari ST Arts Forum supports various art forms for the Atari ST line
 of personal computers.  They have a Community Gab Conference every

 ATARIVEN (Atari Vendors Forum)

 The Atari Vendors Forum supports numerous third-party vendors that offer
 Atari-related products.  I don't have any information that suggests they
 have conferences here, but they do have a bulletin board and a library.
 The library includes files in the following categories (my comments, in
 brackets, do not appear on the actual menu):

 1.  Forum Business (self explanatory)

 This forum has been named by ATARI as an OFFICIAL online area for

 PM EST.  Log on to see in which conference room it is taking place.
 There is also a private message section and library for registered Atari
 Portfolio developers.  To apply for access, send CIS Mail to -Atari
 Developer Support-, userid 70007,1072.  The library includes files in
 the following categories (my comments, in brackets, do not appear on the
 actual menu):

 2.  Communications (kinda like telecommunications)
 3.  Utilities (of the DOS variety)
 4.  Entertainment (have fun)
 5.  Editors/Word Processors (self explanatory)
 6.  Database Functions (to keep track of things)

 11. GRAPHICS (art)
 14. *HyperList Testing (must be registered to enter)
 15. *PowerBASIC Testing (must be registered to enter)
 16. New Products (self explanatory)
 17. Misc. Files (self explanatory)

 That's about it.  I could go on for pages on how I specifically use CIS,
 but Ron Luks told me to keep it short (how am I doin', Ron?).  There are
 even programs that will help you navigate around CIS faster and easier
 but I'll save that for another time.  The bottom line is that CIS has a
 lot to offer an Atari computer user.  And since you are probably an
 Atari user yourself, why not give it a try.


 MIST PLANS ATARIFEST III
 ========================                              Press Release
 Indianapolis, IN  July 27,1991
 
 For a third year, an AtariFest is planned at Indianapolis, Indiana on
 Saturday, July 27th, sponsored jointly by the user groups at
 Indianapolis and Bloomington known as MIST (Mid-Indiana ST).  The show
 was formerly titled the MIST SwapFest, and took place in Nashville,
 Indiana.  While Nashville is a lovely and scenic place, we thought if
 our show was to live up to it's true potential, we would have to
 relocate to Indianapolis, where we could find a larger venue.

 For swap, for sale or just for display... whether it's 8-bit or ST...
 even game machines... all are invited to bring software, hardware,
 gadgets, accessories, books, magazines, etc.  Commercial sales and
 displays also are invited.  Past shows have seen folks like D.A.
 Brumleve, SKWare One, AIM, MS Designs, Computer Works, Cal Com, One
 Stop, T&H, and others.  Last year's show was quite successful, and this
 year looks like it'll be even better!  We have tentatively lined up ISD,
 who will be demoing DynaCadd and Calamus.  There are others in the
 works, so stay tuned!

 MIST AtariFest III will be held at CADRE, Inc. on the north side of
 Indianapolis.  The address is: 6385 Castleplace Drive, Indianapolis, In.
 46250-1902.  There will be specific directions in a later posting.
 Admission to the 'Fest will be $3.00, and will include a raffle ticket.
 We will be raffling hardware from Atari Corp, and software from
 attending vendors and developers.  Additional raffle tickets will be
 available for purchase.
 
 Anyone interested in attending or reserving vendor/developer tables
 should contact me by one of the below methods:

 For more information, leave mail on GEnie to W.LORING1, or:  Call the
 BL.A.ST BBS at 812-332-0573  2400bps, 24 hours.  Write us at BL.A.ST,
 PO Box 1111, Bloomington, IN. 47402.  Call me by voice at 812-336-8103.
 
 Vendor packets are in the works, and should be ready to send shortly.
 More details will be available at that time.

 Brought to you by MIST (Mid-Indiana ST), the merging of the ASCII (Atari St 
 Computers In Indianapolis) and BL.A.ST (BLoomington Atari ST) user groups.

 Thanks for your interest, and we'll see you at the 'Fest!!

 Sincerely,
 William Loring, President of BL.A.ST
