 Well, here we go again.  It has been nine months since we released an
 issue of ZMAG.  There has been numerous requests for 8-bit coverage in
 Z*Net Online, but the focus there is ST, TT, and STacy, to name a few.
 The coverage for 8-bitters is fading fast and during this year you have
 seen the departure of your favorite magazines.  The hard copy coverage
 may be gone but we are here and look forward to providing you the best
 possible support.
 
 This publication will start where we left off in December 1989 with
 issue #184.  We will start with a bi-weekly format until November and
 attempt a weekly release soon after.  Weekly release will be determined
 by the articles we receive from the readers and other sources.  Already
 being selected as a source for material is the Puget Sound Atari News 
 and the JACG newsletter.  Since our sister hard copy publication is
 currently distributed in some twenty newsletters, I am sure we will be
 able to collect more articles in the months ahead.
 
 Each issue will contain the latest Z*Net Newswire especially edited for
 8-bit owners.  Of course there will be other news appearing from time to
 time that we hope you will find interesting.  In a survey to be released
 shortly, we will poll you for coverage requests.  This will help us
 focus attention on issues and news that interestes you.
 
 There are a few people already volunteering efforts, and I look forward
 to pooling the information and presenting here.  If you want to donate
 articles, please leave email on the services and the BBS.  Regular
 columns will be assigned in the next few weeks and a special area each
 week for previously released tips and information will appear.
 
 BBS systems carrying the publication are encouraged to leave a message
 with their number.  The old Z*Magazine list has been deleted along with
 the system numbers previously assigned.  The revised 1990 edition of the
 official ZMAG BBS list will be released as soon as we can get some
 numbers on it.
 
 Stay tuned to this page in the weeks ahead on plans and feedback on
 suggestions.  This new attempot will be a bit more personalized and
 contain the latest Atari happenings.
 
 Thanks go to everyone posting the positive messages.  Best of luck to
 us on this return and hopes for a long life online!

 GLENDALE SHOW SETS UP SURPRISES
 
 September 15 & 16 will bring the largest collection of Atari exhibitors
 ever to Glendale, California.  The vendor list is firming up, and next
 week in Z*Net Online, we will have a new all-confirmed compilation of
 those who are coming.  The Southern California Atari Computer Faire,
 Version 4.0b, is being managed by John King Tarpinian, who can be
 reached for last minute bookings or other information at (818) 246-7286.
 
 Atari has let it be known that they have some very special things
 planned for this show, and even Elie Kenan, new General Manager at
 Atari, has taken part in coordinating the advertising for the show in
 major papers and on radio.  Bob Brodie and many other Atari employees
 will be attending.
 
 A first for any show will be a LYNX-LINK PLAYOFF, similar in concept to
 the Midi-Maze competitions that have been popular at many events.
 Prizes for those competing in the continuous multi-player LYNX games
 will include, of course, Lynx game units and lots of game carts.
 
 Late word says that Portfolio developer Xetoerix will display a
 remarkable 20 meg hard drive for the palm size Portfolio computer.
 
 New seminars being planned include a hands-on HOTZ MIDI TRANSLATOR
 session and a pair of PORTFOLIO -classes-.
 
 
 FREE TICKETS TO GLENDALE SHOW
 
 John King Tarpinian is offering FREE tickets to the Glendale Atari Show.
 Regular admission will be $5.00 each day and only $3.00 for any Atari
 user group members with membership identification.  In the interests of
 helping to support a wide mix and representation of Atari users from
 other states, John will also send up to 10 pairs of FREE tickets ($60.00
 worth), to any requesting user group based outside of the Southern
 California area.  Requests should come from a club officer and tickets
 are not for resale except to members for the benefit of the club
 treasury.  Act soon to allow mailing time.
 
 Remember, the show is this September 15 and 16.  Call John at (818)
 246-7286 at reasonable times.  (Pacific Time)
 
 
 ATARI STE FIXED
 
 Sources close to Atari have let it be known that the hard drive
 operation problem in the Atari STe computers has been eradicated
 completely in the new production machines now leaving Sunnyvale.
 
 Since no official statement has as yet been made by Atari regarding the
 resolution of the nastyu DMA problem, Z*NET has asked Bob Brodie to
 investigate and make an official response to our inquiry about it.  We
 hope to have the last word on this and on the handling of exisiting
 machines very soon.
 
 
 ST-WORLD SENT THE FRAUDULENT FAX
 
 A joint statement is expected shortly from Atari Corp and former
 ST-World Magazine owner Richard Tsukiji, explaining that investigation
 of the -Bob Brodie FAX- incident has determined that the fax was in fact
 sent from the ST-World offices, but from persons unknown.  The FAX in
 question falsely purported to be from Atari Manager of User Group
 Services, Bob Brodie, and urged a boycott of World of Atari shows.
 
 ST-World Magazine offices were closed and Tsukiji was allegedly out
 of the state on July 2, 1990, when the FAX was sent.
 
 Tsukiji is said to suspect that disgruntled former ST-World employees
 sent the damaging FAX.  Tsukiji transferred ownership of the magazine
 to several employees for the sum of $1.00, bypassing other employees and
 editors who had expected to take over the ST publication.
 
    
 LYNX OWNERS UPDATE
 
 Are you tired of scanning through page after page of Nintendo stuff in
 video game magazines just so you can find a little Lynx news?  Don't you

 APE (Atari Portable Entertainment) is a quarterly newsletter that covers
 the Lynx exclusively.  The June Premiere issue features Summer Consumer
 Electronics Show news, Lynx Game Secrets, tips and hints for California
 Games, Blue Lightning, Chip's Challenge, Electrocop, Gates of Zendocon,

 HP TOLL-FREE HOTLINE
 
 Hewlett-Packard now has a US only toll free telephone number (1-800-233-
 5153) that customers can call to determine if their HP LaserJet IIP
 printer is one of approx 70,000 manufactured during the early months of
 the printer's release that have faulty power supplies.  HP will replace
 the power supply of affected HP LaserJet IIP printers at no charge.
 
 Customers in Canada should contact their local HP-authorized dealer or
 HP customer-service center.  The failures do not represent a safety
 hazard but will result in a front control panel message -50 NEEDS
 SERVICE- that halts operation of the printer.
 
 Owners of this printer purchased before March 1990 are encouraged to
 call the toll-free number.  Customers who have printers with faulty
 power supplies will be given the option to:
 
 - contact their local HP authorized dealer or HP customer-service center
   to have the power supply replaced free of charge
 
 - return the printer to HP and receive a remanufactured printer with a
   full one-year warranty in exchange
 
 
 GENIE OFFERS FLAT MONTHLY RATE
 
 The GEnie online service announced last week the introduction of a flat
 subscription rate of just $4.95 (US) per month including unlimited, non-
 prime time access to more than 100 products and services.
 
 The rate for US access to those GEnie service products/services not
 covered under the flat monthly rate has been set at just $6 per hour
 during non-prime time for all three access speeds of (300, 1200 and
 2400 baud).
 
 The prime time rate will remain at $18 per hour for all three access
 speeds.  In Canada, the monthly subscription rate is $5.95 (Canadian),
 with a non-prime time rate of $8 (Canadian) per hour for all three
 access speeds.
 
 The $29.95 sign up fee for the GEnie service also has been eliminated
 for all new subscribers effective immediately.  If a subscriber does
 not like the new service, they can cancel their membership and the GEnie
 service will refund the $4.95 subscription fee to them.
 
 
 NINTENDO UPDATE
 
 Nintendo has launched 3 television commercials which showcase Nintendo's
 creative philosophy: having fun through game play transcends all ages.
 Incorporating real-life scenarios in all 3 commercials, Nintendo
 demonstrates how its Game Boy portable video game system can play a role
 in the lifestyles of two disparate age groups: kids and teens, ages
 6-17; and adult males, ages 18-49.

 The Glendale Atari Faire is a User Group sponsored tradition in Southern
 California, the West Coast's Premier Atari event since 1986.  This will
 be the fourth show in five years at the same large auditorium in
 Glendale, California, just a few minutes from Burbank Airport and
 convenient to all of the metropolitan Los Angeles area.  An attendance
 of over 4,000 is realistically anticipated, considering previous year's
 performances.  Last year's Glendale show was cancelled due to
 conflicting dates with another show, which was then itself cancelled.
 
 With one month left before the show, organizer John King Tarpinian says
 that he is nearly sold out of the original floor space planned for use
 in the Glendale Civic Auditorium.  He adds that if demand keeps up,
 convenient, quality additional space can be arranged.  John says that
 the developers that appeared at the recent San Jose World of Atari show
 are booked for Glendale, plus lots more.  Publicity for the Glendale
 show, including the vendor list, has been low key until now to avoid
 drawing attention away from that San Jose show.
 
 Here is the Glendale Show List of vendors, both of confirmed and
 unconfirmed -but likely- to attend.  There are 45 of them so far, plus
 at least five user groups, making Glendale perhaps the biggest US Atari
 show of all time!

   by Roy Goldman
 
 
 (This document assumes familiarity with the Daisy-Dot III near letter
  quality printing system.  For information about DD3 send a SASE to Roy
  Goldman, 2440 S Jasmine, Denver, CO  80222)
 
 COPY THIS FILE TO YOUR PRINTER (P:)
 
 INTRODUCTION
 ------------
 One of the new features of Daisy-Dot III is variable page length
 support, which allows the program to keep track of pages regardless of
 page size, font or line spacing combination used.
 
 The DD3 Print Processor Customizer restricts the minimum page length to
 288/72- (4-) to avoid possible problems caused by top/bottom margin
 overlap and printing of large fonts with large line spacing.
 Unfortunately, this restriction makes it difficult to effectively print
 popular continuous form 3 1/2- X 15/16- labels (with 1/16- between
 labels).
 
 The following suggested modifications set the page length to 1- for
 proper control of these labels.  But as a price for this flexibility,
 the user must become responsible for setting both the top and bottom
 margins to zero and making sure that font and line spacing sizes aren't
 too large when creating the labels.  I recommend that you apply these
 modifications to a copy of DD3PP to be used ONLY for labels and that you
 continue to use a copy of DD3PP configured by the unmodified customizer
 for every other printing application.
 
 MODIFICATIONS
 ------------- 
 Enter BASIC in your system, and type:
 
      LOAD -Dn:PPCUSTOM.BAS-
 
 where n is the drive containing an unmodified copy of the Print
 Processor Customizer.
 
 You need modify only two lines, 6010 and 6020, so type:
 
 LIST 6010,6020
 
 Change the 288 in line 6010 to 72 and press [RETURN].
 
 Change the 287 in line 6020 to 71, change the 98 in line 6020 to 70, and
 press [RETURN].
 
 To double check the changes, type:
 
     LIST 6010,6020
 
 again.  They should look like this:
 
 6010 POSITION 2,17:? -Page Length (72-1008/72-;CHR$(34);-):-;:INPUT TEMP
 6020 IF TEMP>71 AND TEMP<1009 AND TOP+BOT+70<TEMP AND TEMP=INT(TEMP)THEN
 LENGTH=TEMP
 
 Next, save the file under a different name.  Try:
 
     SAVE -Dn:PPCLABEL.BAS-
 
 where n is the destination drive.
 
 Next, run the customizer by typing:
 
     RUN [RETURN]
 
 Make sure you change the following settings on the customizer menu, in
 the order listed:
 
 Enter T, 0, and [RETURN].
 Enter B, 0, and [RETURN].
 Enter N, 72, and [RETURN].
 Enter W, 120, and [RETURN].
 
 You might as well also change the left and right margins; I suggest
 setting both to zero (a zero setting will still provide the -built-in-
 1/4- inch margins):
 
 Enter E, 0, and [RETURN].
 Enter R, 0, and [RETURN].
 
 Next, press [L] and specify the location of the DD3PP file to be
 modified.
 
 (Any other settings not specified above may be changed as desired.)
 
 Finally, press [SPACE] to customize the program.
 
 MAKING A LABEL
 --------------
 Here's a sample session for creating and printing several copies of an
 address label.
 
 Run your word processor and type:
 
   \cRoy Goldman [RETURN]
    2440 South Jasmine [RETURN]
    Denver, CO  80222 [RETURN]
 
 Save the file as LABEL.  Use this basic technique for every label--
 experiment to see how many lines of your favorite font will fit on a
 label.  Almost every DD3 feature can be used within a label.
 
 WARNING: Never modify the top or bottom margins.
 WARNING: Make sure that the combined height of a font and the line
 spacing is always less than an inch (i.e. avoid quadruple height fonts
 and avoid large line spacing values).
 
 Run the copy of DD3PP modified earlier.  Specify MADRID as the font 
 (after inserting the appropriate disk) and LABEL as the text file.
 
 Insert the label form into your printer and press [START] to print.
 If the address isn't vertically aligned correctly within the label,
 change the alignment manually and try again.  Continue this process
 until it is vertically centered within the label.  Once the first one is
 okay, press C, 5, [RETURN], and [START] to print five more copies.
 
 CONCLUSION
 ----------
 By following the suggestions in this document, DD3 can be used to easily
 print labels.
 
 In most cases, the page control feature is very accurate.  However, with
 some fonts, there may be very small alignment discrepancies between
 labels that could become apparent if too many labels are printed at one
 time.

 |*| 8-BIT PUBLIC DOMAIN UPDATE |*|
 |*|       by Ron Kovacs        |*|
 |*||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||*|
 
 
 * GEM.ARC - Printer utility to setup your printer from DOS.  Uses
   Sparta command line with parameter passing or a menu with less capable
   DOS's.  Written in ACTION! with source for easy reconfiguring with
   other printers.
 
 * APACSHW2.OBJ - Latest version of APACSHOW, the slide show program.
   This version works correctly with DOS 2.0/2.5, displays in an
   interlaced mode, (gets rid of those annoying black lines in APAC),
   and fixes a few other bugs.
 
 * APACVW20.ARC - Latest version of APACVIEW decodes and displays GIF
   images in APAC (256 color) mode.  It also allows you to create color-
   separations (.R, .G, .B) for viewing with COLRVIEW in 80 x 192
   resolution with 4096 colors.  This version also has some additional
   fixes noted in the doc file.
 
 * SPLIB12.ARC - Sparta Library 1.2.  Disk cataloger program.  Runs under
   SpartaDOS only.  Reads SpartaDOS, DOS 2.x, maybe MYDOS, disks.
   Features automatic subdirectory reads, describes and sorts by volume
   name, subdirectory name, file name and file description.  Fixes bugs
   in version 1.1 and contains support files.
 
 * VT52100.DCM - This file is an update to an early version vt52/vt100
   terminal emulator.  A bug in the old version that affected the
   backspace (and a few other keys) in half duplex mode only.  This
   program is 100% machine language, offers a very complete emulation of
   a VT100 as well as VT52 terminal, and has xmodem and ascii file
   transfer capabilities.
 
 * MFD35.DCM - This file must be expanded using Diskcomm 3.2 or higher
   to create the MFD 3.5 disk.  Atari DOS 3 and XL/XE machine required.
   This is the newest version of the Master File Directory also known as
   the File Organizer.  It includes all features of older version plus
   more, like the ability to delete unwanted records and new ways to
   search records.  If you use any one of the older versions (1.5 or 2.0)
   you need, along with this file, the upgrade kit.  New users only need
   this one.  You MUST read the docs before using the program because it
   can't be used as it comes from the archive.  Some setup is needed
   before using the program for the first time.  Due to a minor quirk
   related to screen handling (which DOES NOT affect program operation)
   you should hold OPTION during boot-up even though the docs tell you
   this isn't necessary.  Not doing this may produce annoying garbage in
   the screen when you search records.  This can also be fixed by re-
   starting the program by pressing RESET once it has booted.
   Documentation is NOT included in this archive.
 
 * MFD35DOC.ARC - This file contains the docs for the new Master File
   Directory 3.5.  If you use any of the older versions be sure to get
   the upgrade kit.
 
 * UPGRADEKIT.ARC - This is intended only for users of the older versions
   of the Master File Directory also known as the File Organizer.  This
   archive contains a program that will convert the data files you use
   with your older version to the format used in the new 3.5 version.
   Included are the docs to this program.  You need to have Atari DOS 3
   and XL/XE machine with at least 64K.
 
 * PSDEMO.ARC - ARC file with PS icon fonts and a text file demonstrates
   how to incorporate Print Shop icons (converted with PSTODD3B) into
   documents to be printed with Daisy-Dot III.  Included are 4 Icon fonts
   and a total of over 50 fonts (fancy alphabet, Atari icons, horoscope
   and Bart Simpson).  The demo itself doesn't require PSTODD3B but does
   require the registered version of DD3.  You will need PSTODD3 to make
   your own icon fonts.  From DD3, choose ROMAN2 as the initial font and
   TEST.TXT as the text file.  Make sure all other font files in ARC file
   (*.NL?) are on the default drive.  Demo prepared by John McGowan from
   Columbia, MO.
 
 * SLOGRO.ARC - A model of diffusion limited aggregation: a particle is
   released from the edge of a circle and wanders on a random walk until
   it hits a central dot and becomes -stuck- in place.  This continues
   with additional particles until a -dust-ball- of accumualted dots
   fills the screen.  This program is released by the author to
   demonstrate one of the educational disks available from Bresnik
   Software.
 
 * BASICMOD.COM - Change BASIC rev. B to C; quiet the noise during disk
   access; speed key repeat; increase screen contrast; autoload a program
   in BASIC that is named -HELLO- [no extension].  This program loads
   into memory on page 6 and is protected against -RESET-.
 
 * THEPLAYR.ARC - The Music Player plays AMS I or AMS II tunes.  If you
   have a 2nd pokey installed it will play in 16-bit stereo, 8-bit
   stereo, or 8-bit mono.  Up to 69 files can be seen on the screen.
   Autoplay, Tag, Untag, and Play Tagged are some of the options.  You
   can switch modes (16-bit S, 8-bit S, or 8-bit M) while a tune is
   playing.  The name of the song being played is displayed on the piano
   screen.  This is a GOOD AMS player.  If you haven't done Chuck's Gumby
   upgrade yet, this should give you a reason to.
 
 These files are available on the services and locals BBS systems.

 Well, I think I've found the ultimate disk drive for the 8-bit computer.
 I'm the AUGIE 8-bit Librarian and that means I handle a lot of disks
 which takes a lot of time and disk space.  Since time is money, as the
 saying goes, I am always on the look out for anything that will save me
 some of either.  Well, when I heard about the XF35 kit from Innovative
 Concepts, I was a little skeptical.  But I thought, -If it works, boy,
 oh boy, will I have it made!-
 
 The IC ad said, -Now XF551 owners can convert their drive to the newer
 3.5- format and have a massive 720K of storage!  Works with MYDOS,
 SpartaDOS, and the SpartaDOS X cartridge.  Excellent for BBS use, hard
 drive backup, or use as a mini-hard drive!-  The kit includes an upgrade
 ROM chip, adapting cables and complete instructions.  The 3.5- drive was
 not part of the kit nor did I need it to be.  Here in Southern
 California we have a lot of electronic swap meets and the one I went to
 for my 3.5 drive is the -General Dynamics HAM Radio swap meet-.  At this
 swap meet you can find almost anything in the area of electronics,
 computers and accessories.  I found a seller who had three Cannon 3.5-
 DD-DS disk drives that he was willing to just about give away.  So I
 gave him $10.00 for all three.  One worked perfectly, another one
 wouldn't format every time but otherwise worked fine, the last one will
 be good for parts.
 
 Anyway, after a phone call to IC, and a week's wait, I had my kit and
 all the rest of the parts I needed to install the new 3.5- drive in my
 XF551.  Everything went in just like it was supposed to.  I'm sure glad
 that IBM parts are all pretty much standardized.  One change I would
 recommend, however, is not desoldering the cable connector from the
 printed circuit board.  You're just asking for problems if you aren't
 really good at that sort of thing.  Instead, just pry the top clip off
 of the connector and firmly press the new cable (the one in the kit)
 into place.  Then put the clip back on the connector.  It is really that 
 simple.
 
 The kit instructions gives you the option of either leaving your 5.25-
 drive mechanism in the case and installing the 3.5- drive externally, or
 replacing the 5.25- drive mechanism with the 3.5- drive by use of an
 adapter.  I chose the internal option because I already own an AMDEC
 with four IBM type 5.25- DD-DS disk drives attached to it.  In fact the
 XF551's drive mechanism is now number one on the AMDEC.
 
 The instructions were clear and easy to follow.  I really appreciate
 someone who takes the time to write good directions, since it makes all
 the difference in the world between a project like this being a pleasure
 or a nightmare.  In this case I'll brag about these instructions and say
 that they make this Mod 'a piece of cake'.
 
 Now to the good stuff:  Using the modified XF551 or XF35 as it's called.
 I can't say enough about the practical aspects of this drive setup.
 After some experimentation I decided to use SpartaDOS and DiskCom
 together for my software.  What I wanted to do was have the club's 
 library available anytime without having to carry three or four hundred
 disks around with me all the time.  As it worked out I've been able to
 put four to five double-sided 5.25- disks on each 3.5- disk.  The
 combination of SpartaDOS and Disk Com means that I can read and
 duplicate in virtually any density or DOS situation I come across.  I
 love it!  I now only need to keep sixty or so 3.5- disks handy and they
 are little disks at that.  I ask you, can it get any better?  It's
 easier than carrying around a hard drive.  Let's see .... 737K times 60
 plus disks, ummm, well I'm sure it's more than 30 megs.
 
 Another really great application for the XF35 is in telecommunications.
 SpartaDOS plus the Express 212 program handles the XF35 drive like a
 dream.  I can up- or down-load huge files (compressed ARCed or text)
 with the greatest of ease.  By the way, Text Pro 3.2r also loves the
 XF35.  I haven't begun to scratch the surface of the potential
 applications for this wondrous modification.  -XF35- where have you been
 all my 8-bit life?  I just love it!
