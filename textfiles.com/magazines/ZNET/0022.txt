Xx COMMODORE BLUES PART 3

Commodore International got a break from its bankers this week -- an 
agreement to renew the company's credit line for $140 million. Last February, 
Commodore was technically in default of its loans, but banks held off 
calling in their money. Commodore spokesman Alan Penchansky told The 
Associated Press the action is -another step in the turn around... another 
question mark that was there that has been answered.-Zmagazine reported in 
August that Commodore posted its first profitable quarter in seven quarters, 
earning $1.2 million on sales of $209 million for the period ending June 30. 
This was quite a change from a year earlier, when the West Chester,Pa., 
computer maker recorded quarterly losses of $124 million on $132 million in 
sales. Penchansky said Commodore has had larger profits for the quarter 
ending Sept. 1, but specifics have not been released.To be signed by 
mid-November, the agreement comes eight months after the Commodore announced 
a temporary $135 million credit agreement that removed the banks' threat of 
foreclosure, AP notes.

Xx MAX HEADROOM  

Well, it really wasn't quite the same thing as having ol' Max Headroom 
popping up on your computer screen, but then again, a conference in the 
Public Relations and Marketing Forum with Max's personal promoters was 
insightful into the man behind the screen (so to speak).  Max Headroom is a 
computer-generated personality, born in Great Britain where he is a major 
star. He debuted in the United States last year with his own Cinemax 
series, -The Max Headroom Show,-and has achieved more widespread fame as 
the spokesperson, er..spokescreen, for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
Discussing the mystique of Max in the PR Forum was Joe Donohue, a vice 
president with Coca- Cola's public relations firm, Cohn & Wolfe. He 
described Max as -the latest in high-tech computer-generated video 
graphics, audio wizardry and prosthetics,- but refused to reveal some of 
his secrets, such as whether Max's repartee work is done live. Portrayed by 
the professional, Canadian actor Matt Frewer, Max has captured the 
imaginations of a worldwide audience, something Cokeis zeroing in on in an 
attempt to sell more soft drinks.  Irreverent Max hypes Coke in the -Catch 
the Wave- campaign currently airing, although some may wonder if Max is 
selling Coke or Coke is selling Max. No matter to CocaCola officials, who 
are pleased that their advertising campaign has resulted in commercials 
that are among the best retained by consumers.
Max Headroom is best known for his witty, off-the-wall comments made while 
interviewing rock groups and other pop artists. Newsweek dubbed Max the 
-the TV talk show host of 1986 -- no, make that the year 2000.-  And for 
any who might think computer-generated talk show hosts have no personality, 
check out this from Video Life:  
-:-Max's favorite sport: Golf.  
-:-His ideal woman:  Grace Jones. 
-:-How much does he get paid: Nothing.
That's why he's the perfect TV host. 
-:-To what does he credit hispopularity?  His high degree of perfection, 
plus a great deal ofmodesty.
-:-Does he prefer candle-lit dinners?
Max prefers food cooked the normal way. And that's probably the only thing 
that *is* normal about Max Headroom.
Although Max did not make a personal appearance at the Oct 30th conference, 
David J. Colmans, another vice president with Cohn & Wolfe, said he remains 
hopeful that an -event on CompuServe- with Max himself as guest host can 
bear ranged with Coca-Cola's permission. -The problems are that Max is a 
computer character with no arms and hands so he can't type,- said Colmans. 
-But we can probably work something out and figure out a way to do some 
computer graphics.  If we can do it, we will because it is a natural to 
have a guy like Max onCompuServe.-

Xx SPA BOUNTY FOR PIRATES EXTENDED
Earlier this year, the Software
Publishers Association announced it was offering a $100 reward to anyone 
turning in information about computer bulletin board systems that 
distribute copyrighted software. That deal was scheduled to end tomorrow, 
November 1, 1986, but nowthe SPA has extended it indefinitely. As reported 
earlier in Zmag in order to collect the bounty,tipsters must provide the 
name, telephone number and log-on information of a pirate BBS, as well as 
the street address and name of the sysop, a disk containing copyrighted 
materials downloaded from it and a printout of other copyrighted material 
posted there.
SPA spokeswoman Catherine Borsecnik told Ric Manning of Bulletin Board 
Systems newsletter that the Washington-based trade group so far has paid 
out about $500 to tipsters, and -we'll keep it up until our money starts 
getting scarce.- She declined to identify the boards in question, and 
added, -The hardest part is getting the mailing address.-
SPA Director Kenneth A. Wasch has said the group may attempt prosecution of 
offending BBS operators, but would more likely ask them to voluntarily 
remove copyrighted material. Bulletin Board Systems newsletter is a monthly 
feature of NewsNet, which is accessible through CompuServe's IQuest 
gateway.

Xx Product Review
PRODUCT: THE FIRST WORD PROCESSOR
MANUFACTURER: XLent Software
              PO Box 5228
              Springfield, VI 22150
              (703)644-8881
REVIEWER: Eric Plent I enjoy using my word processor for all kinds of 
things, like shopping lists, or making lists of things to take to M.O.M. 
meetings. The first word processor I had was AtariWriter, and I was not 
impressed with it for a few reasons, mostly the fact that it would notwork 
with my STAR SG-10 printer without a printer driver.  I believe XLent has 
solved all those problems with the release of THE FIRST WORD PROCESSOR.  I 
have found this package to be very easy to use and full of features and 
options I have not even started to use.
Many of the commands are much like the Atari BASIC editor, with commands 
like CONTROL+INSERT working the same.  This is handy for people who are 
used to using the Atari editor and do not want to remember new commands.
Some of the many features can be accessed by clicking ICONS in the lower 
right corner of the screen.
For example: If you want to LOAD a file, simply press ESC, choose the DISK 
ICON with the arrow keys, select LOAD, and type in the filename you 
want.The other ICONS in the lower right allow you to access most of the 
accessory features, such as COPY a block of text, CUT and PASTE ablock of 
text, and SEARCH for a word or string of words in your document. By 
pressing the CONTROL+SHIFT+F combination, you can find out how many bytes 
of memory you have left, and the CONTROL+SHIFT+? combo will tell you how 
many sectors your document will need on a disk.
The manual that comes with the disk is well written and covers all the 
features and options to great extent. So far, I have found this word 
processor to have many, if not all the features of some of the higher 
priced packages, such as PaperClip and AtariWriter.
I don't know how well The First Word Processor will work with large text 
files, such as long DOC files from programs like 850 Express!, but I see 
nothing to suggest there would be any problem.The method of print preview 
XLent went with is something I have never seen before.  When you use print 
preview, you are prompted for the output device.  You can choose from 
Printer, Disk or Screen, with Screen as the default.  If you choose Screen, 
a little print head zips across the screen, printing your document on the 
screen as a real printer would.  You have the option of turning the print 
head off for greater speed in preview, if youwish.
Along with the main program, themaster disk has a few utility programs used 
later, such as a Printer Driver Construction Utility to set up a driver for 
your printer's control codes.
The file HELP is a text help file for the XL/XE version of the main 
program.  It can be changed at anytime, so you can have your own helpfile, 
with the commands you usemost.
PRINTSET.SYS is automaticly loaded by the word processor at boot up, and 
contains specific printer codes for your printer.  This is the driver, and 
must be named-PRINTSET.SYS-.
One section in the manual you might find out of place is the title -HOW TO 
PUT PAPER INTO THE PRINTER-. Don't be insulted...It is there fora reason: 
With this word processor you do not insert the paper with the print head at 
the very top of the page because it does not advance the paper for the top 
margin, as do most. Instead, you line the paper up with the line you want 
it to start at, and not above.  To quote the manual: -This title may sound 
a little bit condescending, but it is not meant to be.  This word processor 
uses a method a little bit different than most word processors and 
consequently, the paper must be aligned in a different manner.-  It goes on 
to explain the process of lining up the paper for the best results.  The 
text from The First Word may be used by other XLent software packages, like 
MEGAFONT][+ and TYPESETTER, so you can make whole pages of graphics with 
TYPESETTER, and merge text from The First Word to create full blown pro 
style covers for newsletters or book reports.  As you can tell, I am 
impressed with the value and content of this low priced word processor ($19 
is the best price I have seen thought mail order), and would suggest you 
take a hard look at it before plunking down your money on AtariWriter, or 
any other of the higher priced packages.

Xx Magazine Review  
ATARI EXPLORER 
A Magazine Reborn review by Mike Brown  I don't know how the rest of you 
felt, but after not having received an issue of Atari Explorer for MANY 
months, I had written them off as another cost-cutting casualty of the 
Tramiel-ized Atari Corp. 
I am happy to say that a -new- Atari Explorer magazine has finally arrived 
in my mail and some of the details of its Genesis will surprise you!  One 
of the biggest surprises and pleasures of this -new- magazine is that Atari 
went out and recruited some of the FINEST in available Atari computer-
journalists to form this magazine. Most outstanding was the appointment of 
a personal favorite of mine, David H. Ahl, founder of Creative Computing, 
and frequent contributor to Dr. Dobbs Journal as publisher. Dave brings a 
host of talent from the former Creative Computing staff, including; Betsy 
Staples (Editor), Ed Carlson, Bill Jacobson, and Bill Kokoni (contributing 
editors).
  The second most impressive thing about the magazine is that they are not 
just a -house organ- for Atari. They have quite a number of software/ 
hardware reviews for third party items, and an impressive array of 
advertisers! It is also not just Atari-specific, Dave Ahl explains things 
to come in his -What's New In Technology?- section. Of course there were 
the usual interviews with Atari developers (that were only interesting to 
those who don't get the latest happenings from online services), and some 
not-so -subtle plugs for Atari products.  Another surprise was that there 
was a good balance struck between the 16-bit and 8-bit worlds without 
resorting to segregation. An article on programming financial formulas was 
complemented by both 8-bit and ST example programs. The other two 
programming articles were strictly 8-bit specific, so this implies that 
there is still a considerable -awareness- of the 8-bit user at Atari!  
There is a quite nice article by John Anderson (late of Family Computing) 
on telecommunications and how to better use the popular ST program -FLASH-. 
I hope that John will make this a regular feature as I get a kick out of 
his freewheeling writing style.  All things considered, I am impressed by 
this first effort by the -new Atari Explorer- magazine. Another nice thing 
about it is that they have decided to go bimonthly instead of quarterly. I 
also noticed that my subscription had been extended a bit, I assume to 
compensate for the lack of a magazine for such a long time. If you are a 
new user or a seasoned -Nerd- i am sure that you will find something to 
like in the pages of Atari Explorer magazine. Subscriptions can be sent to:  
Atari Explorer 7 Hilltop Road Mendham, NJ 07945  A one year subscription (6 
issues) is a reasonable $14.95, and they do accept major bank cards.

Xx Reader Submissions  
The following text came from the MOUSE BBS (219) 674-9288.  User: Dave 
Brehm  (COPLEY RADIO NETWORK)-If you could peer into the year 1996, you 
might not like what you see and hear.  At least, those of you who love to 
hear the thoughtful, charming, warm, truly spontaneous voice of a live 
radio announcer might be a bit peeved to find COMPUTER AUTOMATION has 
replaced on-air human talent.  All this couldn't come at a better time, of 
course, for station owners, general managers and other souls plagued by 
rising talent costs.  But yours truly may be looking for work, if National 
Association of Broadcasters' executive vice- president John D. Abel has his 
figures straight.  Abel says in the next ten years we'll have MAX HEADROOM-
type synthetic disc jockeys, satellite receivers in each and every car, 
hundreds more radio stations, satellite networks, super-stations and the 
compact disc will practically annihilate the old vinyl record.  But the 
biggest change you the listener may notice is when your bill comes in the 
mail.  Commerical radio is already facing stiff competition from cable-TV 
outlets offering alternative pay radio.  More than half the stations in the 
U.S. are already on cable, so the stage is set for pay-radio invasion.  
(COMPUTERIZED WINE STEWARD)  You say you don't know a Cabernet from a 
Zinfandel? A Beaujolais from a vin rose?  Well thanks to the Wine Steward 
Company of San Francisco, Just about anyone can become a wine connoisseur.  
That's because Wine Steward sells special computer terminals and software 
to selected supermarkets that can help customers select wines.  Say you're 
in the mood for Italian food. The computer monitor will display a selection 
of wines that go best with your meal.  The high-tech wine steward also 
describes each bottle of wine and gives the price.  What makes the computer 
system so unique is that -wine lists- are tailored to the individual store.  
Wine Steward computer terminals can be found in 13 supermarket chains 
nationwide. 

(COMPUTER-ASSISTED PARENTING)  
Ward Cleaver may have been too hard on the Beaver. At least that seems to 
be the opinion of a computer program that aids parents in understanding and 
dealing with their kids.  The program - called Mind Over Minors - provides 
parents with specific advice for handling each child in relation to their 
personality type.  After the computer analyzed Ward and the Beav's 
relationship it came up with these tips for dear old dad:  Ward should 
steer clear of the perfection standard and focus on realistic goals 
instead.  He should show greater patience when Beaver interrupts. And he 
should invest more time in adventures with the Beav and less time on the 
golf course.   Credit Dr. James Johnson Human Edge, San Mateo, Ca. - Copely 
Radio Network.  

(EARTH)  Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico are 
using a 3-D super-computer to help them solve the world's biggest jigsaw 
puzzle.  They're trying to determine if the Earth's six continents were 
once one giant land mass.  Dr. John Baumgardner say's explaining the birth 
of a continent is a mojor task.  To conquer it, he's feeding thousands of 
bits of information regarding the Earth's core temperature, it's material 
and chemical makeup and all the known math and physic principals of motion 
into the super-computer.  In less than one second, the super-computer 
solves more than 100,000 math problems and spews out a 3-D simulation of 
how the land may have seperated.  Baumgardner says if the puzzle is still 
perplexing, it could be some pieces are missing. 

ELECTRONIC SHOPPING ZAPS CUSTOMERS
----------------------------------
  Get used to communicating with machines.  The number of electronic 
banking and shopping machines will double by 1988, accounting for 16 
billion dollars in annual retail sales.
  That's the word from Lili Mahlab of Intermark Corporation. She say's by 
the turn of the century you will use electronic shopping machines for one 
in every five dollars you spend.  Take something as simple as purchasing 
hair care products.
  Mahlab says electronic selling gadgets could answer questions even an 
experienced retail salesperson would stumble over.
  Since the number of retail salesmen and saleswomen has declined, Mahlab 
says the machines are a welcome addition to department stores.

Xx Piracy Survey Results  
Hotline BBS Software Piracy Survey  The Hotline Bulletin Board System in an 
Atari ST-oriented system serving the Washington, D.C. metro area. The 
system has been online for nearly four years and has logged over 30,000 
calls.  Approximately 40% of the user base are long distance callers.  For 
a period of twelve weeks, the Hotline conducted a user survey concerning 
software piracy and received over 350 responses.  With the recent crackdown 
on piracy by the software industry, the basic goal of the survey was to get 
some sort of indication of how serious the problem is with Atari users and 
whether or not the piracy crackdown was having any effect on the attitudes 
and actions of consumers as well as BBS Sysops.  

Question #1: ============ Have you ever downloaded copies of copyrighted 
software from a BBS?  Yes: 73% No: 27%  
Question #2: ============ Have you ever -traded- such software through the 
mail?  Yes: 37% No: 63%  
Question #3: ============ Have you ever obtained copies of software from a 
friend or acquaintance?  Yes: 85% No: 15%  
Question #4: ============ Have you ever obtained copies of software from an 
organized Club or User's Group (during/after meetings, etc)?  Yes: 20% No: 
80%  
Question #5: ============ If you answered -yes- to any of the above, how 
many copies of such programs do you own?  10 or Less: 30% 11-25: 14% 26-50: 
4% 51-75: 6% 75 or More: 36% None: 10%  
Question #6: ============ If you answered -yes- to any of the above, what 
is your reasoning for not actually purchasing a copy of the program?  
(Enter as many as you like in your response)  Software is too expensive: 
23%  I wanted to see if it was worth buying first: 22%  I -collect- 
software and don't mean any harm to anyone: 13%  It was available, so I 
copied/ downloaded it: 22%  Other reasons: 15%  Does not apply to me: 5%  
Question #7: ============ If more demonstration programs were available, do 
you think that it would influence your decision on copying programs?  Yes: 
66% No: 34%  
Question #8: ============ Is the software industry trying to keep the cost 
of programs at its lowest possible price?  Yes: 11% No: 89%  
Question #9: ============ Does the fact of whether or not a program is 
copy-protected influence your decision on buying a piece of software?  Yes: 
41% No: 59%  
Question #10: ============= How much software, in terms of dollar amount, 
have you purchased?  Under $100: 26% $100-$250: 18% $251-$500: 20% $501-
$750: 16% $751-$1000:  0% $1001-$1500: 2% $1501-$2000: 4% Over $2000: 14%  
Question #11: ============= Have you noticed fewer, the same amount, or 
more BBS's which feature copyrighted software in their download sections?  
Fewer BBS's: 50% Same Amount: 31% More BBS's: 19%  
Question #12: ============= Is the ability to download copyrighted programs 
from a BBS the primary reason for calling the system?  Yes: 10% No: 90%  
Question #13: ============= Are Bulletin Board Systems your primary means 
of obtaining copyrighted software?  Yes: 25% No: 75%  
Question #14: ============= Has the current crackdown by the software 
industry and the Software Publishers Association had any effect on the 
attitudes of Sysops and Bulletin Board Systems in the trading of 
copyrighted software that you as a user has noticed?  No Effect: 30% Some 
Effect: 49% Lot of Effect: 21%  
Question #15: ============= Do you think the crackdown will have any long-
term effects and will limit the copying of copyrighted software in the 
future?  No Effect: 41% Some Effect: 49% Lot of Effect: 10%  
Question #16: ============= Are you male or female?  Male: 90% Female: 10%  
Question #17: ============= What age category are you in?  13 or Under:  4% 
14-17: 42% 18-25: 18% 26-35: 25% 36-45: 10% 46 or Over: 1%    

Observations: =============  While not a scientifically conducted survey, 
the answers given by the respondents can give the reader a good indication 
as to the  practices and attitudes of the -average- Atari user who is 
involved in telecommunications and frequents Atari Bulletin Board Systems.  
The large majority of the respondents own illegal copies of  software, but 
also have purchased large amounts of programs as well. They're mostly 
teenagers with the second largest age group in the 26-35 category. They 
feel that the current crackdown on piracy will have some short and long 
term effects on Sysops who run pirate BBS's but state that these boards are 
not their primary means of obtaining illegal copies of programs. This may 
be somewhat contradictory with an earlier response that 73% obtain such 
programs directly from BBS's.  
The respondents felt that the software industry is not keeping the cost of 
software at its lowest price possible and were split with whether or not 
copy-protection influenced their decision on buying programs. They were 
decidedly in favor of more demonstration programs and said that this would 
effect their decision on getting illegal copies of programs that  offered 
demo versions.  
When asked to justify their logic for illegally copying programs, the 
answers were almost evenly split between software being too expensive, 
seeing whether or not the program was worth purchasing, and that the 
program was readily and easily available for copying.
  This latter justification may indicate that illegally copying software is 
almost an -automatic- reaction by many Bulletin Board users -- -it was 
there, so I took it.-

  In examining these answers, I regret that I didn't ask users as to 
whether or not they felt that copying software was -morally- wrong.  
Nevertheless, it is evident that the software industry still suffers from 
the image that they're overpricing their programs and  that prospective 
customers have little in the way of finding out if a program is worth 
purchasing or not. More demonstration versions, less copy-protection, and 
an aggressive consumer education campaign may be the best avenue of 
approach by the industry if it ever expects to substantially reduce the 
problem of software piracy.

Xx Zmag update
  Due to the amount of information being gathered and recieved each week, 
the Zmag Systems List will become a separate file.  If your system carries 
Zmag on a weekly basis, Please leave me a message on CompuServe, 
(71777,2140) or on the BBS you got this issue from.   After I get a current 
list together I will upload the file to CompuServe and the Zmag BBS 
Systems.  As of last count, We are currently issuing to 34 BBS systems. To 
be fair to all, I would like to list them all in the weekly issues, but
