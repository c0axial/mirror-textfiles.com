For those interested...

I am currently working a deal with a vendor which already produces a major C
implementation for the ST, PC, Amiga, and Mac, to supply their run-time
library for use with the Turbo-816 (Turbo-C16).  The already have the
run-time for the 6502 and will license it to me for a *VERY* reasonable price.
It is very very good (and fast as it was designed for embedded control
applications) and compact.  Everyone cross your fingers, as this would be a
real breakthrough...

I may also release a Turbo-C08 runtime library at the same time, for people
who are not using the Turbo-816.  So everyone might gain from it, not just
T816 users...although I am banking on the C16 version to be the main one
as the C types will appreciate the extra speed, program size, and RAM
availability that the T816 provides.


To update everyone in a nutshell....

  The 8-bit emulation section of the Turbo OS is considered done...!!!

  The 16-bit section only lacks the insertion and testing of the 
  allocate & execute application routines. 

  Some new features already inserted:

  $E49F DOBANK  xe banked memory control
  $E4A2 CALUSR  BASIC interface to CIO calls
  $E4A5 CALCOS  calculate checksum of memory block
  $E4A8 CLRSCR  clear the screen buffer
  $E4AB SIONOR  direct call to SIO, bypassing PBI routines
  $E4AE CPYBUF  copy up to 64k from-to anywhere in 16Mb range
  $E4B1 FILPAT  fill up to 64k block with specified pattern (16mb rng)
  $E4B4 NATVEC  call CIO function from outside base 64k addresses
  $E4B7 ALLSAV  save all registers (16-bit) and return in EMU mode
  $E4BA ALLRES  restore all registers and return in NAT mode
  $E4BD TBANKT  check and test 'XE' banked memory (up to 256k)
  $E4C0 TBUSST  check Explicit RAM or ROM availability 
  $E4C3 TETRAM  check Expanded RAM availability (up to 8Mb)
  $E4C6 TALLOC  allocate any of the 4 types of memory to an application
  $E4C9 TDEALO  de-allocate memory from an application (TALLOCated)
  $E4CC TINSTA  install  an application
  $E4CF TREMOV  remove an application which was TINSTAlled
  $E4D2 TEXECU  execute an installed application
  $E4D5 TTERMI  terminate an TINSTAlled/TEXECUted application

  Also, a menu program is resident which can select: 

  Coldstart 
  Resident Byte/Atascii memory dumper (16Mb range 128 bytes at a time)
  Memory clear routines for all 4 types of memory 
  RAM/ROM search and logging utility
  Keyboard F/X control 
     cursor to any corner of the screen
     keyboard click toggle
     screen dma control
     SIO noise toggle
     keyboard repeat rate
     keyboard delay rate
  Execute up to 8 resident turbo-applications
  Install/Remove up to 8 turbo devices

  On the hardware side...

  The Turbo-816 Version-2 board design is finalized and the CAD people
    have it in their hands for plotting and auto-routing.  The same applies
    to the ROM/SRAM boards

  The backplane has been finalized

  The dynamic ram board (256k/1m/4m/8m) is currently being finalized.
    Hopefully this will be done by may and boards available in June.

  We are still not satisfied with any video systems which have been
    evaluated...either the quality or the price is not where I want it.

  I would appreciate any comments!

ATARI ANNOUNCES SWEEPING REORGANIZATION; 8-BIT COMPUTER LINES AND HOME VIDEO 
GAMES SOLD TO COLECO; NEW HIGH END WORKSTATIONS ANNOUNCED; HEADQUARTERS MOVES 
TO GERMANY

     Sunnyvale, CA, UPI, 1 April 89

Atari Corporation, an American Exchange Corporation, announced today a sweeping
reorganization plan designed to focus the company on its successful product
lines and make it more competitive globally.

The first step in this new program involves the sale of its 10-year-old
line of 6502-based computers, now known as the XE series, to Coleco.  Also sold
were the home video game lines consisting of the 2600, 7800, and XE
game system.  Coleco, whose last venture into this marketplace was the
Coleco Adam, a widely praised design plagued by engineering difficulties,
and the Colecovision game system.  Purchase terms were not disclosed, but
Atari was believed to have received in excess of fifty thousand dollars in
cash and warrants.

Atari took the industry by surprise by announcing a new workstation product
based on technology first utilized in the company's ST computer line.  The
workstation, based on the Sun Microsystems SPARC processor, uses
Atari proprietary custom chips to handle graphics.  It also uses the
Inmos transputer chips to improve processing power.  This new system,
termed -revolutionary- by company president Sam Tramiel, can achieve
processing speeds in the range of 100 times the speed of an IBM PS/2 model
70, at about the same retail price.  While its primary operating system is
the same as in the Atari ST computers, sophisticated emulation packages were
announced by third parties, allowing it to use MSDOS, OS/2, and Macintosh
software packages.  Despite the software emulation method, the raw
processing speed of this system allows it to actually outperform IBM PCs and
Macintoshes.

The new system, dubbed the Atari FU (for Floating-point Ultimate), is
perceived by industry observers as a potential NeXT-killer.  It features:

    o  Graphics resolution of 2048 x 1600 pixels with 16 trillion colors.   
       The monitor uses LCD-shutter technology described as -3-D capable-.

    o  Internal magneto-optical drive with multiple platter changer,
       total storage of 5 gigabytes online

    o  Interface ports for Ethernet, Appletalk, 2 serial (up to 128 Kbaud), 
       2 parallel, optical mouse, digital quadrophonic sound, and X-10 
       controller

Despite the Atari's history of pre-announcing products, this system
was shown in final form to reporters, and was reported to have arrived in
computer dealer showrooms throughout North America and Europe in time for
this announcement.  U.S. list price on a standard system, including monitor,
laser printer, and 8 megabytes of RAM memory, is $9999.95.

In a less surprising announcement, Atari announced plans to move its
corporate headquarters to Braunschweig, West Germany.  It's U.S. operation will
continue to be headed by Senior Executive Vice President Sig Hartmann,
himself a German immigrant.  According to Chairman and CEO Jack Tramiel, -We
found that with our headquarters in the U.S., our European operations had
achieved their full potential.  By moving my corporate managers to
Germany, we hope to allow the North American operation to do the same.  By
1990, we plan to be the dominant computer company in the U.S.A., the way
we are in countries such as Luxembourg today.-

Wall Street reacted overwhelmingly to these announcements. Atari's stock
closed at 29 1/8, up over 20 points; Apple dropped 5 to 34 3/4, IBM dropped
11 1/8 to 99 1/4, and Coleco dropped 3 to 2 1/2.

 SIX DIE IN FIREY PROTESTS; ATARI SALE HOAX BLAMED

Sparked by an April Fools prank, protest turned to tragedy in dozens of
cities this week.  Six persons were killed and another 13 injured when a 30
foot tall -GEOFFREY- fell, burning, into an angry crowd gathered outside a
-TOYS 'R US- store in sub-suburban Urbana, Alabama.  Minor injuries are
reported from five other locations of similar disturbances.  At least one
suicide attempt seems related to the affair, and Hospital officials in
Middlesex, New Jersey, refuse to release the name of the unfortunate
victim.  However, Mrs. Kovacs says Ron is doing much better now that he knows
that the -sale- was only a joke.

In a scene repeated in towns across the country, thousands of owners of the
ATARI brand of home computers joined in mass burnings of their machines and
software in apparent reaction to a false announcement that ATARI had sold
the line to COLECO, a toy manufacturer best known for -Cabbage Patch Dolls-.  
Hardest hit was the midwest, where Atari dealers are as plentiful as
Burger Kings.  In at least nine cases, the fires raged out of control and 
endangered surrounding buildings.

The largest fires were reported in Southeastern Michigan, where a mob of
thousands of protesters, mostly identified with the militant -CHAOS-
street gang, burned and looted an entire mall.

-They wouldn't sell the ATARI here-- they are responsible!- was shouted by
some as the flames drove customers from the Service Merchandise, K-Mart, Sears,
and Target stores in the Nirvana Plains Mall, near the site where a pair
of major -Atarifests- are still scheduled for this spring.  Local
officials may force the shows to be canceled, fearing another scene.
Ironically, most of the damage was localized in a KAY-BEE store that did
feature an ample supply of cartridges for the game-based systems.  Only a 
block away, owners of Computerland and Inacomp stores hardly looked up during
the fray.  -It's not our affair- sniffed one representative from the
business computer stores.

Sadly, the entire reaction was based on misinformation posted as an April
Fool's joke on the GEnie Telecommunication Service.  In a bogus
press release, Atari was said to have sold its 8-bit computer and game line
to Coleco, and was focusing on a new line of super-desktop computers.
Apparently, the already high-strung Atari computer owners reacted before
finishing reading the entire document, which grew more and more absurd toward
the end.  None of the claims were true.

However, even those who read the entire posting were hard pressed to distinguish
fact from fantasy.  -We've been asked to believe so much through the years,
this was not really that far out of line with product announcements we
received even last year,- said one user-group President who wished to
remain unidentified.  Mr. Sell continued, -The whole thing is blown
out of proportion.  I really deplore the violence anyway.  Besides, those
Cabbage folks know how to crack a market.-

Darlah Pine, chief system operator of the Atari areas of GEnie where the
entire event originated, could not be reached for direct comment.  However,
in a prepared statement, Ms. Pine expressed great sorrow and made a
-heartfelt apology- for having allowed the hoax to occur.  Sources close to
Pine, who also wishes to remain anonymous, say she is in a state of
shock, refusing to believe that she played a part in the disaster that will
mark this hoax as second only to Orson Welles' -War of the Worlds- broadcast
in 1938.

          APRIL FOOL!  AGAIN!

         |ATARI GOES TABLOID!|

Extra-Extra!  Read all about a new publication for Atari 8-bit computer users.
I got a large envelope in the SAGE mail box from a company called Irata Lirpa.
Inside was a newspaper and this letter from its publisher Eno Lirpa:


Dear Sir, 

Your 'Crazy-Eights' column has been reviewed by our editing department.  We
are introducing a weekly publication exclusively for Atari 400/800/XL/XE
computers.  We would like to negotiate a contract with you to write a column
to be published in our weekly.  Enclosed is a copy of the premier issue
for your approval.

Call us soon.  We'll have lunch.

Eno


What a great idea!  There are monthly magazines and newsletters for us
8-bitters but who'd have thought there would be someone crazy enough to put
out a weekly!  Distribution will be radical too.  Eno doesn't plan to have
his newspaper rotting away at bookstores.  No sir!  He plans to distribute to 
supermarket chains!  Put the weekly right where people shop. Fantastic idea.  
This could introduce a whole new audience to our beloved 8-bit computers, 
many of whom may never have wanted to get within 10 feet of a computer.

This could lead to other mergings of computers and shoppers (where have I
heard that before?)  Someday maybe food chains like Krogers will offer a free
software disk with a $50 minimum purchase.  (SIGH), dream on...

I was so impressed I decided to share some of the more interesting articles.


HEADLINE: ASTRONOMERS AMAZED!  ATARI 800 SEEN ON MOON.

Astronomers at the observatory in Sri Lanka were shocked when their huge
telescope, focused on the Moon's surface, revealed a 1979 vintage Atari
800 computer.

-It was just sitting there, next to the B-52 bomber and the statue of Elvis.- 
Scientists fear that whoever put the computer there will be coming back to
Earth for a disk drive and monitor.


HEADLINE: CLEVER BIGAMIST: MAN SECRETLY MARRIED TO 20 WOMEN LIVING IN
THE SAME APARTMENT COMPLEX.

Donald MacDoogal of Cheshire, England was arrested and charged with 20 counts
of bigamy.  Incredibly, not only did none of the women realize they were
married to the same man, but they were all GOOD FRIENDS!

-It was quite easy, really!- beamed Mr.  MacDoogal.  -I used my Atari computer
to juggle my schedule!  MacDoogal was arrested while purchasing a new fuse
for his power strip.


HEADLINE: COMPUTER VIRUS FOUND IN VIDEO GAME CARTRIDGES

A computer virus was discovered in game cartridges stored in an abandonded
warehouse in Encino, California.  The virus displays a variety of messages
that can barely be observed by the average game player.

Experts in the field of subliminal influencing say a message can be programmed 
to flash on the screen for a split second using the interrupt vector.  Children 
could be especially prone, due to the many hours they spend playing games.

The investigation leading to the discovery of the tainted game-cartridges 
began last October after a little girl in Waco, Texas flushed her goldfish 
down the toilet.  -My computer told me to!- she insisted.


HEADLINE: PSYCHICS PREDICT: 1989 BANNER YEAR FOR ATARI

Irata staff-psychic Madam Juanita has released these predictions for Atari in
1989.

-I seeee...Fuji-shaped statue, as eef suspended een mid air and iss speenning!
I seeee...Great bird SOARing by...Now I see zee words -ATARI 130 XE...words 
are also speening and speening-

-Can only mean beeg things for Atari! Soon to make much money from 8-bit
computers!-


Wow!  I just know this LIRPA weekly will be a big success, with articles
like those.  Great side-line stuff, too like this quiz: -Are you
user-friendly?-, or the weekly photo contest, -Cutest baby playing with Atari-.

I give the new supermarket tabloid a big cheer, and here it is:

      A P R I L   F O O L S ! ! ! 


OK, let's dig into our REAL mail bag now.  Here's a letter from Curtis R.
Johnson, acting President of U.F.F.D.A.  of F-M (United, Friendly, Fanatic &
Dedicated Atarians of Fargo-Moorhead).  Some initials, huh?  Curtis wants to
add three reasons to our notorious list of why 8-bits are better than 16!

1. The eight-bits have more cartridges than the 16-bits.

2. You can move the 8-bit easier than the 16-bit. Just take the small box on
the back of the TV, and the 8-bit and some cartridges to a friend's house.
You need to take the monitor with the 16-bit.

3. You can let a child play the 8-bit a) because it is easier to use, and
b) if an accident would happen, it would be less expensive to repair.

Great reasons, Curtis!  Your Complimentary Colorful SAGE labels are in the mail.


If you want to give us your -eight-bit's worth-, here's our address:

SAGE
Att'n -Crazy Eights-
P.O. Box 10562
Erie, PA 16514

You WILL write to Crazy Eights!...You WILL write to Crazy Eights!...You WILL
write to Crazy Eights!...I programmed that message into a million
-Star-Raiders- cartridges!  Why do you think Curtis Johnson wrote?????


Until we meet again, keep it crazy!
