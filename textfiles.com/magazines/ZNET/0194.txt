 ATARI SELLS MANUFACTURING PLANT - Atari has announced that it has signed
 a contract for the sale of its property in Taiwan.  The facility will be
 sold for $60 million, and closing is scheduled for later this month.
 The sale is contingent upon certain conditions of closing being met.
 Atari noted that assembly operations have been relocated in a move to
 increase efficiency and reduce costs.
 
 COMMODORE - issued a number of announcements last week at CES concerning
 new technology, distribution, applications and compatibility for the
 CDTV Interactive Multimedia player.  CDXL will increase the capability
 of the CDTV player by bringing enhanced motion video with no hardware
 upgrade required.  CDTV-PIP is essentially a 1/3-screen window, which
 allows NTSC video to be displayed simultaneously with a running CDTV
 application.  CDTV-PIP is incorporated into a specially designed plug-in
 video card that replaces the current video card yet requires no software
 upgrade.  Commodore announced that CDTV is planned to be compatible with
 Kodak's new Photo CD system.  Photo CDs, planned for June 1992 can store
 up to 100 35mm photographic images on writable CD-ROM discs.
 
 Commodore introduced two new packages this week for its Amiga 500 line.
 The new packages are designed to complement the successful Amiga 500
 Bonus package that is currently offered by Amiga retailers.  The new
 Discovery Pack is an entry-level package, ideal for parents who want a
 computer that their children can use for both education and
 entertainment.  The package features four titles, including KindWords,
 Where in the World is Carmen San Diego?, Ports of Call, Deluxe Paint II.
 The Discovery Pack also includes a TV adapter, which enables the use of
 a television as a monitor.  The suggested retail price is $599.
 
 NEW APPLE SOFTWARE - MacX 1.1.7 is the latest version of Apple's X
 Window System display server for the Macintosh operating system.  It 
 provides X Window System access and functionality for customers using
 Apple Macintosh computers in multivendor environments.  MacX 1.1.7

 operating system and will be available August 1991.  MacX 1.1.7 is $295.
 Upgrades are available for current MacX 1.0 and 1.1 customers for $95.

 NINTENDO UPDATE - Philips has announced that it has granted Nintendo a
 license to develop and market video games on Compact Disc format for
 play on Nintendo's new Super Famicom and Super Nintendo Entertainment
 System 16-bit home video game hardware systems.  The new Compact Disc
 video games, according to Nintendo, will be played on a low cost CD ROM
 -XA Compact Disc player.  Consumers will be able to attach these CD ROM
 -XA players to their Super Famicom and Super NES hardware units.
 
 HP REDUCES PRICES - Hewlett-Packard has reduced the list prices on its
 HP Vectra personal computers by up to 10 percent and on its mass-storage
 products by up to 33 percent.  HP also has reduced the list price of the

 8-Bit Alert:  An aquisition agreement between Michael St. Pierre (of
 Micro Solutions) and Chuck Steinman (of DataQue) has been made which
 will allow DataQue to continue production of the TransKey adapter for
 the Atari Classic computers.  This device will allow you to use a
 standard IBM type keyboard on your favorite machine.  DataQue will
 support anyone who purchased their TransKey from Micro Solutions.
 Contact DataQue, P.O. Box 134, Ontario, OH 44862, USA.
 
 8-Bit Alert:  GEnie telecommunications service has decided to eliminate
 their Atari 8-bit section in their bi-monthly 'LiveWire' publication.
 At first GEnie claimed not be able to find anyone willing to write the
 short section, while now they say -There just is not enough room because
 we have additional new advertisers, and we do not want to increase the
 page count.-  Anyone who feels that the Atari Classic computers deserve
 coverage should contact FEEDBACK on GEnie.
 
 THE 8-BIT STATE -  DIAMOND: A New Look for your Classic Atari
 
 Diamond Graphical Operating System (GOS) from ReeveSoft offers an ST/GEM
 like operating system for the Atari 8-bit series of computers.  You can
 use an ST mouse, joystick, touch tablet, track-ball or your keyboard as
 a pointing device.  Although available for over two years, Diamond has
 been recently reworked to add new features and increase performance.  If
 you've been considering updating your older version or jumping into a
 graphical environment for the first time, Diamond 3.0 is worth looking at.  
 A -stacking- cartridge, Diamond will work alone or with other carts.

 Why would you want a GOS on your classic Atari?  Common claims for
 adding a GOS to a system are 'because the ST has one', or 'it's the wave
 of the future'.  I feel that those are pretty poor reasons to buy
 something.  If a GOS serves some useful purpose, that's a good reason to
 consider adding it.
 
 If you don't like working from a command line interface (SpartaDOS or
 OSS DOS) or DOS menu (AtariDOS or work-alike), then Diamond may be the
 picture to save you typing those thousand words.  Most of the DOS (Disk
 Operating System) functions are available directly from the desktop,
 with little or no typing required.  You can also view and print text
 files, or launch (execute) programs by selecting a file with your
 pointing device.
 
 There are also options on XL/XE machines to exit Diamond to another
 cartridge or to internal BASIC.
 
 While Diamond will work with floppy disk based systems, its real power
 is the ease of use it adds to systems with hard drives.  Moving from one
 directory to another is very simple, using only the pointing device.
 Functions like copying or deleting files are just as simple, although
 being so simple makes it so easy, the proverbial two year old can simply
 make a mess in no time.
 
 One of the major new features of Diamond 3.0 the file selector, now
 incorporated into the cartridge.  With this improvement, new
 applications (programs) will not have to provide their own selector.  It
 frees up valuable memory and provides a consistent interface for
 programs which use the selector.
 
 Another nice addition to Diamond is that the type of DOS being used is
 automatically detected, saving the user from having to enter that 
 information.  The desktop colors and pointing device are also user
 selected and saved in a configuration file.  This small file is loaded
 from disk when Diamond is started up.
 
 For drawing pictures, ReeveSoft offers Diamond Paint.  With Paint, you 
 can load and save in many different picture formats including, clip-art,
 Micro Illustrator, and straight binary.  All of the normal drawing
 utilities are provided, including cut and paste.
 
 Diamond Write is a word processor which offers a single user selectable
 font at a time, but multiple styles of that font possible.  A variety of
 fonts are supplied, including an 80 column emulation font.  Other
 features are user programmable margins and justification.
 
 Diamond News Station ($29.95) will allow you to turn out professional
 looking small newsletters and documents with pictures, multiple-sized
 text in various fonts, and clip art.  Pages are broken into eight
 plates, and you can edit one plate at a time in a -WYSIWYG- (What You
 See Is What You Get) fashion.
 
 ReeveSoft offers the $29.95 Diamond Develop package for those with a
 desire to program applications with all those windows popping and dialog
 boxes growing.  Diamond Develop assumes you know assembly language, and
 have the MAC/65 assembler (available from ICD, Inc).  ReeveSoft offers to
 refund the cost of Develop to programmers who write a 'significant'
 application for Diamond.

 There are a few rough spots in the Diamond desktop system.  First, you
 must avoid using sub-directory names which have extensions.  Second, if
 you want to exit Diamond back to the resident DOS, it isn't simple--and
 it should be.  If there are functions your DOS supports which are not
 supported directly by Diamond, the only option provided is to exit
 Diamond.  Third, the new file selector seems to be reluctant to keep
 filenames and directories inside the selector box with SpartaDOS.  At
 times the SpartaDOS timestamp spills outside the file area of the
 selector box, overwriting other information on the screen.
 
 Finally, the Diamond utilities (Write, Draw) and News Station, suffer
 from little quirks here and there.  While they don't prevent the use of
 the programs, they do impair the ease of use that a graphical user
 interface should provide.  The Diamond GOS itself does seem to be very
 stable, and Reevesoft seems committed to continued support.
 
 The full Diamond package currently runs $79.95 and includes the
 cartridge plus the Write and Paint applications.  Upgrading from an
 earlier version of the Diamond GOS cartridge is $30.  Diamond systems
 are by ReeveSoft, 29W150 Old Farm Lane, Warrenville, IL 60555, (708)
 393-2317.
 
 MAC/65 and SpartaDOS are from ICD Inc., 1220 Rock Street, Rockford, IL

 and Compuserve.  An avid supporter of the Atari Classic Cause, Chuck is
 known for several Public Domain, Shareware, and commercial products sold
 under the DataQue name.  Of several dozen of the 8-bit systems, the only
 models not in his vast collection are the 65XE and XEGS. (Anyone have
 either of those to sell cheap?)

 
 Xx RUMBLES..RAMBLES...RUMORS
 ============================
 by Stan Lowell
 
 What, Why, Where
 ----------------
 Question: -Where is ZMAG, where have you been, what are you doing, plus
 a few other unprintable things...-
 
 Answer: I got out of 'Sync' with ZMag when everybody took their
 vacations.  All -heck- broke loose nearly everyplace.  I hope to get
 back in the swing of things and just be 'late' with these articles
 (instead of gone).  My thanks to those of you who missed me and
 expressed concern.  My apologies to those who have been lamenting and
 languishing, I'll try and do better.
 
 STart/Antic
 -----------
 As most are aware, Start has ceased publication.  Will it surface again
 with another publisher/name/format?  We are all waiting to find out.
 Will it contain any 8-bit info?  We can hope for the best, but probably
 not too likely.  Where can we get information?  ZMagazine, your LOCAL
 user group, your local BBSs, AtariUser magazine, user group publications
 like PSAN, Current Notes, AIM, etc., and just about any BBS that offers
 a Networked Atari(8-bit?) message base.

 If you call a BBS with a networked message base, be active.  Leave a
 message answering a question, or asking one.  Leave a message thanking
 the SysOp(s) for having the base availiable for you.  If you don't use
 it, you may lose it!  If all you do is download files, the SysOp may
 wonder why he is putting out the effort and expense to support us!
 SysOps NEED an -Attaboy- every now and then!  At this point in time, we
 would be in deep sneakers without them!
 
 More on Inter-BBS Networking
 ----------------------------
 After further checking into the Inter-BBS Networking, Bob Puff and Craig
 Carter have come up with a universal format for it.  After hearing many
 good things about Craig and his programming prowess, I spoke with him.
 Craig was very helpful and informative.  He expects to have -something-
 out around -the end of summer.-  Craig recently released his Pro SysOp's
 Toolkit to the Public Domain.  From what I have heard from Pro SysOps,
 it is VERY handy!

 Rumors
 ------
 The Chicago Atari Show will have a *room* dedicated to the 8-bits?
 
 New things are in the works for the -old- Supra interface now owned and
 sold by K-Products.

 Not a rumor, but fact: K-Products has purchased -Hardback.-  Bob Klass
 plans some 'changes' to it, and a price reduction from $39.95 to $20.00!
 Anyone purchasing it NOW will get the updated version when released.

 BBS Express! Pro Multiline
 --------------------------
 BBS Express! Pro Multiline is out!  It is alive and well and running on
 several 8-bit boards.  Also availiable are the batch upload mods for use

 Say, Whatever Happened to...
 ----------------------------
 One of the things that Craig Carter told me, was that Bill Wilkinson was
 still around to answer questions about 8-bits.  For a long time Bill's
 article was the ONLY reason to buy Compute! magazine!  He knew lots of
 stuff about the Atari 8-bits.   It was *ALWAYS* a pleasure to read his
 column (he even mentioned the -NCT Turbo 810- once)!

 Humor...

 The following message is from my BBS.  I thought it was funny, so
 thought that I would share it.  (If you just got in after spending a few

 Straight from the home office in Sunnyvale, CA.  Late Night with Dave A!
 presents the Top 10 reasons you should still own an Atari 8-bit computer:
 
 10) Gives Coleco Adam owners someone to share misery with.
 9) Using it on Friday nights keeps you from watching Full House.
 8) Time has never been better to make a killing in the 8-bit Atari
    magazine market.
 7) Commodore 64 is too lightweight to make really good door-stop.
 6) Just t'aint fittin' to buy one of those gosh-darned new-fangled ST
    contraptions.
 5) Don't have to worry about blowing Christmas Club money on software
    for yourself.
 4) Nintendo is really last gasp Communist effort at world domination.
 3) Ashamed kids actually look better with bags on their heads.
 2) Can explain Star Wars defense system to Dan Quayle using Missle
    Command game.

 And the number one reason to still own an Atari 8-bit!!!!!!:

 1) Looks great on your desk next to the Beta VCR and 8-track tape player!

 (Just a joke, Ok folks???)

                     Dave A!

 Xx ICD 8-BIT BLOW-OUT SALE
 ==========================
 
 Yes, it's true.  The time has finally arrived for ICD to clear out the
 800/XL/XE 8-Bit line of products, dust off the shelves and make room for
 more inventory.  Our basic reason for this sale is that we can no longer
 show any profit margins for these products, nor produce any large
 quantities to keep in stock, but we can and will continue to support the
 end-users.
 
 Because of Atari's decision to drop the XL/XE line, followed immediately
 by the decline and fall of 8-Bit support throughout the national dealer
 community, ICD must close out our complete stock of 8-Bit products,
 including both the OSS, Inc., and ICD, Inc. lines.  However, we will
 continue to provide quality technical support during the warranty period
 of these close-out products.

 As heartbreaking as this news may be to you and us, the truth is that it
 had to happen sooner or later.  To be honest, it was later.  We at ICD,
 long supporters of the 8-Bit Atari community, have held out for as long
 as we possibly could manage.  There is, however, one bright note in this
 sale.  It is YOU, the end-user, who benefits from the Super ICD Blowout
 Clearance Sale!
 
 Our entire stock of 8-Bit items, including spare manuals, parts, pieces,
 and assorted used equipment, must go now!  For information on purchasing
 parts and assorted components to these products, call ICD voice at (815)
 968-2228.
 
 Everything from our door-opening US Doublers and SpartaDOS, the complete
 line of OSS programming languages (including Personal Pascal for the
 Atari ST, the only ICD ST product included in his sale), all the way up
 the line to our Multi I/O (MIO) interfaces and the all-new SpartaDOS X
 cartridge.
 
 We are determined to see that you have the products that you need to
 survive, so rather than drop the line completely and toss all of our
 hard work into a dusty corner, we also intend to sell the rights to
 these products!  Once the rights have been sold, the new owner(s) can
 continue to manufacture all these superior products just for you.  If
 you are interested in the rights to these items, please call ICD voice
 to discuss terms.
 
 Have you been looking high and low for your ICD product manual?  Is your
 copy bent, folded, stapled, mutilated, torn up and dog-eared?  For that
 matter, did your dog eat it?  Have you taken so many notes in it that
 you can't read the original text?  It doesn't matter!  Whatever reason
 you have for wanting a new manual, now is the time to get your new copy.
 We have a few spares, and they are now on sale!
 
 Never underestimate the power of your Atari 8-Bit computer system,
 regardless of which one you own.  These systems have been well
 developed, and frankly, are the most researched and documented home
 computer systems available.  There has never been a more widespread
 appreciation for these computers.  They were the -Cutting Edge- in their
 time, and still are for the new computer user.  These systems are
 excellent starter systems, perfect for the children of the die-hard club.

 Unfortunately for all of us, those in Atari Corp that make the decisions
 sometimes do so in haste.  This, then, directly affects dedicated 8-Bit
 users, and we come full circle to where we are today...suffering
 withdrawal symptoms.
 
 Suffer no more!  ICD is offering you one final chance to own those
 products that you have been saving your hard-earned pennies for, for so
 long.  There are litterally thousands of folks out there that have
 learned to use these systems, and are willing to assist you in every
 effort to learn and understand them, not counting ICD.  This is your
 last chance to buy them from ICD!  Once our stock is depleted, your
 chance is gone.
 
 Almost all of these products are now on sale at over 50% off!  Get them
 while they are available.  This sale will end sooner than you think
 since products will now be in demand at these prices.  Don't wait!
 You've been warned!
 
 You can order these items on the ICD Support BBS (815-968-2229), where
 the sale prices are ALREADY on-line!  Please don't ask if you can get
 any better prices.  You can't...anywhere!  The prices listed are already
 over 50% off!

 Xx ATARI 8-BIT UPDATE
 =====================
 New and useful Information
 by Eugene R. Case
 
 (C)1991 ERC Products. ERC Products are in the Public Domain, and This
 text may be re-printed, as long as this (C) Notice, and all text are not
 altered, or edited, and Full Credit is given the Author.
 
 So as of last writing, you all hopefully took heart, and wrote all those
 companies I gave the addresses for.
 
 On that note, CSS' Ron (don't know his last name) has sold the rights to
 CSS to none other than Bob Puff, yep, the writer of the BobTerm, and
 Super ARC/UnARC, Disk Communicator, and maker of the Black Box.  Ron is
 moving to the west, as his wife is an RN, and is being transferred to
 the west, and his daughter (2) will need that attention that only a
 parent can.  I feel CSS is in good hands, and Bob will enhance it even
 more.  The CSS name will probably be changed, and all of those who know
 and love CSS will obviously Panic.  Don't worry, Bob will come through.

 It will help all of those who want that help, and give those information
 that was either, unavailable, or just not within your reach.  As far as
 NEW software is concerned, there is a BBS in Texas, Called -The
 Excalibur BBS- in San Antonio, and there's a user there that posted a
 reply to someones message, about a shop there that still sells several
 titles for the XL/XE, and still has some in stock.  The Repair Shop BBS,
 home of the New (C) holder for Express Pro!, and the old Supra Hard
 Drive Interface, now the KPI Hard Drive Interface, for the XL/XE, (XE
 with the PBI Adaptor from ICD), Networks with that particular BBS in
 Texas.  I asked that person what the address is, and I am still waiting
 on the Net for the Reply.  That is soon to come.
 
 I personally have recently acquired several Atari games that were either
 not actually released, or just saw the first dawn of the Retailers
 Shelf, and then was never to be seen again.  First is Moon Patrol, that
 Arcade Game that was a Favorite of mine, and I'm sure others too.  The
 Graphics are Excellent for an 8-Bit thought Dead, and the Game is of
 great importance to those who are new to the Atari world, or even an Old
 Hand at the Atari.  If the writer of the program had a little more
 ingenuity, the 3-D effect would be phenominal.  It's not too prevalent,
 but if you look hard, you can grasp the effect well enough to actually
 see the 3-D.
 
 The next game is James Bond.  This little game is ok for what it is, and
 could have been a great one, if the Atari world was still happening when
 this was written.  You are JB in a boat, and venture through 4 different
 Movies.  These are interesting to say the least, and entertaining too.
 
 Another is Drop Zone.  Not too easy a Shoot'em up type game.  Though
 this one has several things you must do to complete a section/zone, it
 still has a great appeal to be played.  The graphics are Arcade style,
 and it can be played, as other games can, by two players.
 
 So you say these are just USELESS Games?  Well, as do some others, this
 doesn't mean that the Atari 800XL/130XE is just a GAME MACHINE.  If
 you've been reading up on Atari, they have put a package together, that
 includes the 520STfm, a Color Monitor, and several -GAMES- and some
 Utilities, and are calling it the -Super ST Game Machine- Blowout.  This
 was in the Computer Shopper last year, and since that time, it has come
 about.

 As I look back and see the NEWS items that were printed up in various
 Atari Support Magazines, it makes me wonder just how far Atari has taken
 the 8-Bit, and why the Atari we all know, and some love, has taken a
 BACK SEAT to all the other manufacturers.  I was discussing this point
 with a Club Secretary/News Letter Editor, Harvey Cannon, and he said
 -Sam Tramiel, had Signed and agreement with Commodore, to not make, or
 continue making, the Atari 800XL/130XE Computer in the US.-  This made
 no sense to me.  That would give Commodore the MARKET so to speak, for
 the 8-Bit line.  This is part of the reason Atari has discontinued the
 support and software, for the XL/XE.  Another thing he told me, -The
 USER is what made the computer happen, not the software companies.-
 Well this is also true.  I have several newletters I wrote for an Atari
 Club I was in, in California, and I was Blasting alot of the 8-Bit users
 there, because I saw no USER Support for the Atari.  If those USERs that
 -Pirated- software, had taken the time to Write New Software, instead of
 -Cracking- someone elses, the Atari Community would have flourished, and
 abounded with software.

 If there are any of you left out there, please take the time to -Create-
 new material, not -Hack- at an old piece and then -Distribute- it for
 Money, or just because, send it to a BBS for that critical upload count
 that you so desperately want.  That is actual -Piracy-, and against the
 law.

 As for new, and useful software, well this is being written on an Atari
 800XL with the Rambo XL (C) ICD installed, and a Beta Test version of
 TextPro, TextPro 4.55XE.  It has several of the abilities that prior
 versions have, and more.

 Since I am on this subject, well I had sent a Message to Ronnie Riche,
 on the Support BBS, The Multi Bug BBS in Louisiana, asking him to
 incorporate a way to determine the actual -RAM- size of your computer.
 Say you have the Rambo XL, it had that extra boost to 512K, and your
 Text file is oh...60K or so.  Wouldn't you want your Editor to handle
 that without that ,C command at the end of the Load D:FILENAME.EXT,C?
 15K is small, and the original TextPro had a full 20K Editor.  It should
 have gotten Bigger, not smaller.  Just think, you could read an entire
 copy of -Z*MAG/A\ZINE-, and not continue to load it everytime you came
 to the end of the first portion of the text.  Another feature that would
 be a help to all of the people that use a Word Processor everyday, is a
 Spell Checker.  Something like Fleet Systems II had.  This would help, I
 think, several people who are -BAD SPELLERS- to get it right.  Also the
 Fleet Systems II for the Commodore had a Theausaurus, and that utility
 for TextPro 5.0 would be a great enhancement for those who know they
 want to specify in an out of way manner, a specific statement.

 Well, all of those who are BBS Users, the SysOp of the Southern Nevada
 Atari Computer Club, SNACC, runs the SNACC BBS, and is a programmer at
 that.  He wrote a little program for the Express Pro! BBS, and what it
 does is tell you when you log on, there are NEW FILES in SIG # and such,
 and asks you if you want to Jump to the Sigs.  This is a great
 enhancement to his BBS, and the program is Share Ware, and to get a demo
 version, call GEnie, or The SNACC BBS to see what this is.  702-438-2208
 at 3/12/2400 24Hrs.  I would reccomend ATASCII for all.  ST users, well
 VT52 is your option.  This file pointer, is not only in my opinion, a
 help, but the Next best thing to actually having the BBS just Jump you
 right to the File Sigs, and Automatically DL the New Files for you, but
 that would take all the fun out of BBSing.

 Well that's about all for this time, so if you, or someone you know, is
 interested in a Computer, make sure of two things.

 1: Am I going to PLAY GAMES on it ALL the time?
 2: If I am using this for Desktop Publishing, what should I use, and how
    much MEMORY do I need?
 
 In answer to 1.  If I plan on playing games all of the time, I don't
 need a COMPUTER, but a Game Machine.  Lynx, Gameboy, NES, Neo-Geo, or
 several other Atari products, the 7800, 2600, or 5200 Game Machines.
 Even the original Pac-Man Home game, a friend of mine has one, and it's
 a Classic to say the least.

 In answer to 2.  Since all computers have the ability to do word
 processing, graphic processing, typesetting, and general page layout,
 the choice is yours.  Memory for the Atari is no longer a LIMITing
 factor.  Last time I told you about RAM Upgrades.  Ease of use, and
 availabilty of Software will determine the Hard Core Desk Topper, and
 those who have some inkling of it, well choose a small system first,
 then you can either, upgrade the system, or get a completely new system.

 Well all you Atarians keep it cool, and tell a friend you can do all
 these, and more with an Atari Computer System, be it 800XL/130XE, or
 even the ST.  These are great systems, and have many years of useability
 over most others.  Remember, this is an Atari 8-Bit Program that the
 text you are reading was created on.

 TextPro is (C)1986/1991 Ronnie Riche
 RamboXL is (C)1986 ICD. Inc.
 Atari, 800XL, 130XE, ST are (C) Trademarks of Atari Inc.

  *before* Atari announced they would cease marketing the Atari 8-bit,
  but would continue to do repairs, etc. - Stan)

 Xx WAACE ATARIFEST '91 UPDATE
 =============================
 
 This posting is an attempt to answer some questions that have been posed
 in recent weeks.  Hardcopy vendor packets will be sent out around the
 15th of June.
 
 The Fest is scheduled for 12 and 13 October '91.  The show hours are
 from 10 to 5 both days.  We also expect to sponsor some special events
 on Friday evening.
 
 The show will feature a full round of seminars and demonstrations.
 There will also be a swap meet.  There will be a cocktail party and a
 banquet on Saturday evening.
 
 The Fest will be held at the Sheraton Reston Hotel in Reston, VA, which
 is within 20 minutes of downtown Washington, DC and within 5 minutes of
 Dulles International Airport.
 
 This is the same location we used last year.  For those who did not make
 the '90 event let us simply say that this is a pleasant, spacious
 conference facility located in a parklike suburban setting with plenty
 of free parking.
 
 Hotel rates are $59 per night for single or double occupancy, $66 for
 triple and quad.  These rates are valid from October 10th through the
 13th.  Virginia hotel tax (4.5%) must be added to the above prices.  In
 order to obtain these rates you must mention WAACE AtariFest '91 when
 making your reservations.
 
 The admission price has not been determined yet except to say that show
 visitors who are guests of the hotel will receive a free ticket for each
 night that they book (limited to two tickets per room per day).
 Registered show workers will also receive free two-day passes.
 
 Members of non-WAACE Atari User groups may register as show workers and
 receive a free two-day pass.  Please contact the WAACE representitives
 below for details on registering as show workers.

 The basic rate for a single booth will be $500.  There is a 30% discount
 for vendors who reserve their booth space before 31 July (by including a
 50% deposit with their reservation).
 
 The booth payment is for a single 8 x 8 ft booth.  Pipe and drape
 decoration, electrical outlets, tables, and chairs are provided.  Prices
 for multiple booths are as follows: 2 - $850, 3 - $1100, 4 - $1350.
 
 A one half page ad in the WAACE Atarifest '91 Program is included in the
 single booth price.  Vendors may upgrade the half page ad to a full page
 for $75.  Standard full page ads may be purchased for $125.

 Note: Small vendors that wish to pool their resources and share a booth
 space may do so, but must elect a single point of contact with WAACE for
 vendor business transactions.

 In addition to participating as a vendor at the AtariFest, WAACE
 provides additional areas for Atari developers and User Groups to
 participate:
 
 Seminars : One hour long presentations of topics of interest to the
 Atari community.  Interested seminar presentors should contact the

 Xx THE PROGRAMMER'S WORKSHOP
 ============================
 by Dave Arlington, JACG
 
 It's true folks.  Programmer have become sexy.  Sure there used to be a
 day when programmers were viewed as faceless entities huddled in a
 basement over an Atari computer.  Nowadays though, are there any active
 8-bit users who are not familiar with names such as Roy Goldman (Daisy
 Dot), Ron Riche (TextPro), Bob Puff (BobTerm), and our guest for the May
 meeting, Kris Holtegaard.  I think this sudden surge in popularity for
 programmers has to do with the fact that these fine folks are viewed
 (and rightly so) as the last remaining lifeline for the 8-bit line of
 computers.
 
 But hey, why let them have all the fun?  This column is the start of a
 series aimed at imtermediate level programming types (or those who want
 to become so) to teach all those neat tricks that all the pros know how
 to do.  Originally, I had done a tutorial for Action!, and while it was
 well recieved outside our group, there didn't seem to be enough people
 interested in Action! in the JACG to attempt to start it up again.
 
 So, this time around, this column will attempt to cover ALL the major
 ATARI languages I can think of.  For me, this means BASIC, Action!,
 PASCAL, C, LOGO, and even some Assembly Language.  (Sorry to all you
 diehard PILOT programmers out there!)  For example, this column has
 demos in four different languages.  Also, I will try not to
 'chapter'-ize this series like the Action! tutorial.  That way, if you
 miss an issue of the newsletter or come in late, you won't be totally
 lost.  Each entry will be more of a stand-alone module.
 
 So, before we start, let's cover a few ground rules.  First, you should
 get a minimum set of necessary tools.  The things you should have in
 your possesion by next month (and should be part of any serious
 programmer's toolbox) is the following:
 
 A calculator that has hexadecimal numbers.  They are pretty cheap these
 days and as you'll find out why next month, very, very handy to have.
 I'll explain more next month, but try to get your hands on one.
 
 A few good Atari reference books.  The more, the better and the ones Tom
 Graf suggests above are an excellent start.  At a very minimum, get a
 good memory map book like Mapping The Atari.
 
 And of course, _your_ favorite language.  One word of caution.  I am
 reluctantly including BASIC so as to reach the widest audience, but I do
 have my standards!  For that reason, I will be using Turbo BASIC, the
 public domain BASIC from Germany that is easily available from our club
 library.  You can try following along with Atari BASIC, but I can
 guarantee you'll have a very hard time converting from the things we can
 do in Turbo BASIC to Atari BASIC.  So please, if you don't already have
 a copy, get a copy of Turbo BASIC from the club.  You'll end up thanking
 me!  (Oh, and if you're using something like BASIC XL or BASIC XE, you
 should be all right with those for the things we'll do.)

 The other languages I'll be using for this column are Action!,
 Lightspeed C for the C programs, Kyan PASCAL for the PASCAL programs,
 Atari LOGO for the LOGO programs, and MAC/65 for the Assembly Language
 listings.  I know the public domain ACE C is an OK substitute for
 LightSpeed C, and you can probably get by with the Atari Assembler/
 Editor cart instead of MAC/65.  There is a public domain PASCAL, Draper
 PASCAL, but as I've never seen it, I can't vouch for how compatible it
 is with Kyan PASCAL.  (This, of course, does not mean you have to worry
 about any more than one language,  YOUR  favorite.  Just look for those
 listings and ignore all the other languages unless you want to learn
 something about how those languages work.
 
 As far as the level of expertise I expect you to have to make good use
 of this column, it goes like this: Action! programmers should have read
 the first five parts of my previous tutorials and feel comfortable with
 that stuff.  BASIC programmers should know how to do IF-THENs, FOR-NEXT
 loops, GOTOs, and GOSUBs.  C and PASCAL folks should know the similar
 things (and also WHILEs and REPEAT-UNTILs), but I understand that some
 of you are not that familiar with these languages and I hope you'll be
 able to learn something about them by comparing them to the one(s) you
 know.  I'm mostly presenting LOGO for instructional purposes and to
 prove it is a very useful language, so if any LOGO programmers really
 exist out there, please let me know!
 
 So, you have a month to pick up a calculator, a reference book, and a
 copy of Turbo BASIC if you need one.  And I'll see you next month!
 What's that?  Did I mention demo programs above?  Oh yeah, sorry, there
 is one thing I want to talk about before I wrap up; something that is
 left over from the Action! tutorials.
 
 I got some nice comments from across the country on the Action!
 tutorials, but a couple of knowledgeable Atari users told me I had made
 a mistake in one of the parts where I was comparing Action! to C.  I had
 mentioned that Action! was not a recursive language like C or PASCAL and
 a couple readers pointed out to me that this was not true, that Action!
 could indeed handle recursion.  Well, they seemed to know their stuff,
 so I gave it another look.
 
 The conclusion?  I guess it depends how you define recursion.  If you
 define recursion simply as a language having the capability of calling a
 procedure, function, or subroutine from within the procedure or function
 itself, then yes, I guess Action! is recursive.  However, I think you
 have to have a little stricter definition of recursion than that.  Using
 the definition above,  ALL  Atari languages that I know of are recursive
 and the term really doesn't mean anything any more.  So, I claim that
 Action! is NOT recursive for reasons I'll show in a couple of paragraphs
 from now.
 
 First though, I need to have a little discussion of global and local
 variables; what that means, what they are, and how they are used.  Let's
 say you start a programming club and one day you read a great book on
 Atari computers, De Re Atari.  You think this book is so good, you think
 everyone in the club should use this book.  Now, if there is only one
 copy of this book for the entire club, then whatever one person does to
 the book affects everyone in the club.  If Joe K. writes in the margins,
 and Sam C. cuts out some pages, and Dave N. spills coffee all over it,
 everyone in the club has to live with those written on, coffee stained,
 cut out pages.

 This is the concept of global variables.  These are the only kind of
 variables that BASIC has.  For instance, if you declare a variable BOOK
 in your BASIC program, then if it gets changed somewhere in the program,
 regardless of which subroutine or part of the main program it gets
 changed in, it takes effect in the whole program.  There is only one
 copy of the BOOK varaible existing in the program at any time.
 
 Now let's go back to our programming club analogy and say that instead
 of having one book for the entire club, everybody in the club gets their
 own copy of De Re Atari.  Now it doesn't matter if Joe K. writes in the
 margins of his book, and Sam C. cuts out pages of his book, none of that
 affects _YOUR_ copy of De Re Atari.  You still have all the pages in
 your copy with no writing on them.
 
 This is the concept of local variables.  BASIC doesn't have them, but
 Action!, C, PASCAL, and LOGO all have them.  You can pass variables to a
 procedure or function and have the procedures or functions use their own
 private copies of the variable you passed, just like each club member
 had their own private copy of De Re Atari.  Look at the first demo
 program below:

 EXAMPLE 1

 PROC Test2(BYTE num)

   num==+5
   PrintBE(num)
 RETURN

 PROC Test1(BYTE num)

  num==+5
  PrintBE(num)
  Test2(num)
  PrintBE(num)
 RETURN

 PROC main()

 BYTE num

  num=5
  PrintBE(num)
  Test1(num)
  PrintBE(num)
 RETURN

 OK, here's the blow by blow.  In the main program, the variable num us
 declared and given the value of 5 which we print.  We then call the
 Test1 procedure which gets its own local copy of num which it adds 5 to
 to get 10, which we print.  Then it calls the Test2 procedure which gets
 its own local copy of num and also adds 5 to it to get 15 which we print
 again and the RETURN.  Now we're back in the Test1 procedure, but
 remember, it's copy of num like Test2's is local and not affected by
 what happens in the Test2 procedure.  So when we print it out again in
 Test1 after Test2 ends, it still has the value of 10.  And likewise,
 when Test1 ends and we get back to the main program, the main program's
 copy of num is unaffected by what happened in the two Test procedures
 and still has the value of 5 as you'll see if you compile the program
 and run it.

 Now let's combine what we just learned about global and local variables
 with recursion (procedures of functions calling themselves).  The
 following 4 programs all look alike and are supposed to do the same
 thing.  Basically, they take a number and count up to it.  For instance,
 if you do COUNTDOWN 5 in LOGO, you will see the numbers 1 through 5
 printed on the screen in order.  Now, I did say they're supposed to all
 do the same thing.  One does not.  First, the examples:

 EXAMPLE 2 - LOGO

 TO COUNTUP :NUM
 IF :NUM > 1 [COUNTUP :NUM - 1]
 PRINT :NUM
 END


 EXAMPLE 3 - PASCAL

 PROGRAM Demo(Input,Output);

 PROCEDURE Countup(num:Integer);

 BEGIN
  IF num > 1 THEN Countup(num - 1);
  Writeln(num);
 END;

 BEGIN
  Countup(3)
 END.


 EXAMPLE 4 - C

 countup(num)
 int num;
 $(
  if(num > 1)
    countup(num - 1);
  printf(-%d\n-,num);
 $)

 main()
 $(
  countup(3);
 $)

 EXAMPLE 5 - Action!

 PROC countup(BYTE num)

  IF num > 1 THEN
    countup(num - 1)
  FI
  PrintBE(num)
 RETURN

 main()

  countup(3)
 RETURN

 Now, you can probably guess by now, it is the Action! version that does
 not work like it should.  Why not?  Well, first, how does the program
 work?  Like our other example, when the program first starts countup is
 called with a value of 3, and it keeps a local copy of that variable
 handy.  It checks and sees that num is greater than one, so it calls
 the countdown procedure from within itself with the value of num - 1
 (or 2).  countup(2) calls yet another countup procedure (since 2 is
 still greater than one).  So, by now, we have three versions of the same
 function running at the same time and they all havee their own local
 copies of the num variable.  countup(1) finally is not greater than 1,
 so it prints 1 and then ends.  Back to countup(2) which prints the value
 of its local num variable which is still 2 and it ends.  And so on.

 Well, the key as to why this works OK in C, PASCAL, and LOGO but not in
 Action! has to do with how these languages handle local variables.  In
 C, PASCAL, and LOGO, when a new procedure is called while another is
 still running, the value of local variables are stored temporarily in a
 special place in memory called the stack (which we'll discuss in detail
 in a later column).  Then when they are needed again, they are pulled
 out of memory with their original values intact.  So, in these
 languages, if three versions of countup are running all at the same
 time, their local variables all have three different places in memory
 where they are stored where they won't affect each other.
 
 Action!, however, doesn't play by these rules.  When you compile any
 procedure, in this case countup, it only sets aside  ONE  place in
 memory for each of its local variables.  So, no matter when or where you
 call the countup procedure, the local variable always get stored in the
 same place.  Action! doesn't take recursion into account in this scheme.
 For instance, in the example program, when your call countup(2) from
 countup(3), the 2 gets stored in the same place where the 3 used to be!
 Likewise, countup(1) overwrites the 2 with a 1.  So when countup(1) ends
 and we go back to countup(2), it looks in the local variable storage
 place and sees a 1!  So instead of counting up to 3 like the other three
 versions, Action! just prints three 1s.

 So that's why I claim Action! is not a recursive language.  You can't
 have your cake and eat it too.  If you have a language that wants to
 have local variables  AND  recursion, that recursion isn't any good if
 it doesn't keep the values of local variables intact after it is done.
 Note that BASIC doesn't get involved in this discussion since it does
 not have local variables at all.

 Now, to get you in the spirit of this column, here's a challenge for
 next month.  Write a COUNTUP PROCedure in either TURBO BASIC or Action!
 that simulates local variables.  You'll need a place in memory to store
 your local variables and some sort of pointer to know which local
 variable you want to access when.  HINT: Page 6 (locations 1536 and on)
 is a good place for BASIC to use.  In Action!, I'd think about an array
 to hold them.
 
 Answers to the challenge will appear next month along with the
 friendliest guide to (please don't run away until you've read it!)
 hexadecimal numbers you'll ever see.  And I promise to someday talk
 about just where Action! does store those local variables and how you
 can use it to your advantage.  'Til next month!

 Jack Tramiel is planning to shut down Atari's production line in Taiwan.
 In remarks posted on a bulletin board service after he met with Atari
 owners in Massachusetts, the Atari chairman said that under the right
 conditions computers could be constructed in the US with the same cost
 efficiency as in Taiwan.  Tramiel set no deadline for the manufacturing
 changeover but he did indicate the move was not in the immediate future.
