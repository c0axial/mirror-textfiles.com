<*> PC PURSUIT UPDATE
##############################
by WK Whitton

I happy to report that I have good news for y'all. I got off the phone
this morning (Thursday Jan. 5) with the folk at PC Pursuit. After my
lengthy wait in line, the kind demeanor of Mr. John Taylor was refreshing
and surprising. He informed me that due to the tirade of messages
regarding the price increase and hour cap, the folk in marketing have
decided to put off the cap until May 1st of this year. This would give
them time to study the messages, and decide what they are going to do.
That, as they say, is the good news.

He was frank and made it known that what PC Pursuit was attempting to do
was to make the service as good as possible, quote: -for as many users as
possible-. The lengthy time it took us all to catch a node, and many
other conveniences, would need to be addressed. You can see that they did
indeed intend to make to cause some users to leave the service, but were
surprised at both the volume and intensity of emotion of the users who
both wrote letters, and resigned from the service en masse.

It is the  opinion of this humble writer that there is -no acceptable loss
of life- is this or any other situation! He was cold to the suggestion
that the rates be raised slightly, no cap be placed on the hours, and the
extra money be used to place more modems online for the users. I guess
this was just too easy of a solution eh? 

My recommendations? At the present time, these ideas come to mind:

1. Buy a US Robotics HST 9600 baud modem, and enjoy the *CLEAR* and *FAST*
   lines of AT&T.

2. Consider the new service on Genie of $50 a month for unlimited chat
   capabilities. You could meet those friends you made on the bulletins
   boards right here on Genie, and enjoy it in real-time, something you
   couldn't do on Genie.

3. Write a letter to the major phone service companies, and explain what
   has happened with PC Pursuit. There is a large chunk of money to be
   made here, and one of them surely will take on the challenge of
   providing this service.

4. Continue writing PC Pursuit about this matter, it may for some unknown
   reason cause them to realize we die-hard -PCP-ers- are a loyal bunch,
   and will stick with them only as long as they are reasonable with us.
   We have put up with attrocious service, long periods of not being able
   to do anything, and many other little items, simply because the price
   was unbeatable. Let's not let them forget it!

<*> Alan Reeves Conference
##############################
Ctsy GEnie Atari8 RT

<[RT*SysOp] MARTY.A> Welcome to Alan and Shelly, and thanks for joining
us here on GEnie to discuss your new Diamond OS cart.  I think that there
has been a LOT of excitement about this product.  Would you like to make
an opening statement?

<REEVE.SOFT> First I would like to thank Marty for setting up this
conference.  First, I (Alan) will speak and the appropriate name will
appear in the [].  I would also like to thank all of the many customers
that now own a Diamond cartridge for their support.  As some of you recall
our first conference back in July was geared at discussing the up and
coming Diamond...much has happened and now Diamond is a cartridge based
system...  I believe that the new cartridges addresses many (if not all)
of the comments and suggestions that the dedicated Atari users have made.

We initially released our disk based version of Diamond to show the Atari
world that the creation of such an OS for the 8-bit is possible and the
disk has proven itself to be a powerful system...the new cartridge was
aimed at pleasing those of you that are 'power' users. The cartridge does
all of what the disk did...adds many new features and consumes less memory
due to it's ROM based nature...  the first batch of Diamond cartridges
we're shipped out 2 days ago...the second batch will be sent out on Monday.

For this conference we are here to answer your Questions about Diamond and
the future of Diamond...  ga Marty

<[RT*SysOp] MARTY.A> OK!  Well, on to the questions....  First off, we
have Bob Puff....  ga Bob!

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> Hi Alan! Well, my congratulations go out on
completing such a large project!  A couple Qs here (which are probably
fully explained in the stuff when it comes, but for the benefit of all..)

What memory restrictions does the cart put on programs?  Like, is there
any code that relocates to LOMEM, or is the top 8K always reserved, etc.?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Basically it's in hi memory...this is so we do not
conflict with the numerous little drivers that are out there for printers,
Ram Disks...etc..  The cartridge leaves approximately 19K free for
programs, but that's why we used our new memory driver system...most code
doesn't really need to use 19K it's usually large clumps of data that
occupy the majority of this region...the memory drivers allow larger
system to take full advantage of their capabilities.

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> I see. ok does it mess around with the operating
system?  Will it work with modified operating systems?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> It's a good thing I tried that last weekend!  When I
tried it out on the 400/800 series...works with both the 400/800s and the
modified OS...believe it was the three-in-one OS from CSS.

<ALFRED> I have the disk version and since it comes with essentially zero
documentation, can anything be written for diamond without the programmer
kit?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Theoretically one could write applications for the
disk... but as you know we have decided to include the programmer's kit
with the cartridge...the reason being that the disk and the cartridge are
not compatible from a programming standpoint at the present and we do not
wish to have to have two versions of each application be made...one for
disk and one for cartridge. 

Incidentally I hope that you have sent your warranty card in to us so that
we can send you the needed upgrade information.

<ALFRED> Ok. Can diamond support multiple applications, like gem? Not yet
on that warranty card.

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> If you mean multitasking no...the closest to
multitasking for Diamond is the desk accessories...in reality a desk
accessory could be used as a full blown application...it would consume a
lot of memory though and would require a memory upgrade.

Diamond has been written with the future in mind...it is a very open
ended system so many things are possible that may not be yet implemented.
I don't think a switcher would be very appropriate for Diamond though due
to the excessive Ram constraints that it puts on an ST.

<[Dominick] TUBBY.TOAD> How will you be working with the new 16bit board
for the now 8bits? And do you think you could incorporate MTOS with
Diamond to get a Kickstart/Workbench thingie going?  Since the new board
can address so much memory.

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> I think the 16 bit board offers a lot of potential
for the future of the Atari 8-bit and we've indicated our desire to work
with it and have sent Chuck a cartridge.

As for MTOS I'm not really familiar with it for doing such things as
mutiple applications a user must have a lot of memory and a relatively
fast system...it may be done in the future but at present the cartridge
was not designed for that.

<[John Nagy] ZMAGAZINE> ok, Hi alan, I was pleased to see the well
organized docs in the programmers kit and it gave me lots of ideas of
things to do with it, but I see no help for the basic programmer...now
BASIC is mentioned on the cover but I am lost once inside will there be
more?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> As you know with the initial batch of carts there are
Mac/65 libraries.  I have designed the needed Basic routine to call
Diamond and will U/L after the conference along with a few other things.
We are also working on getting the needed Action! library together.

<[John Nagy] ZMAGAZINE> Thanks!  I know that users will see that there is
a lot more to DIAMOND than a desk.

<P.CLUB> I was just wondering how well diamond supports the memory
upgrades for the various machines.  Such as the Scott Peterson and the
130 upgrades to beyond one meg?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Diamond's memory support routines are among its more
powerful capabilities...all upgrades that I am aware of can be supported
and as I have indicated in the BB topic I'm looking for people that have
the various memory upgrades to test them out on.

Most upgrades perform banking via $CFFF or $D301 (tech jargon) but Diamond
does not fix this...the cartridge includes a default driver, but another
driver can be loaded in...this is also the case for the mouse drivers.
nothing is hard wired.

<P.CLUB> thank you.  Also which DOS's will Diamond support?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Diamond supports DOS 2.X, DOS XE, SpartaDOS and most
others such as 2.0, 2.5, and SpartaDOS XE.

<[LARRY=>)] THE.LION> Alan, how is it going.  How well will Diamond work
with a 512K 800.  It is a RamCharger Board?  And I assume you meant
Sparta X ?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Is what a RamCharger board?

<[LARRY=>)] THE.LION> Sorry it is a RamCharger Board.

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> To support the RamCharger I believe the switch
location is $CFFF...at present the included utilities disk have memory
drivers for the 48K, XL and XE machines...but for other memory upgrade the
routines only have to be modified slightly.

<[Dominick] TUBBY.TOAD> ok, I've got two here, so lets go...  1st, about
windows: will the full gadget now shrink them back to the smaller size,
and can you have more than one open now?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yes to both...clicking the fuller twice does a full
reverse and the system supports four windows, and two on the desktop.

<[Dominick] TUBBY.TOAD> 2nd, are the icons still oversized, and have you
kept the ST GEN idea of the 3 icons or gone with, the Workbench/GOE idea
of multiple icons stored as files?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> The desktop icons have been reduced and redesigned
and we have kept the three icons (as on the ST) for icon displays in a
window.

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> ok another tech question Alan... When accessing
the extra memory via your memory drivers, is there a -window-, and if so,
where and how big is it?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> it's not so much a window Bob...we sent up new MemLo
and MemHi pointers for the extra memory and when things are moved to it.
One just sends a four byte address to the appropriate memory driver
routine...  That should be set up.

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> so if you want to store data in the extra memory
of say a 320K XE at location $100000, how would you go about that?  (if
it is too complex, don't bother here)

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> just tell diamond the soure and dest ($100000) address
and and it's done! for more detailed things I'd recommend waiting until
(probably) tomorrow when you get it via UPS.

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> sounds good. so its like a memory move then?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yes it's exactly that... a memory move...

<P.CLUB> I have a couple: first how about hard drive support?  Is it
dependent on what DOS you happen to be using?  Second how about support
for the ICD MIO board and the Supra hard drive?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yes...Diamond supports the DOS types...and the DOS
types support the various drive types...  I know John Nagy has tested it
out and it works on the MIO and it should work with the Supra.  OK...we
don't tamper with DOS so if Sparta supports 'em them we do.

<P.CLUB> Third I noticed you were speaking of using routines from a disk
utility to What memory locations are being used for drivers Page6?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> I don't understand the question...are you asking if we
use page 6? 

<P.CLUB> I was wondering if you are vectoring your routines to page 6
locations for the various drivers.

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Page 6 is not used by Diamond...nothing below $8E00
is...

<P.CLUB> Thanks much for that we use that page a LOT.  Lastly I have heard
a rumor that Atari is evaluating Diamond for possible inclusion with its
8-bit line is this true?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yes

<P.CLUB> What kind of reception are you getting or can you say yet?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Warm and coordial.

<DATAQUE.1> Hi, all, and Alan..... I have a few Q's concerning file
management...  1) does Diamond extend the size and addr range of binary
files? 

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> No

<DATAQUE.1> 2) does it take care of paging when a program is loaded on a
boundry (16k)?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> I don't understand the question exactly?

<DATAQUE.1> 3) does Diamond use published OS vectors only ?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yes...it makes legitimate calls only.

<DATAQUE.1> 2)Clarification:  if a file is being loaded by Diamond which
is using your mem manager, will it take care of any size file up to 64k?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> the memory manager is not involved when files are
loaded..the memory manager is a tool to be used by the software. We retain
compatibility with existing files that way.

<[John Nagy] ZMAGAZINE> I wanted to affirm MIO support and a hppy HD.
Also, tell about the COM line Parameter passing...  It is a important
feature.

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> The cart you have sets aside the needed space to have
its own parameter line (e.g. TTP files on the ST), and also retains
compatibility with Spartas command line.

<[John Nagy] ZMAGAZINE> thats all here.  I am pleased with the handling,
particularly with the mouse movement.

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> Anyways, here's my last Q...  You said nothing
below $8E00, right?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yep...

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> where's screen memory (8k worth, right?)?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> The screen is at $8000 down to around $6000.

<[Hi! I'm ->] BOB.PUFF> what's from $8000 to $8E00 then?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Open program space.

<MR.GOODPROBE> Hiya, Alan! How are you doing on the extended memory
handlers?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> We've got the 48K, XL, and XE ones... the basic
skeleton is the same for all of them though.

<MR.GOODPROBE> how about, like, 256k xls and stuff like that?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> That's down the road... I don't have one so I'm
recruiting testers.

<MR.GOODPROBE> (ahem) I have several, here and at ATARI, so -fire away-.

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> How about a loaner.

<MR.GOODPROBE> I can give you a NEWELLed XL for a loaner, what say?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Sure...

<[RT*SysOp] MARTY.A> Thanks, Jack! The last question is another from Jeff.

<ALFRED> one quick q. Are there hard and fast rules about accessories
installing themselves. For example could a large accesory hide part of it
self under the cart and disable it at times?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Like what kinds of rules?  Diamond handles where the
ACCs are stored.... and accessories can do everything that an application
does.

<ALFRED> Are the ACCs always memory resident?

<[Alan] REEVE.SOFT> Yes.

<[RT*SysOp] MARTY.A> Well, that about wraps it up here for tonight. Did
you have any thing that you would like to say in closing, Alan?  <or
Shelly!>

<[Shelly] REEVE.SOFT> Does anyone have any marketing questions?

<[RT*SysOp] MARTY.A> I think that the biggest thing would be just how to
get Diamond?  And the various support files.

<[Shelly] REEVE.SOFT> Diamond is available at your local Atari retailer.
In some locations there is no dealer, so call us.
