Jason:

First off, of course, I've got to say I love TEXTFILES. Lots of nights
sitting in front of the computer screen reading that stuff. :) I'm a
90s kid, and I do wish I coulda been around back then. Even without
all the cool stuff online today.

Secondly, I was unusually attached to the five issues of "Phirst
Amendment" you have archived on TEXTFILES
(http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/1A/), due mainly to the odd
devotion of the authors to their magazine in investing time, money,
etc. I finally uncovered on Google tonight the reason for issues
numbered 1, 4, 9, 10, and 19.

According to the "Computer Underground E-Pubs" page at
http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/www.eff.org/pub/Misc/Publications/CuD/Phirst_Amendme
nt/, the five issues were numbered using a hex system. So 1 is 1, 4 is 2, 9
is 3, 10 is 4, and 19 is 5. (That doesn't make sense to me, seeing as
base-16 goes 0-F, but perhaps it offers some kind of explanation to
someone.)

The dates line up for the talk in the issues of it being a monthly
publication, including the notes of delays up to the last two issues.
(Shame they apparently didn't make any more; they were talking about
relocating to some offshore country, but God knows what came of that.)

Anyway, maybe some new material for the index page of 1A.

Jon A.
