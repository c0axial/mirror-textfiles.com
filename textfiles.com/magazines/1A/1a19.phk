     Well, another fine issue of 1A is in your hot little hands!  I hope you
enjoy  this one as much  as I enjoyed finding  these interesting tidbits for
you!

     This  has  really  been  a rough  year  for  us.   First,  part  of our
distribution  network went down for longer than we expected.  Then, since we
moved  to such  diverse and  distant places  we missed  a month  and part of
another, and had to release this issue belatedly.

     Some  of you are probably very confused  as to where you can get copies
of   the  magazine  now.    We  also   lost  our  Internet  address  due  to
complications.   I will  be restoring that as  soon as I can.   Right now, I
will  be sending copies to Denver,  Nebraska, and hopefully somewhere in Los
Angeles.  My board may also be moving to a larger area.  More on this later.

     By  the way,   I  highly recommend  picking up  a copy  of Billy Idol's
Cyberpunk  album.  Get it on CD if possible.  It (at least to me) brings out
all  the meanings of true cyberpunk attitude  and outlook.  It's great to go
trashing  to, hack  to, or whatever  you do with  your time now.   Some high
points  of  the  disk  are  the  songs  Heroin,  Shock  to  the  System, and
Neuromancer.  In my opinion this is the best CD to be released this year and
it's  well worth picking  up.  Plus,  as a bonus,  it lists Billy's Internet
address  at the Well.  So, write him a note telling him how much you enjoyed
the  album (or whatever) and enclose a copy  of this review.  I'm sure he'll
be glad to get a copy!

     Also,  I'm  working  on  getting  a firm  to  carry  copies  of  1A for
distribution  (so  you can  pick  up your  missing  back issues  &  write us
letters),  and I think I found one. As soon  as I can add the 1A name to the
box  you should be  able to do that  (next issue - I  promise!) and I'll get
that  to you as soon as I'm sure you can get through.   Still looking for an
Internet source for the magazine, but I'm sure that will come soon enough.

     My latest Bitch is about computer parts!  As some of  you know, a plant
that  builds  SIMM memory  chips  in Japan  was  destroyed in  an earthquake
(thanks  to our Japanese  Otaku for that  info!), and that  isn't good.  Why
isn't  that good?  Well, because the stores all feel that they can raise the
priced  of SIMM's for  no reason.  They  didn't have to  pay anymore for the
ones  currently in  stock and  if my sources  are correct,  all damages were
compensated  by insurance.   So  why are we  paying more  for something that
isn't  costing more?  Because  of American greed and  corruption.  They feel
that  the 'sheep' are so blind that  we will blindly follow any path without
question.   I'm here to ask the questions  though - and you should also!  If
you  feel you're  getting ripped  off -  ask why!   These  people owe  us an
explanation  as to why they are doing what they are doing.  I think a lesson
in  customer service would  do these people  some good.   They don't own the
computer  industry - the consumers  do!  The consumer  always has and always
will  be the reason that there is an industry of any type at all.  Without a
market, a business cannot survive.  Remember that you are not there to serve
them  - THEY ARE THERE TO SERVE YOU!  So, that uppity sales clerk needs some
lessons in manners and it's your job to insure they get it.













     Well,  one more thing about this particular 'zine - I have noticed that
some  of you think  we are centered on  certain topics; as  time goes by I'm
sure  it will become obvious we are  putting out as diversified a product as
possible.   Please don't  think that we are  exclusively focusing on certain
areas.   Also, to answer  a question that is  recently coming up....yes, our
numbering  system is a private joke that  I really hope someone figured out.
Give it a shot and let us know what you come up with.

     Another  thing which occurred recently was  the recovery of most of the
files  from my old BBS.   So, expect to see a  lot of reprints of older (but
good  - read as 'classics') text files from waaaay back here for a while.  I
think that the information contained in these is worthwhile and valid still,
so  read them again or read them for the  first time - but by all means read
them.

     Well,  until next time - stay free, keep the faith, and keep passing us
around!
                              - Anesthesia

-------------------------------------DC------------------------------------

     Well,  hasn't this  been just the  most special fiscal  quarter?  We've
been  relocating, revamping, studying for  finals, writing software, writing
newsletters, flying cross-country, picking trash...  You name it, we've been
busy doing it.

     Apologies are in order for the unwarranted delay in the release of this
issue.  We are still alive and kicking... just harried and hassled.

     I  think we can  start releasing these  in an orderly  fashion now that
Pink  Freud, Sir Galahad,  Anesthesia, Storm, and I  have settled into their
respective new environments.  No two members of KAoS are in any one state at
any given time.  That will enable us to keep ourselves 1. in touch with many
people  in many areas, and 2. from being seen with one another and obviously
linked should something heavy come down the lines.

     Anesthesia,  Pink Freud,  and I  will be  starting boards  soon, all of
which  will be pick-up  points for the most  recent issue of  1A, as well as
drop-off points for articles, stories, submissions, etc.

     Here's  to the future,  and may the  issues flow forth  like water from
well, something from which a lot of water comes forth easily...

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Chemical of the Month /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
                                  by Daiv

     There will be no chemical of the month, this month, as Anesthesia has
neglected to provide one.   However, as you have come to expect, we will
provide you with a handy home recipe.














                              Baking Soda Bomb

     Well,  kids... [if you are under 18 years of age, be sure not to engage
in any experiment mentioned in these sections without parental supervision.]
Here's one from Lightman,  we've spent some time perfecting the measurements
and  combinations.    This  can  be  used  as  either  a  grenade  or remote
destruction device.

     The  larger the bottle,  the greater the  explosion.  There  is no fire
involved,  so things will  not burn.   Iodine crystals could  solve that, if
necessary.   Enough shrapnel  will be generated  to literally shred anything
within 3 feet of its epicenter.  Shrapnel in the example, has been thrown as
far as 40+ feet by the following volume of reactants.

Needed for this example/experiment:

                            16 oz Pop bottle of your choice
                                 (sans label AND adhesive)
                            1-1/3 cup Vinegar
                                (The greater the acidity the better)
                            2-2/3 Tbsp Baking Soda
                            12 squares of Toilet Paper
                            Cellophane Tape

    CAUTION:  Read the directions before doing ANYTHING this experiment.

             Exception:  Buying and consuming 16 oz beverages.

     The  reaction utilized  involves a variant  of the old  baking soda and
vinegar  volcano, science fair  entry I made in  second grade, after reading
about it in some kids' detective book.

     This is what happens: the baking soda and vinegar react in the presence
of  air - I am not sure which specific gas.  However, prevented from getting
air, the ingredients have no means to react.  I noticed this when attempting
to  make a pipe bomb variant with  these ingredients.  Without air, critical
mass  was never  attained.   The reacting  components just  sat next  to one
another, waiting for air to react with.  Knowing that, this bomb was easy to
create.

     Regardless  of the size of the glass  object used to house this device,
maintain  an 8:1 ratio of  vinegar to baking soda.   This proportion ensures
maximum  reaction from each component.  Also, allow a little room  for a bit
of  reaction to occur.  With this extra space, you can visually determine if
the  seal is  leaking.  If  there is  a leak, detonation  should be provoked
ASAP, as every second drains explosive power from the device.

     Detonation  is  easily  provoked,  as a  glass  bottle  is  the housing
container.   If  thrown, dropped,  run over with  a car,  shot by  a BB gun,
lobbed  into a McDonalds,  bounced off of  someone's head, hit  with a rock,
etc.   THIS THING  WILL GO BOOM!   The explosion is a  little louder than an
M-16 shell.  The blast radius of this experiment is easily 30 to 40 feet.













     Take  one deluxe,  no-name 16 ounce  soda bottle  from 7-11, Quik-Trip,
Circle  K,  recycling  center, or  wherever.    SAVE THE  CAP!    Drink this
beverage,  save it for later,  whatever you want to do  - just get the stuff
out.   Rinse it with water, as the sugar neutralizes the reaction a bit.  Do
your  best to  remove as  much water as  possible -  centrifugal force works
well.  In this bottle put 1-1/3 cup vinegar.  Cap it, so it doesn't oxidize.
If you can smell vinegar, it's oxidizing.

     This  part can  be adulterated in  means, but  not the ends.   For this
experiment,  we used 2.6666 tablespoons of baking soda.  As a buffer, to buy
time, I wrap no more than 1 Tbsp Baking soda in the center of a toilet paper
cylinder.  This looks a lot like a Big Bob Mighty, but don't smoke it.  Tape
the ends to maintain accuracy of measurement.  Doing it this way, you should
have three cylinders of toilet paper, capped with tape.  These should BARELY
fit into the mouth of the pop bottle.  That's the idea.

     When  nearing the time of utilization,  uncap the bottle and cram those
tubes of baking soda into the bottle as quickly as possible.  If you are too
slow,  you will have a  massive, fizzy mess all  over yourself.  Don't worry
about  the tape.  The acid of  the vinegar dissolves the adhesive with great
ease.   When ready to detonate the device,  shake it...  It should fizz  and
the  toilet paper  should begin   coagulating in  the bottom  of the bottle.
When the toilet paper has coagulated in the bottom, it is ready.

     Place  it, throw it,  drop it, lob it,  whatever your intended purpose.
If it is to be set off by a distant projectile, such as a rock or BB/pellet,
it should be done within about 10 minutes of placing it.  Any longer and the
effect  decreases exponentially, as tiny leaks  are allowing the reaction to
occur slowly, instead of as rapidly as necessary for the Big Bang effect.

Variations:

     Snip  little chunks of tin off of a big piece.  Coat the outside of the
bottle  in adhesive (your choice  - anything but ELMER'S,  as it will form a
buffer  layer that the  release of the  shrapnel!).  Roll  the bottle in the
snipped  pieces  of tin:  the  blast radius  is  more than  halved,  but the
shredding radius is just less than doubled.

     If  tin is not  available to you,  BB's work well.  They don't shred as
well  as the  tin chunks,  weigh more  than tin  chunks, but  are still more
vorpal than just the glass bottle.

     If  one were to boil a box of cigars for about 5 to 10 hours-a nicotine
concentrate  will form.   Ask  any smoker,  nicotine is  a poison.   Dipping
projectiles in concentrated nicotine adds a toxic flair to the incident.  BE
VERY  CAREFUL handling anything with  nicotine on it.   Do NOT even touch it
with  your bare hands.   It will  absorb through skin,  much more readily so
with a sharp projectile...

<Yo sound the bell, school's in!> Can't touch this.

Gimme a keyboard, disk drive- makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' em.
Now they know
They try to shut me up- they just don't know, that bites - NOT right.
My words are electric, catch a few bytes.
What's it gonna take for the 90s to burn?
You better work hard or might as well quit.

That's word because you know....  Can't touch this... Can't touch this!

     Well,  for now, it seems  that I am trapped  without means to begin the
conception  of our church.  The response  has been good.  Several have given
donations  to speed along its  inception.  I DO  intend to make this happen.
Hopefully  Anesthesia will be able to get more of the necessary paperwork to
make  this happen.   The physical boundaries, i.e.  the Atlantic Ocean, make
things  a bit harder to prepare than  normal.  I haven't found an affordable
local dialup, so we have to resort to Snail-mail.

     I have devised a means of supporting and providing for all requirements
to  qualify as a  full-fledged tax-exempt, not-for-profit  organization.  We
need more people to pledge that they follow the Code of Free-Thinkers.  This
will pretty much take care of the final requirement for non-profit status.

     The  only remaining item will then  be the actual filing for non-profit
organization  status.  This will require a lawyer, filing fees, etc.  So, we
are anticipating a huge expenditure in this department.

     Any  and all help is welcome.   Please direct all requests for the Code
of Free-Thinking, information, donations, etc. to

                         Church of Free Thought

     Please  make checks and money orders payable to cash, as we don't trust
the  American banking  system.   See, the  IRS can  'lawfully' seize  a bank
account,  and prevent money from  going out of an  account.  And when checks
are  made out to a  business, the IRS requires  that the checks be deposited
into  a business account at a bank,  for auditing purposes.  Banks know this












and  charge businesses for  having an account, for  each deposited item, for
each  deposit, for each  check drawn on  the account, and  give low interest
rates  in  return.   This  needlessly  increases overhead;  Once  again, the
government  has made a law  which violates an individual's  rights so that a
large, organized industry may profit.  (cf. Mandatory liability insurance)

     I  found  an interesting  article that  really  piqued my  curiosity on
viruses.   It  mentioned a few  things, some  of which I  found factual, and
others that were speculation by the general public.

     So!   For this issue, I will comment  on the myths around us.  I pulled
quite  a  few  of  these  comments  directly  from  my  BBS's  public  virus
information  discussion message base.   Others were  things that people have
said or asked me about in E-mail.

1.  There are a lot of people trying to scare you into buying expensive
    anti-virus software!

     This  is  quite true,    Early detections  of  viruses are  now heavily
publicized.   The media (always  a useful tool) are  fed information about a
virus  in a way that makes  it seem as if every system  has it.  Look at all
the  press Michelangelo got and it sparked record anti-virus software sales.
I know of very few users that were infected with it in the first place.


2.  Most simple viruses are detectable by freeware or shareware virus
    scanners.  The more complex ones need a commercial product.

     This is obviously a falsehood from advertising moguls.  I took the time
to  search through  the best  commercial products  and quite  a few freeware
products.  The freeware products were much more comprehensive and were FREE.
That  means that most any upgrades won't cost you anything either.  With the
number of viruses out currently and the new ones released every day, I don't
want to have to pay to upgrade later.


3.  You should subscriber to `Virus News', `Virus Bulletin' or some of
    those!  They are invaluable!

     Well,  at  $120-$395 per  year for  a  subscription, of  course they're
invaluable.   They're very thin,  don't cover much that  I need to know, and
are just too damn expensive for my taste.  I suggest getting on Internet and
subscribing to Virus-L via a mailserver at any of them available.  It's free
and  you get posts a lot more quickly  than once per month, and they're from
real people!


4.  There aren't many viruses out right now, so why is everyone so worried?













     Well,  to test this, a long time ago, I took some time to find just how
many  I could write in one  day.  By myself, I  wrote twelve.  But with help
(Virus  Construction Lab,   Trojan Horse Construction  Kit, etc.) the number
would  be too high to count.   I do not release  viruses.  I am a programmer
and know how viruses work.  It's not hard to figure out and you really don't
need to be a programmer to do it.


5.  I won't get a virus because I don't download files from BBSs.

     I  can't stand to hear this phrase.   I have collected several thousand
files  on my board for my users, and this makes my work feel useless.  There
are  thousands of ways to get infected with a virus.  These can be as simple
as disk swapping, outside users, and unauthorized access.


6.  Commercial BBSs check for viruses more than small BBSs.

     Another  of my least favorite phrases!  I spend a lot of time searching
for  infected files  as do  many SysOps of  boards I  call.   There are many
programs available to help SysOps in this task.  These are usually automatic
and  if  they didn't  catch it,  it was  either too  new or  their detection
software is too old.


7.  I make regular backups, so I'm safe.

     Well,  I questioned  an avid backer-upper  more in-depth  and found out
that  he uses a tape backup.  This is an excellent set-up!  The only problem
is  that he only owns a couple of  tapes and re-uses them.  So, let's figure
that  you own three tapes and backup every week.  You get a virus, then back
your  system up.   The virus just continues  to copy and goes  off in say, a
month.   All  of your backups  are corrupted.   So when  you restore, you're
restoring  the problem.   Always  scan for  viruses before  you back-up your

     Once  again, brothers and  sisters, I am  to show you  the ways of `The
Man.'   I intend  to continually bombard  you with the  means that have been
created to `help' us, but have been used to `screw' us.  I will show you HOW
they  have been used to screw us and how, with a little persistence, you can
use them to either unscrew yourself or screw others.

     It  has been demonstrated that huge, incorporated conglomerates are the
actual  `controlling force' in our society.   Let's face it, our politicians
are  being bought.  If we fight  these organizations in the little ways that
we  can, they will be gradually relieved  of their power and/or control over
our lives.  I once heard from a very wise person, "The best way to defeat an
organization is from the inside."  This can be interpreted in a few ways.

     This  is my interpretation: The information provided to the insiders of
an organization, worthy of being shut down, is enough, in itself to do so.

     Another,  more covert interpretation could  be:  Enter the organization
and  establish yourself in a position of  power.  With that power, shut down
the organization.

     I  am more in favor of the first.  If the organization is a worthy one,
why  ruin it?   If it isn't worthy,  the former means is  quite a bit easier
than  the latter.  These organizations really  DO provide the means of their
own destruction.

     Most  unworthy organizations will rather readily  allow one to become a
part  with a very modest security  check.  Sadly enough, those organizations
that  have  the  MOST  power are  hardest  to  enter.   Under  the  guise of
volunteerism,  much data can  be attained.   It is more  difficult to secure
gainful  employment with  an organization -  they have to  need your skills,
like your appearance, etc...

     That's it for this month's- `How to Infiltrate the System'



















                             Creative Checking


     Let's,  first, explore  the specifics  of the  checking system.   Let's
first look at what makes a check a legal form of tender.

     Federal law requires a check have the following:  The recipient's name,
account-holder's  signature, amount of tender, name of the bank in which the
account  is held,  and the account  number.   Aside from this,  there are no
other  specifics.   No  rules regarding  material  of the  check, commercial
imprinting,  etc  -  these are  all  things  that the  banking  industry has
instituted on its own.  With this in mind, a check can be on a tree stump, a
rock,  the side  of a cow,  etc.   These are all  backed by  precedent.  For
these,  and some pretty interesting examples of  checks from the past, go to
the Smithsonian exhibit on money.  It's pretty interesting.

     A  check, without  one of the  requirements, can be  interesting.  Most
blanks  are easily  solved by  the payee,  such as  leaving off  the date or
payee's  name.  Some can be hazardous, particularly the AMOUNT of the check.
This brings two interesting things to mind.

     First, Federal law considers any check that is more than six months old
as  `stale'.  This means that it  cannot be redeemed.  This can accidentally
happen  around the  beginning of  the year,  as people  frequently forget to
change  the year on their mental calendars.  Incidentally, most banks refuse
to clear checks that are older than ninety days.

     Second, if YOUR check does not have YOUR signature on it, it should NOT
be  cashable.   Mind you, SHOULD  not:  I've  seen cases in  which the check
actually  clears.   Neither the machines  involved nor the  tellers pay much
attention to checks for amounts less than $500.
 
      State  you have never signed the check.  This can be done at any time.
It  doesn't  matter  if your  check  cleared 10  months  ago.   If  you JUST
discovered  the check shouldn't have cleared, then you don't have an earlier
time  you could  have reported it.   They may  ask questions.   Just say you
reconcile your statements annually.  Depending on the situation, it may be a
good  idea to let the payee think they  got one over on you by redeeming the
unsigned check.  So, wait a couple of months before revoking that check.  No
matter what, that check should NOT have cleared.

     Some  companies will redeem checks by  putting a stamp in the signature
block stating something along the line of `Signature on File.'  Even THIS is
not  legally cashable.  Many people allow these checks to clear without even
raising a stink.  If you didn't sign it, don't let it clear!

     Other companies will just put the check in the bank, not even examining
it  for a signature.  If  they do, the time involved  from the time they get
the  check to the time you find out that  it didn't have a signature on it -
is  their responsibility.   Their ineptitude prevented  you from having your
balance  cleared sooner, caused the accrual of more interest, etc.  They HAD
your check.  It's not your fault.  You INTENDED to pay them.  So blame them!














     If  someone actually SIGNS your name or another name, regardless of how
close  it is to your signature, that is FORGERY!  Blammo!  Instant credit to
your account, plus whatever else you can come up with.



[The  following scandal encompasses so much at one time, it's very difficult
to  describe.  It's got  your basic murder/conspiracy/big brother/drug plot.
It adds a VERY interesting point of view!  Well worth the time to read.]

                             The UFO Conspiracy
                           Milton William Cooper
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


The  following are excerpts  from a 45-minute lecture  given on November 17,
1989,  at the "Whole Life Expo" in Los Angeles, California by Milton William
Cooper.  His speech has been transcribed from a microcassette recording.

<Begin Lecture>
     For  those of you who don't  know who I am, I  was raised in a military
family.  My family, my ancestors, since they came to this country, have been
government  people.  We have served in  the military. We have been patriots,
We  have fought in all  the wars, We care about  this country and believe in
the  Constitution of the United States.  We know, as many people don't know,
that  the Constitution of the United States  of America IS the United States
of  America!  And that's why we've always been ready to do the things needed
to preserve and protect it. [from enemies both foreign AND domestic!]

     When  I left home I went into the Air Force, the Strategic Air Command.
As  a child I'd  heard stories from  my father and  pilots, other pilots, my
father  was a pilot, about  Foo Fighters, UFOs, strange  craft that were not
made  on this Earth.  And as a kid, you hear that in passing, and it's neat,
and you giggle about it, and you go out and play 'Space Man,' and you forget
it.

     When  I was in  the Air Force I  met men who  had participated in alien
crashed-craft  recoveries.  Now this intrigued  me, it interested me, but it
was  usually after quite a few bottles of beer that these stories would come
out,  and sometimes the next  morning I couldn't remember  what the heck the
guy said.

     When  I left  the Air  Force I went  into the  Navy, and  this is where
everything  began to happen  for me.   I had originally  intended to just go
from service to service and do something that very few people have ever done
before.   I was a very adventurous, very  crazy...  young man, and I thought
that  that would be a  pretty exciting life.   I volunteered for submarines,
and  while on  the submarine  USS Tyroot, SS-416,  on a  transit between the
Portland/Seattle  area and Pearl Harbor, which  was our home port; the Pearl
Harbor  sub base, as the port lookout I saw a craft, saucer-shaped, the size
of a Midway class carrier, aircraft carrier, for those of you who don't know
how big that is; it's huge, come up out of the water approximately two and a
half  nautical miles off the port bow, which is about 45 degrees to the left
of  the pointy end of the submarine.  It tumbled slowly on its own axis, and












went  up  into the  clouds.   It appeared  to be  moving slowly  to me  at a
distance  of two  and a half  nautical miles,  but in reality  it was moving
pretty  fast because it came up out of  the water, did a few tumbles, and it
was gone!

     I  then reported it to the officer of the deck.  I didn't tell him what
it  was that I saw because my Daddy didn't raise no fools and in case nobody
else  saw it I didn't  want to be the  only looney on board  the ship.  So I
asked  the officer of the deck to help me cover that area, and he did, which
is common for officers and lookouts to help each other while on bridge watch
because  they  all hang  together if  something  bad happens.   After  a few
seconds  of watching, the same craft, or another craft exactly like it, came
down  out of the  clouds, tumbled again on  its own axis,  and went into the
water.  Ensign Ball, who was the officer of the deck, was literally shocked!
What  could I say?   Seaman Dejeralimo,  who was the  starboard lookout, had
also  witnessed this, and Ensign  Ball called the captain  to the bridge who
was  followed by the chief  quartermaster who brought a  35MM camera, and we
watched  for between seven and 10 minutes the same craft, or different craft
that  looked exactly alike, enter and leave the water.  It was an incredible
show.   I don't know if they knew we  were there, or if they even cared, but
the craft did not glow, they were metal, they were machines without a doubt,
they were obviously intelligently guided, they were huge, and having been in
the  Air Force  and the  Navy and knowing  what it  takes, I  knew without a
doubt, and know it today, that that machine was not made on the face of this
earth.   Because there's nothing that man can make, that can fly through the
air  at a speed like that,  tumble on its own axis,  and enter the water and
effectively fly beneath the sea.

     If  you've  ever  been  aboard  an  airplane  and  then  gone  aboard a
submarine, I know there's probably some of you in this room who have visited
a  submarine at one time  or another, you can  readily see just without even
any  of the technicalities involved  how difficult such a  thing would be to
do.   Where would it be built, that size?  It was absolutely incredible.  It
changed  my life because then  all the stories that I'd  heard all my life I
knew were true, and I began seeing the world in a different light.

     It  wasn't  long  after  that  I  was  trained  by  Naval  security  in
intelligence.   I  was sent  to Vietnam.   I was  assigned as  a patrol boat
captain,  first in DaNang harbor, given a crew, given a multi-million dollar
patrol  boat.  My job  was to gather intelligence  from the people who lived
around  the harbor and the fishermen  who transited the harbor, and maintain
the  safety and security of  the harbor and the  shipping.  After about five
months  I was sent up North to the DMZ, to a place called Qua Vieaf,  on the
Tacan  river.  Our  base camp was  at the river  mouth.  We  were only three
miles  south of the  North Vietnamese border  and our job  was to patrol the
Tacan  river from  the river mouth  to Dang Ha,  and then up  the Quang Tree
cutoff  to Quang  Tree city, again  to get to  know the people  on the bank,
gather  intelligence, and to patrol every  night and maintain the safety and
security of the river and the river traffic.

     It was while there that I discovered that there was a tremendous amount
of  UFO and alien activity  in Vietnam.  It  was always reported in official
messages  as 'enemy helicopters.' Now any of you who know anything about the
Vietnam  war know  that the North  Vietnamese did not  have any helicopters,












especially  after our first couple of air raids into North Vietnam.  Even if
they  had they would not have been so  foolish as to bring them over the DMZ
because  that would  have insured  their demise.   Our troops  were fired on
occasionally  by  these  'enemy  helicopters,' enemy  troops  were  fired on
occasionally  by these  'enemy helicopters,'  and occasionally  people would
disappear.   And on  one instance that I  know for sure  at least one entire
village  disappeared one night  because of alien activity.   The reason they
used  the term  'enemy helicopters' in  messages and dispatches  was that in
Vietnam  you could be overrun at any time,  no matter where you where.  They
did  not bring crypto encoding equipment into Vietnam, I'm talking about the
machinery.

[Small part skipped]

     When I left Vietnam I was eventually attached to the headquarters staff
of  the Commander in Chief of the  United States Pacific Fleet at Macalappa,
[sp]  Hawaii,  which  is a  little  hill  overlooking Pearl  Harbor,  it's a
beautiful  white building up  there, and I was  specifically attached to the
Intelligence  Briefing Team of  the Commander in Chief  of the United States
Pacific Fleet.

     It  was during  this tour  of duty  that, in  the course  of my duties,
documents  were  placed  in  my  hands  that  were  so  unbelievable  and so
incredible  that it took me quite a while  to adjust to the fact that what I
was  seeing was real.  Now for those of you who don't understand how I could
come  to see  this information,  let me  give you  a little  short course in
security  clearance and the need  to know and how  you get to see classified
information  if  you're in  the military  or in  the government,  it doesn't
matter which, the rules are the same.

     I  was assigned to  the Intelligence Briefing Team  of the Commander in
Chief  of  the  United States  Pacific  Fleet,  who had  to  know everything
concerning his area of operations which was one half of the Earth's surface;
the  Indian ocean, the  Pacific ocean, and  all the land  masses in between.
Believe  it or not, if we  go to war, if we ever  go to war, it's the United
States  Navy that strikes the  first blow and attempts  to keep the enemy at
bay  while we  can get  ourselves together,  at least  historically. Nuclear
weapons  have kind of  done away with that  concept, but military commanders
like to talk about it anyway.

     Because  of this, and you have no  conception of the amount of material
and  information that an area commander  has to know; it's unbelievable, and
he  has to keep track of this, he has to  keep on top of it.  He has to know
what's  happening; he has to make the  right decisions.  Because it's almost
humanly impossible for anyone to do that, they have what's called a briefing
team, and it's our job to make sure that he has the correct information, all
the  time, on a 24-hour basis.  And  every morning, between 8 and 9 a.m., we
would give a briefing which covered everything that happened in the previous
24  hours, and everything scheduled to happen  in the next 24 hours, and all
the  pertinent  intelligence reports  that we  had  received since  the last
briefing  that he needed to know and  that his staff members needed to know.
Occasionally  we would  get messages  marked 'Top  Secret, Magic, Restricted
Information,'  and it  would be coded  in such a  way that all  you had were













answers  to questions which you  didn't know what the  questions were so you
really didn't know what the message as all about.

     But eventually I found myself in possession, holding two documents; one
called  'Project Grudge,'  another one called  'Operation Majority.' Project
Grudge  contained the history of alien involvement since around 1936, and it
began  talking about Germany's involvement with a crashed disk that they had
recovered  in 1936  and were attempting  to duplicate the  technology.  They
were  not successful despite what  all these Nazi hunters  want to tell you.
If  they had  been successful, we  would not  have won the  war, because you
cannot  beat those weapons! You  cannot out fly those  craft, you can't even
think  about it with conventional aircraft.  If Germany had been successful,
we would now have a German flag up in front of this podium.

     They  did make some headway.  When we went into Punta Mundy we captured
documents,  we got some scientists, we got some hardware.  The Russians also
got  some documents,  some scientists, and  some hardware.   It wasn't until
1947  that we were able to capture a  craft, a whole craft, not all together
but  it was  everything.  And  that occurred  near the city  of Roswell, New
Mexico.  There were dead aliens recovered from the craft.  In Project Grudge
I  saw photographs of these dead aliens,  of the craft; I saw photographs of
live  aliens;  I  saw  photographs  of  autopsies,  internal  organs;  I saw
photographs of the alien designated 'E.B.', which was held in captivity from
1949  until June 2, 1952, when he died.   I saw the history of what they had
been  able to at that time put  together, from incidents in the 1800s, which
involved aliens and their craft.

     I saw the names of projects.  I saw a project that was to fly recovered
alien  craft that had been recovered intact  and undamaged, and some of them
were  recovered intact and undamaged, and how  that happened I have no idea.
It  was called 'Project Redlight,' and  first was conducted from the Tonopah
test  range in the Nevada test sight and then was moved to a specially built
area,  ordered built by  president Eisenhower, called  'Area-51,' code named
'Dreamland,'  in the Groom dry lake area of the Nevada test sight, by secret
executive  order.  It doesn't exist officially, if you ask anyone, or if you
write  letters  to  the government  they  will  tell you  it  doesn't exist.
However  if you go out  there at several places and  see it, fly outside the
boundaries  and look down and see it,  you know it's there, but according to
the government it doesn't exist.

     The project to fly, test fly these craft, was ongoing until sometime in
1962  when a craft blew up not far from  the test sight, in the air, and the
explosion  was seen over a  three-state area.  The  pilots were killed, they
had no idea what had happened or why the craft blew up, but they put Project
Redlight  on hold until a later date  when the aliens supplied us with three
craft  and personnel to help us learn how  to fly these craft.  That project
is ongoing, and we now have not only alien craft that we are flying, we have
craft  we have built,  using the captured  technology, and some  of the UFOs
that  people report seeing  in the United States,  and maybe even elsewhere,
are flown by United States personnel.

     That  may come as  a shock to you.   We have  technology way beyond the
limits of what we have been told.  A lot of our development technologically,













since  the end of World  War II, has been due  to the exchange of technology
which occurs in the area called 'Area-51' on a regular basis ...  ongoing.

     When James Oberth, Professor Oberth retired, many of you don't know who
he is ...  not too many space people in here.  Professor Oberth was probably
one  of  the greatest  rocket scientists  and  space commentators  that ever
lived.   When he retired, the government gave him a special award, there was
a  press conference, all kinds  of ceremony, and when he  got up to speak he
said,  'Gentlemen,' and  I quote Professor  Oberth, he  said, 'Gentlemen, we
cannot  take credit for all the  technological developments that we have had
in the last decade.  We have had help,' and that's where he stopped.

     One  of the reporters raised his  hand and said, 'Professor Oberth, can
you tell us what other country helped us?'

     He  said, 'It was those little guys from out in space,' and then he got
down  and would not comment any further.   Now this occurred in 1959.  I can
go on and on, but time doesn't allow it.

     I will tell you ladies and gentlemen that there are all kinds of things
going on all the time, we are making rapid progress in exposing this.  Since
I have begun talking, people have been coming out of the woodwork at a rapid
rate,  who know and have pieces of this puzzle, and are helping us to put it
together,  because I  don't have  all the answers.   I  saw an  awful lot of
material,  I have  remembered an  awful lot  of it,  I have  probably, in my
remembering,  made some mistakes, and I guarantee you they're minor ones, if
I have.

     We  have just recently,  for those of  you who didn't  believe that the
Jason  Society of the Jason Scholars, the secret group, existed, we now have
a  letter  from  the Pentagon,  with  51  names of  the  Jason  Scholars, an
admission  from the Pentagon that they  hold the highest security clearances
in  the nation, an admission  from the Pentagon that  they hold the protocol
rank  of Rear Admiral, and are treated  as such on any military installation
or  in any  government office.   There are  six Nobel Prize  winners on that
list, there are the elite of the elite of the scientific world, they are the
only ones who really know the truth about the technology today and about the
real  science of physics,  because the one  that we're being  taught all the
time  ...  If you send your kids  to college to learn physics you're wasting
your  money because they're teaching them  stuff that doesn't work, it's not
true,  it's not  real.   Gravity is  not what we  think it  is.   There is a
Unified  Theory!  We  already know what  it is; it's  what makes these craft
work.  It's absolutely incredible what's going on.

     How  many of you keep  up with Billy Goodman's show  on KVEG out of Las
Vegas?  For those  of you  who don't,  I would  try tuning  in on  any night
between 10 p.m.  and 1 a.m.  It's 840 on your AM dial, and the subject every
night  are those subjects  that no other  media person in  the United States
will  touch with a  10-foot pole, every single  night except Saturday night.
It's  the only show that you can call  in and talk to another caller, you've
got  three minutes to say whatever you want to say as long as you don't cuss
or swear or slander anyone, and every night they're helping to expose this.














     When  John Lear and  I first said what  was going on  out at Groom Lake
everybody  said, 'You're nuts, there's nothing  going on out at Groom Lake!'
The  listeners of the Billy Goodman radio show put together an excursion and
went  up to  Groom Lake and  they all, ever  since, every night,  they go up
there  and watch them test  fly the alien craft ...   every night! The first
night  they had 100 people there.  And  100 people saw four alien craft fly,
doing things that no airplane and no helicopter can do.  Now they don't tell
us  anymore that there's nothing happening at Groom Lake.  What they tell us
now is there's no such thing as aliens, it's all government secret projects.
That's  OK because we'll  prove that wrong  too eventually, it  just takes a
while.   Because where we  were ... it's not where  we're at, and I'm really
happy about that.

     Now,  if you want to see what's happening right now, keep watching your
movies,  keep watching your  television commercials, your  alien programs on
television,  read  Whitley  Strieber's  Majestic, which  is  a  part  of the
contingency plan called 'Majestic' to test the reaction of the population to
the  presence of aliens on the Earth.   And I have just finished my study of
Whitley  Strieber's book Majestic, and I'm going  to tell you right now that
most of the documents in there, that he says are fiction, are real documents
that  came right  out of  Project Grudge.   It  is part  of the government's
campaign to leak information out in ways that they can always deny that it's
real.   There's only one thing wrong  with the information in that book, the
stories  of the characters in  there I know nothing  about. What I'm talking
about  are the supposed government documents that  he has in that book.  I'm
telling you tonight they're real.  Those are some of the same documents that
I  saw  in Project  Grudge back  between 1970  and 1973,  and where  we have
wondered  before,  now we  know  that Whitley  Strieber  is working  for the
government.   And we had a suspicion anyway because in the front of his book
he  states that he  got information and  was helped by  the research team of
Moore, Shanderey, and Friedman.  William Moore has publicly admitted on July
1  that he is an agent of the United States Government, and we know that the
others are too.

     This  is going  to come out,  and the  reason they're doing  it the way
they're  doing it is they know eventually you're going to find out that it's
all true and real.  They're desensitizing you so that you're not shocked, so
that  there's no collapse  of society as  we know it,  so that the religious
structure doesn't fall to pieces, so that the stock market doesn't go crazy,
because  these were their  original fears.   Now, there's nothing  we can do
about the last one because it's already happened, there will be a segment of
the  population that worships  the aliens, even  though they're no different
than  us;  they're just  from somewhere  else,  and they  may look  a little
different.  They are not gods.  But there are already people worshipping the
aliens  and they  predicted this would  happen when they  slapped the secret
stamp all over all this stuff.

     You  know,  there's really  nothing  wrong with  what's  been happening
except  for three things.  [Cooper forgot to mention the third thing, or was
sidetracked, or included it into the second thing.]

     No.   1, when they decided to keep it secret they needed to finance it,
they couldn't tell the public, so they couldn't tell Congress.  They decided
to  finance it with  the sale, importation and  sale, of drugs.   Now in the












documents  that I read,  in Operation Majority,  it specifically stated that
when George Bush was the president and CEO of Sapata Oil, he, in conjunction
with  the CIA,  organized the first  large-scale drug  importation into this
country  from South and Central America by fishing boat, to the offshore oil
platforms  of Sapata Oil, and then from there into the beach, thus bypassing
all  Customs inspections and law-enforcement inspections  of any kind.  They
are  still bringing in drugs, to a  limited extent, in this manner.  Another
manner  is by CIA contract aircraft which,  one of their bases of landing is
Homestead  [sp] Air  Force Base  in Florida.   We  have affidavits  from air
controllers who have vectored the planes in, who have made sure that they're
not  interfered  with in  any way.    We have  affidavits from  personnel at
Homestead  Air Force Base who say the planes  have been met by Jeb Bush, who
is  George Bush's son.  We have affidavits  from people who work in the Gulf
of  Mexico, in the  offshore oil business,  that yes, indeed,  the drugs are
coming in, at least some of them, from the offshore oil platforms.

     From the audience came a clear statement, "Just say no?"

     Pardon?  Right! Just Say No! Well that's  what we're going to do ladies
and gentlemen with your help.  We are going to say no, no more! And you have
to  do it, you have to act.  You either have to act or watch your country go
down the tubes.

     Now,  that's one  of the  things that's wrong.   The  next thing that's
wrong  is, to keep the secret, they killed a lot of people who tried to leak
it  out.  And  if I hadn't  done it the way  that I did  it, you wouldn't be
seeing  me anywhere  standing or  walking on  this Earth  now.   They killed
President Kennedy and during the workshop, for those of you haven't seen the
tape,  I will show you, on the tape, who shot the president and why. Between
'70 and '73, in Operation Majority it stated verbatim that President Kennedy
ordered  MJ-12 to cease  the importation and  sale of drugs  to the American
people,  that he ordered them to implement  a plan to reveal the presence of
aliens  to the American people within  the following year. His assassination
was  ordered by the policy committee of the Vilderbergers. MJ-12 implemented
the  plan and  carried it  out in Dallas.   It  involved agents  of the CIA,
Division-5  of  the  FBI,  the  Secret  Service,  and  the  Office  of Naval
Intelligence.   President Kennedy was  killed by the driver  of his car, his
name  was William Greer,  he used a  recoilless, electrically operated, gas-
powered  assassination  pistol  that  was  specially  built  by  the  CIA to
assassinate  people  at close  range.   It fired  an explosive  pellet which
injected a large amount of shellfish poison into the brain, and that is why,
in  the documents, it stated that President Kennedy's brain was removed.  If
you've  studied the case,  you will find that  indeed his brain disappeared.
The  reason for  that is so  that they would  not find the  particles of the
exploding  pellet  or the  shellfish poison  in his  brain which  would have
proved  conclusively that Lee Harvey Oswald was  not the assassin.  In fact,
Lee Harvey Oswald never fired a shot, he was the patsy.

<Pause>

     A lady in the audience asked, "Why haven't you been assassinated?"

     If they were to kill me right now, what would you think?













    "That it's the truth"

     I've  got them right where I want them.  If they touch me, everyone who
has  ever heard me  talk is going to  be absolutely enraged  and is going to
know  that everything  I've said is  true.  As  long as they  don't touch me
there's  going to be some of you who  are always going to be wondering.  But
eventually  we're going to bring enough proof out, and if you're here during
the workshop you're going to see an awful lot of it that's going to prove to
you that it's true.  It's real.  And it's happening!


    <He then opened up the floor to questions and answers.>

      A muffled question was barely heard coming from the front of the room,
which  in essence asked, "What about all  the people in the press and others
who  were in Dallas and who saw the assassination?  Couldn't they tell where
the  shot came  from?  Why  didn't they  come forward? There  must have been
plenty."

      There  was, we know that  there was at least  18 who were all murdered
within  two years of the event.  The odds of that happening are 1 in 300,000
trillion.

    "Why did the driver have to shoot Kennedy?"

     Because  the other  fools missed!   There were  a total  of three shots
fired  at President Kennedy, one  hit him in the  throat and didn't kill him
and  two of them hit John Connelly.   The one that was fired from the grassy
knoll  hit  the president  in the  throat.   The other  two shots  came from
directly  behind the limousine, not the school book depository building, and
hit  Governor  Connelly.    Governor  Connelly,  in  intelligence  community
circles, is known as a 'can do' man, because he took two hits and still kept
his mouth shut.

    "How  is it that the driver, sitting on the front, left-hand side of the
car  was able to blow off the right  side of Kennedy's brain when the bullet
actually  entered  in,  and it  would  have been  virtually  impossible ..."
another person asked.

     For  those of you who have been listening to all these talk show hosts,
whose job it is to be a talk show host, and who have not done any legitimate
research  into this, if  you come to the  workshop, I will  show you, on the
tape,  how it was done.  You will see that Kennedy was, in fact slumped over
against Jackie, his head was turned [this direction], it was very simple, it
was easy and you will see it with your own eyes.

     [Another  muffled,  off-mike question  from  a member  of  the audience
inquiring  why no one else had come forward with the information Mr.  Cooper
was  disseminating, and why those who knew it had kept it secret for so long
was quickly answered.]

     It  hasn't been, I'm  talking about it  now.  Bill  English was talking
about  it eight  years ago,  but everybody  laughed at  Bill English.   John
Lear's  been talking about it for three years, and everybody laughed at him.












Now  there's so many people have been  talking about it, people are starting
to  listen, and it's  about time.  Because  it's about time  we that we quit
being  fools, and that's exactly what they think  we are, and we prove it to
them every day.

     The next question dealt with the alien technology and asked in essence,
"Hasn't  any one else  [other than the  government] come up  with the energy
technology that the aliens have?

     There's  been quite a few people who've come up with it and they've all
been stopped, and they'll all continue to be stopped.  Because once you have
it  you have  free energy.   Once you have  free energy they  no longer have
power over you.  You understand?  That's why they stop it.

     Another  question asking, "In  the film of  the assassination which was
examined  greatly by experts, why didn't they conclude that Kennedy's driver
shot him?"

     Examined  by whom greatly? Most  of the film that  you can purchase has
that  segment cut out, and  you can always tell it  by the person running in
the  background, they'll run up to here ...  all of a sudden they'll be down
here  ...  running.  You will see in most of the clips that you've ever seen
on  television, or in the movies, or that  you're able to get your hands on,
you'll see William Greer start to turn like this ..."

     That's because they clipped it out!  And on a lot of them, I'll bet you
most  of you, every time you've seen the clip on television, never looked at
the  driver anyway.  If you're really honest with yourself, and with me, you
know your eyes were right on Kennedy.

      A  woman  asked if  any  of the  alien  technology was  being  used in
present-day military equipment.

      Yes,there's a lot of alien technology contained in the Stealth bomber,
that's  right.  The Stealth fighter was  flying for 10 years before you even
knew it existed.

     "Before  you  let  us all  out  of here,  there's  a bunch  of  us here
wondering what can we all do to help bring this all out?"

     A  single word, "revolt," issued from several listeners simultaneously,
but Cooper responded, "Don't revolt.  What you need to do is what you should
have  been doing all along.  You  need to get involved with your government.
The first thing you need to do is purchase a copy of the Constitution, which
I  know that most of you don't have anywhere in your house, and if I were to
go  around this room and ask each person what the Constitution says, most of
you couldn't tell me what the Constitution says from your grocery bill.  And
that's  the truth! And that is your country!  So if you don't know what your
Constitution  is you're dead already, so the first thing you do is you get a
copy  of your Constitution.   The second thing  you do is  you learn it! The
third   thing  you  do   is  you  start  calling   your  senators  and  your
representatives,  and  the  President of  the  United States  and  you start
leaning  on  them,  and  you  tell  them,  'Unless  you  straighten  up  the
government,  and unless  we start  getting the truth,  and I  mean the whole












truth,  and no more of this baloney, this  is the last job you're ever going
to have, period.  And I'll do everything in my power to make sure that comes
true.'  And then write  them, frequently, saying  the same thing.   And then
when  they're in your area, in their  area offices, take a little delegation
and go see them, and make them understand that they're going to be living in
poverty  because they're not going to have  a job anymore come election day.
You see, the secret government may own the executive branch, but you people,
all  of us, we  own the Congress, and  the Congress makes  the laws, and the
Congress can impeach the entire executive branch! You also have the right to
petition the government for a redress of injuries.

     So you are powerful, you've just forgotten that you're powerful, you've
forgotten  that that  vote that you  haven't been doing  every time election
comes  around, that vote  has abdicated your  power.  That  vote you did not
cast  abdicated  your power  and gave  it  to those  who are  subverting the
Constitution and are ruining this country."

     "What was traded to the aliens for their technology?"

     People and animals

     Another man asked, "Is the Soviet Union in on any of this?"

     The  Soviet  Union and  the United  States of  America have  been close
allies  since the end of World War II and have been closely participating in
the  secret space program all this time.  The Soviets have the same thing we
have, yes.  What you see happening in the Soviet block right now is not the
result  of people  standing up and  saying, 'We  want to be  free.' It's the
result  of the international bankers saying,  'You tear down these barriers,
and  you meet the West half way, give  your people some freedom, the West is
going  to  take some  freedom  away from  their people  so  that we  can put
together  a one-world economic system  ...  and have  all the power.  That's
what's happening! If you don't believe it, stick around and watch it!"

     A  dubious woman then asked, "Why was the shellfish poison necessary? A
lot of his brain was blown off anyway."

     "The  shellfish  poison? If  you  go to  kill  someone, one  thing I've
learned, I learned it real good, I learned it especially good when I went to
Vietnam;  just because you shoot someone  doesn't mean they're going to die.
And  if they don't die, they're going to be  mad.  And if they've got a gun,
you're  dead. So you  want the first  time to be  the last time.   So if you
really  want to kill somebody you don't play  around.  If you really want to
kill  somebody ...  you  kill them, you don't play,  you make sure that when
you  shoot them, they're dead.  That way they can't hurt you, can't hurt you
at all.

     Regrettably,   the  next  question   was  totally  unintelligible,  but
thankfully  Mr.   Cooper had  a good  public address  system to  amplify his
reply.

     The first moon landing was May 22, 1962 ...  or excuse me, that was the
first  landing on Mars.  I'm sorry, May  22, 1962, was the winged probe that
used  a  hydrozine propeller,  flew  around approximately  three  orbits and












landed  on May 22,  1962, was a  joint United States/Russian  endeavor.  The
first  time that we landed on the moon was sometime during the ...  probably
middle 50s, because at the time when President Kennedy stated that he wanted
a man to set foot on the moon by the end of the decade we already had a
base there.

    "What about Mars?" came another quick question.

     We have a base on Mars also.

    "When did that happen?"

    I  don't know the exact date but I know the project's name, it was 'Adam
and Eve.'

     "How long have you known about this?"

     Well,  I revealed it publicly  for the first time  on July 2, 1989, and
within  three weeks of the  time I revealed it  publicly, the government, to
get  the American people  not to listen to  me, came out  and said that they
planned  to build a base on the moon and  a colony on Mars.  Now, three days
previous  to my speech, representatives from NASA said, 'We can never have a
colony  on Mars, it's impossible that there's  a colony on Mars because Mars
is  a dead planet.'  And it's not a  dead planet, they've  lied to you about
Mars.

    "My  name is Dave [unintelligible], I'm  a representative of the Crystic
Institute,   and  I'd  like  to  know  why  it  was  that  when  we  sent  a
representative down to your home, at your request, you failed to produce any
documentation to substantiate your allegations."

     In the first place it was not at my request, I have never contacted the
Crystic  Institute  in my  life.   I was  on the  Carol Hemingway  Show, she
contacted the Crystic institute, she told Daniel Shehan that I had just said
something  about Bush and  drugs on her show.   He called me  and told me he
wanted  to  send  an investigator,  in  fact he  told  me to  even  help the
investigator because he was new at the job, his name was Wayne Nelson, he is
a  very good gentleman, he stayed at  my house for two days, slept overnight
on my couch, I gave him everything I had.  I never told Daniel Shehan that I
had  any documents and I  never told Wayne Nelson  that I had any documents.
In  fact what I told Wayne  Nelson, and I quote,   'Wayne, if I did have the
documents  I couldn't admit it  and I don't know you  from Adam, and I don't
know  Daniel Shehan from Adam and what makes  you think I would give them to
you.'  'Who am  I going  to give  them to  and how  quick are  they going to
disappear,'  that was my thought.  Wayne Nelson also came to my house with a
stack  of  documents this  thick <hand  gesture> already  substantiating the
presence  of aliens and extraterrestrial craft  on this planet, and they are
keeping  it a secret,  because they're afraid somebody'll  laugh at them and
they'll lose their credibility.

     We need some patriots in this country, not people trying to make a name
for  themselves, trying to expose some  drug runners, because those are just
the bag-men.  The real crook is in the White House! And you can tell that to
Daniel Shehan!













    "Why  didn't Jackie  Kennedy report  [the source  of the  lethal shot]?"
asked another audience member.

     Who's  she going to  tell? The Secret Service  just killed her husband,
and  they're assigned to protect the president.  Also, who had her children?
The same Secret Service had her children at the time.

    "Wasn't  the craft at Roswell, New  Mexico, destroyed and all the aliens
killed?" another young man asked.

     All the aliens were dead but the craft was not completely destroyed, it
was severely damaged yes.

     On  an unrelated  note an older  gentleman asked, "Does  that mean that
Alternative-3 is true?"

     Alternative-3 is absolutely true and so is Alternative-2.

     Then a man in his late 20s or early 30s raised his hand, said something
unintelligible,  and was apparently recognized by  Mr. Cooper, who asked him
to take the podium and address the audience.

      What  I said  was that  I thanked  him [Cooper]  very much  for coming
forward  and saying something.  A lot of my friends out here know that I was
involved in the United States Special Forces, UFO Tracking and Research from
the  years 1971 to 1975.  My name is  Richard Murray, I was based out of the
71st  Tac Control  Flight, McDill  Air Force  Base, Tampa,  Florida. We were
'Mobile  Radar Command,' that was combat and  war ready.  We could be loaded
on  aircraft within an hour and many times were taken into areas [to] set up
radar.   A lot of times we were  set up around Eglund Air Force Base because
that's where they have the 'Altered Temperature Weather Control,' where they
can  test various  aircraft for their  shrinkage and  their dimension change
during  altered temperature.  So,  you know, I was told  to shut up twice in
1982  and they finally  threatened my parents  life so I  stayed quiet, and,
that's  when Wendel Stevens was taken off the streets... Just like that! And
I  hid for  quite awhile,  and decided to  come back  out when  I heard that
you're  [Cooper] of such  high rank as you  were, and I  felt just in saying
that  your credentials are true,  and that what you  have to say, everything
you've  said here today, I've heard before  behind closed doors.  And you've
really  tied the link for me to the Kennedy killing.  And there's a few more
links  that have to go on with the Columbia Cartel and the money laundering.
I  think there's more than one cartel  involved, and they're shutting one of
them down so one can maintain a power, it just seems to be the way it works.

     The  lecture  was  then  essentially  over.    The  "Alternative-2  and
Alternative-3"  that were referred to briefly are two government contingency
plans to:

1.   Declare Martial Law and invalidate the Constitution on the premise that
a  terrorist group had entered the country  with a Nuclear weapon with plans
to  detonate it  in a major  city.  All  dissidents would be  rounded up and
placed in concentration camps and the press and media would be nationalized.













All  this will happen if the information  becomes public before they want it
to or if the aliens attempt a takeover, and

2.    Another contingency  plan  to contain  or  delay the  release  of this
information, the details of which I am probably wrong about anyway.

     Mr. Cooper is a man who appears to be in his late 40s, of medium height
and  weight, and was dressed casually during  the lecture.  His hairline was
receding slightly, and he carried himself with confidence and purpose.  Bill
Cooper,  as he was  called by several  in attendance, is  not a professional
speaker.   His presentation  lacked the polish  of repeated deliveries which
all  the other  lectures had  during the  Expo, but  what it  lacked in fine
tuning was easily made up for in its content.

 This  file  contains  the  absolute true  information  regarding  the alien
presence  on Earth and  the U.S.  Government's  involvement with the aliens.
This file contains only the information as I saw it and only my information.
 It  does  not  contain any  information  from  any other  source.    It was
necessary  for me  to issue  the information previous  to this  release in a
manner  which  would  deceive  the  government  until  someone  was  able to
independently  confirm  my identity,  my employment,  my service  record, my
intelligence  background, the  identity of  the person  to which  I gave the
information  in 1972, his acknowledgment of  the information and when it was
given  to him,  that the information  is correct,  that I have  not seen him
since  1974, and  that I have  not communicated  with him in  any form since
1976.

     This  was  necessary because  this file  is my  death warrant  if MJ-12
continues to operate in a manner consistent with its history.

     All  in  the  last paragraph  has  been independently  verified  by two

     The original information that I first released was not much MAJI that I
was  not a threat long enough to  have independent verification of the facts
before I risked death.

     The  following is brief listing of everything that I personally saw and
know  from  1972  and does  not  contain  any input  from  any  other source
whatsoever.

MAJESTY was listed as the code word for the President of the United States
        for communications concerning this information.

OPERATION MAJORITY is the name of the operation responsible for every
        aspect, project, and consequence of alien presence on Earth.

GRUDGE contains 16 volumes of documented information collected from the
       beginning of the United States investigation of Unidentified Flying
       Objects (UFOs) and Identified Alien Crafts (IACs).

     The  project was financed by  CIA confidential funds (non-appropriated)
and  money from the illicit  drug trade.  Participation  in the illegal drug
trade  was  justified  in that  it  would  identify and  eliminate  the weak
elements  of our society.  The purpose  of Project Grudge was to collect all
scientific, technological, medical and intelligence information from UFO/IAC
sightings  and  contacts  with  alien  life forms.    This  orderly  file of













collected  information  has been  used to  advance  the United  States Space
Program.

MJ-12 is the name of the secret control group.

     President  Eisenhower commissioned a secret  society known as THE JASON
SOCIETY   (JASON  SCHOLARS)  to  sift   through  all  the  facts,  evidence,
technology, lies and deception and find the truth of the alien question.

     The  society was made up of 32 of the most prominent men in the country
in 1972 and the top 12 members were designated MJ-12.

     MJ-12  has total control  over everything.  They  are designated by the
codes J-1, J-2, etc., all the way through the members of the Jason Society.

     The director of the CIA was appointed J-1 and is the Director of MJ-12.

     MJ-12 is responsible only to the President.

     MJ-12 runs most of the world's illegal drug trade.

     This  was  done to  hide  funding and  thus  keep the  secret  from the
Congress  and the people of the United States.   It was justified in that it
would  identify and eliminate the weak elements of our society.  The cost of
funding  the  alien  connected  projects is  higher  than  anything  you can
imagine.

     MJ-12  assassinated President Kennedy when he informed them that he was
going to tell the public all the facts of the alien presence.

     He  was killed by the  Secret Service agent driving  his car, and it is
plainly  visible in the film held from public view.   A secret meeting place
was  constructed  for  MJ-12  in  MARYLAND  and  it  was  described  as only
accessible by air.

     It  contains full living, recreational,  and other facilities for MJ-12
and the JASON SOCIETY.

     It  is code named "THE COUNTRY  CLUB." Only those with TOP SECRET/MAJIC
clearance are allowed to go there.

MAJI is the MAJORITY AGENCY FOR JOINT INTELLIGENCE.

     All  information,  disinformation,  and  intelligence  is  gathered and
evaluated by this agency.  This agency is responsible for all disinformation
and  operates in conjunction with the CIA, NSA, and the Defense Intelligence
Agency.   This is a  very powerful organization, and  all alien projects are
under its control.  MAJI is responsible only to MJ-12.

SIGMA is the project which first established communications with the aliens
      and is still responsible for communications.
PLATO is the project responsible for diplomatic relations with the aliens.














     This  project secured a formal  treaty (illegal under the Constitution)
with  the aliens.  The terms were  that the aliens would give us technology.
In  return,  we agreed  to keep  their presence  on earth  a secret,  not to
interfere  in any way with their actions, and to allow them to abduct humans
and animals.  The aliens agreed to furnish MJ-12 with a list of abductees on
a periodic basis.

MAJIC is the security classification and clearance of all alien connected
      material, projects, and information.

MAJIC means MAJI Controlled.

AQUARIUS is a project which compiled the history of alien presence and their
interaction with Homo Sapiens upon this planet for the last 25,000 years and
culminating  with the Basque  people who live in  the mountainous country on
the border of France and Spain and the Syrians.

GARNET  is  the  project  responsible for  control  of  all  information and
documents  regarding this subject and  accountability of the information and
documents.

PLUTO  is a project to evaluate  all UFO/IAC information pertaining to space
tel [TRANSMISSION GARBLED]

POUNCE is the project formed to recover all downed/crashed craft and aliens.

REDLIGHT  is the project to test fly recovered alien craft.  It is conducted
at  AREA 51  (DREAMLAND) in Nevada.   It was  aided when the  aliens gave us
craft and helped us fly them.

     The initial project was somewhat successful in that we flew a recovered
craft,  but it blew up  in the air, and the  pilots were killed. The project
was suspended at that time until the aliens agreed to help us.

SNOWBIRD  was established  as a cover  for project  REDLIGHT. Several flying
saucer  type  craft  were  built using  conventional  technology.  They were
unveiled to the press and flown in front of the press.

     The  purpose  was  to  explain accidental  sightings  or  disclosure of
REDLIGHT as having been the SNOWBIRD craft.

LUNA  is the alien base on the far side of the Moon.  It was seen and filmed
by  the Apollo  astronauts.   A base,  a mining  operation using  very large
machines,  and the very  large alien craft described  in sighting reports as
MOTHER SHIPS exist there.

NRO is the National Recon Organization based at Fort Carson, Colorado. It is
responsible for security for all alien or alien craft connected projects.

DELTA  is  the  designation  for  the specific  arm  of  the  NRO,  which is
especially trained and tasked with security of these projects.















JOSHUA  is  a project  to develop  a low  frequency pulsed  sound generating
weapon.   It was said that this  weapon would be effective against the alien
craft and beam weapons.

EXCALIBUR is a weapon to destroy the alien underground bases.  It is to be a
missile  capable of penetrating 1000 meters of Tuff/hard packed soil such as
that found in New Mexico with no operational damage.

     Missile  apogee  not to  exceed  30,000 feet  AGL  and impact  must not
deviate  in excess  of 50  meters from designated  target.   The device will
carry a one-megaton nuclear warhead.

ALIENS:   There were four types of aliens  mentioned in the papers.  A LARGE
NOSED GREY with whom we have the treaty, the GREY reported in abductee cases
that  works for the LARGE  NOSED GREY, a blond  human like type described as
the NORDIC, a red haired human like type called the ORANGE.  The home of the
aliens  were  described  as being  a  star  in the  Constellation  of Orion,
Barnards star, and Zeta Riticuli 1&2.  I cannot remember even under hypnosis
which alien belongs to which star.

EBE  is the name or designation given to the live alien captured at the 1949
Roswell crash. He died in captivity.

KRLL  OR KRLLL OR  CRLL OR CRLLL  pronounced Crill or  Krill was the hostage
left with us at the first Holloman landing as a pledge that the aliens would
carry  out their  part of the  basic agreement reached  during that meeting.
KRLL  gave us the foundation  of the yellow book  which was completed by the
guests at a later date.  KRLL became sick and was nursed by Dr.  G.  Mendoza
who  became the expert on alien biology  and medicine.  KRLL later died. His
information was disseminated under the pseudonym O.H. Cril or Crill.

GUESTS  were aliens  exchanged for  humans who  gave us  the balance  of the
yellow  book.  At the time I saw  the information there were only three left
alive.  They were called (P&#'s) Alien Life Forms.

[TRANSMISSION GARBLED]

RELIGION

    The aliens claim to have created Homo Sapiens through hybridization. The
papers  said that RH-blood was proof of  this.  They further claimed to have
created all four major religions.

     They  showed  a  hologram  of  the  crucifixion  of  Christ  which  the
government filmed.  They claim that Jesus was created by them.

ALIEN  BASES exist in the  four corners area of  Utah, Colorado, New Mexico,
and  Nevada.   Six bases were  described in  the 1972 papers,  all on Indian
reservations  and all in the four corners area.  The base near Dulce was one
of them.

MURDER














     The  documents stated that  many military and  government personnel had
been  terminated  (murdered  without  due  process  of  law)  when  they had
attempted to reveal the secret.

CRAFT RECOVERIES


     The  documents stated  that many craft  had been recovered.   The early
ones from Roswell, Aztec, Roswell again, Texas, Mexico, and other places.

GENERAL  DOOLITTLE made a  prediction that one  day we would  have to reckon
with  the  aliens, and  the document  stated that  it appeared  that General
Doolittle  was correct.   ABDUCTIONS  were occurring  long before  1972. The
document  stated  that  humans  and  animals  were  being  abducted  and  or
mutilated.  Many vanished without a trace.

     They  were  taking sperm  and ova  samples, tissue,  performed surgical
operations,  implanted a spherical device 40 to  80 microns in size near the
optic nerve in the brain and all attempts to remove it resulted in the death
of the patient.  The document estimated that one in every 40 people had been
implanted.  This implant was said to give the aliens total control of that
human.

CONTINGENCY  PLAN SHOULD THE INFORMATION BECOME  PUBLIC OR SHOULD THE ALIENS
ATTEMPT A TAKEOVER.

     This  plan called for a public  announcement that a terrorist group had
entered the United States with an atomic weapon.  It would be announced that
the  terrorists planned to detonate the weapon in a major city.  Martial law
would  be declared and all  persons with implants would  be rounded up along
with all dissidents and would be placed into concentration camps.

     The  press, radio, and TV would  be nationalized and controlled. Anyone
attempting to resist would be arrested or killed.

CONTINGENCY PLAN TO CONTAIN OR DELAY RELEASE OF INFORMATION


This  plan called for the use of MAJESTIC TWELVE as a disinformation ploy to
delay  and confuse the release of information should anyone get close to the
truth.    It was  selected because  of  the similarity  of spelling  and the
similarity  to MJ-12. It was  designed to confuse memory  and to result in a
fruitless search for material that does not exist.

 SOURCE OF MATERIAL CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENTS WHICH I SAW

 The  source of  the material was  an Office of  Naval Intelligence counter-
intelligence  operation against MJ-12 in order for  the Navy to find out the
truth  of what was really going on.   The Navy (at that time or at least the
Navy that I worked for) were not participants in any of this.  The different
services  and the  government conduct  this type  of operation  against each
other  all the  time.  The  result of this  operation was that  the Navy cut
themselves  in for a  piece of the  action (technology) and  control of some













projects.   As  you can  see this file  is only  a little  different from my
previous file.

     Only  some names  were scrambled  previously to  confuse the government
long  enough for someone  to verify that what  I have said is  the truth.  I
have added information in this file that puts me in absolute danger.  I have
sent a copy of this file to people all over the country and will continue to
do so.


     Please  get this file into as many hands as you can and maybe that will
protect me but I doubt it.

 HISTORY WILL BE THE JUDGE OF ME AND THIS INFORMATION, AND I HAVE NO FEAR OF
THAT  JUDGEMENT.  I SWEAR  THAT THIS INFORMATION IS  TRUE AND CORRECT TO THE
BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.

     I  wish to thank  all those people  who have aided  me in reaching this
point  and for their patience and understanding.   I owe you all more than I
can  ever repay.  Finally, it does not  matter who is right and who is wrong
or  if a  project name is  in the wrong  place.   It does not  matter who is
working for whom or what is really what.

     It  should be obvious by now that something sinister and terribly wrong
is  going on involving the  government and the UFO  phenomenon.  We must all
band  together and expose  it now.  I  have done my part  in the best manner
that  I could.  I can add nothing  else except my testimony in Congress or a
court  of law that what I saw and have written in this file is true and that
I saw it.

     Everything in my previous file that does not conflict with this file is
true  and correct to the best of my knowledge and some of it is from sources
and  research.  You may  combine the files to  get the entire picture. Throw
out  only that information that conflicts  with that contained in this file.
There will be no further additions or corrections to this information either
now or in the future.

     My  file is complete and  stands to be judged  by history.  Sometime in
the  future the exact papers  that I saw will surface,  and you will all see
this exact information contained within them.

Appendix C:  Musings

     There is some thought that the U.S.  Air Force, in conjunction with the
Canadians,  has standing  orders to  deny any  UFO sightings  to the public.
Timothy Good, in his book Above Top Secret, states:

     "Cooperation  between the United States and  Canada in the reporting of
UFOs   was   laid  down,   for  example,   in  the   Canadian-United  States
Communications  Instructions  for  Reporting  Vital  Intelligence  Sightings
(CIRVIS) JANAP 146 (E), issued in March 1966 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as
well as the Canadian Defense Staff.  This publication lists instructions for
the  reporting of  'information of vital  importance to the  security of the
United  States of America and Canada and  their forces, which in the opinion
of  the observer, requires very urgent defensive and/or investigative action
by  the U.S.  and/or Canadian armed  forces.' Sightings within  the scope of
JANAP 146 include 'Unidentified Flying Objects' as distinct from 'Hostile of
unidentified  single  aircraft or  formations  of aircraft,'  and  there are
lengthy and elaborate instructions for reporting UFOs" (Good, 192).

     And  later he states:   "Because of reports  like these [UFOs], airline
pilots  became subject to  military restrictions contained  in a Joint Army-
Navy-Air  Force Publication (JANAP),  drawn up by  the Joint Communications-
Electronics  Committee, and  promulgated by the  Joint Chiefs  of Staff, and
could  thus find themselves liable to a prison term of up to 10 years and/or
a  fine  of $10,000  if they  discussed  their sightings  with the  media or
public" (Good, 283).

     Stan  Barrington  offers a  document  about "Operation  Majority, which
concerns  the dealings of  MJ-12.  The following  discussion, taken from the
alt.conspiracy   section  of  Usenet,  focuses  on  the  validity  of  those
documents:













     "What   is  the  latest  status  of  the  MJ-12  documents  (concerning
authenticity)?  I know that Klass did his usual debunking job, but also read
that  Friedman  produced  all  the supporting  evidence  Klass  had demanded
(similar  typefaces in use on  other documents of the  same era, etc.).  Has
the  U.S. Government  taken a formal  position on the  MJ-12 documents? What
evidence,  pro and  con, has been  produced on the  authenticity issue since
their  release.    What  are  the  details of  the  release?    Any  and all
information will be appreciated.  Thanks."

     The  reply was:  "I  don't know about the  U.S.  Government's position,
but  Klass has done a pretty good job of showing that there is at least some
fraud  in  the  papers.   In  particular,  he has  shown  that  the supposed
signature  of Harry Truman on one of the critical papers is identical to the
signature on another document in the National Archives, except that it's (if
I recall correctly) 3.6 percent larger.  It is impossible for two signatures
to  be  identical  unless one  is  a  photographic copy  of  the  other, and
interestingly,  most copying machines do a very small expansion of what they
copy to prevent edge effects--a blow-up of exactly 1.2 percent.  So it would
appear  this supposed signature is  actually a third-generation photocopy of
Truman's  signature.   Handwriting experts have  confirmed this.   I believe
it's written up in the current (Spring 1990) Skeptical Inquirer, but I can't
find my copy at the moment so I can't say for sure."

     I  don't know who Klass or Friedman  are, (although Friedman may be the
same  person that was mentioned as a helper in Majestic by Whitley Strieber,
and also mentioned as a government official in the speech) but the Skeptical
Inquirer is a respected paranormal debunking newspaper put out by James "the
Amazing" Randi.

     It  also  seems  to me  that  the  idea that  Truman's  signature  is a
photocopy  of another one in the National Archives is a bit odd.  There must
be  thousands of Truman signature in the Archives, and thinking that someone
could  find  the  one that  exactly  matched  a 3.6  percent  enlargement is
laughable (but then again, those same people find the idea of a huge UFO
cover-up laughable).

     Whitley  Strieber is a strange  character in this whole  affair.  He is
the  writer of Wolfen and The Howling, two horror novels.  Lately, he turned
to writing about UFOs.

    His  first  book  on the  subject,  Communion, deals  with  his personal
experiences with abduction by an unknown intelligence (Strieber always tries
to  avoid the word "alien," so he can  leave the options open that these are
humans   that  are  traveling  through  time  or  even  an  unknown  earthly
intelligence).   His second book, Transformation,  is not as familiar to me,
but I have heard that it is more of the same as Communion, except that it is
less  well  supported and  deals with  a  sort of  religion of  the unknown.
Strieber contends in that book that the "others" (as he calls them) gave him
a  sketchy design for an anti-gravity motor that relies on rotating magnets.
His  third  book is  Majestic.   Milton  William Cooper  mentions it  in his
speech.   This book  follows the Cooper  speech closely in  many regards; in
fact,  sometimes it seems like  one is stealing from  the other because they
are so close.  Strieber writes this book as fiction, but at the end there is












a  section in which  he says that  the book is  based on truth  and that the
government  is hiding  information from  the public.   He  insists that this
truth  must be brought out.   However, Cooper says  that Strieber is working
for  the government.   He offers  some proof  to this claim,  but he doesn't
really  say why  the government  would hire  Strieber to  write Majestic, or
whether  he  was hired  before he  wrote  Communion and  Transformation. All
Cooper  says is that Strieber is testing the waters, leaking the information
in a way that the government could deny.

     I  think that if Strieber  works for the government,  then it is mostly
likely  because the government thinks that  people will not believe anything
he  writes  about UFOs,  given his  history  of writing  horror.   Thus, the
government has Strieber write something that is based on truth, and everyone
thinks it is coming from such a bad source that it must be false.

This from Keith Rowell in Oregon:

    "You  folks interested  in Strieber's claims  should check  out the book
Report on Communion (Morrow, 1989) by Ed Conroy.

    "Conroy  is a San Antonio-based freelance  reporter who wrote some early
articles  for  the  local  newspaper  and  then  continued  to  explore  and
investigate  till he  ended up  with a  book.   He basically  concludes that
Strieber's  claims are true as far as  we now understand the UFO phenomenon,
which is very far from adequate at this time.  (The scholarly and scientific
establishment has yet to honestly and openly embrace the problem of the UFO.
Conroy's book is opening the way for the investigative media people, though.
Things  are changing as the UFO issue just refuses to go away.) You will all
hear  more and more  about the reality status  of UFOs as  we go through the
1990s.   Intelligence establishment secrecy is  being slowly broken down and
the  scientific/scholarly community is slowly  putting up less resistance as
the years go by.

    "My  opinions are based  on 15 years  of reading the  UFO literature and
four  years or so of more or less active participation in the UFO community.
It  is very hard to understand what is going on in the UFO community without
paying  very  close  attention  to  it.   The  normal  sources  of  news and
information  cover this group of people in a very inconsistent and sometimes
downright  biased way.   You're just going to  have to get  your feet wet on
this one; otherwise, you'll just being talking through your hat.

    "I'll  be  happy  to  send via  electronic  mail  my  representative UFO
bibliography  to anyone  who wants  it.   Lately, new  (and significant) UFO
books  are added practically  monthly in the  past few years.   UFOs are hot
again.  We seem to be in a peak of activity again.

    "The  latest  significant  book  is  by  Ed  Walters  on  his Gulfbreeze
UFO/photograph  experiences, being distributed to your local bookstores as I
write this."

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     What is this? A "Food for Thought" article by Anesthesia? Yup! Sure is.

     There  are a few things  that bother me about  today's society.  People
have  opinions but  are afraid  to express  them.   Fortunately, some  of us
aren't.

     I  am becoming  more of  a radical vegetarian  as time  passes.  Mainly
because  I am surrounded by  people who either don't  understand my views or
simply  don't care to.  What effect does this  have on me?  It makes me want
to tell them even more what I think.  Believe me, I am doing my share of it!

     I  take every opportunity to comment on  diet to anyone who will listen
or  has to listen.   I fill  out comment cards  everywhere I go.   Mainly, I
express my views in any way I can.

     For  the most part, I have had astounding results.  People are starting
to  become more flexible and even making  special considerations as far as I
am  concerned.  Mainly,  I am just  pleased that people  are listening to my
opinions.

     Another  pleasing thing to see is  others actually showing an interest.
Particularly people I haven't actually talked to.

     I  have been leaving copies of  Vegetarian Times around reading rooms I
encounter.   I even  leave them in  the break room  at work.   This helps me
reach  other people I  normally wouldn't reach.   I have  a theory that this
could work well with any form of literature.  Especially radical literature,
such as this magazine.

     I  know not  all of  our readers  are vegetarian,  but I  do think that
sometimes  good examples can inspire great works in many areas.  This was my
great example.

     For those of you interested in obtaining copies of Vegetarian Times, it
is carried by most General Nutrition Centers (GNC), natural food stores, and
many occult book shops.  They may also be reached by writing

                              Vegetarian Times

                            Chickpeas and Olives

     This  recipe transforms a  can of chickpeas, or  garbanzo beans, into a
filling  a flavorable meal.  It's delicious at room temperature; served hot,
it'll knock the chill off the coldest winter night.

     16-oz can of garbanzo beans, drained
     5 or 6 kalamata olives, pitted and halved












     1 cloved garlic, minced            1/2 tsp dried thyme
     1/2 red onion, chopped             1/4 cup water       
     1/2 Tbs. olive oil                 1/4 tsp each, salt & pepper


     Rinse and drain the chickpeas.  In a medium saute pan, saute garlic and
onion  in olive oil over medium heat for 2 minutes.  Add chickpeas and thyme
and  saute for  an additional  minute.   Add remaining  ingredients amd heat
through.  Serve hot or at room temperature.  Serves 2.

|                             by David Lightman                            |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

     Some  people probably would celebrate the prospect of the leading fast-
food  corporation  distributing nutrition  education materials  to children.
However,  the Physicians  Committee for  Responsible Medicine  (PCRM) wishes
that McDonald's hadn't bothered.

     Last  March, McDonald's began distributing  Happy Meals which contained
one  of four plastic "food"  prizes: a steak, a  bread slice, a milk carton,
and  an  apple.   Included  with  the prizes  were  propagandist nutritional
pamphlets  geared for  children.  The  pamphlet packaged with  the toy steak
made  this claim:  "Eating two  servings of these  [meat] foods  can make it
easier to do things like climb higher and ride your bike farther."

     PCRM  founder  Neal Barnard,  M.D. counters  that  the claim  is false.
"Athletes eat for endurance by building up glycogen stores in the muscles, "
he  explains.  "Glycogen is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates come only from
plant foods, not from meat."

     At  a press conference in Washington,  D.C., PCRM called on the Federal
Trade Commission to bar distribution of the pamphlets because, Barnard says,
they  contain "blatantly false information targeted  at children who are not
in a position to read it critically."

     McDonald's  media  relations  department  did  not  return  phone calls
requesting comments on PCRM's press conference.

     Interestingly  enough,  in  Holland,  the  84  McDonald's  outlets have
introduced  a veggie  burger.   It is  slightly more  expensive but contains
about half the fat and half the calories of the Quarter Pounder.

     Although  20% of  restaurant goers in  the United States  say they seek
meatless   options  when  dining  out,   Rebecca  Caruso,  spokesperson  for
McDonald's  headquarters states that  Americans won't be  able to sample the
veggie-burger,  saying "At this point, we have NO plans to introduce [it] in
the United States."

     Burger  King,  however is  trying  a veggie  burger  in several  of its
upstate  New York locations by  request of local consumers  and it is faring












quite  well.   They need  our support  and input  to allow  these changes to
become  more widespread.   Burger King DOES  seem receptive to  the needs of
their  consumers, thinking perhaps they  will cash in on  the ignored 20% of
consumers  who desire  meatless entrees, the  78% who are  looking for lower
cholesterol foods, and the 77% who are eating less fatty foods.

     The  only link  I can  imagine is that  McDonald's in  America is being
controlled,  through financial means or other  to support and even lie about
meat  consumption  to  maintain  an  uneducated  consumer  populace.    They
apparently will even go so far as to spread propaganda to children to insure
that  the upcoming, more health-conscious generation is effectively deceived
into believing that meat is necessary for health.

Recommendations:

     Write  letters  to  both  companies,  stating  you  want  a  vegetarian
selection other than their rendition of the lame salad routine.

     Independently,  McDonald's seems a harder nut  to crack.  While on road
trips, I frequent their restrooms, since there's always a McDonald's nearby.
I  never buy anything;  I just drop  a load.   See?  McDonald's  IS good for
shit.   Maybe we'll never get a  veggie-burger from them, but what is better
social  commentary  than  vegetarian excrement?    Maybe they'll  go  out of
business  from thousands of  non-paying customers using  their toilet paper,
toilets,  water, and soap.  Maybe their prices  will have to be so high that
even carnivores will avoid them...  We can only dream.

____________________________________________________________________________
















     I was talking with someone that had just finished reading issue #4.  He
noticed  our article on Wicca and stated  his opinions.  This really made me
think.

     To  start, we are not Wiccan, but since we support freedom of speech, I
feel  most views should be expressed.  I know quite a few Wiccans, and enjoy
talking  with them.   Almost  as much as  I enjoy  debating with Christians!
<Grin>

     I  really  feel that  the current  incarnation of  Catholicisms' church
system is in great need of reform.  If you agree with me, then maybe you can
be  a part of that reform.  Most Catholic-based churches I have visited have
a  donation  plate  that they  pass  around.   To  me, this  sounds  like an
excellent place to view your opinions!  Before you go to church, make a list
of  things you notice  that bother you or  things that make  you happy.  Let
them know!

     Although  I am not a Christian,  I do want to say  that this is not the
place to cause chaos.  Respect their choice of religion and sanctuary.  Just
leave persistent comments on their progress.  Don't send hate notes or other
such items, as they won't take you seriously.

     Personally,  Christianity always struck me as  a little odd.  That's my
opinion.   Maybe I am seeing a lot of bad aspects, but maybe that's society.
(That's what Daiv always tells me, and I'm starting to agree with him.)

     The  one thing that irks me in particular about the Christian church is
their  view on  how to  spread their message.   Converting  people on street
corners  is a  bit forceful.   [You  think THAT's  forceful??   Remember the
Crusades??    How  about  witch  burnings??    The  moral  majority??]  It's
compounded  further when they simply  won't take 'NO!' for  an answer.  Some
have  even yelled  insults at me  when I walked  away.  In  my religion, you
actually  have  to look,  to find  someone.   You don't  even hear  about it
anymore.  In a spiritual vocation, the most effective means is to set a good
example.  The American Christian church is missing this necessary example.

     Lastly,  I am not  a Christian, Satanist,  Wiccan, or any  of those.  I
may, eventually put my views on paper - I'm sure it will shock some.

     To  those I've offended, "Sorry."   I made you  think though, didn't I?
Well, let me know how you feel or write an article.

San Diego -
     A  superior court jury has awarded $300,000 to a couple unlawfully held
for  making obscene gestures at  a police helicopter.   The chopper flew in,
hovered, and shone a powerful searchlight on the couple while they barbecued
in  their back  yard.   To drive  the chopper  off, the  pair extended their












middle fingers.  Almost immediately, 15 police officers raided the property.
The couple sued the police department when no charges were filed.

right  to give the  finger to a  Kentucky law enforcement  officer.  Even an
obscene gesture may be a form of free speech, according to the judge.

     Plastic  tampon applicators have washed up on the Jersey shore over the
past few years.  Now, Clean Ocean Action, a environmental group in the area,
is  gathering the  devices, painting different  colors, and  selling them to
fishing groups as lures.  They're being called Tampoons.

longer than men who don't, it's been reported.  And probably 20 years longer
than those who kiss someone else's wife.

     Due  to our recent relocation and  the difficulties associated with the
situation, we will not be presenting feedback from the previous month, as it
hasn't reached us.


Addendum:
















                    NOTE! on distribution of this file:

     Issue  #1 has been circulated quite a bit  around a few areas and a bit
on  Internet. [eg. England, Germany, Australia]  If you find our articles of
interest  then please pass this  file around in your  local area, as well as
anywhere  on any Net you can.  Writing  us a letter via Internet will almost
assure future issues directly to you.  We realize that there are many places
on  Internet we  cannot reach  or simply don't  know about  (please send all
mail-serv's and ftp sites to us) and that's where you can help.

     For  most of us,  this is free.   We are getting  copies out by E-mail,
postal mail, and file transfer.  We cannot spare the time to call everywhere
though.   So  we are  trying to  work out  places that  this publication can
ALWAYS be found.  If you're interested in carrying it, let us know, we'll be
more than happy to work something out.

     We  would like to publish  it, more or less,  and have it available for
subscription.  But that would make our HQ too well known, and jeopardize the
whole  operation.  Soon, though, we will  have a (postal) mailbox sent up to
receive  letters from our  non-computer using readers  and also subscription
info.

     Things can only get more interesting!
