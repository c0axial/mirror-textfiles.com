Editorial - A Long Way From The Model T
by Dave Bealer

My 1989 Ford Probe GT is a far cry from the Model T that put Henry on
the map so long ago.  The Probe's top speed of 135 miles per hour
(which envelope I have never pushed the outside of) is four to five
times faster than the original Model T's top end.  Of course little
has actually changed in the past 25 years.  The 1960s produced cars
capable of blowing the doors off my Probe, although the Probe sports
better safety equipment and fuel economy than the original "pony
cars."

Random Access Humor             Page  2                October 1994

The computer industry of the past quarter century has made a few more
quantum leaps forward.  A popular "what if" game involves what cars
would look and perform like if the auto industry had made the same
strides.  It usually goes something like: "If cars had experienced
the same price/performance improvements as computers in the past 25
years, a 1969 Ford Mustang (my first car, purchased second-hand in
1975) that cost $2000 new and could go 120 MPH would have improved to
the point where a 1994 Ford Mustang would cost $4.50 new and go 3500
MPH."

If I can't have that mythical Mustang that could zoom from New York
to Los Angeles in an hour, at least I can have a Pentium.  As
mentioned in the first article specifically written for RAH ("The
Model T Of Personal Computing" - RAH 09/92), my first PC was a XT
that was hopelessly out of date when I assembled it in 1986.  On
09/21/94 I received my new Gateway 2000 P5-90XL machine, which sports
a 90 MHz Pentium CPU.  This new machine is so fast it finishes
executing commands *before* I press the <enter> key.

There are drawbacks, of course.  The 17 inch Crystalscan monitor will
probably burn out my remaining eyesight a few years quicker than the
old 14 inch SVGA monitor.  My pocketbook is already groaning from my
efforts to fill that new gigabyte hard disk with software, none of it
on sale.  And my office is even more of a rat's maze of wires that
would give a county fire inspector a heart attack. 

So if this issue of RAH seems a little harder to read than previous
issues, it may have something to do with it being composed and
assembled on a 90MHz Pentium.  Dr. Hoo and the rest of the Vaporware
Labs crew are working on a utility to slow down the pixels in future
issues for readers who don't themselves have a Pentium.  Stay tuned
for details.
                             - - - -
So the baseball strike spiked the World Series this year.  A squabble
between a few hundred millionaires and a couple dozen billionaires
ruined America's "national pastime."  The real tragedy of all this is
that millions of American men will have one less excuse to avoid
going outside and raking the leaves.  Things could get worse if Mom
and Apple Pie go out on a sympathy strike.
                             - - - -
It has come to my attention that there exists in the United States a
group called Defenders of Defenders of Life.  The members of this
group raise money for the legal defense of people who have murdered
physicians who perform abortions.  Like most Americans I have a very
definite opinion about the abortion issue (which is not germane to
this discussion).  But no matter which side of that particular fence
you're on, the idea of killing your fellow human beings to prove your
dedication to the sanctity of human life is utterly ridiculous.
Anyone whose mind can leap to such a "logical" conclusion desperately
needs a long vacation in a rubber room.

FLASH: Last minute bad news from the hardware installation front.  My
loft office became a living "hardware hell" the last ten days of
September.  During an attempt to install an EISA Ethernet card in my
old Gateway 486DX/33E the EISA configuration was somehow destroyed,
which rendered the EISA SCSI controller inoperable.  Since all the
RAH material for the issue under development was on the 340MB SCSI
drive attached to this controller, my priorities suddenly changed.
It took most of the final weekend in September to get things restored
to something approaching normal.  The worst part was finding the
original Gateway EISA Utility diskette that accompanied the machine
when it was delivered in January 1992.  As usual, I had not made a
backup copy of the thing.  The old Gateway, she ain't what she used
to be.

Alright, I apologize.  Anyway, the old machine is still not
completely stable, and all this fuss prevented me from completing
the Star Trek TNG parody I had planned for this month.  (Hey, it
sounds better than "the dog ate my homework.")  Look for it next
month, along with Muffy Mandel's long-awaited biography of Vinnie
"The Knife" Calamari.  Muffy is running the piece past the Vaporware
legal department in an attempt to determine how many of Vinnie's
friends and associates will be arrested and/or murdered if it is
published.                                                      {RAH}

GUI Health Care - The Real Deal
by Greg Borek

Mr. Miller?  Mr. Miller, can you hear me?

Oh, my head.  Wh...Where am I?

You're in the hospital, Mr. Miller.

The hospital?  What happened?  Ow... What happened to my head?  My
wife didn't hit me with that frying pan again, did she?

No, Mr. Miller, but try not to move.  You have sustained some rather
intense internal injuries.  The pain will be a little severe for a
while, but your condition will soon improve.  What can you remember?

Well, everything is a little fuzzy.  I seem to remember sitting at my
computer at home.  I was playing a game of Wolfenstein I think.  No,
wait, I was finishing my bowling program.

Bowling program?

Yes, doctor, I was writing a program to keep track of my bowling
league.

Are you a programmer then?

No, I own a feed and grain business.  Nothing much, but it pays the
bills.  I dabble a little in programming on my old 286.  I couldn't
find a program that did just what I wanted.  Bowling league
statistics are nothing to be trifled with, you know.  There is some 
quite complex mathematics involved.

Random Access Humor             Page  5                October 1994

Go on.  This is most interesting.  Give me as many details as you
can, but please, take it easy; you've suffered quite a severe trauma.

I'll try, Doctor.  Yes, my head seems to be clearing a bit.  I was
working in Turbo Pascal version 3.3.  That's right; I remember now.
I was putting the final touches on the program when I decided to
check to see whether I should release the program as shareware.  It's
all coming back to me now.  I was looking at a PC Magazine when it
struck me: the program was just so,...so inadequate.  Sure, it
worked.  It worked fine, no bugs, just what I needed, but it wasn't,
you know, Windows.  I needed to put it into some GUI.  Drop menus.
Mouse support.  And Wizards, had to have those hypertext help
screens.  Ow.... 

Calm down, Mr. Miller, don't yourself get so excited.

It's just,...there was just so much to learn!  I felt so...so
inadequate.  I realized I needed to get the program out on CD-ROM or
it would never sell.  Installation routines.  Where to start?  Ow...

Mr. Miller, try to relax.  You have already pulled one muscle in
your brain already.  (Nurse, get a sedative).

I mean, I wrote a valid program.  It did what I wanted.  Without
bugs.  And now it's not good enough.  I, ow,... I thought DOS was a
good thing.  I thought having just anybody, even someone like me who
isn't a professional programmer, able to write programs in their
garage was a benefit.  I mean, even I might come up with a real
innovation!  Ow..., ugh.  (Clunk).

Doctor, he's gone.  We lost him.

No, nurse, we lost him a while ago.  And good riddance.

What?  Doctor Gates, you can't be serious?

Of course I am, nurse.  I've had it up to here with these make-
believe techo-weenies thinking they are real programmers.
Programming used to be, well, exalted.  It used to be done by clever
men in long white coats in large, refrigerated rooms.  They were
highly paid and highly respected.  Shareware?  Bah!  Don't you
understand?  We have to make all PC software in Windows using
programming languages that take months for the average schmoe to
climb the precipitous learning curve.  This man was clearly a danger
to the mystery and power of programming.  Don't you see?  We have to
make programming more difficult!

Doctor, if everything is written for Windows, doesn't that also put
billions of more dollars in you pocket?

Yes, but I'm not doing this for the money.  It's...it's just the
principle of the thing.  Besides, this way I have even more control
of the lemmings out there.  The sheep will follow me anywhere, won't
they?  Ha, ha, ha! (Diabolical laughter).

The spread of legalized, state-sponsored gambling in the U.S. has
been causing an uproar for many years.  Maryland's recent addition 
of Keno to the state's arsenal of tools for separating citizens from
their money has caused tremendous friction within the State
Legislature as well as the general public.  The cries of "What's 
next?" can be heard from those who tirelessly work to protect the 
well being of others (including others who do not want their well 
being protected).

Opponents of gambling insist that each new form of gaming that is
legalized brings us closer to having slot machines in every deli 
and convenience store.  Of course America already harbors tens of
thousands of gambling devices, all of them completely legal.  They're
called vending machines.

Yes, vending machines.  Those seemingly innocuous no-armed bandits
that eat the coins of rich and poor alike.  Occasionally, one will
even "pay off," giving the player that desperately desired soda or 
candy bar.  This doesn't happen too often...just enough to keep the
suckers, er, players coming back for more.

Even more pernicious are those glass front vending machines that
tease the player by almost dropping the coveted goody into the chute,
but not quite.  Even though the hoped for item seems to be just
hanging there, ready to fall, no amount of pounding on the glass or 
shaking the machine will set it free.  The player therefore has to
spend again, hoping to get two payoffs, or AT LEAST that tantalizing 
prize left hanging just out of reach. 

Why is you never hear about legal action being taken to regulate the 
vending machine industry?  At least states could set some minimum
payoff requirements like most states with legal casinos did.

One potential, and frightening, application of artificial
intelligence is in vending machines that will decide what you want
and dispense it to you, after taking the money out of your pocket.
This technology is obviously modelled after liberal Democrats in
government.                                                     {RAH}

People In The News
by Robert Hankins

Alice Cooper has a new release out: "Flush My Career".  We used to
think that Alice Cooper was the embodiment of, and spokesman for,
America's angst-ridden youth.  Then again, we used to think that
Supertramp was cool.  But let's take a closer look at Alice Cooper,
shall we?  Take away the make-up and the shock theatrics and what
have you got?  A fifty year old man running around on stage with a
snake.  The new compact disk has very little to offer musically.  The
snake isn't even on it, even though he appears on the cover(with
Alice, natch).  The CD fails mostly because of Cooper's reluctance to
actually sing any of the songs.  Instead he recites his big hits such
as "Eighteen" in a Richard III type of voice.  Ever notice how stupid
a song sounds when you recite the lyrics?  Try this test.  Put on
your most dramatic voice, hold a skull in one hand and do the chorus
of the Beatles' "Drive My Car".  It doesn't count unless you do the
the "beep beep, yeah!" part.  So to Alice's alleged "comeback", we
say, "go away."  But apparently he won't.  Cooper's manager sent us a
pre-release of Alice's new cookbook for bachelors and other single
people in general.  Entitled "Alice's Cafeteria", it features such
recipes as "Fettucini Carbonara"(bacon with Kraft macaroni and
cheese), "Alice's New York Open-Faced Turkey Sandwich"(Louis Rich
turkey cuts on toast), and "Veal Cutlets"(veal cutlets ---- "don't
grill 'em or they'll burn!" warns a concerned Alice).  The book
boasts many photos of Alice and the snake dressed in chef's outfits
and threatening each other with spatulas.  Of course, for the three
dollars they would normally spend on the book, patrons could purchase
a double quarter pounder with cheese.

>> Deaths/Obituaries <<

RAH takes at least some regret in announcing the death of David
Steinberg's career.  The career took its own life after the fifteen
zillionth consecutive joke about Moldavia, July 14th, on The Jay Leno
Show.  Pallbearers included the careers of Dick Cavett, Mike Douglas,
and Bachman Turner Overdrive.  Said Cavett: "We kept telling David to
change his schtick, but he wouldn't listen.  He'd had a big head ever
since he directed an episode of 'The Mommies' and well, I guess he
thought he was immortal or something."

"The Arsenio Hall Show" ----- after five years Hall quit his show
rather than face cancellation by Paramount.  A visibly shaken Harvey
Fierstein, habitual guest of the program, said, "What will I do now?
Letterman's booked until 1998.  I love Conan O'Brien's hair but he's
just Too Harvard.  And Regis and Kathy give me the snoozies.  Ruff
Ruff!  What about that nice Byron Allen, he's still on isn't he?"

"Star Trek: TNG" -------- Another Paramount show.  For seven years
the cast complained that they were serious actors whose talents were
wasted on kiddie science fiction.  So when producer Rick Berman
pulled the plug you'd think they'd be happy.  Instead they all gave
tearful interviews saying, "I can't believe it's over; the show was
so popular!"  Hey Riker, see you at the next convention when it comes
time to put a new foundation on your house.                     {RAH}

Childhood Misconceptions
by Dave Bealer

Young children don't see the world the same way as adults.  Not only
do they see everything from a lower angle, but they have difficulty
seeing things as a whole, and concentrate only on parts of things -
usually the part they're looking at the moment.  The fact that most
kids have the attention span of a gnat doesn't help matters.

Whatever the reason for it, children's fragmented understanding of
the world around them can lead to hilarious misconceptions.  A few of
the ones I've experienced and/or heard of are presented here.

 1) (from my own childhood)  My father was an accomplished handyman
    who could fix just about anything.  This meant regular trips to
    Sears to pick up new tools and equipment (Dad only used Craftsman
    tools).  One day, at a very young age, it occurred to me that no
    matter how unusual (at least to me) a tool or part Dad was
    looking for, Sears always had one.  I asked him, "how did Sears
    know you needed one of those?" 

 2) (from Greg Borek's childhood)  Greg, not quite grasping the
    concept of records and tapes (CDs had not been invented yet),
    thought that music coming over the radio was being played live by
    the bands at the radio studio. 

Random Access Humor             Page 13                October 1994

 3) A friend's son had an appendectomy a few years ago.  When in the
    hospital recovering, the boy (then eight years old) was informed
    by his mother that tests showed nothing had actually been wrong
    with his appendix.  The lad suddenly went pale and, on the verge
    of crying, asked, "Are they going to put it back?"

 4) (story related to me by someone)  A boy was teasing his seven
    year old brother with a child-proof bottle.  He opened it, closed
    it, then gave it to his brother to try.  The younger boy turned
    the top with no result, so the elder showed him again and gave it
    back to him.  After a while the seven year old stopped and said,
    "One thing I don't understand - how does it know I'm a child?"

There you have it, four examples of childhood misconceptions.  If you
have any good stories along these same lines, send them to RAH for
possible publication.  E-mail them to Dave Bealer at 1:261/1129
(FidoNet) or dave.bealer@rah.clark.net (Internet).              {RAH}

RAH Humor Review: The Liar
by Dave Bealer

Stephen Fry is best known as a comic actor.  He appeared as Melchitt
in the various "Blackadder" series and is half of the popular English
comedy team of Fry and Laurie.  As of 1991 Stephen Fry is also a
published novelist.  _The Liar_ was a #1 bestseller in England, but
hasn't done as well in North America, which is a bit of a shame.

One of the reasons for the book's failure over here is it's fairly
bawdy nature.  Even worse, most of the sex is homosexual in nature.
Much of England is still mired in the Victorian era as far as sex
is concerned.  Of course that puts them light-years ahead of the
United States, which is still saddled with the Puritans.

_The Liar_ follows the public school (an English euphemism for their
most exclusive private schools) and college career of Adrian Healey,
an upper middle class English youth who happens to be a pathological
liar.  Anyone who goes into this expecting a Jon Lovitz-like
treatment of the character type will be bitterly disappointed and
more than a little confused.  This is a thoroughly English novel,
full of English idioms.  Fry's use of language is reminiscent of
Oscar Wilde, and demonstrates yet again that a good English writer
will always sound "better," or at least more sophisticated, than a
writer of any other nationality who happens to be writing in English.

For those anglophiles who can handle it, this novel provides a biting
satirical look at several levels of English society as they existed
20 years ago.  From the meat markets of Piccadilly to Lord's Cricket
Ground, Adrian Healey gets around...or at least he claims to.

Book of the month: _Debt of Honor_ by Tom Clancy.  The master of the
techno-thriller is at it again.  Only Clancy could make a ten page
dissertation on the construction of automobile fuel tanks interest-
ing.  This book features the return of Jack Ryan to government
service, this time as the President's National Security Advisor.  The
theme is all out economic warfare and limited military action between
the United States and Japan.  Ryan keeps moving up the chain of
command in these novels.  Soon Ryan will be elected Pope and/or win
the WWF Heavyweight title.

electronically in the usual manner.  Your article may be selected for
publication in a planned "Best of RAH" electronic book.  If you want
your copyright notice to appear in your article, place it as desired
