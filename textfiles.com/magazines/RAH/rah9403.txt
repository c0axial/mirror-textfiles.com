Editorial - Potholes on the Information Highway
by Dave Bealer

The Clinton regime has offered the so-called Information Super-
highway as the solution to all of mankind's problems.  They may not
say it in so many words, but that's the implication.  "The
information superhighway will allow everyone to enjoy totally equal 
social and economic success through technology.  No one will ever be
poor, hungry, or sick again."  Right. 

The Pollyannas neglect the fact that real life always finds a way to
intrude into cyberspace.  Telephone and electric lines are downed by
storms and accidents; people still get hungry, tired, and are subject
to all the usual human needs and urges; routers are damaged by earth-
quakes.  

That's right, the Northridge, CA. earthquake caused an Internet
router to go offline for nearly a month.  This proves that more than
physical freeway overpasses can be collapsed by natural disasters.
While Los Angelenos searched for alternate routes around the wrecked
highways, commercial Internet customers in the U.S., including the
RAH support site, were unable to send Internet e-mail to certain
addresses in Europe.  Because of this outage, some of RAH's Internet
subscribers didn't receive the February issue until the middle of the
month. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to equate the magnitude of these
incidents.  Several people died in the freeway collapses.  Hundreds
of thousands more are facing a year or more of torturous detours and
nightmarish traffic jams while the roads are rebuilt.  OTOH, a few
humor magazines didn't get delivered on time because some router was
down.  Big deal, right?

Random Access Humor             Page  2                  March 1994

Late delivery of RAH is not that big a deal (except, possibly, to the
subscribers involved), but that router carries much more that a few
humor files.  We're talking *commercial* Internet customers here.
The RAH support site counts as one because we get our UUCP feed from
a commercial Internet host system.  It's unlikely that any ClarkNet
subscriber was seriously affected by this outage.  But what about the
companies that depend on Internet e-mail to conduct their business?

As mentioned last month, the commercialization of the Internet is a
touchy subject for many people.  The truth is that the Internet has
been, is, and will be commercialized.  It's inevitable.  What's not
inevitable is the level of commercialization that will take place.
It would be nice to think that we won't see advertising on every
World Wide Web screen one day like they have on Prodigy.

Conversely, the use of e-mail and online news/information delivery to
make firms more efficient and competitive is a *good* thing.  The
Internet gives scientists and technicians from around the world the
opportunity to work together to solve tough problems, such as curing
diseases and finding alternate energy sources (like the much-maligned
cold fusion).  Not all these people work for universities.

Given these realities, it seems inexcusable that a critical Internet
router was left unrepaired for nearly a month.  Reports indicate that
the router had not been destroyed or severely damaged, but was down
waiting for a part.  Unless the part had to be imported from Pluto,
this isn't good enough.

No lives were lost because of this outage, but given the way online
technology is developing, it isn't too big a logical leap to imagine
human lives actually depending on e-mail or other online technologies
some day.  For instance, crucial medical information could be delayed
during a future outage with disastrous results. 
                             - - -
On a ironic note, the day after the Northridge quake I noticed an ad
for a book entitled, _Earthquake Prepared: Securing Your Home,
Protecting Your Family_ by Joel Leach.  The book was published by
Studio 4 Productions, P.O. Box 280400, Northridge, CA. 91328-0400.
Looks like Studio 4 got a chance to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the book using their own offices.

Lettuce to the Editor

How about "Bumper Stickers From the 'Information Superhighway'",
instead of "Taglines Seen Around the Nets"?

Mark

Mark,

An excellent idea!  It has been implemented this month with a slight
modification.  The new heading will be: "Bumper Stickers Seen on the
Information Superhighway".  You will receive a free copy of _Command
Line Cowboys_ just as soon as you send us your snailmail address.
Thank you for helping to improve RAH!   Dave  

P.S. The idea of calling this segment of the magazine "Lettuce to the
Editor" rather than the mundane "Letters..." originally came from a
RAH reader.  Unfortunately I simply used the idea while forgetting to
recognize the author.  Even more unfortunately I have long since
forgotten who made the suggestion.  If that person is reading this,
you have my apologies.

 Subject: RAH's Logo and v1.1      

In popular response (and policy of Wild Bill T. Cat 
Software) to Random Access Humor Version 1 Release 1 
(Shortened to v1.1 here), we present another attempt to 
confuse the general public.  Please, Wild Bill T. Cat 
Software is not liable for any lack of common sense or 
sense of humor.

In October of 1993, the head of Wild Bill T. Cat Software, 
Kelly "Price STriker" Price received the (then) latest 
issue of RAH, read it, and submitted this entry (which is 
now the new RAH logo):

              ______       __       __  __          ______
             / __  /      /  \      \ \ \ \        / _\/_ \

         /_/   \_\    /_/      \_\      \_\ \_\     |____|

Now, at the end of the RAH initials, is NOT a exclamation mark, nor a
piping character.  It is a strait jacket, strait from Random Access
Humor. (If you have read or edited previous editions of RAH, you will
get the idea.) 

For those with EGA screens it is preferred that you view the 
logo at 25*43 text mode.  VGA owners please use 25*50.

If this has confused you even more, then our purpose is done here. 

If you have any questions, please E-Mail Kelly Price at the 
RAH Publication BBS at Fidonet (1:261/1129).  We get RAH directly.

 Thanks for the explanation. I was wondering what that figure was.
 At first I too thought it was an exclamation mark, and then I saw a
 papoose, and finally a scat pile.  But a straightjacket?  Naaaaah!  
 ....very fitting, but... wait... now I see a cerambycid (family of 
 beetle) larva.  Ah!  a Rorschach logo!  How deucedly clever!

Welcome to the FidoNet Winter Olympics
by Dave Bealer

The television networks couldn't wait four years for another great
Olympics marketing opportunity, so they're spacing them two years
apart now.  For those who have the BBS bug so bad that no CRT in
their home is without a connection to a computer and a modem, here
are some alternative events which will be taking place online.

5K Cross Posting
- Competitors race to post an annoying pyramid scheme message in all
  the echoes, newsgroups and conferences available on FidoNet boards.
  The total number of outraged, bandwidth wasting replies is taken
  into account.
  
Nodelist Flag Jumping
- trying to clear a blizzard of new nodelist flags.  Flags for the
  new terbo-charged water-cooled modems; flags to tell you about the 
  sysop: hair color; eye color; belly button - inney or outey?  Soon
  you will need a 120 MB hard disk just for the nodelist.

28.8K Bi-directional File Slinging
- competitors preserve their upload/download ratios by using a new
  bi-directional file transfer protocol to upload a few megabytes of
  old laundry lists while downloading the latest virtual reality game.

Rules Slalom
- the gold medalist in this event will be the first user to weave his
  way through the maze of access rules at his local FidoNet BBS.

Giant Rules Slalom
- the gold medalist in this event will be the first user to weave his
  way through the maze of state and local privacy and obscenity laws.
  Professionals (lawyers) are prohibited from competing.

Super G-Man
- competitors attempt to use secure public-key encryption on their
  messages without being busted by the Feds for making eavesdropping
  difficult.

Downhill
- where the maturity level of Fido is headed (and we're not talking
  physical age). 
  
Conference Moguls
- those wacky, wonderful moderators get their turn in the spotlight.
  Attacking and defending existing echoes is the name of the game.

Freestyle Aerials
- creative methods of gaining satellite access to cut echoes.

Know-It-All Combined
- a monumental gathering of the most opinionated 80% of FidoNet
  users -  the ones with about 5% of the net's total knowledge.

Random Access Humor             Page  6                  March 1994

Horse Hockey
- this stuff will be flying fast and furious in many of the echoes.

Speed Skating Around the Topic
- the gold medalists will cram the most off-topic material into
  their posts while not being tossed off the echo.

Figurative Skating
- The echoes will be thick with analogies in this contest.  None
  of the analogies will have the slightest thing to do with 
  the topic at hand - or the message's subject line.

Anyone who spends two weeks reading about these events on FidoNet
will see about as much actual sports footage as those who spent two
weeks watching the CBS coverage of the real Winter Olympics.    {RAH}

Quick & Very Dirty Install

Congratulations on choosing Non Compos Mentis Software's Software
2000.  We are sure that our Software 2000 is the finest software of
its kind.  To get started, use the distribution diskettes supplied
with this release and follow the instructions provided.  Happy
Computing!

1. Insert disk 1 in the drive, close the door and hit ENTER.

2. Insert disk 2 in the drive, and hit ENTER.

3. Because you didn't close the drive door, put disk 1 back in the
   drive, close the door, and hit ENTER twice.

4. Can't you read?  I said hit ENTER twice.  Put disk 2 in the drive,
   close the door, get up, walk around your chair in a clockwise
   direction once, then hit ENTER.

5. DID I SAY YOU COULD SIT BACK DOWN?  Wow, you are really going to
   make this hard on yourself.  Put disk 3 in the drive, close the
   door, walk across the room barefoot while reciting the alphabet
   backwards.  When you get back, I'll have something else for you.
   Now get going.

   OK, now sit down and type in the name of the character from
   Shakespeare that said, "Brevity is the soul of wit", and hit
   ENTER.

   Wrong, try again.

Random Access Humor             Page  7                  March 1994

   Wrong!  It was Polonius.  I really don't think you are qualified
   to use this software.  Wouldn't you rather be watching
   professional wrestling right now?  No?  OK, I have nowhere else to
   go, so let's try again, shall we?

   Put disk 1 in the drive, close the door and hit ENTER.

6. Wow, you actually did that right!  You surprised me!  Put disk 2
   in the drive, close the door, and hit F10.

7. I wish you had a Sound Blaster so you could hear me sigh.  I'll
   just overlook the fact that you hit ENTER instead of F10, you
   silly homo sapien.

   Hey, you cheap bastard, do you realize what kind of gyrations I
   have to go through because you only have a monochrome monitor?
   Spring for a VGA monitor will you?

   Put disk 3 in the drive, close the door, touch your nose with your
   lower lip, and without uttering any expletives hit the ENTER
   key.

8. No, that wasn't an expletive but you also couldn't say that on
   television unless you are Howard Stern.

   If you are not Howard Stern, write a letter to your mother with
   that word in it.  When you are finished writing your letter (I'll
   wait) put disk 4 in the drive, close the door, and hit ENTER.

   If you are Howard Stern, you don't need to write a letter to your
   mother with that word in it - she is familiar with that word by
   now.  By the way, keep up the good work and I'll let you in on a 
   little secret: the software is all contained on the first disk and
   has already been successfully installed, so you can stop now.  I just
   put the bozos through this drill because it gives hundreds of lower 
   paid workers a good laugh.

9. There were 4 spelling mistakes in the letter to your mother.
   Correct them before you mail it, but I don't have the patience to
   wait for you to find them.  Put disk 2 in the drive, close the
   door and type "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" with
   your nose before hitting ENTER.

10. That took a while, but congratulations!  You have passed a test
    that took the ape creatures of the Indus less time to complete.
    Next time get an 8 year old to help you.  God knows how you are
    going to actually run this software.  What am I saying?  You
    are only going to start the software once anyway - it's not a
    game!                                                       {RAH}

Grammar in the Machine
By: Vincent B. Navarino

*** FLASH! *** This just in:

There's an extremely tense and unusual drama unfolding today in
downtown New York.  It seems a distraught woman is holding a group of
high school students hostage at a McDonald's restaurant. 

Earlier this morning  Ms. Elley Norman, a well-respected English
teacher at St. Hartman High School, walked into the establishment
wielding a large (and extremely heavy) Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary and an American made Daisy air rifle.  Swinging wildly,
she forced all of the customers, except for 12 high school students,
out of the building.  It has been reported that all of the teens are
part of their school's computer club.

The police arrived shortly at the scene, along with LAPD's esteemed
SWAT team (which immediately began to pump rounds into the crowd at 
random).  Ms. Norman sent out the dictionary-whipped, but otherwise
unharmed manager with a note.  It then became clear that Ms. Norman
was upset at the dwindling reading level of high school students that
used computers.  The final straw seemed to have occurred when she
logged onto a local BBS and began reading teen-agers' posts there.
Rumor has it that she snapped and went insane due to the poor use of
grammar and punctuation that comprised the bulk of their messages.

The note said that she was holding the children hostage until they
learned to "properly implement, understand and comprehend the use of
the English language."

Police are prepared for a long siege.

Hostage negotiators repeatedly attempted to communicate with Ms.
Norman to end the situation only to put off by her well worded, but
menacing replies. 

Said Capt. Lou Phillips of the LAPD Hostage Negotiation Squad in a
written statement to this newscaster:

      "It seems Ms. Norman, upset at the lack of english
       articulation skill amongst high school students,
       took it upon herself to set things to right and
       force kids to learn how to properly use and respect
       the english language before they dared touch a
       computer."

When asked his opinion of the situation at the scene, Capt. Phillips
responded, "Hey, I tink she's a &^%! loon.  But if dat broad hoits
one of dem kids, who knows what?!" 

After pressing him about his response, Capt. Phillips admitted to
using Grammatik's IV grammar checker for all written statements.

Random Access Humor             Page  9                  March 1994

Rumor has it that McDonald's has offered to pay all college tuition
for any of the hostages, when released, that choose to pursue English
degrees upon graduating high school. 

We'll keep you all posted as to the outcome of this surprising and
startling event.  And now to Bill for the weather . . .         {RAH}

Digital Addiction
by Tom Fasulo

Sure, I did computer games.  Hey, most of my generation did!  But I
was always in control.  Not like some others.  Anyway, the hand-and-
eye coordination games bored me.  And I quickly lost interest in the
kind of games where you try to get the hero off the Earth before the
Vogons destroyed it.  I mean I could take them or leave them. Like I
just did them, you know, to be in.

Well, there was one game I kinda had a problem with. It's called
Solitile, a kind of mahjong.  I'd do two or three games of it a day.
But it only had a few variations in layouts.  After awhile it also
got boring.  Even when I'd win, the rush wasn't there anymore.  So I
stopped. 

Things were going real well for me. I had a nice house, a good job
with the university, and a dog that loved me.  When I'd come home at
nights we'd go for long walks and talk about software upgrades. 

Then one day Greg "The SySop," a local game pusher, turned me on to
Mjvga.  It was like another kind of mahjong.  Sure, it only had one
layout, but there were *thirty* different tile sets!  And it kept
track of your winning scores too, man.  "The SySop" even told me I  
could even try it out for free as it was shareware.  So I did.  No 
problem, right?  Like I said, I was always in control before.

At first I'd only do it at home, and it was great!.  I had never done
a game like this before.  Soon I couldn't wait to get home and do a
couple of sets before dinner.  And after dinner too!  Before long I 
stopped taking my dog on walks as I was doing Mjvga all the time at
home.  He'd sit out on the porch and wonder where I was, but I didn't
care.  I'd stay up late too.  After awhile the people at the office 
noticed how tired I was, the circles under my eyes, and the dazed
look I had.  They asked me if there was anything wrong, but I told
them to mind their own business.  And Mjvga wasn't free anymore!  I
had to pay the registration fee as I was using it all the time now.
But it was worth it for the good feeling it gave me.

Random Access Humor             Page 10                  March 1994

Then I even started doing Mjvga at the office.  I'd shut the door and
do a couple sets of tiles to unwind.  Then I was doing sets of tiles
most of the day. I wasn't getting any work done.  Things were out of
control.  I was in trouble! 

Then my dog had a long talk with me.  I broke down and told him
everything.  He said he'd help me through the withdrawal and give me
the support I needed.  So I deleted Mjvga on my computer at home, but
like most addicts I cheated.  I zipped it up on my computer at the 
office and kept it hidden in an out-of-the-way subdirectory.

Anyway, I didn't do tiles anymore.  My dog and I went for long walks
again.  Things got better at work too.  I started getting papers
accepted by national journals and conferences.  Grant money started 
coming in.  Life was good again.

Then one weekend I visited some friends down state.  I thought the
guy and his wife were straight, but it turned out they were heavy in
Mjvga.  They had *one hundred* and *twenty-seven* different tile
sets.  So just to be sociable I tried a couple of the sets.  After
all, it was only for the weekend.  Soon I'd return to my normal
routine.  Sure man!  Sure!  When I went home, I took the 127 tile
sets with me. 

Now I'm into Mjvga heavier then ever.  I do it at home and at work.
Seems all I ever do is think about my next set of tiles.  And my dog
is stuck on the back porch again.  To sort of justify what I do, I 
even uploaded all the tile sets to the local BBSs.  I figured that if
others were doing it then maybe I wasn't doing anything wrong.  Now
other people are hooked because of me.

Because I'm a distributor now I'm getting the kind of attention I
don't want.  I think the computer game police have my modem tapped. 
And the last few days there's been someone in a car across the street
watching my house.  Oh, God! I need help.

God?  God?  Hey, wait a minute!  Mjvga has several tile sets with a
religious theme.  Praise the Lord! 

So, come brethren!  Come to my house next Sunday and worship with
Pastor Tom at the First Church of the Holy Tiles.  And bring a mouse.
Saint Mjvga requires it.                                        {RAH}

You Only Live A Bunch Of Times: The Return of Goldfinger

by James Bond as told to Robert Hankins

I was attending a jolly gala some weeks ago in Newcastle at the
elegant home of Lord Dumpy Rothchild, the Earl of Oversized Shirts.
I was having a particularly keen time drinking my usual vodka-martini
when I glanced toward the main entrance way.  There before me stood
the curious chap known as Goldfinger.  

Although he was much older now, I knew it was he --- for they'd given
him one of those party name tags to wear which read "Goldfinger" on
it.  He and I had a bit of a row some years ago when he tried to
steal all the gold in Fort Knox.  Last I saw of the bloke he was
being sucked out the window of a DC-9.  As I approached a red-head, I
called to Goldfinger. "Hello old boy, nice to see you".  

The cherubic face responded with a thick German accent. "Vhy Mister
Bond, vhat a surprize!  Perhaps later vee can play charades, or maybe
Trivial Pursuit, eh?  Ha ha."  

The red-head's name was Elizabeth Stevens, but her friends called her
Pasha, an obscure term denoting a former high-ranking official in
Turkey.  The number to which we danced was a lively mambo which
lasted several minutes.  When it was over, I was missing my expensive
wrist-watch made exclusively for me by the Bentley-Welles Company of
Rumpton, and my solid gold cigarette case manufactured for me by
Brunhill of Davidshire.  I could only conclude they had fallen off my
person during the fray on the dance floor.

My suspicions began to fall on Auric Goldfinger, for he more than
anyone else in the room had a reputation for craving gold.  I sought
out the German madman over by the punch bowl.  "Alright Goldfinger,
you stole my watch and cigarette case.  Let's have them back!"  

He produced the items from his coat pocket.  "Vhy Mister Bond, STEAL
is such a strong word!  I merely found zeese things on zah dance
floor, obviously lost by some unfortunate person."  

"They're mine and you know it," I said.  

Goldfinger paused to immerse a Frito in some Ranch Dip, then replied,
"I do not see your name on zem, Mister Bond.  Ha Ha Ha."  Goldfinger
was right.  He'd beaten me and he knew it.  

"One question Goldfinger: Why?" I asked.  

"I've lost all my money and can longer do things as in zah old days,
ya?  Like vhen I could strap you to a table and threaten you wit a
giant laser beam?  I did it for all zah evil geniuses zat have given
up on dominating zah vorld because of you, like zah pitiful Dr. No,
who changed his name to Dr. Goldstein and now has a small practice in
Vermont, or zah once evil Blofeld whose passion for cats led him to
open a pet store in Kansas City." 

Random Access Humor             Page 12                  March 1994

"Well," I said, "you might as well know something about the watch,
old chum.  Even though it claims to be water resistant, what that
means is, you can get it a LITTLE wet, but don't go swimming with it
or anything like that." 
    
Goldfinger stared at the watch. "Vhere does it say zis about being
vater resistant?"  

"Look closer," I said, and as Goldfinger put the watch to his face I
pressed a special button in my right pocket, releasing a cloud of
tear gas into the gold-monger's eyes.  Goldfinger's head hit the
table and a large tray of smoked meats fell on him.  "Honestly
Goldfinger, you're such a ham," I said.  This was my cute 'throw away
line' that I always think of after dangerous situations have been
resolved.  

Pasha came to my side and said, "Oh James, you're so witty."  

I thought about letting the washed-up fiend keep the cigarette case;
after all, I was half to blame for losing it and could have easily
procured a new one for free, one of the many perks I get by serving
Her Majesty.  But the old bean had tried to kill me several times in
the past(once by handcuffing me to an atomic bomb!), and when someone
crosses that line your relationship with them changes drastically.
As Pasha and I were leaving the party, Goldfinger shouted the usual,
you know, how I hadn't seen the last of him and that he'd return
someday.  Bloody strange chap don't you think?                  {RAH}

The Great Mall
by Ray Koziel

"We are now in orbit sir, and the probe droids are being dispatched."

"Ah, good!  Just look at this planet!  See how beautiful it is?  The
green and blue colors and so appealing to the eye.  The land masses
are not very pleasing though, but that can be fixed.  What do you
think, my good man?" 

"Well sir, I have to agree that this is one of the more nicer planets
I've seen.  But I feel it is a bit out of the way to construct a
mall." 

"Oh you just sound like everybody else!  I didn't become Director of
Malls on our home planet of Quintanz for nothing!  Ever since I did
my first project - the Supermall on Vantagantas IV - I knew that I
had a certain talent for this type of thing!  Now I am ready to do my
most excellent work of all - the Ultramegamall!  But I must find a
planet worthy to build such a mall.  I am sure such a planet exists
in this system.  The first one is so darn close to the sun that the
customers will be sunburnt before they are even half done with their

Random Access Humor             Page 13                  March 1994

shopping.  The second is so overcast and gloomy no one will have the
urge to shop.  But here...here is a pure jewel, tucked away only to
be discovered by me!" 

"Ummm...sir, the probes are reporting back with their observations."

"Good!  Good!  Quick, my good man, what have they found?"

"The probes report that this planet is quite suitable for life and
already has a number of lifeforms available."

"Excellent!  They will make some good attractions, I'm sure!"

"The predominant life form is quite similar to our own and call
themselves 'human'.  These humans refer to this planet as "Earth".

"Sounding better all the time!  Sounds like there are already
potential shoppers available to us!"

"Planet composition is about 75% water, 25% land.  A substantial
portion of the landmasses contain mall-type structures."

"WHAT!?  Malls already exist on this planet!?  This beautiful planet
is blemished by the existence of inferior malls!  How dreadful!  This
will not do!  Oh how I hoped this would be the perfect planet.  Oh
well, never mind.  Come!  Let us check out that little red planet
over there!  I'm positive that one will work out!"              {RAH}

The Dynamically Translated Address
(translated by Dave Bealer)

Four TORS and seven Queries ago our programmers brought forth on this
mainframe a new program, conceived in COBOL, and dedicated to the
transaction that all users should be serviced equally. 

Now we are engaged in a great regression, testing whether that
program or any program so compiled and so debugged can long process.
We are met on a great SYSUDUMP of that regression.  We have come to
dedicate a portion of that listing, as a final resting place for
those who gave their sanity that that program might run.  It is
altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger partition, we cannot wait, we cannot process, we
cannot swap this address space.  These brave transactions, running
and suspended, who struggled here, have processed it, far beyond our
poor  instruction to add or subtract.  The system log will little
note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never abend what
they did here.  It is for us, the raving, rather, to be committed to
an institution while they who watched us are nobly promoted to

Random Access Humor             Page 14                  March 1994

management.  It is rather for us to be here dispatched to the active
task remaining in the queue - that from these suspended tasks we take
increased CPU cycles for that task for which they gave the last full
page of real storage - that we here highly resolve that these
suspended shall not have swapped in vain - that this program, under
MVS, shall have a new burst of throughput - and that applications of
the region, by the region, and for the region, shall not abend from
the system.

Announcements and Observations

Sorry, no Twit Filter or RAH Humor Review this month.  I was too busy
trying to watch the Winter Olympics.  Unfortunately the American
television "journalists" were too busy covering the latest
developments in Full Contact Figure Skating to show much actual
Olympic footage.

Although the vikings have been most well known for their highly
successful "away games" during the First Millennium, the 1994 Winter
Olympians found them to be just as tough when playing at home.

waves from his countrymen when making his final attempt at Olympic

users cannot access the original binary archive file may offer it for

modified.  Readers may produce hard copies of RAH or backup copies on
diskette for their own personal use only.  RAH may not be distributed
in combination with any other publication or product.

Internet users may obtain RAH back issues as UUENCODED files attached
to e-mail.  Free subscriptions are also available via mailing lists.

RAH is also available on the Internet via FTP:

         (ASCII Text edition compressed with gzip)

  ftp.clark.net  (198.17.243.2)  dir: /ftp/pub/rah
         (ASCII Text edition uncompressed - RAHyymm.TXT)

         (READROOM.TOC edition compressed with ZIP - RAHyymmR.ZIP)

                     >> Writing For RAH <<

Article contributions to RAH are always welcome.  All submissions
must be made electronically.  File attach your article to a netmail
message to Dave Bealer at 1:261/1129.  E-mail (with file attaches)
may also be sent via Internet to: dave.bealer@rah.clark.net

Tagline and filler submissions may be made via e-mail.  Article
submissions should be made via file.  Submitted files must be plain
ASCII text files in normal MS-DOS file format: artname.RAH; where
artname is a descriptive file name and RAH is the mandatory 
extension.  If your article does not conform to these simple specs,
it may get lost or trashed.  Also note that such imaginative names as
RAH.RAH might get overlaid by the blatherings of similarly minded
contributors.  If your hardware is incapable of producing file names
in the proper format, you may send your article as one or more e-mail
messages.  As the volume of mail increases it may not be possible to
make personalized responses to all submissions or correspondence
received. 

The editors reserve the right to publish or not to publish any
submission as/when they see fit.  The editors also reserve the right
to "edit", or modify any submission prior to publication.  This last
right will rarely be used, typically only to correct spelling or
grammar misteaks that are not funny.  RAH is a PG rated publication,
so keep it (mostly) clean.

RAH can accept only the following types of material for publication:
1) Any material in the public domain.
2) Material for which you own the copyright, or represent the copy-
   right holder.  If you wrote it yourself, you are automatically the
   copyright holder.

In writing jargon, RAH is deemed to be given "One Time Rights" to
anything submitted for publication unless otherwise noted in the
message accompanying the contribution.  You still own the material,
and RAH will make no use of the material other than publishing it
electronically in the usual manner.  Your article may be selected for
publication in a planned "Best of RAH" electronic book.  If you want
your copyright notice to appear in your article, place it as desired
in the text you submit.  Previously published articles may be
submitted, but proper acknowledgement must be included: periodical
name, date of previous publication.
