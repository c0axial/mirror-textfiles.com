Editorial - Online Chat: For the Birds?
by Dave Bealer

I'm hardly the most efficient person in the world.  Greg Borek has
commented that most RAH readers would flip if they saw the stunningly
messy conditions under which RAH is produced and distributed.  The
utter chaos that reigns in my little loft office (and, indeed, the
rest of my home) serves to cancel out any innate sense of efficiency
I might possess.  The fact that I'm a natural born slob doesn't help
matters. 

Despite all this, there are a few things even I consider too time-
wasting and inefficient.  Online chat is one of them.  Don't get me
wrong, I don't object to anyone engaging in online chat so long as
I'm not expected to participate.

I've never been a big conversationalist on the telephone, either.  I
don't have a problem using the telephone, which is good since it's
tough to live in modern society without using the silly things.  But
I've always preferred talking to a person face to face or engaging in
written communication.  OTOH, when you need to talk to someone who is
hundreds or thousands of miles away, using the telephone is much more
efficient that travelling to where the other person is located.

What's the difference between hardcopy or e-mail communication and
online chat, you may ask?  The difference is that with the first two,
I'm not forced to sit at my computer watching my correspondent type
the message.  Many people fail to realize that watching someone write
is about the most boring activity in the world.  No matter how vivid
or exciting the end product will be, observing the actual writing
process is tedium personified.

Random Access Humor             Page  2                  April 1994

Another bonus with online chat is that I've often made a long
distance call to dial into the system where the chat is taking place.
Thus I get to fill up the idle seconds when the other person is
writing a thoughtful reply to worry about how large my phone bill will
be next month.  (Did I mention that I'm a *cheap* slob?)

These factors may help explain why I turned off the "page sysop"
function on my BBS over a year ago.  They also serve to explain why I
never answer pages from other users on systems I call.  When the
sysop breaks in for a chat, there's little I can do about it short of
hanging up.  Since even I'm not usually that rude, I simply beg out
of the conversation as quickly as possible.

So if you ever see me logged on a BBS or online system don't page me.
If you do page me and there is no response, please don't take it
personally.  I don't do online chat.
                            - - -
It recently came to my attention that there's at least one person in
Palmetto, Florida with *way* too much time on his hands.  Wayne
Downing uploaded a couple of RAH-related programs he wrote.  

TAGS.EXE contains all the taglines published in RAH from 09/92 thru
03/94 and will display a randomly selected group of them on request.
The user gets to determine how many taglines will be displayed.  The
only drawback is that you have to enter the desired number of
taglines in response to a prompt - there's no way to supply the
number as a command-line parameter.  This limits the usefulness of
the program in a batch file environment.

INDEX.EXE contains an index of all RAH articles from 09/92 thru
03/94 (a promised future version have a self-expanding index).  If
you place the ASCII text edition of all the RAH issues in the same
directory with INDEX, the program will allow you to read the articles
as well.  

Both programs are available for download/file request from The
Puffin's Nest BBS (1:261/1129) in file area RAH.  Filename:
WDUTIL10.ZIP.  These programs require MS-DOS.  This goes to prove
that at least some of you out there take RAH much more seriously than
I do.                                                           {RAH}

Lettuce to the Editor

Dear Deranged Editor:

I'm afraid I will be unable to read your fine publication for a
while.  I am going on a long trip to Haiti.  You may wonder why I'm
going there on such short notice.

I'm off to the abode of my parental units.  My dad's IDE controller
bought the farm, and I heard them performing voodoo rights over the
embalmed carcass of the tower case.

Random Access Humor             Page  3                  April 1994

I need to go over there and fix it before they try stuffing chicken
feathers into the floppy drives or pouring goats' blood into the
power supply.  God only knows what they would do if it had been a
boot sector virus instead!  Still, if they bury it before I get
there, I'm afraid it might be beyond repair even if the coffin is
air-tight. 

Wish me luck!

Sincerely,
A Faithful Reader

The Incredible Shrinking Data Center
by Dave Bealer

Just three decades ago monsters ruled the data center.  No, not the
managers, although many of them had certain monstrous properties. 
This was the era of the mainframes, near the end of the Big Iron Age.
A single computer filled a good sized room, and programs ran one at a
time, which was good enough for everyone.

A decade later the giant mainframe was still king, although this
Jurassic Iron was being challenged by upstarts with the wimpy title
of "mini-computer."  Since even the name was non-threatening, the
mainframe mavens ignored the minis.  Properly written programs could
execute simultaneously, which increased throughput, while poorly
written programs would crash the system.  A small price to pay for
progress. 

Just over 10 years ago the tiny personal computer (PC) escaped the
grasp of the hobbyists and invaded the sanctity of the corporate
computing environment.  A laughable new toy, the personal computer
would obviously never be a threat.  There wasn't even a good COBOL
compiler available for the PC, so how could it ever hope to run
"serious" applications?

Random Access Humor             Page  4                  April 1994

Once it became apparent, even to the least observant EDP types, that
people really *were* using PCs to do serious work, the real question
became how to exert complete control over their use.  End users could
never be trusted with an important decision such as how to use the
company's precious computing resources.  Only highly trained (and
paid) data processing professionals were qualified to decide these
things.

The last decade has brought some amazing size reductions in the
"foot print" of computer hardware.  Mainframes are now little larger
than the mini-computers of old.  Mini-computers themselves have been
largely squeezed out by competition from super-powered PCs and
workstations.  Portable computers are now available that place all
the power of a mighty desktop machine in the palm of your hand.

Despite these "advances," all is not lost for the professionals.
Nearly everyone wants to use data that only exists on another PC.
The logical solution is to "network" all the PCs in a department/
company together.  Local Area Networks (LANs) allow this data
sharing, but introduce many of the same complexities that made
mainframes so difficult to master.  As the needs of the flock change,
so too do the mysteries guarded by the high-tech priests of EDP.

In the old days there was a terminal on every desk connected to a
multi-million dollar mainframe.  Today the custom is to have a modest
"workstation" PC on every desk connected to a large, well equipped,
$10,000 "server" PC.  Much of the overall processing power is distri-
buted to the individual desktop.  Users remain happy as long as all
the game software they bring from home runs on their "work"station.
Even more money is saved by the fact that most network servers fit in
a closet, rather than requiring an large air-conditioned room with
raised flooring.

Many empty raised-flooring computer rooms are being converted into 
drafty office space and miniature golf courses (no joke - this author
once helped design and build such a course).  Even worse, computers
no longer need a desk to call home.  Engineers can compute critical
product specs on a laptop while wolfing down styro-burgers at their
favorite fast food joint.  Accountants can embezzle funds from the
privacy of their own cars using cellular modems.  The next generation
of Cray super computers will fit in a backpack, finally allowing
scientists this same kind of mobility.

One major benefit of all this downsizing is the reduced energy needs
of a closet-sized computer center as opposed to a city-block sized
center.  Some of these savings will be lost to the fact that every-
body, including the janitor, will soon have their own Pentium-
equipped PC.  Also a problem are misguided folks who leave the PC
turned on 24 hours a day in an effort to keep the hard disk from
wearing out.  They ignore the fact that the average new 528 MB hard
disk will be outgrown and replaced with a 16GB drive long before it
wears out.  This is called planned obsolescence through increasingly
bloated software.                                               {RAH}

In Search of Ancient Comedians
by Erich von Daniken  (a.k.a. Robert Hankins)

On an island in the South Pacific known as Easter Island, the
remnants of the first civilization are the giant gods carved in rock
and stone.  Strolling among these huge pagan objects, one can only
think of a race long dead and so totally separated from us by time,
it is though they never existed.  But if these so-called "giant god
formations" are viewed from the air, they take on a new meaning.  One
of the gods, it appears, has slipped on a banana peel, and the other
gods seem to be laughing at him.  Shortly before his death, comedian
Stan Laurel was interviewed by Richard Perkins.  When asked about the
famous "banana routine" of Laurel and Hardy which inspired director
David Lean and countless others, Laurel said he had once seen it
happen to a milkman in York, then nervously tried to change the
subject.  When Perkins pressured him about it, Laurel said, "I can
neither deny nor confirm the routine's origin as being that of the
rock formations on Easter Island, but I understand it is a very old
joke."  He needn't have said more, the answer was crystal clear.
What is not clear is how the pagans of Easter Island could have
conceived of such a sophisticated "bit" during their time.  Could it
be they were given such knowledge by ancient visitors from the
heavens, who not only possessed physical knowledge of space travel
but also a keen sense of humor?

In the year 312, shortly before their victory at the Battle of
Milvian Bridge, Constantine The Great's troops were camping one
night.  Late into the evening a stranger approached and began to tell
the men a fantastic tale about a nomadic seller of wares who was
without lodging.  The nomad found refuge with a local peasant who
told him, "We've no guest room, so you can sleep in my daughter's bed
--- but be warned, you must resist her charms lest you will surely
die."  When the morning came, the nomad informed the peasant that he

Random Access Humor             Page  6                  April 1994

gave in to temptation and had his way with the girl.  As a penance,
he granted the peasant his belongings, including all of his wares and
both of his oxen.  When the nomad was gone, the daughter emerged from
her room.  "How'd we do this time?" she asked.  The peasant replied,
"Well, if we sell only the oxen, I figure we won't need jobs for the
next fifteen years!"  Constantine's army went into an uproar, and
there was much rejoicing and mirth.  They invited the stranger to
partake of food and drink with them, and he continued his fabulous
stories, such as the fable about the fat man who sat "around the
house."  Constantine was so impressed that he asked the stranger to
join them and become their master story-teller.  "I cannot," he
replied.  "My work here is done.  Now I must travel due west to see a
man about a goat."  And with that he vanished into the night.

Even the skeptical have to give a nod to the cave drawings at
Altamira, Spain.  There on the underground walls, our Cro-Magnon
ancestors rendered images of herds of bison, mammoths, and evidence
of early practical jokes.  In one famous scene, one man is bending to
sit in a chair when it is pulled out from under him by a second man.
The first man then retaliates by throwing a pie at the second man,
but the second man ducks and the pie hits a third man, not the
intended victim.  Another scene shows a man tying a sleeping man's 
shoe laces together.  When matches came along the shoe lace bit was
dropped entirely in favor of the more popular "hot-foot".  Of course,
we can only interpret these drawings, which are at best, primitive
stick figures.  One controversial scene in the Lascaux cave in France
shows two men who are apparently shaking hands.  We think that either
the man on the right is asking the man on the left to "pull his
finger", or that the man on the left is the victim of one of the
first crudely built "joy-buzzers" of the time: a primitive rubber
band with a sharp thorn tied around it, easily concealed in a
prankster's palm.  Sometimes these ancient joy buzzers could be
lethal when the stinger of an asp was used in place of an ordinary
thorn.  This may be how Cleopatra died.   

Wiltshire, England is the home of Stonehenge, which scientists have
traced back to 1845 B.C.  It took hundreds of workers to arrange
these huge stones which can barely be lifted by the most modern
equipment --- all to create what many believe to be a giant celestial
calendar.  Considering all of its splendor it is still rather
primitive: if you needed to remember an important dinner party or
mark your grandmother's birthday, you couldn't just check it off or
draw a circle around the number like we can on today's calendars.  In
1948 Henry Childs compiled all available information on Stonehenge,
then fed it into the giant LUMMOX computer in Riverside, Iowa.  After
deciphering the statistics for eighty three hours and seventeen
minutes, the machine spit out a single card with holes punched in it.
It read "Take my spouse, I implore you!" followed by a rim-shot.

If Computer Nerds Controlled Network Programming
by Robert S. Coats
  
Gilligan's Island:
  
The Professor finds some rare binary coconuts that can be used to
upgrade the ROM in his bamboo clone modem to support X.25.  After
hours of effort, he manages to establish a connection via his papaya-
based VT 100 terminal and satellite uplink with Telenet, but falls
asleep from exhaustion.  Gilligan walks up and types "+++" then "ATH"
and drops the line. The Skipper beans him with a rock and finally
loses it, his seafaring years catch up with him and he starts making
lewd remarks about playing Leisure Suit Larry IV with Mary Ann.
Meanwhile, Mr. Howell finally figures out how to work the ISDN set
that was accidentally dropped by a passing JAL jet and has a heart
attack when he hears via Dow Jones News Retrieval that the stock 
market has soared above 3000 points.  Ginger calls CompuServe and
emails some software developers in an effort to convince them that
she should would be a good model for MacStripPoker 2.0.  Eventually,
all connectivity on the island is lost, when Gilligan discovers an
actor in a bad gorilla costume has shorted pins 2&3 on the serial
cable, and everybody on the island has just been echoing characters
to each other.
  
Beverly Hillbillies

Miss Jane tries to convince Mr. Drysdale to network all the PCs in
the bank, but, typically, he won't spend the money.  Frustrated, Miss
Jane pleads with Jed Clampett to persuade Mr. Drysdale to "put in the 
LAN," but Jed thinks she said "put in the ham."  Jed then gets Granny
to cook up a dozen hams and has Jethro and Ellie Mae bring them to
the bank.  When they arrive, everybody is out to lunch, so Jethro
begins to distribute the hams, but is frustrated when he can't get
the coaxial cable to stay attached to the ham bone.  To further
complicate matters, Ellie May has brought along her pet goats, which
begin to eat the ham and cable, causing the the VAX to short out and
force an emergency electronic fund transfer of the Clampett millions
to a competitive bank.  As Mr. Drysdale is seen chasing Miss Jane
down the hall with a crazed look in his eye, swinging a ham at her,
Jed is heard to remark, "Weee- doggie!  Why look at that Granny.  Mr.
Drysdale is so happy about whut we done, he's gonna give Miss Jane
her own ham!"
  
The Brady Bunch
  
Peter uses Qmodem to dial into the high school computer and, through
hacking tricks picked up from a local "adults only" BBS, is able to
access individual student's "permanent records." He scans through the
listings, then, using a clever keyboard macro, alters his completed
courses such that he won't be required to take English Lit again.
Unfortunately, Jan is working in the school office at the time and is
alerted to the invasion by a diligent anti-viral TSR.  She is then
tormented with having to decide to do the "right thing" or be loyal

Random Access Humor             Page  8                  April 1994

to her brother.  Jan goes home and talks to Alice, who says she
should analyze all the factors and then decide after using the new
artificial intelligence software Mr. Brady has recently installed on
his '386 laptop.  Jan tries to use the program, but instead
accidentally deletes all the files in the Harvard Graphics directory,
leaving Mr. Brady to blow a presentation the next day.  Mrs. Brady
finds out via Jan what happened, and forces Peter to write "I will
not hack into the school computer" 5000 times with EDLIN while the
rest of the family eats angel food cake on the patio.
  
The Mary Tyler Moore Show
  
Mr. Grant tells Mary to come up with some hard facts about all the
activity out in Silicon Valley.  Mary grabs her Macintosh Powerbook
and jumps on a plane west.  Unfortunately, she leaves the Mac
switched on and, due to an undiscovered bug in the latest release of
System and Finder, the hard disk continually optimizes itself when no
keyboard input is recorded for more than five minutes.  Needless to
say, she has a dead Mac when arriving and spends the next few hours
trying to find a replacement.  Meanwhile, Ted begins his broadcast
and notes that "We expected to have some good information about
Silicon Valley for this broadcast, but somebody had to take a Mac and
not a reliable laptop PC!"  Frantic, Mary calls long distance over
crystalline fiber optic lines to get help from Rhoda, who doesn't
answer the phone because she is playing Bomber and has the headphones
on.  However, Phyllis's snotty daughter is around and answers.  She
listens to Mary whine, then hangs up the phone.  Mary is last seen
violently flinging the Mac out a speeding taxi window while crossing
the Bay Bridge.                                                 {RAH}

Roadkill on the Information Highway
by Ray Koziel

It seems like wherever you turn lately one of the key topics is the
information highway.  Even this fine publication focused on the
information highway in the March issue's editorial section.  In light
of all this I find myself with a case of "information highway
overload" and looking for the nearest rest stop.  Now don't get me
wrong; I'm not saying that this is a bad thing.  On the contrary, I
feel the evolution of our current networks, such as Internet, into a
more unified, standardized "infostructure" is vital for our country's
future.  What does bother me are certain issues that exist but are,
in my opinion, hidden by all the hype and hoopla. 

The first of these is the fact that this is being called a "highway."
I don't know about anybody else, but when I think of highways I think
of traffic jams, idiotic drivers, tolls, and some other items which
do not convey positive images.  Also, highways make me think of our
current infrastructure, which happens to be in pretty bad shape.

Random Access Humor             Page  9                  April 1994

Besides, "highway" is such an outdated (for lack of a better word)
term anyway, especially when used to characterize a computer network.
This is the 90s after all and I am sure a better term can be found or
made up, something like "Meganetwork" or "Dataway."

This leads to the next item of discontent.  Even though it is called
an "information highway", what will actually be flowing through those
marvelous little fiber optic cables is pure data.  Data becomes
information at the personal level when someone processes the data and
finds some use in it or adds it to his or her knowledge base.  Now on
the economic spectrum I am a subscriber to the "supply side" theory
of economics, or supply creating its own demand.  However, when it
comes to the information highway, I am afraid this may not be true.
I mean, how many channels of Julia Child and Bob Villa do we need?  I
don't see how it can be called an information highway if this
information is repetitive, redundant, or not informative at all but
just plain noise.  Besides, there is talk about many types of
services such as movies on demand, travel, finance, and others which
do not really fall in the genre of information but are going to be
riding the information highway anyway.  Thus it may be necessary to
make another term to incapsulate this "merger" of information and
entertainment.  This is the English language, after all, and it is
quite adaptable and capable of coming up with some snappy terms,
something like "Infotainment."

Last but certainly not least is what is the toll going to be for
riding this highway?  Cable, telephone and related companies want to
keep the costs down as much as possible to remain competitive but
they need to make a profit as well.  Some people are lucky to afford
electricity and, at most, cable.  We already have the so-called
"health care crisis" and "welfare crisis," so maybe our wonderful
politicians will declare an "information crisis."  Won't that be fun?

In summary, I am not trying to roadblock the information highway.  As
I said in the beginning, it is necessary for the country as economy, 
society, and politics become more and more global.  But, there are
some things to be considered but have been hidden by the flash and
dazzle of what it is going to provide.  So you may ride the informa-
tion highway but I'll stick to my infotainment meganetwork.     {RAH}

The Q&A Man from PC-Computing Goes Insane
By: Vincent B. Navarino

I always wondered what would happen if one of the Q&A guys from
PC-Computing or other computer magazines snapped after answering too
many of other people's silly PC questions (and they printed it).  So,
with that in mind . . . read on.

Q&A - With Bill "Had it up to Here" Louie

Random Access Humor             Page 10                  April 1994

Q: I am trying to get a venerable original 4.77Mhz
IBM PC to accept a 1.44 floppy.  Can you help?

A: Yes.  Simply get a 1.44 floppy controller that
has an on-board BIOS chip.  The chip will override
your PC's addled brains, fooling it to think it's
worthy enough to run such equipment.


Q: I have a 386SX with 1 meg of RAM and I keep
getting 'Insufficient memory' messages from
Windows.  What can I do?

A: Keep adding more RAM.  Eventually the message
will stop, or you'll run out of money.


Q: I am running a program on an IBM 386DX/40 and
it keeps asking me to "Hit any key to continue."
Which key is the *ANY* key?

A: To locate the any key, you must first get
inside your computer.  Remove the screws on your
computer's case and open the cover.  Look inside.
See the big green board with circuits all over it?
Notice the little grey square that says
AMD-386DX40?  Using a magnetized screwdriver,  pry
the chip out of it's plastic holder.  It's under
there.


Q:What is the best way to optimize my config.sys
and autoexec.bat files?

A: At the C:> prompt, type DEL *.*


Q: What is the easiest way to convert my venerable
AT to a 486?

A: Remove the old 286 chip from the motherboard
and put the 486 chip in it's place.  It may look
to you that it won't fit, but with a large enough
hammer, it should.


Q: Do you know a program I can run when starting
my computer so that the NumLock key stays off?

A: I am SO sick of answering that question. Shut
up!

Random Access Humor             Page 11                  April 1994

Q: I'm trying to port over spreadsheets from Excel
to Lotus 1-2-3 and I am having trouble.  How can I
do this?

A: Buy Lotus, jerk.


Q: Can I load SmartDrive high?

A: I don't know, can you?


Q: I own an HP Vectra 486/33Mhz VLB computer with
16meg of RAM, a SCSI-2 1.2gig Hard Drive and a
Sound Blaster Pro 16 sound card.  Recently I added
10Mbit/second Ethernet cards to it and my Compaq
Prolinea 4/25s and hooked both machines up using
Novell Netware 3.1 and all of a sudden my Sound
Blaster Pro 16 doesn't work anymore and both
machines hang.  What's the problem?

A: Shut up! Shut Up! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!!!
I DON'T CARE!!!!!  SHUUUTTT UUUUUUUPPPPPP!!!

Why don't you pathetic people start writing to
Dvorak?  You think I get PAID enough to take all
your stupid questions - do you?  That's it, I've
had it!  I Q-U-I-T!!!!!!

In Memory of John Candy
by Ray Koziel

On Friday, March 4, 1994 the entertainment and humor world suffered a
great loss with the passing of John Candy.  Born on Halloween 1950 in
Toronto, Candy got his start in acting doing television commercials.
In 1972 he auditioned for the Second City comedy troupe in Chicago
and performed with that group for a couple of years.  Later he went
back to Toronto to work with the troupe based there.

It was at this point Candy met such personalities as Rick Moranis,
Martin Short, and Dave Thomas who took their comedy from the stage to
the television in the show "SCTV" - Canada's version of "Saturday
Night Live".  While with "SCTV," Candy was able to create some of his
well know personalities and set the foundation for his move to the
big screen.

Candy's Hollywood debut came with the film _1941_.  After some other 
minor roles, Candy got his break with the movie _Splash_ in which he
played Tom Hanks' brother.  He followed with other supporting roles
with Bill Murray, Steve Martin, and Dan Aykroyd (_Stripes_, _Trains,
Planes, and Automobiles_, and _The Great Outdoors_ respectively).

Proving himself as a supporting actor, Candy went on to some more
challenging tasks.  He took the lead roles in such films as _Who Is 
Harry Crumb?_, _Uncle Buck_, _Only the Lonely_, and _Delirious_.
Candy was working on a new film in Mexico titled _Wagons East_ when
he died of a heart attack at age 43.

Candy falls in the genre of comedians that contains other greats such
as Jackie Gleason, John Goodman, and Oliver Hardy.  Although quite
rotund, each man had a heart and sense of humor of equal if not
greater proportions than his stomach.  And despite their large size
they had a certain grace and flair about whatever they did.  In every
role Candy played, he was able to tap the human side of that
character and play it to the fullest.  To John Candy, thank you for
making life a little sweeter!                                   {RAH}

The Twit Filter: The Retroactive Architect
by Dave Bealer

Public e-mail networks have been around for about a decade now.
Literally hundreds of networks exist, ranging from two-node networks
out in the cybersticks to the mother of all networks, the Internet.
Although most networks, and most network users, get their start with
private e-mail, topical public conferences (or echoes) are what
really make the online world go round.  

If ideas are the currency of cyberspace, then everyone online is
wealthy.  The exchange, discussion, refutation and mutilation of
these ideas are what generate the hundreds of megabytes of
information bouncing around the planet through dial-up sessions and
leased lines every single day.  In short, the data goes round and
round and it comes out everywhere.

Random Access Humor             Page 16                  April 1994

Many of these ideas are controversial, and some are downright silly.
But few ideas cause as much grief online as those of the retroactive
architect (retroarch).  These creatures join a new network, or a new
conference.  They look around for a least a few nanoseconds, then
loudly announce that the network (conference) was not designed
properly.  Said announcement is inevitably followed by a litany of
modifications that must be implemented immediately.  

The wisdom and long experience of the retroarch makes the absolute
acceptance of these commandments a certainty, at least in the mind of
the retroarch.  The mere fact that hundreds or thousands of people
have been using and benefiting from the current network (conference)
structure for years has no bearing on the matter.  True retroarchs
can never be convinced that their plans are not a vast improvement
over the shoddy existing design.

After the retroarch is thrown out of the target network or conference
for being an utter nuisance, the redesign campaign will be continued
from another available network or conference.  The usual choice is a
network or conference frequented by users of the network/conference
the architect "needs" to modify.  Since this particular affliction
can rarely be cured, the best thing way to handle retroarchs is to
place them in your twit filter.                                 {RAH}

The RAH Humor Review: More Python Alumni Tapes
by Dave Bealer

Apparently someone has figured out that virtually any video tape
featuring one or more of the Monty Python troop is guaranteed to sell
at least 100,000 copies.  Two more such tapes have been acquired by
yours truly in the past month.  After viewing these latest attempts
at squeezing bucks out of any stray scrap of film containing one or
more of the Python boys, I find myself fervently hoping that no
cameras were rolling during Graham Chapman's briss.

 o  The Strange Case of the End of Civilization As We Know It
      - featuring John Cleese as Arthur Sherlock Holmes, a
        bumbling, modern-day descendant of the famous detective.
        Connie Booth plays Mrs. Hudson, and several well known
        performers (e.g. Denholm Elliot) also appear, although it's
        a safe bet none of them list this turkey on their resume.
        One (sort of) redeeming feature: the absolute worse Kojak
        impression in the history of the genre.  "Who loves ya,
        baby?"  In the case of this tape, precisely no one.

 o  Romance With A Double Bass
      - Based on a short story by Anton Chekhov, this one actually
        isn't that bad.  John Cleese plays Smichkoff, a double bass
        player whose clothes are swiped while he's skinny dipping.
        Connie Booth, a princess, suffers the same fate.  The naked
        Cleese gallantly carries her back to the palace in his double 
	bass case.  Major redeeming feature: a couple of full frontal
	nude shots of Connie Booth (circa mid-1970s).  Major

Random Access Humor             Page 17                  April 1994

	drawback: a nude John Cleese.  (Feel free to reverse these  
	feature/drawback judgments as desired.)  Although strained
	at times, at least this one has an innately funny premise at
	its core.

Both tapes were released by White Star Films.                   {RAH}
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Announcements and Observations

Believe it or not, _Command Line Cowboys: The Best of RAH, Volume 0_
is actually shipping.  Yes!  Just 6 weeks after the planned initial
shipping date.  Possibly a new record for vaporware.  The reason for
the delay is that we tried to add some graphics features that would
never work in a text magazine.  Unfortunately we couldn't get them to
work in the hypertext system either.  Better luck next time.
                             - - -
The RAH official RAH Gateway system is being disbanded as of 4/30/94.
The Official RAH Distribution system will remain in effect.
Basically, this means that the multi-line Gateway listings will
disappear, but the single line listings by state/nation will remain. 
                             - - -
REMINDER: RAH is now being published 10 times per year.  There will
be no July or August issues this year.

the fault (a lack of a sense of humor) lies with them and not with

Internet users may obtain RAH back issues as UUENCODED files attached
to e-mail.  Free subscriptions are also available via mailing lists.
For more info, send an e-mail message to: rahinfo@rah.clark.net 
The subject line and body can contain anything or be blank.

RAH is also available on the Internet via FTP:

         (ASCII Text edition compressed with gzip)

                     >> Writing For RAH <<

Article contributions to RAH are always welcome.  All submissions
must be made electronically.  File attach your article to a netmail
message to Dave Bealer at 1:261/1129.  E-mail (with file attaches)
may also be sent via Internet to: dave.bealer@rah.clark.net

Tagline and filler submissions may be made via e-mail.  Article
submissions should be made via file.  Submitted files must be plain
ASCII text files in normal MS-DOS file format: artname.RAH; where
artname is a descriptive file name and RAH is the mandatory 
extension.  If your article does not conform to these simple specs,
it may get lost or trashed.  Also note that such imaginative names as
RAH.RAH might get overlaid by the blatherings of similarly minded
contributors.  If your hardware is incapable of producing file names
in the proper format, you may send your article as one or more e-mail
messages.  As the volume of mail increases it may not be possible to
make personalized responses to all submissions or correspondence
received. 

The editors reserve the right to publish or not to publish any
submission as/when they see fit.  The editors also reserve the right
to "edit", or modify any submission prior to publication.  This last
right will rarely be used, typically only to correct spelling or
grammar misteaks that are not funny.  RAH is a PG rated publication,
so keep it (mostly) clean.

RAH can accept only the following types of material for publication:
1) Any material in the public domain.
2) Material for which you own the copyright, or represent the copy-
   right holder.  If you wrote it yourself, you are automatically the
   copyright holder. 

Random Access Humor             Page A-3                 April 1994

In writing jargon, RAH is deemed to be given "One Time Rights" to
anything submitted for publication unless otherwise noted in the
message accompanying the contribution.  You still own the material,
and RAH will make no use of the material other than publishing it
electronically in the usual manner.  Your article may be selected for
publication in a planned "Best of RAH" electronic book.  If you want
your copyright notice to appear in your article, place it as desired
in the text you submit.  Previously published articles may be
submitted, but proper acknowledgement must be included: periodical
name, date of previous publication.
