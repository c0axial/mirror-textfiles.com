Editorial - Bleeding Butt Liberals
by Dave Bealer

One of the strangest suggestions received from a RAH Reader Survey
respondent to date is that RAH is "too American."  The respondent in
question, who lives in Europe (of all places!), suggests that RAH
become "more English."  As an Anglophile I have no basic objection to
this provided I'm not required to eat English food. 

One quaint Olde English custom that has received a lot of attention
lately is the caning of youthful offenders.  Anyone who has lurked in
virtually any online conference or read any newspaper in the last few
weeks knows about Michael Fay, the owner of the most famous buttocks
in the world.

For those one or two RAH readers who were visiting relatives on Pluto
and haven't caught up on the news, Michael Fay is an 18 year old from
Dayton, Ohio.  Fay was caught vandalizing cars (with spray paint)
while residing with his family in Singapore, a former British colony.
Singapore has some very strict laws on the books, including execution
for drug dealers.  Singapore also canes young men for several types
of offense, including vandalism involving graffiti.  Fay's sentence
of four months in jail and six strokes of the cane has raised a major
international furor, the likes of which are usually reserved for bus
or plane loads of innocent hostages grabbed by terrorists. 

A lot of folks have been putting on a spectacular "ugly American"
display online.  The most amazing display of stupidity has been from
those misguided Americans who believe that the U.S. Bill of Rights is
a kind of force field that follows them everywhere they go on the
planet.  These yokels fail to recognize that there are actually other
sovereign countries on this planet, with their own laws and ways of
enforcing them.  After a few weeks of this, I began to understand why
Europeans might object to anything that is "too American."

Random Access Humor             Page  2                    May 1994

Another appalling matter is the way the liberal media in the U.S. has
handled (one could almost say, manufactured) this whole situation.
Baltimore's major daily newspaper is an incredibly liberal rag.  They
took a survey of local citizens, then had to engage in lots of fancy
footwork when the survey didn't match their preconceptions.  The
survey results where in the 80-90% range in favor of using corporal
punishment *in America* on young offenders like Fay.  The liberal
"experts," whose opinions came last in the article, noted that these
results were just the public reaction to fear of crime in the
streets.  How horrible, that Americans would react negatively to
rampant crime in the streets!  What is wrong with us?  Surely the
rights of gangs of young thugs are more important than our safety?
NOT!
                            - - -
Submissions to RAH are picking up, which is good.  Among other
things, it means that I can be more selective about what I accept.
Recently I rejected a parody of Edgar Allen Poe's _A Tell Tale
Heart_.   Perhaps I should point out that I'm not a Poe fan, so
parodies based on his work have a tougher time getting accepted.

Another thing that needs to be mentioned is that parody is very
difficult to do well.  If you're going to do it, I recommend trying
free form parody, like my parody of ST:DS9 in the November 1993
issue.  Just playing with characters and general situations makes it
much easier.  Trying to parody a work, line by line, is really tough.
I've only tried it a couple of times, with mixed results.  Some of
you are no doubt better writers than I am, so don't be afraid to try
anything if you really want to.  Just be aware of the difficulties
involved with parody.                                           {RAH}

Bob,
MCI is too late.  Microsoft, AT&T, and Apple got together in a garage
in Klamath Falls, Oregon last Wednesday and conquered the world.
After they divided the spoils, Microsoft ended up with everything
North of San Francisco, AT&T had everything South of San Diego, and
those shrewd negotiators from Apple ended up with Toledo.  Luther
Lecks, who kindly provided the forms and the refreshments for the
negotiations, somehow ended up with the rest of the United States,
Europe, Asia, and Africa.  The RAH staff didn't even get a raise.

Dave,  
In my hunger for the latest issue of RAH, instead of waiting for my
local BBS to post it, I thought, what the hell - call the Puffy Nest
and get it my self. *WRONG*  After several calls (probably around
eight bucks in long distance charges) I flat out gave up. Tried
several protocols - nothing happened.  System locked up on me and
forced a hang up to get me out of it.  Live and learn, only I didn't
learn anything.  Any ideas about why I couldn't d/l the file???
jim.maher@toltbbs.com

Jim,
I'm not sure what to tell you.  There have been no problems reported
by any TPN users lately, and I haven't personally seen anything
weird.  Perhaps if you could give me more details (or at least spell
the name of the BBS correctly).  Another thing, it is better to
address BBS tech support questions to Dave Bealer, rather than to
Lettuce.  I may not get around to reading Lettuce messages until days
or weeks later, when the next issue of RAH is being assembled.  Sorry
for any inconvenience.

Stalking The Wild Lurker
by Dave Bealer

Public message conferences are home to many species of creature.  A
few of these species have been studied in previous RAH issues as part
of the continuing feature, The Twit Filter.  Not all inhabitants of
the online world are twits, even though the message traffic in a
particular conference on a particular day might indicate otherwise.

The simple truth is that twits are people who actually post messages
in conferences, and people who post messages make up a small minority
of the online world (at least if any of the USENET newsgroup reader-
ship stats are to be taken seriously).  This not to say that everyone
who posts is a twit, because they aren't.  Nor is this an indication
that none of the people who never post, commonly called lurkers, are
twits.  It's just that we are spared from reading the twitticisms of 
those twits who choose not to post.

Random Access Humor             Page  4                    May 1994

Lurkers are a very mysterious phenomenon in the online world, since
they are essentially invisible.  Only users who post messages can be
seen, and then only during the time they continue posting.  In this
manner each conference can be seen as a large theater or auditorium
where only the stage is lighted.  Only people who are on the stage
(posting messages) can be seen, both by each other and the audience
of lurkers.

The lurkers are safely hidden in their darkened seats, at least until
such time as a lurker chooses to ascend to the stage by posting a 
public message.  The lurkers in the audience may hold conversations
with each other, via private e-mail, regarding the activities on the
stage or virtually any topic they choose.  These private e-mail
conversations do not have any substantive effect on the dialogue
(read: argument) taking place on the stage, since only the direct
participants in the private exchange will even be aware of it.

The only two sure things about lurkers are that they exist, and that
they don't remain lurkers forever.  Lurkers either get tired of a
given conference (or the online experience in general) and quit, or
they are moved to post a message.  There are several reasons for
first messages posted by lurkers, the most common ones being:

  - The lurker has information (or an idea) pertinent to one of the
    threads currently taking place in the conference.  Although this
    is probably the best reason for someone to "disengage lurking
    device," it is, regrettably, not the most common reason.

  - A statement made in the conference challenges some sacred cow of
    the lurker in question.  The lurker feels the need to repudiate
    the foul person who has sullied the lurker's beliefs.
    Predictably, this is one of the most common reasons why people
    "de-lurk."

  - The lurker has a question that needs an immediate answer, usually
    for an important project (that was due two days ago) in a
    required course.  The question might, if the moon is in just the
    right phase, have something vaguely to do with the topic of the
    conference where the message was posted.  The moon is almost
    *never* in just the right phase.  

Lurkers posting their first message should not be confused with those
who can't be bothered with lurking.  These characters see an
interesting looking conference title and barge in, posting a demand
(usually in ALL CAPS) to be told "what goes on here?"  Even better
are the ones who "know what the conference has to be about" from the 
extensive research involved in reading the conference title, and
proceed to post messages on that basis.  These folks are classic twit
filter bait. 

Random Access Humor             Page  5                    May 1994

Before anyone gets the wrong idea about lurkers I should mention that
lurking is often a *good thing*.  Users new to the online experience,
or who are checking out a new conference, should lurk for a while
before posting.  This directive is almost as important for your
online safety as that old saw, "look both ways before crossing the
street."  Determining what conversations are going on and what the
rules and customs for the conference are would seem (using common
sense) to be a basic prerequisite to posting messages.  It doesn't
always work that way.  Still, breaking this directive should only be
attempted by those wearing flame retardant clothing.

Experienced users can be lurkers too.  They may be too busy to pay
close attention to the messages and to write thoughtful replies, or
they may not be interested in any of the topics currently being
discussed.   This is perfectly okay, not to mention preferable to
demanding loudly and petulantly why no threads of interest to the
lurker are being discussed.  The sensible solution to this last
problem is to start a thread that is of interest.

This underlines the major difference between an online conference and
a real theater.  Only one person can speak at a time in a real
theater, at least if the performers want to be heard and understood.
Many people can sing at the same time, but they had better be singing
the same tune, or chaos will result.  In an online conference several  
conversations (threads) can be occurring simultaneously.  If you
don't like any of the songs being performed in a conference, get up
on stage and start one you do like.  If others find your song
interesting enough to join in, you've just started another thread.

In summary, lurkers aren't all that mysterious, since virtually
everyone is a lurker at one time or another.  There are about as many
reasons for lurking as there are lurkers.  As a child I was afraid of
dead people.  My father told me, "don't worry about dead people, son,
it's the live ones you gotta watch out for."  The same thing goes for
lurkers.  Don't worry about lurkers, it's the posters you have to
worry about.                                                    {RAH}

RAH News Magazine
by Greg Borek

Our lead story tonight: Mrs. Edna Greenbaum of Passaic, New Jersey
has quietly become the richest woman in the world.  Demonstrating
keen business acumen and a perverse love of peanut butter, Mrs.
Greenbaum quietly obtained the patent for the computer keyboard.
From now on anyone using a computer keyboard to input information
into a computer now owes Mrs. Greenbaum 25 cents per keystroke.  When
questioned what possessed her to make such a bold and insightful
financial maneuver, Mrs. Greenbaum claimed that she was actually
trying to obtain a patent for a new lawnmower that operates by
burning off some of the immense amount of sugar in peanut butter, but
filled the form out wrong.  Lawyers are preparing to sue. 

Spot the Wonder Dog was unfortunately shot and killed by Secret
Service agents today while at an award ceremony in his honor at the
White House.  Spot TWD was at the White House to receive an award
from the First Cat for conspicuous bravery and "just plain smarts"
not usually found in a canine.  Spot TWD's award was for having
reprogrammed the onboard computers and then landing a crippled
airplane that had inadvertently run into a flock of vultures (without
permission) that now inhabit the environs of Dulles airport.  (The
vultures are endangered so now airplanes are as well.)  Apparently,
as Spot TWD was preparing to read from a prepared statement he forgot
where he was and pooped on the carpet before attempting to "tree" the
First Cat.  Approximately 150 of the warning shots fired by the
Secret Service hit Spot TWD, and he died two hours later at DC 
General.  Lawyers for the SPCA are planning to sue.

Joseph J. Henderson won an 3 day, 7 night all-expense paid trip for
two to the Bahamas for winning a computer programming contest
sponsored by IBM.  Mr. Henderson, a retired milkman who only has a
rough familiarity with the BASIC programming language, won the
contest by producing the smallest, fastest program that would
"produce a sorted list of numbers in ascending order".  Mr.
Henderson's rudimentary BASIC program was only 20 bytes in size and
did indeed produce a sorted list of numbers as output, provided,
however, the input was also sorted in ascending order.  When notified
by IBM that although he had fulfilled the letter of the instructions
he had not complied with the spirit of the contest and was therefore
not being considered eligible for a prize, Mr. Henderson called "a
lawyer guy with nice hair I saw on the boob tube" and was eventually
awarded the first prize.

No one in the computer industry was surprised or really that
interested in a "kind-of" announcement "unofficially" made by 
Microsoft about some software it might produce eventually.
Apparently the computer media is tired of being played like a cheap 
violin and is now waiting until Microsoft actually produces something
before evaluating it.  A spokesman for people said, "Well, it's about
time."  Intel is planning to sue for service mark infringement:
obviously Microsoft is trying to mimic Intel's "string'em along but
only produce something when you really have to" marketing strategy
and business plan.

The newly created Ministry of Thought Police ruled today that it is
now a felony to make any sort of pun about the "information
superhighway."  They are concerned that these puns are trivializing
Mr. Gore's importance and make him look more and more and more and
more like Dan Quayle every day.  The Ministry also executed its first
suspect, a Mr. Fred Rogers of Tempe, AZ.  Mr. Rogers was caught
red-handed wondering in a private e-mail message what business Ms.
Rodham Clinton had attending Cabinet meetings.  Ministry officials
hoped that all heretics could be eliminated as quickly in the
future.

On a positive note, a lawyer committed suicide today by jumping off
of the Empire State Building.  A note found at the scene said the man
was tired of being a detriment to society, forever sponging off the
honest labor of working people without contributing anything.  It
went on to say that lawyers have now made their way into every aspect
of human life, and he felt that honest people should be able to make
major transactions without having to support overpaid whiners.  A
spokesman for lawyers said he wasn't surprised that a thing like this
could happen given the constant harassment lawyers are constantly
subjected to.

As a surprise to absolutely no one, 118 million separate lawsuits are
being filed against the man's estate, the city and state of New York,
the owners of the Empire State Building, the descendants of the
people who constructed the building, anyone who witnessed the event,
the inventor of the hula-hoop, Utah, the Coca-Cola company, the
Colorado Rockies baseball team, and several other people not in any
way connected with the event.                                   {RAH}

Twelve Steps To An Affordable Health Care System
by Dean J. Earlix

One look at competing health care proposals makes it pretty obvious
no one with both understanding and need of public health care was
ever consulted.  Even an impoverished doctoral student in one of the
allied health fields using just the leftover dregs of his imagination
could do better.  In fact, could anyone be better qualified?
Consider these 12 steps to an affordable health care system:

1.  Put a lid on those pointless medical procedures, but avoid the
    costs of new bureaucracy, by letting an *existing* federal agency
    spot-check surgery and diagnostic tests.  I figure the Internal
    Revenue Service--which is already geared for audits and Internal
    anyway--could handle this.  Who knows, maybe this year the IRS
    can start saving Americans money instead of just grabbing it.

Random Access Humor             Page 12                    May 1994

2.  Know from the start if your doctor is any good.  Toss out all
    those old magazines in doctors' waiting rooms and replace them
    with current medical journals and a medical dictionary.  Now when
    you sit down, you can read about your symptoms and quiz the
    physician before a consultation.  This measure could cut down the
    need for expensive multiple opinions, motivate doctors to study
    the current medical literature, and no doubt shorten waiting
    periods.

3.  Improve the accessibility of primary health care.  Move
    specialists out of those expensive, inconvenient medical centers
    and into retail districts and malls where you can also cut costs
    by eliminating offices.  Optometrists are already working out of
    eyeglass stores; why not have child psychologists in toy stores,
    a marriage councilor at the florist, and gynecologists in
    lingerie shops?

4.  Motivate people to undertake preventative health care. Most folks
    vaguely know that preventative health care saves society money,
    but how do we give John and Jane Q. Public their piece?  How
    about this: say epidemiological studies indicate a certain test
    for premenopausal women will save society millions of dollars.
    Use census data to work this out on a per patient basis and send
    out savings for the test in a recognizable form... perhaps as
    discount coupons.  Of course, the expiration date on some of
    these coupons, menopause in this example, could be messy to
    check.

5.  Lower the costs of medical research, which should drop the cost
    of medical treatments, by using white collar criminals in
    research labs.  Criminal labor that is--I won't even ask what you
    were thinking.  Myself, I've been wondering why we should have
    college-educated lawbreakers just stamping out license plates or
    working out with weights when they could be washing lab glassware
    or running analytic equipment.  Far from being worried, the
    medical researchers I've worked for would love having an
    assistant they could threaten to send to prison for sloppy work.
    And do so nightly.

6.  Fight the multibillion dollar costs of addiction by selectively
    decriminalizing addictive substances and dispensing them from
    government clinics that give mandatory therapy.  Conservatives
    worried that decriminalization amounts to social approval, fear
    not: We'll let the anti-abortion industry handle the accompanying
    graphic of what drugs *really* do to the brain.  Yech.  For
    liberals concerned about the victims of decriminalization, those
    poor disenfranchised drug traffickers, we could retrain them for
    urban distribution of prescription drugs.  At today's prices,
    they'd hardly know the difference.

7.  Eliminate the nettlesome conflict of interest between health
    plans and health plan users.  In case we legislate which
    procedures are covered by national insurance, let's consider
    trivia like dollar estimates of physical pain, mental anguish,

Random Access Humor             Page 13                    May 1994

    and chance of failure.  No doubt, health plan executives will
    insist on determining these values themselves.  Sounds fair: For
    verisimilitude, offer to drape them in paper gowns, belt them
    onto the examining or operation table, chill the instruments, and
    ask them to suggest dollar values for everything they are about
    to experience.

8.  Widen the health tax base.  As long as we tax people to disease
    themselves with alcohol and tobacco, why not add health tax to
    other unhealthy substances?  We could tax raw fish and rare meat
    at restaurants to cover parasite and food poisoning treatment,
    tax tanning salons and bikinis to pay for skin cancer operations,
    and maybe a workplace stress tax leveled against abusive
    superiors.  Admittedly, if folks start living more healthy lives
    and treating each other with respect, the tax base would all but
    dry up, but I don't suppose there's much danger of that happening
    soon.

9.  Institute no-fault medical malpractice insurance that completely
    covers doctors, generously awards victims of human error, and
    leaves lawyers out in the cold.  Practitioners could lower their
    fees across the board once they stopped paying malpractice
    insurance premiums greater than their patient's annual income.
    If they hold true to form, lawyers' groups with names like "just 
    plain folks against malicious medical malfeasance" will be
    contributing more money to fight the measure than is spent by all   
    presidential and legislative candidates *combined*.  Just a 5%
    tax on these political contributions could probably fund
    reasonable damage awards through the twenty-second century.

10. Substitute unemployed professionals for overpaid medical
    specialists.  For example, hire unemployed Hughes engineers and 
    computer programmers to replace $200,000/year anesthesiologists.
    As an added benefit, the new anesthesiologists could talk to the
    patient about their former work, greatly decreasing the required
    amount of anesthetic.  We could also cut costs by replacing
    physical therapists with drill sergeants recently released due to
    military downsizing.  Can't you just hear it echo down the
    hospital hallway now?  "Streeeeraaatch those tendons you WORM!"
    Last, use the natural inclination of medical malpractice lawyers,
    hopefully unemployed due to no-fault malpractice insurance, as
    blood-letting phlebotomists.

11. Allow elective medical treatments to be paid by elective
    donations. Hospitals and clinics are chronically short of blood 
    because, if cash is paid, they get donations from undesirable
    types like alcoholics, drug abusers, and college students.  If
    payment was non-cash--credit for elective procedures--
    undesirables would not be attracted by the cash.  A couple
    gallons of blood (separate visits, please) and those braces won't
    cost a cent.  Indeed, if doctors had switched earlier to the
    serpent and staff caduceus and dropped the gilded balls of the
    Medici device, the notion of cash for blood donations might never
    have come up: While the Medici name is remembered in the word

Random Access Humor             Page 14                    May 1994

    medicine (and Medicare) the family device has remained the symbol
    for their other line of business, pawn shops.

12. Read more humorous material.  Not only is laughter cheap, it
    might just be the best medicine.                            {RAH}

When the Gods Get Bored
by Ray Koziel

"Loki!  Loki where are you?!"

"Why Thor, how are you doing?  What's all the fuss about?"

"Loki, Father Odin has asked me to talk to you about some of your
mischievous doings of late.  He wants you to stop playing your pranks
immediately and leave California alone."

"Oh come on Thor!  Give me a break!  What is a god to do nowadays?
Those humans down there have forgotten about us up here in Asgard!
All of them, caught up in their material things - their homes and
cars and computers.  Or they are too busy!  Running to this meeting
and that conference!  To be honest Thor, I'm just plain bored." 

"Bored?   Loki, you are a god of Asgard...how can you possibly be
bored?!" 

"I didn't think it could be possible either but it's true.  It was
kinda fun at first.  Let's see, there was the Bermuda Triangle.  That
lasted quite some time before humans just stopped going through
there.  Then there are the UFOs!  Those still work in certain places.
And then they invented the computer!  I'm still having a ball with
those!  Computer viruses, system crashes, the possibilities are
endless!  And they're putting together this information highway to
link 'em all together!  Hooboy!  I can't wait."

"See Loki!  I'd say you are far from being bored."

"Ok, ok.  But you have to admit, it's just not the same!  I mean even
you have to admit that a thousand years ago you had 'em shaking on
Midgard every time you slammed your hammer and sent thunder through
the air.  And what's all this about me leaving California alone?"

"Well haven't you gone a little overboard?  Fire, riots, mudslides,
earthquakes - how much can one area take?!"

Random Access Humor             Page 15                    May 1994

"Oh, all those pompous, rich idiots make me sick and I had to teach
'em a lesson.  Why they want to live on top of a fault line is beyond
me anyway.  And what are you getting on my case for, Mr.
Thunderpants?  How about you and that little flood you got going in
the Midwest, huh?" 

"Ok you got me!  I see your point.  It has been so long since I've
been able to express my strength and power.  It just got pent up
inside me and I had to let it go.  You're right Loki, things are not
the same anymore and there just isn't anything for a god to do."

"Hey, come on, don't be so glum!  I know!  Let's go see how my latest
prank is unfolding.  I've been sending Wall Street on the wildest
ride ever.  This should keep those starched shirts and bean counters
on antacid for a while!"

"I'm glad to see some things haven't changed!  Let's go!"       {RAH}

The Unfinancial User
by Chris Davidson

"You are old father Williams, the young man cried, and your hair
it is turning grey . . . "

I don't know who wrote the original of this. Someone called
Thomas Blakney, I think. Whoever he was, it is his poem that 
seems at this particular instance, to prey upon my mind . .   

Prey is not actually a good description. It is more like
something teetering around in my mind, somewhat like a young
lady trying out her first set of high heels and probably just as
comfortable . . . 

Why am I thinking of this you ask?, Good question. Actually it
is because of a user, a nerd, and a juvenile one at that . . .
This is the reason for all my consternation and self doubts, as
to why, it is because he has touched upon a subject that I
normally avoid.

I, with all my accumulated knowledge at this present moment, am
feeling . . .  dare I say it, have to admit I am getting OLD!  It 
is not so much that  I am old that annoys me, its the insinuation
that I am and I quote 'ANCIENT.' 

How did it start, what brought it on? Quite simple, a user
logging onto my BBS and me being stupid, answering a Sysop page
call . . . 

<sirens blare> (well they do if you run PCBoard correctly)

Random Access Humor             Page 16                    May 1994

Hello this is the Sysop, how may I help you? (I have a polite
tone to my page calls, comes with age). 

"Ummm..giday (this nerd can't even spell correctly), how's it
going? 

Okay. Can I help you with something? 

Yes, why can't I download the latest copy of DOOM? 

Please hold while I check <madly shell to PCBoard System
manager>, darn this bloke is non-financial and has a status
level equivalent to an amoeba and he expects download status .
. . fat chance! 

<Politely> Sorry but as an unfinancial user you cannot download
any files. 

What a bummer . . .  

Yes well them's the breaks . . .  

Yes, umm how bout I have a temp priviledge level just this
wunce? 

<Get stuffed> under my breath . . .  Sorry, it's not possible. 

Puleeeese? <this whining, lapdog approach isn't gunna get you
any where! 

Sorry. 

Do you go to Uni? 

No. 

Rats, wuz gunna give you some hints on the up coming exams!  Who
are you? 

The sysop! 

Oh, you're the old bloke who runs the BBS . . . ? 

<Old, old . . .  ever so slightly the blood pressure begins to
boil.> Just what do you mean by old? 

Well. your about 28 or sumpin aren't you? 

No slightly older <the blood pressure goes up another notch> 

Umm how old are you?  

It is here I could do my Zsa Zsa Gabor impersonation and say that,
contrary to media speculation, I am a mere 30!  But being old and
wise <a fact I will come to regret later> I say proudly, no a bit
older than that!  

Random Access Humor             Page 17                    May 1994

Umm you mean you are older than 28?  mibbe 30 sumpin, wun of them
wrinklies! 

<I am now at a loss for words.  What is a wrinkly, how old is a
wrinkly?)  <I decide to battle on>. . .Try adding a few years. 

Older'n 30? 

Yes <defiantly> 

40? 

Older! <The chest suddenly thrusts itself forward, leaving me
temporarily out of breath, but I make it> 

How old are you? <This is said with a certain amount of respect
at this  point, but soon it will degenerate into something
totally different.>

Around 50 <give or take a few months, but who's counting> 

Reeeeeeely no kidding, that old? 

Yes, Why? 

Shouldn't you be in bed or sumpin?  I mean thats ancient man!

<Ever so slightly a China Syndrome begins to build itself within
my bosom.  When you get to my age, it is common to find that men 
do tend to develop bosoms.> 

No I should not be in bed,  and what has my age got to do with
anything? What the hell is it you want? 

How kum you no so much about computers?  They wasn't invented
when you were a kid! <uuh ohh, come in sucker> 

What! course they were, we just didn't use them as much. 

You guys didn't have any PC's when you wuz kids!  My dad say's
you used sumpin called an abakus!

<Suddenly, the chaos at Chernobyl seems miniscule compared to
what is happening to my blood pressure> Look geek! <vehmence>
I will have you know they had computers in my day. We just
didn't have personal computers. 

Booooooll sheet! the PC wasn't even invented when you wuz a kid!

<Suddenly the pounding in my head becomes intolerable. Quickly I
try to shove one of the little blue pills my local MD gave me to
reduce the pressure in my cholesterol choked veins, down to the
back of my throat>

Random Access Humor             Page 18                    May 1994

I betcha you wuz peepin over Charles Babbages shoulder when they
invented computers . . . <g>

Funny bugger! <The blue pill manages to lodge itself not where
it is  supposed to, but between the last of my two remaining
molars . . .   I close my mouth. A bitter tasting concoction
fills my olfactory system which adds to my rising anger.> His
comment about ancient, combined with the bitter taste of the
junk enclosed in the blue pill causes me to grimace more than is
usual.

CRACK!

I release my grip on the mouse I was holding for succour, it
disintegrates into a thousand pieces, without a whimper, or a
squeak!  I attempt to type  a message which should have said
"LISTEN YOU!' but I hit the keyboard too hard and the plastic
top on the letter 'L' goes sailing across the room  to be lost
among the rest of the office rubbish.  Bravely I battle on and
hit the keyboard.  With a whimper I shove what is left of the
bleeding stump that was my finger into my mouth.  This guy has
begun to get to me!

Realising I am now sans mouse, sans one digit, I attempt to
restore some credability to the BBS and my standing as a Sysop .
. . this is hard.  It has to be the most ridiculous sight you
could ever see, a Sysop  madly trying to type and avoiding the
missing letter 'L', which makes all your sentences come out
sounding as if you are one of these Japanese TV commercials . .
. oh what a feering 'Toyota'!  John Laws would hate me.

I try to jury rig the mouse...have you ever attempted to push
two wires  around a mouse pad, without balls!  Looks totally
stupid . . . 

Rook you!  I am not ord.  I am a mature computer operator!  Don't 
you forget it ?. . .  if it wasn't for guys rike me you wourn't
have a BBS to carr up.

The residue of the pills start to take effect, all I want to do
at this moment is to lie down somewhere and catch my breath . . . 

Rook! < I start to say, then suffer an instantaneous bout of
altheziemers>

Hello?  Hello you still there Sysop?

Awww gaaawd I mutter to myself . . . mibbe he's right, mibbe I

Humor/Comedy Favorites of the RAH Writers:

For the duration of the 1994 RAH Reader Survey, we'll be providing
you with the survey responses of several RAH Writers.  This month,
the survey responses of Greg Borek:

Your favorite stand-up comedian: George Carlin - A mean, cynical
surly old coot. (Greg can probably identify because he is a mean,
cynical surly young coot - Ed.) 

Your favorite comic actor: Christopher Lloyd - does the most
convincing clinical insanity (Ibid - Ed.)

Your favorite comic actress: Valerie Bertinelli, closely followed by
Marilu Henner.  Some people might actually like to see that.

Random Access Humor             Page 22                    May 1994

Your favorite comedy movie: Kermit the Frog Goes Crazy-ape Bonkers
With His Drill & Set - I'm not sure where I saw this but the visual
experience was stunning.

Your favorite comedy television show: Monty Python's Flying Circus -
No other program has the quality, variety, or staying power.
Excellent all around.  Nothing else comes close.

Your favorite humorous novel: "Coffee, Repartee, and the Idiot"
(1899).  An obscure book about life in a boarding house where the
Idiot wins all tests of wits. 

Your favorite comic book: Marvel's The Avengers - This is a qualified
vote because I have never read two consecutive issues.  This makes
any sort of plotline impossible to follow.  Stan Lee is an artistic
God. 

Your favorite humor columnist: Dave Barry, closely followed by P.J.
O'Rourke.  Barry does it every week but O'Rourke's "Parliament of
Whores" qualifies him for sainthood.                            {RAH}

RAH Humor Review: Classic Comedy Recordings
by Dave Bealer

This month the RAH Humor Review takes a departure from coverage of
newly released comedy.  A RAH Reader Survey respondent pointed out
that several forms of humor/comedy have been ignored in the survey.
The most important form mentioned was comedy records.  Here are some
of my favorite humorous recordings:

>> Stand Up Comedy <<

George Carlin - Toledo Window Box  (circa 1973)
* A friend in high school had this one, so I don't have any details.
  We really enjoyed this one, though.  George has enjoyed incredible
  longevity in a tough and competitive field.  He's just as funny
  today as the first time I saw him do his "Hippy-Dippy Weatherman"
  routine in the sixties.

Cheech & Chong - Big Bambu  (circa 1973)
* The definitive drug comics do routines like "Sister Mary Elephant,"
  "The Empire Hancock Building," and "Let's Make A Dope Deal."  This
  LP(*) came with Cheech & Chong rolling papers.  I had a real
  interesting time explaining to my father what they were doing in my
  room.  (Now available on CD from Warner)

Bill Cosby - Fat Albert  (circa 1973)
* Probably not the title of any of Cosby's early albums, which were
  owned by that same friend in high school.  Long before Dr. Huxtable
  there was Fat Albert and all the other crazies Bill grew up with.
  Around this time there was also an animated series called "Fat
  Albert And The Cosby Kids."

Random Access Humor             Page 23                    May 1994

Lily Tomlin - This Is A Recording  (Polydor - 1971)
* The Laugh-In veteran captured live at The Ice House, Pasadena, CA.
  Lily portrays audacious operator Ernestine in such classics as "The
  Marriage Counselor," "Mr. Veedle," and "The Repairman."  The first
  comedy record I ever purchased.


>> Humorous Music/Parodies <<
  (includes recordings combining music and stand up routines)

Kip Addotta - The Comedian Of The United States (Laff - 1985)
* Features my favorite original comedy song, "Wet Dream."  Also
  includes "A State of the Humor Address," and "Big Cock-Roach."

Steve Martin - Comedy Is Not Pretty   (Warner - 1979)
* The banjo-picking "wild and crazy guy" recorded live at the
  Boarding House in San Francisco.  Includes "Googlephonics," "Cruel
  Shoes," and "Comedy Is Not Pretty."

Monty Python - Matching Tie and Handkerchief  (Arista - 1973)
* A mixture of old and new.  Classic Python sketches include: "The
  Cheese Shop," "Bruces," and "Bishop on the Landing."  Among the new
  bits are "Background to History," "World War Noises," and "Word
  Association Football."  Side two of the original LP had a unique
  feature - there were two completely separate sets of grooves.
  After listening to half the material on side two, you had to keep
  placing the needle at the start until it found the second groove
  entry.  The copy I own is "banded for airplay" so it has the normal
  boring LP layout on both sides.

Peter, Paul & Mary - In Concert   (circa 1964)
* I can hear it.  Several thousand people just said, in unison, "What
  the heck...."  Yes, I know.  PPM are not generally known for humor,
  at least by those not familiar with their work.  It just so happens
  that these folks *are* funny.  Noel Paul Stookey is a fine stand up
  comic, in addition to being a member of the most famous folk
  singing trio in history.  His routine "Paultalk" from this double
  album (now a double CD by Warner) was the first stand up comedy
  routine I ever memorized.  My mother had to buy another copy when I
  wore out the first one by constantly dropping the needle on
  "Paultalk" and "Puff the Magic Dragon" (seven-year-olds don't make 
  the most delicate needle droppers in the world).  Peter Yarrow does
  a great audience interaction spot setting up harmonies for "Rock My
  Soul" that had to be the inspiration for SCTV's Schmenge Brothers
  routine.  Peter also does a hilariously confused speech about "The
  Dragon" to lead into "Puff."  Last, but definitely not least, Mary
  Travers and Paul Stookey have a playful duet in "Car, Car."  Noel
  Paul Stookey wears yet another hat these days.  He's the sysop of
  the Celebration Station BBS in Blue Hill Falls, Maine.  Using the
  Major BBS, CeleStat supports speeds up to 14400 at (207) 374-5161.

Random Access Humor             Page 24                    May 1994

"Weird Al" Yankovic - In 3-D     (Scottie Brothers - 1984)
* The modern master of song parodies at his best.  Includes classics
  like "Eat It," "Buy Me A Condo," "I Lost On Jeopardy," and "King of
  Suede."

{* Note: for younger readers who don't remember the Vinyl Age, the
term "LP" stands for "Long Playing record."  They were the fore-
runners of today's CDs.}                                        {RAH}

Announcements and Observations

The 1994 RAH Reader Survey is still in full swing.  We've already
received 25% more responses in three months than for the 1993 survey,
which has been running for 15 months.  There are still two months
(until June 30, 1994) to respond in time to have your survey entered
in the drawing.  Interim standings in the "popularity" portion of the
survey follow (standings as of 4/27/94): 

  Stand Up Comic:
    Robin Williams and George Carlin are dueling for first place,
    with Steven Wright a close third.

  Comic Actor:
    Steve Martin is tied for first with John Cleese.  Chevy Chase
    and Robin Williams are tied for third.  A very close race.

  Comic Actress:
    Whoopie Goldberg is first, closely followed by Goldie Hawn.
    Gilda Radner is in third place.

  Comedy Movie:
    Monty Python and the Holy Grail is clearly in the lead, with
    Monty Python's Life of Brian tied for second with The Naked Gun.
    Oddly enough, the Airplane movies haven't received a single vote.

  Comedy Television Program:
    Home Improvement is currently edging out M*A*S*H and Monty 
    Python's Flying Circus.  Seinfeld is in fourth.  I have to 
    confess that I've never seen the first or fourth place shows.

  Humorous Novel:
    The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is running away with this
    category.  In fact, it's the only book that has received more
    than one vote.

  Comic Book:
    This category has been dominated by "None" or blank responses.
    No comic book has received more than one vote.

  Humor Columnist:
    Dave Barry is pulling away from P. J. O'Rourke, who remains in 
    second, just ahead of Dave Bealer.  It's somewhat embarrassing 
    that I've received as many votes as Erma Bombeck and Lewis 
    Grizzard put together.  I should mention that no brownie points 
    will be awarded for voting for me.

REMINDER: RAH is now being published 10 times per year.  There will
be no July or August issues this year.
                             - - -
Dave Bealer will be offline during June and July in order to pursue a
non-RAH related writing project.  It is also hoped that a vacation
from RAH will give him some fresh ideas and enthusiasm.  The Puffin's
Nest will still be operating, but Dave makes no promises as far as
responding to mail quickly.

Manuscripts for RAH may still be submitted, but they will not be read
until August.
                             - - -
The deadline for submissions for the June 1994 issue is 05/25/94.

Random Access Humor (RAH) is published ten times a year (September -
June) by Dave Bealer as a disservice to the online community.  
Although the publisher's BBS may be a part of one or more networks at
any time, RAH is not affiliated with any BBS network or online
service.  RAH is a compilation of individual articles contributed by 
their authors.  The contribution of articles to this compilation does
not diminish the rights of the authors.  The opinions expressed in
RAH are those of the authors and are not necessarily those of the
publisher.

This entire publication is a work of satire (except for these legal
bits here).  If anyone takes offense to something published herein,
the fault (a lack of a sense of humor) lies with them and not with 
the magazine.  The editors and publisher will not be held responsible
for the use or misuse of any information contained in this magazine.

Random Access Humor is Copyright 1994 Dave Bealer.  All Rights 
Reserved.  Duplication and/or distribution is permitted for non-
commercial purposes only.  RAH may not be distributed on diskette or 
in hardcopy form for a fee without express written permission from the 
publisher.  For any other use, contact the publisher.

RAH may only be distributed in unaltered form.  Online systems whose
users cannot access the original binary archive file may offer it for 
viewing or download in text format, provided the original text is not
modified.  Readers may produce hard copies of RAH or backup copies on
diskette for their own personal use only.  RAH may not be distributed
in combination with any other publication or product.

Many of the brands and products mentioned in RAH are trademarks of

Copies of the current issue of RAH may be obtained by manual download
or Wazoo/EMSI File Request from The Puffin's Nest BBS (FREQ: RAH), or
from various sites in several BBS networks.  Back issues of RAH may
be obtained by download or file request from The Puffin's Nest BBS.

Internet users may obtain RAH back issues as UUENCODED files attached
to e-mail.  Free subscriptions are also available via mailing lists.
For more info, send an e-mail message to: rahinfo@rah.clark.net 
The subject line and body can contain anything or be blank.

RAH is also available on the Internet via FTP:

                     >> Writing For RAH <<

Article contributions to RAH are always welcome.  All submissions
must be made electronically.  File attach your article to a netmail
message to Dave Bealer at 1:261/1129.  E-mail (with file attaches)
may also be sent via Internet to: dave.bealer@rah.clark.net

Tagline and filler submissions may be made via e-mail.  Article
submissions should be made via file.  Submitted files must be plain
ASCII text files in normal MS-DOS file format: artname.RAH; where
artname is a descriptive file name and RAH is the mandatory 
extension.  If your article does not conform to these simple specs,
it may get lost or trashed.  Also note that such imaginative names as
RAH.RAH might get overlaid by the blatherings of similarly minded
contributors.  If your hardware is incapable of producing file names
in the proper format, you may send your article as one or more e-mail
messages.  As the volume of mail increases it may not be possible to
make personalized responses to all submissions or correspondence
received. 

The editors reserve the right to publish or not to publish any
submission as/when they see fit.  The editors also reserve the right
to "edit", or modify any submission prior to publication.  This last
right will rarely be used, typically only to correct spelling or
grammar misteaks that are not funny.  RAH is a PG rated publication,
so keep it (mostly) clean.

RAH can accept only the following types of material for publication:
1) Any material in the public domain.
2) Material for which you own the copyright, or represent the copy-
   right holder.  If you wrote it yourself, you are automatically the
   copyright holder. 

Random Access Humor             Page A-3                   May 1994

In writing jargon, RAH is deemed to be given "One Time Rights" to
anything submitted for publication unless otherwise noted in the
message accompanying the contribution.  You still own the material,
and RAH will make no use of the material other than publishing it
electronically in the usual manner.  Your article may be selected for
publication in a planned "Best of RAH" electronic book.  If you want
your copyright notice to appear in your article, place it as desired
in the text you submit.  Previously published articles may be
submitted, but proper acknowledgement must be included: periodical
name, date of previous publication.

RAH Distribution System:
(Sites bearing the <contrib> designation will accept your
 contributions and forward them to the editors.)
(All these systems would be good places to find sysops with a sense
 of humor...seemingly a rarity these days.)
