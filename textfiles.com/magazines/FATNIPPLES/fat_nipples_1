	Why is it that everyone I know thinks that punk ended with the Sex 
Pistols?  Everybody around here insists that their music is "hardcore" not 
"punk".  All my friends seem to think that if you call yourself punk, you'll 
sprout a pink mohawk and get yellow teeth.
	What bullshit.
	Everyone in the super-hip City Gardens scene seems to have forgotten
that hardcore is an abbreviation for hardcore punk(not to mention rock and 
roll).
	It's the same way with straight edge.  If you consider yourself 
straight, then soon you'll shave your head, put Xs on your hands and sing 
Crucial Youth songs.
	The problem around here is that everyone's worried what other people 
think.  Everyone acts like they don't care, but we still try to impress the 
crowd.  We reject the mainstream crowd at school and at home to join the 
"alternative" one at City Gardens.   But it's still a crowd.  A crowd is a 
crowd and if you try impress someone, no matter how cool that person is, 
your still a trendy asshole.
	Do you like hardcore because of its independence and rebellion?  Do 
you like hardcore because of its free exchange of alternative viewpoints and 
radical politics?  Or do you like it because there's a Biohazard video on 
MTV?  If you answered yes to one of the first two questions, then more power 
to you.  Reject all the fucking trendy-ass stuck-upness and punk out!  Be 
yourself!  If you answered yes to the last question, go buy a fifty-dollar 
Gap flannel shirt and mosh it up!  Understand?!?
	Speaking of Biohazard(Remember?  Back in the last paragraph.), I 
just saw them play at City Gardens this week with Sick of it All and Sheer 
Terror.  I don't know about them.  Their music is outstanding and they said 
some cool stuff--they allowed people to stage dive even though they were 
recording a live album--but most of it smacks of bullshit.  For instance, 
their guitarist--the one who couldn't help saying fuck, or some variant 
thereof, every third word--said that if it was up to the band, no one would 
have paid to get in.  Sure.  That's why it cost ten dollars to get in.     
Don't take me as a Fugazi worshiper, but they manage to play City Gardens 
for five bucks, while Biohazard, who get played on  MTV and managed to pack 
the place, needed ten.  There are dozens of bands that manage to charge ten 
dollars for CD's, but Biohazard cares so much that they'll take fifteen.  As 
Biohazard themselves say (talking to Ricki Racktman on MTV, selling their 
record)," Music's for you and me, not the fucking industry."
	Another thing that bothered me was their attitude towards moshing.  
They repeatedly chastised people like me, who were standing in the back.  If 
some people want to distance themselves from the idiocy of pit politics and 
the band's super-macho, good old boy, spitting and cussing image that's our business.
	Sick of it All was great though.  Live, I could forget their 
Relativity\In-Effect corporate cock-rockness and that their new album is a 
non-vinyl release and really concentrate on the great music.  None of those 
guys cursed too much either.  Lou even talked about his mom!
	The best part of the show, however, was that I got to dance without 
taking part in the stupid tribal, ritualistic, macho, regressive, new-wave 
masculine bullshit-fest that takes over the dance floor at all the shows 
these days.  You know what I'm talking about!  All of those crazy kids, 
releasing energy and aggression!   Good old fashioned American grandma and 
apple pie fun!  I would've joined the football team if I liked that kind of 
fun.


	See "Slacker".  It's good.







                               My Playlist!
	Stuff that I listen to, that you should listen to too:

Iconoclast 7" - Raw, screamy, fucked up, intelligent hardcore.  Powerful and 
danceable at times. ($2.5, Ebullition, P.O. Box 680, Goleta, CA 93116)

jazz tinged, anti-nostalgic revolution music.  Truly original. ($8, 
Dischord Records, 3819 Beecher St., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20007)

Downcast LP - Fucking great, intelligent rage.  Every week, I find a new 
favorite song off of this.  It comes with a huge booklet with essays and 
information on all sorts of topics.   These guys take themselves way too 
seriously, but as long as their music stays this good, I don't care. ($5, 
Ebullition Records, above)

Helmet - "Strap It On" LP - Much better than their new one, "Meantime".  
Rawer, harder, fresher.  Get the AmRep version, not the Interscope reissue!
(Amphetamine Reptile Records, 2541 Nicollet Ave. S., Minneapolis, MN 55404)

Iconoclast\Merel split 7" - The Iconoclast side isn't as good as the 7", 
but Merel just blows me away.  Their song is kind of odd, really original.  
It's a narrated story accompanied by Merel's screamy thrashings.  Totally 
awesome. ($3, Iconoclast\Old Glory Records, 5 White Oak Dr., Colts Neck, 
NJ 07722)

Sawhorse 7" - Kind of rocking, mid-paced hardcore.  Different.   Oddly 
catchy. ($2.5, Ebullition Records, above)

V\A - International Underground Pop Festival LP - A really strong comp, with 
a lot of poppy, punky and fucked up music.  It's all live, recorded at the 
convention in Olympia, Washington.   Just a heartbeat away from Seattle!  
Tell all your trendy friends!  Includes tracks from Fugazi, L7, Melvins, 
Nation of Ulysses, Bratmobile, Courtney Love and many others. (K Records, 
P.O. Box 7154, Olypmia, WA 98507)

Nifty.  Also noteworthy: Vocalist Zack de la Rocha's old band Inside Out
[Revelation]. (Sony)

Lament - Drowning Room 7" - This is really old and probably really hard to 
find, but it's also really good.  New York hardcore with passionate singing. 
(Inner Journey, above)

Digable Planets - Reachin'(A New Refutation of Time and Space) LP - Funky, 
jazzy, pretty, cool.  I like it. (Go to Sam Goody schmuck.)

Born Against - Nine Patriotic Hymns for Children LP - My favorite band.  
'Nuff said. ($6, Vermiform, P.O. Box 1145, Cooper Station, NY, NY 10276)

Iceburn - Firon LP - This is not the same Iceburn that we heard on the 7".  
The only remaining member is the guitarist, who has taken on the vocal 
duties.  At first, I was put off by the difference, but this band is just 
as good, if not better, than the other one.  Progressive hardcore\
neoclassical\metal\funk\art-rock.   Very refined, slick and well produced.  
They'll be on a major within two years. (Victory Records)

The Hear It If You Can Dept. - Confusion, Patterns, Social Disorder, Maximum 
Penalty, Darkside



	The following is what turned out to be a massive political diatribe.  
I'm sorry if you bought this expecting to read about music and I bore the 
fuck out of you, but so much fucked up shit is going on in the world right 
now that needs addressing.  Just as I am finishing four pages on the 
nonevent in L.A., which I had intended to be my only "current events" piece, 
Dave Koresh lights himself on fire.  Then there is the ongoing fucked-upness 
of the World Trade Center bombing and it's related investigations.  Please 
read on.  Maybe you'll learn something.




                                    Rodney King 

                                  The L.A. Verdict

	It's Monday and soon the verdict comes in.  Right now, this looks 
like a lose-lose situation.  If the cops are acquitted, the LAPD can go on 
and beat the fuck out of all the niggers they want and they'll get plenty 
of chances, because there will probably be quite a bit of rioting going on, 
which will only serve to reinforce the nations stereotype of inner city kids 
as gang-banging crackheads.   If they are guilty, our justice system has 
failed.  We will have to live in a system in which public opinion can 
convict you.  No matter how protected those jurors are, their verdict will 
be influenced by the foreseen consequences.  The possibility of a national 
uprising must somehow influence the verdict.
	I, like most others, was shocked when the pigs were acquitted last 
year.  I, unlike most others, was also perfectly willing to accept that our 
justice system had failed and move on.  I find it hard to believe that the 
charges they are now being tried on had been considered before the riots.  
This trial skirts dangerously with double jeopardy.  As well as being a 
judicial faux pas, it is ridiculously ineffectual.  It is a figurehead.  
An opiate for the masses.   No matter what happens to these pigs, police 
brutality will persist.   If there are riots, or if there are none, inner 
city life will still be hopeless and decadent.  We need to concentrate on 
the real problems that underlie this case.  Let's concentrate on welfare, 
reforming the police, passing stricter brutality standards, ending racism 
and other things that will actually benefit our society much more than a 
few pigs behind bars.

              ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	The way the press acted after the L.A. riots, you would think that 
inner cities had just popped up all over the country in a week's time, 
rather than having developed slowly for the last hundred years.  This is a 
rampant tendency in journalism.  They like to pretend that nothing exists 
in America until they say so and they never say so until something 
photogenic and "news-worthy" happens.  Thus, the L.A. riots were the 
beginning of lower-class, minority rage and the Rodney King beating was 
the beginning of police brutality.
	The sad part is that the American people are shallow enough that 
they believe this bullshit.  I was aware of racism and brutality before 
Rodney King.  I was aware of poverty before the riots.  I was aware of 
sexism before Anita Hill.  I was aware of AIDS before Magic Johnson.  And 
so was the average American.   The problem is that it didn't matter.  The 
problem is that these very real problems could not assume "reality" until 
they were on television.
	Or maybe it's that our "enlightened times" aren't nearly as 
enlightened as we would like to think.  Of course AIDS didn't matter before.  
Then it was just killing faceless, nameless people.   And the celebrities?  
They were all gay.  Rock Hudson, Freddie Mercury--who cared about them?  But 
now it has affected one of our precious sports stars!  A red-blooded, 
American, heterosexual one too!  Good God.  Go fetch the research grants!  
Start up new charities!  We have an epidemic on our hands!
	American culture makes me sick.

              ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	It's Thursday now and I'm starting to get scared.  People were 
predicting a verdict as early as Tuesday, but it never came.  I can just 
imagine what's going on in that jury room.
	My mother had jury duty in federal district court about a month ago.  
The trial was for a man who might or might not have had a tiny part in a 
drug smuggling ring.  My mom firmly believed that there was not enough 
evidence to convict him.  She also had a gut instinct that he was guilty.  
The rest of the jury, except for one, thought he was guilty, period.  Well, 
the vote had to be unanimous and everybody wanted to go home, so the jury 
coerced my mother into voting not guilty, even though she felt that he 
should be acquitted.  The point of all this is that I'd imagine that this 
same thing is happening in the jury room right now.  The jurors have been 
holed up for a month and have already missed Easter.  One side has gained 
an advantage and is abusing and manipulating the other side until it finally 
gives up.  The final verdict will be a compromise and will not represent 
justice in the least.  The wonders of our court system!
	Like I said before, this trial is a lose-lose situation.  If public 
protest of an acquittal turns violent, police brutality will worsen and a 
guilty verdict means that if we can't convict them the first time, we can 
just keep trying until we reach a more acceptable conclusion.   It sounds 
pretty fascistic either way.

               ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	It's Saturday night and the verdict is in.  I haven't seen the news 
yet, but my father told me that two of the officers were convicted and the 
other two were acquitted.  What a tidy compromise.   The system appeased the 
masses without lynching itself.  It showed that white, racist pigs are not 
untouchable, but it still went easy on them.  I don't think that this will 
inspire much public outcry, unless their sentence is overly lenient or 
Reginald Denny's attackers are crucified.  Right now, everyone should be 
happy.
	In fact, I can't help wondering if this instant will end up as a 
tiny footnote in history.  I think it almost certainly will.  By the time 
you read this, you might not even remember what I'm talking about.  For a 
month, America held its breath.  Police precincts beefed up their on-duty 
officers.  We braced ourselves for a holocaust.  What we got was a gentle 
breeze.  Twenty years from now, all that has occurred surrounding the Rodney 
King beating will be a paragraph in a history text.


	Riots in L.A.   In 1991, Los Angeles police were video-taped beating
 a black motorist, whose name was Rodney King.  A year later, in the spring 
of 1992, these officers were found not guilty of use of excessive force.  In 
response to this, the lower class black people of Los Angeles rioted for 
three days, killing more than thirty people and causing millions of dollars 
of damage.  The next year, the officers were put on trial in a civil rights 
case and two of them were found  guilty.


	What the paragraph won't include, if it wants to be used in American 
school systems, is that at the moment in which the not guilty verdict was 
handed down last year, something clicked.  Something clicked in the 
collective consciousness of lower-class, black America and it realized that 
it's end of the stick was smaller.   It felt an overwhelming fear.  A fear 
that any white racist pig could do anything he or she  wanted and there was 
not one thing any individual could do about it.  And that fear spilled into 
the streets of L.A.  Suddenly George Bush and white, upper-class America 
were afraid too.  None of that will be noted, or even implied, in 
conventional history books.

            ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	Reading that last paragraph, you might think that I hate myself, or 
that I feel a good bit of white guilt, and I probably should, but I don't.  
I'm white, male and as middle-class as they come.  I've never known poverty, 
sexual discrimination, subtle or not so subtle racism. I have the 
unfortunate privilege of being unrestricted by society.  I have no glass 
ceilings.  I am favored by a racist, sexist society, but I refuse to use 
this privilege.  I refuse to allow myself the luxury of my arbitrary 
"advantage".  I certainly benefit from it in ways that I cannot control, 
but the fact is that I cannot help what I am, just like everyone else.  So 
I don't judge people on what they were born like and I  expect that they do 
the same for me.

            ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	I guess the only people that are really steaming about the L.A. 
verdict are the executives at CNN and the networks.


No riots + no flaming buildings + no massive protests = 
		nothing to keep us glued to the television for days on end






                                 Waco's Burning

	Two months ago, federal officers stormed the compound of David 
Koresh's Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Texas.  The media has reported that 
the sect had been stockpiling weapons, leading the government to put them 
under surveillance.  Apparently, the officers had decided that these people 
were a threat.  Well, when the officers stormed the compound the sect members
 fought back, killing several officers.  The officers retreated, leading to 
the standoff that lasted until today.  This morning, realizing that he would 
not escape alive Dave Koresh lit the compound on fire.  It is assumed that 
he and more than ninety of his followers burned with it.
	People are acting like this is a tragic victory.  That is what the 
government and the FBI want us to feel.  They want us to think Mr. Koresh 
and his followers got what they deserved.  Only the children are deserving 
of pity, they claim.
	Bullshit.
	First lets get the facts straight.  The officers claimed that they 
stormed the compound because the sect had been stockpiling weapons.  It was 
never made clear what sort of weapons.  Were these weapons illegally 
obtained?  This was never stated in the media.  It was only stated that 
they had guns.  Remember--this is in Texas, where there are two guns for 
every person and gun laws are practically nonexistent.
	The FBI claims that the Branch Davidian sect came under close 
scrutiny when a parcel addressed to the compound and containing grenades 
just happened to open in the Post Office.  The Postal employees then alerted 
the police.  Why can I picture the package "just opening" while there 
happened to be a federal officer with a razor blade standing above it?
	Okay, now the officers storm the compound.  Five of them are shot 
and killed.  This fact never failed to get mentioned in any story relating 
to the sect.  It was rarely, if ever mentioned how many of the sect members 
were killed.  Six of them died in the shoot-out.  One of those who died was 
Mr. Koresh's daughter.   Several of the sect members were wounded as well, 
including Dave Koresh.  I guess an officer's death matters more than that of 
a Branch Davidian wacko, which brings me to my next point...
	The media and the public have already judged and crucified Dave 
Koresh because he believes he is the son of God.  He may have never 
committed a single crime, but this simple fact has convicted him.  Don't 
faithful Christians realize that this same thing happened to Jesus of 
Nazareth two thousand years ago?  The Romans thought he was a loon so they 
crucified him.  Don't you ever wonder if mankind's savior is lying straight-
jacketed in a mental hospital somewhere, because everyone thinks he or she 
is a loon?  And maybe the son of God burned himself today, because of 
American small-mindedness and skepticism.
	The point is not that he might in fact be the product of a divine 
power, but that our Judeo-Christian culture is too narrow to accept someone 
else's viewpoints.  Thus any person who has a faith other than what is 
accepted as "American"(i.e., Islam, Branch Davidian, Scientology, 
agnosticism, etc.) must be crazy or brainwashed.
	The members of the Branch Davidian sect are not brainwashed.  Not 
anymore than a Catholic who goes to Church every week and follows the letter 
of the two thousand year old document called the Bible or the priest who 
pledges to a life of celibacy.  All religion requires brainwashing.  In 
order to establish faith, you must first accept certain beliefs that may 
not make logical, empirical sense.
	Religion is like geometry.  In order to create a religion or a 
geometry, you must begin with undefinable terms.  From this, you can draw 
conclusions that make sense.  Thus, all followers of all religions are brainw
ashed somewhat.  The members of the Branch Davidian sect have profound faith 
in Mr. Koresh and they cannot be faulted for that any more than any other 
religious person.
	The government, the FBI and the media want you to believe that Dave 
Koresh was a psycho.  They want you to believe that he forced his followers 
to remain in the compound with him.  They even want you to believe that it 
was members of the sect who lit the fire.  For all we know, Mr. Koresh may 
have been(or may be) a perfectly rational man, who had the wrong ideas.  He 
may have inspired ninety people so much that they were willing to die for 
him.  His and their death may also not have been of their own choice.   	This morning, officers announced to Mr. Koresh that all negotiations were off and that the sect members were to come out with their hands up.  Just after noon, someone set a fire.  It might have been Branch Davidians who believed that dying would be more prudent than giving up, or it might have been a federal officer who couldn't stand to see a man with a different belief system live.  All we have is the government's word and we know what that's good for don't we?

             ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	I was much too hasty in stating that David Koresh lit himself on 
fire.  All the survivors of the holocaust(how appropriate, given that this 
is the week of the anniversary of the holocaust and the Holocaust Museum is 
being dedicated) claim that the fire was set by the FBI tanks when they were 
punching holes in the walls of the compound.
	The FBI claims that one of its agents heard a cult member scream,
"The fire's been set!".  This is used as proof of FBI innocence.  I can't 
help wondering how similar that would sound to "A fire's been set!", 
especially when you're hearing it through a wall in an emergency situation.
	At least the media has been getting on the governments back about 
how the siege was handled.  Unfortunately, the media has also decided that 
the only ones deserving of pity are the children.  They would never 
consider that Mr. Koresh was being persecuted for his religious beliefs.
	What did Mr. Koresh ever do to make anyone think he was a psychopath.
  He was a religious fanatic to be sure, but he was also a religious fanatic 
who was being held hostage by a fascist government.   One editorial writer 
went so far as to call him a murdering psychopath.  Some people can be so 
ignorant.

                             Stop racist frame-up
	The U.S. government's witch hunt against Mohammed Salameh, a 25-
year-old Palestinian born in Israeli-occupied territories on the West Bank 
is reminiscent of the days of the rabid anti-Communist McCarthyite hearings 
of the 1950s.
	Salameh was arrested March 4 in connection with the Feb. 26 
explosion at the World Trade center.
	The FBI is trying its casein the media through innuendo and racism.
	"They're trying to put it on the Muslims.  We are a scapegoat," said 
a member of the Abu Bakr mosque in Brooklyn, NY, the day after Salameh was 
arrested.  "Yesterday, you heard them[FBI officials] say it will take a 
month before they find out what really happened.  Today, out of nowhere 
they arrest somebody.   Come on."
	Isn't it a reasonable possibility that the dangerous health and 
safety violations inside the World Trade Center--which will cost $80 million 
to repair--could be responsible for the explosion?
	The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an autonomous agency 
that owns the World Trade Center is exempt from New York City fire codes.  
The Trade Center buildings lack the basic safety features of battery powered 
exit lights, required in other smaller buildings.
	In 1983, two people were killed when the ceiling collapsed in Jersey 
City's Port Authority-run train station because the screws wee inadequate.
	Since the explosion has been characcterized as a terrorist 
bombing, insurance companies can look to the federal government to absorb 
most of the estimated $1.1 billion in damages to the owners of the World 
Trade Center.  That transfers into having the taxpayers absorb the cost.
	The U.S. government has an ignominious history of engineering 
political frame-ups that coincide with international policy.
	The Palestinian community in this country has been the focus of 
much government harassment.  In January 1987, seven Palestinian men and 
one Kenyan woman--the L.A. 8--were arrested in southern California.  They 
were held in maximum security without bail for three weeks on charges that 
they were national security risks--charged with supporting Palestinian 
freedom.
	Remember the media furor over "Libyan hit squads"?  In late 1981, 
the U.S. government swore that a team of Libyan assassins, assisted by 
"East German terror experts" reputedly organized by the Soviet Union, had 
infiltrated this country armed with surface-to-air missiles.  When the 
fantasy never materialized, did the media admit it?   No.
	We view the arrests and round-up of people in the Arab and Muslim 
community with the greatest skepticism.  Those who have been arrested are 
being convicted in the news media, which precludes the possibility of a fair 
trial.

ON A FINAL POLITICAL NOTE: If you think that the preceding articles were 
excessively paranoid towards the media, government and corporate America, 
I invite you to read some of the works of Noam Chomsky.  He is a well 
renowned genius, who has made ground-breaking discoveries in many fields, 
most notably in linguistics.  He is also a long-standing radical and 
dissident.
	The two books of his that I have read are Terrorizing the 
Neighborhood, which is about the U.S. government's control of "democracy" 
in Central America and Necessary Illusions, about the media's role in 
preventing democracy.
	His books are available from South End and Pressure Drop presses 
and can be bought, along with lots of cool records, zines and T-shirts 
from Blacklist Mailorder, a non-profit collective from San Francisco.  
Support non-profit record stores and support the grass-roots hardcore

WARNING:  Generic vegetarian information.  May be harmful to your meat-
eating
	
	When I first sat down to write this zine, I made a conscious 
decision not to include lots of vegetarian information.  I felt and still 
do feel that this information can be obtained from any number of sources, 
all of which would be better informed and more sincere than I.  But, I also 
realized something else--the first time I was exposed to vegetarianism was 
through a zine.  It was one of the first zines I ever read and, to me, these 
ideas were fresh and new.  Even though that zine was probably repeating 
what a thousand others had already said, it didn't matter to me, because I 
wasn't aware of anything but that zine.  Not to sound too melodramatic, but 
that zine changed my life.  So, on the assumption that someone out there is 
reading their first zine, I will say my two cents about vegetarianism.
	Instead of writing a long essay on the evils of carnivores, I will 
simply explain why it is all right to be a vegetarian.  That is to say that 
I will quickly debunk a few of society's myths.  The following is adapted 
from a New Jersey Animal Rights Alliance flyer called "Tossing Out Some Myths
About Vegetarianism", by Alex Hershaft, Ph.D.

1.   Vegetarians don't get enough protein.  Sorry guys, but the sad fact is 
that a vegetarian can easily get as much protein as a meat-eater.  The 
difference is that meat contains protein and fat, cholesterol, pesticides 
and antibiotics.
2.   Vegetarians need to be careful.  Nutritionally, not eating meat 
requires no special precautions as long as a balanced diet is followed.  
The only thing vegetarians need be careful of is putting the medical care, 
life insurance and meat processing industries out of business.
3.   Eating meat is nature's way.  Actually the human body is designed for 
a herbivorous diet.  Our flat, wide teeth, weak stomach acids and long 
digestive tracts are just right for a vegetable diet and all wrong for a 
meaty one.
4.   Farm animals are bred for food, so it's all right to kill them.  Were 
slaves meant to be enslaved?  That's called a cop-out.
5.   If vegetarianism is so good for you, the medical establishment would 
come out in support of it.  Researchers have been slowly realizing for the 
past thirty years that meat is a lethal part of the American diet, but the 
meat industry doesn't want you to know that.  Lobbying groups sponsored by 
the meat industry are what kept the FDA's food pyramid, which recommended 
that meat intake be decreased, delayed from release last year.  The dairy 
industry sponsors most of the nutritional information that is distributed 
to public schools.  The meat industry would be crippled by a massive 
conversion to vegetarianism.  Just remember, not eating meat does not hurt 
Farmer Bob and Bessie the Cow, who live and work on five acres in Missouri.  
It hurts multi-millionaires who make money off animal suffering.

	Please, I urge you to take the time to write one of the 
organizations below.  It will only cost you a stamp.  Well, actually, two 
stamps, since they would probably appreciate a stamp or self-addressed 
stamped envelope for their reply.  Even if you plan on staying a meat-eater, 
you should take the time to write these people.  They will send you tons of 
helpful information.  You deserve to know.

	It's called doublethink and it's one of the most important reasons
I can think of that you should get off your ass and read.  The word comes 
from George Orwell's 1984.  It means to accept everything that the 
government tells you as true, despite any obvious contradictions or lies.  
To do this, the individual must accept that everything the government does 
is good and virtuous and that the government is infallible.  Thus, the 
individual subconscious must weed out knowledge and awareness of the 
government's lies.
	There are two sides to every story, but as long as I give you one, 
you're happy.
	Iraqi soldiers were teenagers and kids.  Remember the newscasters 
bragging?  The United States Army was superior to Iraq's because Saddam 
Hussein forced children to serve in the army and gave them no training.  
All right!  America's #1!
	Aren't those the people we killed?  A hundred thousand of them.  
As well as the innocent citizens of Baghdad.
	Doublethink.
	Two sides.
	We have to read.  We have to educate ourselves.  Stephen King isn't 
good enough.  Neither is Danielle Steele.  Get off your ass and read about 
what matters.  Go read literature.  Not the sterilized shit they cram down 
your throat at school, but the real deal--Boroughs, Kerouac, Orwell.
	Nonfiction!
	The television does not educate it leaches.  You need to be rich 
to get on TV.  You need a few paychecks to put out a book.  The only way 
to change is to know.

               ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	I want to live in a society that doesn't discriminate based on age, 
race, sex or sexual orientation.  A society that accepts people who are 
different.  I want to live in a society where people are left alone to do 
what they please.  A society where people don't have a need or want to hurt
and kill each other.  A society free from greed.  A society free from 
poverty, hate and addiction.
	I know that I will never see this society, but I am going to work 
until I die to see at least part of it.  How can I accomplish this?  How 
can other like-minded people help me accomplish this?  I don't know exactly.  
I'll tell you how we won't.
	We won't accomplish any change in our current society if we follow 
its rules and take on its shortcomings.  Our society is violent.  
Can we affect a change in it with violence?  No.  Our society is hateful.  
Can we overcome it with our own hate?  No.  Our society is elitist.  Can we 
transform it by forming our own elite?  No.
	We must show the world that people can live without hurting each 
other.  We must show that people can live in peace.  We will fight back 
with nonviolence.  We will fight back with love.  We will crush its 
rigidness with the sheer force of our acceptance.
	Stop fighting.  Stop beating the shit out of people who share common 
goals.  Stop looking at everyone with disgust.  Hostility towards people 
who have not wronged you is pointless.  You turn them away instead of 
opening their eyes.
	Go out and change the world.  Bring some friends with you.

She has set me free
Free to dream

Free to dance
Free
Sing

The chains have been cast
The clouds have been lifted
I can
Breathe

Breathe

Breathe
Deep
Take it in

The sweet air
Taste it
See the sun
Feel Warmth

Warmth

The sky
Heaven

My heart
Hers
Don't let it get cold
It happened once
It can happen again
No
Hold it to the sun
Be careful
If it freezes you'll die
She'll die

				Left
Left
Behind, Alone
A solo grape
Could jump back in
But don't want to lie
Just don't feel right
Something inside
Pretend
No
Left
Aside, One
Just the blue crayon without the other 7
I was here first
Don't know what to say
Could try to understand
Isolated again
Hurt
Yes
Left
Black, Crying
A broken heart
There is no glue
Could lead somewhere else
Don't want to
Want my own stuff back
They took it away
Scared
Yes
Left
I can't describe
Left
What I feel is very real to me
Lost
Yes
Left
Can you understand?
Don't want to say the wrong thing
Missed out on this part of your life
Yes
Left
It's not your fault
I blame you
No
Don't get mad
Trying to deal
Yes
Left
Let's hope not for long
Left
In the background, In the wind

				Find the Way
If only,
I could understand,
I knew why.
Why she did this,
To us.
Why did she drive a dagger,
Through the one thing,
The most precious of all things,
Which I hold so sacred.
With words so harsh,
Words so strong,
That not the power of a tornado,
Could tear them from the core of my soul,
And throw them back at her,
As if to say that I do not care.
But caring is the mere beginning,
Beginning of the long journey,
Whose destination is love.
I love all things.
Even the producer of my tears.
These tears drip off my chin,
Falling like a fountain of guilt.
Guilt for not being the person,
The person who she can love.
For if you love,
You must love all things.
There is so much hate,
It lives inside her,
In a place where I once found life,
It is for so many things surrounding my heart.
Compassion is lost.
Lost in the throwing of cruel words,
Lost in the demolishing of feelings.
Lost in a cold, dark place,
Yet it must be strong.
Only then can it find its way.
And along with this compassion,
This love,
I pray, 
That I too,
Can find my way back.
Back to my mother.
-Marisa


				Chaos
Boxes of chaos
Controlled
Discrete units of infinity
The fractals of life
Like peanut butter
Chained
A prison of mulch
Boxes of chaos
Where one cannot love
The other
Trapped in a box
Aluminum siding
At right angles
Live in a box
Grow in a box
Work in a box
Of chaos
Boxy cars
Petrol reactions
All contained within a box
Controlled by a lack of control
Helpless
But clean
A box in your head
To keep all your big ideas
Chained
Reject
Deny
Control
Defy
Why cry?
Let it
Chaos upon chaos
A chaotic order
Don't fool yourself
Let it
Fibrillations
Sensations
Opened wide
Feel it
Swallow it
Bathe in it
Breathe it
Let it
Peace
-Chris



The walls are up again
left from the struggle fought back then
pain inside keeps us out
our frustration is what we shout
shout it at our wall
no one will ever respond at all
feelings of anguish which they use to bind us
images of color which are there to blind us
it makes me angry cause they cannot see
the walls they've formed around you & me
