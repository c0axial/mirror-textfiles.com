1: Introduction
===============
  
    Welcome to another issue of RICUS! 
    
    This issue should really have been called the RI library special edition,
since the entire issue consists of information on the RI state libraries and
their computers. Most of what you'll see is pretty interesting, especially the
info you'll read on the DSLS BBS system (LORI.)

    Enjoy...
     
                          The Implementor

2: Deciphering the CLAN Barcode
===============================
Lesson two on your local library, by the CLANMAN
                                    eDITED bY mR X

                 Deciphering the CLAN barcode/number.

But first...a word from our sponsors:

                    Waz'up wid de CLAN network.

    Well, apparently the CLAN folks have discovered my hack. But, 
thankfully, they didn't beef up the security on the P.A.M.s, probably 
because they are so benign to security. (You can't trash patron records
with them.) But, on the other hand, one of my friends who has access to
staff bulletins said that security was tightened unexplainably around
March 20-27th. She said that the only modules affected were the circulation
and patron records. If you're a librarian, and you've got a copy of the new
password sheet, ask the RICUS editor how to contact me. I'd really appreciate
it. Be advised, that I won't reprint the circ codes publicly, becuase people
who ruin our hack reputation might damage the system or invade privacy. I
simply like to be up to speed on the happenings in the CLAN, because I
am very interested in library automation and its uses. Whenever the
CLANlords (Bennett, Halliday, and the rest) change things around, it
annoys me, because I am a benign hacker with no intent to do harm.
Hacking the CLAN just helps me understand this fabulous net further.
    Lastly, sorry about this being so late. Even though I promised my
good friend Mr X that I'd get this to him by June, since I got home
from school in May. But as any of you fellow students know, education
is expensive (for high schoolers: start saving now) and I've been
working my butt off - flipping burgers. So that's why I didn't have
time to finish this. But I'd like to thank Mr X for his editing work
on my stories.

Okay, down to the feature segment:

THE secret TO THE LIBRARY BARCODE SYSTEM

1 March 1993

    I'm sure that you have a library card, if you don't go down to the
local public library...they're free if you pay taxes. Once you have
your card, take it out and flip it over, you should see a bar code on
the top. (If you don't know what a barcode is, it looks like sort of
like the UPC code on groceries). Under the bar code is seemingly
undecipherable blurb of numbers, here is the "secret" to cracking the
numerical code:

    The first number tells what type of bar code the computer is
reading. Library cards have a "2" on them and loanable items have a
"3". Following this number is a four digit number, this is the library
code. Cranston's code is 1450, Pawtucket's is 1218, and Warwick's is
2080. Now on your library card, there is a set of five numbers then
four numbers, this is your ID number.

    So, a legitimate library card for say, Cranston, may read 2 1450
00021 1234. A Warwick card may read 2 2080 00099 1234.

    To sum up:
                           THIS IS THE REAR OF YOUR LIBRARY CARD:
    _______________________________________________________
    I                                                     I

    I_____________________________________________________I


                               This is the "Zebra" code on a book:

     ________________________________
     I Yourtown Public Library      I

        I   I      I
      Type  I      I--Book code
            I
         Library ID


A few library ID codes:

Pawtucket: 1218

Warwick: 2080

Cranston: 1450

Providence: 1116

North Providence: 4859

The other numbers are attainable by stopping by a library and looking
at a book's barcode or by examining different library cards. If you
want all of the codes, virtually all of the public libraries have a
sheet marked "Zebra Codes" or something to that effect. This list has
all of the state, public and college library code numbers. But, this
list is usually only accessable to staff. But, fear not...thanks to a
few friends, in the next issue of RICUS, there will be a full sheet
listing the CLAN libraries, their RILN identifiers, logins, and
barcodes. [Editor's Note: The list of library logins was published in
the last issue. A local user was able to obtain it himself.]

    This barcode system is very common throughout the library world,
and identical stickers are found in many states. But, for simplicity's
sake, I only included the CLAN's use of the system.

II. How to make a duplicate library card for a dollar:

    If you constantly loose things, and have gotten sick of constantly
forgetting your library card, here is how to get a duplicate for the
measly price of a dollar.
    Get a CLAN card and use it legitimately. Then, go to your library
and say you lost your card. With a dollar, they'll grant you a new one,
and erase your old card number.
    Now, go home and take out your old CLAN card. Using a razor blade,
scrape the old barcode off the rear. Once it is cleared off,
photocopy the barcode of the new one onto a sheet of sticky paper (the
kind stickers are punched out of, or that some people use for cassette
or disk labels.) Check the resolution; if you use a crappy
photocopier,a blurred barcode will not be readable by the computer.
Now carefully cut out the photocopied sticker to the dimensions of the
real sticker and put it onto your old card. Then carefully match its
appearance to that of the legitimate card. This'll give you two
identical CLAN cards. But, do not give copies out to other people,
since any of their overdo books will appear on your account, which
will prevent you from borrowing books. As far as I know, it is
perfectly legal to have a duplicate library card for your own use. It
is risky, however, since it increases the chance for fraud. Since the
library doesn't want you to get ripped off by a crook, they don't
issue backup cards. 

IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THROUGH SOURCES AT CRA THAT PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN CUTTING BARCODES OUT OF BOOKS. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY BE A PERSON
MANUFACUTURING FAKE CARDS OR ENGAGING IN OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIONS. BE
AWARE OF WHAT BOOKS YOU TAKE OUT, IN CASE THIS IS A SECURITY BREECH.
LASTLY, IF YOU ARE THE PERSON CUTTING OUT BARCODES, STOP IT, AS YOUR
IDENTITY WILL SOON BE FOUND.

III. RILA bulletins pertainant to CLAN hackers. If you're interested
in library automation,  go to your local library's periodicals section
and ask for:

1.    Rhode Island Library Association Bulletin November/December '92
        
        This RILA bulletin's primary feature article is CLAN, and its
switch to Dynix. It's in an interview format with the CLAN president.
There aren't any access secrets or the like, but it's cool since it
tells the history of CLAN.                          

2.    Rhode Island Library Association Bulletin January/February '93

        The main topic for this one is libraries and the Internet (heh
heh heh). It talks about the history of Internet and how the 'net
might of use to libraries (and to us?).


                                                    Have Fun,


                                                    The 
                                               ______
                                               I
                                               I
                                               I_____ l a n M A N

A Special Thanks to those great librarians and tech services people
who give me the info I need.


[A little correction: In a previous issue of RICUS Journal, the
editor pointed out that the libraries may be switching systems. The
DYNIX system is the new system, as it replaced a really trashy
software package that was made by CLSI and was what CLAN had ran for
years before the DYNIX transfer this summer. If you noticed, in
July/August 1992 the CLAN terminals were down for about two months or
so, this was why. 
    (For more info, see RILA Bulletin N/D 1992.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Editors Commentary: Thanks again, ClanMan, I too am interested in the technical
workings of the library system. What we REALLY need is a dynix shell account.
As you probably know, Dynix is just a type of UNIX system. If one of the locals
more skilled in UNIX (heh heh heh..) had obtained a shell account, wonderful
things could be set up on these terminals and be accessed state wide. Imagine
a "CLANdestine" (heh) BBS set up on the library terminals!

 Recently, we have obtained information relating to the Department of State
Library Services and Internet. We have another library system dialup exposed
in the next article. Enjoy!

3: DSLS Library BBS Exposed
===========================

                ----------------------------------------
                DSLS Library of Rhode Island BBS Exposed
                ----------------------------------------
                
                       =========================
                       >>  A RICUS Exclusive  <<
                       =========================        

 This file was captured and given to RICUS. It was allegedly taken from 
internet node dsl.rhilinet.gov, a VAX/VMS computer headquartered at the RI
Dept of State Library Services. It is a fully functional public access BBS,
referred to affectionately as LORI (Library of Rhode Island.) 

 It is interesting to note that this VAX system is running a dirivative
of the same BBS software being run on the IDS BBS system. 

 If you log into this system, be warned it'll probably be watched even more 
heavely after they find out all the local modem kiddies know about it. Have
fun...

[Update: Apparantly, some overzealous abusers used the system to send FTP
 mail to Eagles Nest, causing the sysadmin(s) at DSLS to be alerted that
 it was being abused. As a result, free abuse of the internet is no longer
 possible (until a BBS account is somehow obtained.) Security of DSLS was
 greatly improved. I hope this serves as a lesson to the offending abuser,
 [you know who you are.] Your actions may have ruined the future usefulness
 of this system for others -- there were other publically accessable systems
 you could've EASILY sent FTP mail from. ]

 This file "CLANDIAL.DIR" was in the "Public Workspace" file transfer
area on the dsl.rhilinet.gov BBS. The acquirer of this file logged in
under a GUEST account and captured the file.

------------------------ capture: clandial.dir --------------------------------
DIAL-IN ACCESS TO CLAN
     
     Using your own telecommunications software, set the terminal
emulation type to VT100.  You must set your terminal to the
following settings: Data bits=8, Parity=none, and Stop bits=1.
The following options should be turned off:
Local echo, Xon/Xoff, RTS/CTS, CR to CR/LF, Line wrap,
Destructive BS

Set the baud rate at 1200, 2400, 4800 or 9600.

Call DSLS at  the following  number:
               831-4640
and press <enter>. If this is a long-distance call, 
please contact any member of the DSLS Network Group: Dorothy
Frechette, Howard Boksenbaum, Sheila Carlson, Jeffrey Vale, or
Andrew  Egan at 277-2726 for a toll-free number.   

When the connection is made you will see the message:

PLEASE TYPE CALL CLAN OR CALL DSLS
Port xx

CLAN OR DSLS

(For the following directions, the actual letters that you should
type are in quotes.  Please assume that after you type these
letters, you should press enter, or return.  Type everything in
lower case; in some instances it matters, and in some it doesn't,
so it is just easier that way.)

     Type: "call clan"  If you get a notice of  "Procedure
error," type "call clan" again, s-l-o-w-e-r.  When you get a
message, "CLAN or DSLS CONNECTED," press <enter> a few times and
be patient, it may take a few seconds before you get another
prompt.  At the login: prompt, type "library".  If you receive a
Password: prompt, press Enter, Return, and you should then get
the Login: prompt.

The screen will ask for your emulation, type "1" for VT100 and
"y" when it asks you if the screen was readable.  Press Enter at
the picture of the catalog, and you will be in the DSLS Public
Access Module.  Note that when you have called up an item and
there are no copies at DSLS, you can press Enter to see copy
status at other CLAN libraries.  

When you are finished searching press "14" to log off.  Once you
get the "logged off" message, please remember to hang up using
the commands specified in your telecommunications software, or if
you then wish to connect to LORI, hold down the control key while
typing "p" and then type "clr" and press <enter>.   Please
remember to hang up using the commands specified in your 
telecommunications software.
 
--------------------- end of capture: clandial.dir --------------------------

 Common sense dictates you'll need to type "call dsls" after connection to
get to the VAX system. The system is referred to as "Library of Rhode Island"
in the login. The "CLAN" system is the usual book-look-up system discussed
in previous issues of RICUS.

  There is a BBS on the DSLS VAX/VMS. As I wrote in the opening paragraph, this
system is on the Internet and has the name "dsl.rhilinet.gov" It says its for
"Library employees" only <snicker> Well, sorry guys, but its not anymore.
Apparantly, they wanted to keep this number secret or something. I think it
should be in the public BBS list, along with all the other CLAN numbers. Public
libraries are "public" institutions. Well then, now so are there computers!

  The DSLS system gives detailed instructions in the login message, but in case
someone removed them, login as "GUEST" to make a new account. Users of IDS
will find this software very familiar. Infact, it's an exact duplicate of the
IDS BBS software. Oh yeah, when it asks where you found out about the system,
say you found it in the RIBBS list or something <grin>

 Remember, your parents (or your own) taxes go to pay for these things, so why
SHOULDN'T you be able to log on to them? I see no valid reason. If you want to
get a validated account you'd probably need to get the name of a librarian or
something, since they may/may not actually check. Note, it may not be wise to
even call this thing (and clearly not use real information) after the release
of this file, since it will no doubt be flooded with calls from real & wanna-be
local hackers, cyberpunks, and weirdos, which is always good. Of course, since
early copies of this file have escaped to various users, it has ALREADY
been flooded by local hackers, cyberpunks, and weirdos...

       We are carefully examining all our current programs, as well as our

of the statewide library network - including the Library  of  Rhode 
Island and Ocean State FreeNet concepts - and   on maintaining our direct
services to special clientele such as those served by the Regional Library
for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.  We will also endeavor to maintain
the close individual contacts that many of you have enjoyed over the years
with our professional staff; however, we may not be able to continue
responding to requests for consultant services to individual libraries.  We
will try to maximize the effect of any of our consultant or continuing
education activities, and not to duplicate our efforts.  We ask your
forbearance as we go through this painful process of realignment in our

QUAHOG III NOW AVAILABLE

by Andrew Egan, Supervisor of Institutions

       The DSLS Network Team plans to distribute  the third edition of
QUAHOG (Quick Access to Holdings), Rhode Island's CD-ROM statewide library
database, toward the end of May. 

    The 1993 edition of QUAHOG contains the library records of 38 public
libraries, 2 academic libraries, 11 health science libraries, and 8 school
libraries, an increase of 16 additional libraries from the previous edition. 
There are approximately 2.6 million items in the database. The bibliographic
records and location information are current to November, 1992. Because of
the increase in libraries and records, QUAHOG will be issued in two disks. 
The first disk contains records from 1971 to 1992 and the second disk
includes records from 1970 and  earlier.  It is still possible to use a single
CD-ROM drive by switching the disks if required for  your search.  

       There are a  number of additional enhancements to the 1993 edition of
QUAHOG. In this edition, Research Level Searching is a standard option.  The
Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT are available to you as a search option.  
You may also qualify searches by publication date, language group, or media 
type.  Searches may also be expanded with a wild card character.  For example,
type wom?n to retrieve woman, women or use right hand truncation 
to retrieve singular, plural, andother word forms such as librar* to retrieve 
librarians, libraries.  Anotherenhancement is the cataloging module.  
This module allows a library to download a record from the database 
and produce a new record through copy cataloging.

[Editor's Note: Welcome to the modern age! Wildcards!]

       In addition to these enhancements, the third edition of QUAHOG will
also help libraries save money. The Department's new contract with AUTO-
GRAPHICS, INC. and OCLC includes a provision for statewide licensing with a
single annual fee paid for by the Department.  RHILINET member libraries
will not need to purchase a separate license to use QUAHOG.  Currently, this
will save $10,500 in expenditures by local libraries.  Also, RHILINET
libraries will be able to order additional disks for multiple workstations
and will not have to pay the $15.00 cost for a disk. The savings is
significant for Rhode Island libraries which use QUAHOG workstations for
public access.  

[Editor's Note: Those PC clones suck and do not qualify as "workstations"
by any means.]

 PARTNERSHIP FORMED TO BENEFIT FREENET  

       The Department of State Library Services and TechACCESS of RI  have
formed a partnership to raise funds to develop the Ocean State FreeNet. 
TechACCESS of RI , which is housed at the Department, is a non-profit
corporation whose mission is to promote and support effective access to
and application of technologies which assist individuals with disabilities
to attain maximum independence, integration, and productivity in all aspects
of life.  TechACCESS of RI operates the TechACCESS Center at the
 Department of State Library Services Barbara Wilson Reading Room as a
demonstration site for assistive technologies.

       TechACCESS of RI  and DSLS have a common goal in making information
available in electronic form.  DSLS sees in electronic information an
effective and efficient distribution system for libraries and the general
public. The welter of assistive devices for computers -- large print
operating systems, voice generation and recognition, touch screens,
special keyboard adaptations, etc., make electronic information far more
accessible to TechACCESS' clients.  Both consequently have a stake in the
FreeNet's evolution.  To date, the joint fundraising has yielded a grant of
$10,000 towards computer hardware from the New England Telephone
Company.

[Editor's Note: What the hell is a "large print operating system"? hah hah.
I think you meant big screen monitors or something. Why the hell is this thing
called a Freenet, BTW? ]

DSLS AND NEDCC AGREEMENT TO AID RI PRESERVATION EFFORT

       The Department of State Library Services and the Northeast Document
Conservation Center (NEDCC) in Andover, Massachusetts, have entered into
a formal agreement designed to provide conservation services to Rhode
Island libraries, archives, and historical societies.  

  
DSLS CLEARINGHOUSE MARKS 1ST ANNIVERSARY

       The DSLS Interlibrary Loan  Clearinghouse, which provides OCLC
interlibrary loan service for RHILINET libraries with verified author/title
ILL requests not located in Rhode Island, completed its first year of
operation in April.  The Clearinghouse processed over 2100 requests  in its
first year,  with surveyed patron response indicating high satisfaction
with the service.  
               Two developments having a major effect on the Clearinghouse
are the increase in OCLC users and the availability of dial-in access via
CLAN and LORI (the Library of Rhode Island electronic communication and
information network).  With the recent round of Sharepac grants, the number
of libraries able to make their own ILL requests directly using the OCLC
subsystem has increased by nine.  DSLS presently subsidizes the OCLC ILL
transaction costs of RHILINET libraries using OCLC either as full or
selective members.  The effect of dial-in access on the Clearinghouse is
that now any RHILINET library with a computer and a modem can call DSLS and
find locations on CLAN or HELIN and make ILL requests directly.  And while
the Clearinghouse accepts only verified requests, materials not found in
either CLAN or HELIN can be searched and verified by dialing into LORI and
telneting to library catalogs worldwide on the Internet. (Please note: 
when making ILL requests of the Clearinghouse that have been verified on
LORI, indicate both sources of information used, e.g. LORI/Lib of Congress, 
or LORI/CARL, in the area where you would normally include your
verification sources such as BIP, Readers' Guide,   etc.)

[Editor's Note: Not to mention the fact any modem-toting citizen can now dial
into CLAN/LORI (DSLS) and use it to their hearts content. I love modems. ]

 LORI NEWS NOTES

.. Breakfast with LORI: DSLS has been  scheduling   breakfast meetings at
DSLS for groups of no more than five librarians at a time to maneuver
through the Library of Rhode Island and explore the Internet.  These
sessions are not presentations but "group explorations" and participants
are asked to come with questions, problems, and particular things to search
for, as well as a willingness to "person" the keyboard. For these informal
breakfast meetings, we'll provide the coffee, and participants should bring
a brown-bag breakfast or maybe something to share.  Leave an email
message on LORI for sheilacn if you wish to register.  Registration is
essential! The sessions are  held from 8:00 to 9:30 AM.  Check for dates on
LORI (SIG #1), CLAN electronic mail, or by calling Sheila Carlson at DSLS.

..LORI.  FAQ: A document alled LORI.FAQ, or Frequently Asked Questions is
being created, to include as a text on LORI, (and to  add to as needed). If you
have any questions about LORI, or the Internet and prefer not to post them
on the main message forum, send them by email to Jeffve (Sysadmin) or
Sheilacn.  We may not know the answer but will try to find it.



DSLS NEWS NOTES

..  LSCA Grants:  The Department has sent out notices of the availability of
LSCA Title I and III grants to eligible libraries.  This year's allocations are
$5,000 for LSCA Title I grants for public library data conversion; $5,000
for LSCA Title III grants for telefacsimile equipment; and $20,000 for LSCA
Title III grants  for networks.  Applications for grants are due at DSLS by
May 21 for review May 24-28.  Awards will be made by June 1.  Data
conversion grant to schools will be made in the fall.

 .. New Telephone System Installed:  A state of the art voice mail telephone
system (Inter-tel) has been installed at DSLS, so callers will now be able to
leave recorded messages for all Department personnel.

.. Regional Library's New 800 Number:  The Regional Library for the Blind
and Physically Handicapped has a new instate toll-free number.  The new
number is 1-800-734-5141.

 Note: At the time of RICUS publication, a news article appeared in the
Providence Journal featuring Ocean State Freenet. It appeared on the front
page of the Business section, on Saturday, August 7th. The addition of this
system to RI telecom should make the coming months VERY interesting! As
usual, RICUS will provide coverage on all the flaws that are bound to be
involved with the system...

 Enjoy...

4: Obtaining CLAN Network Identifiers
===================================== 

RICUS 2.03 hosted a brief listing by yours truly.  That listing consisted of
the identifiers used by the CLAN network for various libraries and any other
sites carrying the CLAN network.

After the article went to print I recieved an onslaught of questions
regarding how I acquired the information.  *This* article will provide
you, fair user, with that knowledge.

The process is really quite simple, and requires no detailed hacking
background or elaborate knowledge of DyNIX.  You need only login and use
the system to get this information, as you shall see.

Unfortunately, a capture log is not available.  Such logs are quite choppy
due to the terminal emulation of CLAN, and I have neither the time nor the
inclination to edit one of those logs into something presentable.

However, a step-by-step tutorial *should* suffice as instructions.

And so, without further ado, here is how the identifiers may be acquired thru
simple means at the CLAN network.

(note: information on logging into CLAN can be found in RICUS 2.02, and the
2400 baud feed/identifiers list can be found in RICUS 2.03).

--- tutorial ---

Once you have completely logged in, the menu listing all the various options
for searches is displayed.  Select number three (3), the keyword search.  It
will ask you to give a keyword.  Do *not* give a garbled response, as that
will bring you back to the menu, informing you no match could be made.  If
there are multiple matches, it will ask you for additional words.  At this
point, you may put them in if you wish, but, for our purposes, you need only
hit Enter and skip by that step.  Now the fun begins.  After listing the
first few matches, it will place a prompt at the bottom of the screen, which
gives you several options.  Some will continue the list, some will quit, but
none of those are of any use to us (at present).  Once this prompt is
displayed, hit 'O' (without the quotes) for Other Locations.  At this point,
it will begin to list all of the other sites in RI that carry the CLAN
network, in no particular order.  Hit Enter to continue the listing of
identifiers, as there are quite a few of them.  All of these identifiers, you
must add 'pub' (without the quotes) as a suffix to the three-letter code for
that location.  To make the list, I merely lowercased the list, alphabetized
them, placed the 'pub' suffix at the end, and submitted the article.

--- step by step ---

1.  Select a keyword scan (option 3).

2.  Give it a keyword.  Make sure the word is something that a match will be
found for, else our purpose is defeated.

3.  If there are multiple matches, it will ask you for additional keywords to
narrow the search.  Hit Enter here, as our purposes do not require such.

4.  The list of matches will be displayed.  When the prompt to list more
matches pops up at the bottom of the screen, select O, Other Locations.

5: Closing
==========

 That's it for RICUS 2.04, guys. It wasn't a very LENGTHY issue, but I hope
it was atleast a USEFUL one. 

 Comments? Submissions? Threats on our life? 
  
 Leave them in any of the following networks, addressed to "RICUS", "Those
RICUS GuyZ", "ModEm KiddiEz", or something similar: NENet (Common Area),
FidoNet-323 (Chat Area), or numerous local boards which you believe some
of the RICUS members frequent.

 In order to make contributions easier and safer for contributors, we
present the RICUS PGP Public Key. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a great piece
of software, available for many systems (IBMs for certain) which allows you
to encrypt text so that only the recipient can read it. Download and support
PGP from a local board (make sure it's version 2.3 or greater) and use it to
encrypt files you wish to submit to us. You will then be able to post these
texts publically with greater confidence and anonymity. People might suspect
you submitted something to us, but they won't know WHAT you submitted...

Make sure you read the docs that come with PGP! When you add our key to
your keyring, answer 'yes' if it asks you to "certify" the key yourself.

Here's our key:
