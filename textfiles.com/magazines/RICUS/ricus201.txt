  1: Introduction
  ---------------
 
     Hey there!  Welcome to RICUS 2.01! In this issue, we provide
   you with some interesting information. Information can be good or bad,
   it is up to the individual user of such information to ensure that it
   is used properly. Info can also be amusing... use it wisely...    
      
     Remember, cyberspace can be fun. It can also be dangerous, excercise
   caution at all times.

  You may have noticed a change in the editing alias. Alas, we must change
 the editor alias from time to time, whether the editor changes or not!

 2: Introduction to UNIX
 ----------------------

  1.1  What is UNIX?
       -------------
      UNIX is an OS developed by AT&T in the 1970's. It's not really a
   mainstream OS like MS-DOS, though I'm sure some people will disagree
   with me on that. It is primarily used in colleges/universities and by
   businesses with the need for multiuser support.
    
     UNIX is multiuser, meaning more than one person can use the same 
   computer at the same time. This is done through terminals hooked to a
   main CPU. Modems (of course) can also be attached, to allow multiple
   users to dial-in. Many UNIX systems are also on networks.
    
     It is also multitasking. This means each user can run more than one
   program and switch between them.
   
 1.2  How do I identify a UNIX system?
      --------------------------------
      The easiest way to identify a UNIX system is by its login screen.
   Upon accessing a UNIX system, either by remote or by local terminal,
   you will see the following display (assuming you are not already
   logged on):
    
    
         generic.unix
      
         Welcome to the Generic Unix with Computer People who
         don't have a clue what they're doing!
         
         The System will be backed up around 2 pm Monday!!!
       
         login:       


   You may also see 'Login:' in place of 'login:' (notice the caps.)
   The login prompt makes it easy to distinguish a UNIX system.
   
   The login: prompt is asking you for a username. There are frequently
   default logins that come with a UNIX system, and these are sometimes
   left unpassworded, due to the incompetance of most system administrators.
   
   Some common default UNIX login names:
    
       backup
       demo
       demos  
       guest
       help
       lp
       news
       tutor
       bin   _
       uucpa  \    
       nuucp   >--|These will not give you a shell (Unless you're lucky!!)
       uucp  _/   |They will usually give you the uucico program, part
                  |of UUCP which will be covered in future chapters of
                  |RICUS UNIX tutorials.

  If the account has a password, it will give you a Password: prompt.
  Otherwise, you will be logged in.
  
  There are sometimes also other defaults, like 'games' or something,
  that the users may have installed for one reason or another.
  
  There is also sometimes another way to identify a unix system and/or
  get more info on that particular UNIX. Login as "sync" (without
  the quotes.) If it is a valid account, the system will print a message
  like this:
   
      login: sync
      SunOS Release (386STD) 4.1.3 on node generic
       
      [...and then logs you out...]
 
     Smart Admins will have gotten rid of this account, since it makes
   it really easy to make sure that a computer is, indeed, a UNIX!    
          
 2.1  The Shell
 ---  ---------
       
      After you have somehow logged into a UNIX. You will be at a Shell
  prompt. The prompt will be something like:
   
    %     
    nodename %
    /usr/user %
    etc...
     
    Whatever it is, you are most likely at a UNIX shell. Type 'pwd'
    at the shell prompt, and it'll Print your current Working Directory
                                   ^                  ^       ^
                                   
    By the way, UNIX is entirely case sensitive. 'pwd' is NOT the same
    as 'PWD', '
   
    Entering 'pwd' is the same as entering CD on an MS-DOS system, without
    any options. 
    
    The 'cd' command allows you to change directories.
    Some common UNIX commands:

    Command               Description
    ==============        ============================================
    ls                    lists files, UNIX equivelant of MS-DOS 'DIR'
    cd                    change dir, UNIX equiv of MS-DOS 'CD'
    pwd                   Prints current Working Directory (like MS-DOS
                          'CD' without any args!)
    set                   lists/sets environment vars
    echo                  prints text
    cat                   views a textfile (like MS-DOS 'TYPE')
    kermit                start kermit front end (for downloading
                          files) -- Not present on all UNIX systems
    sz                    send ZModem, sends a file FROM the UNIX
                          (Not on all UNIXes)
    rz                    recieve ZModem sends a file TO the UNIX
                          (Not on all UNIXes)
    man                   obtain help on a command
    rm                    delete/remove file
    mv                    move/rename file

    Note: Certain commands, such as sz, rz, and kermit, may not be found
          on particular UNIXes.
          
    Those are some of the more common/useful commands, which will
   allow you to obtain text, navigate directories, list them, etc.
   You can get help on a command (usually) by typing 'man command'
   without the quotes, where "command" is the command you want help
   with.

   Most commands provide a short summary of there arguments. Type
   "command -?" (without the quotes, of course!) to see this short
   arg summary.

   You can redirect the output of commands using the '>','<', and
   '>>' operators, just like MS-DOS.

   To write the output of ls /bin to a file, you could use:
   ls /bin >file

   To view this output, you could then type
   cat file

   To see a list of many other commands type "ls /bin" The directory
   /bin contains many system binaries/commands. You can also try
   "ls /usr/bin" which possibly lists additional commands.

   Try fooling around with commands and experiment. If you're reading
  this, you probably have some type of intelligence in that brain of
  yours!

            However, please remember that if you are 'borrowing'
   someones account (with their permission, of course), *never* delete
   (or modify) any files that aren't yours! This is just common courtesy.
             
    
 2.2   UNIX Directory Structure
 ---   ------------------------
  
   UNIX utilitizes a file system. At the top of this filesystem is the root
 directory. Under this root dir, there are subdirectories, subdirs within
 subdirs, files within subdirs, etc.
   The root dir is represented by a '/' (slash)
   An example unix directory tree:

                      / (root dir)
          ____ ____ __|__ ____ ____
         |    |    |     |    |    |
        usr  bin  dev   etc  var  tmp (dirs)
    ____|__ _____                  
   |   |   |     |                 
  jon mat guest games                 (sub-dirs... etc)  
                 
     In the sample directory tree above, the root dir has 3 subdirs under
  it (usr, bin, and dev.) Within usr, the 'home directories' of users
  jon, mat, and guest exist. The home directories are the dirs that the
  user is initially logged into. You can change back to your home dir
  using cd $HOME. To find out your home dir, type echo $HOME. Both at shell
  prompts.
    
    The current directory can be represented by a . (a single dot), the
  previous dir can be represented with a .. (double dot), just like
  MS-DOS! For example, say you were in directory /usr/guest. To move back
  to /usr, you could type cd /usr OR type cd .. Obviously, cd .. is 
  preferable, since it requires less typing!
   
      That's the end of RICUS Intro to Unix, Article 1. In future issues
  of RICUS, we will continue to provide you with more UNIX information.
  Article 2 will probably have information on networking, one of the most
  interesting and fun use of a UNIX.
  
   It is important to note that the BEST source of UNIX info is actual
  experience in use of Unixes!
  
 * UNIX is a trademark of Unix Systems Laboratories. (We think.)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 3: Definition of 'Hacker'
 -----------------------------

 [Editor's Note: The "RISA jihad" was in RICUS 1.03. This is a response to
  that file.]
 
 I just noticed that inane RISA jihad against "hackers".

 I'm a hacker, I do nothing wrong, and this sort of bullshit annoys me.

 A hacker is basicly a programmer who programs out of love for the
 machine/environment. Programming for its own sake. Programming as
 the ends, means, *and* justification. One who leads an e-life instead
 of an r-life. (Users don't count. Users are morons.)
 
 Granted, most people who perpetrate illegal computer-related activities 
 are hackers, merely because few others are qualified. Out of the set of
 {hackers} there is a sub-set of {criminals}. This is true of any professional
 or cultural group, even sets like {LA-cops} or {Past-Mayors-of-Providence}
 or even {Sysops-of-"ligit"-public-BBSs}. The software all you sysops are
 so worried about being broken into or abused was writen by hackers.  

 (For reference, the following is from "the jargon file", a monster
 list of hacker slang & culture that circulates the net, and is
 available in hardcopy as: _The_New_Hacker's_Dictionary_.)  

 hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
    1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
    systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
    users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
    programs enthusiastically (even obsessively), or who enjoys
    programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
    person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who
    is good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular
    program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in
    `a UNIX hacker'.  (Definitions 1 to 5 are correlated, and people
    who fit them congregate.)  6. An expert of any kind.  One might
    be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
    intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
    limitations.  8. (deprecated) A malicious meddler who tries to
    discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence
    `password hacker', `network hacker'.  See {cracker}. 


  That's all. Now go back to sleep.

 4: Call Back Verifiers
 ----------------------
 
    
                By-Passing Those Darn Call Back Verifiers!
                ==========================================           
 
   Over the past few years, BBS software has matured and Call Back Verifiers
 have become common place. 
 
   Initially, one would think CBVs would put an end to fake accounts. Afterall,
 they have to disconnect, dial YOUR number, and connect to you, right?
   And once your number is divulged, it isn't much trouble to find out
  who you are, right?
  
  Wrong.  Over the past few months, certain modemers of the demented 
  persuasion have figured out how to avoid these horrid devices.
  
  The key is to keep the BBS modem (that's SUPPOSEDLY going to disconnect
  and call you back) from disconnecting.
  
  In order to do this, you need to have an actual phone as an extension
  on your data line, and relatively close to the modem.
  If your voice line IS your data line, this shouldn't be much of a problem.
  
  Step 1) Create the account, use an alias, whatever. If the Sysop is
          watchful (in other words: always by the computer), make sure
          your account appears to have a real name.
       
       2) (Fairly obvious :) Use _fake_ phone numbers. Give it a real
          prefix (first 3 digits) and area code, however. IE: 401-273-xxxx,
          location Providence, would satisfy a quick glance by most sysops.
          
       3) The system will say something like. "I am now going to hang up
          and call you back." 
          Quick! Before the BBS can disconnect, *pick up your phone*
          and *shut off your modem*, with the phone still off hook,
          turn the modem back on.
          
          Now, listen to the phone. You will either here the BBSes
          modem trying to disconnect, or dead silence.
          
          Wait a few seconds. You will either
            1) Hear kind of LOUD clicks.
            2) Hear the BBSes modem dialing out.
            3) Hear a "That call can not be completed.."
                      "You need more digits.."
                      <dialtone>, etc.
           
            In case 3, you have failed. This BBS most likely has a
           good phone line (or something) and won't allow these tricks 
           to work. Move onto another BBS.
           
           In case 1, the BBS is LOOKING for a dialtone. Hold down
           "1" on the touchtone pad. This usually fools dumb modems
           into thinking there is a dialtone. You should then hear
           the BBSes modem dialing "your" number.
           
           In case 2, the BBS thinks it has a dialtone, and is trying
           to dial you. Wait til it finishes.
           
       4) Type ATA, your modem will answer (as if it had been called
          by the BBS) and the BBS will procede, thinking it has, indeed,
          "verified" and called you back, when it never really disconnected!
          Enter your password and all that, you are validated.. with a 
          seemingly legit fake account! Congratulations!
            
       It has yet to be determined which systems are vulnerable/which are
       not. It has been noted that E-Nest BBS is *NOT* vulnerable to
       such tricks. :( How sad. 
       
       The key to this trick is keeping the connection. The majority of
       phone calls can not be hung up on unless the *Caller* hangs up
       first, or the person being called hangs up for about 90 seconds.
       
       This trick works for around 2 out of 3 BBSes.
        
     
   This trick is primarily useful for gaining access to message networks
   (ie, NE-Net, Fido-323, etc.) that are not tolerant of aliases, and
   watching them bitch, cry, and moan about how we are all no-brainers
   and stuff.
   
   This trick is also useful, of course, for obtaining more download
   credits, more game time, etc.
   
   Be smart! DON'T log in with your "fake" account after you immediately
   use up the time on your real one! It doesn't take a genius to notice
   that they're _probably_ the same person! Especially since they're
   calling at the same baud rate!
 
   Many 401 systems are vulnerable -- A list of these systems would be
   released, but it places certain sysops at an unfair advantage.
   
   Because of this vulnerability, every local network, that doesn't
   "want" aliases, is open to alias postings.
   
   Have fun guys...

 [Editors Note: Yes, that *was* idiotic! I wouldn't normally put that in,
                but in the intererest of free expression... no matter how
                tasteless!]

 Special thanks to Squinky for abusing FrontDoor and acquiring a 
 new Nodelist for us, at 14,400 bps, no less!
 
 Note: What use is this? I thought they passworded most of the Fido 
       links! Well, yes! They did! Hint: Even *with* PWs, FD technology

 8: Radio Scanning 
 -----------------
   
  First off: What *is* a scanner? A radio scanner is a radio reciever that
  allows you to scan a range of frequencies and pick out 'active' ones, and
  recieve/listen to them.
   
  We're not talking about your FM radio here, folks! We are talking about
  scanners that let you pick up police, fire, medical, taxi cab, amateur
  radio, cordless phone, and even cellular phone transmissions.
 
     According to a Privacy Act (1974? 1986? One of those, anyways.) It
  is illegal to listen to cellular phones. However, we here at RICUS
  embrace the policy that any frequency passing through your home and
  through your *body*  (doing who knows WHAT to it! ;) should be allowable to
  listen to. These laws are unenforcable, however, since unless you go
  open your window and shout "I listen to cellular..." no ones going to
  know.  Just remember, it IS illegal to listen to cellular frequencies
  (infact, many scanners do not allow these frequencies to be entered),
  so if (however unlikely!) you do get caught doing it for some idiotic
  reason, RICUS and it's editor(s) are not responsible.
   
      Well, first off: Get a radio scanner. You can find them in your
   local electronics store, Rat Shack, etc. or you can go mail order.
   Take a look in some of the Amateur Radio Magazines like Popular
   Communications and 73 for some mail order places.
   
     There are many different types of scanners to choose from. There are
  portable/battery powered (most, if not all portables, use rechargable
  batt. packs.) There are also "base" models, that plug into the wall. There
  are also mobile models that go permanantely in a car.
    
    I recommend the portable/handheld models... since you can carry them
  with you, put them in your car, etc. Note that in some states it's against
  the law to have scanners in your car. One could argue that it's 
  unconstitutional, idiotic, moronic, etc. but from one of the Popular
  Communications mags, this isn't the case in RI... you can have a scanner
  in your car without any problems. PopComm is a fine magazine, if your
  interested in HAM radio, shortwave, scanners. Also, try to find a scanner
  that's able to pick up many different bands (ranges of frequencies), the
  more frequencies a scanner can pick up, the cooler the stuff you can listen
  to.
  
     
    Personally, I have a BearCat 200XLT, a handheld scanner. It has 200
  memory channels. Most modern scanners have anywhere from 20 to over 1000
  memory areas. These memories allow you to store a frequency you like into
  them, for quick/easy access. Once you store all the active freqs you find in
  the memories, you can tell the scanner to only scan the channels stored in
  the memories, which allows you to keep up with all the activity in your
  area quite easily. If listening to weird things isn't your style, well...
  what can I say... you must be a normal person or something!!
 
    Once you have a scanner, you're going to want to do something with it.
  You can either read the manual and figure out how to scan ranges of
  frequencies, or you can enter frequencies from a frequency list right into
  the memories, avoiding the laborous search process. I do, however, recommend
  searching for some frequencies yourself, since I defininately don't have a
  list of ALL the freqs in use in RI, just some of them.
  
   You could buy a book with a list of radio frequencies in it and blow
  15 or 20 bucks. You'll also get a bunch of frequencies for areas all over
  the nation, most of which you'll never even use. Instead, we'll give you
  a list of some of the local RI frequencies. Here you go:

        The HAM bands are sometimes fun to listen to. Might be fun to get
      myself a HAM license one of these days! 
      
      * Many scanners can't pick up the cellular bands. 
        However, some are able to pick up frequencies above 900 Mhz. Many
        scanners have electronics that produce "image" frequencies of 
        frequencies below them.
        For instance, my scanner lets you listen to frequencies in the 851
        to 866 Mhz cellular range by listening to frequencies in the 900
        to 915.. mhz range. You have to find out the "IF" frequency of your
        scanner (it has to be a "2 stage scanner" or something, this does
        NOT work for all scanners) and add 2 x IF to the frequency you
        want.
        Say you want freq 864 and your scanner's IF is 27 Mhz you would do
        864 + 2x27 = 918. You tune to 918 Mhz, and you will hear a slightly
        degraded version of the convo on 864. Remember: This ONLY works
        for certain types of scanners and you have to find out the IF 
        frequency!
        
             
   There you go! And if you can't figure out how to get going with 
   scanning, ask around on the local boards, and some one'll chime in and
   help you! Make sure you mention RICUS and those cool RICUS dudes...

  [  We're not sure if the nodes use passwords or not. I see no reason to
   do anything with this info, I just put it in here cause I was asked to.
   However, if you feel the sudden urge to use this info for something,
   the same frontdoor tricks will work, of course. There will probably be
   an article on these "tricks" in a future RICUS.]

 10:Submissions to RICUS 
 -----------------------
 
    Anyone can submit an article to RICUS. Most likely, it will get distributed
 with the next issue.
  
    We'd also like to see letters to the RICUS editors. Inflammatory messages
 are always welcome!
 
  Leave public mail to "RICUS" in either Fido/323 or NE-Net, since that is
 where we primarily wait and watch the locals. <grin> 
                         
  We are _very_ interested in any info you may have on the CLAN library
 computer system. That's the one you see in the libraries, that you look
 books up on, that the librarians check books out on, etc.
     
     Also, contact us on one of those "evil subversive user" boards. If you
 don't know where they are by now, you probably never will.
 
   Seeya next issue,
                      CyNom
                      (Naturally, that's just my 'pen' handle ;)

  Note: The next issue will probably be out around March... Celebrating
        RICUS' first birthday! ONE full year of RICUS! And _atleast_
        one more to come.
