RI-CU   Volume 1, Issue 1, File 1                             Introduction


    Hello, and welcome to the Rhode Island Computer Underground Society
  Newsletter.  This is our first issue, and I (atleast) hope it to be one
 of many. The purpose of this newletter is to keep the masses of BBS users
 informed and keep the #1 BBS ethic: "Freedom of Information" going. There
 should be (almost) no information hidden from BBS users, especially by
 sysops who intend to use it for purposes of oppression and for keeping
 the majority of users under control.

   In order to fully understand the Freedom of Information ethic, you
 must first realize that BBSing is, and I can not stress this point
 enough, NOT REAL LIFE. It is a game, albeit a very LARGE game, but
 still a game. The names we post under while in BBS land are our
 characters, analogous to those in Dungeons and Dragons type adventures.
 Whether these names are our real names, or simply handles, it does not
 matter.

   Our BBS characters, as we call them, are NOT who we really are. It
 is important to avoid taking BBS world conflicts into the real world.
 This can result in a dangerous situation, where the one with the most
 knowledge will cause the most damage to the other, and probably
 also damage himself in one way or another.

  Try to keep what is started in telecom remaining in telecom, and keep
 what is started in the real world remaining there. If everyone followed
 this one simple rule, all would be fine.

  With this, I am a glad to present an interview with a severly oppressed
 BBS user. Some, the oppressors, will be angered by this. To this, I can
 say nothing, except to ask themselves to look at what they have done.

[Note: The RI Computer Underground Society name has been abused lately,
       through board crashings and such. We no longer promote such activities.
       If you find a hole/bug/backdoor in a BBS system, we suggest leaving
       the sysop a message stating the hole and how it could be used to cause
       damage.]

RI-CU  Volume 1, Issue 1, File 2                                  Interview


   Robert King  (AKA Teleterror, AKA Eternity)  was arrested on Friday,
 March 13, 1992 and charged with 6 Federal Offenses.

  All persons doing illegal computer-based activities are probably being
monitored, so cease all such activities if you happen to be one of these
people.

  Here is interview with TeleTerror, all responses are written just as they
were heard from TT himself, in the first person form:



Q: Where were you when the Secret Service arrived?

I was sitting out in my fathers truck listening to the radio and talking on
the phone. The phone cord was going out the window... The phone was on the
ground outside the truck.


Q: Did they identify themselves at first?

 No, they came up to the truck, opened the door, pulled the phone out of my
hand, and slammed it down the ground, hanging it up. They said "Wheres your
father?" I said "I guess he's at his store." At that point, I did not know
what was going on. They then said "Go unplug your computer!" I started to go
unplug the computer, and they said "Get back here!"
There was a lot of yelling.


Q: What procedures were followed after this incident?

They picked up the phone, and saw the autodial button labeled "Store", and
they pushed it. They then told my father to get home, they were the
Secret Service, etc etc... After that, they hung up the phone. And I said
"What the hells going on here?" They showed me their badges. They said
"Secret Service. You are under arrest.", I asked "What charges?" and they
replied "We don't haveto tell you." I said "I DEMAND to know what I being
arrested for..."  They said "That's too bad, we don't have to tell you
anything..." I replied "This is a violation of my constitutional rights"
They said "I'll tell you what your rights are... You have the right to remain
silent... ...an attorney present...." [etc] Upon hearing about attorney, I
said "I'd like an attorney." My father then rounded the corner and came to a
screeching halt, got out, slammed the door, and I said
"They won't tell me what they arrested me for!"
 My father said "You be quiet."
 We went inside the house. We started talking endless babble, etc.. I sat on
the couch and used my right to remain silent, not talking.. they asked me to
leave the room, and I just sat there. They walked out on the front steps and
I continued sitting. Then I violently tipped the piano over,took some
silverware out of the drawer, and faked suicide to see what the reaction would
be. Then they came back in a while later, and I asked again why I was being
arrested. And they gave this endless babbling about breaking law code xxx, etc
,etc etc...   After that, they took an electromagnet over my disks, illegally
searched my room, took my notebook, and several loose scraps of paper. Then
they left, saying that they would be back.


Q: Did they have a warrant?

No, they did not.


Q: _Did_ they come back and what did they do?

They did not physically come back, but they called and asked questions.


Q: What were some of these questions?

They asked where I got all the numbers and stuff.


Q: What were the laws that you allegedly broke?

1) Computer Fraud.  2) Network Fraud.  3) Access Device Fraud (password fraud)
4) Line fraud ("code" abuse)  5) Credit Card Fraud.  6) Extortion.

Q: Extortion? How could you have done that from your home?

I was allegedly threatening people with their credit reports.


Q: Is this stuff easy to do?

Farely easy, any average person could do it.


Q: Who do you think turned you in?

I KNOW who turned me in, it was Andrew Green, who we know from IDS. I have
reason to believe that they have no concrete evidence, and only
circumstantial evidence based on what he said.

Q: Are there any impending lawsuits?

Possibly the admin. at Brown might be suing, but he has no case.. It was an
open dialup......no passwords.


Q: Will you have to go to court?

I severly doubt it.


Q: If you could say anything to whoever turned you in, what would it be?

Drop dead idiotic pathetic dependent social reject who can't stay in college
or hold a job. You are slime, you have committed worse crimes, you have stolen
my hobby from me, all because of a three year old grudge.

Q: What systems were you using?

I refuse to answer this question on the grounds that it may incriminate me.


Statement: Thank you for this interview!
