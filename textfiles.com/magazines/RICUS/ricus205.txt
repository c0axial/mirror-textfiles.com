1: Introduction
---------------

   Welcome to yet another issue of RICUS.  This months feature is the Internet.
 You'll be provided with a list of all the Internet systems (that we were able
 to find) in RI, their administrators, contact numbers, etc.
  
   You'll also be provided with some new information we discovered about the
 upcoming Ocean State FreeNet.

    Enjoy....

2: List of RI Internet Systems
------------------------------

Here's a list of virtually everything related to Internet in RI.
              
How this list was obtained:

   o telnet'd to rs.internic.net 
   o entered 'wais RI'
   o the system searched for all entries in its database with 'RI' in them,
     many of these were systems in Rhode Island.
   o I chose all the applicable numbers off of this list and captured them.
     Enjoy! Their are QUITE a few companies and organizations in our little
     state that are on Internet. Please note that many of these systems are not
     actually *on* Internet, but have Internet e-mail addresses. You will not
     be able to explore some of them with a telnet connection. 
      
   Many of these systems have modem dialups (mostly the universities and 
 colleges, though some organizations and corporations also have some dialups.)
  
   A future issue of RICUS will feature an in depth exploration of all the
 college/university computer systems in RI.

3: Ocean State Freenet Bylaws
-----------------------------

 Yes, kiddiez, RICUS has spies EVERYWHERE! We even have spies on LORI, that
BBS 'for librarians only' (not) we exposed in the last issue.

 Recently, the bylaws for the upcoming Ocean State FreeNet were posted. The
messages were captured by RICUS representing spiez and given to us for
submission.

  Enjoy...

I was unable to complete a bylaws draft in time to distribute them
before the planned meeting -- I apologize.  I would consequently
like to postpone the September 8th bylaws committee meeting to the
afternoon of the 15th.  Bacause scheduling is so much easier on the
phone than via e.mail, I shall call those who signed up on Tuesday,
and send out hard copy as soon as I get to a printer.  Here is the
first draft of Article I.  The remaining articles follow as
separate messages.    --hb

Article I. Purpose                                        

I.1 The purpose of the Ocean State Free-Net is to establish and operate
a Free-
Net for the community of Rhode Island as an affiliate of the National
Public
Telecommunications Network.

I.2 The Ocean State Free-Net will be a community information resource
available
to all Rhode Islanders as inexpensively and as conveniently as possible
Rhode
Islanders will be able to dial into the Free-Net as guests, using
readily available
microcomputers and modems and may choose to register as users by
following a
simple on-line procedure.  Once registered, users will have access
through the
Free-Net to

      *electronic mail both locally and worldwide via the Internet
      *local databases and informational documents        
      *local interactive information resources
      *a gateway to the Internet including the National Public
            Telecomputing Network.

                             Ocean State Free-Net


Article II. Organization and development

II.1. Department of State Library Services

The development and management of the Ocean State Free-Net is a
service of the RI Department of State Library Services.  The
intention of the Department of State Library Services is to serve
as the incubator for the Ocean State Free-Net with the expectation
that it would become an independent non-profit organization by July
1, 1995.  To that end, the Department shall provide staff, office
space, and equipment for the Free-Net, as well as liaison with
state government, and manage its property and business.

II.2 Steering Committee

Until that time, the Steering Committee, an organization of
organizations, will set direction for the Free-Net and make policy
decisions, including such items as which resources to solicit and
implement, when, and to what extent, the nature and extent of any
restrictions on access, both for information providers and users.

II.3. Independence

No later than January 1, 1995, the steering committee shall empower
a bylaws and incorporation committee with a charge to prepare a
revision of these bylaws that will be the basis of an independent
Ocean State Free-Net corporation.  Major considerations for that
committee will be

      1. the nature of membership
      2. not-for-profit status (incorporate as a library?)
      3. relationship with the Department of State Library Services
      4. fees and financial support


II.4 Community participation

Both the DSLS and the members of the steering committee shall
proactively work to include as much of the diversity of the Rhode
Island Community as possible in the planning and operation of the
Free-Net, at the point of identifying
the needs and issues the Free-Net must consider, as well as in its
consideration of those needs and issues.

Article III.  Steering Committee

III.1 Membership

III.1.1  Initial membership shall be restricted to organizations
that have expressed interest in furthering the purposes of the
Free-Net by September 1, 1993.  Member organizations shall
designate one representative to participate in the deliberations
and decisions of the steering committee.

III.1.2  Organizations may apply to the steering committee for
membership, and upon approval by two thirds of the steering
committee and designation of a representative shall be members.

III.1.3  The steering committee shall work to include as much as
possible of Rhode Island's diversity in its composition as well as
in its deliberations.

III.1.4  A member may be required to withdraw by a three fourths
vote of the steering committee.

III.2 Meetings

III.2.1  Meetings will be convened by the representative of the
Department of State Library Services.

III.2.2  The steering committee shall meet at least nine times each
year.

III.2.3  A majority of the committee will constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business at any steering committee meeting.
                                                          
III.2.4  Every effort will be made to achieve consensus among the
steering committee members; should that be impossible, a vote shall
determine decisions, following Roberts rules of order.  A majority
vote of a quorum shall constitute a decision of the committee.

III.3 Action without a meeting

III.3.1  In the event that a quorum cannot be assembled for a
meeting, pressing needs for action may be resolved by a written (or
electronic) poll of the steering committee.  Concurrence of a
majority of the steering committee in such circumstances shall
constitute a decision of the committee.

III.4 Committees

III.4.1  The steering committee is obligated to hear reports and
advice of the standing committees.


III.4.2  The steering committee may constitute and empower ad hoc
committees to act upon specific charges as necessary.     

III.4.3  Committees need not be composed exclusively of steering
committee members; rather, the greatest possible community
participation shall be encouraged by seeking as diverse a
membership as possible for both standing and ad hoc committees.

Unlike the Steering Committee, which is an organization of
organizations, the standing committees comprise individuals.

individuals who have expressed an interest in that committee's
membership before September 1, 1993.  New members shall be
appointed by the committee with approval of the steering committee.
The committee charges follow:

                  and documentation

IV.3  Development and Design Subcommittee:
      designs and redesigns the configuration of the Free-Net,
including:

                  educational institutions to create
                  the optimal suite of local
                  information offerings
            --determining the particular features,
                  forums, options available to users,
                  who will be responsible for each,

            --soliciting and considering user
                  feedback to maintain optimal design

IV.4  Staff and Facilities Subcommittee:
      ensures adequate staff and facilities for the Free-
            Net by:
            --working with the Project Manager to
                  identify staffing needs and recruit
                  staff members as necessary              
            --identifying appropriate roles for
                  volunteers
            --working with staff to recruit
                  volunteers to serve on committees
                  and subcommittees and other
                  appropriate roles.

            --developing and submitting grant proposals
            for funding the Free-Net
            --developing and submitting proposals for
            state funding of the Free-Net
            --seeking donations of equipment
            --other fundraising activities

      arranges publicity for the Ocean State Free-Net through:
            --the media
            --messages on the Free-Net
            --relationships with user and potential
                  user organizations and agencies

  Comments? Yes.. I have some comments alright. If you're planning to run
ANY type of a sucessful system, I suggest asking for volunteers from the general
RI telecom community. The current BBS users will comprise the majority
of the users on the FreeNet. I know quite a few technically skilled members of
RI telecom who would gladly volunteer their services if it meant a better system
for all...

 Well, there's the tentative list of what Ocean State FreeNet is going to
be offering. As of this writing, (October 16th, 1993), OSFN isn't up
yet. The machine is there and is connected to the Internet, however. Finding
its system name and IP address is left as a simple excercise for the reader.
<grin>

                *  "What the hell IS this crap?" *


 Remember, these systems are paid for with public money. So, if you figure
out how to format the hard drive, your parents tax money will be going to
pay some state employee to fix it. Not that it matters, of course, since it
goes to pay for lots of other junk, too...

   Well! There you have it... another issue! Stay tuned for the December issue, which will feature
 detailed information on the colleges/universities of Rhode Island and their computer systems.

   I'm sorry this issue wasn't more feature packed. I actually expected to have some more info
 for you, but it turns out it was not acquired in time.

   As usual, if you'd like to leave us a comment or submit something to RICUS, leave a message to
 "Those RICUS bad boyzz" on the following RI message networks: NE-Net Common & FidoNet 323 Chat.
