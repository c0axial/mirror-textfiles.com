     In a free society, responsibility must accompany freedom, or chaos and
anarchy will result.  To put it another way, you are free to do as you like,
but you must answer for the consequences of your action.  Or in yet other
words, your right to swing your fist ends at the next guy's nose.

     In past months we have all seen more and more acts on Houston Apple
BBS's, which many users and sysops find irresponsible:

          We as a community of modem users have been forced to endure abuse,
          both of our innocent users and of our systems.

          We've been subjected to harrassment, threats and offers to reward
          the commission of criminal actions against us.

          Some users have attempted to dictate to us what we can and cannot
          do with our own privately owned and funded BBS's.

     This goes far beyond what is reasonable or acceptable.

     In a society as different as ours, some incidents like this are
unavoidable. As system operators, we expect  and are willing to tolerate
them as part of the price of freedom.


     What concerns us, goes far beyond that. Pranks are one thing, criminal
conspiracies are another.  Attempts to harrass, abuse, o infringe on the
rights of others simply cannot be allowed to continue - or users will cease to
be users, and this community will die.

    _That_ is the essence of the problem, and the reason why we all believe
that we need to do something about it.

      None of us created this community: we all discovered it, more or less by
chance, and we have all had many hours of enjoyment from it.  Many of us met
and became good friends through the modem. We all hope that we are tolerant of
another's differences, and that new people are always welcome. We believe that
all of us owe something to the community as a whole.

      If the community is going to continue, then its members must realize
that it is not indestructable, and that each of us must exercise reasonable
restraint in what we do. The vast majority of users know that, and do it
without a second thought - it's just natural to do that, to take care of what
you care about.

      A small minority do not realize this, or seem to care. Their actions
alienate new and old users alike, to the general harm of our comunity. Each
of us, as the sysop of our own systems, feel that we cannot stand by and let
this happen.


     Because of this problem, SYSOPS FOR RESPONSIBLE MODEM USE was formed,
and met for the first time on August 13th, 1989 at 1:30pm.  This group is an
association of Apple sysops in the Houston area.  It seemed there was not
enough communication between the GBBS sysops, and this meeting was to remedy
that.  The meeting was highly successful, and all of us agreed on a number of
principles and ideas:

           We agree that we are not inclined or qualified to stand in judgment
           on any individual, but that certain kinds of conduct must be
          discouraged or forbidden.

          We agree that we oppose vigilante justice, blacklisting, and secrecy
          beyond what is necessary for our mutual protection.

          We agree that individuals can change, and that we welcome anyone who
          refrains from irresponsible conduct on our boards. We agree that we
          cannot, and should not judge a user by age, but only by actions.

          We agree that each of us is individually the final arbiter of our
          own systems, that we are autonomous, and will not surrender that
          autonomy to a group - we think that doing so would be wrong, and
          dangerous to our community.


    With these principles in mind, we agreed that it would help us all to
share information with one another about users who create, incite or support
irresponsible modeming, for our protection by identifying them, and for your
protection, by assuring that we are not dealing with mere rumor or hearsay
about a user.

    We agree that we all want to be informed of actions by a user on any of
our boards which tend to harm the community at large - including serious
misrepresentation of identity, malicious mischief, criminal conspiracy, and
the willful spreading of viral software - but that each of us, individually,
reserves the right to decide what to do about it.  We are not police, and do
not want to be, but we need to share information to protect our systems and
our community.

    We agree that it would be unfair to apply sanctions retroactively - that
is, to take any concerted action against any user based on incidents that
occured before the public announcement of our intent. We agreed that as far as
our group was concerned, all users have a "clean slate" - only acts that occur
in the future are our legitmate joint concern.



    We do not take these actions, or our responsibilities lightly, but for the
protection and preservation of our community, we will do what we must. To this
end, we have pledged each other our mutual support, in the furtherance of your
interests and ours. We firmly believe that our users will understand and
applaud what we do, and that with the help of divine Providence, we can
continue to be a free and responsible modeming community.

              System Help

The  following is a list of some of the system  commands and their use on  this
system.   There  are other  help  files available throughout the system. If you
still have a question or problem with a command  after reading these files then
please leave [F]eedback to the Sysop.

          -------------------
          [ System Menu Bar ]
          -------------------

         [ Command (?=Help): ]

This is the main System Prompt of  GBBS "PRO".  This system has a 128 character
type  ahead buffer which means you  can type  characters before you come to  an
option   (except  during  the  system's read/write activity of the disk drive).
If  you made a mistake in typing  some- thing  you wish to  cancel,  a  "[CTRL]
[^]"  (Control Shift 6) will clear  the buffer  of commands that have not  been
processed.

[ B ]  [B] gives you access to the Main Bulletin  Board  on  the  system.  From
       here  you  can  type a  question mark to see a list of  commands and get
more help.   You  also  have access  to all of the other bulletin boards on the
system from this point.

[ B# ] If  you type [B#] you will  have access directly  to that Bulletin Board
       from the  system  as  long as it exists and you have access to it. (i.e.
"B6" puts you on Board 6).
