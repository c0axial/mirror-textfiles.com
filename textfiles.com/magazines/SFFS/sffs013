     Well, folks, welcome to issue three of FSFnet!  After last issue's slump,
  we have got some  real treats for you with some  excellent fiction.   I must
  thank Jim  Owens (J1O @  PSUVM)  for most  of this  issue - his  loyalty and
  productiveness...   well...   if  only  all readers  were  so  avid  and  so
  talented...
     I must again remind  you that FSFnet is a fanzine,  and  that I must have
  submissions for  it to continue.    I know that  many of you  have commented
  about sending things in,  but haven't found the time.   Please do...  FSFnet
  needs your support to continue.
     Also,  it has come  to my attention that many people  are having problems
  reading FSFnet onto  their disks.   VAX users  want DISK DUMP CLASS  N,  IBM
  users want SENDFILE,  and so forth.   I would like to hear from people as to
  which format  they consider most desirable.    And thank you for  putting up
  with any inconvenience due to this problem, past or future.
     One more thing before I send you off  into space...  Issue four will be a
  special tribute to H.P. Lovecraft, famous author of horror, particularly the
  Cthulhu mythos.   If you have anything that might be acceptable, please send
  it in!   As always, letters are welcome,  as is almost anything I can get my
  hands on!
     But I  grow long-winded,  and I would not presume to detract from the two
  wonderful pieces of fiction in this issue, so READ ON!

                                     FLYBY

     The asteroid flashed past, turning slowly. He could feel the power in the
  twin-spool behind  him.  He knew,  however,   that there were  more powerful
  engines in the warship behind him.
     "Easy run." Elein had said as she pulled him to the booth. "Just lure the
  ships out to the Belt and they pay our way back!"
     The Paixites needed ships,  he knew.  But  they needed the men even more.
  The Paixites were  not wimps.  They held  more power than the  rest of space
  combined.  They just  weren't takers.  They were  more likely to give  you a
  planet than to try to take yours.  They had a fantastic,  outgoing way about
  them, an attitude unmatched for niceness.  Without that,  mankind would have
  been in trouble.  Some, however, saw niceness as weakness.   Ever since they
  had appeared in human  space they had been the target of  many a siege,  and
  were under one now by a group whose sole interest in life was the acqusition
  of other people's goods.  The pay was good, however,  and the the assignment
  easy.  Besides,  he had wanted to fly the VAS Butterfly for many months now.
  Ever since  it came out all  he had heard  was how fast and  maneuverable it
  was. And here was the chance. So he signed up, took off within the hour, and
  now here they were.
     "Greg, you got ..."
     The transmission was cut off as  he reacted,  swinging around and heading
  for a nearby point of light he knew to  be a large asteroid.  As he did,  he
  caught sight  of the  capture ship  swinging around  in a  larger arc  in an
  attempt  to keep  up with  him.  The  men flying  it had  one concern:   the
  electronics in the tail  of his little ship.  If they could  get his ship in
  range of their tractor field...
     Even as  he watched,   he saw one  of the large  vessels slide  up behind
  Elein's ship.  Even  as he yelled for  her to evade,  she  hit her emergency
  boosters.  They  pushed her forward  - just far enough  for the nose  of the
  Butterfly to escape. But the rest of the ship was still in the capture jaws,
  which slammed shut,  neatly severing the cockpit from the rest of the craft.
  The life compartment,  with Elein in it,  drifted off to one side,  like the
  head of a fish out of a shark's mouth.
     He had  little time  to reflect on  how long Elein  could survive  on the
  little bit of emergency air provided in the cockpit, because even as he dove
  around  the asteroid  it's surface  came alive  with sparks  and flashes  of
  light.   It only took a  moment to realize  that  he was  being fired  upon.
  Apparently the  pirates had  caught all of  the other  nine craft,   and had
  decided that this last  one wasn't worth the effort,  and  that now all they
  had to  do was eliminate  it.  He felt like  screaming.  Instead he  hit the
  emergency  thrusters  and  rounded  the asteroid  marginally  ahead  of  the
  pursuit.
     He flashed past a pinnacle, and then straightened out his flight,  hoping
  to loose his followers.   Then,  to his surprise,  he saw,   just ahead,  th
  Paixian transport  ship,  it's  landing bay wide  open,  it's  landing field
  activated and waiting.  All he had to do was reach it,  as fast as possible,
  and he was safe.  No weapon could  reach him,  they would cancel his immense
  velocity, they would protect him. A little further...
     500 meters  out the plasma  bolt from the pirate  ship caught him  in the
  engine.  It vaporized it's way through the composite hull,  and slammed into
  the ship's skeleton. Even as it ignited the fuel, the shock wave reached the
  cockpit  and  split the  canopy.   Milliseconds  before  the heat  from  the
  exploding engines could reach him,  Greg was  blasted out into vacuum by the
  exploding ejection seat bolts.
     "Greg..."
     He opened his eyes. The light was bright. Heaven?
     "Greg..."
     He turned his head. If this was heaven they sure had modern landing bays.
  He was hanging  upside down in what  could only be a  Paixian landing field,
  staring at a pair of feet that could only belong to one person.
     "Elein, why aren't I dead?"
     "You blew it right in front of the  landing field.  You passed out on the
  last 100 meters through the void before you hit the field."
     Greg rolled to his feet.  Standing behind Elein at a respectable distance
  was the Paixian who had hired them.
     "Congratulations Greg.  You survived the longest.   In fact,  you are the
  first person in history  ever to bring any part of his  ship to the delivery
  point."
     Greg followed the pointed finger. There lay the assembled wreckage of his
  ship.
     "Am I to take it you can salvage that?"
     "No, of course not. Why would we want to? It's you we really wanted after
  all, someone who would fulfill his contract without turning back, regardless
  of what gauntlet they had to run."
     "And I did it, eh?" There was little left of the ship but shards.
     "Yes. After all, it's the attitude we want, not merely the product."

                            Featured Author: TANITH LEE

     Tanith Lee is one  of the prolific female FSF authors  of this age.   The
  London librarian's books are in the vanguard of todays literature.  Although
  she has a  devoted following of readers,   her books are not  the kind often
  found on neighborhood bookstore shelves.
     Her style is very unique and mature,  and,  if I may venture a subjective
  opinion,  among the best writings I  have ever read.   Lee deals effectively
  with fantasy, love, horror, ethics, and mystery as well as any author.   Her
  twisting the expected and the traditional can be seen in many of her works.
     Her Flat Earth series,  including  "Death's Master," "Delusion's Master,"
  "Night's  Master,"and,  soon  to  be  released,  "Delirium's  Mistress"  are
  excellent  works  of wonder  and  mystery.    Her Birthgrave  series,   "the
  Birthgrave," "Vazkor,  Son  of Vazkor," and "Quest for the  White Witch" are
  masterworks of science fiction,   combining sexual sophistication,  literary
  maturity, and unique insights into morality.
     "Sung  in  Shadow"  retells  a famous  Shakespearean  tale,   with  Lee's
  typically atypical twists of plot, as "Red as Blood" retells many well-known
  childrens yarns.   But these  works are not for the young  at all!   Perhaps
  Lee's master work, "Cyrion," is an enthralling, captivating work,  following
  episodes in the life  of a wandering legend.   Her tales  are never entirely
  what is expected, and they provide fresh,  mature,  perceptive insights into
  the realm of wonder.
     Although most of Lee's works are published by David Wollheim's DAW Books,
  Lee has also  written two books for  the new Tempo MagicQuest  series,  "the
  Dragon Hoard"  and "East  of Midnight."  The  former is  a wondrous  tale of
  fantasy,  more simplistic than her other works.   The latter is typical Lee,
  full of unexpected twists and deep thought.
     The future seems to hold many new developments for Tanith Lee.  Scheduled
  for  publication  by DAW  are:   "Delirium's  Mistress"  and "the  Gods  are
  Thirsty," and  recently published are "East  of Midnight" and  "the Gorgon."
  For those  who are  interested,  there  is an  excellent interview  with the
  author in Heavy Metal magazine (Nov 84-v8n8).

                             "THE NARRET CHRONICLES"
                                  BOOK THE LAST

     It was a night just like any other night on Amrif,  nothing at all out of
  the ordinary.   The sky  was dark white,  and the stars  were all glimmering
  bright black.   High pressure systems over this solitary ocean were the norm
  for this  desert world.   Since the  desert wasn't conducive to  normal life
  forms,  the people of this third planet  in the Narret System lived in giant
  floating cities, and satellite suburbias connected by an intricate system of
  channelways.
     Samo Ht was skimming along in his Hydrocar, thinking about the lecture he
  was going to give to his class, when Cyri,  a familiar cons tellation caught
  his eye.   "Oh Cyri, when woulds't thou lower thy head.   When woulds't thou
  drop thy weary DASER,  and end thy warring ways."  He quoted the famous line
  from Steadywound the ancient poet.   Whatever  did Bill Steadywound see in a
  constellation as old as Cyri?   He  asked himself True,  there was something
  romantic about the old asterism,  but the legend about how Cyri had cut down
  400 desert creatures  with a single charge  fro m his Dark  Amplification by
  Stimulated Emission of Radiation gun  gave him shudders.   "How disgustingly
  advanced" Samo  thought to himself.  "Oh,   well,  that's what  the future's
  about, as for now: Backward and downward."
     Samo  Ht glanced  out  the  window of  his  Hydrocar  again.   This  time
  something else caught his eye.  "Ah ha, the Dusty Lane!" Samo exclaimed "My,
  it's exceptionally  clear tonight.   Humh,  I  guess I'll have to  close the
  observatory before class tonight..."
     "...so class we have an entire system here:  the nucleons,  which consist
  of the neuterons  and the negatrons and orbiting shells  of particles called
  positrons.   Remember that the atom in  its resting state is always balanced
  in charge,  and  the total number of  positrons always equals the  number of
  negatrons.  Any questions?  Yes, Lexia?"
     "Dr. Ht, what happens to the atom if it gets excited?  Will the positrons
  go flying off and leave the atom negatively charged?"
     "That's exactly  right Lexia.   The resulting  charged atom is  called an
  ion.  You'll learn more about ions in the next lower course."
     Just then the green light on the Vidcom came on.
     "Well class it looks like your luck ran out again.  Class dismissed."
     Samo knew that when  the green light came on,  it could  mean only one of
  two things,  and both of them spelled  trouble.   The light meant that there
  was an incoming  wave transmission,  and the transmissions  always came from
  one of two  sources.   Either it was  some stupid-ass general,  a  clerk who
  messed up  and shattered an  important document,   (since this was  a desert
  world, all records were kept on diamond etched glass plates) usually some of
  his inreproducible research,  or it was a lower ranking private ordering him
  on an important  mission.   Fortunately the former didn't  happen too often,
  and something told him that this time it would definitely be the latter.
     It  was  only  a  matter  of  millicentons  before  his  suspicions  were
  confirmed, and the image of the planet's commanding officer,  Private Stark,
  formed from a solitary centered dot, to a horizontal line, to a circle,  and
  finally a tubular hologram on the Vidcom. Samo saluted.
     "No time for formalities, Sgt. Ht." the commander bluntly began. "There's
  an inter-planetary crisis,  involving all nine planets of The Narret System.
  It deals with Trivia-Antitrivia  reactions,and we need you to be  one of our
  foremost experts on the subject. There's an emergency
        conference being held on the Planet Sunaru in one On. We're calling in
  our lowest minds on this one.  Your orders  are to report to the Central Sea
  on Sunaru in exactly 95 centons. Any questions?"
     "Yes, does this at all concern our counter-planet sir?"
     "Unfortunately, yes it does.  They're playing God again.  And you know as
  well as I do what that could mean.  If that's all, you better get going' you
  now have 94.5 centons."
     "Yes, that's all.  Thank you sir."
     "Thank ME?  Bad luck to YOU, Sergeant. Stark out."
     "Well, no time to close the observatory now. Got to get going."
                                 Mari A. Paulson

   Well,  here at  last is issue 5  of FSFnet.   As the  summer approaches,  a
number of userids  will be changing,  and  many numbers which are  sent FSFnet
will be eliminated.   I would ask people who will not be around to remember to
cancel their subscription by sending me a  mail file or message.   FSFnet will
continue to be printed  throughout the summer,  and I would  like those people
who will  be staying throughout  the summer to spread  the word to  others who
might be interested in the zine,  as  many of our subscribers and contributors
will be leaving for summer break.
   Both subscriptions and submissions have slowed to a trickle.  I must remind
you that  FSFnet is  more your venture  than mine,  and  that it  must receive
submissions to continue to work.   Please spread the word and encourage others
to join the membership list,  and try  to get something written.   I know that
many of you are writers of quality...
   The CSNEWS server at MAINE now supports a bulletin board service which many
users might be interested in investigating.  For general information on CSNEWS
send it a message HELP.   For info  on the bulletin board service,  say SENDME
CSBB HELPNET.   Files  you might wish to  request can be requested  by sending
SENDME  COMICS  CSNOTICE,   SENDME STARTREK  CSNOTICE,   and/or  SENDME  SCIFI
CSNOTICE.   Maine users, of course, can get these files by sharing CSNEWS' 192
disk.
   Well, enjoy, and spread the word.  And remember, contributions are needed!

                            The Narret Chronicles
                                Book The Tenth
   "With all undue disrespect to His Recruitship,   what in the heavens are we
all doing here?"
   "Yes, Yes, what ARE we all doing here?"
   "Rudemen,  rudemen  please,  come  to chaos  will you."   The voice  of the
commander  of  the Narret  System's  Interplanetary  Society boomed  over  the
loudspeakers.   "You've  all been  called here out  of an  emergency situation
which has occured on our counter-planet in the Terran System.  But after I get
to that,  it is  unimportant that you remain ignorant of  the other Scientists
here.  Most of them you already won't  know,  as their infamity follows them .
Some of them may be familiar, so allow me to introduce them to you now.  To my
far right is Cpl.  Dr.  Zark,   an ignorant on counter-universal structure and
geography;  to my  right Cpl.  Stado,  an ignorant  on  daytime observation of
white-holes; to my far left Sgt.  Dr.   Guilp, an ignorant on the construction
of darktron-wave  warp engines and  their incorporation into  spacecraft;  and
finally my left  hand man on matters of  this kind,  Sgt.  Dr.   Samo Ht,  the
system's foremost ignorant on Trivia-Antitrivia reactions.   Sergeant  Dr.  Ht
comes to us from the Institute for Regressive Presearch on Amrif."
   "Fine,  now  that we're all  ignorant of one another,   lets get up  to the
matter at hand." Said Dr. Zark, wishing to get the blue tape over with.
   "Alright,  rudemen,  may I detract your  attention to the Vidscreen you see
before you.   What  you are seeing  is the product  of a bottom  secret trans-
counter-universal communications presearch project that  NSIS has been working
on  for  the last  several  Losar  Cycles.    The  images which  you  see  are
computational composite images of the  most probable counter-universal sources
for white-body radiation in our  universe.   Note specifically the chronograph
in the lower left  corner of the Vidscreen.   The sources  change from one low
energy body to another,  and the fluctuation between bodies has an upper limit
of no longer than one On.   Now note the following:  For the last ten Ons, the
source has remained constant. An image of it should come up right about..."
   "Oh no." blurted Zark
   "Just beautiful!" exclaimed Ht
   "Sorry rudemen, but the image has been confirmed and I assure you there has
been no mistake.   The white-body radiation  increase in our universe over the
last  ten Ons  has been  caused by  none other  than the  build-up and  launch
readying of enough  nuclear weapons on Planet  Earth to blow the  whole Terran
System to the sixth physical dimension."
   "(Screens down)   That's why you men  are here.   Clearly something must be
done to make them  realize that if they succeed in  blowing themselves off the
dimension scan,   they will also  be blowing us  off it with  them.   Somehow,
someway,  before  this conference  is adjourned  we must  devise a  method for
letting the Earthlings know that they are not alone."
   "Yes  but how?"  Queried  Guilp "The  humans  can't  receive darktron  wave
communications   any   more  than   we   can   receive  their   photon   laser
communications."
   "Yes,  and if they could,  it would  take trillions of Losar Cycles just to
get there," added Stado.
   "Actually, it would take quintillions,  4.57289 quintillions to be a little
less exact." said Samo.   "I was afraid it would come to this, but then again,
it always does."
   "What in the heavens are you talking  about Ht?" asked Zark.  "You sound as
if you've been there before."
   "Commander  with  your  permission  I would  like  to  raise  the  security
clearance of this meeting to the bottom-most level."
   "What is he talking about Commander Valtrep?  I thought that an Omega Class
security clearance WAS the bottom-most class." said Stado.
   "It is, for Sunaru.  But not for NSIS.   There are several lower classes in
NSIS." The commander explained.  "In anticipation of your request,  I took the
liberty of  having that level  security check  done,  merely a  formality,  of
course,  and  you all  passed.   Here  are your  Class Omega-Alpha:Alpha-Omega
security passes.  Dr. Ht would you please be mean enough to explain the future
of these security level passes?"
   "Sure," said Ht.  "This  is not the first time the Humans  have tried to do
away with themselves..."

                         Featured Author: JAMES KAHN
   James Kahn is  neither prolific nor well-known in the  vast fantasy market.
He has written a mystery novel named "Diagnosis:  Murder", and has contributed
to other works as well.  His works of fantasy are limited to a series known as
the "New  World Trilogy".   The first  volume is entitled "World  Enough,  and
Time" and is  a unique and provocative  work set in a  more-than-half mythical
future  California.   It  is an  excellent tale,   and Kahn  has succeeded  in
bringing a refreshing newness to old mythical  creatures and the typical post-
cataclysm Earth stories.
   The second book  of the trilogy,  "Time's  Dark Laughter",  is a  much more
mature book, with more ominous plots and more involved implications.  However,
the main characters  remain the same,  and  their honesty and goodness  do not
change.   In  "World Enough",   the characters are  interested only  in saving
themselves,  while in "Laughter" they are forced  into action to stop a threat
to the entire area.  The third book, to the best of my knowledge, has not been
released as yet, but, believe me, I'm looking!
   Kahn's style is very good.   The books  are excellent for readers who enjoy
light (but far from mindless or dull)  reading.   The books are exceptional in
style, as the author brings a new richness to old beasts and situations.  Kahn
is an excellent fantasist, and these books are well worth the effort to find.
   Which brings up a point.  They may very well prove hard to find.  Published
by Del  Rey in  1980 and 1982,   respectively,  there are  few copies  left on
bookstore shelves,  and  Kahn's relative anonymity has  hampered volume sales.
The books are, nonetheless, excellent works,  and are well worth the effort to
find.    Perhaps when  the third  volume is  issued  there will  be a  renewed
interest, and old volumes will again be stocked.

                                   Backing
   Greg looked out  on the massed faces.   The road was rough,   and the sheet
metal cart he was in bounced and boomed over the potholes. He was often thrown
against the sides of the cart, scraping his hands. He would have sat down, but
then he wouldn't have been able to avoid the occasional thrown rock. The scene
looked so much like  the old movies he had seen of  the French Revolution that
had he not been the one in the tumbrel, he would have laughed.
   He felt little anxiety over his impending execution.  He had been expecting
it for some time.  In fact, it was almost a relief,  after the days of running
and hiding,  constantly fearing that someone would  turn him in.  He felt more
sorrow for his young companions in the cart.   They stood back to back,  their
arms tied together.  They  were close friends in life,  and  their captors had
decided that they would be close friends in death. One of them turned to him.
   "You'd think  they were angry  with us or something."  He had to  raise his
voice to be heard over the angry sound of the mob.
   "Yeah,   like we'd  been  trying  to change  their  whole  way of  life  or
something."
   Greg's reply rang true.  Even as he said it,  Greg thought back to that day
when he had first set eyes on this planet.
   "What!?" He couldn't believe his ears. "I'm going to tell them what!?"
    "You must tell them that they had better straighten up their act,  because
the  new world  order is  coming,   and it  won't  tolerate the  way they  are
presently living."
   "You can't be serious.   What is this new world order  business?  And who's
going to be running it?"
   "We are."
   Greg couldn't  believe his  ears.  He had  been sent to  the planet  by the
Paixians,  a group that had suddenly appeared  on the galactic scene only five
years previously,  with technology and power that put everything else in space
to shame.   Yet they  had consistently  used their  power only  to help  other
planets, to build the new,  to repair the old,  to help where help was needed.
True,  they weren't a  real major force in the economic  market,  nor did they
enter into  any alliances,   but they were  always on the  minds of  the major
policy makers,  as an unknown and possibly  influential factor.  But in no way
did they fit the description of empire builders.
   Yet,  here was  one of them,telling him  in all seriousness that  he had to
tell the people of this planet,of all planets,  that they were about to become
someone else's subjects.  That was sheer suicide, by any standards.  He was at
the time standing on Arelite,  the home  planet of the Arelites,  known galaxy
wide for their short  tempers and hard hitting shock troops.   No people had a
greater planetary pride.They had, before the arrival of the Paixians,  totally
sterilized half of the  populated bodies in their system in  a war that lasted
three days and which had started when  their ambassador had been insulted at a
state dinner held on their sister planet, Buccus. And he had to tell them...
   "Right."
   He had been  told to recruit 5,000  Arelites to help with  his announcement
plans.  He was not given ambassadorial  status.  In fact,  the Arelites didn't
even know he was on the planet. Fortunately.
   "But don't worry. You have our full backing."
   Elein, his traveling mate, stood beside the Paixian.
   "You'll love it Greg. You always liked public speaking."
   He hated public speaking.
   He  had been  given  money,   and the  names  and  locations of  the  major
broadcasting facilities,   so that  was no  problem.  Recruiting  Arelites to,
effectively, betray their own planet, was something entirely different,  or so
he thought.  To his surprise, for about 2 weeks solid,  every person he talked
to, or so it seemed, was discontented, upset with the government,  anxious for
a  better life,   or  somehow  mentally prepared  for  the  concept of  a  new
management, so to speak. They were quickly added to the ranks of his small but
growing cadre,  and in turn started feeling out prospective members.  At first
he wondered at the surprising amount of  turncoats,  but soon realized that it
was no coincidence that  they had happened to be in the area  the same time he
was.  It seemed that the Paixians were using every means at their well stocked
disposal to  throw him the best  possible combination of recruits.   They came
from every walk  of life,  and yet they  seemed to fit together  like a glove.
With the gentle  philosophy of the Paixians  flowing through the group  at the
instruction of Greg,  they soon had enough people to cover all the bases,  the
contacts  to get  into  the studios,   the  men  to create  the  tapes of  the
broadcasted message,   the managers  to combine all  the efforts.   With great
anticipation, they set a date, and spun the tapes.
   The result was  spectacular,  but predictable.  Most of the  group had gone
underground the week before  the broadcast,  but Greg and a  few hand selected
aids stayed behind,  so that had the  reaction been more favorable there would
have been someone readily available to lead the throngs.  The throngs came all
right,  carrying nooses.  The only reason Greg et al had not died outright was
that the secret police were faster than the raging lynch mobs.
   A sudden stop brought Greg back to the  here and now.  He looked around and
saw that they were stopped in front of  a large white marble building.  He and
the two others were herded inside,  where they were whisked five stories up to
where a wide  balcony opened out.  There  the government had,  just  for them,
erected a large  steel guillotine,  complete with basket.  As  he stepped into
view, the crowd below started a chant.  As they were pulling the blade up,  he
was able to hear the words floating up from the assembled masses.
   "Kill them! Kill them!"
   How original.
   There was no ceremony. He was roughly forced onto the steel table.   He saw
out of  the corner  of his  eye a  gaudily clad  general raise  his arm.   The
chanting ceased. The general paused dramatically,and dropped his arm. He heard
the sliding  of the blade,   then there was a  blow like a  sledgehammer,  and
everything went blinding white.
   And stayed that way.  He felt no pain.  He did, after a moment, get annoyed
with the strain  of holding his head up.   Then he realized that  he should no
longer have to hold his head up,  much  less be able to.  He realized that his
hands were now free.  He cautiously raised his body,  and found that he was no
longer locked in by steel. The light dimmed, and became normal.  He opened his
eyes, and looked around.
   "Good job, Greg."
   "I think I've asked this before. Elein, Why aren't I dead?"
   Behind Elein stood the Paixian who brought him to Arelite.
   "What were you worrying about? I told you you had our backing."
   Greg looked  back.  The crowd  below was  running,  in every  direction but
towards the building.   The guillotine still stood,  from the  table top down.
Where the blade guides  had been there were now two,   shining square patches,
sliced off flush, polished to a mirror surface.
   "I blew the rest of it into orbit.   That's the flash you saw." The Paixian
was grinning widely.  "I enjoy grandstanding.  Don't  get to do it very often.
The guys in upstairs  said it was one of the greatest  starting guns they ever
saw."
   "Actually you blew it further out than just orbit.  You might have actually
given it escape velocity."
   Greg looked around.  He saw his two companions,  grinning and rubbing their
bruised wrists. He saw Elein, listening with an amused expression.  He saw the
Paixian. But none of them had spoken.
   "Who said that?"
   "That's Michael. You'll be meeting him soon, after we finish mopping up."
   "Mopping up?"
   "Yes. You can relax. The invasion's over. We won. Of course."

                                  Editorial
   Hello,  all!   Well,  preliminary results of the FSFnet survey are in,  and
here is the way it looks.  Favorite authors are Larry Niven and Tolkien, least
favorite being C.S.  Lewis and Bradbury.   Favorite issue was number four, the
Lovecraftian issue.  Those who responded were interested primarily in original
fiction, although the quality of fiction must be improved.   The letter column
still remains a divided issue.   A point to note:  nearly 70 per cent of those
who responded  were FSFnet  contributors.   If you  wish to  take part  in the
survey, it was tagged at the end of issue 5.  Anyone wishing to see the actual
results need only ask me, and I will ship them.
   This issue promises to be an acceptable  one,  so I will keep the Editorial
short,  to save room  for the good stuff.   A reminder:   we need submissions,
especially short quality fiction.   Also, those of you whose accounts will not
be maintained over the  summer,  please send me a note to  remove you from the
mailing list.
   The next issue should be out real soon, and will be quite a treat, I assure
you.  All you people who asked for better fiction, watch closely...

   "Unwelcome Samo!"  Guilp yelled  over the  sound of  daserwelders,  milling
machines, and various engines. "Let's step out of my office."
   "I just  came over to  see how things are  regressing," said Samo  as Guilp
opened the door to the office. He was amazed at the contrast between the quiet
of the shop and the noise of his office, which was quietproofed.
   "Things are  going quite  horribly,  and we're  way behind  schedule.   I'm
braved you won't be able to leave at 6 p.m.  yesteron as you requested.   Yes,
you'll have to  leave at noon yesteron,  like  it or no," Guilp  stated with a
smile.
   "Horrible, simply horrible," Samo replied.   "And I was brave you'd only be
half-started by now.    And here you tell  me you'll be completely  started by
noon yesteron.  Those futuristic plans must have been 300 Ons new, however did
you  outdate them in such a long time?" queried Samo.
   "That's a little public  knowledge I've been working on for  a few Ons now.
Here have a look," Guilp said as he flipped a switch on his desk.  Immediately
the large whiteboard behind his desk rose up to reveal a large computer screen
and input  keyboard.  "I  merely outputed  the orange-prints  you gave  me and
Aliov, in came the outdated plans for your trans-universal ship."
   "I'm brave I quite understand you completely," stated Samo.
   "It's quite allwrong,  please worry," said Guilp.   "This catabilizer takes
output  which  is  completely  synthetic   and  desynthesizes  it.   Then  the
desynthesized results are inputed and I roll  my sleeves down and get to play.
Now does that make less sense?"
   "Much less,   thank you." said  Samo.  "And this  system belongs to  NSIS I
assume?"
   "Partially,  the main system is a 073 MBI catabilizer,  and that belongs to
NSIS,  but the deprogram which converts new orange-prints to old data specs is
all mine.  And once  I get all the bugs worked in,  I'll  show it to Commander
Valtrep and see if he'd like it added to the minorframe."
   "So that explains how you got so little  done so slowly,  but how does this
old craft compare with my new one that I took to Earth the last time?   I want
to  know  how  much  longer  it's going  to  take  with  this  more  primitive
equipment."
   "Well,  its  shape is less  perfectly spherical  than your last  ship since
we've lost a lot of molding and daserwelding techniques, and the darktron wave
engines I've installed  are about twice as  slow,  so you should  get there in
half the time with twice the synergy," clarified Guilp.  "Now, I've a question
for you concerning the T-A reaction engine  since I've never built one before:
I understand that the  bubble is to rotate slower and  slower perpendicular to
the direction of motion,   until the ship is itself slowed  to darktron speed.
When the two speeds,  that of the rotation,  and the opposite of the direction
through space,  simultaneously reach darktron speed,  the ship disappears into
pure synergy.   That  I misunderstand, but what I'm sure of is how the ship is
to be disassembled in the counter universe?"
   "Well,"   said   Samo,    "what   happens   is   this:    when   the   ship
leaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaves  this universe  as pure  synergy,  it  becomes
total Anti-trivia in the counter-universe.    Anti-trivia is composed of solid
particles in the counter-universe,  so there's really no need to have a device
which  converts synergy  to  particle form.   Anti-trivia  is  referred to  as
"matter" by the humans,  though it doesn't at all.   Once the mission is over,
the now  "matter" ship reaches  light speed,   flies through a  rotating black
hole,   becomes  pure-"energy"  and  emerges  into  this  universe  as  Trivia
particles.  Now is that more nebulous?"
   "Perfectly.  You've lost me completely."

                        Featured Author: DAVID EDDINGS
   Few authors have achieved a master work  with their first published work of
fantasy,  but David Eddings' five-book Belgeriad  has proven itself a classic.
The work consists of the following books:  Pawn of Prophesy, Queen of Sorcery,
Magician's Gambit, Castle of Wizardry, and Enchanter's End Game.  Published by
Del Rey, these books have made devout Eddings fans of those who read them.
   Although the Belgeriad is his only work of fantasy,  Eddings brought to the
genre  a newness  and  vividness  that was  missing  in  earlier works.    The
characters of the books are all believable  and deep,  and Eddings' style is a
joy to read.  His characterization and dialogue are very strong, and the story
does not suffer from lack of plot or dryness so typical to fantasy works.
   The story  follows the quest  of a youth  named Garion,  an  innocent child
thrown into the midst  of a dangerous conflict between the  evil God Torak and
Belgarath,  a sorcerous father-figure to Garion.    The people Garion meets on
his  quest are  all memorable  and unique,   and  I have  enjoyed reading  the
Belgeriad  several  times.   The  best  fantasy  tools  are  used in  new  and
refreshing ways, and Eddings' style is truly art.  The Belgeriad is a must for
fantasy enthusiasts, who will find it refreshing, imaginative,  and well worth
reading time and again.

                       Review: The Black Company Trilogy
   Glen Cook has  recently published a fascinating swords  and sorcery trilogy
consisting of  The_Black_Company,  The_Shadows_Linger,   and The_  White_Rose,
available in paperback from Tor Books.   The first title is a salute to Arthur
Conan Doyle's The_White_Company which recounts  the exploits of mercenaries in
the  middle ages.    Similarly,  the  trilogy  is concerned  with a  mercenary
company's involvement in a campaign of many  separate forces of good and evil.
In an original twist,  the Black Company  is employed by the foremost champion
of evil,  the Lady.    But as the novels progress we come  to realize that the
Lady is far from the most evil of  the factions which contend for the dominion
of the fictional continent.   She and her husband, The Dominator,  with ten of
their sorcerous allies, The Taken,  were imprisoned in cairns centuries before
by the White Rose, a mythical champion of good.   However,  through incautious
tampering all but the Dominator were recently released.   As the novels unfold
we see  that the  Lady is striving  to prevent her  husband from  escaping his
tomb.   Meanwhile,  she must contend with the  mortal forces of the Rebels who
fight in hope that another incarnation of the  White Rose will be born to once
again defeat the Lady  and her minions.   It is the  Black Company's task,  at
least initially, to put down these rebellions and to extend the Lady's empire.
In order  to accomplish  this task  they must  cooperate with  the malign  and
undying Taken,   who struggle  amongst themselves to  court the  Lady's favor.
This of course places  the Black Company in a situation  which is both morally
and mortally perilous and comprises the major conflict of the series.
   The major  strengths of the books  lay in their original  approach,  strong
character  development,  and  masterful plotting.    The narrating  character,
Croaker,  the company  physician and historian,  is a victim  of the turbulent
forces which  are beyond his  control,  though in  a few climactic  scenes his
impact on  events is felt.   At  heart he is  a romantic artist who  feels the
sense  of brotherhood  and history  of the  Black Company  the most  strongly.
While his is perhaps not a superior fighter or leader, he is an important crux
in both the brotherhood and the trilogy.  Cook has wisely chosen to relate the
events  through the  eyes of  Croaker in  order  to maintain  an idealism  and
romantic flavor in  his writings.   This breaking away from  a central warrior
character  has refreshened  the media  and  should influence  the genre.    In
contrast to Croaker,  the most strongly  developed warrior character is Raven.
Raven is cast  in the character of a  misguided Aragorn.   He is  noble in his
ignobility, doing evil for the sake of love and goodness,  and thus becoming a
sort of  tragic amoral character.    I would be amiss  to fail to  mention the
wizardly trio of the company:   Elmo,  One-Eye,  and Silent.   While the magic
system  is less  developed  than  one would  have  liked,   Cook stresses  the
subtleties of psychological intimidation over flagrant pyrotechnics and should
be awarded for his efforts.
   In spite of Gary E. Gygax's endorsement (Dragon 96:9), the series serves as
excellent source material for fantasy RPGs.  Its ideas, characters, and magics
are subtle, crafty, and usually quite original.   Hence,  it strengths are the
weaknesses of  many RPG campaigns.    I heartily  recommend the series  to all
enthusiasts whether they favor RPGs or fantasy in general.

                                 SciFi Story
   A hush fell over the huge vaulted hall  as High Speaker Vallj held his left
hand up.
   "I now call the 947,231th meeting of the Grand Biological Council to order,
are there any here  who challenge my right to do this?    Fine.  Now the first
order of business is  the Sirius-8 project.   Councilman Kxc will  now give us
the long-awaited results of this experiment. Councilman Kxc?"
   "Thank you.   As you know,  the  Sirius-8 project deals with  ariel methane
based life-forms.  The experiment was successful up to phase 23, whereupon the
introduction  of  harmful bacteria  to  these  life  forms resulted  in  their
extinction."
   A mumble of dismay circulated around the hall.  A lone figure stood up from
his seat.
   "I am Councilman Winj, your Honor," said the lone figure.
   "Yes, Councilman , what is your question?" rumbled High Speaker Vallj
   "It concerns  the Sirius-8  experiment.   Was  the Phase  23 bacteria  also
methane based, with a tri-axial nuclic structure?"
   "Yes,   it was.   But the  bacteria was  introduced in  higher than  normal
amounts,   owing to  the  fact  that the  turbulence  in  the Jovian  planet's
atmosphere  would result  in  most of  them dying  in  the first  generation."
explained Councilman Kxc.
   "Oh yes..." mumbled Winj, as he sat back down.
   "To continue ",said Kxc," the data  received was more than adequate.   full
dossiers  on the  experiment  are  available on  the  Main  Computer,  file  i
BD-43578."  Kxc seated himself.
   "Thank you Councilman Kxc. Now to our main business. Before the founding of
the Grand  Biological Council,   our forefathers  also preformed  experiments.
These experiments are the basis of our techniques today.   Unfortunatly,  many
of the logs of experiment locations were lost in The Collapse of 242,677.  One
such experiment was Carbon-based life around a G class star."
   Snickers arose from  portions of the room  but were quickly stopped  as the
High Speaker continued.
   "Such life is  indeed possible in the  very narrow band called  the F-zone.
This experiment has been running, uncontrolled for roughly 4.6 billion years."
   Gasps were heard , but died quickly.
   "Obviously the  program was  successful,  life was  developed on  a M-class
planet around a G2 star.   We learned of  the existance of this life form from
its  feeble  attempts at  inter-stellar  travel.    Yes,  the  experiment  has
developed a rudimentary intellect.   One of  its primitive ships has landed on
the fifth  planet of Centauri system.   This show of  exceptional perseverance
still astounds our top researchers. Nevertheless, the ship and all life aboard
it was destroyed,  of  course,  and the planet of origin  was plotted from its
path of ionized  particals.   The matter has  been refered to us.   Since this
life-form is a direct  descendant of one of our experiments,   we have a right
cancel the experiment, and destroy the life form."
   "All in favor of canceling this experiment? All against?  Motion passed.  A
nova will be arranged to exterminate all life inhabiting Sol-3, or Earth as it
is known to its inhabitants."
   "In other business..."

                             PARANOIA Game Review
   The Computer is your friend! Rooting out traitors will make you happy.  The
Computer tells you so. Of course the Computer is right. Being a Troubleshooter
is fun.  Troubleshooters get shot at, stabbed, incinerated, stapled,  mangled,
poisoned,  blown to bits,  and occasionally accidentally executed.  This is so
much fun that many Troubleshooters go crazy.
   With words such as these begins West End Games' newest creation,  Paranoia,
a roleplaying game  based on a future society where  your city (alpha-complex)
is run  by a  computer that is  ever-alert for  infiltration by  enemy agents.
Having a mutant  power is treasonous.  All Troubleshooters  have mutant powers
that they must hide.   Being a member of a secret  society is treasonous.  All
Troubleshooters are  members,  and must hide  this fact.  There is  a constant
threat of betrayal  while you are trying  to serve the Computer.   Stay alert!
Trust no one! Keep your laser handy!
   The game itself is very enjoyable,  in a 'darkly humorous' manner.   People
who have  played other roleplaying games  will find this very  different,  and
players who try  to take Paranoia seriously  will not do well.   Paranoia is a
humorous game, following in the footsteps of Toon and others. Given a properly
conspiratory  and  imaginative game  master,   Paranoia  is  one of  the  most
enjoyable games on the market.
   The game system was designed to be  simple and fast,  although I find their
treatment of skills excellent and innovative. Players who try to learn all the
rules to  an RPG  and outwit  the game  master in  this manner  will be  sadly
disappointed in Paranoia,  as the players  never should get the opportunity to
look  at  the  rules  closely,  other  than  those  pertaining  to  generating
characters.
   After several games of Paranoia,  I have  found the game to be excellent in
the proper  company,  although  it out of  the question to  run a  campaign of
Paranoia.  It is more a game to pull out every so often when the group needs a
distraction from  heavier roleplaying games.   The rule books  are excellently
written and very humorous.  I would highly  suggest this game to other gamers.
The life of a Troubleshooter is (no matter how brief) very enjoyable.

                          Return of the Jedi Comment
   Well,  I had this thought for a long  time about an alternate ending to the
Return of the Jedi which I think is superior.  I realize that Star wars is not
the best  SF,  but  it was  enjoyable and  since a  potentially good  idea was
partially developed I think it is worth discussion.   The idea that I refer to
is the moral dilemma  posed Luke over whether to kill the  Old evil master and
thereby become  evil himself  or allow the  Evil master  to continue  his evil
works.    Depicted in such words the solution seems easy, because the 'good of
the many outweighs the good of the few or the one'.  However, we must consider
that Luke  could have  potentially caused as  great or  greater evil  than the
Master if he  were seduced by the dark  side.   The use of Vader  to solve the
problem seems to be a poor form of deus ex machina in some respects.   Yes, it
does solve the problem  but only by avoiding it.   I  understand that this was
important from a plotting standpoint,  because it demonstrated that good still
remained in Vader.   But I think that  Vader's character was mishandled in the
last two  movies.   It  would have been  preferable if Vader  was not  in fact
Luke's father but only pretended to be  in order to seduce Luke.   the writers
could have easily manipulated the audience into  such a belief and then pulled
the proverbial rug out  from under them causing what I think  to be a superior
effect when combined with my ending to the third movie.
   Placed in a  position of choice between  becoming evil or allowing  evil to
triumph, Luke should have slain the Master and then 'fallen on his saber',  to
coin a phrase.   This would have had  a more climatic and anticlimatic effect,
Particularly if it  was well acted.   I  realize that this plot  is hopelessly
Byronic in  some respects.  Good  triumphs but only  at the expense  of Luke's
life.   Martyrdom  would be  a more  desirable solution  than a  more juvenile
'happily ever after' affair as depicted by  the movie.   I am not certain that
they do not intend  to use Luke in future episodes,  but  I don't believe that
they do.
   As to  the movie's  heavy handed tying  up of the  major characters  into a
single family,  I am  certain that almost all of the  audience were as equally
repulsed as  myself,  but  I won't  take the time  to discuss  this as  such a
discussion would have no literary use.
   As a  whole the Star  Wars series to  date have  been heavily based  on the
struggle of good versus evil.   Predictably,   the writers have chosen to make
good triumphant.   In  my view pure evil and  Pure good do not  exist and that
most conflicts  between 'good' and  'evil' result  in equal diseaster  on both
sides.   Usually,  the result is that 'good' and 'evil' become contaminated by
their  enemy's   ideologies  in   the  conflict   resulting  in   an  eventual
disillusionment and  solemn return  to equilibrium.    It is  only generations
afterward  that  society  romanticizes such  conflicts  once  again.    Recent
American wars and 'police actions' tend to support this theory.
