     Well, I  told you  that 5-2 would  be right on  the heels  of 5-1! 
 Had it  not been  for the fact  that our 3705  burned in  flames, this 
 file might  have actually made  it on time!  As for 5-3,  Jeanne Dixon 
 has said that  it will be out  the second weekend in  August, so watch 
 your reader queues!
     Actually,  to tell  you the  truth,  we've managed  to lure  three 
 unknowing and  unsuspecting amateur  authors into the  Dargon Project, 
 and they're  cooking up stories faster  than I can print  them! 5-3 is
 actually all set  to go out, save  that I have to  finidh writing *my* 
 story for that  issue! And it promises to be  an excellent issue, with
 stories from  myself and each of  the three new authors.  But I'll let
 you wait for that. 
     This issue  contains the beginnings  of two serials, one  a Dargon 
 story (my own,  in three parts), the other an  unrelated piece by Joel
 Slatis, one  of the  three new  authors. Stuffed  in around  the edges 
 are a short  story by Ovis, another  new author, and part  two of Rich 
 Jervis' "Spirit  of the  Wood". Two  other points and  then on  to the
 issue.  Firstly, due  to extremely  poor timing,  the day  I sent  out 
 FSFNET 5-1,  the userid  of one  of the  contributors changed.  If you 
 are  interested  in contacting  the  person  who was  advertising  the 
 national  gaming organization,  the  userid  is now  C4898002@UMSLVMA,
 rather than  S4898002. Or  was it  the other  way round?  Finally, I'd
 like to  welcome the  new members,  and remind  everyone once  more to
 keep spreading the  word about FSFnet. It is, as  I've been saying all 
 along, your zine, not mine.  Enjoy!

                     Spirit of the Wood: Chapter Two
     Loric  had no  chance to  reply  to Oldsir's  query because  their
 dialog  was interrupted a the  high  whistling call  from below  them. 
 Oldsir looked  down and said to  himself "So soon..." "Loric  the call
 has been given.  You must go below  and stand on the  ground with your 
 friends. I wish you luck." 
     Loric  looked at  his  grandfather and  then  closed the  distance 
 between them.  He hugged  the old man fiercely and  said "If  it means 
 your time of death has come closer, I won't go! "
     "Here now,  is that  the voice of  a Tolorion I  hear? Are  you so
 strong that you can wrestle with  time itself?  My time has  come, but 
 so has  yours But do  not let the  fate of an  old man deter  you from
 doing your  best! I will  be watching you as  all of your  tribe will, 
 to see  that honor is  maintained and that the  Spirit of the  Wood is
 not broken.  Now go, son of  my son. And  may the dew never  settle on
 your  brow!" With  that  blessing  Oldsir turned  and  leaped off  the
 porch of his  house and deftly caught a vine  some yards below. Before 
 Loric could call out to him he was lost from sight. 
     "Thank  you Oldsir,"  He  said  softly, "Goodbye,Grandfather."  He 
 barely heard  the second sounding  of the  call and threw  himself off
 the platform with a vengeance.  He went downward  recklessly, allowing 
 the  bare minimum  margin  for  safety. He  hit  the  ground hard  and
 lightly bruised,  but in one piece.  Without a glance at  the gathered
 downlander's he  strode to  the center  of the  circle where  they had
 gathered  and stood  with head  held high  and body  erect. Determined
 that his Grandfather's last wish would be granted. 

     Loric tried  to stay  aloof from  the others,  hoping to  keep his 
 anger fired,  but the excited  conversation around him  kept intruding
 on his thoughts.
     "Going for  it again,  eh Hiram?  Maybe you'll get  to the  top of 
 the Home-tree this time."
     "Go  jump  Jakul,I  made  the   Tree-climbing  test,  it  was  the
 Net-walking that did me in last time." 
     "You were  lucky then, if you'd  made that they would  have thrown 
 you into  the Pit. My  brother Yione was  there for three  days before 
 they dragged him out.  He still won't talk about that  one but I think
 they used snakes on him, he never did like them." 
     "Snakes I don't  mind, but there's worse. They  say there's always
 one test  you can't pass. And  then there's always the  Shreaving. Hey
 there's  Loric. Loric!  What's in  the pit  eh? Snakes  or spiders  or 
 just a few wild dogs to gnaw your bones! Hah-hah!" 
     Loric looked  at his friends  and smiled thinly. "Whatever  it is, 
 it couldn't be as  mean as you two! I still remember  the time you two
 put that  bee-comb in my  sister's bed and  the ant's all  but carried
 her off!  I couldn't  catch you  then, but  maybe after  today, you'll 
 not be so fast? 
     I  think a  tree-crab  could walk  away with  what's  left of  you
 after the test and no one would notice."
     "Jakul  we  made  a  mistake  even  speaking  to  this  one,  he's 
 obviously the  first test;  to see  how long  we'll stand  here before 
 stringing him up by his toes!"
     Hiram  made  a  feint  towards  Loric which  he  dodged  and  then
 grabbed His  friends arm  and pressed  his thumb  into the  wrist. The
 scene was  on the verge of  becoming a tussle when  the third sounding
 of the  Call was made  and the late  arrivals noisily joined  the trio
 in the council  circle. Under his breath Hiram asked,  "What's up your 
 tree Loric, you used  to take that guff and pass  it out fresh?" Loric 
 looked  side-ways at  his friend.  "Sorry,  Hiram. It's  just that  my
 grandfather has had his second vision."
     Hiram stepped back and then asked "Did he tell you what it was?"
     "No, only  that his time  had come...and mine too!  Shhh! Dernhelm
 is  looking at  you--turn around!"  Loric  spun his  friend around  to
 face his  uncle. He waited for  the silence to spread  to all present, 
 even the  young children  were silent.  Somehow feeling  the intensity
 of the moment.
     "Know  you children  of  the Village  in the  Trees,  what is  the
 benefit of the Arborskill?" 
     Loric and the  others replied as one; "Yes, my  chief. my eyes and 
 the eyes  of my tribe, my  hands and the  hands of my tribe,  my heart 
 and the heart, ears, and tongue of my tribe will  become keener, and I 
 will  know the  joy  of life  from  the  Spirit of  the  Wood. I  will 
 adapt,and my tribe will live. 
     I will  take the offerings  of the Wood,  and make new  and better
 things  things for  the living.  The Arborskill  honors and  protects, 
 and the seasons change."
     "What do you need to achieve the Arborskill?" 
     "My Kesh-blade, my chief." 
     "Only this?"
     "My wits , my chief."
     "This is all?" 
     "And my song , My chief,and my hands." 
     "Do you have these four things?"
     "I have  them, my chief, My  wits are as  keen as my blase  and my
 hands are as strong as my song. My song is strong, my chief!"
     "Then show  your tribe what you  know. What is the  first craft of
 the Arborskill?" 
     "The first craft of the Arborskill is the Lashing." 
     At this  loric looked about him.  In the circle were  poles he was 
 to use as a  rope walk, but there was no grass  gathered to plait into
 a lashing. 
     Realizing that the  cane fields were a long-run away  and the reed
 marshes even  further than that,  several of  the boys waved  to their 
 families  and  sprinted   off  into  the  woods.   Loric  started  out 
 muttering under  his breath. He  has went  only a short  distance when
 he stopped.  This can't  be right!  he thought. It  will take  most of
 the day  just to  gather the  grass  and return  with it,  and there's 
 more tests after this one!
     Loric  looked back  at  the circle  of logs  where  the tribe  sat
 silently.  There were  more  logs  than usual  around  the  fire  pit,
 leaving several unoccupied  or with only one person to  a log. The new 
 logs were  still dark  with bark  and the  scent came  to Loric  as he 
 walked back into the circle.
     The  acrid  smell   of  Liamas  trees  greeted   him.  Of  Course! 
 Adaption!  Loric had  been taught  how to  plait grass  and vines  but 
 there was a  no reason he couldn't  do the same with  the fibrous bark
 of the Liamas tree.
     He ran  across the clearing to  where his sister sat  with several
 of the other young women.
     "Loric I  see no  grass for  you to weave,  perhaps you  intend to
 weave the air into a rope?"
     Loric was  stung by his sister's  words but caught the  twinkle in 
 her eye that meant to Loric that he must be close to an answer.
     Formally he stood before his sister and said: 
     "I ask that you give up your seat my sister,  so that your brother
 may become a man."
     Silsia gave  up a cheer.  "Ai-ya! Ai-Ya!  Little Loric would  be a
 man and make his sister stand!" She laughed and stood by her friends. 
     "Come sisters, we  must move for near-man Loric  who already knows
 how to act like a man!"
     Loric  drew his  knife from  it's  sheaf and  started cutting  the 
 bark from the log in long strips.

                         The Glory of Adventuring 
     "So this  is how  it will  all end," thought  Glanaril as  he sank 
 slowly to  a sitting position against  the cold, black cave  wall. "We 
 were  all  so  tough,  so  grown  up  and  ready  to  make  names  for
 ourselves, so wrong..."
     Glanaril  knew he  didn't  have long,  the  hideous beast's  claws
 were  so covered  with filth  that the  poison on  them could  kill an 
 ogre.  Unfortunately he  had taken  more than  a scrape  in the  fight
 with it.  It had  come upon them  only minutes ago,  a time  when they
 had been the  most famous adventurers in the world  (or would be soon, 
 after they  managed to  kill Lothgar  the Black  and rescue  all those 
 lonely, misguided  gold rilks).  The horrible  guardian beast  had not
 sneaked  up  on them,  no,  it  had  come  straight at  them,  slowly, 
 allowing  them plenty  of  time to  ready spells  and  form an  attack 
 plan. They  had smelled  it coming  long before they  met it.  Oh, but 
 once they  met it  )) it  became a living  death machine.  Granted the
 beast was very  large, but one beast against a  party of well equipped
 adventurers,  ha  ha ))  no  problem.  Glanaril  smiled grimly  as  he
 remembered his thoughts as he handled his trusty spear.
     It wouldn't  be long now,  the pain  was growing, working  its way
 up from the horrible  gash he has received in his  side. His armor was
 like butter before the thing's claws.
     Glanaril glanced about  him at the remains of  his party. Katrina, 
 a pretty  spellcaster, lay  in a  heap against the  far wall.  She had 
 been  concentrating  on  a  spell  and had  not  avoided  the  beast's 
 backswipe with  its great  foreleg and she'd  been tossed  against the
 jagged stone  wall as  easily as a  man swats a  fly. Carly,  a hobbit
 thief, was now  unrecognizable as such. He had tried  to maneuver to a
 position  behind the  thing so  that he  might hamstring  it. Just  as
 he'd raised his dagger  to do so, the beast had taken  a step back and 
 placed its great hind leg right on  top of him. So  much for crippling
 it. Harth  died trying to  help Katrina. He  had seen Katrina  go down 
 and rushed  to help her, thinking  that the three fighters  could keep
 the beast  at bay  while he  cast a  spell of  healing. He  was wrong. 
 Harth turned  his back  on the  beast and bent  over Katrina  to begin
 his work and  so did not see  the great claw coming  which ripped down 
 his back  and pulled him  back into the jaws  of its owner.  The other
 two  fighters, Jaron  and Jakon,  were  thrown into  one another  with 
 force enough  to kill them both,  the reason they were  unable to keep 
 Harth safe.
     And  Glanaril  had seen  them  all  die  as  he stood  there,  too
 stunned to  believe that  all his  friends had died  in less  than two
 minutes.  Then  the  thing  had  turned to  him  and  lunged  directly
 towards him. Glanaril  set his spear against the wall  to protect him. 
 But he had  missed. The spear had  scored a hit in  the right shoulder
 of  the  creature, not  enough  to  cause it  to  blink.  It came  on,
 pushing the spear into  its shoulder, and took a swipe  at him. It did 
 not miss. He was  already against the wall and had no  place to go, he
 took the full  force of the claw and went  sprawling sideways, knowing 
 that this  was it.  He awoke shortly  thereafter. Looking  around told 
 him  that the  beast had  gone. His  spear lay  in the  middle of  the 
 cave, broken in two.
     "So  much  for fame  and  glory,"  he  thought, "our  whole  party 
 killed  by a  common  black  bear, and  not  even  close to  Lothgar's 
 stronghold, not even close..." And the darkness closed in.

                     Respect thy Elders: Chapter One 
     Kite  bounded up  the granite  stairs to  the portals  of Winthrop
 Keep.  Winthrop  was   a  small  holding,  perhaps   a  dozen  leagues 
 southwest of  Dargon. Recently,  Kite, an aspiring  young lord  of the 
 house of  Talador, a wealthy duchy  south of Winthrop, was  engaged to 
 Pecora,  the only  child  of the  ruler of  Winthrop.  But this  sunny
 morning, Kite  had received a  message from Mistress  Izetta, Pecora's
 woman-in-waiting and  nursemaid of many  years, asking him to  come at 
 once to Winthrop  Keep. It seemed that Pecora had  fallen ill, but the 
 note had revealed little more.
     Kite walked  quickly through  the halls  he knew  so well.  He had
 often visited  Pecora during their  courtship, and had  cherished each 
 moment within  these walls.  Yet he strode  to Pecora's  room quickly,
 and without  any emotion more  evident than  concern. At last  he came
 to the  door to her  chambers, and  rapped anxiously. After  a moment,
 an older woman quietly opened the door and bade Kite enter. 
     He  entered into  a spacious  and well-decorated  lounge area.  He 
 hardly noticed  as the  woman guided  him to a  seat. "What  is wrong,
 Mistress Izetta?"
     "Pecora is  ill. Last  night she  went weak and  pale as  a ghost. 
 She is not  well, milord. Come speak  to her." With that,  she led him 
 to the  bedchamber, where Pecora  lay. She did  not see Kite  until he
 had knelt  beside her.  She tried  to speak, but  could not,  but Kite 
 could see her words in her questioning eyes. 
     "I am  here, love.  It will  be all right.  I promise."  He kissed
 her  forehead,  and  she  closed  her eyes.  He  stood,  and  the  two
 silently returned to the entry.
     After a  few moments, Izetta  spoke. "Milord,  I have done  what I 
 can for  her, but  I have  seen this disease  before, many  years ago,
 when  we lived  in the  south. It  was my  mother." Kite  knew by  the
 servant's downcast eyes that her mother had not survived. 
     "Is there  anything you  can do?" he  asked, futilely,  seeing the 
 weariness in her eyes. 
     "I have  done all I  can. Yet there may  be something you  can do,
 if you have  a strong heart. I  remember when my mother  was dying, my
 father saying  that an Elder would  possess the knowledge to help her.
 He sent  friends to seek an  Elder named Isentraum, but  none believed 
 him, and he would not leave my mother. Do you know of the Elders?"
     "I have heard  the tales, but I thought the  Elders were all dead. 
 The legends say they lived hundreds of years ago!"
     The woman smiled.  "And so they did, and still  do, for the Elders
 know far  more than  any nursemaids  or even great  lords. If  you can
 find an Elder, he will know how to save Pecora, for I know not." 
     "Yet where  shall I look?  The Elders all  are said to  have lived 
 far from other people, or in secret places." 
     "If you  ride southwest,  you will pass  many villages,  and after 
 several days  come upon  a great  lake. This is  where my  father sent
 men to search for the Elder Isentraum. Look there, and godspeed."
     After  a moment  of hesitation,  Kite  stood. The  anxiety he  had
 fought  to contain  finally had  an outlet,  and there  was hope  that 
 Pecora would be healed. He would search for the Elder. 

     Kite wrapped  his cloak  tightly around him,  but the  rain soaked 
 through, chilling  him as  his horse  slowly plodded  up the  slope of
 the valley where Winthrop was nestled. To keep his cheer up, he talked 
 to Dagley, his horse. 
     "Well, Dag,  this is it.  The quest has  begun. But it  isn't much 
 of a quest,  eh? Here we are,  trudging out of town in  the rain. This
 isn't one  of those  quests the  minstrels will  sing about,  that's a
 certainty; the  hero, plodding along  on his soggy mount,  watches his 
 sword rust in  the scabbard because all the monsters  are inside where
 it is  dry and won't  come out to fight!"  The horse turned  his head, 
 looking at Kite,  who tried to fathom  what the horse might  say if he 
 could speak. 
     Eventually  they reached  the  ridge above  the  valley, and  Kite 
 turned to  view the town below.  After a few silent  moments he turned
 the horse and headed off towards the west, silent and contemplative.

                    Ceda the Executioner: Chapter One
     A tall lonely  figure dressed in black  strode confidently through 
 the  Desert of  the Hidden  Army (or  Grobsts D'arbos  Desert as  some
 prefer to call it.)
     It had  been called  that ever  since the  High King  of Grandydyr 
 rode through leading a vast army to battle some 10,000 years earlier. 
     Grobst D'arbo  was high king of  the biggest country of  his time. 
 He  controlled a  massive  army  of strong  men  who  were all  battle 
 trained, well equipped  and fearless. They were crossing  the waste in
 the  area that  Ceda now  rode  when, as  the  tale goes,  one of  the 
 routine scouts  rode up ahead  of the troops  as usual, to  survey the
 surrounding area for scouts of the opposing forces. 
     That  night,  after a  thorough  search  of  the area,  the  scout
 returned and to  his horror found the entire army  of 500,000 men dead
 and the king lying  at the head of the troops,  still alive. The scout 
 jumped  from his  horse and  ran to  the fallen  king who  told him  a 
 message.  The message,  however, has  long since  been forgotten  (for
 about  1000  years) but  it  is  said that  the  message  is of  grave 
 importance to the entire world in the years to come. 
     The kings head  fell back into the hands of  the shocked scout who
 lay the  king down gently  on the ground. Then  the scout stood  up to
 look  upon his  fallen majesty  who, by  some unknown  force, now  lay
 dead  at his  feet. Then  a peculiar  thing happened:  the kings  body
 seemed to  melt and change.  The horrified  scout watched as  the body
 of  the king  altered into  that  of a  tree. The  scout could  hardly
 believe what had  happened and he stood gazing upon  the tree until he 
 fainted from the sun. 
     Some time  after that, the opposing  army drew near and  the scout 
 was found lying  in the shade of  the tree. The army  of Grandydyr was
 no where to  be seen and they  were never heard from  again. The scout 
 , before  his execution at  the hands of  his captors, told  them what 
 had taken  place, then he  died by  decapitation, but the  story lived
 on. And  to this  day, people  who wish  to travel  are warned  of the 
 Desert  of  the Hidden  Army,  for  it is  foretold  that  one day,  a 
 certain weary traveler will find it. 
     This, however,  was just a  child's fairy  tale and thought  to be
 mendacious, for almost  none of the numerous people  that cross though
 the  gigantic wasteland  ever come  across the  tree of  Grobst D'arbo 
 and no  one really ever believed  the story that they  told... if they 
 lived to tell it. 
     It was  this tree that Ceda  was now approaching and  he looked at
 the surrounding  desert for any possible  source of water, but  as far
 as the  eye could  see, and  even beyond that,  there was  nothing but
 the golden sand upon which he now strode. 
     The area  around the tree was  littered with dead bodies.  Most of
 them were  now nothing more than  bleached bones, but one  or two were 
 still clad, dead  only for about 3 months, all  from deep wounds. Ceda
 looked  at  them  in  disgust  but   then  forgot  about  them  as  he
 contemplated the  tree, having  previously thought that  it was  but a
 tale of children.
     The  story echoed  in his  head for  sometime as  he made  his way
 through the sand.  The only thing besides him and  his wingless dragon
 mount, Melgon,  was the  single tree;  not even  insects lived  in the 
 Desert of  the Hidden Army and  only seldomly did birds  venture in to 
 feast on a dead animal.
     The tree  itself was  not particularly tall  and didn't  look very 
 healthy for  that matter.  It was  about the height  of Ceda  and only 
 some of  the leaves that  now grew on it  were green. The  roots stuck
 out of the  ground in an odd  fashion and seemed to be  warped in some
 peculiar way that Ceda did not notice. 
     He  stopped to  look at  it as  they passed  and Melgon  swung his 
 head around to  see why they had  stopped. Unable to look  at the tree 
 because of the  heavy armor that reached from the  dragons head to the 
 base of it tail,  it shifted its body around and  slowly glanced up at 
 the  phenomenon.  Ceda,  amused  by this  sorcerers  work,  knowing  a
 little sorcery  himself, he advanced  on the  tree until the  reins of 
 his mount pulled tightly at his hand.
     "Come  on,  Melgon, this  thing  won't  harm  you, fear  not."  He 
 tugged  again at  the reins,  but this  time harder  and in  turn, the 
 dragon strengthened  his foothold.  Obvious that  the dragon  would go
 no further  in the  direction of  the tree, he  dropped the  reins and 
 continued towards it alone. 
     Even  as he  approached, the  tree sensed  that Ceda  had no  good 
 intentions and  began to  shake as if  it was warning  him to  come no 
 closer. It  was almost  as if a  wind were blowing  the tree  but Ceda
 could  feel  nothing of  this  wind  and  neither could  his  wingless 
 dragon  mount, Melgon.  The closer  that Ceda  drew, the  stronger the
 wind blew. Melgon  began to back away as the  wind grew even stronger.
 "Stay,  Melgon,"  came Ceda's  voice  fiercely  as  he turned  at  the 
 dragon.  The only  answer that  he  received was  a low  growl as  the
 dragon halted. 
     He  reached the  tree and  the  wind grew  greater, and  all of  a
 sudden, the gusts  focussed of Ceda pushing him back  by surprise. His
 long black  hair flew  back to  reveal a  handsome face  with piercing 
 black eyes, a  short, straight nose, tight thin lips  and a firm chin. 
 The gusts  of wind  knocked Ceda  off balance  and he  was momentarily 
 pushed back  before he  again struggled  to get  to the  tree. Finally 
 after five  long hard  steps, he  had reached it  again and  he lifted 
 his  hand to  touch one  of it's  leaves, his  long black  cape waving 
 wildly  under the  force of  the wind.  The wind  grew stronger  as he 
 grasp a leaf  of the growth. Then  he pulled at it with  all his might
 and  it came  off into  his hand.  Then the  wind stopped.  Ceda threw 
 himself against  the trunk of  the tree.  Then a noise  which startled
 Ceda for a  moment swam through the  hot desert air but  he relaxed as
 he recognized the low pitched moaning as a dragon laugh. 
     He  glanced menacingly  at Melgon  who  was still  laughing and  a 
 smile crossed  his lips. He picked  himself up and walked  back to his
 dragon mount. 
     "There, you  see? It's nothing more  than a little magic,  that is
 all.  Methinks the  old kings'  wizardry  must be  weakening over  the
 years...  or  perhaps  the  old  king  was not  as  strong  as  I  had
 expected." He opened his hand and examined the leaf. 
     It seemed  to crumble in  his hand and  turned to dust.  A worried
 expression  crossed Ceda's  face as  the wind  started again  and blew
 the dust up into his eyes momentarily blinding him.
     Then,  simultaneously, four  figures appeared  around the  warrior 
 as if  they had come  from the very  sand itself. Their  swords drawn,
 their  expressions covered  by the  shadows  of the  hoods which  hung 
 loosely  about their  heads.  Only  two gleaming  balls  of fire  were
 visible beneath  the hoods.  They wore  robes down  to their  feet and 
 wore gauntlets to shield their hands. 
     "Who are  you to question  the power  of Grobst D'arbo,  High king 
 of Grandydyr?" the voice came from within Ceda's head. 
     Ceda's  hand raced  for  the hilt  of his  sword,  the wind  still
 blowing at  him from  all directions.  He raised it  to strike  at the
 nearest  of the  advancing force  and swung.  The wind  changed course
 and blew the sword harmlessly down missing his opponent.
     The  attacker  swung at  Ceda's  head  and  seeing the  on  coming
 strike,  the warrior  raised his  sword to  parry and  again the  wind 
 changed course.  The blade was almost  blown out of his  grasp, but he 
 held on with all his strength to defend against the assault.
     Ceda,  seeing that  the fight  would lead  to nothing  but certain
 death, jumped  to his mount  and fought against  the wind to  ride out
 beyond the reach of the kings sorcerous winds and warriors. 
     They  had gone  fifty dragons  lengths  when the  wind ceased  and
 they could ride  unhampered. After a short period Ceda  looked back to 
 see if  the tree was  still in  sight and if  the four demons  had yet
 returned to  the underworld.  The worried  expression returned  to his
 face  as he  saw  the  four riding  devil  spawn  steeds with  crimson
 colored  fire  coming  from  their nostrils  with  every  breath.  The
 horses were  catching up  to him  and he  cursed himself  for tempting 
 the dead kings spirit. 
     Ceda  bent  down  low  on  his mount  and  spurred  it  on  faster 
 realizing the  full extent  of the  danger. If he  were killed  by the
 demons sent  after him,  his soul  would be damned  to serve  the dead 
 king in a state of half death and half life for all eternity.
     He  reached down  into the  saddle where  his spell  book was  and 
 pulled at  it. It came  out and almost as  quickly fell from  his hand
 to the ground.
     "Slow, Melgon.  I must retrieve  the book  if we are  to survive."
 The  dragon growled  in disapproval  as he  slowed and  turned to  the 
 book, but Ceda was  already upon it looking for the  spell in which he
 needed to escape his pursuers.
     He  marvelled  at  the  tenacity  of the  oncoming  demons  as  he 
 invoked the rune he had found that would aid him in escaping danger: 

                     "When at a time that I may fall 
                      Bring forth the winds, L'amron
                            To aid my call... 

                           Naar akbles gah dee 
                   Hegwray sde urngen tse dooh, L'amron
                        Faeer sforen cha haben..."

     First in his language and then in the language of the Wind God. 
     Black smoke rose  into the shallow desert air and  seemed to clump 
 together  as if  something had  sucked it  all into  a great  hovering
 mass.  Ceda glanced  back  at the  on coming  attackers  as the  smoke 
 filled the  sky. Then a  large figure of  black smoke loomed  over him 
 with a face far  darker than those that dwell in  the most dreadful of
 the caves of Arnmere.
     "Why have  you summoned  me from my  most restful  sleep, mortal?"
 The black smoke undulating as he talked. 
     "I have  summoned you  to aid  me in my  foray with  these demons, 
 Lord," he replied as he cast another glance at the oncoming attackers.
     "I  am, as  they are,  under  the rule  of the  Lord Ileiruon  and
 cannot aid thee  without incurring his wrath upon myself  as a result, 
 mortal.  Fare thee  well." The  wind sent  the smoke  swirling in  all 
 directions and at once the Wind Lord was gone.
     Ceda drew  his sword and  stood waiting the few  remaining seconds 
 for the  demons as his mount  retreated a safe distance  to survey the
 battle.  As the  riders approached,  the steeds  upon which  they rode 
 began to waver  and finally disappeared as they  reached their quarry.
 The demons  dropped to  the ground  from where they  had sat  on their 
 hellborn mounts and at once set upon Ceda.
     This time,  their was  no devil  wind to hinder  him as  he fought
 the attackers and  with ease he defended himself. Ceda  parried one of
 the swings  made by the  attacker and disarmed  him as a  result. Then 
 with lightning  quickness he lifted  his sword  up to unveil  the face
 of one  of his opponents and  in doing so revealed  a fleshless being. 
 All that  remained in  place of a  head was a  skull with  two crimson
 balls of light for eyes.
     All the  clothes worn by  the attackers  at once withered  to dust 
 as  Ceda  was  left  fighting   the  living  dead.  Four  odd  looking 
 skeletons  were before  him  and  were advancing  on  their prey,  the 
 foremost  wearing upon  his  bleached skull  a  richly designed  crown
 inlaid with  rare Malthoogian gems.  This one  was at least  twice the 
 size of the other three.
     Ceda attacked the  crowned figure and as he struck  under the same 
 defenses of it's sword,  the bones came apart and fell  to the sand in
 pieces. The  warrior formed a wry  smile and turned to  face the three
 remaining  opponents. But,  even  as he  turned,  the fourth  quickly, 
 magically reassembled itself and resumed the battle.
     Ceda looked  on in  utter horror as  his hosts  reassembled itself
 after  every blow,  realizing that  if  he didn't  think of  a way  to
 defeat his foe, it would defeat him. 
     Then the solution  to beating the wizardry came to  him. He turned 
 sharply avoiding the  trust of one of the smaller  demons and swung at 
 it before it  regained its balance, Ceda hit it  hard knocking it into 
 a pile  of bones.  Then with  lightning speed, he  grabbed at  the odd 
 skull dropped  it into  his pouch.  Then it's bones  seemed to  dry up 
 and wither into nothingness as Ceda fought on.
     The other  two fell easily  to Ceda's  blade and he  deposited the 
 other  two skulls  into  his pouch.  Now  all that  was  left was  the 
 largest of the demons; The fire glowed in its eyes like two red stars. 
     "Now, you die!" It hissed and swung down at Ceda's head.
     Ceda parried  the thrust and  swung under the skeletons  sword. It 
 blocked and jabbed  for Ceda's head and  he had to jump  back to avoid 
 being  pierced through  his  neck.  Then he  lounged  at the  skeleton
 tearing its  bony arm  off and  its sword with  it. Then  the skeleton
 was easily  defeated by  Ceda's blade.  He swung so  that the  side of
 the  blade hit  turning the  massive  demon to  a pile  of milk  white
 bone.  As he  reached to  get the  the crown,  the demon  had time  to
 reform  and  before  he knew  it,  it  was  already  on its  feet  and
 advancing on him.
     "The crown," it said, its eyes gleaming brightly. "Give it to me."
     Ceda swung at the skeleton again and hit it, then hit the skull.
     And the skeleton crumbled.
     Then the voice  returned to his mind and said:  "Beware not to let
 the skulls lose,  for my demons will get you,"  and the voice laughed. 
 Then it was gone from his head. 
     Ceda  remembered the  warning and  he looked  into the  pouch. The 
 eyes of  the demons  had lost their  fire, as if  they had  died. Ceda
 knew of  the danger  that would  be released if  they ever  broke free
 and decided to keep them in case he found use for them. 
     Then he  turned his attention  to the crown.  It would be  worth a
 lot  of gold  in  any of  a  dozen cities  . He  rubbed  it a  little, 
 polishing it, and added it to his pouch on the saddle. 
     Then he  had a long drink  before he continued on  his way thought 
 the desert. 

     A  dark  figure  approached  the  westward gate  of  the  city  of 
 Pheeng'Am.  He did  not ride  the strange  wingless dragon  mount that 
 walked  next to  him. He  looked odd  as he  approached the  gate, for
 dragons were  very rare  and those that  were wingless  were legendary 
 at best. 
     When they  arrived at the  gate, one of  the city guards,  a Giant 
 from Weuyrt,  the land of  forests, (where  the caves of  Arnmere lie: 
 the home of the feared orcs and hobgoblins) approached them.
     "What  business have  you in  the  city of  Pheeng'Am?" his  burly
 voice made all in the area turn to give ear to the conversation.
     "I  am Ceda  of  No-Al  Ben (a  small  country  north of  Grobst's
 desert  from   which  Ceda   had  come,)"   he  said   proudly  before 
 continuing. "I wish  to enter the city for I  have traveled the desert 
 and am in need  of food and shelter before I can  continue on. Can you
 perhaps  tell  me where  the  nearest  inn  is?"  Ceda tried  to  look
 innocent, he  knew that the  guards seldom  admit those who  look like 
 they were there for foul purposes, as was the nature of Ceda. 
     "What is your purpose for traveling this land?" he persisted. 
     "I seek  am as a  hired sword where I  might find work."  The talk
 was beginning  to annoy him, but  he knew that there  was nothing that 
 he could do if he wanted to enter the city unharmed.
     "You?!?  A hired  sword? What's  the world  coming to?"  The giant
 mocked  him,  but  he  knew  the giant  was  testing  his  ability  to 
 withhold his temper, so he ignored this. The other guards laughed. 
     "Be  the  world  as it  may,  I  wish  to  enter the  city."  Ceda
 re-stated this with a slight tone of anger in it.
     The giant  thought about this  for a  minute and then  said: "Very 
 well now, you  may pass, but be weary  of the laws of the  city lest I
 have to find and slay you myself. Go now." 
     Relieved, Ceda continued past the giant and into the city.

     Pheeng'Am was  one of  the biggest  cities in  the land  of Ruirse 
 which  bordered the  Desert  of  Grobst. Its  large  populace was  due
 largely  to  the  fact  that   it  bordered  the  desert.  All  people
 traveling through usually  went there before continuing  on there way. 
 The Desert  separated the two  largest countries from one  another and
 south  of  that were  the  Sarshirian  mountains which  was  virtually
 impossible  to  get through  safely  because  they were  inhabited  by 
 evilly aligned creatures.
     Ceda, now  in the  city, headed  for the nearest  tavern to  get a 
 drink. He  disliked talking with  people which  is what he  would have
 to do in the tavern, but he had to meet someone there.
     Once in the  tavern, Ceda got himself a skin  of Ruirsian wine and 
 sat down  at one  of the  empty tables in  the back  so that  his face 
 fell into the shadow of the walls.
     Many  people were  in the  tavern, some  drunk, some  just walking 
 about but  Ceda looked for  just one  of them: an  elf by the  name of 
 Rincraw that  was to pay  him for  the service of  assassinating Berk, 
 the mighty king of the people of Caffthorn.
     Then he saw  him sitting at the  bar with a wooden cup  of wine in 
 his hand talking to  another elf. Ceda got up, walked  over to him and 
 tapped him  lightly on the  shoulder. The  elf turned quickly  and his
 hand flew to his sword, but he relaxed when he saw who it was.
     "Greetings,  Ceda, we  have been  expecting  you, and  a job  well 
 done to  you! I  believe we  owe you  this," he  handed the  warrior a
 sack full of gold coins and offered Ceda a drink of his wine. 
     "No  thanks," he  took the  sack  and made  his way  to the  door. 
 Feeling  the crown  in his  pouch as  he added  the sack  of gold,  he 
 thought a minute about  how to get the most money  for it and returned
 to the elf.
     "Have you ever  seen Grobst's tree while in the  desert?" he asked
 the elf slowly thinking about what he was going to say to him.
     "No, but  I've heard rumors, I  don't even know if  it still lives
 or even stands for that matter. Why, have you news of it?" 
     "I have.  I also  thought of  it as but  a tale  until 4  days ago
 when I  accidentally came  upon it.  All around  it was  littered with
 men's bones  and mayhap a  fresh body or two  that the birds  have not 
 gotten to  yet. The  strange thing  was that  it blew  at me  with the
 force of  the strongest  of winds  when I approached.  Then I  was set
 upon by  minions of hell  and the leader  wore this:" he  withdrew the
 crown  which reflected  the  light of  the candles  with  an eery  red 
 glow. "I had to  slay them to live but they  fought with the technique 
 of that found only in the king of Grandydyr's greatest ancient heros".
     The elf  looked at his companion  who was also confused.  "And you 
 say that the leader  bore this crown?" he looked at  the it. "We shall 
 give  word  of  this to  our  king  and  I  shall inform  you  of  his
 bidding."  He glanced  at his  companion, Quendell.  "We ride  for the
 port of  Dhernis tomorrow, and then  on to the Learis  Islands. In the
 meanwhile, make merry and enjoy the wine." He laughed and took a sip.
     Ceda finished  his wine  and left  the tavern.  He felt  good from
 the wine  and decided  that he  would walk around  for a  while before
 going back  to the  tavern to  rent a  room, so  he untied  his dragon 
 mount and with him, set off through the city. 
     While passing  through one of  the many  alleys of the  city, four
 large men approached  Ceda, who was, at this  time, quite intoxicated.
 The larger of the men coming foreword. 
     "Give us  your gold and  we won't kill  you," his voice  was cold. 
 He withdrew a large knife from his side and showed Ceda the blade.
     Ceda knew he  could do nothing in his drunken  state and turned to
 his dragon  mount who was  now ready  to attack. "Down,"  he whispered 
 into the dragons ear. "I have a much better way." 
     "Hurry or I'll kill you and find it myself," warned the man. 
     "Here it  is," Ceda replied pulling  out of his pouch  the largest
 of the strange looking skulls and dropping it to the ground.
     The  skull at  once grew  to it's  full size  and looked  at Ceda. 
 "Give me the crown!" It hissed.
     "They  have  it,"  Ceda  pointed  at  the  advancing  men  as  the
 skeleton turned to face them, its fiery eyes dimly lighting the alley.
     As  the demon  advanced on  its new  target, Ceda  led the  dragon 
 away and  resumed his  walk through  the city. "It  won't find  us now
 unless it  stops to ask  for directions,"  Ceda laughed. The  sound of 
 men screaming  came from  the passage  where he had  just been  and he
 chuckled again. 
     As Ceda  walked through the large  area in the center  of the city
 square,  he notice  a  small  bench carved  from  rock  put there  for 
 festivals  that  sometimes  took  place  in  the  city  on  the  kings 
 birthday or on  certain holidays. He decided to sit  there for a while 
 and relax for  he was tired and  the effects of the  wine were wearing 
 off. He  put his hands down  on his knees  and in turn, his  head down
 on his hands and gradually fell into a mild slumber. 
     "Greetings, Ceda," was  the voice that next roused  him. He looked 
 up at the  source to discover a  tall woman with long  blond hair tied 
 in the back. She wore common garb and had no weapon 
     "You know  me?" he looked up  questioningly at her, his  head hurt
 and his voice was weak.
     "I know of  you, I have wanted  to meet you for a  long time." She 
 sat with  him now and  he could smell the  perfume which she  wore. It
 smelled  good  and  he  took  a  long  breath.  "Mayhap  we  could  go
 someplace  more  private than  this.  She  looked  at him  and  smiled 
 displaying a number of black and green rotting teeth.
     "So be  it." He stood  up, the pain in  his head was  beginning to
 fade  now  as  they  made  their  way  back  to  the  tavern  and  got 
 themselves a room.
     They were  now in  the room  and she  looked at  him for  a moment 
 without  saying  anything,  then  she started  to  undress.  Ceda  now 
 understood what she had meant and also took off his clothes.
     They both  looked at  one another. She  had a  magnificently built
 body with  perfect legs and  large breasts.  She took the  binding off
 her hair and it rolled down to meet her shoulders. She was beautiful.
     Ceda moved  closer to her.  He could  feel her hot  breath against 
 his chest  and he grabbed  her and  set her gently  on the bed  on her
 back. His  hand now gently caressed  her large breasts and  she gave a
 soft moan  of approval. Then he  reached over and blew  out the candle
 at the side of the bed. 

     The next morning  the sun came in through the  cracks in the stone
 wall and  woke Ceda.  He looked around  but the woman  was not  in the
 room. He  got dressed  and went  down stairs to  the tavern  where the
 bar  keeper was  polishing  the  crystal cups  that  he  used for  the
 nobility of the city. 
     "Greetings, sir," he said with a jolly look on his face. 
     "Greetings  to you  to," Ceda  replied. "Have  you seen  the woman
 that I came in with last night?"
     "Can't say  that I  have, but if  I see her,  I'll let  you know."
 The bar keeper smiled.
     "Thanks," he said as he left the bar for his room.
     Ceda entered  his room  and gathered  his things  into a  pile. He
 opened his pouch  and noticed that the crown was  not there. He looked 
 on the cold stone  floor to make sure he had not lost  it and then got
 all his  things and  left the  inn. He walked  around The  city asking 
 people if they had  seen her and he cursed himself  for not asking her
 for here name.
     No one  in the  city seemed to  know where she  had gone,  but the 
 giants at the  city gate knew who  she was and they new  her name also
 (for a small bag of gold that Ceda had given them.) 
     The  giants said  that she  had left  for the  city of  Caahah and 
 that it  had only  been a few  hours before. They  also said  that the 
 needed to  hire swords, for  there was a demon  lose in the  city that 
 was killing  both man and beast  shouting about a crown  of some sort. 
 Ceda turned this job down. 
     He  raced back  to Melgon  who  stood ready  for him.  He put  his
 sword in  its place  on right of  the saddle of  the dragon  mount and 
 then rode  out of the city  away from it  and the desert in  search of 
 the woman called Viamea and the valuable crown she had stolen. 
     On  the side  of the  city  that did  not border  the desert,  the
 wilderness was  relaxing as Ceda  the Warrior  rode by. He  planned to
 catch Viamea before  she reached the city lest he  have to explain why
 he was  chasing her to  the city guards. He  was passing a  stream now
 and  slowed his  dragon mount  to refill  his skin  pouch with  water; 
 aside from this, his ride was uneventful. 
     The next day he  had reached the city and still he  saw no sign of
 the woman.  He decided to  go into  the city and  look for her  in any
 case, reasoning that she may have had a faster horse than he thought. 
     When he  got into  the city, he  went to a  tavern, rented  a room
 and waited for nightfall. 
     That night  Ceda went  through all  the taverns  until at  last he 
 saw her  sitting in a corner  talking with another man.  Ceda made his
 way through the people and grabbed her by the arm. 
     "Come,  demonwoman, I  want a  word with  you." His  voice drowned
 out  by  the  other people  in  the  bar  so  that only  she  and  her 
 companion could hear.
     "She's with me,"  the man across the table stood  up to face Ceda.
 He was tall but stood an inch under Ceda's height and not as bulky.
     "Not any  more," he pulled at  her harder this time  wrenching her 
 from her seat.
     "No!" she  yelled and a  few people turned  to stare. The  man now 
 reached for  his sword  and swung  at Ceda  grazing his  left forearm. 
 Ceda threw  her at  the floor and  grabbed at his  sword to  parry the
 next attack  by the  man. Then  he jabbed. The  sword slid  in between
 two of the  mans ribs and he  lumped to the floor. By  this time there
 was a  crowd in the  tavern watching and Ceda  wiped his sword  on the 
 mans garments  and replaced at his  side. Then he faced  the woman who
 now sat  crying against a  wall. He grabbed  her hair and  dragged her 
 outside and back to the room he had previously rented. 
     "Now,  where is  the crown  that you  took from  my pouch!  I want
 it." He  looked into  her face and  saw that she  was now  crying even
 more than before.
     "I  don't know  where it  is now,  I was  paid to  take it  by two 
 elves.  Please don't  kill me,  I didn't  know it  meant that  much to 
 you," she put her head into her hands and cried again.
     "Where are they  now?" he asked. She did not  answer so he grabbed 
 her hair  and pulled  it up until  he could see  her face.  "Where are
 they now?" he said again.
     "They rode  out of  the city  gate to the  North East  towards the
 Port of  Dhernis. Please don't kill  me." she replaced her  hands over
 her face. 
     Ceda  got up  and closed  the door  putting the  bar in  place. he 
 walked back  to the  woman and  took her  by the  hair. She  looked up
 into his eyes and he smiled at her. 
     "Are you sure?" His voice was now calm.
     "Yes." 
     "Good," he smiled.
     Two hours later, a tall  man dressed in  black opened the  door to
 his room  in one of  the more popular inns  and departed for  the port
 of Dhernis. In the room in several pieces lay the body of a woman.
