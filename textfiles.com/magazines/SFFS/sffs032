     Well, here  we are!  Sorry about  the delay  in getting  issue 3-2
 out, but  I had to  be sure the  Narret Chronicles continued,  and I'm
 sure you'll  be pleased with  this copy. We  start off with  the first
 part  of a  four part  fantasy story  by Roman  Olynyk which  I'm sure 
 will captivate you. The  next article is a short story  idea I came up 
 with which is  interesting, although the copy in this  issue is only a
 rough draft.  The idea is: What  if an alien came  to a post-holocaust
 Earth  and  tried  to  figure  out  what went  on,  and  came  to  the
 conclusion that automobiles  were the dominant life  form? Finally, we 
 close with  chapter four  of the Narret  Chronicles, which  is drawing
 towards  an enthralling  climax! I'm  sure you  will enjoy  this issue 
 and the ones that will follow. 
     In  news, the  seventh Thieve's  World book  has been  released by 
 Ace,  and  is  titled "the  Dead  of  Winter".  This  seems to  be  an 
 improvement over  the previous  books, and will  be reviewed  in issue
 3-3 of  FSFnet. If  you are looking  for it, note  that the  old cover
 art by Walter  Velez has been replaced by Gary  Roddell. There is also 
 a  new   Tekumel  novel   out  by  M.A.R.   Barker  and   DAW,  called 
 "Flamesong". An  earlier FSFnet  had Mr. Barker  as a  featured author
 and  reviewed the  first Tekumel  book,  "the Man  of Gold".  Finally,
 Houghton Mifflin and  Christopher Tolkien have combined  once again to
 bring  us  a new  work,  called  "the  Lays  of Beleriand".  The  book
 (available  only in  hardcover)  contains several  partial poems,  but 
 concentrates  on  the  two  major stories  of  the  Silmarillion,  the
 former being  the Tale  of Turin  Turambar, and  the latter  being, of
 course, Beren  and Luthien.  The two  are written as  "the Lay  of the 
 Children of Hurin" and "the Lay of Leithian".
     There has also  been renewed interest in a  BITNET Diplomacy game.
 The game, marketed  by the now defunct Avalon Hill  Game Company, is a
 classic board  wargame. Anyone interested  in getting a  game together 
 (using standard postal Diplomacy rules) please get in contact with me. 
     Well, enough is enough! Read on and enjoy!

                             THE ACQUISITION
                          Part One:  The Tavern
     Far to the  east, in a land  more cold than warm,  was nestled the
 small village  of Gorod. The village  was situated on the  plains, and 
 it was  surrounded by distant  mountains topped with dense  forests of
 hardwood  trees. The  people of  Gorod were  peasant folk.  Stocky and 
 fair-haired,  they  farmed the  rich  fields  and plied  their  simple 
 trades.  Seldom,  if ever,  did  anyone  chance  to venture  from  the 
 village. More seldom, still, did they ever return. 
     In the  middle of  Gorod stood  a tavern  of rough-hewn  wood. The
 tavern  was called  the  Antlers,  for that  was  what  hung over  the
 doorway.  The  antlers  were  sun-bleached,  bony  white  and  porous,
 marking their  age in  seasons. Fare  at the  Antlers was  meager. The
 only beverage  served was mead.  The mead  was stout, however,  and it
 was the  best in the  village. In the evening,  as the sun  went down,
 villagers would cease their  labors and stop by for a  brew and a meal
 before  subsequently dropping  off to  a restful  sleep. This  pastime 
 usually was  limited to  the younger  folk who  still had  energy left 
 after a day's work.
     Today,  however, was  different. The  tavern bustled  with farmers
 anxious to  hear the  latest reports.  A monstrous  sow, which  only a
 few remaining elders  remembered, had returned. The  return of Kathryn
 was news indeed!
     Kathryn was far  from being an ordinary sow. Some  believed her to 
 be a demon wrought  by the curse of Baba Yaga.  Others thought she was
 the reincarnation of  Baba Yaga, the evil sorceress who  had died more 
 than a  century ago. Still  recalled in  tales around the  hearth, the 
 tale of  Baba Yaga was now  considered as more of  a children's story.
 This  day,  even  men  of  stout heart  shivered  at  the  mention  of
 Kathryn.  From whence  Kathryn returned,  no one  knew. When  her foul 
 temper  suited her,  she  would leave  the dark  forest  and raze  the
 fields, burn  the summer crops with  her breath and ravage  all in her 
 path. The countryside was blighted.
     "Yeauh, I saw her!"  said the Miller. "She was big  as a bull, she 
 was. Her  mouth was full of  big awful teeth." The  Miller grimaced to
 illustrate the remark with his own jagged dental work.
     "Who's  going to  drive her away?"  asked the farmer who first saw
 her.
     "I  saw her  too," added  another farmer.  "She spit  out a  fiery 
 froth and set my rye ablaze. My crop is lost. What am I going to do?" 
     "Someone  should go  after her  and kill her,"  suggested  another 
 farmer.
     Nobody looked  the farmer in the  eye. Nobody even wanted  to hint
 that  he might  wish to  undertake such  a task,  for it  seemed true; 
 Baba Yaga had returned in some other form. 
     "Who's going  to drive  her away?" Asked  the same  worried farmer 
 as he wrung his hands.
     "Anyone who  is fool  enough to  follow her  back into  the forest 
 will never return," commented another.
     The door  to the tavern  opened and a wobbly-legged  figure wended
 its way around the oaken benches to find a seat near the kegs.
     "Yeauh, that's  a fact,"  sneered the Miller  as he  eyed Banewood 
 staggering through  the door.  "Maybe our  Shaman can  fix her  one of 
 his spells.  Kathryn'd get so dizzy  that she might burn  herself into
 a  hole!"  Everyone  laughed  at  the Miller's  remark  and  at  their 
 stumbling  Shaman, who  had  been  attempting to  induce  a vision  by
 smoking some  hebona. Banewood still reeled  and talked to the  air as 
 he  tried  to   pour  himself  a  draught.   Everyone  laughed  again,
 forgetting Kathryn for the moment. 
     The apprentice  Shaman sat with  his mead and weathered  the jeers
 brought  on by  the  Miller.  Banewood wondered  why  he  came to  the 
 Antlers  rather than  stay at  home to  sleep off  the effects  of the
 powerful  smoke that  he had  used for  divination. He  found a  quiet
 seat far  from the burly  Miller and sipped  from his flagon  of mead. 
 His  head  cleared slowly.  Banewood  recalled  his latest  trance,  a 
 flying  vision   through  the  forest   to  what  appeared  to   be  a
 dilapidated hovel.  From the darkened  door peered two crimson  eyes - 
 eyes that haunted Banewood for the remainder of his trance.
     Kathryn could hardly  be forgotten. She was black and  as large as 
 the largest  bull, just as the  Miller had described. From  her mouth,
 which  bristled with  large  and  irregular teeth,  she  could spew  a 
 cloud of caustic  vapor that ignited objects it came  in contact with. 
 The fact that  Kathryn's eyes were red brought on  the notion that she
 was really Baba Yaga. 
     When she had  lived, Baba Yaga was known for  her blazing red eyes 
 which defied  description. They shone of  their own light -  a bright, 
 bloody red  glow. Tales of  her sorcery  were numerous. She  was known
 to fly and to  take on animal forms. In any form  she took, she worked
 solely  for  evil.  Never  actually  seeking  mastery  over  men,  she
 controlled  them  only long  enough  to  bring  them  to ruin.  As  an 
 outcast throughout  her life,  Baba Yaga  came to  hate humans  or any
 reminder that life was good.
     To the inhabitants  of Gorod, Baba Yaga seemed to  live far beyond 
 her years.  As time  progressed, she made  fewer appearances,  but her 
 evil work continued  through lesser genii who were  under her mastery.
 Eventually  there came  rumors  of  her death.  Her  demise was  never 
 confirmed,  for no  one had  ever approached  her dwelling  within the 
 dark forest. Whenever  a marauding beast met its end,  it was with the
 anticipation that  it might have been  Baba Yaga in one  of her forms. 
 Deathly visages,  the skins of  wolves and  bears and a  large stuffed
 owl adorned  the tavern wall,  silent reminders that the  black forest 
 was never far away. 
     When the  wide doors  opened again, they  offered Sod  the plowman
 to the  gossiping crowd. Sod  was dressed in the  brown, earth-crusted
 clothes  of a  farmer.  He  was richly  tanned  and  had the  muscular
 heaviness as  befited his trade. Within  his brow, his eyes  were deep
 and clear. They  sparkled with a life  seen in few other  faces of the 
 village.  This time,  worry lines  corded across  the plowman's  brow.
 Sod  went to  Banewood  and  sat before  the  smiling  Shaman. In  his 
 hands, Sod carried  a burlap bundle, which he placed  carefully on the 
 table  before Banewood.  A crowd  gathered as  Banewood unwrapped  it.
 Silently and soberly, Banewood lifted the cloth and revealed a sword. 
     Before  the  wide eyes  of  the  gathered  crowd  lay a  sword  of
 unsurpassed  beauty. It  was about  two cubits  long, but  it had  the 
 grace and  balance of a finely  wrought instrument. The sword  had the 
 gloss and  weight of  a material  more like  porcelain than  metal; it
 rang clearly  when struck. Unadorned,  the hilt  was of a  hard, white
 material which shone immaculately. The edge was keen. 
     Sod looked  as amazed  and perplexed as  Banewood. The  strong but 
 unassuming plowman  gazed steadily  at the sword.  The two,  sword and
 person, appeared almost as if they were measuring one another.
     "The  sword looked  just like  this when  my plow  turned it  up."
 Said the plowman, breaking the silence which had accumulated.
     At once, theories were offered  as to  the possible  origin of the 
 sword.
     "It looks like it was made by magic," Said a farmer. 
     "It  was  probably made  by  Pollocks,"  snarled the  Miller,  who
 washed  his  remark with  a  gulp  of  mead.  The Miller,  who  seemed 
 spiteful  of everything,  resented  his life  and  occupation, and  he
 thought  that everyone  should share  his bitterness.  To the  Miller, 
 such crude remarks were an anodyne for the harsh realities of life. 
     "The  sword  is  crafted  as   if  it  is  beyond  age,"  Banewood 
 countered. He  shot a reproachful  look at  the Miller. "Yet  it looks
 as if  it might  have just been  forged." It could  have been  made by
 the Ludki, he thought silently to himself.
     The  Ludki were  a  legendary  race of  little  people fabled  for
 their   craftsmanship   with  metals.   They   were   reputed  to   be 
 peace-loving, Banewood  said "For those  who believe that  the present
 holds  the greatest  marvels,  I  say: Look  again  and consider  this 
 ancient treasure! There is some timeless magic within it." 
     The  Shaman felt  more  power emanating  from  the strange  weapon
 than he stated  openly. His knowledge of lore extended  far beyond the
 simple life of  Gorod, yet he was  at a loss to  determine the history 
 of  the sword.  It could  have been  crafted by  the Ludki  but... his 
 knowledge was incomplete.
     Banewood was a  loner. He was twice orphaned: once  by his parents 
 who perished  in a blaze,  and once by  the Shaman who'd  adopted him, 
 only to  die himself  several years  later. The  Shaman had  only just
 begun  the long  task  of  training his  apprentice.  When the  Shaman 
 died,  Banewood  was  left  with  only  his  master's  books  and  the
 roughest  of  outlines  to  follow   in  his  quest  for  the  greater
 knowledge. Because  Banewood continued on  the road to  knowledge with
 no  guide, a  task never  attempted before,  he would  often err.  The
 apprentice  would   sometimes  find  himself  wandering   alone  in  a 
 stuporous haze brought  on by smoking some of  the strange concoctions 
 left by  the Shaman. Once, the  Shaman lived, Banewood had  a guide to 
 help  him  through these  tortuous  visions  which  helped to  give  a 
 Shaman his  knowledge and  opened the  secret doors  of power  to him. 
 Now  alone, Banewood  faltered like  a man  blind. His  acquisition of 
 power was slow and unsure.
     Banewood noticed how  well the sword fit the hand  of the plowman.
 When  Sod hefted  it, the  sword moved  easily, as  if it  were pliant 
 with the wishes of its wielder. 
     When  the crowd  at  the Antlers  had all  viewed  the sword,  the
 conversation  turned  to  the  possible   use  of  the  sword  against
 Kathryn.  They talked  of what  damage such  a sword  could do  to its
 victim. Each offered  his opinion of a sufficiently  brave fellow, one
 other  than  himself.  A  challenge   to  one's  manhood  was  quickly 
 answered by bluster and puffery but not by a volunteer. 
     "Yeauh, maybe our Shaman could fix up one of his..."
     "Shut up!"  Came the unexpected  response from  the usually demure
 Banewood. 
     The  Miller sat  transfixed, his  hand  at his  throat, unable  to 
 utter a sound. There was silence. 
     "What did  you do to him!"  Yelled one of the  Miller's companions
 as he started to lunge for Banewood. 
     At  that instant,  the room  resounded with  a loud  bang and  the
 splintering  of  wood. One  of  the  large  oaken  tables lay  on  the 
 ground,  cloven in  two. The  lunging man  stopped in  his tracks  and 
 stared in disbelief.  Sod, still holding the sword,  blushed. His only 
 response to the crowd of farmers was a firm, "I'll do it."
     Comraderie  again  filled the  air.  Fresh  kegs were  tapped  and
 toasts were  offered to Sod.  Men normally  distant to Sod  hugged him
 to show  their admiration for him,  to bask in reflected  glory and to 
 wish the best of luck to the doomed fellow.
     "Yes, with  such a weapon, one  could take on Baba  Yaga herself!" 
 said a distant  relative to Sod who  wondered of his own  claim to the
 doomed man's land and oxen. 
     Sod left the  celebration early. He needed to sleep  and to ponder 
 the  consequences  of his  decision.  "What  had happened?"  he  asked
 himself. He  had been  fondling the  hilt of the  sword when  the near
 fight had  broken out.  He had  been weighing a  decision to  seek the
 monstrous  sow and  had made  his resolution  as the  Miller made  his 
 last remark. Sod  had only thought of stopping the  incipient brawl by
 slapping  his weapon  down on  the table.  It was  a common  method of 
 gaining attention. Now he found himself alone on a vain quest.
     Sod  the plowman  lived  alone in  his hut  of  modest means.  The
 modesty was of  twofold nature: Sod spent his long  days in the fields
 and his  nights resting  from the day's  labors, and  Sod's livelihood 
 as a  plowman brought him only  a meager subsistence. Sod  enjoyed his 
 occupation,  for he  knew  he must  make the  best  of his  situation; 
 chances  were that  it would  be for  life. The  physical exertion  of
 guiding a  plow did not  demand a similar mental  exertion. Therefore, 
 Sod spent  his working time dreaming  of other lives and  other worlds
 - noble  dreams in  the mind  of a  simple man.  In Sod's  fantasy, he
 would roam  the kingdom as  a knight  errant, working deeds  for glory 
 and profit,  for surely  people paid well  for such  special services. 
 These were  mere dreams, however,  and Sod realized that  he possessed
 neither the ability nor the courage to live the life of a hero.
     And now  what was he  to do? He was  commited to a  suicidal quest 
 on  the basis  of momentary  courage. What  could he  say? He  found a 
 strange  and  unique  weapon  and  that weapon  offered  itself  as  a
 chance, a  fleeting opportunity that  must be  seized and used  at the 
 instant  it was  offered. Sod  was unaccustomed  to making  such hasty
 decisions,   but   equally,   he   was   unaccustomed   to   receiving
 opportunities. Sod the  plowman dropped off to  sleep, still clutching 
 his new sword.
     In  the early  morning  Sod  awoke to  the  usual  sound of  birds
 chirping  outside  his dwelling.  He  had  already packed  the  meager 
 belongings  he wished  to take  on his  journey. Crafting  a makeshift
 strap, Sod girded  the newfound sword to his side  and stepped outside
 to begin his journey. He almost stumbled across a reclining figure.
     "Banewood! What are you doing here?"
     "Waiting  for  you. I'm  going  with  you,"  Banewood said  as  he 
 limberly  rose without  the aid  of his  hands. A  satchel lay  at his 
 side  and a  quiver  full of  arrows  hung across  his  back. The  old 
 Shaman's longbow was gripped by Banewood's left hand. 
     "Don't you  realize that  this is  going to  be a  dangerous trip? 
 Few venture into the forest to return again." 
     "Yes,  I realize  the  consequences.  I have  a  knowledge of  the
 trees, and  besides, two can  travel safer than one."  Banewood didn't
 mention that he'd already decided to attempt the quest himself.
     Sod slapped his  new comrade on the back and  silently thanked his 
 luck  that he  would  have  a companion  on  such  a fateful  journey. 
 Together, they  marched down the dusty  path that led away  from Gorod
 and across  the fields.  On their  walk they  passed by  stooped women 
 already gathering  herbs from  their gardens. A  few men  were working 
 in the  fields. The men stopped  momentarily to wave to  the departing 
 travelers. The night's comraderie was worn and forgotten.
     If  they had  talked  about  this journey  and  their reasons  for 
 going, Banewood  and Sod  would each  have realized  their similarity.
 Banewood's  quest  for  knowledge  was  proceeding  slowly,  much  too
 slowly.  Still, Banewood  felt that  he  knew as  much as  any man  in
 Gorod  about the  ways of  their world.  Banewood knew  that something 
 had to  be done about  Kathryn. If Gorod didn't  offer a means  to the 
 solution,  then maybe  the answer  lay  elsewhere. Sod,  on the  other 
 hand, was not  on a quest for  any knowledge - he  was instead trapped 
 in the  occupation of the plowman.  His work had dignity,  though, and 
 Sod felt  good about it. The  sword changed Sod's outlook,  though. He 
 felt  that fate  was  offering him  some sort  of  opportunity -  that
 given  the   means  to  accomplish   something,  he  must   seize  the 
 opportunity and  act upon it.  Somehow, it  seemed that the  sword was 
 capable  of slaying  Kathryn,  and  all it  took  was  the resolve  to
 accomplish it.

                            2100 AND COUNTING 
     The Ivory  is in orbit  around a  planet named Foren-4.  Once this 
 planet was  home to an indigenous  sentient species, but they  are now
 extinct.  Had the  invention  of FTL  drive come  a  mere few  decades
 earlier, I  would be  supervising the  first contact  between sentient
 life forms.  Maybe we  could have helped  them avoid  their extinction 
 somehow.  But now  I am  in charge  of a  group of  archaeologists and
 anthropologists,  sifting through  the  dust that  has gathered  about 
 the bones of this once-great civilization.
     Physically,  the  natives  of  this   planet  seem  to  have  been
 mechanical in  nature. They  were quadrupedal,  and made  primarily of 
 rare  metals, which  would  indicate  a synthetic  nature.  It is  too 
 early to  venture a hypothesis as  to the origin of  this species, but 
 I  would guess  that they  were created  by an  elder race  as robotic
 servants  who,  for some  reason,  outlived  their creators.  From  my 
 several  expeditions   to  the  surface,   I  have  come   to  several
 preliminary  conclusions  which  shall  be discussed  in the following
 report.
     At a  site the team  visited in a place  called "Detroyt-Michigan"
 we  found  evidence supporting  the  hypothesis  that the  robots  are 
 constructed  by  other nonsentient  species  of  robots. There  is  no 
 evidence of  an organized religion,  and there are several  reports of 
 large communal graves, called, in the vernacular, "junkyards".
     There  is   very  little  evidence   of  a  political   system  or 
 hierarchy, though evidence  points to a system  of self-government and
 equality. Whether this  leans towards anarchy or  democracy is unknown
 at  this point,  although  further  research is  at this moment  being
 conducted.
     There is, however,  a vast number of  observable social phenomena.
 The entire  globe is  crisscrossed with  broad avenues  for travelling 
 with laws  to govern them. I  found an example of  the organization of
 these  ways at  a junction  of two  streets, where  there were  lights 
 which  flashed "DON'T  WALK"  when  it was  unlawful  or dangerous  to 
 continue, and  "WALK" when  it was  safe. This  observation led  me to
 the conclusion that  there was a global organization of  the race. The
 roads often pass  by majestic views and  natural phenomena, indicating 
 that there  was a  distinct respect for  the natural  environment from 
 which the race developed. 
     At one  site I came  across a  large area where  individuals could
 gather for  social interaction and entertainment.  These areas, called
 "Drive-Ins"  have  been found  in  several  locations on  Foren-4.  At 
 other sites have  been discovered large tracks where  the robots could 
 run  around  and keep  themselves  healthy.  The names  "Daytona"  and
 "Indy"  have  been  preserved  as   names  of  favorite  tracks.  This 
 indicates that  the robots  were concerned  with their  well-being and 
 perhaps enjoyed sports.
     It seems that  the race had also developed a  sense of beauty, for 
 at  several  sites   have  been  found  structures   where  what  were 
 considered  the  most physically  attractive  members  of the  species 
 were  displayed behind  large  glass windows.  These "showrooms"  were
 often placed  close to  the walkways, so  that individuals  could walk
 by and admire the beauty of the species. 
     Very  little  has  been  determined  about  the  language  of  the
 natives, though  two important  facts have been  interpreted. Firstly,
 the language was  written, as the walkways that cross  the globe often 
 were decorated with  large signs bearing messages that we  have yet to
 interpret. Also  interesting is that  the robots communicated  in very 
 high frequencies, in the range of radio waves.
     Unfortunately,  very little  has  been  determined concerning  the 
 family structure  of the natives, though  there is a little  to go on.
 At  most  sites,  the  individuals lived  in  small  buildings  called
 "garages"  in  nuclear  family  groups of  usually no  more than three 
 individuals.
     At  this point,  I feel  that the  civilization at  Soren deserves
 much  more study,  as we  have,  in this  mission, only  been able  to 
 grasp  the most  obvious facts  about  the race  which once  inhabited 
 this planet.  I would hope that  this expedition will be  extended for 
 an indefinite period to gather more accurate and in-depth information.

                            NARRET CHRONICLES 
                             Book the Fourth 
     Samo landed  Narret-1 as they  requested, in hanger-81,  which was
 not  surprisingly full  of anxiously  awaiting scientists,  and waited
 for further instructions.
     The   scientists,  mainly   aerospace   engineers,   with  a   few 
 astronomers  thrown in  for good  measure, gathered  around the  ship, 
 some of  them speculating how  the ship was propelled,  others eagerly 
 awaiting an explanation  from Samo. close!! Well, I  guess I shouldn't
 expect  much from  them,  being  as belligerent  as  they are.  Still,
 you'd  think  they would  have  at  least  begun  to think  in  binary
 instead  of  that awkward  decimal  system  of  theirs. I'll  have  to
 suggest it to them before I leave." thought Samo.
     Time  to  make  an  entrance,  Samo  thought  as  he  changed  the
 polarity  setting  on  his  daser-dewelder.  Using  this  as  a  laser
 cutting torch,  he opened the door  to the craft. A  flood of dazzling 
 brightness the  likes of which  no one had  ever seen rushed  into the 
 hanger, momentarily blinding everyone in the room. 
     "I'm sorry  about that."  Samo said  as he  stepped down  from the 
 spherical craft, "It's  one of the affects  of trans-universal travel,
 when    a   body    full   of    darktron   radiation    undergoes   a 
 matter-anti-matter  reaction, then  that radiation  gets converted  to 
 light,  provided it  isn't  turned  to pure  energy  and is  vaporized
 during the light-warp of course."
     "It's effect  should last  only a  few minutes,  but you  those of 
 you looking  at the  door as  I opened it  may be  seeing spots  for a
 short  while. It  is generally  considered about  the same  as looking
 directly at your sun for a moment with the unaided eye." 
     "In the meantime,  I'm sure you must have some  questions. I shall 
 entertain  a few  of  them  now if  you  like.  However any  questions
 pertaining  to why  I am  here  must and  shall be  floored before  an 
 international forum."
     "I'm  sorry gentlemen,  but Dr.  Ht wont  be able  to answer  your 
 questions just  yet," interrupted  Colonel Roberts  as he  entered the
 hangar. "He  has to  go through  the post-flight  debriefing procedure
 that is  undergone by all  intercepted aircraft, being an  alien makes 
 no exception."
     What am I  saying? Of course it makes an  exception, he thought to
 himself. This is crazy!!
     "Dr. Ht  will be available to  answer all your questions  after he 
 answers  the  Air  Force's  questions, and  he  addresses  the  United 
 Nations.  Arrangements are  being made  at  this hour  for a  special, 
 secret meeting  of the  United Nations, in  response to  your request. 
 Now Dr Ht. if you'll come with us we'll go to the debriefing room."
     "I'm  sure  you realize  how  very  irregular this  situation  is, 
 we're doing  the best we can  to have this meeting  organized, but not
 all of the countries are as eager to respond as you may have thought."
     "Oh, don't  worry about the others,  I have the feeling  they will 
 be coming," said Samo.
     "We have several  questions for you and,  given the circumstances,
 I hope  you can see why  we feel we  need to ask them.  This shouldn't 
 take very long, please bear with us," said Colonel Roberts.
     "First of  all," began Captain  Phillips, "Will you state  for the 
 record once again where it is you come from and why you're here?"
     "I  come  from the  Planet  Sunaru  in  the  Narret System,  by  a
 technology much  more advanced than your  own. The Narret System  is a 
 stellar   counter-part  to   your   own  solar   system,  within   the
 counter-universe.  My  home  planet  is the  Planet  Amrif  Arret.  It
 corresponds  directly to  this planet,  Earth.  I am  here because  we 
 believe you  humans have pushed  the threat  of global nuclear  war to
 the  brink  of  a  disaster of  cosmological  proportions.  What  your
 people have  failed to realize is  that there is an  entirely contrary 
 universe out  there, ours, which is  the exact complement to  your own 
 universe.  And,  quite  simply,  those  things  which  you  choose  to 
 destroy   here    will   also   cause   their    complement   in   the 
 counter-universe  to be  destroyed. My  people will  not sit  back and 
 watch  our complement  world destroy  us, our  peace, our  prosperity,
 all that which we  value highly. Thus it was decided  that I should be 
 sent to  give a warning  to the human race,  and do whatever  I deemed
 necessary to preserve peace here." 
     "Secondly, what is it you want from the United States, officially?" 
     "On  my journey  here, which  takes light  some 16  of your  years 
 within  this universe  alone  (for  us it  is  faster)  I studied  the 
 history  of your  world  and found  no concepts  of  virtue and  moral 
 wealth  greater   than  those   noble  statements  recorded   in  your
 Declaration  of  Independance,  and  your  Constitution.  I  therefore 
 sought  to  begin  seeking  peace  amongst those  who  value  it  most
 greatly. It  was simply logical,  I assure  you. I thought,  and still 
 think your  people will be most  receptive to me, and  to my necessary 
 appeal for peace." 
     "Very well,  you've made  your intent  very clear  Dr. Ht.  We are
 prepared  to  let  you  have   the  forum  you  requested,  this  very 
 afternoon. Until then  though our scientists would like to  give you a
 complete  physical  to  determine  if you're  undergoing  any  serious 
 side-effects from--"
     "At the  risk of sounding a  bit facetious, I hardly  think any of
 your physicians could  be called competent in  examining me. Primarily
 since  they don't  know  what my  'norm' is.  Honestly,  how can  they 
 expect to  determine whether or  not I'm undergoing  any side-effects? 
 Obviously then, what  they really want is to stick  me full of needles 
 and  try  to  make  some  heads  or tails  out  of  my  AND  molecular 
 structure. So,  why didn't  you just  ask that in  the first  place? I
 can provide  them with all the  necessary data from my  ship's bio-log 
 computer, and  a small blood  sample to verify  the truth of  my data. 
 Isn't that what they really want?"
     "Yes, I  would imagine that  would suffice. Any knowledge  you can
 give us about your people would be of great use and be much appreciated."
     "Good, then no  needles will be necessary. If there's  one thing I 
 can't  stand its  a bunch  of curious  physicians sticking  needles in 
 every appendage of my body. I hate needles..."
