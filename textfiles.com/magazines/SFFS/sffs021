                                   Editorial
    Greetings,  all!   Well,   first let me apologize for the  lateness of this
 issue, but things have been going on mighty fast.  Two-two will be out sooner,
 I promise!
    Well,  this  summer has a wonderful  lineup of fantasy and  science fiction 
 films,  and I heartily suggest that you  keep your eyes open for them.   Also, 
 Terry Brooks' new Shannara  book is out,  as is a new book  by Larry Niven and
 Jerry Pournelle about an alein invasion of Earth,  called "Footfall".   FSFnet 
 is in need  of some submissions (as always),   and this is the  first issue of
 volume two,  which will  last through the summer,  and then  volume three will 
 begin in the fall.   Now that summer is here, most people have gone home,  and
 FSFnet needs both  contributors and members!   Be sure and  recruit people who 
 are into fantasy and SF for the zine, so we can continue to send it out.   And
 if anyone has any neeto ideas about a  special issue,  by all means,  speak to
 me!
    For those of you  at VAX/VMS and MVS nodes,  FSFnet is being  sent out in a 
 new manner which can send the file by CMS DISK DUMP or SENDFILE.  I have taken
 the liberty of using sendfile for those  nodes for which DISK DUMP is awkward;
 however, if you have trouble reading FSFnet in, just drop me a line,  and I'll
 work on it.  Aiming to please, you know... 
    Well,  have a great summer,  all!   And send in those reviews and so forth, 
 and spread the word!  Now on to the REAL stuff...

                             The Narret Chronicles
                                 Book the Sixth 
    Samo flew over the nighttime skies of North America, his mind reeling. "The 
 largest urban centers will have the   highest photon emissions."  Samo said to
 himself.  "Shock waves travel through this mainly nitrogen medium at lets see, 
 exactly,  yes,  that should do it.  Now all I've got to do is fly over a large
 metropolitan area such as that one on the east coast,  veer upward at an angle 
 of,  yes and return from over the  ocean at half that velocity.  There.   That
 should do quite nicely," Samo continued as he set the controls on a course for
 New York City. 
    Samo broke the sound barrier as he flew over Kennedy International Airport,
 sending a sonic boom crashing through the city. 
    "Did you see what I think I saw, Albright?"
    "I was just going to ask you  the same question.   I've never seen anything 
 like that radar pattern in my twenty-three years in this tower!"
    "It looked rather like a ball,  or a  bubble.   Say,  do you think it could 
 have been a weather balloon?" 
    "No way.  I've seen balloons before, and they're much smaller, besides that
 thing,  whatever it was,   had to be doing at least Mach  3,  and SR-71's only 
 reach Mach 2.2 at top cruising speeds! I'm calling Dover Control."
    "Hello,  Operator?   Please connect me with  Dover Air Force Base's Control
 Tower, 301-716-2000, Person-to-person with Maj. Jeffries"
    "Maj. Jeffries, here." 
    "Hi Bill,  it's Jim  Albright at JFK.  Listen,  we just got  a bogie on two
 screens,  simultaneously that had a pattern  similar to a weather balloon only 
 larger and it was doing about Mach 4.   Are you boys testing a new toy,  or is 
 this thing a possible threat?" 
    "Well Jim,  I'll level with you.   We've been monitoring it on the national
 scopes, and we don't know what it is either.  It came out of nowhere, suddenly 
 appeared over Chicago 15 minutes ago, Made a beeline for New York,  headed out 
 over the Atlantic,  and now it's starting back for the midwest.   As to Soviet 
 threats,  we've received no messages  by diplomatic courier,  and intelligence
 has made  no reports  about any  new aircraft.  The  71's we  keep on  24 hour 
 standby are being fueled,  and we've got two of our best pilots suiting up for
 an intercept."
    "I hate to think  of the possibilities if it is Soviet.    A bird like that 
 could bomb any  American city and escape completely unscathed  before we could 
 even fire an anti-aircraft missile."
    "We know, and the President is being notified.   Say Jim I'll need to ask a 
 favor of you." 
    "Anything--name it." 
    "Make sure this stays under wraps  for now.   Inform your staff--anyone who
 saw that thing, not to talk about it,  the last thing this country needs right
 now is a panic created by the press."
    "Sure, you got it, we didn't see anything."
    "Great,   thanks.   I've  got  to  go now,   but  I'll  let you  know  what
 develops..." 

    "...Ah,  NORAD,  Seeker-1 here,  this  is Colonel Roberts,  neither Captain
 Phillips nor I have seen the bogie.  What is it's present position?  Over."
    "Seeker-1,  NORAD here,  bogie heading 270 at 25,000 ft.  slowed to Mach 2. 
 Fly on heading  285 at 25,000 full-open to intercept in 2.45 minutes. Over." 
    "NORAD, Seeker-1, proceeding 285 at Mach 2.2 .  Roberts out ." 
    "What do you think we'll find sir?" Phillips asked. 
    "Your guess is as good as mine captain.   But since you asked my opinion, I
 think that ever since the top brass closed the Bluebook Project a lot of weird 
 things have happened." 
    "What kind of things sir?"
    "Well it just seems to  me that since the books have  been closed on extra- 
 terrestrial visitation  research the number  of bogie sightings  hasn't really
 dropped.  Now if most of the reported cases were hoaxes as the project's final
 report states,  then why do people continue  to report sightings with the same
 continuity  as  before.    Even  when  they  don't  have  the  chance  of  our
 investigating their story to back them up.  I don't know captain, I just don't 
 know." 
    "You're right sir that doesn't make sense.  Now this...could the soviets-"
    "I know what you're thinking and the answer is doubtful. They couldn't even
 get to the test level without our intelligence finding out.   Besides,  at the 
 briefing we  were told  the craft  created a  sonic boom  at Mach  3  and  the 
 russians don't have the metallurgical technology  to create an alloy malleable 
 enough and heat resistant  enough to prevent heat fatigue of  the metal due to
 air friction. " 
    "In other words your saying this bogie really could be extra-"
    "I'm  saying  no  such  thing,  Captain.    I'm  merely  pointing  out  the
 possibility that there is more out there than we are capable of understanding.
 and that's  all.   I  make no allusions  as to  what those  possibilities are.
 Listen Dave,  I've given more than half my  life to this Air Force,  and there
 are a  few things  I've learned.    One of  them is  that if  you come  across
 something you  can't explain,  and you're  enjoying your career you  don't ask
 questions.    Most  likely  there's  someone who  doesn't  want  you  to  know
 something,  and if  you don't get curious,   you'll be fine.   I've  lost more 
 pilots for "Disturbances of an emotional nature," than anything else.   Is any
 of this registering, captain?
    "Uh, yes sir, sort of."
    "'Uh, yes sir sort of.' What kind of cocka-maime answer is that son?   Give 
 me a big 'Yes Sir!' or 'No Sir!'" 
    "Sir would  you please look  out your  starboard window.   It's  the bogie, 
 three o'clock low!"

                      Featured Author: ROBERT ANTON WILSON 
    Robert Anton Wilson  is a very interesting author.   His  works deal almost
 entirely with  the Illuminati and  other mystic  horrors of the  modern world.
 Wilson's life  has been  filled with strange  probings into  all forms  of the
 occult,  and he was  a close friend with the late  Professor Timothy Leary,  a 
 well-known occultist.
    Wilson's works began with the "Illuminatus!" series,  originally written by 
 Wilson and Robert Shea as a parody  of modern mysticism,  the Illuminati,  and
 the U.S.   government.   "The Eye in  the Pyramid",  "The Golden  Apple",  and 
 "Leviathan" were originally meant to be  farcical,  written in a style similar
 to  that  infamous style  of  James  Joyce.    The "Illuminatus!"  series  was 
 reprinted recently by Dell.  The better-known "Schrodinger's Cat" trilogy (the 
 two other volumes being  titled "The Trick Top Hat" and  "The Homing Pigeons") 
 is a master  work of confusion and  fear,  and is perhaps  Wilson's best work.
 "The  Masks of  the  Illuminati"  is a  single  volume  work,  describing  the 
 encounters one Sir John Babcock has with Albert Einstein and James Joyce,  and
 the trick  Aleister Crowley  plays upon  them all.    "The Cosmic  Trigger" is 
 Wilson's attempt  to explain the  events of his  life that have  convinced him 
 that there is something other than that which we know, and is very interesting 
 and persuasive.    All the  previous are available  from Pocket  Books.   Also 
 available in hardcover only is "And the Earth Will Shake", a full-length novel 
 by Wilson.
    Wilson's unique  style cannot be adequately  put into words.    His writing 
 often  tries  to shock  the  reader,   sometimes becomes  philosophical,   and 
 sometimes  becomes  disjointed,   but  his tales  of  the  Illuminati  are  so 
 absolutely bizarre, and yet,  somehow,  plausible,  that his books often leave
 the modern reader horrified.  Lovecraft and Chambers wrote of books that would
 drive one insane to  read.   Wilson has created the horror  that these authors 
 have written  about.   I once lent  a copy of  "Masks of the Illuminati"  to a 
 friend.   She reported to me that when she finished it one evening, she pulled 
 the  sheets over  her  head and  hoped  she'd  wake up  sane  in the  morning. 
 Wilson's writing is truly unique.

                                   The Thrust
    The forest stretched out as far as the eye could see,  tall green pines and 
 spruce trees. But here there were no trees, only charred stumps.  A long wound
 had been made by the ship as it crashed.  Now it lay,  buried in dirt,  inert.
 Yet it was not a wreck.  A repair ship stood beside it.  The repair robots had 
 done a  good job.  The ship  now had wings  to replace those destroyed  in the
 brief but violent  landing.  Those new wings flexed as  repulsor fields lifted 
 the ship into the air.
     "Take care. Remember, wait until you get to op temperature before going to
 full thrust. I'll take care of those bogeys." 
     "Roger,  Gabriel.  Have  fun." The ship's main engine came  to life gently
 pushing the ship up into the afternoon sky. 
     One hundred  miles away  two interceptors  rammed through  the atmosphere.
 The pilots watched in anger as the  first ship slid across their radar scopes. 
 Then the repair  ship rose up to  replace it,  and the  pilots gleefully armed
 their nuclear missiles when they saw that it was hovering. 
     Greg, alias Gabriel,  watched his own detector scope in quiet joy.  On one 
 side of the scope the blip representing the survey ship built up velocity.  On 
 the other side the interceptors closed rapidly.  The survey ship was not going
 to  be able  to outrun  the attacking  craft  before they  could launch  their
 missiles.  Greg didn't worry  for the survey ship,  though.  He  touched a few
 controls,  and  the repair ship  started to slide through  the air at  a right
 angle to the path of the other ships. 
     The pilots of the interceptors considered. If they continued their pursuit
 of the far craft,  they might still catch  it.  On the other hand,  the closer 
 craft was almost in range. They decided to take the closer, more sure victory.
     At a  distance of  twelve miles,  the  interceptors fired  their missiles. 
 They banked hard,  and  put as much distance as they  could between themselves
 and the target as  they could.  In the repair ship,  Greg  smiled as the scope 
 reported that the survey ship had reached operational temperature and had gone
 to full  thrust.  With it safely  out of the  way,  Greg could now  leave.  He
 reached out and touched a button, just as the missiles fired their warheads. 
     Twenty miles away,  the interceptor pilots' stomaches clenched in thrilled
 excitement as  they watched the blast  through their flash goggles.   Had they
 been one hundred miles further away,  they might have seen something even more 
 spectacular. In the instant before the nuclear explosion,  a seemingly pencil-
 thin line of violet flame drew itself five hundred miles straight up.  It then 
 curved, as Greg punched in the command to go home.

                           Game Review: TWILIGHT:2000 
    "Division commander to all units:  Good Luck, You're on your own."  So ends
 the  player's introduction  to  "Escape form  Kalisz",   the starter  scenario 
 included in GDW's new Role-playing Game, Twilight:2000. 
    Twilight:2000 is set  in Europe in the  year 2000,  after a  five year long
 world war.   World-wide casualties are over 50%, and rising.   The governments
 of most major countries (the US included)  have been eliminated or fragmented.
 Wide-spread  convertional  warfare  and  liberal  use  of  both  tactical  and 
 strategic nuclear weapons  has destroyed most communication  and trade routes. 
 The Black Death (Bubonic Plague)  has run rampant,  and lingers in some areas.
 Most major cities are radioactive ruins.   The players are (or were)  soldiers
 in the US Army, part of the last NATO drive into Poland.
    The primary objective of a Twilight:2000 player is to stay alive.   If that
 gets boring, he can also try to strike a blow for freedom, democracy,  and the 
 Joint Chiefs of Staff (the de facto government of the United States).
    Twilight:2000 consists of 2 rulebooks, one for the players, which describes
 how to generate a character and conduct simple combat. The Play Manual (as GDW
 calls it)   has plenty of illustrations  and examples.   The  Referee's Manual 
 covers many of the same topics as the  Play Manual,  but in greater depth.  It 
 also includes sections on experience,   disease,  and the campaign background.
 With the manuals are a set of tables, again divided into separate player's and 
 referee's charts.  In the way of campaign support, GDW has included a detailed 
 price list and equipment descriptions separately from the rulebooks.  There is
 an introductory adventure, "Escape form Kalisz", to start the campaign,  and a
 map of Poland. 
    Twilight:2000's strong points include:  Randomly rolled attributes, but the 
 player can  select a  character's skills.    Character generation,   while not 
 extremely fast, is straightforward.  The combat system is detailed, and covers
 all of the weapons in the game well. 
    On the other hand,   Twilight:2000 is plagued by typos.   Most  of them are
 easy to figure out  (like switching from B for Back in the  chartbook to R for
 Rear in  the manual)  but  can be confusing  when they are  first encountered. 
 Compounding this  is the extensive use  of abbreviations (all skill  names are 
 abbreviated to 3 letters), again easy to figure out,  but confusing untill you
 are used to the system.
    The only serious problem with the design  is the heavy use of charts.   The 
 referee really needs a copy of the Player's Manual, the Referee's Manual,  and
 the Referee's Charts open in front of him at all times.   The combat system is
 completely  table-driven,  which  means  that in  combat  the  referee has  to 
 organize his time, or forever flip through the chartbook. 
    All in  all,  Twilight:2000 may  be the best new  RPG released in  the last
 year,  my  complaints above notwithstanding.  (I  have many more  gripes about
 every other RPG I can think of)  Twilight:2000 is complete all by itself,  and 
 well worth the $17 price tag.

                              Island 
          An island unto myself.  Where I can sit and watch. 
          I can look around and see all the beautiful things. 
          The simple and the complex, the large and 
          The small, the conspicuous and the not-so-conspicuous. 
          I am in awe of it all, of them. 
          And they, of me.  For I am here to care for
          And protect them, to keep the balance. 
          I am here to prevent what happened the last 
          Time this project was attempted.  Responsibility to
          One's position was not my predecessor's strong suit. 
          It is so beautiful here.  How could he have left 
          His garden unattended for so long?  It was so
          Unmanageable by the time he got back to it that it 
          Had to be razed and left barren for a mere eternity.
          Well, it is beautiful now.  And my task is to keep 
          It this way, maintain the balance.  Not necessarily
          An easy task, but an enjoyable one.  Yes..., maintaining 
          The beauty while balancing the evolution will not be 
          Easy, but it will have its rewards.  My garden will become 
          Something infinitely more special than it is already. 
          The sun is setting now for the sixth time.  I shall rest tomorrow.

                                  X-Editorial 
    Well,  greetings,  all!    Another issue of FSFnet has come,   and I'm sure 
 you'll find  this one  rather refreshing.    Due to  circumstances beyond  our 
 control,  there is  neither a featured author  or a Narret Chronicles  in this
 issue, although both will continue in issue 2-3, with Narret 5 and a column on
 Christopher Stasheff,   author of  'The Warlock  in Spite  of Himself',   'The
 Warlock Unlocked', 'King Kobald Revived', and 'Escape Velocity'. 
    But  this issue  contains some  excellent  works of  fiction,  including  a 
 wonderful poem  by Jim Owens  (a poem I sympathize  with),  and my  own newest 
 imaginings  in 'Selection'.    If anyone  who  receives this  is still  having
 problems with  the sending  format,  please let  me know.    I'd also  like to 
 welcome those few  people who have been  added to the mailing  list since May, 
 and hope that they will continue to spread the word to interested parties.
    Well, enough of the propaganda... on with the show!

                               Man's Best Friends 
    "You know John,  the Telrani are man's  best friends.  And there is nothing 
 you can say that will change my view of them."
    John  Stevenson picked  up his  beer and  resumed drinking  it.  He  stared
 blankly at the ring of moisture it left on the bar.
    "I know that they have given us some good things...", he started. 
    "Some good things?!?   What about the  De-armatron?  That's more than good,
 John.  That's the end of war.  Flick the mother on and Zap!  No weapons,  even 
 nukes, work! And what about Super-Wheat?  The solution for world hunger. Grows 
 anywhere. And the cures for all the diseases man has ever known.  I just don't 
 understand you, John." 
    "I know what they've done, Dan. I just have a bad feeling about them.  It's 
 just too good.   One day a hundred flying  saucers come out of  the sky,  some 
 aliens get out that  look like Bigfoot,  they say they are  from Rigel and are 
 here to help us, and Wham! all the world's problems are solved.  I just have a 
 funny feeling about it."
    Dan took a pull at his drink, set it down and continued.
    "And now they are  offering trips to their home planet.   What a deal!"  So
 what if when we get back everyone who knows will be dead or at least a hundred 
 years old, we're not married, so what do we care?" 
    "Yea, but..."
    "No buts about it.  I'm going.  In fact I'm going in just a month.  And get 
 this, so are you!" 
    John,  who was drinking,  suddenly sputtered and splashed beer all over the
 bar.
    "What?!?",he yelled,"How come you didn't ask me?  How can we pay for it?  I
 don't want to leave Earth forever!"
    "It isn't forever, only for 8 months, our time. It's free, and I didn't ask
 you because I know you'd say no. Anyway we're going, so it's settled."
    "No it isn't, but I have to go home, so we'll talk about it tomorrow." 
    "See ya, John."
    "Later."

    "Hi Dan! Whatcha lookin so pale for? Are you sick?  Hey bartender, get this
 man a drink!" 
    "Dan, last night I decided that I might as well go to Rigel with you.  Hey, 
 I  mean my  'funny  feeling'  is unfounded,   and  there's  no reason  why  we
 shouldn't. Right, Dan?"
    Dan sat down, and stared straight ahead. 
    "John,  you know  how I taught myself the Telranian  language and alphabet,
 even though it's forbidden. Well I finally got a chance to use it.   I found a
 Telrani handbook yesterday for sale at a bookstore, and I bought it." 
    "But possesion of any Telrani text is illegal!"
    "I know that, but I bought it anyway, just to see if I could read it.   And
 I could." 
    "Well, what was the book about?"
    "The title was 'How to Serve Man', which they have been doing, right?   The
 De-armatron, Super-wheat, free interstellar trips, stuff like that." 
    "Yea, so what's wrong?" 
    "Well,  I read the first chapter,  and I thought I must have read it wrong,
 so I read it again, and I found out I didn't."
    "And?"
    "It isn't a  handbook on how to  help us,  Dear  God John,  it was  a cook-
 book!!"

                         All's Well That Ends. Well,...
    The hall was  dark,  but the thief  carried a torch,  and  could see rather 
 well.  He needed to see,  but  he also knew where to look,  and so his job was 
 made a little easier. 
    He moved his hand across the wall.  It  slid quietly,  and then fell into a 
 recess.  He edged his hand up and down what appeared to be a slot cut from the
 floor to the ceiling.  Near the bottom he found it; a break in the slot, where 
 the wall seemed uncut.  He held the torch  low.   On the wall beside the break 
 there was what seemed to be a rectangular metal inlay.  The thief knew better.
 He set the torch into a wall bracket, and licked the palm of his hand well. He 
 then placed his hand, palm first,  against the metal.  He then pulled his hand
 away suddenly.  The inlay  moved out just enough for him to get  a grip on it.
 He slid it out,  revealing it to be a square steel peg.  He took it and ran it
 inside the top of the lower half of the slot. It caught, and he deftly slid it
 up and out of sight. It just as easily slid out of the hole when he pulled his
 hand away, however. He set it down, and took off his pack. Taking the tent out
 of it, he once more inserted the peg. He then tossed the tent onto the floor a
 short distance ahead.  The floor sank perceptibly.  The break in the slot also 
 moved, trying to slide into the wall. The peg caught it, and it stopped. 
    The thief crossed the drop-away floor,  leaving behind his tent to hold the
 peg in place, for his escape. He had already crossed three such floors, evaded
 two patrols,   crossed two revines,  traversed  endless dark halls,   and even
 outwitted a maze. If his source was correct, he was now home free. 
    His target was a small ceremonial table. It was gold, with gems set in each
 corner.  Legend had it that it had never been touched since it had been set in 
 its place eons ago.   No one had even approached it,  only gazed  on it from a 
 distance. Now he wanted to take it.
    He walked down the hall. His source had been a priest once, and had studied
 this temple. He knew how the traps worked, and what the walls and floors would
 look like when a trap was built in. The thief now recognized such a pattern in
 the walls. A low ceiling, with square pillar lining the walls. That meant that 
 the roof would drop on him if he put weight on the center of the floor without 
 putting weight first on sides near the  walls.  He accordingly edged along the 
 wall, and was soon past. 
    That was the last trap. He turned the corner, and there was the altar room. 
 Rich furnishings lined the  wall,  but he had eyes only for  the gold table on
 the far wall.
    He walked fearlessly forward.  Nothing impeded him  as he went to claim his 
 prize. He lifted it off its stand, although not without some effort, as it was 
 very heavy.  He turned,  and staggered down the steps.   He reached the floor, 
 took  two  steps,  and,   without  warning,   the  floor collapsed  under  the 
 unaccustomed weight.  The thief fell down to the next floor, which happened to 
 be the dining hall for all the novices.   He escaped with his life, but, alas,
 without his prize,   as the one thing he  had not planned on  was running with
 such a great weight.

                          Review: THE COLOUR OF MAGIC 
    Terry Pratchett is a British author of several SF short stories and a novel
 entitled 'Strata',   available in a Signet  edition.   'The Colour  of Magic', 
 printed  in England  in  1983,   has recently  been  released  in an  american 
 paperback edition  by Signet,  and  has been a  main selection of  the Science 
 Fiction Book Club. 
    The book recounts  the adventures shared by "Twoflower,   a naive insurance 
 salesman turned tourist" and his reluctant native guide, an inept wizard named
 Rincewind.   The first of  four short stories in the book  tell of Twoflower's
 arrival  in  the corrupt  city  of  Ankh-Morpork.   After  meeting  Rincewind,
 Twoflower's  adventures in  the  city,   reminiscent of  Aspirin's  Sanctuary, 
 culminate in  the destruction of the  city.   The second book  describes their 
 awakening of  an ancient  horror in  an abandoned  temple.   The  third is  an 
 account of how Twoflower finally gets his wish to see a dragon,  and the final
 story sends the two reluctant adventurers over  the edge of the Discworld into 
 space.
    Pratchett's style is very readable,  and  spotted with just the right touch
 of humor.   At times  'The Colour of Magic' reminds one  of Anthony's Xanth or
 Adams' Hitchhiker  series,  yet it  always retains a  new and unique  frame of
 fantasy.   An excellent book for those who  are intrigued by the unusual,  and
 the  interaction of  modern  ideas and  medieval  technology.    This book  is
 thoroughly enjoyable light fantasy reading, and quite amusing as well.

                                Alas, Babble On. 

                Here I sit, with page all plain,
                With nary an image in my brain.
                Not spaceship fast or slaughter gory, 
                to be embellished into a story.
                So contrary to my charitable wish, 
                I'll have no story in your next ish.
                And why is my mind all turned to rock?
                I'll tell you. I've got writer's block.

                                   Selection
    The air was stale,  and he felt very little.   His plastic environment suit 
 made a crumpling noise as he turned to face her.  "Lisa?" 
    "Yes, Lloyd?" 
    "What happened to us?    I mean,  we can't touch any  more..."  He left the
 sentence hanging,  contemplating.   Lisa knew what  he wanted to say,  and she 
 shamefully looked at the floor a moment before answering.
    "I'm sorry, Lloyd.  I know.  But if we were to remove these suits, you know
 what would happen..." 
    "Yes, the germs in the air would kill us,  since our bodies have no natural 
 defenses.  So we have to live all our lives in these shells,  in our own self-
 contained environment, but why?  When did it all start?" 
    Lisa was a  mother,  explaining a difficult  and harsh reality to  a child. 
 "Well, it all started a long, long time ago, when mankind was first developing 
 intelligence,  and made houses  to keep him safe and warm,   so that he didn't 
 have to face the elements.  But it really got worse in the last hundred years, 
 when we concentrated on welfare programs, health care, and started taking care
 of  the physically  or  mentally deficient.    We  cheated natural  selection. 
 Because the weaker members of our society were protected,  they survived,  and 
 because they survived, they bred.  The weaker genes were not weeded out due to
 natural selection, and gradually the entire human species became weaker, until 
 we  became  wholly  dependant  on our  man-made  artifices  to  cheat  natural 
 selection." 
    Lloyd also  looked thoughtfully downward.   "And  then there was  the Great
 Plague?  Is that why we have to wear these suits?"
    Lisa's eyes burned with tears.  "Yes, love.   The Great Plague came upon us 
 not long ago.  A sudden outbreak of disease became a worldwide horror, because 
 our scientists couldn't find  a cure for it fast enough.    The disease spread
 quickly, and millions upon millions died, because they had no natural defenses
 left, and we couldn't even find the cause of the disease.   Now we must remain 
 isolated from the natural environment, or else we will die like they did."
    Lloyd mustered the courage to look into Lisa's deep brown eyes.   "But it's 
 unbearable!  Is this what mankind has come to?
  What can we do about it?"
    Lisa broke  the contact by averting  her eyes.   "Nothing,   Lloyd,  except
 live." 
    Lloyd looked about him,  through the clear plastic suit,  at the antiseptic
 white walls, and the sterile linoleum floor.  "If you can call this life."
