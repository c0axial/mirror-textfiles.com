    Hello, and welcome back!   School is back in session, and here is the first
 issue of the year.   Unfortunately,  due to a lack of submissions,  the summer 
 volume only consisted of two issues,  but I  am hoping that with the return to 
 school there will be a corresponding increase in submissions.   Remember, this
 is your zine, and I can't do it alone.   An entire zine by me would be boring, 
 anyways, so for all of you who have thought about submitting anything,  please
 do!
    Well,  hopefully next issue  will be out soon,  depending on  the number of 
 submissions.   I hope that  this issue is not too slow,   since it is composed
 almost entirely  of reviews.    Of course,   Mari Paulsen's  Narret Chronicles 
 continues,   and  the  featured  author  column  this  issue  concentrates  on 
 Christopher Stasheff's Gramayre books. 
    Well, I bid you welcome to volume three,  and remind you that FSFnet cannot 
 continue without reader submissions,  and also that  there are a number of new
 BITNET users  who no doubt enjoy  BITNET use but  have yet to hear  of FSFnet. 
 Please try to spread the word to anyone you think might be interested. 
    PS: Well, thanks to the link between YALEVM  and MAINE, this  issue is  yet
 another week late.   Sorry about that.   Also, look  for a  continuing fantasy 
 work called "The Aquisition"  beginning next  issue and the  continuing Narret 
 science fiction series.  Watch this space!

                           Review: CATS HAVE NO LORD
    "...Dogs serve Ralkan the wolf king,  horses  answer to an aging mare named 
 Flowers,  and ants obey Her Peerless  and Exalted Majesty;  Bzxxyl the 1842th,
 mistress of the Universe and Eater of Treats. Yet cats have no lord... 
    Hawks serve Deathswoop the Daring, but all birds honor the Phoenix.  Sharks 
 only share with  the Hungry One,  while  all fish swim at  Tam tuna's request.
 Cobras turn at the command of the Hood of All-Potent Poison... Now, all snakes 
 revere Nosey Groundsnake.  And so on.
    Some wise folk claim that ther are  creatures smaller that the eye can see.
 If so,  they're ruled by a Supreme Atomie,   for so the God ordered all things 
 when She shaped the level of existence...." 
    "What has this matter of Cat Lords, or the lack thereof, to do with us?"
    "My Order  will pay each  you each three  thousand royals to  climb World's 
 Peak,  discover where the Wisest one lives there and ask her for the answer to 
 that riddle..."
    This is the reason of CATS HAVE NO LORD, if not it's rhyme.  And it's by no 
 means all there is  to this smooth flowing novel by  Will Shetterly.  The main 
 characters, the acrobat/thief, the half-elven swordsman, the merry cleric, and
 the most astute barbarian i've ever read,   must find the Cat Lord while being
 manipulated, helped and hindered by forces arcane and mundane. 
    Gamers and  fans of Robert  Aspirin's Thieves'  World will find  a familiar
 feel to  the novel,  with the  added plus of  being one complete novel  by one 
 author rather than a compendium of short stories. 
    This is  not to say that  'straight' fantasy fans  will be left out  of the 
 action.  Outside of beginning  in an awkward way - the  middle of a telepathic
 discussion between  a woman and  her rather adroit horse  - the world  is full 
 fledged and easy to get into.   Tensions between cities,  lords and races (not
 to mention the various Lords themselves)  give  an overtone that there is more 
 at stake than academic curiosity.  It is almost a must that more will be heard
 from this magical world. 
    CATS HAVE NO LORD by Will Shetterly, Ace Fantasy, New York,  5-85.   Quoted
 in part as a review and not intended to violate any copyrights pending.

                             THE NARRET CHRONICLES
                                 BOOK THE FIFTH 
    "Well, it bears no Soviet markings at any rate, sir."
    "Or any marking's of any kind for that matter, Captain Phillips."
    "Well sir, what should we do now?" 
    "You try to establish radio contact with the bogie while I contact NORAD."
    "They ought to be about ready to communicate by now," thought Samo.   I had
 best stop down the counter-universal communications descanner and encrypter. 
    "Seeker-1 to NORAD, come in NORAD, over."
    "NORAD to Seeker-1, we read colonel, over." 
    "NORAD,  we  have established  visual contact with  the bogie,   have found
 neither hostile nor friendly markings of any kind.   Trying to establish radio
 contact at this time.  Awaiting further instructions, over."
    "Seeker-1,  proceed with communications interface  and report any necessary 
 changes in flight pattern, over."
    "NORAD, we copy, Seeker-1 out." 
    "Any luck captain?"
    "None, sir. There's no response on the standard frequencies at all."
    "That's not surprising,   let's face it - that's not  exactly your standard 
 craft were up against.  Try the international hailing frequency."
    "All right sir...  Seeker-2 to unmarked craft,  Seeker-2 to unmarked craft, 
 please respond."
    "Well," said Samo, "what do you know...  they communicate.  It took them so
 long to find the right frequency I was beginning to have doubts." 
    "Unmarked  craft   to  Seeker-2  -   responding..."  Samo  said   into  the
 communications device."
    "Unmarked craft  you have  violated the  airspace of  the United  States of
 America.  Please identify yourself or we will be forced to shoot you down." 
    "Friendly people." Samo said to himself. "I am Sgt. Dr. Samo Ht.  I come on 
 a mission  of trans-universal importance.    I am  here to prevent  a possible 
 global war.  Mine is a mission of peace, over." 
    "Well, Dr. Ht, this is Colonel William Roberts, US Air Force.  I don't know
 who you are,  or where you come from but if yours is a mission of peace as you
 claim, then I must ask you to cooperate.  At this time you are approaching the
 western boundary of our airspace.  I must ask you to turn your ship around and
 continue in this  formation due east until we receive  clearances for landing. 
 Will you cooperate?"
    "Yes of course, I'll cooperate.   Tell your superiors what I have told you, 
 I come in peace,  and  tell them also that I must speak to  the leaders of the 
 two belligerent nations before an international forum." 
    "Seeker-1 to NORAD come in NORAD, over." 
    "NORAD to Seeker-1 we read, over." 
    "NORAD,  we  have established radio  contact.   The  pilot of the  craft is 
 cooperating and  states he  is on a  mission of peace.    He also  requests to 
 address the President of the United States and the Premier of the Soviet Union
 before the assembled ambassadors of the United Nations. Over." 
    "Seeker-1 the President is in his Oval Office,  at this hour,  and is being
 briefed on  your situation.   Proceed  on a course  for Dover Air  Force Base,
 bearing  120 at  25,000 ft.    We will  notify  the President  of the  pilot's 
 requests and relay further orders as they we receive them, over."
    "NORAD, proceeding 120 degrees at 25,000 feet, Seeker-1 out..."
    "...Dover Control to Seeker-1, come in Seeker-1, over." 
    "Dover Control this is Seeker-1, over."
    "Seeker-1, you are no longer under NORAD command. Permission for landing is 
 granted.   Proceed to dock alien craft in hanger-81, and place your Blackbirds 
 in hanger 71 Alpha."

                     Featured Author: CHRISTOPHER STASHEFF 
    Born in New York  state in 1944,  Christopher Stasheff grew  up immersed in 
 the  developing  years  of  both  television,   radio,   and  science  fiction 
 literature.    Stasheff  maintains  that  de   Camp  and  Pratt's  "Inconpleat 
 Enchanter" is the  single largest influence on his style,   followed by Lester 
 del Rey's "Day  of the Giants" and  "The Sky is Falling".    After writing two
 unpublished novels,  Stasheff began writing a  text for a contest sponsored by
 the Magazine  of Fantasy  and Science Fiction.    Although the  manuscript was 
 never completed until 8 months after  the contest deadline,  Stasheff sent the 
 book to Ace,  who published it as "The  Warlock In Spite of Himself".   He has
 also published three other books:  "King  Kobald" (and "King Kobald Revived"), 
 "The Warlock Unlocked", and "Escape Velocity". 
    There is some question as to the  chronological order in which these novels
 fit together.  For simplicity, they will be discussed in order of publication, 
 rather than  chronological order.   "The Warlock  In Spite of Himself"  is the 
 story of  Rod Gallowglass,   an interstellar explorer,   and his  adventure in 
 trying to establish  democracy on a long-lost planet of  medievals (founded by
 members of the Society for Creative Anachronism,  no less).   Rod discovers an
 interstellar conspiracy  across time  trying to  oppose him,   and he  and his 
 robot-brained horse,  Fess  (who is subject to seizures due  to an engineering 
 problem),  have  their hands full trying  to stymie their  foes,  occasionally 
 using  superior technology,   which  earns Rod  an  unwanted  reputation as  a 
 warlock.  An exceptional book.
    "King Kobald" was published in 1970, although before the recent Ace reprint 
 of  the series,   Stasheff rewrote  the book,   and retitled  it "King  Kobald
 Revived".   This book  takes place approximately two years  after the previous 
 book,  and describes a further threat from the forces opposing Rod's effort to 
 steer the planet, Gramayre,  back to democracy.   His role as Royal Warlock is 
 influential  in  defending Gramayre  from  an  invasion of  Neanderthals  with 
 strange telepathic powers.   An excellent book,  with plenty of excitement and 
 wonderfully developed characters.   The new version  is much improved over the
 original,  due to the rewrite,  but it  does not contradict the other books in 
 the series. 
    "The Warlock Unlocked" is begun following two characters,  Rod,  of course, 
 begins the novel  some 6 years after  "King Kobald",  and Father  Al Uwell,  a 
 priest of the Order of St. Cathode, an engineering saint.  Uwell is being sent
 to Gramayre by the church to monitor Rod,   since he has become so involved in
 the fight for  democracy.   meanwhile,  Rod and his Gramayre  family (wife and
 four children)  are  transported to another world,  and must  discover the way
 back to Gramayre before  the forces against him overthrow all  his works.   He
 meets up with Father Al, who has been tracking him, and together the group has 
 a number of very unique adventures.  A very fast-paced book, indeed. 
    "Escape Velocity"  is the only book of the series that does not concentrate 
 on the events on Gramayre, and is more science fiction than fantasy.   In this
 book, which takes place long before the establishment of Gramayre,  Dar Mandra
 and company must reach Terra before a coup planned by the LORDS overthrows the
 democratic Interstellar Dominion Electorate.    Unfortunately,  someone in the
 upper echelons  has it out for  Dar,  and spreads  the rumor that Dar  and his 
 group are horrible telepaths,  out to pry into every citizen's secret thoughts 
 and desires.   In the following panic, Dar manages to reach Terra.   This book
 is perhaps  the most  interesting of the  series,  as  the characters  are all
 fantastic and yet  somehow believable.   Though the action  is interesting and 
 riveting, the end of the book comes too fast, and seems less well-written than 
 the beginning of  the book.   In this  book,  the founding of  Gramayre (which
 later is  lost during a  "twilight" of democracy and  then later found  by Rod 
 Gallowglass) is described.
    In all the  books,  Stasheff's style is very enjoyable  and readable.   his 
 characters  are all  excellently  depicted,   and there  is  no  lack of  plot
 movement.   His  Gramayre books  are an excellent  fantasy work,   and "Escape
 Velocity" is  a very  good piece  of science  fiction.   His  style is  easily 
 adaptable to  either genre,   since it  does not  concentrate so  much on  the 
 environment,   but on  the human  characters  and their  relations with  other 
 humans.    Altogether an  excellent study  in characterization,   and also  an 
 excellent read!

                       Review:  THE SAGA OF PLIOCENE EXILE
                                 by Julian May 
                              A four book series:
                             The Many-Colored Land
                                The Golden Torc 
                                The Nonborn King 
                                 The Adversary

    All kidding aside,  this set of books is some of  the best SF  I have  ever
 read.    It  is  chock full  of  truly interesting  characters,  plot  twists, 
 insight,  high tech and (yes!)  even  some  action.   There are  several plots 
 running at  once.  MAIN CHARACTERS  actually  DIE!   The GOOD GUYS (if you can
 tell who   they are)   DON'T  always  win!   It is  a delight  to read  and so
 sprawling  in it's plot that it is difficult to describe. 
    Without giving too much away, this is how the  story works: Sometime in the 
 not-too-distant  future  humanity  is  part of  a  Galactic  Milieu of  minds.
 There are many metapsychics that are part of this "cosmic  unity". The psychic 
 powers (such as coercion,  psychokinesis,   etc.)   are supposed to be genetic 
 traits.   Those   people  with  latent  abilities   have  no   way  to    make 
 themselves operant metapsychics.
    Enter  the   time-gate:   A   scientist puts together  a one  way time-gate 
 which runs six-million years into the past.  Notice:  ONE WAY.   Anything that 
 enters  the time  gate  from  the  pliocene   takes   on the   burden  of  six
 million years  of aging.  Until  his  death he  keeps   the gate running  as a
 curiosity.   Upon his death  his  wife supports herself by sending PEOPLE on a 
 one  way   trip  into   the  past.   Many    of   those  disgruntled    latent 
 metapychics  take  that ticket  to get way from it all.
    This time gate tripping  goes on  for many  years.  We then meet a group of 
 time travelers and  follow them on their journey into the past.   Instead of a 
 "Riverworld" type   of  society they   find a   Europe inhabited  by  an alien 
 race!    These Tanu  use   torcs to   make   themselves  and  latent    humans 
 operant   metapychics as well as enslave those that are not latents.
    Can humanity be freed from the slavery of  the torcs?   Do they want to be? 
 Is  the time  gate really  one-way?
    That little synopsis covers the first fifty pages of the first book without 
 giving away the  juicy  details.  Those of you that have already read the book 
 know  that I  haven't even gotten to the really  good stuff.  This is too good 
 to spoil.  It's  in  paperback  so it won't bust your wallet to read it. Trust 
 me.   Read  it during the summer when you  have time to get really involved in 
 it.

     Well, folks, again  I find myself apologizing for  the lateness of 
 this  issue. Unfortuantely  I  have been  busy with  my  new job.  For
 those of you who  are not already aware, I now have  a new id, LISCOMB 
 at MAINE,  as well as  NMCS025. Should  NMCS025 be unavailable,  I may
 be reached  at LISCOMB, but  for the  time being FSFnet  will continue 
 to be sent from  NMCS025. Other news is that the  most recent issue of 
 FSFnet  can  be  found  on  CSNEWS  at  MAINE's  ComDisk  and  can  be
 requested using TELL CSNEWS AT MAINE SENDME FSFNET VOLxNxx FROM COMDISK.
     Also in  the works is a  new project for all  people interested in 
 writing amateur  fantasy fiction. A  group of FSFnet  contributors and
 myself have  begun a  writers' workshop very  similar in  structure to
 the  Thieves'  World project  undertaken  by  Robert Aspirin.  Several
 authors have  begun developing  characters and  stories, all  based in 
 an  area known  as Dargon.  FSFnet  VOL4N01 should  contain the  first 
 written  results of  this  project,  and will  be  in  your reader  in 
 mid-January. If any  of you budding authors are  interested in joining 
 the effort, send me a mail file and I'll be glad to fill you in. 
     Unfortunately, there is  no Narret Chronicle in this  issue due to 
 the fact  that I  cannot get  in touch with  the author.  Hopefully we 
 will get Narret back before volume 4 starts. 
     Finally,  I'd  like  to  remind  you all  that  it's  the  holiday 
 season, and  everyone's got  a new book  out. New  McCaffrey, Anthony,
 Tolkien,  Adams, Daley,  Asimov,  Stasheff, and  anyone  else you  can
 think  of. No  time  to review  them  all right  now.  Next issue  the 
 Acquisition  will  continue,  and  I'll  review  M.A.R.  Barker's  new 
 Tekumel  book, Flamesong,  and, if  I  get it  read, Norman  Spinrad's 
 Star Spangled Future. Until then!

                             THE ACQUISITION
                            Part Two: The Forest 
     Beyond the short  expanse of cultivated fields,  the two travelers
 soon  crossed the  boundary  of  scrub that  marked  the  edge of  the
 forest.  At first,  the  woods were  characterized  by light  beeches,
 birches and poplars.  The leaves of the poplars were  waxy and rustled
 crisply in the soft breeze.
     Banewood recalled his  early childhood when he  would venture into 
 the light woods  in search of edible mushrooms, a  favored delicacy of 
 the  local people.  With his  sharp  and experienced  vision he  could 
 still pick  out his  favorites protruding  through the  fallen leaves. 
 It was  here, while  gathering mushrooms that  Banewood heard  many of
 the childhood  tales and legends passed  to him by his  parents: tales 
 of the  Ludki, those mischievous  little people who lived  deep within
 the  forest and  tales of  Lessy, the  Silvan Lord,  who made  strange 
 animal sounds  and led lost  children astray. Banewood  remembered how 
 his father  would then  make animal  sounds and  frighten him  for the 
 rest of  the day. Stories  of Baba  Yaga, embellished over  the years,
 would cause  tears of fright  to well  up into young  Banewood's eyes. 
 Now, years  older, Banewood still felt  the burning in his  face as he
 realized that Baba Yaga  might be real and that he  might meet face to
 face with the blistering eyes of Kathryn. 
     As  the  two  journeyed  onward,   the  character  of  the  forest
 changed.  Dark  oaks and  towering  elms  now  lined their  path.  The 
 leaves  of years  lay  upon  the ground,  crackling  with every  step.
 Animal sounds diminished. 
     Banewood and  Sod picked their  way uphill, climbing  an overgrown
 path  which led  to an  uncertain fate.  Throughout the  day, Banewood
 and  Sod  walked  the  leagues of  dark  forest,  constantly  catching
 cobwebs  in  the face  and  beleaguered  by blood-thirsty  deer  flies
 scenting their first human. 
     At the  top of  the rise,  the two travelers  paused to  rest. Sod
 sat still  in the hope  of delivering a  killing blow to  the ravenous 
 deer fly which had doggedly followed him during most of the climb. 
     "I  think we  should make  our  first camp  here," said  Banewood. 
 "We're  on  the  nearest  hilltop  and we'll  have  ample  warning  of
 anything approaching."
     "Gotcha!"  Sod finally  killed the  deer fly  which had  settle in 
 his hair  for a  fateful supper.  Sod picked  the scrawny  insect from 
 his hair. "If we  build a smoldering fire we might be  able to spend a
 night without these  cursed flies." Sod gathered some  dead twigs that
 still hung  on the  tree. After arranging  them carefully,  he reached
 into his  bag and brought  out his flint  and steel. Within  minutes a 
 small fire  was being tended.  Banewood walked the perimeter  of their
 encampment and  stopped occasionally  to pick  at some  plants growing
 scattered on the ground. He returned and gave them to Sod. 
     "Here, use these  on the fire. They'll keep away  the flies better
 than the smoke." 
     "Thank  you," said  Sod.  He  threw them  on  the  small fire  and 
 whiffed the  fragrant aroma created  by the consumed leaves.  "How did 
 you  learn so  much  about herbs?"  asked Sod,  who  already knew  the 
 answer. He was fighting his nervousness with small talk.
     "Most  of  what I  know  comes  from  the Shaman,"  said  Banewood
 obligingly. "Now I  have to learn from his books,  but the details are
 really  meager.  Most  of  the  Shaman's knowledge  was  in  his  vast
 memory. He  said that  certain books  did exist.  The Shaman  said the
 books were dangerous because they could fall into the wrong hands." 
     Banewood and  Sod ate  a meal  of wafer bread  and dried  meat and
 then slept  lightly upon cushions of  leaves and boughs laid  upon the 
 ground.  Shallow holes  were dug  out  to provide  recesses for  their 
 hips.  Smoldering coals  kept away  the night  flies, but  they didn't
 ward off Banewood's evil dreams; the crimson eyes still haunted him. 
 Dawn came with the cry of a horned owl. 
     The  dying   coals  were   fed  a   breakfast  of   fresh  tinder. 
 Hard-boiled eggs  and a little herb  tea saw the worried  travelers on 
 their  way. Revitalized  by the  rest, Banewood  and Sod  trekked down 
 the  slope,  meandering  ever  deeper   into  the  dark  forest.  Soon 
 Banewood's sharp eye  caught the first impression of  the large cloven 
 hoofs that  were to show  them the way. The  tracks were too  large to
 belong  to  anything  else  except Kathryn.  Broken  branches  and  an 
 uprooted tree lent  credence to the supposition. To  Sod's relief, the
 tracks were fairly old. 
     Sod fretted  about his  decision to hunt  the sow.  The mysterious
 sword  whose hilt  he often  fondled didn't  seem like  a weapon  that 
 could stop  a charging sow.  Funny how he thought  that if he  set his
 mind to  killing Kathryn,  he would find  a way. Could  they do  it by 
 craft and  artifice? Maybe  by setting  up a dead  fall or  some other
 booby  trap? Funnier  still  was the  feeling that  it  was the  sword 
 which seemed  to whisper that,  given the  resolve, Sod would  be able 
 to meet the challenge. 
     Banewood and  Sod journeyed down the  slope, up the next  hill and
 down another  slope. Leagues passed  beneath their feet.  They skipped 
 lunch  and  walked  under  the  power of  their  stored  energy.  They
 continued  on slight  paths  which joined  and  separated through  the
 forest. Occasionally,  Sod would  stop to  mark a  tree at  eye level,
 entertaining the  hope that they  would somehow return by  this route. 
 Banewood now  walked with  his bow  in hand,  ever keeping  a watchful 
 eye on the path behind them. 
     The  Shaman's longbow  proved  its  value later  in  the day  when 
 Banewood knocked  down a squirrel  with a special  blunt-tipped arrow.
 They  carried  the  black  squirrel  with  them  after  quickly  field
 dressing it.  The little tree rat,  as Banewood called it,  had set up 
 a  frightful  chattering  before  it  met  its  final  doom.  Sod  and 
 Banewood both agreed that  it would be a good idea  to cover some more 
 distance before  feasting on the tree  rat. There was no  telling what 
 attention was  called by  the noisy animal  and, besides,  they didn't
 want to prepare the tree rat until they were ready to make camp.
     The  two journeymen  walked with  greater care  after killing  the
 squirrel. Banewood  regretted his slaying  of the little tree  rat. He
 now had  the uneasy feeling  that the  forest knew of  their presence, 
 that they were  somehow being watched. Sod  sensed Banewood's distress
 or maybe  he, too,  felt the  paranoia. He tightened  his grip  on the
 sword.  Banewood  now  walked  with   an  arrow  nocked.  His  fingers
 whitened from their tight grip.
     Every  minute sound  that the  two seekers  made was  amplified by 
 the forest. Once,  when Banewood turned quickly around,  he thought he
 noticed  a pair  of amber  eyes  watching them,  but they  disappeared
 quickly  and he  was  no  longer sure.  Tension  increased with  every
 step. Both travelers  began to perspire. Suddenly, the  explosion of a
 dry  twig  snapping   sent  Banewood  and  Sod   into  a  back-to-back 
 position, their weapons  drawn and poised. An  electric tension pulsed 
 within them, begging to surge, asking for release. But nothing happened.
     No   other  sound   was   heard  throughout   the  forest.   After 
 excruciating  minutes of  silence, Banewood  and Sod  voted to  resume
 their  walk. Several  more hours  of travel  brought them  to a  small
 stream in  the forest. The  water looked wholesome, affording  the two 
 an opportunity to  refill their flasks and to bathe.  This looked like
 the  ideal  place  to  pitch   camp  and  prepare  a  welcome  supper. 
 Banewood's tree  rat no longer  looked as appetizing; however,  it was
 the best  food that  they had.  Throughout the  meal and  respite they 
 remained watchful, for the penetrating silence of the forest remained.
     Evening  had settled  rapidly.  Sod and  Banewood  ate near  their
 fire,  slowly finishing  their meal  and conversing.  The fire  cast a 
 bright  glow  around the  immediate  circumference,  but outside,  the 
 darkness was forbidding. Sod thought again about his quest.
     "If  I  hadn't found  this  sword,  I  probably would  never  have 
 attempted  such a  foolish  venture," Sod  thought  to himself.  "This
 fine looking  weapon is of  too fine  a quality for  a man like  me. I
 wonder if I shouldn't give it to someone worthy of possessing such a weapon."
     Aloud,  Sod said  "We've  been in  this forest  for  two days.  It 
 doesn't appear to hold the danger I had anticipated." 
     "The  danger lies  in  our laxness  if we  trust  in our  safety," 
 replied  Banewood,  parrying  Sod's  wishful thought.  "Tonight  I  am
 sleeping with my bow in hand."
     Speaking the  unspoken, Sod  said "Then you  also feel  like we've 
 been watched?"
     "Ya,"  replied Banewood.  "I  thought I  saw it  once,  a pair  of 
 eyes. I've learned to trust my intuition."
     Tensing and grabbing  for his sword, Sod said  "Your intuition was
 right!  Look!  Out  there,  see  those eyes?  I  don't  think  they're 
 friendly." Sod pointed in the direction of the creek. 
     They both stood  up and moved around the fire,  placing it between
 themselves  and  the  presence.  The  same  amber  eyes  Banewood  had
 thought  he'd  seen earlier  were  slowly  reeling toward  them.  When
 their distance from the  eyes was cut in half, Sod  threw an armful of
 dry tinder upon the fire and threw extra light out into the night.
     "It's a wolf." Whispered Banewood. 
     "It's too  big." Answered Sod, who  was beginning to quake  in his 
 boots. His sweaty  fingers grasped the sword tighter. "How  am I going
 to kill the  wolf if it attacks?" he thought,  questioning his ability 
 to wield the sword. 
     A deep,  gutteral growl emanated  from the large  slavering beast.
 It crept forward  with its belly low  to the ground, ready  to leap at 
 the instant. Sod raised his sword slightly and then cried out.
     "Oh no!"
     In the  same instant  that the fell  beast launched  itself toward
 them, Sod's  sword slipped out of  his hand and dropped  to the ground 
 at  a distance.  The  lunging  hulk darkened  his  view.  Sod heard  a
 snapping chord like  the sound of his heart breaking.  The wind rushed
 past his left ear. 
     In a  massive thud,  a large  wolf, larger than  any Sod  had ever
 seen or  heard of before,  fell at his side.  Its eyes were  wide open 
 and  its lips  were curled  in a  hideous grimace.  A feathered  shaft
 protruded from its throat. 
     Banewood's hand rested on Sod's shoulder. "Are you okay?" he asked. 
     "You  killed him.  I  thought I  was  going to  die  and, just  as 
 suddenly, this wolf  is dead instead. You've saved my  life. How can I
 repay you?"
     "Don't worry; it  all comes out in the wash.  But what happened at 
 the last second? Why did you drop your sword?" 
     "I don't know...  I guess my mind went blank.  The sword seemed to
 slip from my  hands," said Sod. "I've  never seen such a  fine shot. I
 think the wolf was dead before it hit the ground!"
     "I've tipped  some of my  arrows with  the juice of  the aconitum;
 it is a deadly poison." 
     "With such a weapon as yours, you could single-handedly slay Kathryn!"
     "It won't work. I've already tried," answered Banewood.
     Sod  was taken  aback by  this.  "There's certainly  more to  this
 Shaman than meets the eye," he thought. Aloud, "When did you try that?" 
     "On the last  night that Kathryn attacked I hid  myself and loosed
 my best arrow against her. It shattered as if it had hit a rock."
     Sod was  incredulous. "How are  we ever going  to stop her  if she 
 is as you say?"
     "I don't know. We'll think of something." 
     "Ya," Sod said without sincerity. 
     The wolf  was enormous,  but Banewood  and Sod,  after endeavoring 
 for the better  part of an hour,  managed to drag the  beast away from
 the camp.  The two found no  difficulty in dropping off  to sleep, for 
 though the forest was still dangerous, it now possessed one less threat.
     Dawn came  without a sound.  Banewood and Sod  got up and  fed the 
 fire and  went to  the creek for  water. On the  way, they  looked for
 the wolf, but it  was gone! They searched around the  area in the hope 
 that  they were  disoriented last  night  when they  dragged the  wolf 
 out. It  was gone. Now  a very real fear  possessed them; it  may have 
 been Baba  Yaga. How  else can  a dead  animal disappear?  Sod's empty
 stomach felt like it held a rock.
     Suddenly,  through   the  trees,  they  heard   a  musical  voice. 
 Banewood and Sod  quickly reached for their weapons.  Through the tall 
 trees they could  see an approaching figure. It was  gaily dressed and
 wore a tall, pointed hat with a feather in its band. It sang:

                             "Hey ho, hey ho,
                       the wolk's a dead you know.
                          for if it ain't a dead
                           then I'm a not alive 
                        and I know I'd better go!"

     The  two stood  with their  mouths open.  Marching straight  up to 
 them was a  short person, a very little person,  with large round eyes 
 and a pudgy little nose.
     "Hello, hello, my name is Stickleburr unless I'm not, of course." 
     Sod and  Banewood found themselves  face to  face with one  of the
 Ludki. The childhood descriptions were indeed accurate. He looked so odd! 
     "I want  to thank you for  killing the great wolk  because he's no 
 longer alive.  He has been plaguing  my people for years,  but not for 
 years to  come. Anyway, they're not  really my people, they  are their
 own people, but I guess you wouldn't call us people, would you?"
     Banewood  spoke:  "I...I  thought  that the  wolf,  I  mean  wolk,
 wasn't dead, that maybe it was really Baba Yaga." 
     Stickleburr jumped.  "Oh, no! I  mean yes,  it was really  a wolk. 
 It's  certainly dead  now, isn't  it? You  two are  heroes, unless  of 
 course you  don't think so. So  that's the wolksmert, isn't  it?" Said
 Stickleburr pointing to Sod's strange sword.
     "Wolksmert?"  Replied Sod.  "Oh,  yes. Certainly."  He laughed  at 
 the irony, because "wolksmert" meant "wolfslayer" in the eastern tongue.
     "Yes,  most certainly,"  laughed  Stickleburr. "You  two can  come 
 with me  unless you  can't. We  want to thank  you properly,  and it's 
 not proper to thank you here."
     Banewood and  Sod agreed  to follow  the Ludki  back to  his home. 
 They  quickly   broke  camp   and  gathered  their   belongings.  They 
 whispered  and laughed  among  themselves, marvelling  at the  strange 
 speech  pattern of  Stickleburr: Ludki  always followed  the assertion 
 of a  positive statement  with it's  negative. It  was a  most curious
 pattern of speech, but it wasn't curious at all to the Ludki.
     Within  a  half-hour,  the  three  came  in  sight  of  the  Ludki 
 village. It  was set in a  small dale cleared of  trees. Little houses
 in the  shape of bee hives  lay haphazard about the  village. Wisps of
 smoke curled  out of their tops.  The Ludki were fond  of smithing, as
 was  evident from  the many  miniature iron  furnaces that  sent their
 black  smoke up  over the  rooftops. The  Ludki village  had evidently 
 been  in this  location for  some time  because much  of the  area was 
 cleared of  the hardwood  trees essential for  the making  of charcoal 
 needed to smelt the iron.
     The  little people  walked  about in  gaily  colored clothes.  The 
 Ludki  men wore  high pointed  hats dressed  up with  bright feathers.
 They were a  happy folk. The air  was full of whistling  and the songs
 of their merriment.
     When  Stickleburr and  the two  travelers approached,  the village
 folk poured out  to meet the heros. Stickleburr  began introducing his 
 family  and the  more prominent  of the  Ludki to  the strangers.  The 
 names  came   rapidly:  Milfoil,   Hyssop,  Lavender,   Mullien,  Five 
 Fingers, Violet, and,  well, you get the idea; they  were all names of
 plants  that the  Ludki  were fond  of.  At the  bark  of orders  from
 Stickleburr,  the  Ludki busied  themselves  with  preparations for  a
 great  feast. The  men  set  up tables  and  stools,  built fires  and 
 brought out kegs  of mead. The Ludki women quickly  filled their ovens 
 with various  breads and foods  until the heavenly aroma  replaced the
 acrid  smell   of  smelting  iron.   The  Ludki  loved   feasting  and 
 merriment,  and  this  occasion,  as   any  other,  was  an  excellent 
 opportunity  to lay  aside  their  work. The  fearful  wolk which  had
 terrorized the  Ludki for so many  years was dead, slain  at the hands
 of the tall folk and wolksmert. 
     Among  the Ludki,  wolksmert  was the  center  of much  attention.
 Their  large  eyes  beamed  with   admiration  and  the  little  hands 
 eagerly,  but reverently,  touched  the fine  metal.  From the  Ludki,
 Banewood could  learn nothing  about the sword,  but by  their evident 
 joy at seeing it and the two travelers, the Ludki seemed strangely elated.
     Even  while  the  preparations  were  still  underway,  the  eager 
 little Ludki began  to celebrate with joyous  abandon. Musicians began 
 their tunes  and the mead was  passed around. And such  mead! Banewood 
 and Sod  both drank  and agreed  that it  was the  best they  had ever 
 tasted.  How  the Ludki  could  consume  so  much  of it  without  the
 obvious signs of inebriation, they couldn't guess.
     During the  feast, Stickleburr talked  with the two  strangers and
 learned the  reason for  their sojourn  into the  deep forest.  At the 
 news, Stickleburr balked but then regained his composure. 
     "Oh yes, we  had most certainly believed that Baba  Yaga had died,
 for we  had not  seen her  alive. And  Kathryn, oh  yes, we  had heard 
 whisperings  of her  rampages,  else  we were  deaf.  Kathryn is  Baba
 Yaga? We most certainly hope she isn't!" 
     "Yes, most certainly," agreed Banewood.
     Sod, careful  not to  spill a  drop of the  mead he  was drinking, 
 looked at Stickleburr  and asked, "Do you  know of the way  to the hut 
 of Baba Yaga?" 
     Stickleburr replied  "No, no...well yes,  sort of. I know  the way
 but I don't know  how to get there. It's a long  way off, although not 
 that  far to  someone as  long-legged as  you, though  for yourselves, 
 I'm sure you're not all that long-legged." 
     Stickleburr  was  beginning to  show  some  signs of  inebriation. 
 Banewood  and Sod  sat  back  to enjoy  the  feast.  They watched  the
 antics  of the  Ludki as  they  danced their  high-kicking dances  and 
 swung their  arms in  the air.  With a  shout, the  dancers punctuated
 the songs  with a "hey!"  At length,  even the subdued  travelers were 
 on their  feet and kicking. The  Ludki laughed and clapped  to urge on 
 the long-legged  dancers. Sod  twirled like  a top  and bobbed  like a
 cork.  At a  feverish  pace, he  was caught-up  in  the festive  mood.
 Moments  before he  could  dance  no more,  the  song  stopped with  a
 rousing "hey!" 
     Stickleburr  was  much impressed  with  the  two travelers.  After
 slapping  both of  them  on  the shoulders,  the  squat little  fellow 
 mounted a stump and cleared his throat.
     "Ahem!" The crowd  became silent. "I'd like to  express the thanks
 of all Ludki for what you two have done. We couldn't have done it ourselves." 
     Stickleburr  brought out  a  long  object and  handed  it to  Sod. 
 "This is for the wolksmert unless it's for something else.
     Sod looked at  the fine-crafted sheath given to him  by the Ludki.
 The sword slid  silently into it's scabbard. Sod  expressed his thanks 
 with a smile and a nod. 
     "And  these," continued  Stickleburr,  "are for  the Banewood  and
 they're not for anyone else."
     Banewood  received a  quiver  full of  fine, Ludki-crafted  arrows
 with  razor-sharp metal  heads. The  shafts were  straighter than  any
 Banewood had ever seen.
     With great bombast,  the swaying Stickleburr went on  to offer the
 friendship of  the Ludki to  Banewood and  Sod. Much to  his surprise,
 Sod immediately  took him up on  his offer for assistance.  This was a 
 surprise,   because  the   Ludki   had  very   traditional  views   of
 hospitality. After  favors, guests did  not customarily ask  for more. 
 But Sod did. He  wanted to know the way to Baba  Yaga's hut. The Ludki 
 blanched at  such a  request. Oh  horrors! But it  was only  a request
 for directions;  the Ludki need  not accompany the  travelers. Anyway,
 thanks to the mead,  Stickleburr was in a jovial mood.  He went so far
 as to offer guidance to the outside of their realm.

                        Review: THE DEAD OF WINTER
                        Thieves' World Book Seven
     Robert  Lynn Aspirin's  Thieves'  World series  continues in  this 
 new paperback  from Ace, and  it is, in my  opinion, quite a  step up. 
 The  most recent  TW books  have  been, to  me, a  letdown. They  were 
 bogged down with  the heavy-handed politics of Sanctuary  and were not 
 interesting to  read. Book 7  starts slowly, but soon  improves vastly
 into  what I  believe to  be the  best TW  book written  to date.  The
 Veiled  Lady, by  Andrew Offut,  is a  very warm  and amusing  tale of 
 Ahdio, the  keeper of Sly's Place  in Downwind. When the  Spirit Moves 
 You, by  Aspirin, is also one  of the best  tales TW has put  out, and
 nowehere  near  as heavy-handed  as  previous  efforts. The  Color  of 
 Magic by Diana  Paxson returns us to the household  of Lalo the Limner
 and  Gilla, who  is taken  captive by  a Roxane  who is  determined to
 sink Santuary  in a storm  of epic  porportions. For me,  however, the 
 most  wonderful  story  was  by   Diane  Duane,  called  Down  by  the
 Riverside. It  is an account of  the death of Harran  and what happens
 when  the twin  goddesses Sivieni  and the  once-mute Mriga  find out.
 They  and   their  dog,  Tyr,   elicit  the   aid  of  Ischade   in  a
 wonderfully-depicted  descent to  Hell and  back, and  is filled  with
 surprises. Buy the book if just for this story!
     This book is a  must for TW fans, and a  wonderful breath of fresh
 air  after  the  dry  politics  of the  previous  books.  You  may  be
 surprised to  find that cover  art is being  done by Gary  Ruddell, so
 the book  looks a  little different,  but you  should have  no trouble
 finding it. Unless, of course, the bookstore runs  out before  you get
 your copy!

     Well, I  had this issue  all set to  go out before  Christmas, and
 then Yale went  down for vacation. Sigh. Well, I  guess late is better
 than never.  In this issue we  continue with both the  Acquisition and
 the Narret Chronicles,  thanks to Mari's staying up until  3am to type
 it in. I hope  you enjoy them. There will be one  more issue in Volume
 3,  which will  follow on  the heels  of this  issue, before  we start
 Volume 4  and the Dargon writing  project. By the way,  I've rewritten 
 the  FSFnet sending  program again.  Anyone  who wants  to change  the
 program I  use to  send their  issues please mail  me. You  may choose

                          The Narret Chronicles 
                              Book the Third
     "Dr. Ht  this is Dr. Terrence  Seni of the Armed  Forces Institute
 of Pathology  at Sir Walter Reed  Medical Center, and Dr.  Adam Tristy
 of  the American  College of  Surgeons.  They will  be examining  you, 
 with your permission of course." 
     "Surely." said Samo
     "Dr Seni  is the nation's foremost pathologist, and Dr.  Tristy is 
 one our most prominent bio-physicists."
     "Really, well  this is quite  a reception... Pleased to  meet both 
 of  you gentlemen.  You can  examine me  if you  wish, but  I'd rather
 provide you with  the data myself. You see, I  have all the  pertinent
 information on  our physiology stored on  tape in my craft. Allow me a 
 moment  will you  and I'll  be  back with  the  data you  wish for  in
 several of your languages. 
     "Here you are,  'Yarg's  Complete Physiology  of  the Narretan'  a 
 Narret classic  physiology text. The  best ever produced!  That should
 answer  all your  questions concerning  our physiology,  but I'll  bet
 you still  want to know  about my  AND molecular structure.  That I'll 
 leave up to you."
     "Could we  take a small blood  sample to help us  study the makeup
 of  your  circulatory,  respiratory, lymphatic,  and  immune  systems?
 Such a sample  would provide us with the AND  molecular structure data
 we also desire." asked Dr. Seni.
     "Sure." said  Samo "I'd be glad  to help in  any way I can.  I'm a 
 scientist myself.  I was only  kidding when I  said I hate  needles. I 
 was just trying to get a laugh." 
     "Make  a  fist,"  said  Seni as he searched  Samo's  arm's  densly
 packed molecules for a vein. "This may pinch a little." 
     "No  sweat,"  said  Samo.  "What  you  gentlemen  will  really  be 
 interested in  though, is  the fact that  in the  counter-universe, we
 are not solid creatures at all, as you know it." 
     "Really?" queried Tristy as he took notes. 
     "Yes, really."  said Samo.  "At home,  on Amrif  Arret, we  are by
 our  own nature  of  a  gaseous form.  As  your  molecular forces  are
 attractive  here,  ours are  repulsive,  thus,  we are  all  perfectly
 non-solid, as opposed to your solidity."
     "How extraordinarily fascinating!" exclaimed Tristy. 
     "In fact all  our worlds, stars, everything is  unbound but space,
 which is the  solid through which we  all pass. That is why  I can get 
 here  so much  faster in  our system  of time,  our entire  concept of
 time  is  based  on  density  of our  solid  space,  rather  than  the 
 vacuousness of yours. It  is far easier, I assure you, for a plasma to
 pass through a solid than a solid to pass through a vacuum."
     "Ahh, I  got all  but that  last bit  then I  lost you,  could you
 clarify the part about easier..." started Dr. Tristy.
     "Surely,"  Samo interrupted  "You see,  when we  pass through  the 
 solid  form of  our space,  we use  the actual  binding forces  of the
 particles  in  motion   of  the  spatial-solid  in   order  to  propel
 ourselves.  Thus  we  can  utilize  the very  nature  of  our  'space'
 itself, as  a means, or  force of  propulsion. Do you  understand that
 better, doctor?" 
     "Much better, thank you. I must say this is all quite astounding.."
     "Not  at all,  simply the  state of  nature doctor.  Which reminds 
 me, I  wish to  make a statement  on the wisdom  of our  physicians in 
 the Narret  System. If you  would be so kind  as to record  it doctor, 
 I'm sure all of humanity will find it of great use." 
     "Surely, any advice  you can give would be held  in highest regard 
 by our scientific communities." said Dr. Tristy
     "It  came to  pass, through  the thousands  of Losar  Cycles (what
 you call  years) of our  existence, that  our physicians began  to use
 the fundamental laws  of nature in their favor. Rather  than fight the
 immune  system  for example,  they  found  ways of  strengthening  it, 
 bolstering  its abilities.  Cancer, as  another example  was found  to
 contain  cells of  a  much  stronger variety  than  those  said to  be
 normal. What  our physicians did was  to retrain the immune  system to 
 work on  the AND  structure within  the Cancerous  cells, so  that the
 dominant  Cancer cells  were effectively  "programmed" to  conduct the
 function  of  the  tissue  it   replaced.   And  this  new,  Cancerous 
 super-cell  was  stronger  and  better   than  the  original  cell  it 
 replaced, because  it lives  longer and is  less  suceptable  to other 
 diseases. Therefore  your physicians  should also  learn to  work with
 and not against nature."
     "Thats absolutely  astounding. You've  just helped us  realize how 
 far we've  set back Cancer research  in the last 50  years. We've been 
 trying  to eradicate  it  for  so long  we  completely overlooked  the
 possibility of trying to turn it into something useful. Incredible!"
     "I see you're rather enthused at the prospect." said Samo. 
     "Enthused? I'm  simply overjoyed  at the possibility  that there's
 a cure  for our  worst killer.  Cancer claims  millions of  lives here 
 each year."
     "Yes, I know..." stated Samo. 
     "Dr Ht.  you have no  idea how  much just that  little information
 you just  shared with  us means,  how many  millions of  peoples lives
 this few  minutes you've shared  with us  will save. Mankind  shall be 
 forever in your debt."
     "Oh, I think  I do." said Samo "Remember,  peace and understanding
 throughout these  universes is  what I  came here  for. And  sharing a
 little scientific knowledge  in the process is the least  I can do. If
 you gentlemen will  excuse me, I see  the colonel at the  door. I have 
 another  speech to  give,  and I  hope if  everything  goes well,  you
 gentlemen may get a little more time to work on your medical problems."

                             The Acquisition
                                 The Hut
     In the morning,  bright and early, Banewood and Sod  were woken by 
 the sound of  little marching feet. A troop of  gaily dressed Ludki in
 tall, feathered hats approached them. 
     "Hey Hyssop!  Hey Burdock!"  shouted Stickleburr  as he  clapped his 
 hands.  Immediately,  two  little   people  ran  forward.  Stickleburr 
 addressed Banewood and Sod. 
     "Good  morning,  unless it's  already  mid-day.  My two  sons  and
 myself  will accompany  you to  the borders  of our  realm unless  you
 don't wish to be accompanied. First, though, you must have breakfast."
     Stickleburr clapped  his hands again and  several Ludki approached 
 with steaming  plates of food.  The travelers ate with  relish, though 
 there wasn't  any. From a nearby  keg they filled their  flasks with a 
 light mead and they were ready to depart. 
     Banewood and  Sod followed  the Ludki as  they marched  off, their 
 pace marked by  the rhythm of the Ludki's singing.  Hyssop and Burdock 
 marched ahead while  Stickleburr walked and chatted  with Banewood and
 Sod. He told them  about the paths ahead and how  they must not stray,
 lest they tread paths  unknown. He told them to be  on their guard for
 the Silvan Lord,  for these were his woods. The  Silvan Lord, or Lessy
 as he  was better known, would  lead them astray with  his lies. Lessy 
 was  a liar  at  heart and  he delighted  in  deluding the  hopelessly 
 lost. He  would draw them  to one point and  then to another,  then to 
 another and  yet another.  However, there was  one way  of outsmarting
 the  Lessy. It  was a  method  known only  to  the Ludki,  and it  was 
 Stickleburr's parting gift to the travelers. 
     "Lessy  is a  liar,"  said  Stickleburr, "for  he  can't tell  the
 truth. To  get to  the truth, if  it's lies you  don't want,  you must 
 wear  your  clothes  inside-out   or  outside-in  if  they're  already 
 inside-out. Your shoes  you must wear on the opposite  feet unless, of
 course, your feet are already opposite.  Then you just wear  your feet 
 opposite." 
     Banewood and Sod laughed aloud at Stickleburr's foolish words.
     "It  is  worthy of  a  children's  rhyme  even though  it  doesn't 
 rhyme," Banewood said. 
     They all laughed again at the strange paradox of Ludki speech.
     After their  having walked away the  longest part of the  day, and 
 after their  having heard innumerable anecdotes  from Stickleburr, the 
 two  travelers  parted  company  with  the  Ludki.  Banewood  and  Sod 
 marched on  at a much faster  pace, since they needn't  keep time with
 the short-legged  Ludki. Once  again, the  brightness of  sunlight and 
 companionship  dimmed   as  the   travelers  departed  the   realm  of
 civilization. The  dark forest  seemed darker  without the  chatter of
 the little people.
     A  dark,  sinuous path  pointed  out  by  Stickleburr led  in  the
 direction of  the setting sun. The  roots of gnarled oaks  lay twisted 
 across the  path, occasionally catching  the carefully placed  feet of
 the  plowman. Spider  webs built  across  the gaps  of branches  often 
 ended up  in the faces of  Banewood and Sod, tickling  their noses and 
 generally making  their way unpleasant.  Pale mushrooms of  the deadly 
 varieties  could  sometimes be  seen  lining  the  edge of  the  path.
 Strange animal sounds echoed through the trees. 
     After  hours of  walking,  the  travelers still  had  not found  a
 resting place  suitable for a  night's encampment. Though the  sun was 
 possibly  an hour  away  from setting,  the way  had  become dark  and
 difficult  to  navigate  because  of the  forest  canopy.  At  length, 
 Banewood and  Sod stopped to  decide which  way the path  was supposed
 to lead. The forest  seemed more alive at this dusky  hour than it had
 earlier  in  the day.  Birds  chirped  and strange  animals  chattered 
 beyond the distant trees. 
     "I don't  know," said Sod,  "maybe we  should stop right  here and
 wait  until morning.  I just  can't be  sure of  keeping on  the right
 path if we go on." 
     "Oh,  don't worry,  I'll show  you  the way  to go  from here,"  a 
 strange voice answered.
     Banewood  and Sod  quickly  drew their  weapons  and stood  ready. 
 Wolksmert glowed  reddish from  the light of  the evening  sun. Before
 them stood an  eerie sight. A greenish man, or  something resembling a 
 man, though  much taller, stood  a dozen  paces before them.  His eyes
 had  an  orange, malevolent  glow.  They  appeared cat-like.  Banewood 
 feared  the  worst,  for  to his  inexperienced  knowledge,  the  eyes
 reminded  him of  Baba  Yaga's.  The apparition  was  dressed in  what 
 appeared to be leaves. A bird nest was perched upon the shoulder. 
     Sod felt  the hilt of his  sword slide through the  sweaty grip of 
 his fingers.  His hand clenched  Wolksmert tighter. He  wondered about
 what  action he  should take.  Quickly, he  decided that  it would  be 
 safest to let the creature make the first move.
     The  green figure  stood before  them  and made  a chirping  sound
 like  a  bird.  He  clapped  his  hands and  then  smiled.  It  was  a
 friendly, disarming smile. 
     "Take the  path straight  ahead until  you come  to a  fork," said 
 the strange  apparition. "Then, bear  left until  you come to  a large
 boulder  and proceed  to your  right until  you come  to an  old tree.
 >From the  tree, go  left until  you meet  the next  tree, then  take a
 sharp right to the first stream. You can't miss it." 
     "Uh,  excuse  us for  a  moment,  if  you please,  sir."  Banewood 
 tugged at Sod's shoulder and pulled him away. 
     "Oh  yes,  most  certainly,  yes, yes."  The  green  man  laughed, 
 clapped his hands and chattered like a tree rat.
     "What's  the  matter?  Who's  that?  What  are  we  doing?"  Sod's 
 questions came quickly and nervously.
     "Shhhh!" hissed Banewood  as he led Sod out of  sight of the green 
 man. When  they were safely  out of  sight, Banewood said,  "That must 
 be Lessy,  the Silvan  Lord. Stickleburr warned  us of  him. Remember,
 he'll lie to get us lost. Let's hurry and turn our clothes inside out."
     As quickly  as they could,  Banewood and Sod pulled  their clothes
 off  and reversed  them. They  turned the  insides outside  and helped
 each  other button-up  from the  back. They  did the  same with  their 
 britches.  Then,  they   pulled  off  their  boots   and  placed  them
 opposite: left  boot on right foot  and right boot on  left foot. When
 they had  finished, they smiled  sheepishly and stepped back  out into 
 the open. Lessy was patiently waiting, whistling to himself and smiling. 
     When  the Silvan  Lord  saw  how Banewood  and  Sod appeared,  his
 orange eyes opened wide and  bulged.  He stood stiff with  his fingers 
 out-stretched. 
     "Eeaarrgh! Owwww!"  Screamed Lessy.  He jumped around  and emitted
 more strange sounds.
     Sod stood nonplussed, unable to move during the exhibition.
     Banewood  took the  initiative and  said aloud:  "Tell us,  Silvan
 Lord, which is the way to the hut of Baba Yaga." 
     "Eeaarrgh! Owwww! I'll  talk, I'll tell you the  truth, I promise!
 I'll tell you anything, but pulleese! Straighten-out your clothes!" 
     Banewood and  Sod felt sorry  for the Silvan Lord.  Evidently, the 
 truth was  so foreign to  Lessy that  it caused him  great discomfort.
 When Banewood and  Sod had put their clothes  back on outside-outside,
 they  returned  to Lessy.  The  Silvan  Lord  was now  docile,  almost 
 subdued; he was saddened by his loss of victims to his trickery.
     "Yes, most  certainly," said Lessy,  "I will  show you the  way to 
 Baba Yaga's hut. Yes, then you'll wish you were lost! Follow me." 
 Banewood and Sod walked behind Lessy as he led them through the dark
 forest night. 
     Since  they had  first  met  the Silvan  Lord,  the  sun had  set, 
 changing  the long  shadows to  a solid  smear of  blackness. The  two
 travelers were both  stabbed by the sharp pang of  doubt as to whether 
 Lessy  could be  held  to his  word. Whatever  the  status of  Lessy's
 honor, Banewood and  Sod realized that they were both  in the hands of
 the Lord of the Forest.
     Lessy strode  before them, mumbling  to himself and  emitting more 
 strange sounds. More  than once, Banewood and Sod had  tripped on tree 
 roots and stumbled  to the ground. Low branches snapped  back by Lessy 
 often caught Sod  in the face and chest, leaving  him sore and scored.
 The long hours of night were unbearably drawn out in this manner.
     When the slender  rays of first morning light  pierced through the
 trees,  the  three travelers  found  themselves  on  the edge  of  the
 forest.  Sod  felt   a  heaviness  in  his  stomach   when  the  first 
 realization  of  their  plight  hit  him: How  were  they  to  return?
 Neither of them had thought of marking their way. 
     Lessy  turned to  face the  exhausted travelers.  The faint  light
 barely illuminated his  gnarled and worn face. Banewood  and Sod could
 only  concentrate   on  the   eyes--  those  strange   cat-like  slits 
 surrounded by an orange glow.
     "Here is where  I'll leave you," said Lessy. "The  rest of the way 
 is  before you.  You'll  probably  reach the  hut  by mid-day."  Lessy 
 chuckled as  he pointed to  the path before  them. As quickly  as when 
 they  had  found him,  the  Silvan  Lord  disappeared into  the  green
 growth of the forest. 
     The path  lay before them. Banewood  and Sod stood on  the edge of
 the dark  forest and  before a  vast expanse  of scrub.  Sod preferred 
 the darkness  of the forest  to what he now  saw: a thin  path leading
 through  a  tangle  of  long-thorned   trees  which  were  so  closely 
 interwoven that they seemed inpenetrable.
     "Why don't you try Wolksmert on those branches," offered Banewood.
     Sod drew his  sword and swung lightly against the  tangle that lay 
 before him.  Sod was glad  for the chance to  draw his sword  and test
 its edge. The massive, thorny growth fell to their feet.
     "Only Kathryn  could walk a path  like this," commented Sod  as he 
 continued to slice  his way through. "These branches are  so sharp and 
 tightly  interwoven that  only the  sow could  manage to  walk through
 unscathed." 
     The  plowman  and the  Shaman,  however,  could not  pass  through 
 unharmed. Even though  the path was partially cleared  by Sod's sword,
 some branches  remained to tear  at their clothing and  puncture their
 skin.  Punished and  brutalized  by  the last  leg  of their  journey, 
 Banewood and  Sod proceeded slowly,  their hearts heavy with  fear and 
 anticipation. By  noon, they had  passed through the forest  of thorns 
 and had entered  into a wide perimeter of tall  grasses and occasional
 trees. Banewood sniffed the air and winced.
     "Look," he  said, pointing to a  large copse of assorted  and vile
 smelling weeds. "This must have once been Baba Yaga's herb garden." 
     The  expanse  of  foul-smelling  weeds grew  unbounded.  They  had
 probably  been untended  for many  decades, but  they still  held firm 
 against  the  encroaching  forest  and field.  One  fell  weed  pitted
 itself  against the  other  for dominance  of space.  It  was an  evil 
 looking  tangle. Banewood  hoped  he  could return  by  this path  and
 gather  some of  the herbs.  A  few were  familiar to  him; they  were 
 shaman's  herbs.  Some  plants   had  divinatory  purposes,  some  had
 medicinal  uses.  Other  plants  were total  strangers  to  Banewood's
 herbal. These were the most curious to the novice.
     Reluctantly,  the  two pressed  on.  Because  of the  tall  grass,
 Banewood and  Sod didn't see the  hut until they were  almost in front 
 of it.  The hut of Baba  Yaga loomed dark before  them. Centuries old, 
 the  hut was  partially  collapsed at  one end;  it  appeared like  an
 apparition,  grayish  and  fragile.  The   grass  about  the  hut  was 
 trampled-- signs of  a current inhabitant. Banewood was  shaken by the 
 sight; it  was an eerie  recollection of his divinatory  dreams, minus
 the malevolent red  eyes. Sod sensed the nervousness  of his companion 
 and  gripped  Wolksmert tightly.  He  glanced  over his  shoulder  and
 searched  around them.  The  scene was  quiet. Not  even  a bird  song 
 could be  heard. Sod turned and  shook his companion's hand.  It was a 
 farewell  to their  past and  an initiation  to whatever  would befall
 them in the moments ahead.
     Banewood and  Sod resolutely approached  the hut. It  looked weak,
 but it  stood in evidence  of craftsmanship from a  forgotten century. 
 Patches of  straw, now  grayish, were  still attached  to the  roof. A
 few strange  weeds had taken residence  on the roof in  order to catch
 extra light. On the  roof's peak perched a dark bird.  It was a raven.
 It  waddled about  and croaked  a few  times, picked  at the  wood and 
 then silently winged out of sight. 
     Sod held  out Wolksmert and  walked toward the dimly  lit entrance
 of the ramshackle  hut. Fat spiders retreated to the  shadows with the
 approach  of the  plowman. Sod's  heart quickened  and his  whole body 
 started to  tremble slightly.  He placed his  feet carefully  to avoid 
 making any  sounds. With  Banewood close behind,  Sod craned  his neck
 through the  doorway. It  took an  agonizing instant  for his  eyes to 
 grow accustomed to  the dim light. Was there something  inside? Had it
 heard them  coming? Where is  it? Nothing stirred within.  Lying among
 the cloven  tracks and  defacation, however, was  a flattened  pile of 
 leaves--  Kathryn's  bed.  The  stench   from  inside  made  Sod  gag.
 Confirming their  worst fears, it  seemed that Kathryn,  the monstrous 
 sow which  had rampaged through  Gorod, was now  living in the  hut of 
 Baba Yaga.  Signs of the  monstrous  sow were everywhere. Most  of the
 hut's interior  was badly  battered and  decayed. Scattered  debris on 
 the ground may  have once stood for a chair.  Few furnishings remained
 distinguishable. In  the far corner,  though, near the bed  of leaves, 
 stood a  dark and  mouldering chest.  The brass  straps and  brads had 
 long  since   turned  green  and  disintegrated   from  the  moisture.
 Banewood  saw the  chest  and  could not  restrain  his curiosity.  He 
 entered  the hut  and opened  the chest.  Most of  the wood  was badly 
 decayed, and  it fell apart when  it was disturbed. Inside  the chest, 
 however, the  contents were fairly well  preserved. Banewood unwrapped
 a  book-sized,  oilskin-covered  bundle  which was  on  top  of  other 
 items. It was a book.
     "I don't believe this," whispered Banewood in awe. 
     "Don't  believe  what,"  said  Sod, not  believing  that  Banewood
 dared to utter a sound in the lair of Kathryn.
     "It looks like  Baba Yaga's book of spells. I  can't make out some 
 of the writing;  it's an old script.  This is one of the  books my old
 master  told me  about. It  contains the  ancient secrets  of sorcery. 
 This is an unbelievable discovery."
     "Well, pack  up your  discovery and  let's get  out of  here. This 
 place makes  me nervous," said  Sod. His hands  began to sweat  and he
 could feel the weight of his sword sliding through.
     Banewood hastily  rewrapped the  package and  stuffed it  into his 
 own sack.  On an  impulse, he  picked up  another small  bundle, which 
 upon  inspection,   contained  what  looked  like   a  Shaman's  smoke
 mixture. Banewood  lashed the sack to  his belt and the  two retreated 
 back into the daylight. 
     When  Banewood  and  Sod  stepped   outside,  they  saw  that  the
 scraggly raven  had returned.  Seeing the  plowman and  his companion, 
 it  cried out  in a  raucous frenzy.  Through the  cacophony, Sod  and
 Banewood  heard another  sound: a  terrifying squealing  and trampling
 sound. Towering  above the  distant grass was  a massive  black shape.
 Thin, gray hair  lay matted on its back and  around it's notched ears. 
 It was a  wonder that such a large beast  could have existed unnoticed
 for so  many years,  but it  is true: The  forest hides  many secrets. 
 Clouds  and  fumes  emanated  from around  the  creature's  snout.  It
 reared its head  up and Banewood and  Sod could see a  pair of blazing 
 red eyes. 
     "It's Kathryn," thought Sod.
     "It's Baba Yaga," thought Banewood.
     "We're in trouble," said the two aloud. 
     Sod was  possessed by a grave  doubt as to his  future being. This 
 whole  scene was  a nightmare  and he  wished he  could wake  up. What 
 finally woke Sod up  was the one thing which he  had most feared. Like 
 a fish,  Wolksmert's handle  slid through the  gripped fingers  of the
 plowman and fell to  the ground. When Sod reached to  pick it back up,
 it  immediately  slid out  of  his  grasp.  Kathryn was  charging  and 
 spewing  her  fiery  froth.  Banewood  loosed a  Ludki  arrow  at  the 
 charging Kathryn,  but it glanced off  of the sow's forehead.  Sod was
 distraught, to say the least. His sword would not remain in his hand. 
     Banewood,  seeing Sod's  plight, ran  forward and  shouted at  the
 charging  Kathryn. A  spray of  singeing  fire told  Banewood that  he 
 succeeded  in getting  her  attention. He  ran around  the  hut in  an 
 attempt  to lead  Kathryn away  from Sod,  who was  still pathetically 
 trying  to grip  his  sword.  A bit  of  Kathryn's  breath caught  the
 corner  of  Baba Yaga's  hut  and  ignited the  tinder-dry  structure.
 Evidently,  however,  Kathryn's  fiery  froth  had  a  limit,  for  it 
 quickly  decreased in  range and  intensity to  the point  of being  a
 caustic dribble.  Banewood took  advantage of  this and  became bolder
 in his  taunts. He  loosed a few  Ludki arrows at  the enraged  sow in
 order to  further torment her. It  worked. Banewood saw a  nearby tree 
 that  he thought  could hold  his weight.  He ran  to it  and limberly 
 pulled  himself  up  the  trunk.   He  had  previously  discarded  his
 backpack and other  paraphernalia, but he neglected to  untie the tiny
 old bag  which held  the ancient  smoking mixture.  It ripped  open as 
 Banewood shinned up  the trunk, spilling its contents  around the base 
 of the tree.
     Kathryn was  not an ignorant  sow. She saw this  grand opportunity 
 to harvest  the tree's single  fruit: Banewood. She ran  headlong into
 the sturdy  trunk of the  tree and splintered  part of the  trunk. She 
 tore  at the  ground around  the tree  with her  hooves and  layed her 
 forehead against  the trunk in an  attempt to batter it  down. Kathryn 
 kicked up a  cloud of the ancient herbal mixture  torn from Banewood's
 belt. Her two  wide nostrils inhaled part of the  cloud and Kathryn no
 longer felt  any pain.  Hitting the  tree with her  head was  easy; in 
 fact, it was fun.
     Sod saw  the impending danger that  Banewood was in. It  was Sod's 
 fault,  he  thought, that  Banewood  even  came  on this  journey.  He
 couldn't let him  die. Sod had decided  to go into this  quest, and by 
 his life,  he would  take it to  its completion. He  picked up  a rock
 and  threw it  squarely at  Kathryn's rear.  Kathryn turned  about and
 faced Sod.  He taunted her with  insults to her genealogy.  Sod hardly
 noticed  that  he now  gripped  Wolksmert  firmly  in both  hands.  He
 spaced his legs, hurled another insult and waited.
     The smoking mixture  continued to work on Kathryn's  brain. It had
 a strange,  numbing sensation. Colors  burst before her  crimson eyes. 
 Directly in  front of her stood  a tattered and sweaty  plowman-- easy
 prey  and a  quick  lunch.  Suddenly, though,  she  was  faced by  two
 plowman--  no problem--  then a  third. Three  Sod's stood  before the
 eyes  of  an  enraged  and   disoriented  sow.  Baba  Yaga's  mixture, 
 whatever  it was,  buzzed around  in Kathryn's  head like  a swarm  of 
 happy bees. Kathryn  decided that the plowman on the  left, Sod number
 three, was  the real one.  It didn't  really matter; she  could always 
 come back  and finish off the  other two. She charged  with full fury. 
 Distance  between  the two  retreated  with  the sound  of  thundering
 cloven hooves.  Sod number two,  the one  in the middle,  didn't quite 
 understand why Kathryn  was veering so much to his  right. No matter-- 
 Wolksmert, guided  by the  plowman's strong arm,  swung with  the ease 
 of a baton but crashed with the weight of a boulder.
     Blood poured from  Kathryn's head. Blood ran to the  ground in red 
 rivers and stained  the dusty feet of the plowman.  Blood dripped from
 the shining blade of Wolksmert. 
     Kathryn was dead. 
     It  was several  minutes before  either Sod  or Banewood  moved or 
 said anything.  Sod stood alone with  his sword dripping blood  to the 
 ground. Banewood shouted from the tree. 
     "You killed her. I can't believe that it happened so quickly."
     "Quickly?" Sod thought hours passed during Kathryn's charge.
     "I owe you my life," said Banewood. "How can I ever repay you?"
     "Don't worry,"  said Sod, who smiled  for the first time.  "It all 
 comes out in the wash." 
     Without having  to discuss  their next step.  The two  quietly and
 deliberately set  about gathering  dried brush and  grass for  a fire.
 It took  nearly an hour  to amass the giant  pyre, but it  was finally
 built  and  easily   set  aflame  from  the  embers   of  Baba  Yaga's
 smoldering hut. The  evening light was brightened by  the burning pile 
 of brush.  A night bird  sang vespers,  and the wind  whispered softly 
 over the plains, gently fanning the blaze.
