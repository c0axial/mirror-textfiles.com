     Well,  folks,  here's the  second  batch  of Dargon  stories.  The
 response  to the  first ish  was,  as we  downeasterners say,  "wicked
 massive". In  fact, when I told  one reader that my  head was swelling 
 and  that I'd  start charging  for FSFnet,  he came  back saying  that
 he'd  pay for  it! Well,  for  now we'll  just keep  cranking out  the 
 stuff for free, but I won't refuse contributions...
     I'd  like to  thank Chris  Condon for  keeping FSFnet  in BITLIST, 
 and all the  new readers who responded  to BITLIST or the  note I sent 
 out  last month.  Readership  is better  than ever,  but  we all  know
 there are more  people out there who would be  interested in this sort 
 of  fanzine,  so spread  the  word,  send  issues around,  and  coerce
 people if necessary to make them sign up! The more the merrier, right? 
     Finally, for  all you back-issue  freaks, FSFNET INDEX, a  list of
 back  issues and  their contents  is available  from mine  truly. Feel
 free  to ask  for it,  and  any back  issues, but  remember that  such
 requests often go  several weeks before being  fulfilled, since issues 
 before 4-1 are kept on magnetic tape in my living room. 
     Well, that's  all the news  from the north,  on to the  two newest 
 Dargon stories...

                               Deep Trouble
     The day was  sunlit, although there were still clouds  in the sky, 
 and rain  still came down occasionally.  The wind was no  longer cold,
 as it  had been, though,  so Levy and  Mattan Barel shed  their cloaks
 as they  passed through the great  wooden gates of Dargon.  All around
 them men carried  heavy crates and barrels of food  and goods, setting 
 up their booths for the Festival.
     Levy and  Mattan made their  way through  the streets to  the home
 of Cavendish  the Scribe. Levy  had spent  a few years  with Cavendish 
 learning  several  scholarly  languages,  and  every  year,  when  the 
 Festival came,  Levy made  it a point  to spend a  few days  in Dargon 
 with his teacher and friend.
     When  they  arrived,  Cavendish's   son  Dale  made  their  horses 
 comfortable  while Cavendish  personally saw  to the  comforts of  his
 guests.  After  several  hours  of  "catching up"  on  old  times  and
 equally  generous  amounts  of  food  and  good  beer,  the  household
 settled down for the night.
     Levy  was  jolted  out of  a  sound  rest  by  the sound  of  loud
 knocking on the  outside doors. As he rolled over,  he heard Cavendish
 making  his way  to  the door,  unbolting it  and  greeting his  early
 morning guests. 
     "We would speak with Levy Barel. We know he is lodging here."
     The  voice  was  not  harsh,   but  there  was  no  mistaking  the
 authority  behind  it. By  the  time  Cavendish  reached the  door  to
 Levy's room,  both Levy and  Mattan were  in their trousers.  Levy saw 
 the apprehension in Cavendish's eyes as he stepped into the room.
     "There are some men here to see you. Lord's Guards."
     Levy stepped  into his boots  and walked  out into the  main room,
 followed by  Mattan. As he  did he  breathed a quick  prayer. Standing 
 in  the doorway  were three  large men,  all wearing  swords at  their 
 sides, undrawn. Levy approached them. 
     "How  can I  help  you?"  Levy's tone  was  carefully chosen,  not
 arrogant, but not fearful either. 
     "Lord Dargon wishes  to see you. Immediately."  Although there was
 no threat in the  man's voice, it was obvious that  he would not leave
 without Levy.
     While taking  in the situation,  Levy noticed his  brother's face.
 It  had a  curious expression  on  it, as  if  he were  sizing up  the
 opposition, a  look Levy  knew well.  The three  guards, on  the other
 hand, anxiously watched Levy and Mattan. Levy turned to his brother. 
     "I'll go with  them. It's all right." Levy knew  that Mattan could
 and would  stop these  men from  taking him against  his will.  It was
 always best to play things easy, though. 
     Levy  grabbed his  cloak  and  stepped outside  to  where the  men 
 waited  with  four  horses.  The   group  rode  silently  through  the
 sleeping  city  to  the  central  keep.  There  they  dismounted,  and
 entered. Please  let me  see the  outside of  this castle  again, Levy 
 breathed,  uncertain. Once  inside,  the guard  Levy  had spoken  with 
 turned to the other guards.
     "You may return to your posts."
     As the  two guards saluted, and  turned to leave, the  third guard
 turned towards Levy. 
     "Follow me. My Lord awaits."
     They  made their  way  into  the center  of  the  keep, which  was
 larger than any  Levy had been in,  and up to the top  level. Levy was
 surprised to  note that  every one they  met saluted  deferentially to 
 his guide, no matter  how high their rank. Soon, they  came to a short
 hallway,  in the  center  of which  was  a door  with  guards on  both
 sides.  When they  reached  the  door, the  two  guards blocked  their 
 entry until the guide surrendered his sword.
     Once  inside  Levy immediately  recognized  Lord  Dargon, a  young
 man, straight  and honest-looking. The  Lord looked up almost  as soon 
 as they stepped in. 
     "Bartol. You found him. Well done."
     "Thank you, My Lord." 
     "Bartol is  my bard.  He sings  for me when  I hold  public court.
 What most people  don't know is that  he is also second  in command of 
 my personal bodyguard, and one of my most valuable spies." 
     "Concerned citizens, Sire." The reply was accompanied with a grin.
     "Forgive  me. Concerned  citizens. I  would  make him  ruler of  a 
 third of  my lands if it  weren't for the  fact that then he  would be
 of no use to me anymore."
     Levy  infered from  their talk  that this  was to  be an  informal 
 audience. Therefore, he got to the point as soon as possible. 
     "How can I be of assistance to you, Lord Dargon?"
     "Allow me  to explain; it  is a short tale.  I must, as  all lords
 in this  country must,  pay tithes  to Baranur.  Unlike most  lords, I 
 have  always paid  them  promptly, and  without  grudging. This  year,
 however, a problem  has arisen. My financial adviser  died this spring
 of old  age and  left his eldest  son, whom he  had been  training, in 
 his position. One of  the first things his son did was  to, how did he
 say it,  invest the tithe money  overseas. It really was  a good idea.
 For every  piece of  gold I  sent over, two  have come  back. Further,
 because of  their increased trade  with us,  several of our  long time 
 enemies  would  not  dare  invade  us, for  fear  of  loosing  a  good 
 customer.The  only  problem  arose   when  the  tithe  collector  from
 Baranur came. The ship  carrying the tithe was late, so  we had to put
 him off  for two weeks.  He was not happy.  When the ship  finally did
 arrive,  it arrived  during  a storm,  and sank  just  outside of  the 
 harbor. The tithe  collector grew suspicious, and  returned to Baranur
 despite  anything I  could  do.  Now, we  don't  have  enough gold  in 
 Dargon to pay the tithe, and Baranur has sent me this."
     Lord  Dargon handed  Levy a  scroll, which  he opened.  Out of  it
 rolled a dead scorpion. With shaking hands Levy read the scroll. 
     "Be it known!  The hand of Baranur is long  and heavy! Tithes must
 be paid in  full by the full  moon, or the next messenger  will not be 
 a dead one!" 
     Levy looked up at Lord Dargon.
     "The moon is full tonight." 
     "Yes, but  the letter did  not arrive until yesterday.  Baranur is 
 impatient, but not  unrealistic. It would take two days  for the money 
 just to  reach Baranur. No,  we have until the  next full moon  to pay
 the tithe."
     "I see. Just what part do I play in this little game, Lord Dargon?"
     "I am  trying to raise the  money by other means.  There is little
 hope of doing  it, but perhaps we  could buy some time  with a partial
 payment. What  I want  you to  do is raise  that ship.  I know  of the
 legends concerning  the first  Barel, how  he saved  this land  by his 
 engineering  skills. I  also know  that you  follow in  his footsteps. 
 Now I  am hiring you to  help me. Raise  that ship. and you  will walk
 away with a tithe of it's holdings."
     Levy paused.
     "And if I don't?"
     Lord Dargon looked Levy straight in the eye.
     "I  will not  threaten a  guest to  my city,  nor will  I threaten 
 someone I wish to  hire. But I will not take no for  an answer. And if
 you don't raise the  ship in time, you and your  brother  will be here 
 in the city when Baranur comes to claim it's due."

     Dawn  found Mattan  Barel  and Cavendish  asleep  in chairs,  with 
 half empty  cups of strong  herb tea in front  of them. They  had been
 waiting a long  time for Levy to  come back. They awoke  and sprang to
 their feet when Levy opened the door and stepped in.
     "What happened? Where  have you been? What did  they want?" Mattan
 was  relieved to  see his  older  brother in  one piece,  but now  his 
 curiosity was aroused.
     "It seems I'm not  going to get to see much  of the Festival after 
 all.  Lord Dargon  has  a minor  engineering miracle  he  wants me  to
 perform for him." 
     Cavendish and Mattan  sat back down as Levy removed  his cloak and 
 took a  free chair. Cavendish  leaned forward  with a knowing  look on
 his face. 
     "Was it about the ship that sank?" 
     "I'm not  allowed to tell  any more than what  I have, but  I will
 say  he's  willing to  pay  me  very well.  You  might  say, a  lord's 
 ransom. And he  won't take no for an answer."  Levy sat back, grinning
 at  the expression  on  Cavendish's face.  "I would  ask  you not  let
 anyone know  of this. Not  even your family.  Mattan, I may  need your 
 help later.  For now, though, you  can have your fun  at the Festival.
 And  don't worry  about  saving enough  money for  the  trip home.  We 
 won't  be needing  to  worry about  that." One  way  or another,  Levy 
 added, as a silent afterthought. 
     After  breakfast, Levy  rode across  the city  to the  docks. Once 
 there he  rode up  to the  largest ship he  could find.  Naturally, it 
 was  one of  the Lord's  own. It  was a  trading vessel,  the Heavenly 
 Walls.  Levy tied  up his  horse, and  strode on  board. He  found the 
 captain, one  John Largo, directing the  loading of the first  part of 
 his cargo. Levy approached him.
     "I really  hate to say this,  but I'm afraid you're  going to have
 to unload that cargo."
     Largo,  and everyone  else who  heard, froze.  They all  turned to 
 look at Levy. There  was a long pause. Largo looked  around at all his 
 men, then back to Levy.
     "And why would that be? Who are you to be telling me these things?"
     Levy pulled his  hand from where he had been  concealing it in his
 cloak. He held it up, palm in. 
     "Who am I? I'm the man who wears this ring."
     Captain Largo looked  at the ring. His eyes sprang  wide open, and 
 he immediately doffed his hat and dropped to one knee. 
     "Please! Pardon  me! I had  no idea!" He  turned to the  crew. "He 
 wears Lord Dargon's ring!" 
     The  entire crew  immediately  dropped what  they  were doing  and 
 presented a  hasty salute. Levy  had not asked  for the ring,  but now
 he was  glad it  had been given.  He realized now  that it  would make 
 things much  easier, for  while he wore  it, he had,  for many  if not
 all intents and purposes, as much authority as Lord Dargon himself. 
     "Rise. Lord  Dargon has asked that  I use this vessel.  He thought 
 it to  be the  best one for  my needs,  and my needs  are going  to be 
 great. Can  you fulfil them,  captain?" Levy knew  that no man  in the 
 captain's position could allow his competency to be so questioned.
     "Name it,  and we will  have it done  yesterday!" The crew  gave a 
 shout, and when  Levy smiled and motioned for the  captain to lead the 
 way to the cabin, they broke into cheering.

     A week later Levy  stood on the deck of the  ship, frowning at the 
 grey  waves. Voices  behind  him  drew his  attention.  He turned  and
 walked  across the  deck to  where three  seamen were  pulling a  drag
 rope on  deck One  of the  men stopped,  and leaned  over the  side. A
 moment  later  he straightened  up,  pulling  a  diver on  deck.  Levy
 approached the diver.
     "What can you see down there?"
     "Nothing. The  ship is down there,  but we can't get  close enough 
 to see  it. It's  too deep, and  the water's too  cold, and  there are 
 too many sharks." 
     "What about  that sack I gave  you? The one with  the shark poison 
 in it."
     The man gave a wry smile.
     "A shark made  a pass at me,  and I dropped it.  The shark doubled 
 back, and ate it." 
     Levy  vented a  sigh, and  turned back  to the  cabin, He  stepped
 inside,  grateful  to be  in  out  of the  cold  wind.  The cabin  was 
 surprisingly  warm, heated  by a  large cooking  stove. The  cabin was 
 the  living  quarters for  the  whole  crew.  Two men  were  presently 
 playing dice  in the  far corner. One  had had his  leg broken  when a 
 drag line  had snapped and thrown  him against some tackle.  The other 
 was a diver who had been mauled by a shark. 
     The rest  of the  crew was  on deck, busily  trying either  to put
 off marker  buoys to mark  the wreck, or  helping the divers  in their
 attempts to  reach the  wreck. So  far the only  success had  been the
 initial find  of the ship,   and even that  had taken three  days. The 
 grab lines had not  been able to haul anything up.  No divers had been
 able  to reach  the  wreck, and  at  least one  other  diver had  been
 injured by  the sharks, although  not severely. The captain  had asked 
 to be  allowed to  take the injured  men back to  shore, and  Levy had 
 agreed.  He was  secretly glad,  as he  needed time  to plan  his next
 move.  He had  hoped that  the  divers he  had found  at the  Festival 
 would help,  but they  were foiled  by the deep,  the dark,  the cold,
 and  the sharks.  He  had  spent much  time  petitioning  his God  for 
 another idea, but none had come yet. 
     Three days later  Levy was back at the wreck,  only this time with
 two ships. The  first was the Heavenly Walls. The  other was a trader,
 the Green  Squid. It's captain  was a  man called Itoh  Carran Tchock. 
 They  were the  largest  ships available,  and they  had  on deck  the 
 largest winches  Levy could find,  ones like  those used to  raise the
 drawbridge  leading into  Dargon Keep.  At  the moment  the two  ships 
 were about  two hundred feet apart  with a thick hawser  slung between 
 them.  At an  order from  Levy, the  line was  played out,  until Levy 
 figured that enough  had been let out  that it was now  resting on the 
 bottom. Levy  then motioned to  Capt. Largo.  He bellowed an  order to 
 his  men, and  the  ship started  moving. He  then  motioned to  Capt.
 Tchock on the other  ship, and it moved forward as  well. As the ships
 moved through  the water, the  hawser followed. Occasionally  it would
 grow taut, only  to slacken as the obstacle was  overcome. Then, after
 about  half a  minute, it  grew  taut and  did not  relax. Both  ships 
 stopped. Levy then turned to Capt. Largo. 
     "Launch the boat!" 
     Five men lowered  the ship's boat into the water  and climbed into
 it.  Another hawser  was  passed to  them, and  they  started for  the
 Green Squid.  When they  reached it,  the line was  passed up  to it's
 crew, who  made it  fast to  the winch  on board.  The boat  crew then 
 rowed back towards  their ship. They stopped half way,  and fished the 
 hawser out  of the  water. Then,  as Levy watched,  more line  was let 
 out.  The  boat rowed  forward,  pulling  the  hawser out,  until  the 
 weight of the  extended line was ready to swamp  the little boat. Then 
 the crew dropped  the line, which disappeared  underwater. Capt. Largo 
 turned to  Levy, but  Levy just  stood there,  watching. After  a long 
 moment, Levy turned to Largo. 
     "It should be  down there by now. Make it  fast, and start pulling
 it in."
     The crew  scrambled to fulfil  the command. The line  was attached 
 to the  winch as  the first  was, and  then teams  started laboriously
 turning the spool.  Onboard the other ship the crew  did the same. The 
 two  ships  drifted together.  As  soon  as  a  line could  be  tossed 
 across, the  two ships were  drawn together. Wooden beams  were placed 
 across  the gap  between  the  ships, and  lashed  to  the two  decks,
 binding the two ships together solidly. 
     Levy's  plan was  easy to  understand. It  had come  to him  as he 
 stood on the  pier and watched the waves pushing  anchor lines around. 
 He didn't  know if it  was divinely inspired,  but it was  better than
 no idea. The  first hawser had been dragged along  the bottom until it 
 had caught  on the  bow of  the sunken  ship. A  second had  then been
 sunk around  the stern of  the wreck. The  ships had then  been lashed 
 together, so  that they could  try to winch  the wreck to  the surface
 without worrying about capsizing. 
     All  through the  day the  crews turned  the big  spools. Inch  by 
 inch  the wet  rope  wound around  the  drums. Levy  did  not plan  to 
 totally raise the  ship, only get it  high enough so that  it could be
 hauled to shallow water. 
     As the sun  drew towards the horizon, the wind  picked up. With it 
 came rougher seas.  Levy told the captain to start  to make for shore.
 The men who  were not cranking the winches raised  the sails. They had
 gotten them  half up  when  the two  ships lurched. The  beams between 
 the two  ships snapped,  and both  ships rose  suddenly higher  in the
 water. Levy fell  to the deck, as  did just about everyone.  He got up
 and ran to  the winch. He didn't  even need to ask  what had happened. 
 Both cables were limp.
     Levy had  been there for only  a moment when both  ships shuddered
 again. This time  the ships rolled away from each  other. One man fell 
 overboard. The  air was filled with  horrible thumps as each  ship was 
 struck  several times.  When things  quieted down,  both crews  ran to 
 the side  of the  ship, and  were astonished  to see  the man  who had 
 fallen over standing, apparently on top of the water. 
     It didn't take  long for Levy to realize that  the sunken ship had
 surfaced,  and was  now floating  on  it's own.  It wasn't  for a  few 
 minutes that  Levy realized that the  ship was now in  two pieces, the
 stern and  the bow. After  that it was only  a moment before  the real
 impact  of what  had happened  hit him.  The reason  the wreck  hadn't 
 floated before was  that it was weighted down with  it's golden cargo.
 If it  floated now, it  was only because the  gold had all  poured out
 when the ship had broken in half.

     Levy stood  in an  open field.  Three weeks  ago the  Festival had 
 started in  Dargon, and three days  ago the sunken ship  had broken in
 half as  Levy and the  crew of the Heavenly  Walls had tried  to raise 
 it. Since  then an  effort had been  made to dredge  the gold  off the 
 sea floor,  but to no avail.  The bottom was rough  and craggy, unlike
 the smooth  floor of  the harbor.  Attempts to dive  down to  the gold
 had almost gotten a diver eaten. 
     Levy looked around  him. The sun was hot, a  welcome change to the 
 cool  sea air.  Levy had  decided  to take  a break  and practice  the
 archery  his young  twin brother   had  taught him.  He had  set up  a 
 target  in the  center of  the grassy  field, and  had walked  back to
 where  his bow  lay. Now  he  bent and  picked  it up,  along with  an 
 arrow. He had only brought three, as Mattan had wanted to go hunting.
     As Levy stood there  he thought. Where in the world  am I going to 
 come up  with a  way to  raise that  ship? In  this field?  He laughed
 quietly at  that thought. I'll never  be able to find  the solution to 
 this problem. It'll  take a miracle. And that wouldn't  be a bad idea,
 he concluded, aiming that last thought skyward. 
     He raised  the bow and  shot. The arrow  struck the target  at the
 base. He  drew and  fired again. This  time he hit  to one  side. Once 
 more  he  shot. The  arrow  struck  the very  top  of  the target  and
 glanced off in high, arching flight.
     Levy groaned. His  aim this morning certainly  wasn't inspired. He
 dropped  the bow  and jogged  out to  where he  thought the  arrow had 
 landed. Past  the target  he found  a small stream,  and a  tiny pool,
 and his arrow,  sticking out of the  water in the center  of the pool. 
 Levy  squatted on  the  edge  of the  pool,  staring  at the  brightly
 colored bolt  as it pointed  upward, unwilling  to muddy the  water by 
 wading in  to retrieve the  shaft. As he  sat there a  movement caught 
 his  attention. A  spider  scurried along  the edge  of  the pool.  It 
 reached a  fallen branch that extended  out into the pool,  and turned
 out along it.
     Be careful,  little spider,  or you'll get  wet, Levy  thought. To 
 his  surprise, the  spider  turned  down a  side  branch, and  crawled
 right under the water. 
     Levy  leaned   closer.  He  had   heard  of  spiders   that  lived 
 underwater,  but he  had  never  seen one.  He  watched  as the  small 
 creature clung to  the twig, a bubble of air  cloaking its  abdomen in 
 silver. As he  watched the spider, another movement caught  his eye. A 
 fish,  rather  large for  such  a  small  pool,  swam by.  The  spider 
 paused, and as it  did the fish saw it. With a  movement of it's tail,
 the fish  darted after  the spider.  Before the  fish could  reach it,
 however, the spider  squeezed between two twigs. The  fish bumped it's 
 snout  against the  twigs, unable  to  reach the  tasty morsel  behind
 them. It hung there for a moment, then swam off, puzzled.
     Fooled  him, you  did, Levy  thought, safe  in your  little wooden 
 cage. Then Levy stiffened. Cage! 

     Three days later  Levy was once again on the  deck of the Heavenly
 Walls, looking  at the  red marker  buoys bobbing  in the  water. This 
 time he  had brought  something else  along. It had  once hung  from a
 gibbet, holding a  criminal's body. Now it hung from  a derrick, ready 
 to be  swung over  the side  of the ship.  It was  a large  iron cage,
 just big  enough for  a man  to stand  in. A  large, clear  glass jar,
 which Levy  had managed to  talk the  local glass blower  into making,
 was wedged into  the top. While the crew watched,  Levy climbed in and 
 shut the  door. He had  decided that he  wasn't going to  risk someone
 else's life  on one  of his ideas  unless he was  willing to  risk his
 own life first. He motioned for Captain Largo to come near.
     "When  I want  up, I'll  pull the  rope. I'm  no diver,  and there 
 isn't going to much air in this thing." 
     Captain Largo nodded,  and steadied the cage as his  men swung the 
 derrick around. Levy  hung there a moment, then the  cage dropped into 
 the water. 
     The  shock of  the water  was muted  by the  woolen clothing  Levy
 wore, but  it was  still great. He  was overjoyed to  see how  well he
 could see  through the glass. The  sea around him was  easily visible.
 He sank down  quickly, the men above allowing the  winch to run almost 
 free. Soon  the second part of  Levy's idea was tested.  A large shape
 swam  up.  Levy didn't  see  it  until  it  circled around  the  cage. 
 Immediately Levy  tensed, and  immediately the  great fish  sensed his 
 nervousness. The  shark turned  toward Levy, and  with a  audible snap 
 of it's tail  it slammed into the  cage. Levy and the  cage swung like
 a pendulum,  but the cage  held firm. Just as  the fish had  done, the
 shark hung there for a moment, then swam off in search of softer game.
     Levy watched it  for a moment, and  then he was at  the bottom. He 
 scraped along a rock  wall for a few seconds, and  then thudded into a 
 surprisingly flat bottom.  The dark was too thick to  see through now, 
 so Levy  opened a  pouch at  his side,  and pulled  out a  small glass
 jar. Inside  was some foxfire he  had gathered before setting  out. It 
 glowed greenly in  the gloom. By it's light Levy  could see a metallic 
 glint from  the seabed. Reaching  through the  bars of the  cage, Levy
 grabbed something  hard and  heavy. It  was a  gold coin.  Joy flooded 
 Levy's mind. He  silently shouted praise, his mind singing.  He was so 
 happy  at his  success that  he  stared at  the coin  until his  lungs
 started burning,  and he realized  that the air  in the jar  was going
 bad. He reached up, and yanked the cord.

     Later that day  Levy stood at the bow of  the Heavenly Walls. Down 
 below divers  were scooping gold from  the ocean mud. Levy's  mind was
 not there though.  He looked out across the waves.  He was thinking of 
 what had  happened down  at the  bottom of  the sea.  Just as  the men
 above started  pulling him up,  Levy slipped  his jar of  foxfire back
 in it's pouch.  But the sea around  him stayed lit. He  looked up, and 
 almost stopped  breathing, for  staring right at  him were  two large, 
 glowing eyes. As the cage rose, the eyes disappeared in the gloom.
     For all  of his life, Levy  had always wondered at  the marvels of 
 this great planet,  this marvelous creation. Yet he  now realized that
 he had  only seen a  tiny part. There  were other lands,  other worlds
 within the  world. He knew  now that he  would not have  seen anything 
 if he did not take the time, and look deeper.

                          The Essence of Ur-Baal
     Banewood  smelled  incense  when he  entered  Aardvard  Factotum's
 home.  As his  eyes  became  accustomed to  the  darkness, he  noticed 
 conspicuous  details   of  wealth:  polished  wooden   furniture  from 
 Magnus;  a  paved  floor  topped  with woven  grass  mats;  and  thick 
 tapestries,  imported from  distant  Baranur, adorned  the walls.  The 
 richness  of  the furnishings  attested  to  Factotum's success  as  a 
 local  healer  and  surgeon  --  a  barber,  in  local  parlance.  The
 peasants,  those  who could  afford  his  services, paid  dearly  with 
 their  cattle, which  augmented what  was already  one of  the largest 
 herds in the  realm. Those who were rich, however,  had rich diseases, 
 and they  paid in  gold for their  treatment, preferably  Baranur gold 
 marks. Many of them. 
     But  Banewood wasn't  looking  for healing.  And  though he  could 
 probably  use  a different  type  of  barber,  he  hadn't come  for  a 
 surgical  consultation.  He  was  looking for  magic  and  for  anyone
 willing to trade magic spells and potions.
     When he  had first  arrived at Dargon,  Banewood milled  about the 
 docks  and  warehouses,  casting   about  for  information  among  the 
 sailors, longshoremen  and merchants. It  didn't take long.  Beneath a 
 red and white  canopy, a soup vendor called Simon  had volunteered the
 name of  Aardvard Factotum, the  physician, in barter for  some exotic
 seasonings   brought   by  Banewood.   This   was   not  an   age   of 
 specialization --  a physician,  especially one  trained by  an elder,
 also dabbled in sorcery. 
     The apprentice shaman,  ever on the search for new  spells and new
 knowledge,  eagerly   sought  the  physician's  house   and  gave  his 
 credentials  to  a  haughty  secretary. After  about  ten  minutes  --
 Aardvard didn't  wish to  appear eager --  the secretary  returned and 
 ushered Banewood into Factotum's richly appointed office. 
     "Hansen, go  take a  walk and  leave us  alone," said  Aardvard to 
 his secretary.  Hansen demurred  at the order  to leave  his employer,
 but he left obediently. 
     "Who's your  instructor?" asked Aardvard. From  behind thick lids,
 his reddened  eyes peered at  the dusty Shaman.  He drew a  heavy puff
 from a pipe. The pipe, made of whale ivory scrimshaw, was very rare.
     "Ostap of Gorod," responded Banewood.
     "Never heard  of him," said the  physician. He stifled a  yawn. "I
 presume you came here with something on your mind." 
     Banewood  shifted his  weight;  he'd  been on  his  feet all  day.
 "Yes.  I'm a  stranger to  the  kingdom of  Baranur, having  journeyed
 through the forest from the east. 
     "More  to this  bumpkin than  meets  the eye,"  mused Aardvard  to
 himself.  The  eastern forests  seldom  admitted  strangers. Ones  who 
 passed that way may, indeed, have something to offer. "Go on..."
     Banewood  told Aardvard  little of  his  adventure at  the hut  of 
 Baba Yaga or  of his meeting with  the little people who  lived in the 
 dark  forest which  surrounded Gorod,  his  home. Nor  did he  mention 
 Baba Yaga's book  of spells. Baba Yaga was an  evil sorceress who died 
 centuries  ago in  the  dark  forest. Last  summer,  Banewood and  his
 companion,  Sod the  plowman,  journeyed through  the  dark forest  to 
 slay  Kathryn,   a  monstrous   sow  believed  by   many  to   be  the 
 reincarnation  of  Baba  Yaga.  Banewood found  Baba  Yaga's  book  of 
 spells within the  ruins of her moldering hut. Books  of any sort were 
 rare commodities  in this dim  age, and a  book of sorcery  was beyond
 price  --  more  than  one's life,  at  least.  Banewood  concentrated
 instead  on his  quest for  the greater  knowledge, his  euphemism for 
 the shaman's art. 
     Factotum was  amused. Never before  had someone sought him  out to 
 exchange spells and potions. 
     "Let's play  with this  one a bit,"  Factotum thought  to himself.
 "Well, shaman, show me  what you can do, and I'll see  what I may have 
 to offer  you... But I'm sorry,  I'm forgetting my manners,  aren't I?
 Please sit and ease your feet." 
     Banewood nodded  in thanks. Picking a  stool, he sat down  and did 
 little  to  suppress a  weary  sigh.  He  reached  into his  sack  and 
 produced a wooden  rod. He waved the  rod over a small  table in front 
 of him,  muttered a  few words and  caused the table  to rise  about a
 foot into  the air. It  floated about for  a moment and  then abruptly 
 settled back to earth. 
     Aardvard  shrugged. "I'm  afraid the  table is  the only  thing to 
 get a  rise from that old  trick," he said with  smugness. Thinking to
 impress Banewood,  he reached for a  nearby urn and showed  the shaman 
 that it  was empty. Aardvard covered  the urn with a  fine cloth which
 he pulled from  a pocket in his  robe. He produced his  own wooden rod 
 and waved it  over the container. With slight flourish,  he produced a 
 little  white   squat-hen,  your   typical  rabbit.  He   offered  the
 squat-hen to Banewood. "Something for your dinner, perhaps?"
     Banewood smirked. "Is  that all you can do?  Squat-hen tricks?" He 
 reached  again into  his  bag and  this  time pulled  out  one of  his 
 favorites; it  was a narrow vial  filled with a dark  green liquid. He 
 sipped once  from the vial and  placed it back in  his pouch. Banewood
 closed his eyes as if resting and appeared to go to sleep. 
     "Now what?" wondered the physician.
     Several  minutes  went by.  However,  just  as the  physician  was 
 thinking of  offering Banewood a cup  of tea or some  other stimulant, 
 a  raven flew  up to  the  open window  and  perched on  the sill.  It
 looked sideways  at Aardvard, which is  the way birds often  look when 
 gazing directly at you, and croaked "Aar-vard! Aar-vard!" 
     "Is  that  all you  can  do?  Bird imitations?"  scoffed  Aardvard
 Factotum.  But  the physician  had  never  seen  this bit  of  sorcery
 before. "Hmm... What else can you do with that potion?" He asked. 
     Once  again,  Banewood closed  his  eyes  and appeared  to  sleep. 
 After  about  a minute,  Banewood  stirred;  he  opened his  eyes  and 
 beamed a knowing smile at Aardvard.
     "You have  twelve hundred  gold marks  hidden behind  your hearth. 
 Don't you trust the banks in Baranur?" Banewood asked.
     Factotum  controlled  an  urge  to  jump  out  of  his  chair  and
 throttle  Banewood. "You  can do  that  with your  potion?" he  asked.
 "What is it?" 
     Banewood replied  "It's the Essence  of Ur-Baal. It sets  the mind
 free of the body."
     "Oh!  I've got  to  try  this essence.  Let  me  try it,  please?"
 begged Factotum, going down a bit in Banewood's estimation.
     "No,  I  don't   think  so,"  replied  Banewood.   "It's  kind  of 
 dangerous if  you don't  know what  you're doing;  you can  easily get
 lost and not find your way back to your body."
     "I've never been lost a day in my life," retorted Aardvard.
     "You mean you've used the essence of Ur-Baal before?" 
     "Yeah, sure. A long time ago." Aardvard lied. 
     "Well, in  that case..."  Banewood looked pensive, Aardvard looked 
 eager.  "Okay." Banewood  relented. He  trickled  a few  drops of  the 
 essence of  Ur-Baal into a  waiting glass.  "But be careful  and don't 
 stray too far," he warned.
     "Don't worry, mother,  this will be easy,"  said Aardvard Factotum 
 as he snarfed down a small mouthful of the dark green liquid. 
     Aardvard Factotum  closed his eyes.  He didn't feel  any different
 for  about thirty  seconds. Suddenly,  he  felt strange,  like he  was 
 having a  giddy dream. The muscles  in his neck felt  extremely loose,
 and then  it felt  as if  the base of  his skull  was opening  up. His 
 thoughts poured  out --  literally. "Boy, this  is neat,"  he thought.
 In his mind, he  went to the kitchen and looked for  his gold behind a 
 loose cobble stone  near the hearth... "Yes, it's still  there, all of
 it."  And while  his body  remained  indoors, his  mind perceived  the 
 sky. He was moving... at least it felt like he was. 
     He  took in  the panorama  of  a dimming  twilight sky  -- it  was 
 particularly beautiful  -- and then  perceived the smoke of  a distant
 cooking fire.  Following the source of  smoke, his mind flew  down the
 chimney  and  entered  the  living  quarters  of  one  of  his  tenant 
 farmers.  A farmer  and  his  stoutish wife  were  eating and  talking
 about the  day's events. How  odd! Aardvard  didn't hear them,  but he 
 FELT what they  were saying. They were talking about  the stranger who
 had  come to  visit  the physician,  speculating as  to  what kind  of
 chicanery might be afoot. 
     "My  secretary,  Hansen,  cannot  resist  passing  on  the  latest
 gossip," thought  Aardvard. "So Hansen  becomes a rumormonger  when he
 takes his little walks!"
     He passed  through a  small open  window and  again flew  over the
 countryside  with  increasing   exhilaration.  Aardvard's  disembodied 
 mind  experienced  elation as  the  sensations  bombarded him  through 
 numerous channels. Aardvard  understood so many things.  He sensed the
 heartbeat of  a barn swallow in  flight, he felt an  oak tree breathe,
 and he felt the vastness of the earth and the sky surrounding it.
     His mind flew  upward and  toward the  Street of  Travellers which
 ran through  the business district  of Dargon,  then over the  wall of
 Dargon  Keep.  The castle  of  Dargon  Keep  served  as home  to  Lord
 Clifton Dargon, for  whose family the city below is  named. Within the 
 keep also lived the lesser nobility and other courtiers.
     Aardvard Factotum's mind  now ran up and down the  halls of Dargon
 Keep.   He    entered   the    chamber   of   Griswald    Brutsam,   a
 physician-sorcerer  in  the employ  of  Lord  Dargon. Most  potentates
 kept court  physician-sorcerers to ward  off bad food and  bad spells.
 Clifton  Dargon was  no fool  and, hence,  no exception.  And Griswald 
 was one of the best.
     Someone else  was in  the room  with Griswald.  Normally, Aardvard
 wouldn't have  known who this man  was, but his instinct  said that it
 was  Lek Pyle,  a  leading  shipping  merchant  from Baranur.  Neither 
 Griswald nor Lek  took notice of Factotum's  entrance, though Griswald
 did  shift his  eyes about  as  if he  was about  to impart  something
 important to  the other  visitor. Anything that  Griswald had  to say, 
 particularly  to  one  of   Baranur's  leading  merchants,  was  worth 
 listening in on. Aardvard decided to eavesdrop.
     Griswald talked  about Captain  Markus and the  return to  port of
 the  Singing Mermaid.  The  Mermaid  had gone  further  east than  any 
 Baranur ship -- and it had managed to return. 
     "I  know Lord  Dargon's  will in  the matter  of  sending an  army
 against the  island of  Bichu," said Griswald.  "He wouldn't  risk it,
 and I'm  afraid he's also  morally opposed to  it. He figures  that as
 long as  those people are  already willing  to trade with  us, there's
 no sense in fighting them. And I'm not sure I see the sense either." 
     "It  doesn't matter  what Griswald  thinks of  this matter,"  said 
 Lek.  What's important  is that  Baranur  has the  exclusive right  to
 govern trade with Bichu." 
     "I still don't  like it," rejoined Griswald, "but it  looks like I 
 don't have any choice. Loyalty to Lord Dargon isn't worth my life."
     Lek smiled a crooked grin, stood up and headed for the door. 
     "Still,"  continued  Griswald, tugging  absently  at  his ear  and 
 rising  from his  seat, "I'm  not sure  of the  best way  to get  Lord
 Dargon out of the picture."
     If the disembodied  mind that was Factotum's could  have choked at
 this moment,  it would  have. "By the  great gods!"  thought Factotum. 
 "They're talking of assassination! I've got to go warn somebody..."
     While Factotum  watched mutely --  at least  mutely as far  as Lek 
 and Griswald  were concerned  -- both  men quietly  walked out  of the
 room and headed down the hall toward the stairs.
     But when Aardvard  Factotum tried to follow, he  couldn't move. He
 felt  like a  man trying  to  escape a  nightmare beast;  if he'd  had
 knees,  they'd have  turned to  rubber  right now.  No, actually,  the 
 feeling was  more like standing in  muck up to your  chin, and knowing 
 that  it was  going to  get  higher. Aardvard  felt the  same sort  of
 panic that  men felt when  they were about to  die, that is,  his mind
 seized up and refused to work. It was a sinking feeling.
