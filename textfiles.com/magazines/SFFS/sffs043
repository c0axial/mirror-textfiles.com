                               X-Editorial
     Greetings, all.  Well, there is so  much to write of  here, yet so
 little space.  Enclosed you will find  4 new Dargon stories  (the last
 of which takes  place well before the current ones).  I must apologize 
 for the  delay, but  I think you  will find it  worth the  wait. Also,
 there will be another  issue out before the end of  the semester, if I
 have my way, although  who knows? I might mention that  if you look at 
 the distribution,  we are growing at  a phenomenal pace, and  I'd like 
 to again thank all the new readers for their interest. 
     As for  new books, look for  Janet Morris. She's released  two new
 books  that  are  the  first Thieves'  World  novels,  titled  "Beyond
 Sanctuary"  and  "Beyond  the  Veil" (the  latter  available  only  in 
 hardcover as  far as  I know).  Also, new  Robert Anton  Wilson, Piers 
 Anthony, Anne McCaffrey, and a reprint of an old Tanith Lee book. 
     Two more items.  For those of you who will  be around this summer, 
 a user  at Cornell  is planning  on running a  play by  mail Diplomacy
 game  over BITNET.  For  more details  send  a mail  file  to UXHJ  at 
 CORNELLA. Finally,  for those  of you with  accounts that  will expire
 soon,  please  let  me  know  so  that  I  can  delete  you  from  the 
 distribution list.  This will help save  me from having to  sit up all
 night  watching  sent file  messages,  as  well  as the  annoyance  of
 filling up your node's spool space.

                              The Awakening 
     The  morning  sun   was  boldly  creeping  towards   the  edge  of
 Hartley's sleeping  mat when he woke.  Sitting up, he shed  the single
 wool blanket he  had been given by  one of the peasant  women from the 
 nearby village  of Greenmont.  He had  left the  shutters and  door of
 his  modest dwelling  open,  and  the smell  of  the surrounding  pine 
 woods  and the  warm  sun permeated  the room.  Shrugging  on a  light 
 brown tunic,  Hartley leaned out  the window  and took a  deep breath. 
 This was  one of those  special May  mornings Hartley had  been taught 
 were  called  Truespring, when  spring  finally  came  in a  burst  of 
 warmth and lush  greenness. The sky was clear and  deep azure, and the
 leaves on the  old Maple out back were calm,  signifying that the rest 
 of the  day would not see  any spring showers. A  nuthatch hung upside
 down on a Cedar,  nibbling at the piece of suet  Hartley had hung only 
 yesterday afternoon. Truespring  had come at last,  and Hartley's soul 
 was healed,  after the  long days  of winter. He  could feel  the raw,
 rejuvenating power of Nature, and he rejoiced in it.
     After several very  long moments of private  reverie, Hartley left 
 his  small cottage  with a  pewter basin.  He walked  barefoot down  a
 well-known  path,  carpeted  with  a dun-colored  mat  of  last  years 
 fallen  pine needles,  eventually coming  upon a  small woods  stream. 
 The druid  climbed upon a stone  that jutted into the  stream. After a 
 moment  of excited  consideration,  Hartley tossed  the basin  towards
 the path  and stripped off  his tunic. The  water would be  very cold,
 but after  the winter,  Hartley couldn't  wait until  he could  swim a
 little and wash  all over. After steeling his nerves  in the sunlight, 
 he leapt into  the spring runoff. He thrashed around  in the water for 
 a bit,  getting clean,  and hopped  right back up  onto the  rocks. He
 shouldn't stay in too long, after all.
     He laid  down on  the sun-warmed  boulder for  a time,  drying off
 and listening  to the babble  of the rushing  water and the  voices of 
 the woods.  After several minutes, he  donned his robe and  filled the
 basin, bringing it back to the hut with him. 
     Walking around  to the front of  the cabin, Hartley came  upon his
 garden.  Here grew  all varieties  of  flowers and  herbs, and,  soon,
 vegetables.  He sprinkled  water from  the basin  around. Most  of his
 flowers  were  up,  and  the  Lilacs  were  blossoming  in  white  and 
 lavender.  His  patch  of  Lilly-in-the-Valley  were  also  blossoming
 fragrantly.  There  was a  great  deal  of  work  in his  garden,  but
 Hartley  knew that  it  was well  worth  the effort.  It  was still  a
 little  early to  plant many  vegetables,  although he  ought to  head
 into town and  buy some pea and  corn seeds. If he was  lucky he could
 get two groups of  peas before fall, so he planned to  get them in the
 ground  as soon  as possible.  As for  corn, that  took all  summer to
 grow, and should be planted as soon as possible. 
     He  bent down  and picked  a single  Lilly-of-the-Valley stem  and 
 smelled  its sweet  bell-like  blossoms. Placing  the  basin down,  he
 walked to  the far side  of the garden, where  he had built  his altar 
 to the  twin gods. The altar  was nothing more than  a small gathering
 of  stones, but  it meant  more  to Hartley  than any  other place  he
 knew. The  snow had  melted from  it, revealing  the remains  of prior
 offerings:  a few  golden  leaves, a  pine tassel,  and  so forth.  He 
 knelt  before  the altar,  placing  the  Lilly  blossom atop  it.  For 
 several minutes  he sat  in silent  meditation, worshipping  the works 
 of  the  two  gods,  the  strong-willed  man  called  Nature  and  the
 softness  of Mitra,  goddess of  Love. Hartley  had been  taught early 
 the worship  of Nature,  and knew  little of Mitra  save that  she was 
 the all-mother, and Nature's twin companion. 
     After this  ritual was complete,  he quietly returned to  his home
 and prepared for a trip into town.

                            Spirit of the Wood 
     The  acrid  smell of  the  'smokers'  stung  loric's eyes  and  he 
 rolled onto  his side to cover  his head with his  lightly tanned arm. 
 This  position was  soon  ruined  also, as  an  errant  beam of  early
 morning sunlight  stole under the shade  on the window and  hit him in
 the corner of his  left eye. Soon the battle of  boy versus nature was
 over and Loric groaned as he gave up and sat up. 
     He watched the  dancing motes of dust pirouette in  and out of the
 beam of golden  light for a few  moments and then moved  to the window 
 through which it came. 
     Loric never  ceased to  be moved  by the sight  of his  village in 
 the Trees. The  web-like network of vines that linked  his home to the 
 surrounding trees,  the home of his  uncle down that one,  that of his
 sister Silsia  at the base of  the other (she was  an unmarried female
 and was  considered somewhat  a rouge by  the other  villagers, except
 Loric who worshipped the  ground she walked on even if  it was in fact 
 ground and not the vines he had been born to. 
     There was  a natural depression of  the land between here  and the
 village of  Greensward, with the  lake shimmering in the  exact center
 like a  jewel of  surpassing beauty,  in fact the  only gem  Loric had
 ever  seen was  the blue  polished stone  that his  uncle wore  in his 
 headband, as  a sign  that the Spirit  of the Wood  had chosen  him to
 lead. He was  a demanding taskmaster and not taken  to change but fair 
 to  all, and  his leadership  had  gotten the  people through  several
 hard winters  when the ice-ladened  vines had snapped and  fallen upon 
 the 'Downlanders' below. 
     The  mention of  the  Spirit of  the Wood  reminded  Loric of  his 
 morning prayer.  His was  a simple one  and not really  a rhyme  to be 
 proud of but his  Grandfather had assured him that as  time went on he 
 would  achieve better  rapport  with the  spirit  and the  Hearth-song
 would reveal itself more clearly.
     Making  a simple  hand gesture  of acknowledgement  to the  rising
 sun, he sang to the Spirit of the Wood:

                           "Spirit of the Wood,
                           Spirit of the Wood, 
                          I'd come be with you, 
                               If I could." 

     This done Loric  took a step outside to see  where his Grandfather 
 was  this  morning.  Loric's  father  Dernhelm had  been  one  of  the
 'Downlanders  that has  perished in  the  winter and  since that  time 
 Loric had  lived with  his Grandfather, whom  everyone in  the village
 called   Oldsir.  Loric's   awe  for   his  older   sister  was   only
 over-shadowed  by  that for  his  Grandfather,  who though  blind  for
 nearly  all of  Loric's  two  years and  twelve  still negotiated  the
 vines  connecting  the  upward  village   with  the  ease  some  never
 developed. Several  of the younger  men who  were jealous of  his seat
 on the arboreal council  urged him to join his wife  and family on the
 ground but he always said "If I go below again it'll be on my head!" 
     "That's  a strong  oath  for a  young man  to  take," commented  a
 voice from above him. "Shall I swear witness to it, Loric?" 
     "Oldsir I was  talking to myself, and besides, I  have yet to take 
 the Shreaving, and I can swear no oaths before then." 
     "It is  only three  more nights  till the  Moon shows  itself full
 upon the land, I think perhaps you are ready to try." 
     Loric was  surprised, it  had been  only a  cycle earlier  that he 
 had  begged Oldsir  to allow  him to  accompany the  young men  to the
 ground where  the Rite of  Shreaving began.  He looked closely  at his
 grandfather,  somehow sensing  the weariness  and pain  that sometimes
 took  his Grandfather  and  shook  him for  nights  in  a row.  Oldsir 
 turned  tired,   sightless  eyes  upon   Loric  and  in  a   flash  of
 inspiration Loric  saw what it  was that his Grandfather  was fatigued
 from.  His eyes  bore the  tale-tell spider-tracing  of a  Vision. The 
 Spirit  of the  Wood  had spoken  to Oldsir,  or  perhaps through  him 
 during  the night.  No  one alive  in  his village  had  ever had  two 
 visions from the  Spirit. This meant that something  of extreme import
 to the village was about to occur.
     Oldsir's  eyes showed  Loric  something  else equally  disturbing. 
 They revealed to Loric that his Grandfather was dying. 

     The days between  that moment and the day of  Sheaving were filled
 with  a  combination  of  early congratulations  from  the  villagers, 
 getting his  garb fitted for him  by his sister, and  quiet reflective
 evenings  as  his  Grandfather  taught him  the  oral  histories,  and
 shared with  him the knowledge of  dreams and visions that  The Spirit 
 gave him. 
     Loric  feared that  Oldsir  would  not live  through  the days  of
 Shreaving to  see if he  became a man.  But his Grandfather  seemed at 
 peace  and showed  no outward  sign that  his time  of death  had been 
 revealed  to him.  He  seemed to  convey a  quiet  dignity that  Loric
 tried  in vain  to  accept. He  felt like  shouting  and fighting  but 
 there was nothing but shadows for him to vent his anger on. 
     "Why?"  He said  finally,  unable  to keep  his  fear to  himself, 
 "It's not fair!"
     "Is it  fair that  you were  born to  my son  and not  to another, 
 that  the  rain falls  on  the  Windbourne  mountains and  leaves  the
 Plains of Woe a place where only djervishes can walk?"

                            Dreamer's Holiday
     The Grand  Hall of the  Keep of  Dargon rivaled the  local shrines 
 and temples  in augustness of  stature, especially on this  night, the
 eve of  the opening of  the Spice Market  at the Dargon  festival. The
 ivory  white hall's  sumptuous  furnishings had  been commissioned  by 
 the somewhat  frivolous and eccentric  grandfather of the  the current 
 Duke.  The high  flanking windows  were  decorated with  rose red  and
 aquamarine  tinted  glass  arranged   in  somewhat  bizarre  geometric
 patterns.  Paintings of  obscure  artists dotted  the alabaster  white
 walls.  Short flights  of burnished  wooden staircases  were the  only 
 entrance onto  the central dance floor  on which was centered  a great 
 ebony clock marking the hours in hollow base tones.
     This was  the forth night  since the  beginning of the  fairs that 
 the  hall was  filled  by a  voluptuous company.  But  this night  was 
 special, second  only to the  opening of  the fairs themselves  in its 
 festivities. While small  clusters of nobles and  merchants mingled on
 the edges  of the  hall discussing the  fairs, elegant  couples danced
 gracefully to  the controlled  harmonies of the  performing orchestra. 
 One  such   couple  was  Kite  and   Pecora.  Youthful,  aristocratic,
 handsome,  recently  engaged,  and   remarkable  pleasant,  they  were 
 favored and envied by all.
     "Your friend  Raffen doesn't seem  to be  having a good  time this
 evening," Pecora  observed indicating  a lone man  standing in  one of
 the darker  corners of  the ivory  white hall.  A nearby  coal brazier 
 sent ruddy  red light onto the  man's extremely white face  causing an
 astonishing macabre effect of which Raffen was apparently unaware. 
     "He doesn't  fit in here  for all his  efforts. He was  invited as
 entertainment only.  The court wanted  to hear  of his travels  in the
 south," Kite responded somewhat worried. 
     "Other wealthy merchants are here," Pecora suggested. 
     "Yes,  but  Raffen  isn't  wealthy. He  holds  several  commenda." 
 Noticing  her look  of  noncomprehension Kite  added "Agreements  with
 southern merchants  to act as their  agent in the fairs.  But he lacks
 any  real  property of  his  own.  The  payment  for his  services  is 
 relatively small. A  brillant man but still a  commoner." Kite's voice 
 was  wistful.  He  often  regretted   the  social  conditions  of  his
 society. "He realizes  why he was invited. Perhaps he  resents it," he 
 added somewhat gravely.
     "He's been  alone most  of the evening.  Perhaps his  novelity has
 worn off," Pecora observed.
     "I  don't know  about that.  I  overheard Sir  Ponte and  Duralt's
 younger  brother  discussing adopting  the  custom  of wearing  facial 
 talc which  Raffen picked up while  in the south. I  suspect that they 
 want to share in Raffen's attention."
     "Those  two  would  try  to  capitalize on  anything  to  get  the
 ladies'  attention.  But Raffen's  not  exactly  a lady's  man...  Too 
 introverted. I  don't think that he  wears the talc to  attract women, 
 though it does cover his rough complexion well," Pecora said.
     "It wasn't  so long ago that  Sir Ponte had designs  on you," Kite
 chided playfully. 
     "I knew  that there  was some  reason for  our engagement.  I just 
 hope getting rid  of Ponte is worth the price,"  Pecora responded with
 equal playfulness and kissed Kite. 
     "It's  Raffen's brooding  that  chases everyone  off," Kite  added
 after  a moment.  "He  always has  something on  his  mind, though  he 
 never admits what it is." 
     "Yes, he  always appears so contemplative...depressed.  He doesn't 
 dance and often seems so distant."
     "Yes, but conversations  with him are never dull.  Maybe we should
 go over," Kite suggested.
     "I'd rather  have you to  myself.... There's Pravo. Why  don't you 
 introduce them. He's also something of a misfit." 
     "Good idea.  Be back in a  moment." Kite smiled as  he crossed the 
 dance floor. 
     As Kite and  Pravo approached, Raffen stood  admiring an arresting 
 oil painting  detailing an  immense cavern  wherein cowled  riders fly
 gray,  corpse-like   humanoids  with   large  membranous   wings  from
 galleries  and high  ledges over  a darkened,  sluggish river  flowing
 over uncountable cataracts into a distant chasm.
     "Raffen, have  you met Pravo,  one of Dargon's  most distinguished
 scholars?" Kite asked. The gentleman looked distinctly uncomfortable.
     "No,   I'm  sure   that  I   would  recall   such  a   pleasurable
 experience." Raffen replied driely.
     "I'm sure  that you will  find that you  have much in  common. But
 I'm afraid that  I will have to  leave you to yourselves.  If you will
 excuse  me,  duty  calls,"  The  departing  Kite  explained  gesturing
 toward Pecora who seemed to be signalling him.
     "I've been looking  forward to meeting you,  Raffen, since hearing
 of your travels to the far south," Pravo said with a bit of hesitation.
     "Yes, it seems  my adventures have sparked great  interest in this
 court," Raffen said with artificial warmness tainted with agitation. 
     "But my  interests are different  than most, I'll  warrant," Pravo 
 said looking  about court, perhaps  checking for eavesdroppers.  "I am 
 less  concerned with  brillant scenes  and deeds  of daring  than with
 the cultures and religions which you encountered." 
     "That is  well because  my meager collection  of brave  and daring 
 deeds are to  the point of exhaustion." Both laughed.  Raffen began to 
 develop an interest in the man. 
     "You  see,   I  am   something  of   a  scholar,   perhaps  you've 
 encountered my works, 'Legends  and Myths  of Thasodonia' or 'Northern
 Nights'?" 
     "You  wrote  'Legends  and  Myths'  !?!"  Raffen  said  with  some
 excitement. "I've read the work and liked it a great deal." 
     "You needn't  flatter me, I  have no great influence  here," Pravo
 said looking somewhat uncomfortable. 
     "No, I'm  serious. Your rendition of  the Tchai myth was  the most 
 complete that I've yet encountered." 
     "Oh! Then you  really have some interest in my  field," Pravo said 
 looking pleased. "Perhaps you can be of some help."
     "Hopefully,  how  might  I  help   you?"  Raffen  offered  with  a 
 slightly sarcastic flourish.
     "I'm compiling a  collection of creation myths.  Perhaps you could 
 contribute something from the South," Pravo asked hopefully. 
     "Oh......  I'm   sorry  but  my  business   there  was  remarkably 
 consuming. I had little time to really observe the people."
     "Unfortunate."  Pravo  appeared  disappointed. "I  was  hoping  to
 uncover  something unknown  in this  area," Pravo  said turning  away, 
 showing obvious signs of intent to depart.
     "No wait.  Let me think..  I do remember one rather unusual tidbit.
 Have you ever heard the word 'Squarg'?" Raffen asked with a smile.
     "'Squarg'?....  No, not  that  I recall,"  Pravo replied  somewhat 
 confused, trying to  determine if Raffen was joking.  "It doesn't seem 
 to  fit  into  the  linguistics  of  any  language  with  which  I  am
 familiar. What does it mean?" 
     "As  all really  good  words, it  stands for  a  concept which  is
 difficult to  express otherwise. Perhaps  because it is not  of truely
 human origin," Raffen added solemnly. 
     "A   nonhuman  word?   No   wonder  I   did   not  recognize   it. 
 Interesting... Please  attempt to  define it as  best you  can," Pravo 
 requested somewhat reassured but still confused. 
     "The  best method  of defining  it lies  in the  creation myth  in
 which it originated." 
     "Oh  then, by  all means  tell it  as best  you can,"  Pravo asked 
 seeming very attentive.
     "As  the myth  goes, the  word was  coined by  the first  sentient 
 creature," Raffen began then stopped. 
     "Oh, I see. Go on." 
     "Soon after  it was created, the  sentience was guided by  the All 
 Creator to  a point from which  it could view the  entirety of reality 
 so  that for  the first  time the  Creator could  share his  handiwork 
 with  another  capable  of  appreciating  it."  There  was  a  moments
 hesitation  in  Raffen's speech  followed  by  an encouraging  gesture 
 from  Pravo. "The  astonished  creature looked  upon  the vastness  of
 time, space,  void, living, and  nonliving. In response,  the creature
 uttered  what  was  probably  the  first word,  though  it  is  almost 
 certain that  this creature  possessed no vocal  abilities as  we know 
 them.  And  this  first  word, this  first  independent  thought,  was
 'Squarg', or so  that is the sound  which man has given  that word. It 
 stands  for many  things. It  symbolizes  all the  wonder and  rapture 
 inherent in a glimpse  of the entirety of reality, but  at one and the 
 same  time,  it relates  a  certain  feeling  of pride  and  contempt, 
 hubris  against the Creator.  As if one were to say  'Is this the best
 that you could do?'  and 'Beware God, I am Man.  These realms are mine
 to  do with  as  I please  and  I  will do  better.'  There are  other
 nuances of  course but these  are even  more difficult to  define. All
 in all not a  very complex creation myth. I hope  you will forgive its
 brevity and lack of plot," Raffen finished. 
     "No.  No. It  is fascinating  and original.  Unlike any  that I've
 heard before.  A major contribution for  my book. How did  you come by
 it? Some nonhuman work?" Pravo asked in apparent euphoria. 
     "Perhaps. I  first read  it in  a book called  The King  in Yellow 
 though I've seen it elsewhere since," Raffen replied.
     "The  King  in Yellow!?...hmph..  Yes,  I've  heard of  the  book, 
 though I've  never seen  a copy. I'd  almost attributed  its existence
 as a  myth itself what with  the remarkable rumors that  surround it." 
 Raffen  nodded. "It  is said  that few  survive a  perusal with  their
 sanity fully intact.  It has been said  to have been the  doom of many 
 great minds."
     "Yes, that is true," Raffen affirmed, lost in thought. 
     "It was written by an artist, I believe," Pravo offered.
     "Yes...  It  has  been  and   will  be  written  by  many  artists
 individually," Raffen replied, his voice trailing off in volume.
     "Pardon,  I  didn't  quite  hear that.  It's  becoming  dreadfully
 noisy in  here. Perhaps we  could step outside." Pravo  pointed toward 
 the balcony. 
     "It is  little better out there.  But yes, let's." Both  exited to
 the dark balacony which overlooked a street  crowded with  celebrating
 townspeople.
     "About the origin of the book," Pravo began.
     "It was  written by  an artist/poet who  was attempting  to define
 and codify  a system of creative  motifs and symbols which  are common 
 to all  cultures. Metaphors  and images  which transcend  all cultures
 and all  peoples. It is  these primal truths  which are said  to drive 
 men mad," Raffen said in a serious tone.
     "You seem quite  sound and you've read the  book." Pravo attempted 
 weak humor. 
     "I sometimes wonder..." 
     Stunned  into silence  for  a  moment, Pravo  said  finally "I  am 
 quite anxious to read the book myself, perhaps you have it at hand?"
     "No.  My copy  is in  a  safe place  very far  away. Very  far..."
 Again Raffen trailed off. 
     "That is  unfortunate. Still, I will  do my best to  locate a copy
 here  in Dargon."  Pravo seemed  somewhat irritated  and unsettled  by 
 Raffen's tone. 
     "Any intellect  with the ability and  the desire to read  the book 
 will eventually locate it," Raffen offered somewhat mysteriously.
     The  scholar  chuckled  weakly.  "Then   I  have  some  hope...  I 
 think..." Very  unsettled, Pravo  looked deeply  at Raffen  who stared
 off across the festivities below.
     A rather  plain looking, middle-aged  matron stepped out  onto the
 balcony  and expressed  her  desire  to dance  with  Pravo before  the 
 musicians departed. Pravo could hardly refuse. 
     "I hope that we  will get a chance to speak  again," Pravo said as 
 they drifted apart, possibly relieved by the interruption.
     "I am  certain that  we will,"  Raffen replied,  uncertain whether
 he was heard  over the buzz of  the company. Seeing that  the ball was 
 nearly at an end, Raffen decided to make his excuses and depart. 

     Atros felt  no guilt for  assuming Raffen Yeggent's  identity even 
 though  it had  required slaying  Raffen. The  two had  met along  the 
 road  to Dargon  and  had remained  traveling  companions for  several 
 days.  Atros  had been  wary  of  this  relationship from  the  start,
 particularly  since he  wanted to  severe his  ties with  the city  of
 Magnus.  It might  prove  difficult  later if  a  witness existed  who 
 could  attest  to the  specifics  of  his  journey. But  the  somewhat 
 lonely Raffen  had forced  himself on Atros  and Atros  hadn't pressed 
 the issue. Raffen  had been a talkative sort describing  in detail his
 background,  recent  travels,  business  matters,  and  future  plans. 
 Atros  did his  best to  remain noncommital  to Raffen's  occasionally
 probing questions  but it grew  to be strenuously difficult  at times. 
 Still,  Atros  felt  so  refreshed  and contented  by  virtue  on  the 
 continued use  of the nepenthe that  he had almost enjoyed  the verbal 
 fencing at times.
     Atros had  sensed almost immediately  that Raffen wasn't  what one
 might call  a highly scrupulous  individual. Raffen's main  pursuit in
 life  it  seemed  lay  in  acquiring wealth.  His  scruples,  if  they 
 existed  at  all,  didn't  seem  to  interfere.  Hence,  Atros  wasn't
 particularly  surprised  by  the  interest Raffen  had  shown  in  his 
 collection of rare  books. This wariness had cost Raffen  his life and 
 saved Atros  his own.  Raffen had  sought to slay  Atros in  his sleep
 but hadn't anticipated  a prepared defense. Atros had  made quick work
 of  him,  only  later  realizing  the  opportunity  which  Raffen  had 
 afforded him.  Raffen had mentioned  that he had never  visited Dargon 
 previously  nor was  anyone there  capable of  recognizing him.  Atros 
 immediately saw  the potential  profits in assuming  Raffen's business
 dealings  at the  fair  but hadn't  anticipated  being propelled  into 
 courtly life. 
     Had Atros  known of the  notoriety involved, he might  have chosen 
 to act otherwise.  Atros knew that he could not  maintain the disguise
 for long.  The continued use  of the drug,  and the peaceful  sleep it
 offered,  had allowed  him to  lead  an almost  normal existence.  His
 distinctive  nervous twitching  had ceased,  but only  for so  long as 
 his  supply remained.  Thus, he  had  let it  be known  that he  would 
 depart after  the fairs though  he anticipated settling in  Dargon for 
 some  time. The  facial  talc  was a  convenient  affectation to  help
 reduce  the possibility  of  being recognized  latter.  But still,  he 
 feared  discovery  because  he  knew  he  possessed  many  unconscious 
 mannerisms which  were difficult to conceal  without concerted effort.
 He tried  to make  the best of  the situation and  enjoy a  holiday at
 court, a priviledge seldom enjoyed by many. 

     The  street festival  was  still  in full  force  when Atros  left
 Dargon  Keep  on his  way  to  the bordering  house  in  which he  was
 residing.  He  wound  his  way through  the  narrow,  winding  streets 
 filled with  indentured servant  and aristocrat alike.  Each receiving
 shares  of revelry  according to  their temperment  rather than  their 
 social  standing.  Here  at  least   was  a  Dionysian  revelry  which 
 contrasted   sharply   against   the  austere   courtly   celebration. 
 Celebrants  in   grotesque  animal   masks  and  other   more  bizarre 
 customing danced  in wild revelry  to the  tune of frenzied  music and
 racous  laughter.  Body  paints  and large,  fluttering  banners  lent 
 colouring to  the normally drab  streets and alley  ways. Prostitutes,
 both amateur  and professional, fronged  and cajoled the  crowd. Cheap
 alcohol  was  the prevalent  intoxicant  though  Atros observed  other
 more questionable  substances being  huckstered in the  darker corners
 of the street.  Anything and everything could be had  in abundance. It
 seemed that a delicious romp was being had by all. 
     Atros  did  not  view  the  excessive crowding  and  noise  as  an 
 annoyance. He  enjoyed becoming  one with the  organism of  the crowd;
 to allow  himself to become lost  in the fusion of  opposing emotional 
 forces of  the gathering.  For a  time he  could let  the mood  of the
 crowd become all, loosing his own worries, fears, and  regrets. As any
 such  gathering,  with  its  loud  noises,  bright  sights,  and  wild
 dancing,  its surface  was coloured  by  great gaiety  and joy.  These
 were things to  be cherished and saved, hoarded for  harder times: the 
 soft glow  of happy faces,  the energy of  youth, and the  vitality of 
 age. But Atros' strong empathic ability soon penetrated this surface. 
     Beneath  lay darker  forces: tensions,  deep emotional  needs, and
 emptiness. These people  had come to escape some  emptiness which they 
 could not  fill in  their day to  day lives. They  came to  forget the 
 mundane  realities of  their world  for a  time and  indulge in  their
 fantasies. But by  doing so they brought these  emptinesses with them.
 Atros  sensed that  few, if  any, were  really happy  or content  with 
 their lives.  All sought  release from  their confinements,  to become 
 more  than themselves  if  just  for a  short  interval.  And to  some
 measure  they were  successful.  They achieved  through strong  drink, 
 orgasmic dancing, casual  flirtations, or narcotics what  could not be
 won  in  mediocrity. Atros  did  not  judge  them  for this;  he  knew
 himself to have  much worse faults and difficulties. But  he could not
 avoid  feeling a  certain  unescapible sadness.  This  fused with  the
 gaiety to create an overwhelming bitter-sweet atmosphere for Atros.
     Atros was  so involved with the  mood of the crowd  that he didn't
 notice the  prescence of his  old acquaintance the alchemist  until he
 was quite near.
     "Gilman! Alive!"  Atros' shout was  drowned out in the  hubbub. He
 quickly darted into  a nearby entry way which he  found to be occupied 
 by a young couple who obviously resented the intrusion.
     In the  safety of the darkness  Atros began to mutter  to himself,
 causing  some  concern in  the  two  youths  who  soon left  Atros  to
 himself.  "Gilman alive....impossible....I  don't  make mistakes  like
 that.  He was  certainly dead.  The  wound was  fatal....No man  lives
 after loosing that much blood." 
     Atros glanced out  the archway to see Gilman  walking rapidly away 
 apparently  scanning the  crowd. Atros'  hope that  he had  mistaken a 
 similar  man for  Gilman quickly  faded.  It was  the same  bedraggled
 gray hair  peppered with black;  the same  loping gate as  well. Atros 
 was certain  that he'd  seen Gilman wearing  that course  woolen frock 
 before  as  well.  Even  the  momentary glimpse  of  the  man's  shoes 
 confirmed that Gilman was alive and in Dargon. 
     Atros  could  think  of  only one  explanation  for  the  normally 
 sedentary  Gilman to  come to  Dargon. He  must know  or suspect  that
 Atros   was  here.   His  prescence  in the  crowd   was  now   easily 
 explainable.  How better  to find  a man  in Dargon  than to  attend a
 festival with  the better part  of the city's visitors  and population 
 in attendance?  But had  Gilman seen  him? As  Atros wiped  his sweaty 
 brow and  his fingers came away  covered with white talc,  he realized
 that Gilman  could not have  recognized him. His fearful  reaction had 
 been  foolish.  Once more  Atros  glanced  out  but could  not  locate
 Gilman  in  the   crowd.  Atros  mentally  whipped   himself  for  not
 following  Gilman immediately  as he  strode  out into  the street  to
 begin the search.
     If Gilman  were truely searching for  him, why had he  come alone? 
 He must  realize how outmatched  he was. Atros would  have anticipated 
 two or three  armed bodyguards accompanying Gilman at  the very least. 
 Nor had  Atros believed that Gilman  would go to such  lengths to seek 
 him out personally.  Gilman just wasn't the vengeful type  or so Atros
 had believed. But  Gilman was alone, which  obviously meant something, 
 though Atros  didn't know what that  was. It suddenly occurred  to him 
 that  perhaps  following  Gilman  hadn't been  a  wise  idea.  Perhaps
 Gilman had  set himself  up as bait  to draw Atros  into some  sort of 
 trap or ambush.  Since it was unlikely  that he could find  him in any 
 event, Atros gave up the search. 
     Atros walked home  using an indirect route and  checking often for
 followers, but  there were none.  As he walked he  considered Gilman's 
 survival.  Perhaps  the  apprentices  had arrived  much  earlier  than
 Atros  had expected  and  somehow  rescued the  old  man. This  seemed 
 unlikely though  Atros spent a few  moments worrying that he  had been
 seen. Not  that that really  mattered now  that the victim  was alive. 
 Besides, even  if Gilman  had received  some sort of  aid in  time, he
 didn't seem to  be suffering from his wound. He  appeared as whole and
 sound as  any time  Atros had  seen him  in the  past. If  anything he 
 seemed  more  healthy.  Atros  considered  further.  He  had  read  of 
 alchemical preparations said  to restore health to the  nearly dead or 
 to  quicken the  dead,  but  he had  thought  these  well beyound  the 
 abilities  of Gilman.  Gilman might  have obtained  something of  this
 sort during  his career  and his  apprentices might  have administered
 it to  him. Atros  had one  further worry.  It was  said that  one who
 imbibed a  special preparation of  the Philospher's Stone,  the secret 
 ingredient and  goal of the  highest forms  of alchemy, would  enjoy a 
 greatly  extended  life  and  would  be very  resistant  to  death  by
 mishap. If  Gilman had  done this,  not only  had he  thereby survived 
 Atros' previous  attempt on his  life, but  he would also  survive any 
 getsequent. Invulnerable enemies  came near to heading  Atros' list of
 undesirable possessions. One thing was for certain, all was not well.

                                Dawn Watch 
     The stream was  peaceful, the approaching dawn  dimly lighting it. 
 A gentle  breeze stirred the leaves,  and frogs peeped quietly  in the 
 marshes nearby. 
     Eli  Barel was  asleep  in his  house nearby.  He  slept the  deep 
 sleep of a  man who had worked  hard, and would soon  work hard again. 
 He  and his  eldest son  had worked  until evening  to put  a roof  on
 Widow Rachel's house,  and with the light they would  start to cut her 
 some wood to last her through the winter. 
     Had he  been awake  he might  have heard the  sound of  the frogs,
 but certainly not the  sound of the stream, shielded as  it was by the 
 fifty foot drop over the limestone cliff.
     The peace of  the stream was rudely broken by  the rough sounds of
 hooves. There  was a stirring  of the  underbrush, and a  horseman and 
 mount stepped  out of the  tall grass on the  far side of  the stream. 
 As he  crossed the  water, muddying it,  he looked up  at the  face of
 the  cliff.  A  band  of  twenty  or so  men,  all  roughly  clad  and 
 unshaven, followed  him across.  At least three  bore the  angry marks
 of a  skull branded on  their foreheads,  the marks of  condemned men.
 Most  carried swords  at their  sides, and  some had  bows slung  over
 their shoulders. All had a predatory air to them.
     As soon as  he was in the  shadow of the cliff,  the leader turned 
 to face the others, his arm raised for silence. 
     "At  the top  this cliff  is the  first of  many houses.  In those 
 houses are  groveling vapor-worshippers!  There is  no one  to protect 
 them, and  they will  not fight!  Take any booty  you want,  but don't 
 burn  anything.  Kill  everyone!  We  will  leave  no  survivors!"  He
 punctuated the last with a dark scowl.
     "What  of the  women? We  were promised  women!" A  deep muttering 
 rose  from  the assembled  men.  A  lecherous  grin broke  across  the 
 leader's face.
     "I didn't  say how  you had to  kill them. It's  been a  long time 
 since I've had an infidel's wife!" 
     Mocking laughter was  his only reply. Suddenly one  of the raiders
 in the back gave a shout, and pointed up. 
     The  leader swiveled  in his  seat. He  looked to  the top  of the
 cliff.  There stood  a man,  holding a  staff. He  was clothed  all in
 white, and  his face  was set  with an  angry look.  He glared  at the 
 cutthroats below  with an air of  authority that gave even  the leader 
 pause. The murders only paused a moment, though.
     Those of  the raiders who  had bows  grabbed them, but  before any
 could raise  them the  figure leaned  forward, and  struck the  end of
 the rod on the ground, a foot or so short of the cliff edge.
     The  moment  it struck  the  ground  shook.  All  but two  of  the
 raider's horses  fell to the ground.  At the same moment,  a huge slab
 of  limestone calved  off the  face of  the cliff.  It crumbled  as it 
 fell, causing  an avalanche.  For a  few long  moments, rock  and dust 
 poured from the face  of the cliff. Then the stream  was at peace once
 more. Where  horses had stood only  moments before, there now  stood a
 pile of rubble.
     Eli  Barel awoke.  His bed  still  shook slightly.  A tremor?  Eli 
 pondered the  thought. They  were not common,  but he  had experienced
 them before.  Nothing more  followed, so he  relaxed. Slept  in today, 
 he thought. The sun is almost up.
     He arose,  leaving his wife to  groan to herself. He  dressed, and
 walked out  of the house and  down the path  as he had for  over sixty 
 years.  He followed  the  path as  it lead  toward  the stream.  Then,
 noticing something  different, he left it  as it turned down  into the
 woods, and rather walked up the slope toward the cliff.
     He walked up to the edge, and looked over at the pile of rock. 
     A rockslide, he thought. Levy might like to see this. 
     He was  about to  turn to  walk back down  when the  early morning 
 light caught  a reflection. Getting down  on his knees, he  examined a
 dark vein of  rock as it ran  almost from the cliff  edge halfway down 
 the cliff.  As he knelt there  his eyes widened. He  reached forth his
 hand, and  with a  small effort,  wrenched a chunk  of rock  loose. He
 held it up to  the light. Even in the morning's  dimness, he could see
 the metal running through the granite. 
     "Gold.  Gold!  GOLD!  Everybody!  We've got  gold  on  our  land!"
 Getting to his feet, Eli ran back to the house.
     For the last time that day, peace once more fell on the stream.
