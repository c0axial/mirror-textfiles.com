
Welcome to the fifth installment of the Frog Farm! Due to the lack of
activity here (as well as my lack of receiving any new mailings via
snailmail), I've decided to dig out excerpts from a few older pieces
I have lying around. As always, feedback is welcomed.

This issue contains the following pieces:

1) Rescinding and Rejecting Social Security w/Marion and Roger Elvick
2) Information on George Gordon's School of Common Law
3) An Example of a Constructive Notice
4) Sample Response to Administrative Summons
5) Another "Fireside Chat" with yr obd't svt the moderator

[This piece is part 1 of 4; I'll be posting the rest of the segments
in order in issues to come. The 'Roger' who comments extensively in
parantheses is most likely Roger Elvick, who co-founded Barrister's
Inne School of Common Law with George Gordon in Boise, Idaho in the
early 1980's, and went on to found the Nitty Gritty Law School. Roger
is currently undergoing 'diesel therapy'; i.e., being shuttled around
from prison to prison. From what I have been able to gather, the gist
of it is as follows:

Roger and George found Barrister's Inne. This teaches how to deny
improper jurisdiction of others over yourself -- the idea is to deny
all jurisdictions other than the common law. This includes equity,
admiralty, maritime, etc. For example, commercial paper (i.e., anything
but lawful money, that is, gold and silver of fixed weights and purities)
falls under equity; common law deals with substance.

Roger goes on to found Nitty Gritty. Here, he explored the concept of
entering into equity, WHILE STILL RETAINING RIGHTS AT LAW. Using UCC
1-207 is an example of this.

This is where my information gets hazy. But if I have the pieces together
right, the reason Roger is a POW is that he discovered how to play by
their rules too well. How to use the same rules that the banks, other
financial institutions and large companies use in a futile effort to
create something out of nothing -- how to do the same thing that the
unlawful Federal Reserve does every single day and has since 1913. The
power to issue credit.

Who wouldn't be scared out of their wits at the idea of somebody being
able to write their own ticket, 100% legally? (Remember the distinction
between "legal" and "lawful"?) The folks who follow the common law just
want to be left alone, more often than not. But this fellow was butting
heads with the big boys, on their own turf -- the world of imaginary
wealth -- and a turf they viewed as their own to such an extent that they
would steamroll over any outside who dared to profane it.

Or maybe I'm just letting my imagination run away with me.

that that was a wrong phone number and that there was no one with 
that  name  listed.. I will say that the first  name  is  Marion. 
Roger)
     (Since I am not in a position to get out and fight  in 
the courts myself, I try to make this information available to as 
many people as possible and as cheaply as possible. I have  never 
yet  had any one complain,at least to me, that they have not  got 
their money's worth of material when they wrote to me. What I  do 
wish is that they would write back and tell me how they used  the 
material  and how successful they were.)

    Affidavit  of  Status

The  presumption  that everyone is subject to  law  merchant,  or 
mercantile  equity  or commercial equity, and  are  operating  in 
limited  liability  for debt is not  true.

     (Comment,Roger.  I would say that this is partially true and partially
not true.  If you have entered into any contract where all the details  of
the contract  have  not been fully given, then you of course are  not bound
by  the  terms of the contract. Neither  can  your  public servants  in  state
government or Congress vote you into  a  contract.  I would say that you are
operating in limited  liability, but, a note is payment if both parties agree
that it is  payment. It is legal to tender the note but it does not have to be
accepted.  The "paying" of debts with notes is a privilege  granted  to you by
the federal government, a privilege that can be revoked at any time. 4 Nev.
Rep. Linn v Minor. But we weren't told this were we?  How can our public
servants grant us privileges when it  was the people who granted them the
privilege of representing us. The power of representation is not a right, it
is a privilege granted to them by the people who voted for them. This, the
U.S.A., being a Republic, if you didn't vote for them then they don't represent
you. The best definition I have ever seen in regards to a  Republican form of
government is that it is that form of government in which the laws we accept
are self imposed)) It is my opinion that if  a  law  is not voted on by the
people then the  law is  only declatory   and not mandatory. Our representatives
cannot,  under the freedom to contract, vote us into a contract without  telling
us and without our approval )

    How does this affect the  status of a citizen, the free natural man, in
court? Due to the economic situation,  it is assumed that all persons operate
on credit  and that the common law is nowhere applicable. All are assumed to
be "merchants  in  equity",  and thereby governed  by  the  "general commercial
law."

(Comment,Roger.  The  law does  not  operate  on assumptions)

     These  natural persons are by  all  intents  and purposes   merchants  and
traders  at  law  on  a  cash   basis.

(Comment,Roger.  He  who  deals in negotiable  instruments  is  a merchant at
law----but are Fed. notes negotiable----not according to  state law.---The
Uniform Commercial Code--and federal  courts are  bound  to  use  state law
when  not  contradictory  to  the U.S.Constitution.  Also,  in order for the
notes to  be  currency they  must  be "current", that is "redeemable". This
is  a  good place to start with an Information in the Nature of a Quo Warranto
because  the feds have "abandoned" the contract,i.e.  12  USC 411- Notes to be
redeemable)

   These natural persons are by  all intents  and  purposes  merchants and
traders at law  on  a  cash basis, without recourse to such standard lawful
money, and enjoys no  privilege  of  limited liability for the  payment  of
debts.

(Comment,Roger.In the book, The Federal Reserve Bank:Its Purposes and
Functions,  1939  ed. the only thing  listed  as  "cash"  is coin. Also, all
the  coin used today is against the law as  it  is against  the  law  to
charge over 50% seigniorage  and  the  feds admit that the coins are only
"tokens"---this being the  definition of a common law cheat or cheating at the
common law, such as using false weights and measures or "devices" to deceive)

 We deny all jurisdiction of mercantile equity brought on by  HJR 192   of
June 5, 1933, expressly law merchant, Roman Civil Law, and  admiralty law, and
demand all of our rights at the Common law.
    (1) We do not have a bank account.

((Comment,Roger. Years ago,  people used  to  deposit their gold and silver
coin in the  banks.  When they wanted some back it was legal for the bank to
"tender"  fed. notes.  When you deposited your "silver" in the bank a  debt
was created. The bank owed you.The bank "tendered" you fed notes  and you
accepted, thus the banks liability to give silver was  "discharged". However,
if one discovered later that the notes were  no good,  the  note being a
"chose in action" or, "something  to  be sued  upon", the person receiving the
note from the bank  had  an action  against the bank for the sum of money
deposited., or  for the amount of the note. As long as I have my bank account
then  I have  a  pending action against the bank, so I am not sure  if  I want
to give up any bank accounts--and besides---the  disclosures were  not  fully
given. Consumer Credit Code.))

    2. We  do  not have  any  credit cards.

 (Comment,Roger. Why not? When  the  bank "extends   credit"  they call the
Credit Bureau to  see  how  your credit  is  so it is your credit that is being
used and  not  the banks. But the banks claim to extend credit which is false
advertising and which is in violation of the Fair Trade Laws   because you
don't  have equal opportunities and your  state  legislators have given special
privileges to their creatures, privileges that even  the  state does not have
and that is a no/no.When  you  get your credit card and use it to the limit and
find that you  can't "perform" on the contract and the bank sues, you submit a
bill of particulars  to find out just what it was that the bank gave  you
because  you  have the right to give back to the  bank  the  same thing as you
received and if they cannot identify the thing  that you  received  then  you
cannot give it back,  Now  can  you????)
    
3. We  are not on the dole system.

4. We are not franchised  or privileged  by  government.

 (Comment.Roger.  In the book  on  the Constitution  that is used by your
Congressmen,it says in  regard to  section two of the 14th Amendment, that
"because  of  governments  coercive power to  'enfranchise' persons, this
section  of the  Constitution is nothing more than a  historical  curiosity."
Voting  is  a franchise and if you vote you are  exercising  your "voting
franchise".  The  14th Amendment  extended  the  "voting franchise"  to
"subjects" of the United States. Before  the  14th Amendment  only free, white
men could vote and you had to have  a good  paying job or own property. It was
assumed that only  those who  paid the costs of running the government would
be  the  ones who  voted  for their representatives. After the passage  of  the
14th Amendment anyone could vote and they immediately voted  away the  property
of the property owners and you had no  recourse  at law.Everyone  was  lowered
down to the same  class  as  "slaves." Everything  was turned around
bassackwards. Voting was a  "right" possessed  by  those who paid the salaries
of  their  representatives. The 14th Amendment changed it into a "franchise"
So  never never claim anything under the 14th Amendment, that is if you are
a  free person .If  you do then you   are  exercising  a franchise. You must
distinguish yourself as a free  person  from one  who is a "subject". Hitler
is often quoted by well  intended people as saying that "it will never do to
have 'subjects'  carry arms."  What  he was referring to is those not of
German  blood. Germans  were  citizens, Foreigners were "subjects".)

     5. We are not engaged in interstate  commerce.

(Comment,Roger.  You are if you make long distance phone calls,  send
telegrams out of state, etc.,)

    Therefore we are not subject to government  regulation or the government
courts  of  equity.

(Comment.Roger.  Equity means nothing more than fair  dealings  which
the  patriots  don't  get very much of)

 We as  free  and  natural persons  are entitled to use the basic principles of
the  United States  Constitution,  that the people as one created  for  them-
selves as Americans, a general law and a supreme law,binding upon every
government official in the Untied States, both  state  and federal.  It is the
birthright of every natural person who  is a sovereign of these United States,
never to be abrogated,  repudiated, diminished, or "suspended by the government
offices it created, or by any other office created, or by any other office
created  under "commercial law."

(Comment,Roger. Your  "birthright"was "diminished"by  the 14th Amendment when
the  voting  "franchise" was extended to  "subjects". Why do you think that
just as soon as someone enters this country, they are signed up to vote?
We have a democracy don't  we?  At least  that  is  what we are told. In a
democracy  the  majority rules.  If the majority are "subjects", and if the
newspapers and your  public servants can convince enough people that the
United States  is  a democracy, then what chance does  the  "freeperson" have?)

    Law of the Land.    The general misconception is  that any  statute passed
by legislators bearing the appearance of  law constitutes  the  law of the land.
The U.S. Constitution  is  the supreme law of the land, and any statute,  to
be  valid  must  be in agreement. It is impossible for  both  the Constitution
and a law violating it to be valid. One  must  prevail. This is succinctly
stated as follows:     "The general rule is  that an unconstitutional statute,
though having the form  and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly
void, and  ineffective for any purpose: since unconstitutionality dates from
the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the  decision so
branding it. An unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation,  is as inoperative
as if it had never been passed.  Such  a statute leaves the question that it
purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not been enacted.
Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principles follow that it
imposes no duties, confers no rights, creates no office, bestows no power or
authority on anyone, affords no protection, and justifies  no acts  performed
under it..    A void act cannot be  legally  consistent with a valid one. An
unconstitutional law cannot  operate to supersede any existing valid law.
Indeed,insofar as a  statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land it
is  superseded thereby.     No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law  and
no  courts  are  bound  to  enforce  it."16  Am.Jur.2nd,  p.  177    

   Department  of  Health and  Human  Services.
   Social  Security  Administration     etc.    

Attention of person in management position of this agency  and/or other
government agency,etc.,.    The purpose of this letter  is to  inform you of my
status and demand that you, your  agency  or any  other government agency, no
longer have any control over  my property  withheld from my wages in the form
of  social  security deductions  converting it to the use of another.

(Comment  Roger. This is what the 14th Amendment did. It gave non property
owners the "privilege" of voting away your property  I receive disability
compensation  from the V.A. I should not be allowed  to  vote because I will
vote for the Congressman who promises to  increase my  disability
compensation.(I don't vote) if this is  to  be  a free Nation then it is
the people who "pay" my  compensation who  should  decide  how  much I  get.
But  the  way  things   are today...)

    This letter will inform you of the basis of  my demand as a free and natural
sovereign. I am sending a copy of  one of  the documents which was included in
the package by  certified mail,  return  receipt requested. I suggest you  give
this  your undivided attention.

    (Comment,Roger. Anyone doing this should send a notice of disclaimer to all
government agencies  disclaiming  any and all pretended services they allege
to  provide  you through buying and selling of "your" share of government bonds
or indebtedness  and you had better notify all voters that  they  do not  have
your permission and consent to use  your  property  as collateral for  "their"
bond issues. If they use your property as collateral  for bond issues then your
property is vested  with  a public interest, this is why the officials in
Providence R.I. can tell  a certain man I know of to paint the eves of his
house  or they  will put him in jail. His property is vested with a  public
interest,  he  must keep it in repair so that the  debt  will  be secured. What
would secure all this debt if everyone  would  tear down their houses and live
in tents? The bankers might go crazy.)
     
     In  the History of the United States of  America,  there  is probably no
more dramatic demonstration of deliberately  designed misinformation then the
literature put out by the Social Security Administration.  One need go no
further than three (3)  decisions handed  down  by the U.S.Supreme court, two
in 1937  and  one  in 1960, to realize what blatant deception the current Social
Security literature contains. These three cases are: Stewart  Machine Co  v
Davis  301 US 548 (1937), Helvering v Davis,  301  US  619 (1937)  and  Fleming
v Nestor, 363 US 603  (1960)  These  cases enunciate the position of the
Supreme court on the Social Security  Act  and  the actual legal position of
those  who  expect  to receive  benefits from it. Highlights of these cases are
as  follows:
   1. "The proceeds of both (the employer and the employee) taxes are to be
paid into the treasury like other internal  revenue  generally  and  are  not
earmarked  in  any  way."  301  US619,supra.
   2.The court points out that payroll deductions  of American  workers are not
payments on premiums for  insurance  of any  kind,  but are simply income
taxes:     "..Eligibility  for benefits...(does)  not in any true sense depend
on  contributions through  the payment of taxes. 363 US 603,supra.
  3.  Furthermore, payments made by employers for each of their employees  are
not  matching to be credited to the account of the employee,  but constitute
an excise tax on the employer's right  (Roger  privilege) to do business.
Consequently, his so called  "contributions" go  directly into the general fund
of the treasury and  "are  not earmarked in any way." 301 US 619 supra.
  4. People participating  in  Social Security payroll deductions do  not
acquire  any property rights  or contractual rights through their payments, as
they would if they were paying on an insurance policy or contributing  to an
annuity plan. Simply put, there are  no  guarantees! The  Congress does have
power to deny benefits to  citizens  even though they have paid social  security
taxes. Also, the amount of benefits  are at the option of Congress. Fleming v
Nestor  supra.

  5. Benefits granted under social security are therefore not  considered
earned by the worker, but simply constitute a gratuity or gesture of charity.
As the court stated:    "Congress included in the  original  act,  and has
since retained,  a  claim  expressly reserving to it the right to alter,amend,
or repeal any provision of  the act."  Fleming  v Nestor  supra.

(Comment.Roger.Same  with Federal  Reserve Act)

    In effect, Social Security benefits  are like  pensions to be given or
withheld at the discretion of  congress.
   6. Payroll deductions which a worker pays  (a  special kind  of "income tax")
do nothing more than qualify him for  consideration  as a recipient of a
charitable gift. His payments  do not  guarantee him anything. They do not
guarantee the amount  to be received, nor the duration of the gift. The
Congress can alter or  abolish the entire process at any time.     Justice  Hugo
L. Black   dissenting  in  the Nestor case, stated  that  the  whole S.S.thesis,
as expounded by the majority of the court,  is  that the government is giving
the participating citizen "something for nothing  and  Congress  can stop doing
so when  it  pleases".  He further  stated: "I cannot believe that any private
insurance  in America  would  be permitted to repudiate its  matured  contracts
with its policy holders who have regularly paid all the  premiums in  reliance
upon  the  good faith  of  the  company."Fleming  v Nestor,supra,Black
dissenting.    It was only a short time  after the Supreme court had revealed
that social S. funds  are;  "paid into the treasure like other internal revenue
generally, and  are not  earmarked  in  any way." that the S.S.A.  went  right
ahead publishing  literature proclaiming that payroll deductions   "are strictly
accounted for and kept separate from the general  funds of  the U.S.Treasury."
Quoted by Warren Shore,  Social  Security: The Fraud in Your Future, The
MacMillan Co. New York, 1975, p.23.

Literature  from  the  S.S.A. also continued to  talk  about  its "insurance"
plan, and the "contributions" which are "pooled" in a "trust fund". All of this
was deliberately misleading in view  of the Supreme court decisions cited above.
Had a private  insurance company  so grossly misrepresented its position in
this  manner, its officers probably would have been sent to jail.    Ever since
1935 the S.S.A. has laid such great emphasis on its "trust  fund" that  the
average citizen believes his benefits are paid  out  of this  fund.  The
Administration knows this is  not   true  since benefits are paid out of the
general treasury fund, it  therefore refers  to its so called trust fund as a
"reserve of  assets"  to back up the S.S. program.    What this "reserve fund"
amounts  to is  simply an accumulation of U.S. bonds which wouldn't  pay  the
liabilities  of  the  system even if they were to  be  cashed  in tomorrow.
Furthermore, a government bond is nothing more than  a claim  against the
American people for taxes not  yet  collected. This is also true of the
interest which must be paid on the bond. Neither  the bond, nor the interest to
be paid on it  constitutes an  "asset" in any real sense of the term.     For
a  government agency  to accumulate a quantity of the government  owned  bonds,
and call these a "reserve asset" is like a man writing himself  a bundle  of
I.O.U.'s and listing these as assets on his  financial statement to the bank.
People tend to think of a "trust fund"  as more or less liquid funds with an
available cash flow if  needed. The S.S.A. has no such funds. A majority of the
people know  this and  are commencing to complain.

(Comment.Roger. What is  this writer complaining about. don't the federal
government have equal powers as banks? Banks list notes as assets and they list
demand deposits  as  both  an asset and a liability. Wish I  had  it  so good.
What  one can't do with a good bookkeeping  system.Mortgages are assets even
tho they are paid off with notes. How can a  note be an asset if they are a
liability? Well they are obligations of the  United States and liabilities of
the Federal  reserve  bank. They are a first and paramount lien on the assets
of the  Federal reserve bank whose assets are notes and bonds. The only real
way one could rob a bank is if you took their furniture.)

 Unfortunately  for some, and tragically for others, the words of  Warren
Shore  describe  the real situation:    "obviously, there  is  no pool,just  as
there are no trust funds. Both words remain in  the S.S.  lexicon  not because
they are true, but because  they  help foster  the  public notion that S.S. is
like insurance  with  its premium  pools and trust funds regulated to support
the  promise made."  ibid.p 22.    Because all funds collected in the name  of
S.S. are never earmarked for any special use, they are  intermingled  and spent
each year like any other funds. This  means  that billions of dollars collected
by the S.S. A. in the early days of the  program were used during 1935 through
1945 to  help  finance the  military  requirements  of national  defense
incidental  to W.W.II.

 (Comment.Roger. The nation was not in peril)

Since  the war,  funds  collected in the name of S.S. have continued  to  be
spent  on all the miscellaneous appropriations of the  government including
foreign aid, salaries for nearly three million  federal employees,   and
various  regulatory  agencies  of   government.

((Comment Roger. Now do you see why fed. notes were made a  legal tender  for
all  debts? You paid your money in and  a  debt  was created.  They owed you.
Now it is legal for "them"  to  "tender" fed.  notes  in "payment". When S.S.
was first  enacted,  we  were dealing  in real money,why can't we get back the
real money.  Why, because  fed notes are "legal tender", of course.)

     In  recent years  there  has been considerable talk about  the  S.S.
System becoming  "insolvent"  and  getting close  to  "bankruptcy".  The
government  itself  is largely to blame  for  this  misconception because   it
has used this line to justify the gigantic  leap  in S.S.  taxes. They said
these increases were absolutely  necessary to  keep  the system "sound". At the
same time, the S.S.A.  has been  promising tremendous increases in "benefits" if
the  people would tolerate this new wave of increased taxes. In reality, what
Congress really accomplished was to create more resources for the general fund
of the Treasury for political giveaway programs. The scare  tactic of a
"bankrupt" S.S. system has been used to  minimize resistance to the new tax
gouging in the name of S.S.    The main thing to keep in mind is that S.S.
cannot go bankrupt in the ordinary sense of the term because it is able to
depend upon  the government  power  to raise revenue by compulsory  means
through taxes  rather than a trust fund such as insurance  companies  are
required  to have. As long as the people will allow  Congress  to "tax  and
tax, spend and spend, elect and elect, the  people  are too damn dumb to
understand" (according to Harry  Hopkins, Assistant  to Rooseveldt.)
 S.S. will continue to be a runaway  spending program.  The S.S. Board of
Trustees emphasized  the power  to tax as a secret weapon in a 1972 report to
Congress  by stating:  "because  compulsory  social insurance  is  assured  of
continuing  income...it  does not have to build up  the  kind  of reserves
that are necessary at all times in an institution  that cannot  count  on
current income to  meet  current  obligations."

[Disclaimer: I am not associated in any way with George Gordon or his school.
I apologize if anyone is offended at the "advertisish" tone; it was taken
verbatim from one of George's pamphlet mailings, and shows his flair for the
dramatic turn of phrase. But it certainly is true that more than ten years
after he started this, he's still on the outside, and Roger is on the inside.
A sobering thought - but you must, of course, draw your own conclusions.]


                     GEORGE GORDON'S SCHOOL OF COMMON LAW

 George Gordon is a teacher of courtroom strategy and procedure, a businessman
who taught himself to fight back in court when Big Brother put him out of
business nine years ago. To that end, he founded Barrister's Inne School of
Common Law in Boise, Idaho. As a result, the city of Boise (among other
things) rarely stops a car without a license plate. Since he left Boise in
1984, he has started a new school in Isabella, Missouri, introduced personal
tutoring classes, produced over 320 hours of videotaped lessons, traveled over
150,000 miles, and lectured in all 50 states. He is currently testing many
issues in court, publishing a newsletter, and has a nationwide Barter Exchange
and a working farm to show "How To Make $100,000 Annually on 25 Acres Or Less".
He has done all this, owing no income tax or state license taxes, without a
driver's license, car registration or insurance, without credit, loans, debt,
business permits or licenses, with no Social Security number or taxes, without
a marriage license or birth certificate, owing no military obligation, without
U.S. citizenship, without state citizenship or residency, and the list could
go on.

 George can tell you from personal experience that when you practice Exodus
23:32 in place of having a driver's license, Leviticus 19:35 in place of
having a bank account, or take your children out of the public schools and
teach them at home, you will meet with extreme opposition from the government
and its agents. So far, his program is working, and he is winning.

 The Basic Courtroom Strategy and Procedure is 100 hours of video that gives
the average man on the street the knowledge that is necessary to defend his
rights, both in and out of court. We personally train the teachers of this
course here on the farm, spending four intensive weeks teaching them how to
teach their own classes. The classes are also open to individuals wanting to
learn how to defend themselves and/or those who don't have a school available
locally.

 George also teaches small, semi-private tutoring classes on Taxes, Private
Business and Exchanges, Title 42 Civil Rights Violations, the above mentioned
class on farming, a class for "licensed professionals" who no longer wish to
be licensed, and many others.

 We here at the School observe the 759 Biblical Common Laws as our way of
life. We do not advocate nor teach anarchy, civil disobedience or racism.
Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread are celebrated here every spring,
and every fall we observe the Feast of Tabernacles. During both Feasts, there
are week-long classes for our friends here on the farm.

                                    COSTS

 The above Basic Course lasts four weeks. Each week costs one (1) ounce of
Gold, with Gold at 500 Federal Reserve Notes per ounce, or 500 FRN's. We don't
sell fish - we teach men how to fish! If the cost seems steep to you, sit down
and add up how much it could save you in the long run...


                               TUTORING CLASSES

 The very successful tutoring program initiated in 1985 is designed to address
specific problems, as opposed to the Basic Course which teaches a generalized
strategy. Whether you face unlawfully imposed taxes, divorce, loss of
children, a desire to change your lifestyle or pursue a chosen profession, or
defend yourself from abuse at the hands of government agents, we have a class
for you. Because George could never give anyone's problem full attention if he
taught large groups, we've limited the number of students in each weekly
session to nine (9). To assure yourself a class space, you must pre-register
with a 20% minimum deposit. The cost of each class per tutoring space is 2
ounces of Gold at 500 FRN's per ounce, or the equivalent in other substance
(Silver, Barter, etc.), or 1,000 FRN's. If you pay in advance in Gold, Silver
or FRN's, we offer a 10% discount from quoted figures. Wives can attend
classes wth husbands for half the quoted figures. Please read the Barter List,
as we do much pre-arranged trading to enable more people to learn. However, if
we lined up all the horses, chainsaws, mowers, etc., that have been promised
in trade and never delivered, we would have quite a parade! To help you avoid
paying the five times penalty for theft, we can deliver only after YOU do.

 Each class consists of George's tutoring and the Supreme Court decisions,
recissions and paperwork pertinent to that class. All classes start at 9am
Monday and continue until 5pm Friday.

 - Tax Classes

 Almost 350 people have taken one of these. The reason for their popularity?
They work! Of those who have attended, only nine (9) have been incarcerated,
and they didn't follow the strategy - they went out and hired lawyers to help
them lose. This averages out to a 2% failure rate for George's students, as
opposed to the 2% WIN RATE in tax cases with LAWYERS! Since we're all unique
and have unique situations, each and every plan has to be formulated specially
for each individual. Thus, these classes have very few participants, so we can
cover all details in advance. Over 80% of these students win out of court,
which is a stress-reducing victory in itself. If you plan ahead and get every
possible problem covered beforehand, there is no reason for court, jail or
loss of all your property.
 Also in this class: How to work for a corporation without being required to
have a Social Security Number. This is the narrow entry provided by the Feds
to being an individual, yet maintaining your present lifestyle. Two of
George's students have successfully tested the issue of religious objection
before the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, and a labor union.
 The first day is devoted entirely to Status. Only you can decide what status
you wish to have, after careful examination of the State's encroachment into
our lives, their control of all facets of our lives, and the ramifications of
same.
 We would like to help you - help us by calling BEFORE an indictment!


 - $100,000 on 25 Acres

 How to make $100,000 anually on as little as four (4) acres, even in an
economically depressed area. Sound too good to be true? This class will show
you how to acquire the necessary land and equipment; how to finance it without
interest, credit checks or down payments; how to select the proper location,
and teach you the Biblical Common Laws pertaining to land acquisition and
usage, so you can avoid the failures of today's "agribusinessmen". There are
3,000 farmers successfully using portions of this program today. George has
taken the best of a program designed by a Professor Emeritus at Tuskegee
University, and combined it with his own experience in "unconventional
farming", the land laws he teaches, and practical marketing.
 You'll learn how to locate and keep customers and how to develop an organic
market and grow the crops necessary to make your $100,000/year within five (5)
years of the day you start. You'll learn about square foot gardening, raised
beds, organic plant protection, cost projection analysis, and how to raise
capital. The marketing aspects can be carried over into any other business you
may have. For you men who complain about the non-support and non-participation
of your wives, this is one class they can easily understand! Why not send your
wife to class, and let her learn how to earn? Everyone is entitled to be
wealthy. And a wealthy individual is one who has the ability to do exactly as
they wish. Is there anyone out there who doesn't want to be satisfied with
their life?
 All who attend this class may work with us on the farm for hands-on
experience. Remember, people always have to eat, and with the average American
eating over 143 pounds of just the eleven major fresh vegetables per year,
this is the time to cash in!

 - Private Business and Exchange

 Trading is an old industry that has acquired a modern flair. This class
teaches the economics of bartering, how it's an inflation fighter, taxes and
barter, how to put together a trade, and how to trade with ANYONE.
 During the last Depression, there was a 25% unemployment rate, a shortage of
Federal Reserve Notes to conduct business, and people were "reduced" to
barter. What isn't said is that there was 75% employment, we don't need FRN's
to transact, and barter has been around long before the Federal Reserve was
even thought of. If we are to maintain our standard of living during the next
great Depression, we must know how to obtain the necessities of life outside
of employment and the Federal Reserve System, and learn to use barter to our
advantage instead of being forced into it. If you earn $20,000 a year and are
laid off (or experience a 25% decline in "income"), your standard of living
declines 25%. But if you learn to trade $5,000 a year, and make three trades
for a pickup, furniture, and appliances... if you lose 25% of your "income",
your standard of living does NOT suffer!
 It all sounds simple, but everywhere we look we see a woeful lack of
understanding in barter. We have been using the Fed all our lives. Sears,
Penny's and Standard Oil we understand, but Gold, Silver, honey, wheat, corn
and oil are over our heads? Before you are forced to trade under adverse
conditions, you should learn how to do it right!
 This class focuses on trade techniques with merchants, contractors, retailers
and others. It includes public vs. private business, income taxes, licensing,
and the Common Law as it relates to private business. George will show you how
to establish a private business and have NO income, NO license, and NO tax
liability! This class is especially important for those who have rescinded
their Social Security Numbers. Remember, you can barter the tuition!


 - Civil Rights (Title 42)

 In the past three years, we have had these classes full of individuals who
have succeded, and will succeed, in obtaining redress for injustices suffered
at the hands of police, attorneys, judges, municipalities, etc. George himself
won a Title 42 suit in Idaho, settling out of court with the defendants in
Gold, and a number of other suits filed by George are currently in litigation.
But perhaps the most important thing to come out of these classes is the ever
increasing number of students who are filing and WINNING suits against persons
who have violated their civil rights.
 Title 42 of the United States Code, sec. 1983, is that section of Federal law
which deals specifically with civil rights violations and their rectification.
It is the ONLY way for anyone who is not a Citizen of the United States to
gain redress of greivance in cases of civil rights violations. George will
teach you what it covers, its applications, whether or not you have a
legitimate greivance, how much to ask for, when to settle out of court, AND
how to set up civil rights violations. There are five (5) rules that MUST be
adhered to, or the Court will dismiss your case in a heartbeat.
 While the most common use of Title 42 Sec 1983 is to extract direct monetary
compensation for violated rights, a number of these suits filed against a
defendant or group of defendants cause another, indirect effect, but one which
is just as deadly to the opposition: Their insurance companies inform them
that they are no longer covered, or that if they continue, they will either
lose their coverage or have their rates go through the roof! Learn how to
find the secondary insurance companies that cities and counties keep hidden
and tap the unlimited financial resources of municipalities which previously
had the limits of their primary insurance carriers imposed upon you. Protect
your Rights against Wrongdoing.


 - Professionals

 This class was formerly called the Doctor's Class, but now called the
Professional's Class, because it's for all professionals - architects,
plumbers, chiropractors, contractors, dentists, etc. Learn the basic
procedures for disenfranchisement, or starting or continuing a generally
licensed business without a license. Learn how the State gained control over
you via licensing, how to abrogate that control and how to avoid undue
harrassment simultaneously!


 - Survival

 This new class covers sixty-four (64) life-threatening problems that will be
facing us in the years to come. Among the subjects covered are: Family Bible
records, birth certificates, marriage licenses, divorce contracts, midwifery,
home homeopathic care, home chiropractic care, poisonous bites, herbs and
remedies, how to plan and grow a basic herb garden, how to grow your own first
aid kit, home schooling, inoculations, synthetic vs. natural fabrics, grain
storage, amino acid protein balance, and longevity of stored goods. Learn how
to build your own lifeboat, and face the future with confidence.

 To: Officer
 RE: Ticket #____________
 CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE AND DEMAND

 NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that, accused ___ ___, takes the following exceptions
to your _____ __, 199__ issuance of a NOTICE OF PARKING VIOLATION # __ ______.
The California Vehicle Code #22502 is cited as a Code of Regulation for curb
parking.

 C.V.C. 17459, UNDER DIVISION 9, ARTICLE 4. SERVICE OF PROCESS STATES:

 "The acceptance by a resident of this state of a certificate of ownership or
a certificate of registration of any motor vehicle or any renewal thereof,
issued under the provisions of this code, shall constitute the consent of the
person that the service of summons may be made upon him within or without this
state, in any action brought in the courts of this state upon a cause of
action arising in this state out of the ownership or operation of the
vehicle."

 A parking violation ticket to appear or deposit bail is a summons in civil
procedure.

 The code in section 17459 states that a certificate of registration
constitutes the consent by the person of service of summons to a CAUSE OF
ACTION.

 The Notice of Parking Violation #________  does not state a "CAUSE OF
ACTION", as the Code of Civil Procedure defines "action", and what constitutes
an action, and the Civil Code defines the condition of an action.

 An ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE WILL BE FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT, along with a
subpoena for your presence.  Your failure to appear will constitute a contempt
of Court (see Code of Civil Procedure).  Failure to bring the injured body
forward for examination will constitute grounds for contempt charges against
YOU!

 If the Notice of Parking Violation #_____________ is on an account number,
then bring forth an accounting for examination, as it is a civil matter.  As
an agent for the D.M.V. you have made a conclusion of law to which I have
taken exception.

 Said notice is an attempt to extort funds from me by inverting the burden of
proof without evidence that a crime has been committed in violation of Rules
2, 3, 4, and 7 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

 Since you are an executive officer, you have broken the law by impersonating
a judicial officer by levying a bail against me.

 Title 18 United States Code, Section 241, provides that..."any person who
goes on the highway in disguise to prevent or hinder the free exercise and
enjoyment of any right so secured by law...shall be fined not more than
$10,000.00 or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.

 The reference to the disguise in the foregoing section is in reference to
someone impersonating an officer of the law.  You are impersonating an officer
of the law by declaring that to be law which IS NOT law because you are an
executive officer performing a judicial function, and further, you have no
victim or injured party to sign a complaint.

 Further, Title 18, United States Code, Section 242, provides for one or more
persons who, under color of law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom,
willfully subjects any inhabitant of any state, territory, or district to the
deprivation of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution,
or laws of the United States...shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or
imprisoned not more than one year or both.

 Title 18, United States Code, Section 242, with its color of law provision,
gives a cause of action to apply Title 18, United States Code, Section 241,
because Section 241 needs two persons in disguise and Section 242 provides the
second person under color of law as the "QUASI SUMMONS" mentioned herein
implies that a judge in the Municipal Court is acting in concert to commit an
overt act of fraud and extortion for conversion.

 Demand is now upon you to dismiss this action within ten (10) days from
receipt of this Notice and Demand. Unless, by appropriate return response to
this Notice, the existence of some other factual basis to further compel an
appearance in this matter is shown.  No other will be deemed necessary by the
undersigned accused.

 This Notice will serve as a basis for an action at law to commence in the
United States Court by diversity pursuant to Rule 7 (a) and (c), and Rule 81
(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by the jurisdiction provided in
Title 42, United States Code, Sections 1983 and 1985; Title 28, United States
Code, Sections 1331 and 1343 and others with Title 18, United States Code
Sections 241, 242, 872, 1621, 1622, and 1623 providing for the administration
of the penalties upon failure to comply with the terms now on demand by this
Notice.

 I suggest that you give me written notice, at the address listed below, of
such dismissal as demanded herein within ten (10) days to avoid any
unnecessary complications which may arise in court from further action on this
matter from damages stated herein and other such violations and damages that
apply, or will apply as future results will occur and be applied.

 SEND YOUR RESPONSE TO:

           [address]

 Dated: ______________________


[Here's another.]

 CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE

 TAKE NOTICE!  THIS CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE is being given you as the only legal
warning you will receive.  You would not be receiving it had you not failed to
satisfactorily identify yourself in response to my timely and valid request
pursuant to the UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, the CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA and
various State and Federal Statutes, including the Federal Privacy Act of 1974,
and Title 42, section 1983, and others, and relevant U.S. Supreme Court
Decisions, including Miranda v. Arizona, binding on you if you are indeed, as
you claim to be, a public servant under oath to support the same and acting
under color of law while violating my rights, which I claim and demand at all
times, never waiving any right for any cause or reason at any time.  These
rights include the right to travel.

 Therefore: YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT - ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND
WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW - YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL OF
YOUR CHOICE.  It is within your discretion to release me without further
proceeding.  To fail to do so will irreparably harm me and will result in your
prosecution.  I hereby deny your jurisdiction over my person and property, and
demand that you prove such jurisdiction within your own agency, before your
superiors at a docketed administrative hearing on the record, and that I be
provided with an opportunity to appeal any administrative determinations made
in any ex parte hearings of which I have not received timely and proper legal
notice.  I demand that you exhaust all of your administrative remedies before
seeking relief in an appeal to the Courts.

 You are hereby put on Notice that Title 18, United States Code, section 241
provides that any person who goes on the highway in disguise to prevent or
hinder the free exercise and enjoyment of any right so secured by law (such as
the rights to life, liberty, and property) shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.  Penalties exist under
California law as well.

 The reference to the disguise is in reference to someone impersonating an
officer of the law. You are impersonating an officer of the law by declaring
that to be law which is not law and you have no victim or injured party to
sign a complaint. Also, if you were not in disguise, you would not have
refused to give the information that I requested in order to be sure that you
were not an imposter with an evil intent or motive.  Highwaymen have used
disguises of various sorts, including pretending to be government agents, in
the past, and will undoubtedly do so in the future, in order to get their
victims to drop their guard.  Be assured, my guard will not be dropped but
upon your production of facts supporting your claims, the knowledge of which
is my right which I demand.  Until such due process is rendered me, you are
abridging my right to travel, an inseparable part of my right to liberty.

 If you are indeed who you are claiming to be, by your own claim, a member of
the EXECUTIVE BRANCH of government, you have no business in issuing any
"summons" or judicially commanding either my person, my possessions, or my
freedom to do anything beyond your limited executive powers.  You may be under
the mistaken impression that you are protected by your qualified immunity.
You are not.

 Pursuant to Davis v. Scherer, 82 L.Ed.2d 139, 104 S.Ct.547 (1984); Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,818 (1982); and the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of
Harlow in Copeoman v. Reed, 754 F.2nd 1512,1514 (1985) this NOTICE serves to
"clearly establish" my rights (including my rights to travel and to due
process) which you are bound to under ))40300-40604 of the Vehicle Code to be
brought, without delay before the court.  The above cited cases stand for the
position that a State official's violation of state regulation, after an
individual "clearly establishes" his rights at the time of the alleged
violation, that official loses his qualified immunity from suit under 42 USCS
)1983.

 A plaintiff who seeks damages for violation of constitutional or statutory
rights may overcome the defendant official's qualified immunity only by
showing that those rights were clearly established at the time of the conduct
at issue.  Davis v. Scherer, 82 L.Ed.2d 139,151.

  Though the State of California may have a STATUTE purportedly giving
judicial powers to the executive branch of government, it could not have been
Lawfully granted, and it, (if there is one), MUST BE NULL AND VOID!  This is
not just a naked assertion as I rely upon the following reasons:

 Firstly, the Supreme Law of the Land in the Third Article of the United
States Constitution states that, "The judicial powers shall be vested in the
courts"!  It makes no provision otherwise as it did not say that, "the
judicial powers are vested with the courts and CERTAIN OF THE EXECUTIVE
BRANCHES."  This Belligerant Claimant in Person DEMANDS ALL HIS RIGHTS.  This
includes the Constitutional Right to a "Separation of Powers":

 "The United States shall guarantee to every State of the Union, a republican
form of government..." Article IV, Section IV, United States Constitution

 And;

 "The powers of state government are legislative, executive, and judicial.
Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the
others except as permitted in this Constitution." Article III, Section 3,
Constitution of the State of California

   Clearly, the executive branch DOES NOT have any of the judicial powers to
issue summons.  An "executive summons" conforms to the WRITS OF ASSISTANCE
which so incensed our forefathers as to require them to willingly lay down
their lives in a war against King George III, so as to divest themselves of
such tyrannical bonds. Any intention or attempt to TRANSFER POWER from one
branch of government to another is a flagrant violation of the Law. "Any
fundamental or basic power necessary to government cannot be delegated."
Wilson v. Philadelphia School District, 113 ALR 1401 No powers are more
fundamental or basic to our American system of government than the
legislative, executive, and judicial, because in every body politic these
three branches, however divided, are the very roots of any form of government.
As you have just been informed, these fundamental powers cannot Lawfully be
transferred one to another.

 As was observed above, although California MIGHT have a statute purporting to
give the executive branch certain judicial powers, it came without the proper
authority to do so, and however well it has been established by precedents
otherwise, we must note that: "If the legislature clearly misinterprets a
Constitutional provision, the frequent repetition of the wrong will not create
a right."  Amos v. Mosley, 77 SO 619. Also see Kingsley v. Metril, 99 NW 1044
Any statute or branch of government co-mingling the basic powers of one
exercising some of the power of the other, must be seen as a clear
misinterpretation of the Supreme Law of the Land, because:

        "Where the meaning of the Constitution is clear and unambiguous, there
can be no resort to construction to attribute to the founders a purpose or
intent NOT MANIFEST IN ITS LETTER." Norris v. Baltimore 192 A 531

 And;

 "No legislative act contrary to the Constitution can be valid. To deny this
would be to affirm that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the
servant is above the master; that the representatives of the people are
superior to the people; that men, acting by virtue of powers may do not only
what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.  It is not to be
supposed that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of
the people to substitute their will to that of their constituents.  A
Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by judges as fundamental law.
If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, the
Constitution is to be preferred to the statute." A.Hamilton, Federalist Papers
#78 See also Warning v. The Mayor of Savannah, 60 Georgia, P.93;  First Trust
Co. v. Smith, 277 SW 762,  Marbury v. Madison, 2 L Ed 60; and Am.Juris. 2d

[What you've read so far is the parts that deal with the Executive Branch and
the Separation of Powers. Other sections deal with the Appearance Before a
Magistrate. The Notice ends with:]

 THEREFORE, TAKE NOTICE that I claim all of my rights at all times never
waiving any of my legal or Constitutional rights at any time.  I object to
being detained, questioned, or searched.  I object to my person, my
automobile, or my real or personal property being searched.  I demand counsel
of my own choice before answering any questions or making any other statement.
I demand that you give probable cause for this arrest, and produce a 4th
Amendment warrant. I deny any and all jurisdiction over my person, and demand
that you or your agency exhaust all administrative remedies available to you
before taking any action in the courts.  I therefore demand a docketed
administrative hearing on the record before your agency, with counsel of my
own choice, scheduled so as to give me enough time to properly prepare my
case.

        Further, United States Code, Title 18, section 242 provides for
 one or more persons who, under color of law, statute, ordinance,
 regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any inhabitant of any state,
 territory, or district to the deprivation of rights, privileges, or
 immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the
 United States...shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not
 more than one year or both.

 Title 18, United States Code, section 242, with it's color of law
 provision, gives a cause of action to apply Title 18, section 241,
 United States Code, because section 241 needs two persons in disguise
 and section 242 provides the second person under color of law as the
 Notice that you issued implies a judge in the Municipal Court is
 acting in concert with you to commit an overt act of fraud and
 extortion for conversion.

 Demand is upon you to withdraw the invalid Notice #_____ within ten (
 10) days from receipt of this Notice and Demand or Action will
 commence in the United States District Court pursuant to Rule 7(a) and
 (c) of the criminal rules of procedure by the jurisdiction provided in
 Title 42, United States Code, sections 1983 and 1985; Title 28, U.S.C.
 sections 1331 and 1343 and others with Title 18, U.S.C., sections 241,
 242, 872, 1621, 1622, and 1623 providing for the administration of the
 penalties.

 I suggest that you give me written notice of such withdrawal as
 demanded herein within ten (10) days of your receipt of this Notice
 and Demand or action will commence against you for damages stated
 herein and other such violations and damages that apply to this matter
 or will apply as future results will occur and be applied.

 Ignorance of this letter and contempt for the rights and sovereignty
 of this inhabitant of California are folly on your part. Be advised
 that I am ready with papers prepared right now to file actions in
 Federal District Court in forma pauperis against you, should you fail
 to withdraw your invalid Notice within ten (10) days. This
 Constructive Notice is to inform you that those papers will be filed
 against you and other pending conspirators in this conspiracy and
 fraud against this sovereign natural individual inhabitant of the
 state of California, who has rescinded all contracts with the United
 States federal government, the State of California, and each of it's
 political subdivisions, thereby establishing himself as a freeman
 under the organic national Constitution of the Republic of the United
 States of America who is NOT a "person required" to have license
 plates or other registration evidence displayed on his vehicle.

Sample Response to Administrative Summons

date

your name
and address

name of person issuing summons
and their address

 Dear _______________,


 I am in receipt of a document labelled "Form # _______", purporting to be a
Collection Summons, which states in part, "In the matter of the tax liability
of [your name]", "The Commissioner of Internal Revenue to [your name]" and
claims, "You are hereby summoned and required to appear before..." and to
"bring all documents and records you possess...in reference to the following
years:". Enclosed is a copy of the aforementioned document.

 I note that there is no seal of any court on this document, nor was it issued
personally by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; nor does it even state
that it came from an agency or department under the authority of the United
States of America, the United States, the United States Code or of any State
government.

 I note your signature on the bottom where you are designated an "issuing
officer", but the document does not specify your specific delegation of
authority from the Commissioner to issue or serve such a document upon me; nor
does it state specifically how I became subject to the commands of the
Commissioner.

 I note further that this document purportedly requires that I appear, give
testimony and "produce books, records and papers" for your examination.

 If this document were issued under the lawful directive of a federal or State
government, I would think that it would be so indicated on the document. If it
were not, and you are not affiliated with the government, then I have no
obligation to you.

 If we presume that you are, in fact, affiliated with the government, you come
under the directive of the Supreme Court of the United States of America, and
I require more information to ascertain if you are within the bounds of your
authority. For this, I rely upon the Supreme Court decision of Federal Crop
Insurance Corporation v Merrill, 332 US 380,384 (1947) which states:

   "Whatever the form in which the Government functions, anyone entering
   into an arrangement with the Government takes the risk of having accurately
   ascertained that he who purports to act for the Government stays within the
   bounds of his authority...and this is so even though as here the agent
   himself may have been unaware of the limitations upon his authority."

 Therefore, if you believe that I have some obligation to appear and produce
personal papers, I require verification of your authority, via the following
documents, before I do so:

 1) The documents of determination that I am one who comes within the
authority of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and within the purview of
the "Internal Revenue Code", whereby I am required and compelled to waive my
fundamental rights to the security of my papers and effects and compelled to
be a witness against myself.

 2) The documents of determination that I am one who does not have these
rights as protected under the 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution of
the United States of America.

 3) The documents that identify the facts used in making those determinations
and show specifically how I waived those rights or how those rights were lost.

 4) The documents that identify the law (legal authority) on which those
determinations were based.

 5) The delegations of authority from the Commissioner to you which allow you
to serve such a document as this upon me.

 6) If the delegation order does not specifically name you personally, then I
require your personal documents of appointment to this position to which has
ben delegated the authority of the Commissioner.

 I require a minimum of five (5) days prior to any meeting to review the
documents you provide; therefore, the meeting date you set is not appropriate
at this time.

 Upon receipt of the above documents, I will make an appropriate
determination. If the above allegations are clearly shown to be true, I will
make an appropriate search of my personal effects, and bring any relevant
"books or papers" with me when the next meeting date is scheduled.

 If you do not respond within thirty (30) days with the above documentation,
the presumption will be established that you did err, that I maintain all my
rights and you have no basis to demand that I waive those rights.

 If you are a properly authorized and delegated officer of the United States
of America or one of the several States, I apologize for any inconvenience,
but I am sure you are aware of the large number of criminals claiming to be
government officials who attempt to defraud others.

 I will be expecting your earliest possible response with the documents
requested. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

 Sincerely,

Another "Fireside Chat"
(does this make me the anti-FDR? gads, i hope not.)

Administrivia: As you may have noticed, the Thunder Island address no
longer exists since the sysop has recently been the recipient of many
lucrative job offers, and my congratulations and thanks for his support
are due him. The list will continue at this address for the foreseeable
future (schirado@lab.cc.wmich.edu).

I'm certainly not doing much for myself in the way of actively removing
my own personal chains these days. Being freshly dropped out of high
school, with a life-long hatred of school (with Catholic nuns throughout
most of it, no less!), I look back and wonder how it was that ever
knew the difference between learning and indoctrination, and am amazed
that I didn't surrender completely to nihilism. Even as I explore this
strange world of grownups, my brief period of practical applications of
law reminds me that if you want to defend Rights, you have to do it to
the utmost of your ability, for as Churchill reminds us,

    If you will not fight for the right when you can easily win
    without bloodshed; if you will not fight when your victory
    will be sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment
    when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and
    only a small chance of survival.  There may even be a worse
    case: you may have to fight when there is no hope of victory,
    because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.

At this stage of my life, I still have too much growing up to do to be
able to properly defend my rights where in counts, in court. But I
share this information whenever I have the opportunity; I give away
disks packed full of the information to whoever expresses interest; I
upload it to BBS's, if the sysop expresses interest; and I save whatever
information I find that I consider worth keeping. I guess the best way
to describe me would be "librarian", or maybe "archivist". A quiet,
unassuming, non-threatening, everyday individual, whose passion for words,
language and the creativity and invention of the unfettered mind leads him
to preserve whatever scraps of information he thinks may be of use for the
future. And occasionally handing out a pamphlet to random strangers.

I consider this mailing list to be only moderately successful in that it's
really "preaching to the converted", as it were. At the moment, there are
four of you subscribing. In all, I received five requests for information
about the mailing list from other folks, who never responded to the info
I sent. Somewhat surprising, given the broad range of advertising it got,
but certainly easier on me, given my lack of dedicated smart list software
here..

Best wishes,

yr moderator
