Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  I took my family on vacation 
and then spent two nights in San Francisco with my wife to celebrate an 
anniversary.  I managed to skip through the tape, but I have not watched 
it end to end yet.

What I did see convinced me that my money was well spent.  It is a very 
heavy German film that I am pleased to add to my collection.  

If I recall your original description of the video, I agree that it does 
leave a little to be desired.  I think the flaw is that the submissive 
woman is .. well.. asleep/un-interesting.  She looks like she was given a 
lot of drugs so she could handle being whipped.  Some other good German 
tapes are as harsh, but the submissive gives herself to the punishment 
with more willingness.  Since youre original Net messages was in the WS 
newsgroup, the one WS scene I saw  was sort of tame.  (I wanted to see 
the Doma squat over the girls face and spray her.  Then force the sub to 
clean her up.)  The fisting looked harsh, but I never saw full 
penetration.  I liked the female Doma.  German sounds harsh even when 
spoken in neutral tones.  Her use of the bamboo rod was wonderful.  I did 
not realize such a short, thick rod could raise such welts.  Her constant 
pokeing with the rod was a nice touch.

Dont take my comments as critizism.  I am pleased with the tape.  In 
fact, I have just sent off a order for another tape, "Caca Boudine".  
Although I am not into Scat, I do like fisting and WS.  Your description 
seemed to indicate that this was the tape to have.  If you know of 
another tape that seems to fit my interest, let me know so I can change 
my order.

Thanks Again,

Bob

        This is the second calling for "THE GATHERING".  This posting is
looking for the "Advanced Spiritual Beings" that are needed for the
building of the Pyramid.

        If you have had visions or dreams of the pyramid and you are
an advanced soul who feels called to this project please contact me
as soon as possible via E-Mail.

        To all those who don't understand this I am sorry for taking
up your space, but it is the only way to reach the ones I need.  Please
forgive any inconvenience and go on with your lives in peace.

>Dear Ryan:
        
        Let me first explain the task and who I am seeking and you can see
if it fits you.  A pyramid will rise out of the Arizona desert for the purpose
of physical and spiritual healing and enlightenment.  A school will be built
next to it to guide students into a connection with their higher selves, 
wherein all answers lie.
        This will be the first of many pyramids which will go up all around the
world for the purpose of global unity and raising of the consciousness level
of all mankind.  These pyramids will serve as beacons to the evolution of
mankind.
        This is not a cult or a religion and has no dogma attached.  It is 
strictly about spirituality.  I am searching for eleven advanced spiritual 
beings whose purpose it is to work on this project.  They will know who they 
are and will by the cornerstone of the pyramid.  Once the project is started 
I will encourage as many as want to to be involved as there will be plenty
of work for everyone on a project of this magnitude.
        If this sounds like what you have been called to let me know.
Peace,
Lorri O:)

        Location is not problem.  I am dealing with people from all around 
the world from New Zealand to France and back again.  What I need to know
is what you have felt about this project.  Have you had visions or dreams of
it, if so for how long?  How would you like to be involved, at what level.
Do you feel that you are one of the eleven I seek, or do you want to be
involved once the council is formed and others are needed to help.
        The cornerstone is the core group which is the council.  They are the
13 advanced spiritual beings who came to this planet to accomplish this
project.  All else will branch out once their work is started.

Your message came to me at 3:35 a.m. and that is odd because my time

        I don't know what your dream means, as I do not interpret dreams for
people.  If you want to learn about it you must meditate for the answer, as
it lies within.

>Dear Hamlet:

        I can guide you, but you must help yourself.  You must find the inner
turmoil and deal with it.  That is what is causing these dreams.  Violence is
not the answer now nor will it ever be, yet you have a lot of anger within.
Holding onto anger eats away at the spirit and causes the angry person
much more pain and suffering than those who they are angry with.

        Each of us must build our spirituality from the foundations up.  
Without a firm foundation the house will fall and hurt whoever is standing 
near.  It is not
an easy task, but one worth undertaking, for there is no one in this world
more important than you are to yourself.  When you leave this body you take
all of who you are with you including any unresolved anger or other negative
feelings.  This is one of the reasons it is so important to get the emotions
under control, for if you are not controlling your emotions you are being 
controlled
by them and as a leaf on the wind have no control over which direction you
go.

        I will be here to help and guide, but you must do the work....
