Re: What would you like to see here.


Hi everyone, this is Alison's dad.  I have noticed that some of you are
looking in other areas than the Teen Echo.  What kind of Echos would you like
to see here.  Alison is really into the Teen Echo but I am sure she would want
to offer other areas for some of you if you are interested.

Either let her know or let me know and I or she will see if it is available. I
have noticed that there are hundreds of Echos available.  Let us know.


                                Tim

Hey Jeremy, What's up?

Hi! Um is your dad upset or something?

with sex

Say what?

hehe he thought you were talking about sex

Can you explain?

you know where 2 people become "intimite?"

No I mean what is bondage!

When 2 people become intimate in crazy ways.

Crazy ways?

Have you ever ridden on the bus?

huh?? no

I feel so close to you... would you like to talk on the phone?

Because the State of California has ruled that I am fully rehabilitated.

you are strange....

Do you have any pictures of this "bondage" thing?

uh... gee... Gawd you're STILL thinking about that?

Have you and your father discussed this?

what are you talking about..

This desire you have to be tied up and beaten into submission by a piece of
cheese?

what?

does you father discipline you?

no

NEVER?

no

does he touch you?

Re: What would you like to see here.

Hi Mike, Alison's dad here.  You noticed that he is a little strange.  Thats
why we blocked him from using the board.  Alison likes good users like you. I
have left his name on the board on purpose to keep him off at least while he
is using his real name.

He tried to log on several times by using different names but we caught him
when he did it.  We locked those names off also.  The board is now fully
functional and wanting new users.  Spread this board's phone number around to
your friends, we want them on.

the full message editor, that wayy it's easier to work. Just a thought. =)

Ate' Logo!

Sysop breaking in for a chat:

hi!

hello there! how are you?

me? Fine, how are you? =)

hey who's this jeremy guy?

um. Some little perv. why?

well he seems to be the main topic of discussion... and to apease my
curiosity.

uuuuuuuuuu........ okay... How long have you been on?

about 9 minutes

hehehe sorry. Have  you checked out TEEN echo?

no not yet...

aw, it's a pretty cool echo, but watch out for the moderator, he's tough

what does he modrerate?

The echo. =)

ohh, I Must be confused,,, well anyways is that a message base?

yeah, it's number 20

ok I will look and view the fine message base you have ste up.. what is
discussed on there?

Anything, it doesn't have a topic, it's just a place for people to talk,
mostly

What do they talk about? TEEN stuff I assume?

yeah, anything, life, friends, oy/girlfriends, parents, food, anything

are they very accepting of new or different posters?

of course! why what would you post on there?????

well I have what one would call a diverse life style.

HEH?

Don't concern yourself... can you meet people on there?

depends, TEEN is world wide, I don't think you'd want to meet someone in New
York, would you?

I would love too they have more clubs there than here.

What kimd of clubs?

well ones that deal with different lifestyles.

*SIGH* Whatever...

Can I have my own message base?

no

why?

Because I don't make them up. I don't know who does, I just know that I can
get different ones.

make a local one and i will moderate it

I said I don't make them up

can I buy one?

You don't buy them

how do you get them?

When you're a SysOp, you can sign up for different ones

Do you have to run Windows?

no, DOS is fine

ok umm... well I have a PC Jr. will DOS 2.1 work?

I think so, I don't know much about comp. BTW, what school do you go to?

I atrtend Del ORo High School.

I didn't think there was a Del Oro Highschool

There is it is located in Walnut Creek

aw, I gotta go, bye
