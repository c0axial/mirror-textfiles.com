What we did here is posed as a magazine journalist and interviewed
some local sysops regarding hackers. This was inspired by an old
Freaker's Bureau Incorporated article written by SaTaN. Enjoy. 
 
+-+-+ Part 1: Hellfire BBS (510)449-1359 +-+-+

GOD decides to speak with you...

hey! hello...

Hi there! I'm Mike Serengeti, I'm writing an article for Diablo Magazine.

oh..uh...could you call back in about ...10 minutes..i have a science proj.
to finish..

I can wait if you like.
Who am I speaking to?

Jim Scott...ok..hold on..i am afraid you have to finish the new user log on
stuff before i can validated you so you can look around..

Alright, no problem.
/q
Chat Aborted...

 C-ya l8r


Time Left: [00:25:33] (?=Help)
Main Menu : C

Why should you wake the GREAT Shai'Tan?
:Hello?


Getting Shai'Tan to chat with you ... WAIT!

<<<=>>><<<=>>><<<=>>><<<=>>>

GOD decides to speak with you...

yes?

Hi, are you finished with your science project? I'm writing an article for
Diablo magazine and I was wondering if I could interview you as an east bay
sysop.

hold on please..sure

Alright, thanks. What school do you go to?

i go to William Mendenhall Middle School

Can you hang on a second?

ya sure

Okay, I'm back. This article mostly focuses on hackers and whatnot relating
to the recent Monte Vista incident. What is your opinion of hackers?

um...well..i don't like them i mean..my friends bbs got hacked and it wiped
out his hard drive.so if i could i would have them all arrested..

What is your estimate on the number of hackers or hacker boards in the east
bay?

um..near maybe a 100

What do you think we can do to eliminate them?

i have no idea..

From what I understand there's a whole east bay hacker subculture, including
fashion and slang. How would a hacker dress or talk?

i wouldn't know i've never met or talk with one...

Would you say there's a lot of pornography on the information superhighway?

yes i would...my dad works at INTEL so i'm on the net a lot and i see a lot
of GIF's

What would these pictures contain? Sexual intercourse, bondage etc?

the only ones i've looked at had like...dragons,warroirs,and other
non-pornagraphic things in them...

Alright just a few more questions. After the recent incident in Oaklahoma,
how do you as a sysop react to the numerous anarchy and bomb information
that is available to you?

personaly i hate it..it teachs kids how to make bombs and other illegal
things and i will not have anthing like that on my board

Can you, personally, get bomb instructions off the computer?

..er...yes.

Is this type of information widely available?

i've only seen it on boards out of califonia..i saw one board that had a
whole file area for anarchy.

Have you ever built one of these bombs?

no and i don't plan to any where in the future

Do you see a lot of this stuff being passed around locally?

yes.

High school students mostly?

no maybe in high schools but i mostly see in in middle schools

IS there a lot of pornography being traded too?

yes.

Excuse me, sorry for the caps on "is". So do you know where I could obtain
some of these pictures?

yes...but since i'm not sure your not a cop or involved with the police i'm
am not at liberty to give you that information

That would be entrapment and illegal on my part, if I was a member of a law
enforcement agency. You can remain totally anonymous to this interview, if
you wish.

i'm sorry i've seen a cop going around looking for pornography,anarchy and
ELiTE files...

Sorry to ask, I'm just researching information for the article. What are
"elite" files?

illegal files...say if you d/l a game and it was already regestered..that
would be ELiTE because it should have not been regestered until you send in
money.

Tell me more about this. These are copyright violations, correct?

yes

You see a lot of this going on too?

yes..there are some boards that are only ELiTE.

How would you identify an "elite" board?

well if you ever even got in and went to the file section and listed the
files most of them would have little pictures or logos above the describing
text

Can you elaborate on this?

i'm sorry i'm not much for righting..i'd rather read
writing...exuse me...
um...i've decided to tell you some of the bbses that have gif's...

Do you call the "Leather Rose" BBS?

no never heard of it

Are you a Caca Boudine fan?

never heard of it

So what are these bbses?

um..virtual images..the pit..under the stairs..seth able's bbs the dark
side,i have a few although i was in the procese of deleting those particular
gifs that contain adult pictures or text,metal works,blud rush is ELiTE, the
pit is elite,um...the bbs that is starting LORDnet has gif's...Great Mutant
Vally has adult gifs and text although you must be over 18 and have voice
varifacation to get access....thats all of the ones i know.

Would you happen to have any of these bondage pictures online?

i don't have a online viewer..but i think i didn't finish erasing all of the
adult gif's before you called..i could probaly d/l them for you.

What do these pictures show? Sexual intercourse, spanking, etc?

i didn't install the viewer that is in the file section..i have no use for
such pictures

How do you feel about the Jason Thomas tragedy?

..uh...er...who is that...forgive me i don't watch the news..

A 13 year old walnut creek boy met a man named Leighton Hinkley over the
computer. After they met in person the boy was raped by the 2 men and left in
a ditch bound and gagged with a 3 gigabyte harddisk in his rectum.

ugh....nasty! i hope they find them and put them in jail and lose the key!

Well, unfortunately they are still at large.

uh....how far is walnut creek?

Excuse me?

do you know how far walnut creek is from livermore?

Not very, why?

ugh...i wanted to know if i should lock my doors and windows at
night....there was already a stabbing across the park from my house...

Was the stabbing computer-related?

no...just a girl friend that got pissed at her boyfriend..

Does she have any bondage pictures?

huh? i have no idea...geez...how should i know?

Just curious. Well let's see, you mentioned that you lived in livermore, if
you would like I could send you a copy of Diablo with the interview included?

sorry i ain't giving out my address....are you going to print EVERY thing
we're saying?

Of course not. I am only using this to see where the computer users of the
east bay stand.

oh...could you edit out say about the last 18 lines?

This conversation is not going to appear. Legally we can not print this until
we've confirmed who we spoke to. This is just for informational purposes for
myself as a journalist.

ok....good...any more questions?(anything to keep me from the science work!!)

Well how big of a role do you think the government should play in monitoring
(e.g. clipper chip) the computer users of the US?

not a big role..that would be invasion of privicy

DO you the government should regulate internet?

um........no

Okay, do you feel that it is an invasion of your first amendment rights to be
monitored and regulated by what you can and cannot say in text files or on
any other aspect of computer use?

yes.some people do look ar read adult stuf(not me) if they want to then they
should be able to wthout the goverment monitoring what the read ,typr, or
look at.

Do you think the authors should take responsiblity for what their readers do
with the material they release? Or should it be the reader's responsibility
to "police" themseleves?

well i think they should take responsibilaty if they relese ANARCHY or ELITE
or other illegal things but not every thing else.

Have you read any computerized magazines such as B0W, or Delirium?

no..i read the mercury news but nothing else

Welp just about 2 more questions, do you find that the computer takes away
time from your daily life? For example do you spend more time leeching 0day
warez instead of going outside and playing or wacking off to dirty gifs?

aye ! for one i don't look at dirty text or gif filez! for 2 i have no 0 day
warez and i don't leech from people...i spend just about maybe 3 hours on the
coputer and if longer its because i'm talking to out of city or out of state
friends and i don't play..i hang out with friends and maybe go up town.

Well that's very nice, but would you then admit that your warez are old? 
Beause remember old warez are no warez!

i don't have any warez i just started this bbs...and if i get 0day warez its
because i have people upload them and they down load other filez

Can I get into your phat warez den?

what den?

The 0day palace that lurks on your hard drive?

um...i don't have on...

Do you feel that child pornography is prevalent on the Internet?

i don't think it should be on the net if it is. i'm not very popular...
so i don't hear about evey thing...what is 1 and 0day warez any way?

What are you not popular, you could be, just get the 0 day and you will have
friends showing up at your house every day to see the new win 95 beta, you
will be loved and respected... and after i give this number to the SPA you'll
be loved by a large black man in jail, what is your reaction to that??

for one i would like to have more friends because what i am..not because i
have the win 95 beta version...besides i could get the real version that they
are going to put in stores BEFORE the stores get them and if i wanted to i
could probly get the pentium 150mhz before they put it on the shelf.

Welp how are you gonna do that? You're gonna be sucking dick till the end of
next month if you want that stuff... so will you trade me k0dez so I can call
euro on your phone bill?

actully i wouldn't have to suck any thing....you forgot...my dad works at
INTEL they make them.

Does he have any man-boy bondage pictures?

no...he doesn't...what with you? you always taking about pornography...

Would you like some? I find that older men know how to please younger boys
better...

sorry..i'm not homosexual..i rather do that with my girlfriend.

Does she have any bondage pictures?

gee
z...whats up with you and this bondage shi
t!

Well i figure that you just wouldn't understand.

trie me.

well after the operation i've not been dating alot.. hey do you like pizza?

d00d shut up! god damn...you no i have *69 and i could have the police on
your ass in 30 min?

well you don't realize i have *67 which bolcks that retardo... hey can i just
forget about that last bit... all i want is some warez... i'm really 13 and
just want some games...

thats not what you date of birth says it says your 24

well i lied ... do you like games or utils?

of course i do.....and i have lots...unfortunetly for you you can't d/l them

N)())N000000n000000
pleashe ehieh
please i'll do anythjing.... have you ever heard of the group SCuM?

anything that may in some way harras me about anything..includding bugging

[PauSE]

so is my bbs going to be in a magazine that alot of people read.. the number
and everything huh huh huh?

Hi there! My name's Mike Serengeti, I'm writing an article for Diablo
Magazine. Can I interview you as an east bay sysop?

sure..

WHo am I speaking to?

Hogie SysOp or Eric Wheeler

What school do you go to?

Summit High School

What do you think of hackers?

They should all die a miserable death.

What is your estimate on the number of hackers or hacker boards in the east
bay?

probably about 20-25-30

They're a small group?

Yeah.

What do you think we can do to eliminate them?

Call the feds and destroy them.

From what I understand there's a whole hacker subculture, including fashion
and slang. How would a hacker dress or talk?

they all look diferently and there slang is d00d k00l st00pid alot of 0s.. or
Lamer.

"lamer"?

Yeah that means someone who isn't quite as cool as them i guess i still do
not understand it.

How do you feel about malicious hacking, like the Monte Vista high school
incident?

I totally hate any kind of hacking even if it was for a good cause because i
feel it is an invasion of privacy on any sercumstance.

So hackers have a cause?

Some of them.. for instance if there was someone going around robbing banks
with the computer then they could bring in a better hacker to stop that
hacker but it still is wrong.

So hackers are in it for money?

some of them.  Most of them are just in it to ruin something.  My friend's
board got hacked a while back and they formatted and erased and messed up
everything they could just because we were not "ELiTE"

What was the name of the board?

Underground Asylum

What would you say a hacker's motives are?

Just to make people miserable.  I haven't found out why the higher power
whatever it is created these people.

What do you think of "hacker music" such as Front 242 and KMFDM?

Never heard any of it.

Changing topics, would you say there's a lot of pornography on the internet?

Whenever i call there is alot on it.  But i don't call that often only when i
am at Stanford with my Father.

Are there a lot of boards in the east bay carrying pornography?

Yes.  But only to those of age.  Of course alot of people lie about their
age.  Underground Asylum, emailed everyone and said if you don't tell me your
real age i will delete you.. And just about every male user emailed and said
that they were only about 12-14.

Wow. So you have access to this pornography?

Yes i do.  But i never download any of it, because i just don't care about a
bunch of nude women on a computer.

What would these pictures show? Sexual intercourse, bondage, etc?

You name it they have a picture of it, if you ever find pictures named stuff
like HORSE.GIF or BIGFIST.GIF or something DO NOT LOOK AT IT.. there is some
pretty disgusting Porno stuff out there.

Do you have any of these bondage pictures online?

I only have about 20 files and nothing that is "ADULT" related.

Do you know how I could get membership to the Leather Rose BBS?

I have never heard of it.  But probably just send like 10 bucks to their
address or they might have an Online Thing to subscribe.

So Underground Asylum has bondage pictures?

No, used to before the hacker came.

So the hacker wanted bondage pictures?

No he just deleted everything.

Did they ever catch him?

Nope.  It was locked up when LOoNEY (The SysOp) came home from work.  and he
had no idea who it was.

Changing topics again, would you say there's quite a bit of software piracy
going on?

Not really.  Not around here at least.  Most of the Piracy stuff is going on
down in places around New York real far away .

So there's pirate bbs's that cater to this stuff?

There are quite a bit of them.  There used to be one in Pittsburg but they
shut down.  Just got bored of running a BBS or maybe they got caught.  It was
called The Pittsburg Pirates BBS.

What happens when one of these boards get caught?

They probably get sued i suppose.  I have never been around when they get
caught.  And most of them don't get caught.  Usually these boards just have
sources to games and BBS programs and other stuff they usually don't have
stuff like MicroSoft stuff that they are giving to someone.

Like source code?

Yerp

On the topic of the Oklahoma federal building, do you see a lot of bomb
instructions being passed around?

No i don't.  Are you almost done i have to go somewhere actually over to the
Underground Asylum.

On that note, would you say a lot of sysops have an active social life? The
last person I interviewed hadn't left his house in 2 months.

It depends when you are just starting to set up the board you don't leave for
a while because you wanna get it up and running.  But i think most sysops are
gone doing stuff.

What do you mean?

When they first start a BBS they are home fixing it just the way they want
it.  So it runs exactly the way they want it but most sysops are never home
like me i am usually out from 4:00 until whenever.. like real late.

Are there a lot of women on the computer?

Yes.  There are.  Not as many as Men but alot of Women are.  I really need to
leave if you wanna call Underground Asylum 689-1530 i will continue this in
like 10 minutes.

Alright, I'll call there, thanks.

no problem.  Bye!

NO CARRIER

+-+-+ Part 3: The Underground Asylum (510)689-1350 +-+-+

The SysOp has broken in to chat with you!

Hello!

Hi there. I see Hogie reffered you.

Is Hogie there now?

Yep. I was just talkin to him about you.

Ah okay, would you like me to wait?

No we were just finshed. I was waiting for a user to log on so I could Talk
and right then You popped in. Good Timing

So your board was hacked into?

Yep, Over 1 Gig Of files was destroyed.

Any bondage files?

We had about 100 Meg of Adult files

Yes, I understand pornography is very prominent on the info superhighway.

Yes, But we are very strict about our access to it we use two ways of
validation for adult files

How did you go about validation?

We have a Voice validation where I call the user then they must fill out and
send in an application along with a Photo-copy of a Photo I.D.

How old do you think the hacker was?

I was say probably in the age area of 13-16 Hackers are usually young . Older
hackers usually don't have time or want to spend the time hacking a Local
board.

What would an older hacker do?

Older more experienced hackers usually find Pleasure Hackin into computers
where there is going to be some sort of benefit to them. Like Money, Games,
Information. anything they can benefit from.

What do younger hackers do?

They usually hack for the hell of it. They like the rush of just being where
they shouldn't be. They don't want to deal with the serious consequences so
they stick to small BBSs

Changing topics, would you say there's a lot of bomb information over the
computer? (Relating to the federal building explosion).

Yes, but most of the Information on bomb techniques is just basic. There are
some Hard Core Users out there that search the Internet and other Systems to
find information but most of the stuff you find is the same file rewritten.

Do you have access to these bomb plans personally?

I had some files available but I took them off about two months ago, I will
find it for one of my users if they request it but Most of the people I know
aren't interested in that. I find Files for my users on request because of my
access on other boards.

What do most of the people you know do over the computer?

The average users use the BBSs to communicate with other users. It is a good
way to get to know someone wihout having to go anywhere. You can talk to
people who you usually wouldn't get achance to, cause of whetre you hang out
or other things..

Are there a lot of women on the computer?

It depends on where you are calling. I would say that average is about 25-30%
women.

Have you met any of them personally? I hear modem women are really beastly
looking.

No that is not true at all. I have met plenty of women through the computer
and most of them have been above average to just beautiful. Almost all BBSs
have Get togethers "Socials" some boards have more of course and that way you
get to put a face to the Moniter

Really? I attended a user meet a few weeks ago and there was only one girl
there and she was about 11.

Yeah it is true that most female users are in the 12-17 age range but there
are quite a few in the 18+ area also. It helps to go to a Social put together
by a large Board Like the lounge where 50+ People go to. That way you get a
good range of users.

Do some of these meetings turn into relationships?

Not for me personally, except friendships. But I know a few people who have
turn these meetings into relationships.

That's good. 11 year olds put up quite a fight.

I wouldn't know. But You just gotta make sure there are two Computers around
when you got BBSers together. These people get pretty out of hand if they
have to share. It becomes like a second life for people/

Yeah, she showed me the floor from all kinds of angles. So do you attend a
lot of these meetings?

I try to attend some of the larger ones. I am not as active in other
functions now that I am a SysOp. I have to do too many things on here.

Would you say you have an active social life?

I have a semi active social life

How so?

I like to stay home a lot but I always find time too hang out with friends. I
work a lot and am tired after work, so I geuss I am a little picky when it
comes to what I spend my time on

Okay. So would you say there's a whole hacker culture? What kind of music
would a hacker listen to?

There is no set of people who hack. it could be the little kid next door, the
guy you work with. Hacking is kinda an underground thing. Hackers don't meet
with each other, it isn't like that they just hack.

So hackers are everywhere?

Yeah wherever there is a computer there could be a hacker. Everone who can
move amouse or find there way through DOS has the ability to hack. It is just
a matter                                    formation
Information

You sound really paranoid.

Well I wouldn't say paranoid, but I have only been on a computer for like 2
years and I could probably break into a lot of things, just from playing with
systems and my knowledge of computers. an dif I can do I feel anyone has the
ability, they just don't expand on that knowledge

So are you a cyberpunk?

No, I am just a guy who loves to program and be on the computer.

What else do you know about hackers?

I know I don't like them. I actually hate what they do. I can't see the fun
in destroying important information for the hell of it.

So that's what hackers do?

Some. Like I said they all have different reasons some want something some
want to test viruses, some just want to see if they can get in.

How do you think we could eliminate them?

well I would think that is impossible. Everything has a back door, there is
nothing that is solid. I mean we have people breaking into our military
computers. So how are we going to stop these people if we can't keep them out
of some of the most important computers in the world?

You're sounding paranoid again.

I geuss so. But if paranoid is truth as far as we know it now, then I am
paranoid

How do you feel about child pornography?

I think it is disgusting. I would never put something like that up on my
board. That is why I try to personally Look through all adult files and make
sure none of that garbage is in ther. I can't look at every file so I spend a
lot of time doing that

So you don't have any?

No, as far as I know. I haven't set up any adult files since the board has
been hacked so I know that the ones I have backed up are not child
pornography.

Would you like some? I've still got that 11 year old in my trunk doped up on
codeine.

No thanks. I don't think so.
Well Mike I am going to let you go now. I am going out.

I will crush your balls with my fingers. Bye now.

NO CARRIER

+-+-+ Part 4: Virtual Images (510)328-0722 +-+-+

The SysOp is here, Mike Serengeti!

hello.. how are ya..

Hi there! Did you see my letter?

I was just reading it...

Are you interested in an interview?

Hmm well no prob here.. I was just roaming around the house nothing to do..

Alright.. who am I speaking to?

The real name?

If you'd like to submit that information. We can make this totally anonymous
if you wish.

Ok well My handle is know as Black Cyclopes..

What school do you attend?

CAlifornia High..

What do you think of hackers?

Well hackers.. I don't realy care for them.. I mean. they should think of
some other hobbes to do than mess up important informations on other
computers..

What is your estimate on the number of hackers or hacker boards in the east
bay?

hmm I would say 35% maybe..

What do you think we can do to eliminate them?

Well we can create individual System um Passwords.. As in that everyperson
has to know a certain password not including their own.. and so on..

How would this stop hackers?

Well hackers get into the computers by craking the system passowrds, when
they are in, but if they don't know the certain person's password they can't
go into the Restricted areas to only those that have gigh access..

From what I understand there's a whole hacker subculture, including fashion,
music and slang. How would a hacker dress or talk?

I have no Idea sorry...

Alright, changing subjects... would you say there's a lot of pornography on
the information superhighway?

Well I have heard of it.. but so far I think it's still growing..

You have access to these pictures, personally?

I can if I wanted to.. but being underaged I have to get permission from my
parents.. the computer is not mine..

the data that is put onto the computer has to be permitable by my parents or
I can't have it at all..

Where would these pictures be made available?

Hmm.. there are some BBes that have BBS list, but ther is alot in San
Francisco..

What would these pictures contain? Sexual intercourse, bondage, etc?

Well they would include poster kinds.. such as solos, intercourse, and name
it they have it..

Would you have any of these bondage pictures online?

right now no sorry..

A boy named Jim Scott told me this board has a very large pornography section
and was previously named the "Leather Rose" BBS.

This bbs?

Yes.

My BBs has never changed it is Virtual Images.. none have I ever heard of
Leather Rose...

So you've never spoken to Jim Scott?

I have.. he used to Co-sysop for my BBs and my Brothers.. this is also my
brothers.. I do not know what he has sometimes.. I will have to talk to him
about it..

So you don't feel the name "Virtual Images" implies anything?

Not to Pronos... I thought of it mostly to have a good data full of good
games with good graphics.. Plus I am working on a VGA BBs that supports 256
colors online right now..

I think the word "images" is the clincher.

oh well Images.. Can mean alot to people.. some say to me is it, that you
have alot of Gif's JPG
nad so on.. no.. I have Gifs of CArs, Houses, fowers.. all came from a Store
in Fremont called Fryz.. it's a Gif CD full of just regular things.. there
are swimsuits, and men pics in Shorts and Swim suits..

May I see them? I'm looking for a picture of that Ford Taurus SHO engine.

hold on let me put the CD in...

Alright, no problem.

hold on.. I can't find the Cd.. it was some where in my backback...

Alright, Changing topics to the recent Federal Building explosion, could you,
personally, obtain bomb instructions off the computer?

there was someone who did upload a file that contains info.. but I have
deleted all the files that he has uploaded.. they where all Anarchy files.. I
did not care for them for because they took up alot of space on the HD..

What did these files contain?

I wish I had read them.. I did not get a chance to see them.. ihad them on
the BBS for about  4 days.. or so.. then I deleted them.. when I had more
Renegade utils comming in from Concord..

What's in Concord?

There is a BBs that supports Renegade Utils.. which is for this Program I am
using right now. Those utils will make the BBS look better, add new commads
and so forth...

They don't have any bondage gifs?

I havent looked.. I only have been to make that 2 of their File areas.. and
that is RENEGADE UTLS A-N  RENEGADE UTILS M-Z.. thats about it..

Do you see a lot of pornography and bomb information being traded?

No not realy.. I see people buying them for them selves. and what supprised
me was that their parents are with them..

"Buying"?

Yes.. I was with a friend.. he collects PLayboy for the Car Pics they have
and the girls also.. but his mom feels as thog as if it's right.. she says
there is nothing wrong with Pornos.. She says that Pornos expreses feelings,
and a nature of art, and she says that you should not be ashamed of such
thing.

Well, I was speaking of electronic pornography. Is his mother a hippie?

No his mother I don't think a hippie in any ways.. She has graduated from
Collage with a PHD in Phycology or somehting like that..
she also says that Since this is a free country there should be no such thing
as rules.. on how and what people see, People will perform as on free
speach.. and does not couse any Violence.. that was stated in the
Constitution #1.. and if you don't want your kids having them, you have to
take care of it, it's not the goverments business to take care of what your
family sees or not see, or do or get...


I guess the family that comes together stays together right?

I guesse so. I do hafly agree with her. Because of this thing it is getting
alot of parents mad when they see all these rules and so on.. that should be
up to the parents to do.

Yes, we must fight the good fight.

I agree that also that porno in electronic is in a way bad.. you should get
t for your self if you want it, but it's also a free state..

From what I understand Jim Scott's parents beg to differ.

Well there are alot of them also different in sight.. some say its
digusting.. but you know what.. thats why we have so many Pregnansies..
parents are affraid to show their kids what the real world is.. then when the
kid wants to find out to quickly its all their fault.. ever hear the saying
it's that teenage mind that made him/her do it.. well it aint all the way.
they got it from their parents.. their parents are so shy to talk about sex,
body part, languages, private conv.. and so on.. that the kids just explore
for them selfs and get into trouble..

What?

Hu>?

So you're saying pregnancies are directly related to pornography on the
internet?

No only on the internet.. Porno should be just like Magazines.. as
Educational tool to people.. people over the years have made porn a Evil
thing, theres nothing bad in it. If you  can up with one good reason.. and
the other not having a good answer.. then your right..

So you feel that interracial cumshot pictures are educational?

in which way do you want to teach your children.. some fathers would.. not
trying to be a smartaleck. but I have heard of fathers.. few parents who show
these things when they have their child grow up.. they want them to grow up
to have a sexual life.. thats all part of the Parents to Children policy..

I like to show children things too. Hey, do you like pizza?

Of course..

Would you like to continue the interview in person?

I do not know.. I will have to ask permision if posible.. they have a thing
ahout me meeting with people over the Modem..

Speaking of which, how do you feel about the Leighton Hinkley tragedy?

WOw.. how things get by me.. fill me in..

A 13 year old walnut creek boy met a man named Leighton Hinkley over the
computer. After they met in person the boy was raped and found in a ditch,
bound and gagged with a 3 gigabyte harddisk in his rectum. Do these sort of
incidents occur often in the computer community?

I did not know that.. wow. poor kid.. well I have a friend who is going out
with this guy who she met through the Modem.. she likes him.. fine.. it's a
matter of judgement.. from you.. I don't know.. how you will be able to tell
from over the screen.. but.. ohh well..

Does she have any bondage pictures?

I don't think so.. I don't hear of her talking about such things.. and I
would not care to know.. she's a friend.. it's her business to keep it to her
slef if she likes.. then I have friends who tell me almost everything...

From what I understand there's women on the info superhighway trading
pornography too. On this note, would you say the modem is a social or
antisocial thing?

Well for the frist question..
Theres alot.. to belive it or not.. there is an equal amount of Female and
Male Sysops holding PICs of such sort.. and Gays..and Bi=Lesbians.. ..

They are enemies of God and must be destroyed. So you feel the modem is
a very social thing, correct?

Correct.. many people uses the modem to get rid of stress.. believe me.. I
have saved a life over the modem twice.. and its fun to chat with other
people from around the world..

Please elaborate.. you saved 2 lives?

Well there was a guy.. he was havbing probs with home.. and had nothing else
to do but call bbses.. so he was calling and telling people about his probs..
and so on.. so I was one of them.. he told me that his time is short.. and he
feel thats he has nothing left to do.  I have just let him think the way he
wants to think.. with that i also included a few things for him to remeber in
the time to come.. well he stoped complaining.. and said that he was happier
and happier everytimes he goes on the BBs and chats with someone with an open
mind...

Did he have any bondage pictures?

I don't know.. if you have already inteviewed umm Nexus Point.. which he said
someone did.. well that is him..

Oh! Yes, I spoke to him earlier. He hung up.

Ahh.. I see. well he is kinda shy in way.. maybe was scared..

Well, I hope he's feeling better.

Well he's doing fine now.. we of the BBesers.. support each other in many
ways.. if one doesent sound like the person before.. we all know it.. we all
call that person and find out.. and help each other..

Tell me more about this underground network.

Underground Network of What?

You said you trade information on other people? You have special
communication lines of some sort?

No we use the lines you would call for regular.. sometimes tru partyline on
Voice... or there are some boards that are made of only chat lines.. such as
in 4 lines or more in the BBes.. it make people call... and have alot of
chatters.. thats how most people meet.. each other.. as for the sysop... we
sysops hold almost a monthly meet.. to meet all our users..

What goes on at these meetings?

We have fun.. go to places like Q-zar, Virtual World.. umm Hologram world,,
eat pizzas.. and talk... have sysop meets.. we talk about programs.. such as
who is making a program.. who is helping.. who has what.. and who is new...

Are there a lot of vampires on the info highway?

not realt..
They all seem to be nice people.. they respect one onothers feelings and
race.. and sex..

No, I was speaking literaly. I'll bring my friend Enkil when we have pizza.
So you have a lot of fun at these user meets?

It sounds like it's an restrospectivly antisocial community.

Hmm I don;t know how I will answer that.....

They sound cliquish.

Cliquish?

Yes, they form a group and don't let anyone in. Well not me anyways.

Ahh..You are talking about like boards that require a New User Password..
that you have to know someone in there before you get into it..

Yes, I understand New User Passwords are synonymous with hacker/pirate
boards.

It may.. or some may jsut want friends and can only have the board up in some
certain time.. and does not want many users...

Is that how Fokkar's board is?

No.. his is a free just like mine.. we run almost the same thing.. we share
shareware infos.. and play games over the modem from time to time..

THeN WhY DoeS He TYPe LiKe ThIs

don't know at all.. That is to make messages look good in writing to people..
and so on.. make the user not get board of the same sizes of the same sort..

So it isn't a hacker "sign"?

no not at all.. I use it on my AnsI or AnSi to make it look alittle bit more
intersting.. .

So it's a psuedo-hacker board/
?

Maybe..

Can I have access to your kode abode?

abode?

Yes, the 0-day palace on your b-board.

0-day.. umm what??

I hwaes hoping you would know. I see this slang being used but nobody will
tell me what it means.

Ahh.. well sory no I don't know.. it's some thing I think to do with the
Pirate boards..

Where would someone find pirated filezzzz?

hmm If you have connections wiht some sorta friend..

Do you have these connections?

I did.. not anymore.. I used to live in Union City i did.. they died down.. I
moved..

What kind of slang did they use?

They just used what you could say Games, Utils, and so on.. they had of
course theyre own Productions,, So they would have lets say it was my board..
it would be..
Virtaul Images Productions Games... so on..

ewe have no filezzzzz for me?

I found your cd hold on.. let me find you your taurus..

Thanks, I really appreciate it.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

i jerked myself today
to see how it would feel
i focus on my palm
the only thing that's real
my fingers form a hole
the old familiar fling
try to rub it all away
till i feel the zing

what have i become?
my sweetest friend :D
everyone i know
does it in the end

you could have it all
it's not gonna hurt
just pull your pants down
and proceed to jerk

right now i sit
in this leather chair
full of dirty thoughts
which i wish i could share
beneath the sheets of mine
my actions disappear
when you are somewhere else
i do this right here

what have i become?
my sweetest friend
everyone i know
does it in the end

you could have it all
its not gonna hurt
just pull your pants down
and proceed to jerk

if i could do it again and again
twenty times a day
i would jerk myself
i would find a way
