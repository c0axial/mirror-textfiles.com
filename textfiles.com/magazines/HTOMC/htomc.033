Excerpted from:  Get Government off Our Back

Regulation: What's it to ya?

In 1993, the nation's regulatory system cost Americans $581 billion --
about $5,900 per household per year. Other fun facts:

The annual cost of federal regulation is projected to rise to $662
billion by the year 2000. ("CEOs Call for Sweeping Reform of U.S.
Government Regulation," PR Newswire, June 21, 1994, citing Thomas D.
Hopkins, "Costs of Regulations: Filling the Gaps," Reg. Info. Service
Center, Aug. 1992)

If the hours spent complying with the tax code were put to productive
work, they'd represent the entire annual outputs of the U.S. auto,
truck and aircraft industries. (The Dallas Morning News, June 30, 1994)

"The Lord's Prayer is 66 words, the Gettysburg Address is 286 words,
and there are 1,322 words in the Declaration of Independence. Yet,
government regulations on the sale of cabbage total 26,911 words."
(Letter from David McIntosh [former member of V.P. Quayle's Council on
Competitiveness] to Grover C. Norquist, Oct. 13, 1992)

Between 1987 and 1992, the federal paperwork burden increased 261% to
nearly seven billion hours, according to the GAO, with tax
requirements comprising most of that burden. And regulatory costs tend
to hit small business harder than larger companies which "often
welcome new regulations because they know the regulations will help
consolidate their market share and wipe out small business
competitors." (Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business
Survival Committee, Investor's Business Daily, Sept. 8, 1994)

                     Classical Literature


***  A-Bomb #11 - Interesting robo-sex story; a guy falls in love with a
bordello robot and "liberates" her, yet the robot only wants to go back to
her owners.  Neat story- reminiscent of Ranxerox-in-reverse. Plus, some other,
less explicit and much less sophisticated strips.  Venus Comics.

** A-Bomb #12 - This issue focuses on a couple of longer stories; one, in which
two expert martial-arts vixens fight, then get close, and a young Japanese
soldier fondles a captured woman prisoner.  This issue just isn't up to the
usual quality or uniqueness of most in this series.  Venus Comics.

**** A-Bomb #13 - Part 2 and 3 of "Sindyr and Company" - great story, with an
actual plot.  Sindyr and Bronx must rescue Gramps from the evil sorceress who
is draining him of his magic by screwing him to death.  Lots of action in
this one.  Plus, vintage b&d pictures from yesteryear.  Venus Comics.

***** Cherry #19 - Everyone's favorite party girl/slut takes on two
stereotypes in this issue.  First, she's upstaged by the ultra-siliconed
blonde bimbo twins who will do anything, then she finds out that the big
"super-jocks" aren't necessarily proportionally gifted.  Plus, more pics
of Cherry's Mom, and fan letters.  Due to censorship, this is getting
harder and harder to get in some places.  Cherry Comics.

***** Dawn #4 - Lucifer's Halo part 4: The Gauntlet - Darrien must fight
demons, angels, and men, as he reluctantly holds onto Lucifer's halo,
and deals with the strange power it has over others.  As usualy, the
great artwork and heavy metaphysical story from Linsner.  Sirius comics.

**** Eightball #17 - More strange, disturbing tales include a weird triangle
between a gynecologist's estranged wife, one of the doctor's psychotic
patients, and an artist who is the wife's lover.  Plus, another episode of
"Ghost World", both stories exploring the theme "they psychopathology of
nostalgia".  Really intense emotional issue.  Fantagraphics.

*** Empty Love Stories #2 - More tales of strange love gone wrong.  In
"The Quiet Type", a young man falls in love with beautiful coma patients
in the hospital.  "Another World" is about a UFO conspiracy nut who falls
in love with an alien, who postpones the planned global conquest in order
to abduct her.  In "Mind Game", a girl meets and falls in love with the
typical slick bastard who manipulates and takes her for granted- but can
*always* get back with her.  Slave Labor Graphics

***** Frank #1 - Sept. 1996 - Adventures of the chipmunk-like creature Frank
and his strange and sometimes disgusting acquaintances in a surreal land.
Possibly the wildest mindfuck available without actually being under the
influence of drugs.  This one includes two stories: "Hi-Rise Hopper", where
Frank takes his "dog" Pupshaw for a walk, and is mutated by a strange little
creatures.  In "Gentlemanhog", Frank and Jerry the Chicken find some fireworks
which they use to play a joke on the disgusting Manhog.  He runs far away, and
ends up at a man's compound, who takes him in, and educates him; but Frank is
in for a shocking surprise when he visits.  Fantagraphics Books

*** Hate #21 - Lisa finally goes off the deep end with her emotional
outbursts, Buddy makes her go to a psychiatrist.  She soon quits for another
therapist who puts her on Prozac and excuses her behavior.  All this comes
out during a "joint session" where Buddy call bullshit on the whole deal.
In the end, nothing really changes. Also, another "Doofus" strip. Fantagraphics

*** Hate #22 - As Buddy's dad seems more and more helpless, Lisa become more
and more obsessed at playing "nurse" for him, which leads to tension and a
major confrontation between Buddy and Lisa.  Things work out though, and
Lisa get her act together..when "Dad" gets a burst of energy and goes out for
a walk, and gets hit and killed.  Its sounding a lot like a soap opera, but
just enough real-world angst to make it believable.  Plus, Stinky returns in
a short where Valerie takes over his lame rock show, turns into a pure bitch,
and Stinky get back the show -and revenge.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Joe Matt's Peepshow #9 - Totally creepy story of a kid with big problems;
if its even halfway autobiographical, it makes you feel sorry for Matt.  He
just doesn't know how to deal with other people, and comes across as a selfish
nerd, which only makes trouble for him- and he ends up getting what he's
asking for.  Fantagraphics Books.

**** Johnny the Homocidal Maniac #5 - A couple try to escape from the
depths beneath Johnny's house, while being chased by a horrible creature
reminiscent of Friday the 13th.  Also, side-stories of angst, murder, and
a great dig at the vampire-wannabe crowd.  As the pair reach the end, they
find that Johnny has been attacked and is dying, but that doesn't stop the
monster from getting them.  Gruesome, but fun.  Slave Labor Graphics.

**** Meatcake #6 - More adventures of the strange cast of characters by
Dame Darcy, done in her weird, intricate, victorian style.  Richard Dirt
meets her exact double/doppleganger, and together they play a trick on
the Wax Wolf at the boardwalk; Strega Pez plays a trick on Effluvia the
mermaid in revenge for her cruelty; and more quirky tales.  Lots of fun.
Plus, she has her own show on cable access in Manhattan.  Fantagraphics Books

**** Murder Can Be Fun #2 - Johnny Marr's anthology of death, with individual
stories drawn by different artists, as part of an anthology.  This one
focuses on celebrity deaths, including Brandon Lee, "Alfalfa", Bob Crane,
Jayne Mansfield, John Holmes, the nonfatal shooting of Andy Warhol, and the
fall of "Fatty" Arbuckle.  Sets the stories straight, and debunks some
myths too.  Slave Labor Graphics.

**** Mystery Men Stories #1 - Based on the Mystery Men heroes from Flaming
Carrot comics, Bob Burden prsents a limited, text version of a future comic
book, although it does have numerous pictures and illustrations.  The story
follows the adventures of The Strangler, who finishes off the bad guys.
And, like the Flaming Carrot, he has plenty of personal quirks of his own.
Lots of hardboiled action.  Bob Burden Productions.

**** Naughty Bits #19 - The war between the sexes heats up, with Kenny
arguing that women are too often cold manipulative bitches who play the
"victim" guilt trip, and Bitchy returning the charges that men are often
concerned only with shallow supermodel-types, and only want to get in
women's pants.  Things heat up so much that Roberta Gregory even has to
take a couple of pages to put things into perspective.  Fantagraphics.

** Simpson's Comics #19 - Forced to write a school paper on the town's
founder, Bart decides to rig up the founder's statue so that it looks like
its crying, a "miracle" like so many others.  Immediately, the whole town
goes nuts over it, with an entire huckster carnival trying to cash in on the
phenomenon.  Lisa figures it out, though, and exposes the trick, using Homer's
beer instead of the fake tears.  Bongo Comics.

**** Sunglasses After Dark #3 - Original vampire novel/comic by Nancy
Collins.  Sonja recalls memories from her earlier human life, and how she
was brutally raped and changed.  Then, as a new creature, her experiences
at various brothels, and how she met the man who proposed to make her into
a vampire hunter.  Lots of graphic gore.  Verotik.

*** The System #2 of 3 - The continuing wordless adventure in the corrupt city
segues between a racial murder, terrorists assembling an atomic bomb, corrupt
police, corrupt insider trading, political scandal, drug turf wars, hackers,
strippers, alley killers, and on.  All the while, all these little isolated-
but related- plots, move along, getting closer and closer to the boiling
point.  There's so much story in the pictures, words aren't needed.
[by Peter Kruper]  DC/Vertigo

*** Too Much Coffee Man #1 - color special - The superhero whose secret
power is that he drinks way too much coffee, in order to stave off angst
and depression.  With his similarly obsessive/depressed friends, they
explore the meaningless of depressed boredom.  All drawn by Shannon
Wheeler.  Adhesive Comics.

**** Trailer Trash #7 - The misadventure of total sleazeballs in the
wrong side of town.  When little Billy swipes a videotape hidden in a pipe,
the producers come back looking for it- and him.  Billy runs away to avoid
them, and joins up with a miserable pair of hoodlums, in order to get a gun
to protect himself.  Everything screws up; he gets caught and locked in a
masoleum.  Also features Harvey the pathetic hillbilly.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Vamperotica #17 - This series hasn't had a bad story yet- all very
original vampire-theme stories, each issue with a story as part of a much
larger vampire mythos.  This one starts off with the parable "Three Wishes",
followed by "Heart and Soul", where the vampire killer Hunter, himself a
vampire, becomes involved with streetwalkers and their evil pimps.  Also,
he is shown to be the vampire queen Luxura's pawn in "Hunter's Blood".
Brainstorm Comics

*** The Young Witches - Book Two: "London Babylon", issue 6/6 - Sherlock
Holmes employs Freud to investigate the strange and perverted "club", and
arrive in time to witness the orgy of Walpurgis, where the two virgin witches
will be sacrificed to Astarte.  Due to Holmes' help, the girls are able to
use their powers to break free and avenge their captivity, ending this chapter
of the story.  Overall, the story condemns the excess and hypocrisy of the
Victorian era, and the comic itself is very explicit.  Eros Comics.

*** Yuppies, Rednecks, and Lesbian Bitches from Mars - In an apocalyptic
future, lesbians have taken over the planet Mars and outlawed straight sex-
while on Earth, a degenerate-slob leader of the rednecks has declared genocide
on all yuppies, who are trying to escape to Mars.  A large group of yuppies
which has been hiding out in a bomb shelter for several years, and get tangled
up in a survivalist's plan to escape.  And, of course, lots of raw and very
graphic sex- with plenty in the Mars scenes.  Good story, too. Eros Comics.

cocktail party, by Skip Williamson, plus more serials such as "The Chuckling
Whatsit" by Richard Sala, "Fuzz & Pluck" escape their captors by Ted Stearn,
and a *great* story from Stephane Blanquet, "The Thing They Call Death".

entire book.  Also check out "The Serbian Dreamer" by Aleksandar Zograf.

Hiding Out On Halloween: Videos to Ease the Guilt
By Drew Feinberg

Halloween is almost upon us, coming quicker than Hugh Grant in a BMW. As
Meg Tilly so brilliantly asked in the cinematic disaster known as Body
Snatchers, "Where ya gonna go?  Where ya gonna run?  Where ya gonna hide?"
Eloquently, she voices the dilemma of millions of Americans every
October 31.  I've done them all, with less than optimum results.  Let's
run through the options, shall we?

Okay, first there's trick or treating.  Being a greedy bastard and
visiting every house within a 20 mile radius, hitting them up for the
goods, is socially acceptable as child, but, three years ago, when I was
dressed as Zsa Zsa Gabor and asked all of my neighbors to "Give me some
candy, DAHLING, or I'll give you a slap," the results were less than
desirable.  From what I can remember I got assorted candy bars, candy
corns, rocks, kitchenware, lollipops, and a jack o'lantern, still lit--
THROWN at me, with great velocity.  I can't even spell the names people
called me, and I was told to do things to myself that aren't even
physically possible, lord knows I've tried.  One grandmotherly looking
woman was actually kind to me, and gave me some popcorn.  My faith in
mankind had been restored, that is, until I heard the muffled call to her
husband "Come see this poor slow boy.  It's lovely to see the mentally
challenged out and about."  At the tender age of 23, I retired from trick
or treating forever.

The next year I opted to stay home, watch some scary movies, and give
wondrous candy to the the legit trick or treaters.  The candy aisle at the
supermarket was pure pandemonium.  I might as well have been looking for
the last green Power Ranger on Christmas Eve.  I didn't want to be one of
those houses that gave out nickels, fruit, hard bubble gum, cream soda
Dum-Dumms that stuck to the paper, black licorice, those awful dark
chocolate Hershey's Miniatures, or Smarties. Honestly, do people ever BUY
Smarties for themselves?  I made a quick scan of what was available, and
I saw some variety packs of assorted good chocolate stuff that the
others had apparently not seen.  I made a mad dash to get two packs.  I
popped 'em in my cart and very confidently strolled to the checkout
counter. The line was huge, and I noticed the elderly woman behind me had
nothing in her cart but a box of Metamucil, so I let her go in front of
me.  I started to sing along with the muzak..."Precious and few are the
moment we two can shaaaaaaare..."  CRASH!  I looked to my side and saw
this huge pyramid of canned beets topple over.  "Hope that wasn't my
singing," I thought to myself, then turned back. Quicker than I could say
"The cast of Wings should be sterilized," my treasures were GONE!  I was
completely bewildered.  I was shocked when I looked in the cart ahead of
me. The woman I had sacrificed selflessly for, had two bags of assorted
chocolates along with her Metamucil.  I tried to conceal my anger and
kindly said to the woman "Excuse me, I think those are my Halloween
candies there."  I believe she mouthed the words "Bite me."  I walked
right up to her cart and reached in and picked up what was rightfully
mine.  That's when she started bawling hysterically, which caused the
entire supermarket to glare in my direction.  I was frozen like Jennifer
Tilly would be if you aimed a flashlight at her eyes. I was never so
furious AND so humiliated; I just stood there with my hand in the
metaphorical cookie jar.  I slowly backed out of the store, and still
candyless, I decided to go to a convenience store, where I bought 50
Chunky bars.  A mixture of chocolate nuts and raisins makes my stomach
turn, but hey, I didn't have to eat 'em.  I had enough Chunky bars to
feed a small South American country, or Marlon Brando.  I sat down and
started to watch Halloween.  Before the opening credits were
finished, the doorbell rang. "Trick Or Treat," I was greeted by a child
and his mother.  "Here ya go, fella," I smiled as I handed him a Chunky.
The child glowed; the mother frowned.  "Michael is ALLERGIC to nuts.
Don't you have anything else?" she inquired.  "Umm...n-n-no..." I
stammered.  The mother ripped the treat from her son's hand and handed it
back to me, setting Michael into a temper tantrum.  "I'm really sorry," I
managed to say.  "Thank you, thank you VERY much, it was his first
Halloween and you ruined it for him.  Aren't you proud of yourself?" she
sneered as she stormed off.  I sighed, shrugged, and went back to my
movie.  Five minutes later, more doorbell. Two teenage girls dressed
up--looked like the girls from Clueless, gum chewing and all.  "Like,
trick or treat." I handed them two chunky bars, which appalled them.
Clueless #1: "Like HELLO, do you KNOW how many grams of fat are in a
Chunky?  Only like a MILLION!"  and she handed it back to me.  Clueless
#2: "Geez Louise, don't you have any like Snackwells or fat free potato
chips?" and deposited El Chunky back in my hand.  And so it went all
night.  Kids whining about chocolate, kids complaining  about raisins, kids
bitching about options, in 4 hours I got through about 15 minutes of my
movie.  And got stuck with 45 Chunky bars.  Hey, you want a Chunky?

Last year I tried another great Halloween option--the costume party. I
bopped on down to "Costumes R Us," to rent one, which was oh-so-wise to do
on Halloween day.  Sparse selection?  The place was emptier than Jennie
McCarthy's skull.  Let me tell you, all eyes were focused when I stumbled
in the door as a huge orange box of Tide.  I felt about as mobile as
Gilbert Grape's mother.  I scanned the room and saw assorted Beavises,
Ticks, Shannen Doughertys, Newt Gingritches, and one big orange blob.  I
went straight to the punch bowl and then mingled about. Everybody bored
me, and they allseemed to be staring at the monstrosity that was my
costume.  Then I saw her, the woman I would spend forever with, the woman
who wouldn't bitch at me for drinking milk out of the carton. She was a
twin of Mia Wallace (a.k.a. Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction), and she looked
me straight in the eye, walked up to me, and what followed was a few hours
of engaging conversation; this and my never empty punch cup kept me in
seventh heaven.  In the middle of debating which was more torture,
watching the OJ trial or watching a Mickey Rourke movie, she blurted out
"Do you always talk so much before you a kiss a girl?" That was all the
invitation I needed.  I wrapped my arms around her and kissed. It was just
like the movies...the world started to spin in a little circle, like in a
DePalma film, except it made me dizzy, and I suddenly realized it wasn't
the kiss, but the heavy imbibing at the punchbowl.  I lost my balance,
which is not a smooth thing mid-kiss.  The huge Tide box caused me to
stumble and I held my love tight, knowing she would be my rock and prevent
my imminent falling, but my feet became entwined with hers and I fell
forward, taking Mia Wallace with me.  I could see her expresion of horror;
the girl I so wanted to impress was being crushed by Mr. Tide himself.  I
believe the words that she used were "Jesus, I can't feel my legs!  I
struggled and squirmed, as Batman and Thor managed to pull me off of her,
but by then it was too late.  Physically, Mrs. Wallace was fine, but she
was none too pleased with my squashing her, inadvertent as it was.  In
fact, everybody at the party just sort of glared and pointed at me until I
left in utter shame.  No more Halloween parties for ME, thank you very
much.

Don't walk down the same unpaved road as I did.  Learn from my mistakes,
my friend.  This Halloween, hide out with some friends, turn off on the
lights and rent some movies.  Try a couple of these, you'll thank me
later.  Halloween, Nightmare On Elm Street, Frankenhooker, Carrie, The
Shining, Evil Dead 2, Dead Alive, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The
Exorcist, and Re-Animator. When the doorbell rings, don't answer it.
There's no shame.  In fact, I've found that detaching the doorbell all
together makes things much more pleasant.  And if you turn the volume up
really loud, you can't even hear those little fists knocking.

THE WORLD WIDE WEB GUN DEFENSE CLOCK

Remember, a few years back, when some guy (who later went to prison for
fraud, as I recall) put up the Death Clock in New York's Times Square
which clicked off a death from gun violence every two minutes?

Well, now anybody with access to the World Wide Web can access The World
Wide Web Gun Defense Clock.  Starting at 12:00 midnight on January 1st,
it starts counting up a gun defense every 13 seconds_which adds up to
about 2.4 million gun defenses by the time midnight December 31st rolls
around.  That's the number of gun defenses the National Self Defense
Survey from criminologists at Florida State University found each year in
the United States.

    http://www.netstorage.com/pulpless/gunclock.html

Check it out.  The Democratic Party was smart enough to put Jim and Sarah
Brady on during Prime Time, while the Republican Party is running for cover.
We didn't see NRA President Marion Hammer addressing the Republican National
Convention, did we?

If we're going by cojones alone, the Democrats deserve to win.  And they will,
unless someone gets the facts out about how guns save more lives than they
take by around 20 to 1.  The World Wide Web Gun Defense Clock is just one
little way of putting "gun violence" in perspective.

         [Lots more listings real soon, too!  Thanks to the
         people who have flooded me with TONs of great stuff]


ABWoF - Stands for "A Back Water of Fandom", from the ashes of Dan Harper's
RoMSFaFiNA, is still primarily about science fiction literature, but delves
much deeper into the general "fandom" aspect of it,  That, being, those who
aren't members of the "official" clubs, but just enjoy their own little
corner of the it.  This issue, he looks at anti-censorship messages in scifi,
(and how movies can have different, even memorable, departures from the book)
a personal diary and mini-review of Boskone 33, plus other musings on books,
culture, and his favorite authors.  Makes a nice complement to Arthur Hlavaty's
Derogatory Reference zine.  Available for "The Usual" or editorial whim.
Dan Harper, PO Box 194, Concord MA  01742-0194   danlharp@aol.com


Aggressive Christianity Missions Training Corps (ACMTC) - They regularly send
out a big stack of newspaper-magazines, way out on the "christian nation"
fringe.  They also have their own compound somewhere way the hell out in the
middle of nowhere, where they have a pseudo-military organization (with
themselves titles of Major Generals), for the purpose of taking over society
[peacefully, according to the disclaimers].  They are big on end-times rapture
&nd prophecy, but I can't see much anti-NWO influence.  The papers themselves
are great examples of hardcore fundie rants, and well worth it for the *tons*
of great clip-art alone.  They'll probably send it all for the asking:
ACMTC Library, PO Box 90, Berino NM 88024,  prophet@cibola.net
http://www2.cibola.net/~prophet


Archie McPhee - Color catalog - The "outfitters of popular culture", this
is the ultimate source of all kinds of strange, unusual items, toys,
geegaws, rubber animals, and anything else you can imagine.  Whether its
rubber chickens or pink flamingos for the yard, cricket-flavored
lollipops, voodoo dolls, original fallout shelter signs, "Bob" mugs, Elvis
playing cards, and tons more.  You gotta get some of this stuff.  Archie

email: mcphee@mcphee.com  web: http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/


Cato Institute - 1996 catalog - Books, journals, and papers on a wide variety
of public policy issues, from the famous Washington DC think-tank that is
responsible for much of the successful lower-tax/less gov't policies of the
current Republican congress- but its actually undercover Libertarians.
Although they seem "conservative" on most fiscal issues, they're also against
the stupid War on Some Drugs, and advocate individual liberty in a way that
the Repubs can only dream about.  800-767-1241, Cato Institute Books,
938 Howard St., Suite 202, San Francisco, CA  94103

Derogatory Reference #81 - Arthur Hlavaty's thoughts/journal on Sci-Fi
literature, mixed in with whatever else he feels is important or is happening
to him at the time.  Being recognized as an authority and published in
various SF references, I admit that I'm not familiar with many of the authors
he talks about, except for some of the more popular ones like Philip K. Dick,
Heinlein, etc.  Plus, he gives his thoughts on things like political
correctness, health problems, big business, and more.  Print version is $1,
or trade or email.  Arthur D. Hlavaty, 206 Valentine St., Yonkers NY
10704-1814  hlavaty@panix.com


Devil Boy Comics #2 - Godvirus issue - Hardcore, gory, punk sci-fi comics
and stories.  Profusely illustrated, in a style similar to Eric York of
Hungry Maggot.  Plenty of raw violence, but gets quite psychological too.
The title cartoon "Devil Boy" is about a small demon that controls the Devil
Boy, and prepares him for a life of debauchery and carnage.  Look for these
arond various Seattle area bars, as well as the zine "Mansplat", and comic
conventions in Washington state.  Send SASE for catalog and some free
Devil Boy stickers, maybe a little extra for the zine, to: V.Blast
4742 42nd Ave. SW, Suite 354, Seattle WA 98116


The Dial #5 - One-stop shopping for the best subversion in town.  Each
"channel" has a different article, most of which are taken from other
zines and sources, but put together for dramatic effect.  Includes an interviews
with arsonists & smugglers, an article on 100 drunken Santas on a rampage in SF,
basics of lockpicking, sneaking alcohol into sporting events, your rights
regarding police searches, and creating confusion.  Also has zines/music and
a nice section on the SubG/Discordian cults, with instructions on how to perform
the Turkey Curse.  $2, 4/5$: The Dial Pressworks, PO Box 38126-830 Dallas TX
765238   Tons more tips and tricks are on: http://www.math.grin.edu/~gibson
Of course, these are for entertainment purposes only.


Drapetomania! - Premier issue (meaning, the uncontrollable urge to escape
from freedom) [name is also being changed due to conflicts]  The basic
premise, like the name, is about being free enough to live among others, and
having fun in the process; with the zine being a source of knowledge to help
accomplish this goal.  Lots of practical info on recycling, improvising,
paying off bills, using computers, book review (Whole Earth Catalog in this
issue), and a lot more, including the complete "Declaration of Independence
of Cyberspace" by John Perry Barlow.  $3, Charles Alfred "Al" Human,
505 Woodlawn St., Suite #229, Belmont NC 28012   liberty@clt.mindspring.com


Dream Scene magazine #5 - This is the final edition of Dream Scene, which is,
quite literally, people's dreams, plus dream-inspired and relevant artwork,
and even some dreams illustrated in cartoons.  It's a wild trip too, with many
of them rivaling any psychedelic ever done on purpose- and there's no analysis,
just unfiltered description, in the dreamer's own words.  This is an extra-big
issue, since its the last, and back issues are available for $4.00.  Its a
shame that this is the last, but they've all been a lot of fun.  Write to:
Dream Scene Magazine, 3902 folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94110-6138


Factsheet 5 - #60 - Another huge issue- a must have for anyone who produces
a zine, and highly recommended for anyone who likes to read them.  This
issue has lots of good, practical info.  Tells how to cash those checks
made out to the zine, Mary Fleenor tells how to avoid the psychopaths that
you might attract, plus a debate on zine quality- and how to avoid the
pitfalls that make some lame.  As usual, tons of listings of zines,
cartoons, albums, and art that you can't find anywhere else.  6 issues $20.
Factsheet Five, PO Box 170099, San Francisco, CA 94117-0099


The Fisico Nuclear Experience - Sept. 1996 - More strange adventures of the
masked wrestler/physicist/magician with wierd powers and weirder wrestling
opponents, as they fight and practice high tech/black arts all over the
country.  This zine chronicles the different stories, schedules, and events.
of El Fisico Nuclear.  Real nice looking booklet form now, too.  $8/6 to
Viva la Lucha Publications, PO Box 937, Brea, CA 92622-0937  Lyger@aol.com


Giants & Little People in Fact and Fiction #7 - The next issue will be the
last of this particular zine, where Bob Nelson explores the genre of size-
both midgets and dwarves, and giants.  This particular issue concentrates
on this genre in comics, comic books, and cartoons, with lots of examples.
Also, more updates on midgets/giants in movies and TV shows, plus a large
section on real stories of midgets, including midget rap and gospel groups,
the famous actor Billy Barty, and the tragic story of Herve Villechaize.
$1 to bob Nelson, 75 Hale St. #1, Beverly, MA   01915


GrooVee CheeWaWa #1 - Another zine from Austin Texas, which shares the
mailing address with Lost Armadillos in Heat, and probably people as well.
There's lots of Texas-oriented stuff (including the legendary Austin music
scene), like LAIH, but also some great rants, jokes, and other articles from
the point of view of a city and culture that never really left the late 60s.
It's a fun scene, if you've ever been there, and this zine gives a really
good picture of what its like to live there.  $2 to Lost Armadillos In Heat
113 West 31st Street, Austin TX  78705

Hungry Maggot #5 & #6 - Highly recommended. Chock full of conspiracy info,
disgusting comics, strange movies and stranger zines, wild articles, and
especially, the tons and tons of great artwork by Eric York and others.
The dominant theme is horribly mis-shapened monsters committing unspeakable
acts- which makes the zine live up to its mission of "high weirdness and
low culture".  I especially liked the "Hell Kitty" cartoon parody of
"Hello Kitty".  Also, lots of ads and info on other zines in the same extreme
style.  Only $1 each for a thick zine to: Eric York, 2912 N. Main #1,
Flagstaff  AZ  86004


Illicit Underground - V1#1 May/June/July 96 issue - I had heard that there
is a growing underground/alternative culture in Pennsylvania, but I never
saw anything from it until I got this zine.  There seems to be on helluva
scene, and IU captures it quite nicely.  Excellent technical production, plus
all the chaos, artwork, rants, and info you'd expect from a GenX/Libertarian/
underground magazine.  Also, with a "zine within a zine",they have a special,
independent secttion on sci-fi and role playing games.  Lots of fun, and
indispensible for anyone living in the South-central PA area.  $1/issue
(checks to Round Table Enterprise)  Illicit Underground Magazine, PO Box 7486
Lancaster PA 17604-7486   IllicitU@aol.com


Jay Harber - Notes From Oblivion - Free in exchange for audiotape or SASE.
Jay suffers from a degenerative eye disease, and isn't able to read zines,
but he loves to listen to them on tape.  Plus, he'll trade his zine and
other works in exchange for tapes.  Tape someone reading your zine aloud,
and send it to him for free by printing "Free matter for the blind and
Phys. Handicapped" on the outside.  Jay Harber, 626 Paddock Lane,
Libertyville, Il 60048


JND Pseudo Zine - Not exactly a zine "issue", each one is unique, and pulled
together from a lot of different and constantly changing sources.  Ranges
from heavy philosophical essays and debates, to music, movies, zines, fringe
resources, and other interesting bits.  Very pro-libertarian, eclectic
orientation, and interesting explanations of the Buddhist philosophy that
JND also practices.  Great lists too- possible source for collectors and
trades.  No price listed, but he seems to like trades: JND Pseudo Zine
PO Box 613, Redwood Valley, CA  94570


Laissez Faire Books -Huge selection of books on liberty, lots of "conservative"
material, but overwhelmingly oriented to the more libertarian positions on
economics, education, censorship, gun control, and law.  On the Internet,
subscribe to the list at BookNews@LFB.org for new books reviews, or order
online at orders@LFB.org.  web: http://www.LFB.org   800-326-0996
938 Howard Street #202, San Francisco, CA 94103


Liberty Tree books - Big source of political works, focusing on the writings
by and about the US founders.  Also, with books on many other current political
topics; a mixture of right-wing/conservative and libertarian-oriented works.
Lots of good stuff for anyone concerned about the government and societal
decay, with stuff ranging from dry analysis to PJ O'Rourke to Paladin Press.
800-927-8733 - The Independent Institute, 134 - 98th Ave. Oakland CA 94603


Mongoloid Moose #22 - The big news this time is the death of the Bullet Proof
Hyundai, featured in adventures in many previous issues.  Also in this issue
is the return of Major Stress, who takes aim at the "children", who are in
reality, a lot less "innocent" than people believe.  Plus, Doug gets taken

The Obliviositer issue # 10101 - A brief bit of time off from the "True Army

for at the screen-printing shop, Yul Tolbert tells of working at McDonald's
(the horror!), Sean Fehrenbach recalls the terror of delivering pizzas for
Dominos, with other strips by Robin Bougie, Adam Larson, and more.  This

Skeptical Inquirer - March/April 1996 - The new format looks great- full
color, just like regular magazines.  This issue's big story is about the
military's 20-year, 20M$ program on psychic spying.  The result- a complete
flop, waste of time and taxpayer money.  Carl Sagan has an essay about the
relationship of truth to science, pseudoscience, and ultimately, civilization
itself.  Plus, an exploration of the historical claims of vampires, versus
fictional accounts, and lots more.  Great for keeping your bullshit detector

of timely -and needed- info from the Libertarian party.  This one has the
special report on the LP, detailing the libertarian philosophy in general,
how they would handle things quite differently than they are now, and their
stand on the issues.  Much of this may be old hat to people familiar with the
LP, but there's lots of people who have never heard of it, and this reprint is
a great way to become familiar with it.  Plus, more survival/preparedness/
self-suffiency info, hard-hitting political cartoons, and tons of contacts.

contacts, and tons of on-target political comics.  Lots of good info from
the survival/preparedness field, how to be thrifty/independent, and info to
keep up with the government's nefarious schemes.  A special in this issue
reveals the gov't plan to seize and ultimately ban automobiles with draconian
"emissions testing", which is actually just another property grab and power
increase.  Plus, lots of zines & slackness, comics, and other alternative
info.  Recommended.  Sugg. $2 donation to: Evans, 11-15 45th Ave. Long Island
City, NY 11101

Trouble - Twisted comics by Jerry Collins, *definitely* for adults only.
There's quite a bit of "furry" characters, lots of latex, mechanoid warriors,
sinister characters, plus fun with "Bob" being disciplined in the furry
pleasure dungeon.  $3.50 from Wildcat Press, Box 167, 48 Shattuck Square,
Berkeley CA 94704 - also ask for their catalog of furry, subgenius, and other
zines.  The artist, Jerry Collins, who does tons of great SubGenius art, is

The Twilight Zine VI - on the front line in the battle against the alien
conspiracy, this is full of comix, reviews, artwork, and stories, much of
it in the general outer space/aliens motif, with a Capt. 9-Ball comic.
It concentrates mainly on the comics and art, with a few poems and a small
review section, and scattered oddities, such as a great ballot for electing
a new Pope.  $2 from The Twilight Zine, c/o Andrew, PO Box 85581, Tuscon,
AZ 85754-5581


the Watcher - Summer 1996 - Journal of the Order of Shaitan, the Baltimore-
based successor to the Church of Satan.  Lots of contact info, books, tapes,
and ads for other covens and related groups.  Also included is lots of real
newspaper articles of violence, corruption, riots, rapes, etc.- evoke a
weird mood much like that new "Millenium" show- plus fring mysteries as
revealed by Dr. Franklin R. Ruehl.  As a whole, its better than TV for
showing the decay of society- and the pitiful attempts of the fundie "prayer
warriors" are duly noted- which are, more often than not, thinly disguised
grabs for money and power.  As a whole, this is a good focal point for
active satanic/thelemic groups.  Single issue $6, annual $23- Gargoyle Prod.
Magister Ron Mephisto, S.P., 708 S. 51st St.  Baltimore MD 21224


The West Virginia Surf Report #12 - Lots of random commercial/stream of
consciousness bits mixed together, with stories and other short bits.  The
"art house funnyz", regular cartoons with the punchline left off so as to
render that hip, strange, and ambiguous feel of so much "art".  Plus, a tour
diary with an (obviously fake) punk band was quite clever and actually on-
target.  Plus, rants, and assorted oddities, which tend to go for the
confusion effect.  12 pages/$5 per issue, but he also trades for equivalent-
sized zines.  WV Surf Report, PO Box 43662, Atlanta GA 30336-0662
