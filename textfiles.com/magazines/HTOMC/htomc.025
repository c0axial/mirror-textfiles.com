                TONYA HARDING WORLD DOMINATION TOUR:
                        ONE KNEE AT A TIME

    ...or maybe not.  Did she do it?  Does it really matter at this
    point whether or not she was involved in planning the attack on
    Kerrigan, or whether or not she was glad it happened?  Are we sick to
    the stomach of all the sanctimonious commentators and talk-show hosts
    bellyaching about the general lack of morals and ethics in today's
    society, and how "winning" is now so important that it overshadows
    all notions of fair play?  Good.

    The fact is, the media, by effectively making Tonya look like a
    "Bad Girl", has done her a bigger favor than winning any Olympic
    medal will ever do.  Sure, Nancy is getting all the high-dollar
    promotions now, but a few months after the games, nobody will know
    who she is. The problem is that she's just too "Good".  She's too
    close to the pure, wholesome "girl next door", taking her place besides
    Mom and apple pie.  Deep down in our cultural heart, we might put the
    good girls up on a pedestal, but its the "Bad Girls" with the low-cut
    dresses, tire-spinning sports cars, and attitudes, that get our winks
    and sideways glances. This time next year, Nancy will be admiring her
    trophies on the shelf-nobody else will know who she is.  Tonya will
    have her own talk show.

    Or, maybe they ought to change the event.  Maybe it should be Nancy
    vs. Tonya with baseball bats on the ice. I'd bet on Tonya. Or, maybe
    when she does her Playboy spread, maybe she should lie on top of a
    pile of clubs and bats.  Maybe she is ACTUALLY the most modern
    incarnation of ERIS herself.  Maybe all those rough edges are there
    for a reason- maybe we should get down and WORSHIP someone who would
    beat the shit out of bad drivers with a tire-iron, do burlesque dances
    in a wedding dress, and marry psychopathic jerks. THAT's someone who
    comes from the REAL world.  Plus, she has a tight, muscular butt.
    Deification procedures are in progress.

    Tonya jokes:  Tonya is now making commercials for "The Club".
    At her performance, the music will be "The Kneecracker Suite"
    New cheer in Lillehammer: "Come on Tonya, break a leg!"

             OFFICIAL COMICS OF THE 1994 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES


*** A-Bomb #1 - More adult x-rated cartoon adventures with somewhat predictable
themes: being abducted by martians for an orgy, an intergalactic adventure,
etc.  Most of the artwork here is in the anime' or Manga-looking stylized
characters.  I've often wondered why there isn't more real animation along
these lines.  I also liked the "Exposition" look at cartoonists. Venus Comics.

*** Aesop's Desecrated Morals - A twisted look at the old fables, done by
Doug Wheeler and a host of other different artists including Rick Geary,
Phil Foglio, Matt Howarth, and many others, each with a 1-page modern
adaptation with a twist.  Stories range from outrageous, to politically
correct, to sick and twisted.  Magnecom (Rip Off Press)  800-468-2669

*** Beanworld #21 - word is that Eclipse is going out of business, so this
might be the last unless another distributor is found.  In this surreal other-
universe, this one has the story of the first time that Professor Garbanzo
discovered the Four Realities.  Strange, complex stuff-this is a whole complete
universe with neat characters-and is supposedly based on DNA. Eclipse comics

*** Beavis & Butt-Head #1 - It was only a matter of time before they had their
own comic.  Every bit as gross, violent, and puerile as the show- which makes
it worth a look.  The "activity page" is great- its how to make the Land-O-
Lakes butter Indian girl look like she's topless.  Marvel Comics.

*** Beavis & Butt-Head #2 - The boys go on a rampage in a funeral parlor.
Also, war stories by Mr. Anderson, and how he saved himself with a fart.
Activity pages: restaurant pranks.  Marvel comics.

** CUD #5 - After having his Kundalini awakened and landing in the hospital,
Bob meets the neurotic, abused, paranoid multi-personalitied girl of his
dreams.  Plus, a funny look at hetero paranoia over the gays in the military
issue, "Fiddler on my Face", and the "Moon in the Tree" looks at tourism.
In all honesty, this one probably deserves a ***, but for some inexplicable
reason, it just doesn't grab me like some other comics.  Fantagraphics Books.

**** Horny Biker Slut #7 - More cum-drenched, perverted action as the HBS
takes on the ultimate-stud Highway Patrolman, motorcycle repair-sluts, black
bars, and intergalactic sex-slave empires.  Extremely explicit.  Last Gasp.

**** Itchy & Scratchy Comics #2 - This issue follows the making of their 2nd
movie, which is supposed to be a non-violent romantic comedy.  Itchy is 
determined, however, to include as much violence and mayhem as possible, which,
in the end, turns out saving the movie to the delight of fans who WANT the
violence and gore.  There's more than a subtle slam here against the moralistic
anti-violence crusaders who want to control what WE see and hear. Bongo Comics.

*** Magnesium Arc #1 - A brand new comic by Matt Howarth.  Although this one
doesn't leave this reality plane, its a good comic about one of Matt's favorite
subjects, electronic/alternative music, and the whole independent scene.
Lots of music contacts, plus Sonic Curiosity strips.  Iconografix.

**** Naughty Bits #2 - Cartoons by Roberta Gregory.  In "Bitchy Bitch goes to
Hell", besides dealing with the frustrating aspects of day-to-day life, she
also has to put up with loony catholics as well as loony protestants.  Plus,
"Penetrating the Smut Glut", she looks at pornography, misunderstanding between
the sexes, and how lesbians get around it all.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Negative Burn #6 - Outstanding stories in this anthology are the "Vixen"
vampire story by David Lloyd, and "Conditioned" by Phillip Hester.  Plus, 
another episode of "Kilroy is Here" by Joe Pruett.  Many of the others are
of the artsy/sketchbook sort.  Caliber Press.

*** Nina's All-Time Greatest Collector's Item Classic Comics #1 - which is
actually about Nina's views on the often dark, twisted, and cruel aspects of
romantic relationships.  Naturally, this is the Valentine's day special.
Especially good is the short "public service announcement" on the new social
disease, afrAIDS, which is the irrational fear of AIDS.  Dark Horse Comics.

*** Ren & Stimpy #17 - A halfway decent and original story.  R&S make it big in
the world of high fashion with their garbage-wear creations. But, they blow it
by appearing nude in a magazine, which becomes the new fashion.  Plus, more
adventures of the Canadian Kilted Yaksmen.  TOO DAMN MANY ADS!!  DC Comics.

** Simpson's Comics #2 - as part of a "scared straight" tour of a local prison,
Bart is accidentally left behind, at the mercy of Sideshow Bob.  Plus,a neat
flip-side Ill-Fated Romance Comics, with a Patty & Selma story.  The comic
does a good job of keeping up with humor level of the TV series.  Bongo Comics.

**** Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Flaming Carrot #1 - crossover comic- the last
time it was the TMNT appearing in the Carrot's comic, now its his turn to be in
theirs.  This one has them investigating the ruins of a strange ancient
civilization unearthed by an earthquake, and the disappearance of a science
team.  Story by Bob Burden. Mirage Publishing,PO Box 486 Northampton MA 01061

**** Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Flaming Carrot #2 - Flaming Carrot and his
Mystery Men meet up with the Turtles and the soldiers.  Once there, they are
attacked by massive numbers of the strange flaming creatures. Mirage Publishing

*** The Tick: Karma Tornado #2 - The Tick, along with Cleopatra, Eli Whitney,
George Washington Carver, a washed-up actor, 2 kids, and a Tyrannosaurus,
continue the strange competition as part of the Earth team.  OK story, but the
Tick wasn't big (or strange) enough in the story.  New England Comics Press.

**** XXXenophile #9 - Lots of explicit, xx-rated stories with a D&D flavor,
by Phil Foglio and inked by different artists.  These are fun, neat stories
with actual entertainment value beyond the wild sex.  Palliard Press.  

**** You and your Big Mouth #2 - cartoons by Pat Moriarty, with stories by Pete
Bagge, Dennis Worden, R.L. Crabb, Kim Deitch, Henry Rollins, Dennis Eichhorn
and many others.  Most of these are 1-4 page strips, and its a GREAT mix of
different styles- both in the imitative style of Moriarty, and in the variety
of subject material- in a virtual who's who of underground comics.  A definite
must-have.  Starhead Comics, PO Box 30044  Seattle, WA  98103

**** You and your Big Mouth #3 - Pat Moriarty continues with these great
collaborative comics.  This time it includes stories by Peter Bagge, Joe
Coleman, Penn and Teller, Adam Parfey, Henry Rollins, Mary Fleener, and many
others.  Lots of nightmares and strange dreams, strange but true adventures,
and comic industry in-jokes.  Don't miss it.  This time by Fantagraphic Books.

**** Zippy Quarterly #4 - More surrealistic ponderings from the supreme Pinhead
as they take on the absurdities of modern life.  Plus, a special story on how
Zippy and Griffy get caught up a gun-toting, apocalyptic coffee cult.  Media
culture will never look the same again.  Fantagraphics Books.

                          Another Tale of B0B (tm)

              by mccla_d@cs.odu.edu (dennis mcclain-furmanski)


   The City of FalAlFer and What Bob the Expedient Did to Piss It Off

     Bob's hidden halls, which no man or God has seen and lived to talk about
it for more than a few brief paragraphs in a very bad prose, were rumored to
hold a thousand and one different terrible things which a God might do to
divert his time, but which a mortal could either have a really swell weekend
with or else kill himself on.

     But, being a lot closer to omnipotence than the avarage ex-mortal (who
just get a lot closer to mother nature as their bodies decompose),
occasionally even these one thousand and one potentially dangerous delights
were just not enough to please him and to keep his attention up.  So he did
decide to once again walk on one of the planets and to do as his whim told
him.

     So he went to the fourth planet from a yellow sun, where the humans of
that galaxy lived.  And he did search the planet until he found a halfway
interesting place, a city in the middle of a hot, bare desert.

     But inside the city walls there were many farms and gardens and groves,
and seemingly unlimited quantities of water.  It was a city of oasis from the
desert.  So, he sought out the reason for this marvel.  He assumed the guise
of a dusty caravaner, and went to the Temple of All Gods in the city (where
any god was allowed to have a little shrine and his own theme music played in
it, so even the humbler gods with no temple of their own could get in on the
action).
     "Where is the shrine and priest of Bob?" he asked a wizened old man.
     "There isn't any, son."
     "Why not?  Isn't this the Temple of All Gods?"  Bob looked around, double
checking that there was indeed no shrine.
     "Well," the wizened old priest drawled out, "there ain't much call for
one.  You're the first person to ask in about, oh, since I was an acolyte."

     Bob was mollified... he was practical enough to realize if there wasn't a
consumer demand he wasn't going to have a shrine.  Oh well, maybe he could ask
this guy instead.
     "I'm suprised.  Oh, well.  Maybe you can tell me, why does this city
flourish in the middle of barenness?"
     "The city takes care of us."
     "Yeah, but why do you flourish?"
     "Like I said, the city takes care of us... it's alive, you know."
     "Lemme get this straight," the dusty caravaner who was actually Bob said.
"FalAlFar is one big sentient city?"  He sent his awsome Bobness forth to see
if this was, indeed, true.  He got his answer as the old wizened priest gave
his.
     "Yes... it's something to do with the silicon imbedded in the granite we
use to build this city.  Or so some learned circles say.  I say, don't confuse
the issue, it's magic and that's that.  Silicon, indeed.  Humph!"
     "Well, here's a little gold, set up a shrine to Bob, will you... you can
keep twenty percent as long as the job gets done right."
     "I never could understand a god that condones graft," the wizened old
priest said as he tucked the pouch inside his volumuous robes, "but I'm human
enough to.  Alright, a cool little shrine will be dedicated to Bob as soon as
I can get the temple handymen off of their holy wine break.  So long,
stranger."

     As Bob walked through the city, he marveled at its complexity and its
being well maintained.  He marveled that this was done, but he soon found out
why.  He saw people talking to certain buildings or others, and getting
answers to the questions they posed.  And, whenever a person did something
wrong (lying, littering) a building would shout "I saw that!  Pick that back
up!"
     How could a child of Bobism survive in such a sterile and law abiding
atmosphere?  He could almost understand why the marketplace was composed
entirely of tents... as property is theft and most business exchanges are a
bit illegal on one party's or the other's side.  This situation must be
subversed, but slowly.

     An idea hit him as he watched the monotony of the white marble, silicon
enhanced buildings.  An idea that would be a coup for any god, yet even a
mortal could do it.

     He ran back to the bazzar as fast as his present body's feet could take
him.  Bob ran into the marketplace again, and looked around, trying to find
the sort of man he wanted.  Then, he found it...

     He walked over to the dirty caravanner, who was leaving with a full load
of exotic spices and little plastic dolls that this city made so well.
     "Are you for hire?" he asked the man.  "After you're done with this, I
got a special one time load for you to pick up."
     "Yeah, Mac," he said, not groveling and fauning because he did not
realize it was a GOD that he was talking to.  "Right.  You can afford the one
thousand gold it takes for a special load."
     "Here's twenty five now," Bob said, summoning the gold into his pocket
from some nearby other person's pocket.  "You can have the remainder when the
job is done.  Meet me here when you come back, in two weeks.  If you don't
meet me here, I'll use the rest of the gold to hire assasins to track you down
and make you wish you hadn't cheated on your taxes."
     "You got it.  Now, I gotta get out of town before they ask if I've paid
the export fee.  Wagons, ho!"

     Then Bob went through the city.  He looked, and looked, and finally he
found what he was looking for.  An actually empty lot in the middle of the
city, just large enough for his purposes.  It was even convienently located,
next to a money lender's shop and a temple, and a brothel.  This was GREAT!

     That night he rented a room and began his plans on paper. He had three
sets when he was done, one for the city planners and some of the constructors,
one set showing only what certain other people were to build out of, and the
third, master set that actually showed it all and revealed Bob's master
plan...

     He rubbed his hand in glee at the prospects of the monumental mischief he
had planned.
     The next day, he went about establishing his assumed identity, buying
expensive clothes and hanging about in bars, and buying little "I want to do
business" types of gifts for the city council and certain key businessmen.  He
also found out exactly what the local building codes were, that every building
had to be of the silicon impregnated marble and it had to be connected by a
qualified magic stone technician.

     He'd have to subvert one to get this opperation going, so he found one in
a bar and made friends with him, buying him repeated drinks.  Then he informed
the bartender that his tab was not only paid in full but well in advance.  Bob
would have no trouble getting him out of the way when it came time to.

     The next day he submitted his plans to the general council for a tavern
he wished to construct on the vacant site.  "I just love this place, and I
think I want to settle down here," he lied.  With most of the council well
grafted, he had no problem getting the deed to the lot and permission to build
a small tavern and inn.
   The plan was afoot....

     Within the week the groundwork had been laid and the marble floor put in.
Due to the advanced building techniques used (actual levers and pulleys, real
high tech if you know what I mean) they made it quite far in the week.

     Then the caravanner came back.   "You guys keep building, I've got to go
see about some work."  So Bob took the caravaner and went back into the
bazaar, hiring a gang of stonecutters.  "I got a SPECIAL job for you guys, so
come with me to the quarries."

     They all went to the quarries, where Bob gave one of his sets of partial
plans and directions.  "Yeah, don't dig from the normal quarry site.  Start
digging into THAT hill, and when you reach the marble let me know."  For Bob,
using his mighty Bobness knew exacly what they would find behind the cliff
face.  Meanwhile, he and the caravanner got plastered on a really fine vintage
that he had picked up in his travels.

     When the work crew had brushed away the lesser rock and dirt, they were
amazed at what they found.  They found not white marble, but black marble with
silicon and other impurities.  "Hey, boss, the technicians say not to touch
this shit.  That it might be impure or something."
     Bob grinned a grin that extended about 12 feet off of his face.  "I know.
Just do it."
     And he began giggling as he poured some more wine.

     They stayed there two days and nights until Bob felt they had enough of
the black marble to foul up the white marble.  Before dawn on the second day,
they snuck back into town, after causing a landslide over the area they had
dug out to erase their tracks and evidence of cutting.

     Then Bob bribed a man to let him use his warehouse.  He would have broken
in but that would have attracted the attention of the city.  He did keep the
black marble under cover so the city wouldn't realize what he was going to do
until it was too late.

     Close to a month passed before the main structure was finished. On the
night that was done, Bob brought in the wagonloads of black marble and began
putting them in place himself....

     It was a good thing that Bob was a god and had nearly inexhaustable
endurance, for he worked all night putting the black marble slabs into the
correct places, and mortaring them into place with the right materials, and
covering up the black marble with pencil thin slabs of white marble.

     In the morning, he consumed a bottle of vodka for his next job, going to
the bar where he left the drunkard magic marble technician.
     "Heysh," he said, "it's mysh good buddysh, whatsh hish name!"
     "Hi," Bob said, trying to put the slouch in his body and the slur in his
voice.  "Heysh, I got my bar almost done, wanna check it out and have a round
on meesh?"

     Bob helped the staggering technician out of the bar, and they started
singing a happy drunkard's song...

     "KEEP IT QUIET!" the city said imperiously, which made them sing a little
louder so they could be heard over FalAlFar.  "I SAID, KEEP IT QUIET OR I CALL
THE COPS!"  But before the city could make good its threat, they were inside
the new bar.
     "Hook 'er up, Charlie,"  Bob said, going behind a magicaly stocked bar
and fiddling with some switches.  The bar's circuits were in passive mode,
merely reporting everything the city did.
     "Hmm.." the drunk technician mumbled in a snockered man's overcareful yet
futile concentration.  But, being drunk, and everything being well disguised,
he could not see the black marble, or the controlls behind the counter.
Finally, he got out his tool bag and began the connections in silver wire and
silicon putty to the main streets of the city.  "Itsh done, and I need a
drink."

     Bob slipped some grain into the rum he handed over, so it was potent
enough to put the drunkard to sleep.
     Then he brought the bar into active mode.
     "Bar," he said in a cool, level tone Gods get when they expect their
commands to be obeyed, "program the city to accept me as a random prominent
citizen, not as my assumed identity."
     A voice much like the one used by the city said, "You got it boss.  What
else?"
     "Any time I look like I'm about to do anything illegal, blank out the
city's senses and cause some misdirection somewhere else."
     "Got it."

     Now it was time for Bob to do something truly holy.  He simultaneously
appeared to all of his priests in their dreams, saying "The once off limits
city of FalAlFar is now EASY PICKINGS, if they split the take 70/30.  This has
been a Bob-O-Gram."

     Thus, slowly did the crime rate go up at FalAlFar, which vexed the once
proud city mightily.  Bob made sure they didn't steal too much, for then the
city might get serious about cracking down on crime. And no one understood why
the little bar between the moneychanger, temple and whorehouse was so
sucessful.  Except Bob, who passed it on to one of his priests when one got
there, and the bar itself, who was known to pull even greater stunts when no
one was watching. But this, of course, is another tale...
