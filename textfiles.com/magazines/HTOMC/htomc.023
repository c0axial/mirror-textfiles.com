          A Thanksgiving Prayer - William S. Burroughs

            (spoken with a slurred, gravelly drawl)
 
          ---------------------------------------------

Thanks for the wild turkey and the passenger pigeons destined to be shit out
through wholesome American guts.

Thanks for a continent to be spoiled and poisoned.

Thanks for Indians to provide a modicum of challenge and danger.

Thanks for vast herds of bison to kill and skin, leaving their carcasses 
to rot.

Thanks for bounties on wolves and coyotes.

Thanks for the American Dream to vulgarize and falsify until the bare lies
shine through.

Thanks for the KKK.  

For nigger-killing lawmen feeling their notches.

For decent church-going women with their mean, pinched, bitter, evil
faces.

Thanks for "Kill A Queer For Christ" stickers.

Thanks for laboratory AIDS.

Thanks for Prohibition and the War Against Drugs.

Thanks for a country where nobody is allowed to mind his own business.

Thanks for a nation of finks.

Yes.  Thanks for all the memories.  "Alright, lets see your arms".
(You always were a headache and you always were a bore.)

Thanks for the last and greatest betrayal of the last and greatest of human 
dreams.

A Tokyo company announced in July that it will market videos consisting soley
of the corpses of torture victims from the war in former Yugoslavia. A company
spokesman said that, although "Japanese have feelings of love even after
someone dies," he thought the videos would be popular because only foreigners'
bodies would be shown.

Gary Richards, founder of a Jupiter, Fla., company that sells lifelike models
of human feet for $74.95 a pair, told the Palm Beach Post in March that he
sells about 150 pairs a month to the 4,000 or so foot fetishists who subscribe
to his catalog/newsletter, Fantasy Foot News.  A sideline is that women who
model their feet for Richards also furnish their used shoes for sale to
customers.  "Most guys are into the odor," said Richards, "so we wrap [the
shoes] in plastic.  The odor will stay for a long time if you keep it in
plastic, and then steam it when you want to use it."

Among the products recently brought to market: "PooPets", animal figurines made
of cow manure supposedly hand-made by the Amish in Lancaster, Pa., and placed
in flower pots as an attractive fertilizer; handcrafted dog beds (starting at
$900, plus another $250 for the draperies to hang from the four-poster models)
from the New York designer Joseph Biummo; "Fudge on Fire," fudge laced with hot
peppers, from the Fudge Farm in Paso Robles, Calif.; and caskets customized in
colors of Southeast Conference football teams, from Loretto Casket Co. in
Tennessee. 

Among the products offered for sale by members of Japan's Chindogu Society (an
invention support group) and reported recently in *Details* magazine are: 
"Puss in Boots," a set of four dust slippers enabling cats to dust your flor
while they're walking around; waterfilled compartments that strap on your legs,
enabling you to wash clothes by walking virgorously; a rack worn on your back,
secured by a shoulder brace, on which clothing can be hung to dry while you
bicycle around; and a flashlight powered by solar panels.

*The Baltimore Sun* reported in June that New York City artist Todd Alden
recently asked 400 art collectors worldwide to send him samples of their
feces so he can offer them for sale in personalized tins.  Said Alden,
"Scatology is emerging as an increasingly significant part of artistic
inquiry in the 1990s."  The feces of Italian artist Piero Manzoni, canned
in 1961, rcently sold for $75,000.

                              Choices
                              by Rikki Rockett

      Stang sat in his cabin in the woods.  He was quite depressed, for he was
faced with a very troublesome dilemma and was running out of time to make a
decision.  He had examined and reexamined both sides of the argument countless
times, but to no avail.  His mind began to wander, and he began to recall the
various events which led to this terrible situation...

      It was about one thousand years ago, thought Stang, when Andy Pandy, the
spiritual leader of the human race, climbed the tallest mountain to speak with
Bob.  He was gone for about a year; when he returned he spoke these words to
his eagerly awaiting people;
      "I have spoken with Bob, and this is what he has said; to say that an
act is right means to say that an act is at least as stupid as any of its
alternatives; to say that an act is a duty means to say that it is more stupid
than any of its alternatives.'  Thank you and goodnight.  Please drive
safely."
      Someone yelled, "Wait!  What does that mean?"
      "Oh yes," replied Andy Pandy.  "I almost forgot.  Bob made me memorize a
list of actions which are intrinsically stupid.  Number one;  Hitting a car
with a whiffle bat.  Number two: Saying `ear'.  Number three:  Crushing skulls
with anvils.  Number four: Eating as much food as possible.  Number five:
Improvisa-"
      At that time Andy Pandy's skull was crushed by an anvil, and the list
was lost forever.

      The confusion which resulted from this event was astonishing.  Bob 
stopped talking to people after Andy Pandy died, so most people were simply
unable to determine which actions, other than the ones listed by Andy Pandy,
were truly stupid; and, in fact, very few people actually cared.  So for about
nine hundred years most people spent all their time hitting cars with whiffle
bats, eating food, saying 'ear', and crushing each others' skulls with anvils.
      "But then I came along," thought Stang.  "I sure changed all that!"
      Stang was a child prodigy; he was always coming up with something new
and stupid to do.  He was aptly characterized by his mother who once said:
      "Stang?! Stang is definitely not the type of child who would poke your
dog's eyes out, no matter how hungry he is.  But he has been know to sexually
molest a goat on occasion, if you know what I mean."
      Stang simply had a great intuition, a knack for the stupid.  As a youth,
Stang developed the Sponge-filled Duck Shirt and the Bucket o' Urine, among
other things.  As he matured, Stang discovered the art of giving speeches in
public restrooms, the most famous and stupid of which was How the Mouth Walks:
      "Most people would disagree with you if you said that a mouth could
walk.  But they are all... right!  But if one could, this is how it would.  He
would start with a `stomp stomp stomp' and a `shuffle shuffle shuffle', and
he'd move across the floor.  He'd then turn left and walk for 13.6 feet.  Then
he'd do a flip!  Assuming that he landed on his feet, the mouth would then
turn right three times and take twenty paces.  The mouth would then realize to
his amazement that he was directly diagonal from his original starting
position.  Ear!"
      "Ah, those were the days!" thought Stang.  "If only things were that
simple now!"
      Stang soon became a hero of sorts, and was elected "Chief Conditioner of
Stupidity," a title last held by the late Andy Pandy.  He enjoyed his
celebrity status at first; but as time wore on he became increasingly annoyed
at the fact that people didn't really know very much about stupidity, or even
care about it.
      "How in the world are we going to maximize the amount of stupidity in
the universe if nobody knows what it is?" he complained.  "There must be
something that is the most stupid thing to do, and it's my job to find it and
tell everybody what it is."
      So Stang began his search for the most stupid action, and announced that
he would be accepting suggestions from the public.  The news of his search
sparked a renewed interest in stupidity; several people were even quoted as
saying that they wanted to be the ones to discover the most stupid action.  As
Stang received more and more ideas, he found that they could be grouped into
two similar, but nonetheless distinct, types.  This was apparently due to an
equivocation over the word "stupid".  One group seemed to define "stupid" as
"ignorant", which resulted in ideas like "eating everything" and Stain, you
dork, why don't you shut up and find something better to do before I kick you
ass?!"  The other group defined "stupid" as "Pointless", resulting in ideas
like "eating everything" and "scratching you head until you drop."  All of
these ideas fit into one or both of these categories, and all were quite
stupid; so Stang naturally decided that the most stupid action must be one
which maximizes both ignorance and pointlessness.  Soon it was quite obvious
to Stang what the most stupid activity was.
      "After much serious deliberation." announced Stang, "I have determined
that the most stupid action is the one which maximizes both ignorance and
pointlessness; and this has led me to an historic decision.  It is quite
obvious that trying to blow up the sun is the most stupid activity, and it's
also pretty neat!  So from this day forward, in accordance with Andy Pandy's
thesis, the human race will be unswerving in its dedication to fulfilling this
end; all human efforts will henceforth be directed towards blowing up the sun. 
Ear."
      Stang's decision was hailed as a stroke of genius, and for quite a while
everyone was quite content to spend all their time working on trying to blow
up the sun, comforted by the belief that they were being truly stupid.  But
one day, one of the leading philosophers of the time, Captain Fee-Fob, made
the astute observation that if the sun were actually blown up, the potential
for stupid actions in the future would be eliminated; therefore, he concluded,
blowing up the sun must not be the most stupid action, for it would clearly
not maximize stupidity.
      This began the greatest controversy in the history of mankind.  Never
before had society been so divided on an issue.  Hard feelings ran deep on
this subject; families were ripped apart, as brother was pitted against
brother and sister against sister in a battle of theories that grew more and
more violent by the minute.  Even those who didn't really care about the issue
were drawn into the conflict because of the simple fact that, according to one
protester, "all this controversy is pretty fun!"  Stang himself rather enjoyed
the controversy at first, and toyed with the notion that arguing about whether
or not to blow up the sun might be even more stupid than actually blowing it
up.  But as the tension between the two sides escalated into a flurry of
skull-crushing, Stang knew something had to be done; he just couldn't figure
out what.  So he arranged a conference with Captain Fee-Fob and several other
of the most formidable thinkers of his day to help him decide whether or not
to blow up the sun.
      After a few meetings it was pointed out that even if blowing up the sun
eliminates the potential for stupid action in the future, it may be the case
that the stupidity of blowing up the sun would outweigh the sum of the
stupidity of all potential future actions.  Another important issue was raised
by Mrs. Penny, author of the controversial and critically acclaimed book
called The Void of Stupidity (My Toilet) Mrs. Penny pointed out that before we
can know whether blowing up the sun is the most stupid action or not, we must
know whether stupidity is contingent upon human existence.  If not, then it
really doesn't matter whether or not the potential for future stupid action is
eliminated; after all, what state of affairs could be more stupid than the
absence of humans?
      Than came the hardest blow to Stang's plan.  It came from Captain Fee-
Fob, who pointed out that "trying to blow up the sun" has a goal - namely, the
destruction of the sun - and therefore is not really pointless, for
pointlessness implies the lack of a point or goal.  Therefore, according to
Captain Fee-Fob, blowing up the sun fails to meat the requirements for the
most stupid action.
      "If we're concerned with being stupid, we're not concerned with ends,"
said Captain Fee-Fob, "and should not be concerned with blowing up the sun."
      This upset Stang very badly, and he disbanded the conference.  Then he
received this news from his chief scientist in charge of blowing up the sun,
Mr. Poo:
      "Mr. Stang, I believe that we are now ready to blow up the sun.  We have
finally created a rifle powerful enough to fire toilet seats directly into the
center of the sun at speeds of over 120 miles per hour."
      "My God," replied Stang.
      "Our best calculations estimate that it will probably take at least ten
or twelve toilet seats fired at that speed to blow up the sun.  We are now
merely awaiting the go-ahead signal from you.  Ear."
      "Thank you, Mr. Poo.  The signal will be as follows, but remember that I
am now only telling you what the signal is, not actually giving you the go-
ahead.  The signal will be: `Mr. Poo, you may now begin the countdown sequence
for the demolition of the sun.'  But now I must go, for I have a very
important decision to make, as you well know.  I will return to announce me
decision in exactly one week."
      So Stang set out to his cabin in the woods, built at the very spot where
Andy Pandy's skull was crushed by an anvil.
      "And here I am," thought Stang.  "I've been here for six days, twenty-
one hours and thirty-three minutes, and I still haven't made any progress
towards making a decision.  Is blowing up the sun the right thing to do?  Is
it in fact my duty?  It seems that Captain Fee-Fob may be right after all.  If
"stupid" means "Pointless", then, strictly speaking, blowing up the sun is not
really stupid.  But does "stupid" mean "pointless"??
      Stang pondered this for a while.
      "If it does, then it hardly seems possible for anyone to act stupid; for
if one is trying to be stupid, then stupidity is a goal.  If one is trying to
produce the most stupidity, one is striving for a state of maximum stupidity,
which is a goal; one is therefore not acting pointlessly, and hence is not
acting stupidly."
      Stang thought some more.
      "In fact, it may be impossible for anyone to act pointlessly.  For
example if I eat food, I have a goal - namely, having eaten food - and so I
could not eat food pointlessly except by accident.  In fact, the only way I
could do anything pointlessly, strictly speaking, is by accident.  But I can
clearly act stupid; otherwise Andy Pandy's thesis would be wrong.  Perhaps I
have made a mistake in defining the most stupid action as the one which
maximizes both ignorance and pointlessness."
      Stang though about this for a long time.
      "Perhaps even trying to define the word `stupid' was a fundamental
mistake.  Perhaps `stupid' cannot be defined in terms of other, more simple
qualities - perhaps it is irreducible.  It seems that neither `ignorant' nor
`pointless', nor any combination of the two, really captures what is meant by
calling something `stupid'. But what else could it mean? `Irrational'?
`Senseless'? No, those seem to be more complicated terms than `stupid'.  I
must have been fooled by the fact that all things which are stupid seem to be
either pointless or ignorant, into thinking that `stupid' actually means one
or both of those term.  No, I think that stupid is a simple quality."
      Stang considered the implications of this.
      "Well, even if I can't define `stupid', I can at least try to determine
which things possess the quality of `stupidity'.  It seems that, in general,
actions are more stupid than objects; while a Sponge-filled Duck Suit may be
somewhat stupid, wearing a Sponge-filled Duck Suit is considerably more
stupid.  So it seems that the greatest amount of stupidity must be produced by
some action.  Would blowing up the sun produce the most stupidity?"
      Stang asked himself this question over and over.
      "It does seem possible to say that human existence is necessary for the
greatest amount of stupidity; for if actions are generally more stupid than
objects, then the absence of humans engaging in stupid activities would
greatly decrease the total amount of stupidity in the universe.  This
dismisses Mrs. Penny's theory, which is unfortunate; for now I am left with
the task of determining whether the stupidity of blowing up the sun outweighs
the sum of the potentials of all future actions.  Maybe I could just try to
blow up the sun, but make sure that I fail.  Then the stupidity of all future
actions could be added to the stupidity of trying to blow up the sun.  But if
I make sure that I fail, it wouldn't really be trying; it would just be firing
toilet seats into the sky - very stupid indeed, but clearly not the most
stupid action.  It is my duty to determine whether blowing up the sun is the
most stupid thing to do.  But how?  I guess there is only one way."
      Stang left his cabin and went back to the city, to where he was
scheduled to announce his decision.  A crowd of over forty people had gathered
for his announcement, but at least that many more were watching on TV as Stang
stepped up to the podium.
      "OK, everybody, I guess we're going to have to take a vote.  Those of
you watching at home can vote using the electronic voting devices connected to
your television sets.  Ready?  OK, hands up, everybody who wants to blow up
the sun."
      Stang paused for 17.3 seconds.
      "Now everybody who doesn't want to blow up the sun."
      Stang paused for 22 seconds.
      "The votes are in, and it's a tie - six votes for, six votes against.  I
guess we could flip a coin, but I don't have any change.  Does anyone here
have change for a dollar?"
      Nobody had change for a dollar, but someone said, "I have a nickel you
could borrow."
      "Thanks dude," said Stang, and flipped the coin - then caught it in
midair.     "Oops, I forgot to say what `heads' or `tails' mean.  `Heads'
means we blow up the sun, `tails' means we don't"
      Stang flipped the coin which landed on it's side and rolled into the
gutter.
      "Damn!" yelled Stang.  "I owe you a nickel, dude.  Does anybody else
have change?"
      Nobody did, but a little boy said, "I have a tennis racket at home. 
There's a letter `P' on the end of the handle, and you could spin it around
and see which way the `P' lands."
      "Well, what are you waiting for, kid?  We don't have all day!  Don't
just stand there with that stupid grin on your face! Go get it!"
      The boy ran home and returned about thirty minutes later with the tennis
racket; by that time, however, a large portion of the crowd had dispersed.
      "Thanks, kid," Stang said, "You're a sweetheart.  Now if the racket
lands with the `P' right-side-up we will blow up the sun; if it lands upside
down we won't."
      Stang spun the racket, which landed on it's side and rolled into the
gutter.
      "Strange," said Stang.  " Now what do we do?  How does one decide these
things?  How about `rock, paper, scissors'?  I'll need two volunteers."
      Two people raised their hands.
      "Ok, come up here you two.  Now on three, form your hands into the shape
of a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors.  Remember, rock breaks
scissors, scissors cut paper and paper covers rock.  The winner will make the
final decision.  One...two...three!  Oops, a tie.  Try again.  One, two,
three! Another Tie! This isn't working at all. Let's try something else.  We
could draw straws! bring some straws up here."
      Some straws were produced.
      "I'll hold the straws and whoever draws the shortest one gets to decide. 
Now each of you can come up here and pick one straw."
      Just then a gust of wind blew the straws from Stang's hand and into the
gutter.
      "Damn!" yelled Stang.  "Well, that just about exhausts the conventional
ways of making decisions.  I guess we'll have to think of some new ones.  How
about.. the first person who can... smash their head into a tree!  That person
will decide.  Ready, go!"
      Nobody moved and someone yelled, "I'm not doing that!"
      "Ok, how about the first person how can smash their head into a dog!"
      Several people began chasing a dog, but the dog tripped and fell into
the gutter before they could catch it.
      "Thumbwrestling!  We will thumbwrestle to see decides.  You two, come up
here.  The two of you will thumbwrestle and the winner will make the final
decision.  Ready, go!"
      The two people, we'll call them person x and person y, began to
thumbwrestle and person x won.
      "All right! I won!" yelled person x.  "Now what are we deciding again?"
      "I think we're deciding whether or not to start a volleyball league!"
said someone from the crowd.
      "A volleyball league?  Of course I want to start a volleyball league!"
said person x.  "Let's start right now!  Come one, everybody!  Let's go to the
volleyball court!"
      "Wait, don't go!" shouted Stang.  "Come back!  We haven't decided
whether or not to blow up the sun!"  But nobody heard him - everyone was too
excited about the volleyball league, and who can blame them.  "Mr. Poo, come
back! After all my hard work! Oh God..."
      Stang grew very angry.
      "I'm going to do it anyway," he said, making his way to the laboratory
where the toilet seat rifle was kept.  "I just can't let this opportunity go
to waste."
      Stang entered the laboratory, found the toilet seat gun, took aim, and
fired several toilet seats into the sun until it finally blew up.

                              EAR!

                              END TIMES!

  That's right!  The "Last Days" may be here, but Friend, YOU can be the
  LAST WORD in AVANT-GARDE ELEGANCE in our FULL COLOR T-SHIRT!  As seen
  above [hard-copy HToMC only] Robot Dinosaur has the facial features of
  J.R. "Bob" Dobbs, beloved SubGenius Guru.  A close examination reveals
  a wealth of mechanical and engineering detail.  Gronk!  But this shrunken
  reproduction can barely HINT at the overpowering effect the vibrantly
  colored original has.  YOU MUST HAVE THIS SHIRT!


  SLACK THREADS(tm) is a fully accredited tentacle of The Church of the
  SubGenius(tm) and has received a dispensation to use the Dobbsian likeness.
  This shirt was designed by Harry S. "Dr. Howl" Robbins, a longtime church
  contributor.  Watch for MORE shirt designs from SLACK THREADS in the very
  near future.  And if "Bob", "SLACK", or "SUBGENIUS" mean nothing to you,
  we suggest you buy a "BARNEY" T-shirt instead.
