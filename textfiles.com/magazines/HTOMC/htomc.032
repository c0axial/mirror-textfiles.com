- Jonestown After Dark III - GUT BLOWOUT at the first ROC of AGEs con in
  Charlotte, NC!!  Mondo video, killer DJ, lights, Jonestown Jungle Juice,
  lap dancers, and THE MACHINE!!!!  Check this zine for upcoming dates for
  ROC and other worthy conventions.  [ROC has been added to the HToMC's
  "regular" must-attend yearly events, taking the place once held by MOC
  as the hard-core party con.  And congrats to the Jonestown crew who always
  throw the best (and wildest) parties.

- Just a brief note to let you know that The Hour of Slack is now
  being heard on WMSE - 91.7 FM in Milwaukee, WI.

  "The Sunrise Hour of Slack" can be heard every Thursday morning
  from 5 to 6 AM.

- Tapes listed in previous editions of HToMC
  from I Need Medical Attention Records & Tapes
  are available for $5.00 each plus shiping

- While applying for a job with a Federal Agency, a applicant came accross
  the question, "Do you favor the overthrow of the government by violence,
  coup, or subversion?"  The applicant, perhaps a little ignorant of the
  world, penciled "subversion".

- New Music - *The Big Bang Payoff*, by Indian Rope Burn - Although its
  somewhat hard to classify this album, like their others, is somewhat
  "industrial", part NIN, part techno, part everything else mixed together,
  hard-driving with tons of effects, B-movies, and assorted bulldada thrown
  in the mix.  A bit harder - and more complicated than the previous *Sex
  Party*, the songs are a blend of strange and often dark humor, conspiraces,
  and an extremely slanted (but appropriate) way of looking at the world.
  Great stuff, plus they are an Official(tm) Doktorband.  Contact them at
  gg records, PO Box 1784, Kent Oh 44240 (no, they were not shot, see the
  interview below..)   mikecrooker@delphi.com, irb666@aol.com

- An MIT student spent his summer going to the football field dressed in a
  black and white shirt.  Each afternoon, he would arrive and sprinkle some
  bird seed all over the field.  Then he would blow a whistle and would
  watch as the birds ate the seed.  At the first football game, the referee
  came out, blew his whistle and the birds engulfed the field.  It took more
  than 15 minutes to clear it.  The student wrote his thesis on this
  phenomena and graduated.

Perpetuity God began serving a nine-month sentence for indecent exposure

waiting in line at a coffee shop. He said he did it so that women "could
have some type of awareness of God." according to police reports.

  Marin Superior Court Judge Lynn O'Malley Taylor addressed the defendant
as "Mr. God" at a hearing Tuesday, and sentenced him to nine months in
Marin County Jail.

  God was born Enrique Silberg in Cuba.

   &^&^&^&^&     Klinton's Favorite Komics      &^&^&^&^&


*** A-bomb #9 - More XXX-rated manga stories, this issue including "Tavern
Tales" with a sexy valley elf, magical books, summoning a furry famale
familiar, and a perverted plant on an alien planet.  Enough strangeness or
story twists to make it stand out.  Venus Comics

*** Beavis & Butthead #26 - The boys decide to go to school, but accidentally
get on the bus to a private school - with no chicks!  When their antics land
them in trouble, they are sent to the dominatrix- with full dungeon & s/m
supplies.  They escape - in schoolgirl dresses meant to humiliate them, and
manage to get on the bus to a *girl's* private school.  Actually a good,
consistent story for a change.  Marvel Comics.

*** Brinke of Destruction - 1 of 3 - After mankind is given a death sentence
for causing too much pollution (hey- it it was so bad, wouldn't the pollution
be *enough* to do the job??), an Armageddon machine is activated which starts
causing global chaos and destruction.  Brinke, half-sister of the evil Arcana
who set the machine in motion, is opposed to this and travels to the earth's
core to stop the machine, in order to give mankind a second chance.  Nice
cover by Boris Vallejo.  High-Top and Brinke Stevens

*** Brinke of Destruction - 2 of 3 - As the world is engulfed in chaos,
Brinke travels to Stonehenge to find an ancient artifact to stop the
Armageddon Matrix.  In order to get it, though, she undergo a spiritual
quest in order to confront and overcome all her fears and problems.  The
dialog gets a little stilted here, with just too many "revelations" a bit
too quickly to be credible, but there's also some decent female-superhero-in-
too-tight-outfit action.  She also gets a change of costume, from that little
green outfit that she wears to all the conventions. High-Top and Brinke Stevens

*** Buck Godot #6 - The station's robot attack is stopped, but still nobody-
even the Prime Mover-, know what the old machinery is for.  In the meantime,
Buck is visited by an unknown race, long since banned and suspected destroyed,
who will take possession of the Winslow, in exchange for a cure from the virus
ravaging the humans.  It is discovered, however, that the Klegdixal are
responsible for the virus- which means possible death for the embassy and
permanent banishment for them all.  Fun, complicated story.  Palliard Press

***** Dawn #2 - Darrien awakens on the far shore to see a demon defeat an
angel in battle, and take his halo.  In the second part, Dawn visits
Ahura Mazda outside the gates of Heaven; he asks her to visit Hell and
bring back Lucifer's halo- a parting gift that is a bridge between heaven
and hell.  She gets it, and returns to NYC.  Every panel is a full-color
masterpiece from Joseph Michael Linsner.  Sirius.

***** Dawn #3 - Darrien meets Dawn on the streets of NYC, and after a brief
exchange, she gives him a halo- the one she took from Lucifer.  When she
disappears, both angels and demons appear, wanting the halo, and Darrien
fights them- and kills them.  And, by possessing the halo, Darrien moves
even deeper into strange, bigger metaphysical realm.  Great artwork.  Sirius

**** Eightball #16 - More angst-narratives, including "Like a Weed, Joe",
Squirrel Girl and Candy-Pants, plus another installment of Ghost World.
Much more personally-involved, and surreal than any of the other comics
centered around following characters through mundane on the outside, but
psychologically intense adventures.  See if you can spot the hidden
Darwin Fish.   Fantagraphics.

**** Hate #20 - Buddy gets stuck looking after his niece and nephew all day,
and nearly goes apeshit from the abusive brats.  These kids are the perfect
archetypes of all the uncontrolled monsters who make pure asses of themselves
in public every day- the ones who desperately need to be strangled.  I wish
I had Buddy's patience.  Plus, his dad finds the "perfect" barber shop.
Fantagraphics Books

*** Hate #21 - Buddy's mother, sister, and his girlfriend Lisa all unleash
such a wave of bitchiness and bossiness, that a minor war between the sexes
breaks out in the Bradley family.  After taking a boy's night out with his
dad, they get in big trouble when the alcohol has a reaction with his heart
medicine.  When the dust and the arguments settle back down, the women are
back in charge, as usual.  Fantagraphics.

*** Meat Cake #0 - reissued - The first set of Meatcake stories, all with
those wild, innocent-looking pictures that completely conflict with the
often psycho stories.  Just like little kids, even though they may look
totally cute and innocent, they're actually wild demons in disguise.
Lots of fun- I hadn't seen this first issue from 1991.  Fantagraphics.

**** Meat Cake #5 - Lots more strange, quirky, gothic tales- some with points,
often brutal and cruel, others just plain whimsical and silly, with many of
the same odd assortment of characters.  Plus, the uniquely distinctive artwork
and doodles.  Always lots of strange fun.  Fantagraphics.

**** Naughty Bits #18 - The war between the sexes starts to heat up as
Kenney, the nerdy guy that Midge screwed while on her wild vacation, keeps
trying to call her, and finally shows up at her door.  It couldn't be at a
worse time, as Midge has been obsessed with stalkers/murderers/abusers in
the media all week, which has made her a paranoid wreck, on top of her desire
*not* to see Kenney.  And, she lets him have it.  Good story, a lot of which
is very true, but lacks a critical bit of perspective (51% of all domestic
violence cases are committed by *women*...) and strays a bit too far into the
PC feminist camp that stereotypes men as violent abusers.  Fantagraphics.

***** Stalking Ralph - The Post Brothers take a contract to kill The Residents,
the wild alternative band from San Francisco.  It turns out to be tough, as
the Residents are actually infinite-dimensional beings.  After they explain
this to Ron and Russ, they decide to fake the murders- substituting the family
of the old man who hired them, and taking their payment of the immediate
retirement of every artist and entertainer in the world- but even this turns
out to be a gambit by the Residents, who need to clear out the world's
cultural drek so their new machine will work.  Ron gets his revenge... Aeon.

***** Sunglasses After Dark - the comic adaptation of the book by Nancy
Collins.  A young girl turned violent vampire is locked up in an insane
asylum, and manages to escape when one of the guards attempts to sexually
abuse her.  Great story and artwork, in color.  Verotik.  Nancy Collins also
appeals for donations to help yet *another* comic store being censored by
the "morality" squad- this time, its Planet Comics in Oklahoma.  For info
on this, contact Verotik Publishing, Attn. Planet Comics, Box 64859,
Los Angeles, CA  90064

**** The System - #1 - by Peter Kuper - Roving story, "Slacker"-style, of
interlocked stories of a subway stalker, racist violence, police corruption,
high-powered finance, political intrigue, terrorism, slime, and all the
big and little things that make up life in the big city.  Moves from one
set of experiences/problems or "systems" to another, telling a story
completely in pictures.  DC Comics/Vertigo Verite

**** Tank Girl: Apocalypse #1 - As end-time cults go nuts and mystics of all
sorts invade the land, Tank Girl is strangely unmotivated to do anything,
and feels like shit.  The reason: she's pregnant!  Is it Booga's?  Will it
be one of the end-time Messiahs?  Plus, check out the ad for the Tank Girl
blow-up fuck doll on the first page.  DC/Vertigo

**** Tank Girl: Apocalypse #2 - Booga throws a huge drunken party to celebrate
the new child, and all manner of monks and cultists show up.  Tank Girl slips
away, only to be kidnapped by the Baal cult, who take her to a secret gov't
lab and hook her up to a machine which speeds up the pregnancy just so they
can sacrifice the child.  Meanwhile, the countries of the world erupt in
wars...  DC/Vertigo

**** Tank Girl: Apocalypse #3 - The action picks up as Tank Girl's friends
bust into the lab and rescue her.  On the way out, they meet and abuse
Princess Di, who tells them of a secret hideaway that all the world leaders
will use to wait out the terrible wars and destructions.  Once there, they
blow away the NWO guards and find a spaceship.  It takes them to a secret
base on Mars, where they learn that all of the world's leaders are part of
the Baal cult..and are sacrificing all 8 billion people on earth.  DC/Vertigo

***** Tank Girl: Apocalypse #4 - Tank Girl and her friends quickly take over
the secret Mars colony, then throw an End of the World party as they helplessly
watch the Earth die in nuclear explosions and meteors.  During the party, she
goes into labor, but the baby isn't Booga's...she had been fooling around with
her tank, and the baby is 1/2 tank.  The next story is going to have one
helluva time making any kind of continuity with this one... DC/Vertigo

**** Vamperotica #7 - Some of the best, original vampire stories to come
along in quite a while.  Not the same old gothic-slasher-angst plots, but
new ideas in an expanding storyline.  Plus, they will soon come out with
stories including their cover-girl, Luxura, much like the Dawn comics.
Nice twists to stories, its not *just* blood and sex.  Brainstorm Comics

*** Vamperotica #8 - Only one vampire story in this issue, but its an
interesting one in which Lillith, the "first Eve" ignored in so many
biblical accounts, is actually the first vampire, as well as the serpent.
Other stories include a gun-sorta-ninja assassin who get tangled up in
government skullduggery.  Plus a neat vouyeurism story.  Brainstorm Comics.

**** Vamperotica #9 - The war between the vampire Kith and the werewolves
continues as a vampire is captured and kept in a cage in a nightclub, slowly
being starved to death, but is rescued by one of the Red Militia.  Also, a
great story about a sexy vampire "evangelist", and the continuation of the
GunFighter story.  Original stories and great action.  Brainstorm Comics.

*** Vamperotica #11 - New twists on the vampire genre, including "Miracle
Baby", of a girl who grows substituting sex for her unknown taste for blood,
"Handyman 3000" where a vampire copes with a future world of bio-clones and
synthetic blood, and "Into that Silent Sea", with a strange mix of vampires
and sea monsters.  Brainstorm Comics.

*** The Worlds of H.P. Lovecraft - Issue #1 - Illustrates the Statement of
Randolph Carter, where a criminal behavior researcher, guided by legends
found in an ancient copy of the Necronimicon, goes in search of a graveyard
containing a portal to the ancient, unknown world.  Only his shaken
assistant, who didn't go down, survives.  Caliber Comics.

*** Young Witches - Book 2 - 2 of 6 - As the young girls remain trapped and
drugged, Jack the Ripper continues his bloody campaign, which in turn draws
Sigmund Freud and Sherlock Holmes to the area.  As part of his investigation,
Holmes search leads him to the secret and perverted stage show, using the
captive women as servants and performers in a particularly spectacular
performance.  Very graphic- with a variety of sexual acts or perversions to
interest and disgust nearly anyone.  Eros Comics.

***** Zero Zero - Jan/Feb 1996 - Great collection of shorts from some of the
best artists in independent comics.  This issue features another installment
of "The Chuckling Whatsit" by Richard Sala, Zippy the Pinhead explores
commercialized consumer cults in "Bestworld" by Bill Griffith, more strange
revelations in "The Strange Secret of Molly O'Dare" by Kim Deitch, plus more
wild shorts.  Great stuff.  Fantagraphics

***** Zero Zero - March/April 1996 - One of the best, and most mind-bendingly
bizarre collection of short stories around.  Includes serial stories "The
Strange Secret of Molly O'Dare" by Kim Deitch, "The Chuckling Whatsit" by
Richard Sala, and "Homunculus: The Eunuch's Tale" by Mack White.  Also,
includes "the Legend of the Florida Man-Fish" by Mike Diana, plus much more.
This comic has tons of pages, lots of great stores.  Published bi-monthly
by Fantagraphics.

titles!  SLG 979 S. Bascom Ave., San Jose CA 95128

Caffeine #1 - New comics by Jim Hill - Although no coffee itself is present,
the stressful jitters it inspires flow throughout the short stories. Affairs,
jealous husbands, lost loves, rejection, and general alienation between the
sexes string the stories together, plus, it takes some well-deserved raps at
the "cool" scene, girls who stay with abusive boyfriends, etc.  The "I'm So
Pissed" section takes close aim at some real cultural stupidity, with
nobody- including the Slacker/GenX crowd, excepted.  Interesting bunch of
characters too, with neat artwork that flows much like a movie.

Johnny the Homocidal Maniac #3 - Johnny not only criticizes the pretentious
"hip", the incompetent and inconsiderate posers, he also enjoys hacking them
into little pieces.  Goaded onward by the styrofoam figures who talk to him,
Johnny goes on murderous rampages, mutilating and torturing his victims,
while being un-killable and un-capturable himself.  Wild stories, extremely
graphic violence, easily on par with the Post Brothers.  Not for the
squeamish.

 Murder Can Be Fun! #1 - In the first comic version of Johnny Marr's
infamous zine, this first issue focuses on large scale man-made disasters
through history.  Includes the Hartford Circus Fire (1944,dead:168), the
Nashville train wreck (1918,>100 dead), the Triangle Factory Fire, that led
to building safety codes, where 146 people died, mostly women leaping to
their deaths to avoid the fire, the Port Chicago explosion that killed 320,
mostly black workers, and the Boston Molasses Flood that killed 21 in a
tidal wave of sticky molasses.  All true, and illustrated by different
artists.  As bad as the disaster are the negligence that led to the mishaps
and the coverups and treatment of the victims.  Definitely a must-have.

               The Lawn

               by NENSLO

Mrs. Nenslo stood by the kitchen table, sternly drying her little
white hands. She had That Look on her face. Nenslo could feel it without
even looking up from the triangle of toast which had stopped halfway into
his open mouth. Slowly, delicately, he bit off a corner. Guilt turned
the hot buttery morsel into rubber cement studded with broken lightbulbs
but he chewed and chewed and finally swallowed the grating wad. His
shoulders had risen up to his ears as if expecting a stout whack. He
glanced shiftily toward her waist, forced a grin and whimpered, "Yes,
dear?"

He knew, and she knew he knew, but if he could get her to say it
and support his pretense of ignorance then he was innocent. Having gotten
her to tacitly validate his lie he would be victorious for seven ego
points.

"This would be a good day to take care of the lawn," she said.
"Yep, you're absolutely right! It sure would!" He grinned,
leaning back, nothing in his words actually committing him to do it. She
just stood there. With That Look. And waited.

The dam burst.

GUILT. A scalding mudslide of guilt buried him, scorched away his
flesh and left only a Nenslo-shaped cavity. She knew he knew.

"Okay. I'll do it right after breakfast," a little mousy squeaked.

Limp, he shoveled cold greasy cardboard into his mouth and she
drifted silently away.

On Planet X, everybody lives right next door to everybody else.

Nenslo saw Stang across the fence, scuffling through knee-high yellow
grass. When their eyes met, they simultaneously blurted, "Can I borrow
your..."

After a shamefaced moment Nenslo said, "Gotta mow yours too?"

Stang nodded. "Yeah, an' god damn 'Bob' borrowed my mower a
coupla weeks ago an' never brought it back."

"Damn," said Nenslo, folding his arms atop the fence. "Borrowed
mine last month." He rested his stringy beard on a bony freckled arm and
cast his eyes down among Stang's baked weeds. "I just hate to bother the
guy, you know?"

They started asking around. With thousands of nextdoor neighbors
somebody had to have a mower.

The 'Brow's was a shattered heap. Lies had made his into a robot
dinosaur. Agon's was converted into a combination ELF wave detector and
musical instrument. Mostly, though, it was "Bob" has it... loaned it to
"Bob"... last week, last month, last year... never brought it back.
There wasn't a mowed lawn on the planet. Except one.

They sat on Stang's back step in the shadow of his dog.

Nenslo scraped at the dry clay with a stick. "Who you scareder
of, Ivan? Your wife... or 'Bob.'"

Stang spat like a man. "Shit. I ain't scareda 'Bob.'"

Nenslo slapped his hands on his bony knees. "Okay? 'Sgo."

"Bob's" lawn looked great. It was perfectly flat, perfectly green,
perfectly square. They shuffled up the walk between conical shrubs as if
they were walking to the gallows. From around back came the drone of a
lawnmower. "MY lawnmower," they each thought.

They headed around the side of the house to the back and stopped
short. There was Connie in a tiny little pair of cutoffs and a teensy
little striped t-shirt, striding along behind a big shiny red lawnmower
out of a dream. Connie was enough to raise the dead, but that machine was
godlike. They were instantly in love. They seemed to be floating above
their bodies, entranced by the roar of the biggest, shiniest, reddest,
greatest lawnmower in the world.

Connie rounded a tree and saw them. She waved with her whole
body, perfect teeth shone between scarlet lips, and she pointed. On the
patio was a fringed green hammock in a standup frame, and in it was "Bob."

A copy of Rank magazine was tented over his face and from under the lower
eave protruded The Pipe, benignly smoking. The mower's roar mellowed as
Connie flawlessly piloted it toward the back of their endless lot.

They stumbled over and looked down at "Bob." Nenslo nudged Stang,
who flapped an exasperated hand at him and squeaked, "uh.. 'Bob?'"

"Bob" rose majestically, as if he'd never been asleep, and in one
smooth motion took the magazine off his face, pivoted in the hammock and
placed his snow-white deck shoes on the patio's elegant Italian tiles.

"Well hi there boys!" he said in his smooth Bing Crosby baritone and rose
to his feet, placing a big warm hand on a shoulder of each of the bony,
sweating cowards who quailed before him. There was a gleam in his eye as
he said, "I'd like to do you two a favor..."

The sun was going down when Stang and Nenslo shuffled home. They
were dusty, elated and exhausted, babbling like schoolboys.

"Man, oh man," Nenslo cried, and smacked one knobby fist into a
grimy, blistered palm. "What a honey of a machine!"

Stang gouged him with an elbow and grinned, "You don't have to
tell me a thing! Did you see me back there?" He flew a hand upward like
a jet. "VROOM!"

They laughed like fools, threw an arm around each other's
shoulders and stumbled limply on, smelling each other's sweat.

Nenslo hung his tired head down and watched his dirty sneakers
walk. They were covered with grass clippings. So were his pants, his
shirt, his hair. He shook his head and said, "Man, I'd like to set that
baby loose on OUR yards some time. I bet it'd take care of 'em in..."

They froze. Stark terror clawed their souls. Stang murmured "Oh,
shit..." and they looked deep into each other's eyes as if to say,
"Goodbye, old friend."

Connie brought another perfect martini and purred, "The boys did a
pretty good job, didn't they?"

"Bob" was standing by the door into the garage. "Mmm, yeah.
Pretty good."

He gazed mildly on row after row after row of lawnmowers, then
smoothly shut the door.

"What are you thinking?" Connie sighed.

"Oh... nothing..." said "Bob."

Kent, Ohio is the home of a searing noise machine called Indian Rope Burn, a
four piece electro/organic hybrid who hit with the impact of an IRA nail bomb
in a shopping mall.  While the industrial genre flounders and wallows in its
own maudlin seriousness, IRB triumph by retaining *the impact while stripping
away the pretense.  The following interview took place via email*.

QUESTIONS 1. Regarding songwriting method/division of labor  2. Don't
remember.  3 How much impact, if any, has formal training had on IRB.
4. Regarding juxtaposition of humor & dark subject matter in IRB material.
5. Self-description of genre.  6. Regarding sample sources   7. Influence
of media/technology on IRB.  8. Band's relation to Kent State, Ohio, &
whether they minded the massacre. 9. Regarding Mike's production training,
experience, etc.


                        INDIAN ROPE BURN


1.Mike  Yep, thats it in a nutshell- I sit in my little studio for hours
and hours with the headphones welded to my head listening to samples and
sequences, then I give the tape to Clay...
Clay: I write the lyrics, The rest of the band contributes their individual
parts as they see fit, then we beat each other up and much blood is spilled
over the final arrangement.  The result is true Democracy-BROKEN BONES!

2.Clay: Those who re-write history are doomed to copyright it.  The major
motion picture will explain it ALL.
Mike: Everyone has been bought off and placed into "protective custody"
if you know what I mean...

3.Clay: "Formal Music Training" means very little to me.  If you practice
enough, you'll sound like....someone ELSE!  Who needs that.  We are much
more interested in "informal music training" getting ideas from non-musical
sources.  My biggest influence right now are cheesy horror movies and low
budget exploitation films.  Stuff like that motivates me to write songs
more than listening to other people's lyrics or anything like that.
Mike: I didn't pick up the guitar until I was 17.  My parents got worried.
They thought that I'd lost my mind (which was true).  Then I started making
some money, so they shut up.  they were worried that I was pissing away my
future (almost true).  I only put the guitar down long enough to learn how
to use a computer.  Keyboards are still a mystery to me, but I kinda like
it that way.  Too much knowledge is a dangerous thing(g).  I'd rather it
be intuitive than logical.  I spend most of my life being logical...
Besides, most people who know too much theory usually end up trying to
make the rest of us pay for it.

4.Clay: Humor is very important and *real* elements in music and life.  In
fact, I think a morbid sense of humor is a requirement for life in this
modern new age-a-go-go society.
Mike: Or this band...
Clay: I don't think using humor somehow makes a work of art less serious,
it only gives the listener a different view of the same landscape.  As for
taking one's self seriously...a band taking itself seriously is not entirely
a bad thing.  Music has become so divided these days that the "cut and dry,
black and white, funny or not funny, this genre or that, I'm in MY CLUB"
attitude is the only thing people seem to understand...well, we're here to
"blur" those distinctions and show that things are not just one way or the
other, that you either have to be serious or humorous-but not both...fuck
that.  Our songs do have an overriding sense of urgency to them, but after
a while some humor will show through-at least if we're honest, it will.
Mike: Juxtaposition is really the word here.  It's not that we aren't
willing to take what we do seriously, we're *very* serious about how things
turn out within the songs, we just use humor as another element.  It's a
very black humor too, with sarcasm and irony being the best way to express
ourselves and in making a point.  The late comedian Bill Hicks once said on
his popularity in England and not at home, "Americans don't get irony".
Some people miss the irony in IRB.  As with all of our songs, everything has
a purpose; there are no extraneous bits put in there to be clever, it all
serves the song.  On the other hand if we were to assume a posturing and
serious tone all the time, I think it would get cartoonish pretty quickly.

5.Clay: I'd lump IRB in the I-don't-give-a-fuck-Techno-Metal-Death-Trap-Hell
Funk-Disco Weaving-Soul-Groove-Acid Bath-in-the-Barn-Slippery-Slime-Cult
branch of Modern Music.  If that doesn't work for you, try "industrial".
Mike: We try not to be pigeonholed.  I don't feel comfortable with being
lumped with any one genre of music, which I think is reflected in our music.
Some people aren't happy unless they can categorize it, others do it just
because they want to protect *their* music.  It's an identity thing and I
find that confining.  I mean, we're classified as an industrial band because
we use machines and samples.  O.K., but thats not what we *are*.

6.Clay: I think Mike is referring to sampling.  The more obscure the sample
the less likely we'll be sued for copyright infringement...
Mike: Check! I like weird old scratchy vinyl (about 3000 or so and counting
and forcing me out of my house) which is also my big source for samples, but
I don't listen to that much contemporary industrial music.  Vinyl and old
B-Horror and Science Fiction movies are more influential.  Musically, ummm...
Eno, Joy Division, Wire, Mission of Burma, Husker Du, Black Flag...y'know,
Art/Punk Rock(g).

7.Clay: Techno-Boredom, jeez where do I start with a concept like *that*?!
If nothing else the media has shown itself to be *the* most influential
element in modern times.  Its seductive powers are enormous, even affecting
those who have guarded themselves against it.  The ability to sell you
everything from a new dish detergent to a War in the Persian Gulf has
indelibly and permanently affected not only our most private condition and
behavior.  The media is not just "New and Entertainment" to most people, but
a link to a mystical world view where everything makes sense (or the media's
idea of what makes sense).  To the population at large, the mass media is
the final authority; the truth is dealt in 30 second sound bites, the grand
arbiter of taste and fashion and finally the Lord of our thoughts, the
gospel--a religion in and of itself.  "Facts" are gathered to support already
existing opinions and the nation makes its most critical choices based on the
latest Gallup Poll...ah, just kiddin', actually T.V. is pretty relaxing.
Mike: Oh, I'm at my happiest with a Guiness in one hand and the remote in
the other soaking up radiation...

8a.Clay: Nope, no affiliation with the University.
Mike: Just happen to live here...
8b.Clay: Ohio has absolutely *no* bearing on the type of band or people we
are.  In general, Ohio is too BORING to be scary ("scary" I wouldn't mind,
but "boring" sucks).  The predominant music scene in this area has NO
influence on our music--one listen to Sex Party should make that evident.
My view is more "Big Picture" oriented.
8c.Clay: As for *you* not minding the Kent State massacre...well, I guess
you're not the one who got the bullet in the head.
Mike: I'm friends with Alan Canfora, one of those who got shot (he got it
in the wrist), did a little production work for the Kent State Task Force
for the 20th anniversary in 1990 and we played some benefits for them in
NYC...I think you can tell what I thought of it.

9.Mike: As for the production side of things, college was an expensive waste
of my time as the college production department blew.  I learned more the
first day out of school than the five years in it.  I've had some long
discussions on this topic (production schools) on the net with people who,
once they found out what I did, asked me about schools for production.  I
told them it was a waste of time because they don't teach the one most
important class of all: Real Life Situations.  Just knowing how to push the
buttons to get the cool sounds doesn't even *begin* to prepare you for
production.  It's more how you can handle personalities while pushing *their*
buttons.  Psychology or Juggling would be a better class to take to become a
producer.  You're dealing with some very different personalities and egos
from day to day and under different levels of stress.  I've done other
projects for friends, but mostly I spent years working at home getting my
shit together, and with engineer Greg D. Feezel who runs Electro-Sound, we
really worked the sounds.  Sex Party doesn't sound too bad for 5 days of
recording and 5 days of mixing.  The new one, The Big Bang Payoff, we spent
a little more time on, but that's because the new stuff is a little more
complex in scope, but at the same time, a little more raw sounding with more
emphasis on the organic side of the band.  Musically, it's possibly even more
diverse than Sex Party was.  A net friend of mine asked, "In one word or
less, describe the latest IRB album."  "Maximalism." "Maximalism?" "Yeah...
it's one big vulgar display of over-producing."

  The illustrated "Urban Terror" magazine, this website contains

Danzine - vol. 1 #6 - Zine for -and about- "working girls" in the exotic
dancing business, primarily in the greater Portland area, although some
of the articles and info apply to them anywhere.  There's lots of support
and positive encouragement for the girls here, with upcoming regular columns
from them, with ads and resources for them.  Not too much -in this issue-
about the relentless work of busybody censors to shut them down, but that
might increasingly become a priority.  sub-$12/year, and they accept writings

dumbing down of American society, miscelaneous philosophical bits, and info

relationships.  DR is available for $1, trade, or e-mail to hlavaty@panix.com

Fiction, Dr. Tim Leary has questions for people who talk about drugs, and
Bob Larson has questions for coercive cult techniques (like he should know!)
Lots more- real fun stuff here, highly recommended. $1, $5/6 issues (1 year)

the biggest zine/self-publishing reference ever.  A must-have for anyone

powers, and friend to children and oppressed people everywhere.  This issue

kitten killer.  Actually funny, in a lurid and exaggerated style.  $8/6 to
Viva la Lucha Publications, PO Box 937, Brea, CA 92622-0937  Lyger@aol.com

Giants and Little People #3 - Tales of people in the extremes of the size
range, both real and in fiction.  This one starts with a large listing of
movies with big and little people- from obvious ones like "The Incredible
Shrinking Man" to "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman", with a synopsis of each.
A very interesting zine, Black Giantess, is an erotic fantasy zine about
huge, "cruelly sensual African" women.  And, it rounds out with several
pages of actual newspaper coverage of the Robert Wadlow, the world's tallest
man ever, at 8 feet 11 inches.  $1 from Bob Nelson, 75 Hale St. #1
Beverly, MA  01915  USA

Giants and Little People #4 - Continuing with movies and TV shows with
big and little people, this one lists episodes of the Simpsons with that
funny intro couch segment, more movies, plus letters and an in-depth
discussion of the Shrinking Man movie.  Here's my entry: the Friday's
restaurant chain has the "little guy" commercials where he hawks the
various specialty dishes. $1 from Bob Nelson, 75 Hale St. #1
Beverly, MA  01915  USA

Giants and Little People #5 - More on the micro/macro genre, with a look at
shrunken people in books: the Micronauts series by Gordon Williams, and
"Cold War in a Country Garden" by Lindsay Gutteridge.  Plus, lots of other
trivia on movies and books, with letters with even more examples.  Its
amazing how often these themes appear in fantasy fiction. $1 from Bob Nelson,
75 Hale St. #1, Beverly, MA  01915  USA

G.O.P. - Neat little bumper sticker that someone sent.  It has the letters
in white on a red background, with a swastika in the "O" in the middle.
After listening to Dole, Buchanan and Co., its more than a little true.
And, across the top, it lists a bunch of familiar themes that, if you had
heard them in the 30s, you'd feel deja vu- patriotism, "family values,"
right to life, school prayer -- but I take exception with the inclusion of
"gun ownership".  Like all totalitarian societies, the Nazis were some of
the biggest gun-grabbers around, with predictable consequences for the
disarmed.  Anyway, its a great sticker.  $5 for 20, $10 for 50, or $15 for
100 to: GOP, PO Box 441789, Somerville, MA 02144  cash or money order

The Haw River Testimony - Vol. 6 #1 - The official newspaper of Saxapahaw,
which makes Twin Peaks look normal by comparison.  After George Forman had
been elected to mayor, extremist Islamic Shiites and Aryans made it onto the
city council, just in time for the firefight which kicked the ATF's as, who
were in town to investigate election irregularities.  Lots of articles and
ads, which all tie together for a lot of strange fun.  Plus, regular cartoons
with creative dialog, the "Blondie" strip will never look the same.  No
price listed, but send something for postage, at least.  Salmon P. Roe,
320 South Aycock St., Greensboro, NC  27403-2301

JND Pseudo-Zine - Covers lots of various subjects (all written pages),
with lots of mystical/supernatural implications.  Includes first-hand accounts
of Ouija board experiences by the author (yeah, I know its impressive, but I'd
be *much* more impressed if that puck could move without someone's hand on it)
information on the evidence for Bigfoot/sasquatch, lots of great contacts for
religious and strange phenomena, philosophical discussions, and onward to
more mundane but still interesting music/song listings, tape catalogs, and
B-movies (I have a fair number of those albums....)  Much of it seems to be
APA-style from various people, so he might possibly accept further discussions
from his zine.  No price listed, but he seems to like trades: JND Pseudo Zine

Captain Carrot series from DC comics, as well as many other anthropomorphic
comics, plus drawings from other artists.  A quite original interpretation
of the themes and meanings of the cards, with animals in otherwise human
situations, even for someone who doesn't know squat about the inner workings

our backs; he is also a candiate for President running under the Libertarian

of other books on destructive government regulations, political correctness,
civil rights, and how the government is screwing up just about everything it

Little Green Zine - official zine of the band Little Green Men, who play in
the NJ/NYC area.  I haven't heard them yet, but they do seem to be fairly
established in clubs like The Metro in Long Branch NJ, New Music Cafe in

Luke's W-Zine #26 - April 1996 - Personal zine from Luca Valfre, this one
concentrates on lots of photographs, drawings, movie posters, and various
psychotronic themes.  Lots of it centers on some strange parade in Italy,
plus some good Che Guevara pics.  $1 for lots of art, much of it it very
clippable.  Luca Valfre', Via F. Armosino #3, 14100 Asti, Italy

Mail Order Central - one-stop shopping for many different titles- from

nice compilation, with color photos and descriptions.  800-528-1999

man's subliminial god, by hermies purrbuckets - Book explaining the
meaninglessness and futility of human life, and how the only noble thing
to do is to end it.  Rather pro-active in its prognosis, it actively
advocating not only avoiding procreating, but also ending your own
miserable existence.  And, dreary as it might seem, there's a bit of truth
in there- the humans *are* jerked around and fed lies and trained to torture
each other with meaningless "rules" and traditions.  As discarded, failed
experiments of Yeti labs, thats to be expected.  In the meantime, although
few if any will take his suggestions to heart, we can always just wait until
1997....  60 page booket, no price listed.  PO Box 522, New naven Ct 06503

Mongoloid Moose #19 - Scott Wilson's adventure take a nasty turn when he
falls asleep while driving back from working at the Miss America Pageant,

dealing with the stupid DMV/insurance bureaucracies.  Also, includes an
extremely realistic view of Internet flame-mail, 100 Ways to Phone In a
Pizza Order (all of them screwing with their minds...),  weird news, and

NCSE Reports - Fall 1995 - The inside scoop on fundamentalists trying to push
the "creationist" religious agenda in public school science classes, from the
front lines opposing them.  The big news is Pat Buchanan's call for teaching
creationism in all schools, under the same old tired "pro-family" rhetoric.
There are some victories, but with fundamentalists stealthily infiltrating
school boards everywhere, its just going to get worse.  NCSE membership,
which helps out in the fight, is $25/year, and includes 4 issues of this
report plus 2 issues of Creation/Evolution journal.  NCSE, PO Box 9477,
Berkeley, CA 94709-0477

Notes from Oblivion #27 & 28 - Issue #27 (20 pages- lots of stuff!) is a
compilation of bits and pieces from #11-20; tons of jumbled subgenius-style
clip-art, cartoons and meaningful phrases, with artwork and writings that Jay
did much earlier.  Issue #28 (7 pages) deals mainly with a strange, un-named
progressive neurological disorder that Jay suffers from- which, among other
things, is making him go blind.  Some people have given him a hard time for
it, but his eyesight does seem to be extremely bad.  The zines are $2 each,
or FREE in exchange for tape-letters, audio SubGenius productions or sci-fi.
If you have a zine, have someone read it and record it.  Also, write "Free
Matter for the Blind and Phys. Handicapped" on the package and you can mail

The oBliVioSiTeR - Issue 10001 - all comics!  Includes the first part of
Tim's experience in the Canadian Forces, which consisted (typically) of

cake recipe, and more.  1326-15th St. E., Saskatoon, SK  S7N 0R9
[argh..the stars!...they're EVERYWHERe....]

The oBliVioSiTeR - Issue 10010 - All comic issue continuing the True Army
Tales, the writer's real experiences.  In this one, he's shipped out to
actual war games in the field.  It makes me glad I never joined the Army-
with the grunt work, total frustration, etc.  Plus, Robin Bougie draws his
story of living in a little tourist trap named Chemainus, and Randy Chaos
does "Suicide Al Does Acid", and more.  Great comics!  Also check out his

Pulvis et Nihil #10 - As reviewed in Factsheet Five, this is an Italian
zine with various essays that Luca is interested in, plus a series of
creative photographs.  Although much of the writing is in Italian, there are
also English sections- this issue includes an entire section from NOCIRC, the
anti-circumcision group.  Other articles talk about the Church of Satan,
a satiric UFO interview, and info on euthanasia.  Free, but send a couple of
bucks to handle the postage. Luca Valfre', Via F. Armosino #3, 14100 Asti,Italy

Racoon Times #1 - Actually edited by a raccoon, merely xeroxed by humans.
Lots of reviews of some more offbeat bands, not "alternative" but parody,
spoof, and off-genre covers that sound interesting (in a Dred Zeppelin-sorta
way).  Plus, a look at all the different talk and music formats on the radio,
zines, and the start of Raccoon comics.  Only $1 to Bob Nelson (who also
produces Giants and Little People), 75 Hale St., Apt. #1, Beverly MA 01915

RoMSFaFiNA #4 - More musings on Sci-Fi literature, as opposed to movies and
TV shows.  I agree completely about Bujold being good, new stuff.  Plus, Dan
briefly reviews his recent winter reading list: Quarantine World by Murray
Leinster, Star Gate, Three Against the Witch World, and The Crystal Gryphon
by Andre Norton.  Also includes another great ST:TNG parody script,
Microsoft(tm): The Next Generation.  Not really "highbrow" as some evil
dwarf had sneaked into a previous HToMC (and is now being punished), but
accessible to people who read even a few SF books each year (or who read at
all, anymore).  Send your fanzine or letter of comment for an issue to:
Dan Harper, PO Box 194, Concord, MA  01742-0194  danlharp@aol.com

Second Renaissance Books - Winter 1996 - The official source of Ayn Rand and
Objectivist books, tapes and memoirs, they also carry a wide variety of books
on various topics but along much the same philosophical lines. Plus, they have
tons of material on audio tapes, including courses on history, writing, logic,
and philosophy.  Definitely not "liberal", but not exactly "conservative"
either; although similar on many current issues, they aren't afraid to tell
both camps why they're full of it.  Featured items in this issue are tapes of
the Leonard Peikoff Show in AM talk radio in LA, and "In Defense of Truth",
about the rejection of reason and reality.   143 West St/PO Box 1988,
New Milford CT 06776

Second Renaissance Books - Spring 1996 - Controversial books, featuring
"Fighting Terrorism" by Benjamin Netanyahu (a *very* militant conservative
in Israel running against Perez), "Dumbing Down our Kids" on why American
kids feel good about themselves, but can't read, write, add, or *think*,
and a new book examining Thomas Jefferson's vital role in creating the
Constitution.  Tons of books supporting freedom and capitalism, with enough
to piss off both the "liberals" AND the "conservatives".
143 West St/PO Box 1988, New Milford CT 06776

Skeptical Inquirer Nov/Dec 1995 - This issue blows the lid off of the "alien
autopsy" film, which many people suspect as just yet another way to sell
video tapes to the gullible masses.  Plus, this big magazine has articles on
unreliable eyewitness testimony, the GAO Roswell Report, cultural deceptions,
creationists vs. psychic fairs, and lots more.  One of the few publications
to question a lot of things that need questioning.  Single issue $4.95,
6 for $29.50.  Box 73, Amherst N 14226-0703  800-634-1610

Skeptical Inquirer - Jan/Feb 1996 - Tons of articles investigating recent
events and claims, including a Hollywood special effects artist who tells
exactly how to make an alien used in the "autopsy", with a surgeon's
critique of that film, new tests to accurately gauge the success of those
"psychic detectives" who help police (they don't!), how people are fooled
by statistics, and the outright hostility that TV and the movies show
toward skeptics and scientists.  After watching the network nitwits on ABC
trying to "test" the psychics, some balance is needed and this is it.

Solar Age Hemp Paper Report - Spring 1996 - Keep up-to-date with efforts to
re-legalize one of the most harmless and useful plants on the face of the
planet.  In the news, the Navajo Nation will begin a large scale planting,
plus many universities are now doing research on new uses.  Of course, this
is all being opposed by police organizations who fear more drug "problems"-
caused more by the laws themselves than any drug ever could.  The hemp movement
is picking up steam, with tons of contacts and good info here.  Get info on
this from: Solar Age Press, Box 610, Peterstown, WV 24963

Survivor - Vol. 7 #8 - This issue delves back into what's going wrong with
our society, from the desire of every group to ban anything they don't like,

at *true* free speech, and the true effect of gun control- with tons of
storys you'll never see on TV, with what *really* happens out there in reality.
Plus, tons and tons of great political cartoons, ads for all sorts of info/
devices, plus zines and lots of other alternative contacts, from subversive
to slack.  Send donation to: Evans, 11-15 45th Avenue, Long Island City, NY

Survivor - Vol. 8 #1 (Jan 96) - Tons of great hints, ads, and contacts
relating to self-sufficiency.  The main feature, however, is a complete
reprint of Harry Browne's pamphlet on why he's running for President,which
is a damning indictment of the current system and a credible plan for getting
the country out of its current awful mess.  Too bad the networks are only
going to give that free air time to "major" candidates- as this stuff would
expose them for the corrupt whores the current politicians are.  (no offense
to the honest "working girls" out there).  Plus, there's the collages of
great political cartoons and other info.  Donation to: Evans, 11-15 45th Ave,

are also highly recommended in the music review section.  Also, nicely-
formatted shitty job experiences that didn't make it onto the resume,
trival pursuit with Morrissey, and effective excuses for getting out of
work.  Much more, with lots of fun *attitude*, with no hesitation whatsoever
at calling bullshit when needed.  $1 wouldn't hurt- Ultrasonic Scalpel,
PO Box 209, Clarendon Hills, IL  60514-02090   ultrasnc@interaccess.com

Vision Temple - lots of new products from the mail-order ministry.
Especially recommended is the "1st Hit" starter kit for only $1- with lots
of pamphlets and tracts on a variety of subjects.  Mine included the
"Against Originality" anti-originalist manifesto, a brief explanation of the
Orange Grain System, a Recipe for Designer Religion (good, practical stuff
that Stang left out..), plus how-to UFO hoaxes and more.  Great deal for a
buck.  Also recommended is the Chewing Foil tape for $6, and the (very!)
experimental Vision Temple tapes for $4. At least get the intro pack.

The Watcher - #12 - Journal of Satanic Magic - including rituals, contacts,
reviews and criticisms, information, and general articles from this outgrowth
of the original Church of Satan.  Lots of opinions and commentary from the
satanic perspective; the most intriguing is the notion that the reason that
most *christian* churches continue to thrive is because they use *satanic*
practices, including intimidation, greed, and mysticism.  Also, there are
plenty of reminders from the media of how debauched the "church" in America
has become.  This is a very active chapter, with ongoing meetings and
activities, and is a resource for magical items.  Single issue $5, annual

So What? #9 - The lastest from Rev. Groovy G and THEMUS includes an article
that I agree 100% with- since rumors and scare tactics have all but destroyed
the once-fantastic holiday Halloween, we ought to do the same thing to let the
air out of this society's other "favorite" holiday, Christmas.  Like the
purely mythical "razorblades in candy" rumors, a few carefully placed child-
molester/Santa stories could do wonders.  Plus, an expose on the sleaze of
the country's biggest video store, Blockbuster, and Fellow Freaks, TV Rant
and Raves, Bil Keane Must Die!, Crazy Christian Conspiracy Comics, and much
more.  #1 (back issues available) to PO Box 378, Richmond, VA  23203

               How To Stop Your Phone From Ringing
               ***********************************

Leola Starling of Ribrock, Tenn., had a serious telephone problem.  But
unlike most people she did something lateral about it. The brand-new $10
million Ribrock Plaza Motel opened nearby and had acquired almost the
same telephone number as Leola. From the moment the motel  opened, Leola
was besieged by calls not for her.  Since she had the same phone number
for years, she felt that she had a case to persuade the motel management
to change its number. Naturally, the management refused claiming that it
could not change its stationery. The phone company was not helpful,
either.  A number was a number, and just because a customer was getting
someone else's calls 24 hours a day didn't make it responsible.  After
her pleas fell on deaf ears, Leola decided to take matters into her own
hands. (now stop for a moment and think what you would do ? Now try
reversal !)
    At 9 o'clock the phone rang.  Someone from Memphis was calling the
motel and asked for a room for the following Tuesday. Leoloa said, "No
problem. How many nights?" A few hours later Dallas checked in.
secretary wanted a suite with two bedrooms for a week.  Emboldened, Leola
said the Presidential Suite on the 10th floor was available for $600 a
night.  The secretary said that she would take it and asked if the hotel
wanted a deposit.  "No, that won't be necessary," Leola said.  "We trust
you." The next day was a busy one for Leola.  In the morning, she booked
an electric appliance manufacturers' convention for Memorial Day weekend,
a college prom and a reunion of the 82nd Airborne veterans from World War
II. She turned on her answering machine during lunchtime so that she
could watch the O.J. Simpson trial, but her biggest challenge came in the
afternoon when a mother called  to book the ballroom for her daughter's
wedding in June.  Leola assured the woman that it would be no problem and
asked if she would be providing the flowers or did she want the hotel to
take care of it.  The mother said that she would prefer the hotel to
handle the floral arrangements.  Then the question of valet parking came
up.  Once again Leola was helpful. "There's no charge for valet parking,
but we always recommend that the client tips the drivers."

    Within a few months, the Ribrock Plaza Motel was a disaster area.
People kept showing up for weddings, bar mitzvahs, and Sweet Sixteen
parties and were all told there were no such events.  Leola  had her
final revenge when she read in the local paper that the motel might go
bankrupt.  Her phone rang, and an executive from Marriott said, "we're
prepared to offer you $200,000 for the motel." Leola replied. "We'll take
it, but only if you change the telephone number."
