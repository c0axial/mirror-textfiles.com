Sorry, but no rants this time- this is the "catch-up" issue, and I just had to
get out the info on so many deserving people and things...plus the world has
just slowed down enough to allow other activities.  So, with the high points:

THE CROW:  See it.  Do this now, before proceeding.

THE FLINTSTONES:  Wait for it on video, if at all.  As bad as the cartoon.

JUNE 9TH: The world ends, according to "Messianic Vision" on TBN.  Since no-
   body will need any money or material goods on this date, please send all
   worldly possessions to the sacred PO Box for spiritual purification.

NIXON:

  The paper a few days ago reported that last Wednesday, when all U.S. Govt
offices were closed in observance of Nixon's death, the Washington, D.C.
office of the ACLU announced that it would close for exactly 18-1/2 minutes
(the length of blank space during the longest of many sections Nixon erased
before turning his tapes over to the public).   After being deluged with
complaints from Nixon stoogies, someone from the office explained that it
was a joke.

   I just hope that someone remembered to put the stake through his heart
so that he won't be coming back again.

Q: Why did RMN (aka Nixon) see "Deep Throat" 1000 times?
A: He was trying to get it down Pat.

Yes...it's true ladies and gents...Nixon has put out an album...more

Nixon...Unplugged!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 boy had asked a record store owner what "suicide" meant, to which
 the merchant answered, "Well, it's like... ventilating your head."

 There once lived a young man named Kurt
 that did something that surely must hurt:
 Though detoxed off junk,
 He remained in a funk --
 And all over his brains sure did spurt!

"Kurt Cobain blew off his face in a last ditch effort
 to get his creative juices flowing."

What's the difference between Kurt Cobain and Novocaine?
Tasteless answer:  One kills pain temporarily......
( the rhyming scheme is really important here..)

Q. Why did KC kill himself?
A. Someone made him listen to his own music!

 Rumor has is that Kurt's body is going to be cremated, and a manufacturer
 of potting soil has purchased the rights to his remains, which will be
 blended in with their peat moss.  In this way, gardenders all over America
 can have Kurt "in bloom" throughout the summer.

 Oh yes, I forgot to mention that this new potting soil is especially
 recommended for the luxuriant growth of poppies.

                     Kurt Cobain's Favorite Comics:

*** Amazing Strip #3 - This manga-style cartoon merges sex, rock-and-roll,
and ghosts.  A girl gets the inspiration for songs when she orgasms, and
the band tries to find the connection between that and her first time-with
a ghost trapped by musical "beings".  Not overly explicit.  Venus Comics.

*** Bartman #2 - Possibly the first of the Bongo comics series that actually
has an original, entertaining story to it.  Bart battles The Penalizer, a
vigilante who actually punishes criminals.  Lots of little jokes, and most
of them actually work.  Bongo Comics.

*** Beavis & Butthead #4 - The boys get tattoos, so that they can get free
tickets to the Amazon women wrestling event.  Once there, they decide to get
into the act, so they dress up in drag and take on the muscle women.  Also,
pages of juvenile pranks and sexual innuendo,   While escaping the irate
muscle women, the boys are mistaken for male strippers, but are rescued by
the Biker Chick.  Fairly outrageous for something from Marvel Comics.

*** Beavis & Butthead #5 - The boys screw up track & field events, yet end
up winning the race.  Later, in an attempt to pick up chicks, they become
towel boys at a local gymn.  Plus, crude tricks to do in movie theatres.
Marvel Comics.

*** The Black Pearl #1 - A shy, mousey girl picks up a strange amulet from a
pawn shop, and later, while masturbating, it transforms her into a voluptous,
sex-crazed nymphomaniac.  Very explicit, and some of the best I've seen in
quite a while from Eros Comix.

**** Brinke of Eternity #1 - A galactic counsel decides that Earth is to be
destroyed because we've polluted it so badly (although, wouldn't destroying
the humans make a mess too?).  A super-warrior woman is sent to Earth to
activate a doomsday machine, but her half-earthling sister arrives and fights
to protect humanity.  The writer and model is scream-queen Brinke Stevens, and
she really does have a skimpy green outfit exactly like the one in the comic
book.  If you see her at a con, she'll probably be wearing it.  Chaos! Comics.

**** Carnal Comics #1 - A comic with true stories of adult film stars, this
one is about the British star Sarah-Jane Hamilton.  In part 1 of 3, she tells
her life story about how she changed from a shy English schoolgirl to a 
stripper and model in London.  Plus, one of her medieval fantasies.  Also
includes a real pictorial with Sarah.  Revolutionary comics.

**** Cherry's Jubilee #4 - More adventures of everyone's favorite teenage
slut, by Larry Welz and others.  This one includes a different version of the
little mermaid story, the French Resistance, and Cherry does Mayberry.  More
explicit cartoons per page than any other.  Kitchen Sink Press.

**** Crap #4 - Mike picks up a new girlfriend who's into B&D, and she drags
him, unwilingly, further and further into it.  Like the episode on drag queens,
this is probably one of the most accurate and most sensitive portrayals of
this scene.  Plus, a "Smiley" strip that I haven't figured out yet.
Fantagraphics Books

**** Dirty Plotte #8 - Comics by Julie Doucet and others, including Julian
Lawrence, Jeff Johnson (Nurture the Devil), and more.  Stories include bad
roommates (and how one really bad one became Casper the ghost), gross ugly kids
with diarhhea, art school drop-outs, and other comics with strange sexual or
social themes. Julie's art style is instantly recognizable. Drawn and Quarterly

*** Duplex Planet #7 - More questions and stories from the nursing home,
illustrated by Wayno, Pat Moriarty, Jim Woodring, J.R. Williams, Dame Darcy,
and many more.  Was John Wayne really brave?  What makes a good motel?  
The art is great, but of ideas seem kind of uninspired.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Fat Freddy's Cat #1 - Rip Off Press has been reprinting lots of the Furry
Freak Brothers and Freddy's Cat lately.  This one has "I Led Nine Lives" tale
of the secret spy-cat, plus lots of the familiar one-page strips, with the
cat with an attitude living with the stoners.  Rip Off Press.

*** Flaming Carrot/TMNT #4 - in the final part of this crossover, the learn
the secret of the ancient city, and that Earth is being invaded by creatures
from the sun, using the city as a focus.  The city must be re-sunk in order
to stop the invaders.  Mirage Publishing.

**** Hate #15 - This time the characters seem *too* real.  Buddy has to deal
with multiple neurotic roommates piling in the apartment, including his 
freaky ex-girlfriend.  Things get so bad that he leaves to visit his parents
in NYC.  Plus, an introspective look at his own comics.  Fantagraphics.

*** Jim vol. II #2 - More strange visions from Jim Woodring, with Frank and
other strange characters.  This one has a Frank strip, a dream of a party at
Jim's house, and Pulque, the embodiment of drunkenness.  Strange but compelling
stuff- I can't help wonder what the "worst visions" might be that he alludes
to.  Fantagraphics Books.

**** Meatcake #2 - More of those silly, but neat stories by Dame Darcy.
Its hard to describe, but the strangeness of the stories perfectly matches
the strangeness of her artwork style.  Fantagraphics Books.

**** Milk and Cheese - this is the first 2nd issue, which is actually the 5th
issue.  After an absence, everyone's favorite dairy-products-gone-bad are 
back, with full bloody mayhem.  They crash comic book conventions, Halloween,
bad morning breath, TV violence, buffet frenzy, and the death of Herve
Villechaize.  A must for all drunken rioters.  Slave Labor Graphics.

*** Musings #3 - This is primarily an interview comic, which talks to a lot
of different artists.  I picked it up because the front and back cover are
Dawn, by Michael Linsner.  It turns out that he and Joe Monks had a falling
out, and won't be producing anything else under the name Cry for Dawn.  The
character will live on, however, and the last time I talked to Linsner at a
con, he has plans to do a real story with the Dawn character, in the D&D-ish
universe hinted at in the drawings.  Joe Monks has been making the rounds at
conventions recently, so here's Linsner's side of the story.

*** Negative Burn #10 - This issue has another installment of the Twilight
People, Mr. Mamoulian, Classics Desecrated, and more.  My favorites were
Wet Work by Phillip Hester, and Project High by Ken Meyer Jr.  This issue
has a nice variety of different works.  Caliber Press.

**** Nurture the Devil #1 - Dark, disturbing comics from Jeff Johnson.  Not
for the squeamish or unstable, these stories explore sadism, physical and
mental torture in a dysfunctional family, cannibalistic premature monster
babies, violence between the sexes, and nightmarish images.  Fantagraphics.

*** Peepshow #6 - I tend to go back and forth between feeling sorry for Joe's
problems, and pissed off at him for bringing a fair amount of it on himself.
In the latest semi-autobiographical issue, he completely blows it with the
oriental girl he's been waiting for so long. After a string of dismal failures,
he goes back home, and blows it again with 2 girls in bed.  He finally settles
back into the old solitary, but contented, routine.  At least he does have good
taste in music.  Got any good news for us, Joe?    Drawn and Quarterly.

*** The People's Comics - A reprint of Robert Crumb's 1972 classic, with
the jaded exploits of Fritz the Cat, and Crumb's own twisted view of society,
revolution, and himself.  25th anniversary special from Kitchen Sink Comix.

*** Powdered Toast Man - In a natural spin-off from the Ren & Stimpy series,
PTM battles a series of offbeat villains.  There's a few good gags in here,
but nothing as shockingly outrageous as burning the Constitution from the 
original TV show.  Marvel Comics.

*** Real Girl #6 - The genderfuck issue takes on cross-dressing, butch dykes,
female impersonators, gender roles, and more with a series of cartoons by
different authors.  Look for the cover by Tom Tomorrow.  Fantagraphics.

*** Real Stuff #17 - I've always thought that I've had some interesting
adventures, but I don't think anyone can compare to Dennis Eichhorn.  In the
continuing chronicle of Dennis' exhilirating and sometimes scary true stories,
he encounters a glue-sniffing convict, encounters strange dreams when choked
unconscious by bullies, the press box at an NFL game, a coke-crazed comedian
girlfriend, Wild Man Fisher as a house guest, and working security for
a John Lee Hooker concert. Drawn by different artists.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Real Stuff #18 - Dennis is attacked by a coach who married Dennis' former
abused girlfriend, on the road with Wild Man Fisher, and guilt-ridden paranoid
neighbors, and secret US airforce training of chinese nationalist pilots, are
all more episodes from Dennis Eichhorn's turbulent adventures.  Drawn by
J.R. Williams, Seth Tobocman, Leslie Sternbergh and others.  Fantagraphics.

** Ren & Stimpy #19 - The Minimalist issue - Although the takeoffs on 
"Waiting for Godot" are clever, this issue could use a bit more story 
material.  The point is to see how *little* R&S can be shown; invisility 
guns, blown fuses, and TOO MANY ADS keep them hidden.  There's a couple of
wry, gross jokes, but not much else.  Marvel Comics.

*** Ren & Stimpy #20 - Ren takes over the Muddy Mudskipper show, and drives
it straight into the ground.  Lots of Letterman references.  Plus, they
babysit a huge, obnoxious baby.  They could have done a lot more with these
stories, plus, ads take up about half the comic book.  Marvel Comics.

*** Ren & Stimpy Special #2 - The boys take on various summer jobs, including
football team mascots, stunt actors, and janitors.  As usual, they can't do
anything right, or end up getting screwed.  Marvel Comics.

** Simpsons Comics #3 - The school mascot, the stuffed puma, is stolen, and
Bart must find out who took it.  Lisa goes on a Poirot-style investigation.
A few good jokes, but tame for the Simpsons.  Bongo Comics.

*** Sin Comics #2 - This is a collection of small, interrelated comics with
themes running through them, plus lots of meta-comic jokes (and even a visit
to the artist's studio).  Tame, but an interesting mix.  Black Eye Productions.

*** Stiff #1 - A rich woman hires a guy to kill her disabled husband, in return
for money and hot sex.  She ends up getting it too, after the killer checks the
brakes and sees that he was to die also.  Explicit, gory.  Boneyard Press.

*** The Tick - Karma Tornado #3 - The Tick is beamed back to Earth after
finishing the games, but he ends up floating in space in the wrong place.
He is rescued by a Kennedy-era space chimp, who gained intelligence in space
after his failed mission was covered up by NASA.  The ape is now the servant
to the space being Nigh-Omnipotus, and the ape tricks the Tick into taking
over his job.  New England Comics Press.

**** Tomato #1 - comics by Ellen Forney - collection of outrageous comics
from women's perspective.  A lewd photo-shoot, growing up with "hip" parents
in the 70s, and trying to meet Camille Paglia are some of the rather
interesting topics.  The story from the cover is a surpriser.  Starhead Comix.

***** Waldo World #2 - The continuing story of classic cartoon animators, 
by Kim & Simon Deitch.  Lillian, now an old woman, recounts how she met 
Winston Newton, the animation pioneer, and how he died on her.  Ted's son
recounts a company picnic, and how the idea of a cartoon amusement park was
stolen from the Fontaine Fables founder.  This is a great story of the 
troubles and personalities behind an early cartoon company.  Fantagraphics.

*** Wild Life #1 - by Peter Kuper, this is another of the autobiographical
comics.  Peter takes us on a look back to his adolescence, and the terrible
time he had getting laid, and the times that he blew it.  Plus, an illustrated
Kafka story, and more.  If you like Joe Matt, you'll love this.  Fantagraphics.

*** Whot Not! #3 - Snide, sarcastic, juvenile cartoons with a violent attitude,
with disturbing strangness.  Which means that its definitely recommended.
Absolutely no cultural icon is sacred- the section on what will happend to
cartoon kids when they grow up is great.  Fantagraphics Books.

 THE BLEEDING TRUTH ABOUT MIKE DIANA


blatantly ripped off from: [Media Clips by Hugh Forrest]   (thanks,hugh)

NOW THAT'S OBSCENE:  Is Austin a better place to live now that two
people who aired a sexually explicit video on ACTV have been convicted
of obscenity charges?  Perhaps it is.  Perhaps it's completely
inappropriate that youngsters be exposed to such material in their
living rooms--yet, one wonders if tender, impressionable youngsters are
the ones watching television at 2am.

Then again, few if any of the people who were so offended by the
_Infosex_ footage were viewing the program or were even awake when the
problematic segments were aired.  But an important principle was being
established here and the eventual outcome of this court case was well
worth the efforts of the numerous lawyers that were involved in the
protracted legal process.  Thank goodnes the only kind of safe sex we'll
now see on our televisions is the kind approved by the network moguls
and their million-dollar cronies in the advertising industry.

While the outcome of the Austin trial is unfortunate, it pales in
comparison to the proceedings of a recent obscenity case in Florida.  On
March 25, a Pinellas County jury convicted 24-year-old cartoonist
Michael Diana of three counts of publishing and advertising obscenity.
His crime?  Producing and contributing ortwork to about 300 copies of
the very, very offbeat fanzine entitle _Boiled Angel_, a single copy of
which was sold in the county in which these charges were filed.  During
his trial, a local psychologist who testified for the prosecution said
that normal people would find the publication "worthless or disgusting"
while other such experts surmised that the articles in _Bolied Angel_
might incite criminal activity.  About $50,000 in taxpayer-funded court
costs later, the young artist was found guilty, scoring a big victory
for decency and presumably making St. Petersburg a much safer place to
live.

Diana's troubles started in 1992 when one of the suspects from the
notorious coed murders in Gainesville was found to have a copy of
_Boiled Angel_ in his apartment.  As a result, Diana, as well, quickly
became a suspect in these killings.  Police took a blood sample from
him; when it did not match evidence from the scene of the crime, he was
off the hook.  Still the so-called authorities were distrubed at the
images they had seen in this photocopied publication.  They told him he
should quit producing this filth, advice he politely ignored.  Later, he
produced _Boiled Angel #7_ and _Boiled Angel #Ate_.  Diana sent one of
these copies to a man from St. Petersburg who had corresponded to [sic]
him repeatedly.  This man was, in fact, a police officer and shortly
thereafter the cartoonist was arrested on obscenity charges.

_Boiled Angel may not be the kind of material you'd want your
pre-schooler reading, but as `zines go, there is much harsher stuff.  As
publisher, Diana seems particularly fascinated--perhaps disturbed is a
better word--by family violence.  One eight-page strip in the
publication entitled "Baby Fucked Dog Food" describes the cycle of child
abuse and concludes when the family dog exacts his sodomic revenge on
the evil father.  Another page featured the tongue-in-cheek list "How to
Be a Successful Serial Killer."  Insofar as the drawings that Diana
himself produces for his publication, priests with gigantic penises that
seek out young boys seem to be a favorite subject.

"His artwork is brutal," says Shane Bugbee, of Michael Hunt Publishing
in Chicago.  "But then again he's dealing with brutal subjects such as
child molestation."  Asked where he gets his ideas for these sketches,
the soft-spoken Diana responds that they come from watching the news and
reading newspapers.  "I guess I tend to fcus on the ugly side of
existence," he notes.

Pinellas County porosecutors, however, were convinced that these
drawings add more than focus to the ugly side of life.  Speaking to the
jury, County Attorney Stuart Baggish painted a scenario in which people
reading this publication would eventually turn to photos for further
stimulation, then to films, then to recreating these situations in real
ife.  The defense responded with testimoy from fanzine experts such as
_Factsheet Five_ publisher Seth Friedman.  Friedman and New York
illustrator Peter Kuper claimed that _Boiled Angel_ was an artform
specifically directed to other artists and `zine collectors.  This
argument bore little relevance to the jury, who only needed 90 minutes
to arrive at the guilty verdict.

As strange as the Diana case is, the strangest aspect of this latter-day
witch hunt are the various punishments issued by County Judge Walter
Fullerton.  Having been found guilty of the three obscenity charges,
Diana has been placed on probation for three years, must pay $3,000 in
fines and costs, contribute over 1,200 hours of community service, as
well as receive psychiatric counselfing.  Additionally, Judge Fullerton
ordered that he must enroll in a "journalism ethics" course in hopes
that he coan one day become a "responsible publisher."  Inferring from
his drawings that Diana is a potential child molester, Fullerton
mandated that he must stay away from those under 18 years of age; when
minors enter the convenience store at which he is now employed, he is
legally forbidden from emerging from behind the counter.

But, wait, it gets weirder still.  He is prohibited by court order from
publishing material that "_could_ be considered obscene."  Fullerton
also ordered that Diana could not create such material "even for your
own use."  In this scenario, the cartoonist's probation officer has been
authorized to make warrantless searches of his property to find doodles
that may violate this order.  As noted by "News of the Weird" founder
Chuck Shepherd, who wrote about this case for Tampa's _Creative Loafing_
and has a story on Diana that will appear in next month's _Playboy_,
"This is surely the only time that someone has been forbidden to make an
illegal speech, let alone arguably protected speech, to himself.  It is
the equivalent of forbidding someone to say 'fuck,' even if no one can
hear him."

Asked if he sees parallels between Diana's troubles in Florida and the
ACTV case in Austin, Shepherd, a former criminal lawyer, points out that
both "fit into the pattern of First Amendment wars in this country being
waged as culture wars.  Most of the really vigorous First Amendment
contests are now fought along cultural battle lines.  As opposed to
producers and retailers, they more and more pit people who believe in
expressing themselves in alternative ways versus prosecutors who don't
believe in the validity of such expressions.  In many of these cases,
the prosecutors come from a completely different cultural context than
those they have charged.  These prosecutors look for incidental sexual
references.  They view these references free of the irony in which they
may have been intended and assume they were produced for the purpose of
titillation."

Shepherd adds that Judge Fullerton and the prosecution team are confused
in their interpretation of prurient interest as it relates to the legal
definition of obscenity.  Since Diana did not intend or target the
"deviant community" with _Boiled Angel_, he feels that this case will be
overturned by a higher court, a court with a more sophisticated
understanding of the complexity of such laws.  Meanwhile, those wishing
to help underwrite these appeals may be interested in purchasing a
180-page edition titled "Fuck Florida."  This work, proceeds from which
will benefit Diana via the San Francisco-based Comic Book Legal Defense
Fund, features cover art by R. Crumb as well as renderings of Diana's
art by numerous other underground and semi-underground cartoonists.  For

artwork, and short articles.  Teriffic look too, with help from Rev. Dave
Mitchell.  Send something, anything to: The Compound, c/o J. Reichert
PO Box 387, Orlando, FL  32802

Eat or Die #3 - Tons of strange graphics and collages, mixed with strange
text, articles, and rants.  Unlike many such zines, the quantity, quality,
and strangness of it all hits a critical mass that makes it an adventure
into surreality.  Plus, the cartoon series that threads throughout the issues
is great.  Many pages of fun stuff.  Send $2 to P. Santo, 230 Avenue B,
Apartment 4, Bayonne, NJ  07002

Sex & Rock 'N' Roll Tattoos - Not a zine, this is a full-color glossy magazine
where rock stars show off their tattoos.  And there's tons of them too, in
lots of pictures.  In this issue, musicians from Concrete Blonde, GWAR, X,
Warrant, Souls at Zero, and tons of other bands show off their favorite
tattoos and tell the stories behind them.  The pages are packed with full-
color closeups, as well as group shots, and there's some real artwork here.
As the intro says, tattoos and music have a lot in common- they're both means
of expression, and these tattoos match the intensity of the music.  If you're
into hard-core and/or tattooing, you'll want this, and its awfully tempting
for those thinking about getting a new or first tattoo.  100 full-color pages,
and it includes 2 full-color posters.  Look for this at your favorite bookshop,
or $17.95 for 4 issues (25.95 Canadian, if they'll let it across the border)
to: Jiffy Fulfillment Inc, 462 Broadway, Suite 4000, NY NY 10013-2697 or
call: 1-800-835-2246 ext. 192.

Your Freedom #1 - Another angry libertarian/anarchist zine from someone who
has figured out that our government is a joke, that we are slowly being
enslaved, and that all the programs are actually designed to enhance some
petty bureaucrat's wallet and power.  In a subject area that's popping up
faster than mushrooms after a spring rain, this zine is short, sweet, and
to-the-point, with articles on helmet laws, the political contimuum, and a
review of the Loompanics catalog.  Plus, he's looking for cartoons and
submissions.  Sample copy $2 or 12-issues for $18, PO Box 54562,
Oklahoma City, OK  73154-1562.

Ogyr Network series III #2 - This is the perfect thing to satisfy your hunger
between ever-so-rare issues of the Stark Fist.  Art by Pope Sternodox, stories
and rants by LIES, Janor Hypercleets, and assorted misfits, plus one of the
best coverages of alternative music anywhere.  I totally agree with the review
of the latest Cocteau Twins album.  Plus zines (thanks for the plug) and lots
more.  Only $3 from $aint @ndrew, PO Box 53, Plainfield IL 60544 or
stumattheand@vax.colsf.edu

Plutonium Nyborg Express, vol 2 issue 3- April 94 - I picked this up from the
flyer table at Creature Feature.  The bad part: pages and pages of wasted
space, with "top 10 lists" and in-group banter that nobody else understands or
cares about.  The good part: several quite good pencil drawings by Adam
Narcross, a quick guide to how all the victims died in the Friday the 13th
movies, and a neat alternative 'do not disturb' door hanger.  No price listed,
PO Box 5532, Raleigh, NC  27650-5532

Interesting! - This is quite literally, anything and everything that the
publisher, Richard Sagall, wants to put in this "compilation of things I find
interesting."  In this issue, he talks about respectable occupations, 
deformed chickens, interesting groups to write for catalogs, similarities
between Jesus and Elvis, medical accuracy in TV shows, funny medical terms,
and tons of other neat facts and statistics.  I think he may be far too
trusting of the government in his assessment of Waco, but its his opinion, and
he solicits opinions for the soapbox section.  20 or so pages that are a
quick condensation of tons of reading.  Lives up to its name.  $3 per issue to
PO Box 1069,  Bangor, ME 04402-1069, or Rich24@aol.com

"i" by Dave Fisher, The Center for Computational Aesthetics.  This piece
explores the nature of causality, reality, and how our abstracts and constructs
that we create in order to generate the illusion that we're dealing with it,
might actually be barriers- and how to possibly overcome it. Mini-koan-like
snippets of thoughts are illustrated by computer graphics with their own
hidden, and contributing, meanings.  Fractal lovers would love it for the
psychedelic graphics alone, which have been reproduced in high resolution.
Take it slow, and absorb it. $6 (very nicely, almost professionally done) from:
Marks on Paper, 306 Thayer St. #82, Providence, RI 02906

Pandora's Box vol.2 #3 - Fairly thick zine of art, poetry, and miscellaneous
articles and reviews of a diverse group desperately searching for meaning and
fun among the dull grey-hairs of Tampa-bay area.  Pretty original, and much
more honest than lots of arty-style zines, with unabased rejection of petty
societal norms.  Thanks for Rev. Gypsy Joker KSC for sending this- no price is
listed, but send something to help them out:  Pandora's Box  6430 Polk St.
New Port Richey, FL  34653

Brinke Stevens Newsletter - #7 Winter 1993 issue - Brinke is one of the "scream
queens" who made lots of "B" movies in the early-mid 80s, that Up All Night
shows in heavily edited form.  You may have seen her in "Haunting Fear",
"Nightmare Sisters", and "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama", plus
she has her own comic book, "Brinke of Eternity", plus she visits tons of
sci-fi, horror, and fantasy cons each year.  In her newsletter, she lists
videos, artwork, and other collectibles relating to herself and other scream
queens, plus she sells lots of hard-to-find videos including her Private
Collection series, Shock Cinema, and "Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity",
which was personally critized by Jesse Helms.  Newsletter is $5 for 4 issues,
but if you see her at a con, she'll probably give you one.  Brinke Stevens
Fan Club, 8033 Sunset Blvd #556, Hollywood, CA  90046

Bellows of Self - vol. II #4 - Special Christmas Zeppelin issue, dedicated to
Peter Strasser, german zeppelin commander.  Strange stories, articles, anti-
PC editorials, and TONS OF ZEPPELINS!!!!  Ranges from the outrageous to the
sublime, with some great pictures and clipart that I haven't seen before.
No price, send something to: Bellows of Self, PO Box 17285, Salt Lake City,
Utah, 84124

Mouth-Snake - this is a small mini-comic by Jeff Johnson (Nurture the Devil)
and Paul Weinman.  Dark, disgusting, and perverse drawings and text illustrate
a loss of innocence.  Paul Weinman, 79 Cottage Ave, Albany NY 12203

Strange, But True News - This zine is precisely as the title implies, real
news stories that actually happened, and as usual, truth is much stranger than
fiction.  The Feb. 94 issue reports on a man who seduced teenagers by telling
them he was an alien and promised them rides in his spacecraft, a pink lawn
flamingo that took a cross-trip and wrote letters home, arrests for getting
high on toads, politically-correct gingerbread "persons", and Japanese suicide
manuals.  This is a great barometer to gauge the amount of weirdness and
insanity in the world, and there's no shortage.  1 year (12 issues) is only $12
and $2 for a sample copy- mention you read this in HToMC and get it for $1.
SEND HIM YOUR WEIRD NEWS CLIPPING!!!!

The Luminary - MOC special issue - This is a semi-magazine primarily for
role-playing gamers, but also contains short stories, artwork, comics, and
articles dealing with gaming and the various mythos's and characters in some
of the games.  No price listed, The Luminary c/o Frontiers, PO Box 2830
Athens, GA  30612-0830

Factsheet Five #51 - the latest is out, and its larger than ever.  The current
gang managing this project is doing a great job with it, and its full of 
comics, zines, music, zines about every subject, movies, catalogs, and more
from the self-produced underground/independent scene.  Get a subscription now
if you don't have one already.  Regular bulk-rate 6-issue subscription is $20,
$35 if in Canada (and if they haven't censored it yet)  Send it to:
Facthsheet Five Subscriptions, PO Box 170099, San Francisco, CA  94117-0099

The Mongoloid Moose #4 - Fun stuff.  101 everyday objects that can be used as
improvised weapons, Star Wars movie marathons with MST3K dialog, how to annoy
the local supermarket, adventures in food shopping, and other odd things that
Scott finds interesting.  This is a zine written not to impress, educate,
annoy, etc., but simply because he enjoys writing it, and it shows.  $1 to
Scott Wilson, PO Box 642, Bloomfield, NJ  07003

Smite #3 - Badfilm reviews, zines, the Different Strokes cult, and more are
in this latest issue of Smite.  Plus, more gory war-stories from the minimum
wage/service sector employment scene, and all of the scummy bosses, degrading
jobs, and low wages.  Having 3 separate jobs since Christmas actually isn't
necessarily a bad thing; anyone with any self-respect at all shouldn't have
to put up with some fast-food jerks.  Watch for more great film reviews too,
he's officially getting into that scene.  $10 for 12 issues or $1 each from:
R.L. Porter, c/o SMITE, PO Box 624,  Diboll, TX  75941

Derogatory Reference #77 - In this journal-format zine, Arthur Hlavaty takes
us to Philcon, where he participated in SF panels, dealing with Internet
e-mail, over-hyped criticism of academians discussing gay themes, zine
coverage in newspapers, working in cyberspace, criminalizing drugs, and other
topics.  Lots of heady stuff in a high-brow, non-weird format, but still it
comes off more interesting and meaningful than lots of publications 10 times
the size.  His exploits and interests make good reading.  $1, published 4 or
so times a year from Arthur Hlavaty, 206 Valentine St. Yonkers NY 10704-1814
or get it email from him at hlavaty@panix.com

Trash #17 - This issue talks about Kurt Cobain's suicide and how people tend
to cynically dismiss it.  Plus, Wrestling and trash sports, tons of album
reviews, upcoming movies on all the cable movie channels with reviews, plus
great local comics, T-Square, and Mickey Death.  While wandering around
Carrboro before the King Missle show, I stopped in the Videodrome, where this
zine is produced, and its one of the best psychotronic film stores I've seen
anywhere, bar none.  405 E. Main St.  Carrboro, NC  27510

25 Creationists' Arguments & 25 Evolutionists' Answers - This is a booklet
produced by the Skeptics Society, and is meant to help teachers and schools
fight off the pseudo-scientific/religious/political agenda that is constantly
trying to be forced down their throats.  It covers nearly all of the "main"
points covered in typical creationist literature, and can definitely help in
skirmishes with the street evangelists.  Skeptics Sopciety, 2761 N. Marengo
Ave., Altadena, CA  91001

MUSIC

   Indian Rope Burn - "Sex Party"

I got this CD immediately after MOC, and its been in heavy rotation ever since.
This is an unclassifiable compilation which is similar, but not quite like a
cross between techno, Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy, New Order, with snips 
and samples from various bad horror movies and more.  This was the "house"
band for a recent Devival in Akron OH, so that gives you a fair idea of where
the lyrics go- that range from being simultaneously cynical and funny, to
questioning and anti-authoritarian.  And, the music to go along with it is
great.  Mainly an industrial "feel" to it, but there's bits and pieces of lots
of different styles.  Highly recommended.  GGE records, PO Box 1784
Kent, OH  44240-0033, or e-mail Mike Crooker at mikecrooker@delphi.com
