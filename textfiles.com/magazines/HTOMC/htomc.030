                            Waiting for God
                     By Rev. Gypsy Joker KSC, I.M.
                             Earl of Fives

  Recently the Church Elders saddled me with the unwelcome task of being
  God's (Not to be confused with JHVH-1) job counselor, as the ex-supreme
  being hasn't been doing much since Mal-2 fired him for gross incompetence.

  Rev. Weird Frank was God's last counselor.  "Rev. Weird Frank told me
  he's REALLY pushy and always late.  he turned the guy before me into a Pig,
  he may not be the supreme being anymore, but he still knows some scare
  tricks"  Exclaimed Brother Frank as I put our expensive luncheon on the
  Church account.

  So Monday morning found me waiting on the beach, with my friend Jenny (who
  I'm currently leading down the path to high weirdness) which seemed to be
  as good a place as any to expect him to show up.  Jenny and I were talking
  about It All and eventually about world peace.

  "My Grandmother doesn't like any of that 'Peace Stuff'" said Jenny. "Great"
  I replied "I agree totally!  Let's get some of my friends together and I'll
  mace her while they chain whip her, then we'll beat her till she bleeds out
  of both ears!"

  She didn't seem very keen on the idea, and that seemed to kill our little
  talk.  Moments later, I saw him.  An old man in robes, his beard brushed
  back and forth by the wind, was hobbling up the beach toward me with a wise
  look in his eyes.

  "Ah-ha!  Not this time, pal, I'm not turning into a pig for nobody!" I
  thought as I watched him approach.  Suddenly I leaped at him with a fierce
  Viking roar that would loosen the bowels of a Sumo wrestler and maced him
  right between the eyes.

  "AIIIIEEEGH!  HOLY SHIT!  PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!  I only wanted two dollars
  for some cheap smack!" he wailed at me, weeping loudly.

  "Shit.  Sorry about that, I thought you were God" I said, handing him a
  crisp fiver.  He limped off vaguely muttering about "Evil Twisted Freaks"
  on this beach.

  Then the wind picked up and howled down out of the sky like a rabid dog,
  and fire rained down out of the sky.  A voice boomed out of the eye of the
  storm, "WHAT DOEST THOU WANT, YOU ARE AN OFFENSE AGAINST THINE SIGHT."

  Of course the elders told me to expect just this sort of thing, so I yelled
  "FUCK YOU TOO!  I HAVE YOUR VERY LAST WELFARE CHECK HERE, SO IF YOU WANT IT
  YOU'D BETTER COME DOWN HERE AND PLAY BALL, YOU OLD DEGENERATE PERVERT!"

    NEXT ISSUE:  HASSLING GOD ABOUT BEING A NO-GOOD SHIT WHO CAN'T
                 HOLD DOWN A JOB.

           POCAHONTAS -- the secret agenda

I haven't seen any other warnings, but I can't believe none of you
have seen those advertising posters that have been spread all over
the place.  THINK, now!  There she is, the sexy heroine, with
nostrils obviously set directly in her face without a nose, and
eyes like a lemur set slant-wise in her head.  Yes, POCOHONTAS IS
A SPACE ALIEN!!  And by presenting her as a sympathetic figure the
Disney Corporation is clearly collaborating in the propaganda task
of creating a clique of potential collaborators with the non-
humans.  This is obviously the last step before the group now in
orbit calls the Mother Ships in from beyond Pluto and they *&^%$#@

                       O.J.'s Favorite Comics
                       ======================

**** A-Bomb #5 - After a couple of relatively lame issues, this one is hot.
Lots of explicit action and great pictures, plus the stories are very good.
Topics range from sexy barbarians, to dominance and submission, and even the
non-sexually-oriented story "Tropical Punch", which is usually out-of-place
and somewhat lame, was great in this issue.  Keep it up!  Venus comics

**** Acid Head Arnie - The LSD and extasy-laced adventures of a trio of lads
living in England.  Much like the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, these guys
sleep all day, rave all night, hunt for drugs, and avoid the idiotic
undercover drug police.  Knockabout Comics.

**** Alice Cooper- The Final Temptation Book III - In the conclusion to the
story, Steven goes back to the theatre on Halloween, where he must choose to
join the troop.  But, he knows the truth about the child abductions, and when
he can't leave, he destroys the theatre with dream-flames.  Everything comes
together nicely, and Alice Cooper is perfect in his role.  Marvel

*** Beavis & Butthead #11 - In this Thanksgiving issue, the boys reach new
heights of gutter language and rudeness when they have dinner at Stewart's
house.  Plus, they infiltrate a wacked-out fashion show in the eternal
quest for hot babes.  As usual, they get humiliated.  Marvel Comics

*** Beavis & Butthead #12 - The Christmas season isn't too dificult of a 
subject of parody, seeing how it is transparently a bloated absurdity to 
begin with.  Still, the boys manage to pull a good Santa scam, by promising
toys to kids only if they give them nachos.  Marvel Comics.

** Beavis & Butthead #13 - The boys go on a hiking trip with their hippy
teacher, but end up trapped in a cabin in a huge blizzard.  Also, they get
into trouble in art class, for drawing rude comics.  Not a very inspired or
outrageous issue.  Marvel Comics.

*** Carnal Comics - Serenity #1 - This one features the 1994 Topless Dancer
World Champion.  She tells her autobiographical story, about moving from
a ballerina to topless dancing to porno.  Plus, a real pictorial.  Her
fantasy segment is a fairly good D&D adventure.  Carnal Comics.  

*** Carnal Comics - Rebecca Bardoux #1 - She tells how she got involved in
the business, and like so many others, she got her start by dancing in the
strip clubs.  From there, it didn't take long to get fully involved in
movies.  Plus, her fantasy is a wild western-style orgy.  Carnal Comics.

*** Cherry #16 - Cherry goes to a Renaissance Fair, where she meets and falls
hard for a guy, naturally, including various sexual escapades and fantasies
in in medieval times.  Plus, pagan rituals with ALL the sex.  Pat Robertson
would not enjoy this issue.  Also, look for an upcoming video special, with
Becky Sunshine, 1993 Miss Nude California, playing the part of Cherry.
And, support the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund - PO box 693, Northampton
MA 01061.  Kitchen Sink Press

*** Cherry #17 - Mark Bode helps with the drawing, as Cherry meets the
Young Genetically-Altered Samurai Lizards.  Also, Cherry goes off into a
fantasy pirate adventure when she meets her lover from the medieval fair
in issue #16.  Possibly the most wild and uninhibited cartoon character
ever drawn, as explicitly as possible!   Kitchen Sink Comics.

*** Crap #6 - When the roommates celebrate a non-traditional christmas luau,
Loreen gets sick, and freaks out- then tells everyone about her earlier
problems with bulimia.  And, yes, Bacardi 151 rum *will* burn about as
well as gasoline.  Plus, JR tells about his earlier bad acid trip, and how
he had panic attacks (not flashbacks!) afterward.  Fantagraphics

*** Crap #7 - This issue focuses on Milton Plutonium, the mutant roommate,
and his attempts to blot out the futility of life with alcohol.  Not preachy
or moralistic, it makes some good points.  Plus, a couple of other fun
stories, one where "work is hell", literally.  Fantagraphics

**** Dirty Plotte #9 - In an autobiographical story, Julie Doucet is bored
out of her mind in art school in Montreal.  She manages to scrape by, but
ends up having to do most of the work in a hurry on the night before exams.
That, and having to deal with a pest who won't leave her alone, and tries
to kill himself.  The classic slacker story from the female perspective.
Drawn & Quarterly.

*** Duplex Planet #10 - More of the stupid but profound conversations of 
nursing home residents.  Its also a good vehicle for showcasing as lot of
different artists, who each do their own segment, or "question", regardless
of how the topic may meander.  Best ones in this issue are Doug Allen of
"Idiotland", and J.R. Williams.  Fantagraphics.

*** Duplex Planet #11 - Dave asks the questions "Who's the King of Love?",
"did you ever have a broken heart?", "What's it like to be a bachelor all
your life?" and more.  Featured artists include Wayno, Pat Moriarty, Ellen
Forney, Jim Siergey, and many more.  Fantagraphics.

*** Eightball #14 - Strange, but fun, even for this comic.  After an initial,
weird, stream of consciousness-style story, he looks at all the sexual
imagery in sports, an other episode of "Ghost World" where they look at
adult book stores and first-time sex, and "The Death of Dan Pussey" takes
a cynical look at the comics business.  Fantagraphics.

**** Eightball #15 - A real depressing, hard-hitting issue.  "Caricature" 
follows a fairground caricature artist, his relationship with a young
girl, and how it turns out that *his* life is the caricature.  Also, another
installment of "Ghost World" - the girls go to one of those fake 50's 
restaurants, and use it to play tricks on people in the personals ads.
This one made me think more than any other comic this time.  Fantagraphics.

**** Eleven or One - An Angry Christ comic - A struggling artist who needs
an agent wakes up one morning with an extra, 11th finger.  As he goes on a
personal quest to find his purpose and "savior", nobody seems to notice
the extra digit.  As in many of Linsner's works, a major theme is redemption
by accepting yourself.  Sirius Comics.

*** Flowers on the Razorwire #4 - Collection of grisly short stories.  Tales
include an apartment cleaner who finds a diary indicating latent pedophelia,
and he decides to help the guy along.  Also, tales of perversion, disease,
and death.  Not pretty, but intense.  Boneyard Press.

*** Hate #17 - Buddy goes on a trip back to Seattle with his friend Jay, to
see everyone and pick up his stuff.  Back in New Jersey, Lisa gets along
great with Buddy's mom, until she mentions that she's had several abortions.
When they get back, Buddy and Jay decide to go into business, and Lisa
desperately wants to move out of their parent's house.  Fantagraphics.

*** Hate #18 - In this issue, Buddy's family shows themselves for what complete
and total losers *they* are.  Everyone gets it from his sister and her
brats, to an alcoholic mom, but the most attention is focused on his brother,
who is getting kicked out of the navy. By comparison, Buddy and Lisa don't
seem too bad.  Just about everyone will experience some family deja-vu from
this issue.  Great story line, too.  Fantagraphics Books.

**** Idiotland #7 - Truly strange and twisted comics from Doug Allen and
Gary Leib.  Possibly the best mix of silliness and perversion, with a very
distinctive drawing style.  You'll find something new that you missed every
time you look at it.  It has another episode of "Margarita & Lavender",
"Beef Baron", "Fables I Forgot", and many more.   Fantagraphics Books.

**** Insidious Tales - Several stories, most by Jack Bliss.  Hardcore horror
tales, with all the gore.  Tales include a wirehead junkie who goes out for
revenge when his virtual technology is sold to the Corporation by a truested
assistant.  Plus, smaller stories on conjuring demons, and renegade (and 
hot!) female vampire rebels against powerful elders.  Cry For Dawn Prod.

***** Jim #4 - A special All-Frank issue.  Three separate Frank stories, one
in full color.  As psychedelic and bizarre as any, Manhog really gets it in
each of these stories, plus all of the weird landscapes, buildings, ad beats.
Fantagraphics Books

**** Jim #5 - More strange dreamscapes from Jim Woodring, with a couple of
the Frank strips.  In the first, Frank views all sorts of disgusting and
bizarre things through windows and telescopes.  In the other, Manhog breaks
up Frank's tea party, and Frank has his revenge.  Plus, the strangeness
with Jim himself.  Bizarre, disturbing stuff, which captures a lot of the
real essense of dreams.  Fantagraphics

*** Last Gasp comix & stories #2 - Collection of stories, with frequent
themes of violence, disease, mutilation, and despair, but in a *fun* kind of
way.  Each one is like a little car accident - gross, but you just *have* to 
look at it.  Some heavy messages in some, plus some great Steven Cerio 
art, and a Kafka story illustrated by Peter Kuper.  Last Gasp Eco-Funnies.

***** Meatcake #4 - More gothic-style comics from Dame Darcy, running the
range from silly and bizarre to twisted and disgusting.  Plus, of course,
all of those silly frames and brackets.  Each panel is a work of art all
in itself.  Funny stuff too, in an adult sort of way.  Fantagraphics.

*** Milk and Cheese #666 - More heavy-duty hate and violence, from the dairy 
products gone bad.  All of the strips are a bit predictable, but the sheer
attitude and gore pull them through.  M&C go on booze-drenched rampages
with blood drives, celebrity stalking, snuffing the old (actually cathartic
for anyone who's had to deal with some old fucker in traffic..), Darth Vader
masks, and the favorite for the 90s, blaming society.  Tons of great
commentary.  Slave Labor Graphics.

**** Naughty Bits #16 - Bitchy Bitch is still in her college years.  After
getting hold of "The Pill", she starts her own version of the sexual 
revolution.  She gets involved with the anti-war movement, primarily
just so she can meet guys, and its one after another.  Its a fun, roller-
coaster ride watching her emotions and moods, and Roberta Gregory has
captured it quite nicely.  Fantagraphics.

*** Negative Burn #13 - 64-page anniversary issue.  The best stories were
the ones on the comical side: "Sweet Dreams" and "Calculus Test".  Also,
another episode of the "Twilight People", Milk & Cheese (Blood Drive, also
in M&C #666), and a great, timely Classics Desecrated.  Caliber Press

**** Negative Burn #15 - A really outstanding issue.  This one includes a
powerful piece on voyeurism and lack of control, Mr. Mamoulian, a samurai
collecting souls for immortality, but he gets caught in Hiroshima, another
installment of "Lost Laughter", a really sick "Classics Desecrated", and
Einstein solves a murder mystery.  All readlly good.  Caliber Press.

** Negative Burn #16 - Not many whole stories, mostly the more artsy-style
written stories and "mood" pieces.  But, it does have part 6 of "Lost
Laughter" and a somewhat politically-correct Classics Desecrated.  Caliber.

*** Negative Burn #18 - Best stories in this issue are T.O.M. Foolery, and
the multidimensional "Lost Laughter".  Also, the dark humor in "My
Rottenest Christmas Ever" is fun.  The rest is fairly consistent with the
series.  Caliber comics

***** Nurture the Devil #3 - Part 3 and conclusion of "The Garden", a sordid
tale of incest, domination, sadism, and cruelty.  Horrible family secrets
are uncovered, leading to a bizarre ritual and destruction.  Very disturbing
story in Jeff Johnson's unique art style.  A must read.  Fantagraphics.

*** Peepshow #7 - Joe Matt tells about his earlier adventures as a
pre-teen.  Not too much angst for one of Joe's comics, but you can see where
a lot of his ideas and habits come from.  Eerily similar to a lot of other
people's experiences; plus, he gets multiple bonus points for enduring a
catholic school without getting sucked into it.  Drawn & Quarterly.

***** Politically Incorrect Playhouse #1 - One-page strips, most starring
Ol' Sully, also some with the politically incorrect hero for the 90s, Fat
Drunk Bastard.  As the title implies, this comic tears apart absolutely
every "PC" idea ever proposed.  Everything is fair game, and nothing too
extreme- its the perfect antidote for today's censorship-in-disguise.  Even
in their most wretched excesses, there's a grain of honest, naked truth.
*!*!* officially deemed SACRED RELIC *!*!*  MUST HAVE!!!!  Mansion Comics.

**** Post Brothers #40 - Continuing the Digital War Party story, Ron and Russ
doe battle with the computer virus, but in tearing it to pieces, it infects
all of Bugtown and *becomes* Bugtown.  As usual, lots of gratuitous violence.
Plus, Matt's music news.  Aeon.

****  Post Brothers #41 - Part 3 of Digital War Party.  With the reality-
shifting powers of Bugtown itself, the virus goes after Ron and Russ.  They
shift into computer viruses, and go on the offensive.  Things aren't looking
good- will Cthulhu come to the rescue?  Aeon.

**** Pressed Tongue #3 - Another chapter in the tale of struggling comic
artists, sexual frustration, cure-all baby shit, strange mutant plants,
and disgusting sores.  Things end up work out for the better for (almost) 
everyone, but its still one strange story.  Gross, but compelling.
Wild art too, by Dave Cooper.  Fantagraphics.

*** Real Girl #7 - A bit heavy on the lesbian comics/stories, which is ok,
just a bit hard to relate to.  But, there are other comics about
relationships in general, from a female point of view, plus others with
nothing to do with the male/female thing, but done by women.  Lots of talent
here, plus a "Girltalk" with a great Fiona Smyth cover on the back.  
Fantagraphics

*** Real Stuff #20 - Still more of Dennis Eichhorn's true stories.  Tales
include a jerk from high-school whose karma catches up with him, a disaster
of a date in which a tape being reviewed unexpectedly has scatology scenes,
and Wild Man Fischer performs at a state park concert disguised as a
Universal Life Church picnic.  Plus more, and its all *true*.  Fantagraphics.

*** Ren & Stimpy #27 - In Raiders of the Lost Yak, the boys search the jungle
for the Golden Yak; but once they find it, a genie comes out and grants them
three wishes.  Naturally, they completely waste them.  In another story,
they sneeze their eyes out and get them mixed up; each sees the other as the
other one sees them, and its not pretty.  Fairly Original.  Marvel Comics

*** Ren & Stimpy #31 - Ren builds a huge castle out of canned meats so he
can win a contest for a million dollars.  But, before the prize committee
can verify it, Stimpy eats the entire putrid thing.  This episode brings
back the memory of Vienna sausages, which I'd rather forget.  Plus, Stimpy
brings home a foul and dirty hobo friend.  Marvel comics.

***  Ren & Stimpy Show Special - Four Swerks - Special issue with all-new
stories.  R&S play golf, go gambling-crazy in Las Vegas, get stuck on a bus,
plus the special "Toast in the Machine" story with Powdered Toast Man.
Funny, but not too gross or disgusting.  Marvel Comics.

*** Ren & Stimpy Eenteractive Special - not too much story in this one, but
lots of send-ups of those old silly maze/where's Waldo/connect-the-dots
puzzles.  Plus, it has strips to cut out and past together to make a
continuous story that lasts forever.  Marvel Comics.

**** Savage Henry #3 - Henry goes off on an adventure with Richard Pinhas,
european guitar legend.  When Henry blows out an ice-chip in Boche's
equipment, they go to another strange dimension to get another one,
encountering a strange backward-time woman.  This may be the last 
issue for a while.  Iconografix.

*** Tank Girl - The Odyssey #2 - After bringing all her comrades back to 
life, the gang sets sail for Australia.  They make it, but fall captive to
cannibal movie producers, who eat one of them.  Now on DC's Vertigo label,
its good, but something's a bit *different* about it.  Jamie Hewlett still
does the art, at least.  DC Comics.

*** The Tick: Karma Tornado #7 - The Tick and Arthur travel to a deserted
town inhabited by a vampire.  In order to escape, the Tick must defeat the
vampire at a game of Monopoly, but it is a trick to waste time until the
light of morning.  New England Comics Press

*** Tomato #2 - More comics from Ellen Forney.  First, a trip back to the
70s, with the CB in the family van, and a wild costume party her parents
attended.  Plus, a continuation of the story in #1, with the two girls who
made a hot picture series.  More accessible than a lot of the pure "women"-
oriented comics.  Star Head comix.

**  Underwater #2 - Continues the story about a pair of baby twins, one of
which seems to be very intelligent.  Its really hard to understand, though,
with the only words in gibberish.  Perhaps later in the series, things will
fall into place.  Fantagraphics.

** Underwater #3 - The idea is clever, a story from a baby's point of view,
with adult speech appearing as gibberish at first, then gradually becoming
recognizable, but it makes for a slow story.  Especially when its not very
clear from the artwork just whats going on. It would be much better if:
1) There was more of the story in an issue.  Not many panels, as is Chester's
style, might increase the number of issues to tell the story, but can also
unnecessarily drag things out.  2) Replace the illustrated bible story with
more of the regular story.  The artwork is great, but a lot of people either
know that story, or don't care.  Drawn and Quarterly

*** Velvet Touch #6 - More hardcore manga, much in the style of A-Bomb, also
by Venus.  A fair mix; one fairly serious story, another parody about
religious sex censors, and various pictures.  Plus, an anthropomorphic story
taken from other comics in this line.  Antartctic Press.

**** XXXenophile #10 - Another great episode mixing liberal amounts of
science fiction and raw sex.  Comics just don't get much more consistently
explicit and kinky as this one- its definitely in the same class as Cherry
and Horny Biker Sluts. Episodes include appeasing the idols of
sex gods, parallel universes where everyone is joined by their opposite-sex
double, and warlike voluptuous martian babes.  Totally uninhibited.  Palliard
Press.

Action Girl Comics #1 - This is a compilation of female cartoonists, most
of whom have done work locally, but haven't made it into the bigger comics.
The format is much like the Real Girl comic.  Themes run from male/female
relationships to lesbian/bi, horror, parenting, growing up, grunge, and
more.  I especially liked the story of Fluffy, "The Cat Who was a Rock
Star" by Jennifer Sorensen, and "Hey Amy! What Do You Want to Be When You
Grow Up??" by Amy Frushour.  Many of the artists also have self-published
zines or mini-comics available, detailed in short bios.

Empty Love Stories #1 - Definitely not your average boy-meets-girl love
stories, these three stories have a great, unexpected and original twists.
In "White Trash Romance", all is not well in the trailer park, when her
abusive husband starts staying out late each night, and she wins him back
after his affair.  In "One of the Walking Dead", a pretty young socialite
falls in love with a walking-dead, rotting corpse.  When it doesn't work
out in the living world, she is taken by the dead.  Lastly, in "My Target",
a girl obsessed with a rock singer leaves home to chase down her love, but
falls for another obsessive.  Really fun stuff.

Jazzbo!#1 -  Comics that Swing - This is Eric Searleman's comics about his
somewhat uneventful, but interesting adventures in Phoenix.  Plus, he's
really into jazz.  The strips take a look at his daily life, and his
various jobs as newspaper reporter, rock and roll critic, and just "getting
along" in general.  Much of it has that laid-back jazz kind of feel to the
comics.

True Swamp #4 - This is somewhat like Walt Kelley's "Pogo" updated for the
even *more* cynical and harsh realities of the 90s.  This follows various
animals in the forest as they face alienation, unrequitted love, violent
death, insanity, and other emotions that people might feel if they were
subjected to the law of the jungle.  Great story, with believable,
although nonhuman, characters.

The 5lb Bag - issue 1 - refers to the phrase "trying to stuff 10lbs of shit
into a 5lb bag".  Aaron Brandon's first issue- it may be somewhat sparse, but
he's looking for contributors, particularly artwork.  The "Retirement Party"
sets the tone of it- Aaron is a sociology grad who's looking to make some
kind of "difference", but is realistic enough to know how things are.  This
one shows real promise.  $2 per issue, $10 for 6 issue subscription to:
The 5lb Bag c/o Aaron Brandon, 201 Miller Rd. #23, Lebanon, OH  45036

Battle Cry Sounding, and numerous other newspaper-like tracts, from the
Aggressive Christianity Missions Training Corps (ACMTC).  Practicioners of
"recreational christianity" will love these people- get on their list and
you'll get tons of stuff, forever.  And, they aren't the wishy-washy peace
and goodness and light religionoids, they are the full-bore in-your-face
hellfire and brimstone rant and rave types that make Pat Robertson look
like Howard Stern.  Possibly the best collection of intense clip-art too.
Hardcore American Extremism at its finest.  Send something wacky to:
ACMTC Library, PO Box 90, Berino, NM  88024

Bellows of Self #10 - Irreverant, unfiltered self-expression.  This issue
tells why we should fry OJ *and* the media, "Munition of the Month" homemade
explosive instructions, an interview with the band Sockeye, and many other
articles and stories, all of which guaranteed to shock, offend, and/or amuse.
Bellows of Self, PO Box 17285, Salt Lake City (ugh!) UT  84124

Dream Scene Magazine - "quite literally, the magazine of your dreams".
A lot of different people tell their wildest dreams, plus lots of artwork
of various dream imagery.  Its quite a stream of consciousness, and tends
to bring many of my own dreams back to mind, as I read it.  Plus, they
welcome and encourage submissions from everyone.  Include 4 stamps with
your dream submission, and you'll get a free copy when its published.
$3 per issue, 4 for $11.   38 Rossi Ave., Suite Number One, SF CA 84118-4218

*Enter Title Here* - vol. 3 #5 - Items include short essays (yeah, I agree
totally about questioning why we need 100,000 more cops on the streets if all
they seem to do is harrass everyone), short stories, an interview with an
opinionated but worldly "Shoeshine Girl", and lots of movie/music/zine
reviews.  Greg has been watching a lot of those stupid 80s beach films, like
the ones that Gilbert Gottfried shows on USA network- and again, I agree
that they really *suck*, but some of the *real* B-movies, like Slimeball
Bowl-A-Rama, can be fun.  $1.00 to Greg Jarvela, PO Box 14, Vienna OH 44473

*Enter Title Here* - vol. 4 #1 - More articles, plus zine/music/movie
reviews.  Although some people might give Greg some grief for supporting
a lot of conservative views going around nowadays, he doesn't support it
all (Greg, you ought to check out the libertarians- they're probably closer
to what you believe, than the whole "conservative" package deal.  Also, be
careful of the "religious freedom"/school prayer issues- the bottom line is
*they already have it*.  They're after something else, namely, *power*.)
Lots of interesting little adventures and commentary- I especially liked the
trip to the chinese restaurant, where they drank *8* pots of tea.  $1 from
Greg Jarvela, PO Box 14, Vienna OH 44473   [and THANKS!! for the stickers]

Eros Comics - Summer/Fall 95 catalog - They have a HUGE collection of adult

FACTSHEET FIVE #56 - Required reading.  Listings of every zine on every

Free Amerika #3 - Intense, high-velocity zine with just the right amount
of attitude.  Although it may not be a new subject, it can't be said too
many times about the abuse and total corruption of today's government, and
lots of articles are devoted to various aspects of this.  Plus, various
other stories, zine and music reviews, and experiences.  21 pages  for
$1.00 and 2 tamps.  2411 Old Gettysburg Rd.  Camp Hill, PA  17011

Free Life - A Journal of Classical Liberal and Libertarian Thought - #19 -
At a time when the British government seems to be snuffing out the last
vestiges of personal freedom, killing industry, and throwing away its
sovereignty in a massive European socialist experiment, its refreshing to
see that there are still voices of sanity.  This is the publication of the
Libertarian Alliance, who also has many other publications for sale.  Their
reasoning, arguments, and concerns are strikingly in accord with libertarian
thought prevelant in North America- except that they bring a European 
perspective to issues that are rarely, if ever seen over here.  And, its not
a pretty picture- their situation is almost as screwed up as ours.  A 4-issue
subscription to Free Life is 10 pounds sterling, or $20.00 US.  Recommended
for anyone who likes Reason magazine.  The Libertarian Alliance,
25 Chapter Chambers, Esterbrooke Street, London SW1P 4NN, England

Gray Areas vol 3 #2 - This magazine is devoted to the unhindered exploration
of the "gray area" of society; the shady, shadowy fringes of the law and
morality.  Issues like hacking, software piracy, phreaking, etc. get a lot
of coverage, but it also includes issues such as pornography, prostitution,
drug use, pirate radio, stealing cable TV, and other issues that aren't
quite as clear-cut as some people might like.  Articles include an interview
with adult film star Taylor Wayne, the Cyberpunk Manifesto, Phrack publisher
Chris "Erik Bloodaxe" Goggans, and much more.  Plus, tons of reviews on just
about everything.  140 info-packed and FUN pages.  Four issues just $18,
12-issue sub for $50, sample copies $6 to: Gray Areas, PO Box 808,
Broomall, PA 19008-0808

  QUOTE: "Adding another fifty thousand cops to the streets of America
  would definitely curb twelve *million* more John Q. Schmucks to the
  side of the road and into traffic court every year.  If they miraculously
  arrested more criminals, the miscreants would have to be jailed in your
  garage, since the prisons are already slopping over.  So much for
  "crime control".  More cops = more *tickets*."

Hand of Smite #6/7 - Randy Porter's fun little zine is back after a move and
a disastrous attempt at #6.  This issue contains the last OJ Simpson
conspiracy, the scandalous truth about The Flintstones, the Chuck/Richie
Cunningham conspiracy, plus lots of reviews about great exploitation films.
The attitude and humor is great, with offbeat and *original* articles found
nowhere else.  Only $1, or $5 for 6 issues.  PO Box 1064, Lufkin TX  75902

The Haw River Testimony - vol. 4 #2 - This is the simulated newspaper of the
fictional town of Saxapahaw, and is an equal mixture of silliness, satire,
and hard criticism, as it includes media icons, politicians, and extremists
of all sorts in the town's business.  The cartoon pages are great- all the
regular sunday comics are reprinted, with the dialog changed to sexually
explicit conversations.  Go with the Dagwoods to the local XXX video
parlor!  No price listed, but try $1 or so to: Sam Gaines, 320 S. Aycock St.
Greensboro, NC  27403-2301

Church of Bay Hill.  Tons of articles, graphics, and cartoons- recapping
last year's tremendous Devival at Dragon*Con, and looking forward to the
next.  Plus, even more evidence of "Bob"'s earthly schemes- as if any more
were needed.  Also, church news, reviews and neat stuff to want and buy.
Plus info on "Barefoot and Pregnant" and many other of Dave's projects.

Interesting! Issue 2 (with the Post Office screwup letter on front)
This is Richard Sagall's compendium of lots of different articles and
lists of things he finds particularly interesting.  And, it runs the gamut
from chemicals found in driveways, to airplaine food, to quotes and bumper
stickers.  In this issue, he takes on frivolous lawsuits, myth-placed
values, millenium-madness, and lots of other trivia.  Also, being a doctor,
he goes after mis-information in the media.  Lots of stuff, and it *is*
interesting.  Issues are $3 each, however many of them you want.
PO Box 1069, Bangor ME  04402-1069, or Rich24@aol.com

The Junto #25 - Proof that there is actually *more* coming out of NC than
Jesse Helms diatribes and cigarettes. (hey, and HToMC!)  This isn't exactly
a zine intended for widespread distribution; all subscribers, by the rules,
must also be participants (being an APA).  It has a very heavily 
libertarian/free market/freedom orientation, although it is open to the
civil discussion of any relevant topics from any viewpoint.  It covers a lot  
of ground, from the idiocies and injustices of the current US government, to
foreign viewpoints, life experiences, philosophical discussions, and
simply amusing and entertaining bits of news.  Sample copy is $2.00, and
there's a lot here- over 100 pages worth.  But, if you really want to join,
send them your zine or something that you've written.  Its by invitation
only, but they are more than fair and reasonable folks.  Sean Haugh,
703 Ninth St. #330, Durham, NC 27705  (haugh@acpub.duke.edu)

Karma Lapel vol.1 #6 - This is still a BIG review zine, with tons of zines,
mini-comics, music, and books.  It was meant to fill the vacuum left when
Factsheet Five was on hiatus; so now that FS5 is back in gear, upcoming
issues will take off in new directions.  There are also various articles
and stories in this one, as well as news about the comic/zine industries.
As good a read as FS5.  $2 for large newsprint-style to: Karma Lapel
PO Box 5467, Evanston IL  60204-5467

Laissez Faire Books - March 1995 catalog - Hundreds of books on economics,
public policy, science and technology, political theory, and more.  One of
the main books is "Why the Welfare State Must Go", as well as a special
section on how free people resist taxes.  Includes a lot of material on
popular "conservative" economic themes, but without the hypocritical social
views and censorship.  In fact, many of the titles run counter to the
anti-freedom theocratic tendencies of the GOP.  Lots of good stuff here.
938 Howard St. #202, San Francisco, CA  94103  (415) 541-9780  LFB@panix.com

LED Balloons - cartoons by Dave Kochler.  He's looking to get his cartoons
published.  They're irreverent, often gross and disgusting, silly, non-PC,
and often disrespectful.  Which earns them HIGH marks- they're actually
quite funny.  I got many serious chuckles from them, and they're easily as
good as many in the "official" alternative magazines.  Contact him if you're
intersted:  Dave Kochler, 4506 Darcie Dr.,  Erie, PA  16506

Mongoloid Moose #12 - In this issue, Scott takes time out to answer and
discuss all of the mail he's gotten over the past year.  Many of the people
writing are from other zines, and there's a lot of discussion on what a
lot of various people have been doing.  Beats any TV "talk" show by a mile.

of the SubGenius.  Plus, zine reviews, and the biggest and best section of
alternative *alternative* music around- possibly even more than even your
local "alternative" radio station ever heard of.  (Hey- I have an *original*
british pressing of "Ralf and Florian"...)  Also, an interview with Paul
Sadler of Big Electric Cat. Tons of great stuff.  $2 from PO Box 53,

RoMSFaFiNA #2 - This zine delves into various philosophical topics, many
involving science fiction and technology.  This thread runs through book
reviews, explorations of old woodworking "appropriate" technology, and
a rant on what science fiction writers *ought* to be including in their
stories, and more.  A bit more high-brow and deep than a lot of zines, but
I found it thoughtful and interesting.  Send "the usual", zine for review,
letter of comment, articles or illustrations to: Dan Harper, PO Box 194,
Concord MA  01742-0194  email: danlharp@aol.com

Keane Must Die", a hard-hitting analysis of the sickeningly "cute" and
intellectually insulting "Family Circus" cartoons.  Also, adventures of 
"Those Wacky Christians!!", plus the ever-popular Crazy Christian Conspiracy

Sticky Green's Zine - #1, the Pot & Pleasure issue - This zine focuses mainly
on the stupidity of marijuana and drug prohibition, and other police state
repression.  There's a fair amount of other info to- I particularly liked
the LARGE list of porno stars and their addresses.  Plus, a citizenship
questionnaire for immigrants that many citizens probably wouldn't pass,
articles on punk and other music, cartoons, a fair amount of independent
music listings and ads, and more.  40 full-size pages, listed as "free", but

                Neat NET Stuff....

Dreamboy - Monthly journal of dreams.  Much like the print-zine "Dream 
Scene", but perhaps a bit more overtly sexual in some of the dream 
descriptions.  Lots of fun to read, and issues of this e-zine will 
eventually get published in book form.  To get on the mailing list, send
e-mail to Christopher Romano (CDROMANO@earthlink.net).  You may also view
back issues at http://www.etext.org/Zines/UnitCircle/dreamboy/

The Shrine of Bazooka Joe - http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~joe/bazooka_html
This web site is the home of those pithy little "Bazooka Joe" comic strips
from the bubblegum packages.  Plus, some interesting commentary and analysis
of the social messages hidden in the strips, that you may have never thought
about.  Tons of actual scanned strips are available in full-color graphics!!

Man or Astroman? - http://www.duc.auburn.edu/~delburo/
This is the home page of the independent but popular band.  They are actually
space aliens whose ship has wrecked.  As the scrounge for parts to repair it,
they travel around giving performances.  Also, you can view their latest
video online, "Sferic Waves" from the "Inside the Head of Mr. Atom" 7",
produced by Sarah Jacobson, on a *very* low budget.

Tank Girl - http://www.mgmua.com/tankgirl
The official web site for the MGM movie based on the popular comic by
Hewlett & Martin.  Too bad the movie bombed- I never even saw it once on
single movie marquee- not even the dollar movies.  Apparently, MGM pumped
quite a few dollars into this web page as a promotion.  They have info on
how they made the movie, video clips, and even a web-game that you play,
visiting the sites from the movie, with t-shirts and other promo junk as
prizes.  Maybe thats over, but the site is still here.

Get out your Zippos...its the Flag-Burning page!  In response to the proposed
amendment, go to http://www.indirect.com/user/warren/flag.html to see images
of the US flag going up in flames.  Far from being a mindless anti-US rant,
this is intended as a celebration of the First Amendment in all of its often
uncomfortable but necessary implications.  There is extensive information on
censorship and why he opposes any first "exception" to freedom of speech,
plus you can leave your own comments.  Also, there is a complete history of
flag burning.  Everyone with a strong opinion one way or another should read
this- it is a very principled stand on a politically unpopular isue, which
means that the idiots in Washington will probably vote to take away our most
critical freedoms, rather than appear "unpatriotic".  As one comment said,
"Protect freedom, not flags".

Coed Cuties - amateur XXX tape available from net - tricoeds@ix.netcom.com
These are three Florida girls who decided to make their own porn tape to
supplement their college tuition money, so they had someone tape them
"playing around" one night.  Although the tape does suffer somewhat from
various technical amateur mistakes, it is quite good for the most part, and
downright HOT and NASTY for large portions of it.  Lots of "toy" action too.
Great looking girls too- one of them works at Hooters, and another was once
a Homecoming Queen in high school.  What the tape may lack in production
value, it makes up for in ACTION.  Only $25 + $3 postage for Priority Mail
(or about $1.70 in stamps if you don't need it priority)  DON'T SEND CHECKS!
Cash or Money Order made out to "cash" to: CoedCuties, PO Box 547132,
College Park Station, FL  32854.  Also include age statement (over 18...)


Space Moose - the regular cartoon appearing in the Univ. of Alberta since
1989 is now available online!  Some consider it offensive, but anyone with
half a sense of humor should love it.  A recent strip has the Grimace
character from the McDonald's ads, fighting to the death with Barney the
Dinosaur.  http://fourier.bme.med.ualberta.ca/~adam/space_moose.html
Lots of strips in the archive, plus t-shirts are available from
