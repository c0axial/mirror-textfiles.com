which stole american manufactoring jobs by selling dumped japanese
products which were made with american know how in the 50's given that
we bombed them, and that they bombed china, and that all the simpsons
toys are manufactored in china?

             Buying these comix will fix the U.S. economy:

*** Bill the Clown: Death & Clown White - An ex-famous circus clown driven over
the edge, Bill deals with school violence, militant Hare Krishnas, and scumbag
comic producers the way he does best: with heavy weapons, violence, and
twisted revenge.  Slave Labor Graphics  989 S. Bascom Ave. San Jose  CA  95128

**** Eightball #9 - More cartoons by Daniel Clowe - continuation of the strange
"Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron" story.  Plus, Dan Pussey vs. the sleazy
world of modern "art", Fuckface, and Zubric and Pogeybait strips. Great stories
in his lurid comic style.  Fantagraphic Books 

*** Monkey Business #2 - Different cartoons including "Rank & Stinky", a R&S
parody, "Mother Goose & Grimm", those great "Bizarro" cartoons, and "It's a
Wonderful Life part 2".  Clever and somewhat funny, but tame.  Parody Press.

*** Negative Burn anthology issue 2 - Short but intense stories including the
Russian WWII front, the horrors of child sexual abuse, kids reading Playboy
magazine, and more.  Plus, Mr. Mamoulian strip, and a great "Stubbs the Cat"
strip.  Caliber Press.

*** Post Bros. #33 - Ron fights his way through a planet of super-mutants in
order to clear up the TV reception.  While Jeri is moving in with Ron, she
discovers that her brother has been killed- and Ron is framed for this and
her father's death by Boche.  Next one should be *real* tense... Rip Off Press

* Ren & Stimpy #13 - Stimpy accidentally turns a piece of gum under a table
into a rampaging monster in this Halloween special.  The clown hearse was a
nice touch, but this comic is getting lame again.  Nothing new or even clever.

booked for a concert on Thurmin, they run afoul of the law against their type
of music.  To their surprise, the local dictator is actually Hiroshima, their
old enemy- and they have been set up by Russell Post.  Plus, tons of plugs for
obscure electronic music bands.  Rip Off Press.

actual storyline.  Brainstorm Comics,457 Main St. Ste. 162 Farmingdale NY 11735

***** Tank Girl #4 - Conclusion of the 2nd series has Tank Girl in more rude
and outrageous stories: "Blue Helmet", "Fucked Up Afro Zombie Babes from
Nowhere", and "The Fall and Rise and Fall and The Ship In The Bottle".  More
gutter humor, nudity, and senseless violence that seems to pick up with each
new issue.  Dark Horse Comics,  10956 SE Main St.  Milwaukie, OR  97222

have failed to stop the cults which may awaken Cthulhu. Nice overview of mythos

**** The Worlds of H.P. Lovecraft: Arthur Jermyn - The story of several
generations of a cursed family of aristocratic explorers, the terrible secrets
they uncover about themselves, and their tragic end.  This one has the most
"Lovecraft" feel about it of the series, particularly the stories later in the
Cthulhu mythos.  Caliber Press  621-B S. Main St. Plymouth, MI 48170

*** Yummy Fur #31 - This issue has a strip in dedicaton to Chester's new
live-in girlfriend, Sook-Yin, lead singer of the band "Bob's Your Uncle".
Plus, the story "Matthew 9:31-10:42" illustrating biblical stories of Jesus
healing the dead; with somewhat of a cynical edge on that and other somewhat
questionable passages in the "good" book.  Its hard to judge exactly what he's
saying here.  Drawn and Quarterly Publications.

                                                       THE OHIO STATE LANTERN
                                                       Friday, October 1, 1993
                   POLICE NEARLY CONFISCATE FILM

                OSU eatery is scene of CPD reaction

                          By John Bowley
                       Lanter staff writer

   Wednesday night, Columbus police officers made Freakin' Pizza employees
remove fliers that advertised a movie to be shown at the restaurant that
night and also warned the owner not to view the night's planned movie.
   The police took down the fliers that advertised Joe Christ's film
"Acid is Groovy, Kill the Pigs," said Kirby Witmer, owner of Freakin' Pizza,
9 Chittenden Ave.  Witmer also said the officer warned him that if he showed
the film, he would take his "license away;" a specific license was not
mentioned.
   Apparently, the police misunderstood the meaning behind the title of the
film and did not go through with their threat, Witmer said.
   "They thought that the film advocated or was about cop killing -- it has
nothing to do with it (cop killing) whatsoever," Witmer said.  "The movie
is about a murderer who killed his family, and what he wrote in his family's
blood above the murder scene."
   "Acid is Groovy, Kill the Pigs" is an underground film directed by Joe
Christ.  The film is a true to life, but farcical look at the infamous 1970
"Fatal Vision" murders in which Jeffrey McDonald slaughtered his family in
their home in Fayetteville, NC.  McDonald blamed the killings on a roving
Charles Manson-like band of drug-crazed hippies.
   Before the police realized the film wasn't threatening toward the law
enforcement industry, Witmer said police harassed his customers.
   The officers occasionally issued jaywalking tickets to customers crossing
the street to enter the store and shined a spotlight through the restaurant's
window to obscure the screen, Witmer said.
   During the show, Witmer said the officers wandered in and out of the
restaurant examining the video tapes and speaking with Christ.
   After deducing that the film was not intended to provoke violence against
police officers, the officers quietly left.
   Christ's film jokingly hypothesizes that the hippie gang actually existed,
and in low-budget style followed the gang around town as they mutilated
genitalia, pistol-whipped pregnant women and gobbled whole sheets of blotter
acid.
   Christ said after the showing, "There are plenty of reasons to be offended
by this film, but killing cops isn't one of them."
   Police at the scene offered no comment.

                 Jim Morrison: Space Ranger part 4

               by  T. Rev  <hin9@midway.uchicago.edu>


   The hike was easier than Thailand ever had been, actually.  The 
land was dry, and as they climbed, the air became cooler.  Morrison 
was in peak condition, as well.  He was hardly winded by the time 
they came to a small valley between two low peaks.  Lemmy set down 
his pack and leaned against a tree.
   "This is as far as I go, lads."  He gestured north.  "It's at the 
other end of the valley.  Have fun.  I'll wait for twenty hours, 
then I'm gone."
   Morrison snorted.  "Enjoy the needler."  He started walking 
again.  Jimi followed.
   As they went on, the valley opened out.  It was mostly tall 
grass, with occasional fruit and nut trees.  The air was fresh and 
cool.  There was no sign of human or animal trails, though a few 
squirrels demonstrated that the valley wasn't totally lifeless.

   Hendrix heard the Hueys first.  He elbowed Morrison and pointed 
toward the far end of the valley, where two of the Vietnam vintage 
gunships were hanging heavily in the sky.
   "What now, man?  We got no place to hide!"
   Morrison scowled.  "We don't need one."  And he levelled the 
crystal gun and fired.
   The first gunship squealed brightly and one of its rotors flew 
off.  As it plunged, wobbling, toward the ground, the stray rotor 
flew out and hit the second Huey dead in the gas tank.  The gasoline 
went up in a sullen red fireball, wrapping the helicopter in black 
smoke, while the first craft crashed to the ground.
   "Metal fatigue, no doubt," said Morrison softly.  The second Huey 
hit the ground with an echoing boom.
   "If we're lucky, they still don't know we're here," he continued.  
"If we move up the side of the valley, we might be able to stay out 
of sight.  At least until we get close."
   "How do you figure that?"
   "Old ninja trick.  Nobody could possibly  get to them on foot.   
Not without any cover.  So they won't look."
   "Oh."  Hendrix accepted the explanation without complaint.
   They trotted the hundred or so yards to where the walls of the 
valley started to slope sharply upward, then turned again and 
continued toward its end.
   Within a few minutes, sirens began to wail.  Two enormous gates 
opened in the wall of the fortress, and several large vehicles, part 
three-wheel ATV, part halftrack, surged forth toward the wreckage of 
the aircraft.  Hendrix stopped short, but Morrison kept walking.  By 
this time, they were close enough to see the faces of the guards.
   Morrison's face broke into a savage smile.
   "Robbie!"

   Six rifles pivoted toward the pair.  "Hold fire!" barked the 
leader.  He shaded his eyes.  "Identify yourselves!"
   Morrison strolled towards them arrogantly, hands open.  "I gather 
it's been fifteen years for you, Robbie.  Not for me.  Why don't you 
identify me?"
   The leader gaped.  
   "Jim!  They said you were killed in 'Nam!"
   "Yeah, well, they said God was dead.  Wanna talk about it?"
   Robbie Krieger looked at the wreckage, and his face twisted.  
"What the hell is this?" he demanded, waving at the smouldering, 
twisted metal.
   "Dunno, Robbie," Morrison said innocently.  "I think Jimi and I 
were followed here.  We need to talk to the boss right away."
   "You mean..."
   "What you think I mean, yeah," snapped Morrison.  "We're working 
for the boss too.  How do you think we knew how to get here?"
   "Why didn't you come the normal way?"
   "I just told you, Robbie, we were being followed.  Come on over, 
Jimi."  Hendrix walked over, smiling beneath his straw hat.  
Morrison turned back to Krieger.  His voice became low and silky.
   "Now listen, Robbie, if we were followed, and the people who did 
it are out there now, we'd better get back under cover, right?  And 
you'd better take us to the boss, so we can explain what's happened, 
right?"
   Krieger looked around.  "Okay," he said.  He turned to the other 
soldiers.  "Check out the wreckage for survivors, then get back 
under cover.  There may be snipers in the area."  He beckoned 
Morrison and Hendrix to follow, then climbed back into one of the 
vehicles.

   "I hope you realize I'm doing you a favor, Jim," Krieger 
remarked.  The craft rolled through the gates into a huge tunnel.  
Sparsely functioning fluorescent lights lit their way.
   "Oh, no doubt about that, Robbie."
   The tunnel was long.  Morrison had the time to face his thoughts.
   The whole operation had been too easy.  Too damn many 
coincidences.  Robbie was here.  In the middle of fucking Colombia, 
working for the man Morrison was going to murder.   What the hell 
are you doing?  he asked himself.  Morrison's head snapped upward in 
shock.  Krieger looked at him strangely.  "You okay?"
   Morrison shivered.  "Fine, man.  Long day."
   Was it nothing more than a story?  A script he was playing out?  
Just a setup.
   Then he realized what had been bothering him.  Bob had had his 
agents changed.   Poor Jimi was nearly lobotomized by what had been 
placed in his skull.  Cornelius was already mad.  Moon simply wasn't 
--whatever had claimed to be Moon was some kind of simulation.
   What had they done to Morrison?   Slowly, his fingers crept up to 
his scalp, feeling the cat's-whisker lines of the scars beneath his 
hair.
   A static roar passed through his mind, and Morrison started to 
chuckle.  Maybe Art did cover such things.  At the end of his grand, 
heroic quest, Our Hero discovers his True Will has been corrupted 
from within.  Irony of the purest sort.  Morrison leaned back in the 
car, stretching and considering.  What, he wondered, would be the 
proper Artistic response to such an overture?
   Of course.  An act of heroic desperation.  Very American.
   Morrison rested the barrel of the crystal gun against his temple, 
spun the dial, and pressed the trigger.

   Nothing happened.
   In fact, a number of things stopped.   The roaring died away.  
His headache faded, replaced by a warm throbbing beneath his scars.  
To Morrison, it was as if a roiling, oily cloud finally had been 
blown away from the surface of his mind, revealing what lay beneath.
   'Goddamn, that was a stupid thing to do,' he thought.  He noticed 
Hendrix and Krieger staring at him, aghast.
   "Click-click!" he said brightly.  "Not loaded.  Quick, look at 
the road, Robbie!"  Krieger turned back in time to steer the craft 
back on course.
   Now, it fell into place.
   Bad luck.  That was what the gun hit with.  Call it Entropy, Bad 
Karma, whatever--it was plain old bad luck.  That's what took out 
the Hueys; two of the worst coincidences even remotely possible.  
And there must be some safety feature that protects the user from 
backlash--so the only thing the gun affected was whatever they'd put 
in his head.  Now he was really free.  And there was no reason for 
him to be here.  He could just turn around and go home now.  
Revenge?  Bullshit.  Why would he care about revenge? 
  
   Fuck it.  May as well find out.
   The craft sped on down the tunnel.

   "Place has sure changed since the last time we were here, 
Robbie," Morrison offered casually.  "How's it laid out these days?"
   Krieger took the bait.  "Well, you noticed the battlements we 
built up on the side of the mountain.  That's all new work.  Also 
been digging deeper into the mountain.  The Boss spends most of his 
time down there.
   "We're passing the old sections now."  Dark breaks in the walls 
revealed side tunnels, but the craft did not turn.
   Morrison leaned back toward Hendrix.  Speaking low under the roar 
of the engine, he said, "Follow my lead, Jimi.  No moves unless I 
make them first."
   Hendrix winked.
   After another ten silent minutes, the craft slowed to a stop in 
front of a huge blast door.  Cameras locked into place, scanning the 
cabin.  Krieger whispered into a radio.  The door opened.
   "He says you should go in alone, Jim."
   But of course.   It should be interesting to see, at last, the 
one responsible for this escapade.
   Morrison walked through the blast door with his head held high 
and a bleak amusement in his heart.
   Beyond the door was a huge, roughly-mined room, the ceiling 
sheeted in mist, the walls stretching into the murky distance.  
Several yards from the door were long tables, ringed about with 
large fluorescent lamps.
   "Hey, Bob!" shouted Morrison.  His cracking baritone had 
degenerated into a gravelly roar in the jungles, but the echoes here 
gave back some of the old menacing smoothness.  No response came.
   Morrison approached the tables.  On them were strange objects--
sculptures?  Here was one that started at one end as crystal, shot 
through with fine metal tracework like his gun; but it finished at 
the other as an amorphous, dull, burned-looking heap.  Another was 
some sort of clockwork, but the gears were crumbly-looking, like 
year-old bread.  A figure of a monkey, made of tightly curled, dead 
leaves, was perched on the edge of one of the tables.  He reached 
out towards it, then jerked his hand back as it chattered feebly and 
rustled away from him.  He watched in fascination as it leapt from 
the table to the ground--and shattered into a simple pile of leaves.
   "Don't make them like they used to," he remarked.
   "No, they don't," said a nasal, scratchy voice.  Morrison turned.  
He recognized the heavy-lidded, bloodshot eyes; the sullen sneer was 
the same even after fifteen years.
   It was Dylan.
   "It's entropy.  Jerry told me all about it.  All the tarantulas 
in the world won't save you.  You're mine, you and all the others 
who tried to hide."  He coughed raggedly.  "Your souls are mine.  
They didn't save me, and they won't save you!"
   Of all possible scenarios, this was the most blatant.  Morrison 
was disappointed but not surprised.  "But what does that have to do 
with art, Bob?" Morrison responded reasonably.
   "Art?  You and your art!  Thought you could hold onto it by 
running away, you and Hendrix and Moon.  You were wrong!  Henh!  
They stole it from me, so I stole it from you."  Dylan looked sad 
for a moment.  "Didn't stay, didn't help, no, can't keep the edge, 
entropy you know.  Jerry told me about that.  But if I didn't keep 
it, how could you?  Answer me!"
   "Oh, not at all, I'm sure, Bob," said Morrison.
   "Henh.  You're mine!" Dylan repeated.  "I wanted it, too, you 
know.  I was getting it for a while, then it went away again," he 
sobbed.  "I had you then.  But it went away, so what was the point?"
   Morrison started to answer, but Dylan was raging again.
   "You're doomed, now!  You're no use to me, you and Hendrix, 
you'll be dust in the gutter soon."  A trace of yellowish foam had 
collected on Dylan's lips.
   Morrison was already bored.  "What about Moon?"
   "Moon, henh, Moon really was dead.  That was the computer.  
They're doing wonderful things these days, really nice."  He 
whispered the word 'nice' to himself a few times.
   "The only way you can escape is to kill me," he added hopefully.
   Morrison stared at Dylan with contempt.
   "Is that the best you can do?"
   "Eh?"
   Morrison stepped toward Dylan, grabbed him by the shirt, and 
lifted him six inches into the air.  Now they were eye to eye.
   "I said, is that the best you can do?  Do you mean that you did 
all this to me and Jimi because of a death wish?"
   "Not at first," Dylan added helpfully.  "I was after your talent 
then."
   Morrison snorted.  "Didn't help much, if those things on the 
table were the best you could do."  He shook his head.  "Bob.  Did 
you really think I was stupid enough to go along with it?"  He 
dropped Dylan, who stumbled and fell heavily to the ground.  He 
knelt down and smiled gently at the tired old man.  "Hey, Bob, 
listen.  I am the Lizard King!  I can do anything!"
   And he walked away.  At the door he turned back.  "Bob?  Get a 
hobby.  Go on tour with the Grateful Dead, if they're still around, 
or something.  But don't come whining to me with your problems next 
time."

   Outside the door, Krieger was still waiting with the craft.  
"What did he say?"
   Morrison looked at the open doorway.  "Oh, he's going to have to 
change his plans.  He may be in there for a while."  As if to agree, 
the blast door swung shut.  "Hendrix and I are going to have to go 
back in the field.  You can take us back outside.  We'll find our 
own way from there.
   "Oh, and Robbie, if you find yourself out of a job anytime soon, 
look me up.  I'm thinking of going back on the road.  This secret 
agent stuff is getting dull."

   At the other end of the valley, Lemmy was waiting.  "Still alive, 
eh?  Good job.  Back to Los Angeles?"
   "Back to Los Angeles."

   On the way back, Morrison told them what had happened to him.  
Hendrix listened intently.  Lemmy just snickered.

   Eighteen hours later, Morrison and Hendrix were at the gate in 
Los Angeles Airport.
   "Where you bound, Jimi?"
   "Dunno.  I was thinking about going up to San Francisco, watch 
the sunsets for awhile."
   "Going to play again?"
   "Someday.  I still got my guitar.  You?"
   Morrison stared off into space.  "Well, I still have the money I 
got off Jerry.  And Bob was wrong.  I can still write.  That's 
really all I ever wanted to do, Jimi, is write."  He laughed.  "I 
got a lot to write about now.  Maybe I'll run into you in a bar 
sometime, or something."
   "Yeah, or something.  Hey, uh, if you ever want to start making 
music again, lemme know, okay?"
   Morrison smiled.  "I will, Jimi."
   Hendrix grasped Morrison by the shoulder.  "You're a good man, 
Mr. Mojo Risin'."
   "I don't know about that.  But at least..."  Morrison stared out 
into the passing crowd.  No one looked back.  He laughed.  "I'm a 
man now, and not a myth.  That's good enough, I think."

FIN.
