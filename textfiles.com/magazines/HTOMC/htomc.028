A Prayer To J.R. "Bob" Dobbs

vocals: Saint Janor Hypercleets
bass:   Pope  Keckhaver Sternodox
guitar: $aint @ndrew

Oh Dobbs, canst thou not hear my plea
In my utter 'umbleness 
for Lo! Dobbs, I am nothing but a loathsome piece of shit
before thy ultimate and divine power
who smoketh the pipe of infinity, the pipe of the universe
Can I not be washed in the smoke of the pipe?

Hereth my request that Lo,
I humbly beseech thee, Dobbs, that in thy justice
in thy infinite mercy and righteousness that thou might allow me
infinite power over all other living beings in the universe

And, Dobbs, I humbly beseech thee that I might be allowed to control
the food source for all nations on earth in order that every person in
every country in every city in every town and every neighborhood might
find it necessary to kiss my ass in order to obtain food, their
mininimum daily requirements for nutrition for that day...

And Dobbs, I do humbly request that Lo!
every woman on earth, without exception
(except those who don't meet my taste specifications)
and those that are over seventeen years of age
be made into my sexual slaves, Dobbs.
I might be granted deaf ears to turn to all other males, Dobbs
so that I in fact won't, how shall we say, in the vernacular, give a shit
about the jealous cries of all other males O Dobbs

After I enslave all other women, and Dobbs,
from the beginning of time, mankind has had a vision
a vision of all men, of all nationalities, of races, of all four sexes
coming together and joining hands, and singing together in harmony
And Dobbs, I humbly request that you just totally ignore this vision
because it has absolutely no interest to me whatsoever.

And Dobbs, I selflessly, humbly request that you instead
by ignoring this vision you'll be able to channel more of your psychic
and spiritual energy into my selfish requests

And Dobbs, if I had but one wish for mankind it would be this:
That I would be able to just blow off the whole "one wish" fairy-tale syndrome
and instead that I would have an infinity of wishes and I'd never have to
exist in some kind of storybook reality where a guy gets a pudding stuck on
his god-damn nose or something like that 
or some kind of bullshit or something

And O Dobbs, furthermore, I request that
Humbly Dobbs, I beseech thee on bended knee
looking up to you as the true and one and only source of wisdom
I humbly request that I be allowed to replace Ye and that it shall be me 
that smoketh the pipe of knowledge and it be thee
that standeth on bended knee before me begging mercy 
before me, in which case, I'd just laugh in your face, Dobbs.
I'd turn you down even though it was ye who granted me this power 
in the first place,

and Lo! Dobbs,
I request that I be able to merge with the concept of hate
that I might in fact become one with hate
and Lo! Dobbs, that the concept of conscience be strucken from my mind
that I would never again be able to feel guilt,
and Lo! the word guilt be struck from my vocabulary
So that I could never feel guilt for demanding any of these selfish things.
Oh just little things, like power over all things in the universe...

And Lo! Dobbs, I request that..."

music fades.

                     Swingin' Love Corpses on Tour

                     pdrummond@aol.com (PDrummond)


As with most great bands, the Swingin' Love Corpses never remain in
the same place for very long. Restless, adventuresome spirits,
acknowledged giants in the field of improvisational music, men known
in the industry as musician's musicians, they have constantly
explored new avenues and new outlets for the incessant dynamics of
their music. This has never been more true than on their latest
cassette tape release, Last Tango in Pinckneyville. Again, the
Corpses have taken yet another unexpected turn and come up with one
of the most surprising, innovative, beautiful creations of their
amazing career.

It's been said that the Swingin' Love Corpses music is essentially
cinematic, music of mood and emotion, and their soundtrack album for
Scumsucker III: The Dominatrician is considered an enduring classic
of the genre. And while their music is always alive and new, moving
from free-form to a rich familiarity of soul 'n funk, it has never
lost the driving, irresistible root of frap-a-billy that is at the
very heart of  the collective creative genius of these Po'Bucker-born
masters.
Last Tango in Pinckneyville opens with a wonderfully sensual, breezy
yet inspirationally poignant reading of Gibbon's "Rise and Fall of
the Roman Empire". The song grows and builds to include a disco
backup vocal--the first of many innovations on this cassette. The
Corpses music has never been more immediately accessible, and their
delivery throughout on Last Tango in Pinckneyville carries a powerful
impulse that forces the listener to get up and dance. The cassette is
highlighted by three new Sphinx Drummond songs: "Scotch Tape
Dispenser Blues", "Somatic Discourses on Cerebral Bi-cameralism", and
"Funky Back-Seat Mama." On "Scotch Tape Dispenser Blues" they're
joined by their longtime friend, Sterno, and in expressing his
delight with the outcome of their subtle and intricate collaboration,
Philo said: "The fact that Sterno played on "Scotch Tape Dispenser
Blues" proved to me that dreams really do come true."

The Corpses 1994 Tour Management Team, TEAM CORPSE headed by S.L.A.K.
squad leader, Sphinx Drummond, will kick off this year's World Tour
the weekend of July 15-17 in Atlanta, GA. at Dragon-Con/Atlanta
Comics Expo. 

The Corpses, well known for their highly produced shows heavily laden
with costumes, props, and audience participation, are equally well
known for their cleverly crafted original songs and unusual
renditions of other people's music. Their lyric sense straddles the
fine line between genius and insanity never betraying either extreme.
Their music has been described as "sort of like a cross between Sun
Ra, Zappa, and Abba."
"You never know what to expect at a Corpses show," said Ivan Stang of
the SubGenius Foundation, "Once they appeared as Rock Stars in the
Heavy Metal sense with all the flash and effects, and the next time
they showed up as improvisational jazz masters with goatees and
sunglasses." The Corpses continue to astound and mystify their
audiences. Some have described their live shows as more akin to a
"performance art" project rather than the average run-of-the-mill
rock extravaganza.  On-stage, the Corpses have an unusual knack for
lowering the customary barriers which separate the artists from the
audience. Their on-stage banter and improvisational comedic interplay
with the attendees promote a party-like atmosphere which blurs the
distinction between band and audience.

The Swingin' Love Corpses have streamlined their lineup which at one
time had swollen to nine members, down to a five-piece combo.  After
eight years together, the enigmatic Swingin' Love Corpses still
remain a mystery to the most of mainstream and alternative music
fans. However, their tapes have been heard around the world. China,
Russia, The Netherlands, are but a few of the distant outposts that
have been exposed to what has become known as, "The Swingin' Love
Corpse Experience". In the behind-the-scene music circles they are
well known as a musician's band, playing backup and doing session
work for some of the biggest names in the business. (At this time,
contractual commitments prevent us from mentioning any names). Having
achieved international fame as the "A-Number One" premier band of the
Church of the SubGenius, the Corpses have played to packed houses and
rave reviews in St. Louis, Chicago, Memphis, Atlanta and others
places.
A true genre busting band, the range of their material is too vast to
pin down with any traditional labels. While most of their music is
traditionally structured, the Corpses thrive on blowing away the
barriers that hold the structure together. Their music has been
described at various times as Industrial-Gospel, Acid Blues Polka,
Surf-House, Psycho-Hillbilly, Mystery-Jazz, and even Anti-Music.
Nuances of Punk, Swing, Avant-Garde, Rap, Folk and Glitter-Rock
eventually find their way into most shows.

>I HEAR you.  I hear you saying you don't like Kibo.  [...]

In a way, I perceive the Xibo pure essence of anti-Kibo is more than just
an antithesis.  Yacatisma flux sundered the original *ibo into two distinct
hemispheres, forever condemning them to nattering pee-shy pseudo-antagonism.
They occupy this plane forever; yea, unto the end of this era and beyond!

>>You alone are bad enough, but then we get xibo who follows-up every goddamn

>>"You're not allowed."     <-----correct choice

Sure y'are!  Least until July 5, 1998 when Earth becomes nothing more than
a trashed-out Stuckey's in space.  *I* will be on the pleasure saucers, some
sex goddess workin' my joystick to pilot our little aluminum love nest to the
15th dimension, while Kibo, Xibo, and Weemba continue their tired diatribe,
barely aware that something has changed and they no longer need flashlights
in the dark.  And where will *YOU* be?

#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#


                     COMICS TO SAVE YOUR SOUL BY


*** Amazing Strips #4 - Manga-style cartoon combining a rock-n-roll band,
japanese spirits and ghosts, and lots of sex, at least to the degree that
is allowed in Japan (no pubic hair, explicit genitalia, and other strange
and inconsistent taboos).  Venus Comics.

*** Artistic Licentiousness #2, by Roberta Gregory - A look at the lives of
cartoonists, and the screwed up relationships they are into.  A lesbian who
had a fling with the male cartoonist living downstairs, which leads to all
kinds of misunderstandings and tensions between the lesbian couple, the guy,
and his gay friend.  Lots of interesting problems and questions were set up,
but not much was resolved, except for various bits of escapism into their
cartoons.  Comix Bitch.

*** Beavis and Butthead #6 - This summer issue has the boys at the water 
park from Hell.  Not a whole lot of action, though, and the usual banal 
banter is getting a bit worn-out.  The practical jokes page, things to do at 
the beach, is probably the best such section to date.  Marvel Comics.

**** Bondage Fairies #3 - More adult-fantasy manga, this one with fairies and
assorted creatures.  Very explicit and much, much hotter than Amazing Strips,
this one hasa lot of bondage, some s/m, and very steamy scenes.  In this one,
a captive fairy is tortured with drugs which make her horney.  Venus Comics

*** Carnal Comics #2 - The story of Sarah-Jane Hamilton, part 2 - Sarah
continues with her story of how she got into the porno business, including
getting into the LA scene, and her experiences in the "industry".  She likes
to make very high-class movies, and absolutely demands that she be in control-
and the result is quality.  Plus, her historical fantasies, and pictorials.
Extremely explicit, but no violence nor gore.  Revolutionary Comics.

**** Damnation, by J.R. Williams - collection of various strips and stories by
J.R. Williams, including the "Bad Boys", perverted sexual adventures, religious
caricatures aimed directly at the Religious Right,  plus the contents of an
early collaboration with Peter Bagge, "Eat Shit Or Die".  Lots of good stuff
here- don't miss the pure slack intro piece.  Fantagraphics Books.

***** Drama - The first real continuation of Cry For Dawn since the less-than-
friendly parting betwen Joseph Michael Linsner and Joe Monks.  This is a
radical departure from the regular CFD books- this one starts to delve directly
into the strange and often confusing metaphysical nature of Dawn herself.  She
is revealed to be the goddess of birth and rebirth, and is woven into a tale
with Ahura Mazda, Lucifer, Death, and an "everyman" character from New York.
Full color, with tons of the great pictures of Dawn and the other characters
that made this particular story line famous.  Sirius Entertainment Inc.

*** Duplex Planet Illustrated #8 - More stories from the rest home, this batch
was a bit more interesting than most.  Drawings by Dave Cooper, Wayno, Chan,
Pat Moriarty, George Parsons, and many more.  Good issue of this series, much
better than the average.  Fantagraphics Books.

**** Eightball #13 - A descent into societal and relational hopelessness
guided by Daniel Clowes.  He does a great one-page commentary using Peter
Bagge's characters Buddy Bradley, Lisa, and Stinkey, plus stories of hopeless
roommates, depressing critiques of possible relationships with different types
of girls, and another episode of "Ghost World", which is developing into a
continuous, coherent story instead of a single strip.  Fantagraphics Books. 

**** Flowers on the Razorwire - Two stories, plus the "Jesus Crispies" cartoon
by Mike Diana make up this twisted horror/gore comic; like all other Boneyard
Press books, this one doesn't pull any punches.  Vampire/cannibal British
troops attack a rebel revolutionary camp, slaughter and eat the patriots.  The
ultimate asshole macho guy, his hooker girlfriend and militant jesus freaks 
become pawns in a sick cosmic game when Jesus visits a band of demons.  Not
for the easily offended or sickened.  Boneyard Press.

**** Galaxias #2 - In a strange combination of Macross, H.R. Giger, and Mars 
Needs Women, this story is about a mutant race that is abducting humans 
in order to regenerate their mutated DNA, and the Transformer-like human 
space fleet doing battle with them.  Naturally, this involves massive 
orgies with weird aliens and each other, and everyone is naked.  There's 
a weird sexual shape to *everything*.  Very original, and not a bad story.
Rip Off Press.

*** Horny Biker Slut #8 - The biker slut rescues a pregnant girl from the
streets and lets her stay in the apartment with the roommates.  After a hot
and heavy session, they decide to get back at the creep who knocked her up and
left.  Plus, HBS strips by D.B. Velveeda, Scott Phillips, and others, very
similar to the way that different artists do their interpretations in Cherry's
Jubilee.  Extremely explicit cartoons.  Last Gasp Comics.

*** Infectious, by Kevin Eastman - Strange gory, tale of an apocalyptic, low-
life city.  When a hooker is killed, she is inhabited by an evil spirit/demon
which makes her immortal, and she goes on a killing spree with her customers.
A former lover, who recognizes her, manages to drive out the demon and lets
her die, but when he is killed, the demon continues in his body.  Fantaco.

*** The Iron Devil, by Frank Thorne - In probably one of the most explicit
comics yet seen from Frank Thorne, he recycles the Moonbeam girl; the plot
revolves around orgies with demons- a popular one these days.  Somewhat
confusing, but great artwork.  No gore, despite the genre.  Eros Comics.

*** Itchy & Scratchy #3 - When Scratchy quits the movies, a string of new
co-stars just isn't the same for Itchy.  So, Itchy sets out to sabotage all
of Scratchy's new jobs, and trick him into coming back to the studio.  Plus,
due to a strange energy field in the TV, Itchy and Scratchy come to real life,
and wreak havoc on the Simpson household, leaving Bart and Lisa to explain
the massive damage.  Bongo Comics.

*** Killjoy #0 - A couple of fairly short, but extremely violent and gory
tales of (nude, of course) demonic women who kill their lovers.  In the first,
an innocent and proper girl has terrifying dreams of becoming such a monster,
and is transformed by using her equally proper boyfriend.  In "Tiffany", such
a woman attracts the attention of an ancient and evil rival.  Produced in the
heart of Jesse Helms country by London Night Studios.


**** Lowlife #4 - Ed Brubaker's tales from the Slacker world continue.  In
this one, Tommy tries to deal with, and breaks up with, his girlfriend who
screws around on him.  Its a sad commentary on how the current generation is
trying to break out of the bullshit laid down for them by their parents, but
more often than not, history repeats itself.  Plus, tales of living on the
cheap, and a look at his friend Felix.  Does more to explain the angst and
feeling of "Generation X" than all the books combined.  AEON.

*** Naughty Bits #5 - In this comic by Roberta Gregory, one of her more
colorful characters, Bitchy Bitch, takes on men and the whole sexual harassment
issue.  She has to deal with a creep that she went out with once from a singles
ad, and now he works at the same place she does, and is bugging her.  I didn't
see it as much as a male-bashing issue, as much as dealing with assholes and
creeps of either gender, as well as other problems.  Fantagraphics Books.

*** Negative Burn #11 - Cover by Moebius.  Great stories in this one: "We Can
Get It for you Wholesale", plus another episode of the Twilight People.  Plus,
more Classics Desecrated, one of them by Matt Feazell, creator of the Cynical
Man mini-comics.  Also, Mr. Mamoulian, sketchbooks, and more.  Caliber Press.  

*** Ren & Stimpy #21 - Stimpy decides to act like a real cat, instead of
walking upright and living in a house.  Plus, Ren becomes paranoid that a
piece of space junk from Skylab will fall on him and kill him.  The stories
were almost good enough for a regular episode.  Too many ads.  Marvel Comics.

*** The Tick: Karma Tornado #4 - While flying around the universe doing travel
reports for the Nigh-Omnipotus, Tick learns that his boss is actually a
genocidal monster who eats planets.  After confronting him, the Tick is left
on his own planet, and Nigh-Omnipotus destroys himself.  New England Comics.

**** Zap Comix #13 - New comics by Richard Crumb, S. Clay Wilson, Gilbert
Shelton, Robert Williams, and more.  Crumb does a brief autobiography, which
sheds a lot of light on his work. Other strips are a mix of the wild counter-
cultural themes and outrageous artwork.  Last Gasp.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:



                   Deadly Beer Can Conspiracy
                   --------------------------

Subliminal persuasion through backwards masking is a technique through
which a subliminal message (a message which imprints itself directly on
the subconcious mind) is planted, usually in music.  When played backwards,
the message is revealed.

On the side of every beer can is the warning: "According To The
Surgeon General, Women Should Not Drink Alcoholic Beverages During
Pregnancy Because Of The Risk Of Birth Defects." But did you know that
it contains a subliminal message?

Using high-tech computer equipment, a friend and I recorded the warning. We
then played it backwards. To our suprise we found a hidden message: "Michigan".

What could be the signifigance of this message?

Budweiser beer is made with rice, like saki, instead of barley like good
American beers.  We believe that this is all part of a plot by Japanese
corporations to destroy the American automobile industry, which is based in
Michigan.  Through the "Don't drink and drive" campaign, a subliminal
connection between beer and cars was formed in the consiousness of the
American people.  Then, by subverting our beer, the Japanese could also
crush our automobile industry!

What can you do?

Write to the FBI and CIA and demand they investigate this matter further.
Also write to the Pentagon and demand military strikes against Japan.

Remember Pearl Harbor!

               Sacrifices to the New World Order PO Box:


Juggling with Slack - The Church of the Great Juggle shows us how the Path to
Slack is very similar to juggling, and has a detailed and illustrated pamphlet
teaching you precisely how to juggle nearly anything.  Send for yours today;
no price listed, but $1 or so wouldn't hurt.   Church of the Great Juggle,
2002-A Guadalupe #623, Austin, TX  78705

Strange, But True News - This zine is precisely as the title implies, real
news stories that actually happened, and as usual, truth is much stranger than
fiction.  Fun little things that your next-door neighbors JUST MIGHT be doing
include: sleeping with the dead, gouging out eyeballs to exorcise demons, 
commercially endorsing Tonya Harding (TONYA!!!), playing with human skulls, or
fooling the public with ClintonSpeak. Its funny how much stupidity and strange-
ness come directly from the boys in blue.  This is a great barometer to gauge
the amount of weirdness and insanity in the world, and there's no shortage.
1 year (12 issues) is only $13 and $2 for a sample copy- mention you read this
in HToMC and get it for $1.  SEND HIM YOUR WEIRD NEWS CLIPPING!!!!

   Here's the address which was stolen by space goblins from the last issue:
   SBTN   7522 Campbell Road, Suite 113, Room 162, Dallas, TX  75248


Riverside Art Scene - A strange mixture of sick humor, warped cultural icons,
conspiracies, regurgitated and warped nightmares from Catholic school, and
countless other demented topics, plus reviews.  Not a square millimeter is
wasted, with more artwork, collages, drawings, and assorted strangeness than
publications ten times the size- lots of good stuff in a small package, that
takes a while to absorb completely.  Highly recommended.  They not only trade
zines, but weird and underground videos as well, and have their own local
cable access TV show.  No price listed, but send a trade or a buck or so to:
Ski-Mask, Riverside Art Scene, PO Box 638, Kenmore, NY  14217

Xenon vol. 1 issue 3 - Not exactly a riot grrrl zine, this one obviously
shows things from a girls point of view, although they do touch on some other
topics.  They also have lots of recipes- the ones for Beer Bread sounds
pretty good, and the others made me hungry.  Send a stamp and a quarter, or at
least a couple of stamps, to: Monet, 161 Via de Laurencio, Chula Vista CA 91910

Sniper's Nest #1 - From the fringes of the conspiracy watchers to anything
interesting, this is a collection of hard-hitting "bullets" into the heart of
the conspiracy.  I particularly liked the one questioning the need for
militarism as a government policy, though I have to admit that I reserve some
doubts on some of the other articles which paint business and "property" as
evils.  Nevertheless, the varied mix makes for interesting reading.  Send a
trade, or 3 stamps, or $1 to: CN c/o Trevor Rigler, PO Box 2351,
Galveston TX  77553-2351

Snuff It - The Quarterly Journal of the Church of Euthanasia - Its hard not to
like an organization whose pillars are suicide, abortion, cannibalism, and
sodomy.  What do those have in common?  They are means of lowering the
population.  There's some good points here; there is also a healthy dose of
urban guerilla warfare in what they self-describe as Dada in action: they have
great "Save the Earth - Kill Yourself" bumper stickers, and have wreaked havoc
on the "normal" environmentalist/animal rights/etc crowds by infiltrating their
marches.  Lots of fun here.  Get 6 issues of Snuff It for $10, or join the
church for $20 and get a lifetime subscription.  They have strange music,
T-shirts and other goodies. Kevorkian Records, PO Box 261, Somerville, MA 02143

Spare R.I.B.S. #7 - Thick zine full of absorbing articles on individualism,
freedom, and blasting censorship, the war on drugs, and other government
actions more fitting a dictatorship than a free nation.  Tons of intellectual
ammunition, including parts of John Galt's speech.  Not just armchair debate,
this touches on real-life entanglements and battles against the bureaucracy.
Plus reviews, poetry, and artwork. Try to send something, at least $1 to:
David Kennerly, 2329 Glascock St.  Raleigh, NC  27610

Eat or Die #4 - Wild strangeness, with tons of discordant images, text; most
pages are surreal artwork collages.  Also has lots of cartoons- it continues
the "Birdie" the cat story, plus the tale of the museum murders.  Twenty-
some-odd pages of weirdness for only $2 to P. Santo, 230 Avenue B, Apartment 4,
Bayonne, NJ  07002   [and thanks for the mini-comic!]

Prometheus Books - Summer 1994 catalog - Tons of great books, from debunkers
and skeptics, to secular humanists, Jack Kevorkian, to books on just about
every social issue imagineable.  Considerable effort is put forth to counter
any and all nonsense, regardless of the source, and there are few sources more
complete than this.  (800) 421-0351  59 John Glenn Dr. Amherst, NY 14228-2197

Probosco #1 - Very strange and unusual comics, where the "characters" look
like vertical pipes, with a nose pipe going horizontally.  They do all sorts
of absurd things to and with each other,  Lots of fun, and completely original.

FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  TECHNO-THWARTING THE STATE

                   by Chuck Hammill

 Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987
     Public Domain:  Duplicate and Distribute Freely


      You  know,  technology-- and   particularly   computer
technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-
cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's
Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's
slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-
phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on
his "enemies list."  Or, we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-
longings if it beeps.

     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there
were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.
Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.

     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-
ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors
the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-
not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new(  over  the sluggish (who cling to time-
tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-
scribe government bureaucracy than "dull" and "sluggish"?

     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable
crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if
that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike
the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the
arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-
get.)

     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was
plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another, but against their governmental
masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-
piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the
medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and
Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-
tively, for its unlawful possession.

     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45
called "the equalizer."  A frail dance-hall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  "a  man  on
horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be
captured."  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a
true one.

     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher
(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-
alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or
skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-
puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY
X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-
cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.
Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-
formation transfer.

     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-
ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is
called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman
who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact
that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    "Ex-
tremely"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100
digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence.

     The  "public" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-
tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *
(q-1) + 1}.  The "private" part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y.

     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple
A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer
is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y
(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with.

     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why
it  is  called  "public-key"  cryptography,"  is  that I can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while
keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message, namely
                     x
                   a    (mod pq)  ,
but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking
what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher
keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-
change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y  .

     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a "dig-
ital signature," to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,
I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod
your pq)  and send that.

    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my
pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and
send this, then even after you have normally "decrypted" the
message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you
then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result
(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-
ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I
could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret
y  ).

     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-
day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of
personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that
American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in
fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the
Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal
computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of
text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this
weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-
cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-
sively than machine guns are in the United States.)

     Now  the  "conservative" position is that we should not
sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use
them  in weapons systems.  The "liberal" position is that we
should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there
will certainly be some other nation willing to.

     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian
position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and
if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't
work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-
scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-
ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we
are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a "straight line."    Taking  a  long  enough
world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of
the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at Moscow.

     But  there's  the rub:  A "long enough" world view does
suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will "get what they deserve," but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.

    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-
tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,
functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have
patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  "feed  the  poor"
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase
was called the "moral equivalent of war" and the Feds  swung
into  action.    For the first time in American history, the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-
came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of
oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-
can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that
government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has
lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,
what  can we call this except the "moral equivalent of civil
war--the government against its own people?"

     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?

     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  "black  hole"  effect in the evolution of
nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so-called "welfare" payments.  When those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those
whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go
down to the nearest "welfare" office, find just  two  people
on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.

     So essentially those who love liberty need an "edge" of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  "other-directedness"  of
"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world."
Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.
If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
"cause," caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like, "Listen, follow me as I enunciate my
noble "cause," contribute your money to support the "cause,"
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the "cause," strive
selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your
children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-
ally  live under egoism"--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And
of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,
when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it
profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only
then.

     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-
tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even
necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the
investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally.

     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to
the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-
ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,
and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I
shall therefore repeat it now:

     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him
for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him
for a lifetime.

     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  "workfare"  vs.  "welfare"  context;  namely, that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.
And of course this is true, if only because the next time he
is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how
to fish, he is completely self sufficient.

     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it
again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist
slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter.

     But consider:

     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and
they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a "winner" and a "loser;" the
idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the
"expense" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this
scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-
thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-
ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information
(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum
game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  "law  of
diminishing   returns,"   the  "first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamics"--all those "laws" which constrain our possi-
bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's
anarchy!

     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry
Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he
tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and
even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing
adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property, and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-
ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-
ously extends to competent adults the "benefits" it provides
to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,
all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally "naughty."  But, in  any
case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of "pos-
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute."

     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-
ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be "altruistic"  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or
"egoistic" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-
haps even other motives.)

     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your "cause," you're not about to mount a military campaign,
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.
However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-
formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold.    I say "literally," because for a fraction of
the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a
hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-
geted government, like present-day America, at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-
stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as
increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others
re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-
eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-
cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  "Freedom  in  an
Unfree World" that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-
sion is necessary to its fulfilment.

     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,
Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .
Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and
Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-
vasive, and not nearly so bloody.

     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech
Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-
slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves.

     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at
present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-
ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-
ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.
This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but
it does indicate how government thinks.

     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed
pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone
who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the "underground
railroad" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as
the sovereign government of the United States of America  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-
larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,
alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his "crime"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this
drug.

     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-
conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . "Let me make one thing
perfectly clear:"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,
participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no
matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-
tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological
processes,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-
censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-
self.

     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair,  thinking,  "Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of
this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian
before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery"--recognize
that  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-
self free.

     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,
you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake
name  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the
mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-
addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you
should have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to
plug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.
Even if you want to be the proverbial "free rider" and  just
benefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:
Everything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can
get  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to
give it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly
willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-
ture.

     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too.

Excerpts from Robert Wayne Pelton's Loony Sex Laws that You Never Knew You
Were Breaking (Walker and Company):

In the quiet town of Connorsville, Wisconsin, it's illegal for a man to
shoot off a gun when his female partner has an orgasm.

It's against the law in Willowdale, Oregon, for a husband to curse during
sex.

In Oblong, Illinois, it's punishable by law to make love while hunting or
fishing on your wedding day.

No man is allowed to make love to his wife with the smell of garlic, onions,
or sardines on his breath in Alexandria, Minnesota.  If his wife so 
requests,
law mandates that he must brush his teeth.

Warn your hubby that after lovemaking in Ames, Iowa, he isn't allowed to
take more than three gulps of beer while lying in bed with you- or holding
you in his arms.

Bozeman, Montana, has a law that bans all sexual activity between members of
the opposite sex in the front yard of a home after sundown- if they're nude.
(Apparently, if you wear socks, you're safe from the law!)

In hotels in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, every room is required to have twin
beds.  And the beds must always be a minimum of two feet apart when a couple
rents a room for only one night.  And it's illegal to make love on the floor
between the beds!

The owner of every hotel in Hastings, Nebraska, is required to provide each
guest with a clean and pressed nightshirt.  No couple, even if they are
married, may sleep together in the nude.  Nor may they have sex unless they
are wearing one of these clean, white cotton nightshirts.

An ordinance in Newcastle, Wyoming, specifically bans couples from having
sex while standing inside a store's walk-in-meat freezer!

A state law in Illinois mandates that all bachelors should be called master,
not mister, when addressed by their female counterparts.

In Norfolk, Virginia, a woman can't go out without wearing a corset.  (There
was a civil-service job- for men only- called a corset inspector.

However, in Merryville, Missouri, women are prohibited from wearing corsets
because "the privilege of admiring the curvaceous, unencumbered body of a
young woman should not be denied to the normal, red-blooded American male."

It's safe to make love while parked in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  Police 
officers
aren't allowed to walk up and knock on the window.  Any suspicious officer
who thinks that sex is taking place must drive up from behind, honk his horn
three times and wait approximately two minutes before getting out of his car
to investigate.

Another law in Helena, Montana, mandates that a woman can't dance on a table
in a saloon or bar unless she has on at least three pounds, two ounces of
clothing.

Lovers in Liberty Corner, New Jersey, should avoid satisfying their lustful
urges in a parked car.  If the horn accidentally sounds while they are
frolicking behind the wheel, the couple can face a jail term.

In Carlsbad, New Mexico, it's legal for couples to have sex in a parked
vehicle during their lunch break from work, as long as the car or van has
drawn curtains to stop strangers from peeking in.

A Florida sex law:  If you're a single, divorced, or widowed woman, you
can't parachute on Sunday afternoons.

Women aren't allowed to wear patent-leather shoes in Cleveland, Ohio- a man
might see the reflection of something "he oughtn't!"

No woman may have sex with a man while riding in an ambulance within the
boundaries of Tremonton, Utah.  If caught, the woman can be charged with a
sexual misdemeanor and "her name is to be published in the local newspaper."
The man isn't charged nor is his name revealed.
