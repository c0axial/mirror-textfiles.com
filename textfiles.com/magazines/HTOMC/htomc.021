 12-15.  The event was World Youth and S/M Day, with 200,000 people attending
 the big "Pope-stock" event on Sunday.  An estimated 20,000 people required
              emergency medical services as they were
              sunburned, heat-exhausted, stung, broken
                ankles from gopher holes, hypothermia
                at night, fatigue from the all-night

                  PLUS hour-plus long waits for the

                 Jim Morrison: Space Ranger part 3

               by  T. Rev  <hin9@midway.uchicago.edu>


   "Is this Los Angeles?  I'd like the number of Robert Krieger.  
Yes, I'll hold."  It was a gamble, assuming Robbie still lived in 
LA, albeit not much of one.  "It's unlisted, you say.  Well, thanks 
anyway.  Peace."
   So Robbie was still in LA.  He could go there, with the money he 
had.  But there were probably too many people who would recognize 
him there.  Once again, Morrison reviewed his condition.  Whatever 
he'd been through, it hadn't all been hallucination.  The money he 
was living off of, and the police report he'd gotten his hands on--
detailing the investigation of the murder of one Jeremiah Cornelius 
aka Jeremiah Cornell aka Cornelius Brunner--were proof of that.  The 
report was interesting in its brevity; the Philadelphia police had 
been taken off the case, forced off by the FBI and Interpol.  Bob 
had referred to an 'archetype', apparently meaning Jerry.  Maybe 
Jerry was the key.  Or had been, at least; maybe now that he was 
gone, Morrison could go on the offensive.  If only he could identify 
a target.
   It had been a long time since Morrison felt this way.  Maybe not 
since the early days, playing at the Whisky-a-Go-Go, drinking all 
day, dropping acid at night.  He felt in control of his life again, 
for Heaven or Hell, it was his life, and nobody  was pulling his 
strings again.
   The door to Morrison's suite opened.
   "Hey, man."  It was Hendrix.  He was wearing a white suit, with a 
straw hat perched on his shaven head.

   Quietly cursing the agents responsible for the latest of a string 
of unjustifiable coincidences, Morrison resolved to take this one in 
good grace.
   "Jimi!"  Morrison jumped to his feet.  "Good to see you.  I've 
been looking for you."
   "I've been looking for you, man."  Jimi looked around the hotel 
room.  "You've been a lot louder than me."
   "Were you...?"
   "At the warehouse?  Yeah, I think so.  I'm a little blank on what 
happened, you know?  They did something to my head."  Hendrix pulled 
off his hat.  His scalp was marred with old, healed scars, and new 
stitches.  Morrison shuddered.
   "I pulled out all the wires I could get at, then I went to see a 
doctor.  He finished the job.  I'm feeling a lot better now."
   Jimi sat down on a couch and stretched out.  "So what do we do 
now?"
   "Not sure.  I've been thinking about calling Robbie Krieger.  Did 
you see Jerry?"
   "No, uh, when?"
   "Just at the warehouse."
   "No.  Don't remember it, man."
   "Here.  Read this."  Morrison tossed him the file on Cornelius.
   Hendrix read it.  "Shit."
   "I found him first.  That's where I got the money from."
   "Don't, like, waste any time, do you?"
   "Didn't have many choices.  What I really want to do is track 
down this Bob guy's operations and waste them.  Make sure he doesn't 
come back and do this to us again."
   "He did save your life, man."
   "For what?  He wanted to make a slave of me.  I say he gets it in 
the neck."
   Jimi stroked his temples thoughtfully.  "Yeah, okay.  Count me 
in, man."
   Morrison smiled.  "I thought you'd agree."
   Jimi sat in silence for a few seconds.  "Still don't explain what 
we're going to do."
   Morrison's face fell.  "True.  Well, money won't be a problem for 
at least a few more days.  I want to follow two leads.  I want to 
find out who this Bob is, and where his operations are centered.  
That's going to be a bitch.  I also want to know who the hell 'Jerry 
Cornelius' really is."
   "Just some dead guy."
   "Bullshit, Jimi.  He was important to Bob in some way we don't 
understand yet, and maybe can't understand at all.  But we just 
don't have the information either way."
   "So?"
   "So we start finding it."  Morrison stood up and started to pace.
   "Interpol is probably too hard to crack.  Same for the FBI."
   Morrison thought.  "Jimi, where did they grab you from?  Bob's 
people."
   "London.  And I wasn't grabbed, exactly.  I signed up, man."
   "Excuse me?  You signed up?"
   "Yeah, well, I was so bummed, you know, and..."
   "Don't tell me.  You were tired of your life, you felt you needed 
to feel something real, they said they could supply it."
   "Yeah."
   Morrison chuckled.  "Always the same story, isn't it?  They 
always say they have what you need, and the price comes low."  He 
turned toward the windows, overlooking the city.  An explosion lit 
up the sky, out towards the projects.  Morrison ignored it.  "If you 
count souls as cheap, that is."
   Hendrix started to speak.  Morrison cut him off.  "Who got you 
in?"
   "An old roadie of mine.  Lemmy Kilmister."
   Morrison smiled again.  "The hell with Jerry.  We find Mr. 
Kilmister."


   They sent out for music industry papers from the last twenty 
years, and found the information they needed.  Lemmy had gone from 
being one of Hendrix's roadies, to part-time procurer to the stars, 
to bassist for a group called Hawkwind, to fronting his own band, 
Motorhead.
   "Yeah, I'd like to leave a message for Lemmy.  Tell him Jimi H. 
is back in town, have him meet me at the old house in three days.  
Yeah, he knows where.  Thanks."
   Hendrix put the phone down.  "Okay.  That should get him, man."
   "The old house?"
   "Neutral territory.  House has been there since the sixteenth 
century.  Lemmy used to do all his deals there, you know?"
   "Where?"
   "London, where else?"


   Three days later, they were in Ladbroke Grove, waiting in the 
foyer of a shabby cottage squeezed between two scarcely more 
pleasant cinderblock council flats.
   Morrison shifted in his seat uncomfortably.  "Sure he'll show?"
   Hendrix nodded calmly for the fifth time in two hours.
   Morrison stood up and walked to the hearth.  In the weak sunlight 
from two dirty windows, he could make out the anonymous scratchings 
of decades of graffiti smothered uneasily beneath a new coat of 
thick black paint.  The light shifted, and Morrison turned to see a 
shape walk past the window.  Lemmy.
   The cottage door opened, and in he walked.  He was tall, rail-
thin, and as ugly as if he'd just been found underneath a rock.  He 
wore his hair long and stringy; a Gengis Khan moustache narrowly 
missed a huge mole on his cheek.  His eyes were concealed behind 
mirrorshades.  He ignored, or didn't notice, Morrison.
   "Jimi," he stated in a gravelly baritone.  "How was your trip?" 
he continued, without apparent interest.
   "We've seen better," Morrison replied, stepping from behind the 
hearth.
   Lemmy looked from one to the other, surprised.  "You mean, they 
put you on the same bus?  Oh, Jesus.  Fucking incredible."  And he 
started to laugh.
   "Enough jokes, fuckhead," grated Morrison.  "I need information, 
and I've been through enough shit to turn your hair white and burn 
the grease off it.  Do you want to talk or do I put some fist sized 
holes in that pretty leather pajama top of yours?"
   Lemmy stopped cold.  Then, slowly, he straightened up.  "So 
what's the deal?" he said, again to Jimi.
   Jimi blinked, then, slowly, he outlined what had happened to him 
and Morrison, and how.
   "What do you want from me, then?"
   "We want to know where Bob's organization is," said Morrison.  
"You're our last link to them.  We want you to take us to them, so 
we can trash them."
   Lemmy pulled out a pack of Marlboros, took one, lit it, put the 
pack away.  He still hadn't removed the mirrorshades.  "Right.  I 
can do it.  It'll cost."
   "How much?"
   "Five mil UK.  This is a big one, mate."
   "Haven't got it.  Let's go, Jimi."
   "Now, wait a minute.  Eh...did you lot have anything to do with 
Jerry Cornelius washing up dead in the States last week?"
   Morrison sighed, and reached down to his ankle.  "Does this 
answer your question?" he asked, producing Jerry's air pistol.
   Lemmy stared in silence for a moment.  "Right.  I'll do it for 
that.  For the needle gun."
   Morrison was surprised.  "Why for this?"
   Lemmy shook his head and chuckled.  "Old times' sake, mate.  Old 
times' sake."


   Eighteen hours later, they were in Los Angeles.  Bob's 
organization, as it turned out, was based in Colombia now.  It would 
not be easy to get there--and harder to get out.
   "I'll take you up to the last five miles," Lemmy was saying.  
"You're on your own after that."
   "Fine with us, man.  All I need is one clear shot at Bob."
   Morrison had used the past few days to experiment with the gun 
he'd been given on the Luck Plane.  Hendrix gave it to him then, but 
claimed not to remember doing so.  A lot of his memories had gone 
with the circuitry.  So Morrison practiced alone.  The gun was all 
blue-white crystal, with small chrome plates spaced irregularly on 
the barrel, and shot through with green wire; a ruby red button at 
the base of the barrel was the trigger, next to a unmarked dial of 
no apparent purpose.  It was a particle beam weapon of some sort; 
inert targets shattered in its sights and living ones, what was left 
of them, blackened and crumbled within minutes.  Quite an effect for 
something that  looked like an Uzi crafted by Waterford.
   "He'll be paste."
   Lemmy favored Morrison with a glance over his mirrorshades.  "If 
you say so."
   They left Los Angeles the next day, heading for Bogota on a small 
chartered airplane, piloted by a Jamaican in dreadlocks.  He never 
spoke, though he looked around in surprise every time they mentioned 
Bob.  The plane was met at the airfield by a Jeep; after a quick 
conference, Lemmy sent the driver away with a small satchel, and 
took the wheel himself.  "I'm handling this as quietly as I can, 
guys--I can't risk this coming back to haunt me.  Get in and let's 
go."
   They left Bogota and within half an hour were headed through 
thick jungle into the mountains.  Just like Vietnam, Morrison 
thought.  In another hour, even the bumpy dirt trail ended.
   "The coke manufacturers don't like to come around here.  Too 
risky.  It's got to be on foot for the last twenty kilometers."  
Lemmy leered.  "If a couple of dead guys are up to it."
   "Better than you, motorhead.  Let's do it."

          ...stay tuned for the last thrilling episode.....

SPOT GOES TO SCHENECTADY
========================
With a sigh of relief, Spot ascended from Hell.  Then he discovered he
was in Schenectady.  He whined liquidly, like a leaky balloon in a
bathtub of Vaseline.
    "Hey, little puppy, swell metaphor!" said a passing man.  He was Mr.
Spudkins, a Remedial English I teacher at Schenectady County Community
College.  "Or was it a simile maybe?  Me can't remember.  What kind are
the sort what has the `like' in it?"
    Spot ignored the pseudo-professor, who was soon sucked into oblivion
by a passing street-sweeper.  It was a combination Hoover and Zamboni
which was cleaning up the broken glass that littered the streets, as
last week had been the Mardi Gras parade, and the General Electric
employees had been throwing light bulbs.  Spot liked General Electric,
because their TV sets made every show look gray and blurry and flickery,
just like "The Honeymooners", his favorite.
    With a start, Spot realized that something was missing from
Schenectady.  The Wonder Burger, the world's worst eating establishment
(certified), had become a used car dealership!  Spot wept for his
favorite anti-restaurant.  Their hamburgers had tasted just like Alpo,
only mushier!
    Spot finished exploring downtown Schenectady five minutes later.
Then he was bored for the rest of his life.  When he died, he went back
to Hell, and breathed a sigh of eternal relief.

AUTHOR'S NOTE:  By now, anyone from Schenectady, NY has noticed the
fatal flaw in the story--it does not even mention that if Spot had gone
down the road to Troy, NY, he would have seen that it was much worse,
and made Schenectady look like Heaven by comparison.  So it goes.
