 NEWS since the last time:

  Congrats go out to HOWARD STERN for his New Year's Eve show.  Besides being
 one of the most vulgar, gross, and crude presentations ever on tv, it
 also MADE MORE MONEY THAN ANY PAY-PER-VIEW SPECIAL IN HISTORY!!!  Prudish
 critics can stick that straight up their asses and twist on it.  Just for
 this, Howard is very high on the list of suggested Short Duration Personal
 Saviors for 1994.  He should be on TV every day.  Where else can you see
 naked lesbians pouring maggots down their throats?

A SubGenius Story

By Derek Milhous Zumsteg
<milhous@u.washington.edu>

  With Bob gone, things were better for those of us that worked in
Puzzling Evidence- more conspiracies meant more work, more overtime and
more personnel, which helped us create more conspiracy and puzzling
evidence. Wheels within wheels within wheels. 
  Puzzling Evidence had been turned into a shell, as was popularly
believed, but this was only one of Stang's little inspirations- while the
Langely fools hunted in vain for Bob's death commandoes, the "Fingers of
Death," operating somewhere in Texas, the real Puzzling Evidence had
reemerged, rebuilt, stronger than ever, with the most important mission we
could ever be given-
  The Ressurection. 
  The Bob we offered initially as the "Re-Erected Bob" was, in fact,
nothing more than a zombie, using technology that would later net us all
fortunes when we invented the FunDroids line of robots. But back then, in
the dark ages of Republican Attorney Generals, we had to come up with a
stop gap measure to hold together the troops until the truth could emerge.
 But while too many SubGenius regulars commented that he kept telling the
same jokes and seemed strangely out of it, no one caught on, mostly
because Bob had done the same thing alive. At the same time, the work on a
real, authentic Bob continued in secret inside Tucson, Arizona. 
  Twelve levels below a inconspicuous travel agency where we took our rare
breaks by booking redneck couples on honeymoons on the African Sahara,
Bob's shattered form had lain, supported by the best medical equipment we
could buy, steal, build and find on the highway median. Hit by !M%
bullets, fired by at least (#X%) gunmen, the best medical personnel in the
world had saved what they could and stabilized the corpse's deterioration.
The Re-Erected Bob had been let loose on the world, but our work had only
begun. 
  The complex was filled with Cray supercomputers, geneticists and scrawny
college computer engineers, working non-stop to clone enough new tissue to
allow reconstruction and eventually cloning of True Bobs on the brink of
X-day, when the world would need him most. 
  But Bob's DNA was far too hard to reconstruct, having structures beyond
our comprehension- I heard one tech muttering "triple eyes, triple helix". 
  We were forced to construct the tissue from scratch, attempting to
rebuild what we hoped could serve as a stop-gap until Bob's incredible
slack, contained even in shadows of his DNA and that which aspired to copy
it, would slowly allow us to make discoveries that, in turn, would help us
in our quest to better copies of the fragments we held on to. 
  While the Yetis had been more than cooperative, the human side had
proved much more difficult. So far, besides various slightly decomposed
corpses, I'd seen the likes of David Byrne, Noam Chomsky, Timothy Leary
(there was some fucked-up DNA), Mike Horovitz, Stanley Kubrick, Will Clark
and Long Dong Silver. 
  I'd already killed twice, in Utah, when a Mormon field trip stumbled
onto our trap to catch John Cleese skiing. 
  This was just my summer job. 
  But when, on a 110-degree July day, G. Gordon Gordon called me from
corporate, I knew it had all been nothing. 
  "Is this Joseph Conrad Miller?" he asked, in gruff tones. 
  "It is," I replied, "at your service."
  "Yeah, yeah," he said. "The techs tell me it's almost all ready to go,
that right?"
  I had heard rumors. "Certainly is," I lied with pride. 
  "I've got the report in front of me, Joe, don't bullshit around. 'While
the DNA cloning is now within reach, computer simulations indicate that
while Bob-2 would be brilliant in every sense of the word, retain his
humor and be incredibly well-endowed, he would lack the total and plain
ignorance that allows him to manipulate the Luck Plane with such
adeptness.' What's that mean to you, Joe?"
  I hesitated. "We need to clone a real idiot."
  "Not a real idiot," Gordon said. "A real Fool. Don't fail us on this
one." And he hung up. 
  "Yessir, rightawaysir, Iunderstandsir," I said to the dial tone. "He
will? Thank you very much, sir. Yessir."
  I turned to the informal supervisor of my section. "Gordon says you're
to issue me and my guys two weeks of paid vacation time and your best
drugs after this mission. We have to go sample a true Fool."
  He arched an eyebrow and nodded, his Frop-fried eyes hazy and distant.
"Yeah, yeah, I'll do that," he said. 
  My little four-man (and woman) team sat around our own round table,
trying to plan our next mission. But before the planning, we had to figure
out what exactly we were after. 
  "I vote for fratboys," Hardy said, smiling her white smile. "Fratboys
are the ultimate fools."
  "No, no," Teller, our tech, replied, his Beta-Omega-Beta tatoo probably
burning white under his T-shirt. "BOB is a good frat."
  "Present company excepted," Hardy said. 
  "I think fratboys are idiots, not fools," Paul said. "I think we need to
find someone who, despite all the evidence available to them, holds to
ridiculous ideas and makes fun of those who do not, picking on physical
flaws and appearances."
  There were general sounds of agreement around the table. 
  "Sounds like you've got someone in mind," I said. 
  "Someone who loves his own image almost as much as Bob enjoys his own."
  "Are there any? I personally saw Bob ask a Kinko's to make a full
million copies of his mimeographed head he could air-drop on Guadalahara,"
Hardy said. 
  "Yeah, there is," Paul said, smiling. "Who prints books with his head on
them, millions of them, who must always have his face somewhere on camera,
who uses stacks of his book as background for a television show."
  "I'll be Dobbs," Teller muttered. "That should take of the vanity genes,
too."
  "No, he's fat," Paul replied. 
  "But is he a Fool?" I asked, finally. 
  "He is a total Fool," Paul said. 
  We didn't fit in well with the rest of the television audience, who were
in ill-fitting suits and dresses, white and scared of being in the part of
town where shows got taped. Four relaxed, multi-ethnic college kids
wearing Armeni suits and electric Dobbs ties didn't fit in well, but we
got past the guard easy enough. 
  Before we could move, however, we had to sit through the show itself. 
  If you have watched Rush Limbaugh, if you have heard Rush Limbaugh, if
you have heard rumors, you can begin to understand what we went through. 
  The studio, filled with refugees straight from the 1980s and political
philosophy from the Paleozoic, was humid and oppressive. 
  Overall, there was a smell of pork. 
  Our plan, orignally, was to wait until the first commercial break and
leave, taking a wrong turn on the way to the bathrooms and lying in wait
for the big man himself. 
  It didn't work that well. Immediately after his first bit, ridiculing
various women in business and their tailors, he turned to the audience and
spotted Vasquez. 
  He smiled at her. During the commercial break, he walked over. 
  "Nice to see a Latino woman here," he said. "Don't see many minorities
with us. Maybe you'd like to come by after the show and talk about it?"
  She hesitated, the loyalty to work and self wrestling for dominance.
Self won in two quick falls. 
  "Maybe you'd like me to split you from your ass to your appetite?" she
said, smiling sweetly. 
  "Guards!" he yelled, clapping, suddenly not so confident and not so
cool. 
  "Rock and roll," Vasquez yelled, pulling her heat at point-blank range
and aiming at Rush's impossibly shiny shoes. "Dance, fat boy!" she
sneered, and stared to fire at alternate feet. 
  The guards rushed us, pulling their own rods. Before we could react,
though, they were trampled to death by the frightened herds of Pinks.
Vasquez ran out of ammo and fun as the last trophy wife clicked out of the
room on high-heels. 
  "Time to go for a ride, Rush," Vasquez said, hustling him out the back,
and smiled the most evil and sadistic smile I have ever witnessed in my
life. 
  We kept him tied to a chair, with a bare lightbulb above him, suit
intact, in a abandoned room in a low-income housing project. 
  "What do you people want?" he asked us, sneering. "Money? I've got it.
Cars? No problem. What're you after?"
  "We'll have none of your False Slack," I said. His face widened. 
  "You're SubGenius!" he exclaimed, and then caught himself. 
  "Oh, you know of us?" Paul asked him from behind. "Maybe you know too
much."
  The fat man's brow was begining to shine with beaded sweat ever so
slightly. 
  "What do you know about us," I sneered back at him. "Or, rather, what do
you think you know?"
  "You worship some Bob guy and don't make much sense," he said, too
quickly. 
  "He's lying," Hardy said from the wall she leans against. 
  "Lemme rip his balls off," Vasquez pleaded from the corner. 
  "What else are you involved with, Rush?" I asked, very slowly. 
  "My work is my life," he said. "That's all I'm involved with."
  "What about that blonde kid you're seeing," Paul asks innocently.
"You're not involved with him?"
  His sweaty face went suddenly and totally sheet-white. 
  "What? WHAT?" he screamed, figiting violently, threating to knock the
chair over. "Lies! Lies! Lies spread by my enemies!"
  "Tell us about what else you do, Rush," Paul said. "Or 'Michael' might
have an unfortunate accident."
  "Yeah!" Vasquez said with obvious enthusiasm. "I'd like that."
  "Idon'tknowanythingItellyounothing oh god oh god oh god oh god I don't
know anything about the remote controlled guns or the SWAT team or the
Navajo Indians behind the curtain I was out of the loop it wasn't me Bill
Casey told me to do it what could I do he had my file and then I found out
Michael was CIA and what was I going to do I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL BOB!!!"
he screamed, and broke down, sobbing. 
  "It's all right," Paul said, putting his hand on Rush's shoulder. 
  "No, no it's not," he sobbed. "Bob was always so much more popular than
me... he taught me that political philosophy was just another sales pitch.
How could I betray that after the success I've had? Oh god oh god oh
god..."
  "I say we kill him," Vasquez muttered, fingering her BobBlade (tm). 
  "Shhhhh.." we said. 
  "oh god, oh god," he sobbed endlessly, and we left him there. 
  When we returned, he was asleep. 
  "He looks like a little angel," Hardy said, sarcasm dripping off her
lips. 
  "Ugh," I said, walking around to the back of the chair. 
  With unexpected savagry, I pounded the syringe straight into his
posterior. He awoke with a howl, and I began to draw, as slowly as I could
manage, a liberal sample. 
  There was a far-off bang and a clatter of boots. 
  "The Con!" Vasquez yelled from the hall over the screaming. "Let's go!"
  I pulled the syringe out, dropped the needle in his lap as a momento and
dashed into the hallway. 
  From the far left, a door crashed down and black vest-clad cops poured
in, two-abreast, yelling "Stop! Search Warrant!". We turned as one,
sprinting away. Far ahead, a door disintegrated and trenchcoat-wearing
G-men flooded the hall. "Freeze!" they yelled at once. "Federal Agents."
  We stopped. 
  "Well, this is it," Vasquez said, reaching for her gun. 
  "Don't," Paul said, knocking on the door he was leaning on. 
  "Who is it?" came the distant voice. 
  "Uhhh... Avon calling!" Paul said, inspired. 
  "Just a second." Feet shuffled. To our sides, the Con was creeping in on
us."
  A latch opened, and a crack of light appeared. Hardy gave her best
smile. 
  The door opened. We ran in, almost knocking the wind out of the poor
woman, and closing the door behind us. 
  I peeled five twenties off my roll and pressed them into her hand as we
went past, anticipating the inevitable property damage. 
  "Open up! Police!" came the yell. 
  "and Federal Agents!" was the second as we covered the distance to the
window. 
  "We've got a warrant!" the first added. 
  "And guns!" the second topped. 
  "And bullet-proof vests? Do have vests?" the first one yelled, louder. 
  "We don't need vests like you Ken and Barbie Playskool (tm) cops, punk!"
  "Yeah?"
  "Yeah!"
  As we opened the living room window, there were sounds of scuffling and
as we assembled on the ledge, skulls a'crackin'. 
  We looked down eight floors. 
  "We could survive," Paul said. 
  There were gunshots from the hall. 
  "People with badges!" came the cry. 
  "Jump!" I cried and no one moved. "Jump or.." I said, failing for words. 
  "..or what?" Vasquez asked, quizzicly. 
  "OR KILL ME!!" I yelled, and plunged eight floors
  into-
    confetti. My vision was blinded by the dust and in the three rapid
thumps I heard around me scraps of paper flew everywhere, snowing little
clumps of information. 
  Coughing hard, I clawed my way to the top of the pile. Behind us was a
huge cloud of paper-dust, in which cops crashed and sirens bwooped and
stopped. We had gotten away clean. 
  Vasquez looked over the side of the bin. 
  "Hey, this is a StangShredder (c) truck," she said. "All this is
shredded SubGenius documents going to be recycled."
  "How lucky," Paul murmered. 
  "Hey, with Bob on your side, there's no such thing as 'luck'," I said,
and smiled. 
  Later, as we flew back to Arizona as two husband-wife couples, Hardy
nudged me from sleep and asked me her nagging question. 
  "Joe, you know spinal tissue is ideal for cloning. Why'd you do...that?"
she finished with obvious distaste. 
  "Because," I said, "job satisfaction is a factor, too."
  And I dreamed of flying frop plants and hummingbirds with little pipes
and gleaming eyes, Bob's true return all the more imminent.

IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?

1)  No known species of reindeer can fly.  BUT there are 300,000 species of 
living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and 
germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has 
ever seen.

2)  There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.  BUT since 
Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist 
children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million 
according to Population Reference Bureau.  At an average (consus) rate of 3.5 
children per household, that's 91.8 million homes.  One presumes there's at 
least one good child in each.

3)  Santa had 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different 
time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west 
(which seems logical).  This works out to 822.6 visits per second.  This is to 
say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th 
of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the 
stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever 
snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and 
move on to the next house.  Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are 
evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but 
for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about 
0.78 miles per household, a total trip of 75 & 1/2 million miles, not counting 
stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding 
and etc.

This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times 
the speed of sound.  For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle 
on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second; a 
conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.

4)  The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.  Assuming that 
each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), the 
sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably 
described as overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 
300 pounds.  Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see point #1) could pull 
TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine.  
We need 214,200 reindeer.  This increases the payload - not even counting the 
weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons.  Again for comparison - this is four 
times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth II.

5)  353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air 
resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the some fashion as spacecraft 
re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 
14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  In short, they will 
burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, 
and create deafening sonic booms in their wake.  The entire reindeer team will 
be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second.  Santa, meanwhile, will be 
subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity.  A 
240-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of 
his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.

In conclusion - If Santa ever DID deliver presents on
Christmas Eve, he's dead now.
