   Well where do we start? Welcome to Issue 6. Since the last issue alot
   of stuff has been happening.

   Busts! Well it seems to be a growing trend! Perth has had  its  share
   recently all to do with VMB hacking  though (LAME!)  and  also a  few
   guys for Kiddie Porn (LAME!).

   Also we have seen what one  Hacker  with  a  Big Ego  can do  to  the
   internet community with the  recent AUSNET hack by OPTIC SURFER.There
   has been several people  accused of  being  this  weird  person  whos
   handles wont be mentioned for obvious reasons.

   In the other states, there  are busts of a very high magnitude. Proff
   and Traxx currently in legal proceedings for hacking and phreaking in
   the 80's and now being  accused of  hacking  the  AFP  and  leaving a
   rather vile message  telling the  fedz  to "Get off our backs".  This
   rumor has not been  substantiated as Proff, wisely I might add,  does
   not want to comment over  the net  or phone...  By hearsay,  Proff is
   looking at oZ's largest sentence yet with regards to computer crimes.

   For all you people who are VERY behind the times, Captain Crunch  was
   in oZ and has visited all the states. By the way, later in this issue
   we have some humours information about his tour. <g>
           
   Also with  all  the  official  specs  on cable / microwave  tv  being
   released, expect  all the info we can get within the next episode  or
   two. Hopefully with  some work NC can discover how to  scam oZ  cable
   cheaply and effectively.

   Unofficially,  DS][ has a data tap on the line and  this  information
   is based  solely on  rumor and some  security  incidents  which  have
   occurred.  As a precaution, use PGP on vital messages unless you want
   to send the fedz on a wild goose chase (heheheheheh).

   Scene wise,  Perth has been in a slump with very little  activity BBS
   wise or action-wise.  It appears  that  Perth is  in a  recession  in
   regards to knowledge... We haven't seen any  new up-comers that  show
   that 'knack' to become a successful AFP hurter.

   There  also   has  been  a  change  to  the  Neurocactus  membership.
   Data King has joined the ranks after a  debut with  some  interesting
   articles,  and a humourous  stint...  Also  Grudge  has  resigned his
   commission along with Dataphobia.

   So read on and enjoy this issue. Remember, information is power.

   Commanders log, stardate 1800022999.4237.We are currently en-route to
   a secret  meeting  between  Admiral T. Pick and  Captain Ripmax. I am
   trying to organise the ship while we are still cruising the BHP steel
   hotline system,to try to hack some of the remaining boxes left behind
   after the destruction of the starship HARDCORE DESIGN.  Consequently,
   we found the ships captain, Unique-oNE in a jettisoned escape pod and
   have put him to work fixing the chicken soup dispenser.

   ABOARD THE R2

   "Thanks for saving me guys, a few minutes longer and they  would have
   got me", cried the Unique-one.

   "Who would have 'got' you Unique-one?", asked Commander FRaC.

   "I think his name was Captain Buttner  aboard the fed class  starship
   the UNDERCOVER!", squealed Unique-one.

   <Red alert onboard the R2, various sirens are blaring>

   "Captain, we have numerous fed  class  starships approaching from all
   directions!", shouted Ensign Grudge frantically.

   <The R2 is hit by several CLI attacks lowering shields long enoughfor
   a small security party to board>

   "Captain, alert intruders have beamed onboard", yelled Commander FRaC

   <At that moment  three  officers  in  suits  burst  through  from the
   turbolift shooting phasers>

   "Fire at will, crew", screamed Captain Ripmax

   <After a short phaser fight the enemy officers lay dead on the floor,
   unfortunately so to did Ensign Grudge>

   "Warp factor 9, Officer Blade. Get us  out  of  here  and  cover  our
   tracks", ordered Captain Ripmax.

   ABOARD THE FLAGSHIP 2600

   <Welcome all to the crowning of a new admiral inthe United Federation
   of Neurocactii>

   "Captain Ripmax please step forward  onto  the  stage",  called Fleet
   Admiral Theodore Pick.

   <Captain Ripmax steps forward  and  looks  rather  worried,  probably
   thinking he is being reprimanded>

   "Ripmax, we recognise that you have been a long time scene member and
   have brought many young officers into the ranks of the UFNC.  And  we
   also realise that you have served NC and the whole HPA universe  with
   your BBS, through thick and thin.", said a very enthusiastic  Admiral
   Pick.

   "Well i dont really know what to say!  Ummm do I get  a  pay  rise or
   something?", questioned Captain Ripmax.

   "Yes, i think you do Captain... On behalf of Neurocactus oZ,  you are
   hereby promoted to the rank of Admiral to  accept all  priviliges and
   responsibilities from hereafter", said Admiral Pick.

   "You are now in command charge of the  R2  and  the  LSD.  Your first
   officer aboard the R2 who is not present  will  receive  promotion to
   captain upon your return to the vessel", exclaimed Admiral Pick.

   "But sir, what is the LSD?", asked a confused Ripmax.

   "The LSD is a new ship to be commissioned for the next generation  of
   scene members, the crew is being assembled  as we  speak, it  is your
   job to pick a fine crew that will be able to take on the Missing Link
   with  its  new  technology  like SxS,  Crossbar  and ARE",  mentioned
   Admiral Pick.

   "I would like you all to have a minutes silence for the brave  Ensign
   Grudge, who died fighting against the enemys of UFNC"

   The Author of this article has now left the scene, and would like to
   sever all ties with it. Given this, this article has now become the
   intellectual property of NeuroCactus (with the author's consent). Nuff
   Said.

   What is a PBX?
   --------------
   A PBX comes in many varieties. There are ones with codes, ones without
   codes. There are automated front ends on some of them, and some are
   just a back door into a companies phone system.

   There are two ways to hack a PBX. The first is to dial into it by modem
   and re-program them. The other way is to brute force them by dialling
   into the front-end. I will mainly deal with hacking the front end.

   When you dial a front-end of a PBX, you'll either get some variant of a
   dial-tone, or something like 'Please enter the extension number and
   press pound'.

   Code based PBX's
   ----------------
   A code-based PBX is normally one where you dial a number, get a
   dial-tone, then dial a code of a specific length (normally 4-6 digits).
   Then you dial the number you want and bingo! If you want more info on
   this type of PBX, check out a code-hacking proggy such as CodeTheif.
   Automated front ends Again, rather basic. All you need do with these is
   scan out all the extensions on it. Also, try combinations including *,
   # & 0 first. You'll be looking for voice-mail, dial tones & carriers.
   If you get a carrier, it may just be a dial-in to hack the PBX using
   your modem. This is common for PBX's such as IBM's ROLM and Nortel's
   MERIDIAN, as well as ASPEN's that are connected to a switch (PBX).

   Back door, front-ends (BDFE)
   ----------------------------
   Ok, this brings me to the main part of this file. Back-door type PBX's,
   with a dial-tone based front-end. These are the type I love, and you
   can find all sorts of shit on them. Hacking a BDFE PBX requires a
   brute-force method of hacking them, that is, dialling them repetitively
   belting different combinations of DTMF (touch-tones) at them each time
   you ring. On BDFE PBX's, there are certain messages you get from 'em,
   in the form of tones, such as a ring or busy tone. This can vary
   greatly but on the majority of them, it is rather straight forward.

   Usually, when you pick up the phone, and start dialling, you will get a
   'busy' tone if you stop dialling before you give the exchange enough
   digits. Well, this is also the case with a BDFE PBX. If you haven't
   dialled enough digits, you'll get (after a pause) a busy signal. Again,
   when you pick up the phone normally, and dial a disconnected number,
   you get a message saying that the number is wrong. Well, this is also
   the case with BDFE PBX's, except instead of the message, you normally
   get an error tone, normally something like <bing><bong><bing><bong>....
   There are other things you can get on a BDFE PBX. Things such as a
   dial-tone (no shit) on an  extension. When you get a dial-tone, it can
   be one of 3 things: loopback, sub-PBX or fake.

   A loopback dialtone will loopback to the beginning again, so say you
   rung a PBX and dialled *0 to get a loopback dialtone. At the second
   dialtone you can again dial *0 to get the same dialtone again.
   ad-finitum. The dialtone on a loopback is normally the same as the
   original dialtone, but don't take that literally - there are always
   exceptions to the rule.

   A sub-PBX dialtone  could be one of two things again. It could be a
   code-based PBX, or it could be yet another BDFE PBX.

   A fake dialtone won't accept tones at all. I am yet to discover what
   the deep and inner meaning behind these are, other than pointless.
   (any suggestions are welcome).

   Ok, now you got the basics, lets got to the important bit.

   Scanning/Hacking BDFE PBX's
   ---------------------------

   This normally takes fucking ages. Bad luck, you wanna phreak right? To
   hack a BDFE PBX, I suggest you find a good text editor that makes good
   use of the enter, tab and cursor keys. MS-DOS Editor I have found also
   need a phone  with big buttons, a comfortable handset and at least one
   programmable  memory button. Program the number of the BDFE PBX into
   the memory button, along with a code if it costs money to call it.

   Now, what your going to need to do is dial the PBX over and over again,
   trying patterns of numbers, incriminated slightly each time you call.
   The best way for me to explain this is with a case study. Ok, we've
   got an imaginary PBX, with the phone number 1-800-IMA-HACKER
   (Compliments of *****). Ok dial the number, you get a dialtone. hit 0.
   You get an error tone. Write this down, eg:
   -- SCAN.TXT --  0  err

   Ok, cans are almost always on exposed areas next to roads, no buts
   about it. This is because they are easily spotted and a piece of
   veritable piss to phreak off once in.

   Equipment:

   1 - Telecom Can Key or facsimile
   2 - Hex wrench or Crescent (Adjustable wrench)

   Ok cans come in a few varieties, most common are 1 meter high or so
   cans, there are also 1.5meter monsters with handles to lift off the
   cylinder. Frac states that hardly any are pressurised anymore and that
   telco probably never bother chasing down depressurizations on cans, as
   they have a small alarm switch, so you are basically safe as houses,
   well maybe.

   Locate a can that is in a well hidden spot, bit of a search but worth
   finding. I suggest a small one as they are easier to handle. Use your
   telco key or a fake to turn the can lid lock and take the lid off.
   Then with the hex wrench or adjustable spanner just unscrew the bignut
   while holding the cylinder down, as it may fly up when depressurized.
   Ok, once in then you will see a number of racks of terminals, bit
   like pie segments all around the can.

   Rack diagram may be a bit incorrect.

   Simple really, hook up your alligator clips to the correct terminals.
   They are arranged horizontally I think. You might be able to listen
   to people chatting etc. depending on the hour, but according to all
   intelligence people most phone conversations are dead boring so don't
   bother.

   The disadvantage of cans is they are usually almost next to a road
   and are a bit difficult to reassemble in a hurry as the NC crew found,
   but there is no chopping/damage involved so your chances of detection
   are minimal. Remember some poor suck picks up the bill for your calls
   so always use different pits and cans for safety, as they WILL
   complain to Telco about that $90 phone call to Upper Tanzania, and
   telco will probably check there first.

   Ok, that concludes the canning/pitting tutorial I guess. I've been as
   accurate as memory serves, no doubt I've made mistakes, but I don't
   take tape measures into pits and cans. I know there is new information
   there for ya all. :)

   In the Australian Scene there has been quite a bit of interest
   recently in Cellular Telephones. There is a lot of confusion and
   mis-information out there on this subject.

   What follows is the result of quite a bit of work, by myself and
   several other people, We did this not for any illegal purpose, but
   purely in an effort to proove Telecom wrong and show that it is
   possible.

   Usage of Cellular Telephones
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   I do not condone or encourage any person, living or dead, to use the
   information contained with in this article for any illegal purpose.
   (See NeuroCactus Main Disclaimer)

   If you are considering reprogramming a cellular phone with another
   persons details and then fraudulently calling your friends all over
   the world, forget it!

   Every number you call will show up in their records as well as the
   cellular cell that you called from and any subsequent cells you moved
   to. You will get caught, don't do it.


   Equipment Used
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following equipment is a list of the equipment that I have
   personally used to reprogram a Motorola Bag Fone.

    1 x Motorola Bag Fone
    1 x Reprogramming Cable (See next Section)
    1 x Mot911 Software (Motorola V9.11 Reprogramming SW)
    1 x 386sx 16 PC running MS-DOS
    1 x 9 Volt DC Powerpack (I used a Smart2 500mA Regulated Unit)
    1 x Pre 9122 Motorola EPROM (I used v9023 of the EPROM)


   Building a Reprogramming Cable
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   A reprogramming cable is not difficult to make, I used the following
   components:

    1 x Male D Connector (25 Pin)
    1 x Female D Connector (25 Pin)
    2 x D Shells (25 Pin)
    1 x 30cm of 9 Core Cable
    3 x Short Pieces of Insulated Wire.
    1 x Power Connector Lead (Female Version of the connector on the
                              Power Supply)


   The diagram of the cable I used is slightly different to what is
   commonly available on the net:

        Computer        Transceiver
        Printer Port    Port
        (Male DB 25)    (Female DB 25)

                    3 ------------ (-9 Volt Supply)

                    4 -\
                    5 -------------(+9 Volt Supply)

         1  --------------- 18
         2  --------------- 21
      /- 3
      |  4  --------------- 1
      |  12 --------------- 12
      |  13 --------------- 11
      \- 14 --------------- 17
         17 --------------- 20
         18 --------------- 14--\
         20 --------------- 23--/

   Once I had  everything correctly assembled, I spent sometime testing
   the connections, as my computer wouldnt like 9 volts pumped into its
   printer port.

   Hardware Modifications
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   With this type of transceiver there is no need for any fancy
   modifications to the unit, although my phone had a post 9122 eprom so
   I had to find and burn an earlier version of the eprom, this was not a
   difficult task as the unit uses a standard 27c512, which I obtained
   from my local electronics shop.

   To identify what version of the ROM I had in the phone, I hooked
   everything up and then had the MOT911 software read the unit, The
   software reported that my ROM version was post 9122, so I had to
   change the ROM.

   This then presented me with problem to solve, getting the cover off of
   the unit, as I didn't have the correct driver for the screw, I simply
   drilled the heads off of the screws with a power drill on the low
   speed setting, the cover then lifted straight off, allowing me access
   to the circuit board.

   To reattach the cover, I went through my screw draw and found some
   screws with the same thread, removed the headless screws from the base
   and screwed the lid back on using the new screws.

   Interestingly enough once the unit has been reprogrammed I found that
   I could remove the 9023 version of the rom and put the post 9122
   version back in and the unit continued to operate correctly.
   
   Reprogramming
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Now that I had everything correctly set, it was time to attempt to
   reprogram the phone, so I connected it all up and started the motorola
   software on my PC, I followed the instructions and then selected the
   last option from the type of fone to reprogram (any black/silver box).

   The program read the NAM details from the phone, displayed them on the
   screen and it wouldnt allow me to edit any of the options, interesting
   I thought to myself, and then I remembered that the earlier version of
   the program had a batch file to start the program.

   I got the old version and unzipped it, viewed the batch file, it
   contained a single line:

                MOTOROLA /NAM /ESN /NVR /LPT1 /E7

   Using these command line options allowed the software to go into edit
   mode and I could now edit all of the fields displayed on the screen.

        /NAM     - Allow edit of the NAM table

        /ESN     - Allow edit of the ESN details

        /NVR     - Non Volatile RAM Clearing

        /LPT1    - Use parallel port number 1

        /E7  - I believe this to be which IRQ the parallel port is on,
                       but I am not certain.

   Before going into what I did to reprogram the unit, I will first
   briefly explain some of the terms and also give examples of the common
   settings for them. Not having any technical manuals from Australian
   Cellular Carriers has meant that I have had to gather this information
   from trial and error based on what people overseas have done or have
   found from their cellular carriers.

   ESN: Electronic Serial Number

        This is what they use to identify whether a unit is stolen or
        not. There should never be more than one phone with the same ESN.
        Each ESN is unique. The ESN is represented by a hexadecimal
        number.

        The first two digits of the ESN represent the manufacturer of that
        phone, This is a complete list of all the manufacturers and their
        codes that I currently know.

   MIN: Mobile Identification Number.

        This is the telephone number of the phone, BUT it is not exactly
        the same as they number you know for your phone, the actual area
        code part of this field is represented differently. In Australia
        we currently have 3 area codes for analog mobile phones 015, 018,
        & 019. The machine versions of these numbers are 5050, 5060, and
        5070. So for example if my telephone number was 018-123-456, in
        the MIN field it would be entered as 5050-123-456.

        5050 is the equivalent of 018 and not 015 due to the order of use
        of the mobile prefix's. 018 was the first to be used, hence the
        5050 number is it's machine representation, followed by 015
        (5060) and then 019 (5070).

   SIDH: System Identification (for) Home System

        This is a five digit number that is provided by carrier. The last
        digit should match the Preferred System Mark (0 or 1)

   AOIC: Access Overload Class

        This is  not used like it was designed to be, but its purpose is
        to allow the system to decide who should be dropped in an
        overload situation. Usually the last number of you phone number
        preceeded by a 0, In America 15 in this field identifies your
        phone as Military/Police and your phone is the last to be dropped
        in an overload situation.

        I am still trying to find out if here in Australia there is an
        equivalent of 15, I suspect if there is it maybe 01 as this seems
        to give the clearest and least number of "drop outs".

   PS: Preferred System

        A single digit that determines which set of channels the mobile
        scans. The A system (Channels 1-333) or the B system (334-666).
        This should match the last digit of the SIDH.

   SCM: Station Class Mark

        This 4 bit binary field specifies the power output, number of
        channels, and vox capabilities of the unit. Some of the common
        settings are:

                             Number of Power

            Binary       Decimal         Channels         Output    Vox

            0000           00              666              3.0     NO
            0010           02              666              0.6     NO
            0100           04              666              3.0     YES
            0110           06              666              0.6     YES
            1000           08              832              3.0     NO
            1010           10              832              0.6     NO
            1100           12              832              3.0     YES
            1110           14              832              0.6     YES

        The power output is measured in watts. Generally your in Car
        phones are 3 watts and your hand helds are 0.6 watts. This is
        what makes Motorola bag phones so attractive, they are portable,
        and they are 3 watts.


   The part of the reprogramming procedure that is of most interest was
   changing the phone to look like another, as I did not want to do
   anything illegal I wrote down the current ESN & MIN and then replaced
   them with garbage numbers.

   Once I had done this, I pressed escape to tell the software I had
   finished changes, at this point it is VITAL that nothing prevents the
   software from completing its calculations and writing to the phone.

   If such an interruption was to occur, then the phone would end up with
   bad data stored in its table, and will not work.

   This happened to me several times, and I found that there is no
   permanent damage, if you correct the fields that are corrupt and write
   everything out to the phone successfully then everything will be ok.

   Once this step had completed, the software asked me several questions
   about altering defaults and clearing the NVR, as this was not to be a
   permanent change I left them as they were.

   After the above questions were answered, the software disconnects
   itself from the phone and informs you that you can now remove the
   phone from the programming adapter.

   I now had a reprogrammed phone, however I had no way to test it as the
   information contained in it was deliberately bogus, so I repeated the
   programming steps above, this time removing the bogus data, and in its
   place entering the correct details that I had written down earlier.

   After completion of the programming I disconnected the telephone from
   the programming adapter, reconnected it to it's battery and
   successfully called people on it under its original ESN and MIN, which
   I had just programmed into the unit.


   Conclusion
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   The title of this section could be "Yes, Telstra are lying when the
   say it is not possible", but then we all know from past experience
   that Telstra lie about anything to do with "phreaking".

   To reprogram a Motorola cellular telephone is quite easy once you know
   how, however it is highly illegal to change the ESN & MIN for
   fraudulent purposes, take my advice and do not do it.

   To the best of my knowledge however there is nothing to stop you
   changing the other details within the phone, so long as you do not
   change an option that causes any problems with the cellular network.

   One of the things that can be done using this software and programming
   adapter is inform your telephone of any new accessories that you get,
   for example you might buy a VOX kit.

   Normally you would have to pay your local dealer a fee to change the
   option within your telephone so that the VOX kit would work, now you
   can do it yourself, save the cash, and buy me a scotch with it if we
   ever meet!
