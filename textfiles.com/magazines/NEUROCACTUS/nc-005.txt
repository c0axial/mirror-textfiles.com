   Captains Log Stardate 304.9516. Things have been quiet on the R2  and
   the crews moral is low.  Things  are  so  bad  we  have  resorted  to
   flicking through the ships video library for some light entertainment

   "Its not a Game, Its a criminal act." blarred out of the  TV  screen.

   "Fuck guys, not another re-run of Attitude",exclaimed Captain Ripmax.

   "Yeh" chuckled Ensign Grudge, "I just love that hair style"

   "and specially that bit about where we  are  all  anti  social"  said
   Officer Blade.

   Meanwhile in the main drive room of the R2, Caommander  Frac  watches
   over the information superhighway. He steers the R2 down some  unusal
   looking cables and appears outside a grey pit labelled 'Communication
   Cables'.

   Commander Frac immediately recognises them as cable television cables,
   ready for connection in Mar '95...

   "Captain, we have a unique opertunity to rip off some cable tv here.",
   shouts Commander Frac.

   "Ahh finally something to get us into action  again",  Captain Ripmax
    remarked.

   "Ensign Grudge how long do you think it will take you to makea decoder
    for the System"

   "At least 3 weeks, but as we havent got 3 I'll do it in 1 for you"

   Aboard the Missing Link

   "Ah ha Ken I've done it.. I've set up that virus on box 4234 at last.
   They wont be able to change the outgoing message for a while now...",
   squeeled Neil Campbell.

   "Good werk honey", replyed DS Ken Day."But  perhaps  you  could  have
   erased the current message before you installed it!"

   "Doh" exclaims Neil Cambell.

   "Anyway lets get back to the Job at  hand  and  track  down  the  R2.
   Rumours have it there scanning remote  sectors of WA so  we'll travel
   that way via SAFENET and meet up with our local operative there" said
   DS Ken Day rubbing his hands together with  anticipation  of  finally
   catching the R2's crew.

<This file is interupted while the perth branch of NC in its entirity go out
to cause hassles for the local government>

   Back aboard the R2

   "Did you guys see that on the  News  just  then?"  exclaimed  Officer
   Blade, "AUSCERT has finally made there first Bust!"

   "They  couldn't  bust a two  dollar  whore!", shouted  Commander FRaC.

   "No I'm serious, Commander. They are actually allowed to do something
   in this country...",Blade snickers.

   "Great guys  lets  send them  on  a BIG  wild goose  chase...", yells
   Captain Ripmax.

Ok girls and boys here is a way to get free shit and not have to worry bout any
hang ups. Tis all bout using eftpos machines and ya own key card....

Now this is 100% safe to do, it has been vererfied by both the anz bank and a
police member ...

Now first what ya have to do is get off ya fat ass and decide that ya need some
petrol and food for that pitting trip......

Day starts - Go to ya local Bank and tell them that ya key card has been stolen
and that ya wanna kill access to ya key card....

Next ring the Police and tell them that ya wallet has been stolen from some
remote location (ya can include that ya got bout $100 bucks in the wallet or
they might think that ya are a wanker for wasting there time.)

Next rub the (your) card against the ground so that it kills the magnetic strip,
so ya cant run it tho the eftpos machine. Best to do it on the ground as it
looks right, ya could just scratch it with a knife or sumthing but it will
prolly get the operator suss.....

Now we have that done the fun starts...  Go to ya local Supermarket ( ya feeling
quite hungry now !!!! :) ) Start filling up ya trolly with food for a party eg
munchies for ya pitting execise and go to the checkout.

Now here the fun begins for the operator.... let them put all ya stuff thru and
when they say, how would ya like to pay for that Sir, ya hand them ya key card.
They wont check the back first, they'll swipe the card and tell you that the
card hasn't gone thru, they'll prolly try bout 5 times then they'll call a
superviser.. dont worry 'bout these people they r just as dumb as the operator
believe me i know :) heheheh !!!  she'll either say sorry sir ya card doesn't
seem to work (fucking no shit woman heheheh) well have to do a manual
transaction. then she'll get a machine and take a carbon copy of ya card and
get ya to sign ya name... then she'll hand it back to ya... and ask ya to show
some other from of id with a signature on it (make sure it doesn't have a picky
on it or you'll pay later!!)

Now just sign away heheh no worries and leave. Now cause the Bank has cancel
ya key card that money that ya just drew out goes out of the Banks insurance
and not out of ya account as ya have already told the back that ya card has been
stolen :) ya might think why ring the cops and say ya wallets been stolen. The
answer being if the Bank rings the supermarket and asks did ya verify the
signature and they say yes then they'll ring the cops to verify it being
stolen. Best to be safe i say :) But none of this gets checked till bout 5 hour
after ya made ya withdrawal.. but it does happen!

Then ya drive to ya petrol station and do the same just this time fill up with
petrol,  what can he say "NO" we'll have to take that petrol out of ya car!
we wont do a manual transaction :) like hell heheeh, Petrols stations will
always do a manual transaction, as they know they dont loose out, the bank does
but with the supermarket they just might say that they cant do a manual
transaction, but then all that happens is that ya leave the stuff that ya
collected, for them to put back on the shelves for the next 1/2 hour, they'll
really love ya for that :) heheheheheh

[note: The best way to check whether you'd stuffed the card is to swipe it
       thru a Credit Card fone.  This way you avoid getting harrased by staff
       and you dont lose your card.  Blade..]

Now for the tech. info on new eftpos machines..

Woolies and most big groceries corp. r using a new brand of id check to see if    
the card is stolen. What happens is that all eftpos machines have a direct
phone line in/out to the banks computer networks, which is always connected.
When making a transaction it first checks the card to be either reported stolen
or out dated if either of these come up then the company is entitled to
retain the card at store level... to be returned after a Bank employee have 
verified the card personally....in the case of out of date then the card is
kept and destroyed.. in the case of damaged.. the store may opt to do a manual
transaction, and finally in the case of stolen the store is not permitted to
take any action agains you in any form, they will try to stall you there as 
long as possiable and the eftpos machine will inform the police of where the 
card user is and at what time. This process happens as soon as the eftpos 
machine comes up with card stolen.... On the hand terminal you'll see a error 
codes and a display of card invalid remember this means that the above process
has already started...

Stay turned for my next piece on the programming of eftpos terminal and codes
that you can try....

         [ some petrol stations have camera's, so avoid these at all times ]

   On a recent trashing run BSec and Frac were almost run down by an irate
   do-gooder (?) in a red mini-minor. What follows is sound advice for any
   hack/phreak caught in a similar compromising position:


 1. After the car pulls off the road and attempts to run you down it's
    time to consider leaving. If you're on grass as we were then run like
    fuck to get away. If you're on the road well get off it as it's well
    lit and cars have great traction on tarmac (duh!).

 2. Run through trees and obstacles and jump bollards/fences as even maniacs
    in red mini-minors are hesitant of spoiling their duco on an obstacle.
    (Hack/Phreaks are obviously ok of course!)

 3. If pursued run like hell, if you've been chased over 200 metres by a car
    and you and your partially wasted companion (Frac on Acid) are getting a
    little tired then try to avoid a foot race.

 4. Drop the garbage bag! Neanderthals in mini-minors will stop to see if
    there's anything good to eat! Then hide somewhere until they head off
    with their winnings (garbage).

 Handy Tips

 - Try and pick a low powered and highly visible vehicle (such as a red
   mini-minor) to engage in the chase. It will be a fair race in the 100m
   dash on grass, and the paint scheme enables easy identification. (Trees
   and grass are sometimes hard to distinguish from cars trying to run you
   down)

 - Try and perform the bollard jumping bit within 3 metres of Telecom property
   to allow the staff to gain maximum amusement/bemusement from your antics
   with the garbage bags and the car.

 - Don't stop and try to thumb a lift.

 - Don't stop to look around for weapons in a park, bark and leaves are a
   poor substitute for a pump-action shotgun, required against an idiot in a
   red mini-minor.

 - Don't get stoned before starting footraces with automobiles and their
   drivers.

 - Don't steal GARBAGE! It's not worth getting run down for!

 - Share the load, if Frac had helped out with the baton change (garbage bag)
   we may have made off with our winnings!

 - Don't steal garbage in plain view of red mini-minor drivers.

 - Don't attempt to counsel or use subtle persuasive techniques on someone
   yelling "I'm gonna fuckin kill ya!!" as they try and run you down in their
   pissy vehicle.

 - Give the bag to UNiQUE-One next time so he will present the major target.

 - Use natural terrain (bollards, grass, trees, swings) to prevent being
   turned into toejam.

 - Run like fuck!

 - Get Frac to 'borrow' bags with USEFUL stuff in it.

 - Get the license plate of the car so that you can make up stories to the
   cops about it. "Yeah thats right. XYS-662 a red mini-minor, doing donuts
   in the park and attempting to murder a couple of kids with his car!"

 - Don't stop to check the license plate. Or it may end up imprinted on your
   forehead.

 - Neanderthals LOVE garbage! Just drop the bag and let them forage for
   sustenance, finding nothing of use they will leave.

 - When your thighs are splitting and your lungs are bursting keep running
   as you are in no condition to fight a 6"2, red mini-minor neanderthal.

 - Allow weaker companions (Frac) to lie on the bus stop until recovery.
   Sun Tzu says: "An army marches only as fast as it's slowest unit"

 - Run through bore water to cool off after the chase and to meet with your
   cowardly fellow garbage-wranglers.

 - Never trash twice in one night, it's obviously a bad omen.

 - Never watch Akira before a trashing run, the car scene keeps coming back
   to your troubled mind.

 - Do it when the lights decide to blackout, not when they all go on again.

 - Carry a powerful sidearm to dispense with irate mini-minor drivers and/or
   passengers.

 - Don't take out telecom's TRASH they can bloody well do it themselves. :)

	I'm sure you all know by now that the 199 method of obtaining free
calls is on the way out.  So this leave's the problem on finding a new method
to replace probably the most well know way of phreaking Australian payfones.
This method is simple,  call up the payfone,  answer it and then simply wait 
for dial-tone.  As with 199 you must use a tone-dialler (what do ya mean you
don't have one!).  The software in P1/P2 payfones is currently being upgraded
and the new software fixes this bug so you may find it doesn't work from all
fones (presently it works from most).
	"How do i find the payfone's phone number ?  i thought you had to work
for telecom to find that out!"  YEA RIGHT!  The reason you cannot get the
number from 191231 is that it's category is payfone and IVS wont pass the
number back thus giving a negative message, (it still shock's me how little
we've progressed with computer generated voice since SAM on the c64).  Some ANI
numbers work from some payfones so it's worth trying them all,  why this is
i cannot say but i think it may be because the category isn't set correctly.
Telecard's list the payfone's phonenumber so if your desperate it's worth
getting one.  There's rumours that Telecom are stopping this soon but i've
heard no real evidence of this.  Also you can dial 001600 (this work's from
P1,  P2,  P7),  it will list SCANTS Sorseby or Broadway then list 3 number's,
the last 2 are the last 2 no's of the phonenumber.  From there work out the
prefix (from the area your in or often the cabinate no.) and ya only got 2
numbers to go (ie. 333-xx33) you can scan these OR if you know any other
payfone no's in the area try the same 2 digits as the missing one's (you'll
find some area's use a set pattern on all payfones).  001600 is a freecall 
but annoyingly request money before the call is placed (like 0014's).  Dial
the first 3 no's on the keypad and the rest with your tone-dialler to get
around this.  Rhen's written some interesting stuff 'bout 001600 so i'll
include it here:

[SCANTS - (not definite) Subscriber Communications Access Network T(?) 
System/s?  SCORSEBY or BROADWAY are two database systems set up by telecom
(once again, I'm not yet certain what for, but I am asking around) Both these
do the same thing, one is just a back up of the other. But the PP is just
telling you (assuming you are a telecom worker and want this info for id. of
the PP purposes), that the number is going through the SCORSEBY / BROADWAY
Database.  It is usefull to note which one it is when you do this as the
numbers from the same database are sometimes similar in parts.]

NOTE: Since time of writing, this method is becoming unreliable and only
      works in some areas.

	Following is a list of ANI's to get ya started (you may have noticed
that 1231 has changed to 191231,  this is due to austels new numbering 
plan 12 being the prefix for operators).

			08 1231           018 018 222

Ok, well Frac has probably filled you in on some pitting already, but I'm
fortunate enough to have a nice pit just a few minutes drive from my home
which I had a good play around with. I'll describe how to open a pit, to
hooking up your beige box. This phile is dedicated to the two original
blueboxers who went on to found Apple, Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak
who were caught and asked to stop doing it. :-) Oh for the good old dayz!

Any ASCII artwork is designed for 80x50 and if you aren't using or can't use
80x50 then you're fucking lame and should upgrade to VGA and join the fuckin
'90s.

A typical pit:

Ok, there are many kinds of pit, both in the city, suburbs and country areas.
I'll describe the ones I've seen and looked in. The two most common types
are steel pits, which are of course a fucker to open and close, and the
cute concrete type.


STEEL PITS

Equipment, both steel or concrete:

1 - Pit Lifter
2 - Side Cutters
3 - Flat Screwdriver  (For terminals)
4 - Wire Stripper
5 - Multimeter
6 - Terminals, plastic type
7 - Beige box/handset, modular plug is best
8 - Modular plug and flat cable with alligator clips (Silver Satin is ok)

Note: Cable length can be pretty much any length ..well...

Ok, steel covered pits have a big rusty brown plate over them with a grid
pattern on them and slots to lift them, they measure roughly 80x80cm but
can vary in size. Now they can be also be arranged in 2's or 4's making a
large pit. You can use a good old plant hanger to open these things and
the concrete types. A good pit lifter should look something like this.
                                                             __

It should be made of galvanized steel with a 0.5cm diameter at least. Use
the small end to lift the pit as a large end will no doubt become stuck in
the pit's slot. Mine measures about 32cm long which I find is great for
concrete lids, but a bit of a struggle with steel plate. Remember you can
make a longer lever which allows you to stand up and haul on it if necessary,
but don't actually try to lever a pit open as you will bend the fuck outta
your pit opener.

Rather than lift the lid open, simply drag it off the pit and drag it back
on when finished. All pits are lined with concrete, dirt, bugs and grit, and
are always about 5 degrees hotter than the surface air temp, here is an
example of one pit we came across on a NeuroCactus expedition.

Ok, this was a metal grated deal and was primarily for fibre optic cable. f/o
is easy to spot as it will generally have warning labels plastered around, as
lasers are cool for eye surgery, and will be in a tube fastened securely to
one wall of the pit. If you can't phreak over fibre then fuckin leave it alone
as damaging it is a fucker for hackers too and you may well do a retina in
while smashing it up :)

You see plenty of steel plated ones in the city no doubt they carry a lot of
fibre and of course the old copper subscriber lines now.


CONCRETE PITS

These are little rectangular things with rounded corners which are made up
of two parts, the lid and the concrete pit itself. The lid measures about
80cmx20cm and are about 3cm thick. They weigh a fair bit, not as much as
steel of course, and are best dragged off. The pit is one moulded bit of
concrete that is dropped in, the lid forms a very neat fit with the top of
it, it's about 90cmx24cm and about 70cm deep or so.

Now of course the obvious question is that surely water collects in the pit
and will fuck up the lines? Well no not really, it drains out the bottom and
all connected subscriber lines are insulated properly. Most pits also have
a plastic thing that people aren't sure about. I'll describe it.

Ok, the main subscriber line cover can be screwed on and off the black plastic
portion, and has "Vertical insulation is important" or something to that
effect printed on it in black block letters, basically meaning, keep water
off the unused subscriber lines or you'll have a rusty mess to deal with <g>.

Ok, now as a pitter you shouldn't be interested in unused subscriber lines
as they are useless unless connected back at the exchange. You might find one
thats active but the odds are heavily against it. You need to do something
nasty and cut a subscriber line and strip it back, a subscriber line is about
8mm thick and black with Telecom and specs written somewhere along it. They
will probably join up with a larger feeder cable somewhere in the pit. I
provide both a permanent sortof setup and a description of a one-off hookup.

A good permanent pitting compromise is a screw terminal that looks like this:

            Top View
            ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
       -----≥(0) (0)≥---- <---Lines   Black/Red/White/Blue  (whatever)

            √ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥
       -----≥(0) (0)≥----
            √ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ¥
       -----≥(0) (0)≥----
            ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ

Ok, use a black one and hide it in an unobtrusive part of the pit, screw
each line in after stripping each line back about 0.5cm. Cut plastic off
around the screws if you have that type of connector so that you can hook up
the alligator clips easily. Simply match each colour on one side of the
terminal to the other.

Otherwise just chop it, and strip back each wire, the white and blue are your
best bet. Check with a multimeter like I do, should be 50volts, and polarity
counts Frac says :) Remember to try and use the correct end of the line as
one goes to the phone, and the other to the main trunk! If you are near
homes you will kill someone's phone and they may well come out to check or
call Telco.

Ok, if you know you have the right line, 50volts remember or Frac's
'tongue-test' <chuckle> and nothings happening then press the hook a few
times or reverse the clips and press hook a few times for dial tone. If you
don't have tone yet then you have fucked up or killed your beige box somehow,
and I can't help you.

Now another way of pitting is to hook this up and have a few hundred feet
of cable out to your vehicle or location. Then hook up your laptop and trade
warez all night (lame I know). Or hack .milnet sites, fuck it's not your line
is it? Death threats to the PM.. whatever..

My suggestion is to do this at night at secluded locations with good cover.
Please remember that this is highly illegal and Frac states the correct charge
is "Interfering with a public carrier" or something to that effect, that
may involve a goal term or huge fines. Never think it can't happen to you
because it is just a matter of time, so use your fuckin scone to avoid the
nasty, obnoxious guys in blue.

Ok, as we're on the subject of pitting, then 'canning' is of course the next
subject to progress too. Similar in some ways and much nicer/risker in others,
can opening has advantages, an easy tap being one of them.

 Before you dismiss this small recipe in pursuit of that elusive "Cookbook" 
 you mate once saw while having a wank on the local BBS, consider this. This 
 is INDEED one recipe. The difference being, with a "Cookbook ", there are 
 lucrative amounts of information most of which have not been tried and DON'T 
 work. With this one, it's different. Every explosive recipe I print HAS been 
 used and tested extensively. Thus, I  KlanMan, assure not theoretical 
 reactions but rather Practical reactions. I don't think you will find many 
 recipes set out similar to this one. On a ending note, if you can't at all
 get this primary to work, contact me through NeuroCactus.

 Apparatus: Glass bottle with air tight screw top lid.
            Teaspoon
            Fridge
            Another Bottle
            Funnel
            Filter paper

 Ingredients: Hexamine            (2 teaspoons) 
              Hydrogen Peroxide   (4 1/2 teaspoons)
              Citric Acid         (1 teaspoon)
             
 Whereabouts: Hexamine. The best hexamine comes from the military. They use
                        it as a smokeless firelighter. They can be bought
                        at all good military surplus stores and camping
                        places. If you have a freind in the Army ask for 
                        some. Chances are they can get you a kilo of so. 
                        Anyway, thats how much I can get every time we go
                        out in the feild.
             
             Hydrogen Peroxide. Even though the book I origanally read said
                                that 30% concentrate was all that was needed.
                                I myself use 50% concentrate. I bought it at
                                a chemical cleaning store for $7.70 a litre.

            Citric Acid. I bought this at Coles for 60 cents for 50 grams.
                         Apparently when combined with tartaric acid, 
                         it makes a fizzy lolly or something.

 Method: 1. Put 2 teaspoons of CRUSHED Hexamine into the jar.
         2. Put 1 teaspoon of Citric Acid into the jar with the Hexamine.
         3. Pour 4 1/2 teaspoons of Hydrogen Peroxide into the jar.
         4. Cap the jar and shake for 5 minutes or until everything is  
            disolved.
         5. Put the jar into the fridge for 8 hours. 

   ------------------------------- STAGE 2.--------------------------------

         6. Remove the jar from the fridge ( you should be able to see a fine 
           white powder in the bottom of the jar ).
         7. Put the funnel into another bottle. Fold the filter paper in 
            half, and in half again. Now you should have a cone. Put it into 
            the funnel.
         8. Pour the contents of the bottle into the funnel containing the 
            filter paper. Add a little water to the jar to pick up the 
            remaining precipitate and pour the contents into the filter paper.
         9. Allow it to filter for about 20 minutes.
        10. Dry the precipitate in the sun for a couple of hours. 
        
   --------------------------------STAGE 3. -------------------------------

        11. Scrape the white powder into a film container. It is now a 
            Primary Explosive.
       
 Detonation: Any type of intense heat or naked flame will cause detonation.
             Don't be dissipointed when you find that detonation isn't a loud
             boom. Rather a large ball of flame. Remember, it's only a 
             PRIMARY explosive. The explosive power of HMTD comes when 
             confined.  

 ============================================================================

 Assuming that you know a little about CO2 explosives, the principle behind
 these detonators is very much the same. Rather than use crappy Black Powder, 
 substitute it for HMTD. The following is a more detailed explanation on 
 making detonators. 

 You Need: An empty Soda bulb ( from a soda stream machine )     
           HMTD ( about one teaspoon )
           Industral Fuse ( about an inch or two )
                 
 Take the empty soda bulb cylinder and using a very small funnel, pour the 
 HMTD into it. Take about an inch of industrial fuse and wedge it through the 
 opening in the Soda bulb. Seal the crack with super glue.

 Detonation: Simply light the fuse and wait around a minute for detonation.
             I personally don't use this detonation method but rather my own
             electric designed explosives ( which is too confusing to enter 
             in ASCII ). 

 Notes: It's not nessasay to fill the bulb up. I've found it works quite well
        even at a quater full. I generally use a third filled bulb.

        If your every hold a det and it feels rather warm for no apparent 
        reason, THROW IT AWAY and look for the first place you can take cover. 
        Failing to heed this could result in the dissociation of your lower
        forearm and your elbow. I was lucky that when one went off on the
        table beside me, I had a human shield to filter out the incoming 
        shrapnel. 
        
        Don't be to concerned about the bulb not being sealed well. I
        guarantee even an open soda bulb will work as well as a closed
        one. This is because of the rate of the primary explosive expanding.
        Approximatly 3000 m/p/s which is about ten times faster than REALLY
        GOOD black powder.

 Uses: To detonate something like the composition C's or ANFO, simply embed the
       detonater well into the secondary explosive.

       They make great grenades by placing a piece of PVC piping over the
       Soda Bulb. This produces high velocity shards of hot metal and 
       plastic. Quite effective I've found.

       They make brilliant firecrakers ( bar that mean thing they do with 
       their outer case ). The sonic boom is louder than some high powered 
       rifles!!

       If you do find a way to use electric detonation, be sure to use a 
       couple as depth charges. They work GREAT with a jar full of ANFO.
