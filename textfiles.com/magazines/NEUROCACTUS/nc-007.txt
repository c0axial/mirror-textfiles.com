   As the sands fall through the hour glass so does issue seven  of  the
   Neurocactus magazine. Welcome back to the not so informational  light
   hearted H/P magazine. We apologize for the lateness of  this  release
   but with certain legal matters going  ahead  (Skeeve)  and  Datakings
   article we thought we better wait and see what happens.  We've plenty
   of news for this Issue so time to enlighten you.

   As we have promised, NC-003 we would track  down  and  our  search is
   almost complete. We have managed to contact  The Pick who  informs us
   that Scourge sysop of Chiba City has sold his  computer but  kept his
   hard drive so there is hope  yet.  We have also  recovered  The Picks
   'TELCOJAM' mod file. Those of you from a few years back will probably
   recognise the samples. We have included it in this issue.

   Around the place we have been reading a few flames at the NC Team for
   the lack of HOW-TO information in our magazine. Well let us say this,

   1. Some of the members of NC have been busted allready and others are
   probably being watched and to release information that  would  surely
   jepordise ourselves is pointless.

   2. If we did have such  information,  surely  releasing  it in such a
   electronic medium would only kill it within a few weeks if not sooner
   How many times have we seen things like the SCENEINFO Line being  run
   for months hassle free and as soon as posted in NC, killed.

   3. The purpose of this magazine isnt to pass on information that  any
   person could use, but rather give you  ideas  on  which a  person may
   wish to follow up on for themselfs ie active people.

   Anyways enough of that. We wont give names as thats  childish  but Im
   sure the people in WA know who we are talking  about anyways.  If you
   guys are so worried why not make your own magazine?  Lets see all  of
   your 'Elite' information.

   On another note, we are looking to expand the magazine with  feedback
   from users either anonmously (not preferred) or alias's.  Flames wont
   be published but constructive criticism is ok. As you would have seen
   in the last issue aswell we accept anonymous  articles if  there good
   enough.  Post a message on  any of the  boards  located  in the  last
   article or call DS2 and login as  name:NC p/w:NC. Once logged on send
   all mail via Ripmax only.

   All three Perth VMB hackers who were busted have finished their cases

   SIN      : 150 Community Service Hours
   EXCEL    : 9 Months Probation
   UNIQUE-1 : 50 Comminity Service Hours - Childrens Court

   One Perth guy was also done for AT&T Calling cards so BECAREFUL!

   Okay thats enough ramblings from me for this issue.

   ADMIRALS LOG: Stardate 19950807. The coronation service was one  week
   ago and Im now travelling to Starbase 2624 to meet up with  the  crew
   of the R2 on some R&R. The R2 is also being put  into  spacedock  for
   some much needed repairs to the Cabling systems. All systems will  be
   upgraded to fibre optics soon. The new Galaxy class starship  LSD  is
   awaiting us for a testrun before we decide on its crew.

   "Captain FRaC you have the bridge, I'll be in my quaters",  commanded
   Admiral Ripmax.

   "This is Captain FRaC aboard  the  LSD  requesting  clearance",  says
   Captain FRaC.

   "Confirmed", replied Base Commander Anubis. "Best of luck  out  there
   boys, kick some fed butt."

   A smirk across FRaC's face was the last he saw before the image faded

   "Ensign Dataking, Plot a course for the Linux  Galaxy,  9  Bogomips",
   commanded FRaC," Engage!"

   "Now entering sector 1.2.11 Captain", yelled Ensign Dataking.

   "I bags the first 10 bugs in it...", shouted Officer Blade

   "Nah they are MINE", exclaimed  Captain FRaC,  "Engage  the  ftp exec
   protocol ensign"

   "Too late Captain... the system is ummm gone!",sighed Ensign Dataking

   The crew of the LSD were unaware of optic  trashers  who  had  beaten
   them to the post and had devistated the whole  system  leaving  but a
   few peices of debree left in the /tmp directory.

   "Get me a  traceroute on the last incoming packets",  yelled  Captain
   FRaC frantically.

   "Engaging Packet sniffer Captain", came a  muffled  voice  from below
   the console.

   "Yes i think ive found the source of  the  destruction,  Captain,  it
   appears to be coming from...", said Officer Blade

   **** ALERT **** ALERT **** Red alert is sounded upon the LSD

   "What is wrong ensign?", shouted the Captain

   "Umm we appear to be getting bombarded with incoming  packets!!!  The
   contents appear to be... WAREZ!!!", screamed ensign Dataking

   "Engage the Firewall!" commanded Captain FRac.

   "Too late sir," replied Officer Blade, "The forward device array is
   too badly damaged."

   "Quick  plot a  course  back to  starbase  2624  urgently  before  we
   sustain any more damage from the warez!", said Captain FRaC.

   The LSD's maiden voyage was cut short due  to  the  work  of a  optic
   pirate and his 'elite' warez, and the  ship  returns  home  with  the
   dazed and angered look upon the crew.

   This is a preliminary introduction to RIM, a system discovered during
   a recent trashing run by the perth Neurocactus team. If anyone has any
   information about RIM, NC would appreciate the help working this
   system out.

   RIM appears to be a remotely placeable semi exchange which can offer
   all the features of the parent (AXE or Sys12). The official Acronym
   has not yet been discovered but I beleive it to be Remote Internal
   Multiplexor. The obvious use of the RIM is to provide telephone
   services remotely without the need for a full exchange ie AXE or
   SYS12.

   The RIM unit establishes a connection to the parent exchange in one of
   three ways.

   1.1: Non-Integrated Mode
       -- Interface to parenting switch (AXE/S12) at VF
       -- Supports all services currently supported by parenting switch

   1.2: Integrated Mode
       -- Interfaces to parenting switch directly at 2Mbit/s
       -- Supports a number of services provided they are available at
          the switch.

   1.3: Mixed Mode
       -- Interface to parenting switch at VF and 2Mbit/s
       -- Supports all services as per 1.1 and 1.2

   The features available at the RIM as a subset of the parent switch are
   related to the protocol of transmission used. The best protocol and no
   doubt the most secure is due for use in Dec 1996 which will allow all
   services including easycall to be available at the RIM end.

   Here is a field diagram of the COMNET in which the RIM will be
   connected to access the remote parenting switch.

   Comnet Workstation ---X28--.     SULTAN    .- Mediation Device - RIMS

                                   \  |  /
   Comnet Workstation --LAN--X25---DCN/DDN---------.
                                  /   |       \      \
                               X25   X28 Backup \      \

                            /         |            \      \
   Comnet Database ----- Network Management Group   ` After Hours Centre


   The reason for COMNET is to be able to access the RIMS units from
   anywhere on the Digital Communications Network (Austpac) via DDN. As
   you can see, the RIM units can be either directly connected to the
   network through a mediation device (protocol translater) or by dial up
   modem. This leaves open the oppertunity for someone with protocol
   emulation, to dial into the mediation device and emulating a RIM. The
   power gained here would be the same as having 'root' on a local
   exchange... Naturally if you can get yourself onto COMNET from either
   a workstation on the net or getting in from remote through austpac,
   you can attempt to hack the RIM unit and of course any of the other
   things on the COMNET network.

   Now is the perfect time to start attacking such a system as it is
   still in testing and i have inches thick of pages of bugs and problems
   in the system that might be exploited and the system doesnt appear to
   be anywhere near fully operational untill Dec 1996.

   The only information gathered so far into the operating system
   vulribilities are the account groups which will be on the system.

   NMG,NSS,EMG,COC INSTALLER and MONITOR.

   The default UserID on the system is STARTUP and is in the INSTALLER
   group.

   Although it may be in vein to attack such a default account, you never
   know it may still be there as the system is still being installed B-)

   This is all the information im prepared to publish about the system
   which is apparently 'Telecom Confidential'. If you want any more
   information please contact Neurocactus directly.

   For those who are behind the times (and the internal inconfidence
   paperwork) here are some of the new easycall features which may or may
   not be available already. Some of these features lead me to beleive
   that the abilities of the exchanges as far as privacy is concerned is
   being compromised.

   Package 3
   ~~~~~~~~~
   Selective ring: Allows the user to define a CLI scrrening list of full
   or partial national numbers that will cause a distinctive ring cadance
   when calls are received from these numbers. Up to 3 selective rind
   screening lists are provided per line each one generating a seperate
   distinctive ring.

   <OUCH!!! Imagine the consequences here guys... if customers have that
   sort of screening power id hate to see what logs they have on the
   exchanges>

   Selective call diversion: Diverts calls selectively based on a CLI
   screening list. The customer creates, and has control over, the
   contents of the screening list.

   Multiple Subscriber number: Allows multiple numbers to terminate on the
   same device (L12). Calls to each number will generate seperate
   distinctive ring cadences. Charging applys per number, except for
   charges related to the physical access.

   Remote control (RCSS): Allows the customer to control features remotely
   by calling a given number at the customers home exchange. The customer
   is guided through the procedure by a series of RVAs. Access is
   controlled by a password. (ehehehehehehe where there is a password
   there is a way in)

   Automatic Callback (CCBS): This feature allows a calling customer
   encountering busy to have the network notify him/her with a distinctive
   ring cadence when the called customer becomes free, and automatically
   connect the call. Up to five callbacks can be queued at any time.

   Some of the above utilise feature tools.

   Password control: Allows the customer to change their password

   Distinctive Dial tone: Provides different dial tones as required by
   various features. An example is facility tone recieved while call
   diversion is active.

   Distinctive ring: Provides different ring cadence depending on the
   characteristics of the incoming call. Examples are for CCBS recall, the
   different MSNs or for selective ring according to the screening lists.

   Screen list editing: Allows the customer to edit and interrogate the
   screening lists used by various features.

   I have noticed that there is a lot of confusion and
   mis-information on the Ausnet breakin by Optik Surfer. Since I
   became involved in this saga I have learned quite a bit about
   it and now is the time to let you, the readers, find out the
   truth, or as much of the truth as I can tell you safely.

   This article was written on 18/06/95, and has been updated to
   be more accurate for the release of NeuroCactus Issue 7.

   As you are probably aware, Mr. Skeeve Stevens was recently
   charged with several hacking charges, (and also 1 Kiddie Porn)
   I make no claims to the validity of information contained in
   this article, to the best of my knowledge everything is fact,
   however circumstances prevent me from  verifying everything as
   100% correct.

   How it was done
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following is purely an educated guess on my part, I
   believe that this is how it was done, but I do not know for
   certain.

   Ausnet provide dial in access via a 131 number (131494), or of
   course you can telnet/rlogin into their terminal server.

   Ausnet does not allow shell access to their machines, when you
   telnet to their machines and login you get asked if you want
   to change you password, and after this you get logged out.

   I believe that the person who committed the breakin simply
   gained access to a shell on the machine and then copied the
   newuser database. Most probably this was done via the
   "newuser" account and one of the many ways you can execute
   another shell other than the standard one.

   Curiosity Value: For a time you could dial into their terminal
   server and login as "newuser", now from here you were expected
   to start the registration procedure, however if you decided to
   do something like:

                     ppp /compressed 38400 default

   You would start up a ppp session with global access. However
   they have fixed this since the Optik Surfer episode. So much
   for Ausnet having the best security of any ISP in Australia!
   (Their sendmail was also a vulnerable version)

   This as I said is purely an estimated guess on my behalf, I
   have not had and probably will never have the opportunity to
   examine the logs of the machine(s) in question to find out for
   certain.


   Who is the Optik Surfer
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It is my belief, and after reading this article, probably
   yours also, that the person who first did this and the Optik
   Surfer are two different people.

   The reason I believe this is simply because the person I
   believe is the Optik Surfer has absolutely no skill when it
   comes to computer security.

   Before I come out and say who I believe the Optik Surfer is, I
   will give you the facts and then you can decide if you agree
   with my analysis.

    1.   Several Weeks prior to the Ausnet breakin, Skeeve spent
         several days here in Melbourne, staying at Monash Uni
         Halls of Residence with a "friend" (From what I hear she
         couldn't stand him after she met him in person).

    2.   Tuesday, 18th April 1995, Approximately 6am, Optik Surfer
         posted a message with the from address of ernst@world.net
         (world.net = Ausnet). The contents of this message is
         fairly well known but for completeness it is included at
         the end of this article.

    2a.  This message was addressed to Journalists who have email
         addresses and also several ISP's. Interestingly enough
         most of the non-national service providers are sydney
         based ones.

    2b.  Several hours before this email was posted, Rewt2 was on
         the net and was offered 1000+ credit cards that were
         "virgin" and offered by the person who "hacked them out".
         Rewt2 was offered these cards in exchange for information
         pertaining to root level holes on ozemail, he refused the
         cards for 2 reasons, the first being he didn't trust the
         source, the second being he had a better use for the
         hole. The person offering the card details was none other
         than Skeeve. Skeeve told him he wanted the information so
         that he could tell ozemail and repair his status with
         them, they were annoyed with him as he was constantly
         connected to them and ran up the equivelant of an $18,000
         bill on a free account, which he was apparently given
         after telling them about another security hole on their
         system.

    3.   Tuesday, 18th April 1995, 4.30am-6.30am, I was on the net
         talking to Skeeve.

    4.   During this conversation Skeeve wished to know how to
         exit from EMACS.

    5.   I have yet to check, but I suspect ernst@world.net uses
         EMACS as his email editor.

    6.   Wednesday, 19th April 1995, Approximately 5.30pm, The
         Australian Federal Police raid Skeeve's home and
         confiscate his equipment.

    7.   Skeeve refuses to supply the Federal Police with his
         encryption key for his MAC hard drive, when asked about
         this Skeeve told me: "There is Kiddie Porn on there.....I
         was working on an article for the Sydney Morning Herald".

    8.   Skeeve is a publicity freak, and considering he was
         telling me before the Ausnet break in occurred that he
         needed more exposure, I have no doubts as to him being
         willing to pull a stunt such as this.

    9.   Skeeve at one stage was telling people that 5 or 6 other
         people told him that I did it, when questioned about this
         Skeeve told me "Frank told me that", I had someone I know
         ask Frank if this was true, Frank said "no".

    10.  When Skeeve was again confronted about him saying it was
         me, he started saying that he had heard it was SPiN-DoC
         had done it (I know Spin fairly well - this is NOT his
         style).

    11.  This is unconfirmed, however I believe the source: Whilst
         Skeeve was in Melbourne, he was using a friends
         ex-girlfriends account at monash uni for access to the
         net (Whether she knew or not I don't know). Apparently
         this person has been speaking to the AFP and will now be
         appearing in court for them as a witness.

    12.  There is a video tape floating around of the Ausnet
         breakin, Optik Surfer mentions it in his email, I have
         heard from someone who has this tape, and apparently the
         tape was supplied to them by Skeeve.

   As you can see I believe that it was Skeeve, however as I said
   earlier I do not think he did the original hack, I believe
   someone told him how to do it.

   Statement
   ~~~~~~~~~

   This statement is addressed to any people in the media who
   happen to come by this file.

   I, Data King, on behalf of all Hackers and Phreakers here in
   Australia say the following:

    1. We believe that the Optik Surfer Incident, is not an
       accurate representation of what we do or our moral and
       ethical standards.

    2. The person calling himself Optik Surfer, should in our
       opinion get the maximum punishment applicable under
       Australian Law.

   As always I am happy to talk to the media on Hacking and
   Phreaking, I am also prepared to make statements concerning
   Carding and Credit Cards, provided it is made clear to the
   readers/viewers that I am talking from a technical viewpoint
   and not as a representative of people involved in credit card
   fraud on the internet.

    Subject: ****** URGENT - PLEASE READ *******
    Content-Length: 5148

    The mail you are now reading, is from an account at Ausnet,
    that has been hacked.

    This mail contains details of Ausnets lack security, and the
    way they left the credit card details of all their users, out
    on the open which anyone could have picked them up.


    This is the stages of the Ausnet hack.

    * registered fake account at Ausnet
    * logged into melbourne.world.net shell server.
    * sydney2.world.net (main fileserver) was mounted on the
      melbourne machine for complete access to any user.
    * the 'newuser' account which was used to register the credit
      details and make peopels accounts, was wide open. In that
      directory contained a number of files which contained the
      credit card details of all 1 thousand or more clients of
      Ausnet.

    * this file has been accessed, and distributed by hackers, and
      CCers all over the world.

    * in an attempt to alert people to this crime of stupidity by
      Ausnet I contacted some people I thought may be able to
      assist in getting it publicized, and Ausnet brought to be
      responsible for their screw up.

    I let a journalist film my access into Ausnet and some other
    sites, to prove it, incase, like many other times, the company
    has denied it. I will leave it up to the journalist concerned
    to decide what he will do with that film.

    * The afternoon of the easter monday, i hacked Ausnets web
      server, in an attempt to alert their clients myself... it
      seems thou, they were quick to find and fix the situation.

    Below is an extract of the Credit card log on Ausnet.

    The list of credit card deleted.

    well thats a sample. there is 1 thousand or more details, and
    almost all of those will be use for carding.

    Ausnet has a lot to answer for.

    I cannot be contacted for futher information about this. I
    hope you will make proper use of this information.

    If more informatio is needed.. please post a message to the
    aus.org.efa newgroup with the subject "Help needed" and no
    body. and if I think it is worth it, I will contact the
    author.

    Remeber - Too Many Secrets

    bye for now.

                  Hacker Charged Over AUSnet credit Breach
                   Taken from West Australian October 17.

   A television station sponsored an attack on a Sydney Internet service
   provider last April that nearly sent it out of business, according to
   representitives of AUSnet computer services.

   These allegatations were made as federal police computer crime experts
   arrested and charged a hacker last Thursday who allegedly compromised
   credit card records at AUSnet computer services.

   AUSnet's media relations spokesman,  Peter  Sertori,  said  the  hack
   undermined  the  integrity  of future  development of  communications
   infrastucture in  Australia.  He  would not  identify the  Television
   station.

   "Hacking is not an activity that should be  treated  lightly  (by the
   courts) - its not a hobby, its a commercial crime",  he said.  "For a
   television  station  to  be  sponsoring  this  sort  of  activity  is
   reprehensible.

   He claims the attack virtually crippled the provider,  with thousands
   of people cancelling their accounts  because of  the  publicity  that
   surrounded the security breach.

   It is likely that  AUSnet  will  seek  civil  compensation  from  the
   station in the near future, he said.

   The attack on AUSnet allegedly cost the company  $2 million  in  lost
   contracts and forced banks to reissue scores of  credit  cards  whose
   numbers the hacker claimed to have published on the Internet.

   Officers from the AFP's computer crime unit charged  the  23-year-old
   self proclaimed Internet consultant with a dozen offences  at  Sydney
   Police Centre including six counts of unlawful access  to  data  in a
   computer and a count of possesing child pornography, a federal police
   spokesman said.

   He was released on bail and is due to appear at ST James local  court
   on October 30. The charges followed a six month investigation.

   A hacker known as the Optik Surfer gained access to AUSnet world wide
   web server in mid April,cracked the password of a system operator and
   stole up to 1400 credit card numbers.

   Optik Surfer  then  copied AUSnet subscriber  information,  including
   credit card  details, and  claimed to  have  distributed  it  on  the
   Internet.

   Mr Sertori said AUSnet shared the some of the blame for the incursion
   as technicians had copied files  between  the  company's  Sydney  and
   Melbourne offices.

   The hacker's message "Remember too  many  secrets"  appeared  on  the
   AUSnets home page. The quote comes from the  1993  hacker  cult movie
   Sneakers starring Robert Redford.

   Electronic graffiti left by the Hacker first  drew  attention  to the
   secuirty breach on the AUSnet site.

   "Did you know that AUSnet clients credit card details are all sitting
   readable on their system?!?!?!, " the  message read, "  We  have  the
   credit card numbers, and it has allready  been  distributed  to  many
   other hackers and carders around the world."

   Police inquiries are continuing and further charges are expected.

   Here is some information which some members  of the  scene  may  find
   useful  and  worrying.  This  source  of  this  information   remains
   classified to NC.

   Subject: Electronic Access Control System (E.A.C.S)

   Conversion of Exchnage access from Abbloy keys to E.A.C.S  is  under-
   way with front door access to Exchanges now  being  by  E.A.C.S  card
   (and phone) and rear door access by card only.

   By the end of today Mullaloo will only have access by card and phone.

   At the end of the Total conversion all phones will have been  removed
   and a sign left to contact hamersley for entry. If  you dont  have  a
   card or mobile you wont get in.

   AFM's and the Fire brigade will key access for emergencies.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   For those of you who dont understand the  above, Telstra  is  worried
   about people wandering around inside their exchanges at night (heheh)
   and is upgrading the already high security abbloy  locks  with  swipe
   magnetic card locks and also the user must use his/her  mobile  phone
   to call inside to gain access... It now looks like the rear door will
   be the only entry point assuming the EACS can be broken (of course it
   can). Although this bulletin only mentions two exchanges,  it is most
   likely that all the metro exchanges will  be  getting  this  upgrade.
   This information made me wonder after I  thought  of  some  mates  in
   melbourne who used to go into exchanges at night and whoomp them B-)
