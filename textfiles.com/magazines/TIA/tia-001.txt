1.

        To be short and blunt.. I hope you like TiA, if you don't, email
phiber@en.com and bitch about what sucks in it. In case you have been 
woundering, my FULL alais is Mephistopheles-NX, Mephisto for short. The
N stands for United States (as on the airplanes), And the X stands for 
eXperimental, which means.. WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS NUT IS GOING TO DO?!
Now that we have that covered.. On with the first issue!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.            Are the people at your school say who they really are?
                            By: Mephistopheles-NX


        Did you ever want to see your permanent record that the school has on
you?  Did you know you HAVE THE RIGHT to see that record? Do you know that in
some states, you may destroy what you may disagree with in your record?
Alot of teenagers don't know that. You see, the people who run your school
neglect to tell you that. Do you want to know why? Part of it is so they can
cover their own ass.. So they can sneek by shit that are lies.. Maybe not on
purpose, but it HAS happend to me. Ever feel like the principal or the super
intendent has a thing on busting your balls? That could be a sign of 
conspiracy.. In a soft term.. Not like the government putting radio active 
shit in your lunch.. A lot softer than that.. But it is still there. 
It might be a way for them to express their own anger and emptiness, to
take it out on YOU! The average, yet not so average teenager. Did you ever
walk in the principals office to get nailed? Like as in squeezed for 
information? If you tell them you dont want to answer a question, they keep
on prying for the answer to it? STAND YOUR GROUND. Say NO! You have the right
to say NO. Its in the constitution.

   Freedom of speech and public assembley.. Need I say more?

        Did you know that if you goto your *school* psychologist and/or
guidence consuler, that they share all that happens in the room on record 
and to the pricipal, to the super intendent AND to the teachers? They can.
They do. And they wont stop unless you stop it. By stoping it, I mean you
can say ABSOLUTLY NOTHING to them. If they threaten with a suspension, or
calling the police.. STAND YOUR GROUND. That will ad more feul to the fire
on teenage rights. I have known people who went to their school psychologists
and took one of those "sanity evaluations", one question was:

 "Do you feel that you can hold your alchohol better than your friends can?"
 A, for very often. B, sometimes. C, never.

Thats not a question he could answer, HE DIDNT DRINK! But, the psychologist
made him answer it and he put C, never. Then he got in with a meeting with
the principal about his "drinking problem". 3 Days later after taking the  
test. Hmm, odd aint it? 

  Bottom line is: Do not trust any of the faculty of your school. If you are
going to see a psychologist, see a private one. It may cost more $$$, but
that extra cash is worth your privacy, isn't it?

Session Start: Wed Jun 12 03:31:23 1996
> hey dood, you in ganja?
<evilive> i am the leader and founder! :).. been 
running it for 3 years..
> keep it up! last one i read was 12 and then i couldnt 
find it anymore
> One of the better ones
<evilive> go to 134.184.49.7  /reznor/GanjaCrop/  there 
are about 200 or so issues there..
> want a interview? :)
<evilive> interview for what???
> for tia.. would be nice to have one to put in my 
premier issue of TiA
<evilive> oh sure! :)
> ok, cool, hold, lemme quit a download
> ok, ready?
<evilive> yeah sure! :)
> ok
> some of these ?'s are nessessary, bare with me now..
> #1 what is ganja all about?
<evilive> no problems..
<evilive> well it is just a bunch of stoners grouped 
together and writing shit for each other basically..
> #2 how many issues currently are out?
<evilive> there are 218 issues :)
> #3 how many people do you think read ganja?
<evilive> thats a hard one.... I suppose that when 
released about 500, but give the issue a week and 
that reaches at least 2000, i have had tons of 
callers... some are not even into the scene at all.
> cool..  
<evilive> there is also a group in washington DC 
wanting to contribute to it..
> #4 do you run a bbs? if so, number?
> err fuck the numbers.. these are off my head anyway
> :)
> which group?
<evilive> i dont remember the name (it is rather long) 
but it is a group similar to norml..
<evilive> it is a group that deals through courts and 
etc legal ways to help get marijuana legalized and to 
help out people who are in jail on marijuana 
possesion charges.
<evilive> that is pretty much all about the group that 
i know of so far..  other then that they are going to 
be writing articles for us... next question.. 
> Have you ever been in trouble from the authorities 
for your zine? or relating to?
<evilive> I used to be afriad of that.  But everything 
we write is protected under the constitution.  I have 
once gotten in trouble for plagurizm..  but it was a 
honest mistake so nothing happend.. just had to give 
the man credit in the next issue.
> how many people are currently writing for ganja?
<evilive> there are about 25 active ones...  17 listed 
in the member list..
<evilive> but they come and go.. there are only a few 
that have actually been with us since the very 
beginning.
> What responses have you gotten from ganja, good or 
bad, from whoever
<evilive> both.. some people take us too seriously.. we 
are doing this for fun..  i ofcourse get calls from 
people calling us worthless drug addicts, etc..  but 
there are probably 100 positive remarks for every 1 
negative....  we have outlived alot of the groups 
that we going around the time we started..  people 
told me we didnt have a chance.. but it had never 
been done before
<evilive> there was never a group that was 100% based 
on drugs and getting loaded..  so i said what the 
hell..   it took about 4 months before people 
actually noticed the mag out there. from there it 
just took off..
<evilive> i used to have to work so hard back then just 
to release anything..  now I just sit back and let 
everyone else do the work..
> What are your opinions about other zines out now? any 
favorites?
<evilive>  I dont really read any of the others out 
there..  some are soo juvinile and immature it drives 
me nuts..
<evilive> i never have thought that ganja fits into the 
`zine` scene..
> ahh..
<evilive> and it never really fit into the h/p/a 
scene... it was really all by itself for some 
reason..   there is no drug scene as of yet..  there 
are lots of calls i get of people that are..
> Which issue did you get in trouble for plagurizm?
<evilive> going to start their own drug magz..  but 
none of them can really find anything on drugs that 
we havent already released..  and they know they will 
be shot down for duping our releases..  we keep 
releasing new unthought of material...  I mean we 
will never run out of material..
<evilive> I got in trouble for duping a mushroom 
growing article by mescalito ted..  he called and was 
very upset..  I got to talking to him and he is now 
our best writer..
<evilive> his stuff is simply amazing..  he is a 
genius..
> What is your opinion on your writers?
<evilive> I asked him on a simple article to make DMT 
from philaris grass..  a simple legal grass you can 
buy.. the next day he calls with one of the best 
articles we have released..
<evilive> I think the writers try real hard to get what 
i want done....  I mean i cant release everything 
from them, some stuff i get is just shit..
<evilive> without the writers ganja wouldnt be around..
> any stuff youd like to ad while i think up another 
question?
> :)
<evilive> hrm....
<evilive> it is such a pity that tim leary died... 
R.I.P...
> who's tim leary? pardon for me asking
<evilive> He was a pro-drug professor.... the man 
preached, `Free your mind with LSD`..
> do you run a bbs?
> or have a distro bbs? or is that shit in the new 
ganja?
<evilive> yeah.. black opium..  701-523-5909..  runs 
amiga-express on a old amiga...
<evilive> yeah its all in the issues.. :)
> ohh ok, nuf said
<evilive> cheers! :)
> Tell me a little about evilive
> Nonono, i didnt mean bye :)
<evilive> ahh! :) ok sure no problem. girlfriend is 
sleeping anyways..
> And maybe some of your opinions on today's society
> bill clinton, etc..
<evilive>  A little about me...  well lets see..  you 
could say i had a small drug problem for 6 years..
> What drugs did you try?
<evilive> shit..  anything you can name.. i quit alot 
of them.... I used to be stoned all day.. everyday..  
people in ganja would call me up and I would always 
be having a party at my house..
> hmm.. if you had a drug _problem_ why are you putting 
together a mag that supports drug use?
<evilive> i was drunk for 28 days.. in february..
> by the way.. im just asking that.. im not one of 
those people "family men" type
<evilive> well..
> I still love ganja :)
<evilive> you know..  thats is a good question..
<evilive> my girlfriend made me stop using that shit..
<evilive> sounds dumb, but i was a mess..
<evilive> so i mean..  who says i will never smoke 
agian.. infact i smoked today. :).. I just dont do it 
as often..
> ok, so you believe to legalize, but people should use 
it moderatly? like drinking perhaps?
> or not?
<evilive>  I really dont give a shit if it is legal or 
not.. I have always been able to get weed cheap.... 
and if it is illegal it adds to the fun you know.
<evilive> what is your zine again??
> What does it feel like when you are "high". have you 
tripped as much as you see things?
> TiA: Trapped in Absence
> coming soon! :)
<evilive>  sure..  last week i went to another city to 
visit my old friends..
<evilive> it was soo crazy, we got ripped.. high as 
shit.. and i had to drive.. you know.. I got onto the 
freeway.. and i turned a corner.. and i saw my hand 
just spinning around the steering wheel like 500 
times.. it was so nuts.. I also thought i was going 
to hit wild dogs..   
<evilive> i locked up my brakes going 70 MPH for a 
imaginary wild pig in the road also..  kinda a bad 
trip..
<evilive> oh wait..
> what techniques do you recommend for smoking dope?
> i havnt had a bad trip yet.. guess im lucky
> ok..
<evilive> I like the grafix double chamber bong with 
sliding carb.. buy then at your local head shop for 
$39.. and make sure you buy grafix..
<evilive> trust me.. it filters your buds pretty good..
<evilive> i didnt change the bong water in mine for 6 
months.. it was like black toothpaste TAR.. and my 
friend scopped it out with a spoon and ate 3 
tablespoons of it..
<evilive> he started to have a irregular heart beat.. 
we took him to the hospital and he had to wear a 
heart monitor for 3 weeks.. :)
> holy shit dude!#
<evilive> just because he drank the bad bong water
> damn.. all that thc and shit in the water?
<evilive> he turned real pale...  puked all over.. we 
thopught he was going to die..  we laughed sooo much 
because we were soo high.
> woah.. potent stuff :)
<evilive> i dont know what is in it.. but everytime 
someone i know has drank it.. they freak out..  dont 
drink bong water..
> ok, thats a tip from evil. DONT DRINK BONG WATER 
KIDDIES
> :)
<evilive>  that bong water will fuck you up..
<evilive> you know there is a ganja senior member that 
just jumped into #ganja.. maybe you want to join and 
ask both of us questions.. he has been with ganja 
since the very beginning
> heh.. btw, is there an app gen in your zip of the 
last ganja?
<evilive> shit he is lagged to hell...
> Im running out of things to ask.. shit.. you caught 
me off guard in #zines :)
<evilive> i dont read apps anyways..  i dont want to 
know anything about my writers..  they just send me a 
article and if it is good. they are in the group.. 
> hey.. when i get better questions can i email them to 
you?
<evilive> sorry bout that.. what was the last question?
> when i get better questions can i email them to you?
> ^^^ that was it :)
<evilive> ahh.. i dont have a email address...
> ohh ok.. ill just catch you on irc some time and dcc 
them to you?
