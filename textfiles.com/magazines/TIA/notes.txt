
Dear TiA reader,


        As I find myself having less and less spare time for writing TiA, I 
have decided to release TiA in a "1 article 1 issue" format. This is so you
can get TiA asap and not wait for 2 months for me to release a whole issue.
As I get more writers I might change formats. But for now, it's going to be
like this. Oh and.. err... The later TiA's should be better than 1 or 2.
More emotional and better all together.. Sorry about the delay ppl. :(
