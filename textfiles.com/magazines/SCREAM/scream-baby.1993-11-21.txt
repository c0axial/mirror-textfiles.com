    It was obvious. Months were passing in between issues of Scream Baby and
    once again I was bored with my creation.  So I think, what could
    re-spark my interest?

    How about a weekly format?

                    more "news"?

                            less anger?

                                    more personal?

                                                            Ok.  Let's see.

    I plan to sit down every Sunday evening, and spend 2 hours or so to see
    what I can come up with.  I ain't making no promises, though.

    As far as writer's submissions go, don't take the "fuck you" mentioned
    in the "Find Out Why They Call Me Stumpy" issue personally. There is not
    a week that goes by where I don't see at least one "I'm starting a zine,
    so send me contributions!" message from somone who will never be heard
    from again.  If you can't fill at least 20+ pages on your own before
    having to resort to contributions, then maybe you don't have anything
    worth mentioning.  Maybe I'll change the policy to "don't waste my
    time", but for now, I have to keep at least one indecent word in each
    issue of Scream Baby, simply for the purpose of triggering any and all
    corporate filter programs.

    What I love about N6 is not necessarily the information presented, but
    rather the attitude. Clearly present is a commitment to using technology
    in innovative ways to communicate, to explore, and to create.  So
    whenever one comes face-to-face with the sheer stupidity of mainstream
    bullshit you want to scream with anger and rage until you choke up that
    hairball, and you can go back to saying, "this is cool, this is cool,
    and this is cool......"

    Premiere Issue : Gutter-Tech

    Editorial on low-tech & Generation X; news blurbs on technology;
    instructions on commiting suicide on the same page with a contest and
    call for entries on stalking celebrities; a reprinted post from
    alt.satanism on how Closed Caption decoders are actually an attempt by
    the government to spy on you; Interviews with Jennifer Lynch (director
    of Boxing Helena), John Bergin (graphic artist, musician, Bonesaw, The
    Crow), Chemlab, and Christ Gore (editor of Film Threat); reviews of
    cyberpunk music, videos, books, software, computer graphics, and digital
    demos.

    Nexus Six sent free copies of their premiere issue to anyone who
    responded to an advertisement placed on newsgroups and mailing lists. No
    more free premiere issues are available. The cover price is listed at
    $2. No subscription information is listed, but future news stand
    distribution is hinted at.


    UNPLASTIC NEWS BOUNCES BACK!

    The editor of Unplastic News sent me e-mail, saying that the "Ugly"
    Issue would be out soon.  Last we heard from Todd was in April, where he
    was planning to head cross country and set up in California.  If you
    don't know what Unplastic News is, then your e-zine history is missing
    some holes.  Check out back issues at etext.archive.umich.edu. [And if
    you don't know that this ftp site is the major hub for e-zine
    distribution.....well you do now.]

    Unplastic News can now be reached at tt2@well.sf.ca.us.


    HENRY : PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER

    Henry is a serial killer whose method to escape being caught by the
    police is not to set up a modus operandi. So you stab one, strangle
    another, use a .45 on one, an electric drill on another. It's not that
    you can't use a gun, it's that you don't use the same one twice. This
    advice Henry gives to Otis, his roommate, a gas station attendant on
    parole who deals marijuana to high school students and who ends up
    raping his sister, Becky, who moved in with Henry and Otis to escape
    from a history of sexual abuse, her husband Leroy (now on bond for
    $1 million for murder, and having left her daughter with her mother to
    move to the big city of Chicago, get a job washing hair in a beauty
    salon.

    You don't really care.

    Bleak, boring, and degrading, unlike......


    JOHNNY MARR MURDER CAN BE FUN 1994 CALENDAR

    If you're planning to buy someone a calendar for Chri$tmas, then you
    might consider the Johnny Marr Murder Can Be Fun 1994 Calendar.  Each
    date contains information about homicides, suicides, serial killers,
    natural disasters, etc. in a well researched, no nonsense manner.

    I'd give you contact information, but I can't find my copy.  It's around
    here somewhere.  I bought mine at Bookstop, a major chain bookstore, so
    it should not be that hard to find.

    I still think a computer version, with dates going back for the last
    five years, is a really great idea.



                            SUBSCRIBERS STRIKE BACK!

    Here are some of the responses I received to last weeks questionnaires,
    as well as some new subscription requests.  Note that most have been
    edited, so that only the interesting sections remain.  Even then, I'm
    suspicious about some, or whether I will do this again............


    > Question 3 -- Henry Rollins
    >
    >         Savage street poet or heavy metal butthead?

    When I was seventeen this guy was a hero of mine, because he was my
    introduction to shock value (you know, spit-roasting little girls in the
    back yard?) and all that, but lately, he's just a whiner.  Musically,
    anyway.  I think of a really grotesque and tacky Beauty and the Beast.
    His next album will be called "Poor Fucking Me, the Screaming Album, Part 25."

    And of course the true irony is that he smirked at the mere mention of
    Morrissey on Mtv...Morrissey, who at least can sing.

    Also, Rollins thinks he's saving the world by telling the Mtv generation
    to listen to real music, like John Coltrane.  Rollins, who has *none* of
    the integrity of John Coltrane.

    Okay, I sort of like that song "Do It."

    Just thought I'd answer five out of six of your essay questions, just because
    I need to get up reasonably early tomorrow and it's late already.


    1 - The outcome of Gabriel Garcia Marquez replacing William Gibson on The
    Difference Engine - Dr. Cat buys a copy and reads it.  He loves anything to
    do with Charles Babbage, but possesses an irrational, rabid prejudice against
    anything associated with William Gibson.

    2 - Cybroganics/cyberganics/cyberorganics/however-Paco-spells it: "We have
    invented a new word, to show that we are even hipper than those that find the
    newest invented words of others and parrot them.  We will not tell you what
    it means, because we weren't cool enough to make up that part really, but
    don't want to give ourselves away."   neotribalism - "we actually stumbled
    onto something that's of real significance but we don't understand it so we
    just toss around a lot of jargon about it.  we only found it because we
    jabber about ALL weird new things we hear about, and we really aren't aware
    which are the significant ones.  We think the brain-wave altering goggles are
    just as important as neo-tribalism, what do we know?"

    3 - Henry Rollins.  Never heard of him.  But hey, is there really any
    difference between the two categories you listed?

    4 - Please somebody get a discussion going about making an alt.cyberpunk.slag.
      Some of the dumb kids that call themselves cyberpunks haven't been kept
    busy enough by their own dumb newsgroups to stay out of the ones I like, and
    maybe if they had one more new group it would help.

    5 - The Well is destroyed...  Of the 99%+ of netizens who never once logged
    onto the Well, 6% shift from thinking "The Well is probably cool/lame" to
    thinking "The Well WAS probably cool/lame".  The other 93% continue to
    periodically think "Oh, I don't really have the time/money to check out the
    Well for myself", and continue to think of it as either cool or lame
    indefinitely, as the frequency with which comments about it appear here and
    there seems to remain about the same as it had been before.

    No answer for number six, as I'm not Kibo.  (Or am I?)

    Question -- Who are you?

    I am a hazardous waste manager with the California Institute of
    Technology. My job also includes radioactive materials and safety. The
    job very rarely gets boring! I'm also a full time student majoring in
    industrial hygiene.

     I'm a physicist, undergrad, Brunel University. At the moment I'm trying to
     understand what reality is and it's lotsa fun being able to speak the
     language.

     I love travelling, I've lived in the UK, India and the Middle East as well as
     over to the States a few times. I'll see ya there next summer.

     Now I wanna know what/who you are and what's the deal ? I managed to find
     one issue to S.B. and it's got...hmmm I dunno yet but I wanna.

     I love reading and that includes fiction, sci fi especially and history.

     One cultural artifact worth your time huh ? Well no specific recommendations
     but find out what the Spanish Civil War was, "A Homage to Catalonia" Orwell.

     And remember the next time you watch " A Clockwork Orange" you're seeing my
     campus and this bleeding computer center most of the time.  It ain't funny.

     also I want a reply from you, not some automailer.
