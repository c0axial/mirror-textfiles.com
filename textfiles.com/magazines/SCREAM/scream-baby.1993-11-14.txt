    AXCESSerpt : Ice-T interview

    Q: So you've got a book coming out.

    I-T: Got a book coming out.  Book is called _The Ice Opinion, Who Gives
    a Fuck?_ and it's done. It's a compilation of all my interviews but it's
    done like one big long meeting -- speaking on topics : education, you
    know, race. religion, sex, ghetto mentality...and it's like at the end
    of each chapter it says "Well, that's my opinion on education, who gives
    a fuck?"  Because it's not supposed to be taken as so important, it's
    just, "Yo, this is how I feel about it"

    ....it's like one stop shopping for Ice-T, you know what I'm saying. So
    you could be sitting up and having a real hot argument about something
    and say "let's see what the fuck Ice says." Then you read it and you
    say, "Ice is a fucking asshole." Then take it from there. And somebody
    says, "fuck you, man, he had a point there".

    Question 1 -- Alternative Literature History

            Suppose that instead of William Gibson, _The Difference Engine_
            was co-written by Bruce Sterling and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
            (Nobel Prize winner for _100 Years of Solitude_; also well-known
            for _Love in the Time of Cholera_).

            Describe the outcome of this literary coupling.


    Question 2 -- Pacoidspeak Translator <tm>

            The latest issue of Fringeware Review makes heavy use of the
            phrase "cyberorganics".  Free subscription to anyone who can
            translate into English whatever the hell Jon and Paco are
            talking about.

            Alternative selection : neo-tribalism.


    Question 3 -- Henry Rollins

            Savage street poet or heavy metal butthead?


    Question 4 -- alt.cyberpunk.slag

            Write a RFD for alt.cyberpunk.slag, a special place in
            cyberspace set aside for those who have nothing better to do but
            mutter inane variations of _________ sux.  I think there should
            be a place for all the cyberpunk parasites to leech together.

            Bonus :  Top 10 List of fab alt.cyberpunk.slag topics.

                    Starters :  Billy Idol *sux*
                                MTV *sux*
                                Mondo 2000 *sux*
                                Wired *sux*
                                Fortress *sux*
                                Tribe *sux*

    Question 5 -- Alternative Cyberspace Utopians

            Suppose that the Well is destroyed and all hosts and moderators
            are dragged into the streets for public execution.

            Extrapolate.


    Question 6 -- For Kibo only.

            James, what are you wearing right at this moment?

                               SUBMISSION POLICY

    Fuck you.  Start your own damn e-zine.  I've made it to issue eight
    without your sorry ass, what makes ya think I need you now?  Writers
    guidelines?  You want writer's guidelines? Go submit to one of those
    e-zines that are constantly whining for submissions to cover up for
    the lack of talent, iniative, and material of their own. I don't have
    time to deal with you posers, and would rather go months before I
    publish something I'm not going to be totally embarassed about later.
    Here's my advice, straight from Mike Monteiro, a.k.a. Nervous Dog,
    a.k.a. X-Girlfriend Graphix :

                     "Giving up is fine" -- Mike Monteiro.

    You can thank me later.

    Oops!  Outta time boyz and grrrllls.  What with the headers and legal
    warnings and indices and subscription information and disclaimer after
    disclaimer after disclaimer, there is just no more room for content in
    the e-zine world.

    Not that anyone has the attention span to read this far.......

    Maybe more next week.
