              \  \
Once again, all\  \little cyber-buddies, it's time for another issue of
_Scream Baby_.  \  \ow that I told some of ya that this would be the Public
Enemy theme issue\  \t since making that statement I have discovered that I
really don't have \  \attention span to do a theme issue.  Go figure.
                   \  \
Actually, I've notic\  \hat my attention span has been getting shorter and
shorter as the nights\  \w longer.  In conversations I can barely stay on
topic for longer than \  \minutes before wanting to jump track and follow some
tangent.               \  \
                        \  \
Good thing I've already g\  \ated.....else there might be trouble.
                          \  \
Before we get grooving, let\  \apologize for the condition of this issue.  I
carelessly left the master c\  \of _Scream Baby_ lying around and one of my
friend's four year old tried \  \ake Halloween decorations out of it.
Scissors and small children do\  \mix!  Anyway, I tried to tape it up, best I
could, but only had a roll of e\  \rical tape available.  Hope it doesn't
cause any confusion....         \  \

a cool psychadelic poster of fractals.  Wher\  \d you get it?

The se/  / board also only transmits about 98% of the information properly.

I asked Ed Cavazos, the Vice President of the loc|   |stin chapter of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation to investigate.  H|   |covered a surreptious
Control-Z character appended to the end of the fi|___|hich is, in his own
words, "a big Internet no-no."  Old versions of DOS used the Control-Z
character as a marker for archiving files.

Was I using an old version of DOS?

3.3.  Nope.  I was using a version of PFS: Write with a copyright date of
1986, however, and so the report concluded that the word processor is
automatically adding the Control-Z to the end of the files and that there is
nothing else to be done about it.

Only in Austin will you find someone with a tatoo of the international symbol
for recycling.  Paco told me that it was "instructions in case someone
finds my body.  They'll know what to do with it."  Paco Xander Nathan is the
Technology Consciousness Editor for bOING-bOING, an increasingly regular
contributor to Mondo 2000, a programmer (MenStat & probably more), but is
probably best described as "the guy with all the cool brain toys"

Scream Baby caught up with Paco following the EFF-Austin Public Forum : The
Hacker Crackdown, a speech and book signing by Bruce Sterling.  Here is an

   PXN:  Hi.  My name is\  \o Nathan/  / actually  _Wired_ may be an
         interesting maga\  \ but _/  /o_ is going to sneak up on everyone in
         the real near fut\  \    /  /
                           \  \  /  /
                            \  \/  /         [Bruce had taken a quick jab at
                             \ /  /            Mondo during the Q&A session]
                              /  /
Scream:  That might be a litt/  / \ ed opinion there.
                            /  /\  \
   PXN:  Actually that's so/  /ns\  \ info.
                          /  /    \  \
Scream:  Oh. Can you give/  /some i\  \er info about the next issue of
         _Mondo_?       /  /        \  \
                       /__/          \__\
   PXN:  Oh sure.  Which one?  The one that is coming out in about two days?

Scream:  TWO DAYS?!?!

   PXN:  Seeing as I wrote a lot of it.           ___
                                                 /  /
Scream:  TWO DAYS?!?!  REALLY?                  /  /
                                               /  /
   PXN:  Well no, it will probably be coming o/  /bout next week or so.  We're
         really on the print deadline right n/  /..I have a biotech piece in
         it and a few other pieces as well. /  /
                                           /  /
Scream:  Is it as glossy?  The last issue /  /le talked about it taking a
         "step down" from being heads in /  /clouds.
                                        /  /
   PXN:  Yeah.  I think what's happenin/  / that some of the art staff is
         really congealing and startin/  / come in to their own, and hitting
         their prime.  I think the co/  /of the last issue is just primo
         compared to what's been hap/__/ng before.

Scream:  What's going to be on the cover?

   PXN:  I was down at the offices a few weeks ago and I can't talk about it.
                                   ___
Scream:  Oh come on.  I've got to h|  |inside information in each issue [of
         _Scream Baby_] and the onl|  |ing I'm sitting on now is that the
         manager of Public Enemy is|  |ting together a rap version of
         Lollapalooza.  That's the |  | thing I'm sitting on right now. I need
         more.                     |  |
                                   |  |
   PXN:  Inside information on _Mon|  |is just that there is a lot of fresh
         blood and it's going a lot|  |e technical.  We are talking about
         bringing in a lot more you|  |, less-known writers who are actually
         right now in the technolog|  |d I think this is going to make a big
         change because these aren'|  |ople who are esconsed in post-
         modernism.  These are peop|  |ho are living in the tech and I think
         that will make some change|  |I think that the art stuff is really
         pulling in tight.  The big|  | thing that is happening right now of
         course is that the circula|  | is just booming because of Walden
         books and things like that|  |nd of course Mondo also has a new host
         __________________________|  |_______________________________________
        |_____________________________________________________________________
Scream: You're the new Mondo host?  You and Jon [Lebkowsky]?

   PXN:  Yeah, Jon and Sirius and I.

Scream: Is R.U. Sirius coming to Austin for a book signing tour?

  PXN:  We've been talking about that.  I'm one of the few people trying to
\       negotiate that here in Austin.  It's just up in the air.... there's
 \      definitely at least one person here willing to host it.
  \
\  \    [wandered into a discussion of local Austin counter-culture scene.
 \  \   Named names!  Told other businesses how to run their jobs! Hyped those
  \  \  who we like!  Dissed those who we don't!  Who is going to lease that
   \  \ sombrero-topped-restaurant on the Drag?  A New Edge store in Austin?
    \  \I've said too much]
     \  \
  PXN:\  \think that a lot of the New Edge community here in Austin is
       \  \lusive.  Here in Austin it's very large, but it's very exclusive.
        \  \ou're not part of the in-thing, you're not part of it at all.  The
        E\  \side is just so damn bifurcated how can you consider it to be
        ex\  |ive?  Why is you have to wear black in order to be part of the
        in-\ |wd?  You can't define it.  You have radical feminists over here/
        and \|ople who are sawing off their arms and putting on electronics /
        over here and it's all part of the same thing.....                 /
                                                                          /  /
        I've just finished some work on wear-ables right now.  I don't ha/  /
        any units to work on but hopefully pretty soon.  And when we do /  /
        be doing a party like [see bOING-bOING #9].  Wearable computers/  /t's
        my big kick right now. I really think there's going to be a lo/  /
        happening with wearables.  I've been talking with too many pe/  / who
        are going to market right now.                              /  /
                                                                    |  |
Scream: What's a wear-able?                                         |  |
                                                                    |  |
   PXN: A wearable is when you take a laptop, gut it, and make it in|  |
        basically about 3 or 4 pounds.  There are people who have it|  |n to 7
        chips, with 100 meg.  Serious 386 machines.                 |  |
                                                                    |  |
Scream: What was the parody I saw once...........keyboard chaps?    |  |
                                                                    |  |
   PXN:  I think it's going to turn something inside out...You talk |  |he VR
         people and the VR people are beating each other over the he|  |ver
         reality emergences and how it can be effective and how many|  |les
         can take the bandwidth.                                    |__|

Scream:  That's one point I wanted to make about Bruce's speech was that the
         military is a major support of VR.  That without the military there
         would be no VR industry.

   PXN:  I'm going to jump out of the field right now and play devil's
         advocate.  I think right now that a lot of the emergence stuff is
         just bullshit.  I think you and I already have realities.  And I
         think that if you go into more of the computer augmented overlay.  To
         be able to have something projected out so I'm looking at you and so
         I can be updated at the same time.

Scream:  Random mindsplatter.  Now you can see why Scream Baby is like it is.
         I can't keep on-topic for longer than five minutes.  I have just
         ordered a copy of Wax....[discussion of bringing Wax to Austin]...on
         Monday and I'm just upset that it's not here yet.  I want my
         information faster than that.  One of the ideas I had while thinking
         about David Blair....the technology already exists to do what he
         did...... ____hen are there not more people doing it?
                   \   \
   PXN:  You would b\   \zed at how accessible technology is.  You can walk
         down to Radi\   \ck....I don't know what your expertise in circuits
         is right now.\   \
                       \   \
Scream:  Zerooooo.  Big \   \ng zero.
                         \   \
   PXN:  You can buy a boo\   \t will show you how to do really interesting
         circuits that sell\   \$2.39. Anyone can just walk in with a grammar
         school education an\   \rt wiring circuits.  Why don't people do it.
                             \   \
Scream:  There is a certain le\   \f technical knowledge a lot of people jump
         in and start hacking i\.  \ lot of people do it, a lot of people
         don't.  A lot of people\   \t understand the technology that
         surrounds them.  This is\   \ght up mostly in _Zen And The Art of
         Motorcycle_.  They don't \   \how it works as long as the food is hot
         when it comes out of the m\  /wave.  Push a button, and that's it.
         That's all you need to know\/ And that's one of the ironies that as
         technology becomes more commonplace, your understanding of it
         decreases.

   PXN:  I don't know, I kind of play counterpoint.  I think overall, if you
         look at a cross section, yeah, but I think for individuals as it
         becomes more commonplace it starts to fuse together...

Scream:  Tech is more specialized. 100-150 years ago, something in your house
         broke you could fix it.  You could repair it. Now there's [hardly]
         anything in your house you can fix yourself anymore.

   PXN:  It bubbles through so.  A lot more of the weird specialized functions
         are being offloaded into th___oftware.  So if you understand what the
         hell an RS 232 port is and|   |understand how to debug software you
         certainly can fix a lot mo|   |ings that used to be little
         specialized black boxes th|   |u would never have a clue about how to
         keep up.  It kinda bubbles|   |t and goes through stages of being
         very esoteric and very sta|   |ized.
                                   |   |
Note:  At this point in the convers|___|, Mike Mooney, of the alternative rock
       band None of the Above, breaks in and offers an analogy involving time
       travel and a toaster.  Which probably was great, except he spoke so
       softly that the tape didn't pick it up.  There's a lesson involving
       media hipness in there somewhere.

                \/              PHOTO PORTRAIT

Ever since I saw the photos for Suffer Trough, a local campus radio show, I've
been aching to do something similar for _Scream Baby_.  Essentially this would
be a portrait of me in a bleak, dreary urban landscape making some sort of
vague socio-political point.  This would also be a "I'll show me mine if you
show me yours" type of deal.  I'll give it away free to subscribers who send
in a photo of themselves and a SASE.  Else it costs money.

an artist.  [If that was *really* the case, though,|   | stop dressing like
the Beasties Boy, an identifying mark of Austin art|   | With a Masters in
Fine Arts from The University of Texas at Austin, h|   |ks at Kinko's Copies.
Once, he ran a T-shirt transfer through the machine|   |wing that it would
leave an impression on the rollers.  Then he copied|   |reds of resumes,
imprinting "I have a felony conviction" on the back|   |ight ink.  When
confronted, he pleads that he didn't know that woul|___|pen and was very
sorry.  He still works there.  MacNervousboy is a collection of his art
information converted to computer format.  Gifs, Quicktime movies, pranks, art
for fucking around sakes, stuck on a disk and sent to stodgy magazines for
re:view.  MacNervousboy.  Nervousboy has agreed to think about it.

                JOHNNY MARR MURDER CAN BE FUN COMPUTER CALENDAR

Those damn "Today in History" calendars are *everywhere*.  I hate them.  Don't
get mad, subvert!  Johnny Marr is the force behind a little zine called Murder
Can Be Fun, which is a light-hearted look at murder, mayham, death, and
destruction.  Last year he created a calendar that listed, for each day, some
such gruesome feat.  Birthdays of mass murderers, quotes, accidents, that sort
of thing.  I've been meaning to w_____to him and ask to create a computer
version of this year's calendar,/    /'s compiling one.  I've already secured
an IBM program, and have leads /    / Macversion.  I bet there's a damn Today

Hi Mom!  This option is mostly for her benefit.  I know she is somewhat
disappointed that her son-with-the-college-degree-who-she-went-through-8-
hours-of-labor-for has yet to break the $10,000 a year salary barrier.  I came
*real* close last year.  Essentially I would like to study in a Society and

University of Texas at Austin, about a 3.2 my last two years, and a combined

who rules over a house of puppets.  The show is essentially a variety show for
people with short attention spans : claymation, musicals, singing, magic, talk
show, anti-drug messages, and lots and lots and lots of puppets!  We almost
burnt down my house in the first episode.  I already have produced a treatment
for the episode, we'd need to secure equipment such as a Video Toaster or
similar effects editor and we'd also need to secure a big heaping dose of
motivation.  Your vote for the HR Puffinstuff of the Underground, perhaps?
