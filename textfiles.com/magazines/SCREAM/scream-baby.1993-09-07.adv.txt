So like R. Patrick Jones puts out this hip e-zine called Drum, a cut-up
collage involving the medical effects of psychopharmaceuticals,
Generation X revolution rants, images, magik, mescaline, and mdma, all
under the general homage of information as drug, information as altered
reality.

<woof>

So like there is a space at the bottom for people to insert their own
text and then ship it off, so I'm like, yeah, gonna do it. So the first
thing I include is this shameful exploitive blurb pimping a porno film.
Go figure.  Another parody of software licensing restrictions,
subscription information, tips for wanna-be ezinesters, Reservoir Dogs,
Fringeware Review, and the usual litany of disturbing, fragmented,
pull-no-punches quotes and sayings.

The Hum Drum issue.

                             BABY GOT BACK ISSUES

There are so many easy and fun ways to get current and back issues of Scream
Baby, there is really no excuse for anyone not to have their very own copy.


                           You Are Number Six

includes a Legal Disclaimer, Subscriber Information, ediborial on
cyberpunk e-zines, Interview with David Blair (creator of _Wax_), news about
Agrippa : The Book of the Dead, and reviews of Stephen Seagal's Under Siege,
the Cyberart Gallery in Sin magazine, Sound Photosynthesis catalog, Neal
Stephenson's Snow Crash, the video arcade game Lethal Enforcer, and the zine
Gray Areas.

I also was struck by some sort of virus that attached shameful and degrading
text to the end of this issue: information about Apartmentopia, a New Edge
apartment complex and a Q&A column by Blade X Lax, "the cyberpunk's cyberpunk"

                              Leri-L Issue

By day Scotto is the list moderator of the Leri-L Mailing List. By night, he
secretly aims for net.personality.dom.  As guest editor of Scream Baby, his
wildest fantasies are unleashed. In addition to Scotto's writings, we have
contributions by @rez on Hypertexture, an excerpt from Rheingold's _A Slice of
Life in the Virtual Community_, Andy Hawks, and many more little mind altering
blips of information interspersed throughout.

                      The Talking Raven Re:review

Starts with a review of Antero Alli's Talking Raven : The Journal of
Imaginative Trouble and then it just kinda........decays.  Frankly, I
don't know what the hell I was talking about or meant to say, but am
quick to cover my ass by labeling it "experimental" and "gonzo".
<shrugs shoulders>  Shotgun splatter approaches to reality sometimes end
up....messy.  I apologize for nothing.

                             The Torn Issue

The master copy of this issue was accidently left unguarded in the same room
as a small four year old child who had access to a pair of scissors. I taped
it back together, best I could, but could only find electrical tape. In
between you'll find such things as K-Mart Stocks Fractals, Transmission Error,
Baby Got Back Issues, an X-change with Paco Xander Nathan (Technology and
Consciousness Editor for bOING-bOING & Mondo, owner of Fringeware, all-around
groovy guy), and a new subscriber information / poll.

                     The Andy Hawks Interview issue

Software License Agreement, Subscription Information, an ediborial, review of
Public Enemy, _Greatest Misses_, and an interview with Andy Hawks, creator of
the Future Culture mailing list and FAQ, conducted by Jagwire X, creator of
the Autopia project and soon-to-be-started zine, Sun Dog.

                        The September 26th, 1992 Issue

Every word written in a 24 hour period, fueled by rage, nervousness, and
caffeine.  Ediborial, Subscription information, Software Licensing Agreement,
A Tribute to Isaac Asimov, A Tribute to Isaac Asimov part 2, List of Cultural
Artifacts, and reviews of bOING-bOING, Bruce Sterling, Ministry, NiN, Malcolm
X (audio-tape), Mark Leyner's _Et tu, babe_, Negativland, and the Cop Killer
controversy
