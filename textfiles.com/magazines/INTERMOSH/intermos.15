** ANNOUNCEMENT **

This will be the the LAST INTERMOSH! (wish this thing had a delayer for
dramatic effect right about now)... ok let me go into detail, this will be
the last newsletter as Intermosh.. as of next week (note: we will be
posting after the Thanksgiving holiday) we will be:

Screams of Abel - E (for Screams of Abel Electronic) - the electronic
version of my magazine Screams of Abel.. 

And with the name change comes a new and exciting format: INTERVIEWS! Yes
we will have band interviews once a month along with demo and album
reviews and info on how to get them.. and a classified section for other
cool zines (especially my own! heh)

We will continue to cover the BRUTAL Godly stuff (power metal, gothic
metal, death metal, thrash, grindcore, industrial metal, speed metal,
hardcore, anything else brutal).. 

Also: Arthur Marsh has been sooooo kind to capture SOA-E and Intermosh
newsletters onto CCMRADIO, a Fidonet echo conference.. and Phil Burt
(burtp@rpi.edu) has back issues of I 1-14 available.. and after next week
we will be available via anonymous FTP... Isn't God like majorly awesome!!!

Sooo.. thanx to Steve Drees for the cool new name (congrats dude!),
Arthur, Paul and Phil B. for the help!

Now, onto the news.....

** The News **

Rez will be playing shows in January and February in Germany and the
Netherlands.. Crashdog will be playing in Muskegon and Traverse City MI in
January..

the lead singer of Transcendence called me at work this morning.. NO, he
isn't Midnight formerly of Crimson Glory as the hot rumor mill spread..
HOWEVER, Sean Vargas (the lead singer of Transcendence) did inform me that
he once auditioned for a band Midnight also auditioned for - Manta Ray..
in the meantime Transcendence has a new demo out in the vein between Holy
Soldier and Haven, and they will also be playing out next year.. 

Oh and to make it even more confusing, Transcendence is from Ft. Worth TX,
the same town Midnight lives.. that and the band name might explain the
slight confusion..

Final Judgement will be coming out with another demo by year's end
preceeding their debut album early '93, "Desolating Sacrilege".. look for
an extremely heavy band a la Morgoth and Deicide.. Lust Control has a new
album out, "We Are Not Ashamed" as well as Fluffy, "Go Fluffy Go".. and
Veni Domine's album, "Fall Babylon Fall" is BRILLIANT! One of the best new
albums of '92!!!!

Look for my area (Washington/Baltimore) to be the new center of metal in
'93!  Here is the local lineup: Recluse Chant (one demo by end of
November heavy progressive speed metal), The Risen (demo by end of year,
debut album on A.R.T. Records, distributed by Metal Blade, in February -
brutal death metal), Crown of Thorns (live demo out now of concert at
Lincoln Memorial in DC, more concerts by year's end) and solo metal artist
Michael Law (one demo out now).. also PJ Bussey (formerly of Taker and
Armageddon) is putting together a new band with ex-Corban bassist Mike
Watts and a female singer, supposedly gothic metal.. one gothic and one
commercial metal band are each forming with former members of Blest,
Corban and Divine Wind, a new band from Lanham MD is forming - Everlasting
Revelation (pop metal), and a female guitarist is forming a heavy
gothic/progressive metal band in Bowie MD.. pop and melodic metal bands in
Baltimore are regularly gigging every other weekend, and acclaimed guitar
wizard Michael Bailey is putting a band together of other noted musicians
from the Boston area who are relocating to DC.. 

** Too Odd to Not Print **

A new Christian death metal band in Australia has come out with their
2-sing demo, the band's name is Damnation..

** I didn't make that up! **

Royal Squad is a new metal band from Norway getting material together for
recording soon.. New England death metallers Dry Bones opened for
Sacrament recently in New Hampshire...

Finally, look for a New Year's Eve show with various DC local bands along
with Virginia brutallers Sabaoth and some major acts including B******R

** End of Intermosh **

** Beginning of a New Era with SCREAMS OF ABEL **
