** INTERMOSH VOL. 4 **

  Sept. 9 1992

Welcome back to school you folk! Time for another famous installment of the 
newsletter for the scary people.. oops, let me rephrase that, the 
newsletter for the scared peo.. oh nevermind...

How was your Labor Day weekend? If you were in LA it had to have been loud 
with the Sanctuary Church benefit concert for their 1-800 lines, including 
performances by Tourniquet and Precious Death.. Tourniquet played their 
first tune, "Ark of Suffering", with Eric on vocals (normally on guitar), 
Ted on guitar (normally on drums), Guy on drums (normally vocals), Gary on 
bass (normally guitar) and Victor on guitar (normally bass).  I always 
thought they were out there! :-)

If you were in Chicago for the weekend, did you catch the big celebration 
party for Scizm? Scizm is now a 4-piece heavy progressive thrash band whose 
former drummer, Terry Cvengros, is now full time in Ordained Fate, the 3/4 
female gothic metal band.. and congrats to Terry and wife, guitarist 
Annette for the birth of their baby daughter!

If you were in DC for the weekend, did you see Sabaoth headline a 10-band 
secular death metal show in Virginia? Yes, it's true, at Bender's in 
Manassas Sabaoth, a 5-piece neoclassical death metal (I kid you not! Mix 
George Lynch with Obituary!) played and will be releasing a new demo 
soon...

If you were also in LA this weekend then you heard about the new California 
Metal III album coming out this fall.. all thrash! One of the confirmed 
bands is Judgement - from San Diego, not to be confused with Final 
Judgement from Atlanta...

In other news..

Arbitrage, industrial/death band from near Vancouver (oops, not Seattle, 
sorry folks), has released their second demo entitled "The Healing Power of 
Death".. they told me their influences include Believer, Godflesh, 
Einstzurzende Neubaten (sp?) and Napalm Death.. the Japanese secular metal 
mag Burrrn lists Seventh Angel, "Lament for the Weary" at #24 on the 
Japanese charts while Czech hard rockers Kreyson are at #18 with "Angel on 
the Run", now in English on Flametrader Records.  Burrn (August 1992) also 
has a special feature on Holy Soldier... Believer is currently in the 
studio for their long-awaited third album entitled "Dimensions" according 
to Metal Maniacs Mag (thanx Brody!).. 

OOPS.. the band from Australia is called SIBORIUS not Siborium.. I goofeth 
(like you all had your life pinned on that one!).. 

Sacred Warrior should be releasing their 5th album this fall entitled "New 
World Order", while Bride's new one "Snakes in the Playground" will be out 
Sept. 15 along with Sacrament, "Haunts of Violence"..  Chosen Stranger has 
released their long-awaited second demo with a new bass player, Kevin 
Dunkel.  The new demo is called "Deathwalker".. Overdrive recently replaced 
their drummer and has an interim bassist and only one guitar but will still 
be doing the Battle of the Bands in Lynchburg in October, and look for a 
concert with Oracle in North Carolina soon.. Recluse Chant, DC's 
progressive speed metal band, will be playing at Bender's on Sept. 19 with 
9 other bands in a metal fest, while Sacrament will be playing in Virginia 
Beach on the 19th hopefully with Sabaoth...

Check out the next Intermosh with a late-breaking bulletin on Stryper!!!!
