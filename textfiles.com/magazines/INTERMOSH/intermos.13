** Intermosh vol. 13**
   11/5/92

Ok, I have to make my policital comment.. I sincerely DOUBT Bill Clinton
listens to Living Sacrifice (calm down people, don't stone your own! Ps
133:1, dudes!!), even though LS are from Little Rock (and for those FAQ
lovers, yes it's true that bassist/vocalist DJ's father is a close
personal friend of Clinton but that does NOT mean Living Sacrifice will be
playing the White House anytime soon!) - besides, Clinton probably
couldn't take brutal thrash anyway!

And I would like to address those who claim Clinton is the Antichrist: if
he is, he will be revealed and we won't be here as Christians to worry
about it.  If he isn't, it won't matter, cuz I'm moving to Australia
(anybody wanna put me up for the next 4 years? ;) )!!
