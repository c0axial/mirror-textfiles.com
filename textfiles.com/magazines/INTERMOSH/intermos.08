** INTERMOSH VOL. 8 **
 
   10/2/92 
 
Happy birthday to me! (well, yesterday)... went and talked to the dudes 
in Babylon A.D. (they were interviewed in Heaven's Metal).. turns out 
the whole band are interested in Christianity! And Ron is funny! But 
that's besides the point... it was a cool birthday, and thanx Terry for 
the awesome Birthday Card I DIDN'T GET! AHEM!!! 
 
Anyway..... 
 
Puerto Rican alternative thrash band Nonpoint Factor has their demo 
FINALLY out, "Dementia.. Into Reality", 6 songs not well produced but 
excellently played out and a poster-worthy cover to boot.. get it I 
recommend it highly for $5 to: Nonpoint Factor, c/o Rob, C-F-6-21 Hnas 
Davila, Bayamon PR  00956... not to mention the colorful last song, 
"Based On a True Story" which talks about the L.A. Riots and prejudice 
in their own Puerto Rico.. "..Another Rodney King!" 
 
Also out is the second BRILLIANT (absolutely BRILLIANT) demo by 
Consecrator.. entitled "Image of Deception".. the production is 
exceptional where the cover is kinda plain (see Nonpoint Factor).. 6 
songs that will thrill your techno-thrash side of your brain (the 
cultural side!).  Fans of Believer, Testament, Fate's Warning and the 
like will go ape over this demo! Also check out Consecrator on the 
R.E.X. compilation CD "Demolition"... contract: Consecrator, c/o James 
Chavez, 2114 Yale Ave., Wichita Falls, TX  76304(I think)... 
 
Sacrament will be playing an extra show next week in New Hampshire along 
with Maine this weekend and Burlington VT in 4 days.. check out the new 
issue of Notebored Magazine for up-to-date tour schedules.. 
 
Guardian will be playing dates in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest 
this month and into November... see Notebored for more details.. 
 
Deliverance's "Stay of Execution" is a brilliant masterpiece of work! My 
only problem is "Lord of Dreams" due to its simplistic nature in light 
of the impressive concept behind the lyrics.. ruins the whole song... if 
they kept that tune along the same lines as the music on Side 1 we'd 
have a Deliverance classic... instead we have something that sounds like 
it's off "What A Joke"...  
 
Jet Circus' long awaited album will be out by year's end, their second 
one following "Step On It"... did you know that they recorded an album 
on Riva Records in Germany before they recorded for Wonderland? The 
German import is extremely rare, containing one song not found on "Step 
On It" on Wonderland: "Let's Dance", a rockabilly-meets-Bowie dance 
tune.. the Riva Records' release was called... "Step On It".. .and it 
was also when Jet Circus was a three-piece... 
 
Red Ink's long-awaited release will have pre-releases sent to magazines 
by November.. check future editions of Intermosh for details.. 
 
Golpe Justo is a new hardcore band from Puerto Rico that played with 
Nonpoint Factor at Casa de Teo in Rio Piedras PR on July 24... 
 
That's it for the news! Also don't forget to check out a new power 
rock/psycho-rock band from Kentucky currently playing with Bride... it's 
not White Ray either!
