** INTERMOSH VOL. 6 **

   9/15/92

Was your brain fried after Vol. 5? Imagine TYPING all of that sometime! 
GEESH... onto the news, who needs to hear complaining...

Well... all I got to report is that Bride, "Snakes in the Playground" is 
simply AWESOME!! Guest guitarists on the album include Rick Elias, the 
Newsboys, Ricke Florian from White Heart,Derek Jan from Novella, and Greg 
Martin of the Kentucky Headhunters.. and if you join their fan club you get 
the royal treatment! One CD radio airplay 4-song disk, one tape and an XL 
Bride, "Snakes in the Playground" t-shirt all in a wooden playbox...

In other bits o' news, today's the day! Sacrament, "Haunts of Violence" is 
now available in stores!! Don't forget to check them out in concert as they 
will be thrashin' their way to your hometown real soon-like.. Sept. 18-19 
will see them at the Fire Escape in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and will also 
be the debut of Cephas/Teeth Magazine #1 featuring an interview with 
Sacrament themselves!!!

Also coming out will be the second demo by Final Judgement, the 5-piece 
death/thrash band from Atlanta, and the second demo by Arbitrage, "The 
Healing Power of Death".. 

This weekend also features Sardonyx in concert at Treasures in Mt. Airy, MD 
(Sept. 18), Recluse Chant at Bender's in Manassas - part of a 10-band 
lineup (Sept. 19), Sacred Warrior with Ordained Fate (Scizm a possible 
third band) at Waukegan H.S. in Waukegan IL (Sept. 18) and the "Conquer 
Darkness Festival" in Boergroven Holland with Decision-D, Seventh Angel, 
Fortress, Lucifer's Nightmare and Sculpture (Sept. 18).. and of course, 
there are ALWAYS concerts in L.A.!

Overdrive will be in a "Battle of the Bands" competition in October in 
Lynchburg VA and will later play with NC band Oracle... Bender's in 
Manassas VA is planning a 10-band Christian metal festival with the 
possibilities of Tourniquet, The Crucified, Final Judgement, Sabaoth, 
Recluse Chant and others... (again this is ONLY TENTATIVE until the bands 
contacted confirm - more details coming and look for a possible Halloween 
date)... Virginia death/thrashers Corban will also play a Halloween concert 
in Virginia, and Final Prophecy is scheduled to be sandwiched with Morbid 
Angel and Obituary on Halloween Night in Tampa, partly put together by Rock 
Solid Sanctuary church in Tampa...

Look for Bloodgood to be in your hometown soon, check listings for 
details..

Aren't you glad there are CONCERTS???

In the industrial vein (only the heavy industrial will do!): aside from 
death/tharsh/industrial group Arbitrage, another dude is putting together a 
solo industrial metal/thrash project - Tiavi Rudo, formerly of Spirit 
Child, whose former guitarist, Chris, is the brother of Bill the bassist of 
Zeal whose former guitarist is John Johnson who did a stint with Sacred 
Warrior (aren't you glad you know that?)

That be all.. BIG Stryper update pending REAL SOON! (hint: they got WHO to 
sing for them????)
