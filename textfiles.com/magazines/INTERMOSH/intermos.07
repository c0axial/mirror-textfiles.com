A COOL new metal/thrash radio show in Belgium is Eclairs Metalliques, 
and they need stuff to play! Contact them at: Eclairs Metalliques, BP 
43, B-4432 Alleur BELGIUM... 
 
Arbitrage is this cool new industrial death/thrash band from upper 
Washington State near Canada... they have a new demo along the lines of 
Believer, Godflesh, Einsturzende Neubaten (sp?) and Napalm Death called 
"The Healing Power of Death" and if you wanna find out more contact them

Obedience is a new New York style hardcore Christian band from 
Hagerstown, MD.. they have a demo out "Under God's Strength".. and hey, 
if you love The Crucified, you're gonna go NUTS over Obedience, and 
they're SKINS too! Authentic! Email me for more information... 
 
Vengeance Rising is currently going into the studio for their fifth 
album not yet on any label since leaving Intense Records.. the big buzz 
are 2 bands that played with VR in San Diego a few weeks ago: Nicene and 
Ritual... you'll read more about them later... Mike Grato, who was doing 
the bass work on Deliverance's albums, has left to join Crystavox! 
Distance was a main problem for Mike since he lived near San Diego and 
Deliverance lives just south of L.A. while Crystavox is from S.D. Check 
out Mike's bass work on Deliverance's new album, "Stay of Execution" 
(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!).. Final Warning has regrouped after breaking up 
several times and has a new demo out.. Judgement is still playing out 
and is excited about being on California Metal III, the new compi album 
wayyy overdue on Intense Records, also featuring Precious Death... 
 
Cephas/Teeth Magazine (my mag!!!) is doing quite well and will be 
distributed in places in Stafford, VA, Centreville, VA, Merrifield, VA, 
Glen Burnie, MD, Atlanta, GA and Marshfield, WI... also hoping for 
international distribution in Europe and New Zealand... 
 
Contact us for more info on the mag! #1 has an interview with Sacrament 
and articles on Godhead, DBM and Final Judgement, plus the famous 
Cornerstone '92 Review!! Cephas/Teeth, P.O. Box 2861, Springfield, VA  
22152-2861. 
 
Ragman is a new 2-piece grunge  (!!!) band out from Wilmington, DE with 
their debut 3-song demo out (email me for more info!)... sources have 
told me that Florida grindcore band Royal Anguish has apparently broken 
up...  
 
Living Sacrifice's new album, tentatively entitled "Non-Existence", will 
be out by year's end, produced by Doug Mann instead of Scott Burns due 
to financial reasons.. Greg Minier is NOT leaving The Crucified despite 
ugly rumors! He will be in both The Crucified and his own band - 
Applehead, which is now a full band...  
 
Cephas/Teeth's radio show, "Full Metal Worship", is now syndicated in 
 
Baton Rouge, LA... 
 
More news coming on the Stryper situation (my and my big mouth)... 
 
THE LATEST: Apparently Dale Thompson of Bride was MISQUOTED (by me and 
others, sorry).. he made it clear that he would be available to do SOME 
gigs with Stryper as vocalist, but will NOT join the band since he feels 
called to stay with Bride (thank God!). check out their INCREDIBLE new 
album, "Snakes In The Playground".. GNR WISHES they were that good! 
 
** END OF INTERMOSH ** 
 
Laterz and Be Heaven Bound!
