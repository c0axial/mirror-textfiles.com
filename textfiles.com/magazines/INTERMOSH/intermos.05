** INTERMOSH VOL. 5 **

    9/10/92

What? Another one right after the last one? Well, so much news rolled in 
the past few days I needed more or else I'd have to write a novel! Here we 
go...

German metallers Creed are still around! Significant considering they're 
the oldest Christian metal band in existence, 10 years and still rockin', 
though with band member changes.. bassist Roger Dale Martin leaves Die 
Happy.. former Holy Soldier axeman Michael Cutting joins Love Life.. 
Guardian is working on a new album due out in March 1993 while Ransom will 
be touring the US and have NOT been kicked off Intense Records by a former 
DJ despite the stupid rumors.. Marc Solomon of The Crucified has put 
together his own side band of rap/street stuff called Native Son, and an 
album will be out soon (note: Greg Minier, the Crucified's guitarist, also 
has a side band - Applehead, with its debut album already out).. The Brave 
is a new band and their debut album is out on Pakaderm Records.. 

The "Conquer Darkness" festival will be in the Netherlands on September 18 
with 5 bands: Decision-D, Seventh Angel, Fortress, Lucifer's Nightmare and 
Sculpture.  Sculpture is a new death/thrash band from the Netherlands.. 

Silas Musicworks (King's X, Galactic Cowboys) introduce you to 2 new bands: 
Atomic Opera and Shadoworld.  Atomic Opera features Len Sonnier, brother of 
the Cowboys' guitarist Dane Sonnier, and Shadoworld features Marty Warren 
and Dale Richardson, who have co-written several of King's X tunes.. the 
Cowboys also have a video finally out for "I'm Not Amused", which is 
getting play on MTV's "Headbangers Ball".. 

Texas metallers Paradox are still in existence with Karl Crowther replacing 
Fernando Hernandez on guitar.. Seventh Seal, the all-black metal band from 
California, has been signed to Blonde Vinyl Records and are now working on 
their debut album.  Also expect the debut album by Jesus Freaks, the now 3-
piece speed metal Sacramento band, on Narrowpath Records.  Congrats to Tom 
Denlinger of Sardonyx and his wife Ruth for the birth of their son 
Alexander (guess we can't hang at the "Pig Kitchen" for oranges anymore! 
Inside joke! --ed.).. Vengeance Rising will soon go into the studio for 
their fifth album (no record contract yet), and the big buzz was their 
opening act, Ritual.. 

..and new Tourniquet comes to you soon, and unless you have "Pathogenic 
Ocular Dissonance", you'll have to creep out and get it!

Burrrn Magazine, a Japanese secular rock/metal publication, has done a lot 
for Christian metal this particular issue (Aug. 1992).. Holy Soldier was 
featured in the magazine (previously featured bands include Angelica, 
Sacred Warrior, Whitecross and Jet Circus).. dem Brit dudes Seventh Angel 
charted at #24 on Burrrn's Indie Metal Charts with "Lament For The Weary" 
while Czech pop metallers Kreyson were at #18 with "Angel On The Run", now 
in English on Flametrader Records..

"Ominous Guitarists From The Unknown" is a new secular compi album 
featuring undiscovered guitarists (naturally!) on Shrapnel Records 
including axeman Craig Erickson of Red Sky.. BLOODGOOD IS TOURING!!!! Yes, 
you heard me right, Bloodgood is finally, after nearly 5 years, embarking 
on their US tour starting 9/3 in Wenatchee WA til 10/29 in Santa Clara CA.. 
they will go as far east as NY and PA.. Leviticus' guitarist Bjorn Stigsson 
has put together a new band with the demise of Leviticus - XT. XT also has 
a debut album out in the pop-rock/stadium arena which also features members 
of Jerusalem.. 

NEXT WEEK: The big Stryper update!!!
