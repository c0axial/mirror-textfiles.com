Thanx, all for the barrage of mail... unfortunately only a few of you
understood my request: I wanted to get the number of subscribers per
newsgroup, not the names of each one! Whoa! My mbox almost burst with
responses and it took me a good 1/2 hour to weed thru the messages!

But aside from that, you wanna hear the news, not my ramblings..

Shut up, Scott :-)

And from "Thrashboy" from Nyverdal, The Netherands... a review of the
"Conquer Darkness Festival":

Hello everybody!

Eighteen September was the big day of the "Conquer Darkness Festival" in
Bodegraven! [The Netherlands]

The evening started at 10:30 with the band Lucifer's Nightmare, a heavy
name for a band.  It was a beginning band with five playing people.  They
played covers like "Rock For The King" by Barren Crss, but also their own
numbers like "Conquer Darkness" (that's also the name from the festival). 
Lucifer's Nightmare make good music, but I don't like their vocals,
they're a bit too high.  After Lucifer's Nightmare came the band Fortress.
 They come from the village Soest that's by the town Utrecht.  I've got
not so much to say about Fortress but it was nice music.  And then there
was a new band named Sculpture, also a very heavy name.  Last August they
released a demo called "Enter The Kingdom", a four-song demo.  When
Sculpture played the people started to thrash and headbang.  Sculpture
played songs like "End of Times", "Question of Silence", "The Echo of
Empty Depths" and "Enter The Kingdom".  The style of the music is
death/doom metal.  And I will tell you Holland has a new very very very
good band, Sculpture. Great music!  After Sculpture came a band from Great
Britain, Seventh Angel.  They started with the song "Full of Blackness"
and after that "Woven By Silence" and "No Longer a Child".  These songs
are from the newest CD "Lament For the Weary".  But they also played songs
from their first one "The Torment" like "Tormented Forever", "Dr.
Hatchet" (about abortion) and "Katie", a beautiful song, and many more. 
It was a heavy concert from Seventh Angel.  The last band of the evening
was Holland's first death/doom band of White Metal - Decision-D.  This
band has also last August released a CD, their first one, with 10 songs,
called "Razon de la Muerte".  They played the whole CD, with songs like
"Reincarnation of Death", "Holy Supper" and "Diabolic Shadow".  These are
great songs and very heavy!  Around midnight the whole show was over, but
last but not lease, Edwin the singer of Decision-D prayed with us and then
we all go home.  It was a great festival!

[Sorry I tried to translate Thrashboy's broken English as best as I could]
