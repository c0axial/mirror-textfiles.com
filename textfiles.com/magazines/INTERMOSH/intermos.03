** Intermosh Vol. 3 **

    Sept. 1, 1992

Ok, I'm late, I'm sooo sorry! My car went out of whack and had no transpo 
to the labs to update my mail (I'm sorry Shade don't kill my hamster! 
NOOOOO!! --inside thing) and read the newsgroups, all 100,000,000 posts! 
AUGH!

Ok, back to the news folks!

In case you have been living under a rock, the new Deliverance album, "Stay 
of Execution", should be in your possession! CHECK IT OUT! Produced by... 
TERRY TAYLOR? The dude from Da?? I kid you not! Check out a new sound along 
the lines of Testament, Queensryche and early Queen!

Also coming out soon will be the second album by Sacrament, "Haunts of 
Violence", due out Sept. 15, to be followed up by an East Coast tour from 
Virginia to Vermont, and then October gigs in Oklahoma.. Sept. 18-19 will 
be their tour debut and also the debut of the new issue of Cephas/Teeth 
Magazine, now out with interviews of Sacrament, Godhead, DBM and Final 
Judgement...

The radio version of Intermosh, "Full Metal Worship" is now SYNDICATED! We 
are now played regularly by a radio station in Baton Rouge, LA (we are 
based in Merrifield, VA).. 

Sacred Warrior's new album, "New World Order", should be out soon.. and by 
year's end will be the most awaited album in Christian metal, the new album 
by Believer!!

Circle of Dust completed their successful East Coast tour and are now home 
where both the bassist and drummer attend school.. Arbitrage will have 
completed their second demo any day now.  They are a... ONE-PIECE.. 
industrial thrash band from the Seattle area.. Godhead will put out their 
second demo in a few months pending finances.  They are a 4-piece brutal 
thrash band from Toledo, Ohio.. Martyr and Mental Destruction are 2 of the 
brutal bands found on ACM Journal Magazine's new compilation CD now out. 
Martyr is a 5-piece hardcore thrash band from The Crucified's home town: 
Fresno, while Mental Destruction is heavy death/industrial/thrash from 
Sweden.. Consecrator, the 4-piece from North Texas, is due out with not 
only a new demo but also an East Coast tour with a "very prominent secular 
thrash band".. Paris Red, a 4-piece commercial hard rock band from North 
Carolina, has their new demo out, "Dibbs on Your Body".. Red Ink's new CD, 
"Brutal Recompense", has been delayed due to the record company going out 
of business.  Expect a demo from them in October.. The long-awaited Seventh 
Angel/Detritus/Decision-D tour in the USA has not yet been confirmed 
although Red Ink vocalist Ash Henson, while spending a lot of time in the 
Netherlands with Decision-D (their homeland), did relate a lot of fantastic 
stories about them, including seeing all 3 bands in concert in the 
Netherlands.. 

Tom Koehler, the "office boy" of Sanctuary Church in California, has put 
together a video of sorts.. check it out! Contact me for details, although 
excerpts from concerts of Deliverance, Believer, One Bad Pig, The 
Crucified, Precious Death, Jesus Freaks, Martyr and much more can be found, 
and a tour of the Sanctuary Church offices, and some really weird stuff 
(Tom did you REALLY jump off that cliff?)

That's it, believe it or not! Check out more details coming on Sacred 
Warrior, Ordained Fate, Haven, Bride, and Christian metal coming out of 
Australia (all 1 zillion bands!)...
