GOTHIC! The way to go in the '90s!!!

Now that I got that out of the way, I heard some INCREDIBLE new albums
that I must share with you:

Living Sacrifice, "Non Existent" - A MUST GRAB! Much MUCH heavier than
their last release and far more technical.. it's gothic techno-DEATH folks
along the lines of an extremely technical Gorguts or Unleashed... also in
between the brutally death rhythms you'll find clean and intricate
acoustic guitar along the lines of Spanish guitar classics... what an
incredible album!!!

Ordained Fate, "Ordained Fate" - another MUST GRAB! very heavy gothic
metal release on Wonderland Records... the drummer, Terry Cvengros, is the
only MALE in the band (the rest are women!) alongside his wife Annette,
one of 1992's BEST guitarists.. and just in time for this years new
administration is the song "The Election", which gives the theme of the
old philosopher Rousseau: "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
absolutely".. I was most pleased...

Under Midnight - heavy industrial along the lines of early Ministry on
Wonderland Records with Believer's Kurt Bachman as guest guitarist..

I didn't get the chance to hear Veni Domine yet (they're on the same label
as Living Sacrifice - R.E.X. Records) but I hear from others that they're
along the lines of Seventh Angel and Detritus...

Demolition - the compilation album on R.E.X. Records with the bands and
their songs: Thresher, "My Reality" (from their never-released second demo
before they broke up), Mortal Enemy, "Exodus of Life" (from "Tame the
Beast Within"), dodavahu, "Attitude" from their self-titled demo,
Consecrator, "Free From Death" (from "Image of Deception"), The Unknown,
"Graphic Nature", Abhor Evil, "Zone Zong" (from "Abhor Evil II"), Hot Pink
Turtle, "Glide" (from "Demo No. 3"), Sardonyx, "Puppet of Beauty" (from
"Majestic Serenity"), and Immortal, "Senseless Abandon" (from "Dead and
Buried" before they became Circle of Dust)... the best of the Christian
underground (my pix: Thresher, Consecrator, Sardonyx and The Unknown...
and Immortal!)

Final Judgement will be in concert at the Wreck Room on Nov. 13 at 800
Marietta St., N.W. in Atlanta.. Sacrament will be with Sardonyx on Nov. 14
at Lancaster YFC in Lancaster PA.. Crown of Thorns will be in concert at
New Covenant Church in Manassas VA on Sat. Nov. 14.. and Seventh Angel,
Decision-D, Sculpture and Ancepscura in concert at the Thrash Festival in
Almelo, The Netherlands on Nov. 20.. also Mars Hill, Maryland grunge-rock
outfit, will be in concert sponsored by Amnesty International at the
Colony Ballroom of the Univeristy of Maryland on Nov. 20.. a Battle of the
Bands will take place at the PowerHouse in Euless TX on Nov. 21..

Congrats to both Florida grinders Royal Anguish and Maryland death
metallers The Risen for both being signed to A.R.T. Records.. also look
for a compilation release with both bands and many more.. new bands on the
scene include Surreal Embodiment and Alchemist.. Godhead has released
their second demo in a far more brutal and authentic death metal vein..
the original 2-song demo by the Toledo band is still available..
Everlasting Revelation is a new 4-piece band from outside Washington D.C.
in the hard rock vein with some leanings toward Undercover.. Delaware
grungers Ragman's Eric Hutts is forming his own label and reports to have
already 15 different bands in the death, gothic, doom, grunge and
progressive vein - all Christian.. Dutch doom metallers Sculpture have
released their debut demo, "Enter The Kingdom", along the lines of early
Paradise Lost.. Washington State death/industrial band Arbitrage have
released their THIRD demo, "The Healing Power of Death", including a
24-minute long epic, "Land of Hypocrisy", making Arbitrage the band with
the longest recorded song in heavy Christian music (congrats!).. Lanny
Cordola's solo release "Electric Warrior, Acoustic Saint" is very popular
in the UK right now.. this fall another "Metal Meltdown" conference in
England will be held with special guest speaker Michael Bloodgood.. One
Bad Pig's live video "Blow the House Down" is the number one Christian
video in the UK..

Tourniquet's release for "Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance" has been pushed
back to early December (approx. Dec. 2).. sorry! HOWEVER, Living
Sacrifice's new one, "Non Existent" (GET IT) is scheduled for Nov. 23.. 


Finnish brutal band DBM is working on new material with dozens of folk
auditioning for the bass and drum positions, both vacant..

And finally, look for an ALL-FEMALE progressive/gothic metal bands forming
in Arizona in the next few weeks.. more details coming...
