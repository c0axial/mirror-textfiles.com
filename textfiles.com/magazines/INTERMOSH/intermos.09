Babylon A.D. (no reaction from the crowd? Sad) 
 
Bride will be touring starting next month around the greater U.S.! I 
will post tour schedules as soon as I find out more! 
 
White Ray has been signed to Star Song Records (Bride's label and 
bandmates from Louisville KY) and is currently working on their debut 
album along the lines of GNR and early Bride... apparently White Ray won 
the New Band Contest last year at Cornerstone '91 (sponsored by Star 
Song) but decided to be signed with Image Records.. when Image went 
under late last year (I'll miss ya Dorn!) White Ray decided to go ahead 
with the original plan to be with Star Song.. look for their debut album 
in '93.. 
 
Sacrament will be at WJTL's studios in Lancaster PA to promote their new 
album "Haunts of Violence".. they will also be in concert at Lancaster 
YFC the next day (Oct. 9-10).. Bloodgood will be next door in Limerick 
PA at the LImerick Fire Dept on Friday Oct. 9.. 
 
Final Judgement will be kickin' off their debut album on MooTown 
Records, entitled "Desolation Sacriligious" with a concert on Saturday, 
October 17 at the X in Smyrna GA with hardcore act The Released and 
multi(?)-thrash band Antix... 
 
Recluse Chant will be in Weiss, VA (near the Kentucky border) on Friday 
October 16 to play in concert.. check out their HOT progressive speed 
metal sound and I believe a demo is available! Contact them at: Recluse

The club Footloose in Euless TX has changed their name to PowerHouse and

Dry Bones is a new thrash band from New England!  More details as they 
arrive (thanx Todd from FJ!) 
 
Don't forget to check out the Big Anniversary Celebration of "Full Metal 
Worship" which will be somewhere in the Washington, DC area on Halloween 
Night.. we are trying to get a remote site since bands will be showing 
up, and of course, more details as they arrive (stay tuned for next
