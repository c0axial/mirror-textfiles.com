** INTERMOSH VOL. 10 **
**      UPDATE       **
    10/16/92 
 
My friend Shade (rljhr@cs.flinders.edu.au) just informed me that 
Discarnated is interested in selling their pre-release of their upcoming 
demo to the US ONLY IF 20 orders or more are placed... 
 
It is $5 per tape plus $3 postage and handling.... let me recommend it to 
you, Discarnated is CRUSHING FREAKIN' DECENT death/thrash, leaning more 
towards death metal...it has 4 songs on it, varied and produced fairly 
well... worth the money! 
 
Send all requests to: rljhr@cs.flinders.edu.au (Shade) 
 
Tanx! 
 
Also, Final Judgement will be in concert this Saturday (Oct. 17) at the X 
in Smyrna GA with Antix and The Released.. try to go, it'll CRUSH.. (thanx 
Sam for the update)... also I goofeth yea verily... Final Judgement's 
upcoming album on Mootown Records is called "Desolating Sacrilege", not 
"Desolate Sacreligious" or whatever I had before... 
 
FINAL UPDATE: Final Prophecy (oo what a pun!) will be in concert in Tampa 
Florida, word has it Morbid Angel and Obituary will headline...
