     Bjork
     Debut
          (Elektra Records)

                         A LOVE FROM OUTTER SPACE
Head to toe, Bjork is different.  No two ways about that really.  
However, not different in a concerted, self-aware, They Might Be 
Giants, sort of way (and that is in no way a swipe at TMBG).  Anyone 
as unique and foreign sounding as Bjork runs the risk of becoming a 
novelty and being categorized as such.  With Bjork though, there is a 
quality which is completely odd, and completely genuine.

When the Sugarcubes first broke loose to become Iceland's greatest 
contribution to pop culture since "Ice Hockey" (which actually came 
from Kingston, Ontario) the first thing everyone latched on to was 
Bjork's voice.  She sounded defiant and vulnerable, childlike and 
erotic, all in the same breath.   With its quirky rhythm and Bjork's 
vocals which alternated between a whisper and a scream, the 
breakthrough single, "Birthday", swept over the North American 
musical landscape like a brush fire.  Exotic vocalists tend to come and 
go quickly (see: Haza, Ofra) so the test would be whether Bjork could 
evolve and continue to maintain the public's interest.  Over the 
course of three albums Bjork, and the Sugarcubes as a whole, 
sounded increasingly focused, less disjointed, less edgy.  Continuing 
with this trend, Bjork's first solo album, "Debut", is just as diverse 
(well almost as diverse) and far more maturely refined than 
anything the Sugarcubes ever recorded.

			KEEP ON MOVIN' . . .
Much of the credit for the groovy-smooth sound of "Debut" is 
undoubtedly due to Nellee Hooper (of Soul II Soul fame).  The album 
covers a great deal of musical ground and yet hangs together as a 
cohesive unit as it revolves around Hooper's easy-driving dance 
sound.  The tracks that do move away from the overriding theme 
and into the quirky, are those on which Hooper relinquishes control 
and allows Bjork to keep a hand on the production helm (see tracks 5 
and 11).

The collection opens with the rhythmiclly hypnotic kettle drums of 
the first American single, "Human Behavior".  "The voice" is just as 
wide ranging as ever, lashing out and soaring sweetly in equal 
measure, but against a haunting backdrop of disco bliss, there is a far 
greater sense of control.  Half the album is spent in a similar vein.  
Melodic, user-friendly dance songs with the exotic Bjork emoting in 
the foreground.  "Big Time Sensuality" is the stand out track on the 
album, hands down.  Triple-deep baseline and jabbing organ bits 
(musically, a lot like Betty Boo's first album).  Lots of growling and 
howling.  It covers the waterfront.

When the beat relents, which is fairly frequently, there are some 
terribly interesting moments.  Lots of strings and harps and 
atmospheric noises.  These songs help to make this seem more like a 
traditional album, and less like a merciless nightclub.  The closing 
track, "The Anchor Song", is by far the strangest piece in the 
collection.  Just Bjork and an avant-gaurde horn section that sounds 
as if it were borrowed from Elvis Costello's "Spike".  No slick drums.  
Not a baseline to be found.  As Bjork sails off into "Debut's" sunset, 
there is a sense that this is only the beginning.

	Nick Heyward
	From Monday to Sunday
		(Epic Records)

			OBSCURITY KNOCKS
It was over a decade ago that a young Mr. Heyward led Haircut One 
Hundred through a quintessential album of the early 80's, "Pelican 
West".  After the obligatory creative differences and legal 
confrontations, Nick struck out on his own to embark on a solo career 
that has not been without its auspicious moments.

Unquestionably, the high watermark in Nick's career came when not 
one, but two of his songs played in the background during the big 
high school dance scene in John Hughes' teenage epic, "Sixteen 
Candles".  Nick's next brief encounter with pop culture came during a 
"60 Minutes" story on British military officers returning home after 
years of colonial occupation in foreign lands.  During an interview 
with one particularly eccentric and disgruntled retiree, the former 
officer flipped on the television and was confronted by Nick 
Heyward's video for "Warning Sign".  The gentleman then went on to 
blame the ills of humanity in general and the decline of the English 
Empire in particular on Nick (though he did not mention Nick by 
name, the charge was probably more generally aimed at those of 
Nick's ilk.)  There were other appearances.  Nick was the opening act 
at Wham's momentous farewell concert at London's Wembley Arena.  
It has been alleged that a song of his was used in the John Travolta 
film "Perfect".  It never made it on to the soundtrack (and I have 
never seen the film so I can only pass along what I have been told.)  
Nick also showed up to add his trademark guitar work to a 
phenomenal (and painfully difficult to locate) single by the 
Groovetrain called "Why did you do it?"

Then he was virtually unheard from.  At least he didn't pop up on 
any more American TV news magazines.  The unkindest cut of all 
came when a local columnist wrote in response to an inquiry "yes, 
there actually was a band named 'Haircut 100'.  I wouldn't have 
believed it myself if I hadn't looked it up in my encyclopedia of 
Rock-n-roll."  The career of international pop star Nick Heyward was 
faltering, to say the least.

			THE RETURN OF JOLLY ST. NICK
On this fourth solo album (it really is his fourth, don't let him kid you 
into forgetting "Postcards From Home" from 1986) Nick sounds like 
the classic English songwriter he was destined to become.  The sound 
is vintage pop in the same ballpark as the Lilac Time,  Black, Paul 
Weller, or Bradford.  Not as many trumpets as Nick used in the early 
days, but plenty of string arrangements and jangly guitars.  The 
album sounds refreshingly unlike the vast majority of music 
recorded during the past five years.

The first single released from the album, "Kite", is absolutely 
beautiful.  Soft-spoken, but with a cynical cast, it bounces along for 
three minutes and is as catchy as a cold.  It even contains a brief 
trumpet bit which is extremely reminiscent of the horn blast in 
Haircut 100's "Fantastic Day".  The rest of the album is similar in tone 
though the song styles vary greatly.  "How do you Live Without 
Sunshine" stands out in the middle of the album as an epic sized, 
eight minute ballad, yet it doesn't seem out of place among four 
minute love songs.  Perhaps it is reminiscent of the Dream Academy, 
but it is still a fast-moving eight minutes.  It also helps that Nick 
Heyward remains the hapless romantic throughout.  He isn't out to 
save the planet, or start a revolution.  He just wants to end up with 
the girl occasionally.

The other outstanding song on the album is "Diary".  It is 
considerably less delicate, harder edged than "Kite", yet it features a 
fantastically melancholy string arrangement.  Think the Beautiful 
South.  The song's mood lurks somewhere between embittered and 
forlorn, yet Nick never lets the anger take control.  That may be the 
key element to the success of "From Monday To Sunday."  Nick 
Heyward sings through a range of emotions in these songs, but he 
never lets them get in the way of a great, three minute pop record.

	Adam Sandler
	They're all gonna laugh at you!
		(Warner Brothers)		

			TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING TO LAUGH AT
During his brief appearances on M-TV's "Remote Control" Adam 
Sandler managed to take mediocre material and make the most out 
of it.  Even on the lackluster Saturday Night Live he extracts the 
maximum possible laugh potential from paper thin comedy premises.  
Granted, Opera Man is a big waste of network airtime that could put 
to more entertaining use by showing the "Emergency Broadcast 
Signal" for three minutes.  However, Sandler scores bonus points for 
getting any comedy mileage at all out of Cajun Man.

The fact that Adam Sandler can be extremely clever makes this 
album of sketch comedy and songs all the more disappointing.  There 
are bits and pieces that are funny, but they are remark
ably few and 
far between.  Most of the material is dull as dirt.  The rest is so 
unfunny it hurts to listen to it.

The language is extremely foul on many tracks.  That usually 
wouldn't be a problem, but here it seems like vulgarity is being used 
as a substitute for wit and imagination.  The Jerky Boys would be 
drop dead funny with or without swear words.  "Toll Booth Willie" 
and the entire "Buffoon" series rely exclusively on the premise that 
it's funny to hear someone spew blue language.  Seventh grade boys 
might laugh at these tracks.  Probably not.

			THE LAST BEST HOPE FOR HUMOR
The best tracks on the album are the songs, which are a lot more 
focused and well thought out than the sketches.  "The Thanksgiving 
Song" and "Lunchlady land" are both bizarre little tunes, reminiscent 
of the "Sweatshirt" song from SNL.  There are sketches that seem to 
have some promise when they begin, but like most of the pieces on 
SNL, run out of steam early and have no place to go.  

It's very sad that this is such an uninspired piece of work.  Adam 
Sandler is a much funnier guy than "They're all gonna laugh at you!" 
would suggest.  Hopefully he'll flee the sinking Saturday Night LIve 
ship soon and shrug off it's influence.  Until then, they probably 
aren't ALL gonna laugh at him.

	Volume Seven
		(the Total Record Company)

			THE FUNDAMENTALS
"Volume" is a 200 page, compact disc sized magazine, which comes 
out three or four times a year.  It includes a disk in the back cover 
which contains "at least" fifteen previously unavailable tracks.

It is of English origin and therefore was somewhat pricey when it 
first began to appear on these American shores.  Men (and women) 
were known to pay as much as $30 per issue at boutique record 
shoppes.  Now, however, "Best Buys" (the E-lectronics superstore 
with a heart) is passing along the savings to you and offering issues 
of Volume for a mere $13.99.  This is not to be considered an 
advertisement for the aforementioned retail giant, other outlets may 
well be offering similar or superior bargains, however trendy music 
stores in the Metro area continue to ask twice the Best Buys' price.

			Volume. . . Debut.  Debut. . . Volume.
"Volume" is akin to a similar English export of a decade ago, "Debut" 
magazine.  For roughly a dozen issues "Debut" chronicled the 
pioneering acts of the day and included an LP of the most recent 
material.  Though wildly uneven, these records proved to be 
historical documents, time capsules of an era that is, at this very 
moment, being repackaged and sold off the nostalgia bandwagon.  
But I digress.  Because for all the future historical implications 
"Volume" issues are nothing if not glimpses into the future of the 
American music curve.

			THE SOUND OF TOMORROW . . . TODAY
The impressive thing about "Volume" is that all of the tracks are 
from new, forthcoming releases.  So even though "Volume Seven" is 
not exactly hot off the presses (and will only be less so by the time 
you read this) the music is still yet to be discovered by Mr. and Mrs. 
America.  Even beyond the benefit of being the first on your block to 
know the inside story on Sabres of Paradise, the disc hangs together 
as a coherent, if somewhat uneven, look at the current state of 
alternative pop music in England.

This issue's collection ranges from the heavy guitar driven pop of 
Redd Kross to the lilting, barely-there remix from Seefeel with heavy 
doses of dancy-dancy techno filling in the gaps.  Of course the danger 
with a disc like this is that there is a chronic lack of continuity, but 
that isn't the case here.  Teenage Fanclub establish the tone for the 
set with a happy little two-minute instrumental that sounds as if it 
came right out of 1985.  The trio of live tracks from Verve, Sebadoh, 
and Stereo MCs work together elegantly, each building on on the 
energy of the preceeding track and developing momentum of its 
own.  Sub Sub are one of the big, outstanding surprises of "Volume 
Seven".  Smoother than smooth and fresher than fresh, they are the 
heirs to the 808 State throne if they choose to be (don't believe th' 
hype on certain usenet newsgroups, Norman Cook is not a member.  -
Ed.).  Little Axe make a phenomenal debut with the Tackhead team 
of Sherwood, McDonald and Wimbish, recapturing the original On-U 
Sound System vision which was so sorely lacking on the more recent 
Tackhead recordings.  The four brooding tracks in the middle of the 
program cling together like a building storm.  The Heroines break the 
mood with their debut which sounds like the early, stompy Throwing 
Muses recordings.  The closing three songs from Delta Lady, Eat 
Static, and Jesus Jones provide a high-energy, 15-minute-dance-a-
thon conclusion.

			LISTEN-LISTEN, READ-READ
As if that were not enough, the magazine is worthwhile as well.  The 
graphics are slick and the tone is irreverent.  Each band is given 
ample space to explain themselves along with a fairly critical look at 
each of their albums.  In between there are humorous bits which ask 
and answer questions such as "Would Duran Duran survive a Nuclear 
Holocaust," as well as a "page to smell."  Dry and clever in a typically 
English way.

			OWN A PIECE OF HISTORY
At $30 a pop, Volume Seven is an expensive way to be the hippest 
kid in your neighborhood.  However, for only $13.99 you'll be able to 
look back years from now and remember all the fun you never had 
during the no-so-roaring 90's.

	One Dove
	Morning Dove White
		(ffrr)

			THE SOUND OF ONE HAND.
The name of this album says exactly what it is.  It just isn't entirely 
clear what it says.

One Dove have recorded the next great chill-out record.  Even the 
band members appear to be barely awake on the cover.  However, 
One Dove do not fit neatly into the dub-ambiant pigeonhole.  In a 
domain that is crying out for an infusion of new life and new ideas, 
One Dove are poised to be the saviors of subtlety.

This is not wallpaper.  "Morning Dove White" is not the ultimate, 
barren landscape that extremists have been waiting for.  There is 
melody and rhythm as well as classic song structure.  There are also 
plenty of seven minute tracks that meander along with no particular 
place to go.  It's a beautiful ride, but it isn't for the impatient.

			SPIN DRIFTING
The One Dove sound is probably somewhere on the musical 
continuum between Massive Attack and the Orb.  Deep, rolling dub 
rhythms support an array of keyboards and the occasional guitar.  In 
both tone and style One Dove evoke memories of expertly crafted 
Colourbox records from the mid-80's.  The songs are rich with 
atmosphere but don't get lost in atmospheric effects.

While the music is remarkably beautiful, the defining characteristic 
of One Dove is Dot Allison's captivating voice.  When she begins 
"Fallen" by sighing "I don't know why I'm telling you any of this," it's 
difficult to know whether to take it as a warning or a confession.  
Though comparisons have been drawn between Dot (not to be 
confused with Dot Warner) and Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins, 
she is probably more like a second cousin to Sarah Cracknell from 
Saint Etienne.  Either way it is a fantastic performance that gives this 
record more warmth, more humanity, than the rest of the music 
playing in chill-out rooms around the world.

********************************************
	Upcoming Releases of Note or Interest
		(a few good reasons to go on living)

Normally there would be an extensive, up to the minute list of all the 
wonderful new recordings slated to arrive in stores over the coming 
months.  Unfortunately, the holidays have wrought their usual havoc 
and the list is unavaliable at this time.

Suffice it to say that the evasive Morrissey is still scheduled to come 
out early in February.  The long awaited American release of Paul 
Weller's second solo album is due out in late February.  Beyond that, 
you are on your own.



********************************************
	The Next BIG THING
		by Frankie Machine

Another casuality of the holiday season.  Our man at the "Blue Marlin 
restaurant and raw bar" has been mysteriously unavaliable for 
comment.  Messages have been left with the waitstaff, but his 
barstool has been inexplicably vacant since shortly before the Rose 
Parade.  It is extremely unlikely that there is a connection.

For the uninitiated, this space is generally filled with Frankie's acute 
observations of coming trends in popular music.  Sadly, the 
magnitude of his keen insight is matched only by the frequency of 
his irratic behavior.

Good luck Frank, wherever you are.  -Ed.

Dear Bang,
     Nice work on the Zine.  I enjoyed the article on the Harry Connick 
Jr. Christmas album though I was disappointed by your failure to 
make any remark or reference to stuffing Jill Goodenough's stockings. 
     I have a question for Mr. Machine (The Next BIG THING) about a 
trend I have spotted  Last year Natalie Cole resurected her deceased 
father's career with a chart topping duet.  More recently, Frank 
Sinatra's half hearted and largely uninspired "Duets" brought  Ol' 
Blue Eyes more attention than he has had since he married Mia.  Do 
you see a trend?  Are overblown, pompous pop stars from years 
gone by going to innundate us with career saving duets?  I heard 
rumors of a Tony Bennette / Red Hot Chili Peppers project.  Should I 
live in fear of a Perry Como / Pearl Jam pairing?
     -Ian Bayne

Frankie replies
Ian,
I think I  need only point to the first Beavis and Butthead single, 
which is a duet with Cher singing "I Got You Babe" to say that this is 
definitely a trend to be reckoned with.  However, with any luck at all 
this will run its course before Elvis Presley gets involved.
  



Dear Bang,
     Is this where I write to get free stuff?
     -Steve Jenkins

Steve,
We think you want Details Magazine.  They give away a lot of great 
free stuff.  The internet address for them is:
"Detailsmag@aol.com"
     -Ed.



Dear B.S.,
     I have a general rant that really doesn't have anything to do with 
you or anyone you know, but your going to get to hear it anyway.  Do 
you, or anyone you associate with know anything about the English 
television series "Lipstick on Your Collar"?  I saw one episode and 
never saw it again.  It featured big, surreal production numbers and 
naked women. . .  I am on a quest to find out all that there is to 
know.
     -Jonathon Liss

Jonathan,
Sorry, no information.  However, we have assigned a team of 
reaserchers to "find out all that there is to know" and communicate it 
back to you.  Mentioning surreal production numbers and naked 
women always peaks the interest of our research staff.  If anyone 
has information concerning the series in question (or any other show 
with surreal production numbers and naked women) let us know and 
it will be included in the next issue.  Good question, we'll be sure to 
send you lots of free stuff.
     -Ed.



Hey-
Something was messed up with the color pictures in the December 
issue.  They didn't quite look right.  I think you screwed something 
up.
     -Randy Straughn

Randy,
The December issue's pictures were indeed, as you so eloquently put 
it, "messed up."  We had hoped to pass it off as some sort of wacky 
techno graphic, but you caught us.  We are still on the steep end of 
the learning curve and a lot of the technical difficulties we are 
running into will be solved in time.  We hope.  In the meantime, 
thanks for your help in identifying the bugs.  No, really.  Thanks.
     -Ed.

Bang Sonic! is published once a month as both a stand alone 
Macintosh document and as a text only file.  This goes without saying 
and yet, somehow, it needs to be said: if you don't have a Macintosh, 
read the "text only".  If you do have a Macintosh, get the stand alone 
"doc" and de-bin-hqx it.  It's just that simple.  The choice is yours. 

Bang is avaliable in a few Usenet groups.  Look for it in:
       alt.zines
       alt.music
       misc.writing
       rec.mag
