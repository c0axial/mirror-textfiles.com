 EDITOR'S Note

Welcome back to Bang Sonic!  It may have looked to the untrained eye that
we had vacated the premises.  In the immortal words of Bananarama, it was a
cruel Summer (and Autumn).

Colin decided to take a powder, and when he did it all came to pieces.  The
rest of us were full of the best intentions, but bereft of inspiration.

Bang Sonic! Vol.II launches next month but change is already afoot.  New
software for the Macintosh Stand-Alone version of the publication; and a
new feature detailing bargains available to you - the reader.

Next month marks a new beginning.  In the meantime, this issue collects all
of the material Colin never assembled.  If the pieces seem a bit dated,
that's because they are.  Some of these have been sitting in the Bang
Sonic! "in-basket" for months.  Think of it as a clearance sale of ideas.
An historical oddity.  A last, dying gasp of an old order.  The darkness
before the dawn.

Perhaps.

Go carefully-

 FRANKIE MACHINE
 Advice for the Lovelorn

So far, on the journey down the scotch list, you have been speaking to
people of a basically alien civilization.  Here, at Fin's bar, as soon as
you arrive, you note how people speak closer to your mind.  They do not
stimulate the imagination by dramatic gulfs, but talk in the same way, read
the same books, believe in the same things, enjoy the same jokes.  Or maybe
it's the drink.

Down at the end of cocktail row there is a grown man crying into his
martini.  A sucker, a loser, a chump.  What can you do when your dame goes
away?  My editor requested a Valentines special report from this side of
sobriety, and I can't think of a better place to write it than on one of
Fin's bar napkins.  We all end up drinking alone sooner or later, I
recommend doing it in public.

Love can be a high-ball or a shot of rye, it can be more bossa than a
snifter of cognac and a pack of cloves or as raw as a mason jar of
night-train and a fifty cent cigar.  No matter, it all comes out the same.

To all of life's lost lovers out there in this month of cheap candy and
expensive habits - here is my advice to the lovelorn:

Want the bells to ring, the earth to move, the sun and stars to be yours
for the asking?

I recommend the single malt.  Happy, heart stirring... makes dreams come
true, and helps you forget them when they die.  The gutter doesn't look
half as bad through the bottom of scotch glass.  When the postman doesn't
come on valentine day - stop thinking, start drinking.

"Why Scotch?" Fin queries.

Because it is February, and maybe martini's still remind you of those
October parties when this cold and empty night seemed an eternity away.  Or
maybe because you would drink it together when you were sharing your last
cigarette - it was too late to get more and raining besides.  Scotch warms
you, it goes straight to your heart and bathes it in an amber glow that
helps you forget you'll never make love to her again.  Maybe she always
hated it and now you can finally indulge.  Maybe it is the only thing
within your grasp.

Smoke gets in your eyes.

The fella at the end of the bar hangs his head and orders another round.

Next one's on me.

 Frente!
 Marvin the Album
                Mammoth Records

     Hey there Georgie Girl
Benjamin Hoff became a yuppie cult favorite with his children's book look
at Eastern religion entitled "The Tao of Pooh."  His follow-up was the more
insightful but less catchily titled, "The Te of Piglet."  In it he explains
the virtue of "the small."  Nowhere is the value of that wisdom more
evident then on the North American debut from Frente!

The foot in the door for these Australians was their minimalist, acoustic
rendering of New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle."  Apart from the fact that
an acoustic version of "Bizarre Love Triangle" is not an altogether new
idea (see Divine and Statton's 1988 LP "Prince of Wales") what can (and
must) be said about it is that it is tremendously small.  Particularly when
compared to the disco-inferno magnitude of the original, Frente!'s version
is positively tiny.

Lead singer Angie Hart's voice is a tiny, little voice.  Similar in tone to
Clare from Altered Images or 4 year old French sensation Geordie.  When
Frente!'s arrangements stay small they are monuments to simplicity.  As
they expand into ever more complex permutations, they speak volumes about
the virtue of "the small."

     Less is More
"Marvin the Album" opens with the minuscule "Girl."  Nothing but a piano
and Angie's itty bitty voice.  The album builds, adding an element with
each successive track, even finding a groove by the 4th track.  However,
the basic formula is tiny, jazz arrangements, and a tiny little voice.

The Frente! Achilles' heel finally turns up on "Cuscutlan".  By this point
in the album Frente! are beginning to heat things up a little with muted
flamenco overtones.  Then Simon Austin's remarkably inappropriate voice
pipes in and Frente! don't sound very small anymore.  It is just as if you
are about to lean over and kiss someone for the first time, then just as
the anticipation becomes too exquisite to bear they announce they have a
boyfriend.  That same deflating effect.  Simon is to Frente! what Einar was
to the Sugarcubes.  His appearance is brief, but the aftermath is
immeasurable.

The second half of "Marvin the album" is full of Sam Phillips-type
pop-arrangements.  There is nothing wrong with Sam Phillips, but she has
never completely understood the appeal of "the small."  Neither,
apparently, does Frente!

Occasionally Frente! fire a dud that is positively painful to listen to.
The low point in the collection is "Accidentally Kelly Street" which sounds
like the theme to a CBC after school special.  Not so much quirky as
uncomfortably awkward.

Finally, the album ends with the wonderfully small "Bizarre Love Triangle."
It is sweet, and beautiful, and good for the soul.  Most of all, it stands
as a monument to the virtue of the small.

 The Other Two & You
               Qwest/Reprise

     They who laugh last...
Most of the great moments in western civilization have been born in the
face of adversity.  Tragedy, undoubtedly, begets tragedy.  However, there
is no drama without pathos.  No flowers without rain.  No triumph without
struggle.  Still, the sweetest smile is one without malice.

It would be counterproductive to speculate about the turmoil amongst the
members of New Order (itself, the child of catastrophe).  It is fair to say
that love was not in full bloom when Barney took time off to lead
Manquinien Supergroup "Electronic" and Peter founded the pointedly named
"Revenge".  So whilst egos and tempers flair, and all those around you are
losing their heads, what does politeness dictate that you do?  Smile
cheerfully and dance.

At least this is what it sounds like The Other Two are doing.  In the wake
of uproarious disagreements and with the threat of their empire crumbling,
the remaining member of New order put on a happy face and recorded an album
that is profoundly chipper.

Of course New Order spoiled the plot by pulling themselves together and
releasing the fabulously successful "Republic".  However, the fairy tail
story of the Other Two is not the least bit diminished by that turn of
events.

     Come fly with me
The Other Two's music is not unlike New order's ubiquitous, electro-dance
which has become a staple of breeder bars everywhere.  The sound still
tastes great, only now its less filling.  Co-Produced by Stephen Hague, who
also produced "Republic", this album sticks to the tried and true formula
that got them where they are today, thought it is less bombastic then New
Order's more recent recordings.  Buoyant Dance Pop that even straight white
boys can almost dance to.  However, if the devil is in the details, the
angels are as well.

The angel in this case is Gillian Gilbert who has quite obviously been
overshadowed by Barney for far too long.  Hers is a voice so gentle that it
brings tears to the eyes.  Like Allison Statton, or Tracey Thorn before her
ego got the better of her.  Gillian could kill with a whisper.  Sadly, she
only graces about half of the tracks with her heavenly presence.  Perhaps
the numerous instrumentals make her brief appearances all the more
exciting, absence making the heart grow fonder.

The Other Two have become the silver lining to the cloud which hangs over
New Order.  They have provided a fairy tail ending where goodness triumphs,
evil is banished, and everyone lives happily ever after, and learns how to
dance.

 Channel Light Vessel
 Automatic
               Gyroscope Records

     The tide is high but i'm holding on
Appropriately enough, "Channel Light Vessel" is the name of a program that
provides marine weather reports on the BBC's Radio 4.  So, already the
excitement is beginning to build.

After collaborating on a project called "the Familiar" in 1993, Roger Eno
and Kate St. John have regrouped under this new moniker.  Roger Eno is the
brother of ambient legend Brian Eno, while Kate St. John was a founding
member of the undeservedly unpopular Dream Academy.  Together in Channel
Light Vessel, they sound more than a little bit like the Dream Academy
meets Brian Eno.

This album is not as dry as a genuine new age effort, but it is fairly
arid.  Though excitement may not be the order of the day, there is plenty
of subtle action played out with a cornucopia of unusual instruments
judiciously sprinkled throughout.  There are plenty of slow moving chord
progressions, but there are also bursts of third world sounding, farfisa
based pieces to keep listeners from dosing off.

     Sailing on the Seven Seas
The album is about evenly split between instrumental and vocal tracks.
When the members start singing the atmosphere becomes moody and
foreboading.  The tension is always bearable because the instrumentals are
as peaceful and tranquilizing as Calgon.  "Channel Light Vessel... take me
away..."

The first single is the lead track "Testify."  It has a disturbingly
upbeat, middle-aged-hippy vibe to it; and even that wouldn't be so bad if
it weren't for the inexcusably corny vocals.  Fortunately, the next two
instrumentals drift along pleasantly enough to reestablish inner-peace and
harmony.

The rest of the album alternates between songs that are jarringly
experimental and songs that settle in like a fog.  "Ballyboots" employs
disjointed percussion and a jazz fusion electric guitar in the background
to establish a rhythm that isn't the least bit sleepy.  Then "A Place We
Pray For" is spooky, moody, and dank in the tradition of "Dead Can Dance".

Oddly enough, Channel Light Vessel is a little like a marine weather
report.  While rough seas make for interesting sailing, nobody appreciates
a metaphor that goes on for too long.

 Alison Moyet
 Essex

     No cigar
In 1991, Moyet released her best solo album since leaving Yaz.  "Hoodoo"
proved Moyet to be a white soul diva of the same caliber as Annie Lennox.
It allowed her to showcase her textured, emotive vocals on impressive songs
Moyet had written herself.  Unfortunately, Moyet's latest release, "Essex",
does not meet the standard set by "Hoodoo".

Whereas, "Hoodoo" allowed Moyet to successfully delve into a soulful arena,
"Essex" attempts to chart into the world of Beatlesque pop.  Sadly, most of
the songs end up sounding more like Bangles then Beatles.

On the majority of the pop material it seems that Moyet has little to
connect with.  When she does find something to latch on to, however, she
makes the most of it.  The stand out track on the album, "Whispering Your
Name" is the only non-Moyet penned track on the album.  It was written,
ironically enough, by Jules Shear who wrote for the Bangles.  On
"Whispering", Moyet laments the fact that her lover is still hung up on his
last lover.  We are treated to two versions, one a stripped down acoustic
version allowing the listener to hear every iota of considerable emotion
Moyet puts into it.  And the second is a rip-roaring over-the-top disco
version that the Pet Shop Boys would be proud to call their own.

Moyet also enjoys moments on "Getting into Something", "So am I" and
"Satellite".  These moments show that Moyet's foray into pure pop could be
successful provided good material was there for Moyet to sing her
formidable singing chops into.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of good
material her.  My recommendation is to skip "Essex" but pick up the CD
Single for "Whispering Your Name" -- the remix is not to be missed.

 Toni Childs
 The Woman's Boat

     Steady as she goes Captain
As a perusal of the song titles may suggest, Childs purports to take us on
a musical overview of a human life on her latest album, "The Woman's Boat".
For the most part it is an insightful journey with some very enjoyable
moments.

In many ways "The Woman's Boat" is a cross between her first two albums:
"Union" from 1988, and "House of Hope" released in 1991.  Whereas "Union"
borrowed from the sounds of Africa, "House of Hope" attempted to deal with
issues such as spousal abuse.  On her latest album, Childs is again
borrowing music, this time from India, and is again trying to contend with
issues, this time its human growth and maturity with a feminist slant.
Although the integration of native music is not as adept as it was on
"Union", and the issues are more glossed over then on "House of Hope",
Childs should be commended for the effort and generally successful
results.

The corner stone of this album, like its predecessors, is Child's
distinctive voice and method of singing.  Often guttural and bellowing with
a tinge of soulfulness, it is a voice you will either love or hate.  It is
particularly effective on this album as the voice from the womb yelping,
"it's beautiful here" -- a sentiment which is echoed in a reprise of "Womb"
which occurs at the end of "Death".  In starting life again after death
Childs is borrowing more then music from Indian culture.  Irrespective of
any religious slant, this album -- like life itself -- is challenging,
imperfect, and totally engrossing.

 Tori Amos
 Under the Pink

     A darker shade of pink
On the follow-up to her breakthrough album, "Little Earthquakes", Tori Amos
relies on the same piano/voice formula that worked so well on her debut and
ends up with a surprisingly different album.  Missing on "Under the Pink"
are KateBushEsque ballads such as "Winter" and "China".  These songs are
replaced by singles such as "God", "Past the Mission" and "Cornflake Girl"
which represents a promising new direction for Amos.

On "God", Amos sings "God sometimes you just don't come through, do you
need a woman to look after you".  One is left wondering if she means "God"
literally or as an expletive.  Depending on that connotation, the next
phrase could be shockingly feminist or surprisingly old-fashioned.  The
connotation is left up to you -- blasphemy or quaintness.  The smart money
is on blasphemy.

"Past the Mission" features guest vocals by Nine Inch Nail's leader, Trent
Reznor.  Surprisingly, this is a very low-key, but finely crafted song.  I
would have thought that Amos would have put Reznor to work on "The
Waitress" in which she confesses her desire to kill a fellow waitress --
but she "believes in peace, Bitch".  "Waitress" at least points out that
she and Trent are kindred spirits.

"Cornflake Girl" is a guilty pleasure.  A great pop song featuring backing
vocals by Merry Clayton (see the "Dirty Dancing" Sountrack).  Its main
problem is its loopy lyrics that leave you singing "I never was a cornflake
girl".  "Space Dog" runs along the same vein -- incomprehensible lyrics,
great pop.  Fortunately for Amos, her voice -- an instrument of immense
range, power and emotionally intensity -- can take even the most obtuse
lyric and make it relevant.

It is Amos' voice, along with her piano, that makes "Under the Pink" as
pleasurable as it is.  The album is no sophomore slump.  Although it is
less user-friendly than its predecessor, it shows a willingness to
experiment and definite artist growth that leaves one anxious for Tori
Amos' albums to come.

 The Coctails
 Peel
               Carrot Top Records

     Neither shaken, nor stirred
"Different is good," at least according to the people at Arby's.  In a
society built around conformity, it isn't easy to stand apart from the
crowd.  It sounds that the Coctails, sadly, have discovered this.

After three pioneering efforts in the hostile wilderness of the Cocktail
Nation, these explorers have retreated into the safety of the pack.  "Peel"
has brief moments of imagination and colour, but is, by and large, dull,
grey and lifeless.  For instance, a song like "Postcard" shows signs of
life with its quirky, choppy charm, but ends up sounding like Ween.

As an album, it hops up and down in an 'indie' sort of way to try and get
its motor started.  It probably even succeeds on some base and common
level.  However, it never even makes a passing nod to imagination or
sophistication.

The press release brags, "not a vibe in sight" as if that were a virtue.
Instead, it is precisely the problem.  The world has a million bands
without vibes and it certainly didn't need another.

Different is good.  "Peel" isn't different.

 INTERVIEW:
 Danielle Brisebois

Barry Williams recently performed in the touring company of "City of
Angels."  Though he played a hard nosed detective, everyone's first
reaction when he took the stage was, "hey look, it's Greg from the Brady
Bunch!"

If anyone ever said "you can't escape your past" they certainly knew what
they were talking about.  Danielle Briesbois will always BE Archie's niece
Stephanie from All in the Family.  At least to some of us.

It's been years since Danielle Breisbois acted on All in the Family and yet
that is probably still what she is best known for.  She is, however, trying
to branch out.  She recently released her first album entitled "Arrive All
Over You".  It's filled with high-gloss pop songs about love and stuff.
It's passable, dancy dancy girly stuff that is well done for what it is.
However, the really interesting part is that this is the second half to a
"where are they now" story.

Ms. Brisebois graciously took time out of her busy schedule to speak with
the intrepid (and smitten) Todd Matthews.


<Ring, ring>

Hi is Todd there.

Bang:  Danielle, how are you?

Good thanks.

Bang:  Have you been watching the O.J. trial?

Uh huh.

Bang:  I don't think it's on television enough.

I don't think it's on today, but it was on, I mean they're on break until
later this month, I think.

Bang:  Do you think O.J. did it?

I don't know.

Bang:  What does your gut tell you?

My gut tells me not to say anything.  [chuckle]

Bang:  How do you feel you were perceived by the press?

I think everything has been really positive.  You know.  I think that. . .
to tell you the truth, I don't really read much too much press.  I prefer
to see pictures and things that are interesting.  But I don't read too much
press because it's just peoples opinions.  It's like everyone is entitled
to one.  But what I have read, has been good.

Bang:  Did you choose the songs that went on the album?

Um hm.  I'm very hands-on in everything to do with my record.

Bang:  I noticed you were in the original Broadway production of 'Annie.'
Which part did you play?

I played Mollie, the littlest orphan.

Bang:  Aww, that's cute.  What year was that?

I did it from 1976 to 1979.

Bang:  When did you decide to become a professional musician?

Umm. . .Well I don't know if I ever decided to professional musician.  I
have always loved singing.  And I was always doing it, and the acting kind
of fell in between that.  And I kind of just went back to my roots.

Bang:  Do you have any plans to go back to live theater?

Umm. .no.

Bang:  You say that like you had a bad experience.

No, I just find musical theater to be extremely boring at this point.  I
mean, I haven't seen 'Tommy' yet.  I hear that's good.  But that's rock n'
roll anyway.

Bang:  Have you ever had a crush on a musician, like say Jon Bon Jovi?

I used to love John Taylor from Duran Duran, when I was like 12.  But I
think as you get older, you don't really get crushes anymore.

Bang:  Has the status you have achieved now, allowed you to meet John
Taylor?

No I met his wife though.  She was mean to me.

Bang:  What happened?

I went to the Duran Duran concert and I was so excited I was going to
finally meet John Taylor.  And I go backstage and I just wanted to say 'hi,
nice to meet you and bye.'  Nothing more than that.  And his wife was
there, and she said, "I'm his wife, he has a baby."  So I said, "Oh, okay,
bye."  So I never got to meet him, but I met his wife.

Bang:  So, you're over the crush?

Yeah, over the crush.

Bang:  You're from Brooklyn originally.  Do you still live there?

Brooklyn, no (laughs).  I don't live in Brooklyn.  Not like Rosie Perez, I
don't live in Brooklyn.

Bang:  So tell me, what does Danielle Breisbois do for fun?

Hmm. . .What does Danielle Breisbois do for fun?

Bang:  Smoke clove cigarettes?

I don't smoke, I love to shop.  And um. . .what else?  I don't know.  I
just like to go out and have fun.  I mean I like to read a lot.  I like to
watch the O.J. trial.

Bang:  Like most of America, you're glued to the set.

Well, for some of it.

Bang:  Do you go to clubs and slug down Mickeys on the dance floor?

No I don't really drink to much.  Not really a drinker.

Bang:  You're a very clean cut kid.  

No, I just don't really find that I need alcohol to freak out.  I can do
that without it.

Bang:  What types of music do you like to listen to?

I like Bowie, The Cure, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Prefab Sprout, all kinds of
stuff.

Bang:  Do you loathe any type of music?

I don't really loathe a particular kind of music.  I just don't like
necessarily, stupid songs.  I just don't like bad song writing.

Bang:  Did you go to see Barbara Streisand while she was in town?

No.  Of course not.

Bang:  Is she on the list of people you loathe?

No I don't loathe her at all.  I think, I mean she's obviously a
super-talent of some sort.  I just personally don't think I would. . .I
would. . .you know. . .enjoy a whole show.

Bang:  I don't get the whole Streisand phenomena.  Why people would pay a
thousand dollars. . .

. .She's a legend in her own way.  I mean she's definitely a legend, but to
me, it just doesn't turn me on.  Do you know what I mean.

Bang:  I'm with you 100%.

Some people really dig her.

Bang:  Do you have a confidante in your life?

A confidante?  I have some really good friends.  I guess I have a. . . I
don't know.  I guess I have a confidante but I think it kind of changes
face a lot.  

Bang:  It's not one person you can single out?

Different people for different things.  

Bang:  The tattoo on the back of you neck, is the same as the picture on
the cassette single of "What If God Fell from the Sky."  Did you design
that yourself?

Um hm.

Bang:  What's the significance of it?

Well see, I've just always liked the symbol of the Sun with a face in it.
And I just think the sun is like fertility and life and hope.  It's kind of
all the good things that we need to survive. 

Bang:  Do you draw often in your free time?

Sometimes yeah.  I like to draw.  I like to paint more than draw.

Bang:  Do you have any other tattoos, we can discuss in a family magazine?

Just that one.

Bang:  As a child, did you play with Barbies?

Of course (laughs).

Bang:  Slinkies?

Um hm.

Bang:  Seems to me like everyone is crusading for something these days.  I
was wondering if you had any causes you were promoting?

Um. . .(laughing) The Danielle Recoupment Fund. 

Bang:  Do you eat cereal like normal people, or are you one of those flower
power, freaky deaky, bran-blowing vegemites?

I'm a vegan.

Bang:  A true vegan?

Um hm.

Bang:  No meat at all?

No meat at all.

Bang:  Chicken?

Nope.

Bang:  Fish?

When were chicken and fish vegetables?

Bang:  Uh. .Didn't Reagan declare them vegetables in the 80's?  Maybe that
was ketchup.

Reagan declared a lot of things but I don't think he knows what he was
talking about.  

Bang:  Who got your vote in the last presidential election?

Clinton.

Bang:  And are you happy?

I guess I'm happy.  I don't get too wrapped up in politics.  I mean, I
think it's out of my control.  

Bang:  No, your vote counts.  

My vote counts but I think that, actually it's out of my control.  I mean,
how do we know what the truth is, you know?  We're just being spoon-fed all
this information.  I think the media just clouds the vision now too.  I
think it makes it all crazier and nobody knows what to believe now.

Bang:  I'm working on a theory.  Every six months the media has to blow a
really dumb story way out of proportion.  The Tonya Harding thing, now it's
O.J. 

It's been incredible the past three years.  

Bang:  I wonder if it's this way outside of the country?

Outside of America?  I think England is pretty sensational?  But when you
are in places like Romania, you are too involved to worry about what people
are doing.

Bang:  I was reading them and in 'What If God Fell From the Sky,' there's a
line that says "and don't talk about love" then parenthetically it says,
"more on that later."  Would you care to explain that now?

There's a song on the record called 'Don't Want To Talk About Love.'  Which
comes later on in the record.

Bang:  Ah.  I'm a little slow.  I thought there was some deep meaning.  

Nope.  No deep meaning.

Bang:  Are you in a relationship now?

Um hm.

Bang:  How long have you been in it?

I don't talk about things like that.  (giggles in a girlish tone)

Bang:  On the list of people I wish to thank, I didn't see Carrol
O'Connor's name.  I was wondering if you have contact with people from the
old show?

Yeah sometimes.  When I was doing my thank yous for this record, I didn't
think Carroll O'Connor was appropriate, because he really didn't have
anything to do with my record career.  And I was thanking people who I
thought helped me, or influenced me in music.

Bang:  Do you have a favorite episode of All In The Family or Archie's
Place?

Do I have a favorite episode of All In The Family or Archie's Place?  I
guess I'd say the one where I got Bat Mitzvah ed.  Because I got to learn
Hebrew.  That was fun.

BANG SONIC!
the Atomic-Powered alt.rec.music.comp E-mag
Feb.95 Vol.I Iss.9

Bang Sonic! is published once a month as both a stand alone Macintosh
document and as a text only file.  Guess what: if you don't have a
Macintosh, read the "text only".  If you do have a Macintosh...
     1. Get the stand alone "doc" and,
     2. De-bin-hqx it,
     3. Then, naturally, "unstuff" it.

Be warned:
Stuffit-Lite and Stuffit-Delux have been know to have difficulty
de-bin-hqxing Bang Sonic!  If you experience difficulty, try using "Binhqx
v.4.0" or better yet, "HQXer".  Either one will take care of business for
you.

Bang! is available in assorted Usenet newsgroups.  It could show up
anywhere, but look for it in:
       alt.zines
       alt.music.alternative
       rec.music.misc
       rec.music.reviews

Bang Sonic! will also be available via:
     FTP:
       etext.archive.umich.edu
    
     Gopher:
       etext.archive.umich.edu
