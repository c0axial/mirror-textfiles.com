Here's a copy of the MJ-12 Docs I found, typed it up from a book, so it should
be as  close to  original as I can get, very very interesting, and also a list 
with a bit  of info on each of  the members of MJ-12 (ie MJ-1, MJ-2, MJ-3 ...)
Although it says  a bit, it  doesn't compare with  the info  you can get about
Project  Bluebook,  which includes more info with the interaction  between the 
Greys and  the American  Government.  As you  can see, this thing is as old as
hell, wonder  why the Government would bother going  to so much trouble  as to 
write a  document on these  "ufos" and label it eyes only, if they had nothing 
to hide from the public.

OPERATION MAJESTIC-12 is a TOP SECRET Research and Development/
Intelligence operation responsible directly and only to the
President of the United States.  Operations of the project are
carried out under control of the Majestic-12 (Majic-12) Group
which was established by special classified executive order of
President Truman on 24 September, 1947, upon recommendation by
Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary James Forrestal.  (See Attachment
"A".)  Members of the Majestic-12 Group were designated as follows:

	Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter
	Dr. Vannevar Bush
	Secy. James V. Forrestal
	Gen. Nathan F. Twining
	Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg
	Dr. Detlev Bronk
	Dr. Jerome Hunsaker
	Mr. Sidney W. Souers
	Mr. Gordon Gray
	Dr. Donald Menzel
	Gen. Robert M. Montague
	Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner

The death of Secretary Forrestal on 22 May, 1949, created
a vacancy which remained unfilled until 01 August, 1950, upon
which date Gen. Walter B. Smith was designated as permanent
replacement.

On 24 June, 1947, a civilian pilot flying over the Cascade
Mountains in the State of Washington observed nine flying
disc-shaped aircraft travelling in formation at a high rate
of speed.  Although this was not the first known sighting
of such objects, it was the first to gain widespread attention
in the public media.  Hundreds of reports of sightings of
similar objects followed.  Many of these came from highly
credible military and civilian sources.  These  reports res-
ulted in independent efforts by several different elements
of the military to ascertain the nature and purpose of these
objects in the interests of national defense.  A number of
witnesses were interviewed and there were several unsuccessful
attempts to utilize aircraft in efforts to pursue reported
discs in flight.  Public reaction borderd on near hysteria
at time.


In spite of these efforts, little of substance was learned
about the objects until a local rancher reported that one
had crashed in a remote region of New Mexico located approx-
imately seventy-five miles northwest of Roswell Army Air
Base (now Walker Field).


On 07 July, 1947, a secret operation was begun to assure
recovery of the wreckage of this object for scientific study.
During the course of this operation, aerial reconnaissance
discovered that four small human-like beings had apparently
ejected from the craft at some point before it exploded.
These had fallen to earth about two miles east of the wreckage
site.  All four were dead and badly decomposed due to action
by predators and exposure to the elemnts during the approx-
imately one week time period which had elapsed before their
discovery.  A special scientific team took charge of removing
these bodies for study.  (See Attachment "C".)  The wreckage
of the craft was also removed to several different locations.
(See Attachment "B".)  Civilian and military witnesses in
the area were debriefed, and news reporters were given the
effective cover story that the object had been a misguided
weather research balloon.

A covert analytical effort organised by Gen. Twining and
Dr. Rush acting on the direct orders of the President, res-
ulted in a preliminary concensus (19 September, 1947) that
the disc was most likely a short range reconnaissance craft.
This conclusion was based for the most part on the craft's
size and the apparent lack of any identifiable provisioning.
(See Attachment "D".)  A similar analysis of the four dead
occupants was arranged by Dr. Bronk.  It was the tentative
conclusion of this group (30 November, 1947) that although
these creatures are human-like in appearance, the biological
and evolutionary processes responsible for their development
has apparently been quite different from those observed or
postulated in homo-sapiens.  Dr. Bronk's ream has suggested
the term "Extra-terrestrial Biological Entities", or "EREs",
he adopted as the standard term of reference for these
creatures until such time as a more definitive designation
can be agreed upon.



Since it is virtually certain that these craft do not origin-
ate in any country on earth, considerable speculation has
centered around what their point of origin might be and how
they get here.  Mars was and remains a possibility, although
some scientists, most notably Dr. Menzel, consider it more
likely that we are dealing with beings from another solar
system entirely.



Numerous examples of what appear to be a form of writing
were found in the wreckage.  Efforts to decipher these have
remained largely unsuccessdul.  (See Attachment "E".)
Equally unsuccessful have been efforts to determine the
method od propulsion or the nature or method of transmission
of the power source involved.  Research along these lines
has been complicated by the complete absence of identifiable
wings, propellers, jets, or other conventional methods of
propulsion and guidance, as well as a total lack of metallic
wiring, vacuum tubes, or similar recognizable electronic
components.  (See Attachement "F".)  It is assumed that the
propulsion unit was completely destroyed by the explosion
which caused the crash.

A need for as much additional information as possible about
these craft, their performance characteristics and their
purpose led to the undertaking known as U.S. Air Force Project
SIGN in December, 1947.  In order to preserve security, liasion
between SIGN and Majestic-12 was limited to two individuals
within the Intelligence Division of Air Materiel Command whose
role was to pass along certain types of information through
channels.  SIGN evolved into Project GRUDGE in December, 1948.
THe Operation is currently being conducted under the code name
BLUE BOOK, with liasion maintained through the Air Force officer
who is head of the project.



On 06 December, 1950, a second object, probably of similar
origin, impacted the earth at high speed in the El Indio -
Guerrero area of the Texas - Mexican boder  after following
a long trajectory through the atmosphere.  By the time a
search team arrived, what remained of the object had been almost
totally incinerated.  Such material as could be recovered
was transported to the A.E.C. facility at Sandia, New Mexico, for
study.



Implications for the National Security are of continuing im-
portance in that the motives and ultimate intentions of these
visitors remain completely unknown.  In addition, a significant
upsurge in the surveillance activity of these craft beginning
in May and continuing through the autumn of this year has caused
considerable concern that new developments may be imminent.
It is for these reasons, as well as the obvious international
and technological considerations and the ultimate need to
avoid a public panic at all costs, that the Majestic-12 Group
remains of the unanimous opinion that imposition of the
strictest security precautions should continue without inter-
ruption into the new administration.  At the same time, con-
tingency plan MJ-1949-04P/78 (Top Secret - Eyes Only) should
be held in continued readiness should the need to make a
oublic announcement present itself.  (See Attachment "G".)
