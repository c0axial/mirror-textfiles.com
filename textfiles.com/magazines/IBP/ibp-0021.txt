In my house there ain't nothing wrong
so just you tell me what's going on
in the hall the insects breathe in
while the walls are caving in
this house stinks it really stinks...
craters are forming at the bottom of the stair
shadows lurk where there's nobody there
what you doing sleazing again
what the hell you doing hanging 'round

this house stinks it really stinks...

blood on your hands
pushing up hill
against the company man

well i'm just a hard working corporate slave

driving myself into a corporate grave

when the bargain bins full of useless things
turn and bring our world down
we're going to shop 'till we drop

we've got to earn what we've got to burn
we've got to hurt what we've got to hurt
we're going to shop 'till we drop
we're going to shop 'till we drop

when the priests and the kinds and the business men
all stop holding hands
we're going to shop 'till we drop
we're going to shop 'till we drop

when father christmas and the kray twins
burn all the wedding rings

we're going to shop 'till we drop

i won't leave it ever not even for a tiny little look


5. Hunter (4.01) 120.968 BPM

i'm on my way to the bank
can't you hear me
i'm on my way to the bank

i'm on my way to the bank
blinded by greed
we're lying you see

8. Real Wise Yuppie (3.54) 88 BPM

porsche in one hand
and a pot of gold 
snort bulk coke
'cause my hearts mighty cold
look real groovy 
but i'm feeling real old

i'm a real wise yuppie
and there ain't nothing left
wall streets crashed
it's the bottom of the deck
times are dark they're gonna get darker yet
decline and fall of the television set

there's gold in your eyes dear lord
can't see out for the dollar signs
our god he is a dollar bill
a mound of them buggers is even holier still
nobody cares about you and me
it's a corporate rip off monopoly

11. Make My Day (2.14) 135.136 BPM

go ahead creep, make my day
go ahead creep..

## SNOG - Dear Valued Customer 1994 ##########################################

1. Invocation To The Fiscal Demon (1.44) 104 BPM

2. Dear Valued Customer (4.55) 146.870 BPM

You'll pray and you'll save
With one foot in the grave
You'll sink or you'll swim
But the bank will always win
'Cause
This world spins but not for you
And all of their lies have become true
And I see a light, but behind there is the night
This world spins but not for you

You'll beg and you'll crawl
With your back to the wall
You'll hope and you'll obey
But it will always end this way


3. Cliche (4.25) 148 BPM

On this hollow earth
In this empty space
We all dance to a tune
Played by the master race
Those faceless money-men
Yeah, you're probably one of them
Hear their endless muzak tune
That plays on and on
And when the bullshit happy choir
Greets another grim day
When the angels swin to our aid
Well, here comes another cliche
While we hide from our barren end
That advertisers pretend
That the world is as they say
Well, here comes another cliche


4. Langley, Virginia (4.30) 152 BPM

Capitalism's. Invisible. Army.
And it's fortress of deceit
These men will burn alive
But no-one will weep

And the day that we bomb Langley, Virginia
All the men in suit'll face their mortal truth
And the day that we bomb Langley, Virginia
All the men in ties burn with their normal lies

In this moment of sweet revenge
We'll crisp their stinking hearts
Turn the table on Gehlen's boys
Obliterate their death dance


5. Headsand (5.49) 140 BPM

I will cheat like a politician
I will lie like the newsman
I will decieve you, my friend
However I can

Bury your head in the sand
Bury your face in your hands
I will never understand
I will never understand


6. Empires (4.17) 100.510 BPM

From the cadillac soup-kitchens
To the impoverished boardrooms
This orwellian nightmare
Is now everyman's dream

Burn the empires down
Burn the empires down
Burn the empires down
There is no heaven

As we stand in line in your efficiency drive
A voice from the checkout screams
That this orwellian nightmare
Is now an everyday scene


7. Naive Giant (5.14) 122 BPM

In the United States of Unreality
The people come second to the property 
The king won't move 'till the order is given
And your life is spent, well, how you're livin'

And we live in fear of this naive giant
And we drown in the ocean of blood he's spilt
And we cry for the crimes of the naive giant
But we never know that he never, ever will

I will give my soul ever so gladly
To my luscious king and his country
I will donate my mind for the greater good
To sink the debt, well, if I could

And the earth is filled
With the people you've killed
Yeah, this earth is filled
With the bodies you've killed


8. Reigning Terror (7.08) 126 BPM

From those dark Bolivian skies
To Jackie's blood soaked thighs
From the grave of Salvador
To the endless, mindless war

I do believe it's reigning terror
I do believe it's reigning terror


9. Hey, Christian God (4.40) 105 BPM

And I hate my family
And I beg to be free
Of the crap that christmas brings
An excuse for selling things
What a joy to be alone
Away from the buying zone
But this party'll never die
'Cause christ you're such a lie

Hey, christian god get outta my face
Your holy ghost is a curse on the human race
I'd like to string you up one more time
No stupid sacrament, no pissy wine


10. One Way Ticket To The Womb (4.40) 73.606 BPM

Maybe you're happy when you're asleep
Maybe this misery dwells just in me
But I'd like to share my pain with you
Yes I'd like to share this pain with you

I want a one way ticket back to the womb
I want to rejoin my ancestors, please make it soon

Maybe your hope is paralyzed
Maybe your joy anaesthetized
But the bone of this plane of existance is clear
Yes the bone will remain 'till we get out of here


11. Skinhead (2.57) 125 BPM

National action, national front
I don't like these little runts
They're so far right the cops like 'em
So far wrong we gotta fight'em

I'd rather be red than dead
Rather be dead than a skinhead

This ain't england this is australia
Don't wanna repeat the thatcher failure
Brown shirts and bigotry
Ain't really my cup of tea

Annihilate. Intimidate. Violate. Liquidate.
Suffocate. Subjugate. Vegetate. Decimate.


12. The Illuminati (5.39) 138 BPM

13. The Yuppie Shall Inherit The Earth (1.44) 49 BPM

14. Gods And Governments (8.24) 119.246 BPM

We loathe the darkness that we're breathin'
We fear the hole that we live in
There's sadness sodder than can be spoken
There's emptiness emptier than worth knowing
We cry with a pain that won't show it's face
A great sorrow that will never leave this place
Pray, but don't expect salvation
The end holds nothing but deflation

In fear we invent gods and governments
To hide we invent gods and governments
Behind lies a truth that's ugly and shallow
Our lives are a journey confined and narrow

We're born alone and we die alone
There are heroes among us, but they're all unsung
The landscape gives us the best indication
That the light at the end of the tunnel, is a gateway to nothing


15. Dear Valued Customer (Reprise) (6.09) 111BPM

You'll pray and you'll save
With one foot in the grave
You'll sink or you'll swim
But the bank will always win
'Cause
This world spins but not for you
And all of their lies have become true
ANd I see a light but behind there is the night
This world spins but not for you

You'll beg and you'll crawl
With your back to the wall
You'll hope and you'll obey
But it will always end this way

You'll dream and you'll fail
You'll struggle to no avail
We'll cry for your defeat
For the end you will meet
