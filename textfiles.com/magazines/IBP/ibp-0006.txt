                      Three Men And A Baby And A Ghost

Just about everyone knows about this one by now, but anyway, for those who
don't...  There  are two ghost  sightings in  this movie, both are in the
apartment.  The first one is of a boy, about 10 years old, who is seen standing
behind  a curtain (not fully hidden) when  the old mother comes in.  I can't
remember exactly, but it is on the left of the screen, and doesn't need pausing
to see, although it would help.  The other one is a bit harder to find, it is
supposed to be a face looking in through the window in one of the scenes when
one of the guys is changing the baby's nappy. The face is on the right of the
screen somewhere near or silouhetted on the window.  Slow play is necessary to
see this one.

I have seen both of these ghosts and the first one is a real spooker.  It looks
just like a kid standing there, but he is standing absolutly still, and I mean
still, like a rock.  The face is not that easy to see, although you can see
something, maybe just a blurr, or a reflection.

From  what I can remember, in the apartment used, there was a boy murdered by
his mother  (or someone), and thus the young lad has taken haunting residence
there.

                       Charles Manson  Meets Macbeth  

In the movie production of Macbeth, when Macduff chops off Macbeth's head at the
end of the movie (did I just give something away?), the head falls off the
stairs, and while it's falling, if you slow the tape down, the head is supposed
to change and look like Charles Manson's head.  You may or may not be able to
find it as it may have been cut from some versions of the film.  The story goes
that Charles Manson had murdered the Directors' wife at some time, and thus the
connection...why not have a chopped off Charles Manson head?
