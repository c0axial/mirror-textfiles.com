-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Ok, here's what's going on, CRiSiS is undergoing a new format and a new
name, after reviewing what the first Issue was like, I thought It looked way to
conventional, and needed something different to spruce it up.  So this is the
new format, no more magazine style collection of files.  Just single t-files
with the relevant information posted up the top of the file.  The new name is
Igh Bah Poo :) Thanks to CRuX, who also did that ascii up there.

       The story about the name goes like this...we call each other's boards a
lot (well he calls me mostly) and he has (or had) a crappy exchange, so what we
previously thought was modem problems turned out to be his exchange.  Anyway,
while chatting, he nearly all the time got hung up, or my modem stalled, so we
couldn't see each other's typing, until the stall passed...while working out
where each other's typing disappeared to, he always typed something like..
lkasjflj igh bah poo...etcetc..so i stole his thingy and liked it :) so here we
are!

       A Big thank you to Crux who is the best H/Cer in NSW! And who has
constantly amazed me with his skills :)  Look out for HooPNET! Coming Soon!
Call his board sometime, the biggest anarchy/art board in NSW, and mine is even
better, so just think about that :)

       Now it's time for me to say hello to some ppl :)

CRuX - Igh Bah Poo! Sysop Of NARC AE in NSW! Give Him A Call!
Screaming Jesus - "DON'T JUMP THE GUN SON! DON'T JUMP THE GUN SON!" :)
