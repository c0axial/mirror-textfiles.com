                INTRODUCING THE NEW AUSTPAC STANDARD TARIFF
               ---------------------------------------------


    1. Introduction
    ---------------
    This message outlines the new AUSTPAC Standard tariff that was
    introduced on 1 July 1991. Prices are outlined in this bulletin.

    Briefly, the key features of the new tariff are:

        . zone based charges for dedicated access

        . abolition of time charges for dedicated access(A)!

        . volume cap on dedicated usage(B)!

        . dial-up time charges differentiated on a metro/country basis.


    The charging zones are as follows:

    Metropolitan - Charging in the Metro zone includes two categories,
                   they are:

                   * The local telephone districts of ALL Capital Cities
                     including Townsville and Karratha

                   * Local telephone zone of major regional cities
                     such as Geelong, Newscastle, Wollongong,
                     Canberra, Goldcoast, etc


    Country       Includes smaller provincial and regional towns.
                  For example Dubbo, Morwell, etc


    Out Of Area   Applies to connections which are outside Metro
                  and Country area boundaries. There are very few
                  of these.



                AUSTPAC TARIFF PACKAGES
               -------------------------

    Standard Package

    This package offers volume capping for dedicated line usage.

    Most customers will use the standard package,however, AUSTPAC also offers
    two optional Tariff Packages they are:


    (1) Corporate Package

    This package offers a flat (no usage) charging structure for
    'intra-company' communications in a Virtual Private Network.


    (2) Value Added Services (VAS) Package

    The VAS Package offers volume discounts on usage for both Dedicated
    and Dial-Up access. Discounts on volume include reverse charged calls.


    These packages offer charging flexibility and allow you to choose
    a charging option which best suits your needs.


    For information about the packages, please contact your Telecom
    Representative or Telecom's Consultancy and Information Centre
    (CIC) on 008 077 222.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    !! IMPORTANT NOTES !!

    (A) For any PSTN Access there are time and uncapped volume charges.
        For NUI Access with any of the packages uncapped volume and time
        charges will be incurred.

    (B) If reverse charging is used there will be no capping on volume
        charges.

    AUSTPAC TARIFFS--- SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED
    ------------------------------------------

    2. Charging and Billing Details
    -------------------------------

    The charging principles of AUSTPAC Standard include four major
    components.
    They are:

        . Installation

        . Access

        . Usage

        . Facilities

    The following summarises the charging structure and procedures to
    apply for each.

    2.1 Installation - Dedicated
    ----------------------------

    Installation is differentiated on a Metropolitan, Country and
    Out of Area basis.

    Installation is a once only charge and will be billed in full.


    2.2 Access - Dedicated
    ----------------------

    Like installation, zone based annual recurring charges apply.
    Dedicated access is normally billed on a monthly basis.

    2.3 Access - Dial-UP
    --------------------

    Network User Identification (NUI)

    The method of identifying users accessing AUSTPAC via the Public
    Switched Telephone Network is the assignment of Network User
    Identifiers (NUIs).

    In brief, an NUI is in effect a password which enables a caller to
    be identified.

    There is no installation fee for an NUI, but there is an annual
    recurring charge which is billed quarterly.


    2.4.1 Usage - Dedicated
    ---------------------


    Dedicated Usage will consist of volume charges only as time charging
    has been eliminated to simplify the tariff. Business and After Hour charging

    still applies.Volume is capped so that charges cannot exceed a certain
    amount each month.


    2.4.2 Usage - PSTN/Dial-Up
    --------------------------

    Connect time charges apply for the amount of time terminals are connected
    to AUSTPAC, these are differentiated for Metro. and  Country zones.
    The zones equate to dedicated zones, however Country also includes
    Out of Area locations.



    Standard volume charges will also apply but will not incur a monthly
    volume cap.

    2.5 Facility Charges
    --------------------

    The following facilities are currently offered.

    Dedicated Access:

                        . Logical Channels: PVCs (Permanent Virtual
                          Circuits) and SVCs (Switched Virtual Circuits)

                        . Closed User Group

                        . Hunt Group

                        . Symbolic Addressing

                        . Customer Network Management

                        . Direct Call

                        . Reverse Charging Acceptance

    PSTN/ Dail-up Access:

                        . NUI (Network User Identifier)

                        . Abbreviated Addressing (receive 4 free with new NUI )

                        . Closed User Group



    DIAL IN/DIAL OUT TARRIF (X28 & X32)


    The following information will clarify any issues relating to X32 tarrifs.

    There are four components of charging for Dial-up services they are:

    1. Connect Time - amount of time connected to AUSTPAC


         Call Type              Zone    Bus Hrs         After Hrs

        & X28 Dial up calls     Country $6.40             $2.40

        Dial-out:               Metro   $4.80             $2.05

    3. Local Call Fee - billed on telephone account , currently $0.25
    4. Unit Call Fee- for dial out calls, charged on AUSTPAC account, currently
       $0.24




    Reverse Charging
    ----------------

    A host offering reverse charging acceptance will only receive the volume cap

    on non reversed charged calls. That is,reverse charge calls are calculated
    at the normal usage rate, including PSTN time charges where applicable.
