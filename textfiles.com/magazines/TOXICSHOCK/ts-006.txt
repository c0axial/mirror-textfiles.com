 In a time when Chaos was rampant, creation was created. Simple enough.
But the Chaos lingered into this being, and so began the power of the
Mighty Coathanger. And Coathanger brought Fetus into existence. Fetus
overpowered Coathanger and sought to bring the Creation into a bloody
mass murder. We the Followers of Fetus seek to carry out the Great
Destroyer's plans so we may live in harmony with The Fetus in a Creation
all our own.

 Even as Woman ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, even
as Man and Woman had hot kinky sex, even in the milennia ahead of Cro-Magnon
and Neanderthal Man, Fetus the Destroyer saw the Sin of Man form a new
fad. A fad that would become an accepted habit in Life of Man. This being
the invention of the Department Store. Fetus saw Department Stores as they
are now. But the plan he devised for Department Stores, even before
Homo sapiens evolved, was one of prevalent chaos and perversion.
 
 The Follwers of Fetus were dressed in all-black attire and went to the
local shopping mall to wreak some hell. As they walked through the
constricting aisles of the mall, destructing everything in their path,
the lights went out in the mall. The Followers looked through the front
doors and saw a large red cloud zoom in over the city. The Call of Fetus
has been uttered! They gathered around the centre fountain and chanted
a saying which made the waters turn bubbly red. The whole mall was dark,
for that matter the whole city was dark. It began raining staining,
salty blood. The lacerated sky poured forth its life. The Followers
lit a black candle as they had done on the dreaded Night. The moved
in strange circular patterns around the candle and chanted unheard
sayings. Their chants became audible, so very loud, the others of the
mall held their ears at the shrieking chants. The mall shook violently,
mortar and bricks fell all around. The Followers were levitated by a
strange force to the ceiling, where they chanted "Fetus Has Come!"
Then all returned normal. The cloud disappeared. No one except for the
Followers had any recollection of the events which had just taken place.
 
 Fred was shopping at Beers (Fetus did not predict Sin of Man changing
his plan to the name "Sears") for auto parts; he was trying to rebuild
his engine. He leaned over to pick up a fan belt. He dropped the
belt and shrieked; the belt was red hot and burned a hole in his arm.
Yet his scream seemed silent; no one heard it. Another fan belt lit
up to a bright red color and by some force jumped up around Fred's
neck. It twisted itself around his neck in a neat fashion, choking him
violently without letting go. Fred slumped to the cold concrete floor.
 
 Bill needed a new pair of track shoes. He went into Cunt Flocker
(yes, equivalent to our Foot Locker) to look at Reeboks. The manager
went into the back room to get him a pair of size 10's. Bill picked
up a white and blue shoe he found particularly interesting. He
turned to yell back to the manager, to tell him to bring a pair of
these, too, but the Fetal Shoe took over. It jumped onto Bill's face
and Bill was stunned. He could smell the scent of new leather; he
could also smell feces and uteral juices. The shoelaces wrapped
around his neck and tied themselves. They choked him incessantly.
As Bill felt himself near his Death, he saw inside the shoe a small
bloody fetus. Bill tried to scream but the suffocating shoe prevented
him. The fetus had two razorblades in his undeveloped hands. It
drove the blades through Bill's eyeballs and deep into the synapses
of his brain.
 
 At about this time Don went into Pound Cock to buy a B-52's tape.
He located "Cosmic Thing" on a top shelf and went to purchase it.
The lady at the counter bagged it for him, took his money, and
Don went on his way. He popped it in his Walkman, and strolled
off down the mall. Channel Z was the first song he listened to.
He strolled down the mall, happy and content listening to his new
B-52's tape. But the lyrics and music began to change. He slowed
his pace, amazed at the colossal event which was happening. But it
was horrifying, sickening. The words began playing loudly through
his headphones.
 "Gettin nothin but Fetus. Gettin nothin but Fetus,
  Fetus filling my Penis on Channel Z!"
And at that moment a miscarriaged fetus jumped from the end of
Don's dick. It dug its razorlike claws into his abdomen and began
crawling up his torso. Don stopped in his tracks. He clawed
desperately at the fetus, trying to remove it from his body. He
screamed in terror. The fetus clung to his body.
  It continued up his chest, onto his neck. It sank its claws through
Don's neck, shredding his larynx. Yet nobody walking along seemed to
notice this violent horrendous death. Until Don's body slumped to the
ground, bleeding and mangled. Then everyone in the mall saw the blood,
and began to run. The fetus made one small mistake. It pissed its
highly acidic urine, characteristic of the Fetal Followers, onto the
floor. This spread the knowledge of the deathly acts to everyone's
minds, everyone now could see the apalling acts of Fetus the Destroyer.
Now the death in Beer's was seen, the death in Cunt Flocker was known.
Now the death of Don was known. Man now began to see the Sin it
possessed. It saw its extinction by the Mighty Fetus. Fetus had to
invoke his power once again, to cover up for the miscarriaged fetus's
mistake. Fetus the Destroyer wiped the urine clean from everyone's
souls, removed the dead bodies of Fred, Bill, and Don from the scene.
Never again would Fetus allow miscarriaged and aborted fetuses to
wreak such havoc and have it uncovered by such petty mistakes.
 
 Ginger went to the food plaza of the mall. Nothing could beat the
testiness of shopping like a good ol Big Mac from McFondles. Ginger
stepped up to the register at McFondles and placed her order. She
took her tray and went to a corner of the restaurant where she could
put down her shopping bags without them getting in everyone's way.
She wiped her hands on a hand towelette from her purse, then took
the wrapper from her straw. She put the straw in her drink and took
a deep sip. The coke tasted funny; it did not taste like regular
coke. The thought slipped her mind, she was hungry from shopping.
She opened her Big Mac box. To her horror, within in lay a squirming
bloody fetus, ejecting a milky-white vomit from its mouth. She screamed a
scream of death but the sound did not leave her throat. The fetus looked up
at her, the thin layer of wet skin peeled away from its jet black
undeveloped eyes. The fetus squirmed out of the box and into her lap.
Ginger tried to get up and run but the fetus emitted a power that held her
fast to her chair. A young couple sat down next to her. It was if they
didn't even see Ginger, they began to eat lunch and didn't even look at
Ginger. The fetus took a runny shit on Ginger's lap, the watery mass was
like acid and ate through her skirt and burned on her pussy. She felt the
acid run up her cunt, thorugh her Fallopian tubes and into her ovaries.
Oh how it burned! And just as soon as she felt the acid-like substance
settle in her ovaries, she felt something grow. Oh my God! A baby is
being formed! Ginger tried her damnedest to get up; she was held to the
chair. The fetus spoke. "Hey bitch, I need somebody to PLAY with!"
Ginger clawed at herself. She shoved her hand deep into her vaginal
tract, grasping and clawing, trying to find and kill the rapidly
developing fetus. She was only ripping her insides apart. The fetus
laying in her lap was laughing maliciously. All of a sudden Ginger felt
her ovaries burst, and a newly developed fetus miscarriaged itself and
plopped out of Ginger's mangled cunt onto her lap, next to the other
fetus. The two fetuses smiled at each other, and they dove into Ginger's
cunt simultaneously. They clawed their way up through Ginger's body.
The last feeling Ginger had before she finally died her painful death
was that of her skull being severed. The two fetuses crawled out of
the skull and leaped over onto the next table. The young couple still
did not see Ginger, nor did they now see the fetuses. The fetuses
chose a person to kill, and they jumped onto the heads of their
newest victims. They both took big big bites out of the couple's
brains. The people did not even know what hit them, but the power of
Fetus the Destroyer had been released once again.
 
 Sally was in the dressing room of J.C. Penis, trying on a pair of
jeans. Both jeans fit tightly and showed her wide hips and outlined
her meat rather well. She liked them. She then tried on a skimpy
shirt to show off her well-curved body. As she pulled the shirt over her
head, she heard something lightly splat against the mirror in front of
her. She completely pulled the shirt over her head and pulled it down.
She looked up and saw in front of her a bloody fetus clinging to the
slick mirror. It laughed momentarily then jumped onto Sally's chest.
It ripped at her shirt, arms flailing and squirming, trying to reveal
Sally's firm breasts. It ripped through her bra. Her tits were hanging
out. The fetus licked its slit-like lips and bit hard into Sally's
nipples. Sally shrieked but like the other Victims of Fetus, the cry
of help was not heard. The fetus munched on Sally's nipples for a long
time then sucked the milk from the remaining breasts. The fetus bit
Sally's face off and chewed it, then took a big bite out of her brain.
Sally slumped to the floor, the fetus disappeared into the mall.
 
 Gina went to Castrated Nuts (comparable to Caster Knott's) to look
for a baby outfit to get her neice's new baby. She went upstairs and
this wonderful corner table caught her eye. It was made of the finest
of cherry wood. It would look perfect at the end of the hall in her
home. She was looking the table over, little did she know her worst
terror lurked nearby.
 A lady downstairs had just had an unfortunate miscarriage in the
women's bathroom. The fetus was not dead however, and had killed
its mother. It was on a rampage in Castrated Nuts, and made its way
upstairs. It was near Gina and her Cherry corner table.
 Gina bent over to look at the price tag of the table. She had on
a mini-skirt, and the fetus stood back looking between Gina's
legs at her pinkish tasty flesh. The fetus looked down and saw
a hard dick starting to protrude from its underdeveloped body.
It ran across the store, jumped up on Gina and mounted her. It began
pumping its tiny loins back and forth, Gina stood up straight and
looked down at the horrible sight. A tiny bloody fetus was fucking her!
She tried to pull it off but the fetus had dug its claws into her
flabby butt cheeks, anchoring itself. It continued to pump, in and out
it went. Finally it came. A tiny fetus came in Gina. How strange.
But the cum was not the viscous white fluid Gina expected. It was a
strange red acidic slime which ate away at Gina's cunt. The fetus
grinned an evil grin and aimed its strangely malformed dick at Gina's
face. It came hard, the substance surrounded Gina's head and ate away,
sizzling at her cranium. Gina slumped to the floor, the fetus went
away just as quickly as it had appeared.
