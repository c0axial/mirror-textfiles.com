   Violence rage destruction chaos rampant. We lived in a biased fascist
communistic world. We must turn the tables. We must obstruct justice as it
is destined by Coathanger the Magnificance, as it is proclaimed by Fetus
the Almighty Destoryer.
 
   In schools, in businesses, in public places, we can each take our stand
and shed arson through the chaos. I present to you a simple "flamethrower"
of sorts which anyone can build. I will try my best to give concise
instructions on building two separate "flamethrowers", mixture formulas, and
uses for your flamethrower.
 
FLAMETHROWER: MODEL ONE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
   I built another one of these babies this afternoon and worried some
neighbors with its prescence. Fairly simple to build.
 
MATERIALS NEEDED:
    Empty rubbing alcohol bottle
    Spray nozzle
    Coathanger (for clothes, not Coathanger the Magnificent!)
    Paper Towel or Diaper Rag or old Handtowel
    Ordinary machine oil
    Lighter Fluid
    Heavy Guage Wire (or use remaining portion of coathanger)
    Fuel Mixture
 
   The reasons for using an alcohol bottle are: It is translucent, so you
can see how much fuel you have left, and the opening on the bottle was
a gift from Fetus as it will accomodate nozzles from most any sprayer.
The spray nozzle should be able to project a liquid mixture far and with
force. The nozzle from a bottle of Spray N' Wash will do fine, and has a
twisty thing to select spray or straight stream (great for direct contact).
However, it does not spray far so I suggest finiding a better nozzle. The
one I used this afternoon came from Fetus knows where but it sprayed a
field like Windex (widespread, not a stream, in other words) and sprayed a
decent distance. The coathanger should be any old metal coathanger. I
used paper toweling from the kitchen but a diaper rag should burn longer,
same with the towel. These last two might require more oil and lighter fluid.
You may choose to use part of the coathanger in place of the wire, but wire
can be worked with more easily here.
 
   Onto construction. Take strong wire cutters and clip off the entire bottom
portion of the coathanger. From one end form a rectangle that will fit around
the upper girth of the alcohol bottle as shown:
                ^
       * -> /   | <- rest of coathanger
            |   |
            |   |
            |   |
            \___/
 
   Fit the rectangle around the girth and bend up the piece marked (*) to hold
the "rest of coathanger" piece around the bottle. Bend the rest of coathanger
upward so the end tip is directly level with the spray nozzle aperture. This
tip should stand out about one to two inches from the nozzle. The construction
so far should look similar:
 
                        ____________
                       /          |_>  . <- Tip even with nozzle
                       \__________\    |
                           xxxxx  \\   |
                         _/     \_ \\  |
                        /         \    |
                       /           \   |
      Coathanger --> -|-------------|---  <- Bend hanger upward
                       \           /
                        |         |
                        |         |
                        |         |
                       /           \
                      |             |
                      |_____________|
 
   Completely cute drawing. Anyway. Take a long strip of paper towel (shorter
strip if using rag or towel) about 2 inches wide and wrap it arond the upper
tip of the coathanger. You should be able to barely see the tip thru the top
of the paper towel wrap:
 
      __.__  <- Can see tip
     |     |
     |     | <- Paper towel/rag roll (looks like a marshmallow on a stick)
     |_____|
        |
        |
 
   Fill the bottle to desired level with fuel mixture (see section on fuel
mixture). Douse the paper towel (not TOO much with a combination of machine
oil and a dab or two of lighter fluid. If using a rag you may need to increase
these values, and maybe the thing will burn longer than a paper towel will.
 
   The "flamethrower" is ready. Screw the spray nozzle on and aim it at the
tip of the coathanger. The small problem here is that the wind might get up and
blow the flame away from the tip and the mixture will shoot over the tip or
hit the towel and saturate it with the shit. You might try lowering the paper
towel on the hanger and then wrapping a thin sheet of metal around the
towel so that the top of the metal sheet is level with the bottom of the
nozzle. Who cares. Anyhow, light the rag with a lighter. Keep the lighter
handy so you can relight if the flame gets blown out. Once the flame catches
hold the flame will rise above the nozzle. With nozzle pointed at this flame,
pull the trigger and let the mixture fly. Don't forget to prime it before you
light up. With the mixture I used today I got a nice flame that shot out
about 3 feet and the spray reached some two feet in diameter. Unlike burning
alcohol alone, the flame was dense and therefore hotter than others. See
mixture section and "Using Your Flamethrower".
 
   On particularly windy days, or normal days for that matter, the flame may
burn down where you are holding the trigger. Not nice to set your hand afire.
I tried to conceive a "finger guard" but since the flame must be fairly
close to the nozzle (so the spray doesn't wander off from the flame and get
wasted and fall to the ground or blow away or...) the coathanger does not
provide for such a "guard". So I took some heavy guage wire (if you have none
then use some remianing coathanger) and cut a about a foot long piece. I
made a loop on the center and placed the end half-inch of the trigger in it.
I tightened the loop with a pair of pliers. Then I ran the two dangling
ends of the wire around the mouth of the bottle and twisted it up. I had
something that looked like this:
 
              ___
             |___| <- wire loop for trigger
             |___| <- Wire
            /     \
           |       | <- Mouth of Bottle
            \_____/
            |     | <- Wire
             \ * /
              \ /
           X * X
            X  X
             XX
 
   Where the wire came behind the mouth of the bottle and I twisted it the
wire formed a hole and a tail of wire. I placed my fore and middle fingers
in the two * positions on the diagram and pulled. This pulled the trigger
and which, with a hard sturdy tug, sprayed the mixture pretty far. So this
prevents from toasting your hand like a dumbass.
 
FLAMETHROWER: MODEL TWO
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
   Somewhat similar, this one works alrighty for just torching shit. Almost
all automated, too. You will need all the above except for the spray nozzle
and the addition of the following:
 
NEW MATERIALS:
    Mini Water Pump (see note)
    Paper Towel Roll Tube
    Extra piece of coathanger (optional)
    Duct or electrical tape
    Three or four AA Cell batteries
 
    Note: The water pump can be had from All Electronics Corporation for
          $3.95. Toll free: 1-800-826-5432
 
   Place the water pump and batteries wired to pump (add a momentary pushbutton
switch, n/o in series with the batteries to control on/off pumping) into
the paper towel tubing. You may need to cut down the centre of the tube in
order for the pump to fit in. You can either fix the ejection tube (output
tube) to the roll if it will fit or do like I do and tape a piece of coathanger
near the end of the output tube. Remember the comment about the wind and the
flame blowing? With a mobile tube you can aim, by means of moving the
clotheshanger around, the fuel shit into the flame no matter which way it
blows. Punch a hole in the bottom of the towel roll and run the tube from which
the shit pumps up from (input tubing) into the bottle of fuel mixture. This
whole neat contraption may look as follows (I hope so, damned ASCII drawings):
 
                                        /-------------------- Pump Unit
  Output tubing ---\    __________________________________
                 ______|                                  | <- Batteries at
             _._       |__________________________________|     the back of
  Paper --> |   |                           | | |      |  |
  Towel     |___|                          /  |  \    O|__| <- See NOTE
              |                           /   |   \
              |__________________________|____|____|
                    /                     \   | <------ Input tubing
  Coathanger ______/                       |  |  |
                                          /   |   \
                                         |____|____|
                                         |_________| <- Mixture
 
  NOTE: You may choose to add a pushbutton switch to the battery series as
is done in motorized-pump water machine guns. Glue/tape on another ring of
towel roll or something of the such and insert the switch. The finished
thing gives the effect of holding a gun and pulling the trigger and is an
easy and convenient way to control the "flamethrower". Grip base of the
bottle with your other hand and fire away. The pump I mention shoots up to
some 20 or 25 feet using water and should project the burning material
farther than the 4 or 5 feet allowed by manual spraying with a nozzle.
 
FUEL MIXTURE
=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
   The fuel mixture I used today consisted of a formula somewhat near in
resemblence to the following ratios:
 
         2     parts Gasoline
         1 1/2 part rubbing alcohol
    1/4 to 1/8 part Nail polish remover
 
   The reason for so little nail polish remover is that in addition to the
acetone it contains water, fragrance shit, and coloring, which all takes away
from the flammable qualities. If you can find a more pure or concentrated form
of acetone then increase its proportion in the mixture.
 
   Some variations are definitely in order for you to achieve the best-burning
slowest-burning mixture. The slower the mixture burns the fartherf it will all
shoot. If use use straight alcohol, the shit only shoots out some one or two
feet and the flame is not dense at all. The gasoline provides what you need to
keep going. The addition of kerosene or replacing the gasoline with it is a
variant. Add about the same amount of lighter fluid to the mixture as you do
nail polish remover. Look for anything in the house marked "flammable" and
add it in its proper proportion. In other words, don't add a whole lot if
the ingredients including additives such as coloring and especially WATER.
For instance, you may add about 1/8 part in proportion of hair spray. The
stuff burns nicely but the other deoxypermoethylnitrosclerophospofuck
chemicals take away from full flammable arson die slay burn quality.
 
USES FOR YOUR FLAMETHROWER
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
 
   Now that you have built your keen-o jammin juked-out flamethrower, you must
put it to use or you are stupid. Tack a full sheet of newspaper to a
clothesline or tree with a clothespin or piece of string (respectively, of
course). Fire up and torch the bitch with one blast to see if it will catch.
If not try two rapid blasts in succession and that should get it.
 
   Dogs barking up a storm in your neighborhood? Dogs roaming loose and
shitting in your yard? Pay them a visit with Torch-O-Matic (tm) flamethrower
and roast their ass. First you should give two successive blasts to the face
to stun and burn them. If they are still here and/or still ALIVE, begin
firing blows of hideous concentrated fire sprays at their bodies. For
torture but not death set them afire then cover them with a blanket or old
wet towel. Or throw mud on them and let them look like more shit than they
already do.
 
   Stack of tests on teacher's desk, all with bad grades? Discipline forms?
YOUR discipline form? Torch the fuckers.  Torch the teacher. Douse the lunch
line with gas and torch it. Most school lockers have vent-like slits in them
so aim the nozzle in the vents and fire away. Set books on fire from within.
This is best done if you are using Model Two and can shove the whole output
tube up there. The output tube is only 1/8" thick and will fit nicely
(I've tried but not fried..heh heh!). Set your worst enemies on fire. Set
your friends on fire. Set the school mascot on fire at basketball and
football games. Raise hell in pep assemblies (in most schools termed PREP
assemblies). See the school nerd carrying that backpack full of shit?
Torch the backpack. This includes his hand in the process (if he is
carrying it by hand) but what the fuck kill the loser. Fill the basketball
teams' basketballs with gunpowder. As they practice sneak into the P.E.
supply room, get a bow and arrow, shoot the basketball, then torch the powder
as it flies from the ball. Will hurt the player with the ball but WHAT the
fuck do YOU care?
 
   I'll letcha know of any imporvements I make. If you have any suggestions
or have built an even better flame thrower at such a simple process, let me
know on Centre of Eternity. I have one file on flamethrowers but it's not
convenient to just EVERYONE that wants to commit arson and wreak havoc.
