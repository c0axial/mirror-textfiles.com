The time in which we live seems to be spent in an endless war on drugs. With
the fight to abolish the sale of "illegal" drugs, another fight is made to
break the addictions brought on by the these drugs and the harmful, and more
often than not, DEADLY effects they have on the user. Cocaine is a highly
addictive drug, and cocaine kills. While efforts made to aid those suffering
from addiction are a good cause for humanity, the war on drugs is futile and
is wasting too many of our tax dollars.
 
If there is going to be a war on drugs, and a war to fight the effects of
addition, why doesn't the United States government wage a war on other
addictive drugs? What drugs are these? Well...
 
Television, Caffeine, Alcohol, Tobacco, Cola Drinks, Sugar, Music, Eating,
Coffee, Support Groups, Self-Help, Preservatives, Food, Water, Driving, Work...
Yes, there ARE people out there addicted to work. I could go on into the
millions of things that some people out there are addicted to, but I do not
think that is necessary.
 
Why don't we all just starve ourselves and be lazy mindless idiots? If we're
going to cut out addictions and things that are just soooooo BAD and HARMFUL
for us, why do we draw the line at drugs? Why don't we take away all of life's
pleasures and pitfalls and be vegetables? Why does the government spend
millions to fight drugs? There are too many things that have a harmful and
addictive effect on people OTHER than drugs than to be spending time and
wasting tax dollars on a fruitless effort.
 
If drugs are abolished in this country and more tax dollars are wasted on
keeping drugs out, then I sure as HELL HOPE that prescription drugs are made
illegal right along with marijuana, LSD, and crack. I know people who are
addicted to PRESCRIPTION drugs. They aren't even users of any so-called
"illegal" drugs. No one can say that some prescription drugs don't have a
mind-altering effect on a person. There are people addicted to caffeine
pills and sleeping pills, yet these remain legal.
 
It's hard to say LEGALIZE drugs. I'm for the legalization of marijuana, and
for purposes, more or less, other than for people to get high and have fun.
It's a tie of environmental reasons mixed with some various others, but I
imagine the majority of you would use it only to get fucked and have a good
time. Not saying I discourage this, heh heh no way, I'd much prefer to get
high and look at things from a different perspective than to get drunk and
puke my guts up and pass out. Back to the original point, if marijuana were
legalized, groups would come forward demanding the legalization of ALL drugs
that are classified as "illegal." I'm not really for this, and I don't imagine
the majority of people in America are, either. What I think should happen is
for the "war on drugs" to just cease or to quit wasting so many tax dollars.
Let's feed and clothe the homeless. Let's help those who really need it.
Let's instate environmental programs. Let's STOP wasting money and instead
spend it wisely.
 
I also hope thatt with the "ending" of drugs in this country comes the
cessation of television. The government has the American people at bay with
television. It is one of the biggest drugs in the country. So many people are
addicted to it. It's the perfect thing. Everyone watches it. And we can be
controlled and programmed with it. Outlaw it. Ban it. Get rid of it. Damnit,
if the government is going to banish drug sales and drug use in this country
then ban television sales and television use. It's the same thing. Except
in the latter case, we're almost ALL USERS.
 
Caffeine is just as much a drug as cocaine or LSD. We all use it, most all
of us are addicted to it. We drink Coke (demolish Pepsi, it sucks) like
there's no tomorrow. Imagine if Coca-Cola, ALL cola drinks, no, ALL forms of
caffeine and everything containing the caffeine drug, were made illegal.
We'd have to have that caffeine. We'd do anything to get it. Steal for it.
Kill for it. We'd go through withdrawl and pay anything to have that caffeine.
So why is the government fighting the war on illegal drugs? Why don't they turn
and fight the war against caffeine? Why not fight a war against television?
 
Even if no "illegal" drugs are legalized, the war fought against them should
lose its magnitude. The government should do some good for once and put our
tax dollars where WE want them. Not in a fruitless effort to combat drugs
that are just as serious as the many legal drugs. Alcohol, tobacco, television,
sugar, and caffeine and the five main legal drugs in the United States, and I
see no wars being fought against them.
 
With the amount of cola drinks, coffee, and sugar being consumed by the
American people, we are all plunging into Black and White Death.
 
Write your congresspeople. Support environmental bills. Have them support the
tuna labelling bill now in committee. Read the Toxic Shock File "Supporting
A Safer Environment" for ways you can make yourself heard for the environment.
Encourage them to voice your opinions about where tax dollars should be spent.
 
Find out about NORML and the Freedom Fighters. Both are groups fighting for the
legalization of marijuana, and hold pro-pot rallies and demonstrations all
across the country.
 
Help stop this senseless "effort" and let our efforts be spent on something
more worthwhile.
