The World of Dreams saga will now delve into the events which Ozone Being
created for himself, more specifically, a comment on the Creation of Man.
 
[Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus][Fetus]
 
The Choosing of the Three has been told for countless generations, the true
tale of how The Followers of Fetus became The Toxins and united with Fetus.
This tale is perhaps best told in "The Proclamation of Fetus" in Toxic Shock's
"Meet the Toxins" file.
 
The Toxins were annointed with His Placental Juices. As told many a time of
the coming of man, "The Fetus" best depicts the original incarnations of Man
Adam and Woman Eve.
 
On September 17th of eons ago, Man and Woman were created by Ozone Being for
his pleasure and for puppets to pull around. It was also some generations,
some say Sixty-Nine (my Fetus, where'd THAT number cum from, I do wonder?),
prior on that same September 17 day that Gross Genitalia was formed, moulded
from a laser-cut duplicate of Fetus' Left and Right Testes.
 
In case you haven't put two and two together, today is the once again
honourable day which mortals are prone to call a "birthday." Today has not
been a very good one, and Fetus is perturbed at Myself for not convincing
a friend to abort her child.
 
Nevertheless, millions of followers of The Doctrine across Dirtball kneel in
reverence to the God on this Our Sacred Day. Henceforth all binary star systems
discovered in the universe will be acknowledged and hailed as a prophetic
symbol of The Two Testes of Gross Genitalia and all who gaze upon Them will
receive wisdom and insight to the fortunes and failures which do lie ahead
in their lives.
 
While the Doctrine has been called both sacrament and sacrilege, while it has
been seen as all Three satanic, satirical, and saturated in love-juices,
the Toxins are praised by many, by the True Aborters, the ones who will
receive eternal protection from abortion laws.
 
On this My Day of Recognition I see a vision given to me by Ozone Being, from
Fetus as He sees fit, that one day many will join the call of His Teaching
and aid in The Spreading of Toxicity. Many are to come who will oppose the
Mighty Force, but None shall prevail over those who are blessed with
Abortion.
 
I also see a vision of a land where there is no oppresssion, no pollution,
no totalitarian government, where all will worship as they choose and none
will be sought out for any wrongs. There is no more Inquisition...we have
freedom of religion...but there are those who...we still must fight...for
our Mother-given rights... pardon me, this is not a Kenny and Tzipora
lyrics sheet.
 
I have a dream...that one day...
 
I am not Martin Luther King nor Nelson Mandella nor M.C. Hammer...
 
This Day is a Hallowed One, and I am proud to be Toxin. In my reign of
many eons and file career of just under a Human Year, I have written 54
works and contributed to two Flaming Fetus Issues. While the second will not
be released for a month or so, it will be the next file, #100. We are aiming
to make it our best and longest file yet, and if it takes two months to
get it released, then it will just take that long. It will be released
before December, bringing our file total to 100 files in under a year. I
consider this a profound accomplishment.
 
September 11 is the Date the World began.
September 17 is the Date of the Great Conception of Puppets.
 
So mote it be.
