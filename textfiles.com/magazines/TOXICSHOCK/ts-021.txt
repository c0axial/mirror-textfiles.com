                                 The Stampede
 
                            Written by Fetal Juice
                          As an insult to Kymberli!

     Slowly forming out of the murk, faces condense, moving and speaking, and
unfortunately for me, of all people, they had very bad breath.  Echoing from
ear to ear in my spaced out cranium the words 'What happened?' scream.  What
happened they ask?  Oh it's pure horror!!  Pure HORROR!  I looked up and they
were stampeding! I tried to flee for my life but I couldn't move fast enough,
and I was crushed to a pulp by the moving mass!
     I guess it all started when Kym showed up rather pissed about my giving
her name to a particularly promiscuous lass of the herd mother of 2000.(It was
a great year, that year of 86.)
 
     "Why did you have to name her after me? WHY!"
     "I just thought it'd be a way to honor your memory."
     "That reminds you of ME?!? You're sick!"
     "But I love you anyways."
     "Get away from me!"
 
     She got back in her Audi 5000 with her royally fucked up and wimpy engine
and drove off like the easy lay she is.  As usual I dropped to the ground
laughing my balls off.  Quite sometime later I heard from the other side of
the ranch a car, then the sounds of an automatic weapon.  I look up and it was
Rambo Kym.  Holding an M1 rifle and firing into the herd. I shouted "NO! Stop
you'll kill them!" just about that time they started stampeding and here I
am..  Wonder if I'll ever be able to raise earthworms again knowing now how
thoughtlessly they flee from crazies with fully automatic machineguns...
