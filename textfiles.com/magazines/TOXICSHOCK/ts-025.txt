 An aborted fetus is a terrible thing to have in your house, especially if
you are having friends over for dinner. Yes those nasty little bastards
will rip you house clean down to the foundation, if they so desire, and
make for very unwanted dinner guests. Nevertheless, Fetus the Destroyer sends
his servant aborted and miscarried fetuses out on the job; they must succeed.
 
 Todd and Cindy were a happily married couple in their early thirties. They
were very sociable people, and went often to parties and other social
gatherings. It was time to return the favor and invite some friends over for
an evening of chat, food, wine, cheese, the general goody-goody bullshit
adult party. Good idea? Yes. No. Hell no. Todd and Cindy did not know of the
Fetal Existence. Yes one of those slimy little underdeveloped bastard fetuses
was slopped down in a lawn chair in the garage.
 The friends arrived. "Oh hi come into our happy home! Let me get you a
glass of wine and pick your nose for you!" and other such friendly little
uncalled for gestures. The fetus heard these people having a merry and jolly
time. He could not STAND it. He hopped down on his tiny little legs and
wobbled over to the stairwell. He pulled his way up and snuck into the den.
Luckily no one was around, so he snuck into a broom closet. One of the guests,
being a tremendous dumbass, spilled her drink on the tiled kitchen floor.
"Oh just get a mop out of that closet and it's no problem to clean it up."
The fetus grabbed a broom and steadied it in his underdeveloped hands.
 The guest opened the closet and grabbed a mop.Her eyes turned pale and big.
The fetus stared onward through its large black eyes, futher horrifying the
lady.
 "Good evening bitch. How must I beat thee?" With this the fetus rammed
the broomstick down the lady's throat so she could not scream for help.
He then removed it, having demolished her throat, and began violently
beating the shit out of the lady. The lady was critically hurt and fetus
stopped. With her last strain of life the lady looked at the fetus and
said "You son of a..." but the fetus stopped her and finished her,
"..bitch? Son of a bitch? No my mommy aborted me." and with that the
fetus whacked her over the head with a powerful whap and cracked the
bitch's skull. He dragged her into the closet before her brains had a
chance to ooze out of her head.
 
 Mary killed her baby. Billy the Stud Punk had raped her and gotten her
pregnant. She aborted the baby. The baby was discarded but it grew into
a fetus by Coathanger's will. Fetus the Mighty took the apprentice fetus
under his control and sent it out on a mission to find Mary.
 The fetus traveled to the mall with a baseball bat in hand. He entered
a back door at the loading docks of Sears. He had to bypass a nearby
security guard. Easily handled. The fetus snuck up behind the guard and
squeaked "How must I beat thee?" The guard turned around in a daze and
drew his night stick in a daze; he saw no one behind him. The fetus
conked the guard's foot with the bat and the guard looked down upon the
grotesque slimy fetus. The fetus said "Aah, I know how I must beat thee."
With that the fetus slammed the bat into the guard's groin. The guard
doubled over in pain, and the fetus slammed a mighty slap of the baseball
bat into the guard's skull. The fetus grabbed the cerebellum of the
guard's brain and began to snack on it. The fetus dropped the baseball
bat and picked up the night stick. It walked off, still munching on the
cerebellum.
 The fetus crept out into the main area of the mall. It wandered up
and down the mall incessantly, unnoticed by the passing crowds. Aaah!
Who did the fetus see? MARY. Mary the Bitch. Mary the Aborter. Mary the
KILLER. The fetus wanted Mary DEAD. He did not intend to go away
unsatisfied.
 The fetus willed in power that only Mary see him. He willed that no one
else notice Mary. Mary saw the fetus. And she screamed. Damnit, why the
hell did they all have to SCREAM and SHRIEK so loud and long? She
screamed a scream of Death. Yet no one noticed her. She tried to grab
people and beg for help, yet she passed right through them. The fetus
had willed her to pass into an invisible dimension with him. He tapped
the night stick against his hand and said "Um mm mm. You just HAD to
have that abortion, didn't you?" Mary was utterly confused, and frightened
to say the least. "Who the hell are you? What demon are you?"
 "Demon, bitch? Demon? I am the child you killed."
 "But..but..I was RAPED! I couldn't have carried you inside me!!"
 "Oh no excuses, you loose whore!" The fetus leaped onto Mary's chest and
sunk its razorlike claws into her breasts. Mary shrieked again and the
fetus pissed in her mouth. "Shut up bitch!" The acidic urine burned Mary's
throat to where she could scream no longer.
 "How must I beat thee? Ah yes, I must..." OOOMPH! The fetus shoved the
round end of the night stick deep into Mary's vaginal tract. Through
the clothes he pushed it. The fabric snapped and ripped, and the night
stick rammed its way up. The fetus jerked it out quickly and whapped
Mary over the head with the hard stick. Mary slumped to the ground and
the fetus ripped off a breast for an afternoon snack. It walked away.
 
 Fetus the Destroyer was playing a game of Intergalactic Croquet one day
when Planet Earth really pissed him off by shifting on its axis and
knocking itself out of line with the last pole. "Damnit those Earthlings
sure don't know how to preserve a planet! How Must I Beat Thee?"
 Releasing his anger Fetus raised his Hyperspace Croquet Mallet high
above his Fetal Head and slammed it down on the Planet.
 The planet hurled through space, miscarried and aborted fetuses left
behind to do work in other dimensions.
