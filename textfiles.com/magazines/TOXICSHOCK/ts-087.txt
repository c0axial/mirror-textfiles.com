   I sat at a table, eating a meal I took for granted. There are people all
over the world starving and suffering and here I am, in relatively perfect
health, eating country ham, beans, potatoes, and cantaloupe. It's great to
have a break from fast food once in awhile, and all the other junk shit. But
look at the situation of the World's People -  the true population that's
wallowing in agony while I throw away a crust of a roll. And something came
on the news.

   I looked over the countertop to see the 25" television screen. A luxury
that we take for granted. The news was on. I rarely watch the news. But I
watched with eagerness. A group of people were trying to stop a shopping
centre from going up on a site of the Battle of Bull Run. They were speaking
of the high cost of preserving battle sites from Our Country's Civil War. While
it may serve a memory for most, to others it's prime place to develop and put
up high-cost apartment complexes and shopping centres. And a thought hit me, as
if some outside force compelled me to write. I sat around to-day thinking of
things to write about but yet, I thought of nothing. Was it Fetus? Could have
been. Could have been my higher self or my spirit guide giving me an insight to
the future.
 
   We sit around and attempt to preserve the past, for our benefit and to
keep the history for those which will come after us. We protect battle sites,
artifacts, books, and other momentos from our proud history. We preserve
nothing today. It is said we could have a hell of a nuclear war at any time.
We could break out in the most destructive of World Wars, Number Three, THE
ENDING. And what future generations there might by some chance be, living in
lead-laden shelters under The Earth, will emerge into the radiation and see a
page in history. We are destroying Mother Earth, Gaea, even as we breathe our
next breaths. We make efforts to stop the desecration yet it seems as though
are efforts are futile and useless; we continue to plunge headlong into Hell.
With every known description of Hell as religions depict it, the many words,
the many beliefs, if those are what Hell is about then we're mighty close to
it, and we are entering The Gates right now in the Nineties. At the rate we
are going, War will destroy our planet and only then will Earth be protected;
by those future scraggly generations emerging into the Radiation - those who
will preserve Earth as a battle site, another page in history. Only then will
our planet be protected and preserved. It will be for history's sake, but will
it be worth it?
 
   In the file I did entitled "The Bummers", I took from Greenpeace Magazine
the different bombs in use and on the drawing board by the Pentagon, the
"Dirty Dozen" of nuclear weapons. Some were of course satirical looks at
nuclear weapons as they are. If we continue to throw billions upon billions
of dollars into the nuclear arms race, those weapons will finally get their
use as we plunge into war as a result of bad ties and NATIONAL DEBT.
 
   But all this talk might make one wonder. Where would we be if we HAD no
nuclear weapons? Raging countries in the Middle East would take advantage
of what technologies they had at their fingertips to overthrow our country and
run us into submissive control and poverty, we would languish in the cruelties
of a country that saw America as a threat to their existence. Without
protection we are at high risk of being taken. But with protection, WITH all
the bombs and nulcear missiles, aren't we STILL at risk? Which way do we
turn? There are trials we must face either way. Inevitably, if the situation
is not controlled, this planet will slide on through the Gates of Hell and
the entire surface of the planet will become a wasteland, a radiation-infested
battlefield. Our generation, the generations before us, will be done with. Our
history will be gone. We will BECOME another page in history. We will engage
in war. We all lose. Turn the page.
 
   We think we are big in technology, and think we have the top hand in the
arms race. We think we are protected. We are far FROM there. These are no
technological advances. Bloody Afterbirth is right. We are evolving into our
past. There will be no true future for us, we will only relive the past of
long ago. Will we turn back to the old pages in history, will we rewrite it
and better ourselves and our planet, will we save our planet and ourSELVES
from utter destruction, or will we END the book of history and drive our own
SELVES into EXTINCTION?? I think the latter is the choice we're taking, and
we will truly reach that goal soon if something is not done. But what can be
done? I need not repeat myself. We cannot do without weapons, we cannot live
and exist WITH them. Decide what YOU would do. Take your OWN course of action.
In today's world, we truly live a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book. History
is a Which-Way book, and I sure would like to see a happy ending if an ending
at all. Write your congresspeople, tell them your views. I will make no
decisions for you, I only make my own.
 
   If no true advances are made to save ourselves and save our planet, the
generations of the Uncertain Future will be looking to preserve the World
War III battleground. Singular. Earth will be the battleground, and Earth as
we know it now will be another momento from history.
