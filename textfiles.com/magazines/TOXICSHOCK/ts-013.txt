     It was as if She were dreaming...  Billions of little things crawling all
over Her skin...  She tried to shake them, but they clung to Her.  She could
not take much more...
     The things reproduced...They spread all over Her body...They destroyed
Her flesh as they moved, leaving nothing behind.  Fires...Oh!  The Pain!
Smoke blinded Her, the stench of Her burning filled her nostrils.  Machines
dug into Her body, ripping and tearing!  Desperately she tried to shake them
off but still they clung to her, like a babe to its mother's breast.
     They raped Her...They shaved away Her very flesh, removing Her
protection.  They put things into the air, suffocating Her, She could no
longer breathe.  Her body heaved, but still They clung to her.
     Poisons ran through Her life-blood, destroying all parts of Her that
depended upon the nourishment...
     They ripped vital organs from Her, She rapidly lost the ability to
sustain her own life...  And without a host, the Virus died also...

     Mankind rapes, burns, and poisons Mother Earth.  We are a virus, She our
host.  We destroy the only spaceship we have that is capable of carrying us
through space for a lengthy period of time.  We fight the members of our own
household, for we are all one family.  We are killing our Mother even as you
read this.  The list of extinct species grows longer...  How long before Homo
Sapiens appears on that list?
