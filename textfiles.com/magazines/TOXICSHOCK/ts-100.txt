   As I look back over this issue of The Flaming Fetus, I feel a little
tinge of pride creeping in.  This is one gigantic leap towards what I think
the newsletter should be.
   As has been the case quite frequently of late, we have taking information
from various sources (mainly HIGH TIMES and The Emperor Wears No Clothes),
and, as usual, we do so without permission.
   We don't ask permission for a couple of reasons...  Firstly, and most
obviously, to do that, we'd have to risk them turning us down, and no doubt
being pissed off when we do it anyway.
   But the main reason is this...  If anyone putting out any information of
the nature and quality that one finds in HIGH TIMES and in Jack Herer's book
(and other such sources), does not want that information spread far and wide
in any manner possible, I would like to personally meet with that person and
beat the bloody hell out of them.
   We're trying to educate you people about the history of drugs, the REAL
dangers of drugs, what is happening in society, and other such things.  We
have a message, and we're trying to spread it.
   The fact that we find the information worthy of our time to key in and
then spread around, and even give credit to the original author/publisher,
should be payment enough for whomever we borrow from.
   And if it isn't...if that person wants more than that...if that person
wants to get in the way of a group that is actually TRYING to do SOMETHING
to correct the terrible situation this country is in, that person can fuck
themselves.
   And you know what?  Anyone who spouts off about "I'm against drug
prohibition" or "Free The Weed!" or "We're becoming a fascist police state!"
and then sits on their ass and does NOTHING about it...they can fuck
themselves too!

   I thought the world would take care of itself.  Wrong.
   I thought the situation would get better without my help.  Wrong.
   I thought there were plenty of others helping, so I wasn't needed.  Wrong.

   Any excuse you can come up with...Wrong.
   You're afraid that if you write the media groups or your political
representatives that you'll be questioned?  Then you're too damned much of a
loser to be doing anything illegal anyway.  The Machine will run you over
eventually.
   You're not old enough to vote yet?  Then you'll not have enough time to
write when you ARE old enough to vote.  Get off your ass now, develop good
habits while you're young.  Because if you don't, when you are old enough to
vote, you may not be ABLE to vote.
   You're not a registered voter?  They don't know that.  Regardless, you
mean to tell me you can't spare the few minutes it takes to register?
   You don't have enough time?  Bullshit!  You don't have the five minutes
it might take to write one damn letter?  ONE letter a week, and you could
have all the newspapers, television stations, and congressmen taken care of
in a few months!
   You haven't joined any pro-Legalize groups because you don't want to be
on "The List"?  Don't come crawling back sniveling and begging for help to
those groups when you get busted.

   Stand up for your rights.  Stand up for what you believe in.
   This country was founded by people who were pissed off.  Their rights
were being violated, and they STOOD UP for it, they didn't take any shit
from the apparently superior English.  They were few, and they weren't well
financed.  They had no real advantages over the British.
   But those freedom fighters fought.  They demanded liberty and justice.
   And damnit, they WON.
   They WON the war, they WON the revolution.

   They GOT their liberty, their justice, their RIGHTS.

   WE CAN TOO.  But NOT if you sit on your ass doing NOTHING!

   Things will NOT get better, if YOU DON'T HELP!

   You may only be one person...But there are MILLIONS of people LIKE YOU
out there!  If we raise our voices, if we pressure the pressure groups, we
CAN WIN BACK our rights and our freedoms!

   So...Read this newsletter, and spread it around.  Print it out and hand
it out to your friends and relatives, people on the street.  Mail it to
various places.  Subscribe to HIGH TIMES, buy books like The Emperor Wears
No Clothes...  Educate yourself and those around you.  Write letters to the
media groups, the power groups, your congressmen.  Don't do nothing.  We
need you.  We all need each other in this war.  If we band together and
unite for a common cause, we can and we will win.
  The Government uses the military to fight its wars...but like the saying
goes...the pen is mightier than the sword...

   Bloody Afterbirth is working on an essay on the beneficial uses of
marijuana/hemp, but it may be a few months before he releases it.

   Upcoming topics for The Flaming Fetus--
      o  The Violation of Rights in America

      o  No More Wars!

   It's probably old news by now, but Ripco has returned.  Call up and help
out with the effort to bring the board to full glory once again.

   Centre Of Eternity may be going through remodeling soon..Whether or not it

   We have actually begun to call out and take our files with us, we've
appeared in CuD recently, so it looks like our Infestation Tour has finally
begun...If you have ideas or suggestions or desires that you think would be
nifty-keen-o for us to do, let us know and we'll see what we can do.

   Contrary to some less intelligent observations, we are a very serious
group...Well, serious about what we do, though what we do may not be very
serious.
   The group has gone through countless changes since our Conception in late
November '89, but we have decided upon an overall purpose in life which
should make it easier for you to decide if you want to work with us.
   This country is systematically removing the rights of the citizens.
Those rights are violated each and every day in some form or other.  Well,
we don't like that.  So we do what we can to present knowledge and
information, education if you will, about such issues as the Drug culture
and the Computer underground in an effort to counteract the propaganda and
horseshit the Gumbyment, corporations, PDFA, whatever, feed the people.
   We are now, basically, a Counterculture group.  Yes, we will do
traditional Toxic Shock work on occasion, but we are beginning to work in a
groove, and the Counterculture is one thing we are all very interested in.

   Files are what we do the most right now...Original files, excerpts from
books or magazines (or whole damn books and magazines), parodies, essays,
stories, whatever.

   All it takes to become a member in our group is reasonable intelligence,
interest in the things we stand for, a desire to contribute and spread our
files, and enough guts to stand up for what you believe in, even if what you
believe in is contrary to some of the stuff we believe in.

   If you are interested in joining, call the Centre of Eternity and leave
feedback to King Diamond, he will let one of us know about your interest.

      I may be reachable on Demon Roach Underground sometime soon, but these
      are the quickest ways you can get in touch with me...The numbers for
      the two boards are listed later...

   What we ask of you is simple...
      1) Write a file in which you tell us about yourself, your views,
         attitudes, opinions, etc, that would make you valuable to us.  Tell
         us why WE need YOU.  (Because if it looks like YOU need US, then
         you can fuck yourself.  We don't need anybody just wanting to go
         along for the ride.)  We really don't care what groups you have
         done work for or are doing work for, but if you feel the need to
         give glory to them, do so.  But keep in mind that your membership
         in other groups doesn't mean jack shit to us as far as what you
         can do, unless it happens to be on the par of LOD.  (And if you
         are in a group that good, tell us why the hell you would want to
         work with Toxic Shock.)

      2) Give us one or two (or more..) samples of your work.  Whether it is
         original (preferred) or copied (to show us what you have access to)
         we will look at it...

                      WHEN HEMP SAVED GEORGE BUSH'S LIFE

           -taken from Jack Herer's "The Emperor Wears No Clothes"-

                                 @!#&^*&#!$^


   One more example of the importance of hemp:  Five years after cannabis
hemp was outlawed in 1937, it was promptly re-introduced for the WWII effort
in 1942.

   So, when the young pilot George Bush bailed out of his burning airplane
afer a battle over the Pacific, little did he know:

   o  Parts of his aircraft engine were lubricated with cannabis hemp seed
      oil;

   o  100% of hislife-saving parachute webbing was made from US grown
      cannabis hemp;

   o  Virtually all the rigging and ropes of the ship that pulled him in
      were made of cannabis hemp;

   o  The firehoses on the ship (as were those in the schools he had
      attended) were woven from cannabis hemp; and,

   o  Finally, as young George Bush stood safely on the deck, his shoes'
      durable stitching was of cannabis hemp, as it is in all good leather
      and military shoes to this day.

   Yet Bush has spent a good deal of his career eradicating the cannabis
plant and enforcing laws to make certain that no one will learn this
information -- possibly including himself...

                THE BUSH/QUAYLE/LILLY PHARMACEUTICAL SELL OUT

   In America, marijuana's most outspoken opponent is none other than
President George Bush, former Director of the CIA under Gerald Ford (1975 to
January 1977) and past director of President Reagan's "Drug Task Force"
(1981-1988)

   It is a little known fact that, after leaving the CIA in 1977, Bush was
made director of Eli Lilly by none other than Dan Quayle's father and family
who owned controlling interest in the Lilly company and the Indianapolis
Star.  (BA:So THAT'S why Quayle actually got VP!)

   The entire Bush family were large stockholders in Lilly, Abbot, Bristol
and Pfizer, etc.

   After Bush's disclosure of assets in 1979, it became public that Bush's
family still has a large interest in Pfizer and substantial amounts of stock
in the aforementioned drug companies.

   In fact, Bush actively lobbied illegally both within and without the
Administration as Vice President in 1981 to permit drug companies to dump
more unwnted, obsolete or especially domestically-banned substances on
unsuspecting Third World countries.

   While Vice President, Bush continued to illegally act on behalf of
pharmaceutical companies by personally going to the IRS for special tax
breaks for certain drug companies manufacturing in Puerto Rico.  In 1981,
Vice President Bush was personally ordered to stop lobbying the IRS on
behalf of the drug companies by the US Supreme Court itself.

   He did -- but they (the pharmceuticals) still received a 23% additional
tax break for their companies in Puerto Rico who make these American
outlawed drugs for sale to Third World countries.

      OUTRAGEOUS!!

son's banking problems, eh?

     One hundred sixteen million pounds of cannabis sativa were imported into
the United States in 1935.  As we emerged from the Great Depression,
cultivation and commerce of hemp was a thriving industry.  Who squashed it?
And why?

     Jack Herer's landmark book, The Emperor Wears No Clothes, shows how
anti-marijuana laws - ostensibly passed in order to suppress the supposedly
insolent, criminal behavior of African- and Mexican- Americans, and in
responce to alleged criminal violence and drug-induced insanity by its users -
were actually a giant red herring aimed at removing the hemps plant's
resurgence as an agricultural competitor to the emerging petrochemical
industry (due to breakthrough decorticating and harvesting technologies) by a
few powerful companies.  In this excerpt, Herer details the machinations
behind the passage of Reefer Madness laws.

A CONSPIRACY TO WIPE OUT THE NATURAL COMPETITION
When mechanical hemp fiber stripping machines and machines to conserve hemp's
high-cellulose pulp became state-of-the-art, available and affordable in the
mid-1930s, the enormous timber acreage and businesses  of the Hearst Paper
Manufacturing Division, Kimberly Clark (USA), St. Regis - and virtually all
other timber, paper and large newspaper holding companies - stood to lose
billions of dollars and perhaps go bankrupt.
     Coincidentally, DuPont had just patented a new sulphuric-acid process for
wood pulp paper in 1937 which would, according to their own corporate records
and historians, account for over 80% of all its railroad carloadings for the
next 50 years.
     If hemp had not been made illegal, 80% of DuPont's business would never
have come to be; nor would 80% of the pollution inflicted on our Northwestern
and Southeastern rivers have occured.  In an open marketplace, hemp would have
saved the majority of America's vital family farms and would probably have
boosted their numbers, despite the Great Depression of the 1930s.
     Competing against the enviromentally-sane hemp-paper technology would
have jeopardized the lucrative financial schemes of the Hearst, DuPont and
DuPont's chief financial backer, Andrew Mellon of the Mellon Bank of
Pittsburgh.  These industrial barons and financiers knew that machinery to
cut, bale, decorticate (to separate the fiber from the high-cellulose hurd),
and process hemp into paper was becoming available in the mid-1930s.  Cannabis
hemp would have to go.
     A series of secret meetings was held.  Mellon, in his role as Herbert
Hoover's Secretary of the Treasury, in 1931 appointed his future
nephew-in-law, Harry J. Anslinger, to be head of the newly reorganized Federal
Bereau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (FBNDD), a post he would hold for the
next 31 years.

SOCIAL REORGANIZATION
In DuPont's 1937 Annual Report to its stockholders, the company strongly urged
action (investment) despite the economic chaos of the Great Depression.
DuPont was anticipating "radical changes," predicting that "the revenue
raising power of the government" would soon be "converted into an instrument
for forcing acceptance of sudden new ideas of industrial and social
reorganization."
     In *The Marijuana Conviction* (U. of Virginia Press, 1974), Richard
Bonnie and Charles Whitebread II detailed this process:
     *"By the fall of 1936, Chief Treasury Consul Herman Oliphant had decided
to employ the taxing power [of the Federal government], but in a statute
modeled after the National Firearms Act and wholly unrelated to the 1914
Harrison [narcotics] Act.  Oliphant himself was in charge of preparing the
bill.  Anslinger directed his army to turn its campaign toward Washington.
     The key departure of the marijuana tax scheme from that of the Harrison
Act is the notion of the prohibitive tax.  Under the Harrison Act, a
non-medical user could not legitmately buy or possess narcotics.
    "To the dissenters in the Supreme Court decisions upholding the act, this
clearly demonstrated that Congress' motive was to prohibit conduct rather then
raise revenue.  So in the National Firearms Act, designed to prohibit traffic
in machine guns, Congress 'permitted' anyone to buy a machine gun, but
required him to pay a $200 transfer tax and carry out the purchase on an order
form.
     "The Firearms Act, passed in June 1934, was the first act to hide
Congress's motives behind a 'prohibitive' tax.  The Supreme Court unanimously
upheld the anti-machine gun law on March 29, 1937.
     "Oliphant, who had been siting on the secret marijuana tax bill for two
years, had undoubtedly been awaiting the Court's decision on the prohibition
tax on machine guns, now had the Treasury Department suddenly introduce its
marijuana bill just two weeks later, on April 14, 1937."*
     Thus, DuPont's decision to invest in new technologies based on "focusing
acceptance of sudden new ideas of industrial and social reorganization" makes
sense.

THE PROHIBITIVE MARIJUANA TAX
In the secret Treasury Department meetings conducted between 1935 and 1937
prohibitive tax laws were drafted and strategies plotted.  "Marijuana" was not
banned outright:  An "occupational excise tax upon dealers, and a transfer tax
upon dealings in marijuana" were called for.  Importers, manufacturers,
sellers and distributors had to register with the Secretary of the Treasury
and pay the occupational tax.  Transfers were taxed a $1 an ounce, $100 an
ounce if the dealer was unregistered.  Also, sales to an unregisterd taxpayer
were prohibitively taxed.  At this time the "raw drug" cannabis sold for one
dollar an ounce.  The year was 1937.  New York State had exactly one narcotics
officer.  (Now it has a network of thousands of officers, agents and snitches,
and twenty times the penal capacity.)
     After the Supreme Court decision of March 29, 1937, upholding the
prohibition of machine guns through taxation, Herman Oliphant made his move. 
On April 14, 1937, he introduced the bill directly to the House Ways and Means
Committee instead of to other appropriate committees such as Food and Drug,
Agriculture, Textiles, Commerce, etc.  The reason may have been that Ways and
Means is the only committee to send its bills directly to the House floor
without the act having to be debated upon by other committees.  Ways and Means
Chairman Robert L. Doughton quickly rubber-stamped the secret Treasury bill
and sent it sailing through Congress to the President.

"DID ANYONE CONSULT WITH THE AMA?"
However, even withen his controlled committee hearings, many expert witnesses
spoke out against the passage of these unusual tax laws.  Dr. James Woodward,
for instance, who was both a physician and an attorney, testified on behalf of
the American Medical  Association (AMA).  He said, in effect, the whole fabric
of federal testimony was tabloid sensationalism!  No real testimony was being
used in its passage!  This law could possibly in ignorance deny the world a
potential medicine, especially now that the medical world was just beginning
to find which ingredients in marijuana were active.  He stated to the
committee that the whole reason the AMA hadn't come out against the marijuana
tax law sooner was that it had been described in the press for 20 years as
"killer weed from Mexico."
     The AMA doctors had just realized, "two days before" the spring, 1937,
hearings, that the plant Congress intended to outlaw was known medically as
cannabis - the benign substance used for 100 years in America with perfect
safety.  Woodward also stated the main reason he did not know this fact was
that all the meetings had been held in secret by the Treasury Department over
the past two years.
     He and the AMA were quickly denounced by Anslinger and the entire
Congressional committee, and curtly excused.  (The AMA and Roosevelt
administration were strong antagonists in 1937.) When the Marijuana Tax Act
bill came up for oral report, discussion, and vote on the floor of Congress,
only one pertinent question was asked from the floor: "Did anyone consult with
the AMA and get their opinion?"
     Representative Vinson, answering for the Ways and Means Committee
replied, "Yes, we have a Dr. Warton [mistaken pronunciation of Woodward?] and
the AMA are in complete agreement!"
     With this memorable lie, the bill passed, and became law in September
1937.  A federal police force was created, able to demand millions of wasted
years in jail and even the deaths of individual Americans, in order to save
polluting industries, and to reinforce policies of racial hatred.
     Testimony before Congress in 1937 for the purpose of outlawing marijuana
consisted almost entirely of Hearst's and other sensational and racist
newspaper articles read aloud by Harry J. Anslinger, director of the Federal
Bureaau of Narcotics (FBN). (This agency has since evolved into the Drug
Enforcement Administration [DEA].)  Harry J. Anslinger was director of the new
Federal Bureau of Narcotics from its inception in 1931 for the next 31 years,
and was only forced into retirement in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy,
after Anslinger tried to censor the publication and publishers of Professor
Alfred Lindsmith's "The Addict and the Law," (Washington Post, 1961) and to
blackmail and harass his employer, Indiana University.
     Anslinger had come under attack for racist remarks as early as 1934 by a
US senator from Pennsylvania, Joseph Guffey, for such things as referring to
"ginger-colored niggers" in letters circulated to his department heads on FBN
stationery.

OTHERS SPOKE OUT, TOO
Also lobbying *against* the Marijuana Tax Act's passage with all its energy
was the National Oil Seed Institue, representing the high quality machine
lubrication producers as well as paint manufactures.  Speaking to the House
Ways and Means Committee in 1937, their general counsel, Ralph Loziers,
testified eloquently about hemp seed oil that was to be, in effect, outlawed:
     *"Respectable authorities tell us that in the Orient, at least 200
million people use this drug; and when we take into consideration that for
hundreds, yes, thousands of years,  practically that number have been using
this drug.  It is significant that in Asia and elsewhere in the Orient, where
poverty stalks abroad on every hand and where they draw on all the plant
resources which a bountiful nature has given that domain--it is a significant
fact that none of those 200 million people has ever, since the dawn of
civilzation, been found using the seed of this plant or using the oil as a
drug.
     "Now, if there were any deleterious properties or principles in the seed
or oil, it is reasonable to suppose that these Orientals, who have been
reaching out in their poverty for something that would satisfy their morbid
appetite, would have discovered it...
     "If the committee please, the hemp seed, or the seed of the cannabis
sativa l., is used in all the oriental nations also in part of Russia as food. 
It is grown in their fields and used as an oatmeal.  Millions of people every
day are using hemp seed in the Orient as food.  They have been doing that for
many generations, especially in periods of famine...
     "The point I make is this--that this bill is too all inclusive.  This
bill is a world encircling measure.  This bill brings the activities--the
crushing of this great industry under the supervision of a bureau--which may
mean its suppression.  Last year, there was imported into the US 62,813,000
pounds of hemp seed. in 1935 there was 116 million pounds..."

PROTECTING SPECIAL INTERESTS
Prior to 1931, Anslinger was Assistant US Commissioner for Prohibition. 
(Anslinger, remember, was hand-picked to head the new Federal Bureau of
Narcotics by his uncle-in-law, Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury under
President Herbert Hoover.)  The same Andrew Mellon was also the owner and
largest stockholder of the sixth largest bank (in 1937) in the United States,
the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, one of only two bankers for DuPont from 1928 to
the present. (DuPont, in its entire 170-year history, has borrowed money ffrom
banks only twice, once to buy control of General Motors in the 1920s.
Dupont's banking business is the prestigious plum of the financial world.)
     In 1937, Anslinger testified before Congress, saying, "Marijuana is the
most violence causing drug in the history of mankind."  This along with
Anslinger's outrageous marijuana statements and beliefs was made to the
Southern-dominated Congressional committee and is now an embarrassment to read
in its entirety.
     For instance, Anslinger kept a "Gore File," culled almost entirely from
Hearst and other sensational tabloids--e.g., stories of axe murders, where one
of the participants reportedly smoked a joint four days before committing the
crime.  Anslinger pushed on Congress as a fact that about 50% of all violent
crimes committed in the US were committed by Spaniards, Mexican-Americans,
Latin Americans, Filipinos, Negroes, and Greeks and that these crimes could be
traced directly to marijuana.  Not one of Anslinger's marijuana  "Gore Files"
of the 1930s is believed true by scholars who have painstakingly checked the
facts.  In fact FBI statistics, had Anslinger bothered to check, showed at
least 65% to 75% of all murders in the US were then--and still are--alcohol
related.
     As an example of his racist statement, Anslinger read into US
Congressional testimony (without objection) stories about "coloreds" with big
lips luring white women with jazz and marijuana.  He read of two  Negro
students at the University of Minnesota doing this to a white coed "with the
result of pregnancy."  The Congressmen of 1937 gasped at this and at the fact
that this drug seemingly caused white women to touch or even look at a
"Negro."

SELF-PERPETUATING LIES
Virtually no one in America other then a handful of rich industrialists and
their hired cops knew that their chief potential competitor--hemp--was being
outlawed under the name marijuana.
     That's right.  Marijuana was most likely just the excuse for hemp
prohibition and economic suppression.  The water was further muddied by the
confusion of marijuana with locoweed (jimsonweed).  The situation was not
clarified by the press, which continued to print the disinformation into the
1960s.  And even at the dawn of the 1990s, the most estravagant and ridiculous
attacks on the hemp plant draw national media attention.
     But serious discussions of the health, civil liberties and economic
aspects of the hemp issue are frequently dismissed as being nothing but an
"excuse so that people can smoke pot."
     One must concede that, as a tactic, confusing the public about the nature
of hemp and its relationship with "marijuana" has been very successful.

                                  ISOMERIZATION
                      Transforming Hemp to Primo Marijuana
                                  by  Mel Frank

The mysterious isomerizer was supposedly able to turn the most bogus bunkweed
into mind-bending hash oil. Did this miracle-machine really work? Mel Frank
delves deep into the isomerizer's murky past.


   Almost forgotten by today, a small industry sprouted, flourished and died.
The industry was the manufacture and sale of isomerizers -- machines sold
through head shops and mail-order houses that supposedly could miraculously
transform mediocre marijuana into potent hash oil. The oil could then be smoked in an oil-pipe or sprayed on inferior marijuana to enhance its effect.
   The earliest ad I could fimd for an isomerizer appeared in the seventh issue of a fledgling magazine called HIGH TIMES (December/January 1975) about the time HIGH TIMES was first becoming a showcase for drug paraphernalia. Thai
Power, Inc., an Alaskan firm, claimed their "Isomerizer" would "convert
cannabidiol (CBD), an inert and undesirable element, to pure THC resulting
in an increase in up to six times" in potency. The ad also claimed the Isomer-
izer could "convert low-rotating forms of THC as found in low-quality
marijuana and hashish to the more psychedelic and spiritual high-rotating
forms." Wonder of wonders! For only $275 (1975 dollars) amateur alchemists
could transform garbage to gold! The Isomerizer was the dream-machine of '70s
marijuana culture.
   In 1976, Thai Power introduced the mew model ISO2 for $159, but soon other
companies began to vie for the dollars of dopers looking for extraordinary
super-highs. Competition from imitators, such as the Maximizer at $29.95 and
Kik at $69.95, dropped the price  of the ISO2 to $99 in 1979. How popular was
the Isomerizer? An ad for the ISO2 in the March 1978 issue of HEAD magazine
claimed that over 20,000 had been sold. But by 1982, isomerizer ads and
isomerizer imitators had all but disappeared, due to introduction of anti-
paraphernalia laws.
   The idea of isomerization was introduced in a slim booklet, CANNABIS
ALCHEMY by David Gold, published in 1973. All the claims -- transformation of
inactive CBD to psychoactive THC, and conversion of low-rotating THC to
high-rotating THC isomeric forms -- appear in CANNABIS ALCHEMY. Whether the
commercial machines COULD isomerize CBD to THC as described by Gold is not the
issue I want to address here. They did a decent job of extracting raw marijuana resin from buds, leaves and stems. But unfortunately, isomerizers never got the chance to work as the dream-machine buyers expected.

WHAT WENT WRONG?
   Gold plainly says in his book that "the quantity of CBD is important." But
Gold and many other writers (including this writer) were led astray by the
faulty data published in the scientific journals of the day.
   Everyone -- isomerizer-makers and consumers -- wrongly believed that the
inferior marijuana sold in this country was poor in THC and rich in CBD. But
the fact is that inferior commercial marijuana in the USA is generally poor
in THC AND very poor in CBD. Isomerizer buyers spent time and effort trying to
convert something (CBD) that simply wasn't there.
   The assumption that inferior marijuana was rich in CBD began when scientists published reams of research on marijuana in the 1960s and early '70s that confused CBD with other cannabinoids, mainly CBC (cannabichromene). Early test procedures could not s
   Substantial CBD is fairly common in North African and Central Asian
varieties (Table 1), but usually not in varieties from Colombia, Mexico,
Jamaica, and US homegrown -- the majority of marijuana consumed here.
Surprisingly, high concentrations of CBD are not that uncommon in some Thai
and Afghani varieties. But smugglers seldom bring such CBD-rich varieties to
the USA simply because the product is mediocre compared to the THC-rich Thai
and Afghani, and, therefore, not worth importing.

   Weedy hemp fluorishes from Quebec to British Columbia and south throughout
most of the continental United States. Most often, you'll find weedy hemp in
the Midwest, in the East, and in most major cities. The best places to look
are along the banks of streams, fields, railroad lines, highways, in empty
lots, and other recently cleared areas. Cannabis is a colonizer, which means
that the plant "colonizes" areas that are suitable for growth and empty of
competing plants.
   The hemp varieties that inhabit the US were imported from cool, temperate
areas of Europe and Asia. This may account for the notable absense of weedy
hemp in the hotter regions of the southern US, where there is ample rainfall
and fertile soil. Apparently, these varieties either do not thrive in very
hot climes or do not compete well with local weeds. Weedy hemp is absent or
rare in areas with tight or compacted clay soils. Also, hemp is uncommon in
particularly arid areas and is nearly absent from the dry, mountainous regions
and deserts of the West.
   Distribution is concentrated in the Central and Midwest states, where hemp
was planted during WWII, part of the wartime effort to counter the
possibility that Japan would cut off America's supply of Manila hemp and
create a fiber shortage.
   Do not be disheartened if you've never encountered weedy hemp. Hemp can
be found in nearly every conceivable site, from lake shores to cracks in
concrete walls to upland pine-tree plantations. When scientists constructed
the map shown here in 1965, they found that the spread of weedy hemp had
slowly but steadily accelerated for the past hundred years. The authors
ominously warned that the dreaded hemp weed was still increasing in both
range and incidence. Very likely you'll find hemp in places not indicated
on the map.
   For example, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1979, I was given weedy
hemp collected from an empty lot that had been overgrown with various weeds
for as long as anyone could remember. The plants may well have been
descendants of a hemp strain planted generations ago for hemp fiber.
   I don't know if isomerizers can transform CBD to THC. I'm only saying
that for isomerizers to work, you must use hemp with its CBD, not
marijuana. So, break out those relic isomerizers, and let's find out if they
work. Maybe this article will help resurrect the long-lost, mystical art of
isomerization.

     Why Not Use Hemp To Reverse The Greenhouse Effect & Save The World?

           -taken from The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack Herer-

   In early 1989, Jack Herer and Maria Farrow put this question to Steve
Rawlings, the highest ranking officer in the US Department of Agriculture
who was in charge of reversing the Greenhouse Effect, as the USDA world
research facility in Beltaville, MD.

   First, we introduced ourselves and told him we were writing for Green
political party newspapers, then we asked Rawlings, "If you could have any
choice, what would be the ideal way to stop or reverse the Greenhouse
Effect?"

   He said, "Stop cutting down trees and stop using fossil fuels."

   "Well, why don't we?"

   "There's no viable substitue for wood for paper, or for fossil fuels."

   "Why don't we use an annual plant for paper and for biomass to make
fuel?"

   "Well, that would be ideal," he agreed.  "Unfortunately there is nothing
you can use that could produce enough materials."

   "Well, what would you say if there WAS such a plant that could substitute
for all wood pulp paper, all fossil fuels, would make most of our fibers
naturally, make everything from dynamite to plastic, grows in all 50 states
and that one acre of it would replace 4.1 acres of trees, and that if you
used about 6% of the US land to raise it as an energy crop -- even on our
marginal lands, this plant would produce all 75 quadrillion billion BTUs
needed to run America each year?  Would that help save the planet?"

   "That would be ideal.  But there is no such plant."

   "We think there is."

   "Yeah?  What is it?"

   "Hemp."

   "Hemp!" he mused for a moment.  "I never would have thought of it...  You
know, I think you're right.  Hemp could be the plant that could do it.  Wow!
That's a great idea!"
   We were excited as we outlined this information and delineated the
potential of hemp for paper, fiber, fuel, food, paint, etc., and how it
could be applied to balance the world's ecosystems and restore the
atmosphere's oxygen balance with almost no disruption of the standard of
living to which most Americans have become accustomed.

   In essence, Rawlings agreed that our information was probably correct and
could very well work.

   He said, "It's a wonderful idea, and I think it might work.  But, of
course, you can't use it."

   "You're kidding?" We responded.  "Why not?"

   "Well, Mr. Herer, did you know that hemp is also marijuana?"

   "Yes, of course I know, I've been writing about it for about 40 hours a
week for the past 17 years."

   "Well, you know marijuana's illegal, don't you?  You can't use it."

   "Not even to save the world?"

   "No.  It's illegal," he sternly informed me.  "You cannot use something
illegal."

   "Not even to save the world?" we asked, stunned.

   "No, not even to save the world.  It's illegal.  You can't use it.
Period.

   "Don't get me wrong.  It's a great idea," he went on, "But they'll never
let you do it."

   "Why don't you go ahead and tell the Secretary of Agriculture that a
crazy man from California gave you documentation that showed that hemp might
be able to save the planet and that your first reaction is that he might be
right and it needs some serious study?  What would he say?"

   "Well, I don't think I'd be here very long after I did that.  After all,
I'm an officer of the government."

   "Well, why not call up the information on your computer at your own USDA
library?  That's where we got the information in the first place."

   He said, "I can't sign out that information."

   "Well, why not?  We did."

   "Mr. Herer, you're a citizen.  You can sign out for anything you want.
But *I* am an officer of the Department of Agriculture.  Someone's going to
want to know why I want all this information.  And then I'll be gone."

   Finally, we agreed to send him all the information we got from the USDA
library, if he would just look at it.

   He said he would, but when we called back a month later, he said that he
still had not opened the box that we sent him and that he would be sending
it back to us unopened because he did not want to be responsible for the
information now that the Bush administration was replacing him with their
own man.

   We asked him if he would pass on the information to his successor, and he
replied, "Absolutely not."

   In May, 1989, we had virtually the same conversation and result with his
cohort, Dr. Gary Evans of the US Department of Agriculture and Science, the
man in charge of stopping the global warming trend.

   In the end, he said, "If you really want to save the planet with hemp,
then you (hemp/marijuana activists) would find a way to grow it without the
narcotic (sic) top -- and then you can use it."

   This is the kind of frightened (and frightening) irresponsibility we're
up against in our government.

                    Marijuana vs Tobacco - Which is worse?

                             -Bloody Afterbirth-

                        \paraphrased from The Emperor/

!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!

   I have gotten tired of hearing about how marijuana does as much damage to
your lungs as 20 cigarettes.  I saw recently someone's estimation that
Cannabis is as bad as 115 cigarettes.
   Now, while I think he probably meant 15, it still shows the
misconceptions people have about how damaging Cannabis really is.  I've been
doing a lot of research lately for a paper I'm doing on Marijuana, and this
is the data I have found on Marijuana vs Tobacco...

*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*&^%$#@!@#$%^&*


                                 Brain Damage


   In 1974, California's governer Ronald Reagan told the LA Times that "the
most reliable scientific sources say permanent brain damage is one of the
inevitable results of the use of marijuana."
   He was referring to the Heath/Tulane University study.
   The results of that study are almost like a Bible for drug prohibitionists,
and they are widely distributed as "evidence" that marijuana kills brain
cells.
   With this study, monkeys were made to smoke a godawful amount of pot (the
equivalent of 30 joints a day), and began to die after three months.
   Heath opened the brains of the dead monkeys and, comparing the number of
dead brain cells in them to those in monkeys which had not smoked marijuana,
found out that the ones who HAD smoked pot had very very many dead brain
cells.
   On the surface, this looks bad for marijuana.  But the real story behind
that research wasn't found out until later.

   The monkeys were strapped into chairs and gas masks and then were forced
to smoke the equivalent of "63 Colombian strength joints" in five minutes,
through the gas masks, losing no smoke.  Obviously the monkeys couldn't
breathe any oxygen (otherwise known as suffocation).

   The Heath report left out the huge amount of carbon monoxide the monkeys
were forced to inhale while smoking all of this pot.  It is produced by
anything that is burning...a cigarette, a joint, a house. . .

   Carbon Monoxide is the same shit that comes out of our exhaust pipes.
The reason why running your car in a closed garage will kill you after a
while.  It kills brain cells dead (heh heh).

   The monkeys weren't getting any oxygen, and 3-5 minutes of that alone
would kill brain cells.  That, coupled with the Carbon monoxide they were
inhaling, makes it very obvious that the brain damage was caused by
suffocation and Carbon monoxide poisoning.  Researchers consider the
implications of marijuana to be foolish and, to be blunt, wrong, because of
the other factors of this research left out of the report.


                                 Grey Matter


   Everyone has heard of the "grey matter" (the most recent term I've heard
applied to it) that gunks up your system after you smoke a joint.  This is
the same stuff that the urinalysis tests can discover up to a month after
you get high...The "grey matter" is actually THC metabolites, and they do
indeed stay in the body that long...
   However, contrary to reports of how bad this "grey matter" is, the active
ingredients in THC are used up in the first two passes through the liver.
The remaining metabolites are inert and attach to fatty deposits so your
body can get rid of them later.  This is a perfectly natural thing for
metabolic "leftovers" to do.


                                 Lung Damage


   I will say up front that any hot smoke you are breathing into your lungs
is bad for your lungs...That should be obvious even to the most ignorant of
people.  And, I will also admit that smoking marijuana is more damaging to
your lungs than tobacco smoke.

   When you are smoking the leaves.

   That's right, the leaves.  Except in desperate times, most people smoke
the buds if there is any way possible.

   The buds contain, at the most, 1/3 as many carcinogenic tars as tobacco.
And almost all of the carcinogens will be removed from the smoke by using a
water bong.  This is something the government casually forgets to mention.

   Even so, the hot smoke WILL hurt the lungs some, no matter what you're
smoking.

   1 - A water bong cools the smoke
   2 - A heavy pot smoker would smoke about 6 joints day.
   3 - A tobacco smoker can smoke 20-60 cigarettes a day.

   Smoking 6 joints with cooled down smoke is obviously not going to do
anywhere near as much damage to your lungs as 20-60 cigarettes will do.
Fetal Juice can attest to how bad an experience it is to use tobacco in a
bong, so that option is not open to tobacco smokers.
   And, marijuana is also nowhere near as addictive as heroin...tobacco is.

   Something else they neglect to mention is that one can eat marijuana and
get stoned with absolutely no damage what-so-ever...ever tried to eat
tobacco?  I did once, and I can tell you it is not an experience you will
voluntarily repeat.


   A Dr. Donald Tashkin of UCLA did a report in which he (in accordance with
others) stated that there has NEVER been a case of lung cancer caused by
smoking marijuana.
   He compared the effects of marijuana and tobacco smoking on 29 areas of
the lungs.  There was one and ONLY one area of them that was more irritated
by marijuana than by tobacco.  The large air passageway.  Marijuana is 15
times more irritant in that place only.
   In all the other areas, marijuana smoke has either a neutral or a
positive effect.  (The smoke dilates the smaller air passages allowing more
oxygen to be taken into your lungs)


   Smoking anything will do damage in the form of pre-cancerous lesions.
These lesions are simply any tissue abnormality (abrasions, eruptions,
redness, etc).  Those lesions caused by tobacco are radioactive, those
caused by marijuana are not.  Those people who developed the lesions from
tobcco smoking usually develop lung cancer from them.  None of the marijuana
smokers have.

   Yes, the lesions caused by tobacco smoke are radioactive.  Tobacco is
grown in soil which has been fertilized with radioactive materials.  Studies
have shown that smoking 1.5 packs of tobacco a day for one year is the
same as having 300 chest X-rays using the older and slower X-ray film
without any lead protection.

   Tobacco radiation remains active for 21.5 years.
   There is no radiation in marijuana.

   340,000 - 395,000 people die every year from tobacco use.
   Noone has died from marijuana use in 8000 years.

   You decide.  Which is truly more dangerous to you?

                         PDFA:  SLICKLY PACKAGED LIES

                         -keyed by Bloody Afterbirth-

                           from The Emperor, p. 74

   Another recent development has been the formation of the PDFA
(Partnership for a Drug Free America) by the Media PDFA, which primarily
in-kind funding from ad agencies and media groups.  The PDFA makes available
(free of charge to all broadcast and print media) slick public service ads
directled primarily against marijuana.

   In addition to releasing such meaningless drivel as an ad which shows a
skillet ("This is drugs." on which an egg is frying ("This is your brain on
drugs.  Any questions?"), PDFA is not above lying outright in their ads.

   In one ad, the wreckage of a train is shown.  Now, everyone will agree
that no one should attempt to drive a train while high on marijuana.  but a
man's voice says that anyone who tells you that "marijuana is harmless" is
lying, because his wife was killed in a train accident caused by marijuana.
This contradicts the direct sword testimony of the engineer responsible for
that disaster; that "this accident was not caused by marijuana."  And it
deliberately ignores his admissions of drinking, snacking, watching TV,
generally failing to pay adequate attention to his job, and deliberately
jamming of the train's safety equipment prior to the accident.

   In another ad, a sad looking couple is told that they cannot have
children because the husband used to smoke pot.  This is a direct
contradiction both of clinical evidence developed in nearly a century of
cannabis studies and of the personal experiences of millions of Americans
who have smoked marijuana and borne perfectly healthy children.

   And in yet another ad, the group was so arrogant in putting out lies that
it finally got into trouble.  The ad showed two brain wave charts which it
said showed the brain waves of a 14-year-old "on marijuana."

   Outraged, researcher Dr. Donald Blum from the UCLA neurological studies
center told KABC TV (Los Angeles) news November 2, 1989, that the chart
actually shows the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep - or in a coma.

   He said that he and other researchers had previously complained to the
PDFA, and added that marijuana user's brain wave charts are much different
and have a well-known signature, due to years of research on the effects of
marijuana on the brain.

   Even after this public refutation, it took the stations and PDFA weeks to
pull the spot, and no apology or retraction had yet been offered for the
deceit, as this edition of Emperor went to press.

   Perhaps a more valid ad for the PDFA to produce and the networks to run
would show a skillet ("This is the PDFA.") and an egg frying ("These are the
facts.").

   [BA:I think reversing the dialogue there would be more effective, showing
       the PDFA getting fried in the facts. . . .]

Despite repeated mailings and telephone conversations, the editors of HIGH
TIMES have been unable to convince anyone in the media to investigate and
report on the potential of hemp, and the real reasons for marijuana's illegal
status, to the American public.  This month, we're calling on YOU to help.  If
every HIGH TIMES reader sends a letter and a copy of their favorite hemp story
to 60 Minutes, Nightline, 20/20 and the New York Times, we might see some
favorable coverage about marijuana in the news and on TV.
     When sending out your letter to the media, don't copy this letter word
for word.  Try to express your own feelings on the subject in a friendly way.
It's a good idea to send along a reprint of a HIGH TIMES article or other news
clipping, as proof of the hemp argument for legalization of marijuana.
     REMEMBER:  The news media is starting to pick up on this information.  If
you send a letter, it will have a positive effect on the future of
legalization.

Dir Sir or Madam,

I have recently become aware that "marijuana" is actually called "hemp" and,
according to a film made by the United States Goverment of Agriculture called
"Hemp for Victory," the plant is a valuable natural resource.  The goverment
encouraged farmers to grow marijuana/hemp for important military supplies in
World War II - just a few years after marijuana was made illegal.  According
to this film, the "covered wagons" that helped our pioneer ancestors settle
the west were covered with marijuana!  Other articles I have read present
other incredible uses for  hemp: fuel oil, food, clothing, paper,
medicine--even cellophane!
     How is it that our government could make a film about the importance of
hemp to the war effort, show farmers how to cultivate it, and then forty years
later start a war aimed at those who grow it?  If George Washington, the
Father of Our Country, were alive today, he'd be thrown in jail, have his
possessions taken away, and lose all of his rights.  Washington grew acres and
acres of marijuana.  The same goes for Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.
     Gatewood Galbraith, who's running for Governor of Kentucky, has claimed
that the oil companies pressured the goverment to make marijuana illegal so
hemp-farmers would be unable to compete with the petrochemical industry.
Since over 300,000 people are arrested for growing or possessing hemp every
year, isn't this an important story?
     Please investigate this and let the people learn the truth.  Thank you.
     Yours truly,
     (SIGN YOUR NAME HERE)

Dear ............:

 As a registered voter, I'd like to express my strong disapproval of the
continued prohibition of marijuana.  The legalization of marijuana would
provide great economical and ecological benefits.  Hemp is the best natural
source of fuel, fiber, paper, and clothing.

 In over 8,000 years, no one has ever died from marijuana, yet we have over
400,000 deaths every year attributed to alcohol or tobacco.  Meanwhile,
there are thousands of sick people who are denied access to the most
effective medicine for their ailments, just because that medicine happens to
be marijuana.

 Surely we can find a better use for the billions of dollars spent pursuing
and eradicating this useful plant.  Thank you for your time.

This is by no means a complete volume, and no attempts are made to make it so.

In today's world the United States Government seems to want all efforts made
to win the war on drugs. While they really aren't, relatively speaking, doing
shit about it, can anyone say that they WILL win? Shit. With the awareness
that (most) people of today have, and the severity of the "problem," it isn't
likely that the war on drugs will be won on either side. While the majority
will sit around and fuck with this stupid and senseless war, the rest will
take a more intelligable approach to it and say fuck the whole thing and keep
right on going as usual.

First of all, marijuana legalization is becoming more and more a key issue.
True, a large portion of the mary jane movement is fought for the sole purpose
of getting legal rights for people to grow their own dope safely, the more
intelligent of us want it legalized for different purposes (while free dope
would be quite nice indeed). Such purposes seem to include "reversal" of the
greenhouse effect, use of hemp fibers for methanol production, paper, and
clothing, and for the magickal and ritual uses and purposes of marijuana
moreover than just getting high and having a really good time.

The problem is posed that if marijuana becomes legal that the rest of the drug
movement will come forward wanting all drugs legal. All users will want
"their" drug legalized, whether it be cocaine, heroin, meth, or LSD. Would it
be feasable to have users take classes on their drug? Classes could be
mandatory, in the process creating jobs and revenue, and instruct users on the
potential effects and side-effects of the drug and provide them with
statistics and vital facts before they are allowed to legally use the drug.
For those who become dependent on the drug, rehab programs could be offered to
those who want them, thereby creating even more jobs.

                                Mary Jane Growth

Almost any idiot knows how to grow good weed, I mean, after all, it *IS* a
weed. However, if you're growing indoors, and even outdoors, you won't get the
quality dope you deserve without a little special attention and you'll end up
with Merry Guano rather than Marijuana.

If you keep your butt in the clear, you can beat street prices, which rarely
fall below the last year's norm, by growing your own dope. This is not as
hard as some people will lead you to believe, and with homegrown dope you at
least KNOW what you're getting. The bad thing with buying from someone else is
that you don't know if you're getting shitty harsh dope, dope with so little
THC it wouldn't get a flea on a dog's ass high, or parsley and oregano. Now
you know you're getting the real thing and since this shit's your own, you can
take measures and treatments to get your dope to its best.

The grass will need quite a bit of light, probably a minimum of eight hours a
day. The plant will usually grow better outdoors in its natural environment
and will also require little attention.

You know what I mean by that; I'm not referring to watching your crop for
the pigs and neighbors who will probably be arresting/reporting you and
stealing your dope for their own use. You do need to take precautions if
growing an outdoor crop, of course and as a standard knowledge, and for this
reason the more sophisticated growers turn to the indoors. I have even heard
stories of people growing dope in barns to avoid the scare of having their
crop spotted aerially. Some people have been known to grow it in flowerpots,
under their houses in the rich dirt, and other ingenious methods to avoid
detection.

I ran across a file done by an anonymous author, without even a title, about
four years back on growing mary jane. It is an excellent file for the
beginning grower and will help even the most experienced growers. I would like
to give credit where credit is due, and have excerpted and revised information
from this informative file.

Some people begin their plants in indoor growing boxes and then transplant
them to an outdoor environment. However, it is advisable to start the plants
where they are to grow. This way there are no risks of shock of transplant to
kill some of the seedlings.

Prepare the soil by turning it over a few times. Add about a cup of hydrated
lime per square yard of soil and a little bit of a good water-soluable
nitrogen fertilizer. The soil should then be watered several times and left to
sit about a week.

The plants should be planted about three feet apart, as stacking them too
close will result in stunted plants. The plants will be needing water during
their growing season, but not a whole lot. Too much water around the roots
will rot the root system.

Weed will grow well in corn or hops, and these plants will provide some
camouflage. It will not grow well in rye, spinach, or pepperweed. Our friendly
Kentucky growers have always had a sizable advantage of course. Corn and
tobacco are widely grown crops in that state. Corn fields are abundant.
Intelligent growers seek to avoid having their crops being spotted by frequent
air checks (as are known to occur in Western Kentucky) and resort to clever
methods of raising their weed in tobacco barns.

Both male and female plants produce THC resin, however, the male is not as
strong as the female. Mary jane can reach a height of twenty feet and obtain
a diameter of 4 1/2 inches. Dear God, answer our prayers please.

The male dies in the 12th week of growing, and the female will live another
3 to 5 weeks. Female plants can weigh twice as much as males when they are
mature. The marijuana soil should compact when you squeeze it, but should also
break apart with a small amount of pressure and absorb water well. Turn loose
some worms in your soil. If they hang around, the soil is good. If not, change
it. Worms also help keep the soil loose.

Your seeds should be green, meaty, and healthy appearing. Drop a seed on a
hot frying pan. If it "cracks," your seeds are probably good for planting
purposes. You should soak the seeds in distilled water overnight before
planting. Be sure to plant in the ground 1/2" deep with the pointy end up.
Healthy seeds will sprout in about five days.

If you are growing in a room you should put tar paper on the floor and buy
sterilized bags of soil from a nursery. You will need about one cubic foot of
soil for each plant. Your plants will need about 150 ml of water per plant
per week, maybe a little more, and should get fresh air. However, this air
should contain NO tobacco smoke.

Your plants should have at least eight hours of light per day. As you increase
light, the plants grow faster and tend to show more females/less males.
Sixteen hours per day seems to be an ideal combination. Another idea is to
interrupt the night cycle with about one hour of light (pull out the Sears or
Radio Shack timer if you're using grow lights in a room or closet). The room
should be painted white or covered with aluminum foil to reflect the light.

For lighting, figure on 75 watts per plant or one plant per two feet of
fluorescent tube. Do not use "cool white" types. Your lights should be an
average of 20 inches from the plant and never closer than 14 inches. You might
choose to mount them on a rack and move them every few days as the plants
grow.

If you don't want seeds, just good dope, pick the males before they shed their
pollen. The female will use some of her resin to make the seeds. About three
to five weeks after the males are gone, the females will begin to wither and
die. This is the time to pick.

If you want seeds, let the male shed his pollen then pick him. Let the female
go another month and pick her.

To cure the plants, they must be dried. On large crops, you can construct a
drying box or drying room. You need a heat source which will make your space
130 degrees. The box/room must be ventilated to carry off the water
vapor-laden air and replace it with fresh.

A "quick cure" method is to cut the plant at the soil level and wrap it in a
cloth so as not to lose any leaves. Take out any seeds by hand and store them.
Place all the leaves on a cookie sheet or aluminum foil and put them in the
middle shelf of an oven, set on broil. In a few seconds, the leaves will smoke
and curl up. Stir them around and give another ten seconds before you take
them out.

You can use a sunlamp on the plants as they begin to develop flower stalks.
You can snip off the flower, right at the spot where it joins the plant, and
a new flower will form in a couple of weeks. This can be repeated two or three
times to get several times more flowers than usual.

The following plant problems tips were provided in the file I used. Always
check the overall environmental conditions prior to passing judgement - soil
around 7 pH or slightly less - plenty of water, light, fresh air, loose soil,
no water standing in pools.

   For the past several years, HIGH TIMES has advised readers to join NORML.
Although many of you did so, many failed to follow our advice out of
concerns about ending up on some mysterious "list."  Still others complained
about NORML's lack of effectiveness.
   Meanwhile, many readers have eagerly taken other advice presented in HIGH
TIMES.  Then, when the DEA's Operation Green Merchant unlawfully seized
customer lists from garden stores, their names ended up on the very same
lists they so carefully avoided by NOT joining NORML.  In an ironic twist of
fate, many of these same people have turned to NORML to aid their legal
defenses.
   Operation Green Merchant was aimed at putting HIGH TIMES out of business
by destroying our advertising base.  Our readers have thwarted their plans:
Your continued support has kept us in business.  Instead, Green Merchant
alerted thousands of people to what a sham and a scam the war on drugs is.
As a result, dozens of organizations are forming to end the war.  From now

they're accomplishing, and how you can help.

                 A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM GATEWOOD GALBRAITH:
Recently, my campaign staff acquired hemp seed and processed hemp seed oil
and hemp seed cake.  On April 24, 1990, I rode in a Volkswagen diesel pickup
truck with the inventor of a conversion unit allowing the vehicle to operate
on vegetable oil.  We drove three miles on less than one pint of hemp seed
oil right here in Lexington, Kentucky.  Hemp emissions at the tail-pipe were
negligible compared to diesel.  Alas, American farmers can't supply this
wonderful commodity because of some reefer madness thing.  Achieve a cleaner
environment by supporting my campaign.  When you contribute, we'll send you
a sample of hemp seed oil in a polypropylene specimen bottle, complete with
a certificate and info on how my campaign can help your environment.

Gatewood Galbraith, profiled in the March 1990 issue of HIGH TIMES, is
running for Governer of Kentucky in 1991 on a platform of legalizing hemp as
a way to improve that state's economy.  Galbraith's message is that hemp, or
marijuana, must be legalized for the benefit of Kentucky, whose economy once
relied on its hemp farming.

    SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF NATIONAL DRUG AND CRIME EMERGENCY.

    (a) FINDINGS.--The Congress makes the following findings:

         (1) Next to preserving the national security, protecting the
         personal security of individual Americans, especially
         children, by enacting and enforcing laws against criminal
         behavior is the most important single function of government.

         (2) The criminal justice system in America is failing to
         achieve this basic objective of protecting the innocent and
         punishing the guilty.

         (3) Reform is needed to ensure that criminals are held
         accountable for their actions, that they receive swift and
         certain punishment commensurate with their crimes, and that
         the protection of innocent citizens takes priority over other
         objectives.

         (4) The principle of individual accountability should also
         dictate policies with respect to drug users.  Users should
         face a high probability of apprehension and prosecution, and
         those found guilty should face absolutely certain measured
         response penalties.

         (5) According to the Uniform Crime Reports issued in 1989 by
         the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), violent crime
         known to law enforcement reached an unprecedented high in
         1988.  A violent crime occurred ever 20 seconds.

         (6) The Department of Justice estimates that 83 percent of
         Americans will be victimized by violent crime during their
         lifetime.

         (7) The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that violent
         crime in America rose by 23 percent during the period
         1984-1988.

         (8) The National Drug Control Strategy reports that in
         certain large cities more than 80 percent of the men arrested
         have tested positive for illegal drug use.

         (9) According to the Department of Justice, the total number
         of Federal and State prisoners grew by 90 percent from 1980
         to 1988.  The growth rate of the total prison population
         during the first 6 months of 1989 exceeded the largest annual
         increase ever recorded in 64 years of recordkeeping.  The
         6-month growth rate translates to a need of almost 1,800
         additional prison beds per week.

         (10) In 1985, 19 States reported the early release of nearly
         19,000 prisoners in an effort to control prison populations,
         according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

         (11) According to the United States Bureau of Justice
         Statistics, 63 percent of State inmates were rearrested for a
         serious crime within 3 years of their discharge from prison.

         (12) The criminal justice system is overloaded and does not
         deliver swift and certain penalties for violating the law. 
         In America today, there exists crime without punishment. 
         Such conditions imperil the public safety, jeopardize the
         rule of law and undermine the preservation of order in the
         community.

    (b) DECLARATION OF NATIONAL DRUG AND CRIME EMERGENCY.--(1) Guided by
         the principles that energized and sustained the mobilization
         for World War II, and in order to remove violent criminals
         from the streets and meet the extraordinary threat that is
         posed to the Nation by the use and trafficking of illegal
         drugs, the Congress declares the existence of a National Drug
         and Crime Emergency beginning on the date of enactment of
         this Act and ending on the date that is 5 years after the
         date of enactment of this Act.

         (2) During the National Drug and Crime Emergency declared in
         paragraph (1), it shall be the policy of the United States
         that--

              (A) every person who is convicted in a Federal
              court of a crime of violence against a person or a
              drug trafficking felony (other than simple
              possession) shall be sentenced to and shall serve a
              full term of no less than 5 years' imprisonment
              without release;

              (B) prisoners may be housed in tents, and other
              temporary facilities may be utilized, consistent
              with security requirements; and

              (C) the Federal courts may limit or place a "cap"
              on the inmate population level of a Federal or
              State prison or jail only when an inmate proves
              that crowding has resulted in cruel and unusual
              punishment of the plaintiff inmate and no other
              remedy exists.

    SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

    For the purposes of this Act--

         (1) the term "crime of violence against a person" means a
         Federal offense that is a felony and--

              (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
              threatened use of physical force against the person
              or property of another; or

              (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk
              that physical force against the person or property
              of another may be used in the course of committing
              the offense; and

              (C) for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10
              years or more is prescribed by law; and

         (2) the term "drug trafficking crime," (other than simple
         possession) means any felony punishable under the Controlled
         Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled
         Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.) or
         the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et
         seq.), other than a felony constituting a simple possession
         of a controlled substance for which the maximum term of
         imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law.

               TITLE I--ELIMINATION OF CRIME WITHOUT PUNISHMENT

            Subtitle A--National Drug and Crime Emergency Policies

    SEC. 101. JUDICIAL REMEDIES FOR PRISON CROWDING.

    (a) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this section is to provide for reasonable
    and proper enforcement of the eighth amendment.

    (b) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that--

         (1) the Federal courts are unreasonably endangering the
         community by sweeping prison and jail cap orders as a remedy
         for detention conditions that they hold are in conflict with
         the eighth amendment; and

         (2) eighth amendment holdings frequently are unjustified
         because of the absence of a plaintiff inmate who has proven
         that detention conditions inflict cruel and unusual
         punishment of that inmate.

    (c) AMENDMENT OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.--(1) Subchapter C of
         chapter 229 of part 2 of title 18, United States Code, is
         amended by adding at the end thereof the following new
         section:

              "Section 3626.  Appropriate remedies with respect
                to prison crowding.

              "(a)(1) During the period of the National Drug and
              Crime Emergency, a Federal court shall not hold
              prison or jail crowding unconstitutional under the
              eighth amendment except to the extent that an
              individual plaintiff proves that the crowding
              causes the infliction of cruel and unusual
              punishment of that inmate.

              "(2) The relief in a case described in paragraph
              (1) shall extend no further than necessary to
              remove the conditions that are causing the cruel
              and unusual punishment of the plaintiff inmate.

              "(b)(1) A Federal court shall not place an inmate
              ceiling on any Federal, State, or local detention
              facility as an equitable remedial measure for
              conditions that violate the eighth amendment unless
              crowding itself is inflicting cruel and unusual
              punishment on individual prisoners.

              "(2) Federal judicial power to issue equitable
              relief other than that described in paragraph (1),
              including the requirement of improved medical or
              health care and the imposition of civil contempt
              fines or damages, where appropriate, shall not be
              affected by paragraph (1).

              "(c) Each Federal court order seeking to remedy an
              eighth amendment violation shall be reopened at the

    (A) IN GENERAL.--(1) It is the policy of the Federal Government that
         convicted prisoners confined in Federal prisons, jails, and
         other detention facilities shall work.  The type of work in
         which they will be involved shall be dictated by appropriate

         involved.  Such labor may include, but not be limited to--

              (A) local public works projects and infrastructure

         convicted prisoners to work.

    (b) PRISONERS SHALL WORK.--Medical certification of 100 percent
    disability, security considerations, or disciplinary action shall be
    the only excuse to remove a Federal prisoner from labor participation.

    (c) USE OF FUNDS.--(1) Subject to paragraph (2), any funds generated by
         labor conducted pursuant to this section shall be deposited

    Congress a report making recommendations for legislation to--

         (1) ensure that private businesses and labor do not suffer
         unfair consequences from the repeal in subsection (a); and

         (2) encourage greater private sector participation in prison
         industries and create incentives for cooperative arrangements

         each work day; and

         (2) only prisoners with no history of violent criminal

         SEIZURE.--Evidence which is obtained as a result of a search
         or seizure shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a court of
         the United States on the ground that the search or seizure

         of the United States, if the search or seizure was carried
         out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable
         belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment. 
         The fact that evidence was obtained pursuant to and within

         of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by a
         statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant

         State court fails to raise a claim in State proceedings at
         the time or in the manner required by State rules of
         procedure, the claim shall not be entertained in an
         application for a writ of habeas corpus unless actual
         prejudice resulted to the applicant from the alleged denial
         of Federal right asserted and--

              "(1) the failure to raise the claim properly or to
              have it heard in State proceedings was the result
              of State action in violation of the Constitution or
              laws of the United States;

              "(2) the Federal right asserted was newly
              recognized by the Supreme Court subsequent to the
              procedural default and is retroactively applicable;
              or

              "(3) the factual predicate of the claim could not
              have been discovered through the exercise of
              reasonable diligence prior to the procedural
              default.

         "(e) A one-year period of limitation shall apply to an
         application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in
         custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.  The
         limitation period shall run from the latest of the following
         times:

              "(1) the time at which State remedies are
              exhausted;

              application created by State action in violation to
              the Constitution or laws of the United States is
              removed, where the applicant was prevented from
              filing by such State action;

              "(3) the time at which the Federal right asserted
              was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,
              where the right has been newly recognized by the
              Court and is retroactively applicable; or

              "(4) the time at which the factual predicate of the
              claim or claims presented could have been
              discovered through the exercise of reasonable
              diligence.".

         final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the
         court of appeals for the circuit where the proceeding is had.

         "There shall be no right of appeal from such an order in a
         proceeding to test the validity of a warrant to remove, to
         another district or place for commitment or trial, a person
         charged with a criminal offense against the United States, or
         to test the validity of the person's detention pending
         removal proceedings.

         "An appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the
         final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention
         complained of arises out of process issued by a State court,
         or from the final order in a proceeding under section 2255 of
         this title, unless a circuit justice or judge issues a
         certificate of probable cause.".

    (c) APPELLATE PROCEDURE.--Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure is amended to read as follows:

         "Rule 22. Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings

         "(a) APPLICATION FOR AN ORIGINAL WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.--An
         application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the
         appropriate district court.  If application is made to a
         circuit judge, the application will ordinarily be transferred
         to the appropriate district court.  If an application is made
         to or transferred to the district court and denied, renewal
         of the application before a circuit judge is not favored; the
         proper remedy is by appeal to the court of appeals from the
         order of the district court denying the writ.

         "(b) NECESSITY OF CERTIFICATE OF PROBABLE CAUSE FOR
         APPEAL.--In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention
         complained of arises out of process issued by a State court,
         and in a motion proceeding pursuant to section 2255 of title
         28, United States Code, an appeal by the applicant or movant
         may not proceed unless a circuit judge issues a certificate
         of probable cause.  If a request for a certificate of
         probable cause is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall
         be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be
         considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems
         appropriate.  If no express request for a certificate is
         filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to constitute a
         request addressed to the judgements of the court of appeals. 
         If an appeal is taken by a State or the government or its
         representative, a certificate of probable cause is not
         required.".

    (d) STATE CUSTODY.--Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code, is
    amended--

         (1) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

              "(b) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in
              behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the
              judgment of a State court shall not be granted
              unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted
              the remedies available in the courts of the State,
              or that there is either an absence of available
              State corrective process or the existence of
              circumstances rendering such process ineffective to
              protect the rights of the applicant.  An
              application may be denied on the merits
              notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to
              exhausted the remedies available in the courts of
              the States.";

         (2) by redesignating subsection (d), (e), and (f) as
         subsections (e), (f), and (g), respectively;

         (3) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new
         subsection:

              "(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in
              behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the
              judgment of a State court shall not be granted
              with respect to any claim that has been fully and
              fairly adjudicated in State proceedings."; and

         (4) by amending subsection (e), as redesignated by paragraph
         (2), to read as follows:

              "(e) In a proceeding instituted by an application
              for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody
              pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a full
              and fair determination of a factual issue made in
              the case by a State court shall be presumed to be
              correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of
              rebutting this presumption by clear and convincing
              evidence.".

    (e) FEDERAL CUSTODY.--Section 2255 of title 28, United States Code, is
    amended by striking the second paragraph and the penultimate paragraph
    thereof, and by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraphs:

         "When a person fails to raise a claim at the time or in the
         manner required by Federal rules of procedure, the claim
         shall not be entertained in a motion under this section
         unless actual prejudice resulted to the movant from the
         alleged denial of the right asserted and--

              "(1) the failure to raise the claim properly, or to
              have it heard, was the result of governmental
              action in violation of the Constitution or the laws
              of the United States;

              "(2) the right asserted was newly recognized by the
              Supreme Court subsequent to the procedural default
              and is retroactively applicable; or

              "(3) the factual predicate of the claim could not
              have been discovered through the exercise of
              reasonable diligence prior to the procedural
              default.

         "A two-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion
         under this section.  The limitation period shall run from the
         latest of the following times;

              "(1) The time at which the judgment of conviction
              becomes final.

              "(2) The time at which the impediment to making a
              motion created by governmental action in violation
              of the Constitution or laws of the United States is
              removed, where the movant was prevented from making
              a motion by such governmental action.

              "(3) The time at which the right asserted was
              initially recognized by the Supreme Court, where
              the right has been newly recognized by the Court
              and is retroactively applicable.

              "(4) The time at which the factual predicate of the
              claim or claims presented could have been
              discovered through the exercise of reasonable
              diligence.".

              conviction in a Federal court of a felony under
              this title, the court shall compile a list of all
              assets owned by the defendant not subject to
              forfeiture.

              "(B) After the release of a defendant described in
              subparagraph (A), upon request of the Attorney
              General, the court shall required the defendant to
              provide proof that any asset owned by the defendant
              not listed on the list described in subparagraph
              (A) was legally obtained.".

              "(C) In order to prove that a defendant legally
              obtained an asset not listed on the list described
              in subparagraph (A), the defendant shall be
              required to produce documentation of the same
              nature as that required of a taxpayer by the
              Internal Revenue Service.

              "(D) Assets that a defendant does not prove were
              legally obtained under subparagraph (B) may be
              seized by the Attorney General through attachment
              and foreclosure proceedings, and the proceeds of
              such proceedings shall be deposited in the
              Department of Justice's Assets Forfeiture Fund and
              shall be available for transfer to the building and
              facilities account of the Federal prison system.".

    SEC. 154. JURISDICTION OF SPECIAL MASTERS.

    Notwithstanding any other law, a special master appointed to serve in a
    United States court to monitor compliance with a court order, including

         (2) may be reappointed for terms of 1 year;

         (4) shall not have jurisdiction to enforce any judicial order
         with respect to the management of prisons or jails.

    (a) IN GENERAL.--Chapter 49 of title 28, United States Code, is amended
    by adding at the end thereof the following new section:

         "(a) The Administrative Office of the United States Courts
         shall annually publish a cumulative report on sentencing by
         United States District Judges.  The report shall be compiled
         for the purpose of enabling the reader to assess criminal
         sentencing patterns among Federal judges and post-sentencing
         treatment to determine judicial accuracy of forecasting
         future responsible and lawful behavior by those whom they
         sentence.

         "(b) The report shall--

              "(1) personally identify the judge that pronounced
              each criminal sentence;

              "(2) give a brief description of the crime or

               TITLE II--ACHIEVING A DRUG-FREE AMERICA BY 1995

    SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--

         (1) to make America drug-free by 1995 requires a concerted
         effort to hold drug users accountable for their actions,
         which sustain the drug trade and related criminal activities;
         and

         (2) the anti-drug policy of the 1990's must emphasize the
         principles of zero tolerance, user accountability, and
         measured user penalties.

    SEC. 202 PAYMENT OF TRIAL COSTS AND MANDATORY MINIMUM FINES.

    (a) FINE TO PAY COST OF TRIAL.--(1) A person who is convicted of a
         violation of section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (21

         the cost of the trial in which the person is convicted, as
         determined by the court, out of the income of such person.

         (2) If a person convicted of drug possession has insufficient
         income and property to pay the cost of trial as required by
         paragraph (1), the court shall determine an appropriate
         amount that should be paid in view of the person's income and
         the cost of trial.

         (3) The amount that a person shall be required to pay out of
         the person's income to pay the cost of trial shall not exceed
         25 percent of the person's annual income.

    (b) ADDITIONAL MANDATORY FINE.--In addition to the fines authorized in
    section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 844) and in
    subsection (a), a person who is convicted of section 404 of the
    Controlled Substances Act shall be assessed a mandatory fine of at
    least 10 percent of the person's income for a first offense and at
    least 25 percent of the person's income for a second or subsequent
    offense.

    (c) INCOME.--For the purposes of this section, a person's annual income
    shall be determined to be no less than the amount of income reported on
    the person's most recent Federal income tax filing.

    (d) FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY.--If a person convicted of a drug crime has
    insufficient income to pay the fines imposed under subsections (a) and

    be subject to forfeiture through attachment, foreclosure, and
    garnishment procedures.

    (e) The court may order payment of trial costs and fines imposed under
    this section in a single payment or in installments, as necessary to
    realize the greatest possibility that the entire amount of costs and
    fines will be paid.

              rehabilitation program which includes periodic,
              random drug testing after becoming ineligible

              revocation of drivers' licenses as provided in
              subsection (c) shall receive priority over a

              the Secretary that it has adopted and has
              implemented a program to prevent the use of illicit
              drugs and the abuse of alcohol by its students and
              employees that is consistent with the program
              required by subsection (a) of this section.  The
              State educational agency shall, upon request, make
              available to the Secretary and to the public full
              information about the elements of its program.

              "(d)(1) The Secretary shall publish regulations to
                   implement and enforce the provisions of
                   this section, including regulations that

                        State educational agencies of a
                        representative sample of
                        programs required by subsection
                        (a); and

                        "(B) sanctions, up to and
                        including the termination of
                        any form of financial
                        assistance, for local
                        educational agencies that fail
                        to implement their programs or
                        to consistently enforce their
                        sanctions.

                   "(2) The sanctions required by subsection
                   (a)(1) through (4) may included the
                   completion of an appropriate
                   rehabilitation program.".

         (2) The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986 is
         further amended in section 5126(c)(2) by--

              (A) striking subparagraphs (E), (F), and (G); and

              (B) redesignating subparagraphs (H) through (M) as
              subparagraphs (E) through (J), respectively.

    SEC. 207. DRUG-FREE TRANSPORTATION.

    (a) SHORT TITLE.--This section may be cited as the 'Transportation
    Employee Testing Act'.

    (b) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that--

         (1) alcohol abuse and illegal drug use pose significant
         dangers to the safety and welfare of the Nation;

         (2) millions of the Nation's citizens utilize transportation
         by aircraft, railroads, trucks, and buses, and depend on the
         operators of aircraft, railroads, trucks, and buses to
         perform in a safe and responsible manner;

         (3) the greatest efforts must be expended to eliminate the
         abuse of alcohol and the use of illegal drugs, whether on or
         off duty, by persons who are involved in the operation of
         aircraft, railroads, trucks, and buses;

         (4) the use of alcohol and illegal drugs has been
         demonstrated to affect significantly the performance of
         persons who use them, and has been proven to have been a
         critical factor in transportation accidents;

         (5) the testing of uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces
         has shown that the most effective deterrent to abuse of
         alcohol and use of illegal drugs is increased testing,
         including random testing;

         (6) adequate safeguards can be implemented to ensure that
         testing for abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs is
         performed in a manner that protects a person's right of
         privacy, ensures that no person is harassed by being treated
         differently from other persons, and ensures that no person's
         reputation or career development is unduly threatened or
         harmed; and

         (7) rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing
         program for abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs, and
         should be made available to persons, as appropriate.

    (C) AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ACT.--(1) Title VI of the Federal
         Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) is amended
         by adding at the end thereof the following:

                               "TESTING PROGRAM

              "SEC. 613. (a)(1) The Administrator shall, in the
              interest of aviation safety, prescribe regulations
              not later than 12 months after the date of
              enactment of this section.  Such regulations shall
              establish a program that requires air carriers and
              foreign air carriers to conduct preemployment,
              reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident
              testing of airmen, crewmembers, airport security
              screening contract personnel, and other air
              carrier employees responsible for safety-sensitive
              functions (as determined by the Administrator) for
              use, in violation of law, of alcohol or a
              controlled substances.  The Administrator may also
              prescribe regulations, as the Administrator
              considers appropriate in the interest of safety,
              for the conduct of periodic recurring testing of
              such employees for such use in violation of law.

              "(2) The Administrator shall establish a program
              applicable to employees of the Federal Aviation
              Administration whose duties include responsibility
              for safety-sensitive functions.  Such programs
              shall provide for preemployment, reasonable
              suspicion, random, an post-accident testing for
              use, in violation of law, of alcohol or a
              controlled substance.  The Administrator may also
              prescribe regulations, as the Administrator
              considers appropriate in the interest of safety,
              for the conduct of periodic testing of such
              employees for such use in violation of law.

              "(3) In prescribing regulations under the programs
              required by this subsection, the Administrator
              shall require, as the Administrator considers
              appropriate, the suspension or revocation of any
              certificate issued to such a person, or the
              disqualification or dismissal of any such person,
              in accordance with this section, in any instance
              where a test conduct and confirmed under this
              section indicates that such person has used, in
              violation of law, alcohol or a controlled
              substance.

                           "PROHIBITION OF SERVICE

              "(b)(1) No person may use, in violation of law,
              alcohol or a controlled substance after the date of

              safety-sensitive functions.

              "(2) No person who is determined to have used, in
              violation of law, alcohol or a controlled substance
              after the date of enactment of this section shall
              serve as an airman, crewmember, airport security
              screening contract personnel, air carrier employee
              responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as
              determined by the Administrator), or employee of
              the Federal Aviation Administration with
              responsibility for safety-sensitive functions
              unless such person has completed a program of
              rehabilitation described in subsection (c).

              "(3) Any such person determined by the
              Administrator to have used, in violation of law,
              alcohol or a controlled substance after the date of
              enactment of this section who--

                   "(A) engaged in such use while on duty;

                   "(B) prior to such use had undertaken or
                   completed a rehabilitation program
                   described in subsection (c) of this
                   section;

                   "(C) following such determination refuses
                   to undertake such rehabilitation program;

              relating to air transportation which such person
              performed prior to the date of such determination.

                         "PROGRAM FOR REHABILITATION

              "(c)(1) The Administrator shall prescribe
              regulations setting forth requirements for
              rehabilitation programs which at a minimum provide
              for the identification and opportunity for
              treatment of employees referred to in subsection
              (a)(1) in need of assistance in resolving problems
              with the use, in violation of law, of alcohol or
              controlled substances.  Each air carrier or foreign
              air carrier is encouraged to make such a program
              available to all of its employees in addition to
              those employees referred to in subsection (a)(1). 
              The Administrator shall determine the circumstances
              under which such employees shall be required to
              participate in such a program.  Nothing in this
              subsection shall preclude any air carrier or
              foreign air carrier from establishing a program
              under this subsection in cooperation with any other
              air carrier or foreign air carrier.

              "(2) The Administrator shall establish and maintain
              a rehabilitation program which at a minimum

              subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator
              shall development requirements which shall--

                   "(1) promote, to the maximum extent
                   practicable, individual privacy in the
                   collection of specimen samples;

                   "(2) with respect to laboratories and
                   testing procedures for controlled
                   substances, incorporate the Department of
                   Health and Human Services scientific and
                   technical guidelines dated April 11,

                        standards for all aspects of
                        laboratory controlled
                        substances testing and
                        laboratory procedures to be
                        applied in carrying out this
                        section, including standards
                        that require the use of the
                        best available technology for

                        of laboratories to perform
                        controlled substances testing
                        in carrying out this section;

                   "(3) require that all laboratories
                   involved in the controlled substances
                   testing of any person under this section
                   shall have the capability and facility,
                   at such laboratory, of performing
                   screening and confirmation tests;

                   "(4) provide that all tests that indicate
                   the use, in violation of law, of alcohol
                   or a controlled substance by any person
                   shall be confirmed by a scientifically
                   recognized method of testing capable of
                   providing quantitative data regarding
                   alcohol or a controlled substance;

                   "(5) provide that each specimen sample be
                   subdivided, secured, and labeled in the
                   presence of the tested person and that a
                   portion thereof be retained in a secure
                   manner to prevent the possibility of
                   tampering, so that if the person's
                   confirmation test results are positive
                   the person has an opportunity to have the
                   retained portion assayed by a
                   confirmation test done independently at a
                   second certified laboratory if the person
                   requests the independent test within 3
                   days after being advised of the results
                   of the confirmation test;

                   "(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for
                   testing to detect and quantify alcohol in
                   breath and body fluid samples, including
                   urine and blood, through the development
                   of regulations as may be necessary and in
                   consultation with the Department of
                   Health and Human Services;

                   "(7) provide for the confidentiality of
                   test results and medical information
                   (other than information relating to
                   alcohol or a controlled substance) of
                   employees, except that this paragraph
                   shall not preclude the use of test
                   results for the orderly imposition of
                   appropriate sanctions under this section;
                   and

                   "(8) ensure that employees are selected
                   for tests by nondiscriminatory and
                   impartial methods, so that no employee is
                   harassed by being treated differently
                   from other employees in similar
                   circumstances.

                    "EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS

              "(e)(1) No State or local government shall adopt or
              have in effect any law, rule, regulation,
              ordinance, standard, or order that is inconsistent
              with the regulations promulgated under this
              section, except that the regulations promulgated
              under this section shall not be construed to
              preempt provisions of State criminal law which
              impose sanctions for reckless conduct leading to
              actual loss of life, injury, or damage to property,
              whether the provisions apply specifically to
              employees of an air carrier or foreign air carrier
              or to the general public.

              "(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to
              restrict the discretion of the Administrator to
              continue in force, amend, or further supplement any
              regulations issued before the date of enactment of
              this section that govern the use of alcohol and
              controlled substances by airmen, crewmembers,
              airport security screening contract personnel, air
              carrier employees responsible for safety-sensitive
              functions (as determined by the Administrator), or
              employees of the Federal Aviation Administration
              with responsibility for safety-sensitive functions.

              "(3) In prescribing regulations under this section,
              the Administrator shall establish requirements
              applicable to foreign air carriers that are
              consistent with the international obligations of
              the United States, and the Administrator shall
              take into consideration any applicable laws and
              regulations of foreign countries.  The Secretary of
              State and the Secretary of Transportation, jointly,
              shall call on the member countries of the
              International Civil Aviation Organization to
              strengthen and enforce existing standards to
              prohibit the use, in violation of law, of alcohol
              or a controlled substance by crewmembers in
              international civil aviation.

              "(f) For the purposes of this section, the term
              "controlled substance" means any substance under

    (d) AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY ACT.--Section 202 of the
    Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431) is amended by
    adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:

         "(r)(1) In the interest of safety, the Secretary shall, not
         later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this
         subsection, issue rules, regulations, standards, and orders
         relating to alcohol and drug use in railroad operations. 
         Such regulations shall establish a program which--

              "(A) requires railroads to conduct preemployment,
              reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident
              testing of all railroad employees responsible for
              safety-sensitive functions (as determined by the
              Secretary) for use, in violation of law, of alcohol
              or a controlled substance;

              "(B) requires, as the Secretary considers
              appropriate, disqualification for an established
              period of time or dismissal of any employee
              determined to have used or to have been impaired by
              alcohol while on duty; and

              "(C) requires, as the Secretary considers
              appropriate, disqualification for an established
              period of time or dismissal of any employee
              determined to have used a controlled substance,
              whether on duty or not on duty, except as permitted
              for medical purposes by law and any rules,
              regulations, standards, or orders issued under this
              title.

         The Secretary may also issue rules, regulations, standards,
         and orders, as the Secretary considers appropriate in the
         interest of safety, requiring railroads to conduct periodic
         testing of railroad employees responsible for such safety
         sensitive functions, for use of alcohol or a controlled
         substance in violation of law.  Nothing in this subsection
         shall be construed to restrict the discretion of the
         Secretary to continue in force, amend, or further supplement
         any rules, regulations, standards, and orders governing the
         use of alcohol and controlled substances in railroad
         operations issued before the date of enactment of this
         subsection.

         "(2) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall
         develop requirements which shall--

              "(A) promote, to the maximum extent practicable,
              individual privacy in the collection of specimen
              samples;

              "(B) with respect to laboratories and testing
              procedures for controlled substances, incorporate

              scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11,
              1988, and any amendments thereto, including
              mandatory guidelines which--

                   "(i) establish comprehensive standards
                   for all aspects of laboratory controlled
                   substances testing and laboratory
                   procedures to be applied in carrying out
                   this subsection, including standards that
                   require the use of the best available
                   technology for ensuring the full
                   reliability and accuracy of controlled
                   substances tests and strict procedures
                   governing the chain of custody of
                   specimen samples collected for controlled
                   substances testing;

                   "(ii) establish the minimum list of
                   controlled substances for which persons
                   may be tested; and

                   "(iii) establish appropriate standards
                   and procedures for periodic review of
                   laboratories and criteria for
                   certification and revocation of
                   certification of laboratories to perform
                   controlled substances testing in carrying
                   out this subsection;

              "(C) require that all laboratories involved in the
              controlled substances testing of any employee under
              this subsection shall have the capability and
              facility, at such laboratory, of performing
              screening and confirmation tests;

              "(D) provide that all tests which indicate the use,
              in violation of law, of alcohol or a controlled
              substance by any employee shall be confirmed by a
              scientifically recognized method of testing capable
              of providing quantitative data regarding alcohol or
              a controlled substance;

              "(E) provide that each specimen sample be
              subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of
              the tested person and that a portion thereof be
              retained in a secure manner to prevent the
              possibility of tampering, so that in the event the
              person's confirmation test results are positive the
              person has an opportunity to have the retained
              portion assayed by a confirmation test done
              independently at a second certified laboratory if
              the person requests the independent test within 3
              days after being advised of the results of the
              confirmation test;

              "(F) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to
              detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body
              fluid samples, including urine and blood, through
              the development of regulations as may be necessary
              and in consultation with the Department of Health
              and Human Services;

              "(G) provides for the confidentiality of test
              results and medical information (other than
              information relating to alcohol or a controlled
              substance) of employees, except that the provisions
              of this subparagraph shall not preclude the use of
              test results for the orderly imposition of
              appropriate sanctions under this subsection; and

              "(H) ensure that employees are selected for tests
              by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that
              no employee is harassed by being treated
              differently from other employees in similar
              circumstances.

         "(3) The Secretary shall issue rules, regulations, standards,
         or orders setting forth requirements for rehabilitation
         programs which at a minimum provide for the identification
         and opportunity for treatment of railroad employees
         responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as determined by
         the Secretary) in need of assistance in resolving problems
         with the use, in violation of law, of alcohol or a controlled
         substance.  Each railroad is encouraged to make such a
         program available to all of its employees in addition to
         those employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions. 
         The Secretary shall determine the circumstances under which
         such employees shall be required to participate in such
         program.  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a railroad
         from establishing a program under this paragraph in
         cooperation with any other railroad.

         "(4) In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the
         Secretary shall establish requirements that are consistent
         with the international obligations of the United States, and
         the Secretary shall take into consideration any applicable
         laws and regulations of foreign countries.

         "(5) For the purposes of this subsection, the term
         'controlled substance' means any substance under section
         102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6))
         specified by the Secretary.".

              of enactment of this section.  Such regulations
              shall establish a program which requires motor
              carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable
              suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of the
              operators of commercial motor vehicles for use, in
              violation of law, of alcohol or a controlled
              substance.  The Secretary may also issue
              regulations, as the Secretary considers appropriate
              in the interest of safety, for the conduct of
              periodic testing of such operations for such use in
              violation of law.

              "(b) TESTING.--

                   "(1) POST-ACCIDENT TESTING.--In issuing
                   such regulations, the Secretary shall
                   require that post-accident testing of the
                   operator of a commercial motor vehicle be
                   conducted in the case of any accident
                   involving a commercial motor vehicle in

                   determined by the Secretary, other serious
                   accidents involving bodily injury or
                   significant property damage.

                   "(2) TESTING AS PART OF MEDICAL
                   EXAMINATION.--Nothing in subsection (a)
                   shall preclude the Secretary from
                   providing in such regulations that such
                   testing be conducted as part of the
                   medical examination required by subpart E
                   of part 391 of title 49, Code of Federal
                   Regulations, with respect to operators of
                   commercial motor vehicles to whom such
                   part is applicable.

              "(c) PROGRAM FOR REHABILITATION.--The Secretary
              shall issue regulations setting forth requirements
              for rehabilitation programs which provide for the
              identification and opportunity for treatment of
              operators of commercial motor vehicles who are
              determined to have used, in violation of law or
              Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled
              substance.  The Secretary shall determine the
              circumstances under which such operators shall be
              required to participate in such program.  Nothing
              in this subsection shall preclude a motor carrier
              from establishing a program under this subsection
              in cooperation with any other motor carrier.

              "(d) PROCEDURES FOR TESTING.--In establishing the
              program required under subsection (a) of this

                   secure manner to prevent the possibility
                   of tampering, so that in the event the
                   individual's confirmation test results
                   are positive the individual has an
                   opportunity to have the retained portion
                   assayed by a confirmation test done
                   independently at a second certified
                   laboratory if the individual requests the

                   alcohol or a controlled substance) of
                   employees, except that the provisions of
                   this paragraph shall not preclude the use
                   of test results for the orderly
                   imposition of appropriate sanctions under
                   this section; and

                   "(8) ensure that employees are selected
                   for tests by nondiscriminatory and
                   impartial methods, so that no employee is
                   harassed by being treated differently
                   from other employees in similar
                   circumstances.

              "(e) EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.--

                   "(1) STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND
                   REGULATIONS.--No State or local
                   government shall adopt or have in effect
                   any law, rule, regulation, ordinance,

                   with the regulations issued under this
                   section, except that the regulations
                   issued under this section shall not be
                   construed to preempt provisions of State
                   criminal law which impose sanctions for
                   reckless conduct leading to actual loss
                   of life, injury, or damage to property,
                   whether the provisions apply specifically
                   to commercial motor vehicle employees, or
                   to the general public.

                   "(2) OTHER REGULATIONS ISSUED BY
                   SECRETARY.--Nothing in this section shall

                   under this title or any other provision
                   of law..

                   "(2) DETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS.--The
                   Secretary shall determine appropriate
                   sanctions for commercial motor vehicle
                   operators who are determined, as a result
                   of tests conducted and confirmed under
                   this section, to have used, in violation
                   of law or Federal regulation, alcohol or
                   a controlled substance but are not under
                   the influence of alcohol or a controlled
                   substance as provide in this title.

         "(g) DEFINITION.--(1) For the purposes of this section, the

         "SEC. 26. (a) REGULATIONS.--The Secretary shall, in the
         interest of mass transportation safety, issue regulations
         within 12 months after the date of enactment of this section. 
         Such regulations shall establish a program which requires
         each recipient of assistance under this Act to conduct
         preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and postaccident
         testing of the operators of mass transportation vehicles for
         use, in violation of law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or
         a controlled substance.  The Secretary may also issue
         regulations, as the Secretary considers appropriate in the
         interest of safety, for the conduct of periodic recurring
         testing of such operators for such use in violation of law or
         Federal regulation.

         "(b) POSTACCIDENT TESTING.--In issuing such regulations, the
         Secretary shall require that postaccident testing of the
         operator of a mass transportation vehicle be conducted in the
         case of any accident involving a mass transportation vehicle
         in which occurs loss of human life, or, as determined by the

         significant property damage.

         "(c) PROGRAM FOR REHABILITATION.--The Secretary shall issue
         regulations setting forth requirements for rehabilitation

         for treatment of operators of mass transportation vehicles
         who are determined to have used, in violation of law or
         Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance.  The
         Secretary shall determine the circumstances under which such
         operators shall be required to participate in such a program. 
         Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a recipient from
         establishing a program under this subsection in cooperation
         with any other recipient.

         "(d) PROCEDURES FOR TESTING.--In establishing the program
         required under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary
         shall develop requirements which shall--

              "(1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable,
              individual privacy in the collection of specimen
              samples;

              1988, and any subsequent amendments thereto,
              including mandatory guidelines which--

                   "(A) establish comprehensive standards
                   for all aspects of laboratory controlled
                   substances testing and laboratory
                   procedures to be applied in carrying out
                   this section, including standards which
                   require the use of the best available
                   technology for ensuring the full
                   reliability and accuracy of controlled
                   substances tests and strict procedures
                   governing the chain of custody of
                   specimen samples collected for controlled
                   substances testing;

                   "(B) establish the minimum list of
                   controlled substances for which
                   individuals may be tested; and

                   "(C) establish appropriate standards and
                   procedures for periodic review of
                   laboratories and criteria for
                   certification and revocation of
                   certification of laboratories to perform
                   controlled substances testing in carrying
                   out this section;

              "(3) require that all laboratories involved in the
              testing of any individual under this section shall
              have the capability and facility, at such
              laboratory, of performing screening and
              confirmation tests;

              "(4) provide that all tests which indicate the use,
              in violation of law or Federal regulation, of
              alcohol or a controlled substance by any individual
              shall be confirmed by a scientifically recognized
              method of testing capable of providing quantitative
              data regarding alcohol or a controlled substance;

              "(5) provide that each specimen sample be
              subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of
              the tested individual and that a portion thereof be
              retained in a secure manner to prevent the
              possibility of tampering, so that in the event the
              individual's confirmation test results are positive
              the individual has an opportunity to have the
              retained portion assayed by a confirmation test
              done independently at a second certified laboratory
              if the individual requests the independent test
              within 3 days after being advised of the results of
              the confirmation test;

              "(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to
              detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body
              fluid samples, including urine and blood, through
              the development of regulations as may be necessary
              and in consultation with the Department of Health
              and Human Services;

              "(7) provide for the confidentiality of test
              results and medical information (other than
              information relating to alcohol or a controlled
              substance) of employees, except that the provisions
              of this paragraph shall not preclude the use of
              test results for the orderly imposition of
              appropriate sanctions under this section; and

              "(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests
              by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that
              no employee is harassed by being treated
              differently from other employees in similar
              circumstances.

         "(e) EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.--

              "(1) STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND REGULATIONS.--No State
              or local government shall adopt or have in effect
              any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, standard, or
              order that is inconsistent with the regulations
              issued under this section, except that the

              supplement any regulations governing the use of
              alcohol or controlled substances by mass
              transportation employees issued before the date of
              enactment of this section.

              "(3) INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.--In issuing

              only establish requirements that are consistent
              with the international obligations of the United
              States, and the Secretary shall take into

              "(2) DETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS.--The Secretary
              shall determine appropriate sanctions for mass
              transportation vehicle operators who are
              determined, as a result of tests conducted and
              confirmed under this section, to have used, in
              violation of law or Federal regulation, alcohol or
              a controlled substance but are not under the
              influence of alcohol or a controlled substance as

            Gosh, Bloody, What Can *I* Do About All Of This Shit?


   Regardless of my opinion of the political system of this country, I will
say this much...  The politicians will listen to you, *IF* you speak up.
They will ignore anything they don't like, if they can, but if their voters,
and thus the people responsible for their mega-salary-cushy-jobs, begin to
voice their opinions, they WILL listen.

   It doesn't matter whether you are currently a registered voter, or even
old enough to vote at all.  They don't know this, and won't know it if you
can handle yourself with maturity and intelligence.

   Besides that, if they do a good job, you just may start voting for them,
or vote for them when you are able to, and it is very good publicity for
them.

   So, whether you're pissed off about the drug laws, the terrorism that
they call Operation Sun Devil, or any of the other issues we have told you
about, or even those we HAVEN'T told you about, write your congressmen, your
representatives, hell, even write that Bush guy.  Write your local papers,
the national papers, the major magazines.  Tell your friends, your enemies,
your relatives, and everyone else you can find about what's going on.

      Communication and Education are the first steps toward Reformation
