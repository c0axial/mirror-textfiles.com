 There are thousands. And you know them. Those brace-faced geeks that usually
wear pocket protectors and sit around all day exchanging boogers with one
another. And there are those normal people, those who usually get the clear
sapphire braces so they won't look so fucked up and geeky.
 
 Well I used to be there myself. No not a geek loser schmuck wasteoid lonely
bater, but my teeth were pretty fucked up. I was told I should get them to
correct a crossbite I had and to make room for other teeth.
 
 My orthodontist was a nice man, although I often wondered if he really knew
what the hell he was doing. It was his assistants however, that made my
orthodontic experience a living hell.
 
 They usually came to work all wakked out on PCP, threatening people and
hallucinating demons and such, ya know, the typical American thing. The
main orthodontist himself was fairly clean cut. But when he disappeared into
his office for consultation, hell broke alive.
 
 It basically started the first visit when I went to get my bands and brackets
and shit put on. Everything was normal, everything was friendly. The doctor
came in and placed the brackets in the cement and left. The assistant pulled
out a blue light that was to quickly dry the cement on my teeth. The light
instead bent towards my eyes and the whole room became fluorescent blue,
changing quickly to a violent scarlet red.
 
 Another assistant came into the room and pulled a demon from her nose and
threw it at me. I was truly scared shitless. I shit in my pants and the
first assistant removed them and ate the shit. In fact all the assistants in
the building came and dined on the succulent shit. Their hair turned fiery
colors and they began beating each other with the hygienic latex gloves.
 
 I tried to run but some force, perhaps a spirit, held me fast to my chair
as these demonic orthodontic assistants paraded around my chair, eating
shit, chanting, and beating each other with latex gloves.
 
 It was nightmarish. A previously damned good looking assistant (now with
green leathery reptilic skin) lifted my long shirt from up over my thighs
and bent onto the floor. I tried to get away. I was held to the chair. She
placed her snake-like lips over my hardening cock (hmm I usually don't get
too fuckin horny looking at snakes and lizards... oh well...) and began
violently sucking it. Hmm felt pretty damned good but I didn't like the
idea of a fuckin lizard giving me head. But oh well you can't have everything
in life.
 
 She sucked and licked all the while, the other demonic fiends yet parading
around the chair. She ran her mouth up and down, up and down my rod, forked
tongue slithering all around my head. Hmm. The colour of the room began to
subside back to a semi-recognizable white light. Faster and faster she
went as her skin began to decompose back to her regular silky white flesh.
Even faster. I felt myself getting harder and hornier with every move she made.
The other assistants began to disappear. It seemed as though their spirits were
floating away from the room. I became lightheaded in the confusion and came
so hard I felt my ears pop. Oh it was the ultimate orgasm anyone could have!
I looked up, smiling with joy, only to see the assistant standing over me,
looking at me as if I were some kind of drug-addicted freak. Heh heh and
SHE should be the one thinking that. I looked down at my Levi's only to find
them up zipped snapped. What the hell? I noticed I had a very big bulge in
my pants. The assistant smiled and said you have a nice day! She sprayed
some kind of shit in my face and I slipped into unconsciousness. Next thing
I knew I was sitting in the car on the way home. Hmm I couldn't remember
that visit too well, nothing out of the ordinary.
 
 Ah ha, but if I was brainwashed of the demonic events, then how do I remember
them now? It was strange... the thoughts puzzled me for days, I simply could
not remember anything about that visit. I thought it might have been a case
of "missing time" so I went to see a well-reknowned hypnotist. We talked for
awhile about the situation and our beliefs in the paranormal. He put me into a
hypnotic trance and I began to recount the events. I remember my spirit sensed
a certain..ah.."arousal" in the hypnotist, and under my hypnotic trance he
removed my Levi's. He pulled them all the way off and pulled out my hard rod.
He sucked and caressed it, and as the cum flowed he sucked harder, harder,
the events presented themselves clearly, frightening. I was pulled from the
terrorizing thoughts back to consciousness only to find the hypnotist to be
sitting there, calm. I looked at my jeans. Up zipped snapped. Weird shit.
Bulge in the pants. The guy smiled. Wait a sec damnit, that's not the
hypnotist! The dude had transformed into my orthodontist! He smiled and
laughed maliciously and growled a terrorific PCP-driven growl. He picked
up a copy of Anal Poetry For Beginners and began reciting to me the horrible
verses.
 
"If you have a stiffy
 Wedged between your anal heart,
 And if it's causing utter pain
 Then blow it with a fart.
 
 Pick up a piece of plumbing pipe
 And wedge it in your hole,
 Get a pathway to your ass
 And then drop in a mole!
 
 Let it run around inside
 And take it when you're done,
 Fuck the mole with your butt cheeks
 Beastality's lots of fun!"
