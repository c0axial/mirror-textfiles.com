   Little Freddy had always been notorious for stirring up shit on the
local boards. He had been threatened numerous times by many users, Little
Freddy just laughed and laughed. One time one of the users showed up at
Freddy's front door. Freddy became son scared he pissed in his pants and
ran to his mommy, who in turn stepped to the door and told the user not
to ever be bothering her pansy defenseless son again. It got to the
point where Little Freddy was kicked off all the local boards. He was
so bored now he didn't know what to do. This began Freddy's change of
tune, which led to his worst of nightmares.
   Little Freddy was about 13 years old. He was in middle school and
was exceptionally stupid and insecure. Everyone picked on him because
he tried his damnest to bug the shit out of everyone. One of the other
local users, about his age, also went to Freddy's middle school. This
other user had already thrown Freddy into the showers and dunked his
head in the bowl in the boy's locker room, and was about to do the
same again. Freddy's life was one of solitude, the few friends he had
were geeks even scrawnier than he.
   As Freddy sat at home one night, he realized the severity of his
boredom. Ideas began brewing in his head. Late that night, past his
usual bedtime of 8:00, Freddy decided that if the local users wouldn't
have him, maybe out-of-state users would. Freddy was too damned dumb
to write a code hacker, so he had leeched one from the local 60 meg
AE about a month ago. At about that time his file transfer priveledges
were stripped from his account. The program was a multi-port multi-carrier
hacker that Phukt Sector had written called "Phuk-a-Code". Freddy did
not understand what the fuck this meant, he just knew it must be good
since it did so many things that he just didn't understand. He ran
Phuk-a-code, set some parameters, let it fly then shut off his screen.
He sat on his bed for awhile then his mother came in. She kissed him
on the cheek, which turned him on, and told him to hurry up and go
to bed. She left and shut his door. After he heard his parent's
bedroom door shut he lifted up his mattress and pulled out a wrinkled
photo he had gotten from one of his geek friends. The photo had been
pulled from an outdated issue of Penthouse magazine; it was of a
scraggly-looking whore laying spread-eagled on the bed. Although
little Freddy didn't fully understand the picture (mind you he was a
dumbass fuckup), he would still sit and gaze at it for several minutes
at a time. He would then whip his half-hard tiny dick out of his
pajamas and begin fondling it. He would continue to gaze at the picture.
He would then clench his dick in his hand and begin jacking off, still
gazing into the uncomprehended picture. He got no feeling from it,
yet he continued to whack off. He whacked and whacked until he tired
himself out, clicked off the light, then went to sleep.
   He woke up the next morning and clicked on his computer screen.
No codes had been recorded. He had heard some of knowledgable hackers
of the local area talking about how tightly the phone companies were
watching out for phreakers and hackers. He did have a small speck of
intelligence as he turned off the computer before going to school;
he knew it would be dumb to leave it hacking through the day. He
went off to school as usual, his dick aching from last night.
   All through the day little Freddy thought about going home and
hacking out codes. Finally 3 o'clock came, and he hopped on the
school bus. When the bus driver stopped in front of his house he
was out the door before it had hardly opened. He rushed inside and
clicked on his computer, eagerly loading Phuk-a-Code. He input the
parameters to continue hacking from where he had stopped last night,
and Phuk-a-code set to work. He ran downstairs to get some milk and
cookies and rushed back upstairs to start on his homework.
   He had just finished his math and was about to start on science
when his computer produced a few short beeping sounds. Overjoyed,
Little Freddy dashed over and slammed on the monitor switch. Sure
enough, there was a valid code sitting on the screen. Freddy hurriedly
copied it down and broke out of Phuk-a-code. He stuck in ASCII Express
and went to dial mode. AE dialed the 950 port and the code, and Freddy
heard the pause in the tone. He was getting too excited. AE paused
and then dialed the number to an 80 meg board he knew of in Arizona.
(Arizona? Oh well, many places are barren so will make for a nice place
to set up a mock board...) Yeah, it was, er, Cattle Molestors Anonymous,
yeah, that's what it was. He soon saw "Connect 1200" and he just about
fell out of his chair. Gee, we must give him some credit, he's a fucked
up loser schmuck fartsniffer, surely we can't go so far as to give him
300 baud, can we? Oh well. He entered "NEW" at the prompt and proceeded
to fill out a new-user application. He got into the system and sat there
stunned for a few minutes.

NO CARRIER
 
   Need I explain WHY all the users hated Freddy? Out of the long list
of NO'S that Freddy went by, the obvious thing he did wrong was post
about using a sprint port, leaving his fuckin VOICE NUMBER all over,
and posting just the lame shit. He was satisfied with himself for some
unearthly reason, and he resumed his wonderful science homework. Later
on that night he placed calls to other long distance systems around the
country.
   Little Freddy called just about every damned board in the country
using the same damned port and code. He posted his voice number quite
often and just did stupid giveaway shit.
   However he did not get caught, and he continued in his habits for
approximately two months. He leeched wares left and right. The sysops
of some of the boards were beginning to get sick of his shit and were
blacklisting him. Until it got so out of hand that the sysop of a
relatively "clean" (minus a few ELITE sections) system reported Freddy
to the Gestapo. The Gestapo watched Freddy's line for a while, and
caught him red handed a number of times.
   One afternoon little Freddy came home from school and jumped onto
a board located in Boise, Idaho. He was on for a few minutes and
someone rang the doorbell. He quickly logged off the system and rushed
downstairs. He hoped to see his geeky little friend Bob. What he
saw instead was the figure of a burly man standing in his doorway. He
looked aside and saw behind the man several other men, holding
briefcases and various equipment. His mother greeted them warmly
(and goofily) and invited them in. Freddy stood in the kitchen, out of
sight, listening intently. The men began explaining to Freddy's mother
that Freddy had been using other people's Sprint accounts to illegally
place long distance telephone calls. Freddy's mother was appalled and
immdeiately took Freddy's defense. But the first man whipped several
computer printouts from his briefcase, showing detailed records of
Freddy's activities on their phone network. The mother's face dropped,
and she began bawling. How could her precious little pure son do
something so awful? She ran into another room to grab some Kleenex.
As she looked up she saw Freddy standing solemnly in the doorway. She
lunged at him and picked him up by his belt and threw him across the
dining room table. "How in the hell could you DO something like
this Frederick Allen Smith? How dare you!" His mother was ravaging across
the dining room after Freddy. The four Gestapo representatives came
into the dining room. They tried to stop Mrs. Smith from beating her
son but it was too late; she was already placing humongous dents in
the sheet-rock walls with her son's head. The Gestapo men pulled the
mother away. She said to them, between her deep gasps for air, "Give
us a day or two to knock some sense into him and figure out what's
happening here." The men left the house and Freddy was sent to his
room.
   The next day his mother left for the grocery store. Having been
busted already, Little Freddy figured he could get away with calling
the boards again with the code; surely they had stopped monitoring
his line. But just as soon as he dialed the code, there were hard
knocks on his door. He rapidly shut off the computer. The knocks
became louder. They combined with the increasing thumping in his
ears. He tried to hide. They would go away. No. After several
minutes the punding continued, increasing in force with each stroke
on the door. Freddy finally dashed at the front door and swung it
open and cried, "What do you WANT? Stop that BEATING SHIT!" There
stood on his front porch two of the Gestapo men. They enetered the
house without saying a word. They shut the door behind them. "Hey!
You can't come in here like that!" squeaked Freddy. Still the
men said nothing. The first man grabbed Freddy and picked him up.
The men then carried Freddy upstairs to his bedroom. They threw him
down on the bed and shut and locked his doors. They stripped him
naked and began fondling him. One of the Gestapo men shoved two
large fingers deep into Freddy's tiny intestinal tract. Freddy
screamed loudly so the the other man gagged him. The men began
rubbing Freddy's ass. One man grabbed Freddy's dick and began
whacking him off. Freddy wiggled and tried his hardest to get away,
but the other Gestapo man held him down. The man took his hand
away from Freddy's dick and shoved his two middle fingers up
Freddy's asshole. He began sucking Freddy's dick. He sucked for
a long long while, then the other man began to suck. Still Freddy
could not come. Unsatisfied, the Gestapo men left Freddy's house.
Freddy sat on his bed, crying. Why did he have to be punished this
way for his phone crimes? Were all people molested for their crimes?
He looked out his bedroom window and continued to cry. He saw the men
leave through the back door and begin fooling in the bushes. He ran
to the phone to dial the police. He was shaking badly and his
crying fits wouldn't subside. He picked up the phone. He dialed a
nine. He heard a hissing noise outside his window. He dialed a one.
The hissing became louder and he turned around. He turned back around
to dial another one. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! A bright light flashed into
Freddy's eyes and a strong force blew his naked body across his room
and into the wall. In this last brief moment he realized the Gestapo
men had planted a bomb in the bushes below his window. It was not
the explosion however that killed him, but it was the large chunk of
sharp glass that flew at him with such great speed, drove through his
eyes, sliced cleanly through his brain and stuck into the wall.
