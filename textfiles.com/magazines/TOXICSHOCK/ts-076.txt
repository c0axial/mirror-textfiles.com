   I'm not particularly into writing up lyrics as a hobby, but I like this
tape so damn much I just had to...  You better fucking get this tape, it is
the best tape of 1990 so far.
   The lyrics here are not the same as the ones they printed.  I tried to
get everything he (Glen Danzig..The SINGER..SONGWRITER...The MAIN GUY!!!)
sang down in this, but in some of the songs it's kinda hard...I can't really
do his screams (it'd look funny), and, well, "her black wings", for
instance, has him singing some things and his group singing others, and I
just kinda fucked with it a bit and made it somewhat close to what was going
on...
   Glen Danzig, for you uncultured schmucks who don't know, was responsible
for Samhain and The Misfits, but I can tell you, Lucifuge is better than
anything he's ever done before...  (Including the first Danzig tape)
 
   Get the tape.  (or the CD...or the album...or the 8 track..huh?)

                darker than night

                harder than life
                in my arms
                see she here
                entwined with love
                unclean she is
 
                and she comes down to me
                and she offers me sleep
                under her black wings
                under her black wings
                under her black
 
                see she comes
                on the eve of dusk
                in another form
                with a scent of rain upon her neck
                she brings the lust
                supernatural
                ceasing never
                on and
                on and
                on
                her stride is such
                mortals freeze
                when she walks past
 
                and she comes down to me, yeah
                and she offers me sleep
                under her black wings
