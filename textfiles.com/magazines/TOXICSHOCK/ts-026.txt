Loose as a goose
Tight as a moneyroll.
She bates herself
With a jellyroll.
 
Smooth rounded testes
In cool baggy sacs.
With long hard strokes
Little Joey whacks.
 
Oh how they go
Each without mate.
Enjoying themselves
Oh how they 'bate.
 
Bate in the north
Bate in the south.
Have a strong orgasm
Cum in my mouth.
 
Bate with each other
Be a good sport.
Oops now you're pregnant
Time to abort.
 
Discard the fetus
Throw it away.
Oh gross sick shit
The father was gay.
 
The fetus returns
To seek its revenge.
Pull out a blowtorch
Makes pussy hair singe.
 
Climb up inside
Mutilate, tear.
Mangled the uterus
Keep the ovaries to wear.
 
Look at ole daddy
Bating with glee.
Not noticing the fetus
He shall soon see.
 
Grab hold the father
Rip off his dick.
He shouldn't have bated
The damned little prick.
