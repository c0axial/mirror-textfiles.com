 How oh how does a Fetus keep himself clean, while moping around in a bitch's
womb? Once the Mighty Fetus miscarriages it and breathes into it life of
destruction, how does it cleanse its underdeveloped body?
 
 Tonya was a decent looking loose slut and on this Fetal Night as any other
she was fucking her boyfriend Cal. Cal was ramming all ten inches of cock
in and out of Tonya's loose cavernous twat. Tonya had her powerful orgasm
and clench her eyes shut and screamed. As she finished her orgasm, she noticed
Cal had suddenly stiffened and she thought he must be conked out from their
fuck. She opened her eyes and screamed in horror. Cal lay dead, his now-dead
and stiff dick still wedged in her. She pulled herself away from him before
she closed up and locked on him. A bloddy disgusting fetus was hopping around
on Cal's back. There was a nice big gaping hole in Cal's back, from which
the fetus had removed a handful of intestines. "La la la la" the fetus uttered
as it bathed the gore off of itself with the intestines. He took a big bite,
and slurped in all the gastric juices and chewed them for awhile. He looked
up and saw a naked screaming Tonya. The fetus spat the gook and acid and
Tonya's face, and it sizzled away at her flesh and consumed it. Tonya slumped
to the floor, dead. The fetus ripped a gaping hole in her stomach and jumped
in. He used her digestive system as a bathing hole, pulling the digested
slop of food from her stomach and pouring it all over itself.
 
 But that is not all.
 
 Another of Fetus the Mighty's servant miscarriages traveled to the local
place of shopping, and located the most noticable place in the whole mall.
The center sitting area. Oh LOOK! There's SANTA CLAUS, in his little house
talking to all the litte kiddies. The fetus jumped on the stage and squirmed
across it. The people of the mall shrieked in terror of the unsightly little
lump. The fetus scrambled to its knees and puked acidic bile all over Santa's
"workshop", disintegrating it, Santa, and the kiddies within. Parents scurried
in all directions, afraid for their children. Fetus stood in the center of
the now empty stage, cackling hysterically through its undeveloped larynx.
It grabbed its undeveloped penis and stretched it outward from its body.
Excreting a urine-like waste from the penis, the fetus washed itself clean of
the bile and sawdust (it had covered it when it vaporized the workshop). It
then began masturbating and it shot a deadly acidic semen all over the crowd
of the onlooking shoppers. It then disppeared.
 
 That's only two ways that fetuses clean themselves. Many take baths as normal
humans do.
 
 Mary was bloody. Yes Mary was a Bloody Mary. She had had a miscarriage in
the bowl and flushed it down. She stood up and went to the sink to puke her
guts up. She was saddened and sickened, and collapsed in the floor in her
sorrow. She ran a tub full of lukewarm water and sat in the tub crying. She
sluggishly bathed herself, and turned to pick up a fresh bar of soap. She
turned back around and heard a gurgling in the commode. The miscarried
fetus climbed out and onto the rim with a slurping sucking noise. Mary cowered
to the wall, screaming her lungs out, puking some more white chunky substance
out onto the floor. The fetus leaped from the rim and landed with a splat in
the puke. He wallowed in it and drank some of it, eating the chunks. Mary
shrieked and went completely out of it. The fetus jumped in the tub and bathed
himself in the milky water. Mary continued to scream and tried to jump from
the tub. But no sooner did the fetus jump into Mary's vagina and crawl up into
her uterus. He bathed himself in the soft tissues surrounding the uteral walls.
He shoved both of his undeveloped arms deep into the Fallopian tubes and
with a mighty shove pushed its head through the top of the uterus, ripping it
clean. He climbed upward through Mary's diaphragm and around her stomach. He
pushed upward between her lungs and grasped her heart. He nibbled away at the
heart until finally he felt himself slam into Mary's ribcage as she fell dead
onto the floor. The fetus climbed back down on its venture back to Mary's
vaginal tract. The fetus climbed out and slid out the vagina. It slapped Mary's
clittoris on the way out. As the fetus slid across the floor it bounced up
into the tub and splashed down into the water. Shaking the soap tray, the soap
fell into the tub. The fetus noticed the word "Ivory" as the soap surfaced and
wandered down the tub. "It really floats!"
 
 Fetuses love to take baths in bodily excretions. Feces, urine, puke, bile,
saliva, brain tissue, uteral discharge, you name it, they love it. Many
fetuses love to bathe in their acidic cum, or they'll slide into a used
condom and wallow away to their satisfaction.
 
 If you see a lump of wriggling bloody mass, and it's wallowing around in
something that seems utterly disgusting to you, it's probably just another
miscarriage or abortion taking a well-deserved bath.
