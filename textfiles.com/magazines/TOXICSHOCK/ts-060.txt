Alrighty, there once was a time in the eons of histories past, in a very
parallel universe, when natural disasters occurred almost as frequently as
jet black niggers having sex. So call me prejudiced. No, just have a very
unliked sense of humor. Anyway, the disasters occurred in great numbers so
each one was taken with indifference to the inhabitants of this alternate life.
But there was one disaster that could not go unnoticed and unfeared, the
dreaded:
 
                                   BIRTHQUAKE!

The beings of the alternate reality of existence sat around, completely
unphased by the floods, tornados, hurricanes, volcanos, and 727's crashlanding
in their backyards. It was background noise. They were a race of metaphysically
aware people and sat around all day engrossed in listening to Enya tapes.
 
However, there was one event, as noted, that would capture their attention and
scare the living fuck out of them - the Birthquake. Yes females and males alike
ran in fear, hid in horror, of the Birthquake. Their Entity brought it upon
them for both punishment and His pleasure. Fetus Almighty reigned supreme. In
all that Is and none that Has Been, Fetus took the reins and drove everything
to his liking and grossed entertainment.
 
Becky sat in her living room listening to Watermark and cross-stitching. She
felt a slight punching in her uterus; the baby was active today. She was so
happy that her and her husband Don finally were able to start a family. She
rubbed her tummy and called Don into the room. He felt her bulging stomach
and bent down to listen in on the little one. They both smiled. He kissed her
on the cheek and told her he loved her. Becky resumed her cross-stitching and
lost herself completely in "Storms in Africa". It inspired her to stitch a
complicated landscape, with a creekbank, a tree, and a beautiful sunrise.
 
It blackened outside, the wind began stirring.
 "Don, honey, you ought to go roll the windows up on my car."
 "Alright dear."
Becky lost herself again stitching. "Exile" was now playing.
Thunder rumbled in the distance. To no avail, probably another severe
thunderstorm brewing up. Another black drug dealer was off somewhere banging
a corner whore probably.
 "Don, what's taking you so long?"
 "Becky, the sky looks funny. The clouds are pretty dark but they've got a
  reddish haze. You better come take a look."
Becky hoisted herself out of her chair and reluctantly turned off the Enya
tape. She walked to the back door with her husband.
 "Don, isn't that sweet. The baby just kicked aga..." THRRWWWWOOOOOOOM!!
The baby planted a hell of a kick into the walls of Becky's womb and stirred
around a bit. The clouds drew near, and the thunder rang out loudly. Don
noticed something odd. The storm was so near, yet there was no rain. And that
odd red haze in the clouds. Oh well. The two returned to the comfort of the
indoors.
 SLLLAAAAAAAMMMMMRRRRRMBBLEBBBRR...... the baby kicked harder and squirmed
more. Becky had a strong contraction.
 "Oooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!" She grabbed hold of a nearby chair and slammed
herself down in it.
 "Honey are you okay? A contraction?" asked Don, like a complete fool.
Becky grabbed his shirt and pulled him down to the floor and gave him a look
of utter disgust. She screamed again. Don ran into their bedroom and grabbed
the packed suitcase. He tried to pull her out of the chair and out the door
to the car but Becky seemed to be unwilling. Another contraction. How could
this be happening?
 "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhhhhhh SHIT! DON!" Becky slumped out of
the chair and onto the floor in her zenith of pain. Don was now frightened,
and a clap of thunder seemed to shake the whole house. Don noticed something
very important, the dishes in the china cabinet were still shaking. The clap
of thunder was over, yet everything slughtly rumbled. Great a storm and NOW
an earthquake.
 "Oh just great! A violent storm, my wife's in labor, and an EARTHQUAKE TOO!"
 "NOOOO!" boomed a very loud and meaningfully pissed voice throughout the
house, and rang Don's skull. Of all the frequently occurring disasters that
passed with no mind, Don was now scared shitless.
 Becky's legs were thrown backward and aside. Her panties disintegrated and
she spun around by some unseen force and her bare twat was visible to Don.
 Don looked but wasn't aroused, he was too engrossed in his fear. He saw
her lips spreading wider, wider, by some force they spread at least a foot
apart and the clit swelled. The lips and clit began vibrating with great
force. "Oh shit," he thought, "the baby's coming! The baby's COMING!"
 The bodiless voice rang out again, "Oh you BET IT IS!"
 Becky's hole was at least two feet wide now, and she was almost unconscious
from the pain and terror. Up her hoel Don could see a cloud of red haze.
Hey wait, it looked like the ones outside. The whole house shook violently
now, and Becky's clit vibrated with utter force. Don wet his pants.
 
And with large vibrations of body, earth, and etheric world power, the fetus
shot forth from Becky's cavernous twat with immense force, quaking like
an overpowered vibrator, and afterbirth was strewn about the room, destroying
the newly upholstered furniture. The walls were crumbling, and Becky fainted.
The fetus was hurled across the room and hit Don smack in the face, who
shrieked in horror and cried out for his life. The house was shaking violently
and the storm thundered overhead incessantly. Don looked out from his
tear distorted orbs and saw the fetus looking at him. And in that instant
the fetus spoke.
 "Hello daddy! Wanna PLAY???"
 
Don shrieked, but it was cut short as the fetus bit a plug from Don's scalp
and took a bit of skull. It walked over and grabbed firmly onto the suitcase.
 
 "Going somewhere?"
 
The fetus swung it backwards and then brought it over, cracking Don's skull
with its rapid movement and weight. The fetus jumped onto Don's body, which
was squirming its way to the phone. The fetus pounced up and down, with each
landing its feet plowed their way into Don's abdomen, sending blood and bits
of gut in many directions. The tiny undeveloped child bathed its body in
this goo. And with each landing the child chanted:
 
 "Dad..dy..does..n't..love..me..an..y..MORE!!!"
 "Fuck..you..dad..dy..eat..raw..waste..and..like..it!!!"
And with that the fetus shot liquid excrement from its anal orifice onto Don's
face and placed a foot into Don's mouth.
 
Don was on his last strand of strength, wallowing in agony and sheer pain.
He attempted to lift his hand off the floor and grab the phone but was
unsuccessful.
 
The fetus took a hand and slapped Don across the face, slicing it wide open.
 
"NO!"
 
It yanked the phone cord from the wall and tied Don's ankles to his front
teeth. It had to break a few bones here and there to meet this contortion,
but the changes were made to Don's now dead figure.
 
The cloud of red placental haze emerged itself from Becky's cunt and floated
about the room.
 
And on Its command, Becky's insides were sucked out through her pussy and
strewn about the room. Her flesh crumpled into a pile the size of a
basketball.
 
In the instant that Becky's and Don's house and yard imploded into the
Placental Cloud, the storm dispersed and the quaking stopped.
 
And Fetus laughed. His laughed could be heard throughout all known dimensions.
 
Another Birthquake had successfully come and gone.
