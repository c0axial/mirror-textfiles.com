 Truly the Eighties was a good decade. So much happened. Violence, greed,
egotist corporate bastards. Fetus looked back at The Past with a Coke and
a great big Smile. He first looked at the onbringing of the Hard Rock and
Thrash Metal wave. Aah, music to corrupt little souls. Fast food. Fat and
grease to poison and control minds. Sex. A perfect scheme to gain Fetal
Followers and servant abortions. Abortion. A controversy. Should it be?
Is it moral? Kill them all and carry out a job. Rallies. Ha! Pure pigs
fighting a lost cause. And assholes like this are bitching over Snow
White and her Seven Dwarf embryos? Pfft.
 Fetus the Destroyer looked ahead a bit. Spacce program. The Challenger.
A truly saddening venture. Fetus sat upon his mighty undeveloped ass
and moved his hands around a bit. "BOOM! Whissshhhh...SPLASH! HAHAHAHAHA!"
 Students got shot. Brutally slaughtered. Fetus laughed. "Whoa little
pricks can't dodge a simple bullet?"
 Increase in terrorism. Fetal Muslims capturing everyone. Americans. "Aw
gee, they can't stand a little Bondage and torture?" Airport bombings.
Have a nice day, fly Delta, and watch out for bombs!
 An awful relieving of tension between Soviets and Americans. How could
a Fetal Plan that big...FAIL? The Soviets were to nuke the Americans, but
Flipper the Fetus fucked up big time and fell asleep before the Iceland
Summit.
 Followers of Fetus struck big politically. Look at Ollie North. Fetus
controlled his mind and made him a follower. Khadafi. Son of a bitch.
Ayatollah Khomeini. Could the world not see Fetus in these?
 Earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanoes. Oh at the violence within
the Fetal Ground. Holocaust? Hardly. Fetus got pissed a couple of times.
 Fetus felt proud of himself for spreading what started as a harmless
recipe in his kitchen, the AIDS Virus. Killed off plenty of fags and
druggies. Fetus felt remorse and pity for those who spread the
hallucinants and cocaine, but for the fags he felt not any such. Damned
baters. The world had too many Baters. About damned time some of them
were flushed and fucked. Take that back, they enjoyed that.
 Farm Aid. Band Aid. We Are The World. Ethiopia hunger relief efforts.
Abortion rejects trying to do good things.
 Ozone holes. Hairspray, fluorocarbons, pollution? Nah, Fetus was just
constipated one day and blew it too hard. Meteors? No, corn in his
shit.
 Technology. Smaller televisions. Cellular phones. A distraction to
divert one's attention from driving. Wrecks. Statistics. Blood.
 Coca-Cola produced the biggest disaster of the Eighties. New Coke. Yes
that sickening shit that ruined the Cola Market forever. Jolt. A highly-
caffeinated cola/sugar drink that would hype up Fetal Killers and send
them on rampage. Chaos.
 Metallica came around. Hell yeah. And Slayer. Oh boy! Music to run
people's lives! Death of Randy Rhoads. Ozzy leaves Black Sabbath and
goes on his own. Fetus intervenes and allows Ozzy to bang some Lita
Ford bitch and sing songs with her.
 Amiga. Commodore's release of the machine provided programmers with
a means by which to create an ultimate Program to destroy the Earth.
Then some reject came along, fucked up, and used such a machine for
mere things as doing a piece of shit called Max Headroom...
 Power Politics. Reagan. Bush. Quayle. Turkey..ahem scratch the Bird
Thoughts. Gorbachev. The death of Andre Saccharine..er..Sakharov.
Downing of the Berlin Wall. Political Violence in Rumania. Czechoslovakia.
Damn Fetus did some good work with world-wide violence. Oh gee look
at the Middle East, Gaza Strip, West Bank, Jerusalem. Lebanon.
 The Leaning Tower of Pisa. It leans. So what? It's closed for restoration.
It may fall. Kill a couple of people. Who the hell cares?
 
 I must go now and light some Black Candles and invoke Fetus the Destroyer
to come and plan his Chaos for the Nineties.
