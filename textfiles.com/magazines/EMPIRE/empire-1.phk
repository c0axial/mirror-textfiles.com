                           These Damn New Boards 
							by:
(The Year of The BBS's Stagnation)			   Albatross
*******************************************************************************



		Now lemme start off with the fact that the Washington, DC
	area is crawlling with hackers and shit every-which-way. And 
	because of this is has it's Pro's & Con's. 

		The Pro's are that we living here in this General area
	have a wide diversity of people that a few good people in there
	fields pop up outta know where and are just known as being great,
	such as (Nat X, Dr. No Good,            ) and many others that
	have come from being nobody's to being well known as The Masters
	in there field.

		But the Con's are, the fact that assholes that don't know
	the time of day if they had a Rolex on, are starting now to run
	around starting up Boards & saying the fucking word 'ELITE' to
	god damn much. Ya see there problem is that they don't know a
	mother fucking thing and because of that they feel that starting
	a BBS (With leeched philes from The Empire) will make them somehow
	Important in the Underground Commmunity. That just isn't the way 
	you can expect to become known and honored, if you running a board
	that doesn't know the first shit about crap.  See a BBS should be run
	by a Sysop that atleast understands about 70% of all the fields of
	Phreaking, hacking, Carding, Bombing, etc... Where as the jerks
	starting up NewBee boards are usually 13-15 and don't know the first
	thing about anything nor do they know the danger they face.
		See one thing I wanna get across is the fact that, The F.B.I.
	doesn't play games and they don't give a shit if your under age 18,
	because when you play in the Big League's you gotta be ready to go
	to the Big House. Most of these 13-15 yr. olds don't know that you
	can still be tried as an adult if the crime is serious enof.
	And I'll give you a few ideas that a Sysop might face if there board 
	is bust by the Feds.	

Charges:
-------

Conspiriacy to Disturibute Illegal Credit Card Information
Conspiriacy to Defraud Telephone Services
Possession of Illegal Telephone Security Codes
Conspiriacy to Compromise Government & Private Computer Systems

Actions:
-------

Seizures of Any and All Computer Equipment (Modems, Computers, etc..)
Arrested Until bailed or court date (Nine Months down the road)
Loss of Job due to Arrest , Unless ya got a cool job
Watched by F.B.I. until Court Date (Don't Jump Bail)




		Now see, The Newbee fuckers not only are the most fucked
	up assholes to start boards, but can pose a Security risk for
	every member on there board, for the fact that they are advertising
	like mad everyday and drawing attention to themselves. And with that
	in mind, if there board is busted not only are they fucked, but NOW
	The Feds know of about 100+ local area users that might be dealing 
	in the Art of Hacking, Phreaking, etc..

	Cure:	If you all would try and learn the Art of PHAC and master it
		and maybe try and come up with new ideas and ways of doing
		things you'll get you name known and maybe become another
		'Knight Lighting or Phiber Optik <= hehehehe.
		But if you all wanna take the easy way out and try and make
		a fast name for yourself go ahead and take the Risk.

         Revised Patch for SunOS /usr/etc/rpc.mountd Vulnerability

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   *** THIS IS A REVISED CERT ADVISORY ***
          *** IT CONTAINS NEW VULNERABILITY AND PATCH INFORMATION ***
                  *** SUPERSEDES CERT ADVISORY CA-91:09 ***

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning the availability of a revised security
patch for /usr/etc/rpc.mountd in Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation
operating systems.  This patch fixes an additional vulnerability that
was not addressed in CERT advisory CA-91:09.SunOS.rpc.mountd.vulnerability.
Sun has provided patches for SunOS 4.1, SunOS 4.1_PSR_A, SunOS 4.1.1,
and SunOS 4.1.2.  These patches are available through your local Sun
Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9)
in the /systems/sun/sun-dist directory.

Patch ID and file information are as follows:

Fix                     Patch ID       Filename            Checksum
/usr/etc/rpc.mountd     100296-02      100296-02.tar.Z     30606    23

Please note that Sun Microsystems sometimes updates patch files.  If you
find that the checksum is different, please contact Sun Microsystems or
the CERT/CC for verification.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.   Description

     Under certain conditions an exported NFS filesystem can be
     mounted by any system on the Internet even though it may appear
     that access to the filesystem is restricted to specific hosts.

II.  Impact
 
     Unauthorized remote hosts will be able to mount the exported filesystem.
 
III. Solution

     As root:

     1.  Move the existing rpc.mountd aside and change the permissions.

         # mv /usr/etc/rpc.mountd /usr/etc/rpc.mountd.OLD
         # chmod 400 /usr/etc/rpc.mountd.OLD

     2.  Install the new version

         # cp `arch`/rpc.mountd /usr/etc
         # chown root.staff /usr/etc/rpc.mountd
         # chmod 755 /usr/etc/rpc.mountd

     3.  Kill the currently running rpc.mountd and restart it, or
         reboot the system.  In either case, systems with filesystems
         mounted from this host will have interruptions in service.

                          SSCU And What You Can Do
							by:
							    Albatross
*******************************************************************************



		Back in the Mid to Late 80's A few friends and me discovered 
	a really wierd fone system called SSCU (Or that's what it calls itself}.		Anyhow, we decided to check the shit out and found out that if you enter		a telefone number it will call that number 10 seconds later and go
	'Hello Hello Hello etc..' which can really piss of a person that doesn't		understand the first thing about it. Back then I wrote a phile on SSCU
	which has traveled all over informing those who read up on the subject.
		Anyhow, to get on with the story. I have discovered a few
	new things since that time which can really improve your knowledge, if
	not expand it on SSCU:


Fone Number:	(202) 362-9900
		(202) 362-9901

	
	  Follow the steps as follows:

System: Hello this is SSCU, Please enter your Identification Number.

You:	(301) XXX-XXXX  (The Fucker you wanna fuck with)
You:	# #  (Hit the pound sign twice)
System:	Thank You      'dut dut dut dut dut'
System:	10 Seconds later it calls
System:	Hello Hello Hello Hello etc....
Person:	Pisses the shit outta them at say 2 a.m. in the morning


|Now to do something new follow the steps above
|but when it calls do this:

You:	08*
System:	Please enter your ID number
You:	*3
System:	Please Enter something
You:	(301) XXX-XXXX (A Fone you want in the system for XX amount of time)
You:	# #
You:	Hang up and call back a few minutes later
Hear:	When ya call you get the fone number at the beginning of the
	SSCU message


			This is all cool and shit and great when
		some other hacker fuck head is messing with you and
		you might wanna spread his fone number around a little.

       Using "anonymous ftp" to get files from other Internet machines


                                Mark Moraes


Anonymous ftp is a facility offered by many machines on the Internet.
This permits you to log in with the ftp program with the user name
'anonymous' or the user name 'ftp'. When prompted for a password, type
your e-mail address -- it's not necessary, but it's a courtesy for
those sites that like to know who is making use of their facility. Be
courteous.

Most ftp sites do not like people getting files from them during their
working hours since they usually have other load on their systems --
avoid 9am-5pm in their time-zone.

Also bear in mind that countries are often connected by relatively
low-bandwidth links, so please check local archive sites before you
connect to some distant country to fetch something.  If you think the
item you want is popular, ask your local archive site sysadmin, who
may be willing to set up a copy on the local archive.

Different archive sites have different forms of etiquette -- if you see
a README or README.TXT file in the ftp directory, please read it.

Once you're connected to the remote site via ftp, you can look around
and retrieve files. (Most anonymous ftp sites do not permit people to
store files) The ftp program prompts you with

ftp>

and offers a few commands that are similar to Unix.  "cd" changes your
directory on the remote machine, "lcd" changes your directory on the
local machine, "get" will get a file, etc. See the manual page for ftp
(use the command "man ftp")

Typically, a directory called 'pub' is where the interesting things
are stored. Some sites will have a file with a name like ls-lR, that
contains a complete list of the files on that site. Otherwise, you can
type ls -lR and get such a listing -- for some sites, this can take
a LONG time.  This doesn't work on some sites.

Usually, files are grouped in composite "archive" files, so you don't
have to get many small files separately. The most common Unix archive
file format for the Internet is tar, usually indicated by a ".tar"
suffix in the file name.  tar archives can be unpacked by running the tar
command -- you may want to first do a 'tar t' on the file to see what
it contains before unpacking it.

Occasionally, people use shell archives (with .shar or .sh suffixes)
instead.  These are Unix Bourne shell scripts, with files encapsulated
in them.  Be careful when unpacking shell archives since they have to
be run through the Bourne shell to unpack them.  The simplest way is
to use the unshar command, if your system has one installed.
Otherwise, you have to delete all the leading text with an editor and
then run the rest of the text through "sh" o unpack the archive.  Make
sure you're in the directory you want the files in before you try
unpacking the archive, since there's no good way to list the contents
of an archive.

Files are often stored compressed -- for Unix, the most common form
is the compress program, indicated by a .Z suffix on the file name.

Sometimes, people use programs like arc (indicated by a .ARC suffix),
zoo (.ZOO), zip (.ZIP) or lharc (.LZH), which are combined archival
and compression formats. (There are lots of other archive formats -
talk to the systems staff if you encounter them and don't know how to
deal with them) Macintosh archives are often in StuffIt format (.SIT).
In each case, you need the relevant extraction program.  Usually, the
archive site will also have a copy of the extraction program for ftp.
Finally, there's the "self-extracting" archive format, popular in the
PC world -- they look like executable programs (.EXE) and when run,
they unpack the files they contain.

When retrieving non-text files, you must use binary mode, otherwise
the file gets messed up. To do this, use the 'binary' command. (It's
safe to set this for text files if the other end is a Unix system,
since Unix doesn't differentiate between text and binary file
representation. If the site at the other end is non-Unix, you may need
to use some other mode -- see the documents for that site and for ftp)

An example session follows -- the commands I typed are all underlined
with a row of carets (^^^^) and are usually typed at the % or ftp>
prompt.

   	Ok, lets see. Started last year in January. Started on boards. I was a 
huge fucking Gif freak. Was really PD, then I decided to start my own 
board. I had a small pirate section, some people called, got some numbers 
from them such as 'South of the Border' so I got into the warez scene 
(can't do shit with a 2400). Made my way up to K-rad ANSi artist. Was in
FuBaR graphx, Paradise graphics, Stoned, SMaCK, etc.. My first P/H board was Solsbury Hill. Got some philes and read them. (The Prophets file I still have).

 	My first unix I ever encountered was the ukelele. Fucking tried to hack it. Tried to send a fake write from root to Mavicon. heh.. Oh well, that was a failure. Then I became interested in c0dez.. Nat X helped me set up Code Thief (First time I ever talked to him. He was running a warez board).  I hacked some 9501033's.  Then I used them to call Terminus and I used to use accounts I leeched from boards. Also called LD such as bellyard in 313, TcH in 409/713, and my third LD board was PhunLine. With the accounts I leeched, I just started fucking around with Internet. Was an Internet freak. After my 950's died,
I used to use the NASA thing until that died. Then I discovered UMD becuase of my mudding. I began to mess around there.

	My accomplishments vary and I don't want to go into details, but I
got into a few systems here and there including a place at UMD. Got into a Governmental Cray computer. Social engineered people here and there.
Nothing spectacular. 

	Wish I could stay the fucking summer. It'd be a summer to remember.
Did some trashing with NAT X. Trashed an airforce dumpster. Nothing but phun. I've been to all 2600 meetings since March. Met the eleet Knight Lightning.

			In The Beginning ....




	In The Beginning The Empire Times was nothing more than an idea.
But in recent times The idea came to mind of how I could teach, educate, and
inform fellow users in the art of Hacking and Phreaking. The reasoning being,
that there are to many people out there that might be in the illegal world
but don't know shit about the illegal business. Most people are lame and
don't even try to hack systems or find those codez in a PBX.
	
	Well there is a Revolution in the air, and Washington D.C. Metro
Area is right in the heart of the action. There is so much talent and 
man-power in this area that it is un-real that most of the Great discovers
aren't even coming from here. Just from looking in the recent 2600 there is
only 2 Submission by two users that are from this General area, and that
is 'The Monk' & 'Juan Valdez' (Juan is in Southern VA right now).
Anyways, somehow there needs to be a revolution in Knowledge obtained and
explotied around here.

	The key for Washington to be put on the map as a Serious Hacker
town is for people to get involed, And the only people that can put in the
real time are the Newbee people that haven't been conformed to the old ways
of hacking. Newbee people might be lame as to the tricks and technics that
us Older and Knowledge folks might have, but they have a skill which is at
the heart of This Underground world, and that is 'The Will to Try different
Things'.  If people around here would get off there ass and start looking into
different possiblites, then something great might happen. 

	The Problem most people have is that they don't know where to start
and are scared of getting busted. Well, yeah you might get busted, you might
even go to jail or get a record, but that's the risk you take when you get
into this lifestyle. Nobody said hacking was safe. All I can say is for
you all to stop 'Shoveling Infomation around' (As Inhuman says), and get
out there and do something, Go subscribe to 2600, go read all the Phracks,write up your own programs, whatever it takes to gain the personal satisfaction
you want.

	What really sucks is that were are the luckiest people in the
country to have so much right next door, yet knowbody takes full advantage 
of it. IN the local calling area we have so many places to jump on The
Internet it's no phunny, such as George Masion Univ, Maryland Univ, Howard
Univ, George Washington Univ, Thomas Jefferson H.S., Blair High School,
and several other college and corporate firms to hack out and gain access
to the Hacker's Domain, but yet people stand on boards and beg for accounts
and shit. Most of you people don't understand that you won't get what you
desire of a BBS (Even The Empire), cause boards are just here to bring
information together and provide you with the tools to take care of your
business, you all have to do your part and call elsewhere looking to
commit crimes and fuck over the Gov't boyz...




	Over All I hope that this magazine will inspire people to
	to get off there ass and get out and do something...



'Charge the call to the COCOT as I so kindly did this afternoon'
