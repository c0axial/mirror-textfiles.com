   Breathe!

   -----

   + Introduction by Belial - [January 8, 1997]

   Welcome to the second edition of Breathe.  This issue is dedicated to the
   art of poetry.  The poems in this issue of Breathe reflect what, in my
   opinion, is "real" poetry.  That is, poetry that comes from the heart, the
   poetry that comes from your own mind, not influenced by the trends of the
   time, poetry written for the sake of the art... for the sake of the poet.
   It's too often that I see, especially on the computer, the art of poetry
   being abused.  The constant abuse of poetry has ultimately lead to the
   dismissal of poetry as being a beautiful and vital part of literature and
   writing or as a form of art in general.

   Poetry is an expression of the soul, working in conjunction with the mind
   and the body.

   The next few poems, in my opinion, reflect this definition of poetry.

   + "Untitled" by Belial (in memory of Tourian)

   [Note: This poem is dedicated to a friend of mine in the ansi art scene
          who died a number of months ago.  It sucks when people die, but it
          sucks more when people you know die.]

   Enter him, the lost soul's lost Paradise.           
   Calm sea, the bitter ocean's rage.
   A winter's wind, 
   The wayward candle, his once 
   Proud flame... 

   And to that, 
   The red leaf's broken wing.
   Take flight,
   A lifetime's life, and
   Silence in... 
   A lifetime's last 
   Twilight.

   + "Poet as Painter (for Screamin' Jay Hawkins)" by Stephen Edwards

   I'm painting an oil
   A portrait of a man
   How can I paint a smile
   On this foggy night?
   Dressed in black, his thin fingers wrinkle
   Arthritis hands that we'll never touch
   Catching a cab, or picking a flower
   Hitchhiking and bowling
   Maybe out on the river rowing
   How can I paint a smile
   On a name I don't know?
      All over the world little hearts are always breaking
      And little tears are falling
      Why would you think that he's any different?
   So again I ask you
   How can I put a smile on his face?

   + "The Black Dove"  by Mindcrime

   A man approached me on the stree today
   To peddle his wares of blue and grey.
   He spoke of my hate and my iniquity,
   My soul he could see despite my solidity.

   I never meant to be the man I am, 
   A skeptic, a sinner, too quick to damn.
   Lust ever present, I long for true love,
   Fear manifested, I dream the black dove.

   Change is forever sculpting my mind,
   It's too damn hard to live a life of this kind.
   My soul burning in hell, conscience maddending,
   Stuck in a life so depressing and saddening.

   I'm not locked in this life, I don't require a key,
   There's more of my life on the horizon, you see.
   I can't make it all happen, but i'll give it a shove,
   Freed from this life, fly away my black dove.

   + "Clone" by SpoonDog

   Doomed
   To utter submisson
   Of myself
   And all thought
   And emotion
   Trying to make me change
   Trying to make me a clone
   FUCK YOU!
   I'm never going to become
   One of you
   I will be who I am
   By myself
   And not you
   But the day will come
   When you win
   And I am left to
   Nothing
   Nothing
   Nothing
   A clone

   + "The Mighty Man" by Stephen Edwards

   I am the Mighty Man
   Master of my dark cigarette smoke filled apartment
   Ruler of the world
   I can sit here with my back on the floor
   And the world waits for me
   It slows
   It stops
   I eat, drink, smoke, fuck & shit
   And now, staring at the slow, unmoving walls of my apartment
   I rise
   And strut over to the window
   BAM! Window wide open, shadows in the moonlight, dick to the world
   I jerkoff out window so the world can move again
   In peace and eternal love
   Amen.

   + "Futile" by SpoonDog

   I dont know what's real
   Or what's meant to be
   Forsaken blind in this land of sight
   I am cast out
   I dont know how I want to feel
   Never did
   Constant inner hatred
   Can't fight it
   Bringing me down
   Faster,
   Faster
   To the ground
   Plunging me deeper into this hell
   Hoping I will awaken to anew
   But
   It doesnt stop
   The never ending
   Never stopping
   Never releasing
   Can't stop the anger and sorrow
   ... Futile

   + "Stage" by SpoonDog

   Every day
   I don my mask
   And
   I climb up onto this stage of mine
   And I perform
   I act as if I'm happy
   I act as if everything is fine
   But I am dying away
   A rotting corpse with a smiling face
   Contridiction
   Abomination
   Perched upon his own stage

   -----

   + "Surrender" by SpoonDog

   Thoughts scattered across the sky
   In a hazy mess
   Too far away for me to touch
   I reach my hands into the air
   Hoping to catch a piece of me
   Tangled
   And
   Distraught
   In despair
   Writhing to break free
   But my furious attempts
   Prove useless
   I now choose not to try anymore
   Been rejected too many times
   It's not worth the effort anymore
   I can't stand to be smashed into pieces again

   -----

   + "Nothing Did" by SpoonDog

   I walk here alone
   And
   I stare in their eyes
   And
   See emptiness
   And
   I feel sudden hatred at the way you are
   So beautiful above your barren wasteland inside
   I want to smash your face with my stare
   But
   I divert my eyes,
   Ponder my motivations,
   Reasons,
   Meaning... I find I have none at all
   And
   Go about my business...

   + "Untitled" by Belial

   Dreams,
   Visions of night.
   The soft swell
   Of imagination,
   The joy found
   In the rising sun.
   Simplicity--
   Life and pleasure.
   But,
   Blinded by pain
   And longing.
   Desire.
   Truth.
   The balance holds.
   Life.

   + "Dumb Girl" by Edicius

   Hey, I know you're dumb
   Really dumb at times
   You do really stupid things
   But that's ok
   You're just a girl

   I mean, hey, you're a girl
   It's not that bad
   It's just that you do stupid things
   & you're pretty dumb at times
   & you don't have self control
   Over your body, or your mind (at times)
   But that's ok

   I know you're dumb
   In fact, really stupid
   You're just a girl
   But I'm just a boy
   & I still like you
   Even though you're really dumb

   Given the chance
   I could be that dumb
   Well, I may not have sex
   With five different guys
   On videotape
   In front of strangers
   At a weird house
   With a carrot

   But that's ok
   Be as dumb as you want
   You're just a girl
   But I'll still like you
   Maybe we can be dumb together

   + "My Star In The Darkness" by Luke Skywalker

   The first time I saw her
   I was struck by her beasuty
   I know not how I came to find the star
   As it shot across the otherwise bleak night
   The trail it left behind illuminating
   A happier place to be thanks to that shooting star
   I often find myself wondering
   When will I see this star again
   It seems like forever until that fateful night
   I was not expecting it
   But her radiance once again fills the night time sky
   I can do nothing but appreciate, perhaps even give thanks
   This shooting star has given me light
   Pointed me in a new direction
   The image of the star is imbedded in my thoughts
   Majestically streaking through the black sky
   The star is no longer hard to find
   I see her everytime I close my eyes
   And I believe the star is now a part of me
   As together we ride off in the midnight sky

   + "Sea of Tears" by SpoonDog

   Drowning
   Sinking
   I try to call out to you
   But
   My voice is choked by 
   The raging sea of tears
   That I created myself
   You offer your hand to me
   To save me
   I wish to grasp on to it
   But I refuse your help
   Fearing pulling you in too
   I cannot trust myself
   Raging emotions deep inside
   Drowning me day by day
   Downward on a spiraling whirlpool
   Your hand still remain extended
   I still refuse
   Drowning by my own will...
