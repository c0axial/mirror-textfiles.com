ALSO - you can dial out using the VADIC command in place

    I seems that the cracking groups are warring and
    teaming  this  year  also.  I remember when there was just a few and no
    such thing as file points and no one cared and it was ALWAYS out  right
    away  because  people  didn't  horde them until they were cracked.  The
    Software Pirates Inc.  were  doing  great  things  with  programs  like
    SNATCHIT  (still  the  BEST pirating utility made!)  Anyways, ECA, MCM,
    and NYC groups have all merged into one big group called INC.   They've
    already had a few good cracks out now so watch for them.
    They  merged  together  to take on FiRM, another group who seems to get
    mad at everyone.  I guess it's good since they all work to get the  new
    games cracked and out fast.

    DELPHI ACCOUNT
    --------------
    On Telenet, type "C DELPHI"
    Username :PHOENIX
    Password (if needed still)
    PHOENIX
     or
    ARIZONA

    PcPursuit / STARLINK UPDATES
    ----------------------------
    Well,  it  looks  like  we're  slowly  being  beaten  by Telenet in the
    PcPursuit Code war.  If we have a code, it  dies  within  a  few  days.
    Next to impossible to hack anymore.  If you work on an exclusive ID too
    often,  it  will  die.   They've equipped some systems up with ANI (who
    cares?)  Now we must go onto fight STARLINK who seems  to  have  better
    global  access.   OF  course,  they  are  setup  like  actual USERS and
    PASSWORDS that you would see on a BBS.  But you know how  bad  people's
    passwords  can  be.. =)  So get a few accounts and get your friend's to
    help you hack on password  (use  Mentor's  Frequent  Password  List...)
    Then  Call  either  Hotel Chelsea, Fungus Land, or Ulterior Motives and
    tell us what you got and we'll gladly trade you for something else...
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    THE END:
    --------
    Well, That's about it for this issue.  Sorry it was  so  short  but  we
    were  really  strapped  for  time.  November's issue will definitely be
    BIGGER with more info for everyone.  If  you  would  like  to  have  an
    article/advertisement/etc. posted, then just leave me mail on ANY board
    Any  MINISTRY member is on.  We will have it in the next issue for sure
    if it is good enough to go in.  See ya next month.
