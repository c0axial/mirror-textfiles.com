This is a list of all installments of "The Adventures of
Lone Wolf Scientific" and when they first appeared--as well
as sneak previews of future installments:

I -- "The Computer Genius Goes to Work" -- The worst thing
that can happen to a globe-trotting computer genius is
gainful employment.  From a curb outside an artificial
intelligence company, computer genius S-max contemplates the
wreckage of his employment history.  He desperately hopes
the rescue mission is properly wired for his needs.
(1.21.91)

II -- "The Second Renaissance of Space Exploration
Technology and What Happened to It" -- Bashful boychild
software engineer Andrew.BAS stumbles unwittingly
into the neurosis and smashed dreams of the military-
industrial complex.  Within days he loses his soul while
waiting for a government security clearance.  (2.4.91)

III --  "When Men of Destiny Meet" -- Robbed of the last
vestiges of his engineering school idealism, the dimpled
young software engineer's spirits improve when he befriends
another man who also failed to get a job on the space
shuttle. (2.18.91)

IV  -- "Welcome to The People's Republic of Engineering --
Abandon Hope Ye Who Enter Here" -- Andrew.BAS, the kid
computer programmer who looks like the kind of computer
programmer Norman Rockwell would have drawn, is horrified to
learn that he will be writing batch files to aim nuclear
missiles.  Meanwhile, his new officemate gets into a snit
with their boss over anti-static boot mats.  (3.4.91)

V -- "Bad Days Befall The People's Republic of Engineering"
-- Super engineer-manager Gus Farwick contemplates his
newest problem employee and formulates ways to keep him
safely in his office.  (3.18.91)

VI -- "A Day in the Life of Two Defense Workers" --  S-max
and Andrew.BAS struggle to adjust to their new lives
as defense contractor workers.  When the computer builder
tires of his responsibilities keeping track of "super-string
defense links," he convinces his officemate that they should
design a closet-sized replica of NASA's Mission Control.
(4.1.91)

VII -- "The House Guest with 172 Soldering Irons" --
Andrew.BAS naively offers his homeless officemate a place to
sleep.  He and S-max are barely out of the company parking
garage when the generous-to-a-fault programmer begins to
regret his offer of hospitality. (4.15.91)

VIII -- "The House Where Andrew.BAS Lived" -- The home of a
computer programmer is always a special place.  It's where
free and perfect cerebral sensibility clash with a complete
ineptitude with tangible things.  Andrew.BAS's house is no
exception.  Overbearing houseguest S-max decides that, even
though it's nowhere near a Radio Shack, it's an ideal
place to inhabit indefinitely.  (4.29.91)

IX -- "The Ghost of Alan Turing" -- Monkish assembly
language wizard Austin Jellowack is pestered by an unwelcome
pal from a higher programming realm.  (5.15.91)

X -- (UPCOMING 5.27.91) -- "Tense Moments In Mission
Control" -- A nerve-wracking morning at military contractor
Dingready & Derringdo Aerospace is made even more tense
by a visit from boss Gus Farwick.  With notes and camera in
hand, the conniving head of engineering compiles
documentation to terminate the employment of his two most
troublesome employees.
