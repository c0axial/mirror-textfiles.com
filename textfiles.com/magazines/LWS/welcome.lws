     In a perfect world, S-max and Andrew.BAS would be
mission commanders on the space shuttle, but due to the
ineptitude of Fate, the computer hardware engineer and the
programmer wind up working for a government defense
contractor instead.  When they lose their jobs, thanks to
the hardware hacker's shenanigans, they start a high-tech
company.

     "The Adventures of Lone Wolf Scientific" is a bi-weekly
chronicle of a computer startup where technological
innovation never comes without a measure of chaos.  In the
coming months, you'll meet S-max, Lone Wolf Scientific's
Macchiavellian Head of Hardware who plots to change the
world with his Rube Goldbergish inventions, his soft-spoken
programmer sidekick, Andrew.BAS, who names all his programs
after successful Apollo flights, and Congressman Boris Q.
Popinrath, a technology gunho politician who finds in Lone
Wolf Scientific the only reason he can give constituents to
re-elect him.

     "The Adventures of Lone Wolf Scientific" is an
electronically syndicated series.  New installments appear
every two weeks (barring any misadventures on the part of
the author) on better computer bulletin boards and
electronic online services everywhere.

     You'll find the latest installments of "The Adventures
of Lone Wolf Scientific" in:

                Software Collection" and "Mahoney
                Collection"
