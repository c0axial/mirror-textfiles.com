 Section [1]: IIRG Update
              By: Mercenary

  First of all, allow me to say its good to be back and we promise not to
 allow so much time between issues in the future.
 I have received tons of e-mail asking where the Hell we've been.

  Hopefully, I can clear that up for you now.

  On several extended trips, I became extremely sick and was laid up
 for several weeks. During this time the Rune Stone went down for a period of
 4 weeks as I was unable to take care of daily operations to the network.
 As my health has returned, so has the Rune Stone.

  Now apparently there has been some confusion about the systems status, well
 for those of you who haven't heard the Rune Stone is up and running at its
 same old number (203)-832-8441. However, the New User Password (NUP) has
 changed to CYBERDECK due to over publication in numerous mainstream computer
 magazines. If you were a registered user as of April 1,1994 then you should
 still be in the userbase.

  For those of you wanting to submit information or articles to the IIRG, you
 should send us mail at our group account iirg@cyberspace.net or you can use
 my standby account at mercenar@works.com for any correspondence. I'd strongly
 suggest you use iirg@cyberspace.net for a quicker reply.

  So far 1994 hasn't been a good year for our distribution sites, many have
 gone down and are in need of replacement. For those sysops who'd be
 interested in carrying Phantasy Magazine as an official distribution site,
 please contact me on the Rune Stone.

  In other IIRG news....

  Anubis should be publishing the next IIRG Technical Journal very shortly.
 At press time he still didn't know what the next Journal would cover, but
 I'm sure it'll be a good one.

  I'd like to thank everyone for their support during my illness, and we
 hope to make the rest of 1994 a memorable one in the H/P community.

 Section [2]: Self-Reliance and Preparedness (Chapter I)
              By: Thomas Icom/IIRG


                        Self-Reliance and Preparedness
                                   Chapter I
                                  Who and Why?

     When most people think of "survivalism", they conjure up images of camo-
clad isolationists living in the "hills", stockpiling up an arsenal for "the
day after".  The reality of the situation is that for 90% of the people
practicing survivalism, or as they prefer; "self-reliance and preparedness",
the traditional survivalist image is about as alien a portrayal as you can
get.

     Your typical person who practices self-reliance and preparedness is just
an average individual who has the common sense to either make a few
preparations for future situations that could affect them negatively, or who
practice certain hobbies to partially alleviate their reliance on "the
system".  The family that raises a home garden and sells or cans their
surplus, the city dweller who practices anti-mugging techniques, individuals
who live in natural disaster-prone areas and have made plans to lessen
disaster effects, and people who know a good marketable trade and go into
business for themselves are all practicing self-reliance and preparedness.
Most practitioners of self-reliance and preparedness aren't even aware they
practice a definitive hobby.  To them it's just good common sense, and it is.

     So, why all the negative press?  The answer is simple.  People who
practice self-reliance and preparedness are less easily controlled than those
who rely on the system for their existence.  Take away some welfare
recipient's food stamps and weekly check, and they'll quickly fall in line.

     That isn't done so easily with a practitioner of self-reliance and
preparedness.  Because of this, the establishment will attack practitioners of
self-reliance and preparedness whenever possible.  That is the reason behind
gun control legislation, legislation against herbal and vitamin supplements,
draconian regulations that make it difficult for the small businessman to
operate profitably, and the large socialist "bread and circuses" programs the
government is pushing.  (Ancient Rome did the same thing to keep it's citizens
in line.)  It is also why "survivalists" and "computer hackers" are always
getting bad press; while mediocrity, stupidity, flagrant promiscuity, and
"following the crowd" are glamorized in the mass media.

     Sound incredible?  Not once you've studied the techniques used by
totalitarians to institute their control over the people.  In fact, those
techniques being used in our country today are considered standard operating
procedure.  They were used by Hitler and Stalin.  They are being used today.
They will be tried in the future.

     Despite all the subtle and obvious prejudice and persecution against
practitioners of self-reliance and preparedness, it remains a craft that is
quickly attracting people to it; people of high intelligence and common sense
who realize that when something goes wrong, no bureaucrat will come riding up
on a white stead to save them.  Those, in this day and age, who do believe
such nonsense are in for a ruse awakening; as such incidents as the LA riots,
Crown Heights (New York City) riots, Southeastern hurricanes, Midwestern river
flooding, increase in violent crime, worsening economy, thousands of layoffs,
and increasing totalitarian government measures have proven.

                          "This is How it All Begins"

     Self-reliance and preparedness is not for everyone.  Some people won't be
able to understand the concepts just presented to them.  Considering the
quality of the educational system these days, I'm not surprised that products
of it would consider the concept of self-reliance and preparedness alien to
them.  Some others are going to dismiss reality, and continue on with their
mundane existence.

     What is even more insidious however, is that some individuals, for
political reasons which should be obvious to the reader by now (I hope), will
violently disagree with me.  The typical vague accusations of insanity,
immoral activity, racism (Yes, it's true.  Despite the fact that race isn't
mentioned in this article, some idiot will throw in that accusation, along
with some half-assed explanation as to why.), and incitement to anarchy will
be loudly voiced.  Such activity is good, as it serves three purposes.  The
first is that the free and uninhibited discussion of ideas is necessary for
the function of a free society.  The second is that by opening their mouths
they automatically discredit themselves in the eyes of the intelligent.  The
third, as so often stated by the Brotherhood of the Sword and Rose, is that by
making themselves known it will make the job that will have to be done on the
"Night of the Rope" easier.  On that note, lest a gentle reader get bent out
of shape at the mention of hunting the opposition, it should be noted that the
most effective way to deal with something trying to destroy you is to destroy
it first.  As General George Patton once said, "You don't win a war by dying
for your country.  You win a war by making the other poor son of a bitch die
for his country."

     For those few remaining that have the intelligence, common sense, and
initiative to get involved in self-reliance and preparedness, the first thing
you need is the proper attitude.  You have to make the conscious decision to
begin to take charge of your life, and to gain your own self-determination and
reliance from those who've stolen it from you.  Once you have accepted the
fact that you are responsible for yourself, the rest is easy.  You'll also
find it much more satisfying to be a free spirit, soaring above the mundane;
knowing that you, instead of a faceless other, have control over your future.

     You need the desire to learn and broaden your horizons.  As the famous
Special Forces officer Larry Dring once said "It's what between your ears that
counts."  James Madison also said something similar, "A people who mean to be
their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives."

     You need to have a positive outlook.  Self-reliance and preparedness is
the art of living, not avoiding death.  While you should not view the world
through rose-colored glasses, neither should you resign yourself to doom.  The
proper outlook is somewhere in the middle.  You should acknowledge how bad
things are, and then say "Ok, now lets succeed against said problems", as
opposed to refusing to face the reality of a bad situation, or tackling a
problem with the objective of "avoiding defeat" or "minimizing losses".  When
faced with a situation always play to win, not lose or draw.  It's like the
old parable as to whether a glass is half empty or half full.

     Some people may find the psychological pep talk redundant or unnecessary.
I disagree.  You could be the most knowledgeable individual in the world on
self-reliance and preparedness, but if you have a negative attitude, that
knowledge is worthless.  A proper attitude is even more important than
education!  If you disagree with me, I only suggest you try adjusting your
attitude to a more positive outlook for a while, and then check to see if you
notice a difference in yourself.  You'll find that once you have the right
attitude down, your experiences will be much smoother.  You'll also find that
you'll have more confidence and generally feel better.

                                    "To know, to will, to dare, to be silent."
                                                         -Thomas Icom/IIRG
                                                       May Odin guide your way!

 Section [3]: ANI (Automatic Number Identification) - Part II
              By: Mercenary/IIRG

  In a previous issue of Phantasy, we published a toll-free number that
 was used as a demonstration of ANI. Well, like all good things - the
 toll-free number suffered a quick demise. Since then, we've received
 numerous requests for another 800 number or any other way that hackers
 could obtain the ANAC number for their area.
  Numerous trade publications have jumped on the band wagon, especially
 Nuts & Volts which has most recently as their July issue had articles
 on ANI. In Nuts & Volts they've published the PHUC-ANI as I like to call
 it, since it first appeared in a PHUC text file.
  That number is 1073214049889664, which has been in circulation for some
 time now. They've also published a Centel Communication Number which
 has already gone defunct.
  However another 800 ANI number that is still available is not even
 meant to be one. The Duke Power Company Automated Outage System at
 (800)769-3766 will read back to you the phone number from which you are
 calling if you call to report a power outage or pole light out.
  Since 1-800 ANI numbers are becoming few and far between, you will most
 likely be forced to use a local ANAC (Automatic Number Announcement Circuit).
 Most recently, an excellent ANAC list is being developed in the #Hack F.A.Q.
 by Voyager or more properly will@gnu.ai.mit.edu. What follows here is his
 list with a few additions and corrections of our own. We hope this helps
 all of you who have been begging for this information.

  NPA  ANAC number      Comments

  201  958             ion of PDA's (Personal Digital Assistants)
 that are being code-named "Tricorder". IBM is trying to keep a veil of
 secrecy on the project because they have not yet negotiated a deal with
 Paramount to use the brand name "Tricorder". If this is like any other
 standard IBM project, you might as well set Phasers on Kill. Because that's
 what they do to most projects.

  Section [9]: SPECIAL REPORT - The IIRG Hacker Acronym List Rapers

  Most recently, a rash of Acronym lists have been appearing that are direct
 rip-offs of the IIRG's Hacker Acronym List. We've never had a problem with
 any group or individual incorporating IIRG material into their work as long
 as the IIRG is acknowledged in the credits or program.
  Apparently some groups and individuals have forgotten this and have been
 incorporating IIRG material into their files and not properly crediting
 the group. Like any good author, Mercenary has incorporated several fake
 acronyms into the list which are known only to him.

  However at this time we'd like to look at one group that has used the
 IIRG's Acronym list and has properly credited the IIRG.
  MuTaNT has used our list as well as some additions of their own to
 create the HaCKeRS ACRoNYM TRaNSLaToR PPE for PCBoard 15.1+.
 They have created a very nice ppe that allows you to look up acronyms
 online. All PCBoard sysops are encouraged to add this fine PPE to your
 system.

  On the other side of the coin is a list put out by D. Leria on 7/23/94.
 This acronym list is one of the most blatant rip-offs of the IIRG's list
 that we've ever seen with no mention of the IIRG in the credits.
  If your gonna use our material, put us in the credits.
  This isn't the first time this has happened, we've got about 5 lists on
 the Rune Stone that are direct copies of the IIRG's list from other
 groups that have our telltale fake acronyms in their lists.
  Although this provides us with a good laugh from time to time,
 we may be forced to release our next list in a non-ascii format.

  Section [10]: Electronic Personal Organizers
                By: Thomas Icom/IIRG

    Most hobbyists keep a "hack book" to record information learned during
hacking sessions.  While writing things down for easier recall is a good thing,
there are certain types of information which could prove to be disastrous
should they be discovered in something as unsecured as a notebook.
    Some have taken their sensitive information and stored it in encrypted
form on their machines.  While this is a good technique when employed with a
secure algorithm, it makes ready accessibility and use in the field a problem
unless one has a small laptop or palmtop ($$$).
    A while ago, the electronic personal organizer came onto the market.  This
device fit into a pocket, and allowed one to store phone numbers and short
memos.  Some had password protection built in for secure information storage.
Unfortunately, these early models were expensive, limited in storage capacity,
and unreliable.  These problems have been solved with the new models, some of
which offer as much as 64K memory, and file transfer capability to/from a PC.
    The Royal "DM" series electronic personal organizers are representative
models.  There are three different models which offer different memory
capacities (DM118: 18K, DM134: 34K, DM138 38K).  The prices are reasonable;
starting at $25 for the DM118.  They have the following features:

    - Password Protection
    - Three phone number databases
    - 12/24 hour clock with multiple time zones and alarms
    - "Memo book"
    - Calender
    - metric/english measurement and currency conversion
    - 10 digit calculator
    - Schedule book linked to clock alarm
    - Infra-red wireless link for data transfer between a PC or other DM unit
    - Reset button for quick data erasure

    These devices are perfect "hackbooks" for storage of such proprietary data
as phone numbers, account numbers, passwords, access codes, names, frequencies,
and other information you want to keep from prying eyes.  While 18K might not
seem like much, it's plenty for phone numbers and similar information of a
temporary nature.  The password protection allows for up to an 8 character
alpha-numeric password, and is adequate for 90% of your security needs.
    Yes, I heard about how the password protection on one unit was cracked by
Scotland Yard who opened one up without killing the power, and managed to
directly access the unit's RAM.  Since you're naturally going to follow my
recommendation of being a law abiding citizen who doesn't do anything illegal,
I doubt you'll ever run into that situation.
    It now appears, however, that law abiding citizens are currently being
targeted by certain totalitarian types who don't like them exercising their
constitutional rights.  A recent incident that comes to mind were those people
who protested the building of half-way houses in their neighborhood, and were
subsequently harassed by HUD who subpoenaed their personal records, filed
"discrimination" charges against them, and court-ordered them to provide names
of friends and associates so HUD could also "investigate" additional people who
"might be practicing discrimination".
    If you feel that such an attack might be a problem; regularly back-up the
data onto a PC, encrypt it with some insanely secure algorithm, and when you
run into a problem requiring you to do a data-wipe quicker than the reset
button offers; break the unit in half and be glad you're safe and only out $25.
