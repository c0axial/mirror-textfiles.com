 Section [1]: IIRG Analysis of Police Statement
              By: The I.I.R.G.

  The following is an IIRG Analysis of Officer Richard Aniolowski's unsworn
 statement, which we find is full of errors and inconsistantcies.
  We provide it here as further proof of the incompetant and callous manner
 in which the West Hartford Connecticut Police Department is handling
 Mike Elanskys case.

 Paragraph 1:

      That I, Richard Aniolowski, am a member of the West Hartford
      Police Department and have been for ten years and 7 months
      and was promoted to Detective in September 1990.

 IIRG Analysis:

      This is probably the only paragraph in this whole document that
      we don't have an argument with.

 Paragraph 2:

      That on June 14, 1993, assistant state's attorney, Joan
      Alexander GA 14 assigned me to assist her in an
      investigation of a computer bulletin board that is
      disseminating information on how to manufacture explosives,
      bombs, and how to evade bomb squad technicians when they
      attempt to disarm such devices. The information included
      explicit and ((sic)) instructions on how to construct such
      devices with only laymans knowledge, and involved the
      promotion and encouragement of constructing such devices for
      purpose ((sic)) of "maiming or mortally wounding" law
      enforcement officials.

 IIRG Analysis:

      The IIRG has carefully screened the two files in question
      that the police are using against Mike, they are...

          Anarchy for Fun and Profit (Volume 1,Issue 1)
          Anarchy for Fun and Profit (Volume 1,Issue 2)
 
      Now other than the tongue in cheek disclaimers at the beginning
      of the files,
                              Issue 1
        /--------------------------------------------------\
        !  Note:                                           !

        !     FUCK OFF! This file is intended to promote   !
        !     General havoc and *ANARCHY* , and you cant   !
        !     do a god damn thing about it, PIGS.          !
        \--------------------------------------------------/
     
                              Issue 2
              /--------------------------------------\
              ! Note to Law-enforcement type people: !
              !  This file is intended to promote    !

              ! isnt a damn thing you can do about   !
              ! it, pigs!                            !
              \--------------------------------------/

   We can find no mention of "how to evade bomb squad technicians"
   or encouragement of "maiming or mortally wounding" law enforcement 
   officials." This claim is totally fictitous.

 Paragraph 3:
 
      That presently Michael Elansky has a court appearance for
      violation of probation. This probation is the result of an
      arrest for manufacturing explosives. In October, 1992,
      Michael Elansky was arrested for a burglary at Hall High
      School in which several dangerous chemicals were stolen. The
      chemicals stolen were sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid and
      nitric acid. All of these chemicals can be used to
      manufacture explosives. That it was on May 28, 1993 that
      Detective Goodrow of the Hartford Police Department gained
      access to the "Warehouse", a modem accessible computer
      bulletin board that can be reached over regular telephone
      lines, ((sic)) The Warehouse is operated and controlled
      solely and exclusively by Michael Elansky. Elansky as the
      operator of the bulletin board system (BBS), is the only
      person who can delete files from the bulletin board, and is
      the only person who can determine which user may access the
      system and what level of access they may obtain. The user in
      this case were ((sic)) carefully screened and were required
      to make application to Elansky in order to be allowed
      access.

 IIRG Analysis:
 
      Mike has had problems with the law in the past, this we are not
      disputing. But we really wish the police and media would not
      over-exagerate the facts. Here is what we really know,

        1. The Media claims that Mike was arrested for "having weapons
           in a vehicle and carrying a pistol without a permit"
           Had they checked the facts of the matter, they would have 
           found out that this "Pistol" was in fact a BB Gun.

        2. The Police cite Mikes arrest for "for a burglary at Hall
           High School". Now notice they forget to mention in this 
           statement that the robbery was really carried out by two 
           teenagers and not by Mike.
           They vainly tried to link him to the robbery and the charges
           were going to be dismissed the day of his arrest for this
           travisty of justice.

        3. In this document the police claim "several dangerous chemicals
           were stolen. The chemicals stolen were sulfuric acid, 
           hydrochloric acid and nitric acid. 
           All of these chemicals can be used to manufacture explosives."
           Now the IIRG has taken a look at this list and would like to
           ask why the police also didn't mention that these "dangerous"
           chemicals are all easily obtainable at your local hardware store
           or chemical supply house. 
           And please notice that they have a wide variety of uses and lets
           get these products off the shelf at Home Depot and Ace Hardware
           if their so dangerous!!

           Lets examine the list,

  Sulfuric Acid(Oil of Vitroil)  - commonly available at any well stocked
                                   hardware store or automotive store.
                                   Used in Car Batteries,Storage Batteries,
                                   in electroplating,refining copper and 
                                   silver, and in pickling iron.

  Hydrocloric Acid(Muriatic Acid)- commonly available at hardware stores and             
                                   large department stores. 
                                   Used in cleaning concrete,brick,ceramic 
                                   tile and metal. Also used for making glue,
                                   glucose and gelatine. Used for making
                                   chlorine in the laboratory.

  Nitric Acid                    - commonly available at chemical supply 
                                   outlets and small hobby shops.
                                   Used in making fertilizer,artificial silk
                                   (Rayon),dyes,celluloid, and to seperate
                                   gold from silver.

           Now lets look at the Police Departments claim "That it was on 
           May 28, 1993 that Detective Goodrow of the Hartford Police 
           Department gained access to the "Warehouse", a modem accessible 
           computer bulletin board that can be reached over regular telephone
           lines"
           Ok sounds simple enough? but we've carefully gone through Mikes
           sysop log for May 28th,1993 and can find no record of a new user
           logging on that day. If as they claim, he did log on to the 
           system on May 28th,1993 he was not using an authorized account
           and he is guilty under Connecticut General Statutes,
 
           SECTION 53a-251 Computer Crime

           (a) Defined. A person commits computer crime when he violated 
               any of the provisions of this section.

           (b) Unauthorized access to a computer system. (1) A person is 
               guilty of the computer crime of unauthorized access to a 
               computer system when, knowing that he is not authorized to 
               do so, he accesses or causes to be accesses any computer 
               system without authorization.

           We would request that proper authorties immediately take this
           dangerous computer cracker (Detective Goodrow) into custody
           and prosecute him to the full extent of the law.
           Its individuals like him that give "real hackers" a bad name.

           The police also claim that "The Warehouse is operated and 
           controlled solely and exclusively by Michael Elansky. 
           Elansky as the operator of the bulletin board system (BBS),
           is the only person who can delete files from the bulletin board,
           and is the only person who can determine which user may access the
           system and what level of access they may obtain. The user in
           this case were ((sic)) carefully screened and were required
           to make application to Elansky in order to be allowed access."

           Once again, we must shed a little light into this apparent
           dark closet of injustice. What the police failed to realize
           is that Mike had very little to do with daily upkeep of the
           Ware House and had numerous co-sysops to help him with the
           daily maintenance of the system.
           I hope the Law Enforcement agencies involved wouldn't handle
           a murder case in the same way in which they are apparently
           bungling through this case.

 Paragraph 4:

      The computer bulletin board in this case originates from the
      computer of Michael Elansky in the home of Michael Elansky
      ((address deleted)), West Hartford, Ct. Elansky being
      the authorized user of the bulletin board had a code name
      that identified him to the users of this bulletin board. The
      code name used by Elansky is "IONIZER."

 IIRG Analysis: 

      Ok they got the first part correct, Mike did own the computer
      but the house belongs to his parents.
      Mike was the Sysop of the Ware House, not the "authorized user"
      And yes his handle was "IONIZER"

 Paragraph 5:

      That Goodrow said the "Anarchy'" ((sic)) file he obtained
      through access to the Warehouse bulletin board through one 
      of the users systems.
      The file Anarchy that Goodrow accessed gave detailed
      instructions on how to manufacture explosives, bombs and
      went on to instruct the reader on how to evade police bomb
      squads in dismantling of bombs.

 IIRG Analysis:

      At NO TIME by Mikes logs did Detective Goodrow ever download this
      file unless he was using an authorized users account.
      At which point he would be guilty under SECTION 53a-251.
      As we have stated in an earlier article, only 2 users have ever
      downloaded ANARC2.ZIP that we could find.

                      1. HITMAN
                         18:56 05/23/93 LIBRARY FILE DOWNLOAD           
                         User Hitman download ANARCHY\ANARC2.ZIP                         

                         2. HOLLYWOOD

                         User Hollywood download ANARCHY\ANARC2.ZIP

      And as you can plainly see by the date stamp, these two dates fall
      several days earlier than the May 28th date quoted by this document.
      If Detective Goodrow had downloaded the file at all, why would the
      police try to obtain a copy of the file from Hitman as he stated
      to us in the following letter,


      Quote from Hitman -
      Date   : 08 Aug 93  10:19:14

         I'll tell you the whole story, as I told it to Ionizer
         last night (he called me from jail).  When I was out one
         day, the detective Mr. Anielwiski (or something like that)
         called.  I wasn't home, so, he talked to my dad.  My dad
         thought I was doing all of this shit too, so, he took it
         way out of proportion.  I got home, and he made me search
         for a file 'ANARC.*' on my hard drive.  Since it is
         really his computer and his phone line, there is nothing 
         that I could have done, since he could have easily done
         it himself.  Anyways, he said to delete it, so I wiped it
         via Norton's WIPE program, so it couldn't be recovered.
         Anyways, I guess the detective called back, and my dad said
         that I had the file.  But, it was wiped.  Anyways, my dad
         thought we'd just undelete it, but, he didn't realize that
         the file would just be a null file when we did so.  The
         rest of the story is what he told me, as I was at work the
         rest of the day.  The detective came over, and I guess my
         dad copied the null file onto a floppy, but, I think the
         floppy was bad anyways.  At any rate, to my knowledge, there
         is no information at all on the floppy, and, I've got no other
         copy of it on my hard drive.

         --Hitman

      I hope this will show our point that Mike is apparently being
      railroaded by the Police Department who seems to hold a personal
      vendetta against him. As for Hollywood, Mike tells us that the 
      police have not contacted him.

 Paragraph 6:

      That I supplied a photocopy of the file that Detective
      Goodrow downloaded from Michael Elansky Warehouse Bulletin
      Board.
      Some authorized users of Michael Elansky's are minors, a
      fact known to Elansky since he required that name, address
      and age prior to being allowed to access the bulletin board.
      The phone number used by Detective Goodrow to access
      "Warehouse" Bulletin Board put out by Elansky ((number
      deleted)). I obtained from SNETCO Security that the
      phone line belongs to Michael Elansky (address deleted)),
      West Hartford, CT.

 IIRG Analysis: 

      If as we assume, the police obtained the file from some other
      system, this case should be thrown out immediately.
      As for Mike knowing everyones identity, as any good sysop knows
      users constantly lie about their identities and ages.
      Some through fear of stupid Police State actions such as this
      little bizarre episode and some people just like to keep 
      a little privacy in their lives, and we can respect that.

      Mikes system was clearly labeled as a "Private and Confidential" system.
      I dont think the local West Hartford,CT chapter of the Knights 
      of Columbus would like it if they were raided during an
      initiation ceremony and charged with risk of injury since they
      are known to use fake guns in their initiation ceremony.
      But alas, since they are known as a "private" club, the police would
      never dare to raid them. (Not to mention 1/2 the members are cops).
      Sounds like a contradiction in terms to us.. 
      But since Mike is just a 21 year old, and doesn't have "political"
      clout, he may be harassed at will.
    
 Paragraph 7: 
 
      ((name deleted)) of Bloomfield, a University of Hartford
      student, and a user of bulletin board says the person who
      runs the bulletin board identifies himself as the "IONIZER"
      and is a student of The university of Hartford.
      On June 20, 1993 I interviewed and obtained a written
      statement from ((name deleted)) of East Hartford,
      he is 14 years of age.  He said he has spoken with Michael
      Elansky by phone on several occasions.
      Several hours after speaking with ((name deleted)) I
      received a phone call from Michael Elansky asking why I was
      investigating him.
      That ((sic)) I spoke with ((name deleted)), 17 years
      of age who downloaded but deleted.
      ((name deleted)) of Newington downloaded "ANARCHY" from
      the warehouse bulletin board. The material was downloaded onto a
      floppy disc for the police department.
      Elansky does promote, encourage and praise the manufacture
      of explosives such as pipe bombs and goes one step further
      in promoting techniques on how to evade, injure and kill
      bomb technicians attempting to neutralize the bomb.

      _EXCERPTS_

      To any law enforcement agency "FUCK OFF this file is
      intended to promote general havoc and *ANARCHY*, and you
      can't do a damn thing about it PIGS...instructions of making
      pipe bombs.  materials needed 6" pipes, drill

       ((CuD Moderators' Note: Were "instructions" withheld?))

      That in October 1992 the West Hartford Police Department
      conducted a search warrant at the home of Michael Elansky.
      The seizure included, pipes, approximately 6" long that had
      been capped and had been drilled into.
      Issue warrant...violation of Section 53a-179a inciting
      injury to persons or property and 53-21 risk of injury to a
      minor. dated July 26, 1993


 IIRG Analysis: 

       Now the above paragraph just re-hashes the same old BS over and over,
       the Police tried to obtain the file from outside sources.
       If they had downloaded the files themselves, why would they need 
       to obtain it elsewhere?
       Show us where Mike has ever encouraged others to make pipe bombs..
       Did He take out an ad in the Hartford Courant.... NO!
       Did He have his own TV Show, "Bombing With Mike"... NO!
       Does he pass out "Bomb Making Leaflets at School.... NO!
       So just where does he go and make these Praising Statements??

       Your Guess is as Good as Ours... Since its Police Propaganda!

  Section [3]: PUMP-CON II (A Bust Waiting to Happen)
               By: Saint Anarchy
  
  Many of you may have seen the Announcement that was placed in (CUD),
 Computer Underground Digest and distributed as a flyer in several locations
 for the Computer Conference - "PUMPCON II".
  We would like to take this time to Warn anyone planning to attend this 
 Conference that we've learned through several sources that this Conference
 is already known to the Philadelphia Police.
  The IIRG has learned that the Greenburgh, New York Police Department has
 notified Philadelphia Police to watch the Conference and they are
 currently planning to raid the Conference at the first sign of any
 improprieties.
  We found it interesting that the main Planner of this conference,
 "IXOM CODEX" (who Phantasy Magazine readers should know well enough by now)
 posted in the flyer that "Anyone interested in the Computer Underground
 except IIRG Members" was welcome to attend.
  This would of course be in reference to the many articles where the IIRG
 has warned you of this individuals selfish acts of betrayal and jealousy.
 This of course to us only further confirms the many allegations that "IXOM
 CODEX" is an informant.
  We also found it interesting that the flyer claims "proceeds above the
 Conference costs will be used to help the victims of last years conference",
 Since the only real arrest was that of "IXOM CODEX", (whos case has still not
 gone to trial) and he is the main planner of this years conference.
 It appears that PUMPCON II is just a ruse to fill Ixom's wallet and this
 Conference should really be called "RIPOFF II".
  Here is the ad thats being distributed, and we would strongly urge all
 individuals "DO NOT ATTEND THIS CONFERENCE!" for you own safetys sake.

      You are hereby cordially invited to attend the,

                 Second Annual PumpCon II Conference.  

      Just mail your name/handle, group (if any), home state to:

                            pumpcon@phantom.com

 It is necessary that you do mail this account so we know you are coming!

                   PumpCon FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

 This file is being written in response to all of the questions that I
 have been bombarded with.  Hopefully it will clear up any confusions
 that obviously must exist.

 1.  When is PumpCon?

 PumpCon II will be held Halloween Weekend 1993, October 29, 30, 31.

 2.  Where is PumpCon?

 PumpCon II will be at the Airport Comfort Inn, in Filadelfia,
 Pencilvania.  Get the PumpCon information file for further details.

 3.  Can I bring my computer?

 This is a question that really can't be answered until PumpCon.

 6.  Who is going to speak?

 This is also going to remain sekret until the event for security reasons.

 7.  Why go to PumpCon?

 I don't know, if you asked or even thought of that question, don't
 bother to show.  You obviously can't add to the conference.

 8.  What should I bring?

 Why/How should I know, again to ask such a question shows you
 obviously aren't needed.

 9.  Is Law Enforcement going to be there?

 This answer is not known at this time, but they are welcome, with an
 admittance fee double that of civilian attendees.

 10. Is there going to be alcohol/drugs?

 These substances will not be provided by the conference or any of the
 organizers,  does that answer your question?

  Section [4]: Tactical Radio Communication Equipment
               By: Thomas Icom/IIRG/Cybertek

  Reliable communications equipment is essential to any group's
 activities, whether you're doing a simple trashing run, or coordinating the
 defense of an area.  Fortunately, there exists a wide range of readily
 available, inexpensive equipment so even "technologically challenged"
 organizations can play.
  All the equipment mentioned is available at your local Radio Shack, so
 procurement won't be a hassle.  While not "state of the art" by any means,
 it nevertheless still works.  If you need something more advanced, then
 either recruit a commo specialist, or learn yourself.
  We'll start with CBs.  CBs have 40 channels available for use, and are
 available anywhere.  With a standard 3-5 watt handheld, you can expect a 1-5
 mile range, occasionally reaching out to 20 miles or more.  With a better
 antenna (base station), you can expect a maximum reliable range of 20-30
 miles, depending on terrain and interference from other stations.
  The main problem with CBs is that everyone has one.  As a result,
 security of unencrypted communications is lacking, and interference can be
 severe.  The interference problem can work to your benefit, however, by
 hiding your group's communications.  If you use a good code to make your
 group's communications sound like all the other CB'ers in your area, your
 communications will be quite secure.  Another advantage of CB's common
 availability is that possessing them raises no eyebrows.
  If you start with some better quality CBs, and then acquire a commo
 specialist or some commo knowledge, you can modify your equipment for higher
 power output and more channels.  This will increase your range and security.
  Another good-entry commo unit, suitable for intra-group communication
 while on a "run", are the 49 Mhz. headset/"hands-free" units.  They are
 inexpensive, and typically have a 1/4-1/2 mile range.  These are good to
 give to each member of the team so you all stay in touch should you loose
 visual contact of each other.  Their short range offers good security for
 tactical purposes, but you might have interference problems in suburban or
 urban areas because they use the same frequencies as cordless phones and
 wireless "baby monitors".  If you decide to purchase some of these units,
 make sure you get the ones with multiple channel capability, such as the
 Radio Shack #21-407.
  Taking a step into more professional equipment, there are the VHF and
 UHF business band handheld radios.  These radios have anywhere from one to
 six (or more) channels, and put out one to five watts.  With a five watt
 radio and a decent antenna, you can easily achieve a 50 mile range under the
 right conditions.  They also use FM transmission as opposed to CB's AM mode,
 resulting in a clearer signal.
  They are not without their disadvantages.  For starters they are
 expensive.  Low end units start at $100 apiece.  The off-the-shelf units are
 also equipped with common low-power frequencies called "garbage channels" by
 certain individuals in the industry.  In a lot of areas these frequencies
 are as bad as CB.  One such frequency, 154.6 Mhz, (Which incidentally is
 also the frequency that comes with The Radio Shack VHF Handheld.) is
 commonly used by McDonalds for their order windows.  While one can change
 frequencies, this does take some electronics knowledge, or the assistance of
 a technician.  Again unless you have a cool friend in the industry, this
 might be a problem, as most shops won't change crystals unless you are
 licensed for the frequency.
  If you spend more money, you can get user-programmable radios that are
 more versatile.  You'll then be able to find a nice quiet channel somewhere
 for your activities.  Programmable radios start at about $300 a piece.
  One thing you should definitely NOT DO is get some ham rigs and start
 operating on ham frequencies.  Hams are a territorial lot, and if they
 suspect unlicensed operation on their frequencies they will track it down
 just for the hell of it.
  One thing you should definitely do is use a verbal code system when
 transmitting.  This will greatly improve your security no matter what type of
 communications you use.  Avoid using things like Pig Latin, or words that
 realistically describe your group.
  This article just barely scratches the surface of this topic.  
 If you're interested in further info, send us mail on the Rune Stone.  
 I also suggest getting a copy of the ARRL Amateur Radio Handbook from the 
 American Radio Relay League, Newington, CT.  It contains a wealth of 
 information; although you'll need some electronics knowledge to understand 
 the material.

 Section [5]: DATA BANK OF THE GERMAN SPEAKING AN-ARCHISM
              From: Adamantios Diamantidis <ADAMANTIOS@XANTHI.CC.DUTH.GR>


                DATA BANK OF THE GERMAN SPEAKING AN-ARCHISM
                           The Da.d.A. Project
                DAtenbank des Deutschsprachigen Anarchismus

Berlin, Koln

    The history of the liberative movement has not yet been filed sufficiently.
That is, mainly, due to the lack of scientists with interest in exploring this
area.Thanks to that, people who need bibliographic information for some speci-
fic themes of the history of anarchism, must go through all direct sources and
derive from those some conclusions.Things are more difficult in case modern
litterature is required, for the theory and practice of liberative movements,
which have appeared in the meantime.
    The data bank of the the german speaking anarchism (DAtenbank des Deutsch-
sprachigen Anarchismus) is trying to cover the lack of bibliographic material.
Currently it files anarchistic or, generally, liberative documents and publi-
shes.Later it will comprehend documents which deal with the history and theory
of those movements.
    We are focusing our compilation activities, to the german speaking areas
with the perspection of enhancing that shortly.In parallel we are elaborating
an introduction to the publishing history of the printed material, which will
be informative for their political and editorial meanings.
    From the early 1980's, the filing of the german liberative press is open
for exploration.It covers the chronical period from the philosophic commence-
ments of the german anarchism, in the 1832, until nowadays.Strength of exrpes-
sion is given to newspapers and magazines, though collections of documents,
almanacs, year-books, congresses' protocols and catalogs are not omissioned.
Except of the anarchistic publishes we are also registering material whose
cooperatives or publishers were anarchists.The filing is achieved using all
the usual bibligraphical criterions (titles, publishers, date/district,
circulation, place of distribution et cetera).
    In order to handle the increasing demands of the people who would like to
access our material, we decided to publish our first synthetic registers in a
series of brochures.This publication, in restricted copies and four or five
continuations, will be available at the "File of Social and Civilization Histo-
ry" of the 'Libertad' publications in Berlin.The first brochure, is occupied
with the german liberative press from 1832 to 1890.Every copy of this serial
includes a diagram of the press' history, chronological bibliography of the
magazines and an index.
    We resume special researches through the data bank and we offer the results
printed.Until now we have filed over 1000 titles, which offer many different
elements for research each.
    Da.d.A. is a private, research project.We do not accept donations from
state institutions and other similar organizations.In that way we can continue
our efforts undistracted and independent.The disadvantage is that we support
Da.d.A. with personal expenses and when we have free time available.
    The modern liberative press is difficult to register and get filed.Although
liberative publications were developed in an unprecedented way (and not only
arithmetically) after 1968, few publications got access to libraries and files.
Especially today, we must tune up our practises in order to protect modern
press.We encourage every publisher of anarchistic material, even if productions
are seized nowadays, to send us information and, if possible, a copy of their
publications.They will get registered in our computer, filed in the library
for the Research of Social Demands, so that they will be accessible for studies
in the future.

  This is to let you know that the Phortune 500 Computing Posse has returned,
  once again, accepting new members.  Over the past years, we have had our
  ups and downs, still putting out over twenty IBM PC compatible tutors and

  These packages,including Code Thief [ALL VERSIONS AFTER v4 ARE *NOT* TRUE

Phortune 500:  Phreakdom's Newest Organization               February 16, 1987
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those of you who are in the least bit interested, Phortune 500 is a group
of telecommunication hobbyists who's goal is to spread information as well as
further their own knowledge in the world of telecommunications.  This new
group was formed by:

       Brew Associates/Handsomest One/Lord Lawless/The Renegade Chemist
             Quinton J. Miranda/Striker/The Mad Hacker/The Spiker

These eight members are also known as Board Of Directors (BOD).  They don't
claim to be *Elite* in the sense that they are they world's greatest hackers,
but they ARE somewhat picky about their members.  They prefer someone who
knows a bit about everything and has talents exclusive to him/herself.

One of the projects that Phortune 500 has completed is an individual password
AE type system.  It's called TransPhor.  It was written and created by Brew
Associates.  It has been Beta tested on The Undergraduate Lounge (Sysoped by
Quinton J. Miranda).   It is due to be released to the public throughout the
next few months.

Phortune 500 has been in operation for about 4 months, and has released two
newsletters of their own.  The Phortune 500 Newsletter is quite like the
"People" of contemporary magazines.  While some magazines cover the deep
technical aspects of the world in which we communicate, their newsletter tries
to cover the lighter side while throwing in information that they feel is "of
technical nature."   The third issue is due to be released by the end of this
month.

Section [7]  The Rumor Mill (Unconfirmed Rumors From the Underground)
             Edited By: Mercenary

                        DEF CON II (Early Notices)

 DEF CON ][ is being planned now, for July 22, 23, 24. in Las Vegas at 
The Sahara Hotel (The one with the exploding volcano in front) in Las Vegas.
Rooms will be $55 for a single or double occupancy.  
 Why Las Vegas again?  We looked at San Fransisco and Los Angeles.
But We wanted a West coast location with easy access for lots of people.
We also wanted the location to provide some distractions, so when
hundreds of people are bored they don't level the hotel.  With the
24 hour activity Vegas provides, I can be sure that there should
be enough to do should time provide.
 We will have midnight tech talks Friday and Saturday night at midnight.
with two speakers at each session, for those who want pure tech.
So far we have a Radio talk lined up for the tech talk.  I'm looking for a 
good cellular speaker and unix hacker.. Anyone know anything about 
satallites?
 Talks will be Saturday and 1/2 of Sunday.  I want to get more covered
this time.  If you have any suggested speakers please have them contact me.
More speakers will be planned if there is demand for it.  
We'll have speaking on Saturday, and also on Sunday, so we'll have almost 
twice the speaking time with two 'round table' style discussions.
Phillip Zimmerman (Author, PGP) says he will speak if he's not in jail.
(See blurb at end of this document for more information)
 The operators of cyberspace.com will support DEF CON ][ by providing 16 
terminals and a connection to the internet for the duration of the convention.
 We're tring to plan some virtual demonstrations.  We'll see.  
Let me know if you have any ideas beside operating an IRG channel for the 
length of the conference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         "IONIZER" ANARCHY SERIES?

  Rumor has it that a local Connecticut Hacker group will be releasing a
 whole new series of Anarchy Files dedicated to "Ionizer".
  We find this an amusing turn of events, we hope the West Hartford police
 will enjoy the new series, since they are the catalysts of this new
 series. 
  We're not sure of the groups name or the name of the new series, but
 we'll keep you posted on its outcome.

                             ----------------

HoHoCon is the largest annual gathering of those in, related to, or
wishing to know more about the computer underground. Attendees generally
include some of the most notable members of the "hacking" and "telecom"
community, journalists, authors, security professionals, lawyers, and a
host of others. Previous speakers include John Draper (Cap'n Crunch), Ray
Kaplan, Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe), Bruce Sterling, and many more. The
conference is also one of the very few that is completely open to the
public and we encourage anyone who is interested to attend.

                            Hotel Information
                            -----------------

The Austin North Hilton recently split its complex into two seperate
hotels; the Hilton and the newly added Super 8. HoHoCon guests have the
choice of staying in either hotel. Group rates are as followed :

Super 8: Single - $46.50, Double - $49.50, Triple - $52.50, Quad - $55.50
Hilton : Single - $69.00, Double - $79.00, Triple - $89.00, Quad - $99.00

Once again, the hotel has set aside a block of rooms for the conference
and we recommend making your reservations as early as possible to
guarantee a room within the block, if not to just guarantee a room period.
Rooms for the handicapped are available upon request. To make your
reservations, call the the number listed above that corresponds with where
you are and where you want to stay and make sure you tell them you are
with the HoHoCon conference or else you'll end up throwing more money
away. The hotel accepts American Express, Visa, Master Card, Discover,
Diner's Club, and Carte Blanche credit cards.

Check-in is 3:00 p.m. and check-out is 12:00 noon. Earlier check-in is
available if there are unoccupied rooms available. Please note that in
order for the hotel to hold a room past 6:00 p.m. on the date of arrival,
the individual reservation must be secured by a deposit or guaranteed
with one of the credit cards listed above. Also, any cancellations of
guaranteed reservations must be made prior to 6:00 p.m. on the date of
arrival. You will be responsible for full payment of any guaranteed
reservations which are not cancelled by this time.

The hotel provides transportaton to and from the airport and will give
you full information when you make your reservations.

                            Conference Details
                            __________________

HoHoCon will last 3 days, with the actual conference being held on
Saturday, December 18 starting at 11:00 a.m. and continuing until 5 p.m.
or earlier depending on the number of speakers. Although a few speakers
have confirmed their attendance, we are still in the planning stages and
will wait until the next update to release a speaking schedule. We welcome
any speaker or topic recommendations you might have (except for, say, "Why
I Luv Baked Potatos On A Stik!"), or, if you would like to speak yourself,
please contact us as soon as possible and let us know who you are, who you
represent (if anyone), the topic you wish to speak on, a rough estimate of
how long you will need, and whether or not you will be needing any
audio-visual aids.

We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year. If you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. Any organization or individual that
wants to bring flyers to distribute during the conference may do so. You
may also send your flyers to us ahead of time if you can not make it to
the conference and we will distribute them for you. Left over flyers are
included with information packets and orders that we send out, so if you
want to send extras, go ahead.


                                   Cost
                                   ----

Unlike smaller, less informative conferences, we do not ask you to shell
out hundreds of dollars just to get in the door, nor do we take your money
and then make you sleep in a tent. We are maintaining the motto of "give
$5 if you can", but due to the incredibly high conference room rate this
year, we may step up to "$5 minimum required donation" or "give us $5 or
we'll smash your head in". Five dollars is an outrageously low price
compared to the suit infested industry conferences or even the new "Cons
are k00l and trendy, I gotta do one too!" conferences that are charging
up to $50 for admission alone.

To encourage people to donate, we will once again be having our wonderless
"Raffle For The Elite" during the conference. We will issue a prize list
in a future update, but we can guarantee that this year there will be a
lot more (and better) prizes than last year, including a full system (and,
no, it's not a c64 or 286). Anyone who wishes to donate worthwhile items
to the raffle, please let us know ahead of time, or if it's a last minute
aquirement, just bring it to the conference.


                           Miscellaneous Notes
                           -------------------

To save myself some time by mailing responses to a lot of the same
questions I expect to get, I'll answer a few of them here.

Although I have not talked to him myself yet, Steve Ryan has told me that
Bruce Sterling will indeed be in attendance and may say a few words.

As far as I know, there will not be any visitors from any other planets
at the conference. Scot Chasin is still on Earth and will be making an
appearance.

Video cameras will *not* be allowed inside the conference room without
prior consent due to previous agreements made with speakers who do not
wish for certain parts of their speech to be rebroadcast. Still cameras
and Etch-A-Sketch's are fine and tape recorders are too easily hidden
for us to be able to control.

Videos and T-Shirts from last year's conference are still available, and
will also be on hand during the conference. We do not handle the LoD World
Tour shirts, but I can tell you that that the old ones are gone and a
*new* LoD shirt will be unveiled at the conference. The HoHoCon shirts are
$15 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 for two shirts). At this time, they only come
in extra large. We may add additional sizes if there is a demand for them.
The front of the shirt has the following in a white strip across the
chest:

                               I LOVE FEDS

      (Where LOVE = a red heart, very similar to the I LOVE NY logo)


                          And this on the back:

                            dFx & cDc Present

                               HOHOCON '92

                              December 18-20
                              Allen Park Inn
                              Houston, Texas


   There is another version of the shirt available with the following:

                               I LOVE WAREZ


The video includes footage from all three days, is six hours long and
costs $18 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 if purchasing another item also). Please
note that if you are purchasing multiple items, you only need to pay one
shipping charge of $4.00, not a charge for each item. If you wish to send
an order in now, make all checks or money orders payable to O.I.S.,
include your phone number and mail it to the street address listed below.
Allow a few weeks for arrival.

There will be new HoHoCon '93 shirts available at the conference and a
video of the festivities will be out early next year.


                              Correspondence
                              --------------

If anyone requires any additional information, needs to ask any questions,
wants to RSVP, wants to order anything, or would like to be added to the
mailing list to receive the HoHoCon updates, you may mail us at:

                                77008-4106


We also have a VMB which includes all the conference information and is
probably the fastest way to get updated reports. The number is:

                               713-867-9544

You can download any of the conference announcements and related
materials by calling Metalland Southwest at 713-468-5802, which is the
offical HoHoCon BBS. The board is up 24 hours a day and all baud rates
are supported.

Those of you with net access can ftp to cypher.com and find all the
HoHoCon information available in /pub/hohocon. The .gifs from previous
cons are *not* currently online.

Conference information and updates will most likely also be found in most
computer underground related publications and mailing lists, including
CuD, CSP, Mondo 2000, 2600, Phrack, TUC, phn0rd, cypherpunks, etc. They
should also appear in a number of newsgroups including comp.dcom.telecom,
alt.security, comp.org.eff.talk, and sci.crypt. We completely encourage
people to use, reprint, and distribute any information in this file.
                                                                         

     Same stupid ending statement from last year to make us look good
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

HoHoCon '93 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals and
gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct from the
source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members of the
computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We urge
people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn't happen
very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of the most famous people
from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance. Don't
wait to read about it in all the magazines and then wish you had been
there, make your plans to attend now! Be a part of what we hope to be our
largest and greatest conference ever.

                            IIRG ZINE WATCH

  The New Issue of 2600 is out and theirs nothing that extravagant in it.
 Of Course they put in the correct schematics for their "Quarter" dialer
 which the goofed up in the last issue.
  Boing Boing Number 11 is out and we loved the copy of "Zine - The Game"
 included in this issue. Please Note the Zine Cards and the "similarties"
 to actual individuals.
  Another new magazine worth mentioning is the "Fringe Ware Review", this
 magazine appears to be started up by some drop outs from "Boing Boing".
 This magazine is a definite "add" to your purchase list.
 Female Hackers, be sure to get your "Official 2600 Panties" offered in
 the widgets area.
  The October issue of "Boardwatch" has an article on "Ionizer" but
 apparently doesn't know our groups correct name. They refer to us in the
 article as the "International Information Retrieval Group".
 Maybe one day Boardwatch writers will actually read an online e-zine.
  The new issue of "Gray Areas" is also out and has a good 3 page review
 of DEFCON I. If you don't get this mag already, be sure to look for it.
  As of press time, these were the only magazines recieved in at the
 IIRG Mailbox. Starting with the next issue "Zine Watch" will be a full
 area in Phantasy.
  Magazine Publishers are asked to send us their Mags for full review at
 the IIRG mailbox. We will judge all magazines fairly and give your magazines
 subscription info.

                  FBI DIRECTOR TO HEAD CRIMINAL PROBES

  On Thursday October 21st, Attorney General Janet Reno said that FBI Director
 Louis J. Freech will oversee all criminal investigations by the Justice
 Department.
  This action has stopped the proposal by Vice-President Al Gore to merge the
 DEA into the FBI. Needless to say Federal Drug Agents celebrated the victory
 that there Would be no merger (IIRG NOTE: Rumor has it the Sparked up a few
 Joints for the occasion!)
  Freech will still mantain his position as head of the FBI, but he will 
 also now carry the title of Director of Investigative Agency Policies.
 Freech will also supervise the Border Patrol and U.S. Marshals Service when
 their work crosses into other agencies territories.

  (IIRG NOTE: We wonder if an Emergency Response is needed, Will they call
              Him D.I.A.P.E.R.)

      MAN INVOLVED IN ATM SCAM PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD IN OTHER CASES

  Alan Scott Pace of Tucson,Arizona pleaded guilty to more charges involving
 Credit Card Fraud in McLean,VA. in September 1992.
  It appears that Mr. Pace used a fraudulently obtained American Express card 
 to buy an $18,400 watch from a jewler.
  He also pleaded guilty to using a Counterfeit Cashiers Check in Montana to
 buy 100 ounces of gold nuggets and a Tiffany gold cup valued at $82,500.
  Pace will be sentenced November 10th for placing the Bougus ATM machine
 in the Manchester,CT. mall along with all the new counts.

            FBI OPERATION TARGETS THEFTS AND FRAUD AT IBM

  IBM announced that it has been covertly working with the FBI since 1991 to
 reveal widespread acts of componenet theft and fraud at IBM.
  The FBI has conducted sting operations in Kentucky and California to uncover
 illegal purchases and sales of IBM parts. IBM provided the FBI with 3,600
 defective PC boards that had been secretly coded so they could be traced.
  The Defective IBM boards that were sent out for metals recovery were 
 secretly sold to a parts broker by the recovery company.
