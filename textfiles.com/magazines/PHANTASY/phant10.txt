           What Really Happened with Randy Weaver in Naples,Idaho

 From my conversation (8/31/92) with: CHUCK SANDELIN-(Preacher),
 Who, with Bo Gritz, went into the house and talked with Randy Weaver.  
 Randy Weaver used to be in Special Forces with Bo Gritz.
 Randy and Chuck both apparently know a lot of the people that are Bo Gritz's
 supporters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Well, here it is- as close to the horse's mouth as any of us will probably
 ever get:

 The scenario:  

 Army Tanks and APC's surround the house, 
 300 troops from the National Guard, and US Army.
 100 FBI,BATF,and local law enforcement,  

 The House is high in the mountains on a rock ridge.

 "I said Randy isn't going to kill anybody. And I went in there and so did Bo
 and we talked to him." 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Diary of Randy Weaver Given to Chuck Sandelin by Randy Weaver and read to me
 today by telephone:


 RANDY WEAVER: (PARENTHETICALS ARE MY REMARKS - LT)

     11:30 August 21, 1992, the dogs starting barking.  Randy (Weaver),
 Kevin (Harris) and Sam (Weaver, Randy's son, age 13) ran out to see what the
 dogs were barking about.  Randy was carrying a 12 .ga shotgun, Kevin
 (Harris) was carrying a 30.06 bolt action, Sam was carrying a .223 mini 14.

  Old yeller, and Striker,(My dogs) were at the pump house, barking into the
 woods.
  Kevin,Sam and I went down to investigate. They Heard something running
 west, so Sam and Kevin followed Striker, I dropped down onto the logging
 road heading west.  "I didn't have any idea what we were chasing and we were
 hoping it was a deer.  When I reached the first fork in the logging road, a
 very well camouflaged person yelled, "Freeze, Randy."  I yelled, "Fuck you"
 and immediately retreated the 80 to 100 feet towards my home.  I realized 
 immediately that we had run smack in into a ZOG/NWO (Zionist Occupational
 Government/New World Order) ambush." 
  I stopped to see if I was being followed.  About that time I heard a gunshot
 and Striker yelped.  Then I heard two more shots and Striker stopped yelping.
  I started yelling for Sam and Kevin to return home and that the Feds
 had shot striker.  I also fired my shotgun once into the air to draw
 attention to myself and praying that would help.  I replaced the empty shell
 with a new one, shoving it past the extractor, jamming my shotgun.  I drew
 my 9 mm handgun and fired 3 or 4 rounds up into the air and I was yelling
 again for Sam to return home.  Sam said, "I'm coming, Dad."  I then walked
 backwards up the hill toward home, yelling to Sam and Kevin to come home.

 All the while I heard many shots ringing out from the direction of the
 ambush.  By the time I reached home, I still hadn't seen Sam or Kevin coming
 home and they didn't respond anymore when I called to them.  A few minutes
 later, Kevin came walking home.  We asked him if he had seen Sam and Kevin
 said, "Yes, Sam's dead."


 KEVIN HARRIS:

  "Me and Sam followed Striker through the woods until we came out onto
 the road that forks off the one that Randy was on, and runs north.  We (Kevin
 and Sam) headed South towards the same road that Randy was on.  Striker
 reached the corner first, then Sam, and then me.  A camouflaged person was
 in the road and he shot striker.  Sam yelled, "You shot striker, you Son of a
 Bitch"
  There was more than one then and they pointed guns at Sam and shots went
 off.  Sam opened fire and I took cover behind a stump as Sam headed up the
 road towards home.  It appeared Sam had been wounded in the right arm.  Also
 Sam yelled, "Oh shit, Kevin come on" and headed home.  The men were still
 shooting at Sam, so I shot one of the SOB's.  After they killed Sam, one of
 the Feds jumped out of the woods, and for the first time, declared he was a
 federal Marshall.  The Feds then grabbed their wounded and left.  I then
 headed home up the road and spotted Sam's body lying in the road, without a
 doubt, shot in the back.  I checked for a pulse and didn't find one and I
 went home.

 RANDY WEAVER:

  "When Kevin got home and told us Sam was dead, Kevin and I, and Vickie,
 walked back down the road to get Sam's body.  We brought him home and laid
 him in the guest shed.  We cleaned his body and wrapped him in a sheet.  We
 also brought Sam's rifle home and that is the weapon I am using now.  We
 left No weapon with Sam's body as was reported on the local news.  From that
 point on, we have never left the knoll and we have prepared to defend
 ourselves here.

  On Aug. 22, 1992, Saturday, the next day, sometime late afternoon, we
 heard our two remaining dogs start barking.  Kevin, Sarah (my oldest daughter)
 and I left the house to check the north perimeter.  We didn't see anything,
 so I was going into the guest house where Sam was, to see him one last time.
 As I reached up to unlatch the door, I was shot from the rear and hit in
 the upper right arm.  The bullet exited through my armpit.  Yahweh/Yashua
 (God) has almost totally healed it on the day of this writing.  When
 everyone heard the shot, Kevin and Sarah came around behind me and we headed
 for the house, in this order, Randy, Sarah, Kevin.  Vickie came outside the
 door and yelled, "What happened?"  I yelled, "I'm hit."  Vickie was holding
 the door open for us to get in the house, Elisheva (the 10 months old baby)
 in her arms.  A shot rang out and Vickie fell to the floor.  She had been
 shot in the head and she died instantly.  She fell in such a way that
  Elisheva wasn't harmed, praise Yahweh.  At the same time, Kevin fell through
 the door into the kitchen.  As near as we can tell, Kevin was struck with
 the same bullet that hit Vickie, leaving a very large wound on his left
 upper arm and penetrating his chest.  There are also several small fragment
 wounds on his arm.  Needless to say, we understand snipers are everywhere.

 (They killed Sam, wounded Randy, killed Vickie, and wounded Kevin)

  The feds totally covered up the murder of Gordon Kahl and Robert Mathews
 (torched to death on Whidbey Island), they are especially against right white
 racialists (like Pastor Butler in Idaho) and/or Tax protestors
  If they think we are going to trust them (we didn't trust them before they 
 shot us), they're crazy. Yahweh is starting to heal Kevin, we constantly pray
 that he'll be okay. Since Vickie, Kevin and I have been shot, we haven't left
 the house and do not plan to unless we are starved out, then we will most 
 certainly take the offensive.  It appears as though the feds are attempting 
 to draw fire from the house as an excuse to finish us all off.
     
 (Sarah is 15, Rachel 12, and Elisheva is 10 months).

  If they even so much as crack a windowpane on this house with thier phone
 robot, gas grenades, etc., etc., it's all over with.  Our heartfelt
 thanks goes out to all our sympathizers. Our faith is in our creater
  Yahweh/Joshua/The Messiah.  We do not fear the one world beast government.
 They can only take our lives.  Only Yahweh can destroy our souls.

 Samual Hanson Weaver and Vickie Jean Weaver are martyrs for Yahshua and
 the white race.  Even if the rest of us die, we win.  Hallelujah, keep the
 faith to all our families and brethren, we love you, hallelujah
                                                                
                                        Randy Weaver
                                        Kevin Harris
                                        Sarah Weaver
                                        Rachel and written in, Elisheva


Per Chuck Sandlin and Jackie Brown - friend who was inside the house 
                                    to remove  Vickie's body.

Chuck Sandlin:

 Re:   Telephone Robot:  Paul Harvey said on the radio yesterday  "There's a
 telephone right outside, Randy, reach out and get it and we will communicate
 with you."  When Bo got in the house, Randy said "Come here a minute.  See
 that robot with that telephone in its hand?  It's set up so that as soon as
 you take the receiver, there is a shotgun wired to it."  Up the other arm of
 the robot, there is a short trigger around the elbow.  Those that have seen
 it, Jackie Brown, Bo Gritz, and Randy, say it is a shotgun.  It's used for
 terrorists.

  One of the BATF agents keeping the public back had a sub-50 machine gun and
 was flicking the trigger, pointing it at Bo Gritz and a guy jumped between
 Bo and the man and told him he was breaking the law, and the agent just 
 laughed.

  The crowd was supporting randy and these agents laughing and smiling about 
 it. Word through the crowd is that a professional riot arouser will be coming
 to the camp, brought in by the feds.  It's as if they wanted an excuse to 
 start a fire-fight with the house.

  They always burn the evidence.  The feds took up a 20 gal drum of gas and a
 satchel pak to detonate it in a helicopter.  Two channel 2 news guys stopped
 this by identifying that they were watching. Needless to say they were 
 arrested. 
  It seems they were planning to blow up the house with everyone in it, 
 just like Whidbey Island.

 On August 25, 1992, 10:36, Idaho Bureau of Disaster services:  

 The Governor declared "Emergency Situation and Disaster" in Boundary County
 and Bonner Counties and martial law is in effect. Cecil D. Andrus, Governor. 

  Declaration of martial law cites to Idaho laws and says:

 46-601, authorization of National Guard and Organized Militia in service of 
 the state.  

 46-1008, activate the disaster response and recovery of the state, local, and
 intergovernment disaster emergency plans thats acceptable to the affected 
 areas; 

 (b) authorize the deployment and use of any forces to which the plan or plans
 apply; 

 (c) authorize the use or the distribution of any supplies, equipment,
 and materials and facilities assembled, stockpiled, or arranged to be made
 available for use during disaster emergencies.  The state of extreme
 emergency and disaster emergency hereby proclaimed and declared shall
 continue for a period of 30 days unless sooner terminated or extend in 30
 day increments.
 
 Chuck related a lot of other details.

  The US Marshall's service by phone to me yesterday and press releases they
 faxed said that Randy had been arrested in January 1991 on charges of
 selling a sawed off shotgun to an undercover agent.
 Chuck Sandelin said that this was a set up, that it was related to Randy's
 refusal to be a an informant on the Aryan Brotherhood and also due to some 
 hard feelings that went back to his Special Forces days when he turned in a 
 superior for keeping 1/2 the drugs from drug busts they were making.  
 Another source said that Randy was a well known militant, anti-establishment
 type that had probably done a lot of things and just never been caught -- 
 like Al Capone, who was finally caught by the IRS, but never really caught 
 murdering anyone.
  Anyway, he was arrested in January 1991 and didn't even have to post bond.
 He went home and didn't show up for his arraignment.  He may or may not have
 publicly claimed he would never come out until the false charges were
 dropped.

  Regardless, for a bench warrant on a charge that wasn't even enough for him
 to have to post bond on, the US Marshall service sent a team of six special
 operations officers from Boston to Idaho to do "surveillance" on Randy for
 18 months.

 Chuck says they were practicing military maneuvers in a two mile perimeter
 around Randy's house. 

 Chuck's phone was very obviously tapped.  So is ours.  This isn't funny.

 Section [2]: 

  Here is Microsoft's press release on the newswire about the bust of the
 
                             APL BBS:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From Newswire Fri Oct 30 09:24:49 1992 To: execnews
 Date: Fri, 30 Oct 92 08:57:06 PST
 Subject: Industry: More than $100,000 in illegal software seized in 
 first BSA bulletin board action in U.S.

 More than $100,000 in illegal software seized in first BSA bulletin
 board action in U.S.

 WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Illegal software valued in excess of $100,000
 was seized from an electronic bulletin board computer system (BBS)
 headquartered in Baltimore, Md., marking the first U.S. case for the
 Business Software Alliance (BSA) against a BBS for pirating software.

 The BSA previously initiated an enforcement campaign against illegal bulletin
 boards in Europe and is investigating illegal boards in Asia. As part of the
 U.S. seizure, more than $25,000 worth of hardware was confiscated in
 accordance with the court order, and the BBS, known as the APL, is no longer 
 in operation.
 
 Investigations conducted over the past several months found that through the
 APL BBS, thousands of illegal copies have been made of various software
 programs.  Plaintiffs in the case include six business software publishers:
 ALDUS, Autodesk, LOTUS Development, MICROSOFT, NOVELL, and WordPerfect.  The
 action against APL was for allegedly allowing BBS users to upload and 
 download copyrighted programs.

 Neary 500 software programs were available for copying through the APL BBS,
 an infringement of software publishers' copyright.  In addition, BSA seized
 APL's business records which detail members' time on the BBS and programs 
 uploaded and/or copied.  BSA is currently reviewing these records for 
 possible additional legal action against system users who may have illegally
 uploaded or downloaded copyrighted programs.

 "Electronic  bulletin boards create increasingly difficult problems in our
 efforts to combat piracy"' according to Robert Holleyman, president of
 the BSA.
 "While bulletin boards are useful tools to enhance communication channels,
 they also provide easy access for users to illegally copy software"
 Holleyman explained.

 Strict federal regulations prohibit the reproduction of copyrighted software.
 Legislation passed this year by the U.S. Congress contains provisions to
 increase the penalties against copyright infringers to up to five years
 imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

 The APL investigation, conducted by Software Security International on behalf
 of the BSA, concluded with a raid by Federal Marshals on Oct. 1, 1992.  In
 addition to the six business software publishers, the BSA action was taken on
 behalf of Nintendo.

 Bulletin boards have grown in popularity over the past several years,
 totalling  approximately 2000 in the United States alone. Through a modem,
 bulletin board users can easily communicate with other members. The BSA has 
 recently stepped up its worldwide efforts to eradicate the illegal copying 
 of software which occurs on some boards.

 The BSA is an organization devoted to combating software theft. Its worldwide
 campaign encompasses education, public policy, and enforcement programs in 
 more than 30 countries.  The members of the BSA include: ALDUS, 
 APPLE COMPUTER, Autodesk, LOTUS Development, MICROSOFT, NOVELL, 
 and WordPerfect.

 The BSA operates an Anti-piracy Hotline (1-800-688-2721) for callers seeking
 information about software piracy or to report suspected incidents of software
 theft.

 Section [3]: Nitro Tri-Iodide (Contact Explosive)
              By: The Ionizer

                  How not to kill you self when making..

                            Nitro Tri-Iodide
                        ( Contact Explosive )

  I am not encouraging you to go blow up your rivals or anything like that,
 but if this is really something you want to make,GO right ahead. This text 
 will help you make it without killing yourself which is what I came close to
 in preparing this file.
 
  First off, what is NitroTri Iodide? 

  It's a very simple mixture to make and is stable as long as it is kept wet.
 When this mixture is dry it becomes VERY sensitive to pressure changes like 
 dropping it or having your buddy sit on it.
  This stuff CAN NOT be moved,touched,or breathed on after it is dryed.
 
  Well let just get down to it and take you through a step by step on how 
  to make the stuff.

       There are 2 MAIN Ingredients needed with 1 optional one.
       --------------------------------------------------------

        MAIN:

             1. Ammonia Hydroxide
             2. Iodine Crystals

       Optional:

             1. Ethel alcohol


 
                  How do I get this stuff

   1. You may get Ammonia Hydroxide from a graphics supply house
      It is used for certain copying machines. If you do not
      have the means of getting it you may use regular 
      Household Ammonia.

   2. You can either buy them from a chemical supply store
      or you may get some tincture iodine (iodine mixed with alcohol)
      and evaporate the tincture in a dish at room tempature.
      You will need about 5 to 10 time the amount of tincture
      iodine to get the correct amount of crystals.

   3  ETHEL ALCOHOL can be bought as GRAIN alcohol or you may
      go to any local hardware store and get denatured alcohol
      which is the same with a poison added to make it undrinkable
      this is a STUPID bullshit routine for tax reasons.


   Ok now that you have everything lets get started....


  WARNING DO THIS OUTSIDE with plenty of ventilation.

  I SUGGEST you get a fan to blow the air down wind from you.
 Ammonia fumes are deadly and can be really painful like tear gas.

  Fill a glass jar with 5 times the amount of ammonia used for every 1 
 part of crystals. If you are using household ammonia use 15 to 20 times
 as it verys in dilutions.

 Get a coffee filter to hold ALL the iodine crystals in. 
 Place the crystals in the filter and completly submerge it in the ammonia.
 Every hour agitate the solution to speed up the process, this is not needed 
 but is sugested. Let it sit for a day to make sure that all the iodine has 
 reacted with the soultion.

 Not comes the messy part, Wear gloves for this part. 
 The iodine and ammonia can burn you skin and stain it, you can't get it off 
 very easily either.

 Take the coffee filter out you will notice a brown sludge in it.
 Take the alcohol and slowly pour it over the sludge washing off the 
 ammonia. If you want you may do this with water but do not do it if for 
 more then a min as it loses it effect the more you wash it in water.

 Place the sludge in a container with alcohol (STRONGLY ADVISED) or water.

  Well thats it, your all done KEEP it WET all the time if you let it dry 
  PRAY and run.

 Place a drop of the sludge, not the liquid on what ever you want to 
 destroy. let dry and throw a ball on it or something to set it off.
 If the drop is on something and theres nothing on top of the sludge
 the explosive force will go up.
 When you want it to go down,put something on top of it to allow the
 Explosive force to go down.

 The best use for it is injecting it in a key hole, it destroys the 
 lock and scares the shit out of the person putting the key in the hole.

 How powerful is this stuff ???

  Well i put 1 small drop on a penny and left it on a glass coffee table,
 Yes, I know a very stupid move on my part. I forgot about it and 
 threw my jacket on the table as I walked in and it DESTROYED the table 
 and blew a HUGE hole in my thick winter jacket. 

 DONT touch it with you fingers when dryed!!! 
 Unless you want to have only haver 9 fingers.

  Have fun but do it safely   

                                  The Ionizer........

 Part [4]: Slavelord Retires

 Dateline: October 28, 1992

  Good day people, it's your most loveable hateable person around, yes, that's
 right, The Slavelord..

  Most of you probably have heard of me in one way or another, my reputation
 as the "Loud Mouth" of The Humble Guys has well proceeded me.. And of course,
 my new group, OFG, has already developed a reputation of it's own in less
 then a month...

  Well, what I would basically like to say here is that I officially retire
 from the pirate scene. I think I can also speak for Hal 9000 on this too.

  Last night, October 27th, Dateline:NBC did an expose' on computer hackers.
 They interviewed one of the members of LOD, etc.. They main jist of the
 show was basically breaking into Fortune 500 companies, Banks, TRW, etc.
 During this show, they displayed a few BBS AD's. One of them was for
 The Final Fantasy, the other one was the old VGA Slave Den AD. I have
 recreated the Slave Den AD here for you (Titled NBCSUX.EXE) with EXACTLY
 what of the scroller was shown on national TV.

  4 Months ago, PC-Computing did an article on software piracy. Out of all
 the known pirates out there, the ONLY one mentioned was me. That really
 didn't bother me that much simply because WHO READS PC-COMPUTING ANYWAYS???

  But the NBC show, well that kind of shook me up. It's enough for me to say
 "I quit!". So, I Quit! When I originally joined THG, Candyman (here on
 referenced as Candydude) asked me to be the "Spokesperson of The Humble Guys".
 I was supposed to go around, beat my chest, and prove to the whole world
 that THG was #1. I did this, and I guess I did it REAL well. I imagine
 3 years from now, there will still be things mentioned about The Slavelord
 and THG. We've made computer history.

  Unlike SOME pirates who would love to be interviewed on the Donahue show,
 I am not into fame and glory. As a matter of fact, I want NO national
 attention. So rather then risking my family, my business, and everything
 I have any further, I retire respectfully from the pirate scene.

  Sysops: Please delete my account off your boards. Yes, EVERYONE please
 delete my account from your boards. The Slavelord is no longer. If
 "The Slavelord" EVER applies to your BBS, then you can bet it's a fake,
 and just delete him then.

  As far as BBS software, etc. I am still continuing to support the LSD BBS
 package, and there WILL be a release Saturday morning (Halloween release).
 You all can pick it up from the support board (you know the #).

  Well, I guess that's it, but there is one last thing I would love to say,
 since I've been dying to say it for years..

  So long, and thanks for all the fish...

  SL/OFG'92!

 P.S. Don't worry about OFG, the group will still stay together, I just won't
 be a force involved with it anymore.

               DECUS U.S. CHAPTER FALL SEMINARS AND SYMPOSIUM

SHREWSBURY, MA - October 8, 1992 - The U.S. Chapter of DECUS, the Digital
Equipment Computer Users Society, will hold its Fall Seminars and Symposium
programs, December 5 - 11, 1992 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas
Hilton Hotel, and Alexis Park Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada. Considered by many
to collectively be the most comprehensive and cost effective forum on working
with products, services and technologies from the Digital and Digital-related
arenas, the semiannual DECUS seminars and symposium programs continue to
provide a slate of training and professional networking opportunities
unmatched by any other events of their kind.

The DECUS Seminars program, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, December 5 and
6, will offer over 100 one- and two-day in-depth training sessions covering a
variety of technical topics. The program includes two workshops which focus
on introductory and advanced levels of working with DECforms. The workshops
will provide participants with the unique training opportunity of being able
to immediately apply what they learn in an interactive hands-on environment.

The Fall 1992 Symposium, which runs from December 7 - 11, will be a diverse
program of over 1,100 hours of sessions covering virtually every area of
computing. With up to 25 individual sessions running at any one time,
attendees can plan their own level of participation based on their needs and
time constraints. Symposium sessions will cover such interest areas as:
artificial intelligence; business practices; data management systems;
electronic publishing; fourth generation languages; multimedia; networks;
personal computing systems; security; VMS, ULTRIX, MUMPS and RISC based
platforms; and many more.

Once again DECUS will provide the most up-to-date information on Digital's
64-bit RISC Alpha architecture. A variety of both seminars and symposium
sessions will focus on the technical issues related to dealing with OpenVMS,
NT, and OSF/1 on Alpha systems. Application coexistence and migration;
converting to Alpha systems; Alpha I/O support and concepts; and Alpha
workstations are just a few of the topics that will be covered. In addition
to Digital developers involved with the Alpha project, a number of day-to-day
users who have successfully ported applications to the Alpha architecture
will also be on hand.

Dr. Donald A. Gaubatz, vice president of the Workstations and Servers Group
at Digital Equipment Corporation, will discuss ways in which Alpha-based
computing integrates the many diverse environments in use today, while
bringing a new level of productivity through open systems. Dr. Gaubatz's
keynote address "Alpha Computing: The Journey Begins" will be presented
Tuesday, December 8 at 8:00 a.m.

Other noted speakers will include Ron Bleed, vice chancellor of Information
Technologies for the Maricopa Community Colleges and current chair of the
board of directors of CAUSE, and Bruce Borden, vice president of Marketing at
Kubota Pacific Computer. Mr. Bleed, keynote speaker for the Education Special
Interest Group (SIG), will discuss "Using Technology to Harness the Winds of
Change in Education" on Monday, December 7 at 10:00 a.m. Mr. Borden will
present the Graphics Applications SIG keynote session entitled "Computing in
the 90s" on Tuesday, December 8 at 9:00 a.m.

A special stream of sessions designed to address both the technical and
managerial issues being faced by today's managers of information technology
will be presented on Monday and Tuesday, December 7 and 8. Sessions range
from such topics as: Strategic Planning for Information Systems; to Hiring
Honest People. The DECUS Management Track will also cover such Digital
specific issues as: Alpha Migration Planning; COHESION Overview; and
PATHWORKS Case Studies.

The symposium will also feature activities focusing on the issue of
multi-vendor application migration. Digital's U.S. Marketing Group will
sponsor several activities around this topic including migration
demonstrations and on-site meetings to provide information on available
migration paths. The group is also expected to provide roadmaps to selected
sessions dealing with migration from various vendor platforms to Digital open
systems platforms.

Further information on the programs is available in the Fall 1992 DECUS
Seminars and Symposium Registration Program which may be obtained by calling

                          PUMPCON '92 BUSTED
 
 Preliminary reports have it that Pump-Con '92 was Busted, we don't have
 any really solid information yet but we did have this before news of the
 bust from a sysop attending Pump-Con,

 GREETS TO Y'ALL from PumpCon '92....   tons of people up here.... tons of
 beer up here...   hehehe  it's great.  You don't know what you're
 missing.  :) 
 
 Later this morning we recieved these messages,

 Pumpcon was busted last night. Arrested for toll fraud/hacking were Randy S.
 Hacker, Ixiom Codex & a few others. The cops busted into the hotel room
 expecting to find noisey drunks & freaked out when they seen all the
 computers & hackers.    Nuff Said....

 RE: BUST

 Also Spicoli and Nuclear Nightmare got busted. Ixiomm and Randy were busted 
 for the organization of it I believe. Spicoli and NN I'm not sure about. Also,
 the computer shit was taken. Sucked really bad. And to think.. I was almost 
 there (Wasn't due to complications..). I wouldn't have my computer if I had 
 gone. (I was gonna take it..) And I would have had some other problems.. 
 Shit.. Oh well.. Damn shame..

      PUMCOM BUSTED!!!
Name: Hellraiser 
Date: Sun Nov 01 1992

 Allright, here's the deal.  Pumpcom took place this weekend.  Sad to say that
 the con was raided by the local police.  
 I have no fucking idea what it was all about.  20 of us were locked in a room
 for over six hours and interrogated one by one by local detectives.  
 From what I can gather they were investigating a system that was broken into. 
 I was there for just one hour before 6 or seven,
 Cops barged in claiming we were making to much noise.
 In minutes, the whole thing escalated when they saw the computers.  
 The whole thing stinks of a setup.  Sorry for the fucked up format, but I am 
 kind of nervous right now.
 Anyway, after about an hour of talking to local police in the con room, we 
 were all brought into another smaller room.  Each of us were callled in one by
 one for interrogation. What they asked me was, "Did you see any illegal 
 activity?" and "Was anyone using any compueters?"
 I told them what I knew -- NOTHING.
 Anyway there were four people arrested, who I will not say because I do not 
 feel it is right to do so. Finally after a body search of everybody, they 
 called us one by one and let us go, except for the people who got busted --
 they were cuffed and brought away in front of the whole group.  
 The FBI was brought in, but I did not see or hear from them.  
 A bunch of computers were confiscated as well as any notebooks, disks, modems,
 etc... I do not know what is going to become of it all, and I do not want to 
 know any further.  Safe to say I QUIT.

                       Hellraiser - retired.
