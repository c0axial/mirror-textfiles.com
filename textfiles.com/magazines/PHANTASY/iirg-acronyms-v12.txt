 In no way do we feel this chart is totally complete, but we feel its a good
     start for the novice or lazy hacker to quickly look up acronyms.
The current acronym list is a database of Hacking, Internet, Programming, 
Electronics, Medical, and Government Acronyms. We will once again be constantly
Updating the list from a wide variety of sources. Look for regular updates on
                    our website at http://www.iirg.org
     Future Issues of the Acronym list will be made available to the 
   Internet community free of charge. Any corporate, government, legal, 
   or otherwise commercial usage or possession (electronic or otherwise) is 
   strictly prohibited without written or expressed IIRG approval, and is in
