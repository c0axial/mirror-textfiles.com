EDITOR'S PAGE:
==============
So here I am, having made the Big Move from Philadelphia to London,
scanning the local news stand, when the only internet magazine catches my
eye with its large red letters: 'WOMEN GET WIRED'! I immediately grab it.
At home, I notice the other stories in much smaller type:

        'Browser howlers: British comedy online'

Heh. Browser howlers... gotta love it.

I flip to page 51: a picture of the "Britcomedy Digest" Union Jack flag
logo is staring me in the face. "Oh God," I think, "I'd better get
cracking on the next issue..."

So here it is! Fresh out of its cellophane wrapper, fresh and pungent,
waiting for you to "Digest" (sorry--'browser howlers' influence...), the
latest issue of BD.

With BD getting attention from internet magazines, there's more pressure to
produce varied issues. Afterall, living in London, I can no longer claim
that I can't cover anything but the US Britcom diet of "Red Dwarf,"
"Absolutely Fabulous," "Blackadder" and "Monty Python." BD is in its
"post-USA" phase, and the adjustment, while bound to be an improvement, is
not going to be smooth. I hope readers will bear with me as I do my
homework, which so far has consisted of browsing the BBC Worldservice
shop, watching one episode of "Men Behaving Badly," the new "Alexei Sayle
Show," and "Reeves and Mortimer" [God, Vic and Bob can be gross]. At the
request of many readers, "Chef" and "Waiting for God" will be covered in
future issues as well.

On thing that *won't* change at Britcomedy Digest is that it will still be,
as Jim Hayes of INTERNET magazine writes, "providing a platform for those
who fancy an appreciation of the comedian's art as an applied science."

In short: we'll be as pretentious as ever. ;)

As a recent recipient of a master's degree in astrophysics, I want to
praise you for bringing to my attention the extremely informative magnum
opus by Mr. Arnold Judas Rimmer ("Red Quasars and Their Effects On Super
Novas," vol. 1, no. 12). My own thesis, entitled GRAVITATIONAL LENSING
NEAR TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS, reveals direct observational evidence for the
warping of space near three Large Terrestrial Objects [designated LTOs]:
LTO-129 {Roseanne}, LTO-001 {Johnathan Frakes} and LTO-72UK {Jo Brand}. I
credit Mr. Rimmer's theological predecessor as my premier reference and
the guiding force behind my dissertation.

Dr. Johnathan Smith's revolutionary paper* BLUE QUASARS AND THEIR EFFECTS
UPON ~STANDARD NOVAE generated a major change in popular astrophysical
paradigm when Dr. Smith demonstrated direct observational evidence linking
planetary nebula NGC-7009 and a specific type of shellfish. "I am a
scallop" had a profound impact upon my research, yet Mr. Rimmer's deeper
insight into the problem completely eclipses all previous work in the
field, my own included. Had I been aware of the piscatory nature of the
problem earlier in my career, I am certain I would be employed today. On
behalf of the unemployed astrophysicists on the planet, I thank you for a
new direction in our area of expertise.

Love the idea of Yanks writing e-zines about obscure British comedy
shows--keep it up!

I thought you might be interested in news of the return of two episodes of
Spike Milligan's "Q5" series to the BBC archives. Missing since the
mid-seventies (when the tapes were wiped by the Beeb!), the two episodes
were returned to the BBC Archive as copies of black and white 16mm film
recordings borrowed from a private collector in London. They are believed
to be episodes two and three (TX 31 March '69 and 7 April '69
respectively). It is hoped that the same collector may have the remaining
episodes as well.

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: Thank you for writing--it's wonderful to receive email
from someone "on the inside." I'm currently looking for a writer to review
"Q5" and other Milligan projects; interested parties should send email to:
<melinda@cathouse.org>. And Steve--when are we going to see more web pages
authored by the BBC (a la "Fist of Fun")?

I'm responding to a letter which appeared in Britcomedy Digest a couple
months ago (see vol. 1, no. 7).  Yes, I am opening the closet door,
stepping out, and proclaiming, "I too am a member of the 'Chris Barrie is
a Sex God' club."

His insecurity is so cute, both when he's in character (as "Rimmer") and
when he goes out of character (e.g., on the [Red Dwarf] Smeg-Ups video).
He's angst-ridden and funny at the same time, which is very appealing.

Plus he has a nice toosh.
                               Joan A.- Seattle, Washington

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: According to a usenet post on alt.tv.red-dwarf, Chris
Barrie recently gave a talk at Oxford University, where he jokingly
refered to people who attend (Red Dwarf) conventions as "sad anorak
wearing people"... kind of a turn-off, considering he has bought six
sportscars, a tank, at least one motorcycle, and various other
transportation vehicles. Come on Chris, rip off your shirt to reveal the
anorak within...

WAIT TIL THE KIDS HEAR THIS--CLIFF RICHARD KNIGHTED

Among Her Majesty's birthday honors this year was Harry Rodger Webb,
otherwise known as Cliff Richard. Surprisingly, the 54 year-old
rock-n-roller is not the first in the industry to be knighted: Bob Geldof
was bestowed the honor after his fundraising efforts for famine victims in
Africa.

Sir Richard, who is little-known in the U.S., was the United Kingdom's
answer to Elvis, although he soon stopped aping Elvis and adopted a more
wholesome image. In 1965 he made a much-publicized conversion to
Christianity.

MILLIGAN SALUTES PYTHON

Spike Milligan has sung the praises of Monty Python publicly on RTE's "Late
Late Show" On being called a genius by one of the audience members, he
then called that member "another grovelling little bastard." He also spoke
and paid a huge compliment to Monty Python. "... we [the Q cast] were a
bunch of second-rate banana skins but the Python team were just so
wonderful - five excellent performers."

NEW CABLE CHANNEL FOR COMEDY

SelecTV--a combination of three companies including WitzEnd Productions and
Alamo TV--hit the airwaves June 1. The channel will show a mixture of
comedy and drama; some of the Britcoms include "Birds of a Feather,"
"Lovejoy," and "The New Statesman" - yes, Alan B'stard will appear on the
opening night of the new channel which will run from 1700 to midnight
weekdays and 1200 to midnight weekends.

NEWSQUIRKS
==========
STRESS-RELIEVING MONTY PYTHON

The Guardian (June 21) ran a story on how two young French UN soldiers
found temporary relief while surrounded by Serbs in their post eight miles
north-west of the Bosnian capital: they thought of Monty Python.

Sgt. Major Gilles Vanuxem and Sgt. Luc Houzelot recalled the scene where
King Arthur is not only kept out of the French fortress, but given such
insults as "Your mother was an 'amster and your father smelt of
elderberry!" They held their observation posts against Serbs for 22 days
before they were rescued and taken to Sarajevo.

CLEESE AD DEEMED UNSUITABLE FOR CHILDREN

"Look At The State We're In," the John Cleese/Dawn French drama series on
the constitution, was partially banned by the Independent Television
Commission on May 30. The ad shows Cleese shooting something off screen.
Although it was only a packet of cigarettes, the ITC were concerned at the
violence contained, and the commercial was taken off the children's
program time slots (1530-1700). The ITC regulate the adverts on the
commercial television stations in the UK. No other commercial in the
campaign has been affected. Cleese has made no comment.

CALLING MRS. FAWLTY TO RESCUE TESCO!

In the ever-increasing grocery-store bid for customers, Prunella Scales
(aka "Mrs. Fawlty" of "Fawlty Towers" fame) has been enlisted--she appears
in a commercial for Tesco's. Jane Horrocks ("Absolutely Fabulous," "Life
is Sweet") appears in the commercial as a character not unlike "Bubble."
It's hard to name a British comedian who *hasn't* appeared in commericals
or at least done voice-overs; Rowan Atkinson, Fry and Laurie, practically
the entire cast of "Red Dwarf," and others have done them. Fun tip from
BD: next time you're watching the telly, play "spot the comedian"...

RADIO TIMES LIKES THE OLD FAMILIAR ONES

When "Fawlty Towers" was recently dusted off for another run on British TV,
it made the cover of "Radio Times." Not surprising--it has made the cover
for the previous 16 years! (That's one way to cut costs.)

NODDING ACQUAINTANCES ONLY: "RED DWARF: THE LAST HUMAN"
======================================================
by Lizbeth Marcs <LizBeth258@aol.com>

There are only two rules to keep in mind when reading the long-awaited
third instalment to the "Red Dwarf" novels. RULE ONE: Expect a diversion,
but don't expect to laugh your way through the book. RULE TWO: Look at the
book as a separate entity because if you _try_ to reconcile it with the
television series, you'll only wind up pulling your hair out. That said,
you just might be prepared for this review.

"The Last Human" marks Doug Naylor's first foray into the "Red Dwarf"
universe alone, and I believe he acquits himself nicely on two fronts.
Without trying to give too much of the plot away, the novel has more of a
storyline than the previous two novels. "Infinity Welcomes Careful
Drivers" and "Better Than Life" struck me as more a series of vignettes
featuring the Four Boyz than novels with a storyline that ran the entire
length. Naylor's decision to weave one storyline through Lister and Co.'s
misadventures is an interesting departure. Secondly, he manages to build
an independent "alternate reality" from that which exists in the
television show without alienating his core audience of "Red Dwarf" fans.
However, some of the changes are jarring and others simply don't work.

In a nutshell, Dave Lister and his one true love Kristine Kochanski have
rejoined hologram Arnold Rimmer, Kryten the mechanoid and the Cat on
Starbug following their stay in the Backwards universe, where they found
themselves at the end of "Better Than Life." While traversing the
Omni-zone to get out of the Backwards universe and back to the Red Dwarf
and Holly, a miscalculation lands them in an alternate reality. In that
reality, they find a crashed Starbug containing three of the crew members'
dead bodies, Kochanski's alternative dying and Lister's alternative
missing. Lister just wants to get the smeg back to the Dwarf, but he's
persuaded to go looking for his alternative self, who's been incarcerated
in Cyberia, a high-tech psi-prison run by the various Gelfs who populate
the asteroid belt. Suffice to say, the crew engineers a break-out in which
the "real" Lister inadvertently gets left behind and the alternative
Lister escapes on Starbug. It just happens to be their bad luck that it
also turns out that the alternate Lister is the exact opposite of his
counterpart.

Before it's over, Kinitawowee Gelfs cross paths with Starbug on several
occasions,  Kochanski takes control of what's left of the Red Dwarf Posse,
Kryten gets to try his hand at humanity, Cat plays with a DNA machine, the
luck virus becomes key to everyone's survival, Lister manages to go from
frying pan to fire when he "escapes" Cyberia, Rimmer meets up with a
family member who forces him to redeem himself and at least one major
character dies. It's not giving anything away to say that even though most
of them manage to get through the Omni-zone in one battered piece by
hiding underground on a newly terraformed planet, they still are without
the Red Dwarf and Holly, they have no means to actually leave the planet
and they don't know what reality they've finally landed in.

What's right with the book is that Naylor sticks to "his" version of Red
Dwarf. The book tries to be consistent with the previous two novels and
within its own storyline. Even though Naylor doesn't always
manage to remain consistent, most of the time it's only on minor
points, with one or two _big_ exceptions, one of which involves Rimmer.
However, even with the larger exceptions noted above, there is
certainly very little in the book matching the inconsistencies that
the television show is famous for. However, since the television
show is a comedy, its inconsistencies are understandable and
forgivable since it's done all for a laugh. The inconsistencies in
the book, on the other hand, since it's a separate animal and tries
to take itself more seriously, are more annoying and do take away
from enjoyment of the storyline.

Most of the players do read true to their characters; you can imagine their
televised counterparts saying and doing the same things, even when a given
scene or conversation isn't lifted from the TV series. The notable
exception here is Cat, who reads false throughout the book. For the most
part, Cat reads like his televised counterpart in season six--that is,
when scenes from earlier seasons involving him aren't inserted in the
book. The most outstanding example of Cat's lost inherent "cattiness"
comes after he tastes the "luck virus" that the crew pick up during their
adventures. During the episode, he comes up with a "hyper-drive" and spews
mathematical concepts, not to mention quantum mechanics, that he
_shouldn't_ know. Since the purpose of the luck virus is supposed to make
you lucky, as opposed to smart, Cats' coming across like a college
professor is, to put it kindly, a character-shattering moment.

What little we see of the Gelf society as it evolved in the belt, as well
as the history of how it got there and the desperate future they face, is
fairly well thought-out and certainly intriguing. Though I know the main
purpose of the book is not to talk about strange new worlds, it might've
been nice to see a little bit more of the odd society the Boyz find
themselves in. (The mode of currency has to be read to be believed!)

Another point I liked, and here I'm going out on a limb because I'm sure
there are plenty who'll disagree with me, is the more sinister tone of
this novel. While I wasn't overly fond of the same tone in the television
series, I have to say it plays well in print. The jokes are certainly more
situation-orientated than the rat-tat-tat dialogue of season six, making
the novel more of a black comedy than a fluffy romp through space.
Certainly Naylor's notion of Cyberia is more creepy than "Justice World;"
the portions of the novel borrowed from the series' "DNA" and
"Quarantine" episodes play with more of a sense of danger and Lister's
cold-blooded sociopathological alternate is more chilling than the "evil
Lister" from "Demons and Angels." A number of these concepts would just
not go over well in a television series, even if the television series in
question wasn't a comedy.

Rimmer's treatment in this novel, oddly enough, is another good point. I
think we've discovered which one of the two series writers came up with the
bright idea of turning Rimmer into a hero at the end of season six. It's
obvious that Naylor seems to have a fondness for the neurotic hologram,
especially since he gets to play the role he was supposed to play: the
character with the alternative point of view as opposed to the cowardly
scapegoat. Rimmer's try at bravery makes more sense in the novel than in
the television series, given the situation he find himself in at the end,
but it still is just as startling for its 180-degree about-face.

Kryten's character also is redeemed by Naylor's treatment. While he still
becomes the de facto science officer and medical doctor, he is one with
serious limitations. His insistence on collecting reference material and
his dependence on getting information from other computers make him far
less of a know-it-all than the television version in series five and six
and, consequently, more fallible. He also has other built-in shortcomings,
such as his inability to kill a human and to disobey a direct order, which
have been given short-shrift in the series but play a vital role here in
the action of the plot. This version of Kryten reads more as the mechanoid
ought to be and in some ways, outshines his television counterpart.

However, I do have a number of reservations about the novel, starting with
the cursory treatment Naylor gives to important plot points. The Boyz
returning to the Backwards reality to retrieve Lister and Kochanski is
glossed over by a glib paragraph in the middle of the book. How Lister's
alternate manages to keep popping up like a bad penny near the end of the
novel also stretches credibility in the way some of those old "Flash
Gordon" serials from the 1940s do. Rimmer's hologrammatic status is also
fooled with: reference is made to his "hard light" body so the character
can physically interact with his environment, but when it's convenient,
people can reach through his (presumably) insubstantial body to get to his
light bee.

Naylor's use of "luck virus as story crutch" also gets to be a bit
tiresome, so much so that by the end of the book you're trying to figure
out how so much serum can come from two little vials. Rimmer meeting up
with his long-lost relative, while an interesting touch, flies directly in
the face of _both_ the television series and the previous two novels,
though the hologram's initial reaction had me chuckling. And finally, the
whole situation on the terra-formed planet Our Heroes find themselves on
towards the end of the book is written in prose that's a just bit to
purple and strikes me as way too melodramatic to be effective. In fact,
whenever "the Rage" reared it's ugly head, I found myself actually
laughing out loud, not because it was funny (it really wasn't supposed to
_be_ humorous) but because of the "squishy" language used to explain it,
its presence and its mission to make the planet uninhabitable for all life
forms.

Another complaint is the addition of Kochanski as part of the team, though
given her "live" status at the end of "Better Than Life," her presence in
the third novel was probably unavoidable. While her character is a
rarity--a strong, intelligent, well-written female character that is an
effective leader--it throws off the chemistry and further crushes what I
consider to be the "heart" of "Red Dwarf"--Lister and Rimmer's "Odd
Couple" relationship. If you thought the constant presence of Kryten and
Cat during season six cramped the duo, the addition of Kochanski into the
mix does nothing to help the situation. Naylor does use her effectively as
"the commanding officer" who keeps Rimmer in line when he gets to be too
much (it _was_ funny to read Rimmer ranting about how rank shouldn't make
a difference among the Posse, right after he salutes her and says "Yes,
ma'am.") and as a replacement for Lister when that character is out of the
picture, her presence seems out of place with the spirit of "Red
Dwarf"--four guys who are very unqualified for deep space survival trying
to make their way back earth. It's sad, simply because Naylor serves us up
a delicious character that I really and truly like and, in fact, I was
_excited_ by the prospect of having her around. But, by the middle of the
story, it was clear that the character simply didn't mesh with the other
four. Naylor himself seems to be aware of this, since he attempts, several
times, within the body of the novel to explain Kochanski's love for Lister
and fondness for the others, but it smacks more of desperation to
integrate the character into the "Red Dwarf" universe rather than explain
her presence.

On the whole, "The Last Human" is a quick light read that is diverting,
once you get through the slow start before the main action begins.
However, the book certainly is not a _must_ in the same way that "Infinity
Welcomes Careful Drivers" and "Better Than Life" are, even for "Red Dwarf"
fans. My recommendation is that you save yourself some hard-earned money
and borrow the book from the local library or wait for it to come out in
paperback before buying it.

A BIOGRAPHY OF RIK MAYALL
========================= excerpts from Andrew Wong's Rik Mayall FAQ.

First off: the answer to what seems to be everyone's question, "Where can I
write to Rik Mayall?" Send your fan mail to:

            Rik Mayall
            The Brunskill Management Ltd.
            Suite 8A
            169 Queens Gate
            LONDON SW7 5EH


PERSONAL INFO.
=============
Rik Mayall only got DDN at A-levels, but got to read for Drama at
Manchester University through Clearing. Whilst there he formed a Theatre
Company called 20th Century Coyote which he later took to the Edinburgh
Festival with great critical success and subsequently to the Comic Strip
in Soho. On leaving university he played Dromio of Syracuse in the Oxford
and Cambridge Shakespeare Company production of COMEDY OF ERRORS which
toured America for 3 months.

He was going out with Lise Meyer at the time of The Young Ones, but ditched
her when she was pregnant for his current wife. He refuses to discuss it
today.

TELEVISION
==========
THE YOUNG ONES

This programme made him famous. As well as co-writing it with Lise Meyer
and Ben Elton, he also played 'Rik' - a middle-class student trying to be
a left-wing radical while at the same time annoying everyone. Students of
the 1990s would call him "sad." Two series were made in 1982 and 1984.

BOTTOM

Some have called this the sequel to The Young Ones, in that it takes the
two main characters Rik and Vyvyan, updates them, changes their names and
puts them together in a flat in Hammersmith trying to get women. It's
written by Rik and Ade and three series have been made.

THE NEW STATESMAN

In this, Rik plays a radical right-wing Yorkshire Tory MP who is always out
to make a quick buck and a bang at the expense of anyone else.
Heavy-handed political satire but still manages to be funny. Produced by
Yorkshire Television, there were four serials and a 90-minute special.

It has won many awards including the International Emmy Award 1989, the
BAFTA Best Comedy Series for 1990 and at the International Film & TV
Festival of New York in January 1991, it was awarded the Special Craft

BRITANNICON '95
================
by Maddie Burgess

The Britannicon '95 convention recently held in Denver, Colorado, was just
the thing for avid fans of British television programs! The convention was
held Friday, June 2nd through Sunday, June 4th at the Sheraton Denver West
in Lakewood, a suburb of Denver. I attended the con with two other members
of the Bay Area Dwarfers, fans in Northern California of the British
science fiction comedy TV series, "Red Dwarf."

Flying in to the new Denver International Airport was an experience in
itself. The airport just opened in February and has an impressive array of
artwork, shops, and restaurants. The airport has also been heralded for
its innovations designed to reduce operating costs, eliminate delays and
increase safety. An underground train speeds passengers between concourses
and baggage areas. If only we could have been speeded from the airport to
our hotel! The new DIA is so far on the outskirts of town, it took over an
hour for the shuttle to transport us to the Sheraton.

The Sheraton is in the middle of renovations (the main lobby was in
shambles and crawling with workmen while we were there--most likely the
primary reason the front desk people seemed so irritable all weekend!).
The rooms were satisfactory, however, and the convention area--on the
second floor--was pleasant and easily accessed from the rooms via nearby
elevators.

Britannicon featured three celebrity guests: Danny John-Jules, Mark Ryan
and Richard Coyle. Danny John-Jules ("Cat" from "Red Dwarf") has a
considerable background in stage, film, television, and music. Danny has
played "Barrington" in the BBC television series "Maid Marian and her
Merry Men." He currently has a part in the new "Tomorrow People" series
which is being shown on the Nickelodeon channel. He has starred in stage
productions of "Carmen Jones," and (oddly enough) "Cats." The actor's film
credits include "The Great Muppet Caper" and "Labyrinth."

Mark Ryan was "Nasir" in the British series "Robin of Sherwood." Mark has
made numerous television appearances besides, and has recorded an album.
He can be seen in the new feature film "First Knight" with Sean Connery
and Richard Gere. Mark was also the weapons master for that film.

Richard Coyle is an American prop maker and has produced props for numerous
films including the "Star Trek" movies and "Ice Pirates"...and television
shows such as "Star Trek TNG" and "Nightrider."

Besides events featuring the guests, Britannicon also offered an art and
model show, dealers' room, costume contest, charity auction, the world
premiere of "Eye of the Beholder" in "The Stranger" series, games, demos,
an anime' room, and an extensive offering of British video, of which the
following is only a partial list:

  Red Dwarf                      Quatermass            The Stranger
  Robin of Sherwood              Monty Python          Blake's 7
  Doctor Who                     Fireball XL5          Captain Scarlett
  The Avengers                   Space 1999            The Champions
  The Prisoner                   Fawlty Towers         Blackadder
  Brittas Empire                 Bottom                Young Ones
  Absolutely Fabulous            French & Saunders     Spitting Image
  Maid Marian and Her Merry Men  Steptoe and Son       Not the 9:00 News
  Mr. Bean                       Thunderbirds          Benny Hill
  The Tomorrow People            UFO                   Starcops
  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Friday night's audience participation screening of "Thunderbirds Are Go"
(done in the spirit of "Mystery Science Theater" complete with
wisecracking puppets) was hilarious even at a late hour after our long
travel day!

Danny John-Jules and Mark Ryan each hosted their own half-hour question and
answer session on both Saturday and Sunday, and also teamed up for a
shared appearance each of those days. Most of the time, Danny and Mark
were lively and informative during the sessions--answering questions from
the audience, joking, and telling show business stories. Danny did talk
some about Craig Charles' recent brush with the law on rape charges. He
told of going to visit the other "Red Dwarf" actor in jail. It was a
disturbing experience, he admitted: being forced to talk with his friend
from the other side of a glass barrier. Danny also pointed out that the
charges not only threatened Craig's career at the time, but the
livelihoods of *all* the "Red Dwarf" cast and crew. It was a very
upsetting time for everyone, Danny glumly told the fans.

When asked what was his favorite part of "Red Dwarf," Danny seemed hard
pressed to come up with just one, but finally said he liked the first
appearance of "Duane Dibbley." He said the cast had to wait about ten
minutes for the audience to stop laughing so they could continue with
their lines! Danny revealed that, in spite of some of the difficult
dialoge on "Red Dwarf" (just try saying "polydridocdeca-e-hedron"!), most
of the cast's lines are memorized, and there are very few written notes
for the actors around the set. Danny said they are all very proud of that.

Both actors talked about the difficulties of constantly trying to find new
projects--especially in the UK--and dealing with the politics that seem to
permeate the industry. While performing in a play once, Mark hoped to try
out for a part that opened up after another actor quit. The producers told
him they didn't want him for that role, so Mark disguised himself and
auditioned for it under another name! Danny told a story of being on
location for the shooting of a commercial. When the lunch break was
called, Danny and the other actors were given their lunches, but nowhere
to sit and eat. They all ended up having their lunch in a car that was
being used in the commercial! One definitely got the impression that these
two hard-working chaps weren't exactly living the typical "Hollywood"
lifestyle!

Mark and Danny transformed themselves into auctioneers for Britannicon's
charity auction benefiting the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Among the
many donated items offered for auction were a "Seinfeld" photo autographed
by all the cast members, and a 10-foot by 40-foot (yes, I said *foot*)
"Star Trek Voyager" poster. The auction brought in over $1,000 for MDA,
thanks in part to the entertaining antics and motivational skills of the
two auctioneers.

Throughout the busy weekend the celebrity guests were the very definition
of affability and charm, easily chatting with their fans, readily signing
autographs and posing for photos. Monday morning, Mark Ryan even came over
to our table in the hotel restaurant, and asked if he could join us for
breakfast! (We had a little trouble answering him at first, as we were
still trying to recover from fits of laughter induced by our waitress
asking, "Would you like some toast...?").

Britannicon '95 was definitely a fun-filled weekend. Kudos go to directors
Arlen Feldman, Lynn Markley II, Phil Satterley, and Adriana Wood, and
their staff, contributors, and volunteers. As for my first-ever visit to
Denver, well, it's a lovely area and a great place to hold a
convention--Hope to return in 96!
