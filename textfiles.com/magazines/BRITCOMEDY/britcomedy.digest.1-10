VOL. I              Special issue: HAPPY RED NOSE DAY!      MARCH 17, 1995
No. 10

A monthly electronic newsletter on British comedies.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE ADJUST YOUR NOSES

Everyone knows that comedians are great at earning laughs and raising
smiles, but today they are out to prove that they are equally good at
raising lots of cold, hard cash.

Friday, March 17th is Comic Relief Red Nose Day 5, so don't be alarmed if
people are walking around looking like they have that virus from the new
Dustin Hoffman thriller Outbreak. It's all for a laugh, but more
importantly, it's all for a good cause. And since it comes along only once
every two years, we here at Britcomedy Digest would like to add our voice
to the many others supporting and celebrating Red Nose Day 1995.

FOR THE CLUELESS: WHAT IS COMIC RELIEF RED NOSE DAY?

Comic Relief was started a decade ago, and has sold over 16,000,000 plastic
red noses since then (though this year they're apparently selling one
which changes colour). The noses are worn on -- you got it -- Red Nose
Day.

The money raised from the sales, along with funds raised various other
events, goes to help the needy in the UK and Africa.

WHAT COMIC RELIEF HAS DONE

Since its inception in 1985, Comic Relief has raised more than 92 million
pounds, all of which has gone to help those in need. The wonderful thing
about the Comic Relief program is that it not only supports charities which
help people with their immediate needs, but also gives a high priority to
programs which foster self-reliance. It's about helping people and teaching
people how to help themselves.

Every county in the UK has a program which has been funded by Comic Relief.
Among these are PANDA (People's Alternatives To Narcotics, Drugs, and
Alcohol) and numerous shelters which provide accommodation 2,000+ homeless
young people each evening.

In Africa, which contains eight out the ten poorest countries in the world,
Comic Relief has supported land mine education for refugees in war-torn
Rwanda and has funded a peace conference in strife-ridden Burundi.

Another exciting and promising aspect of the Comic Relief program is its
commitment to education. Teachers in the UK have been given access to the
RIOTOUS ASSEMBLY pack, which includes a videocassette starring Ben Elton and
Tony Robinson. These tapes give students a greater understanding of the
issues which Comic Relief addresses.

HIGHLIGHTS FOR TODAY

As if having an excuse to wear a red nose in public isn't fun enough, some
of the biggest names in British comedy will perform live. Past highlights:
Cliff Richard and The Young Ones doing a version of Living Doll, Blackadder:
The Cavalier Years and The New Statesman At Number 10 skits.

BBC1 has scheduled "A Night Of Comic Relief," which will include, among
others, Lenny Henry, French and Saunders, Reeves and Mortimer, Mel Smith and
Griff Rhys Jones, Harry Enfield, Jonathan Ross. This special evening of
programming will run from 1900 to 0250. Some highlights will be:

   * Rowan Atkinson and Jayne Torvill skating together as "Torvill and
     Bean."
   * Dawn French in a skit written specifically for her by Victoria Wood.
     This is the first time the two women have ever worked together.
   * The Dickens spoof "Oliver 2: Let's Twist Again" written by Richard
     Curtis and starring Dame Diana Rigg, Michael Palin, Stephen Fry, Oliver
     Reed, Ron Moody, Jeremy Irons, Angus Deayton, and others. This will be
     shown in three parts throughout the evening.
   * Lenny Henry Presents Belfast Live, which not only celebrates Red Nose
     Day but St. Patrick's Day. Among the performers scheduled to appear
     live from the Belfast Opera House are Jo Brand, Ben Elton, Julian
     Clary. (Henry will be doing a Phil Collins Live Aid type thing by
     appearing first in London and then going by helicopter to Belfast.)
   * Wax On A Rampage, during which Ruby Wax uses whatever means possible to
     raise a million pounds. (And if anyone can do it, Ruby can...)

With this line-up, it might be very easy to get involved in the laughter and
forget what the cause is all about. However, several films during the course
of the evening (including reports from Richard Wilson in Uganda, Victoria
Wood in Zimbawbwe, and Billy Connolly in Mozambique) will show how Comic
Relief has helped change lives.
