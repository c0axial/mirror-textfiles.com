In the spirit of the season, we at Britcomedy Digest have compiled a wish
list for 1995...may the Comic Muse deliver them to us.

Britcomedy Digest's Wish List for 1995:
_______________________________________

1) To be hired by Comedy Central and put in charge of acquisitions and 
programming. That way, we'd make sure "The Young Ones" and "The Comic
Strip Presents" would be shown all day every day.

2) We know they'd never *do* it, but we'd like to see a "Young Ones"
reunion. Yeah, their bus went off a cliff and burst into flames in the last
episode, but surely these wild-eyed, big-bottomed anarchists would have
survived?

3) To see the BBC repeat "If You See God, Tell Him" (with Richard Briers, 
Adrian Edmondson).

4) Export "Knowing Me, Knowing You" to the states. We in the U.S. are dying
to see this show.

5) To see Holly and the Short Rouge One back in season 7 of "Red Dwarf". And
a more plausible explanation of how they got separated from the mining ship
in the first place ("stolen"--yeah, right. This isn't a Porsche we're
talkin' about...).

6) To see Lionheart release in NTSC format: seasons 5 and 6 of "Red Dwarf";
"Bottom"; "The Man From Auntie"; and the rest of "The Young Ones" (three
measley episodes, hrumph!)

7) Ben Elton and Richard Curtis reunited as scriptwriters for a new series.

8) To see Peter Cook get actively involved in comedy projects again. Cook's
talents should be showcased again, instead of seeing him in the
nicotine-stained old-statesman-of-comedy roles he's slipped into.

9) To see Spike Milligan's series "Q5," "Q6", etc., exhumed from the BBC
archives. Thank goodness Milligan recently won the British Comedy Award he
so justly deserved.

10) To attend a Christmas party with any of the above mentioned
people/entities and be able to spike the punch. Okay, so we're more on the
naughty side than the nice...

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
=====================
I have spent months looking for any and all available information about the
pre-Monty Python BBC (or IDE?) series "The Complete and Utter History of
Television (Britain)?". The series is referenced in the U.S. Showtime
special "20 Years of Python" (1990). But other than that, I can't find
thing one about it. Any information you can provide would be GREATLY
appreciated...
                              Gary St. Lawrence

MICHAEL CLARKSON RESPONDS: "The Complete and Utter History of Britain" was a
six-part historical spoof written by Michael Palin and Terry Jones. It was
first shown on ITV in early 1969. The series traced the history of Britain
from the early Stone Age up to the 17th century. London Weekend Television
(LWT), had given the series to Palin and Jones on the basis of the work
they had done in "The Frost Report." As to the question is the series still
around today, the answer is yes and no. Being only founded for a few months
when "Complete and Utter History" was made, the LWT's administrative side
was very weak. Terry Jones managed to obtain the filmed inserts, but the
studio pieces have never been found. The complete series is lost to the
nation and for that reason it is not available on video.  
                
                 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
What a fab issue...So poor old Alexei Sayle got a vote as most disliked...I
rather like him...I'll never forget this one episode of his series "STUFF"
when this kid dressed as a policeman comes up to him and asks to see his
"fat license"! 

"Bottom" sounds brilliant - not yet (or ever, probably) seen on South
African tellies. Aaaarrgh! I looooooove Rik and Ade (especially Rik. God,
Rik I love you and want to have your babies). I liked the bit about Ben
Elton, and this gave the name of my all-time fave series: "Filthy, Rich and
Catflap" (Rik and Ade again).

About "One More Bean Makes a Very Small Casserole" ("Newsquirks", vol.1 no.
6): Without sounding too smug, I would like to point out that this episode
was aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) quite a while ago
(early 1994, if my rapidly deteriorating memory serves me). In fact the
episode was shown at least twice, once on the English CBC and once on the
French CBC (Radio Canada) with subtitles for when the art teacher is
talking. In addition to the scenes mentioned in your article, there are a
few very funny ones in the art class involving a nude model. As with what
you mentioned in the article, I'll leave it to your imagination.

                 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
The Ben Elton article ("Ben Elton-A Career in Review," vol.1, no. 7) really
down-played the stand-up comedy aspect of Ben Elton. Stand-up had almost
been abandoned for any radical comedy. All radical comedy had become
sketches, like Python and the Goodies, or sitcoms, like "Hitchhiker's
[Guide to the Galaxy]" and "Fawlty [Towers]". Ben Elton and his
contempories launched a brand-new form of stand-up comedy that [became
known as] "alternative comedy". Left-wing, anti-Tory, reactionary against
centuries of stand-up comedy, Ben Elton has become an icon with phrases
like "little bits of politics there ladies and gentlemen". [He] brought
many topics onto the political agenda, racism, sexism, environmentalism...
his contribution to modern British culture is great and his legacy will
remain.

                              Rich Johnston - Newcastle, U.K.

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: Elton's contribution to stand-up comedy is unquestionably
important; however, the article was only meant to focus on a few aspects of
Elton's career.
                 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I live in a cultural desert called Los Angeles, and one of my few
entertainment pleasures is watching British comedies on A&E, Comedy
Central, or buying/hiring videotapes of my favourite shows. (Blackadder
I-IV, Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served?, Morecambe & Wise, Red Dwarf,
Monty Python, AbFab, etc)...I would greatly appreciate any information on
books for any of these shows, and how to get them. The only books I can
find here from the U.K. are the latest scandal-mongering on the Royal
Family!

                              Vivien Latham - Los Angeles, CA

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: Many readers have requested information on Britcom books.
As a result, I am including selections from the very first version of
"Books for the Avid Britcomedy Fan" in this issue of Britcomedy Digest.
Feedback is appreciated.

Ode to Rimmer:
Dear Chris Barrie
I'd like to marrie
you!

On a matter of great importance: I detect from your [usenet] signature a
cunning clue or two that you may be a Chris Barrie addict. Well, that makes
four so far: me, in South Africa, a girl in Australia, another in the
states, and now you--maybe! Honestly, I'm such a sad git over this I even
argue that "Rimmer" [who Barrie plays] is fanciable...well, hey, who
wouldn't have *died* for the devotion he showed in "Thanks for the Memory"?
We've got a thingy: the "Chris Barrie Is A Sex God" thingy. Care to join? 
All you have to do is come out of that Chris Barrie closet and confess!
It's extremely amusing and a really good wind-up, 'cos none of the blokes
on-line can understand it.
                              Name withheld by request         

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: Let's put it this way: Barrie can use that "Wormdo" line
on me anytime...the reader can draw her own conclusions.

ABFAB AND RED DWARF SHARE INTERNATIONAL EMMY

On November 22, in a Manhattan hotel, television producers, writers, and 
stars gathered for the 1994 International Emmy Awards. At the end of the 
ceremony, the BBC had walked away with five--more than any broadcaster 
had won in a single year.

Absolutely Fabulous won for the second year in a row, sharing its 
International Emmy in the Popular Arts category with Red Dwarf. The 
AbFab episode nominated was "Hospital"; the Red Dwarf espisode was 
"Gunmen of the Apocalypse," from season six.

Other winners were David Jason (star of "Only Fools and Horses"), who won
best drama prize for his Screen One BBC film, "The Bullion Boys"; Sir David
Attenborough's "Life In the Freezer" (documentary); and a puppet version of
"Peter and the Wolf" narrated by rock star Sting, which won a performing
arts prize for Britain.

Australia and France were the only two other countries to win 
international prizes.

The International Emmys are awarded by the International Council of the 
National Academy of TV Arts & Sciences.

"JOKING APART" TO PLAY IN THE STATES, UK

The second series of "Joking Apart" will air in the U.K. January 3rd, 1995.
Amazingly, it will air in the U.S. and Spain before it airs in the U.K.

Those in the states will be able to enjoy this Moffat series if they receive
one of the following PBS stations: KRMA (Denver, CO); KPBS (San Diego, CA);
KUSM (Bozeman, Montana); WNED (Buffalo, NY); KCTS (Setattle, WA); KVIE
(Sacramento, CA); WPBT (Miami, FL); WCBB  (MN); WLIW (Plainview, NY); KTEH
(San Jose, CA).

Steven Moffat ("The Press Gang") told Britcomedy Digest that he is writing
an episode of "Murder Most Horrid," has a comedy/drama called "Privates" in
the works, and a sitcom ("Rosie Futures") under serious consideration.

SPIKE MILLIGAN TAKES A SHOT AT PRINCE CHARLES

Spike Milligan recently received a British Comedy Award for Lifetime
Achievement. But he made millions of TV viewers remember his caustic tongue
and sharp sense of humor at the awards ceremony when he called the Prince
of Wales a "grovelling little bastard."

Jonathan Ross was reading a letter from the Prince and had only gotten a few
lines out when Spike broke in with his infamous ad-lib. "He's a groveling
little bastard." Ross was startled, but recovered and continued to read
just one more line from the Prince's page-long letter.

The line which provoked this humorous ad-lib from Spike was: "As someone 
who has grown up listening to the Goons on steam-driven radio, I must 
confess I am a lifelong fan of Spike Milligan." 

Later Spike confirmed that it was impromptu and that he was "just 
desperate to say something," perhaps out of embarrasment from all the 
adulation he was receiving.

After the awards ceremony Spike explained, "He will understand. He's a 
lovely man. He has a good sense of humor." When it was pointed out that 
viewers had (predictably) complained, Spike reportedly said "fuck 'em".

His wife Sheila commented, "The person who will laugh most at Spike's joke
will be Prince Charles. Spike has never been a sycophant. He's one of the
few people who can get away with it."

RED DWARF'S SMEG UPS -- THE TITLE OF THE TAPE OR A WARNING TO THE BUYER?
by Martin Eade <martine@cougar.multiline.com.au>

Whilst Craig Charles awaits trial the BBC obviously thought it necessary to
remind the public about the existence of "Red Dwarf". Hence, the new "smeg
ups" tape, described on the box as "Red Dwarf as you've never seen it
before - almost an hour of side-splitting outtakes." Sound promising? Well,
the title of this video may be more apt than they realise.

The idea behind this video is simple: it's a collection of bloopers, jokes,
funny bits and the like from the history of Red Dwarf. It features some
genuinely funny moments, from forgotten lines to misbehaving models. Chris
Barrie does several impersonations of Kenneth Williams that are a bit too
accurate for comfort, even down to the flaring of his nostrils. (An
interesting omission is the lack of bloopers from either incarnation of
"Holly".)

We are guided through this collection by "Kryten" (Robert Lewellyn), who
delivers rather frequent, rather painful dialogue. He rarely says anything
of relevance and is there purely to pad out the tape. Even with his
interludes the tape runs only 51 minutes - even Terry Wogan wasn't this
bad.

The definite lowlight is Kryten's "Top ten most asked questions about Red 
Dwarf". After the few obligatory "Why did Lister have his appendix out 
twice" type of questions comes "Where can I buy Red Dwarf merchandise and 
what is available." Oh dear. We find out, unfortunately. (Visa and Access 
welcome!) What was the BBC thinking? Surely they realise that if you've 
bought this video you're going to know about merchandise?

The video ends with the unshown ending to Series 6 - the one that for some
bizarre reason they didn't transmit the first time around. Another smeg-up,
it seems. The only item to be considered newsworthy is the competition to
appear as an extra in Red Dwarv VII (open to anyone over the age of 18
months and under 106 years). So what are they going to do if Craig goes to
jail?

After the obligatory screenings to friends and family I have now watched
this video three times and that's more than enough. It's definitely worth
seeing once but it doesn't have enough sparkle to permit repeated viewing.
This programme would have better served the BBC as a Christmas special - it
would have rated highly and the merchandising plug would be a bit more
relevant. As it stands this is a rather pathetic release which, hopefully,
even the ardent Dwarfers will boycott. The general public certainly aren't
going to buy it.

Verdict: Do not buy it unless you're desperate - borrow a friend's copy or
let someone else buy it for you.

ROY CLARKE, by Simon Collings <scollin@sapphire.win-uk.net>

There has scarcely been a single week on British television without a comedy
by Roy Clarke being shown. Not in living memory (well mine anyway). What is
it about this man's comedy that is so appealing and why have his shows
endured?

Just look at the sitcoms Roy Clarke has created for us: Keeping Up
Appearances (1990-93), Ain't Misbehavin' (1994), Open All Hours (1976-85),
Last Of The Summer Wine (1973-93), First Of The Summer Wine (1988-89),
Don't Tell Father (1992), Potter (1979-84), The Growing Pains Of PC Penrose
(1975), Rosie (1977-81), The Clairvoyant (1986), The Magnificent Evans
(1984), The Misfit (1970-71).

Some are obscure, some lasted for just one series, but there are more
blockbusters here than many writers have managed.

OK, so Roy Clarke is a master at creating comic obsessive characters
(Hyacinth, Arkwright, Foggy Dewhurst), but there is something else there
which singles him out - YORKSHIRE!

In Roy Clarke's world, Yorkshire is a land where all the men are wimps and
the women are hard taskmasters. It is the world of the hovis loaf, black
shag, pidgeon fancying and low horizons. "Last of the Summer Wine" and
"Open All Hours" have endured and endured, yet neither has had a plot in
living memory - just three old men wandering about the coutryside and the
antics of a frustrated shopkeeper.

Decades of the same gentle comedy has become a part of Sunday evening in the
UK. Roy Clarke almost has his own slot in the BBC schedule on Sunday
evening. Other channels have tried to compete and always failed. He is part
of television life here.

But what of the future? Many of the cast of "Last of the Summer Wine" are
getting old and new series are fewer and further between; Ronnie Barker
retired from acting many years; David Jason is too busy and successful at
drama to make comedy anymore. Never fear! Roy Clarke is creating new comedy
all the time. "Ain't Misbehavin'" and "Keeping up Appearances" continue the
winning formula. I have a feeling we will be seeing new comedy by Roy
Clarke for a long time to come.

Review:  _The Man in the Rubber Mask_
         Robert Llewellyn
--------------------------------------by Trace Webster

Prospective readers of Robert Llewellyn's _The Man in the Rubber Mask_
will be pleased to know that the author *does* talk about things other
than the rubber mask itself!

While _The Man in the Rubber Mask_ is an autobiography, it deals mainly with
Robert Llewellyn's role as Kryten in the British television comedy "Red
Dwarf": the early interviews, casting, and the trials and tribulations of
the wearing of the rubber masks--although he includes some stories about
his life before "Red Dwarf", including one anecdote of <ahem> an earlier,
not so ego-boosting, encounter with plaster of Paris and wax. Llewellyn
maintains his privacy in the book, however, only mentioning friends and
relatives when they're relevant to "Red Dwarf."

Among the tidbits I found in _Rubber Mask_ were:

  o How he occupied his thoughts with kinky sex while undergoing mask
    fittings;
  o How Craig Charles' and Danny John-Jules' nocturnal habits made him
    feel like an old man;
  o How useless he felt while learning long speeches compared to Chris
    Barrie and Craig Charles;
  o How hot and uncomfortable it was inside the costume and the mask.

Llewellyn relates a number of anecdotes testifying to his fellow actors'
personalities, although none of them are in any way actionable; that is,
unless Craig Charles chose to sic his lawyer on Llewellyn for mentioning
the dimensions of certain body organs, or Chris Barrie decided to sue for
enough money to buy his third Bentley over the description of his
preferences in night-time activity (retire at ten o'clock with a cup of
cocoa and...well, read the book! :)

While much of the behind-the-scenes gossip is old news to regular readers of
the "Smegazine", it was all new to me as a fairly recent convert, and I was
amused to read about Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules' nightclubbing (or
rather, their departure to and return from nightclubbing), Chris Barrie's
impressions of everyone who stood still for long enough (how could I *ever*
have guessed?) and the general antics on the set.

Also mentioned is the making of the U.S. "Red Dwarf" pilot, and much is made
of the contrast between the backstage atmosphere of the British and
American productions and the different reactions of the American and
Liverpudlian Craigs (Bierko and Charles) to it.

Being Australian, it was interesting to hear that Judy Pascoe, who played
the mechanoid "Camille" and is Llewellyn's girlfriend and the mother of his
child, is also Australian. Llewellyn also describes his trips to Australia
and his meeting with the Northern Territories' biggest "Red Dwarf" fan.
(This was when ABC was showing it on Sunday afternoon, folks.)

There are eight pages of black and white photographs, which include the
author's previous roles and his Edinburgh Festival friends, some glimpses
behind the scenes on the "Red Dwarf" set (including one of Chris Barrie
looking particularly bright and alert), and the obligatory shot of
Llewellyn with an incontinent koala--not that the incontinence showed up on
film, but we're assured that it happened.

As a "Red Dwarf" fan, I found this book to be an entertaining read, and
quite well written. However, I suspect it would be less interesting to
anyone who is not an "Dwarfer", or at least a fan of any of the actors.

_The Man in the Rubber Mask_, copyright 1994 by Robert Llewellyn, is
published by Penguin Books, ISBN 0-14-023575-2. The price is #4.99 in the
U.K., $12,95 in Australia, and $5.99 in Canada. It runs about $12.00 in the
U.S. Robert Llewellyn has also written _The Reconstructed Heart_ (1992).

"Stand-up to Be Shot Down", by Simon Fanshawe

In America, there are about 15,000 working comedians - a terrifying thought.
Not all of them are funny but they all think they are - an even more
terrifying thought.

In Britain, I reckon there are about 500; more men than women, more in
London than in the rest of the country and more scoring below three out of
ten on the scale of hilarity than above. There are always those who forget
that to make the transition from 'good joke-teller down at the local' to
moving an audience to merriment is talent and not simply a question of
egging on a few drunken mates.

The comedy boom in London started in 1979 at the Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle
launched the first of many tirades against the powers-that-should-not-be
and by doing so gave birth to the Comic Strip (French and Saunders, the
Young Ones, Ben Elton). In 1979 there were at least ten pubs in London in
the upstairs rooms of which you could find a comedy gig at the weekend.

Nowadays the London listings magazine Time Out can devote entire issues to
comedy, previewing the autumn's TV comedy schedules, live tours and listing
some 82 clubs where comedy is now a regular component. Most of them are
one-nighters but about 15 run at least two shows a week.

At the head of the line-up are two clubs who do not just make comedy their
business but make business out of their comedy; the Comedy Store and
Jongleurs, which operates out of three clubs, one south of the Thames in
Battersea, another at trendy Camden Lock to the north and the most recent
at the Filling Station at Shepherds Bush to the west.

These clubs vary tremendously. We no longer throw Christians to the lions
but we do throw comics to the audience at the last show on Friday at the
Comedy Store. The tradition was established long ago with the Gong Show
where, if you had not experienced bullying and rejection at school, you
could become a comic and catch up. If you did not please the audience they
shouted 'gong, gong, gong...', the compere hit the gong and you had to
leave the stage.

Comedy audiences are better trained these days. They are prepared to give
the acts more of a chance. They come less for the sport of shouting them
down than having the most laughs they can for the ticket price.

Early in the week you will find small pub gigs where a wide variety of
comics take the stage, from those who are so inexperienced they have the
look of a 12-year-old forced into the ring without gloves against Chris
Eubank, to some of the established names trying out new material. Not
everyone has their own TV series so most comics make their own TV series so
most comics make their living from working live. While the better money is
to be made out on the Student Union circuit, pay at the London clubs is all
right. There is plenty of quality out there.

It has been an orthodoxy, when writing about so-called 'alternative' comedy,
to argue that in the good old days of revolution at the Comedy Store,
satirists took great militant lunges at an establishment whose destruction
they willed on with their every punchline. The truth was less dramatic.
Although the new generation of comics was inevitably drawn from those who
felt little affinity towards the Thatcher government, there were many
different comic voices emerging.

Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall, French and Saunders developed their anarchic
views of the world. Ben Elton emerged for some as definitive footstamper of
the era but his humour is far less political than based on the British
comedy staple of potties, botties and, of course, sex.

While some complain about the lack of direct political comment at the
moment, sex and sexual relationships are - and in my view always will be -
the dominant comic currency. The club scene in London reflects this. You
will not be able to spend more than ten minutes of an evening without sex,
some explicit, some coy but all of it funny and most of it wonderfully
truthful.

The two most expensive clubs in the capital are Jongleurs and the Comedy
Store. But for 9 pounds you will get tow hours of the best of young comedy
in London, possibly a smattering of new TV names and even the occasional
appearance of a major celebrity guest (I have been there when Robin
Williams has dropped in). Jongleurs has better food and you will see the
same comics at both clubs; Jongleurs in Camden is purpose-built and as a
result very comfortable.

It is impossible to distinguish between all the one- nighters. Your best bet
is probably to go local. If you are north of the Thames try the Red Rose
Club in Finsbury Park, The King's Head in Crouch End, the Meccano Club in
Islington; if you are south give the Banana Cabaret a try in Balham or
Screaming Blue Murder at Hampton Court, Wimbledon or Carshalton. For bigger
shows, the Hackney Empire has re-invented the variety tradition and mixes
comics with specialty acts and music, always to great effect; even some
West End theatres - especially the Criterion and the Queen's - are doing
more and more one-offs.

Your best guide to all this is undoubtedly a combination of Time Out and
sucking it and seeing. Frankly, take the risk because only you can judge.
If you laughed you liked them; if you did not, they stunk. So get out there
and see. Who knows, you might end up doing an open spot.

Peter Cook and Dudley Moore: Grand Old Men Of Comedy
by James Kew <j.kew@ic.ac.uk>
====================================================
(Part two of a three part article)

NOT ONLY...BUT ALSO...

On his return from the American run of "Beyond The Fringe", Peter Cook
was invited to appear in Bernard Braden's series, "On The Braden Beat",
where he performed twenty or some monologues, further developing the
character he had introduced in "Beyond The Fringe", and giving him a
name: E. L. Wisty. The pieces were usually improvised to tape the day
before filming; Cook would then read them from autocue, staring straight
at the audience, eyes glazed and unsmiling, seemingly impervious to the
audience's laughter. Wisty would hold forth in his droning monotone on
the subject of the week, rambling aimlessly, filling in the yawning gaps
in his knowledge with totally spurious "facts".

Cook:  I've always wanted to be an expert on tadpoles. I've always
       fancied being a tadpole expert. It's a wonderful life if you
       become an expertii tadpolius, as they're known in the trade. You
       get invited out to all the smart parties and social gatherings.
       When smart people are making out their lists for the dinner
       parties  they say, "Now who can we have to make up the ten? A
       tadpole expert would be very nice, he can sit next to Lady Sonia."
       And at all the smart functions people come up to you and say, "I
       hear you're a tadpole expert. Tell me, what are tadpoles really
       like?" And lovely ladies invite you back to their flat and say,
       "You know, I'm longing to hear about your tadpoles. Hang on a
       minute while I slip into a gossamer trenchcoat."

The BBC asked Dudley Moore to do in a one-off television show, "Offbeat". He
invited Cook to join him, and Cook wrote two sketches, one featuring two
cloth-capped buffoons discussing their imaginary liaisons with various film
stars (Dud and Pete), and one about an upper-class twit (Sir Arthur
Streeb-Greebling) who has spent the last forty years attempting to teach
ravens to fly underwater.

Moore:  How do you manage to breathe underwater?
Cook:   Oh, that's completely impossible, nobody can breathe underwater.
        That's what makes it so difficult. I have to keep bobbing to the
        surface every thirty seconds. Makes it impossible to conduct a
        sustained training programme on the ravens. And they're no
        better, they can't even be taught to hold their beaks. Horrible
        little animals. There they are, sitting on me wrist, I say, "Fly,
        fly, you devils!" and they inhale a faceful of water and, er...
Moore:  I suppose they drown, don't they?
Cook:   It's curtains, yes. They drown, and, er, topple off me wrist.
        Little black feathery figure topples off me wrist, spirals very
        slowly down to a watery grave. We're knee-deep in feathers off
        that part of the coast.

The BBC were very pleased with the result, and Cook and Moore were
offered their own programme, "Not Only...But Also...", which ran for
three series in 1965, 66 and 70--the last series being made in colour.
Much of the archive material has been lost or destroyed by the BBC, but
sufficient footage was found and restored to make up 6 compilation
episodes, which were transmitted in 1990.

"Not Only...But Also..." featured Cook and Moore's most enduring
characters: the fumbling cloth-capped idiots Dud and Pete. Cook: "Pete
is the informed idiot, and Dud is the uninformed idiot. They're both
idiots, but Pete is always slightly superior. In fact, he knows nothing
either." They appeared in numerous sketches, ruminating about life in
general. The sketches were surprisingly long for the period, often
running to eight or ten minutes, and have an improvised feel. Peter
Cook: "We didn't have scripts as such, we had a lot of headings--we'd
rehearsed a lot, and we knew roughly what we were going to say, but not
word-for-word." In one sketch, Dud and Pete meet in an art gallery:

Dud:   Here, have a sandwich. My feet are killing me.
Pete:  What's that got to do with the sandwich?
Dud:   Nothing, I just said it afterwards, that's all.
Pete:  Well, you shouldn't say things like that together, it could
       confuse a stupid person.

They go on to discuss famous duck paintings:

Pete:  If you look at his ducks, you see the eyes follow you around the
       room.
Dud:   You noticed that?
Pete:  Yer, when you see sixteen of his ducks, you see thirty-two little
       eyes follow you round the room.
Dud:   No, you only see sixteen because they're flying sideways and you
       can't see the other eye on the other side. He never does a frontal
       duck.
Pete:  No, but you get the impression, Dud, that the other eye is craning
       round the beak to look at you, don't you. That's a sign of a good
       painting, Dud.

This leads to an examination of Cezanne's "Les Grandes Baigneuses":

Pete:  The sign of a good painting when its people's backs towards you is
       if the bottoms follow you around the room.
Dud:   If it's a good painting the bottoms will follow you around the
       room?
Pete:  Right.
Dud:   Shall I test it then?
Pete:  They won't bloody budge, I'll tell you that much.
Dud:   I can't look directly at the painting or else they'll know I'm
       looking and get all cagey.
Pete:  Are they moving, Dud?
Dud:   I think they're following me, Pete.
Pete:  I don't think they are, Dud.
Dud:   I reckon they are, Pete.
Pete:  No, those bottoms aren't following you around the room, your eyes
       are following the bottoms around the room.
Dud:   The same thing, isn't it?
Pete:  Course it isn't. There's a world of difference between being
       followed by a bottom and you following a bottom.

Other memorable sketches include "SuperThunderStingCar", a viciously
well-observed spoof of Gerry Anderson's puppet series, "Thunderbirds";
"The Glid Of Glood", an odd fairy-tale told entirely in rhyming verse;
and "Bargo", a documentary on the reclusive Finnish star Emma Bargo,
played by a surprisingly convincing Peter Cook.

The shows had a musical interlude, provided by the Dudley Moore Trio,
Moore's jazz band, with a special guest each week. The show ended with
Cook and Moore singing "Goodbye-ee" in a very affected twenties fashion,
which became their signature tune and was a minor hit when released as a
single.

A series of three hour-long programmes, "Goodbye Again", was produced
for ITV in 1968. They were intended for the American market, and
featured a guest American comedian each episode; however, they failed to
live up to the quality of "Not Only... But Also...", due in part to
dissatisfaction with the hour-long format and a personality clash with
the director.

Peter Cook returned to television in 1971, when the BBC asked him to
front a chat show, "Where Do I Sit?" It was, by all accounts, an
unmitigated disaster. Cook, unsure of his ability to handle such a show,
asked for a pilot, but the BBC pressed ahead with a series of thirteen.
They were slightly worried by his insistence on making the shows live;
Cook says, looking back: "I said people will enjoy disasters if they
happen. And sure enough, disasters did happen. I found out on that first
programme that I was no good at talking to people on television." The
shows got good viewing figures, but disastrous reviews in the papers,
and the BBC cancelled the series after three shows.

In the summer of 1971 Cook and Moore went to Australia to make two TV
shows for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, shown in Britain as
"Pete And Dud Down Under". They also compiled a new stage show, "Behind
The Fridge", which ran successfully in Australia before opening in
London in October 1972. The show went to America under the title "Good
Evening", running on Broadway for a year and subsequently touring.

-----------------------
"I worked with Julia on 43 Press Gangs over a period of 5 years and found
her not only to be an immensely talented actress, but one of the most

                                ==========

It happens at least once a week on my favourite newsgroups: someone without
access to FTP posts a request asking someone else to mail them a file.
Well, help is at hand: there are a number of handy services on the net
that offer ftp-by-email. It's convenient and easy--just send a request
to a mail server and wait for it to send you back the file. You can even
tell the server to split the document into chunks, if your email software
or service provider imposes a size limit on messages. Here's how.

Say you want to fetch the last issue of Britcomedy Digest. Well, as this
issue tells you, one of the places to find back-issues is

  ftp://cathouse.org/pub/cathouse/humor/british.humour/britcomedy.digest/

This URL means "ftp to the site cathouse.org and look in the directory
/pub/cathouse/humor/british.humour/britcomedy.digest". So, let's have a
look. Pick one of these ftp-by-mail servers to work with:

[Germany]  ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de
[France]   ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr
[UK]       ftpmail@doc.ic.ac.uk
[USA]      ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu

They all work the same way; choose one that's either close to you or close
to the site you want to access. To get a listing of this directory, send
an email message to the server with the following lines in the body of the
message:

open cathouse.org
cd pub/cathouse/humor/british.humour/britcomedy.digest
dir
quit

The server will reply acknowledging your request and will tell you how many
jobs are queued ahead of yours. This number may be large; for the busiest
servers, it's not uncommon to have several hundred jobs in the queue.
Don't worry, most jobs are small and quick and even with hundreds of jobs
ahead of you, your jobs should get processed within a few hours. Once you
reach the front of the queue the server processes your commands and sends
back a completion notice and, in separate messages, the results of the
commands--in this case, the directory listing:

total 276
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other        684 Dec 15 15:41 .cache
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other       1608 Dec 14 22:06 .cache+
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other      20352 Jul 13 16:21 britcomedy.digest.1-1
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other      40085 Jul 25 18:40 britcomedy.digest.1-2
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other      46063 Aug 18 20:36 britcomedy.digest.1-3
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other      48931 Sep 19 16:22 britcomedy.digest.1-4
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other      67184 Nov  4 20:14 britcomedy.digest.1-5
-rw-r--r--  1 jrh      other      54694 Nov 29 14:19 britcomedy.digest.1-6

Okay, there's last month's issue, "britcomedy.digest.1-6". Now to fetch it.
Send these commands:

open cathouse.org
cd pub/cathouse/humor/british.humour/britcomedy.digest
get britcomedy.digest.1-6
quit

As before, you'll receive an acknowledgement and, in due course, the server
will mail you the file. If you're email is limited in the size of file you
can receive, include a line before the "get" command telling the server
when to split files into sections: "size 20K" sets the maximum message size
to 20K. There are other instructions you can give the server, such as
telling it to compress files before sending them, or instructing it how to
encode binary files. To find out more, send the server this message:

help
quit

A number of other servers also offer ftp-by-mail services. These use a
different set of instructions to the ones listed above. To find out how to
use a server, send it email with the line "help" in the body of the
message.

[USA]        ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
[Australia]  ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au
[Ireland]    ftpmail@ieunet.ie

Finally, remember that like the ftp sites themselves, these ftp-by-mail
services are provided by institutions out of the kindness of their hearts
as a service to the net community--have fun, but try not to overload them
with frivolous or duplicate requests.
