Puttin' on the Ritz -- 
The Performance of the Presenters
At the 1995 British Comedy Awards
=================================
This year, the British Comedy Awards chose for its theme, "The Glories of
Ancient Rome." Or, as host Jonathan Ross put it, "The glories of Ancient
Wome." (He was later to receive some feeble ribbing from MP John Redwood, to
which he retorted, "That was a wancourous thing to say, sir!")

Really, the theme should have been "Hollywood in the UK." Not only did the
show resemble the Oscars more this year in its presentation and feel, but
the stars were out in full force. Lauren Hutton gave the award for "Top
Channel 4 Entertainment Presenter," and Liza Minnelli pleased the audience
by singing a tribute to Bruce Forsythe, who won the "Lifetime Achievement in
Variety" award.

Other comedy greats honored were Peter Cook, whose posthumous award
acceptance speech was given via satellite by Dudley Moore; and Bob
Monkhouse, who was this year's recipient of "The Lifetime Achievement
Award." And the long-standing "I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue" won for "Best
Radio Comedy."

WOSS GWEAT HOST

If you could get beyond the speech impediment, the sexy Jonathan Ross did a
marvelous job of moving the show along and quickly dispatching
guest-presenters who intentionally gave him a hard time (e.g. Freddie Star).

He couldn't rein in Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, though: they upstaged and
distracted poor Martin Clunes, who won the first award that night, for "Top
Television Comedy Actor." Eventually, Martin had to cut his speech short due
to Reeves' and Mortimer's lack of decorum (and who is surprised? next time,
just invite the blonde).

Speaking of lack of decorum, Michael Barrymore brought down the house by
literally hanging around with Jonathan Ross after he had collected the "Best
ITV Entertainment Presenter" award. In no time at all, he'd climbed a Roman
column and unplugged Jonathan Ross's auto-cue machine, at which point the
program cut to commercials. Once back, Barrymore quickly disappeared into
the audience upon hearing that Freddie Star was the next presenter.

Angus Deayton presented the Writer's Guild Award for "Top Television Comedy
Writer" (which went jointly to Guy Jenkin and Andy Hamilton) in one of the
most memorable short speeches of the night. Well ... I couldn't give you any
definite quotes, but it *was* very funny. Really.

When Noel Edmonds was announced as the winner of the "Top BBC Entertainment
Presenter," there was an audible "awww" of disappointment from the audience.
It was the second year in a row he had won the prize, and he was up against
favorites Frank Skinner and Jim Davidson. Luckily, no Mr. Blobby this year.

SAYING IT WITH STYLE

The most interesting aspect of the ceremony was a chance to see what kind of
acceptance speech the comedians would give. Spontaneous? Pompous?
Blubbering? Alas, no one cried that night ... well, at least Hollywood still
has one more trick to teach the UK... :)

Britcomedy Digest gives the "I'm a Real Person" medal to twice-nominated Jo
Brand who, after winning "Best Stand-Up Comedy," delivered a raspberry to
all those who didn't support her when she was struggling. The other award
she was nominated for, "Best Female Comedy Performer," went to Victoria Wood
for "Live in Your Own Home."

Jack Dee seemed downright disgusted as he gave his surly acceptance speech
for "Top TV Personality." That perfect scowl he wore was no doubt what
earned him the award in the first place... And Carolyn Quinton got a laugh
when, after accepting the award for "Best Television Comedy Actress," she
said, "I feel badly, because I didn't get you anything."

SOLEMN MOMENT QUICKLY DISSIPATED

The most solemn moment of the night occurred when Archbishop Desmond Tutu
was announced as the presenter for "Best Television Comedy/Drama."
The applause that followed was the longest of the night, as audience members
were reminded of pressing world issues that, perhaps, put the comedy awards
in *too much* perspective for a moment. However, the threat of the
atmosphere becoming sober was quelled by Jonathan Ross, who added some
levity by questioning whether one is supposed to address an archbishop as
"my Grace" or "Your Grace." (It's "Your Grace," just in case you didn't know.)

                                   ###
