This issue is a bit of a Merton-fest: we've got a review of his book, "My
Struggle," and his latest series, "Paul Merton In..." And for fans of his
wife, there's an article on Caroline Quentin and her fellow "Men Behaving
Badly" stars.

I took a break from writing "BD Recommends" this month; I'm far too caught
up in the _joy_ of driving lessons, hoping to pass before the dreaded
written exam requirement comes into effect this summer (residents of the
UK will know what I'm talking about here). I'm proud to say that the guest
reviewers have done an excellent job, with reviews on Paul Merton's new
series and book, Simon Gray's book on the "Cell Mates" fiasco, and "The
Best of The Bonzo Dog Band" CD.

On an administrative note, I'd like to warn readers that the web version of
BD will soon be moving from the cathouse.org site. But don't worry, I'll
post a pointer on alt.comedy.british and rec.arts.tv.uk.comedy when that
happens, as well as make an announcement on the mailing list. So get ready
to update those bookmark files...

Speaking of the web version, this issue inaugurates a new look for BD. Do
visit the cathouse.org site and let me know what you think -- what you
like, dislike (if anything! :), and why. All comments are greatly
appreciated. The url is: http://www.cathouse.org/BritishComedy/BD/.

Well, I've got to go -- I've an appointment with my Highway Code book,
which, unfortunately, reads as if it were written by Gordon Brittas!

Enjoy this issue.

I was completely thrilled to see the tribute to Women in British Comedy
(and equally thrilled to see that you included Emma Thompson), but how
could you forget Connie Booth? The co-creator of "Fawlty Towers" and Monty
Python's "Fairy Tale" sketch deserves some mention. Even though she's
American, she is still Brit-by-association in more ways than one. Still,
though; everything else I have ever read in the magazine I have loved.
Keep up the good work!

The "Women in Comedy" issue was fabulous! Loved the "French & Saunders
FAQ." But don't agree with Sideways Thumb for "Chef" because I think Lenny
Henry is brilliant in it (haven't seen him in anything but "Bernard & The
Genie").

Don't forget those "Brittas" women Harriet Thorpe, Pippa Haywood and Julia
St. John. I don't know if they're that well known in England but I enjoy
'em.

Hi Melinda,

Being a silly bugger I accidentally deleted my copy of the
November/December issue of Britcomedy Digest. Is there an ftp site for it?
If so, has it got back issues too, because I'd like to read more. It's not
often you find something this interesting and useful on Usenet!

Tony Slattery is one of the funniest men in Britain, yet I can never seem
to find out much about him. Certainly he is popular enough to warrant
people's attention. Can anybody out there help me out? I know I'm not his
only fan...

review, please email the editor at <bd@badger.idiscover.co.uk>.

I had a look at your newsletter on Usenet and it's pretty cool. It may open
up some new venues to me. I have been a long-time fan of Monty Python (any
thing having to do with), "Are You Being Served?" and just recently began
to check out "Ab Fab." I can see from your newsletter my taste could be
expanded quite a bit. We here in the US are somewhat limited -- we
basically have to count on PBS and some cable companies [for British
comedies]. It's pretty filtered...

Dear Melinda,

I have gotten the most recent issue of Britcomedy Digest and have received
part 2 *before* part 1. I discover this *after* I have read part 2. This
is horrible! It's like I have to go back in time... Then (this is the
worst part) *after* part 1, I find part 3! I just got used to part 1. This
is just too awful! So here's a suggestion, make issue #2, #1 and make #1,
#2 and keep #3 the way it is.

                               Thank You
                               Phil Satterley, atv@mcs.net
                               c/o Dr. Erikson, ward #3

PS. Oh, almost forgot why I'm writing. Any chance of doing an article on
early 60s comedy shows "lost" by the BBC and other companies?

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: This happened to a lot of people, unfortunately. I did
mail in the correct sequence, but depending on which route the email
takes, it could get to you out of order. The best remedy seems to be
waiting about twenty minutes after mailing the first part. As far as
covering early comedy shows, I'm all for it if readers show interest.

            - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Love your Digest! As a Cliff Richard fan from way back, I can confirm that
your article was right in saying that Cliff became a Christian in 1965
(see Vol.2, No.1)... I love British telly. Keep up the great work!

Dear Melinda 'Bob',

Do you know where we can find any more information about David Jason, the
man who played "Pop Larkin" in "The Darling Buds of May"? I know I've seen
him before in other productions but can't place him...

                               Michael Murray, michael@mentus.com

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: This issue holds a mini-bio on David Jason. Fans of
"Buds" will be glad to know that Jason has reunited with co-stars Pam
Ferris and Kika Mirylees for the last of the Larkin family stories.

12 MONKEYS RELEASED IN AMERICA

Terry Gilliam's new movie, "12 Monkeys," has opened in the States to good
reviews and tremendous box office earnings.

This time travel sci-fi adventure, starring Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and
Madeline Stowe, has earned close to $40,000,000 since its release and
spent several weeks in the number one box office position before being
replaced by the new Quentin Tarrantino/George Clooney vampire flick "From
Dusk To Dawn." Audiences have apparently been drawn in by the film's
complex plot and strong performances by Willis and Pitt. Pitt was given
the Golden Globe Award for his performance as a mental patient.

EMMA THOMPSON COMES AWAY A WINNER

At the Golden Globes, held on January 21 in Los Angeles, Emma Thompson
came away with two big awards for her film version of "Sense and
Sensibility." Thompson herself received "Best Screen Play" for her
adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, while the film was named "Best Movie"
in the drama category.

The triumph is an end product of at least five years of work which
Thompson put into the project, which also stars Hugh Grant and Kate
Winslett. When the Academy Award nominations are announced on February 13,
there is little doubt that Thompson's name and movie will once again will
be on the list.

MR. FLIBBLE, LEMMY, AND MORE!

If you find yourself looking into your fridge and telling your mate that
lunch "looks something like... a roast chicken" then the AOL Red Dwarf
mailing list is for you. The group has been going since last summer and
boasts over 100 members. But there's more than just random quoting going
on with this group...

Join the list and you can become an adoptive parent to the list's mascot,
"Lemmy" -- Rimmer's pet lemming. Not only that, but you get a penguin
eraser which bears a resemblance to a certain "Mr. Flibble." You will then
enter the respected league of penguin-carrying members of the AOL RD
mailing list.

For more information on the list, which includes online chats and episode
discussions, send email to <Holly5120@aol.com>.

TRACEY ULLMAN BACK ON HBO

For those of you who wonder what Tracey Ullman has been up to, check out
her new *skitcom* (don't you just love that word?) "Tracey Takes On..." In
this new series Tracey will do her usual "disappearing" act by creating
more than 20 characters over the course of the series.

Tracey fans can also check out reruns of her previous show "The Tracey
Ullman Show" on Comedy Central, the show that also launched "The
Simpsons."

"Tracey Takes On..." airs on HBO in late January.

HYACINTH KICKS THE BUCKET... er, "BOUQUET"

Patricia Routledge, star of "Keeping Up Appearances," has announced that
the character of Hyacinth Bucket is to be killed off so she can
concentrate on the role of Hettie Winthrop in the television murder
mystery "Hettie Winthrop Investigates."

Routledge said in a recent interview that she was receiving death threats
if the character was not killed off, and had to have one of her two phone
lines (would that be a slim-line?) disconnected as a result.

FRY SETTLES OUT OF COURT

Stephen Fry's walk out of the play "Cell Mates" last June inevitably
provoked a legal wrangle between the show's producers and himself. The
producer had sued for half a million pounds, but has settled for #250,000
out of court. Both sides described the settlement as an amicable one.

EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN -- MERTON DOES HANCOCK (oo-er!)

After his foray into the literary world with "My Struggle," Paul Merton is
now starring in a new series based on an old series. "Paul Merton In..."
finds Merton taking on the challenge of breathing new life into classic
scripts originally performed by Tony Hancock and written by Ray Galton and
Alan Simpson. In the first, called "Twelve Angry Men," he appears as a
jury foreman.

Merton has professed his love for this writing team over and over again
during interviews, and calls Hancock one of his comedy heroes. Now Merton
fans will get a chance to see a different side to the 'alien from the
planet Stroppy' from "Have I Got News For You" and "Whose Line Is It
Anyway?"

"Paul Merton In..." can be seen on Friday nights at 8:30 on ITV. Look for
an appearance by Caroline Quentin in a role originally created by Sid
James.

THE NAME IS CLEESE... JOHN CLEESE

If John Cleese's agent or someone from United Artists pictures happens to
be out there, you'd better listen. A number of posters to the Usenet group
alt.fan.james-bond have decided that once Desmond Llewelyn retires as "Q"
in the Bond movies, Cleese is the perfect person to take over the role.

With "Goldeneye" and Pierce Brosnan seeming to have revived the Bond
series and mystique, Cleese as "Q" would have the enviable task of
explaining all his cool new spy gadgetry to Bond. Posters claim that
Cleese could bring the necessary wry humour to the role. May we also
suggest Dawn French as Miss Moneypenny?

BOTTOM: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
by James Kew, james@badger.idiscover.co.uk

Well, I finally got to see the second "Bottom Live" tour earlier this
month. The verdict? Deeply disappointing.

The first live show was an exciting extension of the two previous TV
series, a chance to develop and extend the characters beyond the
restrictions of 30 minutes of prime-time television. However, it also
stood up well as a show in itself. Sure, there were sly references to the
preceding series and to Rik Mayall and Ade Edmonson's earlier work (did
The Young Ones invent the rubber cricket-bat?), but it didn't depend upon
familiarity with the characters for its laughs. There was also a feeling
that the stars were having *fun*, that they were playing with the audience
and not to them.

In contrast, the second show, "The Big Number Two Tour," felt limp,
lifeless and exploitative. Rik and Ade seemed complacent, willing to trot
out an uninspired stream of knob gags and swear-words that went down well
with much of the audience, mostly young and male, but left me feeling
somewhat empty. The good humour and originality had gone, replaced by
set-pieces that played on the audience's recognition of the characters and
of scenes from the earlier series and tour. Many of the gags seemed
unnecessary and self-indulgent, as if the assumption were that anything
penned and delivered by the stars is automatically funny.

So what went wrong? I think that Bottom has been drawn out too long.
That's a feeling that's strengthened by watching the TV series -- the
third series just doesn't live up to the previous two. Series 1 and 2
barely set a foot wrong, even tackling a couple of demanding two-handers.
Series 3, however, seems increasingly desperate: how many new situations
can there be for the "two no-hopers in a scummy flat" format? Instead of
concentrating on character and plot we got even more surreal violence and
toilet humour.

The trouble is that Bottom is a cult show and has a large captive audience
of followers that will tune in or turn out to support it, regardless of
how satisfying the experience is. Faced with such unconditional support,
it's easy for writers and players to become lazy, to retread the same
tired old jokes. Bottom isn't alone here: think back to the final series
of The New Statesman, an unsuccessful attempt to recreate the satire and
venom of the earlier series in a new European setting. Think of Red Dwarf:
does anyone rate the last series, with it's repetitive reuse of the same
jokes (Kryten's Space Corps Directives; Cat's nasal acuity) as highly as
the earlier shows?

Maybe it's time to re-examine the shows that live on in the memory as
classics. There's one thing that many of them have in common: they ended
on a high note at the peak of their popularity and creativity. John Cleese
and Connie Booth decided not to continue Fawlty Towers after penning 12
near-perfect episodes. The Young Ones ran for only two series.
Black Adder's format would easily have lent itself to further series beyond
the four that were made but was brought to a close by writers Ben Elton
and Richard Curtis, who felt that their creativity would be better
employed on new projects.

I was, and am, a big Bottom fan. But I'd prefer to remember how dazzlingly
fresh and different the first series and tour was, rather than watch
Richie and Eddie trudge wearily through further uninspired shows. I think
it's time for Rik and Ade to move on. As the old showbiz adage goes:
"Always leave them wanting more."

In Bed with Chris Barrie
======================== by Hayley Phillips, h.phillips@cant.ac.uk

OK, so I exaggerate, I was only actually in the same rehearsal room
with him, but hey, that's closer than him merely being on my TV set, and
that's a hell of a lot better than him not being on TV at all! Just to
make everyone *really* jealous, I was with "The
Brittas Empire" team for two whole weeks and I'm here to tell you all the
juicy cast gossip and, for all you "intellectuals" out there, to say a few
words about the show itself (with as little bias as a fan can manage --
yes, after months of counseling I can finally admit it).

First, a brief explanation about how I came to be allowed to stand around
doing nothing but watching my favourite cast rehearse and record the new
series of "The Brittas Empire." As part of my degree course I'm given 3
weeks off for work experience, anywhere I choose. Correctly guessing that
college would be completely useless in getting me a placement at the BBC,
I decided to set it up myself. Having set my heart on eventually working
in television as a Floor/Production Manager nearly 5 years ago, I have
become fairly accomplished in writing creepy letters in order to get
similar placements in TV. So back in March '95, I wrote an exceptionally
creepy and light-hearted letter to "Brittas" Producer/Director, Mr. Mike
Stephens. It was easy when you are genuinely an enormous fan of the
show and have all five series on video! To my amazement, he replied in the
positive, and after a few administrative cock-ups, it was all set to go: I
was to spend two weeks with the cast and crew of "The Brittas Empire" in
October as they rehearsed and recorded series six.

Well, I can safely say that it was the most fun I have ever had, and they
are the nicest cast I have ever worked with and, believe me, there have
been a few! The regular writers of the series left after series five, so
they started this year with a whole new team, which not only manage to
maintain the character developments, but also breathe new life into the
series. If you were even faintly amused by previous episodes, then you're
going to love the new one, which is due for transmission in March 1996.
(The BBC have just transmitted series four but have no plans to run five
between now and March.)

Tim Marriott (who plays "Gavin") and I had a natter about this, and we both
think the Beeb are mad -- it makes sense to run series 5 immediately before
running the new series. Perhaps it wouldn't matter so much but for the
fact that the first episode of the new series (which I saw in the final
edit) is based *very* heavily on references to the last episode of five --
it's a little difficult to ignore the fact that Mr. Brittas most
definitely died at the end! Whether the Beeb will listen to me
and an actor is somewhat doubtful. Still, we can only hope!

Back to the matter in hand - yes, all that gossip I promised! Well, before
you ask, yes, it's boring, but Chris Barrie is a really nice bloke, and
very down-to-earth. There I've said it, I'm sorry but it's true. Chris
doesn't reveal very much about himself, and I left knowing the same as
when I arrived. That's probably because he's one of those guys who can't
"chat" to women; get him on the subject of work, i.e., "Red Dwarf," and he's
fine; start up the subject of classic cars and you can't stop him, but
anything else and he's really not interested, or maybe it was just me!

The rest of the cast, well, where to begin! During my two weeks with them
there were a few tears and tantrums, but no more than is usual with actors
it would seem! Everyone, without exception, was friendly and fun, really
making me feel part of the team almost immediately. Out of them all, I
think Russell ("Tim"), Pippa ("Helen"), Tim ("Gavin") and Judy ("Julie")
were the easiest to get on with. But of course it's all a matter of
personalities, and those just happened to be the people whose interests,
outlooks and temperaments matched mine.

Without doubt, the most enjoyable aspect of my time there was
watching them all rehearse and develop the script. Each actor works very
differently, but all make an amusing line in the script into an often
hilarious moment on TV, helped of course by the direction of Mike
Stephens. Chris, this year at least, was doing his homework and arrived
each morning with the script further learnt and ideas thought out for
minor script changes to enhance the joke being made. Whether he actually
thought about his performance at home, or was simply very spontaneous, I'm
not sure. But I do know that by the very first rehearsal for each episode
his performance was already close to perfection in terms of the
mannerisms, the gestures, the voice inflections and the timing for a
scene.

Pippa Haywood ("Mrs. Helen Brittas"), by way of contrast, seemed to develop
her performance as the rehearsals progressed. She discovered where the
comedy and the opportunities for further comedy lay in the script as she
practised it. An example, for those of you familiar at all with the
characters, is her changing of a single word. It won't sound much now but
when it is seen you will realise that it does actually help to maintain
the flow in a very funny piece of dialogue between "Helen" and "Carole"
(played by Harriet Thorpe). The script read "They were my cousins from
Iowa," but the name sounds awkward for Helen, who does not use many "o" or
"u" sounds and whose mannerisms rely on the "e" sounds in words. So she
changed it to Tennessee -- simple but very effective, allowing Pippa to
add Helen's characteristic facial expression with the nod of the head on
"see." I'm afraid you'll have to wait until March to see that in action,
but trust me, it works!

The whole team were a real joy to work with and genuinely get on well
together, and I would love to work on the next series. The scripts have
already been commissioned for series seven and they will probably be recorded
in September of this year. Since I'm now firm friends with Tim Marriott I
shall let you all know as soon as he hears from the BBC -- oh yes, my
finger is firmly on the Brittas pulse...

                                   ###

Hayley Phillips <h.phillips@cant.ac.uk> is studying sitcoms as part of her

Comedy and The 50th Edinburgh Festival Fringe
by Earl Okin, spats@spats.demon.co.uk
---------------------------------------------
Over the last few years, the media may have given the impression that The
Edinburgh Fringe is a comedy festival. This is certainly not the case. The
official Edinburgh Festival itself started in 1947. It was a fair, with
lots of money being paid to overseas and other culturally elitist
companies, including opera, symphony concerts and drama. Immediately, a
small theatre company hired its own theatre space as a comment that there
was a lot more to British culture than the big fat-cat subsidized
companies and that the most creative work was often to be found in the
ill-funded, small, independent side of the profession. This was the very
first "Fringe" show.

These days, The Fringe totally swamps the official Festival. Last year, for
instance, I believe there were more than 1,800 shows, giving anywhere up
to 20 or so performances over the 3 week run of The Festival. This means
that all sorts of venues are created from what are not theatres the rest
of the year. Indeed, if you are in a hotel room with a large wardrobe, be
careful when you open it... there may be a performance going on inside.

Even now, the single most common sort of show is drama. However, you'll
find everything from circus, dance, musical comedy, opera, children's
shows and goodness knows what else. One year a naked man of 60 or so
stood on his head to give an hour's show talking about Buddhism. Yes,
*anything* can happen at Edinburgh!

The normally conservative capital of Scotland, built of granite and a
definite candidate for the most beautiful city in the world, is every year
invaded by several thousand lunatics. The population doubles with visitors
from home and abroad -- mostly the hated Sassenachs, the English! These
visitors may well be mugged at 3AM by a horde of African tribesmen,
international terrorists, or a cricket team who will leap out of shadows
and thrust a leaflet about their show at you and disappear again. I once
advised someone that if they stood still when it was raining (and it
usually is) so many leaflets would be thrust upon them that they could
turn into a papier mache model of themselves in no time at all.

The basic message at Edinburgh, however, is, forget sleep! There are shows
to go and see from any time, starting at breakfast and going on until the
early hours of the morning. In addition to the Official and Fringe
Festivals, there's a Jazz Festival a week earlier and a Film Festival,
Book Festival, and a TV Festival all held during the same manic three
weeks... and all of this while the solid citizens of Edinburgh *try* to carry
on with their normal life and ignore these noisy invaders.

It seems that I have given more performances at The Edinburgh Festival than
any other performer in its 50 year history. I first went there in 1983 and
made *all* the mistakes of a newcomer. But by doing a couple of freebie
late night cabarets, I managed to draw enough audience to get my money back.
Luckily, since then, I've always made money where it's so easy to lose
literally hundreds of pounds.

Since the Festival's beginning, performers have never been invited but have
always promoted themselves. They hire their own venues, find their own
accommodation, and *hope* to sell enough tickets to get their money back or
at least get noticed enough to kick-start their career. There are lots of
amateur companies still coming up simply for the experience of _doing_
Edinburgh.

Over the last 14 years, there has been a cynical invasion of the big
comedy-agencies into the world of Edinburgh. They've injected large
amounts of money into poster campaigns, the hiring of certain key venues,
and have hijacked press and TV coverage.

As a result, in certain comedy venues comedians meet to discuss other
shows, ticket sales, and where comedy is going while looking over the
shoulder of the people they're talking to just in case a TV producer might
be passing by. These TV producers themselves have tended to want to
straight-jacket comedy styles. All they seek seems to be the latest
stand-up act to feature, package, and give a series to; they then
gradually push them toward the same old boring TV formats of the game-show
and/or sitcom. It's a pity.

I may sound bitter about this, because my comedy also features music. I
still attract lots of enthusiastic audiences, but the media are not
interested in acts that mix comedy with music, or magic, ventriloquism or
any other skill. This, to me, is against the spirit of originality which
is the heart and soul of Edinburgh. It's a place where you can set your
own agenda, design your own show and see if the public like it. The media,
as usual, are trying to pigeonhole everyone.

Likewise, The Perrier Award, the prize for the best comedy/cabaret show,
which, in the past was awarded to all sorts of comedy shows, is now
assumed by performers to be only awarded to stand-ups. Last year there was
a performer from Holland named Hans Liberg. He's a little like a young
Victor Borge, mixing classical piano, rock guitar and comedy. He was by
far the most talented performer I've seen on The Fringe for some time, but
he wasn't even short-listed for The Perrier. Another great pity.

Despite the commercialization of comedy on The Fringe, there is still fun
to be had, if you don't mind three weeks of sleep deprivation and working
your legs, arms and other appendages off! Acts come from everywhere in the
world.

Finally, let me tell you a true story which, for me anyhow, tells you
what the true spirit of The Edinburgh Festival *should* be about.

A few years ago, an amateur company trying to cut down costs wanted to use
their venue as a place to sleep but were told by the local council that
they were only licensed as a theatre, not as an hotel. When that year's
programme appeared, it contained a very unusual show. Entitled "Seven
Hours of Restful Sleep," it ran from midnight to 7 AM, cost just one pound
to enter and seemed to comprise nothing more than a lot of horizontal
bodies all over the venue floor... snoring. Now *that's* The Edinburgh
Fringe!

THE TRAVELS OF HATTIE HAYRIDGE (BY AMTRAK INSTEAD OF RED DWARF!)
by Madelaine Burgess, adsmlb@ncal.kaiperm.org
================================================================

December was definitely the month for women in British comedy. I enjoyed
reading the special issue of "Britcomedy Digest" on the subject and I even
had an opportunity to meet one of the funny ladies herself -- Hattie
Hayridge!

Hattie plays the computer "Holly" in the latter seasons of the British
science-fiction comedy series,  "Red Dwarf." On December 10, Hattie made a
visit to the San Francisco Bay Area to guest-host a broadcast of season
six of "Red Dwarf" at KTEH Channel 54, the public television station
located in San Jose, California.

"I was in Chicago for the Visions Convention," she said, "which is a
British TV and science fiction convention. I was over at Thanksgiving
weekend, and then I bought an Amtrak (train) ticket and I've been
traveling around. Yeah, with a bag slung over my shoulder and... that's
why my hair is such a mess!... and because I've been to Alcatraz. The
barber shop was shut at Alcatraz so I couldn't get it cut properly. But
um, I've just been truckin' around on the trains and it's brilliant."
(It's probably just as well Hattie didn't receive hair-styling services at
the island famed for its former prison facilities... she probably would
have gotten a buzz cut!)

One of the many places the wayfaring actress visited was New Orleans.
Trying to make the most of her time in that city she related how she was
constantly "coming and going from the hotel in different modes of
transportation. The porter said he was going to miss me, seeing what I was
going to depart or arrive in next!" Hattie also told of spending three
days traveling through Texas by rail: "I ate, I slept, I saw Texas. I ate,
I slept, I saw Texas. I ate, I slept, I saw Texas..." In the glittery
casino town of Las Vegas, she was amused at having to "walk past a
volcano, a waterfall, and a cage of (live) tigers to get to my hotel
room!"

The San Francisco Bay Area was Hattie's last stop in the U.S. before
heading home to London. As for her impressions of this area, Hattie
admitted, "I've only seen it in rain... and wind... and at night! I can't
really say very much! I thought it was Silicon Heaven, but it's Silicon
Valley isn't it? I got it muddled..."

Indeed, Hattie arrived just as our first big winter storm arrived in
Northern California. In fact, some of the "Red Dwarf" fans had gathered
for dinner at a nearby restaurant before the broadcast, and ended up with
a genuine candlelight dining experience when the electricity went out.

As Hattie guest-hosted the "Red Dwarf" broadcast at KTEH, she talked about
the show and the other cast members, and answered phoned-in questions from
the viewing audience. The studio volunteers also got to watch the taping
of a 30-second promotional spot that Hattie did for KTEH. Hattie brought
color photos of herself which she autographed and donated as gifts to
those who called in and pledged funds to the TV station.  She also
cheerfully signed autographs and posed for photos with the volunteers.

KTEH did quite well in their fund-raising effort as I overheard one of the
directors say that they exceeded their goal for the evening. It was thanks
in great part to the talents of a wonderful guest host, I'm sure! We all
had fun that Sunday night, and were honored to have one of the lovely
ladies of British comedy visit us here in the San Francisco Bay Area.

THUMB UP
Paul Merton in Galton and Simpson's... "Twelve Angry Men"

Paul Merton stars in eight remakes of classic comedies by Ray Galton and
Alan Simpson, five of which originally starred the late Tony Hancock.

Of all the new season's series, this is surely the one that has most to
prove in its first show. Could Merton pull off the unthinkable: step into
Hancock's shoes? It seemed as unlikely as 'Kind Hearts And Coronets'
without Alec Guinness or 'Some Like It Hot' without Marilyn Monroe. What
soon becomes clear, however, is that Merton is a talented and original
performer and that Galton and Simpson's scripts are as sharp and fresh
today as they were 30 years ago.

Watching Merton perform brings out the similarities between his style and
Hancock's; both rely on an innocent, sideways view of the world, picking
out absurdities in everyday situations. However, Merton avoids falling
into the trap of aping Hancock's mannerisms and delivery, replacing
world-weariness with light-heartedness. Sam Kelly is a little less
satisfying in Sid James' role as the self-interested foil to Hancock's
naivete; it will be interesting to see how Merton's wife Caroline Quentin
interprets the part in some of the later shows.

What stands out more than anything is the quality of the writing. Apart
from minimal touches to bring the setting forward to the 1990s -- new
money, public figures, and technology -- the scripts are unchanged from
the originals. It's a joy to see the characters of the jurors painted with
just a few deft flicks of the pen, the tone of the show established by
Merton's first impish rejoinders to the judge.

Forget any deep-seated skepticism about "re-doing Hancock"; this show is
much more about a talented performer and a cracking script. What better
recipe for a great half-hour's entertainment? (JK)

THUMB DOWN
"Fat Chance"
by Simon Gray
(Faber and Faber, ISBN 0-571-17792-1)

OK, who's the bigger whiner baby? In this corner we have Stephen Fry, who
dropped out of the West End play "Cell Mates" with very little warning
allegedly due to a bad review in The Financial Times. He then disappeared
for several days before finally returning to England and checking himself
into a private hospital for a brief stay. In the meantime, the ensuing
publicity and plummeting ticket sales caused the show to close despite the
continued presence of Fry's co-star Rik Mayall.

In the other corner we have "Cell Mates" author and director Simon Gray,
who has now written this slim volume to tell all about how he was
mistreated by Fry, the press, the play's producers and everyone else,
apparently. Except Rik Mayall, that is. In fact, the portrait of Mayall
in this book reads like a letter to the Pope recommending him for
sainthood.

If Stephen Fry betrayed Gray by dropping out of the play and ruining its
chance for success, then Gray has returned the favour by writing this book
and painting an unflattering portrait of Fry.

What was Gray's point in writing this?  Clearly, the answer is revenge. Yet
for someone of Gray's stature and reputation as a "serious" artist, it
seems strange that he would do so by indulging in little more than petty
tabloid journalism. Granted I followed the whole story pretty closely, but
this book is just a simple rehashing of the events. Despite the fact that
it was written by one of the principals involved, it sheds no new light on
the strange saga of "Cell Mates." If you read the newspaper reports,
you've basically read Simon Gray's book. Save your money.

I really wish I could have more sympathy for Mr. Gray, but perhaps he
tried to write this too soon. The pain is still too fresh. With a bit of
time and objectivity he might have written an intriguing volume about the
artistic temperament, about how devastating it must have been to sweat blood
over something for five years and then have it turn out to be a nightmare.
But all we get here is petulance.

Throughout the ordeal Rik Mayall stayed silent in the press. After reading
this book I wish he would have gotten into Simon Gray's face and said his
classic line from "The Young Ones." You remember the one. "Whine, whine,
whine, moan, moan, moan... BOOORRRING!" (MS)

THUMB SIDEWAYS
"My Struggle"
by Paul Merton
(Boxtree Books, ISBN 0-7522-0775 X)

Following his wonderful look at world history in "A Secret History of the
20th Century," the affable Paul Merton has decided to take a look at his
own personal history in "My Struggle." Like the earlier book, don't expect
this "autobiography" to be true.

Not that I'm complaining. "My Struggle" is instead full of Merton's
surreal nonsense, from his supposed early start in Hollywood as
cigar-chomping child star "Baby Paul" through enough showbiz declines
and comebacks to rival John Travolta.

Merton's persona has become so ingrained in my head that I couldn't help
but hear his voice as I read, much as I always hear Ben Elton whenever I
read one of his novels. Luckily, Merton proves that deadpan isn't exactly
dead on the page, but I still wonder how funny this would be to someone
who knew nothing about Merton.

"My Struggle" is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of fluff. Merton has a truly
great comic novel inside him, something with not only wit but substance,
on par with "A Confederacy Of Dunces." I'm looking forward to reading it
someday. (MS)

THUMB UP
"The Best of The Bonzo Dog Band" CD
Rhino Records

I bought this CD because critics had compared The Bonzo Dog Band (however
erroneously) to some of my favorite musical artists: They Might Be Giants,
Was Not Was, The Art Of Noise and XTC. After hearing this absolutely
fabulous CD I can now say that if there is a small list of musical artists
who really earn the labels "absurdist humor," "surreal," and most of all
"genius," The Bonzo Dog Band should definitely be on there somewhere.

The Bonzo Dog (Dada and later Doo-Dah) Band was formed by former British
art students and budding saxophonists Roger Ruskin Spear and Rodney Slater
and grew to include the comic genius of Neil Innes on piano/guitar and the
late Vivian Stanshall on vocals/trumpet.

What's most striking about the music is its professionalism. They took the
music as seriously as the anarchy. The songs span many musical styles from
jazz to 60s psychedelia (sometimes all within the space of one song like
"Big Shot" and "Rhinocratic Oaths"). They also make many stops in between
with 20s style ragtime jazz ("Hello Mabel") to 50s style rock 'n' roll
(there's a wonderful Elvis impersonation on "Canyons of Your Mind").

The humor on this CD not only still sounds fresh today but also provides
some insight on other British comic legends. Songs like "Shirt" and
"Rhinocratic Oaths" definitely had an influence on the surreal sketches of
Monty Python's Flying Circus. As you may know (or like me if you didn't),
Neil Innes did some songs for the Monty Python films and played a
troubadour in "The Holy Grail." He later collaborated with Eric Idle on a
parody of the Beatles called "The Rutles," both writing the brilliant
songs and playing Ron Nasty.

The liner notes by John Mendelssohn and the vintage photos of the band for
me added even more amusement. Any fan of British comedy would be missing
out on a great experience if they didn't include this CD in their
collection. For the brilliant audio clarity of the disc alone it's worth
the price.

The only problem is The Best Of The Bonzo Dog Band is only available on
CD. Rhino Records didn't put it out in cassette or vinyl form. If you
can't find this great disc in stores you may have to order it from them.

MEN BEHAVING BADLY
by Michelle Street, mtstreet@cu.soltec.com
==========================================
Someone at ITV must be kicking themselves about now. They couldn't have
known when they originally canceled "Men Behaving Badly" that it would
be scooped up by the BBC and become one of the most popular sitcoms in
Britain today.

Depending on how things work out, it might even become one of the most
popular sitcoms in America as well. Carsey/Werner (the production company
responsible for Bill Cosby's popular sitcom and many others) have bought
the rights to produce an American version, making MBB the latest in a
long line of shows which have been or are in the process of being
transplanted from Britain to America.

"Men Behaving Badly" originally premiered on ITV in 1991. Its star then
was Harry Enfield, who played the character of Dermont. After the first
series, however, Enfield left and Neil Morrissey was brought in to play
Tony, best mate to Martin Clunes' character, Gary. After the second
series it was canceled by ITV, picked up by the BBC, and has been going
strong ever since.

The title is a good description of what the show entails, though I take
exception to the use of the word "men." "Guys" or "Lads" would probably
have been a more apt description. Gary and Tony aren't men, but the kind
of males all women know -- those still stuck in a semi-juvenile
netherworld, unable to commit and unwilling to grow up.

Still, you've gotta love them anyway and the show revolves around these two
best mates and their attempts to find well, if not love, at least a really
good shag. Gary has a girlfriend named Dorothy while Tony is totally
enamoured of Deborah, the bird who lives in the same building. Fortunately
for us, Deborah will barely give him the time of day.

The show provides a lot of laughs along with some truly bittersweet
moments. In one of the more memorable subplots from the last series,
Dorothy and Gary discussed having children and then came the heartbreak
when Dorothy realized that Gary wasn't quite the man to father her child.
After all, someone who still carries a picture of children's TV
presenter Michaela Strachan in his briefcase isn't exactly ready for
parenthood.

"MBB's" ace in the hole are four actors who breath life into the
characters originally created by Simon Nye. First let's take a look at
those misbehavin' men.

Martin Clunes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Martin Clunes is endearing. Tall and somewhat odd-looking, but endearing
nonetheless. Even when he's drunk on a sofa singing "Lady In Red" with his
best mate. (OK, *especially* when he's drunk on a sofa singing "Lady In
Red" with his best mate.)

Drinking and sitting on the sofa is a lot of what Martin Clunes does as
Gary on "Men Behaving Badly." However, he does this well enough to have
earned the award for "Best Television Performer In A Comedy Show" at the
recent British Comedy Awards. Beneath the somewhat goofy looking exterior,
however, is a very intriguing man with the soul of an artist.

Like his cohorts on "Men Behaving Badly," Martin Clunes came to the
popular sitcom with varied and extensive experience. He played Prince
Long, the mortal enemy of Dr. Who, during the Peter Davison days, and also
appeared in a couple of sitcoms ("No Place Like Home" and "To All At
Number 20"), before returning to the theatre.

In 1990 he and two friends (Ian Michie and Paul Brennen) set up an acting
company called "Big Arts" (with a silent t) and that same year Clunes won
a London Fringe Award for directing a production of Alan Sillitoe's play
"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner."

His earlier experience in sitcoms had not been the most positive, so it
took Harry Enfield and quite a lot of drink to convince Clunes to take the
part of Gary on MBB. Since then there's been no looking back. He's
appeared on "Have I Got News For You," done a radio adaptation of "The
Importance of Being Earnest," with Judi Dench, and has in 1994 even
directed and starred in a low budget film called "Staggered."

This is something he will be doing more of in the future. He has two film-
directing projects in the works and with MBB having received so many
awards, there's no doubt that we'll see him in the future as Gary, sitting
on a sofa, drinking, and singing "Lady In Red" with his best mate.

Neil Morrissey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first time I saw Neil Morrissey I immediately compared him to Paul
McCartney: he's got the same boyish good looks, puppy-dog eyes and
undeniable Liverpudlian charm.  Also like McCartney, Morrissey's boyish,
carefree exterior hides a troubled past.

This includes separation from his parents at a very early age. For
reasons he won't go into great detail about, except to say that they'd
been rather naughty boys, when Neil was ten he and two of his three
brothers were taken away from their parents and put in the care of council
homes.

This experience left an indelible mark on the young Morrissey, who
remained in homes until the age of eighteen.  The bullying, abuse, and
inequity he saw during those years left him angry, but luckily he was able
to channel that anger into something productive and got the attention he
needed by getting involved in drama.

At eighteen he went off to London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama
for training and admittedly indulged in a lot of "Men Behaving Badly"
behaviour, though with a lot more success than the character of Tony.

His first television appearance was as a motorcycle messenger named Rocky
in the series "Boon." Then he was chosen to succeed Harry Enfield on
"Men Behaving Badly." It is the chemistry between his character, Tony,
and Clunes character, Gary, which is to a large extent responsible for the
show's success.

He is divorced from Amanda Noar, with whom he had a son Sam, and is
currently living with actress Liz Carling.

And what about the women who have to put up with this misbehaviour?  They
are:

Caroline Quentin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Caroline Quentin is one very busy and very lucky lady. Her talents as a
comedienne and actress have landed her roles in television, theatre and
on the radio. Her charm, humour, and intelligence landed her a husband in
the form of one Mr. Paul Merton, who proposed to her under the statue of
Eros in London's Piccadilly Circus.

Like Dawn French, Quentin exudes not only wit but an earthiness and wisdom
that makes her instantly likable. Good thing she has this quality and is
easy to take because for the past few years she's been everywhere.

First there's the improvised show on Radio 4 called "The Masterson
Inheritance,"  which also co-stars her husband. On the stage she has
appeared as one of the Comedy Store Players, did an Arthur Smith-scripted
play with her husband entitled "Live Bed Show," and fantasized about
having a affair with one of England's greatest footballers as the star of
"An Evening With Gary Lineker."  This was probably her breakthrough role
and she received rave reviews for her performance as a long-suffering wife
named Monica.

In fact, "long-suffering" is the key phrase in Quentin's career, since her
most prominent roles have revolved around that expression. First in "Gary
Lineker," then on television as the girlfriend of Martin Clunes in "Men
Behaving Badly." Her portrayal of Dorothy won her the award as "Top
Television Comedy Actress" at the recent British Comedy Awards.

They work well together. Both Quentin and Clunes have a humanity that
strengthens the more bittersweet moments in MBB (as when Gary and
Dorothy broke up briefly), but they are also adept at broad comedy and
farce. If Neil Morrissey and Leslie Ash are the "faces" of MBB, then
Quentin and Clunes are its heart and soul.

Quentin's recent omnipresence is the result of years of training and hard
work. She hails from Reigate in Surrey. She went to an Arts Education
boarding school in Hertfordshire and at 16 began her showbiz career by
appearing in a seaside variety show. (Yes, she sings and dances too.) She
was one of the original cast members of "Les Miserables" and has worked
with both the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre.

Quentin is an actress who can handle anything from goofy improvisation to
serious drama. This is what has caused her to be so in demand and her
hectic schedule doesn't seem likely to ease up anytime soon.

Leslie Ash
~~~~~~~~~~
Despite everything, it is my considered opinion that Leslie Ash has the
hardest job on "Men Behaving Badly." After all, week after week she has to
make us believe that the charms of Neil Morrissey can actually be
resisted. (OK, Morrissey may not be everybody's cuppa, but there are
probably a great number who would love to be in the shoes of Ash's
character...).

Ash fits the bill well. Before joining the cast of the sitcom her main
claim to fame was a role as a mod chick in the film version of The Who's
"Quadrophenia." Her movies credit also include "The Curse of the Pink
Panther."

On television she has appeared with Neil Morrissey and Jill Gascoine in
the series "Cats Eyes," "Perfect Scoundrels" with Peter Bowles, with
Harry Enfield in "Harry Enfield and Chums" and also presented Channel 4's
"The Tube."

She is married to footballer Lee Chapman, and they have two young sons.

This ensemble works together perhaps better than any on television and are
an enormous part of the show's success. Yet as always happens when
something becomes popular, marketing execs go into turbodrive figuring out
how to make more money from it. MBB is no exception to this rule.

Happily, though, the book "The A-Z of Behaving Badly" is a worthy
companion to the series and very funny in its own right. Topics covered
include everything from the importance of mates to famous babes. The text
is a treat as are the goofy photos.

There is talk that another series of MBB will air during 1996. Will it be
able to keep up the quality and momentum, or will it prove to have
outlived it welcome? Only time -- and the assurance of continued bad
behaviour -- will tell.
