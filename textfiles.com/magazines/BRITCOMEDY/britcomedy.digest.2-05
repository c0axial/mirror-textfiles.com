Think of this issue as a Christmas present, all wrapped up in silver foil
and gold ribbon.

Why the "gift" baloney? Because BD has hit it's one-thousandth subscriber
(thank you, Steffen Fjaervik), much to my amazement. Amazement because BD
is the voluntary work of a few people who love British comedy and the
internet. We all (well, almost all) are either college students or holding
down 9 to 5 jobs with little spare time to devote to this newsletter. But,
aw, shucks -- we're just good-natured and have prepared this special
double-issue for you as a way of wishing you 'happy holidays.'

Unfortunately, we couldn't fit the annual Christmas TV Guide in, nor the
news of who won what on "The British Comedy Awards"... but hang in there
-- we'll issue an extra edition of BD before the holidays.

Just call us giving people. :)

Delighted to see your e-zine on the net, keep up the good work. Pleased to
realize we poms are not alone in the appreciation of a sense of the
totally ridiculous. Do you do any Tommy Cooper? I know his humour is
non-textual, but he was one of the funniest I have ever seen, reducing one
to helpless paroxysms of weeping laughter with the most pathetic scripts.
Maybe when the net becomes more adept at real-time visuals we may see more
of him, if any footage survives.

                               Best regards and well done,

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: I do indeed do some Tommy Cooper, but you wouldn't want
to hear it, it's pretty bad... There is plenty of footage left of Tommy
Cooper, as he was one of the subjects in the recently televised "heros of
comedy" series.

Hi Melinda!

A quick question that you may be able to answer. What happened to the first
actress to play "Zoe" on "From May to December"? Eve Matheson only
appeared for the first 13 episodes. Is there something truly juicy behind
it? Or something terribly sad? Let me know.

On the same subject, do you know what else Paul Venables from the same
series has been in? He looks familiar but I can't place him.

                               Yours,
                               Alysia Gray, ALYSIA@knme_073.unm.edu
                               KNME-TV, University of New Mexico

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: I couldn't tell ya. Readers?

            - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Do you keep any kind of a schedule for when series run in different parts
of the U.S.? We've just started running "Mr. Bean" on Channel 9 here in
Seattle, and I'd like to let people know about it.

                               Sheila Ryan, sunds@kcts.org
                               Seattle, Washington

EDITOR'S RESPONSE: We used to run a section called "What's On" that listed
PBS stations' British comedy programming; however, after a Reader's Survey
which proved that it was one of the least popular sections in BD, and due
to lack of participation, we decided to pull it. The best way to let 
people know about it is to post the information on alt.comedy.british.

PAUL EDDINGTON DIES OF CANCER

Actor Paul Eddington has succumbed to cancer at the age of 68. Eddington
had been in poor health for some time, suffering from diabetes and a
rare form of skin cancer.

Eddington was known for his roles in popular television comedies. In "The
Good Life," he played Penelope Keith's husband; in "Yes Minister" and
"Yes, Prime Minister," he turned in a memorable performance as naive but
well-meaning political pawn Jim Hacker.

"Yes Minister" co-star Derek Fowlds said, "It was wonderful to be in his
company. He always made me laugh." "Good Life" actor and close friend
Richard Briers remarked, "I don't think I've known a more smashing bloke
in all my years in showbusiness."

Paul Eddington passed away on 4 November. He will be missed.

BEN ELTON SQUEEZES ANOTHER COMEDY OUT

The much-anticipated Ben Elton/Rowan Atkinson comedy, "The Thin Blue Line,"
has finally hit the fan, so to speak. It casts Atkinson as the meticulous
and conservative "Inspector Fowler." Reaction on the 'net is mixed, but
one thing's for sure: we've all underestimated the importance of Richard
Curtis.

The "Thin Blue Line" airs Mondays at 8:30 PM on BBC1. See this issue's BD
Recommends and Editorial.

COSBY TO STAR IN AMERICAN "ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE"

After a bidding war with rival NBC, the CBS network has announced the 
signing of sitcom legend Bill Cosby to star in an American version of 
the television comedy, "One Foot In The Grave."

Though the premise will remain the same, reports indicate that the title
will most likely be changed to something a little more upbeat and that the
main character will not be retired but a middle-aged man going through a
mid-life crisis. (Shades of "Reginald Perrin" there...) 

Cosby has signed a rare two-year, forty-four episode deal to play that
retired curmudgeon "Victor Meldrew," taking on the role originated by
Richard Wilson. No word yet on who will be rounding out the cast.

There may be a bit of hope for this one. The struggling CBS is definitely a 
network in dire need of a hit, and looking back at "All In The Family" 
and "Sanford and Son," it has a good track record when it comes to 
transplanting British sitcoms.

HOL? READ MY LIPS: WHAT-IS-HAP-PENNING?

"Red Dwarf" fans have been waiting a long time for a seventh series of the
popular sci-fi/comedy series; and now they are going to have to wait a
little longer.

Despite rumours to the contrary, the seventh series has not started filming
yet, and won't until around March 1996. It is not expected to reach the
small screen until January of '97. The entire regular cast are scheduled
to return, including Chris Barrie, who had been sitting on the fence ever
since the last series ended.

To the disappointment of many fans, there will not be a studio audience
present during taping. Only afterwards will the new episodes be shown to
two audiences, in order to add a laugh track.

In the meantime, "Dwarfers" in California can indulge in a "Red Dwarf"
night on December 10. PBS affiliate KTEH will be showing all of season six
that evening. For more information about activities that evening and about
"Bay Area Dwarfers" (aka "BAD"), send e-mail to <adsmlb@ncal.kaiperm.org>.

TONY HANCOCK FANS UNITE!

Hancock fans, point your web browsers to http://www.ncl.ac.uk/~nnac and get
ready for a treat. The Homepage of "The Tony Hancock Appreciation Society"
("THAS") is online and well worth a visit. The page is still under
construction, but you can obtain biographical information on the man and
the Society, which already boasts honorary members such as legendary
comedy writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson.

For more info, send email to <Nigel.Collier@newcastle.ac.uk>.

WHO'S THAT THEN?

Who's that familiar-looking guy in the funny new Sainsbury's advert?  Why
it's no less than a still very tall but this time mustachioed John Cleese.
Cleese's ad follows in the footsteps of that of his "Fawlty Towers"
co-star Prunella Scales' advert for Tescos. He portrays a cook who, among
other things, tells viewers to "get a clean work surface" and promptly
pushes cooking utensils onto the floor.

This is not Cleese's first venture into advertising. In the States he has
hawked everything from Magnavox electronic products to fertilizer to
sparkling mineral water.

STARS GIVE 100% FOR CHARITY

Every November, the BBC and its stars prove that the spirit of giving
doesn't have to wait until the Christmas season.

The BBC had its 16th annual Charity Night on Friday, November 24th,  in
support of the "Children In Need" appeal. The comedy stars turned out in
force. Chris Barrie starred as "Gordon Brittas" in a special edition of 
"The Brittas Empire" with no less than famed boxer Frank Bruno. 

Also putting in a guest appearance was "Hycanith Bucket" -- er, Bouquet --
who starred in a special "Keeping Up Appearances."

The casts of "Men Behaving Badly" went to heaven to promote the children's
charity, while comedy duo Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer were
uncharacteristically serious in a half-hour special entitled "A Smell Of
Nature."

Meanwhile, Channel 4 promoted World Aids Week by showing "The Big Snog,"
which aided the Hysteria Trust. Lenny Henry introduced the proceedings
with a little help from Steve Coogan (aka "Alan Partridge"), Eddie Izzard,
and Dale Winton.

SAFFIE UPDATE

What does one do for an encore after playing "Lydia Bennett" in the BBC's
acclaimed production of "Pride and Prejudice"? Why, a comedy of course!

Julia Sawalha ("Absolutely Fabulous") is cast as yet another distressing
daughter in "Faith In The Future." This is a remake of the ITV series
"Second Thoughts," but without the participation of leading man James
Bolam. The series also stars Linda Bellingham.

"Second Thoughts" was originally a Radio 4 series and made its TV debut in
1991. Sawalha plays the teenage daughter of a divorced couple who wonders
if they still love each other.

RUTLEMANIA

Who cares about the Beatles reunion when Dirk, Barry, Stig, and Nasty are
back! ...well, that's not *entirely* true... it's only Nasty who's
reformed with himself, but nevertheless get ready for another round of
Rutlemania devoted to the Pre-Fab Four.

The new Rutles tune called "I Don't Know Why" was premiered on the final
episode of the satirical TV show "Rory Bremner Who Else?" Neil Innes,
along with ex-Python Eric Idle, masterminded the brilliant Beatles parody
and played "Ron Nasty." They celebrated the Fab Four reunion by performing
a take-off of the much-hyped song "Free As A Bird." Lucky for us, Jeff
Lynne was not allowed to produce. Here is a transcription of the lyrics
and the setup to the song:

CAPTION: Last week ex-Rutle Ron Nasty found a demo tape in a garage in
East London. Reforming by himself, the first Rutles single for 25 years
was released...

"I DON'T KNOW WHY"

I don't know why (I don't know why) 
The world turns out to be the world it was, 
As time goes by I don't know why (I don't know why) 
When love turns out to be the stuff between 'Hello and goodbye'

Looking back, 
with 20/20 hindsight, 
We only try to play our part, 
But when selfishness shows up in the yard, (Run end credits here) 
We just go and put locks on our heart...

Oh why (Oh why), 
I don't know why (I don't know why...) 
True love turns out to be the stuff between 'hello and goodbye'...

(Fade out. Then cut to the end roller).

...and goodbye. (Drum and into quick piano tune to end)

The piano tune at the end was a few bars from the theme song to Spike
Milligan's "Q5." Apparently Innes was paying tribute not only to The
Beatles.

NEW WALLACE AND GROMIT FILM AIRS THIS CHRISTMAS

Nick Park and company have created a new "Wallace and Gromit" animated
film. "A Close Shave," is 30 minutes long, and the plot ingredients
consist of porridge, knitting and romance.

Chances are you know someone in your family who is a big fan of Wallace and
Gromit. At least, that's what Nick Park is hoping, as he's licensed alarm
clocks, back-packs, school accessories, cards, magnets, t-shirts and
piggy-banks based on the dynamic duo.

The latest installment is due to be shown at the Institute of Contemporary
Arts cinema prior to its TV showing on Christmas day. It'll be released on
video December 27th (#9.99).

With the t-shirts, alarm clocks and videos, it looks like it's going to be
a "Wallace and Gromit" Christmas.

DISILLUSIONED BEN ELTON FAN DETECTS A "THIN BLUE VEIN"
by Jay McLaren, mclaren@euronet.nl

To Ben Elton, wherever you are...

Sorry, Ben, but that was really weak!

I just went through the episode for the third time, because I couldn't
believe how thin "The Thin Blue Line" was. With at least three dubious
references to the fact that the Atkinson character dislikes gays, some
equally subtle stuff about the mincing constable, a few pops at the Queen.
Some reassuring jokes about black men's dicks. And the fascinating
switched "wrong love-gifts" routine which was the climax (echoes of
"Othello" and Classic French Farce). Exquisitely done, and just as fresh
as when it was first used about 420 years ago...

On another historical note, I notice you've been environmentally friendly
and recycled the joke about not being able to plug in a computer, which
went down so hilariously in the first episode of "Filthy, Rich and
Catflap" all those years ago... As you said yourself "Better watch out,
this is dangerous stuff."

I saw your interview with Monkhouse where you said how hard you've been
working with the live act. It shows, mate. Could you use some fresh help?

Ben, couldn't you think up a pseudonym for yourself before they ran the
credits?

FRENCH AND SAUNDERS... BAH BEE DOO WEE OOOOH 
                                                      by Michelle Street

I became  a French and Saunders fan after discovering alternative comedy
many moons ago. I guess part of the reason I'm such a fan is that I
relate to them so much. Consider the following scary coincidences:

* Dawn and Jennifer both came from military families. So did the author of
this article. (Ok, not too scary yet but the lights are starting to
flicker.)

* Dawn and Jennifer both trained to be teachers. So did the author of this
article. (Wind starts to rustle and howl.)

* Dawn French grew up to be extremely short (ok, let's make DIDN'T grow up)
:) and developed an enormous affection for chocolate. So, too, did the
author of this article. (Windows rattle.)

* Jennifer Saunders, on the other hand, grew up with a tendency to dye her
hair and drink lots of wine. So did the author of this article. (Doors
fly open! Lightning strikes! AAAGGHGHH!)

All right, all right, seriously, I do believe part of the reason for French
and Saunder's popularity is that I'm not the only person who can relate to
them. Despite the crazed characters they've played they come off as *real*
people. They also come off as people you'd like to know. And know them you
will (at least a bit better) after you're done reading this.

THE FRENCH AND SAUNDERS FAQ

1) So how did these two godheads of comedy meet?

     Well, they met back in the '70s when they were both
     training to be drama teachers at the Central London School
     of  Drama. They ended up sharing a flat and despite Dawn's
     claim that Jennifer was the flat bully they began a
     friendship and professional collaboration which endures to
     this day.

2) Where did they get their start?

     At Peter Richardson's Club "The Comic Strip" during the
     early '80s. It all began as a joke, but Richardson kept
     encouraging them to hone their act and they became
     semi-regulars. Their most popular bit at this time was
     called "Psychodrama," about two neurotic women meeting for
     the first time in years.

3) What else did they do before their *big* break?

     When several other performers at "The Comic Strip"
     (Monsieurs Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, and Nigel Planer) got
     their break into the world of television via "The Young
     Ones," they took French and Saunders along by casting them
     in several episodes. You may remember Dawn being told to
     "piss off, floppy ears" by Vyv when she came in as the
     Easter Bunny, and Jennifer as Rik's pretend girlfriend, the
     completely mad murderess "Helen Mucus" in the episode
     entitled "Time."

4) Ok, so what did they do after that?

     Well, with the success of "The Young Ones," in which four
     guys shared a flat, the girls decided it was their turn and
     came up with "Girls On Top" in which (WOW!) four girls
     shared a flat and had a wacky landlady. The series was
     written by French, Saunders, and Ruby Wax with Ben Elton
     serving as script editor. It was transmitted in 1985-1986.
     In this series French (playing a bossy, feminist sort)  and
     Saunders (as a complete no-brain) were joined by Ruby Wax
     (as a -- quelle surprise -- loud American) and Tracey
     Ullman (as a lying, conniving little bimbo). The regular
     cast was rounded out by Joan Greenwood, who played their
     landlady... *not* "Mr. Balowski." After the first series
     Tracey Ullman left to seek fame and fortune in the US, but
     a second series was made. Much like "The Young Ones," the
     series ends with an explosion mainly because the principals
     involved didn't want to get stuck in a long-running series.
     The characters and the house they live in are all destroyed
     when the landlady lights a stash of petrol she has been
     accumulating.

5) You mentioned someone named Ruby Wax. Who's she?

     Ruby Wax is an American expat from suburban Chicago who
     moved to England at age 18 apparently due to a Beatles
     obsession (I can relate) :) and has made a bit of a name
     for herself as a writer, performer, and television chat show
     hostess. She has presented several series, including "Don't
     Miss Wax" and "The Full Wax," and also performed at many of
     the important benefits, including the "Hysteria!" benefits
     for AIDS. She is also credited as script editor on "Ab Fab"
     and is married to Ed Bye, who has worked behind-the-scenes 
     on "The Young Ones," "Bottom,"  and "Red Dwarf."

5) And THEN what did they do?

     Beginning around 82, the women had also became involved with
     an ongoing series of television and feature length films
     that were released under the banner of "The Comic Strip
     Presents." Along with Dawn and Jennifer these films starred
     Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, Nigel Planer, and Peter
     Richardson, who were on occasion were joined by Robbie
     Coltrane and Alexei Sayle.

     The "Comic Strip" films varied in tone, subject, and style
     and gave the participants a real chance to show off their
     acting chops. Jennifer was especially memorable
     impersonating Meryl Streep opposite Peter Richardson's Al
     Pacino in "The Strike," and Dawn was great as the scheming
     maid in "Consuela." Both contributed scripts to the series
     as well, coming up together and on their own with such gems
     as "Summer School" and "Slags."

6) Didn't they get their own series?

     Yes, they sure did. "French and Saunders" starred the two
     ladies backed by the music (and sometimes acting skills) of
     Raw Sex, better known as Simon Brint and Roland Rivron.
     Later, terrific singer/songwriter Kirsty MacColl was given
     a spot to do a song and during one of the series they were
     even joined by the "Hot Hoofers" (a dance team who were
     neither hot nor very good hoofers).

     "French and Saunders" debuted in 1987 and was important in
     that it caused "alternative" comedy to be more accepted by
     mainstream public. They weren't the loud, crude potty
     mouths that made up "The Young Ones"; nor were they doing
     highly politicized rantings like Ben Elton. Their skits
     were sharply observed and well-acted. One of them, called
     "Modern Mother," would be the embryo for "Absolutely
     Fabulous."

7) You mentioned "Ab Fab." What else has Jennifer done without
   Dawn?"

     One of Jennifer's first break-out performances was in the
     Ben Elton-scripted "Happy Families." Ok, ok, if you want to
     get technical this is not Jennifer on her own because Dawn
     had a role as the cook, but this was clearly Jennifer's
     time to shine. She played five different roles in this
     intricately plotted sitcom about Granny Fuddle's attempts
     to reunite her wayward daughters. Why does the mean ol'
     Granny need the daughters she has long despised?  For an
     organ transplant she thinks she needs. The daughters agree
     to do this as long as Granny signs over her estate to them.
     She does so and then comes the punch line... Granny's not
     dying after all, she's just pregnant.

     Yet it is "Ab Fab" that has given Jennifer the most
     attention, and even more so since she sold the rights to
     Roseanne to make an American version. What's going to
     happen to "Ab Fab" once it reaches America is still
     unclear. Last reports indicated that TV execs were so
     horrified by the booze and drug-laden scripts they were
     seeing that its future is still up in the air.

8) What has Dawn done without Jennifer?

     She has starred in several series of her own, including a
     series devoted to food called "Scoff," "Murder Most
     Horrid," and last year she played the title role in the
     Richard Curtis scripted "Vicar of Dibley."

     In the early '90s she also had a successful run in the West
     End as the star of Ben Elton's "Silly Cow." In this
     ingeniously plotted attack on the gutter press she played
     Dorris Wallis, a tabloid journalist who gets her
     comeuppance at the hands of those she has trashed in print.

9) What about their private lives?

     Jennifer is married to Ade Edmondson of "The Young Ones" and
     "Bottom" fame and they have three daughters named Freya,
     Beattie, and Ella.

     Dawn is married to "Chef" star Lenny Henry and they have an
     adopted daughter, Billie. In their act they sometimes
     pretend to hate each other, but in real life they are
     apparently the best of friends.

10) What's in the future for them? 

     Jennifer is playing "Mrs. Bluveridge" in the upcoming
     "Muppet Treasure Island" film.

     And if the recent picture of Dawn French in "People"
     magazine dressed up as "Baywatch" babe Pamela Anderson is
     any indication, there seems to be another series of "French
     and Saunders" in the works.

     Since they haven't worked together in quite a while it'll be
     great to see them team up again. Given their track record
     it'll no doubt have been worth the wait.

                                   ###

JO BRAND: A MINI-BIO 
==================== by Michelle Street

Jo Brand's previous job working with mentally unstable psychiatric
patients must have been great practice for what would be become her next
gig: facing drunken hecklers in the comedy clubs of London.

She seems to attract a lot of them and they were out in force the first
time I saw her at the Comedy Store. As she took the stage to compere the
evening a group of guys from the back, there for a bachelor party, started
to heckle her.

They should've known better. They didn't get far as Brand immediately
reminded them of the "Comedy Store" policy which states that anyone who
heckles her has to shag her afterwards. Let's just say these lads were
pretty quiet the rest of the evening.

Yes, Jo Brand is tough, but there's still a strong well of
self-deprecating wit which to an extent softens her. She makes fun of her
weight problem, describes herself as looking like a "jelly fish," and was
commonly referred to as "The Sea Monster." Yet that has all worked in her
favour and has not stopped her from becoming one of the top female comedy
talents working in Britain today.

She came to comedy rather late in life, though she had considered going
into it since she was a teenager. Instead of following her comedic
instincts, she at first studied sociology and psychology and trained as a
psychiatric nurse. She worked at a psychiatric emergency clinic in
Camberwell until 1988, when she decided that she could do what the
performers she'd seen at the cabarets could do. She was right and a star
was born.

That same year she performed at both the Montreal Comedy Festival and the
Edinburgh Fringe Festival and by 1990 she had become so respected that she
was awarded the "01 For London/Time Out" Cabaret Award. These were
followed in '92 with a nomination for the "Perrier Pick Of The Fringe"
Award at the Edinburgh Festival as well as winning the British Comedy
Award for "Best Live Performer."

Much of Brand's material is a self-mocking look at herself as well as
talking about cakes and penises -- but there is a fierce intelligence and
a "take no prisoners" attitude to her. This attitude distinguishes her
work while at the same time gets up the noses of some people.

Her career has spanned all mediums. On TV she has been seen on such highly
rated series as "Have I Got News For You," "Absolutely Fabulous," and was
co-host of "The Brain Drain" as well as starring in her own Channel 4
series, "Jo Brand - Through The Cakehole." She has done a significant
amount of radio, including appearances on "The Mary Whitehouse
Experience," "The Jonathan Ross Radio Show," and "Missed Demeanors." In
1994 she even put her gutsy brand of humour into print when she published
"A Load Of Old Balls," her look back at "great" men in history.

If you're not familiar with the work of Jo Brand, this book would be a good
place to start. Also available is "Through The Cakehole: The Best Of Jo
Brand On Video." It contains a collection of her best stand-up routines
and sketches from her first solo television series on Channel 4.

For maximum effect, however, pop down to "The Comedy Store" or another
venue whenever she's performing and see her with a live crowd. You're
welcome to heckle, but just don't *ever* think you'll get the best of her.

This is only a start. I would like this to become as complete and detailed
as possible and maintain it as an archived list and/or create a web page.

If you have any comments, concerns, etc. just keep them to yourself, ok?
Hahahaha... just kidding... seriously, *please* email any additions,
corrections, or comments to <michelle@cathouse.org>. Thanks in advance!
_____________

Jo Brand - Brash comedienne who loves cake and is the possessor of an
extraordinarily caustic wit and a dead-on, deadpan delivery.

Eleanor Bron - A member of the Cambridge University "Footlights" Club, she
proved herself during the early 60s to be extremely adept at writing and
performing sketch comedy, often teamed with John Bird. As Princess Ahmed,
she also tried to keep the Beatles out of trouble in "Help"

Patsy Bryne - Best known for her role as the dingy Nursie/Bernard in
"Blackadder 2."

Carol Cleveland - Playing second banana to the Pythons couldn't have been
easy but she managed to make her mark. Who can forget the classic... "But
it's my only line!" or how she lured unsuspecting milkman Michael Palin
into her lair of milkmen.

Jenny Eclair - Feisty stand-up who started out on the poetry circuit and
ended up winning the coveted Perrier "Pick of the Fringe" Award.

Dawn French - She and her partner Jennifer Saunders form one of the most
popular double acts in British comedy.

Rebecca Front - One of the wonderful cast of supporting players from
"Knowing Me, Knowing You" "On The Hour," and "The Day Today." She also
cavorted in a hot tub with Christopher Ryan during an episode of "Ab Fab."

Jane Horrocks - Best known as the ditzy Bubbles on "Ab Fab," she was also
wonderful in director Mike Leigh's "Life Is Sweet."

Kit Hollerbach - A Brit only by association (she's American but married to
fellow comedian Jeremy Hardy), Hollerbach made something of a name for
herself in Britain on the "alternative" circuit and as a writer.

Penelope Keith - One of the grand dames of the British sitcom. Penelope
Keith and her splendid comedic timing have been on display in such classic
series as "The Good Life," "To The Manor Born," and "Executive Stress."
Most recently seen as a grandmother trying to raise her grandchildren after
their parent's death in "Next Of Kin."

Felicity Kendall - Star of "The Good Life" and "Solo," she was also known
as the object of Rik's desire on "The Young Ones." She's also done
extensive stage work, appearing quite often in the plays of her paramour,
Tom Stoppard.

Josie Lawrence - Extraordinarily talented comedienne, actress, and singer
seen improvising on "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" She's also done several
sitcoms, including the cleverly named "Josie" and appeared in the movie
"Enchanted April."

Helen Lederer - You might remember her from "The Young Ones" as the
annoying bank clerk who kept saying "Good morning, sir" while Rik was
trying to rob her, but she has also appeared in "Bottom," as one of
Patsy's co-workers on "Ab Fab," and has also worked the stand-up circuit.

Maureen Lipmann - Star of "Agony," "Agony Again," and those infamous ads
for British telecom so beloved by Ben Elton.

Joanna Lumley - Not normally known for being a laugh riot, Lumley stunned
everyone with her comedic abilities as that boozing, coke-snortin Pats on
"Ab Fab."

Lise Mayer - Co-author of "The Young Ones," "The Young Ones Bachelor Boys
Book" and the ex-girlfriend of Rik Mayall. (Last I heard she was involved
with Angus Deayton). She also gets points for helping Denis Leary with his
"No Cure For Cancer" and for helping out behind-the-scenes with the
stand-up series "London Underground."

Doon McKichan - Another talented female from the "Knowing You, Knowing
You," "The Day Today," and "On The Hour" gang.

Pauline Melville - One of the early pioneers of alternative comedy, she
appeared in several episodes of "The Young Ones" as Vyv's oh-so-classy
mum. She also co-wrote and starred with Alexei Sayle in the Comic Strip
film "Didn't You Kill My Brother?"

Caroline Quentin - One of the world's luckiest ladies, in my opinion. Paul
Merton proposed to her under the statue of Eros in Picadilly Square and
not only does she have him but a blossoming career as well. A frequent
performer at "The Comedy Store" she plays Dorothy on "Men Behaving Badly."

Pauline Quirke - Co-star of the popular Marks/Gran sitcom "Birds Of A
Feather," about two sisters trying to cope with life (and their annoying
neighbour Dorian) while their husbands are in jail.

Miranda Richardson - Well-respected for her dramatic talents in such films
as "The Crying Game" and "Tom and Viv," Richardson will always be
remembered most vividly by me at least as the spoiled Queen in "Blackadder
II" and also as the new mother from hell who visits Edina on "Ab Fab." She
also did a good turn as the host of the American "Saturday Night Live" and
is one of those rare talents who can do both comedy and drama.

Linda Robson - The other half of the team who played sisters Tracey and
Sharon on "Birds Of A Feather."

Patricia Routeledge - Another sitcom legend, Routledge is best known for
"Keeping Up Appearances."

Jennifer Saunders - She was the creative energy behind "Ab Fab," the
Saunders half of "French and Saunders," and even took the time to have
three kids. PHEW!

Julia Sawalha - "Saffie" on "Ab Fab" and the object of seriously lustful
thoughts by some of the blokes on alt.comedy.british. She also appeared in
"The Press Gang" and the recent "Faith In The Future."

Prunella Scales - She's done an enormous amount of wonderful work but
there's only one word necessary here: "BASIL!"

Pamela Stephenson - She was the blonde sexpot of "Not The Nine O'Clock
News" and also snagged a long-time companion in Billy Connolly as well as
a brief gig on "Saturday Night Live." In my opinion, this is one lady
whose immense talents still remain unexplored to a large extent. Her
literary claim to fame is an amusing book she authored entitled "How To Be
A Complete Bitch."

Mollie Sudgen - Mrs. Slocombe's pussy and tinted hair will be forever
embedded in the hearts of "AYBS?" fans everywhere thanks to the talent of
Mollie Sudgen.

Emma Thompson - She bounced back from a bad series called "Emma" to become
an Academy Award winning actress. Despite that, I don't think she'll ever
do better than her classic performance as "Miss Money-Sterling" on the
episode of "The Young Ones" entitled "Bambi." She was the upper-class twit
who said "I've got a Porsche." Also great in "The Tall Guy" with Jeff
Goldblum.

Sandi Toksvig - Short, Danish, and a great contestant every time she shows
up on "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" Also, she's apparently the owner of some
very famous knees. :D

Tracey Ullman - Multi-talented performer who also put out a couple of
decent pop records and got Paul McCartney to appear in a video with her.
She began as one of the "Three Of A Kind" and before heading off to seek
fame and fortune in America she appeared with French and Saunders in
"Girls On Top." Her American TV series "The Tracey Ullman Show" garnered
lots of critical raves and awards and she has also appeared in films such
as "Plenty."

Julie Walters - Engaging actress and sometime sidekick to Victoria Wood.
Walters was terrific as "sexual entrepreneur" Cynthia Paine in the Terry
Jones directed "Personal Services" and stole the heart of Michael Caine in
"Educating Rita."

Ruby Wax - Once again, an American who has made a home and career in the
UK. She's worked with French and Saunders in "Girls On Top," hosted her
own shows, and served as script editor of "Ab Fab."

June Whitfield - From "Terry and June" to Edina's lovably spacey Mom on
"Ab Fab" she's an endearing treasure.

Barbara Windsor - The effervescent bombshell from the long running series
of "Carry On" films.

Victoria Wood - Writer, performer, creator of such sketch gems as "Acorn
Antiques." Her one woman shows consistently sell out and she has also
published several books including "Barmy" and "It's Up To You, Porky!"

=============
Capsule reviews on radio programs, television, and stage.

THUMB SIDEWAYS
Feature Review: "The Thin Blue Line"
8:30 PM Mondays BBC 1
Starring Rowan Atkinson.

"Special forces cannot operate without intelligence!" Raised eyebrow. "It
seemed to be doing okay so far..." Laugh track. This is about as hilarious
as "The Thin Blue Line" gets, although the episodes have been improving
minimally as the series has progressed. Watching the talented Rowan
Atkinson plod through the dire script is a strangely intriguing
experience: you're rooting for him, admiring the way he deals the mediocre
lines, and cheering for him when he does get the occasional
"Blackadder"-worthy line.

Yes, this Elton/Atkinson comedy will undoubtedly be judged harshly because
it is *not* Blackadder set in a police station. But even on it's own
merits, this recycled joke-factory (most involving the word "bowels") does
not warrant more than a "thumb sideways." Catch it if you've nothing else
to do. Better yet, download the Blackadder scripts and read them instead.

THUMB UP
"Coogan's Run"
9:30 PM Fridays BBC2
Starring Steve Coogan.

Steve Coogan, wary of being branded forever as "Alan Partridge," has
decided to use "Coogan's Run" as a showcase for his talents by having each
episode focus on one of the inhabitants of the fictional Lancashire town
Ottle. Unfortunately, this was at the expense of a good plot in some
episodes ("Death of a Salesman" with "Gareth Cheeseman"). All the episodes
have intriguing direction and last week's installment, set in 1960 and
centering on DIY expert "Ernest Moss," is one I'll keep on videotape. By
taking chances and avoiding pigeon-holing himself into one character,
Coogan is insuring his popularity for years to come.

THUMB SIDEWAYS
"Chef!"
10:20 PM Mondays BBC1
Starring Lenny Henry.

It's one of the few comedies on British television featuring blacks. What's
it like? Well, it's Lenny Henry yelling at people. And he does do it well,
but in the end, this is a middle-of-the-road comedy in which the laughs
are few and far between. Writer Peter Tilbury just isn't infusing "Chef!"
with any... *jokes*.

Lenny Henry is funny, he has fleshed out a great character, but c'mon,
Lenny: we *know* you're better than this!

THUMB UP
"The Brittas Empire"
8:30 PM Thursdays BBC1
Starring Chris Barrie, Julia St. John, Tim Marriott, Russell Porter, Jill
Greenacre, Mike Burns, Judy Flynn, Harriet Thorpe, Pippa Haywood.

Some people really hate this program. The authority figure ("Mr. Brittas,"
Manager of the Whitbury Leisure Centre) is an utter prat and the
characters tolerate him because either they have to (assistant manager
"Laura"), they are neurotic/"hysterical" women ("Carole," "Helen") or
because they are marginalized members of society (walking cold-sore
"Colin," homosexuals "Gavin" and "Tim"). It's been running for seven or
eight series, though, and the ideas are running thin. Still funny, but
heading out to pasture...

THUMB DOWN
"Faith in the Future"
8:30 PM Fridays ITV/LWT

Something you watch when you come home from work and are too tired to 
change the channel. 

THUMB UP
"Clive Anderson Talks Back"
10:30 Fridays Channel 4

Clive Anderson is the winner of this year's "Ben Elton Motormouth" award.
Usually his guests have a tough time with his direct approach (Clive is
not afraid to ask the awkward questions), and when guests do give him a
bit of guff about Clive's mile-a-minute-thought-a-second approach, the
audience laughs appreciatively. Sharp, very funny and the closest thing to
David Letterman in the UK. Now, if he could only get a band...

AOL BLACKADDER FANS HOLD CYBER-CHAT WITH STEPHEN FRY

Todd Brandon Miller (aka "Melchitt") has created a Black Adder fan
club/mailing list on American Online. "We exchange sound files, banter,
discuss the show and, yes, have chats. We were fortunate enough to have
Stephen come chat with us." AOL staff has no participation nor endorsement
in this club.

For more information about the AOL Black Adder, which started only a month 
ago, contact Todd at <GenMelchit@aol.com>.

Note from Todd: 

     "About the "chatlog": I have altered it from it's original
     form. Not changed what was written, but pasted multiple
     entries together as one, deleted some of the chat between
     others in the group, and tried to put questions and answers
     together as best I could. I did not delete anything Stephen
     said. I hope this shorter format still conveys the personal
     feelings of a chat."

OnlineHost:     Stephen11 has entered the room.
GenMelchit:     Stephen! Welcome...

Calvin1995:     Hey, Stephen! Great to talk to ya!
Stephen11:      Where's everyone from? hi there everyone
IFDA:           Illinois
Calvin1995:     I'm from Kansas. Please don't hit me...
Ataru12345:     Hello, Stephen. I'm from Paramus, NJ
GenMelchit:     Wooster, Ohio (!)
Supahz:         I'm living in Memphis TN
Holly5120:      I'm from PA, near Philly
Kmtrillian:     I'm from near Pittsburgh, PA
Calvin1995:     I still am in Kansas...::sigh::
Stephen11:      I was in Philly for July 4th -- this year, very good fun
Supahz:         Were you ever in Kansas, Dororthy?
Stephen11:      Never been to Kansas, sadly -- but someone once dropped a 
                house on my sister...
Supahz:         But she wore nice shoes.
Tintagel67:     Letchworth, Hertfordshire
Stephen11:      Letchworth? How come you're aol then?
Tintagel67:     I'm from there, I'm in Florida at the moment
Stephen11:      Hang on, you can't be in Letchworth >and< Florida can you?
GenMelchit:     Stephen, are you living in the US or just visiting?
Stephen11:      Gen: I've bought an apartment here in NYC, I'll spend some 
                time here ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DanielC71:      Stephen11: Any interest in performing "The Real Insp. 
                Hound" with Hugh Laurie & Rowan Atkinson?
Stephen11:      Dan: well, that's a thought. Rowan and Hugh and I did 
                have a plan to do The Importance(1) last year but it fell 
                through... I was going to be Lady Bracknell, Hugh Algernon
                and Rowan Jack... I know - I was >so< looking forward to 
                the frocks ...
Supahz:         The only thing worse than being Lady Bracknell is NOT
                being Lady Bracknell
Stephen11:      Rowan has a new sit-com out at the moment, called The Thin 
                Blue Line, written by Ben Elton
----------------
Calvin1995:     Stephen11:  coming out with any new books soon?
Stephen11:      Just finished a screenplay for Paramount and now have to
                concentrate on a new nov. by Spring
----------------
GenMelchit:     Stephen - Tell us about something we may not have seen - 
                like early roles. Commercials?
Stephen11:      Lots of commercials, I'm afraid. Hugh and I regularly do 
                one for Alliance and Leicester.  A & L is a Building 
                Society in Britain, equiv of a US Building and Loan Co., 
                I suppose.  In those, I play an idiot and Hugh is the smart
                one, called Mostyn, who does everything right.  We've been 
                doing them for about six years now, I should think. I also 
                did some beer commercials...For heineken Export: strapline 
                "From your smooth talking bar steward..."
----------------
Tintagel67:     My husband and I were with the Halifax but we liked the 
                ad's anyway
Stephen11:      Well thank you, Tint...
----------------
DanielC71:      Stephen11: Any plans for more J&W(2) and will it be 
                released on vidtape in the US?
Stephen11:      I >think< it'll come out on tape, but WGBH have to finish 
                their reruns first -- we did four series, which amounts to 
                about 24 hours worth. We aren't doing any more, however -- 
                ran out of original material. Didn't feel it was right to 
                do new stories, not respectful to PGW ... Though Peter 
                O'Toole has just done a Xhristmas Special as Lord Emsworth...
----------------
DanielC71:      I think only 5 hours have been released in vid here.
Supahz:         Stephen11: You and Hugh are the perfect Jeeves and 
                Wooster... wonderful!
Stephen11:      5 Hours? Mm, that's prolly right. I don't know who 
                distributes them. Who shows Bladder here BTW?
Calvin1995:     I had to record most of J/W off of PBS
Stephen11:      Calvin, I love "off of" ... so American ;-)
----------------
GenMelchit:     Stephen - Can I have your autograph? Here, sign my 
                forehead!
Stephen11:      Hold still, Gen -- don't frown or the signature will be
                wobbly -- there!
----------------
DanielC71:      PBS might show Bladder, but I doubt it.
Supahz:         Bladder is on PBS here in TN right now.
Calvin1995:     I also recorded your host segments too
Stephen11:      Cal: Oh those -- v. embarrassing having to be Alastair 
                Cook ...
DanielC71:      Why did Bladder stop at four series?
Calvin1995:     I loved the host segments!
Stephen11:      I didn't know PBS did it, they don't in NYC Channel 13 as 
                far as I can see... most people get the vids
----------------
Tintagel67:     (..and Husband takes over..) Ben Elton (when I was last in
                U.K.) was just about to have "Stark" on the telly. Any 
                chances of Hippopotamus or Liar(3) for the small screen?
Stephen11:      Well, we considered  a sort of 60's Bladder, with Rowan as 
                a sort of Paul macartney and me as a Brian Epstein. There 
                would be a bald drummer called Rick -- known as Bald Rick,
                natch ...
GenMelchit:     Like "Bad News"?
Stephen11:      gen: not as "heavy" -- Bad News trespassed on Spinal Tap 
                territory a little too much, IMHO ...
Calvin1995:     I heard the 60's rumor, too.
Supahz:         Edmund as a hippie?!?
Kmtrillian:     That sounds interesting!
DanielC71:      As long as Brian Epstein said: "MEEEH!!"
Calvin1995:     Bald Rick?!
Stephen11:      Well, it would use Hugh's great musical ability: also 
                Rowan is quite good -- Ben also had the idea of a Russian
                Revolution movie, which John Lloyd the producer was going 
                to direct...
Stephen11:      Cal: Hugh is gigging at the moment with Lenny Henry and 
                Ade Edmondson of Young Ones ... very good band
----------------
Supahz:         Stephen11: Do you remember doing "Common Pursuit"? I really
                enjoyed that.
Stephen11:      Supahz: very well. You mean the film version or the stage? 
                The film was c-prod with WGBH and involved Tim Roth and 
                Andrew Macarthy as the obligatory American. On stage it 
                was Rik Mayall
Supahz:         I saw the film... hey, I live in Tennessee!!
----------------
GenMelchit:     Stephen - How is celeb status here in US? Do people 
                recognize you?
Stephen11:      Celeb status over here? Well, -ish, really. I get stopped
                in the street a bit -- but fortunately nothing like as mad 
                as in the UK. People here have usually either seen J&W or 
                the movie Peter's Friends or I.Q. -- I find it much more
                relaxing to walk the streets in NYC -- than London. Also 
                Americans talk about one's "work" whereas Brits are more 
                interested in -- private life and so on..
----------------
DanielC71:      Stephen: Do you mind slightly sycophantic fan e-mail?
Stephen11:      Dan: it's a lot nicer than the abusive sort!
----------------
Supahz: Steph:  I guess that the exposure of your WWW page was a bit of a
                downer then.
Stephen11:      I just worry sometimes that I'm not always a conscientious
                replier. Sometimes too busy and huge backlogs can result. 
                I have a web site which I had to "seal off" from mailing 
                and forms since I was getting so many hits a day that my 
                mail-server and access company were starting to complain.
----------------
Supahz:         Steph: Any chances of making publicity photos dressed an 
                a Hindu archer?
Stephen11:      Supahz: as Bill Murray would say in Grounhog Day, "Chances 
                about 1 per cent" ...
----------------
GenMelchit:     Stephen - can you hit us with your best banter? ala General
                Melchett?
Stephen11:      Gen: best banter? Hm, I always liked the "Now then! Now! 
                Then! Now then, now then. Then! Now! Then!" -
Stephen11:      Also "pooing pooing the poo-poos" I suppose ...
----------------
Tintagel67:     (Stealing computer back from husband) Steph, What shows do 
                you watch when you get a chance?
Stephen11:      Tint: over here, Seinfeld and Larry Sanders especially. 
                Otherwise mostly movies. They don't show Vic and Bob over 
                here, or Alan Partiridge whom I love in England.
Stephen11:      Partiridge=Partridge
----------------
Calvin1995:     How about Noel Edmonds, Stephen?  ::giggle::
Stephen11:      Cal: *strange barfing noise*
Calvin1995:     I know, Steph. I've seen NE!
Stephen11:      Mr Blobby is England's Barney, but worse
DanielC71:      Mr. Blobby?  Sounds like a bad joke from Bladder.
Supahz:         Steph:  Mr Blobby?  Sounds like a good screen name!
Tintagel67:     Can you believe they were selling "Blobby's" at petrol 
                stations?!
Stephen11:      Supahz: Mr Blobby is a strange plastic mauve-spotted 
                creature who bumps into people
Supahz: Steph:  Sounds frightening!
Stephen11:      Tint: nothing could suprise me ...
Stephen11:      Tint: what about Alan Partridge? Seen him?
DanielC71:      Steph: How about a Fry & Laurie parody of Mr B?
Stephen11:      Dan: well, I think better to let him die, frankly...
----------------
GenMelchit:     Stephen - Any theatre here in US?
Stephen11:      Gen: saw The Heiress and Masterclass and Company, which I 
                loved, but no plans myself thought the first time I came 
                to the US was to work on Me & My Girl, a musical I wrote 
                the book for back in 84.
----------------
Holly5120:      Yes, any thoughts?? [on Red Dwarf]
Holly5120:      Hey, I didn't ask it!  I got someone else to do it.  Heh 
                heh, thanks Supahz.
Stephen11:      Supahz: I have a terrible confession to make: I've >never<
                actually seen Red Dwarf -- v. embarrassing since Rob and 
                Doug, the authors are friends of mine. I just never managed 
                to watch, not out of disapproval, but I've always been out 
                whenever it's on.
Calvin1995:     Gasp!
Holly5120:      That's it, I'm outta here!
Stephen11:      Holly: sorry to offend you. Is Red Dwarf bitchingly good 
                then?
Holly5120:      It's in-smegging-credible
Stephen11:      Holly: no >wonder< I haven't seen it. Smegging? Does that 
                mean anything in circumcised-obsessed USA?
DanielC71:      Smegging, i.e. smegma
Holly5120:      Came from the show, not from US
----------------
GenMelchit:     I have a vid called "The Dangerous Brothers" where Rik 
                Mayall and Ade Edmonson apparently interrupt a Fry & Laurie
                sketch.  That wasn't real was it?
Stephen11:      Gen: yes there was a Rik and Ade thing like that. It was 
                part of a series called Saturday Live. Hugh and I did a 
                flower arranging dance and Rick and Ade burst in as the 
                Dangerous Brothers
----------------
Tintagel67:     Stephen, Do you still write for The Gaurdian?
Stephen11:      Tint: It's the Telegraph I used to write for. Did an article 
                about the net for them the other day but don't plan to do 
                anything regular.
----------------
Calvin1995:     I loved Paperweight, BTW...
Stephen11:      Cal: thanks
----------------
Supahz:         Steph: Didn't you know Emma Thompson at university? Any 
                stories?
Stephen11:      Supahz: yes, she introduced me to Hugh in fact. Stories? 
                Well, there was the time she shaved her...
Supahz: Steph:  Shaved her WHAT?
Stephen11:      ... head and we were in the same seminar group on The 
                Winter's Tale and took her hat off to make a point and 
                caused the professor to get terribly upset. She was quite 
                wacky as a girl. I henna-ed my hair at the same time -- 
                strange days.
----------------
DanielC71:      Steph: The sketch in F&L where Hugh takes a spill backwards 
                on a chair...  Was that planned?
Stephen11:      Gen: the chair tilting was planned I'm sorry to say. Glad 
                you thought it wasn't though...
DanielC71:      Steph:  It was me who asked about the chair... :)  The last 
                half of that sketch seemed to be improv[is]ed.  It fooled 
                me & my wife!
Stephen11:      Dan: sorry -- glad you were fooled. Where did you see it. 
                Over here? What channel? Bravo?
Stephen11:      One never knows where things are shown.
DanielC71:      Steph: The only US tape of F&L.
Stephen11:      Dan: Ah -- we shall have to do something about that.
DanielC71:      Steph:  Please!!  :)
DanielC71:      Steph:  Tell you what. Get a PAL to NSTC convertor & we'll 
                pay you $20 per bootleg. Better than royalties!  :)
----------------
Supahz:         Steph: Do you recall any interesting stories from Bladder 
                that you'd like to share?
Stephen11:      Supahz: well, at the risk of sounding boring it was all too 
                hard work to lead to much rich anecdotage. there was the 
                title sequence filming of course ... The original idea was 
                that Tim Macinerney (Darling) and I should take the salute 
                on horseback. When we arrived at Colchester barracks to 
                film, I found I was given the Colonel's horse ... About four 
                hundred hands high, jet black and severaly ungelded. His 
                name was "Thunderbolt" which should have warned me ..
                He was fine at first, but as soon as the band started up 
                with the British Grenadiers which then turned into the 
                Bladder theme tune, he shied like a startled mustang and 
                threatened to unseat me. Hugh and Rowan laughed so much
                at my discomfiture that the filming proved impossible ...
Supahz:         Marjorie's fallen off Thunderbolt!
Stephen11:      Supahz: 10 points for spotting the reference !
----------------
DanielC71:      Steph: Bladder looked like incredible fun. How difficult 
                was to act in (besides Thunderbolt)?
Stephen11:      It was wonderful really; the main trouble was that the 
                scripts were changed all the time until the last moment. 
                John Lloyd, Hugh and I in particualr would rewrite until 
                the final moments we endlessly had "epithet moments" as we
                called them. The kind of jokes which started with "It's 
                about as -- as a --" Sticky the stick insect, that kind of 
                thing, asthamtic ants with particualrly heavy shopping, all
                those sort of jokes. Somehow there was never enough time 
                to get them absolutely right
DanielC71:      There were a lot of those in Bladder 4.
DanielC71:      Hilarious!
Stephen11:      hundreds! This is a big crises -- beat -- I'll go further, 
                it's a twelve story crisis with twenty four hour porterare,
                fitted carpets and a huge sign on the front reading "this 
                is a big crisis" We used to wriggle about screaming with
                adolescent laughter whenever we did those. But some work 
                much better than others. I always liked "you twist and turn 
                like a twisty turny thing"
DanielC71:      "Disease & deprivation stalk are land like two giant... 
                stalking things" is my favorite.
Stephen11:      Then there were the very complicated word play ones
Stephen11:      Like Rik Mayall and the suffragette movement .. anyone 
                remember that? Or the willing suspension of disbelief ...
Calvin1995:     I haven't seen that one in awhile...
GenMelchit:     Suffer a jet movement?
Stephen11:      Gen: that's the one!
Stephen11:      I'm not having anyone staring in disbelief at >my< willy
                suspension. Of course you don't call dicks willies over 
                here. Else how could Free Willy be released? Or Bill C be 
                called Slick Willy?
DanielC71:      The "willy suspension" word-play was fantatsic!
----------------
Supahz:         Steph: There's probably a Brit porno called "Free Willy"!
Stephen11:      I was in a ... hem ... bookstore in the village the other 
                day and saw a porn video called Peter's Friends, which gave
                me quite a turn ...
Holly5120:      Steph: Are you familiar with the poetry of Kingsley Amis?
Stephen11:      Holly: more so after he died sadly ...
Holly5120:      We read his "An Ever-fixed Mark" and it reminded me of 
                "The Liar"
Calvin1995:     The Liar reminds me of Paperweight for some reason...
DanielC71:      Reminds of of "Paperweight" or A paperweight?
Stephen11:      Well, I suppose The Liar and Paperweight being both by me 
                are a bit alike, but one's a novel and the other is lots 
                of "stuff". It's hard to smother one's own voice...
Calvin1995:     Sorry, Stephen. You're gonna kill me for that cheap gag 
                aren't you?
Stephen11:      Cal: not kill. Just bring up a livid bruise perhaps ... 
                just got to go to the other room to get some cigarettes. 
                Back in a sec ...
Stephen11:      AAAAAAAhhhhh -- that's better.
----------------
Stephen11:      Holly: it's important to encourage the young to smoke, 
                don't you think?
DanielC71:      Only if they don't watch your shows! ;)
Holly5120:      What else are they gonna do?
Stephen11:      Nothing like a natural herbal infumation ...
DanielC71:      Holly: A few things spring to mind...
Stephen11:      NYC is turning into quite a non-smoking town, which is a 
                big change from a coupla years ago
----------------
Supahz:         Stephen: I watched Bladder and Dr Who last night and
                dreamed of you as the Doctor.
Stephen11:      Supahz: I do apologise. Send me any laundry bills ...
----------------
Stephen11:      Actually, have had enquiries to my agent from someone in
                Hollywood, Ca who is apparently doing -- What can I say... 
                there had been talk of Rowan playing the Doctor. Dr Who 
                again -- but they've asked just about every Englishman on
                the Equity list so far as I can see.
Stephen11:      Yes, and Eric Idle --
Supahz:         And John Cleese
Stephen11:      All of whom would be spiffing
Supahz:         What next, Dudley Moore?!?
Supahz:         Or David Frost!!!
Stephen11:      I'm not sure if the time hasn't passed however. Never go 
                back, surely. Wish people were spending as much time in 
                thinking up new material as in rejiggin the old.
Calvin1995:     Someone suggested Miranda Richardson as the Doctor
Holly5120:      Chris Barrie!
Kmtrillian:     A female doctor - now that would be something!
Stephen11:      Miranda R! Good call. And Chris Barrie, who started life 
                as an impressionist could prolly do it well.
Supahz:         But Rowan with Baldrick as a companion makes sense.
Stephen11:      Km: ah, DNA(4) is a good chum -- he's devoting most of his 
                time to the net these days and giving up on books, sad to
                say. But I don't blame him.
----------------
Stephen11:      Km trillian -- is that a Hitchikers reference?
Kmtrillian:     Yes, it is.
----------------
DanielC71:      Steph: What beer do you drink?
Stephen11:      Dan: well, I like English Ales mostly. Ruddles, especially. 
                Over here Sam Adams is quite good.
Supahz:         Rutles?!?
DanielC71:      Have you tried McEwan's Scotch Ale?
Stephen11:      Supahz: well Ruddles is made in Rutland, the county that 
                inspired the Rutles. After Python, Eric Idle did this series
                called Rutland Weekend Television -- the point being that 
                Rutland is the smallest county in the UK. And The Rutles
                was the same team doing a spoof doco. It was repeated the 
                other day on Com Central and really holds up. Made it 
                impossible to watch the  Beatles Anthology without 
                giggling ...
----------------
Supahz:         I am a huge Python fan.... they started my interest in 
                British Comedy.
Calvin1995:     Python started for me, too
DanielC71:      Python Primer of British Pomposity
Kmtrillian:     Python started it for me, too - also the HHGG books.
----------------
Stephen11:      The apartment I've bought here was found for me by JC who 
                lives here too sometimes
Supahz:         Wow!
Calvin1995:     Cool!
DanielC71:      Someone should have told the Beatles to shut up early in 
                the Anth. and just play...
Stephen11:      He's just made a new movie and is >very< worried about it
DanielC71:      Tell JC hi for us!
Supahz:         The Wanda sequel?
DanielC71:      Night of the Living Wanda
Stephen11:      Same cast but not a sequel exactly.
Stephen11:      Original title: Death Fish 2
Stephen11:      Now called Fierce Creatures. A lot of it takes place in and
                around a zoo. Mike Palin, Kevin Kline, J. Leigh Curtis, 
                etc. Also Robert Lindsay
----------------
GenMelchit:     Stephen - How about Fawty Towers? It's a favorite of mine.
Stephen11:      Fawlty Towers. Now you're talking. Only 12 half hours, but 
                every one perfect.
Stephen11:      If only comedy were easier ..
Tintagel67:     Especially "The Germans"
Tintagel67:     "Don't mention the war"
GenMelchit:     Tint - You started it!
----------------
Supahz:         I saw Lenny Henry's "Chef" the other night and they did a 
                silly walk.
Stephen11:      Yes, Chef not too hot IMHO ...
DanielC71:      Steph: I agree.
Calvin1995:     I loved the one with Mrs. Richards (name escapes me)
Holly5120:      JC gets upset very well
----------------
GenMelchit:     Have you seen "How to Irritate People?"
Stephen11:      Gen: yes, that's on video out here, I believe
Stephen11:      Shoelss Jo had a batting average of 356 apparently
DanielC71:      Except the sketch w/ JC, GC as dad, and that awful Mom.... ]
                kind of like a Portrait of Basil as a Young Man.
----------------
Supahz:         Steph:  Any fave sketches from F&L?
Stephen11:      Supahz: golly. Favourites? Hugh and I have a very soft spot
                for the Mr Dalliard ones ... also the kick-arse businessmen 
                with Marjorie ...
Supahz:         Steph:  Damn it to hell and back!
Supahz:         Damn blast and double damn!
Stephen11:      Damn and double damn with a side-order of damn
DanielC71:      "Good God, there's 7 million people out there." "Oh really, 
                what do they want?"
DanielC71:      Best line in the whole sketch, among many funny lines.
Stephen11:      You had a wife I believe what happened to her? Henrietta. 
                Did, he, I'm sorry to hear that.
Calvin1995:     I love the sketch with the sound names! Hilarious!
Stephen11:      Oh, the dropping of the cigarette lighter etc? YES, we 
                enjoyed that ...
Supahz:         Steph: Henrietta is a great line! I also really like the
                "bloopers" sketch.
Stephen11:      Hugh is very good at being hit.
----------------
Stephen11:      In Bladder the Third there was an ep where Rowan and I kept
                hitting him ...
Supahz:         When you were Wellington.
DanielC71:      The last ep.
Stephen11:      People don't realise often that the skill in screen 
                violence comes from the receiver not the puncher
DanielC71:      That was the first time we heard a Melchitt bellow.
Stephen11:      Yes, Wellington, that's the one. Rather weird ending I 
                recall -- lots of dead bodies -- Baaaah
DanielC71:      God, I love that Bellow!
Supahz:         And HRH saying "penguin"!
Calvin1995:     Bladder didn't die -- I was so surprised...
DanielC71:      No kidding!
Stephen11:      Dan: all down to smoking and asthma I fear ...
----------------
Stephen11:      Eek -- it's getting on for 4:15, I have to be somewhere at 
                4:30, I'm afeared, as Walter Brennan would say, that I 
                have to go in 5 --
Supahz:         Steph: Thanks for the time.  You're very gracious and kind.
GenMelchit:     Stephen - Thank you so much for coming!
DanielC71:      Well, Stephen, have a day!
Tintagel67:     Ditto
Holly5120:      Nice chatting with you!
Calvin1995:     Thanks, Stephen! It was great abusing you!
Stephen11:      Sheesh, don't be silly. A pleasure. I'm only sorry I let 
                you down last week.
DanielC71:      It was fantastic being able to cyberspeak w/ you!
IFDA:           Thank you, Stephen!
DanielC71:      Come back and see us again, y'hear?
Stephen11:      Such a pleasure to talk with nice, polite, shiny-toothed,
                well-scrubbed Americans --
Supahz:         Yes, please do!
Stephen11:      I'll be back (in bad Arnie to]nes)
Holly5120:      Well, we do our best
Stephen11:      Lots of love to you all, BAAAA-AAAAAAH
Stephen11:      XXX
