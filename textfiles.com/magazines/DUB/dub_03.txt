                           -=> Editor's Note <=-

The Dub Project complies and makes available this monitor of hip hop culture
in the mainstream media.  The goal of this guide is to increase the visibility
of the hip hop community worldwide.  While this guide is an not an exhaustive
resource, it is a useful compendium of many resources and can be a helpful
reference for a true hip hopper surfing cyberspace.  This resource contains
articles from other sources for analysis and discussion.

The Dub Project is now involved in building a place for hip hop within the
emerging information infrastructure.  If you are interested in becoming a
member of the Dub Project, which is involved in the creation of this extensive
public-access hip hop database, please inform us.

                        -=> No Trends Allowed <=-

Opio, talking-dread for hip-hop troupe Souls of Mischief, is tired of being
compared to and lumped with the "west coast sound" or The Pharcyde, just
because they hail from California and there are four Black guys (Opio,
Phesto, A-Plus and Tajai) in the crew.

Check it out, East Oakland is HQ for Souls of Mischief which is at least
_several miles away from_ The Pharcyde's South Central.  _Furthermore,_ says
Opio, "We don't like to be compared [to anybody] because we're doin'
somethin' that's new."  Everybody be sayin' that but if you listen to our
music and you listen to the lyrics you can tell that we doin' somethin' new."

They exploded on the scene with brilliant single (and title track) "93 'til
Infinity" last year and the album promised to be strong (like, say, _The
Pharcyde..._).  But much to the dismay of many a B-boy, "93 'til Infinity"
the album, was a bit of a let-down and this relative disappointment probably
won't get any precious metal props.

"We're just lyrically innovative," he says.  "the lyrics are comin' from all
angles.  They're very animated.  It's not the same old hum-drum lyrics.  We
use so-called big words but it's not like we just use big words for the sake
of using big words.  We just have a knowledge of the English language so we
use every aspect [of it].  It just makes the raps better, more expressive, I
guess.  And the beats, you know, new samples."

These self-styled masters of originality aren't down for the abstract tip
_just because_ and Opio rips into "art rap" like a MAC 10 on auto rips
through--oh, never mind.  Why?  'Cos most of you peons wouldn't get it
anyways.  "We like to be creative but we don't like to go to the fuckin'
extremes where we lose people, you know?" he says.

"Muthafuckas like Me Phi Me and some shit like that, who're like saying that
they're breaking new boundaries in rap and shit like that.  That ain't rap,
you know what I'm saying?  He rhymin' and whatever but if you ask the
hip-hop nigga or someone who listens to rap--muthafuckas ain't tryin' to
hear that shit at all."

And Souls aren't "gangsta" or "old school" or "jazzy-style" either, he says
dismissively.  No trends allowed.  The Hieroglyphics clan of which they are
a part includes varied producers and artists like Domino (not the Long Beach
G), Del tha Funkee Homosapien and Casual.  Opio describes them as family who
work on each other's albums.  "On every album they produce tracks.  We have
our own distinct style because we use original samples.  You know, muthafuckas 
been makin' beats and doin' this shit for a long-ass time.  It's not like we
just jumped in here and we, like, new jacks.  We understand the whole
culture and shit so niggas know what they doin' when they get to the studio."

                        Part One of a Ten Part Series
