                         Guidelines for Writers (11/94)
                         ------------------------------

     -- Fiction - We want any non-genre fiction, meaning no sci-fi or horror,
stories that say something about the present life we live in.  We have nothing
against genre fiction; we just feel that there are enough e-zines out there for
that market.  Good models for our kind of fiction: Anton Chekhov, Raymond
Carver, John Cheever, Susan Minot, also known as "mainstream" or "literary"
fiction.  Don't let the big names scare you; almost everyone we publish is a
beginning writer.  Submit and let us see the manuscript; at the very worst, we
won't take it.  On the other hand, as we've done countless times before, we'll
accept it and it will go into print.  The only way you will lose is if you just
let the story gather dust somewhere(real dust or e-dust).

     -- Poetry - We want any non-genre poetry.  Poems that have a *story* and
not mere "life is like a box of chocolates" two-bit-metaphors are strongly
recommended for submission.  We prefer free verse; there's nothing worse than
forced rhymes, which tend to sound gimmicky and end up as self-parodies(but this
does not mean you should not submit formal verse; if you think your poems are
good, go ahead and let us see it).  Good models: check out magazines like The
New Yorker.  About 1/4 of those are what we call "story poems."

     -- Essays/nonfiction -- Any subject, as long as it is
quality writing.

     -- Plays and allied forms are also welcome.  Again, no genre pieces.


-- The nitty-gritty when it comes to submissions:

     1. Please include your name and the approximate word count
        of your work.  The manuscript must be in plain ASCII text.
     2. Unless it is obvious, please categorize your submission
        as fiction, poetry, or nonfiction.
     3. Include a short biography with each submission.
     4. Send to: WHIRLEDS@delphi.com.
     5. We will not accept previously published material, whether
        they were published electronically or on paper.  Whirlwind will
        accept only new, unpublished works.

                        Other Business
                        --------------

-- Payment
     Since Whirlwind is distributed freely, it does not pay its authors.

-- Method of Publication
     Whirlwind is published in both ASCII and PostScript formats.

-- Back Issues
     If you use FTP/Gopher, back issues are available at
          ftp.etext.org       in  /pub/Zines/Whirlwind.

-- Rights
     All Whirlwind writers retain the copyright to their story.
The actual issue of Whirlwind is copyrighted by us, but all
future rights to your story belongs to you.  We only ask that if
you do get it placed somewhere else that you mention our
magazine.

-- First Serial Rights
     Realize that some magazines out there may not accept your
story after it has been published in Whirlwind.  Just because
this is electronic publishing does not mean it is not a form of
publication.  In many editor's eyes, it is most certainly a valid
medium of publication.  Just a friendly warning.

-- Subscription
     If you wish to be on the Whirlwind mailing list, all you
need to do is send a message to WHIRLEDS@delphi.com with the subject
of the message "SUBSCRIBE WHIRLWIND" and nothing else in the body of
the message.

-- Further Questions

     If you have any more questions, you can reach us at
WHIRLEDS@delphi.com.  Thank you for your time.
