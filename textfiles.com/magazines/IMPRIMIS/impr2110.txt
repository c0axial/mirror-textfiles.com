                  "Why 'Good Government' Isn't Enough"
            by Alan L. Keyes, Former U.N. Special Ambassador
            and President,Citizens Against Government Waste

                     ------------------------------
        
        Preview: Why, despite all our efforts to reform
        Congress, control spending, reduce taxes and pay off
        the national debt, are we in worse shape than ever?
        Alan Keyes argues that we have relied too much on
        politicians and too little on our own initiative.
        
             We need to restore stringent limits on Washington,
        D.C. Two hundred years ago, the Founders knew that
        government was a threat to liberty. Prophetically, they
        warned future generations not to grow too dependent on
        it.
        
             Ambassador Keyes spoke at Shavano Institute for
        National Leadership seminars last May in Cincinnati,
        Ohio and this month in Pebble Beach, California. To

                     ------------------------------
        
        The national debt reached three trillion dollars in
        March of 1990. But that wasn't all of the bad news:
        experts predicted that within five months it would pass
        the three and a half trillion mark. Think about that
        for a moment: It took the entire history of our nation-
        -over two centuries--for the debt to reach three
        trillion dollars and five months later we were told we
        could expect an increase of another half trillion. In
        1992, the debt will reach four trillion dollars.
        
        
                         How the Debt Adds Up:
                    A Billion Here, a Billion There
        
        Can you recall how a rocket shimmers as it leaves the
        ground and then starts to streak into the sky so fast
        that it is impossible to follow with the naked eye?
        Well, that is our national debt. It is well past the
        shimmering stage, and it is streaking out of sight.
        Americans have every right to be frightened and angry
        about this. The debt is not an abstraction. It is real,
        just like a rocket. But our politicians have been
        dealing with big numbers for so long that they seem to
        have forgotten. It is nothing for them to routinely
        round off numbers to the nearest million or billion
        dollars.
        
             I know this from personal experience. I once had a
        lowly position at the State Department as assistant
        secretary for international organizations. My office
        dealt with the U.S. contribution to the United Nations
        and, as this amounted to something less than a billion
        dollars a year, it was regarded as a drop in the
        bucket. We simply did not enter upon the radar screen
        of serious government. Nonetheless, the higher-ups
        tried to make it easy, so by the time budget and
        accounting memos got to us, thousands of dollars and
        very often tens of thousands of dollars would have
        disappeared from sight in the rounding-off process.
        
             This is the rule for virtually all federal
        agencies and departments. Collectively, they deal every
        day in hundreds of billions of dollars. So they are not
        rounding off just thousands and tens of thousands; they
        are rounding off tens of billions of dollars. The
        people in individual offices who are making budget
        decisions never see the missing figures, and in truth
        they never think about them much.
        
             In this context it becomes very easy to forget
        that a "hundred" in the memo you're reading represents
        a hundred million. Why, that's not even one billion,
        you might say once you had been in Washington awhile.
        You get into that habit. And it is a habit that reveals
        a great deal about the transformation that takes place
        when an individual spends a lot of time working in and
        around the federal government.
        
             But most voters think, "Ah, if only we could send
        really good people to Washington, they won't develop
        those habits. And then, finally, we'll have good
        government." It is true that sending good people to
        Washington is essential to good government. I do not
        for one moment want to minimize the importance of this.
        But neither good people nor "good government" are
        enough. We send good people to Washington all the time,
        and they hail from every state in the Union. They are
        competent, successful people loaded with integrity,
        courage and common sense (at least before they get to
        our nation's capital). We have even had "good
        government" as it is defined by those in
        government. Why, then, is Washington such a mess?
        
        
                        Out-of-Control Spending
                            and Entitlements
        
        One obvious reason is the sheer size of the federal
        budget. In January of 1992, President Bush unveiled his
        proposed budget for the 1993 fiscal year. As the Wall
        Street Journal noted, the Democrats in Congress
        pronounced it "dead on arrival." It was just too low.
        What was low to them? The total (rounded, of course, to
        the nearest hundred million dollars) was
        $1,516,700,000,000--one trillion, five hundred sixteen
        billion, seven hundred million dollars. That is more
        than 25 percent of the nation's GNP.
        
             And what about off-budget entitlements, the monies
        the federal government is already committed to spend
        but that the public never hears about? These amount to
        $4-6 trillion in civil and military pensions, Social
        Security payments and other unfunded liabilities.
        
        
                         Regulation and Taxes:
                         The Power to Destroy
        
        But that is not all. Government regulation is another
        kind of hidden expenditure that never shows up in any
        proposed budget. The National Chamber Foundation
        reported in mid-1992 that regulatory costs passed along
        to the consumer in the form of higher prices total $400
        billion each year, or an average of $4000 per
        household.
        
             As if that weren't enough, direct taxation, added
        to Social Security payroll deductions for employers and
        employees, is now a staggering 52-60 percent of the
        GNP. These figures were virtually ensured in 1990 when
        President Bush retreated from his personal tax pledge
        and cooperated with Congress to pass a so-called
        "deficit reduction package." The price was $200 billion
        (to date) in new tax increases. The outraged American
        public was assured that these would be solely devoted
        to reducing the deficit and that there would be
        significant spending cuts at all levels.
        
             But many people were skeptical. I, for one, wrote
        at the time that the more we heard them talk about
        deficit reduction in Washington, the less of it we
        should expect to see. Words are a distraction from
        deeds in Washington. And the skepticism proved to be
        well founded. Congress slid out from under the Gramm
        Rudman deficit reduction law and ever since has been
        producing the largest deficits in American history:
        $280 billion in 1991 and $400 billion in 1992.
        
        One of the interesting sidebars to this story involves
        the "luxury tax" which was a minor part of the deficit
        reduction package. This new tax ended up literally
        crippling the boat-building industry. It also led to
        massive layoffs, putting more than thirty thousand
        people on the unemployment rolls, and adversely
        affected dozens of other related industries.
        Ironically, the luxury tax proved to cost more money
        than it raised in tax revenues. It should remind us
        that the power to tax is the power to destroy.
        
        
                            Government Waste
        
        Then there is the huge problem of government waste. In
        1990, the Comptroller General of the General Accounting
        Office estimated that the federal government wastes
        $180 billion annually. At the time, this was enough
        money to fund the state budgets of forty-eight out of
        the fifty states. And, since the GAO only watches what
        Congress tells it to watch, we can only imagine the
        waste that goes unreported.
        
             Here is one example uncovered by Citizens Against
        Government Waste. The U.S. Navy regularly sinks old
        ships in its artificial-reef-and-sink program.
        Thousands of items are left on board, from mattresses,
        pots and pans to heavy equipment and machinery. A
        congressman wrote to the Navy Department sensibly
        pointing out that these could be salvaged. The Navy
        replied loftily that the $57 million involved didn't
        justify the effort. It makes you wonder: What amount
        would justify the effort? A hundred million dollars?
        
             Apparently not at the Defense Department's
        Logistics Agency, which spent $250 million putting in
        an elaborate computer system that was supposed to help
        it keep track of its purchases and prevent it from
        acquiring unneeded inventory. But, according to a GAO
        survey, it ended up purchasing $3.5 billion in unneeded
        inventory anyway, including a thirty-three year supply
        of size 12 women's blouses. (We couldn't have begun to
        use up that supply of blouses even if all of the
        service personnel that we had sent to the Persian Gulf
        had been women who wore size 12.)
        
        
                             It's Our Money
        
        This kind of story seems pretty funny, until you
        remember whose money is going to waste. I was doing a
        radio interview recently when a listener called in to
        complain about the savings and loan scandal. He went on
        for five minutes about what an awful travesty it was.
        Every now and again I would mutter encouragingly so
        that he would realize that I was a receptive audience.
        Finally, he concluded by saying that the one thing he
        really didn't understand was why "we, the American
        taxpayers, have to foot the bill. Why don't we just let
        government do it?"
        
             It's our money, whether it is tens of billions
        that will be spent on bailing out savings and loans, or
        $57 million wasted by the Navy, or $3.5 billion in
        unneeded Defense Department inventory. But we--and
        those good people we keep on sending to Washington--
        have made the same mistake as the radio caller. Time
        and time again, we have been content to "let the
        government do it."
        
             Think about what our money is. Our money is our
        children's education. It is the roof over our heads. It
        is the ability to think ahead to years into the future,
        to plan what we might do, for ourselves, our children,
        our community and our nation. It allows us to feel both
        the burden and the privilege of responsibility. Our
        money is the basis of our ability to translate our
        will, our choices and our values into action. In a real
        sense, it is the foundation of self government and of a
        free society. And the more that our money is removed
        from our control, the less responsibility we exercise,
        the less freedom we enjoy.
        
             It is not that we send bad people to Washington
        who are doing bad things. True, there are some who are
        abusing their positions, but most are simply using them
        in ways that come perfectly naturally. We put them in a
        system where success depends not upon the results
        produced but upon how much money is controlled and how
        many people are commanded, so we shouldn't be surprised
        that their greatest interest in life is controlling
        more money and commanding more people.
        
             Nor should we be surprised that they help maintain
        the very network of political and bureaucratic
        patronage that they were elected to fight. They try
        their hardest not to roll back big government, but to
        "make it work." In short, our congressmen and senators
        are no longer our representatives; they are sales
        agents for "good government," i.e., government with
        ever-expanding power over the lives of you and me and
        our children.
        
        
                    The Flawed Nature of Government
        
        The disjunction of interest between us and the people
        we send to Washington doesn't arise because of one
        particular circumstance. It has become endemic to the
        system. Even if all the problems I have outlined were
        solved, we still cannot elect good people, send them
        off to Washington and expect them to do good things for
        us.
        
             America's Founders warned as much. At the
        Constitutional Convention in 1787, annual elections
        were seriously considered as one possible method of
        keeping a tight rein on the nation's representatives,
        and at the time most states handled their own elections
        this way. The attitude was: "We must keep a constant
        and watchful eye on our representatives and curb the
        worst excesses of government." It was not: "Once we
        elect worthy public servants, we will trust them to do
        good things with government."
        
             The Founders knew that, worthy public servants
        aside, government by nature tends toward excess. It is
        a necessary evil to provide for the common defense, to
        promote the general welfare, to do those things as
        President Lincoln later said that cannot be done by
        individuals and enterprises singly. There may be times
        when we have to use this instrument, just as doctors
        were once wont to include small amounts of arsenic in
        their prescriptions, but massive doses can be fatal.
        
             And, whatever may be our good impulses as a
        people, those impulses alone are incapable of
        controlling the fundamental tendency of government
        toward excess and abuse. Contrary to what another
        President, Jimmy Carter, promised, we shall never have
        a government that is as good as its people, and we
        should never wish for one.
        
             What is self government about, after all? What is
        this society about? They certainly are not about
        producing a utopia through the instrument of the state.
        Even if government could produce all that it promises,
        we would not want those results on the terms they are
        offered. They are terms that require that we surrender
        a good that is more important than good results: our
        freedom to make choices. We should still have enough
        pride in ourselves as individuals and as a people to
        want to shape our own destiny.
        
        
                        The Return to Individual
                        and Local Responsibility
        
        As citizens empowered to govern ourselves we should
        also be willing to reassert our role on a community
        level. And it is high time we did so. In the course of
        the last fifty years there has not been one new local
        government incorporated in the United States. The life
        blood of this system is drying up.
        
             When Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about America in
        the 1830s, he tried to explain what he thought was
        responsible for its astounding success. One of the key
        factors he pointed to was the vitality and primacy of
        government at the local level. Government at the local
        level is the intersection between private enterprise
        and government power--where the latter remains to some
        degree answerable to the former. At the state and
        federal levels the primary interest of government is
        government. The people become merely the servants of
        its appetites.
        
             We must return as much power as possible to
        individuals and to local government. For starters, we
        need term limitations and a properly worded and
        conceived balanced budget amendment. (It is not enough
        to tell Congress that it must balance the budget. Left
        to its own devices, Congress will balance the budget on
        the backs of the taxpayers and/or by creating more and
        more off-budget entitlements and regulations.)
        
             And we citizens have to become our own watchdogs
        once more. We need taxpayer commissions to give
        critical scrutiny to the reports of government watchdog
        agencies like the GAO and to do some investigating of
        their own. (Right now, we are spending millions of
        dollars on reports that tell us how the government is
        wasting our money when those reports themselves are a
        primary example of waste because nothing is done about
        them, or because they are deliberately slanted to
        please the agencies and departments they are
        evaluating.)
        
             We also have to hold government accountable for
        spending our money. Politicians and bureaucrats talk a
        lot about "government resources," but they are ours.
        Like greedy guests sponging off their host in a swank
        restaurant, they are reading off a menu with no prices
        when they plan new budgets and new programs. But we are
        the host. We foot the bill. We need to insist on seeing
        all the prices up front.
        
             Revitalizing local government, term limitation,
        taxpayer commissions, fiscal accountability--these are
        practical and realizable goals. But there is nothing
        that can be done to reform the system that will
        substitute for the grass-roots mobilization of people
        around the country. For our government is "of the
        people, by the people and for the people," and we must
        not let it perish.
