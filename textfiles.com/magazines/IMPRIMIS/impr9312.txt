        Preview: For over 2,000 years, the Star of Bethlehem
        has been a powerful symbol of the Christian faith.
        This unique story, told here by astronomer Craig
        Chester, was originally presented at Hillsdale
        College's Center for Constructive Alternatives Seminar
        "Man and Creation--Perspectives on Science and
        Religion," in the fall of 1992.

                   The Story of the Star in the East
        
        Someone once observed, "The universe is composed of
        stories, not atoms." The Star of Bethlehem is certainly
        a story (as is most of the Bible, first and foremost).
        It is a mystery and a puzzle, involving not only
        theology and astronomy, but also history and even
        astrology.[1] It is an attempt of men to understand not
        the universe at large, but specific events, or "What I
        Saw."
        
             What do we know about the Star of Bethlehem? The
        popular conception is summarized in the Christmas
        carol:
        
             We three kings of Orient are/Bearing gifts we
             traverse afar, Field and fountain, moor and
             mountain/Following yonder star.
        
             O star of wonder, star of night/Star with royal
             beauty bright, Westward leading, still
             proceeding/Guide us to thy perfect light.
        
             We all know those lines as the story of the Star,
        which is fine--except for the fact that almost
        everything in it is wrong. The actual New Testament
        account of the Star of Bethlehem comes from the second
        chapter of the Gospel of Matthew (told here in the
        Revised English Bible translation):
        
             Jesus was born at Bethlehem in Judaea during the
             reign of Herod. After his birth astrologers [Magi]
             from the east arrived in Jerusalem, asking, "Where
             is the newborn king of the Jews? We observed the
             rising of his star, and we have come to pay him
             homage." King Herod was greatly perturbed when he
             heard this, and so was the whole of Jerusalem. He
             called together the chief priests and scribes of
             the Jews and asked them where the Messiah was to
             be born. "At Bethlehem in Judaea," they replied,
             "for this is what the prophet wrote: 'Bethlehem in
             the land of Judah, you are by no means least among
             the rulers of Judah; for out of you shall come a
             ruler to be the shepherd of my people Israel.' "
        
             Then Herod summoned the astrologers to meet him
             secretly, and ascertained from them the exact time
             when the star had appeared. He sent them to
             Bethlehem, and said, "Go and make a careful search
             for the child, and when you have found him, bring
             me word, so that I may go myself and pay him
             homage."
        
             After hearing what the king had to say they set
             out; there before them was the star they had seen
             rising, and it went ahead of them until it stopped
             above the place where the child lay. They were
             overjoyed at the sight of it and, entering the
             house, they saw the child with Mary his mother and
             bowed low in homage to him; they opened their
             treasure chests and presented gifts to him: gold,
             frankincense, and myrrh. Then they returned to
             their own country by another route, for they had
             been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod.
        
             What is your initial reaction to this story? It
        seems to me that it is not a fabulous tale. That is, it
        does not conjure up fantastic details or images, and it
        is told in a rather mundane fashion, not at all like a
        fable. It is also the only account we have of it in our
        Bible. Later, various non-canonical sources did
        elaborate on it. Books like the Protevangelium of James
        and an epistle of Ignatius say this star was the
        brightest star in the sky, brighter than all other
        stars combined, even in-cluding the sun and the moon,
        which bowed down before it. But Matthew is very matter-
        of-fact.[2]
        
        
                       The Historical Perspective
        
        To understand this story, we must view it in the
        context of its time. Who were these Magi? Where did
        they come from? Magi is the plural of Magus, the root
        of our word magic; "court astrologer" is probably the
        best translation. "Wise men" is also a good term,
        descriptive of the esteem in which they were widely
        held. The group of Magi in question (it is the
        Christmas carol, not Matthew, that refers to three of
        them) came "from the east." They might have been
        Zoroastrians, Medes, Persians, Arabs, or even Jews.
        They served as court advisors, making forecasts and
        predictions for their royal patrons based on their
        study of the stars, about which they were quite
        knowledgeable. Magi often wandered from court to court,
        and it was not unusual for them to cover great
        distances in order to attend the birth or crowning of a
        king, paying their respects and offering gifts. It is
        not surprising, therefore, that Matthew would mention
        them as validation of Jesus' kingship, or that Herod
        would regard their arrival as a very serious matter.[3]
        
             When might these Magi have appeared in Judaea?
        Obviously, determining the story's date is important if
        we are to look for astronomical connections. We might
        assume that it was around 1 b.c. or 1 a.d., since that
        is when, by conventional reckoning, Jesus was born. But
        the calendar on which these dates are based was set by
        the Roman monk Dionysius Exiguus in the year 525 a.d.,
        long after the fact. Scholars writing in the first and
        second centuries a.d. asserted that Jesus was born
        between what we now call 4 b.c. and 1 b.c. They were
        living much closer to the event and had access to
        thousands of historical records in many excellent
        libraries, and their opinions probably should be given
        much more weight than has been common.
        
             How about the time of the year? The best clue is a
        passage in the Book of Luke:
        
             And there were in the same country shepherds
             abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their
             flock by night.
        
             If the reference to "fields" is accurate-- not
        pastures or holding pens--we might guess at a date in
        late summer or early fall, for it was customary for
        farmers to allow sheep and cattle to graze the stubble
        in the fields following the harvest. This clue is
        suggestive, but hardly definitive.
        
             One difficulty in seeking a precise date is the
        fact that Matthew reports two separate sightings,
        possibly separated by a substantial time. First, the
        Magi saw the Star rising en anatole, best translated as
        "rising in the east," the ancient technical term for an
        acronical rising, when an object rises at sunset and is
        visible all night. After they come to Jerusalem--we do
        not know how long that took, and there is no indication
        that the Star was in any way involved with the journey-
        -they see the Star again as they travel the few miles
        to Bethlehem:
        
             There before them was the star they had seen
             rising, and it went ahead of them until it stopped
             above the place where the child lay.
        
             There was no need for a bright or supernatural
        guiding light to find Bethlehem from Jerusalem; it lies
        just five miles south on the main road. There is a
        reference not to the "house" of an infant (brephos in
        the Greek) but of a paidion, or toddler, indicating
        that some months may have elapsed since the birth
        itself.
        
             What are the astronomical possibilities? This
        question has been asked many times since the Christian
        apologist Origen first raised it around 250 a.d.  It is
        safe to say that every astronomical event known to have
        occurred during, say, the decade of interest has at
        some point been proposed as the Star of Bethlehem.
        
             The key point to answering this question is to
        note that it is not just any astronomical event that is
        of interest. We can restrict our inquiry to those
        appearances that would have had astrological
        significance to the Magi, who declared:
        
             "We observed the rising of his star, and we have
             come to pay him homage."
        
             An astronomical event may not have been very
        obvious at all; certainly it was not obvious to Herod.
        Had it been an incomparably bright object, as later
        writers thought, there would be numerous written
        records of it. It is much more plausible that the Star
        of Bethlehem went unnoticed by all but a few experts
        such as the Magi.
        
        
                           The Death of Herod
        
        A major key to the chronology is the date of the death
        of Herod, who figures prominently in our story. Herod
        was alive when the Star of Bethlehem appeared and the
        commonly quoted date for his death is 4 b.c.4 Thus
        dates of 7 b.c. through 4 b.c. are often given for the
        birth of Jesus. The political events of this period are
        best known from the writings of Josephus Flavius, the
        Jewish historian who lived from 37 a.d. to about 95
        a.d. His testimony has always been considered vital in
        determining these dates. But the accounts of Josephus
        and the entire history of this period have been
        reassessed recently, with important new results, by
        Ernest Martin, whose book, The Star that Astonished the
        World, has become the authoritative source on the
        subject.[5]
        
             According to Josephus, on the night of a lunar
        eclipse Herod executed two rabbis. They were accused of
        inciting some young men to climb up on the wall and
        tear down the golden eagle that the king had ordered
        placed on the gate to the Temple in Jerusalem. This
        eagle was, of course, an abomination to the Jews
        because it was a graven image. Soon Herod himself died
        and was buried. One of his sons inherited his throne,
        shortly after which Passover was celebrated. It was
        long believed that the lunar eclipse in question
        occurred on March 13 in 4 b.c. But this was only a
        partial eclipse (40 percent total) and fairly hard to
        detect. And it occurred only 29 days before Passover.
        Here is what would have had to happen in those 29 days:
        
             Herod was sick at the time of the execution of the
        rabbis and his condition worsened almost immediately.
        He was treated for a time by his physicians, to no
        avail. Herod then decided to pack up the royal
        household and move to Jericho to take the baths. He
        tried the baths unsuccessfully for some days and then
        returned to Jerusalem. Believing that he soon would
        die, Herod came up with a diabolical plan to insure
        that all of Israel would mourn his death, in spite of
        his unpopularity. He commanded the leading men from
        around the country to come to Jerusalem; there he
        imprisoned them in the Hippodrome and ordered the army
        to execute them as soon as he was dead. Israel would
        indeed mourn. (Fortunately, the order was not carried
        out.)
        
             In the meantime, word arrived from Rome that Herod
        had the Emperor's permission to execute his rebellious
        son Antipater, and he promptly complied. Five days
        later he died, but not before decreeing that his was to
        be the largest funeral ever held in the history of the
        world. His body was embalmed. The army was assembled to
        carry his body in the funeral procession to a burial
        site some 25 miles away. The soldiers walked in bare
        feet, as was required when in mourning, traveling one
        mile a day. A legate from Rome, where word of Herod's
        death had been received, arrived to protect the royal
        treasury. Finally, Herod's son Archelaus was crowned
        king and had time to issue a few decrees prior to the
        celebration of Passover.
        
             The 29 days between the eclipse of 4 b.c. and the
        following Passover simply do not allow enough time for
        all of this to have happened. A minimum of ten weeks
        would have been required. But on January 10, 1 b.c.,
        there was a total lunar eclipse visible in Palestine,
        and it occurred twelve and a half weeks before
        Passover. As Martin points out, there are other
        compelling reasons to regard 1 b.c. as the true date of
        Herod's death. For example, the War of Varus, known to
        have followed Herod's death, can be redated to 1 b.c.,
        where it fits the other known facts perfectly.
        
             If we conclude that Herod did die in the spring of
        1 b.c., we are free to add the years 3 b.c. and 2 b.c.
        to our search for the Star of Bethlehem. What was
        happening then? The year 2 b.c. marked the 25th
        anniversary of Caesar Augustus's rule and the 750th
        anniversary of the founding of Rome. Huge celebrations
        were planned. The whole empire was at peace. The doors
        of the temple of Janus were closed for only the third
        time in Roman history. To honor their emperor, the
        people were to rise as one and name Augustus pater
        patriae, or "Father of the Country." Now, getting the
        people of an empire to do something "spontaneously"
        requires a great deal of organization. And so an
        enrollment, or census, was ordered:
        
             In those days, a decree went out from Caesar
             Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
             And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city.
        
             This enrollment, described in the Gospel of Luke,
        which brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, always has
        been a mystery since no regular taxation census
        occurred at this time. But the pater patriae enrollment
        fits perfectly.
        
        
                      The Astronomical Perspective
        
        What astronomical events, possibly in the years 3 or 2
        b.c., might have been related to the Star of Bethlehem?
        
             Novae have been suggested, the unexpected, sudden
        brightening of a star from invisibility into a bright
        object for a period of days or weeks. There is no
        historical record of such a nova, nor is it clear what
        a nova's astrological significance would be. Comets are
        candidates, for they appear sporadically, move, and
        even seem to point down to the earth. (This was
        Origen's choice.) But the recorded comets around this
        time, even Halley's Comet in 12 b.c., were not very
        impressive; astrologically, they were considered
        ominous. Meteors and fireballs are even less likely
        candidates.
        
             Conjunctions of planets have long been considered
        good possibilities. A conjunction is a close apparent
        approach between two celestial objects. Technically
        speaking, a conjunction occurs at the moment when both
        objects have the same celestial longitude; one is due
        north of the other. The closer the objects, the more
        visually impressive is the event and the more
        significant astrologically. In 3 b.c. and 2 b.c., there
        was a series of close conjunctions involving Jupiter,
        the planet that represented kingship, coronations, and
        the birth of kings. In Hebrew, Jupiter was known as
        Sedeq or "Righteousness," a term also used for the
        Messiah.
        
             In September of 3 b.c., Jupiter came into
        conjunction with Regulus, the star of kingship, the
        brightest star in the constellation of Leo. Leo was the
        constellation of kings, and it was associated with the
        Lion of Judah. The royal planet approached the royal
        star in the royal constellation representing Israel.
        Just a month earlier, Jupiter and Venus, the Mother
        planet, had almost seemed to touch each other in
        another close conjunction, also in Leo. Then the
        conjunction between Jupiter and Regulus was repeated,
        not once but twice, in February and May of 2 b.c.
        Finally, in June of 2 b.c., Jupiter and Venus, the two
        brightest objects in the sky save the sun and the moon,
        experienced an even closer encounter when their disks
        appeared to touch; to the naked eye they became a
        single object above the setting sun. This exceptionally
        rare spectacle could not have been missed by the Magi.
        
             In fact, we have seen here only the highlights of
        an impressive series of planetary motions and
        conjunctions fraught with a variety of astrological
        meanings, involving all the other known planets of the
        period, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn. The astrological
        significance of these impressive events must surely
        have been seen by the Magi as the announcement of the
        impending birth of a great king of Israel.
        
             September 11, 3 b.c., is perhaps the most
        interesting date of all. Not only was Jupiter very
        close to Regulus in the first of their conjunctions,
        but the sun was in the constellation of Virgo (of
        obvious symbolism), together with the new moon, in a
        configuration that fits a plausible interpretation of a
        passage in the Book of Revelation describing the birth
        of a male child who is to be the ruler of the universe.
        Significantly, September 11, 3 b.c., also marked the
        beginning of the Jewish New Year, traditionally
        regarded as the anniversary of Noah's landing after the
        Great Flood.
        
             But if the planet Jupiter was the Star of
        Bethlehem, or was a component of the events that
        triggered the visit by the Magi, how do we view the
        final appearance of the Star on their journey to
        Bethlehem? It would have been in the southern sky,
        though fairly high above the horizon. Could it have
        stopped over Bethlehem?
        
             The answer is yes. The word "stop" was used for
        what we now call a planet's "stationary point." A
        planet normally moves eastward through the stars from
        night to night and month to month, but regularly
        exhibits a "retrograde loop." As it approaches the
        opposite point in the sky from the sun, it appears to
        slow, come to a full stop, and move backward (westward)
        through the sky for some weeks. Again it slows, stops,
        and resumes its eastward course. It seems plausible
        that the Magi were "overjoyed" at again seeing before
        them, as they traveled southward, His star, Jupiter,
        which at its stationary point was standing still over
        Bethlehem. We do know for certain that Jupiter
        performed a retrograde loop in 2 b.c. and that it was
        stationary on December 25, interestingly enough, during
        Hanukkah, the season for giving presents.
        
        
                           What Room for God?
        
        Where has this search for the Star of Bethlehem taken
        us? There has been much discussion in recent years
        about the "God of the gaps"--finding God in the gaps
        between the portions of some subject that we feel we
        understand scientifically. It seems to me that this is
        a dangerous position, for science by definition cannot
        admit to such gaps and must search continually to fill
        them with its understanding, and it often will succeed
        in so doing. Here the situation is different. The
        question is: What meaning, what room for God, do we
        find in the events that we know to have occurred?
        
             If we have correctly identified the Star of
        Bethlehem, the science is clear and simple. Keplerian
        orbits of planets[6] are predictable, so that we can
        deduce quite accurately what the sky looked like two
        thousand years ago. Even the ancient Magi understood
        apparent planetary motions quite well. Predictions of
        the conjunctions of 3 and 2 b.c. were made 400 years
        prior to the birth of Christ, and they were in error by
        only a few days. There is no need to invoke God or
        divine miracles to explain what happened in the heavens
        above Judaea. Natural laws are sufficient.
        
             But is this kind of sufficiency really enough for
        us? The significant question raised here is not what
        happened, but why it happened. What does it mean? Was
        Matthew right in seeing this event as divine
        confirmation of a central moment in God's plan for
        mankind? What room is left for God, not as an agent
        filling in the gaps between what we can understand as
        physical causes, but as the creator of purpose? And was
        God's purpose fulfilled by the great celestial dance
        that we call the Star of Bethlehem?
        
             These questions are examples of the kind of
        decisions we are faced with daily. No theologian can
        say, in a way convincing to a scientist, that some
        event required an act of God outside natural law.
        Similarly, no scientist can say that some event was
        merely (a dangerous word) an act of natural law working
        itself out with no other meaning. That is, no one is
        forced to believe that what happened in the heavens two
        thousand years ago was a simple, natural event devoid
        of meaning. The Star of Bethlehem is an excellent
        example of an event that occurs right at the
        intersection of Christianity and science, in a world
        created by a God who chose to institute natural laws
        but who nevertheless continues to carry out His own
        purposes.

        1  My background is astronomy. I also took some
        fascinating courses in Biblical studies at Harvard
        Divinity School, but I do not pretend to be an expert
        of any sort. It also should be noted that I am not
        presenting any original research in this essay. Many
        scholars, including scientists, theologians,
        andhistorians, have studied the Star of Bethlehem.
        
        2  It has been suggested that this is a commentary by
        Matthew, always fond of referring to Old Testament
        prophecies, on Balaam's oracle in the Book of Numbers
        that "a star shall come forth out of Jacob and a
        scepter shall rise out of Israel." It would be
        uncharacteristic of Matthew to refrain from pointing
        out this prophecy explicitly, had he had it in mind.
        
        3  The Hebrew prophet Daniel, himself a member of the
        Magi, foretold that a king of kings would come forth
        from Israel. On the strength of this prophecy, the
        Roman emperor Nero was even advised to move his capital
        to Jerusalem.
        
        4  The reference is to Herod the Great. It was his son
        Herod Antipas who executed John the Baptist and who
        ruled at the time of the Crucifixion.
