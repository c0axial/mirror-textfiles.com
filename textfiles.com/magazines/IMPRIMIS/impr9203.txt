        Preview: Education is the nation's top growth industry. Annual
        spending on education has increased over 300 percent in less than
        twenty years. And we are spending five times more on each student
        than we did fifty years ago. Why, then, are America's schools in
        crisis? Why have education task forces failed to achieve
        significant reform?
        
             Polly Williams and J. Patrick Rooney say it's time to stop
        relying on more money, more task forces, more experts, and more
        bureaucrats: genuine reform can only be brought about by creating
        incentives for schools - and therefore students - to succeed,
        i.e., by introducing competition. Williams and Rooney addressed
        350 St. Louis community leaders and educators during the Shavano
        Institute for National Leadership seminar, "Public/Private
        Education: Should Parents Be Free to Choose?" on October 16-17,
        1991

                 "Inner City Kids: Why Choice Is Their Only Hope"
              by A. Polly Williams, State Representative, Wisconsin
        
        Since 1976, Milwaukee has been under court order to "racially
        balance" its public schools. Now, there are about one hundred
        thousand school-age children in this city. Approximately 70
        percent are black or belong to other minorities. How do you
        "racially balance" a system in which 70 percent of the population
        is made up of minorities and only thirty percent is white? How do
        you justify the millions of dollars that the federal and state
        government are paying the schools to achieve this impossible
        goal?
        
             The same court order mandates that only 30 percent of the
        teachers can be black. "Racial balance" is the goal once again.
        But if the city is 70 percent minority, where are the non-black
        teachers supposed to be coming from? And why are black teachers
        who want to work in the inner city prevented from teaching?
        
             Below are some maps that will show what happens when the
        government and the courts try to force "racial balance." In the
        middle of the first map, the small circle is an inner city
        school, and every one of the round black dots represents one of
        the other schools in Milwaukee. Under the "racial balance" plan,
        black children who would ordinarily attend the inner city school
        in question are bussed all over the district - to a hundred and
        four different schools.
        
                    [Editor's note: the maps are not included
                      in the electronic version of Imprimis]
        
             Historically, blacks have demanded equal opportunity
        education; what they've gotten instead is forced desegregation.
        What do blacks want? We want the same thing whites want. We want
        our kids educated in their own communities. Yet look at the
        second map, showing the bus routes for just three schools.
        (Imagine a map showing the bus routes for over one hundred
        schools!)
        
             Better than anything, these bus routes show the chaos and
        confusion caused by forced "racial balance." They also show
        corruption: the government pays the educrats an extra thousand
        dollars in desegregation funds for every new route. For the last
        decade and a half, forced busing in Milwaukee has cost taxpayers
        $335 million.
        
                     Public Schools: 90 Percent Failure Rate
        
        In the meantime, the public schools are failing to educate our
        children. Sixty percent of all Milwaukee ninth graders do not
        complete high school, and of the 40 percent who stay in the
        school and walk across the stage to receive their diplomas, only
        10 percent can read. For what amounts to a 90 percent failure
        rate, we pay $600 million a year to support the Milwaukee public
        schools - that averages out to about $6000 per student. The
        educrats keep saying, "You've got to give us more money, because
        it's tough to educate these inner city kids. They are poor, and
        they are raised by single mothers; we can't expect them to learn.
        . . ."
        
             That's the stereotype: poor black children are slow
        learners, difficult and expensive to educate. Well, my children
        were raised in a single parent home. My husband and I divorced
        when the eldest was thirteen and the youngest was five. After the
        divorce, five of us had to live on my salary, which was only
        $8000 a year. And we did live on it, though we were certainly
        living below the poverty level. According to the educrats and all
        the experts defining who we were, my children were simply not
        supposed to make it. I am happy to tell you that the educrats
        were wrong, because my children did make it and they were not
        stereotypes.
        
             But poor black children do share a major disadvantage.
        Unlike those whose parents can vote with their feet and enroll in
        good private schools, poor black children are forced to go to the
        school the government selects for them. That's not right. We're
        supposed to educate all children, because if we don't educate
        them we're going to incarcerate them -  Wisconsin, for example,
        has eight new prisons on the drawing board, but no new schools.
        The state should be encouraging the establishment of more private
        and public schools and more private businesses - giving children
        basic academic skills and putting adults to work instead of
        giving them endless social programs. Blacks want to learn and to
        earn their way just like everybody else. We don't want welfare
        that just puts us back on the plantation - this time the
        government plantation.
        
             And blacks don't want their children to be forced to attend
        public schools if there are better alternatives. In the Milwaukee
        public school system, 62 percent of the teachers and
        administrators refuse to send their kids to the public schools.
        This flight from the system has had ironic results. When 23
        suburban public schools were recently in danger of closing due to
        low enrollment, black children were simply bussed in, and the
        state gave the schools an extra $12,000 for each. So, the failing
        suburban public schools received a guaranteed source of students
        and more than $22 million a year in additional government
        funding.
        
                     Private Schools and Parental Empowerment
        
        I opposed forced desegregation from the start. I wanted what most
        parents want: for my children to be educated in their own
        community. At the time, there were about a dozen private schools
        in the inner city of Milwaukee. They were previously Catholic
        institutions that had been reorganized as private nonsectarian
        academies, and they were a wonderful alternative for low-income
        and minority students - predominantly blacks, but also Hispanics,
        Asians and whites. They allowed students to get a good education
        in their own neighborhoods with teachers who really believed in
        them, rather than the educrats' stereotypes. What's really
        impressive is that these private schools had a 98 percent
        graduation rate.
        
             But they couldn't get by on the tuition they charged, and
        although successful, they were in danger of closing their doors.
        Meanwhile, the public schools were getting millions of our tax
        dollars whether they did a good job or not. So a few years ago, a
        small group banded together and approached the state legislature.
        We said: "Why not allow tax dollars to go to the schools that are
        working?" We didn't know that vouchers had already been defeated
        in every other state where they'd been proposed, We didn't even
        call our proposal a voucher plan; we called it "parental
        empowerment" or "choice." Meetings were organized to discuss our
        proposal. We hoped to attract a few dozen people, but hundreds of
        enthusiastic parents began showing up and staying for sessions
        that ran on for hours. This shocked public school officials,
        especially since they couldn't get more than a few parents to any
        of their meetings.
        
             People often fall into the habit of saying, "How do you get
        the poor involved in the education of their children? They just
        don't care, or they don't know enough to make 'intelligent'
        choices." But, in reality, if you give them a sense that they can
        make a difference in the lives of their children, if you give
        them some power, you'll find out that poor parents can care more
        than anyone. They don't take education for granted. They know
        that education is the only way out of poverty. And when you em-
        power people and give them a sense of ownership, they be-come
        responsible, and they learn how to make decisions. And when they
        are treated with dignity and respect, they respond to it.
        
             Choice empowers parents. It allows them to choose the best
        school for their children. It doesn't say, as the educrats do,
        that poor people are too dumb (they use the word "uniformed") to
        make choices. Poor people are the same as rich people. They may
        not have much money, but they have the same desires and the same
        needs. And poor people make decisions all the time. They decide
        where they are going to live, what grocery store to buy from,
        where to shop for clothes - they decide everything, but all of a
        sudden, the educrats claim that they don't have enough sense to
        make a decision about the education of their children.
        
             But the teachers' unions, the NAACP, the bureaucracy, and
        the educational establishment didn't agree. In the name of
        protecting the poor, they all opposed choice. We didn't try to
        beat them - they were too powerful. Instead, we went directly to
        the parents, and we organized the community from the grassroots
        level, from the bottom up. And they kept coming to our meetings
        by the hundreds - even the Joe Six-Packs and the Archie Bunkers.
        Republicans, Democrats, Jews, Catholics, Protestants and Muslims
        publicly spoke up in favor of the plan, even when it had nothing
        to do with their agendas.
        
             When we proposed choice, the parents in the audience said,
        "Are you serious? You mean we can take our children out of public
        schools?" They began showing up and sitting in the galleries at
        the state capitol and watching the legislators, who, for their
        part, were shocked that the parents were there. Like the
        educrats, they also believed that the poor didn't care.
        
             And to everyone's surprise, the parental empowerment bill -
        the first in the U.S. - passed into law. Starting in the 1990-91
        school year, up to 1000 students could claim $2500 worth of
        tuition vouchers (a fraction, of course, of the per-student
        expense at public schools). This year, one private school had 600
        applicants for 100 openings. Every private school in the inner
        city has a waiting list. Hundreds of low-income families want out
        of the public school system. Those who have succeeded in getting
        out are spreading the word: Their children, two to three grade
        levels behind in the public school, are now working at their
        grade levels. Once always absent, they are even refusing to stay
        home sick! A typical response is, "Please don't make me stay home
        - my teacher is expecting me." There are no gang problems and
        only a two percent drop out rate.
        
             Sure it's only one thousand in a city that has one hundred
        thousand students, and the educrats are fighting the bill in the
        state supreme court, but I think it's a real victory - and we've
        only just begun. If the poor people of Milwaukee can achieve
        something no other group in the nation has been able to do, then
        anything is possible.

                "Private Vouchers: A New Idea in Education Reform"
          by J. Patrick Rooney, Chairman, Golden Rule Insurance Company
        
        Advocates of choice in Indiana have worked hard to achieve
        meaningful education reform, but we just can't get an educational
        choice bill through the state legislature. (If you have ever
        worked with any government branch, you know that it is a lot
        easier to prevent something from happening than it is to get
        anything innovative done.)
        
             The odds are clearly on the side of the bureaucrats, even
        though there is considerable evidence that choice, where it has
        been tried in states such as Minnesota and districts such as East
        Harlem, is a phenomenal success. We know that educational choice
        in Indiana might be realized someday, but, in the meantime, we
        are abandoning another generation of children who are not getting
        a decent education.
        
            Private Vouchers: No Red Tape, No Bureaucrats, No Strings
        
        Recently, we at the Golden Rule Insurance Company decided to do
        something about education reform right now. In 1991, we created
        private vouchers; that is, as a company in the private sector, we
        offered to pay half of the tuition of any student who wanted to
        leave the public system and go to a private school. (Most of the
        non-public schools in Indianopolis charge $1600 or less - our cap
        was, therefore, $800.) This voucher program is for grade school
        children. We would have loved to extend it to the high school
        level, but we have limited resources, so it was a matter of
        priority.
        
             The only criterion is financial need. If students qualify
        for the free or reduced cost lunch program in the public schools,
        then they qualify for our educational grant. This is purposely a
        very generous criterion. We do not impose academic requirements
        of any kind, and there is a "first come, first served" basis for
        awarding the vouchers. (When we began, we tried elaborate
        questionnaire forms but quickly abandoned them. We are a society
        that is accustomed to filling out too many forms that are of
        dubious value.) We make no attempt to decide which private
        schools are eligible. We are about the business of helping
        parents and students, hence they are free to choose any school
        that meets their needs.
        
             The beauty of private vouchers is that they are so simple -
        no red tape, no need to depend on bureaucrats to administer them,
        no worries that the vouchers will be used later as a way for the
        government to claim that private schools are accepting federal or
        state subsidies. And they start working right away.
        
                                Unexpected Success
        
        Golden Rule's private vouchers are a great success, much greater
        than we expected, in fact. We called a press conference to
        announce the start of the program only three weeks before the
        commencement of the 1991-92 school year. We stated very
        cautiously that we anticipated that only 100-200 students would
        want to be involved in this program. Well, within the first three
        days, Golden Rule had 621 requests for applications, and at the
        present time, we have distributed more than 2,000 applications.
        
             A temporary obstacle is that most of the private schools
        already have full or near-full enrollments. But the response to
        our private voucher plan will inevitably lead to expansion, as it
        has created a whole new supply of potential students for private
        schools. In the first school term of this year, 705 students were
        awarded vouchers and there were 199 on the waiting list. (This
        list would have been larger, but many parents knew that the
        private schools were full.)
        
                          Why Support Private Education?
        
        Why do we support private education through vouchers? There are
        three reasons. The first reason is that Golden Rule is interested
        in helping the disadvantaged, particularly the minority citizens
        of our country. Our vouchers are not awarded on the basis of race
        or ethnic background - they are colorblind - but since they go to
        mainly inner city residents, the natural effect is to help
        blacks, Hispanics and other minorities.
        
             Sources such as the Hudson Institute's report, Workforce
        2000, estimate that over the next decade, the work force will be
        very slowly growing older, more female, more minority, and more
        disadvantaged. Only 15 percent of the new entrants to the labor
        force during that period will be white males compared with 30
        percent today. The demographic opportunity of the 1990s will be
        missed unless something is done now - the problems of minority
        unemployment, crime and dependency could be far worse than they
        are today.
        
             The second reason for Golden Rule's interest in vouchers is
        very practical. New jobs in service industries will demand much
        higher skill levels than the jobs of today. Many companies are
        already forced to run remedial education programs for their
        employees. We can't put off educating people until the time they
        apply for work - that is the wrong time to fix the problem. But
        according to their own standardized tests, Indiana public schools
        are failing to teach adequate basic skills and are far behind the
        private schools in terms of overall student achievement. If for
        no other reason that this, competition is needed at the
        elementary and secondary school levels where the monopoly
        position of the public school has stifled innovation.
        
             The third reason is linked to the second: It is vital to the
        public interest that students work hard and learn basic habits
        like punctuality and diligence. Yet, the Committee for Economic
        Development published a study several years ago arguing that one
        of the most important failures of the public schools is that they
        have failed to teach even a basic "work ethic."
        
             Add drug abuse and violence to the list: Public schools have
        failed there too, resorting to metal detectors, locker searches
        and security guards. And despite all such efforts, many students
        do not learn to respect or heed authority. Lastly, there is the
        dropout rate in public institutions. In one Indianapolis high
        school, 80 percent of the student body typically does not
        graduate.
        
             The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National
        Education Association (NEA) have recently begun a new media
        campaign to convince Americans that the public schools are doing
        every bit as well as the private schools. I don't think Americans
        will be convinced, simply because there is too much evidence to
        the contrary. Who, for example, has ever heard of a private
        school with metal detectors or with an 80 percent drop out rate?

        In summary, with private vouchers, we have made a real and
        practical investment in the future of our own business as well as
        our society. Every business and charitable organization should
        start its own voucher program, for one or one thousand students,
        it doesn't matter. What does matter is that they will have taken
        a step toward helping others as well as themselves.

        Polly Williams is America's leading advocate of parental choice
        in education. Time, Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal, and "60
        Minutes" have reported on her successful efforts to secure
        private school vouchers - the first in the nation - for inner
        city students in Milwaukee. To millions of American parents who
        want the freedom to decide what education is best for their
        children, Polly Williams has become a national symbol of hope,
        courage and determination. A six-term state representative in the
        Wisconsin legislature, she holds the record for the highest
        number of votes for reelection - in 1986, the figure was 94
        percent.

        J. Patrick Rooney has been in the health insurance industry for
        over three decades. He is chairman of the board of the Golden
        Rule Insurance Company, which is licensed in 49 states and which
        earns a premium income of almost $600 million annually. The
        company is generally considered the nation's largest writer of
        individual medical insurance and is marketed by over 70,000
        independent brokers. Mr. Rooney has gained national attention in
        the last year for establishing a $1.2 million fund for private
        education vouchers which enable hundreds of low-income parents in
        Indiana to send their children to the private schools of their
        choice. In two recent headline editorials, the Wall Street
        Journal hailed Mr. Rooney's efforts as a real "breakthrough in
        corporate support for educational choice."
