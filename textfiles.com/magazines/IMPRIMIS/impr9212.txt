        Preview: What follows are excerpts from remarks
        President George Roche prepared for delivery to the
        Hillsdale College faculty and staff on August 22, 1992.
        We chose to share these remarks with our Imprimis
        readers because we believe that they reflect an
        attitude that stands in sharp contrast to what passes
        for "educational leadership" on other campuses.
        
                     ------------------------------
        
                    A School with a Stubborn Streak
        
        From its humble beginnings, this small rural school had
        a stubborn streak that prompted it to champion
        principle over expediency. In Historic Hillsdale
        College, Professor Arlan Gilbert cites a State Board
        Visitor's report from October 14, 1882:
        
             "In these times when there are such inducements to
        surcharge the college curriculum with modern subjects,
        we think it very credible that this College [Hillsdale]
        should maintain its integrity with respect to the
        humanities. So far as we could observe, there prevailed
        in the College a sincere and well-directed effort to
        educate rather than instruct."
        
             It is hardly likely that a similar government
        report in the 1990s would compliment us for defending
        the traditional liberal arts. We would be assailed
        because we have not surcharged our curriculum with
        "modern" subjects and academic fads ranging from
        deconstructionism ("there is no objective truth, only
        different interpretations") to gender or race-based
        teaching (disguised as multiculturalism).
        
             Hillsdale has always been a conspicuous symbol of
        old-fashioned independence and is an institution that
        has never abandoned its history. But living up to our
        history becomes more difficult every day, for the
        "powers that be" place less and less value on
        independence. How different things would be if the
        government would credit Hillsdale College with the
        mandate in the State Board Visitor's 1882 report! But
        instead it has created a centralized bureaucracy
        intolerant of local rights and power and hostile toward
        individuals and institutions that prefer to be
        responsible for their own destinies.
        
             Wrongfully, America's colleges and universities
        encourage this bureaucracy. They eagerly compete for
        federal funds and seek an active partnership with
        government. But not at Hillsdale. We don't view
        government as a partner but as a threat to our very
        way of life. And in my 21 years as president, the
        threat has changed and grown yearly. I now think of it
        as the Greeks did Proteus: it changes shapes constantly
        and with each change it is uglier and more difficult to
        combat.
        
                The Financial Crisis in Higher Education
        
        At first glance, however, it looks like the threat is
        to other schools, rather than to us.
        
             Today, many institutions of higher learning are
        conducting their financial affairs only a step or two
        ahead of insolvency. Sixty percent of all public and
        private colleges were forced to cut their operating
        budgets in 1991-92--many in mid-year. It is not just
        small schools that are in serious financial trouble.
        Harvard had a $42 million deficit last year. Yale has
        deferred $1 billion in maintenance. The entire state
        university system in California has promised 17-33
        percent cuts across the board this year and Oregon's
        public colleges will have to slash 20 percent over the
        next several years.
        
             In the short term, this means increased student
        fees, postponed capital expenditures, increased class
        size, and hiring and salary freezes. In the long term,
        it means more dependence on tuition revenue, outdated
        facilities and equipment, smaller endowments, fewer
        programs and fewer courses.
        
             Approximately 20 percent of all schools have cut
        full-time faculty and are relying more and more on
        part-time instructors. In the past year, the Chronicle
        of Higher Education and the Wall Street Journal have
        documented the uncertainty and hardships on hundreds of
        campuses. Overall, America is spending more than ever
        before on higher education, yet her colleges and
        universities are experiencing an unprecedented budget
        crisis. Clearly this is an indication of a collapsing
        infrastructure.
        
                   Exploding Federal Grants and Loans
        
        If Hillsdale College had not gotten its own financial
        house in order in the last two decades, we would be in
        similar trouble. At other pre-opening conferences
        around the country, I can guarantee that the mood is
        substantially different than it is here today. We have
        many blessings for which to give thanks.
        
             But before we become complacent, we must realize
        that we currently face one of the greatest problems
        ever to confront the school. It comes as a result of
        the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, passed as
        Public Law 102-325. For the past year, all signals
        seemed to indicate that President Bush would not sign
        the legislative package that covers all federal tuition
        assistance programs. He was urged by his education
        secretary not to sign. He publicly and repeatedly vowed
        that he would not, yet he did sign on July 23, 1992.
        
             As a consequence, a federal Pell Grant-- available
        to any student with financial need---increases from a
        maximum of $2,400 to $3,700 next year.* By 1997, Pell
        Grants will peak at $4,500. Of course, Hillsdale has
        been replacing Pell Grants and other federal grants and
        loans with private funds ever since 1985 when the
        Supreme Court ruled that such funds made colleges
        "recipient institutions" subject to total federal
        control.
        
             So why are we in danger?
        
             We aren't competing against other colleges for
        students--we are competing against the federal
        government. We are simply unable to replace all the
        federal grants and loans our students would have
        received on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The hard truth
        is that students are eligible for thousands of dollars
        more if only they will choose another school. The
        pressure not to attend Hillsdale is enormous, but
        students continue to choose us anyway, even if it means
        that they or their parents are forced to assume a
        heavy financial burden.
        
             In 1991, a student with what is termed a "full
        need factor" could have received some $8,650 from the
        government in Pell Grant, Perkins Loan and Supplemental
        Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) funds. At
        Hillsdale, by comparison, the same student received in
        private funds only $4,220. By 1997, a "full need
        factor" student will be eligible for $11,500 from just
        three government programs. Where will Hillsdale come up
        with the funds to compete?
        
             No matter how exceptional we are, we have to be
        concerned about being priced out of the market by
        skyrocketing federal assistance programs that literally
        force students to attend other schools. We have never
        been and will never become a school for a select few
        based on the ability to pay. But we aren't setting the
        rules of the game--the federal bureaucrats are.
        
               Beating the Bureaucrats at Their Own Game
        
        We have to beat them at their own game. We have been
        doing it for 148 years, after all, and we will keep on
        doing it, as long as we remain committed. There is a
        national leadership audience of thousands of heartland
        Americans who already support us in our efforts.
        
             Twenty years ago, the College's endowment was
        slightly under $3 million. The Freedom Fund launched in
        the late 1970s brought in over $30 million. In the late
        1980s, we began the FreedomQuest 150th anniversary
        campaign with its goal of $151 million. Many of you
        here took part in the extensive planning sessions that
        shaped the heart and working agenda of this campaign.
        It is your campaign meant to secure your future and the
        future of Hillsdale College.
        
             When we celebrate our 150th anniversary in 1994-
        95, we will be uniquely positioned in American higher
        education, and there will be many more chapters to come
        in Hillsdale's proud story.
        
            But I will warn once more about being too
        complacent. When we set the goals for the FreedomQuest
        campaign, we could not know that federal assistance
        programs were going to explode by 40-50 percent. And
        although the Higher Education Amendments are not due to
        take effect for another year, their impact is immediate
        since we are currently recruiting students for 1993-94.
        
             The Department of Education already has a total
        aid budget of more than $19.5 billion. Last year, it
        overspent its Pell Grant budget by $1.5 billion and
        there is every expectation that it will continue to
        exceed its authority. In 1986-87, 75 cents out of every
        dollar of need-based tuition assistance came from the
        federal government. That figure will increase
        dramatically next year, and as it does, our colleges
        and universities will become, in effect, incarcerated
        wards of the state. If you teach or work at such a
        school, you might as well request that your salary be
        paid directly by the U.S. Treasury. You work for the
        government.
        
             Hillsdale must become more competitive. We are
        already on the right track. Last year, 73 percent of
        Hillsdale's students received some sort of financial
        aid from private sources. Fifty-one percent of that aid
        was need-based while the other 49 percent was merit-
        based. The need-based funds come from the Hillsdale
        College Independence Grant and Loan Program. The
        average grade point of the 51 percent was 3.2 on a
        scale of 4.0. This not only reflects the sound quality
        of the students, but the strength of their belief in
        what the College has to offer them. Their appreciation
        is evident in the fact that our student loan program
        has a zero percent default rate.
        
             So much for the good news. The bad news is that
        changes affecting Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL), now
        known as Stafford Loans, are going to make it even
        harder for students to attend Hillsdale. The government
        is the ultimate guarantor, but these are still
        essentially private loans handled by commercial banks.
        In the political jockeying behind the Higher Education
        Amendments, a battle was mounted to remove Stafford
        Loans from the banks and place them under the direct
        control of federal government. Eventually, a compromise
        was reached in which students from 300-500 schools will
        receive direct aid.
        
             This "pilot" program, which nobody expects to
        remain limited very long, was agreed upon despite the
        fact that under the old system, default rates were in
        excess of 50 percent. This year, more than $2 billion
        Stafford Loans are in default. Direct aid will only
        make matters worse. It wipes out any remaining vestiges
        of institutional accountability and it will drive up
        tuitions and federal assistance even further.
        
             Long ago, Hillsdale anticipated that the
        government would seize control of this private loan
        program. So we included $10 million for the College's
        endowment in the FreedomQuest campaign to replace the
        funds involved. However, there is a more immediate
        concern. It would only take an administrative ruling
        within the Department of Education to determine right
        now that all Stafford Loans are really federal loans.
        Without warning, we would have to raise an extra
        $600,000 or more each year on top of everything we are
        struggling to raise already for scholarships, grants
        and loans--the hardest category of all for which to
        raise funds.
        
                  Why Hillsdale's Future Looks Bright
        
        That is a very real threat. It will undoubtedly change
        and grow even more menacing. Still, we have the means
        to ensure a bright future. At the FreedomQuest
        campaign's outset, we established benchmarks of so many
        million dollars to be raised each year.
        
        Every year since 1987, we have exceeded those
        benchmarks. (You might be interested to know that our
        auditors, the nationally-known firm of Arthur Andersen,
        has told our board of trustees that it uses Hillsdale
        College as the financial model for its edu cation
        clients.)
        
             The more knowledgeable you are about the financial
        aid crisis in American higher education, the more you
        can appreciate Hillsdale's independent stance and the
        ways we can continue to defend it. We can remain
        competitive, too, with your help. Encourage prospective
        students to visit your classroom, keep current parents
        involved, attend admissions-sponsored open houses,
        participate in campus events. Most of all, remember
        that your classroom teaching and hands-on academic
        advising are what attract students to the College and
        keep them here.
        
             Students choose Hillsdale not only because of the
        high caliber of our faculty. They also choose us
        because we are different from other colleges. While
        other institutions exist merely to exist, we have a
        special mission and a special identity.
        
            Our mission is to kindle in the next generation a
        love and understanding of what Edmund Burke  aptly
        called "the perma-nent things" and "the moral
        imagination." During its formative years, the College's
        founders defined education as the preservation,
        refinement and transmission of values. Its tools
        included reason, tradition, moral concern, and
        introspection. It was an undertaking that sought
        meaning in human life, justice in human affairs,
        dignity in human aspiration. That definition best
        describes Hillsdale College's mission then and now.
        
             As for our identity, it is rooted in our fierce
        and steadfast independence. It is not just a matter of
        our refusal to accept federal funds or federal control;
        we have always chosen to go our own way.
        
             A few years ago another government official
        reported his observations about the College--just like
        the State Board Visitor in 1882. He summed up our
        identity this way: "Hillsdale College is a beacon to
        all who labor for freedom." This visitor, whose name
        was Ronald Reagan, had cause to appreciate our
        identity. I hope that you do too.

        Footnote: * Once more promising more than it can
        deliver, Congress will not be able to budget more than
        $2300-$2400 per student for now. Federal assistance
        conforms to the laxest possible standards. Perkins
        Loans can be obtained without an acceptable credit
        rating_the same is true with the private/public
        Stafford Loans. Even if an institution knows that an
        individual has no intention of repaying, it is required
        by law to certify the loan as long as the eligibility
        requirements are met. And under the Higher Education
        Amendments, a family's home and farm equity and college
        savings accounts are removed from the asset column, so
        more and more students are eligible for more and more
        money that the government does not have but spends
        anyway.
