        Preview: This month's Imprimis issue by Malcolm S.
        Forbes, Jr. promotes understanding capitalism as a
        moral as well as an economic system. He observes that
        central planners and politicians always underestimate
        the power of the free market and of individual
        decisions. Mr. Forbes' remarks were delivered at
        Hillsdale's Shavano Institute for National Leadership
        seminar, "American Perestroika: Returning Public
        Services to the Private Sector," in Atlanta before an
        audience of nearly 500 business and community leaders
        in May 1993.
        
        ---------------------------------------------
        
        Living in the 1990s, we are uniquely able to judge what
        the American economy has achieved in the 20th century.
        For this reason, we ought to give three cheers for
        capitalism. By the term, I mean "democratic
        capitalism," which is as fundamentally different from
        the "managed capitalism" of modern-day central planners
        as it is from the "state capitalism" of old-style
        fascists, socialists, and communists.
        
             Capitalism works better than any of us can
        conceive. It is also the only truly moral system of
        exchange. It encourages individuals to freely devote
        their energies and impulses to peaceful pursuits, to
        the satisfaction of others' wants and needs, and to
        constructive action for the welfare of all. The basis
        for capitalism is not greed. You don't see misers
        creating Walmarts and Microsofts.
        
             Think about it for a moment. Capitalism is truly
        miraculous. What other system enables us to cooperate
        with millions of other ordinary people--whom we will
        never meet but whom we will gladly provide with goods
        and services--in an incredible, complex web of
        commercial transactions? And what other system
        perpetuates itself, working every day, year in, year
        out, with no single hand guiding it?
        
             Capitalism is a moral system if only because it is
        based on trust. When we turn on a light, we assume that
        there will be electricity. When we drive into a service
        station, we assume that there will be fuel. When we
        walk into a restaurant, we assume that there will be
        food. If we were to make a list of all the basic things
        that capitalism provides--things that we take for
        granted--it would fill an encyclopedia.
        
        
                  How to Become Successful Capitalists
        
        How do we become successful capitalists? The answer
        sounds simple, but it is often overlooked in places
        where you would think they would know better. (I am
        referring, of course, to government, the media, and our
        most elite business schools and economics departments.)
        We succeed as capitalists by offering goods and
        services that others are willing to buy. Many
        capitalists do not make correct assumptions about what
        to offer and fail, but that is as it should be. There
        is no guarantee of success in any area of life,
        including business--there is always risk. The
        particular advantage of capitalism is that failed
        businesses don't necessarily equal a failed economy;
        they make way for successful businesses.
        
             But even the most successful businesses can't
        afford to forget about market principles. AT&T is a
        case in point. In the 1970s, fiber-optic technology was
        available, but AT&T decided that it would delay fully
        converting for perhaps 30 to 40 years. It wanted to
        fully depreciate its old plants and equipment, and,
        because it enjoyed a virtual monopoly over its
        customers, it saw no reason to spend a lot of money on
        a new long distance calling system. But then an upstart
        company, MCI, raised a couple billion dollars through
        the much-maligned "junk bonds" market in order to set
        up its own fiber-optic network. AT&T had no choice but
        to keep up with its competition, and, as a result, the
        U.S. experienced an enormous advance in communications
        that has put it ahead of its foreign competitors and
        that has benefited hundreds of millions of consumers.
        
             About twenty-five years ago, the federal
        government filed an antitrust suit against IBM because
        it had grown so successful that its name had become
        virtually synonymous with the computer industry. But
        the would-be trustbusters underestimated the vitality
        of an open marketplace. IBM's dominance of mainframe
        computers, microchips, and software did not prevent the
        rise of rival companies such as Digital Equipment,
        Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft. Today,
        IBM's very existence is in jeopardy.
        
             Around the same time, John Kenneth Galbraith wrote
        The New Industrial State, in which he argued that
        though the Ford Motor Company was no longer the biggest
        of the auto companies (GM had roughly 50 percent of all
        sales), Ford was so large that it did not have to pay
        particular attention to its shareholders or its
        customers. Apparently, Japanese automakers did not read
        John Kenneth Galbraith, or the reports of countless
        other "experts" who claimed that it was impossible to
        compete against Ford, GM, and Chrysler. They even
        ignored their own early failures to storm the U.S.
        market in the 1950s and early 1960s. Finally, after
        years of trying, Japanese automakers succeeded--and
        succeeded to an extent that no one could have
        predicted--in challenging the hegemony of the "giants"
        in Detroit.
        
             Then there is Sears & Roebuck. What more mundane
        business could there be than retailing? Yet, around the
        turn of the century, Sears made retailing truly
        exciting, reaching out to millions of people with new
        marketing methods and new products. By the end of the
        1940s, it dwarfed all competitors. In the last several
        decades, however, the company lost its way and became a
        self-serving, insulated bureaucracy. Now it is closing
        its doors on numerous stores. Its market share has
        plunged--and its profits have almost disappeared.
        
             Why, by contrast, has another retail firm,
        Walmart, achieved its phenomenal success? Not because
        its founder Sam Walton used to ride around in a pickup
        truck visiting his stores, though that was good
        publicity. It was because he recognized the importance
        of computer technology and had systems devised that
        help store operators respond to inventory information
        on a weekly and even daily basis. Sam Walton knew that
        success, even once it was achieved, was something that
        couldn't be taken for granted.
        
             What should be clear from each of these examples
        is that capitalism is not a top-down system--it cannot
        be mandated or centrally planned. It operates from the
        bottom up, through individuals--individuals who take
        risks, who often "don't know any better," who venture
        into areas where, according to conventional wisdom,
        they have no business going, who see vast potential
        where others see nothing.
        
             Often, these individuals literally stumble across
        ideas that never would have occurred to them if they
        were forced to work in a top-down system. And they take
        supposedly "worthless" substances and turn them into
        infinitely valuable ones. Look at penicillin. Whoever
        thought that stale bread could be good for anything?
        The same goes for oil before the invention of the
        gasoline engine and the automobile and for sand before
        the invention of glass, fiber-optics, and the
        microchip.
        
             There is another important thing to remember about
        capitalism: Failure is not a stigma or a permanent
        obstacle.  It is a spur to learn and try again. Edison
        invented the light bulb on, roughly, his ten-thousandth
        attempt. If we had depended on central planners to
        direct his experiments, we would all be sitting around
        in the dark today.
        
        
                      Open vs. Managed Competition
        
        This leads to the next question regarding capitalism:
        What is the market? Central planners don't like the
        word; they prefer to say, "market forces," as if
        describing aliens from outer space. But nothing could
        be further from the truth. The market is people. All of
        us. We decide what to do and what not to do, where to
        shop and where not to shop, what to buy and what not to
        buy. So when central planners trash "market forces,"
        they are really trashing us.
        
             Unfortunately, they are the ones who seem to be
        calling the shots today on a number of issues that
        should be left up to the market, i.e., up to us. One
        such issue is the spiraling costs of health care. Not
        surprisingly, central planners advocate a top-down
        approach to reform. With unconscious irony, they call
        it "managed competition."
        
             But we have already tried managed competition; in
        fact, it is managed competition that has caused so many
        problems in the health care industry in the first
        place. Specifically, the tax code penalizes individuals
        who want to buy medical insurance by making them pay
        for it with after-tax dollars, even if they are self-
        employed. Only 25 percent of their premiums are
        deductible. But companies may buy health insurance with
        pre-tax dollars. So they, instead of their employees,
        have become the primary purchasers of insurance. This
        drives a wedge between the real customers and the real
        providers and obscures the real costs of such features
        of the system as low deductibles. Imagine if every time
        you went to the supermarket you gave the cash register
        receipt to your employer, who then submitted it to the
        insurance company for a claim. What would happen to
        food prices? They would skyrocket, because you wouldn't
        care whether a bottle of soda cost $10, $100, or
        $1,000.
        
             The problem doesn't stop there. Growth in demand
        and improvements in technology--key ingredients to
        success in any other business--have instead led to
        crisis in the health care industry. More people are
        receiving better treatment than ever before and leading
        longer, healthier lives, but perversely this has sent
        costs up rather than down and has overloaded the
        delivery system.
        
             If we want genuine health care reform, we must
        return to open competition. The tax code must be
        revised so that individuals can buy health insurance
        with pre-tax dollars and set up medical IRAs for their
        families that can be used to finance routine medical
        expenses. There is no doubt that a majority of
        Americans would choose this option. They want to have
        control over their own health care decisions. Many
        would choose policies with higher deductibles. Premiums
        would go down and so would paperwork. Physicians and
        hospitals would see their patient load come under
        control and would be induced to offer competitive rates
        and services. The potential benefits are enormous.
        
             A couple of years ago, Forbes Inc. faced yet
        another round of steeply rising costs for health care.
        We wanted to do something that enabled our employees to
        police those costs in a way we, the employer, were
        unable to do. So we gave them a stake in the process.
        We offered them a bonus: They could keep the difference
        between their claims and $500--and we would double the
        amount. Thus, if they went through a calendar year
        without filing any health claims on the insurance
        company, we would pay them as much as $1000, tax free.
        
             What happened? Suddenly, every employee became
        cost-conscious. On major medical and dental expenses,
        claims went down 30 percent. These savings financed the
        bonuses and our total health care costs went up zero
        percent last year. This was not because we compelled
        millions of people to participate in some "managed
        competition" scheme, but because we let a few hundred
        individuals make their own health care decisions.
        
        
              Letting Individuals Make Their Own Decisions
        
        Letting individuals make their own decisions is what
        capitalism is all about, but virtually all central
        planners (now in their heyday under the Clinton
        administration) and a good many members of the U.S.
        Congress (Republicans as well as Democrats) fail to
        realize it. They do not, for example, realize that it
        is the decisions of individuals that really decide how
        much tax revenue the government collects and how well
        the economy prospers. Between 1982 and 1986, the
        American private sector created well over 18 million
        new jobs, including a record number of high-paying
        positions. Of these, 14 million were created by new
        businesses. But, in 1987, Congress raised the capital
        gains tax to one of the highest levels in the
        industrial world. What happened? New business and job
        creation declined sharply. The nation was hit with a
        recession. And tax revenues, which were supposed to
        rise, went down. All this occurred because individuals
        made the decision not to invest. Today, there is almost
        $7 trillion of unrealized capital gains that is going
        begging because of high taxes. If Congress lowered the
        capital gains rate, it would mean more not less tax
        revenues. It also would overwhelm any stimulus package
        Washington could concoct for revitalizing the economy.
        
             Central planners also tend to be big fans of
        "industrial planning," whereby government picks the
        "winners" in the marketplace through subsidization of
        select companies and technologies. They ignore the fact
        that this will obliterate incentives for companies to
        remain competitive, breed corruption and special
        interests, and penalize the small businesses that are
        the backbone of the economy.
        
             And they want to micromanage the monetary system,
        knocking down the value of the dollar against the yen
        or raising it against some other currency in closed-
        door meetings with bureaucrats from other
        industrialized nations. They do not realize that one of
        the most important functions of money is to serve as a
        constant, reliable measure. A ruler is supposed to be
        12 inches long, but they want to change it to 11 or 13
        inches whenever it suits their political strategy. You
        and I might call this a swindle, but in Washington it
        is called sophisticated economic management.
        
             Even such a simple word as "change" takes on a
        whole new definition in Washington, meaning change
        directed from above by well-intended central planners
        and politicians who think that they "know better" than
        most people when it comes to making decisions. But, in
        truth, the most revolutionary sweeping agent of change
        is capitalism. Look at what has happened in Eastern
        Europe, the Soviet Union, Latin America, and Asia. When
        people are free to make their own decisions, they have
        a stake in the economy, and when they have a stake in
        the economy, they have a stake in serving others, and
        when they have a stake in serving others, they have a
        stake in fighting for freedom.
        
             Capitalism is the real enemy of tyranny. It stands
        not for accumulated wealth or greed but for human
        innovation, imagination, and risk-taking. It cannot be
        measured in mathematical models or quantified in
        statistical terms, which is why central planners and
        politicians always underestimate it. As I noted at the
        outset, it is up to us, then, to give three cheers for
        capitalism. Who knows? If we cheer loud enough, perhaps
        even they will listen.
