                   "The Moral Foundations of Society"
                          by Margaret Thatcher
                  Former Prime Minister, Great Britain
        
             ---------------------------------------------
        
        In November 1994, Lady Thatcher delivered the
        concluding lecture in Hillsdale's Center for
        Constructive Alternatives seminar, "God and Man:
        Perspectives on Christianity in the 20th Century"
        before an audience of 2,500 students, faculty, and
        guests. In an edited version of that lecture, she
        examines how the Judeo-Christian tradition has provided
        the moral foundations of America and other nations in
        the West and contrasts their experience with that of
        the former Soviet Union.
        
             ---------------------------------------------
        
                         The Moral Foundations
                        of the American Founding
        
        History has taught us that freedom can not long survive
        unless it is based on moral foundations. The American
        founding bears ample witness to this fact. America has
        become the most powerful nation in history, yet she
        uses her power not for territorial expansion but to
        perpetuate freedom and justice throughout the world.
        
        For over two centuries, Americans have held fast to
        their belief in freedom for all men-a belief that
        springs from their spiritual heritage. John Adams,
        second president of the United States, wrote in 1789,
        "Our Constitution was designed only for a moral and
        religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the
        government of any other." That was an astonishing thing
        to say, but it was true.
        
        What kind of people built America and thus prompted
        Adams to make such a statement? Sadly, too many people,
        especially young people, have a hard time answering
        that question.  They know little of their own history.
        (This is also true in Great Britain.) But America's is
        a very distinguished history, nonetheless, and it has
        important lessons to teach us regarding the necessity
        of moral foundations.
        
        John Winthrop, who led the Great Migration to America
        in the early 17th century and who helped found the
        Massachusetts Bay Colony, declared, "We shall be as a
        City upon a Hill." On the voyage to the New World, he
        told the members of his company that they must rise to
        their responsibilities and learn to live as God
        intended men should live: in charity, love, and
        cooperation with one another. Most of the early
        colonists were infused with the same spirit, and they
        tried to live in accord with a Biblical ethic.
        
        They felt they weren't able to do so in Great Britain
        or elsewhere in Europe. Some of them were Protestant,
        and some were Catholic; it didn't matter. What mattered
        was that they did not feel they had the liberty to
        worship freely and, therefore, to live freely, at home.
        With enormous courage, the first American colonists set
        out on a perilous journey to an unknown land-without
        government subsidies and not in order to amass fortunes
        but to fulfill their faith.
        
        Christianity is based on the belief in a single God as
        evolved from Judaism. Most important of all, the faith
        of America's founders affirmed the sanctity of each
        individual. Every human life-man or woman, child or
        adult, commoner or aristocrat, rich or poor-was equal
        in the eyes of the Lord. It also affirmed the
        responsibility of each individual.
        
        This was not a faith that allowed people to do whatever
        they wished, regardless of the consequences. The Ten
        Commandments, the injunction of Moses ("Look after your
        neighbor as yourself"), the Sermon on the Mount, and
        the Golden Rule made Americans feel precious-and also
        accountable-for the way in which they used their God-
        given talents. Thus they shared a deep sense of
        obligation to one another. And, as the years passed,
        they not only formed strong communities but devised
        laws that would protect individual freedom-laws that
        would eventually be enshrined in the Declaration of
        Independence and the U.S. Constitution.
        
        
                      Freedom with Responsibility
        
        Great Britain, which shares much of her history in
        common with America,  has also derived strength from
        its moral foundations, especially since the 18th
        century when freedom gradually began to spread
        throughout her society. Many people were greatly
        influenced by the sermons of John Wesley (1703-1791),
        who took the Biblical ethic to the people in a way
        which the institutional church itself had not done
        previously.
        
        But we in the West must also recognize our debt to
        other cultures. In the pre-Christian era, for example,
        the ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle had
        much to contribute to our understanding of such
        concepts as truth, goodness, and virtue. They knew full
        well that responsibility was the price of freedom. Yet
        it is doubtful whether truth, goodness, and virtue
        founded on reason alone would have endured in the same
        way as they did in the West, where they were based upon
        a Biblical ethic.
        
        Sir Edward Gibbon (1737-1794), author of The Decline
        and Fall of the Roman Empire, wrote tellingly of the
        collapse of Athens, which was the birthplace of
        democracy. He judged that, in the end, more than they
        wanted freedom, the Athenians wanted security. Yet they
        lost everything-security, comfort, and freedom. This
        was because they wanted not to give to society, but for
        society to give to them. The freedom they were seeking
        was freedom from responsibility. It is no wonder, then,
        that they ceased to be free. In the modern world, we
        should recall the Athenians' dire fate whenever we
        confront demands for increased state paternalism.
        
        To cite a more recent lesson in the importance of moral
        foundations, we should listen to Czech President Vaclav
        Havel, who suffered grievously for speaking up for
        freedom when his nation was still under the thumb of
        communism. He has observed, "In everyone there is some
        longing for humanity's rightful dignity, for moral
        integrity, and for a sense that transcends the world of
        existence." His words suggest that in spite of all the
        dread terrors of communism, it could not crush the
        religious fervor of the peoples of Eastern Europe and
        the Soviet Union.
        
        So long as freedom, that is, freedom with
        responsibility, is grounded in morality and religion,
        it will last far longer than the kind that is grounded
        only in abstract, philosophical notions. Of course,
        many foes of morality and religion have attempted to
        argue that new scientific discoveries make belief in
        God obsolete, but what they actually demonstrate is the
        remarkable and unique nature of man and the universe.
        It is hard not to believe that these gifts were given
        by a divine Creator, who alone can unlock the secrets
        of existence.
        
        
                        Societies Without Moral
                              Foundations
        
        The most important problems we have to tackle today are
        problems, ultimately, having to do with the moral
        foundations of society. There are people who eagerly
        accept their own freedom but do not respect the freedom
        of others-they, like the Athenians, want freedom from
        responsibility. But if they accept freedom for
        themselves, they must respect the freedom of others. If
        they expect to go about their business unhindered and
        to be protected from violence, they must not hinder the
        business of or do violence to others.
        
        They would do well to look at what has happened in
        societies without moral foundations. Accepting no laws
        but the laws of force, these societies have been ruled
        by totalitarian ideologies like Nazism, fascism, and
        communism, which do not spring from the general
        populace, but are imposed on it by intellectual elites.
        
        It was two members of such an elite, Marx and Lenin,
        who conceived of "dialectical materialism," the basic
        doctrine of communism. It robs people of all freedom-
        from freedom of worship to freedom of ownership. Marx
        and Lenin desired to substitute their will not only
        for all individual will but for God's will. They wanted
        to plan everything; in short, they wanted to become
        gods. Theirs was a breathtakingly arrogant creed, and
        it denied above all else the sanctity of human life.
        
        The l9th century French economist and philosopher
        Frederic Bastiat once warned against this creed. He
        questioned those who, "though they are made of the same
        human clay as the rest of us, think they can take away
        all our freedoms and exercise them on our behalf." He
        would have been appalled but not surprised that the
        communists of the 20th century took away the freedom of
        millions of individuals, starting with the freedom to
        worship. The communists viewed religion as "the opiate
        of the people." They seized Bibles as well as all other
        private property at gun point and murdered at least 10
        million souls in the process.
        
        Thus 20th century Russia entered into the greatest
        experiment in government and atheism the world had ever
        seen, just as America several centuries earlier had
        entered into the world's greatest experiment in freedom
        and faith.
        
        Communism denied all that the Judeo-Christian tradition
        taught about individual worth, human dignity, and moral
        responsibility. It was not surprising that it collapsed
        after a relatively brief existence. It could not
        survive more than a few generations because it denied
        human nature, which is fundamentally moral and
        spiritual. (It is true that no one predicted the
        collapse would come so quickly and so easily. In
        retrospect, we know that this was due in large measure
        to the firmness of President Ronald Reagan who said, in
        effect, to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, "Do not try
        to beat us militarily, and do not think that you can
        extend your creed to the rest of the world by force.")
        
        The West began to fight the moral battle against
        communism in earnest in the 1980s, and it was our
        resolve combined with the spiritual strength of the
        people suffering under the system who finally said,
        "Enough!"-that helped restore freedom in Eastern Europe
        and the Soviet Union-the freedom to worship, speak,
        associate, vote, establish political parties, start
        businesses, own property, and much more. If communism
        had been a creed with moral foundations, it might have
        survived, but it was not, and it simply could not
        sustain itself in a world that had such shining
        examples of freedom, namely, America and Great Britain.
        
        
                  The Moral Foundations of Capitalism
        
        It is important to understand that the moral
        foundations of a society do not | extend only to its
        political system; they must extend to its economic
        system as well. America's commitment to capitalism is
        unquestionably the best example of this principle.
        Capitalism is not, contrary to what those on the Left
        have tried to argue, an amoral system based on
        selfishness, greed, and exploitation. It is a moral
        system based on a Biblical ethic. There is no other
        comparable system that has raised the standard of
        living of millions of people, created vast new wealth
        and resources, or inspired so many beneficial
        innovations and technologies.
        
        The wonderful thing about capitalism is that it does
        not discriminate against the poor, as has been so often
        charged; indeed, it is the only economic system that
        raises the poor out of poverty. Capitalism also allows
        nations that are not rich in natural resources to
        prosper. If resources were the key to wealth, the
        richest country in the world would be Russia, because
        it has abundant supplies of everything from oil, gas,
        platinum, gold, silver, aluminum, and copper to timber,
        water, wildlife, and fertile soil.
        
        Why isn't Russia the wealthiest country in the world?
        Why aren't other resource-rich countries in the Third
        World at the top of the list? It is because their
        governments deny citizens the liberty to use their God-
        given talents. Man's greatest resource is himself, but
        he must be free to use that resource.
        
        In his recent encyclical, Centesimus Annus, Pope John
        Paul II addressed this issue. He wrote that the
        collapse of communism is not merely to be considered as
        a "technical problem." It is a consequence of the
        violation of human rights. He specifically referred to
        such human rights as the right to private initiative,
        to own property, and to act in the marketplace.
        Remember the "Parable of the Talents" in the New
        Testament? Christ exhorts us to be the best we  can be
        by developing our skills and abilities, by succeeding
        in all our tasks and endeavors. What  better
        description can there be of capitalism? In creating new
        products, new services, and new  jobs, we create a
        vibrant community of work. And that community of work
        serves as the basis of  peace and good will among all
        men.
        
        The Pope also acknowledged that capitalism encourages
        important virtues, like diligence,  industriousness,
        prudence, reliability, fidelity, conscientiousness, and
        a tendency to save in order  to invest in the future.
        It is not material goods but all of these great
        virtues, exhibited by individuals  working together,
        that constitute what we call the "marketplace."
        
        
                    The Moral Foundations of the Law
        
        Freedom, whether it is the freedom of the marketplace
        or any other kind, must exist within the  framework of
        law. Otherwise it means only freedom for the strong to
        oppress the weak. Whenever I  visit the former Soviet
        Union, I stress this point with students, scholars,
        politicians, and  businessmen-in short, with everyone I
        meet. Over and over again, I repeat: Freedom must be
        informed by the principle of justice in order to make
        it work between people. A system of laws  based on
        solid moral foundations must regulate the entire life
        of a nation.
        
        But this is an extremely difficult point to get across
        to people with little or no experience with laws
        except those based on force. The concept of justice is
        entirely foreign to communism. So, too, is  the concept
        of equality. For over seventy years, Eastern Europe and
        the Soviet Union had no  system of common law. There
        were only the arbitrary and often contradictory
        dictates of the  Communist Party. There was no
        independent judiciary. There was no such thing as truth
        in the  communist system.
        
        And what is freedom without truth? I have been a
        scientist, a lawyer, and a politician, and from my  own
        experience I can testify that it is nothing. The third
        century Roman jurist Julius Paulus said,  "What is right
        is not derived from the rule, but the rule arises from
        our knowledge of what is right." In  other words, the
        law is founded on what we believe to be true and just.
        It has moral foundations.  Once again, it is important
        to note that the free societies of America and Great
        Britain derive such  foundations from a Biblical ethic.
        
        
                   The Moral Foundations of Democracy
        
        Democracy is never mentioned in the Bible. When people
        are gathered together, whether as  families,
        communities or nations, their purpose is not to
        ascertain the will of the majority, but the  will of
        the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, I am an enthusiast of
        democracy because it is about more than  the will of
        the majority. If it were only about the will of the
        majority, it would be the right of the  majority to
        oppress the minority. The American Declaration of
        Independence and Constitution make  it clear that this
        is not the case. There are certain rights which are
        human rights and which no  government can displace. And
        when it comes to how you Americans exercise your rights
        under  democracy, your hearts seem to be touched by
        something greater than yourselves. Your role in
        democracy does not end when you cast your vote in an
        election. It applies daily; the standards and  values
        that are the moral foundations of society are also the
        foundations of your lives.
        
        Democracy is essential to preserving freedom. As Lord
        Acton reminded us, "Power tends to  corrupt, and
        absolute power corrupts absolutely." If no individual
        can be trusted with power  indefinitely, it is even
        more true that no government can be. It has to be
        checked, and the best way  of doing so is through the
        will of the majority, bearing in mind that this will
        can never be a substitute  for individual human rights.
        
        I am often asked whether I think there will be a single
        international democracy, known as a "new  world order."
        Though many of us may yearn for one, I do not believe
        it will ever arrive. We are  misleading ourselves about
        human nature when we say, "Surely we're too civilized,
        too reasonable,  ever to go to war again," or, "We can
        rely on our governments to get together and reconcile
        our  differences."  Tyrants are not moved by idealism.
        They are  moved by naked ambition. Idealism did not
        stop Hitler; it did not stop Stalin. Our best hope as
        sovereign nations is to maintain strong defenses.
        Indeed, that has been one of the most important moral
        as well as geopolitical lessons of the 20th century.
        Dictators are encouraged by weakness; they are stopped
        by strength. By strength, of course, I do not merely
        mean military might but the resolve to use that might
        against evil.
        
        The West did show sufficient resolve against Iraq
        during the Persian Gulf War. But we failed bitterly in
        Bosnia. In this case, instead of showing resolve, we
        preferred "diplomacy" and "consensus." As a result, a
        quarter of a million people were massacred. This was a
        horror that I, for one, never expected to see again in
        my lifetime. But it happened. Who knows what tragedies
        the future holds if we do not learn from the repeated
        lessons of history? The price of freedom is still, and
        always will be, eternal vigilance.
        
        Free societies demand more care and devotion than any
        others. They are, moreover, the only societies with
        moral foundations, and those foundations are evident in
        their political, economic, legal, cultural, and, most
        importantly, spiritual life.
        
        We who are living in the West today are fortunate.
        Freedom has been bequeathed to us. We have not had to
        carve it out of nothing; we have not had to pay for it
        with our lives. Others before us have done so. But it
        would be a grave mistake to think that freedom requires
        nothing of us. Each of us has to earn freedom anew in
        order to possess it. We do so not just for our own
        sake, but for the sake of our children, so that they
        may build a better future that will sustain over the
        wider world the responsibilities and blessings of
        freedom.
