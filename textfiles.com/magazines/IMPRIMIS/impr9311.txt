        Preview: In this month's Imprimis, public policy expert
        Matthew J. Glavin examines some of the issues involving
        the alleged "health care crisis." Most important, he
        warns that if we choose "managed competition" over
        genuine free market solutions, we will never be able to
        turn back--socialized health care will be here to stay.
        
             Mr. Glavin's remarks were delivered before a
        Shavano Institute for National Leadership audience in
        Atlanta last May.
        
             ---------------------------------------------
        
        Health care reform is one of the most complex public
        policy issues to face this nation since the creation of
        the social welfare programs of the 1960s. And, like the
        welfare programs of the sixties, the decisions
        currently being discussed in Washington will affect not
        only health care for millions of individual Americans,
        but the very foundations upon which our free society
        was built.
        
             Our current health care system has been
        characterized as "in crisis." What we ought to remember
        is that it is the best in the world. However, there is
        no denying that there is room for improvement and that
        there are serious problems that must be addressed.
        After all, nationwide, health care costs Americans more
        than $2 billion per day. Health policy experts have
        considered a variety of reform proposals including the
        Canadian-style universal, single-payer program. We have
        studied the "play or pay" system which would have
        instituted employer mandates. We have tried tinkering
        with insurance laws to control costs or expand access.
        And we have even heard about, albeit fleetingly,
        market-based reforms based on competition and consumer
        choice. However, many of the proposed cures currently
        being debated are worse than the disease.
        
             The centerpiece of the Clinton health care
        proposal is "managed competition." Managed competition
        is being presented as a compromise that would
        supposedly preserve many free market aspects of health
        care, while making the market more accountable to
        government control. As envisioned under the Clinton
        proposal, managed competition would establish a system
        of collective purchasing agents on behalf of employers
        and individuals. All residents of a state would be
        enrolled in one of these purchasing cooperatives,
        either through their employer or individually. The
        purchasing cooperative would negotiate on behalf of its
        members with "Accountable Health Partnerships" (now
        known as insurance companies) for a benefits package.
        This "Uniform Effective Health Benefits" package would
        be established by the government as a minimum standard
        benefits requirement.
        
             Accountable Health Partnerships would be required
        to charge all citizens the same rate, regardless of age
        or lifestyle factors. You would be charged the same
        whether you were 65 years old, smoked three packs of
        cigarettes and drank a quart of whiskey a day, and
        weighed 275 pounds or whether you were 25 years old,
        exercised an hour a day, never smoked or drank, and
        were in perfect health. You would be charged the same
        whether you were monogamous and disease-free or whether
        you had AIDS as a result of drug use or promiscuity.
        You would not realize any financial benefit because of
        the lower or higher risk you represent, resulting from
        your personal decision as to your lifestyle.
        
             Managed competition also will severely limit
        consumer choice_choice of insurer, choice of benefits,
        and choice of physician. Because the Clinton proposal
        prevents insurers from competing on the basis of their
        ability to price and manage risk, most traditional
        insurers would be driven out of the market. The
        criteria established for Accountable Health
        Partnerships essentially limit the market to "the
        Blues"--Blue Cross and Blue Shield--and a handful of
        large HMOs. The insurance business, now among the top
        10 "industries" in the United States, will no longer
        exist as we know it. The economic impact of this alone
        will have a devastating effect on the American economy.
        
             As one noted economist has said, managed
        competition is not so much a coherent government plan
        as an oxymoron. It is possible to have either managed
        health care or to have open competition in health care
        services. It is not possible to have both
        simultaneously. As proposed, managed competition
        appears to offer a great deal of management and very
        little competition.
        
        
                      Doctor-Patient Relationship
        
        While our economy may be able to survive the
        destruction of the insurance industry, an even more
        insidious problem lies ahead with managed competition.
        Managed competition holds the potential of severely
        disrupting the traditional doctor-patient relationship.
        Because everyone pays the same, regardless of current
        health status or lifestyle, managed competition changes
        the historical role of insurers from "financial
        intermediaries with expertise in underwriting risks" to
        "health care delivery systems" organizing, managing,
        and purchasing medical care.
        
             In short, the Clinton administration apparently
        believes that physicians should be responsible to
        insurers, rather than their patients. This means the
        patient's choice of a physician will be limited to give
        the insurer increased bargaining power with the doctor.
        It also means increasing insurer control over the
        physician's choice of treatment, so that insurers can
        "apply quality assurance or review appropriateness." As
        Swiss medical philosopher Ernest Truffer has noted, the
        increasing interjection of third parties between doctor
        and patient "amounts to a rejection of the medical
        ethic, which is to care for a patient according to the
        patient's specific medical requirements, in favor of a
        veterinary ethic, which consists of caring for the sick
        animal not in accordance with its specific medical
        needs, but according to the requirements of its master
        and owner, the person responsible for meeting any costs
        incurred." Are Americans willing to reject the medical
        ethic in our health care system in favor of a
        veterinary ethic?
        
        
                    The Cost of National Health Care
        
        The cost of socializing American health care has been
        estimated to run from $100 to $300 billion. Even these
        estimates may be too low, but regardless of the final
        price tag, we would be buying surprisingly little
        health care. The one common characteristic of all
        socialized health care systems is a shortage of health
        care services. For example, in Great Britain, a country
        with a population of only 55 million, the waiting list
        for surgery is more than 800,000. In New Zealand, a
        country with a population of just 3 million, the
        surgery waiting list now exceeds 50,000. In Canada,
        citizens must wait nearly 10 months for hip replacement
        surgery, 2.5 months for a mammogram, and 5 months for a
        pap smear.
        
             What do these statistics mean in our everyday
        lives? In January 1990, two-year-old Joel Bondy needed
        urgent heart surgery. It was a serious operation, but
        one that was performed many times each day in hospitals
        across America. Unfortunately, Joel did not live in
        this country. He lived in Canada, where the country's
        socialized health care system has resulted in a severe
        shortage of cardiac care facilities. Canada has only 11
        open heart surgery facilities to serve the entire
        country. The United States, by contrast, has 793.
        
             As a result, Joel's surgery was repeatedly
        postponed as more critical cases preempted the
        available facilities. Alarmed at their son's
        deteriorating condition, Joel's parents arranged for
        him to obtain surgery in Detroit. Embarrassed by the
        media coverage of Joel's situation, Canadian
        authorities told the Bondys that if they would stay in
        Canada, Joel would be moved to the top of the list and
        surgery would be performed immediately. Joel was taken
        on a four-hour ambulance ride to a hospital equipped
        for the procedure, but there was no bed available. The
        family had to spend the night in a hotel.  Joel Bondy
        died the next day.
        
             Sadly, while this is a true story, it is not the
        exception; it is the rule. Physicians in Canada report
        that, for heart surgery, you have a better chance of
        dying on the waiting list than you do of dying on the
        operating table.
        
             One basic question that has received very little
        attention throughout the recent debate is whether our
        government is even capable of providing quality health
        care at a reasonable price. For a preview of
        government-run health care programs, we need only look
        in our own backyard. Medicare and Medicaid are prime
        examples of health care delivered via bureaucracy. They
        are rife with mismanagement, fraud, and abuse. Will the
        federal government be able to control costs? History
        would suggest otherwise. Between 1987 and 1992, for
        example, total Medicaid expenditures rose at three
        times the rate of total national health expenditures.
        
             If government is not the solution to our health
        care "crisis," how do we solve its problems? How do we
        maintain quality in health care while assuring
        accessibility and affordability? The only reforms
        likely to have a significant impact are those that draw
        on the strength of the free market.
        
        
                         Deregulate Health Care
        
        There should be a thorough examination of the extent to
        which well intended but mistaken federal and state
        government policies already are responsible for rising
        health costs and the unavailability of health care
        services. I believe that such an examination will prove
        that government can lower health care costs and expand
        health care access by taking immediate steps to
        deregulate the health care industry, including
        elimination of state mandated benefits, the repeal of
        state Certificate-of-Need programs, and the expansion
        of the scope of practice for non-physician health
        professionals.
        
        
                         Restructure tax policy
        
        Current tax policy allows employers to purchase health
        insurance with pre-tax  dollars while individuals pay
        with after-tax dollars. This difference in tax
        treatment creates a disparity that effectively doubles
        the cost of health insurance for people who must
        purchase their own.
        
             For example, the family of a self-employed person
        who earns $35,000 a year and pays federal, state, and
        Social Security taxes must earn more than $7,000 to buy
        a $4,000 health insurance policy. A person working for
        a small business that offers no health insurance would
        have to earn more than $8,000 to pay for a $4,000
        policy. Tax equalization would add a measure of
        fairness to current tax policies that penalize the
        self-employed, part-time workers and employees of small
        businesses, while subsidizing health care for the most
        affluent in our society.
        
        
                 Establish Individual Medical Accounts
        
        Individual Medical Accounts (IMAs) are another key to
        controlling health care costs and strengthening the
        role of the individual as a health care consumer. An
        Individual Medical Account would work like this:
        Individuals would be exempt from taxes on money
        deposited in an IMA, in the same way they currently pay
        no taxes on deposits to Individual Retirement Accounts
        (IRAs). Money to pay medical expenses could be
        withdrawn without penalty.
        
             The current corporate insurance policy costs about
        $4,500 per year. With Individual Medical Accounts in
        place, employers could be expected to change the way
        they provide insurance. Once a year, a corporation (or
        an individual, if self-employed) would deposit $2,000
        into an employee's IMA. This money, and any interest
        accrued, would be exempt from taxes. The employer or
        individual would also purchase a catastrophic health
        insurance policy that would have a $2,000 deductible.
        The cost of the catastrophic policy would be about
        $1,800. The employer who previously provided a $4,500
        insurance policy would save $700 a year. Individuals
        could withdraw money from the IMA without penalty to
        pay medical expenses. Money left over at the end of the
        year would accumulate and belong to the individual.
        
             Only about 10 percent of families in this country
        spend more than $2,000 per year on health care. This
        means 90 percent of all doctor visits would require no
        paperwork for insurance because they would be paid
        directly by the consumer out of the IMA. This also
        would increase consumer responsibility because there
        would be an incentive to control costs; the consumer
        keeps what he doesn't spend.
        
             The use of deductibles in traditional insurance
        policies right now offers a perverse incentive,
        particularly for low-income workers. Low-income workers
        have little discretionary income, and as a result are
        often forced to forego preventive care or early
        intervention because they can't afford the deductible.
        Yet, once the deductible is met, they have no incentive
        to limit additional expenditures. With an IMA, the
        incentive is to spend wisely throughout the year.
        
             Individual Medical Accounts would also be
        completely portable. One of the most serious problems
        of our current medical system is that insurance is so
        closely linked with employment. Individuals who lose
        their jobs or change jobs often lose their health
        insurance as well. Of the estimated 37 million
        Americans uninsured at any given time, half are without
        insurance for four months or less, and only 15 percent
        are uninsured for more than two years, but it still
        leaves them vulnerable, if only for a short time. With
        an IMA, individuals would continue to have funds
        available to pay for health care during temporary
        interruptions in employment.
        
        
                           Privatize Medicaid
        
        The current Medicaid system has been one of the
        greatest failures of American government. Costs are
        skyrocketing, patients are receiving second-rate care,
        and providers are being shortchanged. Actual
        expenditures for the Medicaid program in 1992 were
        $124.6 billion. This compares with just $52.1 billion
        in 1988, meaning expenditures have increased on average
        24.4 percent annually over the last four years. The
        states' share of this joint federal/state program is
        growing twice as fast as overall state spending. In
        1970, Medicaid consumed only four percent of all state
        spending. Today, the average state spends more than 14
        percent of its budget on Medicaid.
        
             As spending increases, states are cutting back on
        their payments to health care providers. Nearly all
        states reimburse at a rate well below the actual cost
        of procedures. The result is that fewer and fewer
        providers are willing to treat Medicaid patients. Those
        providers that do treat Medicaid patients often offset
        losses by passing along the costs to patients with
        private health insurance, a practice known as cost
        shifting. The federal government should begin to
        restructure the system to give Medicaid and Medicare
        recipients more flexibility to obtain private health
        insurance that meets their individual needs. As much as
        possible, responsibility for care of the poor and the
        elderly should be moved from the public to the private
        sector.
        
             The average cost per person on Medicaid is more
        than $3,300 per year. This compares to $1,500 for a
        privately insured individual. These figures only
        include direct health care benefits; administrative
        costs are excluded. For a Medicaid family (a mother and
        two children) in the United States, we spend almost
        $10,000 per year in direct medical benefits. The
        obvious question is: "Why don't we simply privatize
        Medicaid?" Privatizing Medicaid would create market
        mechanisms that would achieve all the major goals in
        health care reform: affordability, accessibility, and
        quality.
        
             Privatization could be achieved in a variety of
        ways. Individual states could provide vouchers to
        Medicaid recipients. The value of each voucher would be
        equal to the current average Medicaid expenditure for a
        family of the same size as the recipient's family.
        Recipients may pool vouchers for the purpose of
        purchasing group policies. For example, residents of a
        public housing project may choose to pool their
        vouchers and purchase a group policy for themselves.
        Insurance policies purchased with a voucher would
        include coverage for all federally-mandated Medicaid
        services. However, all other mandated benefits,
        including optional Medicaid services could be exempted.
        Another option would allow individual states the
        ability to contract with private insurers (after
        competitive bidding) for large group policies that
        would cover Medicaid patients. The state could offer
        Medicaid patients several private options including
        traditional insurance, PPOs, or HMOs.
        
             Regardless of which method is selected,
        privatizing Medicaid would result in substantial
        benefits for Medicaid recipients, health care
        providers, and taxpayers. Medicaid recipients would no
        longer be treated differently from the privately
        insured--because they would become part of the
        privately insured. A Medicaid recipient going to a
        hospital or physician and presenting his insurance card
        would be indistinguishable from any other patient. No
        one would know how that insurance was obtained. And,
        finally, the patient would have an expanded number of
        providers to choose from, no longer excluded from the
        35 percent of physicians who refuse Medicaid.
        
             Since reimbursement would be at the same rate as
        private insurance, health care providers would no
        longer be shortchanged for treating Medicaid patients.
        Cost shifting would be eliminated, with a beneficial
        effect on all health care consumers. Further, by
        eliminating many of the costly optional benefits and by
        encouraging insurers to experiment with cost
        containment, privatization would stop the spiral of
        increasing Medicaid costs.
        
             Insurers would compete for customers on the basis
        of the benefits offered, crafting policies to meet the
        needs of the purchaser. While many of the costly
        optional benefits  no longer would be covered,
        individuals would be able to purchase a policy that
        more closely meets their individual requirements.
        Insurers also would compete on the basis of which cost
        containment mechanisms they include. Some may offer
        managed care. Others may offer co-payments and/or
        deductibles. Still others may offer fewer benefits.
        Some may even offer "lifestyle incentives" or rebates
        for nonuse. Everyone would have the freedom to choose
        the plan that is best for them.
        
        
                               Conclusion
        
        It has long been noted that the Chinese character for
        "crisis" is the same as the character for
        "opportunity." If America's health care system is
        indeed in crisis, as the Clinton administration has
        alleged, we also have a unique window of opportunity to
        reform it in a way that will make health care
        affordable and available to all Americans.
        
             What is outlined here is a series of proposals
        that tend toward increasing freedom of the market,
        proposals that draw on the strengths of competition,
        consumer choice, private ownership, and personal
        responsibility. The Clinton administration has offered
        a plan that tends in an exactly opposite direction. It
        is an about face. The Clinton proposal creates more
        centralized government control. Government bureaucrats
        will decide what services you receive. Government
        bureaucrats will decide how much you will pay.
        Government bureaucrats will decide what services your
        doctor can provide. "Competition" will be managed--not
        competitive. There will be a single source of revenue--
        the taxpayer.
        
             This is socialism! And, like the social welfare
        programs of the 1960s, once socialized health care is
        in place, we will never go back to a market-based
        system.
        
             All agree that the time for reform is here. But,
        what decisions will we, as a nation, make? Will we move
        in the right direction or are we going to make an about
        face? Will we continue to preserve the heritage of our
        founding fathers, the principles of a free society, and
        a market economy based on individual freedom and
        responsibility, or will we embrace the failed policies
        of central planning and socialism? Freedom and free
        enterprise are sweeping the globe. While Europe,
        Canada, and the former Soviet Union are searching for
        ways to restore market mechanisms to their socialized
        health care systems, America is in serious danger of
        adopting one--a bureaucratic, government-run, taxpayer-
        financed health care system that will limit patient
        choice and ration the availability of care, while doing
        nothing to hold down health care costs.
