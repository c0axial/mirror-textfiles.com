        Preview: In a series of fascinating personal
        observations, world-renowned economist Thomas Sowell
        talks about the failure of central planners and social
        engineers to improve the lot of blacks in America. He
        contrasts that failure with the success of blacks who
        have regarded hard work and determination rather than
        entitlements and victimhood as the key to getting
        ahead. He describes a bygone era in Harlem, but makes
        it clear that the values that inspired this era live
        on. Dr. Sowell's remarks were delivered during
        Hillsdale's Shavano Institute for National Leadership
        10-year anniversary gala in Colorado Springs this past
        January.
        
                     ------------------------------
        
        There is a story, which I hope is apocryphal, that the
        French police were chasing a criminal who fled into a
        building in Paris. Their first thought was that they
        would surround the building. But then they realized
        that the building was so large, and had so many exits,
        that they didn't have enough policemen on the scene to
        do that. So they surrounded the building next door,
        which was smaller and had fewer exits.
        
             Much of the academic research in the social
        sciences follows exactly this pattern of reasoning.
        
             Often we don't have information on the variables
        that matter, so we surround other variables, using
        statistics that the Census Bureau, or the Congressional
        Budget Office, or someone else has supplied to us. Last
        year, for example, both the media and the politicians
        seized upon statistics which showed that blacks
        received less prenatal care, and had higher infant
        mortality rates, than whites. The obvious answer was
        more government spending on prenatal care. Yet the very
        same study showed that Mexican Americans received even
        less prenatal care than blacks and had slightly lower
        infant mortality rates than whites.
        
             Prenatal care was the building next door.
        
             Recently, looking back over my life while writing
        some autobiographical sketches, I realized that the
        variables which economists and sociologists can measure
        are not the variables that matter. Sometimes friends
        and colleagues, at gatherings like this, introduce me
        as someone who came out of Harlem and went on to the
        Ivy League (and, better yet, the University of
        Chicago). But this presents as unique something that
        was far from unique.
        
             It was not the norm for people in Harlem to go on
        to college, but neither was it unique--not among the
        kids who grew up in Harlem in the 1940s, as I did. I am
        neither the best-known nor the most prosperous person
        to come out of the same neighborhood during the same
        era. Nor were all the others basketball players.
        
             All of the places where I lived while growing up
        in Harlem were within a ten-block radius of 145th
        Street and St. Nicholas Avenue. Within that same radius
        lived a boyhood friend named Eddie Mapp, who is today
        dean of one of the colleges in New York City. In a
        building on the corner of 145th Street and St. Nicholas
        lived another boy, named Leonti Thompson, who was not a
        friend of mine--I can recall the teacher having to
        separate us when we were fighting in class--but Leonti
        grew up to become a psychiatrist, owned property in
        California's Napa Valley, and is today retired and
        living overseas, while I still have to work for a
        living. In the same building as Leonti lived an older
        boy who also did well and who made a name for himself--
        Harry Belafonte.
        
             Within the same ten-block radius, at the same
        time, another fellow grew up to make money and a name--
        James Baldwin. Someone else who went to college within
        this same ten-block radius, though he lived elsewhere,
        was a young man named Colin Powell.
        
             Were all these simply rare individuals? Perhaps,
        but it is also true that more black males passed the
        difficult entrance examination for Stuyvesant High
        School in 1938 than in 1983, even though the black
        population of New York was much smaller in 1938. As for
        the masses of students in the Harlem public schools at
        that time, their test scores were lower than those of
        students in affluent neighborhoods, but not
        dramatically lower like today, and they were very
        similar to the test scores of white students in other
        working class neighborhoods, such as on the lower east
        side of Manhattan. During some years, the kids in
        Harlem scored higher than the kids on the lower east
        side, and in other years the kids on the lower east
        side might nose them out. But they were both in the
        same league.
        
             Ability grouping was very common in the Harlem
        schools in those days, as it was throughout the system.
        A Harlem youngster who was in the top-ability class at
        his grade level received a solid education that would
        allow him to go on and compete with anybody, anywhere.
        It is somewhat embarrassing today when people praise me
        for having gone through the Harlem schools and then on
        to Harvard. I did not go through the Harlem schools of
        today--and would be lucky to get into any college if I
        did.
        
             What is relevant to public policy is that none of
        the educational success of the past was a result of the
        kinds of policies and programs that are today being
        actively promoted in Washington or in the media. That
        is, we had none of the so-called "prerequisites" for
        quality education.
        
             We did not, for example, have racially integrated
        student bodies. Nor did we have racial role models:
        Virtually all the teachers were white. I was taught
        more about a Dutchman named Peter Stuyvesant than about
        Frederick Douglass or W.E.B. DuBois. There was no
        "community input." It is also very doubtful that we had
        "adequate funding," since there never seems to be any
        in education. Those things are all like the building
        next door.
        
             Certainly we did not have small classes and there
        were no teacher's aides. More importantly, there were
        no security guards. I was 42 years old when I first saw
        a security guard in a public school. Today, there are
        national conventions of public school security guards.
        
             No one asked us if we preferred innovative and
        "exciting" teaching, rather than "rote memory." The
        Bible says: "By their fruits ye shall know them." In
        the educational literature of today, it is "by their
        excitement ye shall know them." When they proclaim a
        new program to be "exciting," people who ask, "Does it
        work?" are regarded as party poopers.
        
             Back in the Harlem of the 1940s, no one asked if
        our homes were broken or bent. We did not sit around in
        circles unburdening our psyches, nor would anyone have
        dreamed of calling a teacher by her first name. No one
        asked what my sexual preferences were--nor would I have
        known what the question meant if they had.
        
             I was very fortunate to have gone through school
        in those days, rather than today--and that good fortune
        has benefitted me the rest of my life. It was one of
        many pieces of good fortune which I could not fully
        appreciate until years later. But my good fortune did
        not consist in the kinds of things being promoted
        today, or the kinds of things that can be measured in
        the statistics of economists or sociologists. If I had
        been raised in a home with twice the money and half the
        attention, there is no question that I would have been
        much worse off.
        
             Another piece of good fortune was meeting the kid
        named Eddie Mapp, whom I mentioned earlier. He came
        from a family with more of an educational background
        than mine, and he was more sophisticated about
        education and culture. He took me to a public library
        for the first time, and I can still recall the great
        difficulty I had understanding why we were in this
        building with all these books, when I had no money to
        buy books.
        
             Part of my good fortune consisted of the family
        that I grew up in--and part of the ill fortune of
        today's students consists of the systematic undermining
        of families, and of the traditional values that parents
        try to pass on. Nowhere is this undermining of parents
        and parental values more pervasive and systematic than
        in the public schools. You would simply have to read
        the textbooks, or see the movies shown in schools, to
        understand what a betrayal is going on behind the backs
        of parents and the public.
        
             Where I have been able to find schools with the
        kind of academic quality once taken for granted, they
        have seldom had the "prerequisites" listed by the
        education establishment. One of these schools, which I
        researched some years ago, was P.S. 39 in Brooklyn, a
        ghetto school where students scored at or above their
        grade level, even though about a third of them were on
        welfare. The building was so old that there were gas
        jets in the halls, because it was built in the era of
        gas lights, before electricity.
        
             One of the unfashionable things the school
        principal did was to have ability grouping within the
        school. This school, like so many schools, was once an
        all-white institution. As the neighborhood changed, the
        composition of the students obviously changed with it.
        I asked the principal: "Suppose someone else wants to
        reproduce what you have done here. If they have ability
        grouping, won't there be a period of transition, where
        the white kids are concentrated in the top classes and
        the black kids in the bottom classes? And even though
        that will take care of itself over time, won't you get
        a lot of flack during the transition?"
        
             His reply was: "You just take the flack." That is
        not an attitude you find among most public school
        administrators.
        
             One of the great contrasts between the schools of
        the past and the schools of today is in discipline.
        Here I speak from some experience, because I was one of
        the mischievous kids who ran afoul of that discipline,
        though not in anything like the ways kids get into
        trouble today.
        
             When my eighth-grade teacher discovered a prank in
        the classroom, she said "Oh, if I ever find out who did
        this, Sowell._"
        
             On one of the many afternoons when I was kept
        after school, Miss Karoff said sarcastically, "Well,
        here we are again, Sowell, just the two of us."
        
             "Good grief, Miss Karoff, " I said, "if we keep
        staying in after school together all the time, people
        will begin to talk."
        
             Without even looking up from her paperwork, she
        replied, "We'll just have to learn to live with the
        scandal."
        
             Today, punishing a student, much less suspending
        him, can literally be a federal case. Recently, in East
        Palo Alto, a ghetto not far from Stanford University,
        there was a legal challenge to the suspension of a
        student who kicked a teacher in the groin. The student
        had legal counsel supplied by the Stanford law school,
        which runs a project in East Palo Alto. Apparently
        Stanford thinks that they are helping the residents of
        East Palo Alto by keeping hoodlums in their schools, so
        that the other children there can't learn.
        
             Isn't it a shame that blacks don't have enough
        money to be able to hire attorneys to go over into
        white neighborhoods and create lawsuits to keep white
        hoodlums in school, so that the people at Stanford and
        similar places could understand the consequences of
        what they are doing?
        
             The great tragedy of contemporary American
        education is that actual consequences mean far less
        than prevailing myths. These myths and illusions cover
        many areas, including the role of teachers and the
        relationships between students and teachers.
        
             My great mentor, the late George Stigler at the
        University of Chicago, was not one of those who shared
        these illusions. When someone mentioned to him the
        legendary image of Mark Hopkins sitting on a log,
        talking to a student on the other end, Stigler said:
        "Sometimes you could do just as well sitting on the
        student and talking to the log." The "self-esteem"
        dogma, so much in vogue in  education today, never
        seemed to be one of Stigler's guiding principles.
        Anyone who crossed swords with George Stigler, whether
        in a classroom or otherwise, was unlikely to have his
        self-esteem raised. As for the warm and close
        relationship between student and teacher, Stigler once
        said of his own mentor, Jacob Viner: "I never threw my
        arms around Jacob Viner; he would have killed me if I'd
        tried." And I never threw my arms around George Stigler
        for exactly the same reason.
        
             There are those who believe that evaluating the
        quality of a teacher means having someone sitting in
        the classroom, observing what is going on, and then
        writing up a report afterward. Many would apply this
        procedure all the way up to the college level. From my
        own experience, I think this is both a mistaken and a
        dangerous idea.
        
             What goes on in a classroom is neither the sum
        total of teaching nor even the most important part of
        teaching. Certainly during my own teaching career, at
        least half the work of a course consisted of preparing
        the course, and all of that took place before the first
        student showed up.
        
             One of my teachers in college, Professor Arthur
        Smithies, never would have passed the classroom
        examination test. Smithies used to sort of drift into
        the classroom, almost as if he had meant to go
        somewhere else and had taken the wrong turn. He would
        wander around the room, look out the window, and become
        fascinated by the traffic in Harvard Square. Then,
        being a polite fellow, he would realize that we were
        still there, and turn to say something to us. Students
        thought he was a terrible teacher. But, in fact, his
        course shaped my whole career.
        
             Professor Smithies taught the history of economic
        thought, and through him I became interested in that
        subject which became my professional specialization in
        economics. It was through Smithies' course that I first
        learned of George Stigler. After reading an article by
        Stigler among the assignments in that course I resolved
        that I would study under him in graduate school.
        
             Had you observed Stigler himself in class, he was
        much better than Arthur Smithies. But  I am sure that
        there would be other teachers whom you could not have
        distinguished from George Stigler in the classroom--
        except by the substance of what he said. Only if you
        could understand and appreciate his substance would you
        realize that here was one of the great minds of our
        time.
        
             Education professors may believe that there is
        such a thing as teaching independently of what is being
        taught, but that is one of the reasons our schools are
        so bad. The notion that some college dean, especially
        from one of those large universities with 20,000 or
        30,000 students, could sit in classrooms with
        professors from 30 or 40  different disciplines and
        form any intelligent idea of what they were saying in
        substance--such a notion boggles the mind.
        
             I had another reminder of my good fortune a few
        years ago, when my niece confessed to me that she had
        harbored a number of resentments over the years. One
        thing that provoked her resentment was when her father
        and I would talk about the old days when I was growing
        up, and all the things we did together, sane and
        insane. What made her resentful was that he never did
        any of those things with her. Her resentments were also
        on behalf of her brother, as well as herself. Her
        father, she said, "treated you better than he treated
        his own son." When I thought about it, I realized that
        she was probably right. The reason was simple: I
        happened to come along earlier, at a time when her
        parents were a couple of carefree young people with two
        salaries and no children, and with lots of time, much
        of it given to me.
        
             This good fortune, like so many of the factors
        that go into shaping people's lives, consisted of
        things which are utterly uncontrollable by the
        government, or by any other human institution. Had I
        been born five years earlier or five years later, there
        is no question that I would have been worse off. If you
        looked at the kinds of statistical indices used by
        economists and sociologists, my niece came from a
        better environment than I did, but it was not an
        environment that was able to offer her as much as my
        environment offered me.
        
             The whole notion that you can equalize opportunity
        in the things that matter is utopian. Some years ago,
        there was a study of National Merit Scholarship
        finalists broken down by the size of the family they
        came from, from two-child families to five-child
        families. In each family size, the first-born became a
        National Merit finalist more often than all the other
        children put together. Here we are talking about
        children born of the same parents and raised under the
        same roof. Yet even though heredity and environment, as
        those terms are conventionally defined, have both been
        held constant, nevertheless here is a major disparity
        in outcomes.
        
             Clearly, conventional statistics do not measure
        what really matters, nor are policy-makers who rely on
        such statistics able to do much more than surround the
        building next door.
