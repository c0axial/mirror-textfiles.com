        Preview: There have been many explanations offered for
        social problems like crime and drug abuse in American
        society. But, as Chuck Colson argues, most of these
        explanations, even when they touch upon the breakdown
        of values, avoid addressing the fundamental question,
        "Can we be good without God?" His remarks were
        delivered at the 73rd Shavano Institute for National
        Leadership seminar, "Culture Wars," in Palm Beach,
        Florida, for over 400 business and community leaders
        from around the country.
        
             ---------------------------------------------
        
        Last December, newspapers ran a striking photograph of
        a group of people held at bay by armed guards. They
        were not rioters or protesters; they were Christmas
        carolers. The town of Vienna, Virginia, had outlawed
        the singing of religious songs on public property. So
        these men, women, and children were forced to sing
        "Silent Night" behind barricades, just as if this were
        Eastern Europe under communist rule instead of
        Christmas in America in 1992.
        
             We have spent the past 30 years determined to
        secularize our society. Somemonths before the incident
        in Virginia, the U.S.Supreme Court ruled in Lee vs.
        Weisman that a rabbi who delivered a very politically
        correct "To Whom It May Concern" prayer at a Rhode
        Island junior high school commencement had violated the
        constitutional rights of a fifteen-year-old student in
        the audience. The Court said, in effect, that the girl
        must be legally protected against listening to views
        she disagreed with. There was a time when it was a mark
        of civility to listen respectfully to different views;
        now you have a constitutional right to demand that
        those views are not expressed in your presence.
        
             In another case that went all the way to the
        Supreme Court, visual religious symbols have been
        banned. Zion, Illinois, in the "heartland of America,"
        was forced to eliminate the cross featured in its city
        seal, because the Justices ruled it a breach of the
        First Amendment.
        
             In education, the same kind of court-enforced
        secularism has been so successful that teachers may
        hand out condoms in school, but they are forbidden to
        display a copy of the Ten Commandments on a bulletin
        board. Students, meanwhile, may indulge in almost any
        kind of activity in school, but they are forbidden to
        pray.
        
             The Supreme Court is not the only institution out
        to protect us from the "threat" faith poses. The media
        assault upon religious believers has been fierce.
        Cardinal O' Connor has been excoriated by the New York
        Times for even suggesting that he might deny the
        sacraments to a pro-choice legislator. (This was the
        same New York Times that praised a Louisiana archbishop
        who refused to administer communion to a segregationist
        legislator in 1962.)
        
             In February of 1993, the Washington Post featured
        a front-page article that characterized evangelical
        Christians as "largely poor, uneducated, and easy to
        command." If a journalist said that about any other
        group in America, he would be fired on the spot, but
        the Post didn't fire anyone. It merely expressed
        surprise that many readers found the description
        offensive. A few days later, one of the bemused editors
        explained that they felt they were simply printing
        something that is "universally accepted."
        
             It is no wonder that Peter Berger, professor of
        sociology at Boston University, says that if you look
        around the world you will find that the most religious
        country  is India, and the most irreligious country is
        Sweden--and America is an interesting combination of
        Indians who are governed by Swedes.
        
        
                        A Post-Christian Society
        
        These Swedes have done their job well. In 1962, polls
        indicated that at least 65 percent of all Americans
        believed the Bible to be true. In 1992, polls indicate
        that only 32 percent do, while 50 percent say that they
        actually fear fundamentalists. If the polls are right,
        our Judeo-Christian heritage is no longer the
        foundation of our values. We have become a post-
        Christian society.
        
             The process of "shedding" our religion began with
        the cultural revolution of the 1960s, which exalted
        existentialism and a kind of "live-for-the-moment-God-
        is-dead-or-irrelevant" philosophy. Today, that Sixties
        philosophy has become mainstream; it is in the White
        House, it is in the poetry of Maya Angelou, it is in
        every walk of life. This is not to say that people
        aren't going to church. Forty-four percent of the
        American people still attend religious services
        regularly. But we live in a Donahue-ized culture in
        which we sit and watch, hour by hour, the banality that
        passes for knowledge on television, and we rarely think
        about issues in terms of Judeo-Christian truth. We hear
        carolers singing "Silent Night" or an invocation at a
        public ceremony and we are filled with trepidation; we
        are worried that we are infringing upon the rights of
        nonbelievers. We see the symbol of the cross and we
        feel compelled to paint it out because it might violate
        the principle of separation between church and state.
        We exalt tolerance, not truth, as the ultimate virtue.
        
        
                            The City of Man
        
        Can we really sustain the city of man without the
        influence of the City of God? St. Augustine argued that
        it was impossible.
        
             Any society, especially a free society, depends on
        a moral consensus and on shared assumptions: What is
        ultimate reali ty? What is meaningful in life? By what
        standards should we be governed? These common values
        are the glue that holds society together.
        
             In America, the glue is wearing pretty thin. We
        are in the middle of an identity crisis in which we are
        attempting to redefine our basic values all over again.
        We can no longer assume that right and wrong have clear
        meanings or that there is universal truth. After all,
        pollsters tell us that sixty-seven percent of the
        American people say there is no such thing.
        
             What we fail to realize, however, is that
        rejecting transcendental truth is tantamount to
        committing national suicide. A secular state cannot
        cultivate virtue--an old-fashioned word you don't hear
        much in public discourse these days. In his classic
        novel, The Brothers Karamazov, the 19th century Russian
        novelist Dostoyevsky asked, essentially, "Can man be
        good without God?" In every age, the answer has been
        no. Without a restraining influence on their nature,
        men will destroy themselves. That restraining influence
        might take many abstract forms, as it did for the
        Greeks and Romans, or it might be the God of the Old
        and the New Testaments. But it has always served the
        same purpose.
        
             Even before Dostoyevsky posed his timeless
        question, an 18th century German professor of logic and
        metaphysics, Immanuel Kant, had already dismissed it as
        irrelevant. God exists, said Kant, but he is separate
        from the rest of life. Over here are the things that we
        can empirically know; over there are things we can
        accept only on faith. What does that do to ethics?
        Kant's answer was to separate them from faith; we can,
        on our own, with only our rational capacities to depend
        upon, develop what he called the "categorical
        imperative." He explained: "Act as if the maxim from
        which you act were to become through your will a
        universal law."
        
             This rational, subjective view is the basis of
        ethics being taught in nearly every school in America
        today, from Public Grammar School No. 1 to Harvard
        Business School. Students are never exposed to
        traditional moral teaching in school, only to
        rationalism. Pragmaticism and utilitarianism are
        substituted for Judeo-Christian ethics, and students
        are taught that they have the inner capacity to do good
        rationally, apart from God.
        
        
                    The Danger of Self-Righteousness
        
        Nothing could be more dangerous. Let me give you a case
        study: Chuck Colson. I grew up in the Depression years.
        My dad, who was the son of a Swedish immigrant, used to
        tell me two things on Sunday afternoon. Although no one
        in my family had ever gone to college, he said, "If you
        work hard, you can get to the top. That's the American
        dream." And the second thing he used to say was,
        "Always tell the truth. No matter what you do in life,
        always tell the truth."*
        
             I kept both of these pieces of advice in mind as I
        grew up, earned a scholarship to college and then went
        on to law school. I also remembered them when I joined
        a very successful law firm and years later in 1969 when
        President Nixon asked me to come to work at the White
        House. I took everything I had earned and put it into a
        blind trust. (If you want to make a small fortune, let
        me tell you how: You take a large fortune and put it in
        a blind trust.) I did everything to avoid even the
        appearance of a conflict of interest. I passed
        unsolicited gifts on to my employees. I refused to see
        people whom I had practiced law with or made business
        deals with--I mean, I really had studied Kant's
        categorical imperative, and I knew that I would always
        do right.
        
             What happened? I went to prison.
        
             Why? Because we are never more dangerous than when
        we are feeling self-righteous. We have an infinite
        capacity for this feeling and for the self-
        justification that accompanies it. It was only when
        Jesus Christ came into my life that I was able to see
        myself for who I am. Indeed, it is only when we all
        turn to God that we begin to see ourselves as we really
        are--as fallen sinners desperately in need of His
        restraint and His grace.
        
             Kant's philosophy, like much Enlightenment
        thought, was based on a flawed view of human nature
        that held that men are basically good and, if left to
        their own devices, will almost always do good things.
        It was also dead wrong in assuming that the categorical
        imperative could take the place of moral law. Just
        because men can think the right thing, it does not mean
        that they will heed it. Remember Pierre, one of the
        central characters in Tolstoy's War and Peace? Torn by
        spiritual agonies, he cried out to God, "Why is it that
        I know what is right and I do what is wrong?" We can
        know what is right, but we don't always have the will
        to do what is right.
        
        
                           How Shall We Live?
        
        In books like Mere Christianity and The Abolition of
        Man, the 20th century British Christian apologist C.S.
        Lewis attempted to refute Kant and make a powerful
        intellectual case for the City of God that did not wall
        it off from the city of man. In an essay entitled, "Men
        Without Chests," he drew an analogy between the
        spiritual life and the body that sums up his objections
        to the supreme rationalism of the Enlightenment. The
        head, Lewis said, is reason, and the stomach is passion
        or appetite. The head alone cannot control the stomach.
        It needs the chest, which is spirit, to restrain our
        baser passions and appetites.
        
             Yet after World War II schools began to teach
        ethics based on subjective standards without
        transcendent moral truths. Lewis challenged this,
        writing, "We make men without chests and we expect of
        them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and we
        are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate
        and bid the geldings be fruitful." That is what we are
        doing in America today. We are taking away the
        spiritual element and abandoning morality based on
        religious truth, counting instead on our heads and our
        subjective feelings to make us do what is right.
        
             In our zeal to accommodate our so-called
        enlightened and tolerant age, we have lost the ideal of
        public virtue. I am reminded of Samuel Johnson, who,
        upon learning that one of his dinner guests believed
        morality was merely a sham, said to his butler, "Well,
        if he really believes that there is no distinction
        between virtue and vice, let us count the spoons before
        he leaves." Today, there aren't any spoons left to
        count. Look at Washington, Wall Street, academia,
        sports, the ministry--all the spoons are gone because
        we can no longer distinguish between virtue and vice.
        
             Recovering that ability depends on asking the
        right questions. Our brightest and best leaders are
        concerned with the question, "How shall we be
        governed?" But in the Book of Ezekiel the Jews asked:
        "How shall we live?" It doesn't matter who governs if
        society has no spiritual element to guide it. Unless we
        learn how to live--as men with chests--we are doomed.
        
        
                            The City of God
        
        I have seen this truth most powerfully in the area in
        which I've been called to spend my life. With the help
        of my friend Jack Eckerd and others, I work with men
        and women in prison in 54 countries around the world.
        The crisis is grave. In Washington, D.C., for example,
        46 percent of the inner city black population between
        the ages of 18 and 31 is either in prison, on parole,
        or on probation. America as a whole has the highest per
        capita rate of incarceration in the world, and, for the
        last 25 years, the crime rate has gone up every year.
        We can't build prisons fast enough. In the last seven
        years, we have seen a 120 percent increase in murders
        committed by those between the ages of 18 and 20.
        According to some sources, twenty percent of all
        schoolchildren carry a weapon.
        
             Criminologist James Q. Wilson, among others, has
        tried to identify the root cause of this epidemic of
        violence. When he began his inquiry, he was certain
        that he would discover that in the great period of
        industrial revolution in the latter half of the 19th
        century there was a tremendous increase in crime. But,
        to his astonishment, he discovered a decrease. And then
        he looked at the years of the Great Depression. Again,
        there was a significant decrease in crime. Frustrated
        by these findings which upset all our preconceived
        notions, Wilson decided to search for a single factor
        to correlate. The factor he found was religious faith.
        
             When crime should have been rising in the late
        1800s because of rapid urbanization, industrialization,
        and economic dislocation, Victorian morality was
        sweeping across America. It was a time of intense
        spirituality. It was not until the conscious rejection
        of Victorian morality during the Roaring Twenties that
        crime went up. This was the era when Sigmund Freud's
        views were coming into vogue among "thinking"
        Americans: people weren't evil, just misguided or
        mistreated, or they required better environments. Sin
        was regarded as a lot of religious claptrap.
        
             The crime rate did not decline again until the
        Great Depression, a time of people banding together in
        the face of crisis. Wilson concluded, therefore, that
        crime was in large part caused by a breakdown of
        morality. Since 1965 the crime rate has steadily risen.
        In the same period, religious faith has waned. We have
        told people there are no absolutes and that they are
        not responsible for their own behavior. They are simply
        victims of a system that isn't working anymore and they
        don't have to worry about it because the government is
        going to fix it for them. We thought that in this brave
        new world we could create the perfect secular utopia.
        But the secular utopia is in reality the nightmare we
        see as we walk through the dark, rotten holes we call
        prisons all across America.
        
             In this context, it always amazes me when I listen
        to politicians say, "We are going to win the war on
        drugs by building prisons, appointing more judges, and
        putting more police on the beat. I remember when
        President Bush announced the "War on Drugs." Having
        spent seven months in prison, there wasn't one night
        that I did not smell marijuana burning. If you can get
        marijuana into a prison, with watchtowers, inspections,
        and prison guards, you can get it into a country. You
        can send the U.S. Marines to Colombia to burn all the
        fields, seal all the borders, and build all the prisons
        you want, but you won't stop drug use in this country
        because it isn't a problem of supply; it is a problem
        of demand. When there is no greater value in the lives
        of so many people than simply fulfilling individual
        desires and gratifications, then crime and drug abuse
        become inevitable. The soaring crime rate is powerful
        testimony to the failure of the city of man, deprived
        of the moral influence of the City of God.
        
             If we cannot be good without God, how do we
        sustain public virtue in society? We cannot do it
        through the instrument of politics. Alasdair MacIntyre,
        moral philosopher at Notre Dame, says that "Politics
        has become civil war carried on by other means."
        Without moral authority to call upon, our elected
        leaders are reduced to saying, "We can't say that this
        is right and that's wrong. We simply prefer that you
        wouldn't murder." And crime and drug abuse are not the
        only results of this loss of moral authority. Forty-
        four percent of the baby boomers say that there is no
        cause that would lead them to fight and die for their
        country.
        
             In the city of man, there is no moral consensus,
        and without a moral consensus there can be no law.
        Chairman Mao expressed the alternative well: in his
        view, morality begins at the muzzle of a gun.
        
             There has never been a case in history in which a
        society has been able to survive for long without a
        strong moral code. And there has never been a time when
        a moral code has not been informed by religious truth.
        Recovering our moral code--our religious truth--is the
        only way our society can survive. The heaping ash
        remains at Auschwitz, the killing fields of Southeast
        Asia, and the frozen wastes of the gulag remind us that
        the city of man is not enough; we must also seek the
        City of God.
