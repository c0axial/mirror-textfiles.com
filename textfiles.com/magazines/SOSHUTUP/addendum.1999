	It's been a few years now since the last issue of [SOSHUTUP] was released, I still hope that people read it and get something out of it. The times when those were written is almost a blur to me now, I can only remember sitting with fifteen at 3 in the morning drinking iced-tea and eating those damn meat patties that fifteen loved so much while we laughed nearly to tears when writing some of the stuff we put in [SOSHUTUP].
	We tried to put together a fourth issue of [SOSHUTUP], but we just couldn't do it. We had several pieces written for it, but shortly after my Amiga computer had a harddrive crash and we lost everything. Once that took place, we just never bothered with it. It's too bad really, I did enjoy writing those issues. I think the best is when the people who read it get extremely angry at us and feel compelled to rage at me through email.
	But, those days are gone now. Only 3 issues and we went down, but it was definately worth the time to do them. I think we released the first one on Christmas Eve of 1993, and the second one on Saint Patricks Day of 1994 and the final one was released January 19th, 1995.
	I haven't spoken to fifteen in a couple of years now so the chances of us releasing the fourth issue of [SOSHUTUP] is virtually non-existant.
	One last quick note, to everyone who read the magazine and either laughed or ended up angry as a result, thank's for reading it. If you want, drop me a line at ridleys1@home.com, those email addresses that are in [SOSHUTUP] don't work anymore. 

Jack the Lad.
