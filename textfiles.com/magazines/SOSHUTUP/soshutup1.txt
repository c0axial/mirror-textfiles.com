                                 The Abyss Of

                               [fifteen/ssu#0]


   We hereby announce the existance of a most insidious organization. It's
decomposed, sickly, a waste. Never have you, the upwardly mobile denizens of
Calgary been presented with such well-timed stupidity. What you will find in
this publication will shock, annoy, offend and bore. It is for cautious eyes
only, enduring eyes only. The organization I speak of is an almost unknown, a
mere ship passing in the night; [SOSHUTUP!] The Society of Skene Harmony,
Unity, Trust & Unbiased Propriety! Our purpose is to destroy the standards
of the local bbs skene with our moronic jokes, our obnoxious sense of humors,
and an ample supply of unfunny pranks. In this newsletter(There's no news in
here by the way) you will find nothing of intellectual or cultural value. Be
warned, many an opportunity will arise for you to insult OUR intelligence.

Inevitably, and eventually you are going to ask one thing right?

"Why did we do it?"

The only people who will enjoy this are sick, SICK! They need a treatment of
depraved and childish material to satsify the various neurotic and psychotic
disorders that they have been plagued with since, probably, their early
adolescense. If there is no one to appeal to and inflame their delusions than
they will begin a healing cycle which will lead to their introduction into
society. We can't have this, no, we pledge life and limb to oppose it. A
person should be entitled to their sickness just as they are entitled to the
their freedom. At [SOSHUTUP!], we are quick to give praise to the mad
delusions of self-proclaimed prophets. These people, so commonly called the
'insane', are in the most perfect state of mind. Mental illness is a
euphoric, a wave-length for whatever God there is to communicate with, a
divine microphone. The words of the almighty himselves(note the plural) is
transmitted to them as if they were a lightning rod aimed at the Heaven(note
the singular). If we condemn these people, we are condemning the spirituality
and theology of all mankind. We must raise them above our stations, above the
petty day-to-day aims, and for god's sake stop sedating them!!

  I digress. This first issue is a retrospective on the events of
[SOSHUTUP!]. It's completely one-sided and allows for no consideration of any
opinion except our own. We hate to hear what other people think and would
much rather pollute the world with this brand of whining drone. If you
expected this to be an open-minded forum for political thought snd
discussion, you are going to be sorely disappointed. Worse even, if you
expected this publication to be one of those things where people talk about
the freedom of information and try to rehash already stale ideas about the
Computer Underground -- well, let's just be fair and say that since we don't
actually have beliefs that you won't find any of that here. [SOSHUTUP!] is
also set down a lot of time and effort to encourage widespread apathy and
mediocrity, and for this we are quite proud. This is an attack on free
thought and creativity, we'll never settle for so much. You'll probably want
to quit your text reader now and remove this filth from your drive. We oblige
you too. This is only for people who don't care.

  [SOSHUTUP!] is happy to announce that for this issue we will be joined by
the writers of [SOSTUPIDA!], our sister organization. The Society of Stupid
Antics is a small action group designed to incite panic and disappointment in
the literary community of this fair city. It is their belief that a person can
slash the expectations of story-readers by presenting them with dull and
recycled stories that are completely exempt of descriptive passages.
Scattered strategically throughout this magazine are [SOSTUPIDA!] propaganda
stories. Don't worry, we're not trying to brainwash you, just yet. But we
thought we would be as kind as to show you what kind of work we are doing for
the community. If you do however feel that you are being subjected to some
form of subliminal manipulation, it is best that you send a prolific cheque or 
money order to our postal box(We'll give you the address when we remember it).
The motto of [SOSTUPIDA!] is "No Genre Immune", almost a lifestyle for them as
you will come to know in a short amount of time.

  Something I wish to explain for our more astute readers is the amount of
politically orientated articles in this newsletter(Did I mention there wasn't
any news?). These are not intended to be at all serious, the main reason they
are there is so that people will ridicule us. They(as well as a lot of stuff
in here) were released individually a few months ago, and recieved many
complaints. We don't want you to complain, because that means you're making a
stand and that's not good. Sit back, don't enjoy them, but banish all care
from your mind. We don't like politics, and if you can read them with extreme
tolerance than you've done something really admirable. Political tolerance is
the first step towards total apathy, uh-huh.

You're now prepared to enter our world. If nothing else, I hope that at least
one person chuckles.

                                   Mark Fury
 

                   FOUNDER OF THE MARXIST FURY ACTION GROUP
                    
            Forever dedicated to change in society through violent
            opposition of the concepts of State Controlled Power
            and LIES! orchestrated strictly by the Capitalists who
            own society and wish to destroy the Proleteriat.
            



(Disclaimer- Any reference to violent acts such as: hanging, lynching,
shooting, kneecapping, firebombing, killing, maiming, destorying, assasinating
or other such graphic  descriptions are purely used to describe the neccesity
for action against the Middle and Upper Class. They are not serious. They are
just the artist expressing his intense hatred for Modern Society and his
opinions are his and his only. Remember, brothers, we still have freedom of
speech. Viva La Revelucion!!)
 
 
 
A: "Death the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people!"


	The dirty writhing pigs are beating down our heroes everyday. The Black
Panthers and SLA are ideas of the past, in our moderate apathetic society where
violence is disdained and not considered a meaningful protest. We are sheeps in
the eyes of the conspiring NAZI governments who produce for us all the
pleasures of the flesh so that we will never rise up and destroy everything
they stand for. We must take up illegal firearms and gouge the eyes out of all
those who dare to oppress blacks, homosexuals, the poor, the working class and
various other minority groups. A violent bloody revolutions is our only chance
for freedom, with the heads of the pigs on stakes and the politicians set up
against a wall and shot DEAD! There is no room for democracy. There is no room
for peaceful protest. We are killing ourselves by abiding the rules. It is we
who allows the "Kindler Gentler Death Squads" to evolve and it is we who
creates and perpetuates the savages called politicians. We must manufacture 1
bomb for every one of their bombs, we must detonate one bomb for every bomb
that they threaten to use on us. The only solution is to lynch all the greedy
bastards who want to make us into slaves.
 
 
B: Where to attack, smoothly and silently.
 
 
	The shopping malls are destroying the youth and mass-production is making
us concentrate our energies on political moderation. We must channel our hate
for the state, and state how we really feel with the brunt of an explosion and
the bullets from our loaded guns. Start with your boss, then kill white cops by
decapitating the blue bodies and then the politicians by disembowelling them
with a broadsword. If the state is going to be smashed we must rise.
 
 
C: Environmental TERROR!
 
 
	Newspapers, styrofoam cups, television sets.. what do I see? The plastic
mass-production and abuse of the industries and the NAZI lies that are raping
our children with their subtelty and abuse. What weapons do we have? Our
limited freedom, and pot. Pot is the true representation of the fears of
society. It represents casuality, promiscuity, absolute freedom and
rebelliousness. For every joint you smoke you are scoring a point against the
system because the more the supress you the more you realize the mission you
have to achieve. ALso grow your hair long because it also represents your
chance to become an individual and not a
yuppie-environmental-consumption-death-machine!!
 
	It is up to you, the youth and if you don't have a gun than you have a
knife, an axe, sword or flail. Strike back at Fascist agression and use your
intelligence to win the war against our society. Brothers, stand, rise,
DESTROY!
 
 
D: Brothers In Prison
 
 
	This is written not only for those who want to wage a war against society.
But also for those who have already raised their fist against Fascist
agression. The fight is not over, we need you now more than ever. Your actions
are appreciated.
 
 
E: Examples of Fascist Agression
 
 -Lobster refinery. Lobsters are among the most intelligent creatures on earth
and the enslavement of these proud stalwart crustaceans is indeed an injustice. 
We need to destory Lobster refineries and protestr against restaurants which
serve lobsters or any related species. Crustaceans Now! is an organization
dedicated to freeing lobsters from the foolish whims of mankind and has taken
credit for many terrorist actions against those who dare to attempt to bring us
down. We support fully the actions of Crustaceans Now! and will personally
vouche for this organization as a legitimate leftist group. Stop the pain.
 
 -Childrens Television. Sesame Street and other such shows are very confusing
for our youth who must take the burden of a "fucked up world" onto their weak
fragile shoulders. Childrens Television is clearly only a means to convince
people that there is hope for our world and that such things like education are
not just ploys to make impressionable children want to go out and get careers
and continue to destroy the environment and kill the Proleteriat. Mister Rogers
is a show based on religious and monetary power and shamelessly prepares
children to adapt to the biased power structures of society(which are based
purely on greed and deception). If you want to help in our fight than make sure
your children never watch television aimed for Children and never attend school
for it is truly another plot.
 
 -Beefarming. Beefarmers exploit insects into creating honey for financial
gain. Bees are not given the wage that we are entitled too, and must often
carries things many times the weight of their own bodies. Also, they are
injected with chemicals to cool their natural instincts and fended off and
tortured with smoke. Think of the plight of these courageous little insects,
and stop taking what they do for us for granted. It is time that we, who
claim to be civilized, begin to acknowledge that many species of insect and
animal alike are equal to mankind. Bees outnumber us and are much more
responsible for their habitats than man has ever been. We have very much to
learn from them.
(As to not be speci-ist we also wish to make it known that we feel the same
about Wasps and Hornets. Although they do not produce honey, they are certainly
worthwhile and valid insects.)

******************************************************************************
  Today in Canada, there is much cause for alarm. There is a rampant spread 
 of insidious ideals which are capable of threatening the existance of all 
 the things we enjoy and cherish in life. It is now beginning to weave it's 
 way into our homes, into our schools and into our social lives. It is first
 important to us to formulate and identify the threat for all that it is and
 in these early stages decide on how to combat it. This file is a utility
 designed exactly for this purpose.
******************************************************************************
 
  The Economy:
  -----------
 
   It is agreeable to people of all political persuasions that there is a
  recession in the economy in this nation. We all have our ideas as to
  where the problem lies, but I would like to interject a few new ideas.
  Our attackers have chosen a particularily vulnerable time in our 
  political and economical history. In this time where inflation is high
  and the standard of living is low, there is much need for change. With
  the entire precept of change, and the common acceptance among all 
  citizens of a problem there will be suggestions from all circles of
  thought. Some will suggest a reliance of social services, such as 
  welfare, UIC, and medicare. Others will suggest a stronger yet more
  decisive change which may include subverting a so-called 
  "sick morality", or eliminating the existance of civilization and society
  completely. Politically, these people are among the more supposedly
  open-minded and humanistic left wing. These people are also not among
  the median of political thought, they in any other time, would easily
  be deemed radicals and their ideas impractical. But as despair seeps in,
  confusion reigns. The ideas I speak of, and am not giving credit to are
  placed on the far left and are disguised by names like: socialism, 
  communism, liberalism, humanism, anarchism, marxism, maoism, leninism,
  bolshevism, sovietism, and stalinism. 

   The youth are particularily corruptible, with these new fangled college
  courses stressing a removal from economic growth and financial success
  and instead teaching about the acceptance of the less-conservative
  political movements and meanwhile stereotyping the right wing as being
  outdated and non-humanistic. Environmentalism and civil rights movements
  will not even accept a right-wing minded person as they are started by
  mainly the younger generation and are totally indicative of the favorance
  of left wing thought in our education system. Yet this is only one example
  of the sympathy given to the political left, and that denied to the
  political right. Now imagine how this will affect the voter, or the new 
  voter in the decision that is made. The automatic tendency will lean 
  towards the moderate and left, while the right will be denied even the
  chance of being elected. We all can generally agree that education has
  a direct affect on the economic system of a country, as the highly educated
  will generally contribute the most while the least educated will make a
  less substantial contribution. If the highly educated are only among one
  political belief, than only one political belief will be represented in our
  society. Thus I conclude that our economy is being manipulated by the
  the extreme and moderate left as to eliminate right wing attitudes from
  Canadian living. I will also go as far as to suggest that this very well
  may be the cause for our recession, as from my observation it seems that
  the education system has been dilluted with left wing thinking from at 
  least the late-60's. 


  The Government:
  --------------

   Lies plus Subversion equal Conspiracy, it's a known fact. Lets start
  out with the lies factor first; now here we have lies in the electoral
  system. They first start out as politically motivating speeches about 
  such things as the deficit or free speech, which to the voter, these 
  seem most innocent at first, but then they work their way to the top
  of the political chain. When they get to the top, or when the voter
  decides this is the kind of thing he wants in his country, they become
  very destructive. See the transition? From innocent to destructive.
  Now let me explain.
   
   We hear daily about all sorts of "new" issues about feminism, equal
  opportunity, liberal guilt, censorship, multiculturalism, `peace', 
  and capital punishment. We all have our conceptions about which side 
  you have to favour to be of whatever political persuasion but our faith
  in these issues are a deception at best. It's commonly accepted that 
  these things are the essence of politics. But realistically, it's just
  talk, no matter how hard you believe it is up to a politician to decide
  and there is absolutley no clause or contract which dictates that a 
  politician must tell the truth. Truth is not really what we are after
  here, it's the distinction between left and right and which side you
  are entitled to trust. Let us look at political development:
 
  At the beginning of most societies, a leader emerges and is a king
  or emperor and has complete unquestioned control over his domain.
  He makes decisions for all his people, and is responsible for the
  decisions he makes which equate basically to the well-being of his
  people. We know that the kingdoms of old were very dictatoral, and
  very non-concscious of the actual well-being of the people and that
  was their demise. Some kingdoms moderated slightly, and democracy was
  accepted while naturally others ceased to exist. This moderation was
  welcome because it demonstrated a symbiotic relationship between
  government and citizen(which I praise). Such systems have been dominant
  in the major economies of the world for 200-300 years or more and
  occasionally less. They are what I will call traditionalist, and 
  technically because they are more familiar and established. The nature
  of tradition is not deceptive, in fact because it's so familiar it
  has nothing to hide and it doesn't have to establish itself so there
  will be no concealing or rationalizing of it. The tradition while
  admittedly left wing in nature is quite right wing in the modern day.
  It is almost certainly very conservative, and we continue to follow it
  because it rarely has abandoned us or brought us down. Now, left wing
  ideas and communism while being just as old are not by any means a 
  tradition or established concrete thing. Thus they will almost be
  forced into concealing their true nature with deception and lies 
  because they flow against a traditionalist way of life. This is the first
  factor of our equation -- Lies.

   Subversion is a very similar thing to lies, and is most usually the result
  of the lies which may be told. Subversion basically means to overtake or 
  ruin and an example is what I pointed out in my theory about education. It
  in the example of communist/leftist takeover is the saturation of the 
  currently established traditionalist order in place of a different and
  harmful new order. This is a part of reality, as our women tend to wear
  less and less clothing and our youth inherit a criminal mind and deal drugs
  to raise money for the communist revolution in North American society. It's
  this slow development that we least expect, and will slowly weaken us. It
  is this slow development tactic that the communist has adopted, and it is
  this slow development that is perfectly defined by the word "Subversion".
  I will let you all think of your own example of this Subversion, but it is
  very apparent to me that it has become a part of our lives in a big way.
  
   Once again, Lies plus Subversion equal Conspiracy. With this, I hope you
  will see that there is a communist and leftist conspiracy. It has infected
  us almost to the point where we no longer have control over it. 


 Here's a few tips on how to remove the Communist influence from your
 life:

  - Don't recycle. Recycling is an idea attached to the majority of
    environmental organizations. Environmentalism is definitely a
    cog in the machine of Communist takeover.

  - Don't support social services, they are merely a way for Communists
    to raise extra financial support for our government. 

  - Freedom of Speech in the form of unrestricted rights is also another
    tool of "their" revolution. With no restriction on freedom of speech
    it would be so easy for Communists to publish revolutionary tactics
    and rhetoric in the form of books, poems, and heavy metal/punk rock
    music. 

  - Feminism is a ploy to involve women in the front lines of Guerrilla
    Warfare. While in some countries the status of women is quite low,
    in Canada men and women are equal and to give women more rights would
    be to give children firearms and dress them up in boy scout uniforms
    so that we could have yet one more enemy where we least suspect. There
    is no need for feminism in a civilized society, it's bad enough that
    Communists have men to fight their wars. And bad enough that literature
    is also a weapon. The same goes for civil rights movement, and racial
    action groups(if men and women of all races can wage a revolution then
    our liveliness and happiness will truly be obliterated).

   - Homosexuality is wrong. Only 1%(contrary to the common statistic of
     10%) of society is homosexual. That makes them a fringe group, and
     their practices are against all the concepts of verility, defined
     sexual identities(ie: man and woman). They are simply social outcasts
     and often sympathizers of Communism. Also there is no such thing as
     a latent homosexual, that is another manipulation. Homosexuals decide
     to live their lifestyles because they are afraid of the opposite sex,
     often face rejection from the opposite sex and want to experiment
     with their sexuality(which means they have no principles and thus are 
     a target for Communist doctrine). They simply cannot be trusted.
 
    - Although this one is hard to identify, a majority are artists are
      communists or communist sympathizers. Particularily watch out
      for art that is obscene, inflammatory or designed as a some sort
      of cunning "social statement". The artistic community has helped
      elevate the seriousness of a Communist threat.

 
==============================================================================
 
  One last important thing, if you are going to vote in the next election
  then it would be most helpful to our society if you voted Reform. While
  their policies are very weak in many places, and their ideas about social
  services and immigration are perhaps a little too left wing they are
  generally the best party in Canada. Perhaps in the future there will
  be a stronger and much inspirational party but for now we have to settle 
  for what there is.

                                [fifteen/ssu#0]

                             [Jack the Lad/ssu#5]


******************************************************************************
The following is a racial purity test.  This is put out by W.A.N. (White Aryan
Nations), C.I.A. (Christian Identity Aryans) and N.W.F. (New White Front).
******************************************************************************
 
 
  This file was disseminated originally to serve the purpose of self-policing.
 On the first draft of the W.A.N. application form, it was unclear to some
 members how involved/dedicated they had to be to the "cause" to gain
 entrance into our organization. We discovered, after a few detailed 
 background checks and some disappointing results we had decided to draw
 up the official 'Whiteman's Guide to Clean Living'; which is now the basis
 for most of the major white separatism groups in North America. The "WGCL"
 was a list of questions varying from the mild and innocent questions which
 only probe the current lifestyle of the applicant to the more important
 questions which help people live their lives day-to-day. Background and
 the personal histories of each potential W.A.N. member is very important 
 to us because it is indicative of how involved and truly contributionary
 they will be to our movement.

  We have adapted the original WGCL into a text to follow the spirit of
 the somewhat legendary PurityTest, for interest and entertainment.
 All of the aforementioned groups are no longer in existance, and this
 file is not to be considered hate literature or of racist content
 because it is only a comparison to the reputable and widely distributed
 PurityTest. It is not our intention to offend, and if the initial
 affect of the distribution of this file is negative we deny all
 responsibility.

  Also it is important that we stress that this file is based entirely
 on a political bias and by no means it is a complete representation
 of the White Race, or any race, sect, religion or culture. It is
 also not based on the current scientific standard of genetics, purity,
 and heritage. Lastly and most importantly, it is not an attempt to
 express our politics or beliefs. We would appreciate it most if you
 see this as being completely non-dogmatic and especially typical
 of what all white separatist organizations believe.
==============================================================================

  And now the follow is the revised version of the RacialPurityTest or 
 RPT for short. This was composed some years ago, after the original 
 version of the test in the application won major awards and critical 
 acclaim in such magazines as Thunderbolt 2000, Cross Burners Digest and 
 the Whiteman's Guide to Survival in a Desolate America.  So sit back
 and read the tame version of the RPT.

          SCORING SYSTEM:
 
         The RPT was designed to be rated on a percentile basis.
        A point is scored for each question that is answered with
        a "Yes", no point is scored for an answer of "No" on any
        question.
        To reach a percentage result, simply multiply your total
        score by Two. !50*2=100! 
        
        Example: A score of 26 out of 50 will warrant a total
                 percentage of 52 out of 100. This means you
                 have answered more than half of the questions
                 correctly.

          RATINGS:  
                      01-30% -- Scored Very Poorly.
                      31-55% -- Average.
                      56-85% -- Politically and Racially Fit.
                      86-100% -- Motivated and Equipped for a Seperate White
                                 Nation.

  The precipitation of unkempt masses had slowed due to the darkening of the
sky, and the neccesity of the market-goers' loved ones. The shops were
closing, yet most secretly re-opening to service the greed of Tokyo's night
life. A familiar peace, that of exhaustion, spread through the neon city like
a great drought washed clean by a short rain. This moment was the one pure
thing to come from the accelerated avarice of several previous generations. A
scenery of the everyday, observed by none, with a deliberate exception.
Watanabe Toru took solace in the temporary silence of the city, while others
prepared.

  Iyetsu Kensuke, a simple man in a world of jesters, was growing impatient
as he stood in a paper room. This distraction, this informality, was grating
the nerves of this precocious fanatic. An oath he took, the prelude to his
iniation was about to be consummated. Kensuke was but a pawn in the eyes of
the esteemed leaders who forced him to wait, but he was determined to end his
interview with great efficiency. "Mister Iyetsu.." a voice cornered into the
room from the sliding door. He forced himself into the other room, dancing on
the edge of frustration. This room identical to the previous in every detail,
except for the faces which decorated it. The one that called was a mere
hireling, stuck between a position of authority and that of abject
complacency. Unnoticed, the door was closed by the studious hands of the
clonelike servant. The man in the room climbed to meet Kensuke in a short
bow. "There will be no introductions, Mister Iyetsu, as we will not meet
again" said the ancient man of the room. Kensuke gave an obligatory nod, not
questioning the statement. He barely managed not to cringe upon his first
full look at this man, upon those shrivelled folds and layers of his aged
face. The decrepit features of the man moved with a ragged grace that seemed
to control the contours of his outdated business suit. This man was a rotted
skeleton at best, a shell waiting for the soul to finally abandon it and in
this he was no different than any esteemed man in Tokyo. "Have you decided on
my task of initiation?" were Kensuke's first words, practiced to ring with an
unmeasured amount of enthusiasm. At this the great old man folded his loose
hands and seemed to grasp at an answer. "From this very day, you will be cut
from the world, never to look back at solid ground". "I understand" said
Kensuke, wishing for the old man to hurry. "Your life will be forfeit to
build our cause, and your death meaningful only to the advancement of it"
said the Old man with delay. "I offer my life willingly, and will accept
death without any reservation" replied Kensuke in military fashion. "Then I
can only hope that your dedication will fertilize our mission of anachronism,
but dedication is something which must be tested before relied upon.." the Old
man uttered with insight. "It is in your hands, I will submit to any test of
your design" said Kensuke. The Old man communicatively nodded, and the servant
snuck out the door to obtain a contract and some documents.

  Toru was interrupted by a wave of traffic, his peace has perished for
another day. He adjusted the rose on his tuxedo and curiously eyed his gold
watch. Pacing around the water fountain at which he waited, he made sure that
no one was watching, that no one would shame him for what he was about to
take part in. Inspecting his watch again, he found the time to drift into
thought. This was his last night in Tokyo, his rise in the zaibatsu had
warranted a transfer to Thailand to head up the advertising division. The
accomplishments so far almost totally a result of upbringing and family
honor, he needed a chance to earn freedom from his fathers glory. Watanabe
Fukami had won leadership of the zaibatsu by defending it from an almost
certain takeover, a white collar warrior who had predetermined the future's of
his children and their children by his success. Toru was ashamed of the
position he was defaulted into by birth, a life with no variation and void of
it's own ambitions. He was to inherit a throne and legacy, but not of his own
ability. Thailand allowed him to finally get away from the source, not
entitling him to freedom but at least lessening the aggravation. The night
before he shipped out, he was to visit his lover.

  Kensuke, on edge from his interview, managed marginally to catch the bullet
train that would take him to his destination. He cleaned himself from the
reflection in the glass of the train window, straightening his tie, brushing
off his coat and combing the hair that which just fell short of complimenting
his square face. The train travelled to the proper stop, and with effort
Kensuke made it out the doors before they closed. He walked up and through the
train terminal and out into the pristine streets. He tried his best to
conpensate for the delay faced earlier and his pace quickened to a slow jog.
The water fountain came into sight as Kensuke returned to a walk, and
immediately he spotted his friend Toru. Kensuke and Toru exchanged knowing
glances and they walked business-like to Kensuke's apartment. Arrangements had
been made that Kensuke would be followed, and a black sedan rode close to the
curb observing the two lovers from a distance.

  The washroom of the apartment was immaculately clean, and Iyetsu Kensuke
stood shaving in front of a steamed mirror, convulsively. A few nicks were
bandaged and Kensuke squated on the floor in his housecoat, hugging his legs
as he shook from fear. After a slight moment of introspection he wiped the
indecision from his face and a cold intensity filled its place. He tip-toed
expertly into the bedroom and reached into his closet, seeing that Toru was
asleep. The bed was a spent mass of passion, intricately build, and ruined
only by the body that slept there. Kensuke removed an heirloom sword from the
top shelf of the closet and moved steadily towards the bed. Toru sleepily
sighed and rolled to face the other side of the room as Kensuke's heart shrunk
with terror. Kensuke took a traditional Samurai stance and progressively drew
the decoratively deadly Katana. Toru began snoring in a content bliss,
unaware of the impending doom that lurked above him. Precision conquered as an
earth-shattered Kiai bellowed through the room and the Katana sealed itself in
the bed, slowed only by flesh, tendon and brainstem. What lay there now was a
slender japanese body, gushing rivers of blood, denied of even a twitch or a
moment to look death in the eye. The head shot into the headboard making a
deep sound, and Kensuke shrieked a spray of crimson afterlife soiled his
white terri-cloth housecoat. He tore the sword from the bed of sin, and held
it in the air bragging of the life it had just reaped. To keep himself from a
breakdown, Kensuke screamed another endless Kiai and shook his tightly
locked arms with blood-fury. The water from bath dripped down mixing with
the sweat of his tension and the light above burned down like a spotlight.
Kensuke sheathed the ceremonial weapon, exempt from the shock that was about
to hit and aggressively packed a week's clothing into a suitcase. He ran
unconsciously towards the street below, tripping on the stairs and scraping
the sheathe of the blade which he carried in the hand opposite to the
suitcase.

  Parked suspiciously outside was the black sedan, which waited the whole
night for a single purpose. Kensuke almost hit the car when he tumbled
through the door in a blood soaked housecoat and the car door opened briefly
to allow him inside. It set in finally, and Kensuke gripped for the reality
of the night. "Your lover is dead?" said the driver of the man, an offensive
looking japanese with bulging muscles and a designer business suit. "H-he is
dead" Kensuke said with little strength. The car drove off, approaching
safety from the law that would eventually pursue. Iyetsu Kensuke had passed
the test, that of murdering his corporatist lover. Kensuke had entered the
life he so desired, taking his first step into the darkness and forever
pledging to die for a forgotten cause.



[This story is affectionately dedicated to Mushima Yukio, a patriot and
artist of post-war Japan. His works were a reflection upon the progress and
reparation that Japan had initiated after the bombing of Nagasaki and
Hiroshima. Mishima(in traditional manner, the surname is listed
first as to give respect and clearance to the family over the self) was an
ardent political activist and much of what he wrote was a statement of his
traditionalist views. His life was pure, and ethical, his death the perfect
statement to a life of many achievements. In his creative period, ages 20 to
45, Mishima had written over 200 works which included plays, novels, stories
and poems. His was a testament to the perfection of mind and body, as he
studied Kendo and Karate, achieving a high rank in both as well as being a
body-builder and accomplished actor. In every sense of the word, he was a true
samurai, despite his own self-doubts. It was on November 25th of 1970 that
has life ended, not as a violent protest but rather as a meditative ritual of
completion. This was the day he finished the Sea of Fertility series, the
thing he claimed was the sum of his life. This story was written on this same
day, of 1993. The main character(Iyetsu Kensuke), in different circumstances
could have been a younger Yukio. While I am not an advocator of his politics,
nor his way of life, I am amazed and inspired by the accomplishments of his
life. I have seen no better example of honor, or sensitivity and it is this
reason that he has been compared to the likes of Earnest Hemingway and Fyodor
Dostoyevsky. It is unfortunate that this artist has only recieved acclaim in
small circles. He chose to end his own life, yet others have only lived
through him vicariously. I wrote this for others who could relate to his
messages, in hope that it will be a reminder for them to attempt to achieve
all of their dreams and not to settle for a life of misery and monotony.]

                       'Don't Confuse Me With The Facts'
                       =================================

	Most of us have had the experience, either as parents or youngsters, of
trying to discover the "hidden picture" within another picture in a children's
magazine. Usually you are shown a landscape with trees, bushes, flowers and
other bits of nature. The caption reads something like this: "Concealed
somehwere in this picture is a donkey pulling a cart with a boy in it. Can you
find them?" Try as you might, usually you could not find the hidden picture
until you turned to a page farther back in the magazine which would reveal how
cleverly the artist had hidden it from us. If we study the landscape we realize
that the whole picture was painted in such a way as to conceal the real picture
within and once we see the "real picture," it stands out like the proverbial
painful digit.
	It's obvious that a picture like this is intentionally painted to deceive
the onlooker. What kind of deception such a picture would weave is really kind
of ambigious, you can never really guess the purpose asides from the fact that
it initially fools the viewer. There are of course things in the real world
which are meant to fool and deceive the unsuspecting person.

                         'The Harvestmen Manipulators'
                         =============================

	We all see things that are wrong with the world, and often when we sit
down and really discuss the issues at hand, we find some sort of point of
agreeance. It's not hard to really communicate a problem and be understood
because things like politics and economic issues are really quite petty.
Admittedly, we cant always find a resolution that everyone can agree with but
the acceptance is certainly a step in this direction. The problem I am about to
discuss traverses the world over, from the temperate climates of North America
to the tropics of South America, Hawaii and Asia as well as various spots in
many other significant parts of the world. It's a problem in physical size that
can easily be ignored but in physical number, it will overwhelm even the most
dedicated man. It dwells in the creaks and cracks in a crumbling urban society,
it preys at night on the small and weak. It has such a capacity for savagery,
that it can blindly crush its unsuspecting victim without a whim or a
hesistation. It is such a dispicable threat, that for each time you succeed over
it, it grows bigger and more numerous. The common name of this threat is the
Harvestmen and the impact on society and the power they have over us is
remarkable.

                                  PART THREE

                    'Bankrolling The Harvestmen Revolution'
                    =======================================

	Everyone who reads this bankrolls the Harvestmen Revolution in some way or
another. They may not know how they are doing it or even that they are
responsible for assisting this truly insidious cause. It measures down to even
the smallest or non-cheallant activities from digging a hole, or growing a
flower to even moving furniture or tending a vegetable garden. For the
Harvestmen are truly survivalists and one day they may take the habits of the
typical predator while the next, a scavenger. They are truly adaptive these
creatures and can evolve to torment even the most cunning person. As they
stalk or hide, they prepare and plan to achieve their ultimate victory over
mankind. Yes, everytime you plant a seed or trim a rose bush, they will be
watching -- waiting. Their cause depends on your apathy and ignorance towards
them and the revolution grows at an alarming rate as they reproduce. You may as
well be lending a hand to their cause like you wanted it to happen all along,
like you felt better as a slave to them.

                                   PART FOUR

                       'Establishing The Establishment'
                       ================================

	The Harvestmen (sub-class Opiolines)
	
	"Like the mites and ticks, the Harvestmen have the head, thorax and
	 abdomen fused into a single structure, but that is as far as the
	 similarity goes, for the latter are free-living predators upon other
	 arthropods. They often, but not always, have legs which can be up to 30 
	 times the lenght of the body. (Mites and ticks have very short legs.) Body 
	 size of most Harvestmen lies in range 0.25-0.5 in (6-12 mm).
	 They are the group most likely to be confused with spiders, but they may
	 be distinguised from the latter by the fused cephalothorax and abdomen 
	 show clear segmentation, a characteristic found only in the rarely seen, 
	 primitive liphistiid spiders.
	 Harvestmen are omnivorious in nature, living on small arthopods, dead or
	 alive, as well as fungus and plant material. Digestion is internal and 
	 some solid food is taken in, something that is uncharacteristic of 
	 arachnids. The male possesses a penis with which he introduces sperm into 
	 the female's reproductive opening, and she then lays her eggs in cracks 
	 and crevices around her with the assistance of her ovipositor. They have 
	 worldwide distribution, though those from the tropics tend to be 
	 shorter-legged than temperate species."

	 (an excerpt from 'Spiders an Illustrated Guide' by Rod Preston-Mafham and
	  published by New Burlington Books)

	First off, lets get one thing straight. Harvestmen are NOT Daddylong Legs.
Daddylong Legs are Crane Flies, and Crane Flies can be easily identified as
giant mosquitoes which are attracted to light colours and occasionally wander 
into your home. It is quite apparent that the size of the Harvestmen's threat 
is so tremendous and so incredible, that it must be stopped in it's tracks. They
carry germs, they trespass on your property and occasionally attack you. I have
had many personal confrontations with these hell-spawn insects, at the cost of
life and limb. I am so overwhelmed with hatred and despair at the same time
that I an unable to truly have the upperhand. I kill and I kill and I kill and
I kill and I kill, sometimes I light them on fire, and other times I use the
more conventional method of just stomping out the little creatures with a stick
or shoe. Their nature is truly evil. Not only are they sickly looking, but they
eat all the smaller innocent insects. They are cunning and although fragile,
they are not afraid to fight for their cause. They cannot carry a rifle, oh but
they are life threatening indeed. 
	The male Harvestmen is a dark brown in colour. Its front teeth are smaller 
than the females, which are long and deadly, but should not go unnoticed. If it
attaches itself to your skin, you will have a deadly enemy to deal with. If you
are having hand to hand combat with this vicious beast, be prepared to be
sprayed by its deady odorous substance. Since I have had many combat trials
with these insipid insectoid invaders, I know that the spray can be most
difficult to remove. I have scrubbed endlessly with soap and water but with no
prevail. 
	The female Harvestmen is a reddish colour. Unlike the male Harvestmen, the
front teeth of a female Harvestmen are extrememly long and vicious. If this
attacks you and manages to get onto your skin the pain will be excruciating. It
will likely spray you with its toxin and you will smell and have two small
teeth marks on your skin as it will attempt to eat you alive. 
	If you are confronted with more than one, it is very wise to take
precautions. You can either walk away like a coward, or you can stand up and
fight. The best way to fight more than one Harvestmen is to use a equal 
concentration of Butane and WD-40 and pour it around the areas that the 
Harvestmen inhabit. The next step is to light it, now I wouldn't suggest a
match or an ordinary lighter because you wouldn't want to get too close, (not
because you might burn yourself, but because the Harvestmen might jump up and
attempt to kill you) the most effective weapon is a barbeque lighter because of
the length.

                             'You Are The Answer'
                             ====================

	There would be no point in writing this article unless I were to tell you
that the situation is not hopeless but you must understand that we, the humans,
are outnumbered. This is a battle not to be fought by a few men, but something
to be embraced by all men regardless of class, colour or creed. We cannot sit 
down any longer if we plan to triumph over the evil that infests our walls,
basements and flower gardens. Its not a struggle of personal distaste or a
struggle for political power, it is for the safety and sanctity of all mankind.
With dedication, courage, honour and strength we can overcome the Harvestmen.

The quotes that probably don't apply(but watch as we try):
 
[fifteen/ssu#0] :

"They thought that consummated love would quench desires,
 and love from afar extinguished ecstasy. We tried both
 cures, yet have not found health. 
 Perchance it is better that your home be close, not far!"
  -Ancient Sufi Wisdom
 
"I don't wanna be a leader, I don't wanna be led. I just want to go to bed."
  -Cringer, "Two Friends"
 
"Therefore, desiring to rule over the people,
 One must in one's words humble oneself before them;
 And desiring to lead the people,
 One must in one's person, follow behind them."
  -Lao Tzu, from the Tao Te Ching
 
"Think about it sometimes,
 Do we need the media?
 I don't need it anymore.
 My body is so alive,
 I can feel everything.
 So I don't need anything else."
  -Shonen Knife, "Watchin' Girl"
 
"Never let your heart open with the 
 spring flowers:
 One inch of love is an inch of ashes."
