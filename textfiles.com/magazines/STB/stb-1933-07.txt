SHORT TALK BULLETIN - Vol.XI  July, 1933   No.7

OUR MASONIC PRESIDENTS

by: Unknown

William L. Boyden, P.M., Librarian of the Supreme Council, A.A.S.R., 
S.J., a Masonic historian of tireless energy and scholarly ability, 
was author of that classic of the Craft, “Masonic Presidents, Vice 
Presidents, and signers of the Declaration of Independence” on which 
this Bulletin has drawn heavily.
Fifteen Presidents were members of the Fraternity:  
Buchanan, Ford, Garfield, Harding, Jackson, Andrew Johnson, Lyndon B. 
Johnson (A.E. only), McKinley, Monroe, Polk, Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Truman, and Washington.  Jefferson and 
Madison have often been claimed as Masons, but there is no acceptable 
evidence to prove that either was ever a Mason.
GEORGE WASHINGTON

George Washington, 1st President (1789-1797), has a Masonic history 
so rich a Short Talk Bulletin (Vol.10, No.2, February 1932) was 
necessary for a bare outline.  Washington was initiated, passed and 
raised in “The Lodge at Fredricksburg, Va.,” (now No.4 on the 
Virginia Register) on November 4, 1752, March 3, and August 4, 1753.  
He was made an honorary member of Alexandria Lodge No.39, June 24, 
1784.  When his Lodge gave up its Charter under the Provincial Grand 
Lodge of Pennsylvania to accept one from the Grand Lodge of Virginia 
and become No.22, April 28, 1788, Washington was named as Charter 
Worshipful Master, and was re-elected Master December 20, 1788.
He was made and Honorary Member of Holland Lodge No. 8, New York, 
1789.
His Masonic activities and visits were many; his letters to and about 
Lodges and Masons fills a volume.  He was the only President ever to 
be Master of his Lodge during his incumbency.
The cornerstone of the United States Capital was laid by Washington, 
with Masonic ceremonies, on September 18, 1793, at the request of 
Maryland’s Grand Master pro tem.
He died December 14, 1799, and was buried with full Masonic honors by 
Alexandria Lodge No.22, on December 18th.  The Lodge later changed 
its name to Alexandria Washington Lodge No.22.	
To his memory and fame the Masons of the United States are erecting 
the mightiest stone monument ever raised to honor any man.  Built 
without metal, to endure a long as granite shall last; this memorial 
stands on Shooter’s Hill, just outside the city of Alexandria, Va.
JAMES MONROE

James Monroe, 5th President (1817-1824), was born in Westmoreland 
County, Virginia April 28, 1752.
The original records of Williamsburg Lodge No.6, Williamsburg, Va., 
show (November 6,1775) that he was “recommended as a fit person to be 
admitted a member of this lodge and the motion recorded.  On November 
9, 1775, he was “preferred, received and balloted for; passed and 
accepted and entered an apprentice.:  The curious reader will note 
that he was not quite seventeen years and six months old at this 
time!
His dues were paid through October 1780, but no record shows as to 
when he was raised.  Tradition states that he received the Master’s 
Degree in a Military Lodge during the revolution, and also credits 
him membership in Kilwinning Cross Lodge No.2, Port Royal, Va.
Little is known of his Masonic life.  He visited Cumberland Lodge 
No.8, at a meeting especially called to receive him in Nashville, 
Tennessee, June 8, 1819.  He died in New York, July 4, 1831.



ANDREW JACKSON

Andrew Jackson, 7th President (1829-1836), born at Waxhaw Settlement, 
N.C., March 15, 1767, was unquestionably a Mason, but when and where 
he was raised is not certain.
At the first meeting of Tennessee Lodge No.2 (originally No.41, N.C.) 
March 24, 1800, in Love’s Tavern, Knoxville, Tennessee, Jackson was 
present as a member of Harmony Lodge No.1, Nashville, Tennessee 
(originally No. 29, N.C.).
Past Grand Master Comstock of Tennessee, noted historian, believes 
Jackson was made a Mason in Harmony Lodge No.1.
Federal Lodge No.1, Washington , D.C., elected him an Honorary Member 
January 4, 1839; Jackson Lodge No.1, Tallahassee, Florida, Elected 
him an Honorary Member sat some unknown date; the Grand Lodge of 
Florida elected him an Honorary Member January 15, 1833.
His chief claim to Masonic fame is that he is the only Grand Master 
to become President.  He was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge 
of Tennessee and served from October 7, 1822, to October 4, 1823.  In 
the Proceedings of the Grand Lodge (1822) he is credited with being a 
Past Master but no records substantiate the statement.
Past Grand Master Comstock also believes that Jackson was a Royal 
Arch Mason, receiving these degrees, as was the custom in early days, 
under the authority of the Blue Lodge Warrant.  He served the Grand 
Chapter of Tennessee as Deputy General Grand High Priest at its 
institution, April 3, 1826, but no record exists of his affiliation 
with any Chapter.
He acted as Senior Warden at the first meeting of Greenville Lodge 
No.3 (formerly No.43, N.C.), September 5, 1801; contributed thirty-
five dollars in 1818 to the erection of a Masonic Temple in 
Nashville; requested two Lodges to perform funeral services;

of a monument to Washington’s Mother at Fredricksburg, Va. (May 
6,1833); assisted in the Masonic laying of the cornerstone of Jackson 
City (across the river from Washington, D.C.) January 11, 1836; 
attended the Grand Lodge of Tennessee in 1839, and the same year

installation of officers.  He died at “The Hermitage” near Nashville, 
Tennessee, June 8, 1845.

September 4, 1820.  In October he was he was elected Junior Deacon, 
and Junior Warden December 3, 1821, but there is no record of his 
having been Master.  In 1825 he received the Royal Arch Degree in 
Lafayette Chapter No. 4, Columbia, Tennessee.  June 24, 1840, he 
attended the feast of St. John the Baptist celebrated by Columbia 
Lodge No.8 and Hiram Lodge No.7 at Nashville, and marched with them 
in procession to a church for Divine Services.  May 1,1847, he

At the cornerstone laying of the Baltimore Temple some one suggested 
that a chair be brought to the reviewing platform for him.  Brother 
Johnson refused it, saying: “We all meet on the level.”
He died July 31, 1875, and was buried with full Masonic Honors by 
Greenville Lodge No.119, R.W.G. C. Connor, Deputy Grand Master of

busy political career in Washington which lasted until his retirement 
from the Presidency in January of 1969.

regarded as a Masonic President, since he never achieved the status 
of Master Mason.  Masonic law in Texas declares that “Entered 
Apprentices and Fellowcrafts are Masons,” although denied certain 
rights and privileges, Lyndon B. Johnson was accepted and initiated 
in a Masonic Lodge, and at that time was addressed as “Brother.”
