How to Start A Local COMSEC Chapter

	Are you interested in establishing a COMSEC chapter?  If so, follow
the steps below.  First contact the COMSEC association, PO Box 7069,
Gaithersburg, MD., 20898-7069 for a 'starter kit'.  This kit will contain
all the materials needed to form you local chapter.  The kit includes
membership applications, a chapter application, COMSEC chapter Pro Forma
constitution and bylaws.  All these items must be filled out and
returned.  
	The Pro Forma bylaws will allow you to begin the organization.  Once
you have a board established and functioning, the bylaws may be changed
to fit your groups needs by appropriate vote of officers.  The Pro Forma
bylaws are sufficiently complete enough to keep you honest with the
national COMSEC association.
	Now you need to round up friends or associates with an interest in
communications security.  This is a broad enough field so you should
easily find four others with your same interests.  The national
association may also be able to help by identifying COMSEC members in
your area that might be interested in joining you.  If you have friends
who would be eligible to join the local chapter but are not COMSEC
members all they would have to do is join the national COMSEC
association.  All application forms must be sent in with the filled out
bylaws.
	Plan on a minimum of three months from the time you make up your mind
to make the chapter happen until the chapter has its first meeting.  A
lot will have to be done such as mailing in the applications and locating
members.
	You'll also have to start planning for your first chapter meeting. 
Decide on a meeting agenda, location and date.  Basically, get organized. 
Its important to make each meeting as interesting as possible for the
chapter members.  And meetings can be scheduled as frequently as members
want.
	Your board and initial officers will be found at the first meeting. 
One of the first people you will need is a program chairman- someone to
attract and organize meeting speakers.  You'll need someone with a PC to
keep a mailing list.  All in all, it will take some work but you'll
benefit and help other COMSEC professionals in your area benefit by
associating with one another.COMSEC CHAPTER FORMATION PROCEDURE
