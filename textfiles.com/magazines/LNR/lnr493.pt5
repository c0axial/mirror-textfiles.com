Resources for Women's Rights

NEW YORK -- On Dec 20, 1992, 50 people picketed St. Patrick's
Cathedral during a visit from the Primate of Poland, Cardinal
Glemp. The picket was in protest of Poland's proposed very
restrictive abortion law (which has now passed). Although the
protest received only nominal coverage in New York, the story was
top of the news in Poland. The picket was organized by the New
York City chapter of Neither East Nor West (N.E.N.W.).

THE NETWORK OF EAST-WEST WOMEN (N.E.W.W.) aims to
create dialogue across national boundaries about feminism. The
Network also helps Central, Eastern European and former-Soviet
feminists begin their own projects in response to local issues:
employment, gender studies, politics, wife-beating and rape.

Running of the Bulls

For those who are curious about the back room meetings and fiendish
plots of the Love and Rage Network and it's projects, there are two
publications that have it all.  Partake of the two Bulls, the
Disco Bull, produced every 6 to 8 weeks, and bi-weekly Network
Bull. Those who pledge monthly to Love and Rage automatically
receive both Bulls and the paper. Those who don't pledge, but want
to recieve both Bulls, are asked to pay a yearly fee of $20-$50 to
cover costs. Simply check the desired box on the subscription form.
Send thoughts, plots and news of your own to:

Disco Bull:   PO Box 581354, Minneapolis, MN 55458-1354 or
