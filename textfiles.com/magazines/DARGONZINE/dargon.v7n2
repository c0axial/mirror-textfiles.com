1                  Campaign for the Laraka III
                Decision at Gateway Keep - Part 2
                       by John Doucette

 Gateway Keep, Royal Duchy, Baranur
 19 Yule, 1014 B.Y.

      Goren  stared,  for  the  fifth   time  that  afternoon,  at  the
 blood-stained floor  where his  brother had lain.  Tiny shards  of the
 Crystal still gathered in the corners  of the room, and the left overs
 from Ne'on's magical  mixtures, books, and components  remained in the
 shelves. He hadn't taken the time  to clean out the room, and couldn't
 spare  the manpower  on  domestic cleaning  -  with Beinison  warriors
 surrounding the keep, Gateway had needs more pressing than aesthetics.
      "Lord Keeper," spoke the man at the door. Goren turned to look at
 him. Lord Morion had traveled hundreds  of miles with thousands of men
 to defend  the Laraka's basin, only  to be overwhelmed by  the size of
 the attacking force. No one had planned on a military front forming on
 the western coast  of Baranur. The driving force had  initiated in the
 north  east,  and the  south;  Baranur  had  been unprepared  for  the
 campaign  Beinison had  designed  on the  Laraka.  Thus, Beinison  now
 occupied  the Laraka  from its  basin  at Shark's  Cove, through  Port
 Sevlyn, up to about a quarter of a league west of Gateway.
      "Lord Keeper,"  Morion repeated. There  was a look of  urgency on
 his  face, one  which  Goren could  not understand,  in  light of  the
 situation:  Beinison was  not going  to be  entering Gateway  any time
 soon,  even if  Gateway was  cut  off from  the rest  of Baranur,  and
 Gateway was not in any condition to launch an attack of its own.
      "What is it, Lord Morion?" Goren  answered. "Do the men need more
 food? Water?  We've got enough to  last a few weeks...  maybe less. By
 that  time, perhaps,  Baranur  will  be taken  and  we'll be  pledging
 ourselves to a new liege."
      The Lord  of Pentamorlo  flinched, barely  keeping his  hand from
 flying out  on its own to  strike the boy  who stood in front  of him.
 Fealty to a new liege indeed, he mused. "Lord Keeper, I lost well over
 a thousand men,  two days ago. And there are  over twenty regiments --
 that's twenty thousand men! --  sitting outside our walls. Perhaps you
 don't think so,  my lord," he continued, "but there  are more pressing
 worries than  food and  water, just  this moment. Ten  of them,  to be
 specific." Goren  looked quizzically  at Morion. "Their  siege engines
 have arrived."

      Five menes  later, standing  on the parapets  of the  inner keep,
 Goren could  see the boats docked  half a league down  the river, just
 beyond  the tents  of  the Beinison  officers.  Large contraptions  of
 steel, wood,  and rope were being  hauled off the ships,  and the area
 was being scouted by the enemy for the best positioning of the engines
 of war.
      "They'll move  a few onto  the hill," Goren said,  indicating the
 hill over which the enemy had emerged yesterday morning.
      "Yes. And there, by the road,"  replied Morion. There was a small
 knoll just south of Gateway's main  gate. "They'll stay far enough out
 of reach of  our archers, but those catapults have  a good range. Look
 at  the  sun reflecting  off  the  buckets," Morion  pointed.  "Steel.
 They're equipped to launch fire."
      "Captain of the guard!" Goren yelled. Within moments, the captain
 was standing in front of him. "Make ready with the bucket. If Beinison
 dumps  fire on  us, I  want to  be ready  to quench  it as  quickly as
 possible." When the captain left, he added, "Not that Gateway couldn't
 use a good purge."
      "My Lord Keeper,"  Morion stepped forward and  spoke intently. "I
 understand that as a nobleman you  deserve the respect and honor given
 to you  by the  King's own hand,  but so help  me, if  your depressing
 attitude costs  me one man -  one man! -  I'll throw you right  to the
 enemy and let them deal with you as they please."
      "Goren!"
      Approaching them from a short distance was a middle-aged man with
 well-worn armor. The  armor was simple, but  effective, and interfered
 neither  with  his movement  nor  his  vision.  The  armor of  a  foot
 soldier... or an archer who expected to enter combat. In this case, it
 was Castellan Ridgewater.
      "My  lord, the  scribe needs  an official  recount of  the King's
 decision to place you as Lord Keeper.  I thought you might like a meal
 as well, and instructed her to meet you -"
      "Her?" Goren interrupted.
      "Aye,  boy.  Your brother...  insisted  the  previous scribe  was
 incapable  of service.  The new  one, Lara...  well, she  dresses like
 something other than a scribe, but I suppose she does her job." Almost
 as an afterthought, he added, "Whatever  that may be. She's waiting in
 your father's  hall." The look on  Marcus' face lead Goren  to believe
 the  man was  entering battle:  hard, determined,  and gauging.  Goren
 guessed the war affected everyone differently.
      "I'll eat in the hall, then, Marcus."
      "Lord Winston, if  I may suggest something militarily  - " Morion
 interjected before Goren left.
      "What is it, my lord?"
      "The catapults which  the enemy is assembling. Can  we reach them
 from here?"
      "I don't know. Marcus?"
      Marcus looked  at where the  engines were being moved.  "I'll see
 about it. Perhaps we can scare them away from those points."
      "See to it,  then," Goren added and walked down  the steps toward
 his father's home.
      When Goren was out of earshot, Marcus lowered his gaze and stared
 Morion  in the  face.  "I wouldn't  make trouble  with  the boy,  Lord
 Morion. He's well-liked  in these parts, and the  people here wouldn't
 take  too kindly  to  his being  pushed. Do  you  understand what  I'm
 saying?"
      Morion's  jaw  set,  and  his  eyes  burned  intently.  "Are  you
 threatening  me,  Castellan?  I  have several  hundred  men  occupying
 Gateway Keep. If I weren't putting up with lousy decorum, I'd take the
 blasted place myself and lock you up!"
      Castellan Ridgewater didn't blink a  lash. "Morion, the boy's got
 a lot on his mind. Don't be  bothering him. You may have men here, but
 I've got a full regiment. And we  know how to bother back. Now, if you
 have nothing else to say, I'll be gettin' about those catapults."
      "I have PLENTY left-"
      "I didn't think so." Marcus interrupted, and turned away.
      Morion stood staring  after him, the veins on his  brow coming to
 life. "Haralan," he  whispered to the air, "by Nehru's  pointy nose, I
 didn't want this damn job."

 Gateway Keep, Royal Duchy, Baranur
 20 Yule, 1014

      "Goren,"  Marcus looked  across the  table at  his lord.  The boy
 still didn't eat more than enough  to keep him alive. Marcus' own best
 effort at  distracting him, in  the form of  a scribe named  Lara, had
 failed miserably. She didn't even know  how to write! And Goren became
 less concerned with his surroundings every day. "The south-east wall,"
 he continued. "There's a problem."
      "What  is  it?"  Morion  interjected.  Morion  did  not  normally
 interrupt a question aimed at  someone else. However, in Goren's case,
 he made the exception. Goren was not dedicated to the task at hand. He
 was  not  concerned with  the  welfare  of  the troops  packed  within
 Gateway's walls.  He did not  have the stomach  to order men  to their
 deaths. Morion did not like Goren Winston, the Lord Keeper of Gateway.
 He liked the castellan even less.
      Castellan Ridgewater looked  at Morion and smiled.  Not a genuine
 smile,  but definitely  an  attempt  to be  civil.  "They're going  to
 crumble," he  said. "Mid-day... Maybe  later. The catapults  have been
 pummelling them for a full day, and they are weakening."
      "Blast," Morion muttered. One day of catapults, and the walls are
 already  weakening? What  was this  keep made  of, wood?  "Well, then,
 Castellan Ridgewater," Morion began with  his own attempt at civility.
 "Let's  get some  fortifications built  up  within the  walls, in  the
 south-eastern section of the keep. That way, when the enemy rushes the
 breach, we'll be better defended."
      "Agreed."  The castellan  found  himself saying.  It  was an  odd
 moment  for both  of  them.  They had  grown  accustomed  to being  on
 opposite sides of arguments.
      Morion raised  his eyebrows  in surprise. "Excellent.  Then we'll
 have to block off any access to  the inner keep from atop those walls,
 as well as any-"
      "Now,  don't  go  givin'  me orders,  Morion."  Marcus'  ire  was
 instantly fired. "Goren's  the one in charge, and I'll  take them from
 him."
      "Listen,  Castellan," Morion  suddenly found  himself out  of the
 surprising  agreement  with Marcus,  and  into  the familiar  heat  of
 discussion. "I'm  certain Lord Winston  will agree with me  that these
 precautions need to be taken-"
      "Oh, I'm  certain as well, Pentamorlo,"  Marcus interjected. "But
 let's let him make the order. Advising him would better become you."
      "'Become  me?' If  these walls  were made  out of  something more
 sturdy than aelo hide-"
      "Did you build these walls? No-"
      "My  Lords!" Goren  yelled. His  headache had  not been  eased by
 their argument.  In fact,  Goren thought, his  headaches for  the past
 three days were  primarily due to the  two of them being  in too close
 quarters with each other. The lord  of Pentamorlo and the castellan of
 Gateway stopped, surprised, and looked at Goren.
      "My  lords," he  continued, "make  the plans  for the  defense of
 Gateway.  Morion,  see  to  the construction  of  the  fortifications.
 Marcus, make sure the keep is secure from the expected breach. Most of
 all, I want the two of you to STAY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER."
      Goren got up, looked at the  men, and glanced towards the door to
 the hall. "I'm hungry. I've got a  lot to deal with, right now. We all
 do. But  if I have to  listen to the two  of you argue one  more time,
 I'll tie you together and throw  you to the enemy. If you're bickering
 doesn't drive Beinison away from Gateway, nothing else will. Now, go!"
      As Goren sat  back down, Morion and Marcus stood.  They looked at
 each other, then Goren, and headed towards the door.

      Captain Greerson waited for Marcus by  the door to the main hall.
 While he had no qualms about entering the room and reporting to any of
 the men within,  he did not want  to be the object  of anyone's anger.
 Even Lord Winston, who had been reclusive since his return to Gateway,
 could be  heard yelling  within the hall.  Those doors  were daunting,
 indeed.
      The wooden  doors opened abruptly,  allowing Lord Morion  to exit
 the hallway  quickly and without  pleasure. Morion headed  east toward
 the inner keep walls. Outside, the low thud of siege engines, followed
 by a heavy crashing sound, paid its toll on Gateway's walls.
      "You have  news for me,  Captain?" The castellan was  standing in
 front of Greerson, now. He was in about as good a mood as Morion.
      "Only a lack  of it, Castellan." Greerson looked  away. "Your son
 is still missing."
      "But he  wasn't with the  members of the  Hand when you  fired on
 them?"
      "No, sir." Greerson replied. "None  of them escaped, and your son
 was not among the dead."
      "Then he's  got to  be somewhere.  Check with  the other  boys he
 trained with,  find out who  saw him last...  Maybe one of  them knows
 where he might have gone, or what he's doing."
      "Right  away, sir."  Greerson turned  to go,  but was  stopped by
 Marcus.
      "Wait  a mene,  Captain." Marcus  took a  good look  at the  man.
 Greerson's eyes were  puffy and dark. His skin was  pale, and his face
 was gaunt. "You haven't slept in a while, have you?"
      "No, sir. Not since the day before yesterday."
      "Right. I'll get someone else to  look about Thomas. You get some
 sleep. When those walls come down,  it won't matter where Thomas is...
 we'll need  every able man to  fight off that Beinison  horde. Now get
 some rest."
      As the  captain of  the guard  made his way  to his  barrack, the
 Castellan thought about  his son. Where could he be?  What could he be
 doing? All the old barracks of  the Black Hand had been cleared out...
 Ne'on's own  quarters had  been searched, and  the dungeons  under the
 keep.  Most of  the boy's  belongings  were still  at the  Castellan's
 residence, excepting  a suit of  chain and  a short sword.  But Thomas
 trained with a broad sword, like his father...

      Lieutenant Lianna Fellthorne stood  atop the makeshift wall where
 she and one-hundred  seventy troops under her command  waited. She was
 not  used to  commanding  such a  large  force: Lieutenants  typically
 command only one company at a  time. Her captain's dead body still lay
 in the fields outside of Gateway, where  he had fallen in the rush for
 safety. Six other lieutenants from her regiment lay there as well, not
 lonely among the hundreds of bodies. No one had picked them up. No one
 had buried them.  It wasn't likely that they would  be buried any time
 soon. Certainly, their burial would not be a ceremonial one.
      One more  loud crash fell against  the wall she was  watching. It
 began to creak and  bend. A good hundred feet from  the wall, she knew
 she was safe, but she ordered her men away from the area. "Clear away,
 there...  it's  going  soon."  At  various  points  of  the  defensive
 semi-circle  within  the  wall's  boundaries,  other  lieutenants  and
 captains  were issuing  similar orders.  The wall  would be  breached,
 soon, and the hell would start.
      Suddenly, Lord Morion was beside her. "How are they, Lieutenant?"
      "Sir?" she asked.
      "Your troops. Are they stable?"
      "As can  be, sir. We're  about to  be invaded." Three  dull thuds
 were heard in the distance. "Down, sir!"
      As they  ducked, three large  boulders crashed against  the wall.
 Stones  shattered, metal  creaked,  and the  wall  wavered. When  they
 lifted their heads, they saw the  sight for which both armies had been
 waiting:  the wall  bent in,  bowed, and  crumbled amidst  a cloud  of
 mortar, stone, and dust.
      More thuds. More crashes. Soon, the wall would be so much rubble.
      "Looks like  a storm is coming  our way, my lord."  Lianna had to
 yell to be heard above the din.
      "Not yet," Morion replied. "Maybe not until the morrow."
      "Why do you say that, sir?"
      "They  haven't deployed  their forces,  yet, Lieutenant."  Morion
 checked  the position  of the  sun over  the western  wall. "And  it's
 nearing evening. They don't  want to fight us in the  dark, in our own
 keep. They'll wait 'till morning, when they'll have plenty of light to
 fight by."
      "Then  I'll order  my men  back under  cover," she  reasoned. "No
 sense in letting stray boulders kill off anyone else."
      Morion  nodded  to  her  and  made for  another  section  of  the
 defensive perimeter. "Not like they haven't taken enough toll already,
 Lieutenant," he muttered to himself.

 20 leagues South of Gateway Keep, Royal Duchy, Baranur
 20 Yule, 1014 B.Y.

      "General  Verde," Luthias  Connall  approached  where his  junior
 officer was  standing. Sarah Verde had  been up late into  the evening
 for the last  five days, walking the perimeter and  spot- checking the
 watches. She looked as tired as she felt. She's normally an attractive
 woman, Luthias thought to himself. Now she looks ten years and several
 wars older.
      The  newly-appointed  general turned  to  her  friend and  senior
 officer. "Knight Captain," she greeted  him formally, "it's very late.
 You should be resting."
      "The same can be said of you, General. This isn't the first night
 you've been up this late."
      "Still early for  me, sir. Still used to night  watches and early
 morning drills. Never left time for sleep, back in those days. But you
 didn't have those days, did you?"
      Sarah  struck a  sore  spot  on Luthias,  and  was regretful  the
 instant she saw the  look on his face. He still  didn't believe he was
 deserving of the titles which had been bestowed upon him over the last
 two years. He had risen very  quickly from a possible barony to higher
 status than  he had ever dreamed:  Count, General of the  Cavalry, and
 now Knight Captain of the Northern Marches. He had never even formally
 served in the  Royal Militia, let alone  the Royal Army. But  he was a
 knight,  and   knights  of  exceptional  quality   were  treated  with
 exceptional praise. He  supposed he must have done  something right in
 the last two years.
      "General," he began, but Sarah interrupted him immediately.
      "I'm  sorry, sir.  I  didn't  mean it  that  way.  Just that  you
 wouldn't have those memories."
      "Forget it,  Sarah. What I  was going  to say was...  well, we're
 going into a  major battle tomorrow. I  need you to get  all the sleep
 you can. So far, we've managed  to encounter only two squads of scouts
 from  the  enemy,  and  they  were  easily  defeated.  Beinison  knows
 something's  up,  they  just  don't  know what.  If  they've  got  any
 surprises for us, tomorrow, I need you awake and level headed."
      "I'll be awake, same time as usual, Knight Captain."
      "Don't  get all  formal on  me, Sarah.  The sun's  been down  for
 almost three  bells. We're marching on  third watch to get  to Gateway
 before noon. Get to your tent and get some sleep."
      "Luthias-"
      "Now, General. That's an order."
      As Sarah  almost sulked  back to  her tent,  a smaller  figure in
 foreign armor came  silently up behind Luthias. Reaching  his hand out
 slowly,  the  Bichanese native  tapped  Luthias  lightly on  his  left
 shoulder.
      "What?" Luthias  jumped around,  pulling his  fist back  ready to
 strike. "Oh, it's you, Michiya. How are things with Kirinagi?"
      "The  general wishes  to see  you return  to your  tent, Luthias-
 sama. His men  are already prepared for the morning's  battle, and are
 sleeping to gain strength. General  Kirinagi has much appreciation for
 your skill as a warrior, but all men need rest some time."
      "So, now I'm taking orders from Bichanese generals, is it?"
      "And your friends, Luthias-sama."
      Luthias sighed and stared off into the night. Not a fire had been
 lit, and a breakfast as cold as  the night's dinner awaited he and his
 men. He thought briefly of Sable, and  how on a hot summer's night she
 had burst into  his room, naginata in hand, ready  to defend his life.
 He thought of the past quite frequently, these days. Roisart and their
 father...  Clifton's father,  the old  Duke of  Dargon... He  silently
 prayed to the Stevene that the war would end soon.
      Sighing one last  time, he put his arm around  Michiya and headed
 toward his  tent. "We both  need sleep  for tomorrow, Michiya.  Get to
 your tent  and rest well.  Death waits for no  one. Might as  well get
 plenty of rest before we meet her."

 1 league south of Gateway Keep, Royal Duchy, Baranur
 Sunrise, 21 Yule, 1014

      "Knight Captain!"  General of the  Cavalry Sarah Verde  called to
 her commanding officer. They had been travelling for four bells, since
 third  watch of  the  evening before,  in order  to  reach Gateway  by
 morning without tiring  the horses. Luthias had been  right: they were
 all going to need the rest they had gotten the night before.
      Luthias saw  what Sarah was pointing  out. There was a  breach in
 Gateway's walls,  and the enemy  was already  making its way  into the
 keep. Fighting was still going on,  however. That meant the breach was
 recent. And Beinison wasn't exactly  pouring into Gateway, which meant
 their  was  strong  resistance   within  the  keep.  Fortifications...
 ditches... the light infantry would be the first to attack, saving the
 heavy  infantry  for  when  the  ground was  more  stable,  easier  to
 maneuver.
      "Form ranks, General." Luthias ordered.
      "Already formed, Luthias." Sarah replied.
      Luthias  looked at  his  cavalry. Eight  regiments strong.  Sarah
 would lead the first wave of four thousand. Michiya, Kirinagi's force,
 and Luthias would  lead the last four regiments in  the final wave. As
 he retreated,  Sarah would redirect  her force, and the  process would
 begin again.
      Stevene give  us strength, he  thought. "First wave,"  he called.
 "Deploy!"

      Four thousand horse pounded out  the distance between the hilltop
 south of Gateway Keep and the  breach in its south-eastern wall. A low
 rumbling sounded through the ground  for miles. As the Beinison troops
 slowed  their entrance  to the  keep, the  commanding officers  looked
 suddenly at the wall of cavalry approaching them. Buglers sounded, men
 scrambled, some small resistance was organized.
      When General Verde was within quarter of a league of the Beinison
 force,  she  could see  the  small  patches of  organized  resistance.
 Looking back, the  Luthias' cavalry had already  begun their approach.
 She raised her sword high, kicked her mount, and yelled. "CHAAAARGE!!"

      The light  infantry attacking  Lianna's section of  the perimeter
 were  just beginning  to  break  through the  defenses  when the  rush
 slowed. Several  of her comrades lay  in bloody heaps about  her. More
 Beinison soldiers lay in front  and around her. As another approached,
 she parried  the attack and thrust  low into the man's  groin. He fell
 screaming, if  not dead.  The wetness  on her  face increased,  but it
 wasn't her  blood. It wasn't the  enemy's blood. As she  hacked at the
 enemy around her, she swore. And she cried.
      She was  a fisherman's  daughter. Her  mother sold  the morning's
 catch in  a market at  Port Sevlyn. But that  was before the  war. She
 knew what  had happened  to Port Sevlyn:  the burning,  the slaughter.
 Innocent people  were killed for  no reason. Fishermen  strangled with
 their own  lines. Women raped  repeatedly before being slowly  bled to
 death.
      Another Beinison soldier made for her. Angrily, she lunged at the
 man, knocking his  blade aside. Her helm almost fell  from her head in
 her desperate attack, but she continued.  Her sword found its point in
 the man's neck and he fell, blood sputtering from his throat.
      "Lieutenant," someone  called to  her. Checking  to see  no enemy
 approaching her, she turned briefly.
      There was her sergeant, standing in  a pool of blood. At his feet
 lay an enemy soldier who had gone  around her. And in his stomach, the
 Beinison's sword had found a weak link. "Bury... me... in-"
      She could only  stand there as he  fell to the ground  in his own
 blood. She stopped crying.

      Michiya swung meticulously at the  enemy beside him. His katana's
 sharp  blade slicing  through the  woman's breast  plate, he  used its
 momentum to  come down on  the man below  him. Grasping now  with both
 hands, he lunged at a Beinison soldier who had ridden up beside him.
      Three deaths in three movements,  he thought. Some would see this
 as poetic. Graceful. It is but death making its way through a world so
 full of life. He spurred his horse to catch up with Luthias.
      "Luthias-sama," he called.  Luthias parried a blade  aimed at his
 skull,  and brought  his  mailed  fist into  the  soldier's face.  The
 Benosian fell  from his horse, nose  bleeding, only to be  trampled by
 his own mount. The horse knew better than to stand between two armies.
      Luthias looked over  at Michiya, and the  battle surrounding him.
 Beinison  was  not  having  a  good time  of  it.  While  Baranur  was
 definitely  taking  losses,  Beinison  had  been  unprepared  for  the
 cavalry's  attack.  They  had  been  hoping  to  gain  Gateway  before
 reinforcements could arrive. They were almost successful.
      "Luthias-sama, General Verde is about to make another charge."
      "Right. Find the  bugler, Michiya," Luthias called  over the din.
 Steel rang against  steel everywhere he looked.  Horses bucked, riders
 fell, and blood made the ground  slippery for the infantry they fought
 against. "I'll be damn glad when this day is over."

      Morion cut down  another Beinison. There was a  small squad which
 had  made its  way behind  the eastern  line of  defenses. If  not for
 Luthias' timely arrival, he thought, we'd have been driven out of here
 just past  morning. He looked  up at the mid-  day sun. They  had been
 fighting for five bells.
      Another Beinison was  crawling up the rear of  the defenses, just
 twenty  yards from  Morion. The  soldier wasn't  watching the  lord of
 Pentamorlo, she  had her  sights on the  colors of  Gateway's defense.
 Castellan  Ridgewater had  his back  to  the rear  line, five  archers
 standing with him, firing arrows into the oncoming enemy.
      "Castellan!" Morion  yelled, but  he couldn't  be heard  this far
 away. His voice was sore from shouting orders all morning, and the din
 of battle drowned out what volume he could still muster. He smiled. He
 knew there  was time  before the  Beinison could make  her way  up the
 defenses, and there was another way of gaining Marcus' attention.
      Picking  up  a  small  piece  of  stone,  he  hurled  it  at  the
 castellan's back.  A small  ringing sound  erupted, and  Marcus turned
 around, fuming at the man who had pelted him.
      "We're in the brink of battle, man, and you're picking on me with
 stones?!"
      Morion pointed  at the Beinison  soldier five feet  below Marcus,
 and the Castellan  looked down. The Benosian,  suddenly realizing that
 she  was caught  in the  wrong place  at the  wrong time,  dropped her
 sword.
      "Take your  helmet off, man."  Marcus yelled at the  soldier. The
 frightened woman did so, and  Marcus swore. "Nehru's pointy nose. Just
 like a  woman to  sneak up on  you." Raising his  bow, he  brought the
 wooden  portion of  it  down, hard,  on the  woman's  head. She  fell,
 unconscious, to the ground.

      It was mid-evening  when the fighting slowed,  then stopped. Both
 sides were tired. Hungry. The cavalry's horses would no longer charge,
 and did  little to  support their  riders. Gateway  was in  ruins, the
 north wall having been breached at mid-day.
      Beinison's  forces were  battered,  but now  more organized.  The
 original force  which was to be  deployed at the north  wall never had
 the chance. If not for the commanding officer's decision to divide the
 forces, even more Beinison soldiers might have been caught between the
 defenders in Gateway and the cavalry which arrived from the south.
      Things were, for the moment, at an impasse. When Michiya had seen
 that the siege  engines were still pummelling Gateway,  he commanded a
 squadron  of cavalry  and  destroyed them.  Luthias  had regained  the
 defenses  Morion's  troops had  built  four  days before,  outside  of
 Gateway. Beinison had  retreated out of Gateway's  catapult range, and
 was fortifying  its camp. Luthias knew  he was lucky, that  day. If he
 had arrived  a bell later,  Gateway might have  been taken. If  he had
 been earlier, the Beinison army  would not have already been committed
 to the task.
      "Sir Luthias," a  man -- if such an apparition  could be called a
 man -- approached  him on horseback. Luthias had watched  him from the
 small hill  Luthias had claimed  as his  own. Lord Morion,  covered in
 blood, dirt, and sweat, dismounted.
      "Lord Morion," Luthias returned his greeting. "Welcome to... what
 passes, for the time being, as my pavilion."
      "Thank  you,  Count  Connall,"  Morion  replied.  "Welcome  to...
 whatever you want  to call this situation. The lines  are drawn, so to
 speak."
      "Yes, they are. But I don't think it will be long."
      Sarah  Verde  and Ittosai  Michiya  approached  the two  leaders.
 "Knight Captain. Lord Morion."
      "Lord Morion," Luthias introduced, "I believe you know General of
 the Cavalry Sarah Verde, and Ittosai Michiya."
      "Indeed I do." Morion replied. "General. Michiya."
      "Luthias-sama," Michiya  began. "We -- General  Kirinagi, General
 Verde, and myself -- We are wondering  what the next plan of action is
 to be.  You ordered  us to  dismount and rest  our steeds.  The supply
 train is still not arrived from last night's camp. I fear we will have
 little food for the evening's meal, or feed for the horses."
      "I believe we can take care  of that in Gateway, Michiya," Morion
 offered. "If I can get that damn castellan to listen to me."
      "The castellan? What about the Lord Keeper?"
      "Useless brat, if you ask me. Hasn't been helpful since he killed
 his brother."
      Luthias scowled  at Morion, knowing  both what it meant  to kill,
 and how it felt to lose a brother. Having to kill his own kin would be
 difficult, even for one who had seen death as much as had Luthias.
      "The boy didn't even fight  in the battle," Morion continued. "In
 my  opinion,  Goren Winston  isn't  fit  to  defend a  major  military
 stronghold like Gateway."
      "That's  a pretty  strong  statement, Lord  Morion." Sarah  Verde
 shifted her  scabbard for comfort.  "Perhaps we should all  convene in
 Gateway?"
      "A good idea-- What's that?"
      In the distance, a man on  horseback was riding from the Beinison
 army toward  the hill Luthias occupied.  He carried the white  flag of
 truce, and rode  weaponless. A captain called to  Luthias, and Luthias
 waved him on. When the soldier was within twenty yards, he dismounted.
      "Who is  the commanding  officer?" he requested.  He had  a thick
 Beinison accent, but spoke Baranurian quite well.
      Luthias stepped forward. "I speak for him."
      The  Beinison looked  at  Luthias and  recognized the  Baranurian
 insignia's of rank, as well as  the knight's chain around his neck. "I
 speak for General Vasquez, of the Beinison army. We claim the right to
 gather  our  dead  from  the  field  of  battle  before  the  conflict
 continues. It is late in the day, and much blood has been lost on both
 sides."
      "Tell your  general that  he may  gather his dead  as soon  as we
 gather ours." Luthias replied. "It is  our land, and we would not want
 our dead to be dishonored upon it."
      "The general will accept," the  herald responded. "When you leave
 the field, we shall enter it and remove our dead."
      The herald moved to his steed and mounted. He turned his horse in
 a tight circle and sped down the hill to his own encampment.
      Luthias looked at Sarah. "Tell the healers -- Damn! Tell everyone
 to gather  the Baranurian  dead. Stevene willing,  it won't  take much
 time. I'd like to be done with this by nightfall."

 Gateway Keep, Royal Duchy, Baranur
 22 Yule, 1014

      "Goren!"  Castellan Ridgewater  called down  to the  grounds from
 atop the sturdiest of Gateway's remaining walls. "I think you'd better
 see this."
      Goren made his  way up the courtyard stairs in  the early morning
 light. Morion  had gone  to Luthias' camp  the evening  before without
 telling him, leaving some pompous captain in charge of his men. Marcus
 was cursing  up a storm all  evening because there were  Benosians all
 over the field but Morion had sent word not to fire at them. They were
 gathering their dead.
      Marcus had fired  one arrow, though. A man was  running from body
 to body in  the night, bending over each one  momentarily, and rushing
 to the  next. Marcus' keen  eyesight had picked  him out, and  the man
 slumped over  with an arrow in  the back. Pilfering from  the dead was
 the least honorable thing Marcus could imagine.
      When Goren got to the top of the wall, he looked across the empty
 field. "What's wrong?"
      "What's wrong? Have ye lost your eyesight, boy?"
      Goren  just stared  blankly at  the field.  Other than  the usual
 signs of any bloody aftermath, he could see nothing.
      "Don't you see the enemy, Goren?"
      Goren did not.
      "Exactly it, boy. They're gone."
      Goren looked again  at the field. He looked up  the hill to where
 the Beinisons had  retreated the previous evening. He  looked to where
 Luthias had made camp the previous evening, as well. Nothing.
      "Lord Morion!" Goren called, but he  did not need to yell. Morion
 appeared behind him.
      "Lord Morion, what is the meaning of this?" Goren demanded.
      "Well, Lord Keeper, the Beinison army isn't there. Vasquez packed
 up in the middle  of the night, just after second  watch, and left. He
 was only waiting to gather his dead."
      "And Count Connall?"
      "The Knight Captain, as I found he is now ranked, went after him.
 He's going to chase  Vasquez all the way back to  Port Sevlyn and make
 sure he stays there. He can't exactly assault seventeen regiments with
 his cavalry, but he'll scare them enough to make sure they run."
      Goren sighed.  He looked at Marcus  and at Morion. "What  was the
 outcome? We won, but at what cost?"
      "The Knight  Captain lost  one thousand  cavalry and  two hundred
 fifty horse. About." Morion said.
      "Five hundred of Gateway's  garrison died in yesterday's battle,"
 Marcus added.
      "And Eighteen  hundred of  my own men  died, since  Beinison came
 over the hill five days ago." Morion finished.
      Goren was dumbfounded. "That's..."
      "Over three thousand dead," Marcus finished for him.
      "And that's  not counting the  wounded." Morion stated.  "But the
 Beinison  losses  were  greater.  Between  the  start  of  battle  and
 yesterday evening, they lost over seven regiments. Over seven thousand
 men."
      "But they still outnumbered us... what... almost two to one?"
      "Goren, we've  got cavalry. We've  got archers. We've  got what's
 left of  Gateway's walls. We even  have catapults left on  a couple of
 them. All  they had  left was  infantry. We're in  no shape  to attack
 them, and they don't dare attack us."
      "Best  thing they  could do,  Lord Keeper,"  Morion finished  for
 Marcus. "Is get out  of here before we were rested  enough to launch a
 full attack."
      "And they did." Goren looked out  at the field. He saw the blood.
 The  mounds of  dirt piled  up where  heroes had  defended themselves.
 Holes  in  the  walls  where Beinison  had  broken  through  Gateway's
 defenses. A few bloody swords and  shields, maybe a mace, littered the
 ground. "Ten thousand lives ended here."
      "War isn't  pretty, Winston." Morion  said. "And there's  no such
 thing as heroes."

1                       The Evening After...
                           by Bill Erdley
                  (b.c.k.a <berdley@BUCKNELL.EDU>)

      Three times today I should have died.
      I owe my  life to three different men. Well,  actually two, since
 the third is dead.
      Tired. I'm tired and I want to sleep. I can't.
      There's no  real memory of the  battle. There are pictures  in my
 head, but they all run together like the blood in the rain.
      I killed my first opponent today.
      He  screamed as  he fell  to the  ground. There  he sobbed  once,
 gasped, and died.
      There is no  honor in killing. There is no  honor in dying. Honor
 exists for its own sake.
      I try to  roll over, but my  body refuses. I got  my first wounds
 today. Bruises on my legs and  sides, a nasty gash across my shoulder,
 and a lump on my head.
      I hurt.
      Three times today I should have died.
      Apart from those  who stood, and fell, before me,  I remember Sir
 Luthias  and Michiya.  Like two  demonic  reapers in  the devil's  own
 field, they  swung and chopped and  cut, harvesting a macabre  crop of
 souls to be sent back to wherever those souls came from.
      Why can't I fall asleep?
      Sir  Luthias  saved  me  by  knocking  me  to  the  ground  while
 simultaneously parrying  the swing that  would have separated  my head
 from my shoulders.  The mud was already salty with  blood. It splashed
 into my face as I fell, and when I cleared it from my eyes and spat it
 from my mouth, my assailant was dead on the ground and Sir Luthias was
 already on to his next combat.
      My shoulder  hurts; the deep,  throbbing pain of a  joint begging
 for rest.
      I fought beside Sir Luthias.
      They didn't  seem to know how  to counter one of  the tricks that
 Sir Luthias  taught me.  Again and  again I  used it.  Swing, counter,
 swing, twist,  thrust; and my sword  would bite a shoulder  or a neck.
 Once, my sword caught as a man went down. As I reached for it, another
 man  stepped in  and swung.  I dodged,  but I  was open  for his  next
 strike. Michiya, without changing his  rhythm, caught my opponent with
 a backhand slash to the head,  then continued to fight his own battle.
 The dead man almost landed on me as he fell...
      Never have  I heard  so much  pain. Screaming.  Moaning. Sobbing.
 There was  a constant sound.  It was the sound  of the dying.  I never
 knew death had a voice.
      During  a   lull,  Sir   Luthias  complimented  my   ability  and
 "tenacity", a word which  he had to explain. I didn't  tell him that I
 was afraid; that I fought for my life. He already knew.
      I just want to sleep. I try to roll over again.
      It is the eyes, most of all, that  I see when I close my own. The
 sightless, fixed stare of the dead.  My mistake was to look into those
 eyes. Just once. I saw death's face.
      There is no honor in killing.
      I was struck in the shoulder by  a man that I didn't see. I fell,
 my sword  falling from my  fingers as my arm  screamed out in  pain. I
 tried to crawl back  from the fighting, but he came  at me, a terrible
 smile spreading  across his face.  A man from  the company that  I had
 traveled with  stepped between us and  swung. I rose from  the mud and
 tried  once again  take  up my  sword.  My arm  screamed  again, so  I
 switched hands.  The man  who saved  me fell. His  killer moved  on to
 another fight, perhaps forgetting me. I looked at my shoulder, and saw
 the blood pouring out. I turned from the fighting to find a healer.
      My head  throbs to a slower  rhythm now, but it  still throbs. It
 throbs with  every beat of my  heart. It throbs because  I still live.
 For that, I am grateful. Still, I wish I could sleep.
      There is no honor in dying.
      I  tripped over  a  body  while running  back  to  the line.  The
 Beinison man lived, but his pain...
      "Kill me." he cried. "Please, I beg you."
      I shook my head. I showed him the sign for healer, then turned to
 run and find one.
      He cursed me. "I am defeated!"  he cried. "To live with defeat is
 worse than death. I will NOT live in dishonor!"
      I fetched the healers, but he was dead when we returned.
      The eyes.  Those cursed eyes. How  can I sleep when  every time I
 close my eyes I see theirs.
      Honor exists for its own sake.

      The tent flap moved and  Sir Luthias entered, followed by Michiya
 and a man in dirty white robes who looks like a healer. Luthias looked
 at me and asked "How are you doing?"
      *I* *Live* I manage to keep my injured arm quiet.
      He nodded. "You will fight again."
      *Fight* *Yes* *Sleep* *No.*
      Again, he nodded. I think that he understood. The healer moved to
 me and handed me a small bottle. "Drink this."
      I did,  and almost instantly felt  my eyes begin to  close, as if
 they were too heavy to hold open.
      *Question* *I* *Dream.*
      Sir Luthias' voice sounded distant and vaguely sorrowful.
      "I hope not."

1                        Love an Adventure
                             Part One
                       by David/Orny Liscomb
         (b.c.k.a <jjmhome!wonky!ornoth@transfer.stratus.com>)

               "And so it came to pass that during the seventh
          year of the reign of King Brad, the County of
          Egilsay was transferred from house Sall to Count
          Justin Petersson, as dowry in his marriage to Lady
          Amigene of Sall. The dowry also included the lady's
          handmaidens, seventeen sheep, and six barrels of
          cider."

      "Boy,  it  sure is  dusty  in  here!"  thought Dale,  wiping  his
 watering eyes before  turning back to the history his  father had told
 him to  transcribe. Cavendish, his  father and scribe to  Duke Clifton
 Dargon, had  dreams that  his fifteen  year-old son  would one  day be
 accepted into the scribe's guild, but Dale had other ideas.
      He peered  out the  window of his  bedroom, which  overlooked the
 lower half of  the city of Dargon.  Before him lay all  the bustle and
 ruckus  of a  city alive  with the  business of  midsummer. Above  and
 between the roofs of the houses he could even see the slow-moving mast
 of a sailing vessel arriving in the harbor from some faraway land.
      Never in  his life had Dale  been more than a  couple hours' walk
 from  the city,  and he  longed to  explore all  the places  he'd read
 about. That  was probably  the worst  part about  being a  scribe: you
 could read  about all kinds  of far-off  cities and kingdoms,  but you
 never got to go anywhere!
      He often  went down  to the  port to watch  the ships  coming and
 going, but  he rarely talked  to the  crewmen. They were  usually very
 serious, and looked kind of dangerous.  But he did talk with Simon the
 stew merchant.  Everyone knew  Simon --  he would  often spend  a slow
 afternoon telling the children about the adventures he had heard about
 when  he was  a sailor.  But Dale  knew that  he was  Simon's especial
 friend.
      Dale cleaned his quills, grabbed a piece of bread and stepped out
 into the street, heading downhill toward the docks.

      Commercial Street really  wasn't much of a street at  all. It was
 really  just a  big  open area  between the  wharves  where the  ships
 docked, and the warehouses where their cargoes were stored. Low carts,
 drawn  by mule  and  oxen, labored  back and  forth  between the  two:
 slow-moving islands  amidst a  sea of people  all moving  at different
 speeds in different directions.
      Leftwiched   between   the   warehouses  were   bars,   brothels,
 restaurants,    general   stores,    rug   merchants,    provisioners,
 confectioners, furriers,  clothiers, and  metalworkers. And on  a warm
 summer day, in front of  every building, traveling merchants would set
 up  their  wares:  candles,  lamps,  hats,  leather  work,  and  every
 imaginable type of food and  drink. On Commercial Street, the swindler
 hawking  overpriced   glass  jewelry  had  to   compete  with  soapbox
 philosophers;  whores  and  thieves  rubbed elbows  with  priests  and
 children. And although it probably wasn't the safest place in the city
 of Dargon, it certainly was one of the most exciting!
      Just short  of reaching Commercial  Street, Dale ducked  into the
 side entrance of the Harbormaster's  Building. His boots echoed loudly
 on the varnished wooden floors as he made his way through the hallways
 to the doors that faced out onto Commercial Street. The Harbormaster's
 Building was the  only building that faced the wharves  that had steps
 leading up to  it, and Dale liked  to use this perch to  look out over
 the crowd and  see what was going  on. Maybe someday he  would live in
 the second  or third story  of a building that  faced the port,  so he
 could watch all the activity from his own room.
      Dale stared  out over the port.  The unfamiliar ship he  had seen
 arriving earlier  was tied  up at Countryman's  Pier, but  he couldn't
 make out her  name. He scanned the edges of  Commercial Street for his
 friend Simon,  the stew  merchant. It  took a  couple minutes,  but he
 finally saw Simon's monkey, Skeebo. The  monk had climbed up on top of
 the small wooden roof of Simon's cart  to shoo away a seagull that had
 perched there. Dale  left his high ground and plunged  into the sea of
 activity at street  level, heading toward the place where  he had seen
 Simon's cart.

      Dale pushed  through the  crowd and finally  caught sight  of his
 friend, Simon  Salamagundi. The stew  merchant was talking with  a man
 who looked  like a sailor, and  hadn't noticed his young  visitor yet.
 Dale stood  unobtrusively nearby and  listened to the  exchange. Simon
 didn't notice  him, but Skeebo did,  and quietly leaped down  onto his
 shoulder.
      "... not only  lost the bet and  had to wear a  pink scarf around
 town,"  continued the  sailor,  "but he  lost the  rat,  as well!"  He
 doubled over  in uncontrollable mirth,  then slapped Simon's  back and
 bounded off.  Simon shook his head  in appreciation, then saw  Dale as
 the young man turned to him.
      "Who was that?" the boy nodded in the sailor's wake.
      Simon smiled  a little.  "He's a cook  on-a 'Friendly  Lion'. His
 boy's a  headstrong lad. Apparently  he favors losing bets  in foreign
 ports!"
      Dale gestured  toward the  newly-arrived ship, sitting  quiet and
 stately a couple piers down. "Is that the 'Friendly Lion'?"
      "Yessir.  She just  came in  from Westbrook  and Dar  Althol with
 quite a  haul. Books,  news, silver.  Rice, nuts,  barley. And  a bard
 named Kinwood. From Althol. Apparently very popular..."
      Dale wondered about the places. He'd grown up hearing about other
 lands -- Westbrook, Winthrop, Tench,  Magnus -- places that he'd lived
 with all his life, but had never seen for himself.
      "So..." Seeing that Dale's mind  was elsewhere, Simon changed the
 topic  of conversation.  "What have  you  been up  to, this  beautiful
 summer's day?"
      Dale managed a resigned laugh. "Hmph! Dad has me transcribing the
 history of  County Egilsay!  It's so  boring!!! I  wish I  could visit
 these places,  not just read  about them!"  Dale started to  raise his
 voice.  "I'm  tired  of  hearing  other  people  talking  about  their
 adventures -- I  want an adventure of  my own. Dargon is  so boring --
 nothing ever happens here!"
      Simon knocked the young man on  the shoulder. "Come on, I've been
 to plenty of interesting places, and out of all those places, I picked
 Dargon to live in. Do you know why?"
      "Because it's boring and calm and you were tired of adventuring?"
 countered Dale.
      "No! Because out  of all-a the lands I've seen,  Dargon is one of
 the most interesting."
      "If Dargon's  so interesting, when was  the last time you  had an
 adventure?"
      Simon  paused  a second.  "Why,  I  had  an adventure  just  this
 morning. I  was cutting into  a loaf of  bread that Madame  Nilson had
 baked  for me,  and  what should  I  find inside  but  a silver  coin!
 Apparently it  fell outta  her bodice  and got mixed  in when  she was
 kneading the dough! Hah!"
      Dale scowled. "Simon  -- that's not an  adventure! Adventures are
 heroes  saving fair  maidens  or stopping  pirates  or saving  burning
 cities."
      Simon  shook  his  head.  "Ah,  no. Real  people  can  have  real
 adventures,  and they  don't have  to be  as dramatic  as all-a  that.
 There's plenty of adventure right here in Dargon."
      Dale looked down and scuffed his  feet. "Not for me. Being locked
 up at  home copying  scrolls is  about as  exciting as...  as..." Dale
 threw his  hands in the air.  "Shit! I can't even  *think* of anything
 more boring! I wish Dad would let me go sign on as a sailor..."
      "NO!!!" The  sudden emotion in  Simon's voice startled  Dale. His
 friend was usually  the most even-keeled person Dale  knew. Seeing the
 confusion in his  friend's expression, the stewmaker  sighed and shook
 his head.
      "Dale, listen to me, straight? When I was you age I felt the same
 way. My mama  wanted me to be  a artist. She even apprenticed  me to a
 sculptor! I thought  it was the most  boring thing in the  world. So I
 ran away and  tried to join a  trading ship. I talked  to the captain,
 and-a you know what he told me?" Dale cocked his head to indicate that
 he didn't know.  Despite his renown as a storyteller,  Simon had never
 really talked about himself very much.
      "He said 'Boy, I'm not going to  take you on, but here's a bit of
 advice for you. You can go  all around the world looking for adventure
 and never find it,  or you can walk the streets of  your home town and
 find  adventure  around  every  corner.  You  know  why?  Because  all
 adventure  is, is  doing something  that you've  never done  before.'"
 Simon crossed  his arms with  a satisfied  "Hmpf!" as he  mimicked the
 captain. Then he leaned toward his young listener conspiratorially.
      "But I thought  he was full of  wind, so I went  to another ship.
 This time, I  didn't talk to the captain, but  volunteered to help the
 cook. He took me on, and my life of adventure had begun.
      "Or so I thought. It was really  the most boring time of my life.
 When we were at sea, all we did was cook. My legs were bored off! When
 we were in port, all we did  was drink ourselves to sleep. That's when
 I got  to thinking  about the  old captain's  words about  looking for
 adventure." Simon's faraway eyes returned to Dale.
      "And  that's  why I'm  telling  you  now  -- adventure  is  doing
 something you've  never done before.  It doesn't need to  be something
 big. You can  find adventure every day, even in  Dargon. I do! There's
 no need to go running away from home to find it."
      Dale shook his head. "But Dargon's so *boring*!"
      Simon  harumphed. "Well...  isn't  there  anything you've  always
 thought you might want to do, that you never did?"
      Dale thought about it. Sure, lots  of things, but none of them in
 Dargon! "I dunno. I've never had my fortune told, but that's stupid."
      "Why?"
      Dale shrugged. "I dunno. Dad always said it was a waste of money.
 They're fakes."
      Simon smiled in  victory. "Sure they are. But  they're fun fakes.
 What's the difference between paying a bard to play for you and paying
 a fortune teller to read your future?"
      Dale cocked his head again, this time in thought. "I guess you're
 right."
      Simon smiled. "That's it. Dargon  isn't so boring -- there's lots
 of things in this city that you haven't explored! And don't put it off
 -- go see  if the fortune tellers  are busy. Here." Simon  threw a paw
 into his pouch and pulled out a silver coin. "Use it."
      "Oh, okay." Dale smiled, taking the coin. "As long as this didn't
 come from old lady Nilson's bodice..."

      Dale looked across at the  fortune teller's booth. He was feeling
 a little anxious inside, but what  Simon had said did make sense, even
 if he couldn't really see the sense  in using something as stupid as a
 fortune teller as an example. If adventure was nothing more than doing
 something you'd  never done  before, it made  life kind  of different.
 There were lots of things he'd  never done, without knowing really why
 he hadn't. The idea that you could  wake up in the morning and find an
 adventure just  waiting for you  certainly held the promise  of making
 life a little more interesting.
      Again he looked across at the seer's booth. No one had entered or
 left in some time. He glanced up at the sky, as if entreating the gods
 to have mercy, and stepped across the street.
      Dale poked his  head through a curtain and into  the booth to see
 an old man in a monk's-style robe lifting a heavy crate.
      "Excuse me..." he began. "Can I help you with that?"
      The old man  stopped and straightened up. Then he  looked the boy
 over. "Sure, boy.  Bring 'er into the back room."  Dale took the crate
 by rope handles on the sides and heaved.
      "Marabinga's Girdle, old man! What have you got in this crate?"
      The seer let  the oath pass. "A shipment of  books from my mentor
 in Magnus. It just arrived this morning on the Friendly Lion!"
      Dale was reminded  of his father and thought  to himself, "Great.
 Another old man with his nose in a book!"
      The old man  held aside the black curtain that  led into the back
 room. Dale stepped in, and took in as  much of the room as he could in
 the darkness.  There were no  windows, and  the room was  barely large
 enough to contain the table and  the chairs that sat at opposite sides
 of it.  The table  was inlaid with  a wheel with  all kinds  of mystic
 symbols. There was  a small bookcase opposite the  entrance, filled to
 overflowing with  both books and  all manner of mystic  apparatus. The
 room stank  of the dirt  floor and  incense. The walls  were decorated
 with all manner  of symbols and images, only a  small portion of which
 Dale had ever seen before.
      "Just slide  the box under  the table, toward the  bookcase; I'll
 deal with it later,"  the old man instructed with a  vague wave of his
 hand. Then, to  Dale as he rose,  "Now, presumably you came  to me for
 something?"
      Dale looked at  the floor. "I'd like to have  my fortune read, or
 whatever... Whatever a silver bit will get me."
      The seer  seemed satisfied and  accepted the coin.  "Well, things
 have been  pretty quiet today. I  could read your cards,  that's quick
 and easy. Or we  could do a sand casting, which  would take more time.
 Or we  could try  the Table --  I've been having  good luck  with that
 lately..."
      "That  sounds interesting,"  Dale interrupted.  He didn't  really
 care, and wasn't  interested in hearing another  scholar's lecture. He
 got quite enough of that from his father!
      "So be it.  Let me get ready.  By the way, my name  is Zavut. Why
 don't you  sit down?"  The old  man indicated the  smaller of  the two
 chairs, and inched  around the table to the other  himself. He reached
 under the table and brought forth  a stubby black candle, a cloth, and
 a piece of  fur. He began to  clean the surface of the  table with the
 white  cloth. When  he was  done, Dale  could see  the symbols  in its
 surface much more clearly. It featured  a wheel with many spokes, each
 inlaid with a different colored stone. Each spoke's stones were darker
 at the edge of the table,  and brilliant at the center, making several
 clearly-defined concentric circles.
      "KARK!" The  tone of command  in Zavut' voice startled  Dale. The
 candle was now  burning, and Dale wondered how the  seer had done that
 so quickly. Clearly, he was supposed to think it was magic, by the way
 the  old man  was smirking.  Of course,  Dale knew  better --  he just
 didn't have an explanation right at hand.
      Zavut  took  up the  piece  of  orange  and  white fur  and  very
 carefully rubbed it on the table, following the contours of the wheel.
 Then  he  also  rubbed  it  on the  candle,  and  repeated  the  whole
 procedure.
      Zavut then stood  up, took up the lit candle,  and walked over to
 Dale. "Please stand up." He then pulled the chair aside.
      "This candle is made of beeswax and the blood of a bull. You will
 hold it in  your off hand, at  shoulder height, and drip  wax onto the
 table. Try as  hard as you can to  keep the wax in the  very center of
 the wheel.  I will tell  you when  to begin and  when to stop.  Do you
 understand?"
      "Yes."
      "Good." The seer handed him the candle and guided Dale's extended
 left arm  over the center of  the table. "Concentrate on  the flame --
 see  nothing else."  Dale let  his vision  be drawn  into the  dancing
 light. He'd thought  the candle black, but near the  flame it glowed a
 deep, rich red. But the candle soon disappeared from his vision as the
 bright flame swallowed up all  less brilliant images. The flame danced
 with  the  boy's every  breath  and  flickered hypnotically  as  Zavut
 removed his hands from Dale's arm.
      After a few moments, Dale could  feel his arm beginning to wobble
 with fatigue and  saw the result in the flickering  of the candle. But
 Zavut' voice  came from  beside him. "Continue  to concentrate  on the
 flame. You may begin."
      Dale slowly  turned his wrist,  but he couldn't tell  whether any
 wax was dripping from the candle. He saw the flame flicker crazily. He
 noticed  that he  had  turned the  candle enough  that  the flame  was
 touching the wax  itself. He smelled the pungent odor  of burning wax.
 His arm  was beginning  to ache, and  he felt sure  that he  must have
 covered half of the table by now, when he heard Zavut' voice again.
      "Now, turn the candle back upright, bring it away from the table,
 and blow it out." Dale complied. But after staring at the flame for so
 long,  his eyes  weren't  able  to make  out  anything  of the  seer's
 chamber. Zavut  guided him back into  his seat. "Now, you  sit and let
 your eyes recover,  while I look at this casting  and try to interpret
 it."
      Dale sat for a  while. He was able to see things  on the edges of
 his vision, but he couldn't see  anything if he looked at it directly.
 And closing his  eyes wasn't any better, because of  the dancing spots
 left by the  candle's intense light. Dale was  annoyed and frustrated.
 And  it didn't  help that  Zavut kept  making odd  noises. First  he'd
 grunt, then he'd hmm, then he'd tsk, then he'd hunh...
      Although  Dale's  vision  gradually  cleared,  his  understanding
 didn't.  Droplets of  burgundy-colored wax  were scattered  around the
 table,  but mostly  in  the center.  There were  a  couple very  large
 blotches just  off-center. Dale tried  to figure out what  the symbols
 meant for the spokes with the biggest blotches of wax, but they didn't
 seem to have any inherent meaning.  At least, none he felt comfortable
 guessing at.
      Zavut  sat back  with a  dissatisfied  "Hunph!" Dale  gave him  a
 quizzical look, but the only response  he got was a curt "Be patient."
 The  seer  continued to  contemplate  the  Table  for a  moment,  then
 addressed his customer.
      "Well, this  is an interesting  cast, young man! I  usually don't
 bother explaining the  Table to customers, but I think  you might need
 the knowledge in order to fully  understand this casting and maybe add
 your own thoughts to the interpretation.
      "The most  basic concept is that  how far the wax  falls from the
 center is extremely important." Dale congratulated himself on guessing
 that, while Zavut continued to  explain. "In the grossest terms, blobs
 in  the middle  represent long-term  predictions and  droplets at  the
 edges of the Wheel represent your immediate future. This is because in
 the long term,  it's easy to predict that you'll  experience a balance
 of just  about everything. That's  why the  middle is so  blotchy. The
 center  usually doesn't  tell us  much, so  we look  at the  outermost
 droplets to get an idea about  what's going to happen tomorrow or next
 week."
      Dale quickly tossed aside his previous guesses and reassessed the
 wheel. There were only  a couple spots at the edge  of the table, with
 no apparent meaning or connection.
      "About the  only thing the middle  tells us about your  life as a
 whole is that  you'll be well-liked and are of  a literary bent." Dale
 immediately suspected  that Zavut had  recognized him as  the scribe's
 son, but Zavut  continued, apparently having discarded  the comment as
 irrelevant.
      "But there are some very definite things we can see in the coming
 days. Look. These four are the only spots outside the fourth circle --
 that should make matters very clear," he pointed out each one in turn.
 "And although  they're in  different quadrants,  their interpretations
 might be very complementary.
      "See  this spot?"  Dale looked  where Zavut  pointed. "This  sign
 represents a  new approach --  a new  way of meeting  old challenges."
 Dale  was  taken  aback;  this  sounded  an  awful  lot  like  Simon's
 philosophy about adventure. The seer  looked up at his customer. "Does
 that make  sense to you?"  Dale nodded,  but remained silent.  After a
 moment, the seer went on.
      "And this  spot over here is  similar." Dale looked at  the spot,
 which was  right next  to a  glyph of  an ornately-decorated  cup. "It
 represents new friends and new relationships.
      "The  third spot,"  continued  Zavut,  "fell in  a  sign that  is
 interpreted as  overindulgence or excess.  And the fourth  spot, here,
 represents  resolution of  conflict by  a dramatic,  permanent change.
 Mind you, I've put these in an  order that makes sense to me, but that
 may not be how you experience them..."
      Dale sat back and pondered Zavut'  words. The first spot had been
 surprisingly on  target, but he had  no idea about the  next two. What
 were they? New friends, and  overindulgence. And then a resolution. It
 didn't sound like the rest of that applied, but the bit about new ways
 of looking at things was right on.
      Dale stood up. "Thank you, seer. When  I came here, I had no idea
 what  to expect.  But your  wheel has  given me  some things  to think
 about. Perhaps I'll be back again sometime."
      Zavut stood and parted the curtain for Dale. "Good. People try to
 make something mystical about it,  but that's really all that sagacity
 is: giving  people something to  think about."  He patted Dale  on the
 shoulder and stopped at the threshold of his booth.
      Dale stood blinking  in the afternoon sun.  He'd actually enjoyed
 the reading.  But he  wondered if  he could call  it an  adventure. It
 certainly was  something he'd never  done before,  and it was  kind of
 exciting, too.  He found that he  wanted to tell someone  about it. It
 really did  feel like  a little  adventure. Simon's  philosophy seemed
 pretty useful, after all.
      Dale  was  curious  as  he  thought  forward  to  when  his  next
 opportunity to put Simon's philosophy to work might occur.

      He stood in the bright sunlight  for a moment, wondering where he
 should go  next. Across the street,  a handful of people  stood around
 the booth  where Jenzun, the  local instrument-maker, sold  his wares.
 Jenzun was entertaining the people by demonstrating his skill with the
 dulcimer, and  Dale made his  way across the  street so that  he could
 listen. As  he approached, he noticed  that one of the  people who was
 also listening was a young woman he knew named Erica. Dale admired her
 quietly, as he had so many  times before: burgundy hair that perfectly
 framed  her dark  brown eyes  and friendly  smile. He  picked his  way
 through the people and stood beside her.
      As Jenzun  began a new, lively  trotto, he was joined  by another
 musician playing one of Jenzun's wooden  box drums, and another on the
 rauschpfeiffe.  The  audience  started  clapping their  hands  at  the
 appropriate  points in  the song,  and  Dale joined  in. Noticing  the
 sound, Erica  turned and saw Dale  for the first time.  Her eyes, deep
 and mesmerizing, met his, and she smiled warmly.
      Dale smiled,  then looked down  at his feet in  embarrassment. He
 wasn't any good  at talking to girls, especially girls  that he liked.
 Fortunately, she turned back to the musicians, although that left Dale
 to stand next to  her, feeling as if his feet  were twice normal size.
 She  was expecting  him to  say something.  Dale felt  each moment  of
 silence pass like an accusation.
      Dale thought back to Simon's words about doing things he'd always
 wanted to  do. But this  was Erica!  This was *important*!  But Zavut,
 too, had said  something about new friendships.  And approaching Erica
 would certainly be something he'd never done before!
      More moments passed as he tried to formulate something to say. He
 suddenly realized that the  tune was coming to an end,  and that if he
 wanted to talk to her at all, he'd have to do so now.
      "Erica?" As she turned, she was looking downward. Then she raised
 her gaze to  meet Dale's, and he  felt like he was  falling into those
 deep, dark eyes of  hers. He was completely in awe  of her beauty. But
 he had something he was going to say...
      "Umm... You be  interested in coming out to the  archery butts or
 anything?"
      Damn! It wasn't very eloquent, but  he'd run out of time. And she
 just stood there, looking at him  and smiling in a faintly preoccupied
 manner, as if musing about his  ineptitude. Then she seemed to come to
 some sort of decision, and took his hand up in hers and patted it.
      "Dale... I'm glad  I ran into you today. Later  this afternoon, a
 bunch of us are going swimming out  at the quarry, and I'd like you to
 come, too."
      The  quarry?  "But  the  quarry's  off  limits,  isn't  it?  It's
 dangerous!"
      Erica's  eyes gleamed.  She brought  her face  closer to  his and
 whispered to him conspiratorially. "That's  just what they say to keep
 the kids away. We've been there dozens of times, and no one has gotten
 hurt. It's really lots of fun!"
      Dale couldn't argue about something he really knew nothing about,
 which gave him pause.  How did he know it was  dangerous if he'd never
 even been  to the quarry? If  his father had been  wrong about fortune
 tellers, he  could be wrong  about the  quarry, too, right?  And Erica
 said it  was fun...  And the  prospect of  spending an  afternoon with
 Erica was worth the risk. After all, if he went and discovered that it
 really *was* dangerous,  he didn't have to do anything  he didn't want
 to.  And this  certainly would  qualify  as an  adventure, by  Simon's
 definition. It was something he'd  never done, just because his father
 had always  said it  was wrong.  So it was  pretty easy  to come  to a
 decision with Erica looking at him like that!
      "Okay! When?"
      Erica rewarded  him with a smile.  "Meet me at the  quarry at six
 bells? I've got to go pick up some things at home. Straight?"
      "Straight. See you then."
      She flashed him a final smile over her shoulder. "Bye!"
      Dale  watched as  Erica walked  away, then  turned and  looked at
 Zavut' booth accusingly. "Yes!!!" he exclaimed, and ran off toward his
 home.
