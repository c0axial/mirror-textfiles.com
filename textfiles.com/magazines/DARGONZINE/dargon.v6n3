 which started rather a few volumes ago.  Enjoy.)

                      Despatches From the Field:
                         Prelude to Invasion

      Nober. A  time of endings and  beginnings. The year is  1013 B.Y.
 and there are numerous celebrations  being planned to mark the turning
 of  the  year. Just  a  few  short  weeks  earlier, King  Haralan  had
 celebrated  his thirty-sixth  birthday. Sir  Edward Sothos,  Haralan's
 close friend  and advisor  and the  kingdom's Knight  Commander, would
 soon celebrate his thirty-first.
      Winter had  come slightly earlier  than expected and  displayed a
 ferocity such as  few could remember. The storms  raging outside Crown
 Castle's  environs  went almost  un-noticed.  Inside  the castle,  the
 nobles of the  land were engaged in heated debate  and exchanging even
 hotter words in the great War Council called by the King.
      The past  year had  been a tumultuous  one for  the third-largest
 kingdom on the continent. Early in 1012, rumors began circulating that
 Bichu, an  island Empire  south and  west of  Baranur was  planning to
 invade. Almost nothing was known about Bichu. Other than the fact that
 the Bichanese warriors, samurai they  were called in the native tongue
 of Bichu, were fanatical in battle  and were said to possess swords of
 un-matched quality, the most the  average Baranurian knew of Bichu, if
 they knew of it at all, was that they were alien and they wanted their
 land. Thus spoke the rumours.
      The truth  was very different.  In reality, the rumours  had been
 started by a  group of nobles and merchants from  Duchy Dargon, in the
 extreme northwest. This small group  of individuals had been persuaded
 to stir up trouble by agents of the Beinisonian Emperor, Untar II. The
 general idea  was to  make Baranur  and Bichu  go to  war so  that the
 Beinisonian Empire could  then move on Baranur, which  would have been
 weakened considerably by the war, thus  adding the lands of Baranur to
 Beinison only a modicum of effort.
      To  this  end,  the  conspirators planned  the  assassination  of
 several  of Baranur's  nobles, chief  among these  the Duke  of Dargon
 himself.  The  assassination  attempt  against the  Duke  failed,  but
 resulted in the  death of one of  the heirs of the  Barony of Connall.
 The Connall family were relatives of Duke Dargon and with him had been
 among the most  vociferous in their protestation against  going to war
 with Bichu. Since the Barony now  had only one surviving member of the
 ruling family, the decision of whom to choose as successor to the late
 Baron was now academic. Luthias  Connall was invested as Baron Connall
 by his cousin the Duke and all seemed fine.
      All was  not fine, though.  Duke Dargon had appointed  Connall as
 Duke's Advocate, chief upholder of the King's Justice in the Duchy. As
 Duke's Advocate, it fell to Luthias to investigate the conspiracy. The
 primary  conspirator,  Baron  Coronabo,  contrived  to  have  evidence
 planted in  Duke Dargon's office that  implicated the Duke as  the man
 behind the plot to have Baranur go to war with Bichu, and thus the man
 responsible for Connall's twin brother's death.
      Connall was forced  to investigate the charges  and he concluded,
 however reluctantly,  that there  was indeeed  evidence to  proceed to
 trial. By Baranurian  law, a high-ranking noble such as  a Duke had to
 be tried before the  King in Magnus. Sir Edward, in  Dargon to judge a
 tournament, escorted  Duke Dargon to  Magnus for the  trial. Defending
 Dargon  was Lord  Marcellon of  Equiville, Dargon's  father-in-law and
 former Royal Magist.  As Duke's Advocate for Duchy Dargon,  it fell to
 Baron Connall to prosecute.
      By summer,  1013, it  was over.  Working together,  Marcellon and
 Connall  had  exposed  the   real  conspirators  and  proved  Dargon's
 innocence. King Haralan called a  War Council of respected nobles from
 throughout the Kingdom. This Council would give the King advice on how
 to respond to the Beinisonian plot. An early decision was made to send
 Count  Connall, newly  created  as  such in  reward  for exposing  the
 conspiracy, to Beinison  as Ambassador. There he would  inquire to the
 Beinisonian Emperor as to his intentions towards Baranur.
      The summer also saw the arrival of a most unexpected embassy from
 the Empire of Galicia, Sir Edward's homeland. Galicia had, for several
 hundred years and  by it's own choice, been isolated  from the outside
 world. It  maintained a  policy of aggressive  neutrality. No  one was
 permitted to  cross the  border in either  direction excpet  by direct
 command  of the  Emperor,  Nyrull I.  The origin  of  this policy  was
 unknown save  by the  Galicians themselves  and they  weren't talking.
 Thus,  the arrival  of an  embassy from  the Galician  Emperor was  an
 occasion of note.
      Haralan was pleasantly surprised to  find that the ambassador had
 instructions to work out some sort  of trade agreement between the two
 nations. He was less than happy  when his Knight Commander nearly took
 the ambassador's head off, quite literally, when the two met.
      Sir Edward and  the ambassador had been old foes  from their days
 as mercenaries in the chaotic Kingdom  of Alnor, built on the ruins of
 the  ancient Fretheod  Empire on  the continent  of Duurom.  Moreover,
 Ambassador Myros was  also Baron of Alphoria. For close  to a thousand
 years, Alphoria had  been held by the Sothos family.  Myros took great
 delight in informing  Sir Edward that Edward's father,  Dion, had been
 executed for  treason. Adding to Sir  Edward's rage was the  fact that
 Myros  was accompanied  by his  wife, Elaine.  Elaine Myros,  formerly
 Elaine Janos, daughter to the former  Count Janos, had been the object
 of  Edward's affection  eight  years earlier  in  Galicia. Edward  had
 killed  the son  of one  of Galicia's  powerful Dukes  in a  duel over
 Elaine and  was forced into  exile. Myros  knew full well  the history
 between  his  wife and  Edward  and  took  further delight  in  seeing
 Edward's reaction. The War Council  dragged on into winter, awaiting a
 reply from Count Connall, and the Galician embassy stayed to observe.
      Ambassador  Myros  had  his  own personal  agenda  in  coming  to
 Baranur. He was part of a cabal,  headed by Duke Markin, the father of
 the man  Edward killed,  that was plotting  to overthrow  the Galician
 Emperor. Myros  saw in  the embassy a  perfect opportunity  to recruit
 allies and a source of men and material for the coming coup.
      With Myros was a sorceress by  the name of Celeste. She professed
 to be  in Myros'  service, but  in reality,  she was  a member  of The
 Order, a  secret organization of  Galician mages dedicated  totally to
 preserving the Empire. The Order's  leader, the Primus, had instructed
 Celeste to report  on Myros' activities. Myros was known  to The Order
 as one of  the cabal and they  hoped to learn more  about Myros' plans
 while in Baranur  and about Baranur itself. Celeste, too,  had her own
 agenda to pursue.  While reporting on Myros, she hoped  to utilize the
 information she gained to turn the situation to her best advantage.
      The end of the War Council was spectacular. An Ambassador arrived
 from Beinison with a  gift -- the head of Luthias  Connall in a golden
 box.  On the  same day,  just  after the  "gift" had  been opened,  an
 assassination team from Galicia arrived  with the intent of "removing"
 Myros and his chief advisors.
      The result  of these two events  was that an angry  King declared
 war on Beinison and Myros escaped while his underlings died. In a move
 that  surprised the  whole Baranurian  Court, Celeste,  leader of  the
 assassination  team, offered  Sir Edward  the coronet  of Alphoria  by
 Nyrull's command.  Sir Edward refused,  saying his oath to  his friend
 and King, and the coming war, demanded that he stay in Baranur.
      The new  year would bring red  war to the Kingdom  of Baranur and
 the tales the bards would tell would  be ones of great heroes and even
 greater tragedies.

                       Despatches From the Field:
                             Bloody Spring

      Deber, 1013,  finds the Kingdom  of Baranur gripped by  the worst
 winter in living memory. War has come to Baranur, a war of inaction --
 nothing can move through the heavy snows and freezing cold.
      Into this frozen  hell journey brave men and  women on struggling
 horses. They carry messages to  all corners of the Kingdom, announcing
 war. The people have not been expecting war, not with Beinison and the
 news comes  as a shock. In  the barracks and cantonments  of the Royal
 Army, the shock is a double one. For with the declaration of war comes
 orders from the Knight Commander --  Move south with all haste. In the
 dead  of  winter,  the  commanders   of  the  Royal  Army  stare  with
 incredulity at seemingly impossible orders.
      Edward Sothos,  Knight Commander of  the Royal Armies,  knows how
 difficult  the orders  are.  He gives  them because  he  has no  other
 choice. The  Royal Army  can muster  43,000 warriors  at the  start of
 Deber. Fourteen thousand in each  of the Northern and Southern Marches
 and fifteen thousand at Magnus. Another 10,000 are being recruited and
 trained and must remain in their  training schools. The Militia of the
 Kingdom, 50,000 strong, are mobilizing  also though the quality of the
 Militia Regiments varies widely.
      Sir Edward knows his troops will  be facing the full might of the
 Beinisonian armies and so he gives  the order for all available troops
 to  bolster Knight  Captain Martis  Westbrook's Army  of the  Southern
 Marches. The  Northern Marches,  under the  command of  Knight Captain
 Ailean of Bivar, is stripped of troops -- Sir Ailean is left with only
 five  thousand out  of his  original force  of fourteen  thousand. The
 Magnus Garrison remains as a strategic reserve.
      As  the preparations  go on,  Edward and  Marcellon are  summoned
 south by the Duke of Pyridain. A man sufering heavily from his travels
 has come from Beinison. He claims  to be a Baranurian subject and says
 he has information for the Knight Commander.
      With spring almost upon the  land, Edward and Marcellon arrive to
 interrogate the  traveller. They  discover him to  be none  other than
 Luthias Connall,  whose very "execution"  by the Beinisonians  was the
 spark that started the war, very much alive and in very bad condition.
      From him, they learn that the Beinisonians are planing a surprise
 attack  on  the Laraka  River,  Magnus'  economic lifeline  and,  now,
 under-defended. They also  learn that the enemy does not  plan to wait
 until summer, the traditional campaign season, to attack. Sir Edward's
 strategy  of concentrating  his forces  in  the south  will blunt  the
 enemy's  main  attack  but  has  left the  entire  Northwest  open  to
 invasion.
      By Melrin, the Royal Army is  reeling from losses on both fronts.
 In  the  South,  the  enemy's   main  army  shattered  Knight  Captain
 Westbrook's force at Oron's Crossroads.  Virtually the entirety of the
 Noble  Houses of  the Southern  Marches  is annihilated  and a  goodly
 portion  of  the  Pyridain  Militia  with  it.  In  what  will  become
 recognized as  one of the great  blunders of the war,  the Beinisonian
 Emperor, Untar II, allows Martis  Westbrook to extricate over half her
 19,500 troops unmolested. These troops will  continue to be a drain on
 Beinisonian resources throughout the war.
      Untar's main  army, the Fist  of the  Emperor, goes on  to reduce
 Pyridain  City  (defended by  the  remnants  of the  Baranurian  heavy
 infantry that  fought at Oron's  Crossroads), and begins its  march on
 Magnus, laying waste to the countryside as it goes.
      In the North,  20,000 troops commanded by  an up-and-coming field
 marshal of  the Beinisonian  army, Joachim  Vasquez, lands  at Sharks'
 Cove (Duchy Quinnat)  on the mouth of the Laraka  River. Sir Ailean of
 Bivar  meets this  attack  at the  water's edge  with  5,500 men.  The
 Baranurian forces  give the  elite light  troops of  the enemy  a good
 thrashing  but  are finally  overwhelmed.  Lord  Morion of  Pentamorlo
 rallies the survivors and begins a long and gruelling retreat down the
 Laraka. He plans to make his  stand at Gateway Keep, 250 leagues north
 of Magnus and designed for just this purpose.
      Vasquez moves quickly in pursuit,  but is delayed at Port Sevlyn,
 a city  of 10,000 halfway  between Sharks'  Cove and Gateway  Keep and
 thus a  vital base of  supply. One of  the Duchy of  Quinnat's Militia
 Regiments garrisons the city and determines  to hold off the enemy for
 as long as possible.
      The 1,000  defenders hold off the  enemy army for three  days, an
 incredible feat of arms. At the  end, Vasquez orders the garrison, and
 half  the populace,  put  to the  sword as  an  example to  discourage
 further resistance.  He leaves  some troops to  garrison the  city and
 moves off down the Laraka towards Gateway and Magnus.
      As Yule, 1014, reaches its  midpoint, three great armies threaten
 Baranur. In the South, Untar and the 30,000 strong Fist of the Emperor
 are drawing  ever closer to Magnus  and if not checked  will arrive by
 Seber.  On the  Laraka,  Vasquez has  received  reinforcements and  is
 preparing to  launch an attack  on the desperate defenders  of Gateway
 Keep. In the North, a force  of 15,000 approaches Dargon City from the
 sea undetected.
      To counter  the threat to  the capital, the Knight  Commander has
 sent Baranur's heavy  cavalry, the 8,000 strong Royal  Hussars, to aid
 Lord Morion  in his defence of  Gateway Keep while other  forces begin
 the march toward Magnus, hoping to reach the city before the enemy.
      The spring  of 1014 has been  one of blood and  death. The coming
 summer promises to be one of carnage and horror unsurpassed.

1                          Heroic Couplet
                            by Jeff Lee
                          jlee@smylex.uucp

      Thomas  Shopkeeper knelt  on  the  cold stone  in  front of  King
 Haralan, well aware of the many eyes on his back.
      "This  man," the  King  proclaimed to  the  gathered crowd,  "has
 singlehandedly removed the  greatest threat that our  fair country has
 known in over a  century. The Beinison threat is ended,  and we can at
 last return to peace!"
      As  the crowd  roared,  Haralan  stepped back  to  make room  for
 another. Sir Edward Sothos, towering  over the kneeling Thomas, laid a
 black-gloved hand on the man's  shoulder. "Thomas Shopkeeper, you have
 done  what neither  I  nor my  armies could  accomplish."  In a  voice
 overflowing  with  emotion,  he  continued:  "It  is  meet  that  you,
 therefore, rather than  I, should bear the title and  duties of Knight
 Commander  of the  Royal Armies."  Sothos'  brown eyes  gleamed as  he
 smiled down at the astonished man.
      When the cheers had again died away, King Haralan stepped forward
 once more. "Thomas, for your great service to Us, We are moved to make
 you a Baron of Our Court. No  more shall you be called Shopkeeper, but
 Baron Thomas -- the Hero!"
      "What are you  still doing in bed, you lazy  slug?" The cacophony
 of the crowd  was pierced suddenly by the shrewish  screams of Thomas'
 wife;  the finery  of  Dargon  Keep's great  hall  dissolved into  the
 dreary,  familiar  scene  of  Thomas' bedroom.  Sunlight  streamed  in
 through a broken slat in the shutters, and as Thomas watched, a beetle
 flew in through the  gap and hung transfixed for a  moment in the beam
 of light.
      "Nothing, dear, I was just getting up."
      "Don't  you  `dear' me,  slugabed!"  The  swat of  Madge's  broom
 punctuated her  sentences eloquently.  "It's daylight out;  you should
 have opened up the shop hours ago! But, no, you must lie here, wasting
 the best hours  of the morning. Now  GET" -- swat -- "OUT"  -- swat --
 "of BED!"
      "Yes, dear," he sighed.

      Thomas considered  himself as he polished  the brass candlesticks
 for the  third time  that morning.  He was  short, portly,  losing his
 hair; he looked, for the most part,  like his own father at forty. Ah,
 he'd dreamed,  when growing up, about  a life of adventure  and glory,
 but in  the end  he was only  a shopkeeper, like  his father,  and his
 father's father.  Timothy, his son,  was doing well at  University; he
 might escape the stagnation which had enfolded Thomas like the arms of
 an old lover.
      And then  there was  Madge. He'd  loved her  once, yes,  but that
 seemed so  long ago. The  lot of a  shopkeeper's wife was  like bitter
 herbs to her,  souring her gradually as the monotony  grew. She'd been
 beautiful  once, he  recalled;  so beautiful  before  the despair  and
 bitterness set in.
      He'd hated  himself that he couldn't  give her more in  life; his
 shame turned  him to drink.  What little  comfort he could  have given
 her, he'd  withheld by  going instead  to the  tavern. At  first, he'd
 stayed out until after she was  asleep; yet he still noticed the tears
 drying on the pillow when he got  into bed. The shame this caused him,
 though, would ever disappear into the bottle on the next night.
      He could  hardly blame  her, then, that  her tongue  became harsh
 whenever she spoke to him; that the hurt look in her eyes hardened and
 became, when  she bothered to  look at  him, one of  loathing. Gentle,
 beautiful Madge became a bitter shrew, and it was all his fault.
      Ah,  he said  to himself  as he  moved dishes  from one  shelf to
 another, if  only things  had been  different. If  only I'd  rescued a
 princess from a horrible monster. She'd have rewarded me well, and I'd
 have been a hero. I could have --
      "Thomas!" came Madge's shrill voice, interrupting his reverie. He
 spun  about guiltily,  then  flinched  back when  he  saw  her in  the
 doorway, brandishing an iron skillet as though ready to brain him with
 it.
      "What, dear?"
      "This skillet  is cracked!" She  waved it furiously as  proof. "I
 only bought it  a week ago, and now it's  completely useless. You take
 this right back to the ironmonger and DEMAND a new one!"
      Alas, Thomas mused  as he left his shop, by  the time you realise
 the damage you've done to someone, it's too late to repair.

      Thomas stopped in mid-stride as he heard the muffled cry from the
 alleyway. He gaped  stupidly as his eyes adjusted to  the dimmer light
 and reported the scene within the shadows.
      A man  lay on the  muddy ground, the  back of his  blue servant's
 livery  stained black  with blood,  which  pooled under  him like  the
 morning mist in a valley. Just beyond the body were two coarse-looking
 men, one holding  a wicked dagger at a woman's  throat while the other
 tore a jewelled pin from her bodice.
      "Here,  you,  take your  hands  off  her," Thomas  cried  without
 thinking. Both men turned towards him, the one with the knife throwing
 his captive roughly to the ground.
      The other, bigger  man leapt at Thomas, swinging  with a powerful
 roundhouse.  Instinctively, Thomas  ducked, then  brought the  skillet
 around with all his might, connecting with the back of his assailant's
 head. The man dropped like a felled ox.
      A sudden  pain made  Thomas look  down; the  handle of  the other
 ruffian's dagger protruded from his chest. As he fell to his knees, he
 heard the  man's footsteps  running out  of the  alley, back  into the
 street.
      "Ah," Thomas said,  his own voice seeming to reach  his ears from
 miles away. He  felt nothing, neither pain nor emotion,  and his mouth
 kept repeating,  "Ah, ah,"  of its own  volition. The  alleyway tilted
 crazily as  he toppled;  the ground  took forever  to receive  him, it
 seemed.  All of  his  warmth spread  from the  grievous  wound in  his
 breast, and darkness  began encroaching on the alley  from the corners
 of his eyes.
      Hands on his shoulders. The world tilting until the sky was above
 him. The lady  looking down at him, ice-blue eyes  wide in horror. She
 was as beautiful a woman as he had ever seen: petite, with short, dark
 red hair and skin  as white as the driven snow. He  gazed at her small
 mouth,  the thin  red lips  moving, but  her words  seemed muffled  as
 though she were speaking through many thick blankets.
      He wanted to cry  out, tell her that the red  mud was ruining her
 expensive clothes, but  he lacked the strength. He tried  to hear what
 she was saying, instead.
      "-- repay you;  you saved my life. Oh, please  don't --" He could
 see little more than her face now.  Her lips moved some more, and then
 she said, "You are a true hero."
      "A hero," he whispered; and then he smiled; and then he died.

                                  Part I
                             by John Doucette
                     <jdoucette@venus.cc.hollandc.pe.ca>

 Crown Castle, Magnus, Royal Duchy, Baranur
 14 Yule, 1014 B.Y.

      Haralan Tallirhan, by  the Grace of God King of  Baranur and Duke
 of Magnus,  watched the  column of  Hussars wind  its way  through the
 Royal District as it made its way towards Northgate.
      A  slight  breeze was  blowing,  bringing  some relief  from  the
 stifling  heat. In  the city  below the  first wall  of Crown  Castle,
 people were  going about their business  almost as if the  war was not
 merely 250 leagues from Magnus.
      The thing which  brought the war home to people  was the striking
 lack  of shipping  alongside the  city's  docks. With  the main  trade
 artery of  the Laraka now  denied the  capital, Haralan was  forced to
 bring in  by land  everything needed  to keep a  city of  50,000 souls
 functioning, a very expensive and unsatisfactory method of sustanance.
      To be  sure, food  was not a  problem - the  fields of  the Royal
 Duchy were rich enough to supply a population three or four times that
 which was  present. The state of  the city's commerce, however,  was a
 different matter.
      Ever since  the closing  of the Laraka,  the Merchant  Houses had
 been clamouring for Haralan to do something, anything, to re-start the
 flow of trade.  Prices had increased for the fifth  time since Melrin.
 The poor were  beginning to grow dissatisfied as well.  Soon, the King
 of Baranur could be facing riot inside the walls of his own capital.
      Assuming, of  course, that Untar hadn't  claimed Haralan's throne
 by then. Haralan's  friend and advisor Sir Edward Sothos  had for days
 been  sounding the  alarm  of  Untar and  his  Fist  of the  Emperor's
 progress.
      "You may succeed  on the Laraka, Connall, only to  find the heart
 of the kingdom gutted and burned," the king said under his breath.
      The  distinct  sound  of  hard boots  on  stone  interrupted  his
 thoughts. Haralan turned his head in the direction of the footsteps to
 discover Sir  Edward and Sir  Edward's aide, Commander  Jan Courymwen,
 approaching.
      "Edward!" Haralan said with a smile. "What news?"

      Also  watching the  departure of  the  Hussars, but  from a  much
 different vantage point,  were three men and one woman.  "I would have
 much  preferred the  Knight Commander  to  have sent  the Huscarls  or
 Legion of  Death with the Hussars,"  spoke the shorter and  younger of
 the three men.
      "Are you mad?"  asked the eldest. "We shall need  those troops to
 hold off the Beinisons."
      "Phorsan makes a  valid observation, Lieran," the  third and most
 expensively dressed  commented. "When the  time comes for our  Lord to
 move, the Huscarls may prove...difficult."
      "I don't know, Ethros," Lieran said. "If reports can be believed,
 the  Benison Emperor  and  his troops  have  smashed everything  we've
 thrown at them!"
      "That...foreigner...doesn't   know  how   to  handle   Baranurian
 troops," Phorsan said in disgust.
      Lord Ethros  of Northfield  turned from  regarding the  column of
 horsemen.  "Don't be  an  idiot!"  he snapped.  "Sothos  is a  capable
 general. *That* is why  I have been labouring for so  long to have him
 discredited. His is  the mind behind the strategy. I  dare say that if
 he had not moved  so many Regiments of the Royal  Army to the Southern
 Marches during the winter we would be prisoners of Untar even now."
      Phorsan  took the  rebuke angrily,  his hand  flexing around  his
 sword hilt. "You admire him!" he accused Ethros.
      "I respect  his abilities,"  Ethros countered calmly.  "As should
 you. With  Sothos as  shield, Haralan is  untouchable. Once  Sothos is
 gone..."
      "This is dangerous, Ethros!" Lieran said.
      "What say you, Lady?" Phorsan asked of the woman in the corner.
      "The prowess of the line Sothos  in combat hath long been known,"
 came the oddly-accented voice from the  shadows. "To face on the field
 the Knight Commander is to court the Reaper."
      "What do you suggest?"
      A black  form detached itself  from the  wall and moved  into the
 light, midnight black robes rustling against the stone, face hidden by
 the robes' cowl. "Force the Sothos to face thee in a contest for which
 thee art most suited."
      "Politics?" Lieran asked.
      "Politics," Phorsan said with satisfaction.
      "Politics," spoke Ethros with decision.
      "Politics," said Celeste in a voice smooth as silk.

      Haralan listened to his Knight Commander's report on the state of
 the Kingdom's army with supressed humour. The King was not a man given
 to flippant  mannerisms. Indeed, the  matters on which Sir  Edward was
 reporting were of  great import. The thing was, no  matter how hard he
 tried, Haralan  simply could not  fail to find  the sight of  his most
 trusted advisor standing,  literally, in the shadow  of that advisor's
 chief aide a cause for humour.
      The two of them made an  odd pair. The shorter, Edward, always in
 the  foreground of  attention while  the taller,  Commander Courymwen,
 invariably attempted  to blend into  the background. Much of  that was
 due to the station each occupied, of course.
      The personalities of each seemed mis-matched as well. Edward very
 rarely relaxed his posture in  public. Even in private, among friends,
 he was reserved. Haralan, Edward's  closest friend, saw his friend let
 down his guard only occasionally. Haralan wondered at what the adopted
 Baranurian's  homeland was  really  like if  it  regularly turned  out
 products such  as Edward.  Sir Edward  displayed such  an intenseness,
 such a resoluteness  of purpose, that almost all  of Haralan's knights
 were in awe of the man. As for the common soldiers, well, they reacted
 to Sir Edward  with a strange blend of fear,  respect, and utter faith
 in their  supreme commander.  Whenever he walked  into a  room, Edward
 dominated most by sheer strength of  persona. Talking to him, one felt
 as if Edward  had the height advantage instead of  the speaker. All in
 all, a surprise for those meeting the scarred Knight Commander for the
 first time.
      That  same feeling  of surprise  was also  felt when  meeting Sir
 Edward's aide, Jan Courymwen. With  her unusual height, six-foot four,
 combined with  her flaming-red hair  and deep emerald-green  eyes, one
 would  expect a  temper  and  attitude of  superiority  to match.  She
 possessed  neither. Even  the fact  that she  was the  second-youngest
 woman who  had gone through  the Royal  Military Academy to  reach the
 rank of Commander did not give her cause to be boastful.
      She  was a  study  in contrasts.  Decisive in  her  duties as  an
 officer of  the Royal Army,  she was often  shy and unsure  of herself
 when not on duty. Much of her deference came from the circumstances of
 her birth. Her  parents were from Port Sevlyn, poor  folk making their
 living  working   for  Lord   Quillien  Thorne  along   Port  Sevlyn's
 waterfront.  She owed  her position  at  the academy  to Lord  Thorne.
 Together, she  and Edward administered  the Royal Army better  than it
 had ever been administered in its long history.
      It  really was  quite sad,  Haralan  thought, that  such a  close
 friendship as she  and Edward possessed must come to  an end. The King
 sighed.
      Sir Edward ceased his narrative. "Something, Sire?"
      "Oh, nothing,  really," Haralan said  with a dismissive  wave. "I
 was wondering,  should we not  send at least  part of the  garrison to
 strengthen our forces facing the Fist of the Emperor in its advance?"
      "I think  not, my liege,"  Sir Edward responded. "Not  yet. Until
 conclusions on  the Laraka have been  reached, we dare not  weaken the
 capital."
      "Sound advice,  as always,  my friend."  Seeing the  Royal Magist
 approaching, Haralan eased himself from  the battlements with a smile.
 "What summons you to come calling on us, my Lord Marcellon?"
      "Busy, Sire?" Marcellon called out.
      "The Knight  Commander has just  finished reporting to me  on the
 state of the Kingdom as he sees it."
      "An exceedingly thorough and intense  view it must be," Marcellon
 jokingly commented as he joined the group.
      "War is not  a time for frivolity, Old Man,"  Edward said, rising
 to the bait.
      "With you,"  the Royal  Magist commented, "there  is no  time for
 frivolity." He continued, not giving  Edward a chance to speak. "Now,"
 he began, keeping  up a running joke the two  had been cultivating for
 weeks,  "why  don't  you carry  on  or  over  or  whatever it  is  you
 warrior-types do and let civilized men get down to some real work?"
      Sir Edward turned to the King. "If His Royal Majesty will permit,
 the Commander and I have work to do."
      "Certainly, Sir Edward. You have our leave to go."
      The  two warriors  saluted their  King and  strode off  along the
 wall, making  for the nearest  tower. Marcellon  winked at Jan  as she
 went and received an answering smile in return.
      Once  they were  out of  ear-shot,  Haralan turned  to his  chief
 advisor on things political. "Any success, Lord Marcellon?"
      "Regretfully, no. I can find no hard source for the rumours about
 them,"  he  said, indicating  the  retreating  figures of  the  Knight
 Commander and his aide. "I have suspicions, but can offer no proof."
      "Can your magic not--?"
      "Haralan, magic is  not the cure-all for the  world's woes. There
 is a limit to what I can do."
      "That is not sufficient! I am coming under increasing pressure --
 from within even my own House! -- to remove Edward. You must give me a
 weapon to use!"
      "I shall try, Majesty. I shall try."

      As they descended  the narrow stairs of one of  the great towers,
 Edward asked  over his shoulder,  "What would you say  to a go  on the
 practice field, Commander?"
      "It would be a welcome break in the routine, sir. I accept."
      The two  exited the  tower and  proceeded through  Crown Castle's
 many defences,  arriving some half an  hour later at the  King's Keep.
 They separated, each going to their rooms to fetch their gear.
      An hour  later, the sun  beginning to  set, Edward stood  in full
 panoply awaiting  his aide and his  friend. Once done, he  would still
 have his aide. But the friend would be gone.
      It is fitting I wear the  black over my shield and armour, Edward
 thought. For  today, I  shall truly  feel deserving  of this  badge of
 dishonour. A figure  in blue and gold  came out of a  small portal and
 walked steadily  out onto the field.  A crowd was starting  to gather,
 some out  of boredom, others  out of curiosity  to see who  the Knight
 Commander was to fight,  still others eager to pick up  a trick or two
 from the  man who directed  the Royal Army.  Edward waited for  Jan to
 reach him, resigned to  what he must do, shield on  one arm, helm held
 in the other.
      "Sorry I took so long, sir," Jan  said as she strode up. "My hair
 was not being cooperative."
      "It has now succumbed, I gather?"
      She smiled. "After a fashion, sir.  I had such trouble with it, I
 may consider getting it cut."
      "It would not suit you short so, Coury."
      "You like my hair?" she asked.
      Edward thought he detected a hint  of red in his friend's cheeks,
 but dismissed it  as an effect of  the sun. "Yes. Very  much. Shall we
 begin?"
      "Uh...yes, sir."  Jan took a  breath before speaking,  her manner
 now very  formal. "I  greet you  this day,  Your Excellency,  upon the
 field of combat. As challenged, I claim the right of selection. Do you
 affirm or deny my right?"
      Edward responded in the same manner, a manner which, as a Knight,
 came to him more easily than it  did his aide. "I greet thee this day,
 valiant warrior,  upon this field  of combat.  I here doth  affirm thy
 claim to the right of selection.  The claim of right of selection thus
 affirmed, I doth now take upon  my judgement the resolution. Dost thou
 recognize my right of resolution?"
      "I do recognize your right of resolution, Your Excellency."
      "I thank thee, worthy gentle. What shalt be thy pleasure?"
      "I choose sword and shield. What shall be the resolution?"
      "I choose as  resolution that the combat be to  the death with no
 quarter given."
      "I accept the resolution."
      Both combatants  donned their helms  and settled into  a fighting
 stance. Edward decided  on a quick, violent offensive and  moved in on
 Jan almost immediately.
      Jan backed up, trying to use her longer reach and longer blade to
 thwart the sudden attack. Edward came  right on in after her, sweeping
 at her  legs, forcing her to  use more of  her shield and less  of her
 sword.
      Realizing that a defensive strategy  was a course to destruction,
 Jan leaned in on Edward's next stroke, using her shield as a battering
 ram. It worked and the Knight  Commander soon found himself parrying a
 furious series of strokes that sent  sparks and bits of wood flying in
 the waning sunlight.
      Edward  was beginning  to get  the  worse of  the situation.  His
 aide's longer reach made it more difficult for Edward to get in a good
 strike. Consequently,  his shield  was being quickly  and methodically
 hacked to bits.
      After what seemed hours, but in reality was only several seconds,
 the two separated, standing five or so yards apart while each regained
 some strength and re-evaluated the other's skill.
      Edward  decided  that he  needed  to  be the  one  to  go on  the
 offensive and  he clearly  needed some advantage  to get  inside Jan's
 reach. Once inside her reach, he thought he could exploit a gap or two
 in her guard.
      He eased the remains of his  battered shield off of his left arm.
 "Art thou ready to continue?" he  asked Jan. In response, she saluted.
 At once, Edward flung his shield  at his opponent and followed it with
 a charge.
      Jan caught the thrown shield on her blade, sending the splintered
 target harmlessly to the ground. When  she brought her blade back into
 position, she found  herself facing her commander at  very close range
 coming  at her  from her  left, her  shield-arm. She  was too  slow in
 bringing her shield around to cover and  a hard thump on her ribs from
 the flat of Edward's blade finished the combat.
      A ragged  cheer from the  spectators evidenced their  pleasure at
 the spectacle.  As the crowd broke  up, Edward and Jan  left the field
 together heading for the entrance  to nearer to Edward's offices. Both
 walked in silence while they brought their breathing under control.
      "I thought I had you," Jan said between breaths.
      "You  very  nearly  did,"  Edward responded.  "It  is  your  time
 fighting in  line. You tend  to let your  guard down somewhat  on your
 left -- too much reliance on your line-mate's sword to protect you."
      Jan shook out her hair. "I'll work on it, sir, if you'll instruct
 me."
      "It's not as bad as all that, Coury. Just look at my shield."
      "It was a good workout," she agreed. Just then, she noticed where
 they were heading and sighed.
      "Something wrong?"
      "No, sir. Well, yes, sir. I'd hoped to turn in."
      "Let Daniel handle things?"
      "A bit selfish, sir, I know, but we could both use the rest."
      "And rest we shall. I wanted to  speak with you in private and my
 office qualifies. Besides, it's nearer than either of our quarters."
      Jan laughed. She  and Edward entered the Keep and  made their way
 to Edward's office. The corridors were mostly deserted, the occaisonal
 scribe or guard or member of the kitchen staff being encountered.
      They  entered  Edward's  outer office,  greeting  Captain  Daniel
 Moore, Edward's other  staff officer, as they did.  "How fare things?"
 Edward asked.
      "Nothing unusual, sir,"  Moore replied. "No new  reports from the
 Laraka and no change on the southern front."
      "Good. Glad to hear it."
      "So  who won?"  he asked,  indicating what  was left  of Edward's
 shield.
      "Who do you think?" Jan said with a chuckle.
      "It was a very near-run thing,"  Edward chimed in. "Coury made me
 work for it."
      Moore smiled. "Are you two staying?"
      "You can wipe that beseeching  look off your face, Daniel Moore,"
 Jan said with  relish. "Edward and I  are going to have  a little chat
 and then leave you to minding the store."
      Moore  sighed a  sigh  that seemed  to come  from  the depths  of
 despair. "One could always hope."
      Edward crossed to  the door to his office. "No  one is to disturb
 us, Daniel," he said as he and Jan entered.
      Edward set his helm and what was  left of his shield on the small
 table in the  corner opposite his large desk and  poured himself a cup
 of water from the pitcher there.  Jan joined him, setting her helm and
 much more  intact shield on the  table also. This left  Edward holding
 both the pitcher  and his cup. He  poured his friend a  drink from the
 cup she had rescued and went over to his desk.
      Jan  pulled  two chairs  over  from  the  table and  let  herself
 collapse into one of them. Edward set the pitcher down on the desk and
 then eased himself into the other.
      "I've been too long away from the practice field," he said as his
 rapidly stiffening muscles protested their recent abuse.
      Jan let her  head sink back against the chair.  "Me too. Oh, that
 smarts."
      The two close  friends just sat for a few  moments, letting their
 muscles finish  berating them  before they continued.  It was  Jan who
 spoke  first. "What  was it  you wanted  to talk  about, Edward?"  she
 asked, eyes closed.
      Edward  carefully set  his cup  on  the desk.  "Coury," he  began
 hesitantly, "I think  we should no longer be seen  together in public.
 Further, I  think it would  be best if we  kept our relationship  on a
 more professional level than it has thus far been."
      Jan's eyes  snapped open  and she  sat up.  "What?" she  asked in
 confusion. "By all the gods why?"
      "You know why," he said, eyes downcast. "The rumours."
      "The rumours?" she asked incredulously. "But -- you never -- they
 haven't mattered before," she protested.
      "They do now."  Edward ran his fingers  through his close-cropped
 hair.  "Coury, there  is a  danger that  if the  rumours continue,  my
 ability to  function as Knight  Commander may be threatened.  I cannot
 allow that."
      She sat  there, unable --  unwilling --  to believe what  she was
 hearing. "You...can't...allow...that?  Are you  trying to tell  me you
 care for  the power and prestige  of the position of  Knight Commander
 that dearly that you would...cut off our friendship just like that?"
      Now Edward looked directly at his aide. "What I am saying is that
 my continued friendship with you is  putting in jeopardy my ability to
 fight this war. I cannot compromise  that ability, not with the future
 of the kingdom at stake."
      The young woman  sat back. "I thought I knew  you. I thought that
 you were  a person who  above all else would  stand by his  friends. I
 thought you had more dignity and honour than this."
      "Coury, let me explain," he pleaded.
      "No, you've made yourself quite clear. You're too high and mighty
 to  have people  think you  could be  friends with  a commoner.  Well,
 fine." She stood, tears fighting with  her anger. "I once had a friend
 named Edward  Sothos. I don't know  who you are, but  if Edward Sothos
 should return,  he'll know  where to  find me."  Without giving  him a
 chance to respond,  she turned and left, slamming the  door on her way
 out.
      No sooner had  she stormed out than Daniel Moore  opened the door
 and leaned in. "Anything wrong, sir?" he asked his superior.
      "Wrong?"  Edward responded  as he  stared out  the window  at the
 shadows full upon the castle grounds. "No, Captain."
      "But -- Coury --?"
      "Leave it, Captain."
      The bafflement  on Moore's face  was plain. "What about  her helm
 and shield?"  he asked,  noticing the  articles on  the table  for the
 first time.
      Edward twisted in his chair to face his officer. His gaze flicked
 to the items on  the table and back to Moore. "Have  one of the guards
 take them to Commander Courymwen's  quarters," he instructed in a dead
 voice.
      "Yes, sir." Daniel was about to leave when Edward stayed him.
      "Captain," the Knight Commander said,  "I shall be at Gortholde's
 Hall  should I  be  needed." So  saying, Sir  Edward  pushed past  the
 still-bewilidered Captain Moore.
      As the door closed, Daniel shook his head. "Yes, sir."

      Those few servants unfortunate enough  to come upon Jan Courymwen
 as she  went to her  quarters quickly  and without dignity  shied away
 from the storm they saw in her face.
      Jan wrenched  open the door  to her room  and slammed it  hard as
 soon as  she was through.  She fell  back against the  door, seething,
 letting her anger have its way. That was soon spent as it finally sank
 in that Edward had actually ended their friendship.
      With that  realization came  an emptiness.  Edward was  more than
 friend to Jan Courymwen. He was  a mentor, an example of how society's
 ideals could work in  the real world. He was also  the first person to
 treat her as an equal as a warrior  and not just as a "girl playing at
 swords" as she had been called in the Academy.
      The war had come  home to Jan in a totally  unforseen way and she
 was unready  to deal with  it. When the tears  came, she did  not hold
 them back. Unlike her anger, her tears lasted a long, long time.

1                            'Bout 'Majin'
                         by David/Orny Liscomb
                    <ornoth%wonky.uucp@stratus.com>

      Darren emerged from the woods into the bone-warming sunlight of a
 warm spring day. There was still snow  in places in the woods, and the
 air within  had been sharp  and chill. After  the long months  of bare
 trees and  gray skies, the  dancing sunlight on  the deep blue  of the
 lake before him was a glorious sight.
      The road curved down to the  shore, just as the innkeeper back in
 Pride's Landing had said it would,  when Darren had asked him where he
 could find someone to take him  across the lake. A small cottage stood
 nearby, with a dock extending twenty  feet into the water. Against the
 side of  the building leaned  an old  rowboat, its wooden  planks gray
 with age.  A couple of  old men sat facing  the lake in  wooden chairs
 near the dock. Darren walked down and greeted them.
      "Excuse  me, milords.  I was  told  someone here  could ferry  me
 across the lake?"
      The old  men looked at  him. Darren waited.  The one on  the left
 spoke. "Tha's  so, junior.  But my  son Bug's got  the boat  just this
 second. Gone down to  the cove, do a bit of  fishin'. 'Majin' he'll be
 back 'fore nightfall. If'n so, 'majin' he'll take you across."
      Darren closed his  eyes. The innkeeper had told  him that getting
 ferried across the lake would save him half a day's walk. But in order
 to get here, he'd  had to walk two hours out of his  way. And now he'd
 have to wait for  hours -- and he still might have  to wait all night!
 And  he'd  wanted to  be  in  Westford tonight  to  be  early for  his
 brother's investiture ceremony.
      Darren thought. "Anyone else nearby who has a boat?"
      The  old man  shook  his  head. "Nope.  Can't  say  as there  is,
 junior."
      "Wait a  minute -- you've got  a rowboat over behind  your cabin.
 Can I take that?"
      The old  man shook his  head again.  "Tch. I wouldn't  feel right
 letting you take it. Ain't been in the water in a couple season."
      Darren sighed. These  old men hadn't used the boat  in years, but
 weren't willing to  let him take it?  Wait -- maybe that  was it! They
 were hedging about it because he'd leave  it on the far shore, with no
 one to row it back across the lake!
      "Look, let me  buy it from you.  Here -- here's five  drin. Can I
 take the boat?"
      The old man looked at the coins  in Darren's hand in front of his
 face. "Well,  I guesso. It's  not much of a  boat, really. But  if you
 insist..." He  held out a weathered  paw and Darren dropped  the coins
 into the leathery palm.
      He  turned around  and headed  toward the  cabin. He  rounded the
 corner and found the rowboat propped against the side of the building.
 As he tilted it away from  the building, something jumped out from the
 rotting leaves underneath.  Darren leapt back and let go  of the boat,
 which bounced loudly against the cabin, then fell to the ground with a
 thump, echoing the  pounding of his heart. He took  a deep breath; the
 rodent that he'd flushed had scurried away underneath the cabin.
      Because the wood  was dry, the boat wasn't too  heavy, and Darren
 didn't have much  of a problem hauling  it down to the  shore. The two
 old men just  sat there watching him,  not saying a word.  He ran back
 and fetched the two oars, which  the previous year's leaffall had half
 buried. He slipped the oars into their locks and pushed off.
      He started  pulling for  the other side.  Because he  was sitting
 facing the stern,  he watched the two  old men watch him  as the shore
 gradually retreated. He was out five  drin, but at least this way he'd
 make Westford by nightfall!
      He was probably two or three furlongs from shore before he turned
 again to  see where he was  headed. The opposite shore  stood at least
 another league distant,  and he took a moment to  admire the view. The
 trees were beginning to bud, and the valley would be a wonderful sight
 in autumn. He kind of envied the people who lived on the shores of the
 lake.  Things were  certainly much  simpler here  than in  the crowded
 crown city of Magnus.
      It  was about  this time  that Darren  noticed the  water in  the
 bottom  of the  boat.  He hadn't  noticed it  before,  because he  was
 wearing  his boots,  but  it was  already two  or  three inches  deep!
 Looking closer,  he could see  water seeping, in some  places flowing,
 between  the seams  in  the  planking of  the  boat.  The damned  boat
 couldn't hold water!
      Darren  looked  for something  to  bail  with, but  there  wasn't
 anything. He looked  longingly at the far shore, but  was certain that
 he couldn't make it across. He sat back down and resignedly turned the
 boat around  and headed back toward  the cabin and those  damnable old
 men.
      The row  back was  strenuous. The boat  was rapidly  filling with
 water, which slowed it down and made it heavier. He struggled with it,
 sweating and  cursing the entire  way. Once  he turned around  to make
 sure he was on course, and he saw the two old men sitting calmly, just
 as he had left them ten minutes earlier. He didn't turn around again.
      He was perhaps half a furlong  from shore when the boat foundered
 and just wouldn't move any more. There wasn't anything to do but swim.
 Darren turned  and glared at his  audience before he slipped  over the
 side of the rowboat and started to swim for shore.
      He rapidly began to tire,  and began venturing an occasional foot
 to probe for the bottom. His arms were encumbered by the wet fabric of
 his puffy  shirt, and  he struggled to  make any  progress whatsoever.
 Finally, he could feel  the bottom, but it was still  too deep to walk
 on; he bounded  along in a ponderous, bouncing mimicry  of a run until
 the water was shallow enough to allow him to walk.
      He finally  dragged himself out  of the lake. His  white chemise,
 now tan with silt  and green with bits of plants,  hung heavily on his
 shoulders, and  his boots  were calf-high buckets  of mucky  water. He
 walked up  to the old  men and just glared  at them. They  didn't even
 smirk.
      After a moment, one of them  spoke to the other. "You know, Jess,
 a boat made of dry wood just ain't no use."
      "Yep," replied  the other. "Gotta let  it soak fer a  while - let
 the wood swell and fill up all them little cracks."
      "Yep. 'Bout 'majin'."
      Darren just walked away, heading  back toward Pride's Landing. He
 wouldn't make  Westford by nightfall, but  he'd be sure to  make it my
 nightfall tomorrow,  even if it  took him half a  day to get  there on
 foot.
