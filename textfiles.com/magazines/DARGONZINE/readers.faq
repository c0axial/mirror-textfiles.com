What is DargonZine?

        DargonZine is an electronic magazine (ISSN 1080-9910) that
        prints original fantasy fiction by aspiring Internet writers. It
        is the publication vehicle of the Dargon Project, described
        below. It only prints Dargon-related stories. DargonZine is the
        successor of FSFnet, which was founded in 1984 and was the
        Dargon Project's original magazine. Between FSFnet and
        DargonZine, it is the longest running electronic magazine on the
        Internet.

What is the Dargon Project?

        The Dargon Project is a collaborative project, where many
        authors write in a common milieu, sharing settings and
        characters. Stories take place in a medieval fantasy world that
        is predominantly human, at a late medieval technology level, and
        where magic is relatively rare.

        The project was founded in 1985 as a way for aspiring fantasy
        writers on the Internet to meet and become better writers
        through mutual contact and collaboration as well as contact
        with a live readership via the Internet. See below for details
        if you are interested in joining the project as a contributing
        writer.

What is Dargon?

        The Duchy of Dargon is a typically small, out of the way
        holding, situated in the extreme northwest corner of the Kingdom
        of Baranur. It is separated from the rest of the kingdom by a
        vast wood and a range of hills, and is ruled by the young Lord
        Clifton Dargon. Dargon Keep stands on a hill overlooking the
        town and port of Dargon, which lie at the mouth of the River
        Coldwell. The port is Dargon's only link to the more populated
        south, and the town is an active and busy place. Adventure can
        be found both within the city's walls and in the surrounding
        wildlands.

|       Maps, a glossary, and a more detailed description of the milieu
|       can be found on the "About Dargon" page on our Web site at
|       <http://www.dargonzine.org/aboutdar.shtml>.

How can I subscribe to DargonZine?

        Subscriptions to DargonZine are free of charge. If you wish to
        have issues sent directly to you via electronic mail, you should
|       fill out the online subscription form at
|       <http://www.dargonzine.org/subscrip.shtml> or send an email
|       request to <dargon@shore.net> with your full name and email
|       address.

        If you prefer to download issues from the Web site, the
        rec.mag.dargon newsgroup (where issues are posted as they come
        out), or the various archives and FTP sites (see the "Back
        Issues" section, below), we offer a "notification subscription",
        whereby you will be sent a brief email notification each time an
        issue is published. That way, you won't need to periodically
        scan the archive site to determine that a new issue has been
        made available. If you would like a notification subscription,
        please clearly state that in your subscription request.

        Both types of subscriptions may be requested online via the
|       online subscription form.

Is there a DargonZine site on the World Wide Web?

        Yes! You can reach us at the URL:

|            <http://www.dargonzine.org>

        This site includes documents or pointers to all the
        Dargon-related resources you might need, including current and
|       back issues, a collection of maps, author bios, an online
        glossary, and much more!

        If you read DargonZine via the Web or an archive site, we'd
        still like to include you as a "notification only" subscriber
        (see the "Subscriptions" section, above).

What if I don't have network access?

|       At the present time we can only directly support readers who can
|       exchange email messages with the Internet. Relatively low-cost
|       network access can be obtained through many online services.

What's this Dargon-L I heard about?

        Dargon-L is the forum the Dargon Project writers use for
        planning, kicking around story ideas, and critiquing works in
        progress. Only contributing writers may subscribe to Dargon-L.
        (see "How can I submit stories to DargonZine?", below).

How can I obtain back issues of DargonZine or FSFnet?

        The easiest way is to start at the DargonZine Back Issues Web
|       page, at <http://www.dargonzine.org/backish.shtml>, but you can
|       also access them directly via the following methods.

        Back issues of both FSFnet and DargonZine are available online
        via anonymous ftp. Ftp to ftp.shore.net and look in the
        /members/dargon/back_ish directory.

        In addition, the Etext Archive maintain a collection of
        FSFnet and DargonZine issues in GNU Zip format. Ftp to
        ftp.etext.org and look in the pub/Zines/FSFNet and
        pub/Zines/DargonZine directories.

        AOL users can find back issues via the following:
             Keyword PDA
             Mac users select "Software Libraries"
             *All* users then select "Palmtop Paperbacks"
             The path from there is:
                Ezine Libraries->Science Fiction/Fantasy->Dargon-Zine

        Delphi users can find the FAQ and recent issues in the Fanzines
        database of the Science Fiction & Fantasy SIG. The Internet
        archive site for DargonZine is available on the Internet Gopher
        menu in the SF&F SIG. Look under the Fantasy Sites, Newsgroups
        and Homepages selection. The Dargon Project newsgroup is also on
        the Usenet Reader menu in the SF&F SIG.

How often do issues come out?

|       Issues are distributed irregularly. There are usually 8 to 12
        issues per year. Issues are usually four to eight weeks apart.

How large are typical issues?

        Issues usually are between 1000 and 2000 lines (75-100k). Users
|       of some systems (notably juno.com) may find that they are unable
|       to receive issues due to arbitrary file size limits on their
|       systems. In that case, we recommend that you obtain a
|      "notification-only" subscription and retrieve issues via FTP or
|       the Web.

How can I send comments or feedback to the writers?

        Comments and feedback are welcome, and can be sent to the editor
|       or directly to the individual authors (email addresses usually
|       accompany stories, and can also be found on the Web site). The
        newsgroup rec.mag.dargon also provides an unmoderated forum for
        readers to discuss Dargon stories with each other and the
|       writers. There are pointers to all these on our reader
|       feedback page, <http://www.dargonzine.org/feedback.shtml>.
        Reader feedback is enthusiastically encouraged.

How can I submit stories to DargonZine?

        New writers are always enthusiastically welcomed. Writers who
        are interested in joining the Dargon Project should contact the
        editor, Ornoth Liscomb, at <dargon@shore.net>, requesting the
        DargonZine Writers' FAQ, or view the Writers' FAQ at the Web
|       site at <http://www.dargonzine.org/writers.shtml>. That file is
        laid out very much like this one, and discusses all kinds of
        things that you need to know in order to get up to speed as a
        contributing writer.

Thanks for the interest, and help spread the word!!!
