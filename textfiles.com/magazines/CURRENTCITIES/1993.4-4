Networks and Networking

Blau, Andrew.  "CPF Airs Issues for K-12 Access to the 
Internet" Networks & Policy 1(1):3, 6 and in EFFector Online 
5(4) (March 19, 1993).  An Electronic Frontier Foundation 
project, the Communications Policy Forum (CPF) met with K-12 
stakeholders (educators, service providers, and legal 
experts) to discuss some of the legal issues surrounding 
Internet access for this constituency.  Despite the fact that 
"the Internet can enrich the resources available to both 
teachers and students..." the main topic of conversation at 
the meeting was the worry that "obscene" materials on the net 
might be discovered by minors.  A sidebar is included that 
outlines the CPFs recommendations for increasing K-12 access 
to the Internet. - DR

Bowman, C. Mic, Peter B. Danzig, and Michael F. Schwartz.  
Research Problems for Scalable Internet Resource Discovery. 
Boulder: University of Colorado, March 1992 (Technical Report 
CU-CS-643-93)[available via anonymous ftp as a  text or 
PostScript file from cs.colorado.edu in directory 
/pub/cs/techreports/schwartz as files 
ASCII/RD.ResearchProblems.txt.Z or 
PostScript/RD.ResearchProblems.ps.Z].  The authors describe 
some of the ways that developers of Internet resource 
discovery tools can address the problems of scaling.  There 
are three areas of growth to contend with in the Internet 
environment: an increasing user base, an increase in the 
volume of data, and an increase in the variety of data.  
These changes will make tools like WAIS, archie, and Gopher 
untenable in the not-too-distant future.  As the authors put 
it, "Imagine attempting to browse through a Gopher menu 
system with one million times as many entries as are 
currently present...." - DR

"Computer Professionals Call for Public Debate on New 
Government Encryption Initiative" (April 16, 1993) posted on 
CPSR@GWUVM (April 16, 1993).  The Computer Professionals for 
Social Responsibility has filed a series of Freedom of 
Information Act requests with numerous government agencies 
involved in telecommunications policy.  The request calls for 
full disclosure of both the technical specifications and 
implementation plan for the White House's data encryption 
scheme [see below].  At the heart of the request is concern 
that the National Security Agency will have too large a role 
in the creation and implementation of a non-military 
encryption scheme. - DR

DeLoughry, Thomas J.  "Campus Officials Pleased but Worried 
by Clinton Plan for 'Information Superhighway'" Chronicle of 
Higher Education 39(30) (March 31, 1993):A17-A18.  While at 
the Coalition for Networked Information meeting in March, 
many campus officials cautiously applauded the Clinton 
administration's support of national network development.  
The concern is that the traditional support of educational 
goals will be lost in the effort to gain the support of 
businesses.  A key area of concern here and in other forums 
is the proposal to limit access to the NSFNet backbone to 
data traveling between four (!) supercomputing centers.  
This would force the regional networks to contract with 
commercial providers for Internet access. - DR

Dern, Daniel P. "Peter Deutsch, 'archie,' and Bunyip Systems" 
Internet World 4(2) (March 1993):11-16.  In an interview with 
the Editor of Internet World, Deutsch offers a history of the 
wildly successful archie ftp archive locator system 
(developed by Alan Emtage and himself), his views on free-
market information systems on the Internet, and the plans for 
the commercial development of archie and other offerings from 
Bunyip Systems.  While charged with heresy by some in the 
Internet community, Deutsch believes that information and 
information services are best developed in a free-market 
system so consumers have more power, and providers can be 
paid.  As for universal access he says that after we secure 
funds for development and maintenance, "We can then seek to 
provide universality through grants and subsidies if we as a 
society decide (as I hope we do) that everyone should have 
access to the cornucopia." - DR

"Leading Telco CEOs Jointly Support Clinton-Gore Technology 
Initiative" (March 23, 1993) posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (April 
7, 1993).  In a press release signed by the CEOs of the 
leading US telecommunications companies, support is offered 
for the Clinton-Gore technology initiative as outlined in the 
paper "Technology for America's Economic Growth, A New 
Direction to Build Economic Strength."  Specifically, and not 
surprisingly, they support an increased role for private 
investors in the national networks, and a shift of government 
funds to specific areas that address societal needs and away 
from general subsidies which have inhibited commercial 
progress. - DR

Schwartz, Michael F., et al. "A Comparison of Internet 
Resource Discovery Approaches" Computing Systems 5(4) (Fall 
1992):461-493 [previously published in WAIS-discussion Digest 
56 (October 22, 1992)]. Schwartz and his co-authors (Alan 
Emtage, Brewster Kahle, and B. Clifford Neuman) present a 
taxonomy and analysis of Internet resource discovery tools.  
They include an overview of resource discovery systems 
(WHOIS, X.500, archie, Prospero, WWW, WAIS, Knowbots (tm), 
Netfind, and Gopher) and apply their taxonomy to these 
systems for analytic purposes.  Lastly, they summarize their 
findings and discuss the implications for the further 
development and integration of resource discovery tools. - DR

Smith, Jane. "CNIDR: Coordinating Internet User Tools" 
Internet World 4(2) (March 1993):8-10.  Smith, Assistant 
Director of CNIDR (pronounced "snider"), describes both the 
work of the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery 
and Retrieval as well as the six tools of discovery currently 
used on a wide scale (archie, Gopher, veronica, WAIS, WWW, 
and hytelnet).  CNIDR promotes the use and further 
development of NIDR tools by providing pointers to access to 
and information on the tools as well as a coordinating 
function between development groups.  In describing the tools 
here, Smith focuses on the current developments (including 
commercialization of archie and WAIS) and how these tools are 
being used in concert. Also included is information on how on 
can benefit from the work of the Clearinghouse. - DR 

"Statement by the Press Secretary [White House Crypto 
Statement]" (April 16, 1993) posted on CPSR@GWUVM (April 16, 
1993).  The White House announces its proposal to create a 
relatively inexpensive data and voice encryption standard 
that would be required of governmental organizations and 
voluntary for other.  This proposal is aimed at settling a 
long-running dispute between privacy advocates [see above] 
and law enforcement officials who want access to encrypted 
communications.  At the heart of the proposal is a 
government-developed "clipper chip" which is intended to be 
easily and cheaply added to telephones and other data 
communications devices by their manufacturers.  Encryption 
keys will stored by the US Attorney General in a secure 
database only accessible by court order. - DR

Steele, Shari.  "EFF Organizes Coalition to Oppose Wiretap 
Proposal" Networks & Policy 1(1):4, 7, 10.  Steele describes 
the proposals by the FBI to remain tapped in to the 
communications network in the age of digital telephony and 
rapidly changing technology (defeated last year, sure to 
reappear this one).  The FBI wants every service provider to 
assist in their efforts to engage in wire-tapping and would 
fine those companies that use technologies that are secure 
from such monitoring. - DR

"Steve Jackson Games Wins Lawsuit Against U.S. Secret 
Service" EFFector Online 5(4) (March 19, 1993).  In what the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation hopes will be a precedent 
setting case, a federal judge ruled that e-mail and bulletin 
board system postings are Constitutionally protected speech. - 
DR

Weitzner, Daniel J.  "Rep. Markey Endorses EFF's Open 
Platform Proposal" Networks & Policy 1(1):1, 3, 8-9.  
Weitzner describes the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Open 
Platform Proposal which aims to "make voice, data and video 
services accessible to everyone, in the near term, and at low 
cost."  While optical fiber in every home and office may be a 
long term goal, the EFF believes that a near-term solution is 
ISDN.  The goal of the platform is to encourage telephone 
carriers to create and interoperative open ISDN services. -

central computer systems.  The Department of State's Office of 
Public Affairs (OPA) and the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are 
profiled. - TR


General

Kountz, John. "Tomorrow's Libraries: More than a Modular 
Telephone Jack, Less than a Complete Revolution" Library Hi-Tech 
10(4) (1992):39-50.  Kountz presents a provocative view of the 
library of the future.  The author advocates converting the 
library into an electronic information distribution center that 
can support users regardless of physical location.  Fundamental 
to Kountz's vision of information delivery is the tablet 
computer, which he predicts will be an inexpensive ($150-$300), 
mass market commodity by the year 2000. - TR

Bauwens, Michel. "The Cybrarians Manifesto: Towards a new 
organisational model for corporate libraries?" Business 
Information Review (April 1993).  Baumen argues that the 
organization of the  traditional corporate library and its 
process of collecting and disseminating information has been 
made obsolete by technology.  As information becomes less 
dependent on location, and industries require information on 
a more timely basis and in formats that are readily usable, 
cybrarians must take the place of librarians.  Baumen also 
believes that this model will created a better job for the 
information professional by focusing on the most professional 
aspects of the job and thereby "free[ing] our creative 
capabilities even more and become real
agents of constant innovation." - DR
