Electronic Publishing

Cryan, Shelley. "Great Expectations" CD-ROM World 9(9) (October
1994):56-61. -- This article bills itself as "the ultimate guide 
to electronic literature" on CD-ROM. The three distinct
approaches to electronic publishing on CD-ROM are outlined:
simple text dumps, collections of related literary works, and 
single titles enhanced with multimedia elements. The straight
text dumps of the past are no longer acceptable to multimedia
saavy consumers, claims Cryan. Better publishers are adding
extra source material, sound, video and illustrations to offer
an experience different than one can get from the printed
page alone. Pegged as a particular standout of this genre is
the recently released _Halderman Diaries: Inside the Nixon White 
House_ which contains 2,200 pages of complete and unedited
text, home movies, 700 photographs, and 2,000 pages of 
additional text related to White House affairs. -- TR 

Eglowstein, Howard. "Due Recognition for OCR" Byte 19(10) 
(October 1994):145-148. -- Eglowstein presents a product review 
of four Optical Character Recognition (OCR) programs for Windows: 
OmniPage Professional 5.0, Recognita Plus 2.0 International, 
TextBridge 2.0 and WordScan Plus. Each product was tested for 
accuracy and throughput (accuracy divided by speed) and compared 
with price in mind. -- DR

Silverman, David. "SGML Takes on Database Management Responsibility" 
ImageWorld 3(9) (September 19, 1994): 35,37. -- Imaging, by its 
very nature, is one-sided. Textual information is not readily 
searchable when simply digitally stored as an image. The result of 
this structure creates 'chunks' of data which require indexes and 
pointers to organize it into a searchable form. If one OCRs the 
text, it does become searchable by keyword in addition to its 
pointers. But what if you want to use large amounts of textual and 
image data in a more strenuous manner? SGML offers one way to 
structure data by 'tagging' text and images according to a logical 
set of tags. Where HTML, a subset of SGML, structures data for 
display (to WWW clients), other forms of SGML can similarly 
organize data for searching, collecting and re-purposing in a 
variety of ways. SGML is becoming the standard for many types of 
information, and agreed upon by groups from the Coalition for the 
Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI) to the U.S. departments 
of Defense, Energy, and the FDA. This article is extremely useful 
in that it avoids hyping SGML, and simply offers the reader a 
concise explanation of what it is. -- RR



Multimedia and Hypermedia

Jerram, Peter. "Who's Using Multimedia" New Media 4(10) 
(October 1994):48-58. -- This article examines a recent 
survey, conducted by Dataquest, of businesses about their 
use of multimedia technology. Education and other non-profit 
markets are not well-represented, as this is a business 
survey, and neither is the market that is really fueling the
multimedia industry: the consumer market. However this survey 
can be very useful in outlining the types of use multimedia 
is often put to most (presentations) and by which business 
type (manufacturing) and by what profession (engineers). The 
article is more than a series of statistics though, as it 
cites case studies of how six businesses have put multimedia to 
use, as well as delving into future trends such as 
video-conferencing and multimedia public kiosks. This article 
is an informative snapshot of the current forces driving the 
multimedia market; forces which can eventually affect everyone 
who uses multimedia technology. -- RR
 
DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Museums Go High-Tech" Chronicle of Higher
Education. 40(3) (September 14, 1994):A47,A49. -- As an 
introduction to the world of information technology in museums, 
this article offers a brief, concise guide. It touches upon some 
of the salient issues facing museums using new technology, from 
the need to garner administrative commitment to improving services 
with technology, to the changing nature of the traditional, quiet, 
museum-going experience. A variety of approaches to using technology 
are covered, from a WWW site at the Krannert Art Museum [http://www.
ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/UIUC/KrannertArtMuseum/KrannertArtHome.html]
to a kiosk at the Michael C. Carlos Museum which allows visitors to 
"play" an ancient flute in the museum's collection by choosing 
various finger positions via a multimedia kiosk and hearing the 
resulting sound. One of the most useful parts of the article is the 
sidebar listing addresses of several museum efforts on the Internet. 
The article ends by making the point that new developments in the 
'virtual museum' will not replace the traditional museum, but will 
draw new types of visitors and increase interest in the museums of 
the future. -- RR
 


Networks and Networking

Cage, Mary Crystal. "The Virtual Library" The Chronicle of Higher
Education 40(4) (September 21, 1994): A23, A27. -- There is a wide 
range of challenges faced by institutions trying to establish fully 
digitized libraries. Among them are the technical challenges of 
providing optical-character-recognition of images that are scanned 
from poor quality originals; the high cost of the supercomputers; 
and the development of a system for protecting copyrighted material. 
On the other hand, many digital library projects such as Chicago-Kent 
College of Law and Project Janus out of Columbia University are 
working on such innovations as natural language searching which will 
allow users to browse and discover texts serendipidously. They are 
also working cooperatively with business and industry to help offset 
some of the costs associated with creating digitized library 
collections. -- MP

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Grant Provides $24-Million for 'Virtual 
Libraries' Projects" The Chronicle of Higher Education 40(6) 
(October 5, 1994): A26. -- The National Science Foundation, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Advanced 
Research Projects Agency of the Defense Department will award a 
total of $24-million to six universities to digitize materials in 
their libraries so that the texts can be accessed through computer 
networks. The six institutions receiving funds are: Carnegie-Mellon, 
Stanford, University of California at Berkeley, University of 
California at Santa Barbara, University of Illinois and the 
University of Michigan. -- MP

Frappaolo, Carl. "The Emerging Text Retrieval Market Caters to
Client-Server Computing" ImageWorld 3(9) (September 19, 1994): 
20,48. -- To deliver text to the user, this article poses three 
models: stand-alone computers, host-based network computing, and 
client-server computing. The model gaining most prominence of the
three is the client-server model. Within the client-server model, 
three approaches are outlined. These approaches, which could also 
be offered for other forms of information needing organized 
access such as images, offer varying degrees of power, flexibility 
and appropriateness. The range starts from one near to the 
mainframe host-based model where the client merely connects the 
user to the monolithic host which processes all commands, 
searches, and displays records the mostly passive client machine. 
The last model is the fully distributed model, where there are 
several local servers dynamically linked to an institution-wide 
network. This article indicates yet another area of computing 
affected by the move away from expensive centralized mainframe-type 
systems to flexible, locally controlled, yet intelligently 
connected servers. -- RR

Kantor, Andrew and Michael Neubarth. "Internet Interfaces: The Next
Generation" Internet World 5(7) (October 1994):30-32. -- The authors' 
article is the lead piece in a series of well-written, concise (four 
to five page) articles discussing all-purpose Internet tools, the first
of which has been the Mosaic browser. In addition to describing the 
history and future of Mosaic (there is an interview with Mosaic 
developer Marc Andreessen), articles cover NetManage's Internet 
Chameleon and O'Reilly's Internet in a Box products. Although Internet 
World may not be the first place to hear about Internet developments, 
their timely articles, especially the thematically grouped ones, are 
are well-edited and well worth perusal. -- JLO

-- In this excellent and easy to understand overview of the 
World-Wide Web, Morgan explains the basic technologies, protocols 
and software of the World-Wide Web. However, as Morgan is known 
for doing (ask him about "Mr. Serials," for example), he also gives 
us much more by describing imaginative and effective ways in which 
the technology can be used to create and manage library services. 
For this, and for serving the article in HTML to enhance its 
usefulness to his readers, Morgan gets high marks and the gratitude 
of this reviewer. -- RT

News that lists essential Internet resources in specific academic 
disciplines, this article provides a thorough yet selective list of 
resources in economics. It includes references to Internet collections 
of statistical data, private datasets, software libraries, biblio-
graphies of working papers as well as a related newsgroups. In addition 
to a list of important sources, the article also discusses the Internet 
tools that researchers can use to find other relevant resources. -- MP

Wilson, David L. "A Death en Route to the Data Highway" The Chronicle 
of Higher Education 40(6) (October 5, 1994): A21. -- Legislation that 
would have removed many restrictions on the telecommunications 
industry and would have therefore encouraged more development of the 
information infrastructure has been declared dead in Congress. Among 
the amendments added to the bill was a requirement that communications 
companies provide network access to schools at "preferential rates;" 
the bill would also have imposed price caps in order to provide 
"universal service" on the Internet. Analysts believe that the 
legislation died because the package contained too much regulation on 
the one hand and not enough protection for consumers on the other.

Optical Disc Technology

Sengstack, Jeff. "Fast Drives" CD-ROM World 9(9) (October 1994):39-45.
-- Sengstack presents both an excellent review of the latest 
generation of double, triple, and quadruple-speed CD-ROM disc drives 
and a frank and entertaining accompanying commentary. The speed demon
quad drives are not necessarily the best choice for some explains
Sengstack: "Quad-speed drives can push 386 PCs and slow Macs beyond
their processing limits, and putting a quad on a slow computer is like
putting a turbocharger on a lawn mower." Beyond that, most of today's
multimedia software is specifically designed to run on a single-speed
drive and does not appear to run any faster on a quad-speed. However,
the quad-speed drive definitely makes a difference if it being used
for text retrieval or business applications and they are absolutely 
essential for achieving acceptable quality video output. Is there an 
end in sight? Indeed, claims an industry expert. From a technological 
point of view, it is thought that a six-speed is a possibility, 
whereas an eight-speed is only a minor possibility. Reason being, 
ironically enough, is that faster drives may have slower access rates. 
What is looming on the horizon is a new blue-light laser technology 
which will increase the storage capacity of a CD-ROM disc to 1.6 
gigabytes compared to the 650 MB CD-ROM disc of today. -- TR
