Jensen, Mary Brandt. "Electronic Reserve and Copyright" Computers
in Libraries 13(3) (March 1993):40-45.  A discussion of the 
applicability of the copyright code to reserve readings that have 
been scanned and made available to patrons in electronic form. 
Although the article is not for the legal faint of heart, any 
library that contemplates such a reserve reading project would do 
well to study the legal implications of the copyright code as 
delineated in this article. - RT

Networks and Networking

Blau, Andrew. "Congressman Boucher Introduces NREN Applications
Bill--Offers Greatly Expanded Vision of Applications Program for 
Widespread Social Benefit" EFFector Online 5(7) (April 30, 1993).  
Blau offers a section-by-section analysis of the successor bill 
to NREN II, formally titled, the "High Performance Computing and 
High Speed Networking Applications Act of 1993."  Overall Blau 
views this bill as a major step forward, focusing attention and 
dollars on user applications along with greater participation 
in the planning and implementation process by various user 
groups: K-12, libraries, and community groups.  There is some 
concern that the bill's pledge to establish broadband connections 
to the broad base of users may slow down the implementation of 
any connection to some of these groups.  This bill looks good, 
and Blau's analysis helps in sorting out the details. - DR

Broad, William J. "Doing Science on the Network: A Long Way 
From Gutenberg" The New York Times 142(49,335) (May 18, 1993):B5, 
10 [Western Edition].  Broad offers an interesting and accurate 
description of the way the use of the Internet is transforming 
scientific research.  Broad describes how scientists are 
increasingly using the net to share data, exchange e-mail, and 
publish papers and preprints.  Especially attractive is the fact 
that this article covers a wide variety of network ingissues 
without missing the details. - DR

Dern, Daniel P. "Leveraging the Internet: Counterpoint Uses 
Popular Internet Gopher, WAIS, and Internet Navigator/Search 
Tools for Value-Added Delivery and Access to Daily U.S. 
Government Federal Register, Commerce Business Daily 
Information" Internet World 4(3) (April 1993):4-5.  Dern 
describes one of the few commercial services to appear on the 
net that actually uses the network to add value to its product.  
Using data created by the federal government, Counterpoint 
Publishing has begun publishing the Federal Register and Commerce 
Business Daily using a number of Internet tools.  The combination 
of speed of access, ease of access, and world-wide availability 
makes this service especially attractive to many customers. - DR

EARN Association.  Guide to Network Resource Tools.  May 3, 1993.  
Available via e-mail from LISTSERV@EARNCC.BITNET by sending the 
command "GET filename", where the filename is either NETTOOLS PS 
[for PostScript] or NETTOOLS MEMO [for plain text].  EARN, the 
European networking agency, has compiled an excellent manual 
describing network resource tools.  Each tool is described in 
detail in terms of what it is, who can use it, and how it is 
used.  The instructions are clear, and the list of commands for 
each system is really helpful.  It would be nice to see a few 
more examples of some of the commands and parameters, but on the 
whole, this is an excellent document.  The tools covered are: 
Gopher, World-Wide Web, WAIS, ASTRA, archie, WHOIS, NETSERV, 
TRICKLE, BITFTP (e-mail-based ftp), and NetNews. - DR

EFFector Online 5(8) (May 14, 1993).  This issue of the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation's newsletter is devoted to recent 
discussions of the Clipper Chip digital encryption proposal.

questions sent to President Clinton about the proposal from the 
Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (major computer 
companies, the EFF, CPSR, and ACLU), excerpts from the testimony 
of Whitfield Diffie, the father of American cryptography, before 
the House Subcommittee on Science, and a request for public 
comment on the proposal by the National Institute of St

Gibbons, John H. "J. H. Gibbons Testimony on Information 
Infrastructure" Posted on Clinton-News-Distribution@
campaign92.org (April 27, 1993).  Gibbons, the Director of the 
Office of Science and Technology Policy, offers testimony 
(excerpted here) in support of the High Performance Computing 
and High Speed Networking Applications Act of 1993 (HR1757), to 
the House committee on Science, Space, and Technology.  This 
testimony goes over in quite a bit of detail the current state 
of government efforts in high-performance computing, as well as 
the Clinton-Gore administration's position.  Gibbons notes with 
satisfaction that this latest bill places "additional emphasis 
on the development of applications technology for manufacturing, 
health care, education, libraries, and other sectors of the 
economy.  It also authorizes additional Federal funding for 
connecting schools and non-profit organizations to high-speed 
networks." - DR

"Initial EFF Analysis of Clinton Privacy and Security Proposal" 
EFFector Online 5(6) (April 16, 1993).  The Electronic Frontier 
Foundation outlines three areas of concern over the recently 
announced Clipper Chip proposal for an encryption standard.  
First is that there has been no public discussion or comment on 
the proposal before the decision was made; second, the algorithm 
has not undergone rigorous testing in the open, unclassified 
arena and may have a hidden back door; the constitutional and 
other legal ramifications of the split-key, dual escrowed system 
have not been fully explained or explored. - DR

Internet World 4(3) (April 1993). Special section on the Internet
in Britain.  The focus of this issue is the British perspective
on internetworking: a general overview, commercial, and academic
services.

o	Dern, Daniel P. "PIPEX: Commercial Internet Service in 
the United Kingdom," pp. 12-14.  The founders of PIPEX describe, 
in an interview, their experience with the start up of a 
commercial Internet service provider in the UK.  Providing full 
Internet service and network consulting services, they have 
experienced unparalleled growth since their start and expect to 
stay competitive by maintaining leading edge technology and 
standards compliance.

o	Ingram, Darren P. "An Overview of Internet Services in 
the United Kingdom," pp. 9-11.  While Internet service in the 
UK is not nearly as well developed as it is in the US, there are 
signs of real progress.  And even now, service in Britain is so 
superior to that of the Continent, that many users there dial up 
to British providers for their Internet access!  Included is a 
sidebar listing both service providers and contact information.

o	Stone, Peter. "A Library-Oriented Overview of JANET," pp.
14-16.  Stone offers an overview of the history and development 
of the Joint Academic Network which has connected institutions of 
higher learning to each other and to the Internet.  Also included 
is a list of some of the services available via JANET. - DR

Kambitsch, Tim, et al. "Trip Notes From Internet Gopher 93 
Conference" posted in two parts on PACS-L@UHUPVM1.BITNET (April 
13, 1993).  Kambitsch and other participants in the recent Gopher 
Conference at the University of Minnesota describe the 
proceedings.  Topics included: the growth of Gopher, Gopher+ 
development, Gopher clients on various platforms, Veronica, 
subject-oriented Gophers, the issue of sensible organization of 
data on a Gopher, and the use of back-end databases with Gopher.

Kessler, Jack. "Baby Bell Libraries? An Update" CD-ROM 
Professional 6(2) (March 1993):26-29.  Kessler poses the 
networked information question of 1993 as "not so much whether, 
or when, but precisely how the Baby Bell giants [RBOCs] will 
become involved in information and, yes, in library work." 
Kessler invisions a three-tier structure of the Baby Bells, 
network nodes, and information marketers (ideally including 
librarians) to assume responsibility for implementing the new 
national network. Oddly, though, Kessler does not mention either
long distance carriers nor ISDN services.  The need for 
interaction between each of the tiers is emphasized. - TR
 
Lagan, Bernard and Anne Davies. "New Digital Phones on Line 
Despite Objections" Sydney Morning Herald (April 28, 1993) 
[as posted on CPSR@GWUVM.BITNET].  Lagan and Davies report that 
the Australian Federal government has decided to allow two phone 
companies to market very secure digital cellular phones.  This 
comes over the objections of law enforcement officials [the same 
objections the FBI and NSA have in the US] who want access to the 
data.  With the new system, it could take two years to complete a 
"wire" tap.  The Government made this move to avoid crippling the 
digital cellular industry. - DR

Levy, Steven. "Crypto Rebels" Wired 1(2) (May/June 1993):54- 61.  
Levy describes a meeting of cypherpunks, those who write 
cryptographic code as freeware for the purpose of protecting the 
privacy communications.  There are other players in the 
cryptography game, the NSA, the FBI, RSA Data Security, the 
company that has patented public-key cryptography, and Pretty 
Good Privacy, a freeware company that has distributed a public-
key program on the network.  Levy covers the interrelationships 
between these parties and the history of cryptography in the US.

Malamud, Carl. "Internet Talk Radio" ConneXions 7(3) (March 
1993):28-31.  Malamud describes his pioneering Internet sound 
file "radio" program that began appearing on the net as a 
monthly program in April.  The sound file is playable on a 
number of platforms (a conversion utility may be required) and 
consists of half-hour programs (15 MB of data) with conference 
presentations, interviews, speeches, and essays.  The flagship 
segment is the Geek of the Week series comprised of interviews 
with network techies.  The file will be available via anonymous 
ftp and broadcast on some networks.  Listen for more info on this 
new development in network news. - DR

Marks, Kenneth and Steven Nielsen "The Networked Local Library: 
Developing the Vision Thing" CWIS Campus-Wide Information Systems 
10(2) (March/April 1993):26-31.  Using the occasion of the 
implementation of a locally-networked library (i.e. client-server 
computing within the organization as well as access to the 
Internet), Marks and Nielsen describe their vision of the library 
of the future.  While not far fetched, this vision is quite 
interesting, and takes into consideration the development of, 
among other things, multimedia resources, wireless networks, and 
the notion of one stop shopping in an effort to be client/patron 
friendly. - DR

Mulliner, Kent. "Southeast Asia Collections and Resources on the 
Internet" originally appeared in CORMOSEA Bulletin 21(2) 
(December 1992):1-5, version 2.51 (April 13, 1993) available by 
sending the following message to LISTSERV@MSU.BITNET, "GET 
MULLINER CORMOSEA".  Mulliner provides an interesting list of 
networked resources in the area of South Asian studies.  Included 
are library catalogs, a Singaporean Gopher, and other resources.  
There is a brief introduction to networked services, as well as a 
helpful glossary of some networking and computer terms. - DR

"NREN Applications Bill Summarized" ALAWON 2(18) (May 10, 1993).  
Available from the list server LISTSERV@UICVM.BITNET (send the 
message "send ala-wo filelist" to the LISTSERV).  The latest NREN 
legislation (HR 1757, introduced by Rick Boucher and strongly 
endorsed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation), authorizes, 
among other things, appropriations for a number of applications: 
Internet connections and training for the education, library, and 
state and local government communities; test-bed projects for new 
technologies; and government document depositories and a federal 
information locator system. - DR

Saffo, Paul. "Hot New Medium: Text" Wired 1(2) (May/June 1993):
48.  Saffo says that new technologies are not making text 
obsolete, but rather freeing the medium from the paper ball and 
chain.  The ease of publishing in the electronic medium means 
that more people than ever are forging ahead and publishing on 
the net.  For those concerned that images might replace text, 
Saffo offers a palliative: as images become manipulable through 
multi-media technologies, "Text will emerge as a primary 
indicator of trustworthiness...." - DR

Sobel, David L. "New NIST/NSA Revelations" posted on CPSR@
GWUVM.BITNET (May 6, 1993).  Documents released, though heavily 
censored, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by 
the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility indicate the 
government's digital signature standard (DSS) was designed by the 
National Security Agency (NSA), rather than the National 
Institute for Standards Technology as directed by Congress.  The 
main concern is that the NSA's involvement is the reason that DSS 
was chosen over RSA (see Levy above) because is it less secure 
and that the same is true for the Clipper Chip proposal.  [CPSR 
has filed a brief in an FOIA lawsuit in federal court on this 
subject, the text of which is available for anonymous ftp at 
cpsr.org, filename cpsr/crypto/dss.brief.5.93.txt.] - DR
     
Wilson Library Bulletin 67(7) (March 1993).  Section on the 
Z39.50 information search and retrieval protocol. 

o	Anderson, Eric. "Concerning Bibliographic Sincerity," pp. 
46-48.  While Anderson focuses on bibliographic standards here, 
his argument is relevant to the standards issue at large: simpler 
standards will be more wide-spread, and therefore more useful.  
Information professionals should not forget that standards are 
created for their own sake, but to be used.

o	Harris, Patricia. "The Standards Matrix: Developers, 
Users, Vendors: Introduction," pp. 33-34, 117.  Harris provides 
an introduction to both the standard and the articles that follow 
in the section.

o	Lynch, Clifford. "Interoperability: The Standards 
Challenge for the 1990s," pp. 38-42.  Lynch takes a step back 
and looks at networking and information standards from the 
broader perspective, and reminds us that, "standards are not the 
goals, but rather are the tools for interoperability among 
systems."  Lynch also describes the ways that standards become 
standards, and how international standards (like OSI-see below) 
tend to fail as tools by their very diplomatic nature, whereas 
the de facto standards (like TCP/IP) end up being much more 
useful.  In the end, Lynch asks that we make pragmatic decisions 
based on true, demonstrable interoperability rather than 
"politically or philosophically correct" notions of such.

o	McCallum, Sally. "Information Technology Standards: 
Implementation, Maintenance, and Coordination," pp. 43-45, 117-
118.  Using the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol as a 
model, McCallum describes the "principle stages and the 
activities necessary in each stage to keep technical standards 
useful."  One of the more salient conclusions McCallum arrives at 
is that, "Applications standards should be developed and managed 
by application-oriented technicians."

o	Michael, James. "Developing a Standard Vision," pp. 35-
37, 117.  Michael, Corporate Director for Standards at Data 
Research Associates, argues that, "Librarians should...understand 
the social and technological factors that have led to the need 
for these [information retrieval] standards."  To force standards 
development forward, librarians and vendors must work together.

Desmarais, Norman. "CD-ROM Market Study" CD-ROM World 8(4) (May 
1993):59-61.  Desmarais presents the results of UMI's annual
market survey of the CD-ROM industry.  Key findings of the study 
include: database licensing or tape leasing will increase nearly 
threefold in academic research libraries (ARLs) between 1991 and 
1994; while less than a third of ARLs had networks in place in 
1991, almost all expect to by 1994; use of CD-ROM products 
within academic and public libraries is extremely high, ranging 
from a minimum of 69% in public libraries to 99% in academic 
libraries. - TR
 
Desmarais, Norman. "Compton's NewMedia Introduces Multiple 
Operation System Technology (MOST)" CD-ROM World 8(4) (May 1993):
54-57.  Desmarais describes the Compton's NewMedia development 
called Multiple Operation System Technology (MOST).  MOST was 
designed to eliminate one of the major obstacles preventing 
widespread acceptance of CD-ROM-based software--incompatibility 
of formats on a variety of hardware platforms.  MOST will allow 
the same CD-ROM disc to operate on a variety of platforms 
including DOS, Windows, Macintosh, and Sony's new multimedia 
player format, MMCD. - TR
