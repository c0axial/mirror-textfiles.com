  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING

   Chapman, Stephen and Anne R. Kenney. "Digital Conversion of Library
   Research Materials" D-Lib Magazine (October 1996)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october96/cornell/10chapman.html) -- Chapman
   and Kenney make a case for a "full informational capture" approach to
   digital conversion of library materials. They assert that only
   retaining all significant information from the original will suffice
   as delivery technologies improve. This does not always mean scanning
   at the highest possible resolutions, but at a resolution that is
   adequate to capture all significant information present in the
   original. Practical considerations such as the amount of staff time it
   would take to adequately evaluate each item to be scanned and the
   storage space required for high-quality images are barely mentioned.
   But nonetheless the article is useful to anyone trying to decide what
   comprises an adequate digital surrogate. -- RT

   Harter, Stephen P. and Hak Joon Kim. "Accessing Electronic Journals
   and Other E-publications: An Empirical Study" College & Research
   Libraries 57(5) (September 1996): 440-456. -- While much has been
   written about the potential of the electronic journal to revolutionize
   traditional scholarly communication, this article reports on an
   empirical study of existing e-journals and describes some of the
   practical problems associated with electronic publishing. Reliable
   access is critical if electronic journals are to succeed as a means of
   scholarly communication. Some of the factors that have contributed to
   lowered rates of access to e-journals are: directory information that
   is inaccurate and out-of-date; the need for special software or
   hardware in order to view various formats (such as DVI, MPEG and
   QuickTime); and electronic publishers who do not produce complete
   archives of back issues. These problems, along with the others cited
   in this study, suggest that there is a role that libraries can play in
   helping to solve them. For instance, just as libraries subscribe to
   print journals because individuals may not be able to afford to or
   because it would be impractical to subscribe to so many, libraries can
   provide the appropriate equipment and software for accessing and
   printing e-journals and manipulating related files. This is a
   thoughtful and thorough article that brings up many important issues
   about the access of e-journals while at the same time acknowledging
   that e-journals are still very much in the early stages of
   development. -- MP

  NETWORKS AND NETWORKING

   Banta, Glen. "Internet Pipe Schemes" Internet World 8(10) (October
   1996):62-70. [http://www.internetworld.com/1996/10/schemes.html] --
   Have you ever felt a vague unease that you should have at least a clue
   what ISDN, ATM, ADSL, SONET, and Frame Relay are? If not, blast on.
   This article isn't for you. But if you have a hankerin' to know what
   this alphabet soup means to your bandwidth and what you can accomplish
   with it, then stay tuned. Banta gives a straight-ahead explanation of
   various networking technologies and a peek into our bandwidth future.
   Now if it were only as simple as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)...

   Bollag, Burton. "In Western Europe, Twelve Institutions See the
   Internet and Videoconferences as Keys to Virtual University" Chronicle
   of Higher Education XLIII (5) (September 27, 1996): 35-36. -- Danish
   and Swedish academics are experimenting with Internet-based education
   that would cross international borders. In addition to standard,
   Web-based applications, they are exploring interactive "technologies
   of collaboration" to improve faculty- student relationships over long
   distances and avoid duplication in programs. Library and information
   science is already being offered over this network. Similarities
   between Danish and Swedish make collaboration much easier to manage.

   Brandt, D. Scott. "Relevancy and Searching the Internet" Computers in
   Libraries 16(8) (September 1996): 35-39. -- This article discusses
   precision vs. recall and results ranking in various types of Internet
   resources. When searching the Internet, it is important to understand
   what various starting points are likely to return. The large
   comprehensive databases such as AltaVista
   (http://altavista.digital.com/) put more burden on the user, returning
   many hits with less precision - boolean operators can help refine
   results. Starting with subject-based indices (Yahoo -
   http://www.yahoo.com/ or The Argus Clearinghouse -
   http://www.clearinghouse.net/) will narrow the field and return fewer
   hits, but with greater precision. Brandt stresses the importance of a
   critical eye and an item by item review of search results. -- CJC

   DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Thirty-four Universities Seek to Create a
   Network for Higher Education" The Chronicle of Higher Education XLIII
   (7) (October 11, 1996): A29. -- It's been foretold: higher education,
   the principal architect of the Internet, wants a new one for its real
   work. The goals of the new system would be to restore (and increase)
   speed and reliability for scholarly purposes. The new network,
   Internet II, would eventually become available to others who use the
   Internet. Internet II would not replace the Internet but would exist
   side by side with Internet "I". Significantly, Internet II
   participants would be responsible for funding their participation with
   less dependence on government sources. The list of 34 participants is
   a "Who's Who" of land grant and private institutions, which suggests a
   serious commitment. -- TH

   "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Cybernomics" The Economist 340 (7985)
   (September 28-October 4, 1996) Survey of the World Economy Supplement,
   46 pages. -- Although this article is about the economics of
   information and the changing global marketplace, it focuses in depth
   on the impact of networked information on work and life. Along the way
   the editors present a series of essays about how digital media are
   reshaping government policies about information use, ranging from the
   global economy to the emergence of new careers in cyberspace. As
   background reading, librarians will find this supplement interesting
   and informative. -- TH

   Perry, L. Stephen. "American and International Studies: Internet
   Resources" College & Research Libraries News 57(9) (October 1996):
   570. [http://www.ala.org/acrl/resoct.html] -- Area studies, whether
   American or international, share an interdisciplinary approach to
   their areas of inquiry that incorporates history, literature,
   folklore, politics, popular culture, economics, and more. Because of
   the wide range of intellectual inquiry inherent in area studies (not
   to mention the countless areas of the world to be studied), this
   month's C&RL's list of Internet resources is obviously a very
   selective one. The annotations, however, are informative not only
   describing the site but also, in some cases, providing a context for
   the resource as well as a brief evaluation of it. -- MP

   Schuyler, Michael. "Hooking Up to the Big-I Internet" Computers in
   Libraries 16(8) (September 1996): 26-30. -- With more and more
   libraries wanting to be represented on the WWW, Schuyler provides a
   basic outline of the necessary investments (hardware, software and
   education) to get a library connected to the Internet. Included is
   information on equipment, phone lines, Internet service providers and
   a summary of costs for startup and first year of operation. -- CJC

   Stearns, Susan. "The Internet-Enabled Virtual Public Library"
   Computers in Libraries 16(8) (Sept. 1996): 54-57.
   [http://www.infotoday.com/cilmag/sep/library.htm] -- The concept of
   the virtual library as a user-friendly, computer-based, networked set
   of information resources is becoming reality in many public libraries.
   Early implementations were often OPAC-centered, with telnet and gopher
   access. This article features several public library web pages and
   projects which expand the notion of the 'library without walls' beyond
   the online catalog, providing e-mail for patrons, voter and community
   information and user training. Implications of the web-based virtual
   library include the necessity of upgrading hardware and software, as
   well as developing standards for collection development and cataloging
   of online resources and the continuing education of librarians and
   patrons. -- CJC

  EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

   "The Weirdest Computer of All" The Economist 340 (7985) (September
   28-October 4, 1996): 97-99.
   [http://www.economist.com/issue/28-09-96/st4046.html] -- This article
   describes "quantum computing" an experimental type of machine logic
   that might enable computers to move beyond binary processing. Instead
   of running on bits made up of an "on" and "off" switch, quantum
   computers would use "quantum bits," or qubits. Qubits would enable a
   computer to run as many calculations as there are numerical
   combinations, and do it simultaneously: that's 1,024 possible
   combinations, each representing a separate processing cycle.
   Naturally, it's a big speed increase over digital computers, which
   perform one calculation at a time! Possible commercial applications
   may begin to appear as early as 1998. The sticking point is error
   correction, as the "qubit" is based on quantum physics, and can
   represent points on a continuum of values that are between "on" and
   "off". -- TH

  GENERAL

   "Being Digital is Not Enough" The Economist 340 (7985) (September
   28-October 4, 1996): 100.
   [http://www.economist.com/issue/28-09-96/st4047.html] -- Why do new
   digital formats fail? The digital compact cassette was a total bust,
   even though it offers better quality than conventional cassettes. The
   editors suggest that there are two main reasons. First, a new product
   must be ten times better than the one it replaces. This is based on
   the "10X" rule that venture capitalists follow in making investment
   decisions. Second, it must succeed in "alluring" consumers with the
   promise of "modernity"--that is, it must be "cool" enough to make you
   want to trade up from your CD collection. -- TH

   Cisler, Steve. "Weatherproofing a Great, Good Place" American
   Libraries 27(9) (October 1996): 42-46. -- In this wide-ranging and
   entertaining article, Cisler covers a lot of philosophical and
   technical ground relating to public libraries and the challenges they
   face. Chock-full of examples and citations, the article identifies
   storm fronts and suggests how to ride them out. The punchline will
   come as no surprise to those who know Steve and his commitment to the
   values of librarians as well as the technologies (whether they be
   printing presses or computers) that help make them a reality. -- RT
