Expert Systems 
 
Buckland, Michael K. and Doris Florian "Expertise, Task Complexity,  
and Artificial Intelligence: A Conceptual Framework" Journal of the  
American Society for Information Science 42(9) (Oct. 1991):635- 
643.  This interesting and somewhat theoretical article discusses  
the potential value AI might have in the design and use of  
information systems (IS). The authors' model of task complexity  
which relates the user's system expertise with his/her subject  
expertise, makes for a clear explanation of the points in the  
(human/machine) interaction where simplification (and perhaps AI)  
might be introduced to maximize successful IS usage.  The measure  
of machine intelligence (measured pragmatically in terms of the  
number of reliable responses provided rather than requiring it to  
meet the rigors of a philosophical definition) as suggested here puts  
into perspective what is meant in calling a machine "intelligent" and  
also serves as a useful, practical criterion (along with issues of  
cost) for evaluating the utility of machines incorporating AI design.

Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Ang, Peng H., Peter A. Ruetz, and David Auld "Video Compression  
Makes Big Gains" IEEE Spectrum 28(10) (October 1991):16-19.   A  
technical discussion describing video compression of both still and  
moving pictures.  As standards continue to be developed for the  
medium, storage of large sets of images for multimedia applications  
will become easier.  A short bibliography appended to the article  
suggests further readings on the subject. -- MT 
 
Bonomi, Mauro "Multimedia and CD-ROM: An Overview of JPEG, MPEG  
and the Future" CD-ROM Professional 4(6) (November 1991):38-42.    
A thorough review of the process by which standards for multimedia  
are being developed.  Both the Joint Photographic Experts Group  
(JPEG) and the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) are working on  
standardizing compression schemes to improve the use of images in  
multimedia systems.  An example of a co-processor designed to the  
JPEG standards is mentioned. -- MT 
 
Donovan, John W. "Intel/IBM's Audio-Video Kernel" BYTE 16(13)  
(December 1991)177-186.   Hardware continues to makes strides in  
the multimedia world as new products to address the market are  
introduced.  The audio-visual kernal (AVK), a joint effort of Intel and  
IBM, provides a low-level software interface for real-time video and  
audio in multimedia applications.  Incorporating concepts from audio  
and video production studios and compatible with other operating  
systems, the AVK advances the capabilities of desktop multimedia  
systems.  Sidebars on the new Intel/IBM ActionMedia Delivery Board  
and IBM's multimedia platform PS/2 Ultimedia Model M57 SLC  
accompany the article. -- MT 
 
Jorgensen, Corinne and Peter Jorgensen "Citations in Hypermedia:  
Maintaining Critical Links" College and Research Libraries 52(6)  
(November 1991):528-536.   The issue of citations for sources in  
hypermedia systems is addressed in this discussion of  
considerations for the design of those systems.  If designers keep  
the citation issue in mind, they will be able to create hypermedia  
systems that are easier to cite.  A lengthy bibliography points up  
useful related sources in the field as well. -- MT 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
"ALANET to Cease" ALCTS Network News 2(20) (December 9, 1991).   
Given fiscal constraints, and the availability of alternate network  
access, ALANET will cease operations on January 31, 1992.  But, ALA  
"will assist all ALANET subscribers to locate and secure alternate  
services comparable to those provided by ALANET." -- DR 
 
Bailey, Jr., Charles W. and Dana Rooks, eds. "Symposium on the Role  
of Network-Based Electronic Resources in Scholarly Communication  
and Research" Public Access Systems Review 2(1) (1991):4-60.  The  
editors posed five questions to the conference participants relating  
to the roles libraries should "play in creating, collecting, providing  
access to, and supporting network-based electronic resources." --  
DR 
 
Engle, Mary E. "Electronic Paths to Resource Sharing: Widening  
Opportunities Through the Internet" Reference Services Review  
19(4) (Winter 1991):7-12.  Engle investigates the uses and  
procedures for accessing remote information resources using telnet.   
In addition, she uses the experience of the Melvyl( system to  
analyze usage patterns and problems.  There is also a handy section  
entitled "Survival Techniques." -- DR 
 
"High-Performance Computing Act of 1991" Signed December 9,  
1991.  This is the text of the "NREN bill" and is available by sending  
an e-mail message to NIS-INFO@NIS.NSF.NET (35.1.1.48) with no  
subject and the message reading "send nrenbill.txt" or through  
anonymous ftp (password "guest") in the nsfnet directory -- DR 
 
North American Directory Forum "A Naming Scheme for c=US" RFC  
1255 (September 1991) .  This somewhat technical paper describes  
the NADFs agreement on how entries will be named in the public  
portion of the North American Directory in conformance with x.500  
standards.  The purpose of the agreement is to ensure that names are  
both meaningful and unique (available via anonymous ftp from  
nnsc.nsf.net or 128.89.1.178 in directory /rfc as RFC1255.txt). -

Perratore, Ed, et al. "Networking CD-ROMs: the Power of Access" PC  
Magazine 10(22) (December 31, 1991):333-363.  Networking CD- 
ROMs is becoming easier and less expensive as the technology  
improves and licensing restrictions ease.  This is an extensive  
collection of articles of reviews of DOS-based drives, changers,  
towers, LANs, and software. -- DR 
 
Peters, Paul Evans "Summary Report of the Fall 1991 Meeting of the  
CNI Task Force" Posting on CNIDIR-L@UNMVM.BITNET and PACS- 
L@UHUPVM1.BITNET (December 11, 1991).  The Director of the  
Coalition for Networked Information has provided the Internet  
community with excellent notes on the Fall meeting of the  
Coalition's Task Force.  The issues addressed at the meeting include:  
catalyzing the flow of networked information, the perspective of the  
humanities, arts and social sciences, NREN public policy framework,  
and an information policies compilation. -- DR 
 
Weis, Alan and Eric Aupperle "A Letter to the Internet Community..."  
Posting to the com-priv@psi.com Internet discussion on  
commercialization and privatization issues regarding the Internet  
(Dec. 7, 1991).  Advanced Network Services (formed by a partnership  
between IBM, MCI, and Merit), announces a scheme to prevent  
commercial network traffic from traversing the network lines of  
constituent networks that do not wish to carry commercial traffic.  
Also announced is the first major commercial service provider  
offered to the Internet by ANS: Dialog Information Services of Palo  
Alto. -- RT 
 
Wilson, David L. "High Cost Could Deny Big Computer Advance to  
Some Colleges" Chronicle of Higher Education 38(15) (December 4,  
1991):A1, A32.  While advanced computing is becoming the order of  
the day in many libraries and institutions, many smaller  
organizations may not be able to afford the upgrades.  A national  
high-speed computing network has little use for the campus that  
cannot afford to connect to it.  Some argue, however, that priorities  
will shift and the money will be found. -- DR 
 
 
Optical Disc Technologies 
 
Brueggeman, Peter. "Memory Management for CD-ROM Workstations- 
-Part II" CD-ROM Professional 4(6) (November 1991):74-78. In the  
second installment of his series on memory management,  
Brueggeman provides tips on how CD-ROM users can maximize their  
hardware/software investment and more efficiently run their CD- 
ROMs. He discusses memory analyzers, DOS versions, memory  
managers, and network considerations. Also includes an extensive  
products directory. -- TR 
 
Jones, Arnold. "DOS CD-ROMs: Not Just for DOS Computers" CD-ROM  
Professional 4(6) (November 1991):48-50. Jones explains how DOS- 
based CD-ROMs are not restricted to DOS machines.  This article  
demonstrates how DOS CD-ROMs can be used without modification  
under the following operating systems: OS/2, SCO XENIX, SCO UNIX,  
Interactive UNIX, ATT UNIX System V/386, and Novell Netware 386.

Oudard, Denis. "The Evolution of Century Disc Archival Technology"  
CD-ROM Professional 4(6) (November 1991):42-46. After four years  
of research and development, the first archival CD, designed to last  
for at least 100 years, has been released by DIGIPRESS. To overcome  
the physical limitations of conventional plastic discs, all organic  
materials were replaced by minerals and all unstable materials  
were replaced with their most invulnerable "cousins." The new  
technology has been successfully applied to all optical disc formats  
including CD-Audio, CD-ROM, CD-Video, and 30cm Laser Disc. -- TR
