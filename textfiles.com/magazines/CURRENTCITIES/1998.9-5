  Digital Libraries

   Fox, Edward A. and Gary Marchionini. "Toward a Worldwide Digital
   Library" Communications of the ACM 41(4) (April 1998). -- As they have
   done before, (see the April 1995 issue of Current Cites) the
   Communications of the ACM has devoted an issue to the topic of digital
   libraries. Anyone involved in digital library development probably has
   favorite online resources (such as our own Digital Library SunSITE
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/) for diving deep into specific problems,
   but this provides a wide scope in one neat package. To quote from the
   introduction, "This special section is a snapshot of the current state
   of digital library development around the world." The worldwide
   digital library theme has been carried out by including articles which
   focus upon technical, informational and social interoperability across
   national boundaries. The special section is broken up into the
   following categories: Interoperability, Special Types of Digital
   Libraries, Multilingual Support, National Efforts, and Supporting
   Technologies. And there's a related "Legally Speaking" column by
   Pamela Samuelson titled "Encoding the Law into Digital Libraries." As
   always with CACM, the work is scholarly, well-documented and
   foot-noted. -- JR

   Hanson, Terry. "The Access Catalogue Gateway to Resources" Ariadne 15
   (May 1998) [http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue15/main/]. -- Libraries can
   no longer be complacent with merely providing structured access to
   their holdings through their library catalog. Users must also be
   guided to CD-ROM and Internet resources in a way that makes sense and
   that integrates them as much as possible with traditional print
   resources. The typical strategies so far include adding electronic and
   Internet resources to the library catalog or creating a separate and
   parallel catalog to the existing catalog of print materials. Neither
   solution is without its problems. In this article Hanson proposes a
   new kind of access paradigm that subsumes the library catalog of print
   materials beneath an over-arching "Access Catalogue." This catalog
   would provide integrated access to the complete breadth of information
   resources, from which the user could leap off into the one they feel
   is most appropriate to their need -- whether it be the traditional
   library catalog, or a CD-ROM database, or a Web site. A number of us
   have been slouching toward just such a solution, but it is refreshing
   to see it so clearly and openly stated. Although this brief piece is
   hardly more than the statement of an idea, it is nonetheless of
   potentially much greater impact than a longer and more fully
   documented article. Those of us who were using Gopher when Mosaic was
   introduced understand the power of the right idea at the right time.
   Although I don't want to imply that Hanson's model is as potentially
   powerful, I do think it is well worth heeding. -- RT

   Jensen, Ann. "Taking Local Resources Global: The NCSTRL Experience at
   UC Berkeley Library" Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship 18
   (Spring 1998)
   [http://www.library.ucsb.edu/istl/98-spring/article1.html]. -- This
   piece is a straightforward report on a library project to take over
   the management of a repository of computer science technical reports
   from a computer science department that had participated in a
   ground-breaking digital library project called NCSTRL. Although the
   topic may not be as "sexy" as other digital library projects -- being
   based on technology that has existed for years -- it nonetheless is an
   example of the kind of digital library function that should be a
   library's bread-and-butter -- providing long-term, structured, and
   usable access to useful information. -- RT

   Kelly, Brian. RDF Tools Briefing Sheet (May 1998)
   [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/seminars/what-is-rdf-may1998/
   rdf-briefi ng.html]. -- This summary sheet on RDF tools and resources
   is extremely helpful for anyone interesting in the Resource
   Description Framework, or RDF. RDF is an emerging standard for
   encoding metadata using XML syntax. RDF is likely to be an important
   standard for anyone creating, exchanging, or using metadata. This
   document is extremely up-to-date as of this writing, but as Kelly
   wisely notes, this is a "very volatile area." It is available in Adobe
   Acrobat, Word 97, and HTML formats. Our readers in the U.S. should
   select the option "shrink to fit" when printing it from Adobe Acrobat,
   as it is formatted for A4 paper. It is also designed to be distributed
   as a one-page, back-to-back, folded handout. You would be hard-pressed
   to find any better RDF summary sheet than this. -- RT

   Kelly, Brian. What is XML? Ariadne 15 (May 1998)
   [http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue15/what-is/]. -- The question posed by
   the article title is on the lips of many individuals these days, and
   will be pondered by even more in the days to come. Kelly's piece,
   written in the question-and-answer format popularized by net
   "Frequently Asked Questions" documents (FAQs), is aimed at answering
   only the most basic questions about XML. However, those who know a bit
   more than the basics may be pleasantly surprised by up-to-date
   pointers to some interesting papers from the Seventh International
   World Wide Web Conference. -- RT

   Miller, Eric. "An Introduction to the Resource Description Framework"
   D-Lib Magazine (May 1998)
   [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may98/miller/05miller.html]. -- Let's not
   mince words. The Resource Description Framework, or RDF, is not for
   the faint of heart. Anyone who has difficulty with the concept of
   _labeled directed graphs_, yours truly included, will find themselves
   wishing they had a dentist's appointment they could rush off to when
   confronted with RDF syntax. But surely, you think, this preamble is
   leading up to something more engaging than having one's teeth pulled,
   right? Right. There _is_ a reason to endure such pain. If you've ever
   wished for a mechanism by which you could encode, exchange, and use
   structured metadata on the Web, then here it is. RDF is an emerging
   solution to a variety of problems, from "cataloging" Web pages to
   providing browsing of a Web site hierarchy and more. So pull up an
   armchair, lean back, and open wide. The doctor is "in." -- RT

   Stepanek, Marcia. "From Digits to Dust" Businessweek 3574 (April 20,
   1998): 128. -- Librarians will be shocked! Shocked! To learn that
   digital preservation is a vital issue. This article covers the growing
   awareness among technology managers that digital information, much of
   will never appear on paper, is subject to decay and degradation. In
   many cases, the actual life span of CD-ROMs and other formats are no
   longer than the life span of paper copies, despite the fact digital
   copies are far more expensive to develop. Although this article is
   very well written and informative, it falls into a very common trap of
   business writers: a lack of research on the preservation initiatives
   that originate in the library world. Maybe if digital preservation
   values and strategies of librarians were more widely known, we
   wouldn't be in such a pickle. This article makes it abundantly clear
   that consideration of preservation issues must be folded into the
   design process for digital formats. -- TH

   Donovan, Kevin. "The Promise of the FlashPix Image File Format" RLG
   DigiNews 2(2) (April 15, 1998)
   [http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews22.html#FlashPix]. -- One
   of the critical questions at the moment for anyone doing serious image
   work on the Web is what the next image format will be. It's clear that
   the ubiquitous formats of GIF (Compuserve's Graphic Interchange
   Format) and JPEG (the Joint Photographic Engineers Group
   specification) are sufficient for providing Web eye candy, but they
   are clearly deficient for serving high-resolution images. The problem
   is that there is no clear winner among several competing formats.
   FlashPix is one of these formats, and this article does a decent job
   of explaining what it is all about. Can you implement it and be
   certain it will be the format of the future? Perhaps, perhaps not. But
   with Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Live Picture, Inc., and Microsoft
   behind it, you can't count it out either. At least with the help of
   this article you will know about about your options. -- RT

   Gulick, Rebecca. "Adobe Proposes PGML as Web Image Standard" MacWeek
   12(15) (April 20, 1998): 1,8 -- Adobe, along with Netscape, IBM, and
   other supporters proposed PGML as the new standard for vector-based
   images for the Web to the W3C. Vector-based images are not defined as
   a fixed set of pixels, but rather as algorithims. One of their
   benefits is that a Web site could host a very high-resolution
   vector-based image, which when delivered by the intelligent Web server
   gets "dumbed down" into a lower-resolution image for the browser for
   speed, but the end-user could "zoom" in on the image and request
   higher and higher resolutions from the server. This would obviously
   enable many uses for which the Web is now impractical, and could
   greatly reduce the storage and mangement problems of multiple versions
   of image files. PGML is not the only standard being proposed, but the
   move toward vector-based images in general should be watched closely.

   based standard for multimedia. the Synchronized Multimedia Integration
   Language (or SMIL; thanks Timothy Leary 8-) ) is an XML-based language
   for integrating multimedia (audio, video, images) on the Web. Full
   approval is pending and the SMIL specification can be found at

   Platt, Nina. "GPO Access - Government At Its Best?" Database 21 (2)
   (April/May 1998): 41-43. -- If you've ever been frustrated by trying
   to locate U.S. government information you may be pleased to read Nina
   Platt's review of recent improvements to GPO Access
   [http://www.access.gpo.gov/], the U.S. Government Printing Office's
   electronic directory of Federal Government information. GPO Access
   includes government information databases (such as The Federal
   Register and The Code of Federal Regulation), individual Federal
   agency files from the Federal Bulletin Board and tools for finding
   government information. GPO Access also provides multiple access
   options and general and specialized search pages. Platt acknowledges
   that GPO Access has been available since 1994, but only recently has
   begun to live up to its promise, by adding more resources and
   simplifying the search process. -- LY

   Proceedings of the 7th International World Wide Web Conference,
   Brisbane, Australia April 14-18, 1998
   [http://www7.conf.au/programme/fullprog.html]. -- The International
   WWW Conference is the Web conference for academics and researchers.
   Unlike conferences such as Internet World or Interop, you won't be
   bumping into too many suits in the halls. This is both good and bad,
   if you're of a practical bent. If you're looking for Web solutions you
   can implement today, you will find few of them here. But if you want
   to know where the Web may be heading, discover what technical
   possibilities there are, and sample some cutting-edge solutions to Web
   problems, this is the place. You will likely find that many of the
   papers are of limited interest, but even if you find only one or two
   that expands your knowledge about what is possible on the Web, it will
   be worth a visit. My guess is you will. -- RT

   Udell, Jon. "Effective HTML Forms" BYTE 23(5) (May 1998): 103-106
   [http://www.byte.com/art/9805/sec7/art1.htm]. -- I don't normally cite
   individual articles on creating Web documents, but this one has such
   great advice about a Web structure that is so often done poorly, I
   couldn't help myself. Udell, who doubles as the BYTE Web manager, not
   only targets the markup with comments like "Mark required elements"
   and "Use layout and visual cues to organize elements" (he gives
   examples), but also the programs that will process the input: "Accept
   all unambiguous inputs" (for example, (XXX) XXX-XXX or XXX-XXX-XXXX
   for phone numbers) and "Use short error messages linked to longer
   explanations." By the way, it's not absolutely necessary, but it will
   help a lot if you know a little Perl, or at least some programming
   language. -- RT

  Optical Disc Technology

   Herther, Nancy K. "CD-ROM to DVD-ROM: Moving Optical Storage Along a
   Bumpy Road into the New Century" Database 21 (2) (April/May 1998):
   26-36. -- Will the deployment of DVD technology benefit from the
   CD-ROM learning curve? This is the question that Nancy Herther
   discusses in this overview of the optical storage industry. DVD is the
   next generation high density compact disc. While CD-ROMs can store
   about 650MB of data or music, DVD discs can store between 4.7 GB to 17
   GB - enough for more than a full-length MPEG-2 compressed motion
   picture. DVD, if successful, will eventually replace videotapes,
   laserdiscs, CD-Audio, CD-ROMs and other video game formats. After
   interviewing over 35 industry participants and experts, Herther
   concludes that this will depend on the resolution of remaining
   standards issues, Win98 support for DVD, the number of available DVD
   titles and backward compatibility with current CDs (DVD and DVD-ROM
   players must be able to play today's current CDs). She also provides a
   brief history of the CD-ROM industry, a helpful summary of the the
   various CD and DVD formats (including recordable) and an extensive
   list of Web resources for additional background information. -- LY
