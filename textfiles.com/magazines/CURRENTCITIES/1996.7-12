DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Journal Articles Dating Back as Far as 
a Century are Being Put On Line" Chronicle of Higher Education 
43(15) (December 6, 1996):A30-A32. -- This articles traces the 
development of the ambitious JSTOR program for digitizing 
journals from its earliest inception. As the brainchild of Mellon 
Foundation president William G. Bowen, JSTOR enjoyed long-term 
foundation support, and now has separate offices and its own 
board of trustees. JSTOR utilizes a World Wide Web interface, 
but allows scholars to view pages exactly as they appear in print. 
Although startup costs for participants constitute another 
financial challenge for research libraries, the release of "prime 
space for prime journals" is a tempting and much-needed benefit of 
the program. Moreover, JSTOR's information scientists believe that 
the system will allow libraries to build stronger links with 
faculty users and realize savings on costly microfilm and 
microfiche collection programs. -- TH

Guha, R.V. "Meta Content Format" 
(http://hotsauce.apple.com/text/mcf.html)
-- Meta Content Format (MCF) is a proposed language from Apple 
Computer for representing meta content (see next cite). This white 
paper on MCF specifically mentions that MCF might be one way of 
implementing the Dublin Core in computer programs. MCF is also 
being submitted to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) 
for adoption as a standard.  A related
(http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-355.html#1nk3) article 
on MCF was published in the electronic journal for Macs, Tidbits.

Weibel, Stuart & Jean Godby, Eric Miller, Ron Daniel. "OCLC/NCSA 
Metadata Workshop Report" (http://www.oclc.org:5046/conferences/
metadata/dublin_core_report.html) -- Meta content is information 
_about_ content that might exist in a web page, web site, 
unstructured text file or highly structured database. Meta
content has recently entered the world of HTML web pages in the 
form of META tags, which can contain information about a web page, 
such as it's creator, copyright info, or an index of keywords 
representing the page's content. Also significant for the academic, 
library, and cultural information sectors has been the development 
of the Dublin Core, a proposed set of core elements for 
representing meta-data about digital content that might exist as 
an image file, database, individual record, etc. Meta-data will 
allow these digital resources themselves to be cataloged and 
searched (particularly across the Internet) more easily regardless 
of their particular format or structure. This paper is the report 
from the workshop sponsored by OCLC and NCSA to develop the Dublin 
Core. The area of meta content and how it will be represented and 
implemented with have far reaching implications for anyone involved 
in the creation, management, or access of information in digital 
forms, making this report a recommended read. -- RR
 

MULTIMEDIA AND HYPERMEDIA

"RTSP is a Proposed Standard for Delivery of Real-Time Media Over 
the Internet and Intranets"
(http://home.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease263.html) 
-- RSTP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is a new proposed standard 
for delivering audio, video, animation, and other time-based 
multimedia over the Internet. This article is a short press 
announcement of the new proposal, but contains enough detail to be 
useful as an introduction. The proposal, which is supported by
40 industry players, is significant in two ways. First, it would
standardize and facilitate quick cross-platform development of 
tools for delivering multimedia in real time across the Internet. 
A major obstacle to this thus far has been the confusion and 
proliferation of proprietary solutions, many platform bound. 
Second, the proposal is being submitted to the IETF (Internet 
Engineering Task Force) for review and adoption as an open 
standard. The connectivity of the Internet (and probably fear 
of Microsoft) is encouraging the computer industry to work
together to create open standards - which is encouraging news 
indeed for the non-commercial sector since tools can be developed 
as freeware or cheaper commercially, and there will be less 
confusion about which formats are most accessible or archivable. 
There is another short companion article about the relationship of 
RTSP and Microsoft's strategy at the (http://www.inquiry.com/
publication/cmp/CWK/19961028/CWK1996102850121.html) Communications 
Week website. -- RR
 
Ryer, Kelly. "Apple Charts QTML Future" MacWeek 10(45) (November
25, 1996):10, 12 -- QTML does not stand for QuickTime Markup 
Language, thank goodness, but rather QuickTime Media Layer. 
QuickTime is a popular format for the creation of multimedia on 
and off the web. Even though it is possible to playback QuickTime 
files on Windows machines, it was possible to author QT only on 
Macs. Playback of QT variations (QT-VR, QT-3D, etc.) was 
questionable. QTML purports to overcome that limitation to one 
platform which made QT an appealing but limited choice for 
non-commercial media authors who are concerned with maximum 
accessibility and standards-based information. QTML is 
incorporating MPEG and motion JPEG (two standards) as well as 
creating an applications layer interface which will make it
possible to easily create QT programs for authoring and playback 
on multiple platforms. Ease of use and ability to cross platforms 
are major advantages for those in the information access sector 
who need to deal with multimedia. -- RR

Shrage, Michael. "Cultural Currency" 
(http://www.packet.com/schrage) -- This article examines the role 
of non-profit organizations in continuing development of the web, 
using the case study of museums online. While the author is 
perhaps over-hasty to judge that museums in general have made poor 
use of the web, the particular museum web project mentioned as 
worthy is indeed exciting (the Guggenheim sponsorship of 
Internet-based artworks). Overall the article is an encouraging 
argument that while the commercial sector has taken over much 
development of the web, there is still a vital role to be played 
by the non-profit and education sector. -- RR
 

GENERAL

"Books, Bricks and Bytes" Daedalus 125(4) (Fall 1996) Special 
Issue: What is the role of the library in the context of a world 
that is in the midst of making a giant leap from the industrial 
age to the information age? -- In an issue devoted entirely to
libraries, Daedalus ponders the many implications of the digital 
library. Whether you are a librarian, a scholar, a publisher or a 
concerned citizen -- in other words if you are a member of a 
community served by a library: that is, if are a member of the 
public -- this special issue covers the entire scope of questions 
confronting the library community of the late 20th century. Among 
the topics covered are: the National Information Infrastructure 
and all that it implies about intellectual property, fair use and 
electronic publishing ("What is a Digital Library? Technology, 
Intellectual Property, and the Public Interest" by Peter Lyman and 
"Buy or Lease? Two Models for Scholarly Information at the End
(or the Beginning) of an Era" by Ann Okerson); the changing nature 
of the library profession ("A Library Historian Looks at 
Librarianship" by Kenneth Carpenter and "Librarianship: A Changing 
Profession" by Peter Young); the role of libraries in shaping 
communities both here in the United States ("Redefining Community 
the Public Library" by Deanna Marcum) and abroad ("Problems of 
Russian Libraries in an Age of Social Change" and "The Story of 
Libraries in India"); libraries as buildings ("Bricks and Bytes: 
Libraries in Flux"); the history of libraries ("The History of the 
French National Library") and the future of libraries ("The 
Centrality of Communities to the Future of Major Public Libraries"
by Kenneth Dowlin and Eleanor Shapiro and "American Public 
Libraries: A Long Transformative Moment" by Susan Kent Goldberg). 
There are nineteen articles in all, more than can be summarized in 
this far-too-brief cite. -- MP

_Buildings, Books, and Bytes: Libraries and Communities in the 
Digital Age_. Washington, DC: Benton Foundation, November 1996.
(http://www.benton.org/Kellogg/buildings.html) -- Anyone involved 
with a library should read this report. Luckily, many of them 
have already received it. The American Library Association teamed 
up with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (which funded the report) to 
mail it out to 20,000 ALA members in leadership positions. The rest 
of us can simply visit the Web site to read it. The purpose of the 
report is to discover "where the public supports -- or fails to 
support -- libraries as they confront the digital world." We may 
not always like what we read, but we need to read it. -- RT
