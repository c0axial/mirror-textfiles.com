Electronic Publishing
 
Kelley, Wayne P. "GPO's Vision for Access to Government
Information in the Electronic Age" Electronic Networking 2(2)
(Summer 1992):50-55.  Kelley, the Superintendent of Documents
of the GPO, makes the case for the GPO to act as a central
publisher of electronic information from all government
departments and distribute those publications through the Federal
Depository Library Program.  He says that the current state of
disarray "makes obtaining government publications increasingly
more difficult for even the well informed." - DR

 
Hyper- and Multimedia

Computer Communication Review 22(3) (July 1992) includes 
abstracts from the papers presented at the IEEE Multimedia '92
workshop held in Monterey, California in early April. A brief
sampler:
 
o	Hoshi, Tohru, Yasuhiro Takahashi and Kenjiro Mori "An
Integrated Multimedia Desktop Communication and Collaboration
Platform for Broadband ISDN: The Broadband ISDN Group Tele-
Working System" pp.14-15.  The high-speed capabilities of 
broadband ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) are combined
with the concept of computer supported cooperative work to make
powerful tools for distributed multimedia applications.  Projects
of this kind demonstrate the potential for visual telephony and
collaborative work on images to extend multimedia across networks.
 
o	Polyzos, George C. "Networking for Sequoia 2000" pp.41-42.
An ambitious project in the study of global change sponsored by
DEC and several campuses of the University of California, Sequoia
2000 addresses some of the "Grand Challenges" of computing in its
development of distributed multimedia applications.  An enormous
database of earth science information will be made available to
researchers via the network for collaborative multimedia work.  
Many of the other abstracts focus on specific issues of networked
multimedia such as:  synchronization and control techniques;
traffic patterns and bandwidth allocation; experimental systems;
and distributed multimedia collaboration. - MT
 
Pournelle, Jerry "Multimedia Medley"  BYTE 17(8) (August 1992):
95-110.  A myriad of multimedia products receive mention in this
user's column which offers tips on installation and startup of
various devices.  The Miracle Piano Teaching System, Corel
Blockbuster CD-ROM, Tandy's 4033 LX machine, and a simulation
program for the Mac, VisSim are among the products installed,
tested and briefly reviewed by the author. - MT
 
Rangan, P. Venkat, et al. "Designing an On-Demand Multimedia
Service"  IEEE Communications Magazine 30(7) (July 1992):56-64.
Employing the analogy of a video rental outlet, the authors
suggest that delivery of multimedia services to end-users may
be only a few years away.  Issues of synchronization and
continuous transmission for such services are the focus of this
technical article, which also proposes an architecture for
on-demand multimedia. - MT
 

Information Transfer

Haycox, Jamie L. "Guide to Imaging Hardware and Software" ASIS
Bulletin 18(5) (June 1992):13-14. In this article Haycox
provides a guide and checklist to aid in the selection of
imaging hardware and software.  Aspects to take into
consideration include the type or types of images to be
processed (eg., fax, document, video) and volume. - VR 
 
Lundeen, Gerald W. and Carol Tenopir "Text Retrieval Software
for Microcomputers and Beyond:  An Overview and a Review of
Four Packages" Database 15(4) (August 1992):51-63.  Text
retrieval software is the logical companion to machine readable
text.  In this article four packages, Concordance, Concept
Finder, Personal Librarian, and Topic, are evaluated on
maintenance, search and retrieval capabilities, output, and
documentation. - VR 
 
Mallen, Ed "Intelligent Character Recognition: It's Not Just 
Recognition Anymore" ASIS Bulletin 18(5) (June 1992):9-11.  
Though Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been around since
1912, Mallen makes the point that OCR on its own is not a viable
technology.  It is the Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)
system that will increase the utility of a scanned document by
allowing for more effective conversion and retrieval of
documents. - VR
 
Sun, Wei, et al. "Intelligent OCR Processing" JASIS 43(6) (July
1992):422-431.  The authors discuss the problems of unrecognized
characters in text scanned with Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) technology, and propose a postprocessing strategy to
correct textual errors with minimum human intervention. - VR

Van Overbeek, Thomas T. "Creating a Good Image: Selecting
Displays for Document Image Processing" ASIS Bulletin 18(5)
(June 1992):11-12.  Van Overbeek describes the issues in
document image processing and the importance of effective
displays of scanned images.  He is partial to paper-like
displays which "allow users to read documents faster and with
less fatigue...." - VR


Networks and Networking
 
Blau, Andrew "Getting a Handle on the Future of the NSFNet"
EFFector Online 3(2) (August 19, 1992).  Available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.eff.org.  Blau reports on the July 23
meeting of the Communications Policy Forum of the EFF
which included members of the National Science Foundation. 
Up for discussion was the NSF proposal to establish a two-
tiered network: a very high speed backbone (vBNS) connecting
to a system of network access points (NAPs).  Traffic on the
vBNS would be restricted to research and education while traffic
on the NAPs would be unrestricted in content. - DR
 
Casner, Stephen and Stephen Deering "First IETF Internet
Audiocast" Computer Communication Review 22(3) (July 1992):92-97.
This articles covers the successes and pitfalls of sending a live
audiocast over the Internet.  Using packet audio technology
(where the audio data is sent in small packets and reassembled
by the recipient) the Internet Engineering Task Force was able
to provide two-way communications with four sites spanning the
continent. - DR
 
Electronic Frontier Foundation "Analysis of the FBI Proposal
Regarding Digital Telephony" [September 1992].  Available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.eff.org in directory pub/EFF/legal-issues
as file eff-fbi-analysis.  This white paper explains why this
broad-based coalition headed by the EFF opposes the FBIs
proposed legislation that "actually requires that all
communications and computer systems be designed to facilitate
interception of private messages...." - DR
 
Ford, Warwick and Brian O'Higgins "Public-Key Encryption
and Open Systems Interconnection" IEEE Communications
Magazine 30(7) (July 1992):30-35.  Warwick and O'Higgins
contend that the implementation of public-key encryption at the
network level, along with symmetric cryptography, would
provide the best scheme for "authentication, integrity,
confidentiality, and non-repudiation services in large open
systems networks."  The authors have included an introduction
to data encryption that is detailed, yet understandable. - DR
 
Kovacs, Diane "Survey of E-Conference Users: Summary
Results" posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (August 25, 1992). 
Kovacs and her colleagues conducted a survey of (primarily
library) electronic conference users and how such use has
affected their work.  Not surprisingly, PACS-L is the most
popular.  Fuller results will be appearing in the next few
months. - DR
 
Lynch, Clifford.  Z39.50 in Plain English: A Non-Technical
Guide to the New NISO Standard for Library Automation

development and implementation of the Z39.50 protocol has
written this FAQ (frequently asked questions) pamphlet. 
Without going into technical details, Lynch explains what
Z39.50 is, why it is important, and what progress is being made
in its implementation. - DR
 
Prentiss, Riddle "GopherCon '92: Trip Report" August 17, 1992. 
Posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 in two parts on 9/8/92 by Ed Vielmetti.
"GopherCon '92 was a small working session of Gopher developers
and users.  Focuses included proposed extensions to the Gopher
protocol; how to organize the Internet resources available
through Gopher in a more usable fashion; Gopher server
administration, including security and privacy issues; and the
future of Gopher development."  Although the Con was attended by
only 50 people the effects of the proceedings will be felt by
thousands of users (if not more). - DR

Available via e-mail by sending the message "GET SCOTT
PRV3N4 F=MAIL" to LISTSERV@UHUPVM1 or LISTSERV@UHUPVM1.UH.EDU.
Written by the developer of the software, this article describes
how to use the HYTELNET program to locate and connect to Internet
hosts (automatic connections are currently only available with
the UNIX/VMS implementation).  Scott includes instructions on
how to obtain copies of the IBM-compatible TSR program via
anonymous ftp as well as e-mail addresses for information on
other platform versions. - DR
 
Stanton, Deirdre E. and Todd Hooper "The LIBS Internet Access 
Software: An Overview and Evaluation" Public Access Computer 
Systems Review 3(4) (1992):4-14.  Available via e- mail by 
sending the message "GET STANTON PRV3N4 F=MAIL" to 
LISTSERV@UHUPVM1 or LISTSERV@UHUPVM1.UH.EDU.  This review of the 
LIBS software provides an excellent overview of the software
which allows automated connections to Internet sites of all types
from UNIX or VMS machines.  The article also includes the
technical information for those who wish to mount their own LIBS
servers.  There is also a comparison with HYTELNET (see above)
software which is a more extensive database of resources, but
does not provide the subject access the LIBS does. - DR
 
Watkins, Beverly T. "Many Campuses Start Building Tomorrow's
Electronic Library" Chronicle of Higher Education 39(2)
(September 2, 1992):A19-A21.  Watkins uses the example of the
Library Information System (Mercury project) at Carnegie
Mellon University.  The Library is adding numerous networked
resources, as well as allowing other departments of the
University add to the system, creating a distributed resource.
The local system will also have Internet access and be accessible
thereby making their library "just one component of a worldwide
electronic library...."  Just over a week after this article
appeared, William Arms,  Vice President for Computing Service at
CMU, posted a clarification of his position vis-a-vis the role of
libraries and librarians in the distributed electronic library
world on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (9/11/92). - DR
 
Williams, David O. and Brian E. Carpenter "Data Networking 
for the European Academic and Research Community: Is It
Important?" Electronic Networking 2(2) (Summer 1992):56-65.  
Williams and Carpenter, head of Computing and Networks and head
of the Communications Systems group at CERN, respectively, decry
the lack of organization and progress in internetworking in
Europe.  According to the authors, the major impediment is that
planning and operation of network services are on a country-by-
country basis with no overall strategy.  In addition to
describing the situation today, Williams and Carpenter also
provide a plan to improve the such services utilizing a number of
approaches and a helpful list of European network acronyms and
their meaning (e.g., EARN, EUNET, NORDUnet, RARE, and COSINE).

Optical Disc Technologies

Bucknall, Tim and Rikki Mangrum "U-Search: A User Study of the
CD-ROM Service at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill" RQ 31(4) (Summer 1992):542-553.  Bucknall and Mangrum
present the results of a month-long electronic survey of users
of a fifteen CD-ROM database local-area network.  1,135
responses were tabulated in response to a variety of questions
pertaining to public service issues, user attitudes toward CD-
ROM searching, and the place of CD-ROM within the overall
research strategy. While past user surveys have tended to focus
on a single database or particular vendor conducted over a short
period of time often in a specific department or special
library, this survey is unique because it is a "broad-based
general survey of all users of a well-established service and a
variety of databases over a month-long period." - TR
 
LaGuardia, Cheryl "CD-ROM Review" Library Journal 117(12) (July
1992):136-138.  In response to requests from librarians, Library
Journal debuts a new monthly review section dedicated to CD-ROM
products. "The more discerning we are in spending library CD-ROM
budgets," writes LaGuardia, "the greater the positive influence
we will exert on the industry. Getting producers and vendors to
listen to us should improve products and services, and we will
all benefit." - TR
 
Tenopir, Carol "Full-Text on CD-ROM" Library Journal 117(12) (July
1992):50-51. In her monthly column "Online Databases," Tenopir
examines the competition from full-text CD-ROM databases which
are proliferating.  Nearly 40% of all CD-ROM databases produced
today are full-text (books, government documents, laws and
legislation, journals and newspapers).  Tenopir asserts that CD-
ROM is a natural medium to supplement or replace paper
collections or full texts online, discusses the distinctions
between ASCII and image files, and outlines five models of full-
text CD-ROM creation/production/distribution. - TR

Baran, Nicholas "The Outlook for Pen Computing"  BYTE 17(9)
(September 1992):159-164.  The young field of pen-based
computing faces an uphill struggle against obstacles both
technical and market-driven.  Handwriting recognition, the size
and portability of systems and other shortcomings, coupled with
the lack of a market track record conspire to limit the role of
pen computing at present.  Doubtless the variety of applications
that will employ future pen-based systems will continue to
encourage research and development in this area. - MT
 
Jennings, Lois "Regrowing Staff: Managerial Priority for the
Future of University Libraries" Public-Access Computer Systems
Review 3(3) (1992):4-15.  Available via e-mail by sending the
message "GET JENNINGS PRV3N3 F=MAIL" to LISTSERV@UHUPVM1 or
LISTSERV@UHUPVM1.UH.EDU.  Causing quite a sensation on the Net
(see PACS-L postings 9/2-9/8/92 - and the article only appeared
August 31!), the Librarian of the University of Canberra, Lois
Jennings, contends that as library users become able to access
information directly the library becomes a threatened
organization.  She goes on to say that "the organization 
threatened by the change must overcome its natural tendency to
resist change and must retaliate with the next round of
innovation."  Her solution is to "regrow" staff from the inside
by reorienting the organization as a whole.  The library must
become a risk-taking institution and become actively involved in
the scholar's workstation environment. - DR

Reinhardt, Andy, Ed Perratore, Andy Redfern and Rich Malloy "The
Greening of Computers"  BYTE 17(9) (September 1992): 147-158. 
Environmental consciousness in the computing industry goes
beyond just the packaging.  Manufacturing techniques that remove
the need for cleaning parts with CFCs, recycling and re-use of
printer cartridges, and the improvement of battery technologies
are proving to be both economically and environmentally sound. 
International and more local environmental laws governing both
the volume and the toxicity of wastes will continue to make
this a new area for development in the computer industry. - MT
