Jacobson, Robert L. "Research Universities Consider Plan to 
Distribute Scholarly Work on Line" Chronicle of Higher 
Education 42(10) (November 3, 1995):A32. -- The Association 
of American Universities (AAU) and the Association for 
Research Libraries (ARL) have come up with a proposal that 
would create a computerized network for distributing 
scholarly work. As a not-for-profit entity funded by member 
universities, the proposed network would facilitate scholarly 
publishing based on the cost of the information rather than 
"cost-plus." As the cost of scholarly publishing continues to 
rise, academic institutions have had to go outside higher 
education to publish scholarly works while at the same time 
having to pay commercial publishers for access to their own 
material. The proposed AAU/ARL plan would be one way to avoid 
this trend and would give scholarly publishing more autonomy.

Lehman, Bruce. "Royalties, Fair Use & Copyright in the 
Electronic Age" Educom Review 30(6)(November/December 
1995):30-35. -- Anyone who is interested in the role of
copyright in a networked environment will likely appreciate 
this interview with the Clinton administration's point man 
for intellectual property rights. Lehman is the Commissioner 
of Patents and Trademarks and chair of the Working Group on 
Intellectual Property Rights within the Information 
Infrastructure Task Force headed by Secretary of Commerce
Ronald Brown. His working group recently released their 
report "Intellectual Property and the National Information 
Infrastructure" [http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii/], which 
makes this interview timely as well as informative. -- RT

Markoff, John. "With a Debut, a Test of On-Line Publishing" 
The New York Times 145(50,244) (November 13, 1995): C7. 
-- This article analyses the evolution of electronic 
publishing as it profiles the upcoming debut of a new 
electronic magazine, Salon [http://www.salon1999.com]. As 
electronic journals emerge, they are starting to take 
advantage of the new technological capabilities available 
on the Web creating magazines that are interactive rather 
than mere electronic versions of traditional print magazines. 
In addition to creating a new model for electronic publishing
based on technological innovations, the magazine will generate 
a more creative business model; Salon will be underwritten by 
several big name financial backers and will also be financed 
by advertisements.-- MP

O'Reilly, Tim. "Publishing Models for Internet Commerce" 
OnTheInternet 1(4) (September/October 1995):29-35. -- Who 
better to discuss the impact of the Internet on publishing 
than a publisher who is helping define the market? O'Reilly 
and Associates has long been known of pithy computer books,
including  _The Whole Internet User's Guide and Catalog_ 
-- most likely the single most successful Internet title to 
date. In this lengthy but highly readable article, O'Reilly 
offers insights and predictions about the future of publishing 
on the net. Those who are new to the game, or librarians who 
must wrestle with a new paradigm for library "acquisition"
of electronic texts, would do well to pay attention. -- RT

This article is a good introduction to digital publishing. 
It compares many publishing and design issues compared across 
three media; print, CD-ROM, and WWW. Sometimes it compares 
apples to oranges, but for the most part this information 
would be very useful for a museum or library gearing up their
publications unit to take on new media. It contains an 
explanation of HTML (as a subset of SGML), image formats, 
typeface (where it can be controlled; where it can't), and 
delivery means (WWW servers for WWW, Macromind and the like 
for CD-ROM). It also contains WWW URLs for further 
exploration, and a list of products for digital publication, 
including tools for text/HTML, images, and audio. The article 
would also be useful for anyone considering how to best 
re-purpose their digital information across these media. -- RR


Multimedia and Hypermedia

"1996 Multimedia Tool Guide" New Media Special 13th Annual 
Issue (November 1995) -- [http://www.hyperstand.com/SITE/toolguide/1996.ToolGuide.html]
This entire issue of New Media magazine is a guide to software 
and hardware for the authoring and delivery of multimedia. 
The issue is broken down into six sections: authoring, online, 
audio, video, storage, and display, with subsections on specifics 
like sound cards, MPEG encoding systems, CD Recording Systems, 
etc. The sections could have been re-thought, but a lot of 
useful info is contained in this issue, along with product 
specs, uses for the products, prices, and company phone 
numbers. Useful for comparison shopping for any museum or 
library deciding on tools for digital projects. New Media is 
now available also on the Web at http://www.hyperstand.com.

Fillmore, Laura. "Literacy's Last Best Hope" OnTheInternet 
1(4) (September/October 1995):37-42. -- Laura Fillmore 
founded the Online BookStore, which has since become Open 
Book Systems [http://www.obs-us.com/]. In this article 
adapted from a speech at EDMedia 1995 in Graz, Austria, 
she takes us on a sojourn that both begins and ends in 
Graz, but stops many places in between: 
[http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/papers/gr1.htm].
It is a journey well worth taking, and best taken online 
so the side paths she offers as examples of her points can 
be explored as well. She mainly talks of "hyperliteracy" 
which she defines as "the capability to recognize, access, 
and apply hypertext ideas and tools online," and which she 
fervently hopes will be nurtured rather than controlled or
censored. -- RT

-- [http://www.macworld.com/pages/december.95/Feature.1632.html]
This article explores the range of tools one can use 
to capture, edit, and output digital audio for a variety 
of uses. The author covers very effective low-cost 
solutions, using the hardware built into any newer Mac 
with software-only audio programs, to high-end hardware/
software combination packages for editing/authoring audio 
for professional output. This would be a useful article for 
someone already introduced to basic digital audio issues, 
such as standard file formats (AIFF, WAV, AU), and quality 
(kilohertz), and who is now looking for solutions for 
producing audio for a specific use (online delivery, 
background music for an educational CD-ROM, etc). -- RR

Networks and Networking

Flohr, Udo. "Hyper-G Organizes the Web" BYTE 20(11) 
(November 1995):59-64. -- The overnight explosion of the 
World Wide Web following the introduction of NCSA Mosaic 
for personal computers may tend to blind us to the fact 
that it may not be the best tool for the job. In this 
overview article on a Web competitor called Hyper-G, Flohr 
identifies flaws in current Web technology and how Hyper-G 
solves them. Some of the Hyper-G features include the 
ability to attach links to read-only files such as those 
stored on CD-ROM, or within objects such as Postscript files 
or video clips. This and more comes at little cost, as 
Hyper-G servers can support standard Web clients (albeit 
without the full Hyper-G functionality), while offering 
these advanced features to Hyper-G clients. This is 
definitely a technology worth checking out, which you can do 
at the Hyper-G site at http://hgiicm.tu-graz.ac.at/. -- RT

Hoffman, Irene M. "Fundraising: A Selected List of Internet 
Resources" College & Research Libraries News 56(10) (November 
1995): 692-693, 717. -- This month's C&RL News feature on

highlighting those sources of particular interest to those in 
library development. -- MP

Jacobson, Robert L. "Researchers Temper Their Ambitions for 
Digital Libraries" Chronicle of Higher Education 42(13) 
(November 24, 1995):A19. -- In tackling the issue of 
interoperability of electronic material available in a 
network of interconnected digital libraries, librarians
and computer scientists concluded at a recent conference in 
Santa Barbara that it may not be practical to seek one 
overarching plan for cataloging, searching and retrieving 
data from network collections. Computer users are so varied 
in terms of age, background and information needs while at
the same time digital materials vary so widely in type (text, 
graphic, sound, video) that creating a single, all-purpose 
method for creating material or for retrieving it would not 
only be impossible but impractical.  -- MP
  
McLeod, Jennifer and Michael White. "Building the Virtual 
Campus Bit by Bit: World Wide Web Development at the 
University of Maine" Computers in Libraries 15(10) 
(November/December 1995): 45-49. -- Startled by what
seemed to be a real lack of central organization at many 
academic Web sites, the University of Maine set out to 
develop a well organized and unified Web site for their 
campus. This article, and its companion sidebars ("Top-
Quality Web Presence Offers Appeal, Consistency, and 
Current Information" and "Seven Guidelines for Building 
Campus Web Systems"), summarize the research and experience 
involved in implementing a Web cite at the University of 
Maine. Visit the Maine site at http://www.ume.maine.edu/

Markoff, John. "If Medium is the Message, the Message is the 
Web" The New York Times 145(50,244) (November 20, 1995): A1, 
C5. -- The World Wide Web seems to be the official media 
darling of business and technology sections in daily 
newspapers throughout the nation as evidenced by this front 
page story in the New York Times. Technology reporter John 
Markoff discusses the role of the Web within the larger 
historical context of mass media and analyses how and why it 
has become such a popular means of communication. The Web has 
skyrocketed in popularity, Markoff reports, because it is a
medium that is technologically innovative and at the same time 
has support of corporate backers who see its profit potential. 
The fact that individuals can create Web sites so easily has 
led to a democratization of the medium with social implications 
for new kind of technology-based community. -- MP

Young, Jeffrey R. "Classes on the Web" Chronicle of Higher 
Education 42(10) (November 3, 1995):A27, A32-A33. -- In 
describing the experiences of several college professors who 
have taken advantage of network technology by making course 
materials available on the World Wide Web or by having their 
students submit their papers online, this article illustrates 
some of the practical, educational applications of new network 
technologies. These technologies enable professors to offer 
more current information and allow them to be more flexible 
since they can alter materials throughout the term. Professors 
have noticed that many of their students are more engaged with 
the new medium and therefore are more likely to explore the
Internet beyond just the immediate coursework. On the other hand, 
there are other students who prefer hard copies and, of course, 
there are still many unresolved copyright issues. Despite the 
obvious advantages of using the network in teaching, there seems 
to be little administrative support for network technologies 
which means that those incorporating the net in their teaching 
must learn how to create Web sites and digitize course materials 
on their own time. -- MP

Stigliani, Joan. _The Computer User's Survival Guide_ 
Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1995. -- If you are 
a computer user and have ever wondered why your back hurts, 
or your arm tingles, or your eyes sting this is the book for 
you. Not so much for how it explains these consequences 
(although the explanations are clear and the diagrams are
excellent), but more for the tips on how to prevent yourself 
from experiencing those consequences or worse. This book is a 
good and concise guide to all the various health problems 
associated with computer use and how to avoid them. Few 
organizations can afford to be without such information, as an 
ounce of prevention is (as they say) worth a pound of cure.
