   Guernsey, Lisa. "Company Offers Free Access to a Big Database, if
   Libraries Give it $400,000" Chronicle of Higher Education 64(28)
   (March 30, 1998):A30. -- Guernsey describes an unusual marketing move
   by Chadwyck-Healey, a database publisher. The firm has pledged to make
   ArhivesUSA searchable on the Web by anyone in the United States and
   Canada, if it can raise $400,000 in funds from libraries by the end of
   April. While this ultimately may be seen as an innovative strategy to
   increase access, it is a tale with many strange elements. The
   database, which was built from information that was given freely by
   libraries to the publisher, would be given to the general
   citizenry--but only if libraries will now pay a "fee" for value added
   to their original "gift." The article is well-balanced, and quotes
   both critics and supporters. Critics suggest that Chadwyck-Healey
   might consider using profits from the database to give access to
   libraries, instead of charging libraries. The scenario of
   cash-strapped non-profits giving scarce funds to a profit-making
   business must surely suggest that we are entering a brave new world of
   information pricing. Perhaps we would be well-advised to check our
   looking glasses lest we fall into them. Without doubt, it's an
   experimental project, and one worth following, because it may indicate
   the shape of future pricing strategies in the era of the net. -- TH
   
   Pack, Thomas. "Visualizing Information: Visualization Systems Data
   Management" Database 21(1)(February/March 1998): 47-49 -- This article
   is a gentle reminder for information professionals about the
   importance of information visualization, a relatively new technique
   for analyzing search results from large, multivariate data sets.
   Information visualization transforms data into graphic representations
   to help viewers use their natural tools of observation and processing
   to extract knowledge more efficiently. Traditionally used in
   engineering and medicine, information visualization systems are
   becoming increasingly popular in areas such as financial services
   where they help decision makers interpret large, complex data sets.
   Pack notes that there are still limitations for bringing effective
   visualization systems to the Web, but believes this will likely change
   with improvements in Web-based technologies and increased bandwidth.

   Agre, Phil. "The Internet and Public Discourse" First Monday 3(3)
   (March 2, 1998). -- Agre argues that the confusion about how to manage
   legal and political expectations in cyberspace is rooted in a lack of
   comprehension of the new medium. It's too easy to mistake
   communication on the net with telephony, newspapers etc--therein lies
   the problem. The medium is actually a "meta-medium": a set of layered
   services that is built from flexible elements, and its properties
   change to meet the desires of the author. To properly map legal and
   political concerns to harness the power of the new beast, we need to
   start anew and map the meta-medium to legal theories and social
   conventions that capture its modus vivendi. If we do not, we risk
   falling into the profitless trap of imposing the wrong conceptual
   framework from other media. -- TH

   Beall, Jeffrey "Guaranteed Hits" College & Research Libraries News
   59(3)(March 1998):160-162. This practical article provides tips on how
   index your site for Search engines to ensure that it will be retrieved
   by a greater number of Web searchers. Among the strategies are 1)
   visit the major search engines and look for the "Add URL" button or
   it's equivalent (there are even Web sites that bring together all the
   "Add URL" pages of the major search engines
   (http://www.tiac.net/users/seeker/searchenginesub.html), 2) design
   your site in such a way to increase the likelihood of its being
   indexed accurately: don't include vital information exclusively in
   graphics as these will not be read by search engines and place vital
   information in larger font towards the top of the page, 3) use the
   Dublin Core, a block of data in standard form that provides
   information about your site in a way that is recognized by search
   engines; as a standard for metadata, the Dublin Core is big in the
   library community (for more information, see
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot and
   http://www.ub.lu.se/metadata/DC_creator.html), 4) catalog your site
   not only for your own online catalog but in one of the major
   bibliographic utilities as well, 5) seek out specialized search
   engines that focus on a particular discipline and then look for the
   "Add URL" button. - MP
   
   Jayne, Elaine and Patricia Vander Meer. "The Library's Role in
   Academic Instructional Use of the World Wide Web" Research Strategies
   (15)3 (Fall 1997):123-150. -- As academic librarians become experts in
   doing more with less, they will need these skills in yet another area
   critical to their mission: supporting the use of the Web in teaching
   and learning. The authors argue that students and faculty will need
   adequate training and guidance to take advantage of the instructional
   benefits of the Web. They propose a collaborative approach between
   academic libraries and computing centers to facilitate a Web
   instructional program. While their collaborative program suggestions
   may be fairly basic for institutions that have already initiated
   efforts in this area, they do also provide valuable criteria for
   demonstrating and constructing instructional Web sites and an
   illustrative list of library-related and subject specific Web sites.

   Jones, Martha. "Online Resources for Writers" LJ Digital (April 1,
   1998), Berinstein, Paula. "The Numbers Game: The Top 10 Sources for
   Statistics" Online 22(2) (March 1998) -- Many writers, interested in
   the fine art of verbal nuance, cringe at the idea of crude statistics.
   It's precisely because most writers don't consider themselves "numbers
   people" that I offer the second citation paired with the first, just
   to encourage a little horizon broadening. Berinstein's ranking of
   statistical sites starts with the single most useful source for
   residents of the U.S., the Statistical Abstract of the United States,
   and continues with other sources which are rich in domestic and
   foreign figures. She also offers strategies for navigating this
   quantitative sea. Jones has reviewed Web sites which can help with the
   craft of writing and with getting published, and may create a sense of
   community for lonely scribes. Her top pick is Inkspot, for its breadth
   and organization. Zuzu's Petals Literary Resource Homepage is singled
   out as particularly good for poets. So visit each other's web pages,
   and maybe you counters and conjurers will understand each other a
   little better. Okay? Big hug. -- JR
   
   Mace, Scott, et.al. "Weaving a Better Web" BYTE 23(3)(March
   1998):58-68. -- The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is likely to
   revolutionize the Web. That's a big claim, but I'm not the only one
   who thinks that. For example, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, and
   Netscape are all lining up behind it. John Bosak from Sun is the
   father of XML, Microsoft is pushing it like crack, and Netscape
   recently announced support for it in their upcoming 5.0 version of
   their browser. This feature article in BYTE and its accompanying
   sidebars is an excellent introduction to XML as well as related draft
   standards and software. XML provides an infrastructure to solve many
   of the current problems with the Web, from better linking methods to
   powerful data structures. Web managers who ignore XML will do so at
   their peril. -- RT
   
   Nims, Julia K. and Linda Rich. "How Successfully Do Users Search the
   Web?" College & Research Libraries News, 59(3)(March 1998):155-158. --
   Have you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall to observe how people
   search for information the Web? That's just want Nims and Rich from
   Bowling Green State University did with the help of the McKinley
   Search Voyeur Web site. Although their goal was to find out the common
   pitfalls of searchers in their institution so that they could adjust
   their Web instruction accordingly, spying on their own users was
   neither technically possible nor ethically appropriate. It is perhaps
   no surprise that a large number of the searches they spied on were
   sex-related; it is also no surprise that many of the searches seemed
   poorly planned. Among the types of "mistakes" they encountered were:
   one-word searches (e.g. "women" or "computer"); inclusion of stop
   words; typing errors (the frightening thing is that users who
   mispelled words often retrieved large search results!); entire or
   partial URLs (what seemed to be happening was that users who wanted to
   go to a specific site were doing a search on the URL rather than just
   entering it into the location box); exclusion of Magellan search
   suggestions (very few of the searches seemed to take advantage of
   certain Magellan features such as using operators like "not" or "or"
   or placing quotes around a certain phrase; this indicates that users
   do not seem to be reading the help documentation before doing their
   searches). Obviously there are limitations to a study like this
   because a voyeur cannot really know what the the intent of the
   searcher is or whether or not the searcher is satisfied with the
   results. The mistakes observed here are many of the same mistakes that
   patrons have always been making on online systems; the difference is
   that the problems are magnified within the Web environment. -- MP
   
   Rosenfeld, Louis and Peter Morville. Information Architecture for the
   World Wide Web Cambridge, MA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1998. - We've all
   seen the problem -- Web sites with no discernible organizational
   paradigm, uses of technology that border on a federal offense, and
   just plain bad site design. Now those site designers have no excuse.
   If they don't know what they're doing, here's the book to tell them
   how. In under 200 pages, Rosenfeld and Morville (columnists for Web
   Review and principals with Argus Associates) cover such essential
   concepts as organization, navigation, searching, and labeling systems
   as well as much more. There is enough here to help all Web managers,
   no matter if we already believe ourselves to be competent in creating
   and managing our sites. Because mostly we aren't as good as we may
   think. If you manage a Web site, you owe it to your users to study
   this book. And some of you should be shackled to your servers until it
   sinks in. Still need convincing? See the sample chapter
   (http://webreview.com/wr/pub/98/03/06/feature/index.html) for a taste.

   Watters, Carolyn, Marshall Conley and Cynthia Alexander. "The Digital
   Agora: Using Technology for Learning in the Social Sciences"
   Communications of the ACM 41(1)(January 1998):50-57. -- The "digital
   agora" at Acadia University is a Web-based system which, according to
   the authors, encourages collaborative analysis of social problems.
   Students enrolled in introductory political science, peace studies and
   international politics courses work through Web pages to read, write
   responses, pull together research and reach consensus after
   negotiation on group efforts. The focus of the article is on the
   interweaving of curriculum with site organization and functions; do
   not look here for much criticism of the effectiveness of Web-based
   learning systems. The authors do allow that Web resources may be "only
   rudimentary as tools for facilitating the understanding of the
   complexity of issues, the formulation of strategies dealing with these
   issues, and finally, the communication of ideas," which are some
   pretty serious reservations. But that topic is dropped like a hot
   potato, and the emphasis remains on implementation issues. The first
   line of the article states proudly that "Acadia University is the
   first laptop university in Canada," and this is recommended reading
   for anyone pondering programs for an equally fortunate student body.
   It's helpful to read it in the context of the January issue, themed
   "Computers Across Campus," which has several pieces about programs
   which require students to explore the possibilities of info tech. --
