Expert Systems  
 
Barletta, Ralph "An Introduction to Case-Based Reasoning" AI Expert  
6(8) (August 1991):42-49.  Learning from experience and  
extrapolating this knowledge to guide us in new situations is a  
common use of our intelligence.  In the continued effort to create  
machine intelligence, AI people have worked out a new technology  
called case-based reasoning (CBR). Using CBR, expert systems are  
able to learn from each individual case in order to solve new  
problems which may be similar but not identical to those previously  
met.  This article gives a good introduction to CBR & compares it  
with the more common expert system problem solving schemes. 
 
Desmarais, Norman "Virtual, Interactive Literature" CD-ROM  
Librarian 6(6) (June 1991):18-20.  Virtual reality (VR), that child of  
AI which is almost nonsensically described as, "artificial reality" is  
coming of age and may find its way into our lives. VR may be  
conceptualized as being similar to television, except VR is  
interactive, allowing the user to influence the environment (recall  
Woody Allen in The Purple Rose of Cairo?) This article describes the  
ways VR may find a niche in our entertainment by allowing us to  
visit museums, solve murder mysteries, travel to distant lands, etc.  
all from the comfort of our homes.  Considering these possibilities  
it is interesting to imagine academic uses - perhaps in teaching  
history, social anthropology or even biochemistry. 
 
Keyguide to Information Sources in Artificial Intelligence/Expert  
Systems / Peter J. Hancox, et al.  Lawrence, Kansas : Ergosyst  
Associates, Inc., 1990. This book is a cornucopia of AI research  
information. It offers an extensive annotated bibliography of key  
literature; listings of AI societies, publishers, and libraries; as well  
as an overview of the field's history, organization and research  
tools. 
 
 
Information Transfer 
 
Jackson, Mary E. The Online environment in the 1990s : A challenge  
for resource sharing.  IOLS '90: Integrated Online Library Systems,  
Proceedings 1990, New York, May 2-3, 1989.  Medford, NJ, Learned  
Information, 1990, p. 91-101.  Jackson explains that whereas in the  
80s we were finding better, faster methods of sending requests for  
materials (mostly all electronically transmitted now), in the 90s we  
must find faster, better methods to transmit the actual documents.  
She describes Ariel, the RLG Document Transmission Workstation as  
one example. 
 

Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
"DVI Announcements at the Sixth Annual Microsoft Conference" CD-  
ROM Librarian 6(6) (June 1991):15-18.  A quick look at new products  
ranging from a DVI (Digital Video Interactive) product that assists  
in instruction of British Sign Language to portable multimedia  
systems and more.  DVI seems to be joining the future of multimedia  
with specific products such as those described here. 
 
Phillips, Richard L.  "MediaView: A General Multimedia Digital  
Publication System" Communications of the ACM 34(7) (July  
1991):75-83.  Designed in this first instance for the NeXT  
environment, MediaView pushes the boundaries of the possible a  
little further in the world of multimedia.  In addition to taking full  
advantage of the NeXT capabilities with text, graphics, audio and  
motion video displays, MediaView permits communication between  
and editing of the various components of presentations from the  
NeXT desktop.  This article introduces the reader to the NeXT  
environment in the context of a multimedia system, providing a  
fascinating glimpse of the future of computing and multimedia. 
 
Urr, Clifford.  "Will the Real Hypertext Please Stand Up?" Computers  
in Libraries 11(5) (May 1991):46-49.  A look at the philosophy and  
principles of hypertext that is meant to be helpful for the user  
interested in purchasing equipment or in deciding whether to explore  
hypertext for their own applications.  An excellent article for  
library staff and users, describing issues surrounding indexing,  
classification structures and hypertext organization in a non- 
technical framework. 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Grycz, Czeslaw Jan "Economic Models for Disseminating Scholarly  
Information"  DLA Bulletin 11(1) (Summer 1991):1, 3-4, 24.  Grycz  
describes the numerous ways electronic resources can be put to use  
in the academic environment as well as the economic aspects of  
such activity. 
 
Flanders, Bruce "NREN: The Big Issues aren't Technical" American  
Libraries 22(6) (June 1991):572-574.  If you're already familiar  
with the NREN, skip to the last section of this article, where  
Flanders brings up the "big issues:" who will own the NREN? who will  
have access? how will privacy be protected?  Flanders does not  
provide answers, but a focus for our questions. 
 
Flanders, Bruce "The WELL: Discourse in the Electronic Village"  
Computers in Libraries 11(5) (May 1991):26-28.  If you've been  
hearing about the WELL, but you're not sure what it is, how to join or  
if to join (i.e.,become a "Wellian"), here's a good place to start.  In a  
way, the WELL is an electronic conference and resource center.  The  
WELL is home to the electronic Apple Library Users Group (ALUG),  
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and interest groups of  
every kind.

ROM Networking Using Off-the-Shelf Components" 
 
Sproull, Lee.  Connections : New Ways of Working in the Networked  
Organization  / Lee Sproull, Sara Kiesler.  Cambridge, Mass. : The MIT  
Press, 1991.  This wide-ranging and insightful book is a must for  
anyone looking at the social and psychological implications of  
networking.  With such index entries as: Access, Electronic groups,  
Performance control, Sexpert, and Social control, this is a must  
read. 
 
 
Optical Disc Technology 
 
Clark, Katie "Diskware" CD-ROM Professional  4(4) (July 1991):115- 
116. Clark outlines some of the important factors to consider in  
evaluating CD-ROMs versus online systems, including database  
content, software retrieval features, response time and indexing. 
 
Crane, Pamela "Multifunction Optical Offers Versatility" CD-ROM  
Professional  4(4) (July 1991):72-75. This article describes yet  
another new optical technology looming on the horizon-- 
multifunction optical technology, a hybrid combination of rewritable  
and write-once capabilities.  The author heralds this new technology  
as the "mass storage problem solver for the knowledge management  
needs of the coming years." 
 
Kriz, Harry M., et al. "An Environmental Approach to CD-ROM  
Networking Using Off-the-Shelf Components" CD-ROM Professional  
4(4) (July 1991):24-26.  This article describes Virginia Tech's new  
CD-ROM LAN system which provides access to both on-campus users  
and branch libraries over 200 miles away--all for under $19,000. 
 
"Something to Remember Us By: The American Memory Program"  
College & Research Libraries News 52(6) (June 1991):375-376. The  
American Memory Program is an ambitious project to provide  
nationwide access to the collections of the Library of Congress.   
This article describes the project and a prototype slated for testing  
at 30 libraries during the second half of 1991. Collections in various  
formats including photographs, graphic arts, motion pictures,  
recorded sound, music, broadsides, manuscripts, books, and  
pamphlets, will be placed on compact discs and videodiscs, and will  
eventually be available online as well. 
 
 
General and News Bits 
 
Dillon, Andrew "New Technology and the Reading Process: with  
Electronic Journals, How They Look is as Important as What They  
Say" Computers in Libraries 11(6) (June 1991):23-26. 
 
Ovens, Cora S.H. "Computer Literacy and Libraries" Electronic Library  
9(2) (April 1991):85-88.  Mere rote usage of a computer does not  
qualify as computer literacy, but for many the anxiety associated  
with learning about computers is a stumbling block toward becoming  
literate.  This article talks about the problems facing computer  
literacy and discusses a few basic solutions.  One interesting point  
made is that age, gender and educational attainment have no relation  
to the possible degrees of computer anxiety. And, as might be  
expected, patient and thorough training is the most effective  
solution to the problem.
