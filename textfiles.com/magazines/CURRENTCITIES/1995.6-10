Electronic Publishing

Cronin, Blaise and Kara Overfelt. "E-Journals and Tenure" 
Journal of the American Society for Information Science 
46(9) (October 1995):700-703. -- A brief discussion 
about the role of electronic publishing in the promotion 
and tenure process for university scholars. Though it is 
not yet clear whether the academic reward system is 
embracing e-journals as criteria for advancement, it is 
clear that a growing number of individual scholars and 
administrators believe e-journals to be worthy of inclusion
in the review process. -- DR

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Copyright in Cyberspace" Chronicle 
of Higher Education 42(3) (September 15, 1995):A22, A24. 
-- A report issued by the Commerce Department's Working 
Group on Intellectual Property Rights
[http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii/] has recommended certain 
changes to copyright law that would accommodate access to 
information on the Internet. Librarians and educators have 
expressed concern that the report is dominated by business 
concerns favoring the rights of copyright owners over the 
needs of academia. Many have also expressed concern over 
the recommendation that network operators be held 
responsible for copyright infringements; they fear that 
those responsible for running networks would be required 
to become "copyright police."  -- MP

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Panel Urges Saving Digital Data for 
Posterity" Chronicle of Higher Education 42(2) (September 
8, 1995):A31. -- The Commission on Preservation and Access 
and the Research Libraries Group has created a task force 
to investigate how best to insure continued access to 
records stored in digital form. The report issued by this 
task force calls on individuals and organizations interested 
in digital archives to work together on developing standards 
and mechanisms for moving digital materials into usable 
formats; it also calls for cooperation between copyright 
owners and archivists in determining who has access to the 
archived materials. The report, which is still considered by 
its authors to be in an interim stage is available at
http://www-rlg.stanford.edu/ArchTF/. -- MP
 
Multimedia and Hypermedia

Bearman, David, ed. _Hands On Hypermedia and Interactivity in 
Museums_ (ISBN:1-885626-12-6) Pittsburgh: Archives & Museum 
Informatics, 1995. -- This book is a publication of the papers 
and articles presented at the Third International Conference on 
Hypermedia & Interactivity in Museums. The diversity of issues
covered is great: from audiences and new technology, new media 
in instruction and research, detailed case studies of multimedia 
projects, to intellectual property and more. This book and its 
companion volume, "Multimedia Computing and Museums" 
(ISBN: 1-885626-11-8), raise issues that are of interest even
beyond museums, and will be fruitful reading for anyone in the 
cultural heritage community. -- RR

Besser, Howard & Jennifer Trant. _Introduction to Imaging: 
Issues in Constructing an Image Database_ (ISBN: 0-89236-361-4) 
Los Angeles: Getty Art History Information Program, 1995. 
[available at http://www.ahip.getty.edu/intro_imaging/home.html]
-- This booklet is a very readable and concise guide to the 
process of imaging with the end-goal of using the images in 
any type of image database for online display and delivery 
over networks. It covers image standards, quality control, 
techniques and more. The book will be of great use to the 
manager or technical staff beginning an imaging project, 
and contains a glossary of terms as well as a bibliography 
for further reading. -- RR
 

Networks and Networking

Bournellis, Cynthia. "Internet '95" Internet World 6(11) 
(November 1995):47-52. -- One of the most commonly asked 
questions on the Internet relates to the "vital statistics" 
of the net itself; that is, how many users, files, servers, 
etc., can be found on this world wide network. Whether this 
curiosity stems from a sense of awe at the phenomenal 
growth the Internet has seen, or a desire to justify capital 
outlays for Internet services, the urge to quantify is 
clearly not going away anytime soon. In this article 
Bournellis highlights some of the network surveys that have 
been done to try and quantify what seems to be nearly 
unquantifiable. URLs to key statistical sources are provided 
as well so readers can keep up with the rapidly changing 
statistical picture. -- RT

Chrzastowski, Tina E.  "Do Workstations Work Too Well?: 
An Investigation into Library Workstation Popularity and 
the Principle of Least Effort" Journal of the American 
Society for Information Science 46(8) (September 1995): 
638-641.-- Chrzastowski looks at statistics taken from 
library workstations at the Chemistry Library at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that seem to 
show a trend among users away from the more exhaustive 
print indexes (in this case Chemical Abstracts) in favor 
of the less comprehensive electronic indexes available 
via the library workstation (Current Contents). -- DR
 
Green, Tim. "Online Information Services: Caught in the
Web?" Online 19(4) (July/August 1995):22-31. [available 
at http://www.research.ibm.com/xw-library] -- Green 
describes how online database providers such as Dialog, 
Lexis-Nexis, STN International and others are using
the World Wide Web. Common uses include marketing,
product testing and limited free services. Screen shots
from most of the services mentioned are included. -- RT

Heaney, Michael. "Object-Oriented Cataloging" Information 
Technology and Libraries 14(3) (September 1995):135-153. 
-- Amidst an outcry from librarians to "catalog the 
Internet" (as if that were possible), Heaney's article 
appears to indicate that such an activity would be like 
loading more people on the Titanic while it sinks beneath 
their feet. Certainly many of the limitations and problems 
with existing bibliographic standards like AACR2 and MARC 
are well-known among librarians conversant with them, but 
Heaney goes much farther than most would go in his attempt 
to bring cataloging practice into the networked age. He 
proposes an entirely new cataloging standard (AACR3 as it 
were) based upon object-oriented modeling. He freely
acknowledges, however, that the sheer weight of existing 
standards presents a formidable barrier to the drastic 
changes that he proposes. Nonetheless it can be provocative 
and informative to consider his proposal. -- RT

Lewis, Peter H. "Most Go On Line at Home, Study Finds" 
New York Times 145(50,224) (October 23, 1995):C6. -- An 
online survey conducted in mid-1995 by Yahoo, Inc. and 
Jupiter Communications concludes that computer networks 
have become a mass market medium faster than many insiders 
had expected and suggests that most people access the Web 
from home, not from the office or at school. A majority of 
participants in the Yahoo survey said that they had cut 
back on television watching in order to spend more time on 
the Internet and many said they visited the Web or another 
online service more than once a day. Meanwhile, other 
surveys have found that nearly 14,000 new commercial online 
service accounts are being opened each day with 9.9 million 
Americans now subscribing to an online service, a 78 percent 
increase from last year. -- MP

McMillan, Gary A., Margaret R. Dittemore, Carol Ritzen 
Kem. "Internet Resources for Sociology" College & 
Research Libraries News 56(9) (October 1995):639-643. 
-- Another bibliography of selected Internet resources, 
this month's C&RL News guide is designed to be a resource 
for librarians introducing Internet resources in 
sociology to faculty and students.  It includes a list 
of scholarly discussion lists and electronic conferences,
electronic journals, subdiscipline-related sites and 
sources for finding information about grants and funding 
sources. -- MP

Noack, David R. "Visiting Museums Virtually" Internet 
World 6(10) (October 1995):86-91. -- Noack gives a virtual 
tour through an incredible variety of online exhibits and 
displays, ranging from dinosaurs to modern art. The article 
includes pointers to Web servers, museum-related electronic 
discussions, FTP sites, Gopher servers, and Telnet-accessible 
databases. -- RT

Rinehart, Richard. "The Museum Information Access 
Continuum" Spectra 23(1) (Fall 1995):28-29. [available 
at http://www.uampfa.berkeley.edu/continuum.html]
-- Rinehart, a frequent contributor to Current Cites, 
places museum digital access projects somewhere on a 
continuum from stewardship to pedagogy. Stewardship leads 
to "detail-rich" records of collection items in order to 
better preserve and manage them, whereas pedagogy encourages 
"context-rich" records to place collection items within "an 
envelope of history or ideas." Rinehart asserts that neither 
end of the spectrum should be preferred over the other -- 
both are required to fulfill the mission of most museums. 
Rather he uses this context to help explain the complex 
problems of providing online access to information spanning 
the spectrum in a unified and easy to use way. -- RT
  
Robertson, Neil. "WWW: The Next Generation" Internet World 
6(11) (November 1995):32-34. -- Tired of plain HTML? Have 
you mastered forms and tables and are looking for the 
next thrill? This article gives a brief look at several 
cutting-edge Web technologies: Netscape server push and 
client pull, the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) 
and NCSA Mosaic's Common Client Interface. Essential URLs
are included. -- RT

Seabrook, John. "Home on the Net" The New Yorker (October 
16, 1995):66-76. -- In this year's "home issue," the New 
Yorker's technology writer John Seabrook 
[http://www.levity.com/seabrook/] recounts the adventures 
and mis-adventures of creating his own home page (get it?). 
He provides a clear, simple description of the Web for 
network novices while at the same time offering seasoned 
Webmasters thought-provoking analysis of Internet culture 
and how individual identity is manifested there. The 
readability of Seabrook's insights make up for the 
credibility he loses for not actually doing the mark up for 
his own home page! -- MP

"Special Issue of Geographic Information Systems (GISs) 
and Academic Libraries" The Journal of Academic 
Librarianship 21(4) (July 1995). -- Academic libraries 
are increasingly facing the challenges relating to making 
geographic information systems available to their 
clientele. This set of articles explains GISs and the role 
that libraries can play, and gives working examples of 
libraries that have integrated such systems into their mix 
of services. The articles provide many good citations and 
URLs for further reading and exploration. -- RT
 

Optical Disc Technology

Herther, Nancy. "CD-ROM Publishing Today: What's Hot
& What's Not" Database 18(4) (August/September 1995):
27-41. -- Herther asserts that CD-ROM publishers have
"passed from the 'bleeding edge' of design to clearly
leading edge products that compete well against their
online and print counterparts. Beyond this, whole new 
works by 'electronic artists' are establishing CD-ROM
as a legitimate medium for creating what may be
tomorrow's masterpieces." While prices for CD-ROM 
drives and discs continues to fall, overall quality
continues to rise. Herther uncovers the hottest trends
in CD-ROM design in the following categories: reference/
information titles, computer software on CD-ROM, 
books with enhanced text, art and images on discs,
government CD-ROMs, games, software tutorials, 
education and training, newspapers, magazines and 
catalogs on CD-ROM, and musical CDs. -- TR


General

BYTE Magazine's 20th Anniversary Special Issue 20(9) 
(September 1995). [available at 
http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/sec7.htm] -- One of 
the most authoritative magazines devoted to small systems 
is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a special issue 
looking both backward and forward. BYTE editorial staff 
select the top 20 in a number of categories, from 
essential (Top 20 Technologies) to hilarious (20 
Spectacular Failures). Besides bringing back a lot of 
recent memories that seem ancient (anyone remember the 
Commodore PET?), it dramatically demonstrates how far 
computing has come in so little time.  -- RT

"Found! The Best Books of 1995: A Roundup of Books That
Can Make a Difference" Computer Currents (Bay Area 
Edition) 13(11) (October 17, 1995):37-53. [available at 
http://www.ccurrents.com/covr] -- 28 computer-related 
tomes are abstracted and reviewed in five different 
categories: Inside Computing, Hands-on Help, Windows 
Saviors, Internet for the Rest of Us, and For Web-Meisters 
Only. As the subject headings suggest, coverage is broad, 
with the latest from Cliff Stoll and Scott Adams alongside 
Windows 95 survival kits. If you are looking to fill in 
the gaps of your info tech library, this would be a good 
place to start. -- TR 

Gorman, Michael. "Five New Laws of Librarianship" American 
Libraries 26(8) (September 1995):784-785. -- In this article 
adapted from his recently released book ("Future Libraries: 
Dreams, Madness and Reality"), Gorman humbly offers his 
revision of S.R. Ranganathan's Five Laws of Library Science, 
which were promulgated more than sixty years ago. They are: 
1) Libraries serve humanity, 2) Respect all forms by which 
knowledge is communicated, 3) Use technology intelligently 
to enhance service, 4) Protect free access to knowledge,
and 5) Honor the past and create the future. -- RT

Swerdlow, Joel. "Information Revolution" National Geographic
188(4) (October 1995):5-36. -- Although this article on the 
"information revolution" (aren't we tired of that yet?) is 
relatively superficial and fairly brief, yet it is the 
illustrations that make it well worth the price of admission. 
The opening photo brings an oft-quoted phrase into reality 
with a force that only an image could provide, as a lone
person sits in a darkened room surrounded by 500 (yes, count 
them) television screens to depict the hundreds of television 
channels that will supposedly be our daily fare in the 
not-too-distant future. Then check out the "photo" of the 
monkees in the library reading room. Don't say I didn't warn 
you. -- RT
