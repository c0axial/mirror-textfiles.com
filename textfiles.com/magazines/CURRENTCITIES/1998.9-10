   Kranch, Douglas A. "Beyond Migration: Preserving Electronic Documents
   with Digital Tablets." Information Technology & Libraries 17(3)
   (September 1998): 138-148. - Preserving digital information is one of
   the great challenges facing librarians and archivists. There are
   numerous issues that must be addressed, from technical details to
   organizational structures. In this piece, however, Kranch focuses
   mainly on the technical details, by putting forward the idea of
   encapsulating digital content in a "tablet" that contains all the
   hardware and software required to use it. Such tablets would,
   presumably, prevent the need to migrate the information forward into
   new systems that replace the ones used to create the information in
   the first place. Although the idea has some merit, one could just as
   easily consider the information to be "entombed" as well as preserved,
   since presumably it would not be accessible to any future systems that
   add capabilities to the manipulation of digital information.
   Nonetheless, we're too early in the digital preservation game to throw
   out any ideas too hastily. At this point every idea should receive
   serious and thoughtful consideration. - RT
   
   Sherwood, Lyn Elliot. "Discovering Buffalo Story Robes: A Case for
   Cross-Domain Information Strategies" Computers and the Humanities
   32(1)(1998): 57-64. - Buffalo Story Robes
   (http://www.glenbow.org/srobe/srobe.htm), a small digital exhibit from
   Canada's Glenbow Museum, is the inspiration for this author's insights
   into how to realize the potential of the digital library. Sherwood,
   the head of the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) found
   that this exhibit on the stories of the tribes of the Canadian plains
   had many related resources in government repositories, archives and
   libraries. The exhibit represents one small example of a current
   challenge in the digital environment: how to enable users to find
   related across domains. Sherwood acknowledges that "each of these
   communities is bound by its own traditions and classification schema."
   He asserts that effective access is dependent on increased
   collaboration among the many disciplines, and recommends looking
   closely at the role of authorities, thesauri and a process for mapping
   taxonomies across domains. Perhaps common sense, but essential if we
   are ever to realize the vision of the digital library as "an
   organized, selected or managed body of information." - LY
   
   Still, Julie and Vibiana Kassabian. "Searching for Bill and Jane:
   Electronic Full-Text Literature" Database 21 (5) (October/November
   1998): 15-24. - This month's cover story takes a closer look at
   electronic text resources available in English language prose with a
   specific focus on Shakespeare, Austen and nature writing. This survey
   is helpful not only for the references to major electronic guides and
   archives on literary resources (both free and fee-based), but also for
   detailed evaluations of individual resources. The authors recognize
   that "people do not usually use electronic texts to read works, but,
   rather to study them." Based on their review, there is ample material
   on Shakespeare for all types of users, some on Austen but very little
   on the genre of nature writing. Their conclusions? Available resources
   still focus on the most widely known or studied authors. And the value
   of these resources for scholars depends on whether they are based on
   authoritative editions and include value-added materials or search
   features. - LY

   Baca, Murtha, ed. Introduction to Metadata: Pathways to Digital
   Information Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Trust, 1998, ISBN
   0-89236-533-1. - This concise booklet follows the publication of the
   Getty's earlier Introduction to Imaging with the same small-sized
   format, introductory but not simplistic information, also priced at
   around $8. Just as the earlier publication was an introduction to
   digital imaging from many angles, this booklet introduces the reader
   to the world of standards, with an emphasis on semantic standards such
   as LCSH and AAT. It also provides an overview of different kinds of
   metadata such as record structures (MARC, EAD) and interchange formats
   and tools (SGML, Z39.50). - RR
   
   Day, Colin. "Digital Alternatives: Solving the Problem or Shifting the
   Costs?" Journal of Electronic Publishing 4 (September 1998).
   (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/04-01/day.html) - While some of us may
   be pinning all of our hopes on electronic publishing as the solution
   to the ills that currently plague academic publishing, Colin Day --
   writing about the academic mongraph -- has made it his responsibility
   to debunk those dreams. Publishers, he observes, are driven by the
   wishes of authors on the one hand and readers on the other. As far as
   he can tell, there is no pressure from either group for any type of
   product "other than the traditional codex, carefully edited, nicely
   produced, and energetically marketed." Digital publication of a
   monograph simply shifts the cost of production from the publisher to
   the scholar. - MP
   
   Sosteric, Mike. "At the Speed of Thought: Pursuing Non-Commercial
   Alternatives to Scholarly Communication" ARL Newsletter 200 (October
   1998). (http://www.arl.org/newsltr/200/sosteric.html) - By now, to
   talk of the crisis in scholarly communication and to express outrage
   over the escalating costs of journal literature is to sound like a
   broken record. And despite our greatest hopes that new technologies
   will be the solution to this crisis, it looks as if electronic
   publishing has only served as yet another opporutunity for commercial
   publishers to increase their profits; some commercial publishers (the
   few that are left in the increasingly monopolized world of academic
   publishing) have been know to force libraries to purchase both paper
   and electronic versions of their journals at rates that are even
   higher than the standard print costs. Libraries are virtually
   powerless to offset the practices of commercial publishers. At the
   same time, independent scholars are reluctant to take up the call to
   independent publication because too much work is involved, editorial
   duties are not highly regarded when it comes to tenure and advancement
   and there is no organizational support systematically advocating for a
   revolution in scholarly communication. This is where Mike Sosteric
   comes in. He is the director of the International Consortium of
   Alternative Academic Publication (ICAAP) (http://www.icaap.org/),
   whose mission is to "reduce the barriers to independent scholarly
   publication by bringing together scholars and institutions from all
   countries and all disciplines who are interested in bringing economic
   health back to the scholarly communication system." In order to
   fulfill its mission, the group will provide editorial assistance
   (HTML, copy editing, etc.), develop an apprenticeship program for
   young scholars to train them in the art and science of scholarly
   communication, and work to develop technical standards for electronic
   publishing. - MP
   
   Varian, Hal R. "The Future of Electronic Jounals" Journal of
   Electronic Publishing 4 (September 1998)
   (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/04-01/varian.html) - In this article,
   a reprint of a talk he delivered at the Scholarly Communication and
   Technology Conference (http://arl.cni.org/scomm/scat/) in April 1997,
   Varian looks at the economics of journal production in order to make
   some observations about the future of electronic journals. Electronic
   submission and distribution of manuscripts among editorial staff and
   reviewers can reduce the cost of journal production by almost
   one-half. Electronic distribution can bring further savings and has
   the value-added benefit of allowing precise monitoring of the number
   of hits per article, full-text search capabilities, and hyperlinkage
   to other relevant articles. Varian provides a provocative model for
   how electronic journals can solve what he calls the "filtering" issue.
   In the current scenario, more and more articles are being published.
   In other words, if you really want to publish something, chances are
   you can find someone to publish it; this indicates that the filtering
   function of peer review -- designed to ensure that only the work
   that's worthy gets published -- may not be working. While electronic
   publishing will only add to the information glut, Varian's model
   proposes that reviewers' anonymous evaluations be linked (and
   searchable) to the actual article. - MP

   Fleming, Jennifer. Web Navigation: Designing the User Experience
   Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1998. - Probably the second
   most common Web problem (the first being the "World Wide Wait"), is
   getting lost in webspace. This is the experience of becoming
   disoriented and not knowing which link to click to get to where you
   want to go. Many Web sites seem to almost delight in making us puzzle
   over what we can find at the site, or how to get around, or even the
   meaning of certain buttons or labels. Chin up, help has arrived.
   Fleming's book is chock-full of good information, advice, examples,
   diagrams, screen shots (both in full-color and black-and-white), and
   links. With this book, and the recently released Information
   Architecture for the World Wide Web (cited in the March 1998 issue of
   Current Cites), Web managers can no longer use ignorance as an excuse
   for creating unorganized piles of documents instead of useful Web
   sites. - RT

   Proceedings of Reference Services in a Digital Age Washington: Library
   of Congress, 1998 (http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/digiref/). - Don't come to
   the proceedings of the Library of Congress-sponsored institute
   "Reference Services in a Digital Age" to have your questions answered.
   It won't happen. Rather, what this site may help you to do is to raise
   some new questions. What _should_ reference services be like when
   increasingly the information our users need is in digital form, and it
   can be accessed without ever stepping foot in a library? How can we
   interject human (and humane) assistance into these new environments?
   What new roles are there for reference librarians? What new kinds of
   education and training are required to become proficient at providing
   service? These are important questions, and questions that institutes
   such as this can help us frame and deal with as a profession. - RT
