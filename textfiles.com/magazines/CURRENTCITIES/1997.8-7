   Green, David. "Beyond Word and Image: Networking Moving Images: More
   Than Just the "Movies"" D-Lib Magazine (July/August 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july97/07green.html). - This is the first
   part of a two part discussion of the issues and techniques involved in
   digitizing media other than text and image, namely moving images and
   sound. With the advent of streaming technologies on the Internet it
   has suddenly become possible to deliver what were once prohibitively
   large files to the user. It has happened none too soon, with the
   disintegration of old film stock and audio tape now a near epidemic. I
   found the author's discussion of film metadata/cataloging efforts
   particularly interesting, although his point that the British are so
   far ahead of us in this and other fields was somewhat depressing. This
   half of the report closes with a detailed examination of a particular
   genre of moving images, namely dance video. Apparently the dance
   community has been producing huge numbers of videos for both
   educational and documentary use for a number of years. Fortunately
   they have been actively involved in the development of cataloging
   standards all along and are actively pursuing methods of access for
   these dance research resources. This is an excellent article, with a
   number of resources and links for those considering the digitization
   of a moving image collection. I look forward to the next installment.

   Kirriemuir, John. "Clifford Lynch in Interview" Ariadne (10) (July
   1997) (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue10/clifford/). - In this
   interview with Lynch just before he joins the Coalition for Networked
   Information as its Executive Director, Kirriemuir plies him with
   questions about Z39.50, metadata, caching and mirroring. As usual,
   Lynch is well worth listening to, even if you miss experiencing his
   thoughtful way of delivery and his trademark leather jacket and black
   jeans. - RT
   
   Powell, Andy. "Dublin Core Management" Ariadne (10) (July 1997)
   (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue10/dublin/). - Powell has written an
   excellent guide to using Dublin Core metadata for a Web site, and
   offers good advice and tools for those who are interested in doing the
   same. Faithful readers of Current Cites have heard about the Dublin
   Core here for over a year. There's a reason for that. It looks to be
   our best hope for logically describing resources in a way that is both
   powerful and flexible. The specification is still a long way from
   completion, but as Powell describes in this article it is already a
   useful tool. The organization of which Powell is a part, the United
   Kingdom Office of Library Networking (UKOLN) has long been a leader in
   using the latest information technologies to solve library problems.
   It is thus no surprise that they have also been directly involved with
   developing the Dublin Core and tools that make it easy to use. If
   you've considered using the Dublin Core but you don't know how, this
   article should make it crystal clear. - RT
   
   Powell, Christina Kelleher, and Kerr, Nigel. "SGML Creation and
   Delivery: The Humanities Text Initiative" D-Lib Magazine (July/August
   1997) (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july97/humanities/07powell.html). -
   The Humanities Text Initiative, at the University of Michigan, is one
   of the largest SGML text creation projects in the country. In this
   overview the authors give a very succinct description of what the
   project has accomplished since 1994 and what they hope to achieve in
   the future. The focus is on the project's two major corpuses: The
   American Verse Project and Middle English Prose and Verse. It is
   fascinating to read just how much is involved in the creation of
   accurate texts that are also faithful to the format of the original. I
   was less impressed, however, with the project's facilities for
   searching this massive collection. The user is restricted to full text
   searches and even then such conveniences as text highlighting are not
   employed. The projects future goals are interesting but are somewhat
   one-dimensional. The focus here seems to be on giving the user access
   to the largest number of works possible, without giving much thought
   to the level of searching sophistication necessary to allow the user
   to navigate such a daunting sea of text. - KH
   
   Shaw, Elizabeth, and Blumson, Sarr. "Making of America: Online
   Searching and Page Presentation at the University of Michigan" D-Lib
   Magazine (July/August 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july97/america/07shaw.html). - Making of
   America is one of the larger digital library projects on the horizon.
   It is a joint Cornell/Michigan project focusing on American social
   history and slated to digitize 5000 volumes dating from 1850-1877.
   Making of America will both digitize images of the original document
   page by page as well as OCR and markup in SGML each of those pages.
   Searching is done both on the metadata collected about the document as
   well as it's full text. Display, strangely enough, seems to be only of
   the document image. This is fine for clearly printed works, but those
   that are less legible would be more useful if the SGML version was
   made available. The navigation of search results as well as image
   display both seem to be particularly well thought out here. The user
   is given sophisticated paging alternatives and a number of image size
   choices.This is obviously a well-funded project that ought to help
   establish a number of standards for digital libraries. - KH
   
  Information Technology & Society
   
   Browning, Graeme. "Electronic Democracy Online Update" Database 20:3
   (June/July 1997): 47-54
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/pempress/democracy/updates.html). - This
   article traces the use that grassroots organizations, party
   committees, and candidates made of the Internet as a campaigning tool
   in the November 1996 elections. One of its findings is that
   organizations and candidates with sites that allowed for interactive
   communication in the form of e-mail or chat rooms, were more
   successful than those with "static" sites. Although an exact
   assessment of the impact of Web sites on individual races is
   difficult, many political consultants are convinced that the presence
   or absence on the Web definitely influenced some of the results.
   Results of polls and studies conducted by various organizations also
   show that American voters were influenced considerably by information
   they found on the Web. The author predicts for the Internet as a
   political communications tool a development that is similar to that of
   television in the 1950's and 1960's. - CG
   
   Shenk, David. Data Smog: Surviving the Information Glut. HarperEdge:
   San Francisco, 1997. - Few people alive today would take exception to
   the premise upon which this book is based -- that we are awash in
   data. Data that may not result in useful information, knowledge or
   wisdom. However, the conclusions Shenk draws from this situation may
   not be as universally shared. The tenor of the book reminds me of
   Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Highway by
   Clifford Stoll (cited in the April 1995 issue of Current Cites, which
   raised the act of discovering that there is more to life than
   computers to the level of a religious experience. Shenk's "Laws of
   Data Smog" at the beginning of the book range from glib to
   incomprehensible, although they are at least explained inside. But the
   strength of this book lies in getting us to think critically about the
   "information revolution" and to consider carefully the possible
   casualties. - RT

   Coyle, Karen. Coyle's Information Highway Handbook: A Practical File
   on the New Information Order. Chicago: American Library Association,
   1997. - Karen Coyle has long been speaking at library and internet
   conferences about social and political issues relating to network
   access to information. Thus it should come as no surprise to those of
   us who have heard her speak that this slim but pithy volume is a great
   place to start investigating the topics she covers: economic models,
   copyright and intellectual property, privacy and intellectual freedom,
   censorship and filtering, and equitable access. She begins with
   introductory material on the "new information society" which is
   followed by a section on the "information highway." She focuses fairly
   exclusively on the United States, so non-U.S. readers will need to
   take this into account. Each section includes selected readings in
   full as well as citations for additional resources. As is the case for
   any book on a topic that changes as rapidly as the Internet, it is
   already slightly dated as it hits the shelves. She of course realizes
   this, and asserts in the introduction that even as it captures a
   moment frozen in the past it is nonetheless useful as background
   reading. She' s right. Coyle's assessment of the issues, as well as a
   number of readings that are often seminal if not timeless, make this
   book more valuable than as simply a snapshot of the state of networked
   information policy in the waning years of the century. And if she has
   done her job well enough, and the people who should pay attention do,
   then it will have served its purpose to help place its audience -- the
   library community -- actively in the debate over these important
   issues. - RT
   
   "Hands off the Internet" The Economist 344 (8024), July 5, 1997, p.
   15. - You would think that The Economist's natural fondness of free
   markets would yield an anti-regulation jeremiad against government
   forces who would do damage to free speech, intellectual property and
   fair use, and other features of the "self-regulating" culture of the
   Net. In fact, the editors give a more cautious view, citing the perils
   of both over- and under-regulation. Cultural difference lie at the
   crux of their thesis: not every country in the world will wish to
   support a virtual Dodge City, they argue; yet, a heavy government hand
   would stifle, even destroy the value of the Net. Instead, they argue
   for a careful approach which would recognize the radically different
   nature of "public discourse" in cyberspace, as we learn how to manage
   it (as well as ourselves). The summary of pro-regulation and
   anti-regulation value systems is succinct and very clear -- the
   article is worth reading just for this feature. - TH

   Efforts, Future Directions and Issues" Microcomputers for Information
   Management: Global Internetworking for Libraries. 13(3-4, Special
   Issue 1996): 217-236. - This article reports on recent developments in
   electronic and network-based information. It details activities
   surrounding the new version of Z39.50, a client/server-oriented
   protocol defining communication capabilities between information
   retrieval systems. Various user communities have developed profiles
   for the use of Z39.50 in their specific domain of application. One of
   them is GILS, the Government and Information Locator System, which
   defines the use of the protocol for access to government data. Other
   profiles are under development for accessing digital and museum
   collections. The article also treats the Z39.56 Serial
   Item/Contribution Identifier Standard which defines data elements used
   to identify issues of serials and articles in them. Also under
   devlopment is the ILL (Interlibrary Loan) protocol which is promoted
   by ARL's North American Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery
   (NAILDD) Project. In the field of character set standards, the author
   mentions ISO 10646 and Unicode and from among the text formatting
   standards, SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) and PDF
   (Portable Document Format). A standard used for commercial
   interactions is Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). It is designed for
   the electronic exchange of purchase orders, invoices, and other
   business-oriented documents.Needleman also reviews the Internet
   Engineering Task Force's (IETF) work on the definitions of HTTP, HTML,
   URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), URN (Uniform Resource Names), and
   URC (Uniform Resource Citation). In his conclusion, the author points
   out that an appropriate infrastructure to support the technologies
   defined in these standards is as important as the standards
   themselves. The article includes a bibliography and list of relevant
   URL's. - CG
