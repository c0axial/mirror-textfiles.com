Gaunt, Marianne I.  "Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities"  
InformationJTechnology and Libraries 13(1) (March 1994): 7-13. -- The 
Center for ElectronicJTexts in the Humanities (CETH) was developed 
out of a need to have a single center for the study of "effective 
methodologies for identifying, compiling, maintaining and using 
electronic texts." Gaunt's overview chronicles the history, activities 
and organization of this collaborative project between Princeton and 
Rutgers universities that evolved out of the Inventory of Machine-
Readable Texts for the Humanities. -- DR

Lowry, Anita K. "Electronic Texts in the Humanities: A Selected 
Bibliography" Information Technology and Libraries 13(1) (March 
1994):43-49. -- This bibliography lists resources describing the use of 
electronic texts in humanities scholarship. Included in the bibliography 
are references to articles dealing with computer-based methods of text 
analysis as well as a survey of guides and directories that cover 
electronic resources in the humanities. Also included is an extensive 
list of articles and electronic journals or newsletters dealing with the 
nature of electronic publishing. -- MP

Seaman, David M. "'A Library and Apparatus of Every Kind' : The 
Electronic Text Center at the University of Virginia" Information 
Technology and Libraries 13(1) (March 1994):15-19. -- This article 
describes, in brief, the University of Virginia's esteemed Center for 
Electronic Text. The Center provides access, creation and support for a 
large collection of online electronic texts held at the University of 
Virginia. One of the primary founding principles of the Center is that 
the electronic texts be easily accessible to all users. One of the ways that 
this goal is being met is the insistence on a single search program for all 
machine readable texts. Use and interest in the Center is greater that 
the staff expected. -- DR

Warner, Beth Forrest and David Barber. "Building the Digital Library: 
The University of Michigan's UMLibText Project" Information 
Technology and Libraries 13(1) (March 1994): 20-24. -- The UMLibText 
initiative at the University of Michigan is a textual-analysis project that 
also provides a local collection of electronic texts to the campus 
community. In describing the project, this article provides an in depth 
history of the project, a discussion of the resources offered, as well as 
discussion of access policies, user support and plans for its continued 
development.  -- MP

Yott, Patrick. "Mapping 1990 Census Data." Information Technology 
and Libraries 13(1): 63-70. -- Now that census material is available in 
electronic format, appropriately trained librarians using a combination 
of Geographic Information System (GIS) software packages, data 
extraction utilities, database programs, and spreadsheet software can 
provide patrons with a wide variety of choices for viewing census data.

Hypermedia & Multimedia

Berners-Lee, Tim. " Style Guide for Online Hypertext" [URL: 
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Overview.html] 
(telnet access also available from info.cern.ch). -- When creating a 
hypertext document, the most daunting obstacle for most is the 
technical markup language, be it learning HTML, the HyperCard 
programming language, or, for the brave, mastering the WinHelp 
engine (see Current Cites 5(2) February 1994 for the latter). However, if 
you've ever accessed a WWW home page that was 10 pages long and 
took as many minutes to load, you may have had time to think that 
perhaps more than technical knowledge is necessary to provide 
information in a useful and efficient manner. Writing clear prose is 
difficult enough, but the unique format of hypertext makes many 
additional conceptual demands in order to exploit its powerful 
information-conveying aspects. The Hypertext Style Guide provides a 
concise guide to the problem of how to organize hypertext documents. 
It was written with HTML documents in mind, but applies equally to 
any hypertext document type. The form of the guide, of course, conveys 
many of the principles of proper hypertext style. The title page is a clean 
23 lines of text, conveying information pertinent only to the subject of 
the header. No tangents are tolerated on a given page, so additional 
information is organized into 7 hyperlinked 'chapters' like a short 
book. Topics such as etiquette for server administrators, how long to 
make a page, and gearing information toward an audience are 
contained in this useful guide. -- RR

Leeds, Matthew. "Video Production Techniques: Tips for Creating Top-
Notch QuickTime Videos" MacWorld 11(6) (June 1994):104-106. -- If 
you need to compile video for presentations or public information 
workstations for your institution you will find this step-by-step guide 
to video production helpful. It was written using an example 
production created with Adobe Premiere 3.0 on the Macintosh, but the 
clear breakdown of steps involved in computer video production this 
article contains will be of use when using any program or platform. 
From creating a storyboard to preparing for showtime, this article lists 
the general steps one needs to consider when compiling video. Also 
included are additional "expert techniques" for the advanced editor. A 
sidebar recommends a minimum Macintosh configuration of a Quadra 
660AV, and either Super VHS or Hi-film formats. Much more useful 
for choosing the actual tools with which to apply these techniques 
however, would be the additional article in this issue, entitled "Video 
Editing Tools" by Avi Hoffer, p. 94-101. -- RR


Networks and Networking

Abbott, Tony, ed. _Internet World's on Internet 94_ Westport: 
Mecklermedia, 1994. -- Abbott and colleagues at Meckler (who produce 
the monthly Internet World) have assembled a print guide to Internet 
resources that is comprehensive but almost entirely duplicative of 
guides that are available through the Internet. With a 230-page listing 
of Discussion Lists, and large entries for Freenets, Campus-Wide 
Information Services, Electronic Journals, Usenet Newsgroups, and 
WAIS databases, this one-stop-guide approach may be a useful addition 
to your bookshelf. It is, of course, limited by its October, 1993 data 
collection date, and the "difficulties of how to accomplish [basic] 
Internet communications functions" (pg. xix). This should be valuable 
as a guide to starting points and as a reference for that resource you're 
sure you heard about but whose location has escaped. -- JLO

Barron, Billy. "A Brief Comparison of Public Domain SLIP/PPP Drivers 
for MS-DOS" ConneXions: The Interoperability Report 8(6) (June 
1994):16-18. -- This concise article compares the speed of a number of 
publicly available Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) and Point-to-
Point Protocol (PPP) drivers for establishing direct Internet connections 
over a serial line to a PC running MS-DOS.  Barron concluded that 
from the packages he reviewed, only Slipper, Cslipper, and EtherPPP 
were worthy of further consideration. -- RT

Hughes, Kevin. "Entering the World-Wide Web: A Guide to 
Cyberspace" Ver 6.1, May 20, 1994. Enterprise Integration Technologies. 
Postscript copy available [URL: ftp://ftp.eit.com/pub/web.guide] -- 
Hughes has constructed a 31-page overview of the Web with section 
titles that range from "What is the World-Wide Web?" to "A 
Hypermedia Timeline." In addition to being an excellent introductory 
description of the Web that includes graphics (for example, showing 
the connection between a Mosaic screen and the HTML document 
underlying it), the document has a useful list of "Interesting Places on 
the Web" and a combined Index and Glossary. If the frequent updating 
continues (there have been five "versions" in less than one year), this 
could prove to be a favorite for an introduction to the World-Wide 
Web. -- JLO

Lohr, Steve. "Data Highway Ignoring Poor, Study Charges" The New 
York Times (May 24, 1994): A1. -- Consumer and civil rights groups 
warn that without clear-cut government rules to assure equal access, 
regional telephone companies will continue to overlook poorer 
neighborhoods and minority populations as they plan for the 
installation of the advanced communications networks necessary to 
access new information services.  -- MP

Maloff, Joel. "The Business Value of Internetworking," Internet World 
5(5) (July/August 1994):34-39.  -- This article describes the major reasons 
why companies may wish to connect to the Internet (after first 
describing how costly it could be). These reasons as outlined by Maloff 
are access to rare remote devices (e.g., supercomputers, optical disc 
reproduction systems, etc.), databases, and "collaborative activities." --

NSF Network News 1(1) (March/April 1994) Available bi-monthly in 
electronic and print formats from InterNIC Information Services. Hard 
copy subscriptions free in the U.S. and $30.00 internationally; send e-
mail to newsletter-request@internic.net. [URL: 
http://www.internic.net/newsletter]. -- As of May 1, 1994, this 
newsletter, self-described as seeking to "educate Internet users about 
network issues, resources, and tools; announce new and innovative 
uses of the Internet; and inform the Internet community of the 
activities of the InterNIC," (copyright notice, each issue), is available as 
a World-Wide Web document from the _InfoGuide_, the InterNIC's 
online information server. The March/April 1994 issue describes the 
new NSFNet architecture and a new Network Information Center for 
the Asia-Pacific Region, announces a new gopher indexing service 
from Bunyip, and presents network connectivity maps. The InterNIC 
provides directory and database services newsletter, are well worth 
scanning. -- JLO

Resnick, Rosalind. "Newspapers on the Net" Internet World 5(5) 
(July/August 1994):69-73. -- A description of several projects to offer 
newspapers on the Internet. A sidebar includes access information on 
nine newspapers ranging from the Municipal Reporter of Oslo, 
Norway to USA Today. -- RT

Seabrook, John. "My First Flame" The New Yorker 70(16) (June 6, 
1994):70-79. -- Occasional technology reporter for the New Yorker, 
Seabrook explores the darker side of e-mail by describing his own 
experiences as the recipient of a particularly nasty message. Insulting 
and offensive messages sent over the Internet, or "flames," as they are 
popularly known, have become an unpleasant (if not inevitable) by-
product of a communication system that is otherwise praised for its 
democratic nature. Seabrook also describes his experience with a 
mysterious e-mail-eating virus and his quest to find out if the virus 
was related to the "flame." While the reader never does learn the 
source of this virus, Seabrook's article does offer an informal, yet 
provocative, analysis of Internet culture and some of the security issues 
related to it. -- MP

Shah, Rawn. "Viewing the Internet through Microsoft Windows" 
Internet World 5(4) (June 1994):86-90. -- Many guides, manuals, and 
commentaries on the Internet look through UNIX-colored glasses. For 
those who have or are contemplating a direct connection through 
Microsoft Windows, Shah's article is a valuable overview. Without 
going into the detail that a LAN administrator would need, Shah 
outlines the software components, from network interface drivers to 
Internet applications,  which are necessary for direct or SLIP connection 
and are available as commercial products or as freeware. The article 
ends with a "Quick List of Resources" -- addresses of electronic sites and 
vendors -- which will take one further down the road to Windows 
Internet connectivity. -- JLO

Thorell, Lisa. "Doing Business on the Internet -- Case Studies: DEC, 
Silicon Graphics, and Sun" Internet World 5(5) (July/August 1994):52-
63. The Internetworking histories of the companies in the title of the 
article are used to illustrate how companies are using the Internet to 
their advantage. The cases themselves interesting, but the issues they 
illustrate are even more so. Thorell capably and insightfully draws out 
these issues in one of the best articles on business use of the Internet 
this reviewer has read. -- RT

Pastine, Maureen and Carolyn Kacena. "Library Automation, 
Networking, and Other Online and New Technology Costs in 
Academic Libraries" Library Trends 42(3) (Winter 1994):524-533. -- New 
library technology requires an expanded budget that incorporates not 
only the more technologically oriented methods of operation and 
services but also takes into account such overlooked costs as updating 
cabling and wiring, purchasing new instructional technologies, 
training staff and users, providing ergonomic furniture for staff, hiring 
new types of employees trained to handle technological problems, 
increasing security, network membership fees and the purchase of 
licensing agreements. In order to cope with these costs, the authors 
stress the importance of developing a strategic plan that incorporates 
intensive long-range planning and budgeting programs. As a method 
to offset some of the costs, the authors suggest sharing costs through 
memberships in consortia, applying for state and federal grants, and 
obtaining legislation for funding. -- MP

Wolf, Milton, et. al. "Future Possibilities in Information Technology 
and Access" Information Technology and Libraries 13(1) (March 
1994):51-61. -- The Imagineering Interest Group of LITA sponsors a 
series of talks at the ALA annual conference every year in which they 
invite noted guests to imagine the future as it pertains to the 
information world. This highly readable and thought-provoking article 
is a modified transcript of the talks by science fiction writers Connie 
Willis and David Brin presented at the 1993 conference in New 
Orleans. In a speech titled "Jurassic Park and Al Jolson: Thinking about 
the Information Revolution," Willis suggests that a healthy dose of 
"technophobia" and an awareness of some of technology's side effects 
will be important in carrying out the information revolution. Also 
invoking some of side effects of technology, David Brin examines the 
role of freedom and privacy within the information revolution in his 
presentation titled "The Good and the Bad: Outlines of Tomorrow."  --
