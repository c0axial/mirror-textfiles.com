Note From the Editor: Current Cites, along with a number of 
other databases are being made available for online searching 
using the BRS Search system by the Coalition for Networked 
Information.  To access the system, telnet to a.cni.org 
(URL=telnet://brsuser@a.cni.org) or go through the Coalition 
gopher (gopher to gopher.cni.org 70, select Coalition BRS-
SEARCH Services, Search Coalition Databases; URL=gopher://
gopher.cni.org 70/Coalition BRS-SEARCH Services?Search 
Coalition Databases) and login as "brsuser."  From there you 
may select from the seven databases currently available: 
Current Cites; postings from PACS-L@UHUPVM1, NETTRAIN@UBVM, 
CNI-BIGIDEAS, CNI-COPYRIGHT, CNI-DIRECTORIES; and the TOPNODE 
Directory Resource.  This implementation of the BRS Search 
system supports menu-driven searching, command-line searching, 
and printing and e-mailing of search results. 

Current Cites is also implementing Uniform Resource Locators 
(URLs).  These labels are intended to provide information on 
the location of electronic resources at the time of the 
writing of the citation.  URLs will be indicated by the 
notation: "URL=".  The source for the definition of the URL 
is the Internet Draft of 30 March 1993 written by Tim Berners-
Lee and published by the IETF URL Working Group [available via 
gopher as text and PostScript (draft-ietf-uri-url-00.txt and 
draft-ietf-uri-url-00.ps) by searching Veronica using the term 
"URL"].  For those who are unfamiliar with URLs, they provide 
information on the location of an instance of a networked 
document.  They are formulated so that they may be easily 
readable by computer and human alike.  Simply, the URL is the 
concatenation of the access scheme, the host location, the file 
or path, and any mode of access, (such as "search"). - DR

Hyper- and Mulimedia

Lemke, J. L. "Hypermedia and Higher Education" Interpersonal
Computing and Technology 1(2) (April 1993) [available via e-mail
from LISTSERV@GWUVM.BITNET with the command GET LEMKE IPCTV1N2].
The author provides a useful perspective on the "possible futures 
for scholarly hypermedia literacy" and suggests the range of 
impacts that hypermedia may have on education.  This insightful 
paper explores the changes brought on by scholarly dialog about a 
subject as opposed to the present "curricular" models of learning.

Information Transfer

Brody, Roberta. "End-Users In 1993: After a Decade" ONLINE 17(3) 
(May 1993):66-69.  Database producers, software publishers, and 
information professionals are developing systems in response to 
the "end-user revolution in information access."  Two corporate 
librarians have designed and developed a multifunction front end 
system using Lotus Notes (described in this issue). - VR
 
Delfino, Erik. "Getting an Electronic Bulletin Board System Up
and Running" ONLINE 17(3) (May 1993):106-108.  Among the issues
to consider when selecting an electronic bulletin board system
(BBS) software are the skill level of the intended audience,
the purpose of the bulletin board, security requirements, menu
design, file transfer protocols, maintenance and backup.  A
selected list of BBS software is provided.
 
Liberman, Kristen and Jane L. Rich. "Lotus Notes Databases: The
Foundation of a Virtual Library" Database 16(3) (June 1993):33-
46.  Liberman and Rich have developed a virtual library
environment for the end-user using Lotus Notes, a workgroup
software product.  With Hoover (SandPoint Corporation), a Lotus 
Notes add-in program, and Company Profiles Plus, a Hoover-
enabled product, end-users are able to access, track, and 
organize information, including search databases, retrieve
documents, and create on-demand profiles of companies. - VR 
 
Krumenaker, Larry. "Virtual Libraries, Complete with Journals, 
Get Real" Science 260(5111) (May 21, 1993):1066-1067.  
Krumenaker describes the CORE system for electronic retrieval of 
journal literature as an example of a virtual library (or at 
least a pat of one).  The text of articles stored using CORE can 
be searched, but graphics are also included, though stored 
separately on optical discs.  Included in this discussion is an 
examination of some of the pros and cons of such a search and 
display system. - DR

Stigleman, Sue. "Papyrus: Good Bibliographic Value at a
Reasonable Price" Database 16(3) (June 1993):82-87.  By making a
plea to developers to create more flexible bibliographic 
software, Stigleman provides us with more than a review of this
bibliographic formatting software package and its CD-ROMs
importing functions, its Boolean searching capabilities, and its 
word processors support. - VR 
 
Stover, Mark. "PsychNet: A Niche Network for Psychology" ONLINE
17(3) (May 1993):74-81.  PsychNet, a software package which 
combines a telecommunications module, a text editor, e-mail, 
and database search capabilities, provides information services, 
forums, and document retrieval in the field of Psychology.  While 
still underdeveloped, and the information it provides is 
available online from other sources, Stover describes it as an 
"innovative and promising concept...in the future of information 
retrieval and document delivery." Will these kinds of customized
packages be the wave of the future? - VR
 

Networks and Networking

"Accessing the Federal Government" EFFector Online 5(10) (June 
11, 1993) [available via anonymous ftp, URL=ftp://ftp.eff.org/
pub/EFF/newsletters/effector5.10].  This issue of EFFector 
Online is devoted to the recent announcements of e-mail access 
to the President, the Vice-President, a number of congressional 
representatives.  There is also information on accessing other 
government agencies and information via the Internet and BITNET 
and a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) about accessing 
the Federal government electronically.  As expected, the 
President's address actually is "PRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV". - DR

Anderson, Christopher. "The Rocky Road to a Data Highway" Science 
260(5111) (May 21, 1993):1064-1065.  Anderson provides a brief 
analysis of the National Science Foundation's (NSF) plans for the 
NSFNet backbone which, if implemented, would preserve the high-
speed backbone to high-end users who require very high bandwidth.  
This would mean that the typical member of the research and 
education community would need to rely on a commercial network 
service provider. [Before  pandemonium erupts, it should be 
remembered that most research and education users do not pay the 
existing fees to the regional networks, but rely on their 
institutions to do so.]  In answer to concerns this proposal has 
raised, Stephen Wolff, director of the NSF, explained that the 
NSF might allow researcher to charge networking costs to their 
NSF grants and institutions to bill their indirect cost accounts. 
- DR

Atkinson, Ross. "Networks, Hypertext, and Academic Information 
Services: Some Longer-Range Implications" College & Research 
Libraries 54(3) (May 1993):199-215.  Atkinson provides a 
fascinating examination of the effects of a fully mature 
networked hypertext system of scholarly communication.  Atkinson 
contends that librarians and other information professionals must 
plan and act now to participate in the developing networked 
environment.  Among the developments the author foresees are: 
three dimensional texts, the network as textual canon, an 
increase in unreferreed publishing, and the necessity of 
information services to provide selection and evaluation of 
documents. - DR

Bauwens, Michel. "Corporate Cybrary Networks: An Idea Whose Time 
Has Come?" The Internet Business Journal 1(1) (June/July 1993):
25-27.  Baumens describes the model of a virtual library system 
that he has begun implementing at BP Nutrition.  In this model, 
the cybrarian (librarian in cyberspace) places him or herself in 
the center of a collaborative environment, providing information 
to user where and when desired.  In this way, the cybrarian can 
fully participate in an innovative and user-centered 
organization. - DR

Caplan, Priscilla. "Cataloging Internet Resources."  The Public-
Access Computer Systems Review 4(2) (1993): 61-66 (available by
sending the following e-mail message to LISTSERV@ UHUPVM1.BITNET: 
GET CAPLAN PRV4N2).  Caplan describes the work of MARBI, the 
American Library Association committee which has been revising 
USMARC rules to accommodate networked resources.  In addition to 
describing these new rules, Caplan also explains how the Internet 
Engineering Task Force Uniform Resource Numbers, Identifiers, and 
Locators (URN, URI, and URL) relate to the new USMARC format.  
Clearly this is an issue crucial to the ongoing development of 
libraries. - DR

Cozzolino, Thomas J. and Thomas H. Pierce. "Internet User Survey 
Results" The Internet Business Journal 1(1) (June/July 1993):23-
24.  The authors present their survey of Internet use in business 
(primarily chemical companies).  Not too surprisingly, those that 
responded to the survey felt that the Internet was a very 
valuable tool in their work. - DR

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "NSF Releases Long-Awaited Plan to Reduce US 
Role in the Internet" The Chronicle of Higher Education 39(38) 
(May 26, 1993):A17.  DeLoughry describes the NSF solicitation for 
bids from network service providers that would change the funding 
model of research and education networking in the US.  In the 
proposal, regional networks would no longer use the NSFNet 
backbone, but contract lines from commercial telecommunications 
providers.  The NSF would provide funding directly to 
institutions to help pay for networking and reserve the NSFNet 
for supercomputing applications (its original intended purpose). 
- DR

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Regional Networks Prepare for change in the 
Internet" The Chronicle of Higher Education 39(40) (June 9, 
1993):A16.  Regional networks respond to the change in NSF 
networking policy by joining forces and creating their own 
commercial network service - the Corporation for Regional and 
Enterprise Networking (COREN).  Since these networks have long-
standing relations with research and education networkers (in 
some cases, they are one and the same), many believe that the new 
company will be more attractive to educational institutions than 
traditional commercial providers.  COREN has reached agreement 
with MCI Telecommunications for backbone service that will 
include asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), a key method for 
providing high-bandwidth service. - DR

"EFF Comments to the NIST (the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology)" EFFector Online 5(9) (May 28, 1993) [available 
via anonymous ftp, URL=ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/newsletters/
effector5.09].  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) 
expressed its concerns about the Clinton Administration's 
"clipper chip" proposal, a voluntary, government controlled data 
encryption system.  Among their concerns are questions about 
whether the system will in fact remain voluntary (that is, will 
it become the only legal encryption scheme for US users), and if 
not, would the government then be imposing unconstitutional 
restraints on speech.  In addition, the EFF has 4th and 5th 
Amendment concerns, as well as concerns about the involvement of 
the National Security Agency in the proposed scheme. - DR

Feeney, Ann. "Internet Applications: Stumpers-L" Computers in 
Libraries 13(5) (May 1993):40-42.  Feeney founded the electronic 
conference STUMPERS-L as library school student as a forum for 
solving really tough reference questions.  In this article the 
founder describes the success of the list and notes that as the 
Internet reaches more people, the possibilities for its use 
increase. - DR

Larribeau, Robert, Jr. "The Rise of Commercialization of the 
Internet" The Internet Business Journal 1(1) (June/July 1993):10-
12.  An independent network consultant, Larribeau provides a very 
lucid description of the development of commercial network 
service providers and services.  Not only is this information 
interesting in its own right, but it also helps inform the 
current discussion of the future of the Internet. - DR

Locke, Christopher. "RFC/FYI - Editorial" The Internet Business 
Journal 1(1) (June/July 1993):3-4.  Locke introduces the premier 
issue of The Internet Business Journal by making the argument 
that businesses that want to remain competitive must participate 
in the developing communications revolution.  According to Locke, 
this means that they will need an Internet address: "Companies 
that have no presence in this new arena will quickly fade from 
view." - DR

Nickerson, Gord. "The Virtual Reference Library" Computers in 
Libraries 13(5) (May 1993):37-40.  Nickerson describes the 
history of the highly successful Internet Hunt which is issued 
each month by Rick Gates of the University of California at Santa 
Barbara.  The Hunt is a list of could-be reference question that 
participants vie to be the first to answer.  Also included in 
this account is information on locating previously issued Hunts 
and their answers. - DR

"NIST Crypto Resolutions" distributed on CPSR@GWUVM.BITNET (June 
4, 1993).  The Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory 
Board of the National Institute of Standards and Technology says 
that the Clinton Administration's "clipper chip" proposal has too 
many unresolved issues to be implemented beyond the executive 
branch of the US government.  They also recommend that there be 
further investigation and discussion of the public policy and 
technology issues surrounding this particular encryption scheme 
as well as others. - DR

Notess, Greg R. "Using Gophers to Burrow Throughout the Net" 
ONLINE 17(3) (May 1993):100-102.  Notess describes how using the 
Internet Gopher can make an Internet connection more valuable.  
Unlike most articles on the subject, however, Notess provides 
constructive criticism of the interface. - DR

Roberts, Michael M. "A Two-Lane Road Is Not a Superhighway" 
EDUCOM Review 28(3) (May/June 1993):12-13 [available via 
anonymous ftp, URL=ftp://educom.edu/pub/EDUCOM-Review-1993/
EDUCOM-Review-May93-Roberts].  Roberts argues that the push to 
make ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) service 
ubiquitous is misguided and that the public policy effort to 
create a national data superhighway should be focused on ATM/
SONET (Asynchronous Transmission Mode/Synchronous Optical 
Network) technology.  While ISDN can be made available sooner to 
a larger number of users, Roberts writes that the improved 
bandwidth of ATM/SONET (2,000 times greater) more than makes up 
for the delay in implementation of a digital network. - DR

Sakkas, Lee. "Politics on the Internet" Interpersonal Computing 
and Technology 1(2) (April 1993) [available from LISTSERV@
GUVM.BITNET by sending the e-mail message: GET SAKKAS IPCTV1N2].  
In what many consider to be an important change in political 
history, the 1992 US Presidential campaign went online.  One 
instance of this was the establishment of three BITNET 
discussion lists: CLINTON, BUSH, and PEROT.  The founder of 
these lists describes the motivation behind them, their history, 
and ongoing development.  In addition, Sakkas describes the ways 
in which various list subscribers participated and benefited from 
the lists and writes that "We were witnesses to the beginning of 
what I believe will be recognized as a communications 
revolution." - DR

Stockman, Bernhard. "EBONE: The European Internet Backbone" 
ConneXions 7(5) (May 1993):2-8.  Stockman describes the newest 
addition to European networking: the IP-based EBONE, the European 
Internet backbone.  Started in 1992 with the full participation 
of commercial providers, EBONE has been so popular that certain 
sections of the network have already experienced service 
degradation due to excess traffic.  This article covers the 
history, organization, and future plans of the backbone. - DR

Davis, Trisha L. "Acquisition of CD-ROM Databases for Local Area
Networks" The Journal of Academic Librarianship 19(2) (May 1993):
68-71.  This article examines the factors involved in the 
acquisition of CD-ROM databases for local area networks (LANs), 
written from the perspective of an acquisitions librarian.  The 
marriage of LAN technology and CD-ROM products, the author 
contends, provide the opportunity for the acquisitions librarian 
to develop a new role that links collection development,
technical services, and CD-ROM publishers.  Among the new 
challenges that need to be faced are the widely varying 
subscription and pricing options, complicated licensing issues 
that extend the order process, and a thorough understanding of 
CD-ROM networking technology. - TR

EDUCOM Review 28(3) (May/June 1993) special section devoted to 
EDUCOM's Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for Electronic 
Learners which is still under development [availabe via
anonymous ftp, URL=ftp://educom.edu/pub/EDUCOM-Review-1993/].  
These articles are intended as an investigation of the ethical 
issues surrounding electronic learning and the ways that the 
Bill addresses them.  EDUCOM plans to formally adopt the Bill by 
the end of this year.

o	"Bill of Rights and Responsibilities for Electronic 
Learners," pp. 24-27.  An introduction to the Bill and a copy 
of the complete text of the Bill as it stands to date.  Very 
briefly: article I states that all individuals have the right of 
access to information and computing resources and the required 
training to use such resources; article II states that 
individuals are responsible for their own actions; article III 
states that educational institutions must have access to 
information resources in the way that individuals do; and article 
IV states that institutions have the responsibility to exercise 
their rights in a way that promotes their own mission as well as 
the values of society at large.

o	Connolly, Frank W. and Chuck Schneebeck. "The Community 
of Electronic Learners," pp. 36-37.  Connolly and Schneebeck 
explain what the community of electronic learners is, and the 
implications of the community of some of the ethical issues that 
come to the fore in such a community.

o	Connolly, Frank W. and Sally Webster. "New Policies for 
an Evolving Future," pp. 28-30.  Connolly and Webster, co-chairs 
of the EDUCOM committee that developed the Bill, provide and 
introduction to the Bill and explain the reasons behind its 
various parts.

o	Spetalnick, Terrie. "Privacy in the Electronic 
Community," pp. 38-40.  Spetalnick notes that the shift of 
personal and professional data from print to electronic format 
brings a whole slew of privacy issues with it.  In the academic 
community this issue is complicated by the fact that most of this 
information is created and stored on institution-owned equipment.  
Spetalnick examines how the EDUCOM Bill addresses these issues so 
as to protect individual rights.

o	Stager, Susan. "Individual Rights Versus Institutional 
Responsibilities," pp. 41-44.  Stager examines areas where the 
rights and responsibilities of individuals might clash with those 
of the institution of learning.  Her intent is to provoke a 
discussion  that will help make the Bill a document that helps to 
resolve such conflicts.

o	Tannenbaum, Robert S. "A Code of Rights and 
Responsibilities for Access to Computing Resources," pp. 19-22.  
Tannenbaum, the editor of this section of the Review, describes 
the work of a task force he chaired at the University of Kentucky 
that was charged with developing a local code of computer ethics.

o	Van Bergen, Marilyn. "Electronic Citizenship and Social 
Responsibility," pp. 45-47.  Van Bergen begins her examination of 
social responsibility by warning readers that the seeming 
ubiquitousness of technology should not taken as reason to rest 
easy.  Van Bergen writes: "As an electronic citizen, each of us 
has the right and the responsibility to create a technology and a 
society that reflect our values." 

o	Webster, Sally, and Frank W. Connolly. "Responsible 
Citizenship in the Electronic Community," pp. 32-35.  Webster and 
Connolly explain how the Bill works to preserve what are 
considered traditional values in education: equality of access to 
resources; active, responsible citizenship; control over personal 
information; freedom of speech; respect for the work of others; 
responsibility to conserve and protect limited resources. - DR

Gleick, James. "The Telephone Transformed - Into Almost Anything" 
The New York Times (May 16, 1993):6:26-29, 50, 53-56, 62, 64.  
Gleick examines some of the social issues surrounding the 
convergence of the telephone, computer, television, and other 
related appliances.  Already e-mail and voice mail have 
transformed much of American business, and along the way have 
created new styles of communication.  Glieck covers the broad 
range of modern communications services without missing important 
details. - DR
