Hypermedia and Multimedia

Lamont, Judith. "Career Corner: Multimedia Training Opportunities" 
Sigcat DISCourse 8(3) (March/April 1994):1,8-10. -- Multimedia 
once belonged to a rarefied world limited by exotic and expensive
hardware, a dearth of real-world uses, and few experts. This has 
been changing, and as it does, so do the opportunities for growth 
in this field of the computing industry. In the private sector, 
workers are needed in the field of creating and marketing commercial 
multimedia titles on CD-ROM and in the entertainment industry. In 
the public sphere, expertise is needed in evaluation, implementation, 
and support for multimedia endeavors, often in an educational setting. 
This article gives useful hints on what to look for in multimedia
training, such as selecting a program with connections to industry and
government to develop professional contacts as well as gain technical 
skills. Just as useful is the guide to 12 multimedia training programs 
across the country with brief descriptions of the programs, and 
addresses. -- RR

Millison, Doug. "The 800-Pound Gorilla" Computer Currents 11(24):80-82.
-- They've been called IBM-clones, until IBM was the one doing the 
cloning. They've been called DOS machines, until Windows. Now Intel is 
hoping you'll just call them Intel PC's. One strategy Intel is taking 
to position themselves centrally to PC architecture is to begin 
designing more than chips; in fact they are now creating some very 
useful hardware-independent multimedia standards, some of them free. 
Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) has teams around the world trying to make 
the PC more user-friendly by creating standards for multimedia, and in 
doing so also hopes to make PC's painless enough to become the consumer
electronic device of choice in the wired home of the future, contrary 
to predictions of set top boxes and powered-up game boys. Intel has made 
progress in speeding up the bottleneck of old ISA architecture, and much 
easier addition of peripherals and add-ons via Plug and Play. Specifically, 
Intel's contributions to multimedia include Indeo, a system-level video 
compression/decompression technology, parallel to Quicktime, that would 
come free with every PC. This software-only solution will be able to access 
color conversion and graphics acceleration found even on cheap Super VGA 
cards, and will also allow 3-D graphics capabilities. One of the main 
hindrances to adoption of multimedia software and content has been lack of 
standards, so if Intel's multimedia architectures are well-conceived 
everyone stands to benefit. -- RR 


NETWORKS AND NETWORKING

Dearth, Jeffrey L. and Paul J. Vizza. "Browser's Paradise: How the
Electronic Newsstand is Redefining the Art of Magazine Marketing"
EDUCOM Review 29(3) (May/June 1994):12-15. -- Two key staffers at 
The New Republic recount how they created the Electronic Newsstand
-- the Internet equivalent of the corner magazine and newspaper hut.
Originally created to attract new subscribers to The New Republic,
it has since grown to include the tables of contents, selected articles,
and general information about more than eighty magazines, including the 
New Yorker, Discover, National Review, Outside, American Demographics, 
Yoga Journal and others. This article is a brief and interesting case 
history of a commercial use of the Internet that avoids mass-distributed 
advertising. -- RT

Hahn, Harley and Rick Stout. _The Internet Yellow Pages_ Berkeley:
Osborne McGraw-Hill, 1994. -- Harley and Stout have created what is 
already becoming one of the most popular references to Internet 
resources. Their _Yellow Pages_ has a comprehensive table of contents 
and index and follows the general model of yellow pages with alphabetic 
subject entries. In addition to lists of Newsgroups and Discussion lists, 
which are available in many other resource guides, the authors have made 
this guide enjoyable to browse. There are sample images with their ftp 
sites, excerpts from discussion lists, Frequently Asked Question documents, 
and other tidbits scattered throughout. Though no guide can be truly 
comprehensive, this one comes close and will work as a starting point for 
some time. Note that there is virtually no instructional information here, 
only pointers to resources. -- JLO

Hawkins, Brian L. "Planning for the National Electronic Library." EDUCOM 
Review 29(3) (May/June 1994):19-29. -- Hawkins' well-written analysis points 
out that the Library and Academic Communities at large have no 
well-articulated plan to create the global electronic library of the 
future. The historical and organizational reasons for this are described 
but the focus of the article is on examining the range of possible 
structural and organizational models that could be adopted to move toward 
the large-scale electronic library. While not everyone may agree with the 
author's endorsement of a nonprofit corporation model, his call for careful 
thinking of the constraints and opportunities facing academic and library 
use of new technology is worth the time. -- JLO

Jaffe, Lee David.  _Introducing the Internet: A Trainer's Workshop_
Berkeley: Library Solutions Press, 1994. The first in the new Library
Solutions Press "Internet Workshop Series," this work will be particularly
useful for those already familiar with the Internet who must now
teach what they know to others. The book provides a textual overview of
what a trainer might want to cover in an introductory Internet class in
addition to guidelines on how to structure the class and advice on how to
deal with tricky segments. The book also provides supporting material in
the form of sample handouts including a glossary, a bibliography, e-mail
guidelines, and a list of selected telnet and FTP sites. Among the more
valuable aspect of this workbook are the sample presentation slides that
are included. Users are encouraged to make overheads from these simple, 
graphically effective slides; the PLUS edition of _Introducing the
Internet_, includes diskettes (viewable on either Mac or DOS-based
computers) containing a PowerPoint presentation of the slides which users
can adapt to their own personal style or to a specific teaching situation.
The instructional infrastructure provided by Jaffe's book will save anyone
new to teaching the Internet hours of time and stress. -- MP

Kelley, Brian. "Publishing Information Globally: Becoming an Information
Provider on the World Wide Web." Available via World Wide Web at
[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ucs/people/BKelly/aberdeen_paper.html] in postscript 
and rich text (RTF) format. -- Kelley has taken his experience from the 
University of Leeds and produced a paper that not only describes their 
experiences in mounting World Wide Web information, but also provides an 
overview of the technology and of the issues involved. With figures and 
reasonable section headings, this material could be adapted to help explain 
the Web to others or to plan the development of a Web server. -- JLO

King, Kenneth M. "BITNET III: The Spirit of Cooperation Continues," EDUCOM 
Review 29(3) (May/June 1994):41-43. -- In this brief piece, the executive 
director of the Corporation for Research and Educational Networking (CREN) 
outlines plans for the third major stage of BITNET development. Included is 
a project to build a "global dial-up networking infrastructure" that will
enable traveling faculty, students, staff, and alumni to dial into their home 
institution with full Internet connectivity through a local phone call. -- RT

Krol, Ed. _The Whole Internet: User's Guide & Catalog_ 2nd ed. Sebastopol, CA: 
O'Reilly & Associates, 1994. The second edition of Krol's very popular book 
continues to be a valuable Internet reference tool for the beginning or 
intermediate user. This edition is more substantial (a third larger) and 
even more useful than his first. In it Krol has answered one of the only
criticisms of his first edition by including an appendix called "UNIX Primer" 
designed to be used as a tutorial for those not familiar with the UNIX 
operating system. Krol has also added a section in the chapter on electronic 
mail about Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) which enable one to 
attach non-text files to e-mail messages. The MIME example given uses the 
popular e-mail program pine. The entries in the catalog have been updated and 
have almost doubled in number and include telnet, ftp and www sites for 
everything from aeronautics to the Internet white pages. -- DR

Robison, David F.W. _All About Internet FTP: Learning and Teaching to
Transfer Files on the Internet_ Berkeley, Library Solutions Press, 1994.
Another in the "Internet Workshop Series," this volume, designed as both a
textbook for students as well as a manual for teachers, offers a lucid
overview of Internet FTP. As a tool for students, the workbook includes a
description of FTP, a series of exercises, sample FTP sessions as well as
a glossary, a list of commands, and a list to archie sites. For the
instructor, the text of the book can serve as a guide for what to cover in
a classroom lecture and the glossary and other lists can be used as
handouts. The section of sample presentation slides are designed to be
copied onto transparencies and presented during the lecture; the PLUS
edition of the book includes a PowerPoint version of the slide
presentation on disk (for either Mac or DOS-based computers) and
instructors are encouraged to adapt the slides.  Also valuable is a
section that provides tips for trainers and a lesson plan, divided into
modules that allow instructors to pick and choose according to their own
needs. Robison notes that FTP tends to be one of the more difficult
aspects of the Internet for students to understand; his book, however,
provides a clear and accessible explanation of this sometimes 
overwhelming topic. - MP


OPTICAL DISC TECHNOLOGIES

Breeding, Marshall. "The Lay of the LAN" CD-ROM World 9(5) (May 1994):
54-57. -- CD-ROM networking expert Breeding discusses the plethora of
networking options for CD-ROMs, seeking to match capabilities and 
features with performance expectations, organizational requirements, 
existing networks and budget considerations. Included is a fact-filled 
sidebar outlining 'notable networking products.' -- TR

Hyon, Jason. "A Standard for Writing Recordable CDs" Sigcat DISCourse 
8(3) (March/April 1994):1, 3-7. -- Typical of nearly any discussion 
of standards, this article is a fairly technical description of the 
international standard which allows updates to recordable CDs while
maintaining cross-platform data exchange. The existing standard for
CD-ROM (ISO 9660) does not support the feature to incrementally add 
information to a CD-ROM disc, generally known as multisession capa-
bility. This limitation has been a major problem since the advent of
Kodak Photo CDs, which allows one to add a new set of images to an
existing disc. CD-R systems only would allow companies to produce
limited-run CDs of specialized information. The desirability to simply
update existing CDs with new information, rather than having to scrap
the lot each and every time, provided the impetus for this new 
standard. -- TR

Sengstack, Jeff. "On a Roll" CD-ROM World 9(5) (May 1994):42-47.  
-- Sengstack sings the praises of CD-Recordable capabilities, 
encouraging readers to become electronic publishers with CD-R
systems retailing for less than $4000. This article provides six 
reasons why CD-Recorder systems make sense: for archiving purposes,
recording music, multimedia training, storing photographs, software
testing, and replication service purposes. -- TR 

  
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES 
 
Gibbs, W. Wayt. "Gray Matter" Scientific American 270(5) (May 1994):114. 
-- With the progress of the digital age, paper is seen as still 
important for its ease of use and portability (all the hard- and 
software needed for decoding is kept tidily in the human head); but 
paper is also seen as merely the messy debris left in the trails blazed 
by digital authoring tools. Paper is given form by digital media, but 
can give nothing back....or so it seemed until Xerox PARC looked into 
the issue. Xerox PARC has introduced "self-clocking glyph code". Glyph 
code is a way of printing tiny slashes so that they encode data in a 
binary fashion, just as digital electronic media. The pattern of forward 
slashes, back slashes, and spaces form a fine gray patch and can encode 
any dat recordable on a diskette, even in encrypted or compressed form. 
With error correction written in, a paper's information could be 
reconstructed even after shredding. Scanners are used to get the 
information back into digital form. Proffered uses for glyph coding range 
from new shipping dockets and invoices rich in information, and sparse 
in errors, to chart printouts that retain all detail of numerical data 
in gray shades. Xerox and Microsoft are working to see if glyph codes may 
help to integrate fax, printer, computer, and copying technology. -- RR
