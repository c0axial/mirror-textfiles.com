Expert Systems 
 
Bielawski, Larry and Robert Lewand.  Intelligent Systems Design :  
Integrating Expert Systems, Hypermedia and Database Technologies.  New  
York : John Wiley & Sons, 1991. This work gives a good overview and  
discussion of intelligent systems and their design/development. It also  
presents the integration of hypermedia into expert system design (and vice  
versa)--this in particular, is an interesting marriage of technologies. 
 
Kruger, Myron.  Artificial Reality II.  Addison-Wesley, 1991.  Kruger, one of  
the pioneers of virtual reality technology (who appears prominently in  
Rheingold's book below) has written an unusual book that, while surveying  
the typical VR technology (datagloves, head-mounted displays, etc.), focuses  
on the aesthetics of VR as applied to interactive networks.  One comes away  
from this book with a completely different sense of Artificial Reality than  
one gets from reading much of the current rather sensationalistic popular  
press coverage. -- Clifford Lynch 
 
Rheingold, Howard.  Virtual Reality.  New York : Summit Books, 1991.  In this  
book virtual reality is described and explained by Mr.Rheingold in a non- 
technical manner.  He tells of his own experiences in discovering VR, and in  
this way we come to know of the technology's history and development.

      In "The Electronic Journal: What, Whence, and When?," Ann Okerson  
      surveys current and future e-journal publication activities.  She  
      discusses publishers' visions of e-journals, and she identifies four  
      major groups of potential e-journal publishers: existing publishers,  
      intermediary organizations (e.g., ISI and CARL), researchers and  
      scholars, and universities.  She concludes by forecasting how e- 
      journals may evolve during the next 9 years. (GET OKERSON PRV2N1 or

      In "Online Journals: Disciplinary Designs for Electronic Scholarship,"  
      Teresa Harrison et al. examine and critique the e- journal concept,  
      then describe the Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue  
      Electronique de Communication (EJC/REC). EJC/REC is a referre[e]d,  
      bilingual journal dealing with communication.  It is part of the  
      innovat[ive] Comserve service, which provides communication  
      scholars with a variety of electronic information services (e.g.,  
      directory information, journal indexes, access to over 1,000 files,  
      and 20 computer conferences).  (GET HARRISON PRV2N1 or GET

      In "Post-Gutenburg Galaxy: The Fourth Revolution in the Means of  
      Production of Knowledge," Stevan Harnad discusses the three  
      historical revolutions in knowledge production (speech, writing, and  
      print) and the emerging fourth revolution--electronic "skywriting" on  
      the Net.  He examines the limitations of our print-based scholarly  
      communication system, and describes how electronic communication  
      can support scholarly skywriting, a process that allows scholars to  
      get rapid feedback about promising ideas and theories from  
      colleagues worldwide.  He then describes Psycoloquy, a referred  
      psychology e-journal that embodies the scholarly skywriting process.

      In "The Journal of the International Academy of Hospitality Research,"  
      Lon Savage describes a referred e-journal for researchers in hotel,  
      restaurant, and institutional management and tourism.  JIAHR is  
      sponsored by the International Academy of Hospitality Research and  
      published by Virginia Tech's Scholarputer conference, e journal.  The  
      authors also discuss the future of e-journals. (GET AMIRAN PRV2N1 or

      In "EJournal: An Account of the First Two Years," Edward Jennings  
      provides a personal look at his efforts to establish and publish a  
      refereed e-journal on electronic networks and texts.  This behind- 
      the-scenes narrative reveals some of the trials and tribulations that  
      may face the prospective e-journal publisher. (GET JENNINGS PRV2N1

      In "Providing Data Services for Machine-Readable Information in an  
      Academic Library: Some Levels of Service," Jim Jacobs examines four  
      types of academic services for machine-readable data files: general  
      data services, computing services, library data services, and  
      reference data services.  Within each type, he identifies different  
      possible levels of service.  (GET JACOBS PRV2N1 or GET JACOBS

Scientific American Special Issue on Communications, Computers and  
Networks 265(3) (September 1991).  If you purchase a single issue of a  
magazine this year, this should be it.  Filled with eleven articles by some of  
the biggest names in computer networking, this issue covers all bases and  
includes suggestions for further readings on the issues.  Included in this  
issue are the following articles:  
 
      *  "Communications, Computers and Networks" by Michael L. Dertouzos  
      of MIT;

      Computer describing how changes in available technology will change  
      the way computers are used in society;  
      *  "The Computer for the 21st Century" by Mark Weiser, head of the  
      Computer Science Laboratory at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center,  
      describes the future filled with smaller and more independent, yet  
      interconnected computers, what he calls "ubiquitous computing";  
      *  "Products and Services for Computer Networks" by Nicholas P.  
      Negroponte, also of MIT (and has also been a visiting professor at  
      Berkeley), shows us a tantalizing vision of  networked information;  
      *  "Computers, Networks and Work" by Lee Sproull and Sara Kiesler of  
      Boston University and Carnegie Mellon University, respectively (and  
      the authors of ConnectionsQcited here last month), explore the  
      effects of increased networking on work and workers;  
      *  "Computers, Networks and the Corporation" by Thomas W. Malone  
      and John F. Rockart both of MIT;  
      *  "Computers, Networks and Education" by Alan C. Kay of Apple  
      Computer, using elementary education as an example, describes how  
      computers can amplify many areas of the educational process;  
      *  "Infrastructure for the Global Village" by Al Gore, the US Senator  
      and author of the 1990 High Performance Computing Act, argues the  
      necessity of government involvement in the creation of a national  
      high-speed network;  
      *  "Common Law for the Electronic Frontier" by Anne W. Branscomb of  
      Harvard University, discusses some of the issues of security and  
      privacy in a networked environment, as does Mitch Kapor, co-founder  
      and president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation [see EFFector  
      Online above], in "Civil Liberties in Cyberspace."    
 
 
Optical Disc Technologies 
 
"CD-ROM Special" ASLIB Information 19(6) (June 1991). This issue of ASLIB  
Information, published in London, is devoted to CD-ROM technology, with six  
articles covering a wide range of topics, including hardware selection,  
standards, networking, and full-text CD-ROM databases.  This proves that  
the technology has firmly entrenched itself on the other side of the Atlantic  
as well. 
 
King, Alan "Let your fingers do the walking: A guide to information sources  
about CD-ROM" Database 14(4) (August 1991):97-99. King provides a  
detailed list and descriptions of his favorite CD-ROM information sources  
with the caveat that "the amount of information about CD-ROM technology  
has exploded almost as quickly as the technology itself." It is encouraging to  
note that the two periodicals he deems as key, and when combined "create  
the definitive CD-ROM reference" are both monitored monthly in Current  
Cites. 
 
 
General 
 
Miericke, Susan "Creating Hospitable Environments for Technologically Naive  
Users: Y'all Come Back Now, Hear!" Library Trends 39(3) (Winter 1991):327- 
334.  Miericke argues that developing and using "sound communications  
strategies" as well as contextual teaching are the key to successful  
integration of the technologically disinclined into the information age. 
 
Templeton, Brad "The National Conference on Computing and Values: a  
Report"  EFFector Online [eff-news@eff.org] 1(10) (August 24, 1991).  This  
is a brief report on the first conference on computing and values that took  
place this past summer. 
 
Woodsworth, Anne.  Patterns and Options for Managing Information  
Technology on Campus.  Chicago : American Library Association, 1991.  In  
this book Woodsworth addresses the question, "how can visions of the ideal  
campus in the information age be realized: through the pervasive influence  
of groups of technologically literate leaders on campus?  Or through strong  
central direction by a chief information officer (CIO)?"
