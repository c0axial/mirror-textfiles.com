   Baker, Thomas. "Languages for Dublin Core" D-Lib Magazine (December
   1998) (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december98/12baker.html). - This
   article offers a different and interesting perspective on the Dublin
   Core metadata element set and standardization process than those views
   that have come before. By looking at the process and content through
   the lens of language, Baker provides us with perhaps a better model
   and justification for the often frustrating and confusing process of
   defining a basic metadata standard. Baker also illustrates that the
   Dublin Core is emerging as a truly global draft standard, with
   implementations in dozens of countries around the world. The language
   issues that arise from these implementations are also briefly covered
   here as well. For DC wonks this is a must-read. For others, it may
   have some interesting moments but it is not essential for a basic
   understanding of the DC. - RT

   If you are unfamiliar with the collections and services of the Arts
   and Humanities Data Service, this article will serve as a good
   introduction to what they have to offer the academic communities in
   these subject areas. If you are familiar with their work (which
   includes the long-running and unique Oxford Text Archive, among other
   notable collections and services), then you should concentrate on the
   sections "Collections Development", "Resource Discovery" and
   "Challenges to be Confronted" to discover how they do it and what
   challenges remain. - RT
   
   "Lessons Learned: National Digital Library Competition" Washington,
   DC: Library of Congress/Ameritech, 1998.
   (http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award/lessons.html). - This Web page
   provides some useful insights into the process of creating digital
   library collections. The Library of Congress pulled out quotes from
   some of the reports submitted by libraries participating in the
   LC/Ameritech National Digital Library Competition. The purpose in
   doing so is to provide to others doing or thinking about doing
   something similar some anecdotal information about some of the issues
   they may encounter. In reading these brief extracts from a variety of
   projects, some interesting things emerge. One is the diversity of
   problems encountered and solutions selected. Another is that very few
   of the projects (if any) were executed exactly as initially planned.
   From this evidence alone it is clear that flexibility and
   problem-solving skills are two essential ingredients for any digital
   library project. Links are provided to the output of the various
   projects, so you can gauge for yourself how well these projects have
   overcome their challenges. - RT
   
   Nardi, Bonnie A. and Vicki L. O'Day. "Application and Implications of
   Agent Technology for Libraries" The Electronic Library 16 (5):
   (October 1998): 325-337. - At first glance this article may appear to
   be yet another instance of the librarian profession under siege.
   Happily, it turns out to be a balanced and persuasive case for the
   creation of a diverse information ecology, taking the best from both
   software agents and human agents. Nardi and O'Day present a set of
   nine principles for designing agent technology based on their studies
   of reference librarians ("exemplary human agents"). From their
   observations, they recommend that agents should be "activity-aware"
   and accommodate client's preferences, constraints and environment.
   They are careful to avoid the overly simplistic notion that software
   agents will replace librarians. Instead, the authors acknowledge the
   unique (and often invisible) skills of librarians such as the subtlety
   and tact of a reference interview and the mental cataloging of
   extensive resources. But they also explain some of the benefits that
   software agents would offer, in their conclusion that the strengths of
   both human agents and software agents are critical to effectively
   providing information services. For those who are still concerned
   about the future of the librarian profession, the authors offer
   important new librarian roles, including assisting in the design of
   these intelligent systems - imagine that! - LY

   Peete, Gary R. Business, Government and the Law on the Internet.
   Berkeley, California: Library Solutions Press, 1999. ISBN:
   1-882208-24-2. - As with all of the Internet Workshop Series
   workbooks, this guide to business, government and the law is designed
   to be either a self-paced guide or a model training tool. Included in
   this book is a ready reference guide with a briefly annotated list of
   Internet sites. Module One focuses on the World Wide Web providing an
   overview of Netscape mechanics and Web search strategies that use
   business, government and law topics as examples. A special section on
   evaluating Internet sites is particularly useful. Module Two discusses
   other Internet series such as email, ftp telnet and even gopher. - MP
   
   Port, Otis. "Through a Glass Quickly" Businessweek 3607 (December 7,
   1998): 96-98. - Lucent Technologies has pioneered a new kind of
   photonics technology that may enable fiber-optics networks to shatter
   all previously forecast limits on traffic. This article showcases the
   new technology, known as "Wave Length Division Multiplexing," or WDM.
   WDM "compacts" the rainbow of light that conveys messages into
   ever-smaller bands on a fiber line. The result is that very dense
   communication, such as three-dimensional depictions of surgery, or
   instantaneous warehouse-to-consumer information streams, will pose no
   serious bandwith problem. Commercial products that use WDM may appear
   by the turn of the century, so it's not that far away. Here's a
   sampling of the good news. This technology offers a real possibility
   that network communications costs (both telecom and Internetworking)
   may drop to zero sooner versus later, enabling all computers and
   services to maintain constant connections. The bad news: the
   industries that will be most affected have not begun to speculate
   seriously about how to manage e-commerce if connectivity is
   essentially free, so there could be some serious catch-up work ahead.

   Schorr, Herbert and Salvatore J. Stolfo. "A Digital Government for the
   21st Century" Communications of the ACM 41(11) (Nov. 1998)
   (http://www.acm.org/pubs/articles/journals/cacm/1998-41-11/p15-schorr/
   p15-schorr.pdf) - "Many government agencies procure expensive and
   complex information systems without the benefit of sufficient
   interaction with each other or with the R&D community." That
   representative quote is from the full report
   (http://www.isi.edu/nsf/final.html) of the Workshop on Research and
   Development Opportunities in Federal Information Services, which the
   CACM article summarizes. Examples of such opportunities are proposed
   projects in crisis management systems, large-scale statistical
   datasets, online public interaction with agencies, and "intelligent"
   transportation. Current government services are characterized as
   burdened by outmoded legacy systems which are limited to particular
   tasks and vertically integrated in an impermeable stovepipe
   configuration. (There's a clear tone of envy for the private sector,
   flowering with systems that are increasingly flexible, responsive and
   interoperable.) Admirably, thorny issues are addressed, such as the
   obstacles formed by the culture clash of the academic, industrial and
   public service communities. Though it's a bit buffered by the
   hifalutin' language used in both article and report, a little reading
   between the lines reveals a painful acknowledgement that for most
   computer people, "government" means "bloated bureaucracy" and they
   want nothing to do with it. But folks, remember DARPA and what it led
   to? This call for help is worth considering, not just for the
   immediate gratification in federal research money, but for the
   opportunity to create a better future for the public good. - JR
   
   Stoffle, Carla J. "Literacy 101 for the Digital Age" American
   Libraries 29(11) (December 1998):46-48. - Stoffle's thesis is that
   information literacy is essential for everyone, and academic
   librarians must rethink how they help students achieve it. Among the
   strategies that Stoffle suggests are: "Libraries will have to make
   education a priority"; "[We must] extend our concept of librarians'
   role as educators to partnering with faculty in designing individual
   courses and curricula"; "partnerships with other institutional units
   and professionals are equally essential"; "Librarians must also modify
   their concepts of how they'll teach such skills"; "we'll also need to
   identify how support staff can help"; "Librarians must learn how to be
   effective teachers and designers of assignments in more systematic
   ways than the hit-or-miss methods in vogue today"; and, "librarians
   will need to find ways to continually develop their own technological
   skills". A sidebar "Learning from the Teaching Libraries" by Kimberly
   M. Donnelly highlights a few of the porgrams around the U.S. which are
   attempting to implement such strategies.- RT
