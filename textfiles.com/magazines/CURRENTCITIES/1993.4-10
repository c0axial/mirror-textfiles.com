Information Transfer
 
Chroust, David Z. "From FirstSearch to Wordperfect: Cleaning Up
Downloaded Screens" ONLINE 17(5) (September 1993):44-50.  Through
nine well-defined macros, Chroust instructs the reader on 
"cleaning up" OCLC FirstSearch screens downloaded to Wordperfect 
5.1. - VR
 
Jackson, Kathy M. and Nancy L. Buchanan. "Unlimited Access to
FirstSearch: An Online Success Story" ONLINE 17(5) (September
1993):34-43.  Jackson and Buchanan, reporting on Texas A&M
University's faculty and students' successful experience using
OCLC's FirstSearch, describe the various methods of access
available to their clientele, and documentation support. Their
statistics include monthly use, databases used, connect time per
search, and per-search pricing. - VR 
 
Mintz, Anne P. "Availability of Electronic Full-Text Sources: A
Look Behind the Scenes" Database 16(5) (October 1993):24-31. 
Mintz, Director of Information Services at Forbes, explains the 
"legal, financial, and technological concerns [including image 
technology], as well as issues of data integrity and quality"  
that are affecting online availability of titles.  Until these 
issues are resolved, "we have a long way to go...before we see 
easily searchable full text with images."  - VR
 
Orenstein, Ruth M. "`How Full Is Full' Revisited: A Status Report
on Searching Full-Text Periodicals" Database 16(5) (October 
1993):14-23.  Experimenting with the coverage of Forbes through
several vendors and databases, including Dialog, Nexis, Data-
Star, Trade & Industry, Orenstein traces the currency and 
completeness of full text journal coverage.  Grids and tables 
substantiate her warning, "...many librarians are considering 
canceling their print subscriptions and relying on online full 
text sources for articles.  Given the variability in currency 
shown here, this is a strategy that bears rethinking!" - VR 
 

Networks and Networking

Dern, Daniel. The Internet Guide for New Users. New York: McGraw 
Hill, 1993. 570p. $40 (hardcover), $27.95 (paperback).  Dern, 
editor of Internet World magazine, has produced a fine new guide 
to the Internet.  This book does well by covering both 
introductory material along with specific information on using 
networked resources.  Dern leaves no stone unturned, though a 
little more coverage of topics like encryption and the politics 
of network development would be nice.  The tone of the book is 
friendly, helpful, and humorous, with captions like, "Remote 
login is a lot like astral projection."  Another small nitpick, 
the quality of a few of the images could be improved.  Overall, 
this is an excellent all-round guide to networking that even 
intermediate and advanced users will find helpful. - DR

Hart, Michael S. "How Shared ARE Our Shared Resources, Anyway?" 
Internet Research 3(2) (Summer 1993):4-7.  Hart, well known on 
the net for his postings and Project Gutenberg, offers his 
opinion on the idea of public domain works.  Hart complains that 
current copyright law fails to protect the public good by 
preventing the free distribution of works over the network for 
too many years.  Hart compares this limitation on the access to 
information free of charge to access to other resources, like 
air and water, and describes this as the creation of an 
artificial scarcity.  Hart makes some interesting comments, 
often not seeming to realize the implications, for instance, 
publication of expensive artworks on CD-ROM highlights the value 
of the information over the medium (but he seems to believe 
users should only be charged for the medium). He also claims 
that all compression schemes but DES are illegal in the United 
States.  The journal's editor, Charles McClure, asks interested 
readers to send their responses in for possible publication. -

Kaman, Geradine M. "Broadband-ISDN: Personal Connections to 
Global Resources" Internet Research 3(2) (Summer 1993):8-20.  
Kaman attempts to focus attention on some of the social issues 
surrounding the deployment of both narrowband ISDN (utilizing 
standard copper wire to provide voice, data, and low-quality 
video) and broadband ISDN (fiber in the loop to provide voice, 
data, and high-quality video).  Pointing out that technical 
issues have been the primary focus of ISDN development since its 
inception in 1971(!), Kaman suggests that for widespread 
implementation to begin, demand for the service must be created 
by addressing users and their needs.  Included with this article 
is handy list of acronyms. - DR

Kapor, Mitchell and Daniel J. Weitzner. "Developing the National 
Communications and Information Infrastructure" Internet Research 
3(2) (Summer 1993):21-30.  Based on testimony before Congress in 
Janury 1993, this article describes the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation's (EFF) Open Platform Proposal to deploy narrowband 
ISDN services in the United States.  The EFF supports deployment 
of ISDN technology as a near-term solution to providing wide-
scale, affordable access to the National Information 
Infrastructure.  The discussion presented here describes both 
the benefits and limitations of narrowband ISDN. - DR

Malamud, Carl and Marshall T. Rose. "An Experiment in Remote 
Printing or Toward the Integration of the Internet and 
Telephony" ConneXions 7(9) (September 1993):27-29.  In case you 
have not heard, the communications technology of the early 90s-- 
FAX transmission--has been networked, Internetworked.  Internet 
FAX combines telephony, IP addressing and the Internet's use of 
long-distance lines to offer FAX services at no charge to the 
user.  Internet FAX is now available in all of Australia, all of 
Washington, DC, most of Silicon Valley, parts of Riverside, CA, 
and all of the University of Michigan.  Coming online soon are 
Denmark, Germany, Finland, Ireland, Japan, and Sweden.

Medvinsky, Gennady and B. Clifford Neuman. "NetCash: A Design 
for Practical Electronic Currency on the Internet" Proceedings 
of the First ACM Conference on Computer Communications Security 
(November 1993) [available via anonymous FTP, <URL=ftp://
prospero.isi.edu/pub/papers/security/netcash-cccs93.ps.Z>].  
Addressing the pressing problem of how to conduct fiduciary 
business on the Internet, Medvinsky and Neuman describe a system 
that allows clients, merchants, and currency servers to interact 
in a secure fashion over an insecure medium.  The framework 
presented here addresses, to varying degrees, the following 
issues: security, anonymity, scalability, acceptability, off-line 
operation, transferability, and hardware independence.  The 
authors readily admit that this scheme does not solve all of 
these problems perfectly, but it does allow for the integration 
of other protocols when utmost anonymity and offline capabilities 
are required. - DR

Notess, Greg R. "Reading Usenet News: Using the rn and trn
Newsreader" ONLINE 17(5) (September 1993):94-98.  Notess's goal 
is to help us simplify Usenet News reading through selected Unix
newsreader commands.  The commands described help us find and 
move between newsgroups, organize .newsrc (a listing of 
newsgroups available), save articles, and reply to articles. - VR
 
Ryan, Joe. "A Pathfinder to Core Resources for Network Users" 
Internet Research 3(2) (Summer 1993):69-87.  Ryan has created a 
very useful guide to locating help on using the Internet.  Ryan 
adresses this article to beginner, intermediate, and expert 
users.  Covered here are suggestions for finding help using 
books, articles, email, and, mentors as well as brief 
descriptions of various general resources like archie, Gopher, 
etc.  The references are rather verbose, and I mean that in a 
good way, so are useful as a resource themselves; unfortunately, 
some of the information in the references is out of date, always 
a danger with network resources. - DR

Tuss, Joan. "Easy Online Access to Helpful Internet Guides" 
ONLINE 17(5) (September 1993):60-64.  This is a useful, 
instructional guide to the FTP sites for retrieving Internet 
guides, such as "Surfing the Internet", "There's Gold in them 
thar Networks!", SURAnet "Guide to Selected Internet Resources", 
and others. - VR
 
Valauskas, Edward J. "One-Stop Internet Shopping: NCSA Mosaic on
the Macintosh" ONLINE 17(5) (September 1993):99-101.  Valauskas
describes Mosaic, as an easy way to organize and "pull together 
documents, Internet search tools, scientific data, and other 
[Internet] files under a single framework."  The Macintosh and 
MS Windows versions are currently in beta testing, while the X-
Windows version is in full release. - VR

Walsh, R. Taylor. "Development of a Community Information 
Service: The National Access Capital Area Public Access Network 
(CapAccess) - A Work in Progress" Internet Research 3(2) (Summer 
1993):41-59.  Walsh, acting Executive Diretcor of CapAccess, 
describes the history and development of this civic networking 
project.  Beginning from the well-founded premise that local 
governments, organizations, businesses, and citizens have an 
important role to play in networking, this Washington, DC group
has created a well-run and very interesting community network.  
Walsh sees community, or civic, networking as an important step 
in the development of the National Information Infrastructure.  
Also included in this article are a number of screen dumps that 
illustrate the breadth of information available through the 
system (in addition to email and online forums), ranging from 
local online library catalogs to information on public-access 
cable television shows to local tax information. - DR

Wiencko, Joseph A., Jr. "The Blacksburg Electronic Village" 
Internet Research 3(2) (Summer 1993):31-40.  Wiencko, project 
manager of the Blacksburg Electronic Village, describes the 
vision and scope of this groundbreaking project now underway.  
The idea is to connect every member of the town of Blacksburg, 
Virginia (pop. 34,000) to a local high-speed network that is 
also connected to the Internet.  Part of the project is to 
identify what the critical mass of users is, identify and create 
applications that are useful to users from all sectors of the 
population, and encourage users to create new applications.  On 
the technological side, connections will be made available 
through both ISDN and FDDI (optical fiber) services at little or 
no chargeback to the user. - DR

"WIRE: Women's Information Resource & Exchange Opens Online 
Doors" EFFector Online 6(2) (October 1, 1993) [availabale via

Zeeman, Johan and Dennis MacKinnon. "Spreading the ILLINET: A 
Distributed Network for Library Resource Sharing in Illinois" 
Internet Research 3(2) (Summer 1993):60-68.  Zeeman and 
MacKinnon describe the two-phase plan to bring the ILLINET 
resource sharing system into a client-server mode employing 
Z39.50.  The idea is to establish a statewide Interlibrary Loan 
system that allows users to order materials from any 
participating library from a single interface. - DR
