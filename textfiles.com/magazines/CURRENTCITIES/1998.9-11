  DIGITAL LIBRARIES
   
   Duguid, Paul. "Information and Libraries" Red Rock Eater News Service
   (November 17, 1998) (reposted to DIGLIB and archived at
   http://listserv.nlc-bnc.ca/cgi-bin/ifla-lwgate.pl/DIGLIB/archives/digl
   ib.log9811/date/article-39.html). - Duguid uses a question facing the
   San Jose State University Academic Senate, regarding whether to merge
   the university library with the city's public library, to address
   broader issues related to both print and digital libraries. In
   particular, he takes to task computer scientists who assume to know
   what goes on in libraries while accepting millions of dollars to build
   digital versions. But the main point he makes is that obscuring, or
   allowing to remain obscured, the differences between information
   needs, information seeking behavior, and the clienteles doing the
   seeking, can only lead to disasters -- whether they are of the digital
   or institutional kind. - RT
   
   Nunberg, Geofrey. "Will Libraries Survive?" The American Prospect (41)
   (November-December 1998): 16-23
   (http://epn.org/prospect/41/41nunb.html). - The title of this piece is
   provocative but misleading. Nunberg ends up addressing not so much
   whether libraries will survive at all, but rather in what form. But
   that is a minor quibble about an article that is thoughtful,
   informative, historically accurate, and in the end, compelling. As
   those of us involved with creating digital libraries are well aware,
   it is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. Nunberg is aware of
   this, and is also aware of the hidden impacts of dropping computers
   into public libraries and expecting the library budget to absorb the
   costs of their care. So although the munificence of the Gates Library
   Foundation in connecting public libraries to the Internet is welcomed,
   it is important for us as a society to realize it is but a beginning
   step. Nunberg uses as his historical parallel the donation of almost
   2,000 public library buildings by Andrew Carnegie a hundred years ago.
   Carnegie's donation was limited only to the physical facility, leaving
   not one dime to stock it with anything worth reading. That American
   communities eventually rose to the challenge of making libraries out
   of the donated shells is a tribute to the capacity of American
   citizens to realize the importance of such a cultural and intellectual
   resource. Now, Nunberg asserts, we face no less of a challenge as a
   society. We can either rise to the challenge of providing the needed
   funds to stock our digital libraries, or fail to realize its
   importance. - RT
   
   Pack, Thomas and Jeff Pemberton. "Intranet Management, Content
   Development and Digital Gift Shop: The Cutting-Edge Library at The
   Atlanta Journal-Constitution" Online 22(6) (November/December
   1998):16-24. - At first glance, the library for a daily newspaper
   would seem to be a special case - too special to interest anyone
   outside. However, there are lots of ideas here for exploiting the full
   potential of networked information systems in any organization where
   information is the product. The News Research Services (NRS) staff at
   the Journal-Constitution have developed their intranet to put current
   and archival files on the desktops in the newsroom, and trained
   reporters and editors to do some searching, which leaves NRS staff
   free to delve into lengthier or deadline-pressured research. The
   corporate Web site has become a profit center for the company thanks
   to the staff's creative arrangements for marketing the articles and
   photos for which the paper holds copyright. While the article's focus
   is on innovative new projects, there is also adequate description of
   how the staff fulfills its traditional mission of fact-finding for the
   writers. They seem to do a fine job of it, and use their
   resourcefulness to provide background information through such media
   as custom intranet pages full of relevant data for anticipated hot
   topics. But this brings up a quibble: we never get to hear from the
   end users. Throughout the article, there's plenty from NRS staff and
   management about how well things are going, but nothing from the
   reporters and their editors. I expect some boosterism from
   publications like Online, where the editorial policy seems to be
   "information professionals congratulating information professionals,"
   but it's a lot more convincing when we're allowed to hear from the
   people served by the information professionals too. - JR
   
  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING
   
   Bray, Tim. "Stretching the Document Concept" Web Techniques 3(12)
   (December 1998): 43-46. - According to Tim Bray, who should know, the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) blurs the boundary between documents
   and data. This blurring, Bray reasonably asserts, will lead to
   interesting cominglings of document-centric users like humanist
   scholars with data-centric users such as management information
   systems (MIS) geeks. While bringing these two camps together in the
   same room may not lead to the same kind of cataclysmic event as the
   joining of matter and anti-matter would, it nonetheless may be
   interesting. Bray thinks it is both inevitable and good that
   document-centric people and data-centric people will be forced to come
   together to share a common vocabulary and some common tools. So do I.
   In any case, this piece provides an interesting insight to a possible
   watershed event that may slip past almost unnoticed by those too busy
   watching the XML hype machine roll on. - RT
   
   Soojung-Kim Pang, Alex. "The Work of the Encyclopedia in the Age of
   Electronic Reproduction" First Monday 3 (9) (September 9, 1998)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue3_9/pang/) - The author
   explores how the advent of e-text literature affects the "craft" and
   everyday work of editing. He focuses on the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
   which has actively navigated from print, to CD-ROM and to the World
   Wide Web. He asserts that the digitization of the encyclopedia has
   affected the structure of articles, and that it also has begun to
   affect the character of editorial work, the responsibilities of
   editors, and their relationships with authors, animators, and others.
   This is a useful exploration of how Net innovations affect other
   professions besides libraries. Soojung-Kim Pang goes beyond the usual
   analyses of the fate of linear narrative, and copyright. - TH
   
  NETWORKS & NETWORKING
   
   Bambury, Paul. "A Taxonomy of Internet Commerce" First Monday 3(10)
   (October 5, 1998)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue3_10/bambury/) - Bambury offers
   a clarifying piece that de-mystifies the terminology of the interplay
   between commerce and the Internet. He utilizes an "empirically derived
   classification system" (or taxonomy) of existing Internet business
   models. His taxonomy has two main branches: "transplanted real-world
   business models" and "native Internet business models." After
   comparing the two modes of description, he evaluates the role of
   business, governments, regulation and ideology. He asserts these two
   branches of Internet commerce are at odds, and may not be able to
   co-exist indefinitely. The aggressive nature of the real-world
   business model tends toward domination, whereas the native Internet
   economy and culture is "largely free, disintermediated, deep-rooted,
   ecological, decentralized, radical and politically sophisticated."
   Most likely, one or the other will prevail -- though we can always
   hope for a hybrid or new entry. - TH
   
   Raymond, Eric S. "Homesteading the Noosphere" First Monday 3 (10)
   (October 5, 1998)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue3_10/raymond/) - Despite a
   grandiose (and frankly Rheingoldian) title, this critique of "hacker"
   culture is really a rather interesting article. Raymond compares the
   so-called "gift economy" of the Internet with the belief system of
   property rights. He argues that there is a contradiction between the
   official ideology defined by open-source licenses and hacker culture.
   He examines the "customs" that regulate the ownership and control of
   open-source software, and suggests that they imply an "underlying
   theory of property rights homologous to the Lockean theory of land
   tenure." He concludes with an analysis of the implications and the
   need for better conflict resolution tools. - TH
   
   Schwartz, Alan and Simson Garfinkel. Stopping Spam: Stamping Out
   Unwanted Email & News Postings. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates,
   1998. - These days there are only two kinds of people: 1) those who
   have been victims of spam (unwanted, mass-distributed messages), and
   2) those who are not on the Internet. Of the latter category, many are
   less than three years old or are in a coma, and can hardly be blamed
   for not being victimized like the rest of us. But hold the phone. Now
   help is here, albeit of the "help yourself" variety. That is, as this
   book so completely documents, there is no silver bullet for slaying
   spammers. Rather, there are a variety of tricks and techniques which
   may render one somewhat spam-proof, but they will hardly rid the
   universe of these vermin. But if that's all you're after, then go to
   it. And as for those of us who may not wish to spend several days
   setting up various barriers to block this garbage, the beginning of
   this book is an amusing (in a twisted sort of way, perhaps) and
   thorough historical account of spam, dating back to the 1970's (yes,
   Virginia, the Internet is indeed at least that old). Given the size of
   the Internet these days, if misery loves company we've never had it so
   good. - RT
