Expert Systems & Artificial Intelligence

Aluri, Rao and Donald E. Riggs.  Expert Systems in Libraries. Norwood, 
New Jersey: Ablex Publishing, 1990.  A plethora of expert system 
knowledge ranging from essays on general background information, 
library applications (both public and technical service), and future 
implications. While most of the essays are written or co-authored by 
library professionals, library professors and computer scientists also 
have their input. In the following months you will find abstracts of 
specific essays from this volume in this section of Current Cites.

Emdad, Ali. "A Synergetic Model for Building an Intelligent 
Documentation System (IDS)" Microcomputers for Information 
Management  7(2) (June 1990):115-125. This article presents the 
idea of an intelligent documentation system (IDS). Emdad recognizes 
the shortcomings of most printed documentation, as well as online 
user documentation. Hence he proposes an I.D.S. which incorporates 
the use of expert systems and hypertext. While his focus is on 
software documentation, the application of such a system to 
bibliographic instruction seems natural.  The expert system is first 
used to ascertain the user's ability (skill level) and then to determine 
the most appropriate path of help.  The help screens it locates for the 
user are all done with hypertext.  This feature leads the user through 
a series of text, video and audio (as appropriate) to provide the user 
with the needed assistance. 

Leonard, W. Patrick. "On My Mind: Are Librarians Reluctant to 
Explore Expert Systems?"  Journal of Academic Librarianship  16(5) 
(November 1990):302, 307. An interesting appeal by Mr. Leonard, 
Vice-Chancellor for Academic Services, Purdue University, calling for 
greater involvement on the part of Librarians in the use and 
development of expert systems.  He describes our lagging behind 
many of the other professions' applications of the technology and 
succinctly cites the well known reasons for applying expert system 
technology in the library environment.

Portante, Tom. "The Common Sense Machine." Patricia Seybold's 
Office Computing Report  13(11) (November 1990):17-19.  It has long 
been recognized that expert systems are brittle (they function only 
within a narrowly defined domain under standard circumstances) 
because of their lack of common sense knowledge (that knowledge 
humans have in virtue of experiencing the world first hand).  A 
consortium, Computer Technology Corporation, founded by Digital 
Equipment, Bellcore, Kodak, and others has been created to work on 
this problem.  Currently they're at the midpoint of a 10 year 
schedule aiming at equipping their CYC ("psych") knowledge base 
with common sense knowledge (e.g. Animals live for a contiguous 
time period). As a result of this work other useful AI tools have 
emerged: Full Text Retrieval, and Natural Language Understanding 
(among others).  It is hoped that the CYC knowledge base will, at the 
end of the project, be self-learning; that the manual input of common 
sense knowledge will cease and the machine will be able to reason 
by analogy and generalization and be able to make discoveries on its 
own.  Should this become the case, expert systems may actually live 
up to their name and become "experts."


Hyper- & Multimedia

Bobay, Julie., Ed Stockey and Mary Pagliero Popp.  "Library Services 
for Remote Users with LINKWAY."  Reference Services Review  (Fall 
1990):53-57.  A description of the Indiana State University Library 
Automation Network (SULAN) which uses the IBM hypermedia 
product LINKWAY to connect public, academic and special libraries in 
a union catalog that provides library information, news and 
instruction, in addition to remote catalog access to major collections 
in the state.  Users can adapt viewing and printing to their needs and 
may soon have other services such as CD-ROM access and 
hypermedia capabilities. 

Quillan, Lon and Ken Gruberman.  "Buyer's Guide: The MacUser 
Multimedia Encyclopedia."  MacUser 7(2) (February 1991):105-172.  
A comprehensive look at the state of the art in Multimedia, this 
section goes beyond a "buyer's guide," to include truly informative 
and in-depth  news about the tools available for multimedia users.  
Sections on video, audio and animation/authoring technologies 
describe the rapid progress being made in expanding the 
hypermedia capabilities of the Macintosh platform.

Vaccaro, Bill. "HyperCard 2.0: A closer look."  Computers in Libraries 
10(8) (September 1990):10-13.  The Apple platform continues to 
lead in the hypermedia/multimedia competition with the 
introduction of HyperCard 2.0, a 1990s update of the original 
HyperCard released in 1987.  Variable card sizes, multiple windows, 
varying text styles and other enhancements are likely to make 
HyperCard 2.0 the new standard for both the casual and the 
advanced Macintosh user.


Information Transfer

Kalal, Bob. "The Ohio State University Network Fax Project." Research 
and Education Networking 1(2) (November/December 1990):9-11.  A 
description of a project to transmit facsimile images over the 
Internet using inexpensive, off-the-shelf microcomputer and fax 
components.

Marshak, David S. "Filters: Separating the Wheat from the Chaff."  
Patricia Seybold's Office Computing Report.  13(11) (November 
1990):1-16. Marshak asks, "Where's your information? It's 
somewhere in my data." Library users are not the only ones hit by 
the deluge of data born of the information age. People in other 
professions, especially in the corporate realm, are finding that 
computerized information sources are giving them more than they 
can possibly absorb. The solution is of course a computerized one: 
filters. A filter is a computer application that "sits" between the 
incoming data source and you.  You define a profile of your interests, 
or priorities and the information coming to you via electronic mail, 
news feeds, computer conferences, online databases is filtered 
through it.  Items may be stored in files of different names (urgent, 
desk schedules, meetings, etc.) or as in the case of news feeds and 
online databases, the information may simply be ranked, the most 
important appearing first.  For those people who dread coming back 
from vacation to an e-mail box with 200+ messages, filters appear to 
be a blessing.


Networks and Networking

"LITA at ALA Annual: The Network Programs" LITA Newsletter 
12(1) (Winter 1991):19-31.  A series of reports on the programs 
LITA sponsored at the 1990 ALA annual conference on networks and 
networking.  The next-best thing to being there.

Nelson, Nancy Melin. "Meet Allan H. Weis, President and CEO of 
Advanced Network & Services, Inc." Research and Education 
Networking 1(2) (November/December 1990):13-15. More 
information for anyone who is still trying to figure out what the 
creation of this not-for-profit organization by IBM, MCI and Merit 
means for the future of networking.

Peters, Paul Evan. "CNI Activity Report" ARL Newsletter 154 (January 
4, 1991):9.  A brief report on the activities of the Coalition for 
Networked Information, including a list of the CNI Working Groups 
and their convenors.


Optical Disc Technologies

AMIGOS.  "Microsoft CD-ROM Extension software explained."  OCLC 
Micro 6(2) (April 1990):4.  A brief explanation of the software that 
allows DOS to work with CD-ROM's comparatively massive storage 
capacity.

Gilliam, Ellen and Karen Sluzeenski.  "CD-ROM Report:  CD-ROM user 
groups: the experience of Digital Equipment Corporation's Digital 
Library Network." Database 13(6) (December 1990):105-108.  This 
article discusses the conception and formation of a CD-ROM user 
group for Digital Equipment Corporation's corporate library network.  
It is interesting to note that although DEC is the second largest 
computer company in the nation with vast technological resources, 
CD-ROM in the library is a relatively foreign element.

Rosen, Linda.  "CD-ROM hardware choices."  Online 14(5) (September 
1990):121-124. Reviews the features of currently available CD-ROM 
drives from Pioneer, Hitachi, Laser Magnetic Storage, and Chinon.


General

Hickey, Thomas and Chandra Prabha. "Online Public Catalogs and 
Large Retrievals: Methods for Organizing, Reducing, and Displaying." 
Proceedings of the 53rd ASIS Annual Meeting 27 (1990):110-116.  
As the size of online catalogs increase, users will more frequently 
retrieve more items for a given search than they can easily handle.  
This paper proposes some "postprocessing" techniques for organizing, 
reducing, and displaying large retrievals.

More, Elizabeth. "Information Systems : People Issues." Journal of 
Information Science 16(5) (1990):311-320.  An excellent research 
article which lays out the important issues facing the "people" side of 
technology.  More says, "for too long decisions and general thinking 
about information systems have, in the main, been narrowly 
economically and technologically focused, without adequate regard 
for the people factors involved."  She suggests that the areas of 
organizational culture, the structure of power and politics (within an 
organization) and the practice of organizational communication are 
where the "people" issues lay. It is in these areas where a deeper and 
more responsive change to the impact of technology needs to take 
place to reach a more human-sensitive environment.

Pfaffenberger, Brian. Democratizing Information: Online Databases 
and the Rise of End-User Searching.  Boston, MA: G.K. Hall, 1990. This 
book, which won the ASIS Information Science Book of the Year 
Award in 1990, is a very interesting study of the development of the 
online database industry, the role of the search intermediaries in this 
industry, and the prospects and failures in trying to make these 
databases available to end-users. While the book is flawed in some 
ways (for example, it does not seem to be aware of either the effects 
of the Internet or the development of online library catalogs), it 
presents a very interesting view of developments over the last 20 
years, including an examination of the parallels between the online 
database industry's growth and the growth of earlier technological 
infrastructures, such as the electric power industry. The point of 
view is more sociological than technical. - Clifford Lynch
