Electronic Publishing

Browning, John. "Information Marketeers Focus on Content 
Rather than Access" Scientific American 274(2) (February 
1996): 30-32. -- The author briefly explores the shift in 
ways of conveying information, from the old method of 
controlling the access points (one-to-many broadcast) to 
new methods made possible with the Internet (many-to-many 
multicast) which changes the focus from the quality of the 
service to the quality of content needed to capture 
audience. The shift is evidenced in Microsoft Network's 
decision to change from a proprietary access-controlled 
outernet, to a more open Internet publishing site. -- RR

Taubes, Gary. "Science Journals Go Wired" and "Electronic 
Preprints Point the Way to 'Author Empowerment" Science 271
(February 9, 1996): 764-768. [http://science-mag.aaas.org/
science/scripts/display/full/271/5250/764.html] -- This 
pair of complementary articles, although focused on 
scientific literature in the main, are excellent overviews 
of the current state of electronic periodical literature. 
In the first one, Taubes outlines some of the major 
advantages that electronic journals have over their 
paper-based relatives, such as video and audio, search 
functions, discussion forums, links to related articles, 
and automatic notification and alerting services. Some of 
the challenges facing publishers include technical problems 
that prevent a fast transition from submission to 
publication (a trait that should be a major advantage of 
electronic journals), the lack of tried and true cost 
recovery methods, and archival issues. A sidebar outlines 
the plans of the major scientific journal publishers for 
mounting their journals on the network. The accompanying 
article on electronic preprints (pre-publication articles 
of vital importance to the scientific community) serves as 
an interesting counterpoint, in that it describes a 
movement to bypass the traditional publishing system 
entirely. I highly recommend this pair of short articles 
to anyone wishing an overview of the current state of 
electronic periodicals. If you visit the online version 
(address above) you get the added benefit of gaining 
first-hand experience with some of the added benefits 
that electronic publication has over print. -- RT

Donovan, Kevin. "The Anatomy of an Imaging Project: A 
Primer for Museums, Libraries, Archives and other Visual 
Collections" Spectra: Journal of the Museum Computer 
Network 23(2) (Winter 1995/6): 19-22. -- A terrificly 
useful article for anyone directing an imaging project. 
This article outlines specific points for consideration 
in launching an imaging project, from the initial audit 
and proposal to tips for maintaining quality and 
consistency, storage and archiving, and eventual 
delivery via networks or CD-ROM. -- RR

Feder, Judy. "Image Recognition and Content-Based Retrieval 
for the World Wide Web" Advanced Imaging 11(1) (January 
1996): 26-28. -- While this article is written by the 
director of marketing for the main product under discussion, 
it is still a useful introduction to the current progress 
toward making multimedia intelligent. Currently multimedia, 
whether networked or standalone, is made of "dumb" 
multimedia files, manageable and searchable only by textual 
meta-data. Content-based retrieval proposes to let you use 
an image, for instance, as a starting point to search for 
similar images and so forth. Experiments are ongoing in this 
field, with huge implications for research resources in art 
history, archaeology, not to mention law enforcement or any 
other visual field. This article discusses some real-world 
applications under development. -- RR

Karpinski, Richard. "Netscape to Get Real-Time Audio, 
Video" Communications Week no. 595 (February 5, 1996): 
1, 64. -- A short introduction to Netscape's plans for 
enabling delivery of multimedia over the Internet in 
Real-Time. Of note is mention of an emerging new protocol, 
RTP or Realtime Transport Protocol, for streaming 
multimedia over networks (RealAudio is another example 
of streaming technology). -- RR

Karpinski, Richard. "The Web in 3-D" Communications Week
no. 595 (February 5, 1996): IA1-IA3. -- You have probably 
heard about VRML or Virtual Reality Markup Language, which 
is a meta-language, like the HTML that it works with, but 
for creating and delivering 3-D graphics over the WWW. 
This article introduces a few new tools that make it easy 
to actually use this new language. Some applications of 
VRML might be virtual tours of architectural sites or 
re-constructed ruins, or new interfaces to other forms of 
information. -- RR

Ozer, Jan. "Software Video Codecs: The Search for Quality" 
New Media 6(2) (January 29, 1996): 46-52. -- A thorough 
comparison of current video codecs for compression and 
rendering of digital video, including Cinepak (used by 
QuickTime), Indeo (from Intel), IVI (fom Intel as well)
and other more proprietary formats. Criteria for 
comparison include: required level of hardware, 
compression ratio, and visual quality. Anyone authoring 
digital video should know what codec they are using as 
it largely determines quality and file sizes. -- RR
  
Pohler, Ulrike. "Legal Aspects of Multimedia: A European 
Perspective" Spectra: Journal of the Museum Computer 
Network 23(2) (Winter 1995/6): 27-29. -- This article 
reports on the European Commission Green Paper, which 
explored the issues of copyright, including digital 
media, as they applied to the newly united European 
Union. The paper may form a model for copyright 
agreements that span national boundaries, currently a 
major restriction to multimedia content development.

Bustos, Rod and Roxann Bustos. "Internet Resources for 
Liberalism" College & Research Libraries News 57(2) 
(February 1996): 86-87. -- As a companion piece to an 
earlier C&RL News feature on Internet resources for 
conservatism (July/August 1995), this article focuses 
on resources for liberalism. Of the hundreds of liberal 
sites that must exist on the Internet, this article 
provides only a selective list of electronic journals, 
World Wide Web resources, electronic discussion groups, 
usenet groups and gophers. While a listing for MojoWire, 
the online edition of Mother Jones, and Turn Left (the 
Home of Liberalism on the Web) with its links to a 
variety of other liberal sites, seem like obvious choices 
for inclusion in this list, references to the Democratic 
National Committee Home Page and the Anti-Defamation 
League Home Page, leave this Current Citer wondering 
about the authors' exact definition of liberal. -- MP

DeJesus, Edmund X. "Toss Your TV: How the Internet Will 
Replace Broadcasting" BYTE 21(2) (February 1996): 50-64.
[http://www.byte.com/art/9602/sec8/sec8.htm]. -- One of the 
best articles I've seen on the challenges of delivering 
multimedia over the Internet and the mix of technologies 
that may make it possible. From server infrastructure to 
network bandwidth to client software, DeJesus takes us on a 
magical mystery tour of Internet multimedia developments. 
Promising? Yes. Time to toss your TV? Not yet. But as 
DeJesus says, "keep your browsers tuned." -- RT

Herbst, Kris. "Webfest IV: A Report of the Happenings at 
the Fourth World-Wide Web Conference" Internet World 7(3)
(March 1996): 22-26. -- For Web-heads who missed the show 
in Boston, this article hits the high points of this 
conference (as well as briefly recapping the show-stealers 
of the previous shows). With all the Web and Internet 
conferences that have sprouted up in the last two years, 
it is hard to keep them straight. But this one is the
real McCoy, sponsored by the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C). Highlights include Java, VRML, Video Mosaic 
(Vosaic), payment systems, and the future of HTML. -- RT
 
Nash, Stanley D., Miles Yoshimura, William Vicenti. 
"American History Resources on the Internet" College & 
Research Libraries News 57(2) (February 1996): 82-84, 
90. -- The increasing availability of full-text documents 
such as treaties, acts, diaries and maps as well as the 
availability of images and sound on the Web could 
potentially revolutionize the nature of scholarly 
historical research as we know it. This article provides 
a selective list of some of the important full-text 
sources available on the Internet listing resources 
such as the Anti-Imperialism in the U.S.A. Web page, the 
American Prohibition Project, and the American Civil War 
Home Page which provides links to diaries, letters and 
military rosters from that era. There is a listing of 
indexes and guides to historical texts available on the 
Internet and the article also lists important listservs 
and the homepages or gophers for historical organizations.

Maxwell, Bruce. _How to Access the Government's Electronic 
Bulletin Boards_ Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly, 
Inc. 1996.  -- A second edition to last year's book of the 
same title, this book provides detailed descriptions of more 
than 200 free, public-access electronic bulletin board systems 
(BBSs) operated by federal agencies and departments. 
Electronic bulletin boards operated by the federal government 
provide access to a wide range of information sources such as 
lists of federal job opportunities, staff directories for 
particular agencies, and documents like the full text of 
Supreme Court opinions, grant information from the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH Grant Line), or statistical 
information issued by the Bureau of the Census. A layperson's 
guide, this book describes how to reach these BBSs, what 
they offer, and how to navigate through them. Particularly 
helpful is the introduction which provides background 
information in simple, practical terms about what one needs 
to connect to electronic bulletin boards in terms of hardware 
and software, in addition to a basic introduction to menu 
commands and solutions to common problems. The 1996 edition 
includes helpful information about how certain government 
information sites have changed or been improved (NASA 
Spacelink, for instance, which used to be almost unnavigable, 
has been completely transformed by a new easy-to-use 
interface); also included in the 1996 edition is an appendix 
which lists which BBSs have been added since last year, which 
ones have been deleted and which ones have undergone name 
changes.-- MP                            

Optical Disc Technology

Adkins, Susan L. "CD-ROM: A Review of the 1994-1995 
Literature" Computers in Libraries 16(1) (January 1996): 
66-74. -- In what has now become an annual tradition in
the pages of Computers in Libraries, Adkins attempts to
summarize the major trends in the CD-ROM industry as a
whole and how these play out in libraries. This literature
review, with accompanying bibliographic cites, is broken 
down into the follow categories: hardware, networking,
multimedia, CD-Recordable, other optical disc formats, 
CD-ROM v. online, developing countries, selection/
evaluation, reference issues and bibliographic 
instruction. A rather startling statistic presented in
the conclusion is that on average, professionals spend
only 5 to 15 percent of their time reading--but up to
50 percent of their time looking for information. In
light of this startling statistic, Adkins argues, 
electronic publishing via CD-ROM is not merely an
alternative, but a solution, since it offers search
and navigation capabilities that paper can never have.
However, 95 percent of corporate information is still 
stored in paper documents. -- TR
