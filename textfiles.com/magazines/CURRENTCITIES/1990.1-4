Expert System and Artificial Intelligence

Liebowitz, Jay. "Possible Impacts of Artificial Intelligence"  
Information Age (July 1989):155-159.  As the title suggests, this 
article introduces the possible impacts of A.I.  In the article, Mr. 
Liebowitz names five categories, in terms of which most of the 
effects of artificial intelligence can be grouped: i) legal impact ii) 
business practice  iii) employment impact iv) consumer impact, and  
v) social impact.  Worth reading as it broadens one's view of A.I. 
technology.

Liebowitz, Jay. "How Much 'Artificial Stupidity' do Expert Systems 
Possess?" Information Age 11(4) (Oct. 1989):225-228.  This article 
presents the limitations of current expert systems and briefly 
discusses these in terms of the development of future expert 
systems.  Among the areas for improvement which are of concern for 
our field are: the ability of an E.S. to possess and use common sense, 
and the ability of an E.S. to learn.

Wilson, Ralph. "Expert System Shell: 1st-Class HT." Library Software 
Review  (May/June 1990):174-178.  While this is simply a product 
review for the expert system shell " 1st-Class HT" (an E.S. building 
tool), the review offers the reader a clear conception of what goes 
into the development of an expert system.  This shell is particularly 
interesting because of its incorporation of hypertext.

Networks and Networking

Brett, George H. II. "Online Resources: Getting There from Here"  
EDUCOM Review 25(3) (Fall 1990):48-53.  This article raises 
questions about the future of online resources of  information.  
Where are we? Where are we going? Where should we be going?  
Brett provides few easy answers, rather, areas for future discussion.

The User's Directory of Computer Networks / Tracy L. LaQuey, ed. 
Bedford, MA : Digital Press, c1990.  Reviewed in Library Journal  
115(15) (Sept. 15, 1990):108.  This annual "road atlas of academic 
and computer networks in the United States and elsewhere" may just 
be the  reference tool for networking.  Information provided 
includes: policies and protocols, network services and external 
network connections, and contacts of the major networks and their 
hosts.

Yavarkovsky, Jerome.  "A University-Based Electronic Publishing 
Network" EDUCOM Review 25(3) (Fall 1990):14-20.  This is a very 
good discussion of some of the implications of electronic publishing 
and some of the possible futures of this new medium.  Topics include: 
ownership/copyright, storage and retrieval, and access.  Also 
included are a number of side bars (by various authors) highlighting 
more specialized topics.
Optical Disc Technologies

Heath, Sebastian.  "The Perseus Project: Classical Civilization Through 
Optical Media"  CD-ROM Professional 3(6) (November 1990):66-70.  
The Perseus Project is a collaborative effort based at Harvard 
University to develop an interactive database of Ancient Greek 
culture to be released on a combination of CD-ROM and videodisk.  
This article presents an overview of the project which seeks to fully 
document all primary sources, both archeological and textual, of 
ancient Greece.  The database is designed to hold between 40 and 
100 megabytes of primary texts and approximately 10,000 images 
illustrating art, architecture, and topography.  The Perseus Project is 
an excellent example of optical technology being put into action.

Laudau, Herbert B.  "Microform v. CD-ROM: Is There a Difference?"  
Library Journal 115(16) (October 1, 1990):56-59.  This article 
explores the strengths of microform and CD-ROM from technical, 
economic, and user perspectives.  The author counters the common 
assumption that electronic technology will render microforms 
obsolete.  He predicts that the successful libraries will be those that 
can "select, integrate, and exploit the best and different features of 
each technology."

Neame, Laura.  "Beyond CD-ROM: New Optical Technologies"  CD-ROM 
Professional 3(6) (November 1990):95-97.  This article presents a 
summary of the Canadian Library Association Conference session on 
CD-ROM technology.  Among the questions posed is whether CD-I 
(Compact Disk-Interactive) and DVI(Digital Video Interactive) can co-
exist or will there be a VHS/Beta type shoot-out?  Industry 
representatives feel that both have the potential of being successful, 
in different markets.  DVI has business-environment applications 
whereas CD-I is slated for the consumer market.
