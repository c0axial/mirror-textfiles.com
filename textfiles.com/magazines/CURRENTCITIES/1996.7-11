   Butter, Karen, Robin Chandler and John Kunze. "The Cigarette Papers:
   Issues in Publishing Materials in Multiple Formats" D-Lib Magazine
   (November 1996) (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november96/11butter.html) --
   A brief overview of several publishing projects relating to a
   collection of tobacco company Brown and Williamson internal
   documents that were leaked to, among others, the University of
   California, San Francisco. The UCSF Library subsequently published
   them in various forms in association with UC Press. A number of issues
   relating to these efforts (not the least of which being litigation by
   B&W to try to recover the documents) are briefly described. As an
   overview piece it serves its purpose, particularly with the links to
   pertinent resources online, but I couldn't help wishing for more
   details on how they scanned, indexed and published the material (some
   8,000 documents). -- RT
   
   CONFU: The Conference on Fair Use
   (http://www.utsystem.edu/ogc/intellectualproperty/confu.htm) --
   Spawned by the federal National Information Infrastructure project,
   the working group on Intellectual Property Rights convened the
   Conference on Fair Use: a meeting of stakeholders in copyright from
   content developers and publishers to end-users, universities, and
   libraries. This working group was charged with developing broadly
   accepted guidelines for fair use (free, educational use) of electronic
   resources, from databases to multimedia. Five areas were chosen to
   focus on: Distance Learning, Multimedia, Electronic Reserves,
   Interlibrary Loan, and Image Collections. The Multimedia and Images
   groups lead in reaching tentative agreements (all of which can be read
   online). The groups convened were not individuals, but rather
   professional organizations such as the College Art Association, the
   American Association of Museums, the Visual Resources Association,
   Association of Research Libraries, Association of American
   Publishers, and so on. This suite of documents deserves reading by
   anyone involved in electronic media for education at any level and
   anyone developing or distributing electronic resources. This is a very
   large group; but then again, this project will have equally large
   implications for these areas. -- RR

   Proprietors: The First Collision on the Information Highway" The
   Journal of Academic Librarianship 22(5) (September 1996): 337-344. --
   Focusing on the Clinton administration's White Paper on Intellectual
   Property Rights in the National Information Infrastructure and the
   impact that its recommendations will have on libraries and educational
   institutions, here is yet another article that describes the
   implications that passage of this legislation will have on access to
   information. Libraries and educational institutions, in providing
   copyrighted materials to the public whether they be students,
   teachers, scholars or researchers, see themselves as advocates for
   society at large. The recommendations put forth in the White Paper,
   however, favor the copyright owners and will make it more difficult
   for libraries to make electronic works available to the public in the
   same way that printed materials are made available. -- MP
   
   Stover, Mark. "The Librarian as Publisher: A World Wide Web Publishing
   Project" Computers in Libraries 16(9)(October 1996) :40-43. -- This
   article touches on many issues surrounding web journals: refereed vs.
   nonrefereed publication, access, copyright, design, and includes a
   sidebar underscoring the value of librarians as publishers on the web.
   While it is yet to be seen how successful scholarly web journals will
   be, arguments are made for making available full-text journals with
   the added value of indexing and judicious hyperlinking. The author
   makes his points using the experience of a scholarly journal published
   by an independent graduate school, Progress
   (http://www.phillips.org/progress.htm) -- CJC 
   
  MULTIMEDIA AND HYPERMEDIA
   
   Hurtig, Brent. "A/V Streaming Brings the Web to Life....Almost" New
   Media 6(14) (October 28, 1996):52-63. -- Libraries, archives, museums
   and universities are quickly moving to the next stage in developing
   their electronic resources: moving from text databases and static web
   pages to making available their audio/visual resources online. If you
   are considering making available your oral history archive, video
   archive, or even just adding bits of sound and moving image to
   existing text-based resources this article will be useful reading. It
   is more practical in bent than theoretical. Although it does not
   promote or discuss standards-based solutions which would be especially
   useful for non-ephemeral collections, the article is very helpful as
   an up-to-date overview of the tools and issues involved in putting
   multimedia resources online now. Streaming is the means of making
   multimedia content available to the end-user without making them
   download a huge multimedia file before viewing/playing. One can
   "stream" the content, or play it as it comes in. This makes it
   feasible to deliver these resources in an acceptable manner. The
   article covers most of the major tools and formats currently
   available, and how they do, and don't, do the job. Again, this is a
   discussion of mostly proprietary formats for streaming multimedia, but
   even they can be useful as a temporary delivery mechanism, while the
   master copy remains in a standards-based form, itself "archived",
   waiting for tools to come along for its immediate delivery. -- RR
   
   Pierce, Jeffrey. "The Image Makers: Finding A Scanner That's Right For
   You" Adobe Magazine 8(1) (November 1996): 61-65. -- So what's there to
   know about scanners? More than you may realize, and once you do you
   will want an article like this to tell you about it. Learn about
   optical resolution, dynamic range, bit depth, and a lot more that will
   help make you an effective scanner shopper and user. Learn from those
   who scan for a living. -- RT 
   
  NETWORKS AND NETWORKING
  
   "The Economics of the Internet: Too Cheap to Meter?" The Economist
   341(no. 7988) (October 19-25, 1996):23-27.
   [http://www.economist.com/issue/19-10-96/sf0774.html] -- The editors
   summarize the challenges of pricing the use of the Internet. The
   non-commercial roots of the Internet, they argue, now work against its
   effectiveness as a medium for digital commerce. Hence the meteoric
   growth of corporate intranets, and "extranets"--wide area networks
   that include business partners. "Internet II", the university-led
   initiative to build a faster network is one manifestation of this
   trend. However, Internet commerce in its current form has generated
   "halo" effects; modem users are using telephony to get to the network,
   which in some cases boosts telecommunications profits. Pricing models
   pose further difficulties. "Use-based" pricing could dampen growth,
   while flat fee pricing fails to address the fact that billing a
   customer costs more than Internet connect time does. The basic
   trade-off is between cheap (or free) flow of information at the
   expense of speed, or lightning fast service--for a fee. -- TH
   
   Maxwell, Bruce. How to Access the Federal Government on the Internet
   1997 Washington, DC : Congressional Quarterly, 1996. -- An updated and
   expanded edition of last year's publication of the same name, this
   guide includes descriptions of more than 400 federal Internet sites,
   more than 150 of which are new in this volume. The annotated entries
   explain how to access each site and describe the site's focus and
   coverage. With the Internet being such a changeable environment and
   the nature of politics being what it is (the November election has
   rendered the list of email addresses and web sites for Members of
   Congress out-of-date even before 1997 has arrived), one is justified
   in questioning the value of a printed directory to the Internet. Yet
   this book is valuable despite these anachronisms because it gives more
   than just the address of a particular site; it outlines how to conduct
   a search for federal information and provides tips about where to
   start a search and how to use some of the search tools. -- MP

   Studies" College & Research Libraries News 57(10) (November 1996):
   658-660, 671. [http://www.ala.org/acrl/resnov.html] -- The emergence
   of gay and lesbian studies as a legitimate area of academic inquiry is
   evidenced by the steady increase in books and articles related to the
   life, culture and issues of the gay and lesbian community in the
   United States and worldwide. Along with the growth of print media,
   there has been an explosion of resources on the Internet. This guide
   to Internet resources provides references to gateway sources (like
   Infoqueer http://www.3wnet.com/rainbow/gnl.html) and Web sites for
   gay and lesbian organizations (see the homepage for the Lamda Legal
   Defense and Education Fund -

   Ubois, Jeff. "Future Effect: Author and Futurist James Burke Waxes
   Philosophic on the Way the Internet is Changing Society" Internet
   World 7(12) (December 1996):76-82. -- If you want to know about the
   effect of the Internet on society, placed within an historical and
   intellectual context, who better to give it to you than James Burke?
   Although the article lacks the visual power of his TV programs, Burke
   does not disappoint. -- RT

   Hallmark, Judy and C. Rebecca Garcia. "Training for Automated Systems
   in Libraries" Information Technology and Libraries 15(3) (September
   1996):157-166. -- This article on staff and user training for library
   automated systems is a highly readable account of a series of
   interviews with staff from 49 libraries of all types. The interviewees
   describe the often painful training experiences and what they learned.
   Rather than being a dry exposition of research findings, this
   insightful and easy to read account is chock-full of useful advice.
   I'll even forgive the fact that a quote was not attributed correctly
   (apparently footnotes 7 and 8 were inadvertently switched). Anyone
   faced with training or retraining staff or users on automated systems
   would do well to study this article beforehand. -- RT
   
   Wilson, David L. "New California State Campus has Ambitious Plans for
   Technology" Chronicle of Higher Education XLIII(8) (October 18,
   1996):23-24. -- With a focus on multi-disciplinary study and
   information technology, CSU Monterey Bay has been touted as an
   experiment in high technology learning. However, according to John C.
   Ittelson, director of distance learning, "getting people to do things
   differently is a process of seduction." Although it's early to draw
   conclusions, Wilson interviews a variety of faculty and students and
   finds at least some resistance to the plan: "too much email and
   voicemail," says one professor. Yet top administrators, including
   President Peter P. Smith, are committed to finding new ways to teach,
   and show no sign of retreat from their vision. -- TH

   [http://www.infotoday.com/cilmag/oct/docdel.htm] -- The Emergency
   Medical Services Document Delivery Pilot Project
   (http://lama.kcc.hawaii.edu/ems/illdoc.html) is the third installment
   of a three part project at Kapiolani Community College in Honolulu,
   Hawaii, covering bibliographic instruction, remote access to CD-ROM
   databases and document delivery. Paramount to the project's goals was
   that research be free and available to eligible users. Patrons were
   able to request documents they found citations for, and receive
   photocopies. Because of the scope of this project, copyright violation
   was not an issue. Operating on a very small budget, this project was
   able to fill all document requests, though lack of funds made it
   difficult, when documents were not locally available. Based on the
   success of this project, the first integrated interlibrary loan system
   for KCC will be partially funded and expanded next year. -- CJC
