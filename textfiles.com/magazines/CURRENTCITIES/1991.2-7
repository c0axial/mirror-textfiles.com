Expert Systems 
 
Heller, Martin "Windows Meets AI" BYTE 16(6) (June 1991):351-354.   
Microsoft's Windows 3.0 has opened up AI applications for the  
personal computing environment by providing a protected-mode  
operation which furnishes AI applications with the necessary  
amount of memory to run efficiently and by providing a graphical  
user interface (GUI) which is greatly needed by those of us who wish  
to use AI tools.  This article  discusses a few of the new AI tools  
using Windows 3.0 : KEE (Knowledge Engineering Environment) and  
KPWIN (KnowledgePro for Windows) are well described, the first  
being a large and expensive tool and the second, a less powerful but  
more affordable tool. 
 
 
Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Heller, Marvin. "Future Documents" BYTE 16(5) (May 1991):126-135.  
Software vendors for the PC continue to make inroads on the lead  
held by Apple in the emerging hypermedia market.  This review of  
Microsoft's OLE and HP's New Wave software describes how they  
integrate text with graphics using a variety of initial software  
packages. Gradually the barriers between individual software  
products are being dissolved as linking programs like these provide  
environments in which Windows can operate on a variety of  
programs and produce documents combining spreadsheets, with text  
and graphics.  Communication between software environments that  
the programs provide enables rapid updating of changing data and the  
packages are now appearing with new, object-oriented capabilities.   
While still somewhat clunky in their operation, these packages are  
another indicator of the changes soon to come.  
 
Yi, Paul "Putting Your Mac on TV: Desktop Video" MacUser 7(8)  
(August 1991):94-108. The MacUser Labs  describe  and  test  six  
desktop video-out products ranging from relatively simple to very  
spiffy special effects-capable products.  Essentially these DTV  
(Desktop video) hardware products translate Mac output into NTSC  
video images which, to varying degrees, can be manipulated and  
edited by the Mac.  Overlays of graphics, still images and text on to  
the video output will awaken the suppressed film producer in many  
of us and open new channels for development.  While your final  
product may fall short of the quality seen on most home televisions,  
the potential for in-house  training  and  presentations  make  this   
type of video a component of the future multimedia world.  
 
 
Information Transfer 
 
Basch, Reva "Books Online: Visions, Plans, and Perspectives for  
Electronic Text" Online 15(4) (July 1991):13-23.  Basch's article is  
about electronic text using Michael Hart's (Director of the Project  
Gutenberg) definition. Basch describes several issues associated  
with e-text including input technology, standardization, copyright,  
and future use. 
 
Jackson, Mary "Library to Library" Wilson Library Bulletin (June  
1991):97-100. More than an article this is an annotated reading list  
to keep current with issues in Interlibrary Loan and information  
transfer. 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Fisher, Sharon "Whither NREN?" BYTE 16(7) (July 1991):181-189.   
Fisher investigates the ongoing discussion of who should provide the  
NREN.  Should the government start it up? or should the burgeoning  
commercial networks just grow into it? Both sides agree that it  
should ultimately be a commercial venture. 
 
Green, Roedy "Remote Connections" BYTE 16(7) (July 1991):161-168.   
Roedy covers that various types of wide-area networks and their  
resulting speeds of data transmission (the all-important parameter  
of computing).  Also included are inset articles on relay framing and  
ISDN by Bob Ryan and Janet J. Barron, respectively. 
 
Kahle, Brewster and Art Medlar "An Information System for  
Corporate Users: Wide Area Information Servers" (June 24, 1991).   
Posted as WAIS-discussion digest #13: Paper on WAIS Project on  
WAIS-DISCUSSION@think.com.  "The Wide Area Information Server  
(WAIS, pronounced "ways") project is an experimental venture  
seeking to determine whether current technologies can be used to  
make profitable end-user full-text information systems....This paper  
discusses the design and implementation of the prototype system."  
 
The National Public Telecomputing Network "Infosphere Report"  
(June 21, 1991). Available on CNIDIR-L@UNMVM.BITNET, PACS- 
L@UHUPVM1.BITNET, and other Listservs.  "This summer and fall the  
National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN), a nonprofit public  
computer network headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, will be working  
on its first annual 'Infosphere Report'Qa research report... which will  
attempt to asses the nation's capacity to effectively and equitably  
utilize telecomputing as a medium for its information and  
communications needs."  
 
Sproule, William and Jon Edwards "AppleTalk Over the Internet" BYTE  
16(7) (July 1991):293-298.  Using AppleShare and third party  
products, Princeton and Penn State Universities were able to  
establish an easy-to-use Wide-area AppleTalk network.  Sproule  
describes how this was accomplished and the future of such  
linkings.

General 
 
Bosseau, Don L. and Susan K. Martin "Librarianship, the Profession --  
Prelude to its Future" (June 21, 1991).  Posted on PACS- 
L@UHUPVM1.BITNET. Bosseau and Martin look at some of the issues  
facing librarians as roles change but perceptions don't.  Much of the  
changes that are not understood by the general public involve the  
interaction of library staff and technology.   
 
Cisler, Steve "Future of Librarianship, Comments (long)" (June 25,  
1991). Posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1.BITNET.  Apple librarian Steve  
Cisler comments on the paper written by Bosseau and Martin.  As one  
might expect, Cisler concentrates on the ramifications of new  
technologies on librarianship, and conversely how librarians can  
affect new technologies.   
 
Citizens Rights and Access to Electronic Information; A Collection  
of Background Essays Prepared for the 1991 LITA President's  
Program / edited by Reynolds, Dennis.  Chicago: Library and  
Information Technology Association, 1991.  This collection of brief  
essays solicited by LITA to distribute at the American Library  
Association 1991 meeting in Atlanta investigates such issues as  
information access, individual privacy, and intellectual freedom in  
regards to electronic information. LITA plans to publish these papers  
plus the presentations at the program itself in Fall 1991 under the  
same title (sans subtitle).

Stanley, Carol A. J. "What Technology Hath Wrought the Consumer  
Will Demand be Changed" Bulletin of the American Society for  
Information Science (April/May 1991):23-25.  Stanley suggests that  
for the 90s the consumer will drive technological developments  
rather than "technology [driving] product development." 
 
 
Forthcoming 
 
McClure, Charles R., et.al. The National Research and Education  
Network (NREN): Research and Policy Perspectives.  Norwood, NJ:  
Ablex Publishing, 1991. 
 
And everyone should be on the lookout for the September 1991 issue  
of Scientific American.  It's devoted to networks and has articles by  
Alan Kay, [Nicholas] Negroponte [of the MIT Media Lab], [Mitch] Kapor  
[creator of LOTUS 1-2-3; founder of the Electronic Frontier  
Foundation], [Vinton] Cerf [of the Corporation for National Research  
Initiatives], and others.  Should be an important work for future  
reference. -- Steve Cisler
