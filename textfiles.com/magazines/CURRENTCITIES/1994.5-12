Electronic Publishing

"Policy, Issues, and Networked Information" Serials Review 20(3) 
(1994):7-37. -- This issue has a special section of four articles 
devoted to the broad topic of the title:

* Bailey, Charles W., Jr. "Scholarly Electronic Publishing on 
the Internet, the NREN, and the NII: Charting Possible Futures" -- 
Bailey discusses various models of scholarly electronic publishing, 
goals for an electronic publishing system, the role of commercial 
publishers, and what will be required to build a network-based 
scholarly publishing system.

* Jankowska, Maria Anna. "Printed Versus Electronic: Policy Issues 
in the Case of the Environmental Journal"

* Lynch, Clifford A. "Scholarly Communication in the Networked 
Environment: Reconsidering Economics and Organizational Missions" 
-- Lynch begins by discussing the changing economics of publication 
in the networked environment, followed by a look at various missions 
of organizations involved in publishing (not all are commercial 
outfits), and then wraps up with a discussion of new models of 
information dissemination.

* Reich, Vicky and Mark Weiser. "Libraries are More Than 
Information: Situational Aspects of Electronic Libraries" -- Reich 
and Weiser argue that libraries provide much more than information, 
and that therefore any consideration of electronic libraries should 
pay heed to the situational functions libraries serve in our 
communities.
 
In addition, should you wish for a case study, you need go no 
further than a separate article in the same issue:

* Willis, Katherine, et.al. "TULIP - The University Licensing 
Program: Experiences at the University of Michigan" -- A 
description of how the University of Michigan provided access 
to the set of journals provided to them and other research 
universities in electronic form. Although it may be more instructive 
to compare all nine research library projects to provide access 
to these journals, as no two are entirely alike, the University of 
Michigan experience is nonetheless useful as a case study. -- RT


Hypermedia and Multimedia

Popovic, Mike. "Get Your Macintosh Organized" Imaging Magazine 
3(12)(December 1994):34-43. -- Many libraries and museums may 
already have several Macintosh workstations, and maybe even a 
scanner in the design office. They may still hesitate at 
creating a full-fledged imaging system because it implies buying 
new Unix workstations and training staff in a new operating 
system as well as new imaging database managers (in addition to 
the image manipulation software such as Photoshop). The hurdle 
is not so immense actually, and there are several serviceable 
options for creating an image database without a lot of money. 
This article reviews many of the commercial options specifically 
for the Mac (but also DOS) platforms for creating imaging 
workstations and management servers using regular desktop Macs. 
As is usual with Imaging Magazine, they are thorough with the 
details and contact information. -- RR
 
Pinchbeck, Daniel. "State of the Art" Wired 2(12) (December 1994)
:157-8, 206-8. -- This article explores the impact of digital 
technologies on the art world, specifically on the traditional 
forums for art sale and viewing - galleries and museums. The 
author goes a step beyond describing the Internet as a mere 
publication forum for museum events and exhibits, to describing 
it as a medium for the creation of new kinds of art. It is this 
new, conceptual and digital art that he argues will profoundly 
affect an art community centered around the sale and view of 
unique, monolithic "masterworks". The apocolyptic effect is 
perhaps overstated in that many artists will of course continue 
to create unique physical pieces. He does note however that the 
Internet will allow a new open and non-formal forum for 
disseminating this new art, and predicts that while galleries 
will shy away from such art as non-salable, museums may take the 
lead in 'hosting' such art in keeping with their more educational 
mission. -- RR
 

Networks and Networking

Gillespie, Robert G. "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About 
Internet Pricing (But Were Afraid to Ask)" Educom Review 29(6) 
(November/December 1994):42-43.  

Roberts, Michael. "Why is the Internet so Cheap?" Educom Review 
29(6) (November/December 1994):6-8. 

-- Taken together these two articles satisfy the curiosity that 
nearly all Internet users express one time or another - "who pays 
for all of this?" Roberts' article clearly enumerates the 
attributes that make the Internet inexpensive. In so doing he 
usefully compares the Internet to the telephone network and also 
warns us of changes that will threaten the historic pricing 
structure regardless of public policy decisions and debate. 
Gillespie presents his material as a series of questions and 
answers, the first of which explains the distribution of real 
costs in academic institutions where use appears as if it is 
"free." -- JLO

Jones, Russ. "Creating Clickable Image Maps" _Ora.com_ O'Reilly 
& Associates, (Fall 1994):6-8. -- This "feature article" from 
O'Reilly's catalog is actually an excerpt from their new book 
_Managing Internet Information Services_ by Cricket Liu, et al. 
The straightforward text is basically a tutorial covering one of 
the most complex yet powerful features of html and World-Wide Web 
documents--in-line clickable images. The demand is rising for 
accessible, high-quality information about creating Web resources, 
and, in typical O'Reilly fashion, this article and the book from 
which it is excerpted arrives in timely response. A complimentary 
copy of the catalog can be requested from catalog@ora.com. An 
electronic version of the catalog and the article can be found at 
[http://www.ora.com/] -- JLO

Pasicznyuk, Robert W. "Internet Resources for the Space Sciences" 
College & Research Libraries News 55(11) (December 1994):725-26. 
-- NASA's commitment to making information as widely available as 
possible means that there is an unusual wealth of information 
sources in the space sciences available on the Internet. These 
sources include a wide array of text, auditory and graphic 
information. As a general guide to resources on the space sciences, 
this article provides references to both multimedia information 
centers and relevant news and discussion groups. -- MP

Schankman, Larry. "How to Become an Internet Power User" College &
Research Libraries News 55(11) (December 1994): 718-721. -- Despite 
its mock inspirational tone, this article provides practical 
guidelines that information professionals should follow in order to 
consider themselves Internet savvy. The author suggests, among other 
things, that librarians should maintain a positive attitude about 
the quantity and diversity of information on the Net and should keep 
up-to-date on the emerging technologies and issues related to it. 
An accompanying sidebar includes references to Internet guides that 
can be downloaded as well a list of Internet lists and other 
resources for keeping up-to-date. -- MP
  
Weider, C. and P. Deutsch. "A Vision of an Integrated Internet 
Information Service" Request For Comments (RFC) 1727. Available at RFC 
repositories including anonymous ftp at nis.nsf.net(ftp://nis.nsf.net/
internet/documents/rfc/rfc1727.txt). -- This is an excellent document 
to read for those who would like to have a window into the process of 
developing Internet protocols. Produced by the Integration of Internet 
Information Resources Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task 
Force, the document lays out a vision of how services might be 
integrated over the next few years. There is a mixture of plain talk 
about functionality with details about requirements that would have to 
be met in order to realize an integration of Internet services. The 
document gives those who wonder about future developments some useful 
facts to ponder as well as an insight into how such discussions are 
codified and put into the protocol development stream. -- JLO


Optical Disc Technology

Fritz, Mark. "CD-i: The Training Machine?" CD-ROM Professional 7(6) 
(November/December 1994):125-135. -- Fritz poses the question "Is 
CD-i (Compact Disc-interactive) a dodo breathing its last breath or 
a phoenix on the rise?" in this frank and comprehensive overview of 
the technology's training applications. Recently a number of large 
companies, such as Chrysler, Johnson & Johnson, Proctor & Gamble, 
Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Texaco have joined together in an 
ambitious CD-i production and distribution co-op. CD-i is a 
particularly attractive option as a training platform/medium because 
it is portable, the CD-i players can be plugged into the ubiquitous 
television set, and it delivers both video and interactivity. -- TR

Guenette, David R. and Paul Nicholls. "CD-ROM and Multimedia Industry
Newsletters" CD-ROM Professional 7(6) (November/December 1994):154-161.
-- The authors have compiled a resource directory covering CD-ROM and
multimedia industry trade newsletters. "Industry" is defined to 
include the CD-ROM publishers, developers, distributors, investors,
and all others involved in some part of the process of planning, 
financing, creating, producing, promoting, and selling CD-ROM, as
well as the information profession working in libraries, information
centers, and MIS, and marketers and advertisers, trainers, and 
educators who use CD-ROM and multimedia titles professionally. The
authors encourage the reader to view a newsletter as falling some-
where between a publication and a consulting company, with subscribers
as the clients. A short description of the newsletter and its intended
audience along with subscription and price information is included 
for each entry. -- TR

Kalstrom, David. "CD-Recordable: The New Storage Medium for Business
and Pleasure" CD-ROM Professional 7(6) (November/December 1994):
106-112. -- Focusing more on the business aspects of CD-R, Kalstrom
writes a very strong endorsement for the use of CD-R for data
archiving. While economies of scale were the driving force behind
CD-ROM production and distribution, the advent of CD-R has made it
economically feasible for almost any type of application, regardless
of the number of the discs produced. The author contends that as the
cost of CD-R hardware continues to drop, it will become more readily
accepted as a general-purpose archiving and back-up medium that will
compete head-on with tape, rewritable magneto-optical and even hard
disk drives. -- TR

Starr, Karen. "Top Tips From Street-Wise CD-ROM Network Managers"
CD-ROM Professional 7(6) (November/December 1994):145-147. -- Starr
compiles an extremely practical and useful set of tips from six 
seasoned CD-ROM network managers. Learn from the triumphs and mis-
takes of these network sages. -- TR

Laribee, Janet F. and Carl L. Lorber. "Electronic Resources: Level
of Awareness and Usage in a University Library" CD-ROM Professional 
7(6) (November/December 1994):137-144. -- Laribee and Lorber present 
and analyze the results of a survey recently conducted at Eastern 
Illinois University's Booth Library to determine the level of 
awareness, usage, and general impressions of the library's electronic 
resources among faculty and administrators. The results of the study 
yielded two major findings: 1. a low level of awareness of some of 
the electronic resources and 2. a slight degree of dissatisfaction 
with the training and documentation on the usage of the electronic 
resources. The authors follow-up with a literature review of library
instruction targeted at faculty and a list of practical program goals 
based upon the findings of the survey. -- TR
