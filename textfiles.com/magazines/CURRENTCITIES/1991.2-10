Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Herther, Nancy K. "Interactive Multimedia at Philips: CP Interviews  
Philips' Bert Gall About CD-ROM, XA, CD-I and Their Future." CD- ROM  
Professional 4(5) (September 1991):34-37.  An up-to-date look at  
the settling of standards for Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-I) and  
the development of the bridge between PCs and CD-I.  This interview  
provides an insider's perspective on the market viability of the  
technology and the approach to its development for the future.  With  
the MPEG standard in place, companies such as Philips can begin  
introducing their own units in a unified context within the industry,  
leading to a more cohesive future market for their products. -- MT 
 
Bajarin, Tim.  "Everyone You Know Doesn't Use A Computer" Computer  
Currents 9(9) (September 24, 1991):16-19.  A short column about  
future computing with pen-based and multimedia technologies.  The  
increasingly digital world can become more accessible to those who  
do not now own a computer through developments like these. -- MT 
 
 
Information Transfer 
 
Ingebretsen, Dorothy and Steven Tice "Searching Los Angeles Times  
Dialog On Disc: The Times Editorial Library Experience" CD-ROM  
Professional (September 1991):86-90. Dialog provides the full text  
of the Los Angeles Times from 1986 to the present on CD-ROM. This  
article discusses searchable fields, Easy Menu interface geared to  
the end user, and the more sophisticated Dialog command search for  
experienced searchers. -- VR   
 
King, Alan. "Full Text & CD-Rom: Variations on a Theme." Online 15(5)  
(September 1991): 107-108. King describes the benefits of full text  
databases on CD-Rom albeit the limitations of this technology. -- VR   
 
Miller, Carmen. "End-Users: From Which Menu Should You Order?"  
Online 15(5) (September 1991): 26-33. This article reviews D-S  
Business Focus and Dialog Business Connection databases, two

legality issues of optically stored information, and the implications  
for the future. -- VR 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Barlow, John Perry "The Law Comes to Cyberspace" BYTE (October  
1991):332.  Here Barlow recounts the events in May of 1990 that led  
he and Mitch Kapor to found the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).   
See the General section below. -- DR 
 
Cerf, Vinton "The Internet Society"  reprinted through  
LISTSERV@BITNIC.BITNET (GET INTSOC CERF_V) from EDUCOM Review  
26(3/4) (Fall/Winter 1991).  Cerf explains why the Internet Society  
was founded, what it is, what its goals are, what its membership is  
and how one can get involved in this new organization that is  
expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. -- DR 
 
Kapor, Mitch "Building the Open Road: The NREN as Test-Bed for the  
National Public Network" Network Working Group RFC 1259  
(September 1991).   This paper is an excellent update on the NREN  
and NII.  Kapor suggests first that the NREN will stimulate  
technological advances yet to be imagined, and the at the NREN  
should be thought of as a prototype for the National Publia Network.   
This is a must read.  Available via anonymous ftp from nnsc.nsf.net

Nielsen, Brian. "The Coalition for Networked Information: Realizing  
the Virtual Library." Online 15(5) (September 1991): 96-97.  Nielsen  
enthusiastically describes a relatively new group, Coalition for

NREN. -- VR  
 
Roberts, Michael M. "Positioning the National Research and Education  
Network" reprinted through LISTSERV@BITNIC.BITNET (GET POSNREN  
ROBERT_M) from EDUCOM Review 26(2) (Summer 1991).  Roberts  
explains where he believes the NREN and National Information  
Infrastructure (NII) is heading as a cooperative venture between  
government, educators, and industry.  He also points out that  
technological advances in the last decade have outpaced related  
political and legal advances. -- DR 
 
Thompson, Tom "Networking with System 7.0" BYTE (September  
1991):337-340.  Thompson has worked with the new Macintosh  
system for several months, and despite "some snags" he feels the  
benefits of changing over to the new systems are worth it in the  
networked environment.  With the new system, file sharing becomes  
almost transparent, without the need for a server.  The combination  
of interapplication communication (IAC) and the Mac's publish and  
subscribe application allows users to share data while operating  
different applications.  And that's no mean feat! -- DR 
 
 
Optical Disc Technologies 
 
Bonime, Andrew "The Promise and the Challenge of CD-I" CD-ROM  
Professional 4(5) (September 1991):17-30.  This article provides a  
fairly complete overview of CD-I, which is slated for release this  
fall, with its target audience being the mass consumer market. CD-I  
is a subset of CD-ROM which includes an international set of  
standards for encoding and integrating audio, video, still pictures,  
and text. Consumer players will be priced at $1,000 initially, with  
an anticipated drop to around $500 within two years. -- TR 
 
Brooks, Martin "Multimedia and the Future of CD-ROM" CD-ROM  
Professional 4(5) (September 1991):8-10.  Martin Brooks, vice- 
president of electronic publishing at R. R. Bowker presents his  
concerns regarding the hype surrounding multimedia. He fears that  
hype generated might shift the interest from high-quality,  
extremely important research databases to any product that has  
sound and graphics in it. He poses the question: "For the researcher,  
should it not be more important to have a hypertext system that  
works intuitively than a database that plays back the mating calls of  
certain selected bullfrogs?" -- TR 
 
Brueggeman, Peter "Memory Management for CD-ROM Workstations,  
Part I" CD-ROM Professional 4(5) (September 1991):39-43.  In this  
series of two articles, Brueggeman presents a "crash course" on  
memory management in the DOS environment. In the second part of  
the series, he will give readers specific tips and ideas on how to  
maximize your hardware/software investment and more effectively  
run your CD-ROMs. -- TR 
 
Harvey, David A. "CD-ROM Drives: How Good is the Third Generation?"  
BYTE 16(9) (September 1991):268-276.  Harvey boldly suggests that  
"the winter of our discontent with CD-ROM may be over," citing the  
new "third generation" of CD-ROM drives with faster access times,  
improved data transfer rates, and lower prices than their  
predecessors. He reviews six external CD-ROM drives by Chinon,  
Hitachi, PLI, Texel, and Toshiba. -- TR 
 
Rizzo, John "Double Duty Drives: Multifunction Optical Storage"  
MacUser 7(11) (November 1991):108-114.  This article features  
reviews of multifunction optical storage drives recently released by  
Hewlett-Packard, Pioneer, and Panasonic.  These drives utilize both  
erasable optical and WORM (write once/read many) cartridges. A  
multifunction drive offers more flexibility than any other optical  
storage device. In erasable mode, a multifunction drive is slower  
than a hard-disk drive but offers nearly unlimited capacity and  
greater data security. In WORM mode, the drive can create permanent  
archives (up to 100 years) with the convenience of random access. -

Kapor, Mitch "Current Legislative and Policy Efforts" Effector Online  
[eff-news@eff.org] 1(11) (September 20, 1991).  Among other  
actions, the EFF is involved in the NREN and fiber optic planning  
activity on Capitol Hill, supporting communications privacy in the  
face of federal actions against secure encryption, joining with the  
ACLU, library organizations and IIA to oppose legislation that would  
allow the government to copyright software it produced in  
cooperation with a private firm, and the EFF also opposes legislation  
that would allow the government to charge royalty fees for  
"accessing a government electronic data base of public information."
