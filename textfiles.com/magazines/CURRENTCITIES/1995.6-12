Bank, David. "The Java Saga" WIRED 3.12 (December 1995):
166-169, 238-246. -- A fairly detailed description of the 
five year development of Sun Microsystem's object-oriented 
programming language, Java. Growing out of a project to 
build a 'simple computer for normal people' to control 
everyday appliances, Java, originally known as Oak, is now
poised to become the "DOS of the Internet." After unsuccessful 
bids for interactive TV and CD-ROM development deals in 1993, 
Java seems to have found its niche in the Internet. Java is 
platform-independent and secure, enabling a distributed 
computing environment that Sun hopes can challenge the software 
monopoly currently held by Microsoft. Sun is giving away Java 
and the HotJava browser and licensing it to huge players like 
Netscape hoping to make Java the standard before competing 
technologies (most notably, Microsoft's Blackbird) arrive on 
the scene. [Note: On Dec. 7, Microsoft announced its intent to 
license Java] -- CJC

Stowe, David W. "Just Do It: How to Beat the Copyright Racket"
Lingua Franca 6(9) (November/December 1995):32-42. -- If one
can call an article on copyright "entertaining" then it is
an adjective that I will apply to this one. Stowe's irreverent
writing style and copyright permission anecdotes make this an 
engaging as well as informative read. But if you are looking 
for permission to put up electronic copies of articles, don't 
look here for it. He's talking about scholars quoting 
(reasonably, not wholesale) from published works in their own 
academic publications. -- RT


Networks and Networking

Atkins, Robert. "The Art World & I Go Online" Art in America 
83(12) December 1995: 58-65, 109. -- The author offers a guide 
to international art resources in digital media. The guide is 
also an analysis of different media employed to deliver art 
information (or in some cases native digital art itself), as 
well as evaluation of content. Many specific sites and 
projects are mentioned to allow follow up on the reading with 
the reader's own tour through the cyber galleries of cultural 
heritage information. -- RR 

Cortese, Amy. "The Software Revolution" Business Week
(December 4, 1995):78-90.
[http://www.businessweek.com/week49/bw49toc.htm] --
If this cover story is to be believed, the future of 
software will be program components delivered on demand 
to stripped-down PCs connected to the Internet. The 
technologies that are promising this future include Sun 
Microsystem's Java computer language and Netscape's 
Navigator Web client. Those who stand to win in this 
scenario include small developers and software houses who 
are unable to break the hold that Microsoft has on the 
market. Those presumed to lose big include Microsoft, which 
has any number of individuals and smaller corporations
ecstatic over Java's possibilities. No matter what happens 
to Java, it seems apparent that there is a sea change toward 
a different software paradigm -- one that the industry has 
been moving toward with the development of such things as
OpenDoc (Apple sponsored) and OLE (Microsoft). But the
Internet may be poised to deliver that paradigm (applet by
applet) in a manner unpredicted by most and feared by some.

Courtois, Martin P., William M. Baer, and Marcella Stark,
"Cool Tools for Searching the Web" ONLINE 19(6) (November/
December 1995):15-32. -- One of the most difficult choices
facing a user of the World Wide Web is which search tool
to use from among the couple dozen that are available.
Although hampered by the long publishing cycle of print
publications (the article lacks information on Inktomi and
Excite, both recently released search tools), this is an
excellent and thorough review of seven Web search tools.
Besides the handy chart of features, the authors provide
some excellent sidebars (including one on sites that offer
"one-stop" searching of multiple tools) in addition to the
descriptive text. Anyone wanting to know more about the
different Web search options would do well to sit down
with this article and their favorite Web client. The URLs
alone are well worth tracking down this article. -- RT
 
Optical Disc Technology

Beiser, Karl. "Getting From There to Here: Remote Access 
in the Internet Era" ONLINE 19(6)(November/December 1995):
105-108. -- Speaking from personal experience as the 
coordinator of a statewide CD-ROM union catalog project,
Beiser outlines various problems and strategies related 
to providing remote access to DOS CD-ROM products over a 
TCP/IP wide area network connection. Among the options
considered: EA/2+OS/2, TSX-BBS, Linux with DOS, UNIX+BBS,
Major BBS, and BBSnet. -- TR 

Notess, Greg R. "Using CD-ROMs with the Internet" ONLINE 
19(6) (November/December 1995):40-44. -- Notess explores
two ways CD-ROM can be used in conjunction with the 
Internet for information prospecting: 1) a CD-ROM can
accompany a book with any in-text URLs, and 2) a CD-ROM
can be used to store a major Internet index and search
engine. In regard to the former, readers have the best of
both worlds. They can "curl up in their favorite chair to  
read about interesting sites on the Internet, but when it 
is time to get on the Net, they can pop the CD-ROM in its
drive and jump easily to the actual sites described in 
book." The most popular Internet index and search engine
on CD-ROM is the SuperHighway Access CyberSearch CD-ROM 
which combines the small Lycos database of Internet
resources and Frontier's SuperHighway Access Web browser.
The upshot of the CD-ROM over the online version is there
are no lines, no wait or unexpected network crashes. Of
course the major drawback to both of these innovative 
online/CD-ROM hybrids is update frequency. Unless they
are updated regularly, the information fast becomes 
obsolete, rendering the discs useless. -- TR

General

"Constant Craving" The Economist (November 11, 1995): 81-82,
94. -- This article, in the Science and Technology section, 
addresses recent research in mass storage and long-term 
storage of information. Especially with digital information, 
formats and strategies for long-term information storage & 
preservation of substantive amounts of data plague information 
specialists. There are many ways to tackle the problem: talk 
about mechanisms for refreshing data periodically, software 
based solutions such as SGML for certain information formats, 
and hardware storage solutions that are stable. This article 
covers the latter, with formats from multi-layered information 
in semi-transparent cubes read by laser, to micro-etched metal 
which does not even require a computer or software, just a 
powerful magnifier. -- RR
