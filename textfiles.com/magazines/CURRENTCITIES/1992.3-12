Electronic Publishing

Myers, Judy E., Thomas C. Wilson, and John H. Lienhard. "Surfing
the Sea of Stories: Riding the Information Revolution" Mechanical
Engineering 114(10) (October 1992):60-65.  These authors present
some ideas about the future of scholarly publishing in the 
electronic environment.  They argue that the print deluge is
already upon us and electronic publishing and access will provide
some relief for the information weary.  Myers, et al. also focus
on some the technical, economic, and social issues that need to be
addressed in order to reach this bright future.  The authors, two
of them librarians, devote the last section of the article to the
role that libraries and librarians may play in this future. - DR


Information Transfer

Lang, Laura. "Mapping the Future of Map Librarianship" American
Libraries 23(10) (November 1992):880-883.  Libraries are making 
electronic maps available to their users through PC's by using 
TIGER files, electronic maps distributed by the U.S. Census 
Bureau and geographic information system (GIS) technology.  
This combination of technology and information allows users to
create thematic maps. "such as population distribution or
transportation routes." - VR

Perez, Ernest. "ZyINDEX: Quick & Not-Too-Dirty Text Databases"
Database 15(6) (December 1992):45-52.  In his introduction, 
Perez gives an overview of text file index software products 
and their capabilities. He then goes on to describe the
ZyINDEX text file index searching and retrieval capabilities in 
particular. - VR

Stigleman, Sue. "Pro-Cite 2.0: Steady Evolution" Database 15(6)
(December 1992):68-72.  This article thoroughly describes the 
new version of the bibliographic software, Pro-Cite.  The 
changes in the new version include a more convenient procedure 
for creating authority lists; more compatibility with 
WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1, and Microsoft Word 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5, 
allowing for easier "manuscript searching" (previously known as 
"in-text referencing"); and other changes, ranging from the 
subtle to the obvious. - VR


Networks and Networking

"Accessing the NSA: John Gillmore Files Suit with the National
Security Agency" EFFector Online 4(0) (December 11, 1992).
Electronic Frontier Foundation Board Member John Gillmore has
filed suit against the NSA to obtain certain documents on 
data encryption under the terms of the Freedom of Information
Act.  Find out what happens when Gillmore obtained copies of
some of the documents from a publicly accessible library. - DR

Arms, William Y., et al. "The Design of the Mercury Electronic 
Library" EDUCOM Review 27(6) (November/December 1992):38-41.  
After a year of production, the electronic library at Carnegie 
Mellon University is beginning to take shape and fulfill its 
promise.  Included here are descriptions of the user interfaces 
currently available and in the works, the three search engines 
that can be used independently or in concert, the way 
compression is handled, as well as a sample retrieval of a 
scanned document. - DR

Electronic Networking: Research, Applications and Policy 2(3) 
(Fall 1992). Special issue on the commercialization of the 
Internet. The articles in this issue of ENRAP cover a wide
range of issues pertaining to the ongoing development of the
Internet and its commercialization, one of the more 
controversial network issues today.

o	Brown, Alison. "Whither Regional Networks" pp. 5-6. 
Brown opines that the regional networks will not whither away 
and toss their research and education clients to the commercial 
providers, but grow and diversify into regional businesses 
providing a range of services to both commercial and research 
and education clients.

o	Eldred, Susan M. and Michael J. McGill. 
"Commercialization of the Internet/NREN: Introduction" pp. 2-4. 
Eldred (the Guest Editor) and McGill provide a clear and 
succinct description of the current mixed public-commercial 
environment and introduce some of the issues and concerns 
facing users and service providers.

o	Estrada, Susan. "Commercialization and the Commercial
Internet Exchange: How the CIX Can Help Further the 
Commercialization of the Internet" pp. 24-28.  As President of
the CIX, Estrada describes how this commercial trade association
is working to enhance the network environment.  Composed of
unrestricted network service providers, the CIX works to ensure
interconnectivity among its member networks and the rest of the
Internet that can be accessed by commercial traffic.  The  CIX
also works as an advocate for the development of a more robust 
network that better meets the needs of commercial users.

o	Maloff, Joel H. "Selling Internet Service: An Ancient
Art Form on a New Canvas" pp. 17-23.  Maloff argues that selling
Internet services (access, support, information resources, etc.)
requires somewhat traditional sales techniques, but in a 
consultative mode.  Most business users are unaware of the
Internet and its possibilities, and therefore may not realize
how they might benefit from its use.  Like a reference 
librarian, the salesperson must listen to the client and read
between the lines to offer the best solution to their data
communications needs.

o	Perritt, Henry H., Jr. "Tort Liability, the First
Amendment, Equal Access, and Commercialization of Electronic
Networks" pp. 29-44.  Perritt provides a detailed look at
what liability, obligations for equal access, and First 
Amendment protections a network service provider may have.
The answers Perritt provides are not definite, as the laws
are not yet codified, and depend on the type and range of
services being provided.  Perritt points out that traditional
laws and guidelines for communications and publishing may
be applicable, and new rules should not be laid out until
more case law has been established with respect to the
digital environment.  

o	Weis, Allan H. "Commercialization of the Internet" 
pp. 7-16.  While describing the history of the Internet's 
development, Weis highlights those aspects of the network that 
have made it a success (e.g., Acceptable Use Policies, shared 
protocols, etc.). With these aspects in mind, he goes on to 
encourage a mixed-use internet that provides economies of scale, 
protection for publicly-funded networks, and unhindered 
commercial and technological development. - DR

Emtage, Alan. "Musings on the Infostructure" posted on 
PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (December 11, 1992) in two parts.  Emtage offers
some very interesting thoughts about the future of networked 
information, librarians, and technologists.  Although he is an
admitted non-librarian, Emtage displays a fairly good
understanding of many of the issues librarians are facing.  He
also believes, I think rightly, that technologists and 
librarians must establish a more cooperative and robust 
relationship.  As with most good postings, this one has 
generated some response, and hopefully there will be more, just
as the author invited. - DR

Hoffman, Ellen. "National Science Foundation Network Achieves
Major Milestone: T-1 NSFNET Now Part of Internet History" posted
on com-priv@psi.com and nren-discuss@psi.com (December 3, 1992).
Hoffman reports on the final transfer of NSFNET backbone (ANSnet)
traffic to T-3 lines running at 45 Mbps!  This is equivalent to
1,400 pages of single-spaced typed text per second, and network
traffic is increasing at a rate of 11% a month. - DR


Optical Disc Technologies

Flanders, Bruce. "Optical Imaging Project Links Spain to Southern
California" Computers in Libraries 12(9) (October 1992):27-28. 
Flanders describes a truly impressive and ambitious project
utilizing optical disc storage technology.  Housed in Spain's
Archivo General de Indias is a computer-based archiving system
in which over nine million pages of historical documents and maps
are being scanned and stored onto optical discs.  The original
documents which represent over 5.5 miles of shelving space will
ultimately be contained on 450 5.25-inch discs.  Flanders 
discusses the temporary satellite link with the Huntington 
Library in Southern California, and outlines the technical 
specifications of the project, including a description of 
Plasmon Data System's "moth-eye" technology. - TR
 
Schuler, John A. "Democracy on a Disc" CD-ROM Librarian 7(10) 
(November 1992):24-29.  This article sets the tone and the 
agenda for what is destined to become a lively monthly column 
on the pages of CD-ROM Librarian.  Schuler will ambitiously 
attempt to "examine the myriad of social, political, 
technological, practical, and economic debates shaping the 
application of CD-ROM technology by public agencies."  In this 
first column, he poses general questions of philosophy and 
public policy.  He invites readers to contribute their own 
"insights into the struggle for dominance in the new information 
order...." - TR

York, Vicki and Audrey Jean Haight. "Government Information:
CD-ROM Roundup" CD-ROM Librarian 7(10) (November 1992):14-19.
In this review of government information CD-ROM products, the 
authors describe what is going on in the rapidly expanding area 
of government CD-ROM product development.  They also suggest 
products with the widest applications for non-depository 
libraries. - TR


General

Clarkson, Mark A. "The Information Theater: You've Never Seen 
Your Data Quite Like this Before" BYTE  (November 1992):145-152.  
Clarkson describes some of the recent work in data search, 
retrieval, visualization, and manipulation coming out of Xerox 
PARC.  The Information Theater (a GUI) provides users with a 
number of impressive search techniques that employ natural 
language processing, user disambiguation, and data clustering 
to help searchers manage searches on huge full-text databases.

Hilton-Chalfen, Danny. "Information Technology, Campus Libraries, 
and Patrons with Disabilities: Emerging Issues and Access 
Strategies" EDUCOM Review 27(6) (November/December 1992):47-49.  
The author describes some of the ways IT can assist libraries in 
providing users with disabilities with better services.  CWISs, 
CD-ROMs, GUIs, and full text sources, all made available in a 
distributed environment, are fairly easy ways to use what many 
libraries already have to maximize access to information for this 
clientele. - DR

Lucier, Richard E. "Towards a Knowledge Management Environment: A
Strategic Framework" EDUCOM Review 27(6) (November/December 
1992):24-31.  Lucier illustrates the rather striking position 
that the UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge Management has put 
itself in.  They intend to became an active part of the creation 
of knowledge and its management by employing information 
technologies.  Lucier writes, "Knowledge management constitutes a 
new model for scientific communication in which faculty and a 
multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, 
and research librarians share responsibility for the collection, 
structuring, representation, dissemination, and use of knowledge 
through the use of information technologies." - DR

Lynch, Clifford A. "Beyond the Ordinary Card Catalog: MELVYL 
Learns from Years of Experience" EDUCOM Review 27(6) (November/
December 1992):20-23. Lynch provides us with a quick review of the 
history of the MELVYL system, and update of the current status, 
and a glimpse at the future of one of the more complex and 
powerful information systems around. - DR
