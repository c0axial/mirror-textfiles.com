ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING

Brown, Elizabeth W. and Andrea L. Duda. "Electronic Publishing 
Programs in Science and Technology, Part 1: The Journals" Issues 
in Science and Technology Librarianship 13 (Fall 1996-Winter 
1997). (http://www.library.ucsb.edu/istl/96-fall/brown-duda.html)
-- This survey article summarizes information on the electronic 
publishing programs of fourteen commercial and professional 
association publishers in science and technology fields. The 
tabular format makes it easy to quickly survey the offerings. Read 
it online and you can "click through" to the publisher's Web sites. 
Part two of the article to be published in the next issue will 
focus on abstracting and indexing services. -- RT

Litman, Jessica. "Copyright Law and Electronic Access to 
Information" First Monday 4 (http://www.firstmonday.dk)
-- Litman's article is adapted from a speech she gave to LITA at 
the 1996 meeting of the American Library Association. It's a 
skillful summation of the tension between "fair use" values and 
market values. Readers will also appreciate the easy-to-follow 
guide to the first draft of the "Lehman Report" which set the stage 
for the late 1996 international debate about copyright. This is a 
useful refresher on the issues. -- TH
 
"Metadata, Dublin Core and USMARC: A Review of Current Efforts" 
MARBI Discussion Paper no. 99, Library of Congress, January 21, 
1997. (gopher://marvel.loc.gov/00/.listarch/usmarc/dp99.doc) 
-- If you have no need to describe images for Internet access, and 
the word "metadata" has no meaning to you, then skip this cite. The 
rest of you should pull up a scanner and have a seat. Describing 
the essential elements of a text document or image for the purposes 
of providing access to it is the process of collecting metadata, or 
information about information. Librarians have been doing this for 
centuries, with some very powerful and yet quite complicated tools 
(MARC, AACR2, etc.). With the advent of the Internet and 
digitization technologies, we are suddenly faced with the prospect 
of trying to provide structured access to millions of individual 
images, text documents, manuscripts, sound files, movies, or 
whatever else can be stored on a computer. A simple and yet 
extensible standard for describing digital objects would allow just 
about anyone to describe their files in a way that could be 
interpreted by almost anyone else, and thus provide easy access to 
a huge amount of digital content. Right now the draft standard that 
appears to be making the greatest headway is called the Dublin 
Core, named for the town in Ohio where the first meeting was held 
to begin the process (the home of OCLC). This serves as a useful 
overview of the Dublin Core effort to date, as well as how the 
Dublin Core elements can be mapped to the USMARC format. -- RT
 
Samuelson, Pamela. "On Authors' Rights in Cyberspace: Questioning 
the Need for New International Rules on Author's Rights in 
Cyberspace" First Monday 4 (http://www.firstmonday.dk) -- Pam 
Samuelson is the best person to read in order to sort out
intellectual property and electronic media. As a professor of law 
(as well as information management) at UC Berkeley, she has 
followed the perils facing "fair use" for years. In this typically 
excellent review of the issues, she offers a realistic look at the 
legal precedents, and argues that we need to continue to balance 
competing rights and privileges or else run the risk of stifling 
technological creativity. She says, "No sooner did governments 
around the world "discover" cyberspace than they became intent on 
regulating it." And also: "New regulations may indeed only restrict 
access to information and impede the application of new technologies 
by authors and their audiences." -- TH
 
Weibel, Stuart and Eric Miller. "Image Description on the 
Internet: A Summary of the CNI/OCLC Image Metadata Workshop" D-Lib 
Magazine (January 1997). 
(http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january97/oclc/01weibel.html)
-- This article describes the third meeting of the Dublin Core 
effort (see the article "Metadata, Dublin Core and USMARC: A 
Review of Current Efforts" in this issue of Current Cites for an 
overview). This meeting focused on the particular issues regarding 
image description. The meeting led to a revision of the core 
elements to better generalize them to apply to either images or 
document-like objects. The links listed at the end of the article 
are essential references to the latest developments regarding
this important standard. -- RT


NETWORKS AND NETWORKING

Kessler, Jack _Internet Digital Libraries: The International 
Dimension_. Boston: Artech House, 1997. -- Kessler has written a 
thoughtful and thought-provoking book on international aspects of 
digital libraries. Using a writing style that is both scholarly 
and easily readable (no minor achievement), he ponders a number of 
issues that  have not yet been well considered by digital library 
developers. Although the reader may assume that the reports on 
digital library developments in specific countries serve as the 
main thrust of the work, it is actually the thematic essays that 
sandwich them that are the real heart. Notable among them are an 
interesting dissection of the term "digital library," and 
discussions of the barriers/opportunities of language, politics, 
and the standards process. The biggest mistake one can make about 
this book is thinking that it is only appropriate for those 
specifically interested in the international dimensions of digital 
libraries. These days, digital libraries are by *default* 
international in scope, whether we like it or not, and those of us 
involved with building them should be at least aware of some of the 
issues Kessler raises.  -- RT

Valauskas, Edward J. "Lex Networkia: Understanding the Internet
Community." First Monday 4 (http://www.firstmonday.dk). 
-- First Monday editor Valauskas  explores the self-regulating 
nature of Internet communities, and the absence of any awareness 
among would-be regulators as to how these communities work.  He 
provides a list of definitions, parameters, codes of conduct and 
social protocols as evidence of a lively electronic space, and 
argues that an upward initiative to codify this culture into a 
"lex networkia" might be the best strategy for preserving it in 
the face of the current challenge of formal government regulation.

GENERAL

Murphy, Kate. "Moving from the Card Catalogue to the Internet: 
To Control the Information Glut, Librarians Become More 
Technologically Oriented." New York Times (January 6, 1997):C15.
-- Technologically-minded librarians who have been at it for a 
good long time may allow themselves a snicker at being "discovered" 
by the New York Times. Librarians have been involved not only in 
using new technology but exploring solutions to the problems users 
face, and Murphy finds a growing realization that this is a rather 
important--even marketable--set of skills.  She also spins a good 
tale of technological innovation in libraries, particularly in the 
law and corporate sectors.  And, recent MLIS graduates, take heart: 
according to the Times, corporate recruiters are beginning to show 
up at library schools, on the lookout for a few good information 
managers! -- TH
