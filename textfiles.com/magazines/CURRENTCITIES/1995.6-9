Electronic Publishing

Gasaway, Laura N. "Scholarly Publication and Copyright in Networked
Electronic Publishing" Library Trends 43(4) (Spring 1995): 679-700. 
-- A very useful and informative article that surveys the current 
and impending broad changes in the way scholars have, do and will 
publish their works. The opening brief, yet detailed history of 
scholarly publishing does a good job of providing a context for 
the new role of electronic publishing in academics. As one might 
expect, much of the article is a discussion of copyright basics as 
it applies to the academic publishing world. This section provides 
an excellent overview of this complex issue. -- DR

Hickey, Thomas B. "Present and Future Capabilities of the Online 
Journal" Library Trends 43(4) (Spring 1995): 528-543. -- A sound, 
even-handed discussion of some of the primary issues facing the 
online journal. Hickey addresses his topic by providing lists of 
the advantages and disadvantages for several of the challenges, 
both general and specific, which surround the debate about the 
online journal. The treatment of the subject is broad enough that 
it addresses many of the same issues being debated concerning 
electronic publishing in general. It would serve well as a primer 
for anyone with a basic interest in the issues surrounding 
electronic publishing and in the direction it may be headed.

Ide, Nancy and Jean Veronis, ed. "The Text Encoding Initiative:
Background and Contexts" Computers and the Humanities 29(1) 
(1995) -- In an effort to provide much needed 'background and 
context for the contents of TEI Proposal 3', Computers and the 
Humanities is dedicating three issues of Volume 29 to the Text 
Encoding Initiative. Parts I and II, General Topics and 
Document-wide Encoding Issues are covered in this first issue. 
The second issue will contain Part III, Encoding Specific Text 
Types, and the third, Part IV, Special Encoding Mechanisms. With 
a preface by Charles Goldfarb, inventor of SGML, and introduction 
by the editors of the triple issue, Ide and Veronis, this 
collection of papers introduces the Text Encoding Initiative and 
provides illuminating discussions of many topics essential to the 
TEI-conformant encoding of electronic texts. C.M. Sperberg-McQueen 
and Lou Bernard, the editors of the Guidelines for Electronic Text 
Encoding and Interchange, provide a good introduction to the 
guidelines, commonly referred to as TEI P3 (TEI Proposal number 
3). This issue also contains the following papers: "The TEI: 
History, Goals, and Future" by Nancy Ide and C.M. Sperberg-McQueen, 
"What is SGML and How Does It Help?" by Lou Bernard, "Character 
Representation" by Harry Gaylord, "The TEI Header and the 
Documentation of Electronic Texts" by Richard Giordano and 
"Practical Considerations in the Use of TEI Headers in Large 
Corpora" by Dominic Dunlop. Taken as a whole, the triple issue 
promises to be a rich and valuable reference work. -- CJC

Jacobson, Robert L. "'Fair Use' Impasse" Chronicle of Higher 
Education 41(49) (September 18, 1995): A20, A22. -- In another 
discussion about the conflict between copyright holders who want 
to restrict access to electronic information and professionals 
such as educators and librarians who seek to make information as 
widely available as possible, this article presents the issues 
associated with the concept of "fair use" in the electronic age. 
The author predicts that unless professionals from the academic 
community participate more actively in the debate, soon-to-be-issued 
Clinton Administration guidelines on copyright will favor the 
publishing industry thus threatening educational and scholarly 
interests. -- MP
 
Lancaster, F.W. "The Evolution of Electronic Publishing" Library 
Trends 43(4) (Spring 1995): 519-527. -- Offering a summary of the 
development of electronic publishing over the last 30 years, this 
article outlines four basic yet co-existent steps in the evolution 
of electronic publishing: 1) Using computers to generate conventional 
print-on-paper publications allowing new capabilities such as 
printing on demand or producing customized publications tailored to 
individual needs. 2) Distributing text electronically which is the 
exact equivalent of the paper version; this includes full-text 
articles available through commercial vendors such as DIALOG and 
projects such as TULIP which provide electronic access to text and 
graphics of journals which are also available in print form. 
3) Distribution in electronic form of print publications providing 
"value-added" features such as search capabilities and data 
manipulation. 4) Generating publications that take advantage of such 
electronic capabilities as hypertext, hypermedia, sound and motion. 
In addition to outlining the history of electronic publishing, 
Lancaster provides an in-depth analysis of electronic journals and 
discusses sustainability of electronic journals and the role that 
they play in scholarship. -- MP
 
Lancaster, F.W. "Attitudes in Academia Toward Feasibility and 
Desirability of Networked Scholarly Publishing" Library Trends 
43(4) (Spring 1995): 741-751. -- In a survey of university 
library directors and academic administrators, the author sought 
to determine attitudes toward the electronic distribution of 
scholarly publications. While university administrators felt 
that there were significant benefits associated with electronic 
publishing, it was widely felt that there were many obstacles to 
the academic community's ability to implement an electronic 
publishing network. Benefits associated with electronic publishing 
included the reduction of costs in disseminating electronic 
information, the potential for more timely publication of research 
articles, more effective current awareness through electronic 
profile matching, and the idea that academia could have greater 
control over its own research results therefore freeing itself from 
commercial interests. However, these benefits were outweighed by 
the fact that the administrators who were surveyed felt that 
academia is not well-equipped financially or technologically to 
support widespread networked scholarly publishing. -- MP
 
Weiss, Jiri. "Digital Copyright: Who Owns What?" New Media 5(9) 
(September 1995): 38-43. -- Any library or museum involved in a 
digital media project has become, perhaps unwittingly, a 
developer and arbitrator, if not owner, of digital content. So, 
whether you are adding value to information in the form of a 
catalog, or creating primary source material in the form of an 
educational CD-ROM you need to be informed about digital copyright 
from all angles. This article is very helpful in that respect, 
outlining the issues and some proposed solutions (such as a 
copyright service bureaus as opposed to individual contracts). 
Also useful is the contact info for further reading, current 
projects, and groups mentioned in the article. -- RR


Multimedia and Hypermedia

Penn State Imaging Committee. "Imaging for Process Improvement: Report 
of the Imaging Committee" [http://www.psu.edu/computing/imaging.html] 
-- This report outlines the recommendations to Penn State University 
administration on the use of imaging technology. The report covers 
administrative and business use as well as archiving and educational 
use of imaging. The report, laid out generally and with concise 
recommendations and considerations, serves as a useful reference 
as to how one university is planning for the long-range use of 
imaging. -- RR
 
Platt, Charles. "Interactive Entertainment: Who Writes It? Who Reads 
It? Who Needs It?" Wired 3(9) (September 1995): 145-149, 195-197. 
-- As digital hypermedia (most notoriously as CD-ROMs and WWW sites 
currently) is adapted from research use to entertainment, the 
conundrum appears that hypermedia is well-suited to organizing 
access to layers of discrete research facts, even context, but it 
is less suited to storytelling or other linear forms of information 
most used for entertainment, and often pedagogy as well. This article 
explores the apparent rift between author and user control, asking 
whether user-control really equals user-engagement. Hypermedia is not 
trounced by any means, but rather implicit in the article is the 
suggestion that digital hypermedia, like cinema before it, needs to 
stop relying on previous-media modes of operation and invent its own. 
This article will be useful to anyone developing hypermedia 
interfaces for educational or entertainment use. -- RR

Schussler, Terry and Tim Tully. "Compression Tips for QuickTime 
Video: Codecs" New Media 5(9) (September 1995): 79-80. -- An 
intermediate level technical article about video compression codecs. 
The advantages and drawbacks of each codec built into QuickTime are 
outlined to help you decide which to select in your QuickTime editing 
software for your purposes (archiving video, playback for delivery, 
etc). -- RR


Networks and Networking

Lowry, Charles B., "Preparing for the Technological Future: A Journey 
of Discovery" Library Hi Tech Issue 51 13(3) (1995):39-54. -- Lowry, 
the university librarian at Carnegie Mellon University, examines 
several steps which are crucial for building the "virtual library" 
paradigm. Technologies which give users easy access to information 
and provide for user privacy and royalty tracking must be assembled. 
Bodies of substantive data must be digitized. Copyright laws need to 
support distributed electronic libraries and networked access. The 
success of the virtual library depends on the use of open systems and 
standards such as Z39.50 to promote interoperability. Searching 
results can be improved by moving from Boolean or keyword-based 
retrieval to natural language processing (NLP) which yields more 
precise results in searches of full-text databases. A subject-oriented 
approach to indexing Internet resources should be implemented. 
Libraries must migrate from traditional OPACs to GUI environments 
capable of the multimedia available. Some examples of how Carnegie 
Mellon is using information technology and NLP to build the 
foundations of the virtual library round out this informative article.

Weibel, Stuart L. "The World Wide Web and Emerging Internet Resource 
Discovery Standards for Scholarly Literature" Library Trends 43(4) 
(Spring 1995): 627-634. -- Weibel has penned one of the best 
overviews I've ever seen of the current benefits and future potential 
of the Web for scholarly communication and publishing. He outlines a 
set of problems relating to this technology and discusses ways of 
addressing them. Weibel's insight into the issues is remarkable, and 
is matched by a clear and engaging writing style. If you must limit 
your reading to only essential pieces, this article should top the 
list. If you are an information professional, you cannot afford to 
be ignorant of the issues Weibel so clearly and insightfully 
describes. -- RT

Weissinger, Nancy J. and John P. Edwards. "Online Resources for 
Internet Trainers" College & Research Libraries News 56(8) 
(September 1995): 535-539, 572. -- A bibliography of selected 
Internet training materials available over the Internet, this 
article provides a timely list of course materials that may be 
helpful in planning and constructing Internet training sessions 
or programs. It also lists references to online courses and 
tutorials that have been developed and made available on the 
Internet as well as a list of online reference sources and 
subject guides. Also included is a list of newsgroups and 
listservs of particular interest to Internet trainers. -- MP
