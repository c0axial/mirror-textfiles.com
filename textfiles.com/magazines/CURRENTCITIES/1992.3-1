Schank, Roger C. "Where's the AI?" AI Magazine 12(4) (Winter
1991):38-49.  This is an excellent article giving a non-technical
perspective on the present state of artificial intelligence
development.  Mr. Schank presents four common viewpoints on what
AI is, and gives his opinions on their misconceptions or their
limited implementation value.  He concludes the article with a
discussion of what is necessary to produce "real AI." Mr. Schank's
ideas do much to turn old conceptions of AI over on their backside,
but the ideas are clear and well-reasoned. -- LR 
 
Information Transfer  

Butler, Brett. "The Electronic Library Program: Developing Networked 
Electronic Library Collections" Library HIGH TECH 9(2) (1991):21-30. 
Butler, director of development for Memex Research Institute, describes 
the Electronic Library Program. The E-Library, "conceived as a
collection within a library organization, not an independent
electronic replacement for a library," uses existing catalogs or
published indexes, scanned published documents, etc. to create a
large, publicly available indexed electronic image collection for
access and retrieval. -- VR  

Grotophorst, Clyde W. "CLS: An ILL Management System for User-
Generated Requests." Library Software Review 10(5) (September/
October 1991):320-326. This article describes an ILL system that 
promises to reduce ILL costs drastically. By allowing the user 
to create ILL requests using an interface to common databases, 
the need for staff involvement in verification of bibliographic 
information, selection of location, etc. is minimized. -- VR   

 
Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Tiefel, Virginia "The Gateway to Information: A System Redefines
How Libraries Are Used" American Libraries 22(9) (Oct. 1991):858-
860.  A description of the Gateway at the Ohio State University.  
Composed of an online catalog, periodical indexes, CD-ROM databases
and special databases, Gateway provides a common interface to these
systems, allowing the user access to multiple sources with a single
search query.  Gateway also offers a library guide similar to the
UC Berkeley Library's Hyperguide, but with the addition of an
online catalog.  An exciting development in the integration of
hypermedia in bibliographic instruction and as catalog search
engine. -- MT  

EDUCOM Review 27(1) (Jan/Feb 1992).  An issue
devoted to Multimedia in education featuring the following
articles:   
 
*  "Integrated Technologies: An Approach to Establishing Multimedia
Applications for Learning" by Garland C. Elmore where multimedia
projects from Integrated Technologies at Indiana University-Purdue
University are described.    
 
*  "Institutional Support for Improving Instruction with
Multimedia" by Fred Hofstetter of the University of Delaware.  
Support for Multimedia projects is most effective when integrated
throughout the institution.  A coordinating group, the
Instructional Technology Center, provides the leadership and
instruction for an increasing number of campus instructional
applications.    
 
*  "Collaborative Design in a Networked Multimedia Environment" by
Geraldine K. Gay and Robert J. Thomas describes the enhancement of
an engineering curriculum through the use of networked multimedia
for design projects.    
 
*  "Imaging Systems: An Overview for Management" by Gene Sherron. 
Diverse imaging projects highlight the potential for organizational
improvement of catalogs and filing systems.  Digitized documents
can enable simultaneous use and make document filing and retrieval
more accurate and less time-consuming.    
 
*  "Can Multimedia Instruction Meet Our Expectations?" by Loretta
L. Jones and Stanley G. Smith.  A theoretical perspective on the
impact of multimedia on education, weighing the costs and benefits
of the medium in this setting. -- MT

proposing the establishment of electronic library collections now. 
In this article he discusses the possibilities of creating
electronic versions of library collections using a combination of
image databases and indexes.  Included here are hardware
specifications, the economic issues, a collection development
strategy, and a list of applications already being implemented. --

benefits they list are: better health care; lifelong learning;
improved services for senior citizens, the disabled, and the
housebound; enhanced industrial design and intelligent
manufacturing technology; and broader access to public and private
databases, electronic mail, and other unique resources. -- DR

Nicholls, Paul T. "Sex, Lies and CD-ROM: The Seven Deadly Sins of
CD-ROM Revisited" CD-ROM Professional 4(6) (November 1991):126-129.
This article examines the so-called seven deadly sins of CD-ROM,
coined in the late 1980s by a "vocal group of devil's advocates
[who] dared to run against the stream and point up a number of
shortcomings of CD-ROM in the midst of a generally mad climate of
optimistic hoopla." The deadly sins are hardware compatibility,
software compatibility, space requirements, training needs,
scheduling and security, hidden costs, and licensing restrictions. 
Nicholls re-evaluates each of these sins, and concludes that while
problems still remain, the initial barriers to CD-ROM
implementation have been overcome. -- TR 
 
Rogers, Michael "Sony's Electronic Book: A New Library Format?"
Library Journal 116(19) (November 15, 1991):26-28. Rogers
introduces the latest release from Sony in his "Automation News"
column. Weighing less than two pounds, the Data Discman Electronic
Book Player is essentially a scaled-down, battery-operated CD-ROM
workstation, and the electronic books are equally reduced CDs
(approximately 3" as compared to the standard 4.25" discs).
Acknowledging that a 3.4" screen may be hard on the eyes, Sony has
added a video output jack that would allow the player to be hooked
up to a TV just like a VCR. The Discman, bundled with three titles,
retails for $549.95. -- TR

Langschied, Linda "The Changing Shape of the Electronic Journal"
Serials Review 17(3) (Fall 1991):7-14.  In this article Ms.
Langschied gives a good review of the current state of electronic
journals.  The three commonly cited points in favor of e-journals
(low cost; short or no publication lag; and interactive
communication between scholars/writers) are reiterated and updated
here. She includes an interesting treatment of the concern for the
viability/ acceptance of e-journals and points to the pivotal role
libraries and librarians may have in determining their future. --
