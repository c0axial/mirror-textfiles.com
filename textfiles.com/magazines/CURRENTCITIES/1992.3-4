Electronic Publishing 

de Klerk, Ann "Electronic Publishing and Networking '92" College & Research 
Libraries News. 53(3) (March 1992):181-182.  A brief article highlighting the 
goings on at this first annual conference sponsored in part by Meckler 
Publishing, Inc.  Issues of copyright, marketing, and pricing were among the 
topics addressed at the conference by such speakers as: Mitchell Kapor, 
founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Pat Morgan of the American 
Academy for the Advancement of Science, and Karen Hunter of Elsevier. - LR

Bailey, Charles W., Jr. "Networked-based Electronic Serials"  Information 
Technology and Libraries 11(1) (March 1992):29-35.  The revolution of 
electronic publishing has created both opportunities and difficult questions 
for librarians interested in providing access to electronic serials.  Mr. 
Bailey points out several problems of providing access to serial materials 
which are available only via commercial electronic information systems (e.g. 
preservation, cost, availability, etc.).  While these problems are quite real, 
the most significant opportunities in electronic publishing may very well 
reside within the non-commercial international computer networks.  And while 
much of the information currently published on the net still mimics the 
paper equivalent, he foresees a move toward complex multimedia information
systems, and hence different publishing "packages" than those currently used.

Mr. Bailey considers the question of whether electronic conferences could be 
construed as serials.  His conclusion is, appropriately, inconclusive, "Are they
serials?  Quite possibly." [Quite possibly they are beasts of a new kind, not 
yet defined nor treated by current cataloging standards. -lr]  In considering 
the future of electronic serials, Mr. Bailey identifies 12 pressing problems 
which still need to be overcome (regarding storage, archiving, intellectual 
property laws, indexing, etc.).  The article ends with an stirring call to 
action on the behalf of networked-based electronic serials.  - LR


Expert Systems and Artificial Intelligence

Ridley, M.J. "An Expert System for Quality Control and Duplicate Detection in 
Bibliographic Databases" Program: Automated Library and Information Systems 
26(1) (Jan 1992):1-18.  QUALCAT (Quality Control in Cataloging) is the name 
given to a project at the University of Bradford which uses an expert system
to relieve the catalog of duplicate monographic records.  First, records (in 
UKMARC format) are transferred into a relational database and the records are 
compared to determine whether there are duplicates (given the variation in 
record quality and cataloging style, this is no trivial task); once duplicates 
are identified the system tests for record quality and identifies (based on 
defined criteria) the catalog's best record for the title. - LR


Hyper- and Multimedia

Electronics 65(3) (March 1992).  A trio of articles from this business-
oriented journal address some of the obstacles that thwart the progress of 
multimedia development:

o	Curran, Lawrence "A Glut of Standards Slows Multimedia" pp. 34-35. 
Curran presents the standards debate as another of multimedia's obstacles to 
full consumer acceptance.  Activities of the Interactive Multimedia 
Association (IMA), the Multimedia PC Marketing Council and others seeking 
cross-platform compatibility that could potentially simplify the proliferation 
of industry standards in multimedia.  

o	Shandle, Jack "Chip Makers Take Aim at Multimedia Market" p. 36. 
This article looks at developments in microprocessor functionality that 
address multimedia applications.. By advancing multimedia hardware 
development, vendors can cultivate the field for software developments 
built on improved microprocessor capabilities.

o	-- "Multimedia's New Motto: Partner to Profit" pp. 30-32. Shandle 
reviews some of the new partnerships between multimedia vendors.  The 
Microsoft/Tandy Multimedia PC consortium faces the Kaleida alliance of IBM 
and Apple in a battle for the buying public that could yield improved 
multimedia consumer products. - MT

Ito, Russell "QuickTime in Action"  MacUser 8(5) (May 1992):84- 92.  Desktop 
video and multimedia authoring are among the many contributions that 
QuickTime makes to the Mac user.  Carrying forward Apple's pilot/passenger 
metaphor, the QuickTime capabilities for each are spelled out in detail with 
future plans outlined for presently missing capabilities such as spreadsheet 
integration.  Equipment needs and limitations of the current release are also 
described. - MT

Kawasaki, Guy "Let the QuickTimes Roll" MacUser 8(5) (May 1992): 25-26.  
In a forthright critique of the fad of multimedia, Kawasaki raises important 
concerns about why multimedia may be over-hyped.  Rather than being seen 
as a solution in search of a problem, multimedia must emerge as a tool that 
can be used to address a variety of needs if it is to grow into its full 
potential.  Suggestions that could improve the viability of multimedia 
deserve a closer look by vendors who hope to create lasting products. - MT 

Luskin, Bernard J.  "Designing Interactive Media: Sizzleware in CD-I" CD-ROM
Professional 5(2) (March 1992):93-95.  Analysis of  multimedia design 
principles with reference to CD-I capabilities.  User learning curves, issues 
of cognitive science and hardware are  briefly discussed. - MT

Yager, Tom "Practical Desktop Video" BYTE 17(4) (April 1992):106-114.  The 
first of a four-part series from the BYTE Multimedia Lab on how to put 
multimedia to work, this article features a  multi-platform evaluation of 
desktop video production.  The integration of video with text, graphics and 
audio still relies on  specialized hardware and software combinations, but 
improvements in desktop video continue to fill in the huge gap between 
broadcast quality video and home movies.  A comparison weighing quality 
and ease-of-use illustrates the area where future improvements will be  
made in the field. - MT


Information Transfer

Casorso, Tracy "NCSU Transmission Project" posted on ILL-L@UVMVM.Bitnet 
(6 April 1992).  Casorso reports on an ongoing research and demonstration 
initiative involving the NCSU Libraries and Computing Center and the 
National Agricultural Library investigating the transmission of documents 
across electronic networks directly to the researcher's computer.  The 
preliminary findings indicate that the technology is feasible but that "the 
research library community is not as well prepared to investigate 
networking issues as one might expect and that Internet reliability is 
questionable." - VR

Lynch, Clifford A. "Text Encoding Initiative: Summary Progress Report" ASIS 
Bulletin 18(3) (February/March 1992):21-22.  As reflected by the title, this 
is a summary progress report.  The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) will be 
producing a revised copy of its "Guidelines for the Encoding and Interchange 
of Machine Readable Texts."  Lynch explains that these guidelines are 
intended to suggest standards for entering texts into electronic form, 
exchanging them, and sharing analyses of these texts.  These guidelines are 
intended for scholars in the humanities and social sciences. - VR

Stigleman, Sue "Bibliography Formatting Software: A Buying Guide"  Database 
15(1) (February 1992):15-27.  Stigleman reviews various  personal file 
management software packages, including Pro-Cite, Artfile, Notebook. - VR

Au, Ka-Neng "Hardware Options: From LANs to WANs" CD-ROM Librarian  
7(3) (March 1992):12-17.  As the title suggests, this article reviews the 
plethora of CD-ROM networking configurations currently available, each 
suited to a particular environment.  "The question today," writes Au, 
"becomes 'What network?' rather than 'Why network?'" - TR

Berry, John "CD-ROM: The Medium of the Moment" Library Journal  117(2) 
(February 1, 1992):45-47.  This eye-opening survey conducted by Cahners 
Research for LJ shows just how firmly CD-ROM technology has entrenched 
itself in libraries of all types.  CD-ROM databases have become more popular 
than their online counterparts in the majority of the 608 libraries surveyed.  
Public libraries projected the largest  average expenditure on CD-ROM 
software in fiscal year 1991-92 (Public: $13,533; Academic: $10,519; Special: 
$8,162). - TR

LaGuardia, Cheryl and Chuck Huber "Digital Dreams: A CD-ROM Users' Wish 
List" Library Journal 117(2) (February 1, 1992):40-43.  After installing 
nearly 80 CD-ROM databases running on 20 different software packages, 
LaGuardia and Huber have compiled an intelligent and entertaining list of 
pet-peeves and suggestions that CD-ROM vendors should heed.  Their wish 
list runs the gamut, including pricing, installation, interface, documentation 
and support issues. -TR

O'Connor, Mary Ann "Emerging Standards for CD-ROM Development" CD-ROM 
Professional 5(2) (March 1992):135-137.  Citing the establishment of

technology, O'Connor provides an overview of the status of current CD-ROM 
standards discussions, proposals and activities. - TR

VonVille, Helena M. and Bruce A. Weaver "Downloading From CD-ROM: A 
Preliminary Survey" CD-ROM Professional 5(2) (March 1992):48-49. This 
article presents the results of an informal survey conducted by a task force 
appointed by the Ohio State University Libraries regarding downloading data 
from CD-ROM workstations.  Although downloading is one avenue libraries 
can explore in an effort to reduce the recurring costs of CD-ROM printing, few 
of the libraries surveyed actively encourage or advertise its availability as 
an option...yet. - TR 


General Category 

Postman, Neil.  Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology.  New 
York: Knopf, 1992.  While Postman takes shots at technology, he has not 
written a diatribe against it.  Taking a long view of technology and its 
effects on culture through the ages though, the author argues that "the 
accusation can be made that the uncontrolled growth of technology destroys 
the vital sources of our humanity." - DR

Saunders, Laverna M. "The Virtual Library Today"  Library Administration  
& Management 6(2) (Spring 1992):66-70.  This article looks at where the 
library community stands in the realization of the virtual library.  Ms. 
Saunders identifies several projects which have furthered the community 
toward the goal of a virtual library (e.g. project Ariel, which allows for 
high quality images to be scanned and transmitted for document delivery; the  
transparent gateway connections which many OPACs now provide, such as the
MELVYL system; access to full-text databases, etc.).  She also describes  
several pilot projects which are currently shaping the future of the  
electronic library.  She asks several important questions which will  prove 
crucial to the implementation of a virtual library: what mixture  of paper 
and electronic sources is appropriate?  How do we ensure that information 
stored electronically will be preserved?  Furthermore, the need to train 
naive users in the use of technology and about the available information 
sources is identified.  The article concludes with short descriptions of the 
agenda for the Coalition for Networked Information and of the National 
Research and Education Network. - LR
