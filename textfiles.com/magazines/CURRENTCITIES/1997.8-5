  DIGITAL LIBRARIES
   
   Cameron, Robert D. "A Universal Citation Database As a Catalyst For
   Reform in Scholarly Communication" First Monday 2 (4) (April 7, 1997)
   [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/cameron/]. Cameron lays out
   a proposal for a universal, Internet-based, bibliographic and citation
   database. It would link all scholarly work ever written, no matter
   what the format. This seems a little ambitious, but it's an
   interesting solution to information retrieval over networks, and very
   much in line with digital library strategies that would blend together
   primary materials and search protocols. Stepping back from the abyss
   of the "big idea", the author names a more feasible initial goal: a
   "semi-universal citation database. - TH
   
   Dempsey, Lorcan and Rachel Heery. A Review of Metadata: A Survey of
   Current Resource Description Formats Work Package 3 of Telematics for
   Research project DESIRE (RE 1004) (19 March 1997)
   [http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/DESIRE/overview/]. Stu Weibel of
   OCLC, who has been laboring in the metadata orchard for years, calls
   this report "the single most comprehensive survey of metadata
   standards and issues that I am aware of." Such strong endorsement
   should make all those interested in metadata issues on the Internet
   run, not walk to the site where this report can be found (the
   excellent site maintained by the UKOLN Metadata Group at
   http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/). - RT

   "The New Zealand Digital Library MELody inDEX" D-Lib Magazine (May
   1997) [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may97/meldex/05witten.html]. - It is
   every librarian's dream of a music retrieval system -- hum a few bars
   of faintly remembered melody and up pops a list of tunes that match or
   nearly match your imperfect performance. Unrealistic? Impossible? Not
   really, says the New Zealand Digital Library
   (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~nzdl/). A group of researchers there
   have a prototype music retrieval system called MELDEX
   (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~nzdl/meldex) that promises to do just
   that. How they are doing it, the problems they face, and how they
   (mostly) are overcoming them is what this article is about. The
   technical details are for the most part understandable to someone new
   to music retrieval, and some of the problems they face will sound
   familiar to anyone with retrieval experience of any kind (does it come
   as any surprise that users are often found to be inaccurate when
   singing a few bars of their favorite tune?). By some stroke of luck,
   it turns out that melodies are recognizable regardless of the key in
   which they are sung. I guess there's hope for those of us who are
   musically challenged after all. - RT
   
   Peters, Carol and Picchi, Eugenio. "Across Languages, Across Cultures:
   Issues in Multilinguality and Digital Libraries" D-Lib Magazine (May
   1997) [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may97/peters/05peters.html]. Digital
   Library research and development has, until recently, tended to avoid
   the issues of multilingual presentation and access. However, we can no
   longer assume that our audience is for the most part English speaking.
   In this unusually clear article, Carol Peters and Eugenio Picchi
   present the major issues involved in creating a multilingual interface
   for your digital library environment and some of the approaches
   presently under development. Having had, recently, to deal with a
   number of non-English character sets for a large project, I especially
   appreciated the authors coverage of multiple language recognition and
   representation in HTTP and HTML. It is, by far, the best summary of
   the direction standards are taking that I have read. Also covered here
   are the approaches to multilingual retrieval now being experimented
   with, including machine translation, knowledge-based techniques
   (dictionaries and thesauri), and corpus-based techniques. Finally
   Peters and Picchi present a practical example incorporating thesauri
   and digital corpora which seems to have promise for large collections.

   Price-Wilkin, John. "Just-in-Time Conversion, Just-in-Case
   Collections" D-Lib Magazine (May 1997)
   [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may97/michigan/05pricewilkin.html]. - In
   this article, Price-Wilkin builds a compelling case for storing
   digital library resources (whether pages of text or images) in the
   richest possible format (for example, SGML-encoded text or
   high-resolution TIFF images) and converting them on-the-fly for
   display. This enables the University of Michigan' Digital Library
   Production Service (DLPS) to easily deliver the best possible format
   given the user's capabilities. As the Web evolves, simple changes to
   the conversion programs enables the delivery of a format that can take
   advantage of new capabilities. The DLPS reports that conversion
   happens fast enough to be undetected by the user -- an essential
   characteristic of any just-in-time conversion scheme. Another benefit
   of storing highly-structured versions of digital documents is the
   ability to repurpose documents in various ways. Examples offered
   include the ability to recombine portions of different documents into
   new ones or to display only the hierarchical view desired (for
   example, section headings). All digital library developers would do
   well to consider the techniques Price-Wilkin and others have
   pioneered. - RT
   

  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING
   
   Dougherty, Dale. "The XML Files: Multidimensional Files That Go Beyond
   HTML" Web Review (May 16, 1997)
   [http://webreview.com/97/05/16/feature/]. Murray Maloney, co-author of
   "SGML and The Web," is quoted here as saying "HTML is the low-end
   Volkswagen of markup languages and SGML is the high-end Rolls Royce."
   The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is an attempt to create a
   mid-range vehicle that does more than HTML but at less of an overhead
   cost than SGML. This Web Review cover story is actually four pieces,
   including a Real Audio interview with Steve Bray, who has been
   instrumental in the development of the XML specification, a
   transcribed interview with Murray Maloney (a member of the XML Working
   Group), and a guide to XML resources. Take my word for it, XML has the
   potential to be big. Real big. If you publish information on the
   Internet you cannot afford to be ignorant of XML. - RT
   
   Giussani , Bruno. "A New Media Tells Different Stories" First Monday
   2(4) (April 7, 1997)
   [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/giussani/]. Giussani is a
   Swiss writer who frequently contributes to the New York Times. In this
   article, he tackles a subject that is very much on the minds of
   newspaper publishers, namely, what papers will be like in five years?
   He explores the many angles of this white-knuckle question with
   considerable flair. Even when he declares the obvious ("The newspaper
   is no longer a product. It becomes a place"), the surrounding
   discourse is original and thought-provoking. He recognizes that online
   readers behave differently from newspaper readers (some surf, some
   search, some cherry-pick), and one hopes that his publishers are
   listening to him in this regard. It's nice to see a journalist
   assessing how to adapt the time-honored newsrag with the radically
   different world of the Net. - TH

   
  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
   
   Goldhaber, Michael. "The Attention Economy of the Net" First Monday
   2(4) (April 7, 1997)
   [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/]. Goldhaber
   writes in his abstract that "if the Web and the Net can be viewed as
   spaces in which we will increasingly live our lives, the economic laws
   we will live under have to be natural to this new space. These laws
   turn out to be quite different from what the old economics teaches, or
   what rubrics such as 'the information age' suggest." He goes on to
   argue that value on the Net is defined by the attention span of
   viewers, and this is quite different -- perhaps even incompatible --
   with an industrial-money-market. Commercial success will come first to
   those who understand how to measure attention spans, and to tailor
   products and services to the varying styles of attention that internet
   users possess. - TH


  MULTIMEDIA & HYPERMEDIA
   
   Bruce, Roger. "Digital Photography - Liquifier of Museums?" Image
   39(3-4):10-17. This is an exploration of the relation between the
   utility of an image of a thing and the thing itself; especially in the
   case when the thing itself is not a utilitarian object (i.e. art).
   Rather than purely theoretical however, the article also considers the
   practical, political and economic aspects of marketing and educating
   in the new networked environment (especially when one will be able to
   search vast databases of images, rather than the images of just one
   institution as is often now the case). Will the role (and thus need)
   for the singular institution be diminished? Many museums (and other
   repositories of visual material) approach the Internet cautiously;
   unsure whether the proliferation and dissemination of images of
   objects in their care will in effect replace all need to experience
   the original in an era that seems perfectly satisfied with simulacra,
   or whether they will take the significance of the original outside the
   constraining walls of the museum and ignite curiosity on a broader
   scale. The author is optimistic for museums and archives using the
   Internet but considers the issues broadly. - RR
   
   Tufte, Edward R. Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence
   and Narrative. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 1997, 151p. Tufte
   describes his last book, Envisioning Information, as a book about the
   visual depiction of nouns or static information, and this book is
   about the visual depiction of verbs or dynamic information. The timing
   couldn't better coincide with the evolution of the web toward more
   multimedia/dynamic information, and Tufte's books provide a
   non-technical guide to the intelligent and efficient display of all
   types of information, from scientific and business statistics to
   museum kiosks to weather analyzing videos, useful for print or
   multimedia and online publishing. - RR

   Hermans, Bjorn. "Intelligent Software Agents on the Internet" First
   Monday 2(3) (March 3, 1997)
   [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_3/ch_123/]. This title is
   actually comprised of seven chapters, which together make up almost
   the entire March issue of First Monday. It will tell you all you will
   ever want to know about the current state of intelligent agents
   development, including the pros and cons. He covers both the
   theoretical underpinnings of agents, and their practical use. To make
   further research on this topic easier, he also includes a bibliography
   -- posing for a moment as an intelligent agent of a more organic
   nature. - TH

   the world of Internet chat rooms and spins an interesting overview of
   the changes underway in Net culture. He also provides a few good
   reviews of communities (how about "Parent Soup", or "Agriculture
   Online") that you might otherwise miss. The news: close to fifty
   percent of Internet users are now women, and it's having an influence
   on etiquette and style; and what's more, it looks like people actually
   enjoy communing in chat rooms more than they like random surfing
   around the Web. - TH
   
   Lavagnino, Merri Beth. "Networking and the Role of the Academic
   Systems Librarian: an Evolutionary Perspective." College & Research
   Libraries 58(3) (May 1997): 217-231. The present article traces the
   evolution of the academic systems librarian's role from manager of
   function-specific automated library systems to coordinator of
   integrated online library systems and collaborator in campus-wide
   information infrastructure developments. Focusing on the dramatic
   increase in both technological and administrative requirements of
   these positions, the piece also provides an overview of the
   development of local automated library systems on mainframe or
   minicomputers with dumb terminal access methods into complex,
   networked, distributed client-server environments serving the campus,
   state or region. - CG Leiner, Barry M., Vinton G. Cerf, David D.

   Lawrence G. Roberts, and Stephen Wolff. "A Brief History of the
   Internet: Part I" OnTheInternet (May/June 1997): 16-25. A group of
   Internet architects has come together to pen as close to an official
   history of the Internet as we are likely to see. It can be fascinating
   to discover "what a long, strange trip it's been" and to find out how
   TCP/IP took the world by storm (is there anyone out there who
   remembers OSI?). This article is based on one that appeared in the
   March 1997 issue of the Communications of the ACM, and is part one of
   a two-part series. Unfortunately the references are in part two, so
   you may need to wait until next month (or refer to the CACMversion) to
   know who they're citing. - RT
   
   McCollum, Kelly. "Magazine Ranks Colleges on How "Wired" They Are; MIT

   25, 1997, p. A24. The Ivy League is poorly represented in the top
   twenty "most wired" campuses, according to a recent survey conducted
   by Yahoo! Internet Life magazine. The surveyors looked for examples of
   online homework assignments, required coursework in Internet
   resources, as well as non-academic characteristics, such as chat rooms
   and usenet groups. Liberal arts colleges and land grant universities
   are very well represented, along with Dartmouth and Princeton. - TH
