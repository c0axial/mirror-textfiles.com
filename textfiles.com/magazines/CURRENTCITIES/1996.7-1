Hitchcock, Steve, Leslie Carr and Wendy Hall. "A Survey 
of STM Online Journals 1990-95: The Calm Before the 
Storm" http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/survey/survey.html
(January 1996) -- This survey lists over 100 peer-reviewed 
online journals in the areas of science, technology and 
medicine. The paper is really two resources wrapped into
one. The first part is a narrative illuminating the scope 
and findings of the survey, the hurdles facing and 
distinctive characteristics of the current electronic 
journal and a glimpse into what is predicted to be a bright 
future for electronic journals in the area of science, 
technology and medicine. The second part is a list of 
dynamic tables that include links to all the journals 
included in the survey. -- DR


Samuelson, Pamela. "The Copyright Grab" WIRED 4(1) (January 1996):135-138,
188-191. -- In a critical look at the Clinton administration's white
paper, "Intellectual Property and National Information Infrastructure,"
[[available in text form at
gopher://ntiant1.ntia.doc.gov:70/00/papers/documents/files/ipnii.txt and
in Adobe Acrobat form at http://www.uspto.gov/web/ipnii/], Sanderson, a
visiting law professor at Cornell, warns that if the legislative proposal
is adopted, traditional 'fair use' rights historically authorized by the
Constitution, will be stripped away, replaced by a controlling set of laws
which give publishers full copyright over every digital transmission. The
paper advocates making it illegal to circumvent copyright management
information and holds online providers responsible for the infractions of
their users. By selectively interpreting existing law and hurrying this
proposal into law, Congress will deliver a policy which could destroy
online privacy and emerging electronic information industries. Sanderson
suggests holding off the legislation until new markets emerge and a
complete interpretation of current law. Included are addresses for the
reader to get involved in the white paper debate. -- CJC

AmRhein, Richard. "Internet Resources for Music" 
College & Research Libraries News 56(11) (December 1995)
: 760-763. -- This month, the C&RL News Internet 
resources column focuses on music. The author has chosen 
a representative sample of discussion lists, e-journals,

of the many gateway systems that serve as indexes to 
thousands of music sites on the Internet. -- MP

Infobahn: Magazine of Internet Culture [issn 1079-4069]
[http://www.postmodern.com/] -- While it's easy to gloss 
over the recent explosion in popular periodicals covering 
the Internet, Infobahn deserves some consideration. This 
magazine (December 1995 is the premiere issue) proposes
to avoid the "tech toy lists," best of Net lists, and 
celebrity cameos that seem the stock of most others. 
Infobahn, in its premiere issue offer an intelligent 
discussion of "The Geopolitics of Cyberspace," a study 
into how politicians are beginning to use the new medium, 
and more. In the spirit that Wired used to have, one can 
look here for some provocative yet accessible commentary 
on the effects of the digital age on modern culture. -- RR

Junion-Metz, Gail. _K-12 Resources on the Internet: An 
Instructional Guide_. Berkeley, California: Library 
Solutions Press, 1996. ISBN:1-882208-14-5. -- Library 
Solutions Press has published number 5 in its popular 
Internet Workshop Series, this one focusing on K-12 
resources. Like the other in the series, this workbook 
serves a dual purpose as both a self-paced guide for 
individual teachers and librarians who want to learn 
about the Internet and as a model training tool for 
those teaching the Internet to their students. What 
makes this volume particularly valuable is the chapter 
on "Making the Internet Happen" which discusses how to 
get your school connected to the Internet and the 
technological and educational issues associated with 
this process. (The PLUS version of this workbook, for 
people who train groups of K-12 professionals, comes 
with Windows and Macintosh diskettes of PowerPoint 
presentation slides that can either be customized to 
the instructor's own need or used as is.) -- MP
 
Koopman, Ann and Sharon Hay. "Large-scale Application of 
a Web Browser" College and Research Libraries News 57(1) 
(January 1996): 12-15. -- Librarians at Indiana University- 
Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) recount their 
experiences building a multiplatform, multimedia, 
integrated workstation using a World Wide Web browser as 
an interface. Providing access to muliple Internet sites, 
online catalogs, indexes/abstracts, video resources, 
personal storage space and communications, this new 
information system is the primary tool through which most 
students are delivered information. The authors describe 
the campus and library environment and the development 
process for establishing the library's information system. 
The long list of lessons learned which includes such sage 
advice as "design for long-term flexibility, assuming 
changes in technology will be the norm" or "graphics are 
not necessarily better than text" or "patron education was 
and continues to be paramount" should prove to be 
invaluable for any information professional participating 
in similar projects at their own institutions. -- MP

McClements, Nancy and Cheryl Becker. "Writing Web Page 
Standards" College & Research Libraries News 57(1) (January 
1996): 16-17. -- This is a short, practical article that 
describes how the library at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison established content, design and technical guidelines 
for the many units on its campus creating Web pages. With the 
primary goal of encouraging standardization, the guidelines 
[http://www.library.wisc.edu/help/tech/Web_standards.html] 
are designed to be used by staff members with varying levels 
of expertise. -- MP
 
Singleton, Andrew. "Wired on the Web" BYTE 21(1) (January 
1996):77-80. -- Although masquerading as yet another Java 
hype article, one soon remembers that this is BYTE. Here you 
get to see an actual applet, as well hear about some of the 
technical details lacking in many other articles on the 
subject. Includes informative diagrams. -- RT

Stuart, Lynn M. and Dena Holiman Hutto. "Internet Resources

care industry. All of the sources listed are World Wide Web 
sites. -- MP

"The Year of the Internet" Newsweek (December 25, 1995/
January 1, 1996) -- In this end of year special issue, 
Newsweek proves the impact the Internet has had on news 
organizations this year by devoting a sizeable chunk of 
editorial real estate to discussing it. Besides profiling 
their pick of the fifty people who "matter most" on the 
Internet (it's debatable whether they picked the right 
fifty, but certainly some earned their slot), they discuss 
Wall Street's love affair with Internet stocks, profile 
Netscape, and begin the whole thing with a piece entitled 
"This Changes Everything". Hang on to your hats, as the 
final sentence of the intro piece quotes John Barlow: "If 
this year seemed like a big one for the Net, wait till 
the next one. You ain't seen nothing yet." -- RT

Bennett, Hugh. "Hewlett-Packard 4020i SureStore CD-Writer:
CD-R for the Mainstream Buyer?" CD-ROM Professional 9(1) 
(January 1996):78-92. -- Many industry pundits deem H-P's
CD-Writer 4020i as the Holy Grail for the CD-R industry:
a product so attractive, so inexpensive (only $1049), and 
easy to use that it will be universally adopted as a 
necessary peripheral for the desktop computer. Bennett 
provides a lengthy and informative overview of this new
product, explaining how it "addresses and expands the needs 
and desires of individuals, small- and medium-sized
business PC users, and hobbyists for an appropriate method
for file distribution, inexpensive archiving, personal
audio compact disc creation, and multimedia storage..."
