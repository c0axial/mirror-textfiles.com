   Cheverie, Joan F. "Federal Information in the Networked Environment: A
   Perspective from the Coalition for Networked Information" Heisser,
   David C.R. "Federal Depository Program at the Crossroads: The Library
   Administrator's Perspective" Government Information Quarterly 16(3)
   (July 1999) - The focus of this pair of articles is nothing less than
   our system of accountability for the U.S. federal government, in
   theory and in practice. The first article raises issues regarding
   future networked access to federal documents, and the second examines
   the health of the primary conduit for them: the Depository Program,
   administered by the Government Printing Office. Cheverie ponders the
   very nature of this type of information, and poses questions about its
   availability, reliability and use, including aspects of the
   librarian's function. Heisser surveyed 24 depository libraries and
   interviewed directors and documents librarians; his findings focus on
   the stresses placed on the system by the push toward electronic
   formats. He concludes that, despite the pressure of constant
   adaptation to change, people who are instrumental in the depository
   program are dedicated to their mission, and will remain vigilant so
   that the principle of free public access will not become compromised
   by privatization, fragmentation or legislative neglect. - JR
   
   Chudnov, Daniel. "Open Source Software: The Future of Library
   Systems?" American Libraries 124(13) (August 1999): 40-43. - Open
   source software (software for which the source code is freely
   distributed) has proven to be a force to be reckoned with in the
   software industry. Apache (an open source web server application)
   serves up more web pages than any commercial application. Linux (an
   open source operating system) is thought by some to be capable of
   competing against Microsoft NT. Meanwhile, open source initiatives in
   the library world are few and usually of little impact. Chudnov is
   obviously out to change this, not only by penning this paean to open
   source, but also by providing some himself (gnujake, mentioned in the
   piece, is his). As someone involved in my own open source project
   (SWISH-E, a web site indexing application at
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/) I support Chudnov's plea to
   "grow the phenomenon." But I also realize that library programmers are
   hard to find, and managing an open source project is not trivial
   (anyone can chuck it out there for the taking, but managing the
   development and refinement of it once it's out there is another thing
   entirely). That being said, more power to him (and us). As he says,
   "if you've ever used the Internet, you've used open source software."
   Perhaps one day we'll be able to say the same about library catalogs
   or web sites. - RT
   
   Crawford, Walt. Being Analog: Creating Tomorrow's Libraries Chicago:
   American Library Association, 1999. - In this wide-ranging and
   no-holds-barred case against "digitopia", Crawford goes after those
   who predict an all-digital future for the nation's libraries. Who are
   these people? Well, no one I can think of in the profession of
   librarianship. So this book, it appears, is ammunition for those
   needing to persuade their board or administrators that the idea of
   getting rid of the physical library is...um...premature. But it's more
   than that as well. Crawford, who frankly sounds a bit ticked off in
   this book (phrases such as "web crazies" come to mind), is also
   speaking directly to his readership — librarians. He urges us to think
   critically about technology (hear! hear!) and implement it
   thoughtfully and for good reason. He admonishes us to use numeracy and
   critical thinking skills as shields against pundits, futurists, and
   doomsayers. He has much to tell us, and in typical style, he does so
   bluntly and readably. Hang on, since at the very least you're in for
   an interesting ride, and if you're paying attention you'll be thinking
   a lot as well. - RT
   
   Crawford, Walt. "Up to Speed on DVD" American Libraries 30(8)
   (September 1999): 71-74. - Crawford packs a ton of useful and
   understandable information about a new storage technology into this
   excellent summary piece. Besides covering all the technical issues, he
   provides advice to public and academic libraries about how they should
   regard this new technology (hot) and when they should jump into the
   game (soon if not now). In summary, he believes DVD to be the most
   promising technology since CDs, and one that can and should replace
   technically inferior VHS tapes. If you presently collect material on
   VHS or CD, you cannot afford to miss this article. - RT
   
   Eakins, John P. and Margaret E. Graham Content-based Image Retrieval:
   A report to the JISC Technology Applications Programme Newcastle, UK:
   Institute for Image Data Research, University of Northumbria at
   Newcastle, January 1999
   (http://www.unn.ac.uk/iidr/research/cbir/report.html). - Have you ever
   wanted to find images based on color, texture, shape, or other image
   characteristics? I haven't, but read on. This technology, called
   alternatively Query By Image Content (QBIC) or Content-Based Image
   Retrieval (CBIR), seeks to provide a method whereby images can be
   retrieved without first indexing or cataloging them. The idea is that
   a) indexing or cataloging images is a time-consuming (expensive)
   undertaking, and b) indexing has it's own problems, such as the
   difficulty of pre-selecting every aspect of an image by which someone
   may eventually wish to search. Having the ability to search for images
   that "look like" a reference image, for example, may be useful in
   particular instances, such as automatic fingerprint matching and face
   recognition. If this idea intrigues you, this report should be
   required reading. Eakins and Graham are relentlessly thorough in their
   coverage of current CBIR systems and the literature describing such.
   They conclude that CBIR is exciting but immature, and that it although
   it is unlikely to completely replace other methods of locating images,
   it nonetheless will be essential for some applications. - RT
   
   Kelly, Brian. "WebWatch: UK University Search Engines" Ariadne 21
   (September 1999) (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue21/webwatch/). -
   Making your web site searchable is both easy and very difficult. How
   so? you say. Well, it's "easy" if you take an existing commercial
   search engine such as InfoSeek or HotBot and limit their search to
   your site. What's wrong with that? Well, for starters, you have to put
   up with their ads on your search results. It gets worse from there.
   The more difficult route is to install search software on your server,
   configure it, and maintain it. Sometimes you even need to write code.
   All the choices are laid out in this overview article masquerading as
   a survey of UK academic web sites, and the search services they offer.
   What solution is the most popular? ht://Dig, at over 15% of the sites
   (but that doesn't necessarily make it the best for your site). Kelly
   won't get caught recommending any particular solution, rather he lays
   out important questions web managers should consider in making their
   selection. - RT
   
   Miller, Paul. "Z39.50 for All" Ariadne 21 (September 1999)
   (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue21/z3950/intro.html). - Miller has
   succeeded in what I have long thought to be impossible — he has
   explained Z39.50 briefly, simply, and understandably. The text is
   embellished with screen shots, diagrams, and even its own glossary —
   an essential element for any explanation of Z39.50. The URLs alone are
   worth a lot, as Miller has pulled together a lot of pointers to the
   essential web sites, technical information, and working systems.
   Anyone interested in Z39.50 should check this out. The rest of us can
   look (in vain) for the famous Ariadne caption contest; or, better yet,
   check out the latest Brian Kelly column (see elsewhere in this issue).

   Zorn, Peggy et al. "Finding Needles in the Haystack: Mining Meets the
   Web" Online (23)5 (Sept/Oct 1999):17-28. - In her introduction to this
   issue of Online, editor Nancy Garman states that since online access
   tools have become more readily available, there is a growing role for
   librarians who know how to organize information so that anyone can
   find it (as opposed to the traditional librarian's role as the
   intermediary who holds the secret for finding it). For everyone with
   such aspirations, data mining is an important concept. The ability to
   analyze data and identify patterns in large databases may seem more
   relevant to librarians when it's thought of as "text mining" which can
   be applied to text-rich but insufficiently tagged resources such as
   Web pages. Mining models fall into three basic categories
   (classification, clustering, and associations & sequencing) which are
   clearly explained as tools for handling unstructured networked
   information. The authors then describe and critique four applications
   (Dataware II Knowledge Management Suite, SemioMap, Relevance EIC, and
   Northern Light) which are said to be part of the next wave of
   interfaces for advanced Web data retrieval and analysis. - JR
