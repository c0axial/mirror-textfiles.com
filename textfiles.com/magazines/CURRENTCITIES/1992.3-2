Hyper- and Multimedia

Piette, Mary I. and Nathan M. Smith, Jr.  "Hypermedia and Library
Instruction: The Challenge of Design"  Reference Services Review
19(4) (Winter 1991):13-20.  A description of project FORE (Focus
on Research and Education) at Utah State University.  A
bibliographic instruction tool, Project FORE incorporates training
in basic library research techniques in a stylish HyperCard system. 
Paying close attention to what facilitates effective learning, the
designers created a varied and lively interactive system that
leads users through the course.  Drills, feedback from the system
on answers and increasingly sophisticated exercises enable users
to learn by doing, making their use of the system meaningful for
future library research. -- MT

Rosebush, Judson.  "Sounds In CD-ROM--Integrating Audio in 
Multimedia Products"  CD-ROM Professional 5(1) (January 1992):83-
87.  Surveying some new ideas and products in the union of 
Hypermedia and CD-ROM technology, the author's enthusiasm seems 
justified by the quality of the products discussed.  Musicologist Alan 
Lomax's Global Jukebox uses a HyperCard interface to access and 
control a collection of songs from hundreds of cultures.  A Farallon 
MacRecorder program called SoundEdit allows for cutting and pasting 
of sounds onscreen and includes effects for modifying input signals.  
Other Farallon, Voyager,and Chinon products are introduced as well, 
making this article a good review of the latest in multimedia audio 
technologies. -- MT

Rosenberg, Jason B. and Christine L. Borgman  "Report on the Loading 
of MARC Format Bibliographic Records to HyperCard"  Information 
Technology and Libraries 10(4) (December 1991):292-297 and Lee, 
Newton S. "Multimedia Visualizer: an Animated, Object-based OPAC"  
Information Technology and Libraries 10(4) (December 1991):297-
310.  A pair of related articles describing the creation of a 
bibliographic database in HyperCard through downloading from 
traditional OPACS and using a NeXT system catalog for library access.  
The first article contains technical information about the process of 
downloading, parsing and uploading to HyperCard of a portion of the 
catalogs of UCLA (ORION) and Los Angeles Public Library, creating a 
visual catalog for library users.  The second article on Multimedia 
Visualizer introduces a visually-based OPAC that can access books, 
audio recordings and animation (the last not yet implemented) and 
allow users to manipulate their chosen works.  Forward-looking in 
both its front end and its final presentation of materials, Multimedia 
Visualizer offers exciting potential for libraries to employ multimedia 
technologies for the benefit their users. -- MT


Networks and Networking

Bortman, Henry.  "On Beyond E-Mail" MacUser8(3)(March 1992):191-
197.  The e-mail of the future in '92?  Bortman describes Apple's 
plans for Open Collaboration Environment that will allow system 7 
users to e-mail from almost any application, that is mail an 
application document, and escape the ASCII prison. -- DR

Kovacs, Michael J. and Diane K. Kovacs.  "The State of Scholarly 
Electronic Conferencing" Electronic Networking 1(2)(Winter 
1991):29-36.  As we all know, electronic conferencing and electronic 
journals are increasingly important to our work, both for library-
oriented subjects as well as other subject areas.  The authors give a 
brief overview of e-conferencing, and give the results of their 
preliminary study of the state and effects of e-conferences and 
e-journals today. -- DR

Love, James P.  "Internet Access to Federal Information" posting on  
PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (February 4, 1992) and CNIDIR-L@UNMVM  
(February 10, 1992).  Love describes the work of the Taxpayer  
Assets Project which is supporting the Information Access Act.   This 
act would amend the Freedom of Information Act and would,  among 
other things, give "Federal agencies a mandate to provide online 
access to information resources through national computer  
networks." -- DR

Lynch, Clifford A.  "The Development of Electronic Publishing and 
Digital Library Collections on the NREN" Electronic Networking 
1(2)(Winter 1991):6-22.  Lynch describes the current state of 
electronic publishing and information resources on the network and 
where things may be heading, how the availability of primary 
materials in electronic format may lead scholars away from print 
sources, and how all of this may force a change in the way we view 
libraries.  Lynch also looks at electronic publishing from the 
perspectives of author, reader, library, and publisher. -- DR

Jaffe, David Lee and Steven G. Watkins "CD-ROM Hardware 
Configurations: Selection and Design" CD-ROM Professional 
5(1)(January 1992):62-68.  Jaffe and Watkins seek to assist 
librarians through the maze of CD-ROM hardware installation choices 
by providing an overview of the wide array of possible 
configurations: single drive workstations, daisychains, jukeboxes, 
peer-to-peer networks, networks based on file servers, and networks 
with remote access capabilities.  Especially useful are the diagrams 
accompanying each configuration description.  Beyond that, they 
delve into selection and design considerations of the system itself.--

Kittle, Paul W. "Networking the Light Fantastic: CD-ROMs on LANs" 
CD-ROM Professional 5(1)(January 1992):30-37.  Kittle provides a 
detailed explanation of the configuration of a Novell-based CD-ROM 
local area network (LAN) which provides remote, dial-up access from 
both PCs and MACs.  He manages to demystify a highly complex 
process which has resulted in a system that is becoming a model for 
the future.  Includes a product list and directory. -- TR

McCabe, Georgia L. "The Photo-CD Strategy: A Revolution in 
Imaging?" CD-ROM Professional 5(1)(January 1992):18-24.  Kodak's 
marketing director provides a behind the scenes look at how the 
Photo-CD will be marketed and positioned. Kodak's Photo-CD system 
is touted as the first truly new photographic medium since the 
invention of roll film over 100 years ago. The system essentially 
allows photographs to be stored on a compact disc (up to 100/disc). 
These photographs can then be played back on a TV using a special 
Photo-CD player or on a PC equipped with a CD-ROM XA drive. One of 
the major challenges facing Kodak is convincing the computer 
industry that it is the right company to provide leadership in the 
emerging field of digital imaging on the desktop. -- TR

Tenopir, Carol "Changes Wrought by CD-ROM" Library Journal 
116(21) (December 1991):108-110.  Tenopir examines the profound 
impact of CD-ROM on collections, patrons, and reference staff of all 
types of libraries in this article based upon a speech she gave at the 
Department of Library and Information Studies, Northern Illinois 
University, DeKalb. --TR

Mc Millan, Gail, et al.  "The Balance Point: Electronic Journals: 
Considerations for the Present and the Future" Serials Review,
vol. 17, no. 4 (1991), pp.77-86.  The Library at Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute and State University was one of the first to take seriously 
this new medium of serials publishing.  This article details some of 
the important considerations and factors that their Taskforce on 
Electronic Journals took into account in deciding the reasons and 
methods for making e-journals available to their public.  Such 
considerations were made from the points of view of reference, 
collection development, technical services and systems design & 
implementation. -- LR
