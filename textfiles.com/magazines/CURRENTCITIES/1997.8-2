   Arms, William Y., Christophe Blanchi, and Edward A. Overly. "An
   Architecture for Information in Digital Libraries" D-Lib Magazine
   (February 1997) (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february97/cnri/02arms1.html)
   -- Although it may not seem like it at first, it is well worth trying 
   to understand such terms as "key metadata," "structural metadata," 
   "digital object," and "meta-object" that pepper this article. Arms and 
   company describes a digital library architecture that is based on 
   previous projects (at least one of which still exists as a production 
   service) and work with the U.S. Library of Congress National Digital 
   Library Program, which is digitizing content at a rapid pace. The 
   architecture outlined here is an intriguing one, and it will be 
   interesting to see the prototype system promised for early 1997. But 
   while the article is long on detail in some areas (such as the use of 
   "handles" to handle persistent naming), it is quite short on other 
   details, like what metadata scheme they propose to use and in what 
   container they will store it. But nonetheless, anyone building or 
   thinking of building digital collections must be familiar with the 
   work described in this paper. -- RT
   
   Ester, Michael. Digital Image Collections: Issues and Practice The
   Commission on Preservation & Access, December 1996. -- In this brief
   (36 pages) report, Ester distills a great deal of information and
   discussion of issues relating to creating, organizing, and managing
   digital image collections. Anyone faced with such a project would do
   well to spend $15 and learn a lot about what is involved, as well as
   being forewarned about a general lack of standards and rules of thumb
   related to digital imaging. Major sections include discussions of the
   original object and its reproduction, assessing image quality, color
   matching, integrating image and text information, building
   collections, reproduction rights, and user access. One disappointment
   is the lack of any substantive discussion of the metadata issue --
   what information is kept about each image and how. Despite this minor
   point Ester has put together a quite useful document for those of us
   still laboring under the misconception that one needs only slap a
   photo on a scanner to start building a digital image collection. -- RT

   D-Lib Magazine (February 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february97/ariadne/02kirriemuir.html) --
   This article, and a related one by John McColl, describes the
   experiences of the editors of a magazine that is published in both
   print and Web versions. The freely available Web version has all the
   content of the print version, along with additional content not
   available in print. This article provides some history regarding the
   creation of this dual publishing model. Of particular note in this
   piece is the interesting and frank discussion about how to make it
   pay, from someone faced with making the transition from a grant-funded
   project to the cold fiscal realities of the real world. -- RT
   
   MacColl, John. "The Professional Magazine and Parallel Publishing"
   D-Lib Magazine (February 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february97/02maccoll.html) -- In this
   companion piece to John Kirriemuir's article in the same issue of
   D-Lib Magazine, MacColl waxes more philosophic than his compatriot in
   looking at the issues behind the parallel publication of a journal in
   both print and Web versions. He contends that parallel publishing, at
   least for the type of professional literature of which Ariadne is a
   part, is likely to be a useful publication model for some time into
   the future. -- RT

   theoretical, but it should prove very useful to all those who made an
   investment in putting their digital video content into the QuickTime
   format, and now want to make that content available on the web without
   the expense of a server-side option for web-video. -- RR

   Suddenly everyone is reporting on rapidly emerging "push"
   technologies, and Businessweek is no exception. The "push"
   technologies are, simply put, new services that learn what you want to
   receive via the Web and bring it to your desktop. Instead of
   struggling with links, URLs, and "no DNS entry" messages, push
   technologies do the searching for you. Corporate firms use push
   technologies (also known as "webcasting") to bring news and
   information to employee desktops. Both Microsoft and Netscape are
   working on products that would provide "channels" on a personal
   computer that would allow custom configurations and "productivity"
   services (such as spreadsheets or word processors) on demand. Push
   technology is estimated to grab up to one third of Internet
   advertising revenue by the year 2000. This article provides a handy
   overview of the key players (ranging from Berkeley Systems to
   Microsoft), as well as likely development trends. -- TH

   E-mail: Debate at H-NET Reflects Ideas of Two Men Who Run the Popular
   Project" Chronicle of Higher Education 43(20) (January 24, 1997):
   A23-A24. -- H-NET, which won the American Historical Association's
   award for contributions to the teaching of history, is a lively
   community of over 51,000 humanities scholars. This article charts its
   growth and future goals, which will increasingly involve Web
   applications. Until now, the network has largely been a series of
   email discussion lists. This is a relatively low-tech use of networked
   communications, but clearly of interest and value to the participants
   as a scholarly aid. The founders will retain a commitment to material
   that can be accessible with slower machines and access times, in
   recognition of the full range of technology available. -- TH

   This profile of working life at Netscape will be of interest to
   librarians who are watching the development of Internet culture for
   two reasons. First, it showcases the mindset and values (such as
   speed, speed, speed in development cycles) that have helped Netscape
   keep an edge on Microsoft. Second, it reveals how Netscape developers
   and marketers have combined an understanding of desktop ease-of-use
   with new ways handling "content." Fans of Tracy Kidder's The Soul of a
   New Machine will enjoy a peek at this one. -- TH
   
   Johnston, Leslie and Katherine Jones-Garmil. "So You Want to Build a
   Web Site" Museum News (Jan/Feb 1997):41-44 -- After you thought you'd
   seen all you needed of introductory articles on how to make web
   sites... this one is worth looking at. The authors cite URLs to back
   up each section, but more importantly they give a good overview of
   issues to consider when planning a website, including server options,
   access issues, etc. This is an up-to-date, concise, and
   well-considered introduction to being an information provider on the
   web. -- RR
   
   Wilson, David L. "Internet Managers are Poised to Change the System of
   On-line Address" Chronicle of Higher Education 43(22) (February 7,
   1997):A25-A26. -- Corporate vanity is not the only reason that the
   Internet International Ad Hoc Committee is recommending the addition
   of new "top level domain names" for Internet addresses, but you can
   bet it has played a big role. "Internet domain names" (that's the part
   on the right side of the final period, such as ".edu" and ".com") are
   being assigned quickly and more capacity is needed; also, new
   top-level names will give firms another chance to grab a vanity
   address that's similar to their overall corporate identity. The final
   recommendations aren't done yet, but look for new domain names like
   "paramount.ent" that offer better top-level classification. The
   committee will recommend at least seven new choices, but the final
   recommendation may grow to 20. -- TH
   
   Wilson, David. L. "With 98 Colleges Taking Part, Internet II May Start
   within Six Months" Chronicle of Higher Education 43(22) (February 7,
   1997):A25-A26. -- This article gives an interesting overview of the
   new, high-speed alternative to the current Internet, "Internet II."
   The new network will focus on the needs of research universities. This
   initiative, which originally sought a mere dozen participants, now has
   nearly 100 campus partners. A key element of the infrastructure of the
   new network will be known as "gigabit points of presence," or
   "gigapops." There may be as many as 50 gigapop locations (one per
   state) that will enable local traffic to move at speeds many times
   faster than is currently possible. Computer scientists forecast that
   the new system may be on-line in six months. -- TH

   Anderson, Kurt. "The Age of Unreason" The New Yorker 72(45) (February
   3, 1997):40-43. -- Anderson explores the impact of the "culture"
   business, and dueling statistics in particular. He finds a growing
   reluctance on the part of intellectuals to accept the existence of
   indisputable facts; instead, facts are constantly disputed by parallel
   survey research, number crunching and counter-claims that are made
   against all viewpoints. He cites the Internet as a case study, because
   quasi-factual web sites that look reliable may in fact be riddled with
   half-baked reasoning. How do those in pursuit of critical thinking
   navigate through all the half truths? A growing dilemma. Anderson also
   analyzes the well-publicized claims about TWA Flight 800 that
   journalist Pierre Salinger obtained from the Internet. Although
   Anderson doesn't focus solely on Net culture, this article is
   interesting for those who watch the digital Zeitgeist. -- TH
   
   Druckery, Timothy, ed. Electronic Culture: Technology and Visual
   Representation New York: Aperture Publishers, 1996. -- Comprehensive
   and in-depth, this book contains essays by over 30 artists,
   information scientists, designers and academics on the cultural impact
   of extended visualization via computer imaging and networks in the
   fields of art, the sciences and history. The first articles start with
   an historical look at representation, then move through photographic
   and para-photographic imaging technology. The authors then consider
   theory and end by addressing media, identity and culture. It's a lot
   of slippery material to cover, but it's done well, and helpful to step
   back from the daily work and consider what we're doing. -- RR

   Chepesiuk, Ron. "The Future is Here: America's Libraries Go Digital"
   American Libraries 27(1) (January 1997):47-49. -- In this brief
   overview article Chepesiuk identifies many of the higher-profile
   digital library projects that are trying to reinvent the future of
   libraries. He also describes some of the toughest issues such projects
   are trying to resolve, including preservation, copyright, and
   interoperability. Chepesiuk also acknowledges, as does probably
   everyone involved with such projects, that print materials and library
   collections of them will not be replaced by digital libraries.
   Included are addresses (URLs) for some important digital library
   projects and resources. -- RT
   
   Verity, John M. "Coaxing Meaning Out of Raw Data: How Software Can Now
   Find Patterns Never Seen Before" Businessweek (3512) (February 3,
   1997):134-38 (http://www.businessweek.com/1997/05/b3512127.htm). --
   This is a really interesting article that describes exactly what "data
   mining" and "data warehousing" are all about. Data mining refers to a
   class of software analysis tools that can parse very, very large
   datasets and find "meaningful" patterns. For example, we're talking
   combinations like US Census data, 10 years of product sales history in
   50 states, every telephone call from millions of numbers, plus any
   number of other factors. Data warehousing systems analyze datasets in
   the trillions of bytes on ultra-fast servers, and can help managers
   pinpoint trends and inventory levels almost instantly. This approach
   is especially helpful at catching fraud like cell-phone theft, or
   strategic planning like customer-retention. But it also has big
   implications for qualitative information management of the sort that
   happens in libraries. Keep an eye on this trend in programming! -- TH
