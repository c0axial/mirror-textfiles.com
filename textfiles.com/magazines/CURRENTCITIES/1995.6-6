Besser, Howard. [http://http2.sils.umich.edu/~howardb/]
"Getting the Picture on Image Databases: The Basics" 
Database 18(2)(April/May 1995):12-19. -- This article is 
an indispensable resource and introduction for anyone 
involved in imaging and/or creating an image database. It is 
written so that it is accessible to the novice, but raises 
enough salient issues to be of interest to even the most 
advanced imaging project manager. The article starts with 
the promise of outlining some of the major considerations in 
developing an image database, which it does in great depth. 
It ends by concluding that image databases can be valuable 
assets for general access and scholarship, but that in order 
to ensure longevity of the information, the entire database 
from image to attached descriptive text, needs to be carefully 
planned according to use and adhere to the appropriate 
standards. The article is excerpted from a forthcoming publication 
from the Getty Art History Information Program, 
[http://www.ahip.getty.edu/ahip], as part of a series of 
educational publications on imaging and cultural heritage 
organizations. Of great use as well, are the numerous cites to 
related articles and projects, with contact info. -- RR

Falcigno, Kathleen and Tim Green. "Home Page, Sweet Home Page"
Database 18(2) (April/May 1995):20-28. -- A good introduction,
particularly for librarians, about what is required to create 
your own Web presence. Although they have fallen into the trap 
of mis- and over-using the term "home page," as have many 
others, the article contains a lot of good, practical advice. 
An example is "Learning HTML and creating a series of Web 
documents is not difficult, but maintaining these documents 
will involve a considerable ongoing time commitment." Such gems 
far outweigh such problems as an apparent publication timeframe 
that pre-dates Netscape and makes URL's go out of date. -- RT

Lamb, Linda and Jerry Peek _Using Email Effectively_. Sebastopol, 
CA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1995. -- This slim volume is chock-
full of down-to-earth advice that virtually all email users will 
find helpful. It is one of a new series of volumes from O'Reilly 
called "What You Need to Know" and is designed to reduce a 
subject to the essential information about a topic. If this 
volume is any indication, the series may gain as much respect 
with everyday computer users as O'Reilly's Nutshell Handbook 
series has gained with the wireheads for whom that series is aimed. 
Basic information, practical tips, advice, and netiquette are all 
presented in a format that is inviting and easy to browse. The 
layout includes personal vignettes in the ample whitespace of the 
outside margins, where real people (at least some of whom are 
O'Reilly staff) share email tips, personal habits, and horror 
stories. Highly recommended. -- RT

Lewis, Peter H. "Best Web Browsers" PC World 13(6) (June 1995)
:122-141. -- The proliferation of World Wide Web client access 
programs, or browsers, is keeping heads spinning and electronic 
discussion traffic high. Combined with the dizzying speed with 
which alliances are forming between browser developers and 
Internet Access Providers (which now include the former 
"gateway" services of America Online, CompuServe, et al.) the 
sources and qualities of different browsers are impossible to 
keep straight. In this article, Lewis evaluates the ten most 
popular browsers, compares them feature by feature, and makes 
recommendations. NaviSoft's InternetWorks is rated highest as 
an all-in-one Internet package plus browser, Netscape is the 
choice for stand-alone commercial browsers, and winWeb for 
stand-alone shareware. It certainly is difficult to create a 
fixed point from which to assess and understand all of the 
access and client options for the Internet (and some of the 
companion articles in this issue of PC World were out of date 
upon publication, including Judy Heim's "Best Online Services"), 
but Lewis creates such a point as well as the framework by which 
comparisons can continue to be made. -- JLO

Mui, Linda. _When You Can't Find Your UNIX System Administrator_ 
O'Reilly and Associates, 1995. -- Finally. A small, well-
organized paperback that provides hints and gives context for 
the mid-range UNIX user. UNIX has been described as "engineer 
friendly, user hostile" and its power is often lost or misused 
by casual and mid-range users. The book declares, from the outset, 
that it is for "users who are not particularly interested in 
computers, but who just need to get their work done." It assumes 
that the reader knows basic UNIX commands for editing files and 
moving through directories. With chapters such as "What you need 
to know about sharing files" and "What you need to know about 
running programs" it uncovers, in browsable fashion, the true 
usefulness and necessity of file permissions, full pathnames, 
program resources, etc. While not particularly useful as a 
reference tool for individual commands or tasks, the book does 
fill in the conceptual gap for users who believe that something 
OUGHT to be possible (because, for example, it is possible on their 
pc or mac) and how UNIX actually makes it possible (or not). This 
kind of understanding is particularly useful for those Internet 
resource providers who find themselves in a new zone halfway 
between pure content management and system administration. -- JLO

"Proceedings of the Third International World-Wide Web Conference, 
10-14 April, 1995, Darmstadt, Germany" Computer Networks and 
ISDN Systems 27(6) [available to journal subscribers, conference 
attendees, and those who order a print copy at 
http://www.elsevier.nl/www3/] -- The proceedings of this conference 
have been published simultaneously on the World Wide Web and in 
print to a limited audience: the attendees of the conference, 
subscribers to the journal, and purchasers of this issue. Persons 
in those categories have access to a password that enables them to 
visit the online archive. The online archive has a number of 
interesting research articles on the World Wide Web, and each article 
includes numerous links to online information and a "printable" 
version of the file in Adobe Acrobat format. -- RT

Schnell, Eric. "Writing for the Web: A Primer for Librarians"
<http://bones.med.ohio-state.edu/eric/papers/primer/webdocs.htm>
-- Although this online article/tutorial is still in draft form, 
it could prove useful for those asked to teach librarians (or 
anyone really) how to write for the WWW. It is not an HTML tutorial, 
as that topic is well-covered by other resources. Rather this 
article leads a writer through some of the issues involved in 
writing for this new medium, such as the need to keep individual 
pages short and focused, and using links instead of additional 
paragraphs for new topics. So far it is a bit short on information 
about embedding multimedia objects in writing for the WWW, but in 
considering design along with technical issues, and written for a 
Web beginner, this tutorial can provide a useful tool for 
instruction. -- RR
 
Singleton, Andrew. "Cash on the Wirehead" Byte 20(6) (June 1995)
:71-78. -- You've seen it as part of every science fiction movie 
made in the last decade or so - some computer verification of debit 
or credit replacing every trace of cash or coin. Singleton's article 
serves as a readable primer on digital cash and digital credit. Along 
the way he points out that most of the pieces and players are already 
in place while the remaining security, privacy, and network components 
are being readied. Six current systems, essentially sold as services 
to businesses wanting to support transactions on the Internet and 
other electronic venues, are compared and contrasted. The author's 
analysis includes predictions of slow acceptance and profitability 
while any rewards to be had will very likely go to the major credit 
card companies and their collaborations with hightech, such as the 
joint ventures between MasterCard/Netscape and Visa/Microsoft. -- JLO
 

Optical Disc Technology

Benford, Tom. "The Quad Speed Six: Fast CD-ROMs in the Fast Lane"
CD-ROM Professional 8(5) (May 1995):20-38. -- When Pioneer 
released the first quad-speed CD-ROM drive in 1992, its 800KB/sec 
rotation rate was considered a huge waste of energy. Benford 
explains how things have changed in the intervening years. 
Quad-speed drives are fast becoming a necessity with multimedia 
applications which involve full-motion video, 3D modeling and 
rendering, and complex animation, especially at 24-bit color 
depth. Quad speed drives make it possible to render huge graphic 
information databases in real time - a necessity for believable 
virtual reality multimedia. Quad speed drives also enable faster 
software loading, as more publishers are providing their software 
on CD-ROM. "Whatever prophecies of doom the debut of quad speed 
drives inspired," concludes Benford, "this kind of drive is here 
to stay because the technology represents advances that are making 
things better, faster, and less expensive." The meat of the article 
is a comprehensive review of the six quad speed drives currently 
on the market. -- TR 

Mortensen, Kirsten. "Technology Meets Culture at the Dawn of the 
Digital Museum" CD-ROM Professional 8(5) (May 1995):106-111. 
-- This article gives an overview of why museums (and by 
extension, other cultural heritage institutions) are employing 
digital technology. Among the reasons are improved collection 
management and care (through reducing the need to handle delicate 
objects), income generation (in actuality, the furthest goal as 
yet), and foremost - increased public access to collections 
information. Applications of CD-ROM technology are highlighted, 
of course, and of value is the sampling of projects cited. Of 
particular interest is the briefly touched-upon notion that soon 
an online visitor could search across collections regardless of 
the actual physical location of them in separate museums, by 
theme for instance, or artist, instead of by museum/location. 
Museums even more than libraries have been tied to local access 
to mostly unique objects, so remote and shared access implies an 
even greater change for these institutions. -- RR

Samuels, Geoffrey, ed. "Sample CD-ROM Licensing Agreements for 
Museums" New York: MUSE Educational Media, 1995. -- This booklet 
is published by the MUSE group in cooperation with the American 
Association of Museums and several law consultants. It contains 
two sample agreements between a museum and CD-ROM developer, to 
serve as a template for museums, and surely libraries and archives 
as well, in writing agreements for developing and publishing 
CD-ROM titles. It contains samples of the legal language, a 
glossary, and notes explaining in lay terms the reasoning behind 
each section. The field of intellectual property is just as 
challenging as the technical issues in creating quality 
educational media titles, and this booklet is a major step toward 
helping education and research institutions in this area. MUSE 
can be reached at: MUSE Educational Media, 1 East 53rd St., 
10th Fl., New York City, 10022-4201. -- RR
