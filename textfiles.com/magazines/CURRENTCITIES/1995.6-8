Electronic Publishing

Cantenazzi, Nadia and Forbes Gibb. "The Publishing Process: 
The Hyper-Book Approach" Journal of Information Science 
21(3) (1995):161-172. -- The authors outline the steps 
involved in both paper and electronic publishing. For 
electronic publishing, data can be in any number of formats. 
Portable, system-independent alternatives to proprietary 
encoding schemes include plain ASCII text, which lacks 
layout conventions and general markup language, specifically 
SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which preserves 
logical structural information. Because it is standardized, 
SGML can facilitate automatic processing. The hyper-book 
system is a set of tools that automate the creation of 
electronic books from SGML-encoded files, and provide a 
familiar, book-like user interface. The system provides the 
user with navigation and orientation tools as well as 
bookmark and annotation capability and provides access to 
external tools such as word processors and printers. -- CJC

Protsik, Ralph. "How Book Publishers are Staffing for 
Multimedia" CD-ROM Professional 8(7) (July 1995):20-30. 
-- Protsik addresses staffing issues facing a publisher 
moving toward multimedia publishing. He suggests a shift in 
thinking is necessary for traditional book publishers 
because of the fast-paced, technical environment of 
electronic publishing which is similar to that of software 
development. The costs of technology are high and new 
marketing approaches need to be employed. A good strategy 
is to develop multimedia skills in interested editors and 
production staff already in place who have valuable 
experience in the book industry, as well as to hire in 
outside talent for technical development and marketing. 
Interesting sidebars give hiring examples (and salaries) 
from several large publishing houses. -- CJC
   

Multimedia and Hypermedia

Hudson, Barry & Drake White. "The Art & Science of Business 
Multimedia Development: A Matter of Principles" CD-ROM 
Professional 8(7) (July 1995):44-54 -- The author 
investigates the problem of building an effective team for 
multimedia CD-ROM development. As users develop higher 
standards for CD-ROM titles, developers cannot rely on 
the technology to sell itself. They must bring together the 
business, design, content, and technical units into a 
tightly focused team to create a CD-ROM title that whose 
design supports access to its content, which supports its 
business purpose, and so on. Useful are sidebars which 
contrast different approaches for interface design, business 
strategy, and content management. -- RR

Mantelman, Lee. "Digital Video: Coming (..Soon?) to an 
Application Near You" Imaging Magazine 4(8) (August 1995)
:50-90. -- Actually a suite of articles by the same author, 
this detailed explanation of digital video covers software 
vs. hardware approaches, software standards for compression 
(mpeg, mjpeg, etc.), server solutions, OS considerations, 
and is rich with contact information. The article makes a 
good technical primer and resource for anyone involved in 
creating, storing, or delivering digital video for any 
purpose. -- RR


Networks and Networking

Bearman, David. "Museum Strategies for Success on the 
Internet" Spectra 22(4) (Summer 1995):18-24.  -- The 
author offers a broad discussion of issues facing any 
cultural heritage institution considering, or even in 
the depths of, creating Internet access to information. 
The article covers intellectual and data structural 
implication, and economic implications, with several 
sub-sections of each. Strategies are suggested to create 
successful and viable access, such as focusing on the 
institution's unique role and fit into the larger 
information community. The article questions some 
common assumptions, and will provide fresh insights for 
even those well-read in this area. -- RR

Bruce, Thomas R. "Choreography for a Dancing Bear: The Web, 
Markets, and Strategies," OnTheInternet 1(3) (July/August 
1995): 16-25. -- An entertaining and wide-ranging review of 
the Web and possible implications for publishing and using 
information via this technology. The strengths of this article 
come more from making you think about the issues rather than 
in presenting conclusions.  -- RT

Clement, Gail P. _Science and Technology Resources on the 
Internet: An Instructional Guide_. Berkeley, California: 
Library Solutions Press, 1995. ISBN: 1-882208-13-7. -- Like 
the other books in this series, this volume on Internet 
resources in science and technology serves a dual purpose 
as both a self-paced guide for individuals who want to learn 
about the Internet and as a model training tool for 
instructors. The book includes sample searches and several 
pages that can be made into overhead transparencies.  (The 
PLUS version of this workbook comes with Windows and 
Macintosh diskettes of the PowerPoint presentation slides 
that can either be customized to the instructor's own needs 
or used as is.) The section on how to find Internet resources 
is particularly useful because it takes Internet training 
beyond just a series of commands by providing the tools that 
allow students of the Internet to find and discover resources 
on their own. Clement also includes important guidelines 
for evaluating the quality and value of Internet resources 
which, in the all-inclusive universe of the Internet, is an 
important way for users to learn how to weed out the junk from 
the gems. Although this workbook focuses on science and 
technology issues, its straightforward description of the 
Internet make this an excellent resource for instructors or 
students of any discipline interested in understanding the 
Internet. -- MP

Dennis, Anita. "Hot Links" Publish (September 1995):79-84. 
-- Some of the best graphics on the Web from a magazine that 
should know. Look at them and weep (or run out and employ a 
graphic artist). URLs are provided to site that can foster 
ideas on how to jazz up your Web server. -- RT

Hupp, Stephen L. "Internet Resources for Conservatism" College 
& Research Libraries News 56(7) (July/August 1995):464-466. 
-- The Internet, it seems, plays host to the entire political 
spectrum and this month's C&RL News includes an article that 
highlights many of the major Internet resources for 
conservatism. The list includes selected references to 
discussion lists, Usenet groups, electronic periodicals, 
gopher sites and World Wide Web resources in all areas of 
American conservatism and the Republican Party. So, for all 
those who need the URL for the "Newt Gingrich WWW Fan Club" 
or the "NRA Home Page" or who want to find out how to 
subscribe to the Rush Limbaugh discussion list, this article 
tells them. -- MP

Peete, Gary R. _Business Resources on the Internet: A Hands-On 
Workshop_. Berkeley, California: Library Solutions Press, 1995. 
ISBN: 1-882208-11-0. -- Another in the popular Internet Workshop 
Series, the third in the series focuses on business resources. 
Serving a dual purpose as both a self-paced guide for individuals 
who want to learn about the Internet and as a model training tool 
for instructors, this volume takes a module-based approach to 
introducing the Internet while focusing on business-related 
sources. The book includes sample searches and several pages that 
can be made into overhead transparencies. (The PLUS version of 
this workbook comes with Windows and Macintosh diskettes of the 
PowerPoint presentation slides that can either be customized to 
the instructor's own needs or used as is.) Peete offers practical 
advice for teachers (including advice about what to do when the 
technology fails) and a checklist of considerations that 
instructors should keep in mind when preparing an Internet class. 
Of particular value is the "Best Bets for Exploration" guide which 
lists the names and locations of several primary Internet locations 
for exploring business-related information and sites. Offering both 
practical information (such as Internet addresses and sample 
searches) and an introduction to fundamental concepts and strategies 
this workbook should prove to be an indispensable guide to anyone 
preparing to teach about business sources on the Internet. -- MP

"Star-Spangled Net" Internet World 6(8) (August 1995): 28+. 
-- The main topic of this issue is politics on the Web, from 
the Congressional Web site Thomas (http://thomas.loc.gov/) to 
political activists in the former Soviet Union. One of the most 
interesting pieces is an interview with Don Jones, Newt 
Gingrich's right hand Internet man and the creator of the Thomas 
server. -- RT

Wiggins, Richard. "Spinning Out Documents: Web Servers" New Media 
5(8) (August 1995):43-46  -- If you are faced with researching a
Web server solution for your institution, read this article. It 
does not provide as much depth as some, but is worth it only if 
for the chart showing costs, features, and contact info for 20 
Web server software packages and the other showing similar info 
for six integrated hardware/software solutions from Sun, Apple, 
etc. A brief discussion of platform choice also makes this 
article a helpful starting place. -- RR

Wilson, David L. "The Network Has Eyes" Chronicle of Higher 
Education 41(45) (July 21, 1995), A17-18. -- Computer system 
administrators have traditionally kept logs of online activities 
in order to see how people access their records and to monitor 
online activities and behavior in general. Internet users, 
however, are becoming increasingly concerned that this practice 
may be violating their privacy and some Internet scholars have 
called on new ethics guidelines so that researchers and systems 
administrators can go online without infringing on the rights 
of individual Internet users. Until scholars develop systems 
that allow administrators to monitor online activities while at 
the same time protecting individual privacy, Internet users 
need to know that their online activities are being recorded.

Optical Disc Technology


Lieberman, Paula. "Taking Measure of Magnetic, Optical, and
Magneto-Optical Media and Drives" CD-ROM Professional 8(7) 
(July 1995):62-74. -- Lieberman presents a very complete 
overview of a wide range of optical storage options, including 
WORM (Write Once Read Many), Erasable, Rewritable, Recordable, 
Magneto-Optical, and lesser known technologies such as Floptical, 
OROM, P-ROM, LaserCard, and Digital Paper. While all of these 
technologies lack the installed base and commercial acceptance 
of CD-ROM, many offer distinct advantages, including faster
random access reading, rewritability, and cheaper manufacturing
materials. Substantial sidebars include a the Optical Storage 
Technology Association (OSTA) roster and an Optical/Magneto-
Optical Glossary. -- TR

Pahwa, Ash. "Enhanced CD & The Joliet File System" CD-ROM
Professional 8(7) (July 1995):106-107. -- Pahwa discusses two
new standards recently proposed by Microsoft, both of which
will be supported by Windows 95. Enhanced CD is described as 
a multisession disc designed primarily to court audio CD fans 
as potential buyers of CD-ROM hardware; it reverses the 
conventional multisession configuration by placing the audio 
tracks in the first session and data in the second session. 
The beauty of the Enhanced CD format for CD-ROM users is that 
it provides multisession versatility at no additional cost.
The Joliet File System is an extension to the ISO 9660 file
structure (standard format for CD-ROM). Joliet extensions 
transcend the inherent limitations and ambiguities of the ISO 
9660 specifications, which allows for efficient, multiplatform 
information distribution. Pahwa predicts both of proposals
will become de facto industry standards. -- TR
