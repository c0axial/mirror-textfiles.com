Optical Disc Technology 
 
Dreiss, Jack L. "CD-ROM: Potential and Pitfalls." CD-ROM  
Professional 3(5) (September 1990):70-73.  This article is a  
summary from the Arthur Andersen White Paper entitled, "CD-ROM:  
Confronting the Potential Dilemma."  The article outlines past  
pitfalls of the new technology (lack of standards, fear of  
obsolescence, expense) and factors that will fuel growth in the  
future.  The authors assert that CD-ROM is much more than a passing  
fancy and predict that it will be the hot information technology of  
the early 1990s, and its effect will be nothing less than  
revolutionary. 
 
Rosen, Linda. "CD-ROM Report: A Guide to the emerging optical  
technologies." Database 13(5) (October 1990):116-119.  The author  
sets out to "demystify new electronic and optical technologies and  
to provide information on the current and future availability of  
actual products."  The technologies covered include CD-ROM, CD-I,  
CD-IV, CD-ROM XA, DVI, and WORM.  The author concludes with the  
prediction that CD-ROM will continue to be the most widely used of  
the optical technologies in the information industry, while the  
newer technologies will go straight to the consumer. 
 
Stewart, Linda, ed.  Public Access CD-ROMs in Libraries: Case  
Studies. Westport, CT: Meckler Corporation, 1990. This recently  
published work presents case studies of libraries which have  
installed CD-ROM workstations in public access areas.  Its primary  
aim is to aid in the planning and decision-making regarding the  
purchase and management of CD-ROM.  The case studies are grouped  
into two parts: the first part presents case studies grouped into two  
sections by type of library while the second part concentrates on  
particular aspects of implementation (e.g. networking, remote  
access). 
 
Tenopir, Carol.  "CD-ROM Manifesto."  Library Journal 115(14):195- 
97. In her monthly column, Tenopir provides the text of the CD-ROM  
Manifesto presented at the National Online Meeting in New York this  
May by the Corporate Librarians Group of New York.  The document  
calls for progress in the design, production, marketing, and support  
of CD-ROM products, especially in relation to standards, interfaces,  
and networking. 
 
 
Expert Systems 
 
Bailey, Charles W. Jr. and Kathleen Gunning. "The Intelligent  
Reference Information System." CD-ROM Librarian 5(8) (September  
1990):10-19. One of the limitations of expert systems has been the  
inability to link them either with other expert systems or with  
other computer products.  This limitation is clearly being overcome  
with the IRIS Project which takes the power of expert systems in  
combination with CD-ROM technology to develop improved reference  
services. Interesting reading especially now that our libraries offer  
multiple CD-ROM database services.
 
Davis, Randall, ed. "Expert Systems: How Far Can They Go?"  AI  
MAGAZINE 10(1) (Spring 1989):61-63.This panel from the  
International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence presents  
some of the limitations and areas of future development of expert  
systems. The philosophic nature of the article is its main attraction,  
as it presents an excellent introduction to the question of whether  
expert systems can really ever be "experts."
 
Johntston, Mark and John Weckert. "Selection Advisor: An Expert  
System for Collection Development."  Information Technology &  
Libraries 9(3) (September 1990):219-225. This article discusses the  
development of an expert system to be used in COLLECTION  
DEVELOPMENT.  Slightly technical, but not dauntingly so.  This  
application of expert systems is interesting for at least two  
reasons: its ability to "archive" selection decisions, and its ability  
to lend consistency to the overall selection process.
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Bailey, Charles W. Jr. "The Public-Access Computer Systems Forum:  
A Computer Conference on BITNET." Library Software Review 9(2)  
(Mar/Apr 1990):71-74. Your ticket to having e-mail every day!  The  
Public-Access Computer Systems Forum (PACS-L) is a fun and  
interesting discussion of library technology issues with  
participants from around the globe.  This article (by the moderator  
of the "list") gives the basics of joining (and leaving) the conference.   
 
Kesselman, Martin. "European Online Services."  Wilson Library  
Bulletin 65(1) (September, 1990):82-84, 134.  Describes what the  
author has found in his research of European online catalogs and  
databases, and what further information he plans to disseminate.   
These resources remain largely untapped in North America and  
include such databases as: BLC (BLAIS-LINE), DIMDI (FRG), Pergamon  
Financial Data Services, and others. 
 
Kirk, Thomas and Thomas Michalak. "The Coalition for Networked  
Information." C&RL News 51(8) (September, 1990):751-753. This  
article describes the newly formed Coalition (of which Berkeley is a  
founding member) and its opening meeting.  CNI is formally named  
The Coalition for Networked Information to Advance Scholarship and  
Intellectual Productivity.  Member organizations include: ARL,  
CAUSE, EDUCOM, and ACRL. 
 
Nielsen, Brian. "Finding it on the Internet: the Next Challenge for  
Librarianship." Database 13(5) (October, 1990):105-107. A short  
discussion of the Internet and its relationship to libraries in the  
present and the future.  This article also brings up the salient issues  
of "ownership" and cataloging with respect to online catalogs,  
databases, and electronic material. 
 
 
Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Halbert, Martin. "Multimedia: The Agony and the Ecstasy for  
Information Professionals." CD-ROM Professional 3(5)(Sept 1990):6- 
9. This article addresses both the promise and problems of  
interactive multimedia: the range of possibilities of the new  
technology is promising but is also the source of problems in that  
the lack of standards will delay and confuse the adoption of the  
technology.  Nevertheless, the author encourages librarians and  
computer center professionals to become familiar with the  
strengths and weaknesses of competing standards in multimedia.
