   ALCTS Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access. Task Force on
   Metadata Summary Report American Library Association, Association for
   Library Collections and Technical Services, Chicago: June 1999.
   (http://www.ala.org/alcts/organization/ccs/ccda/tf-meta3.html). - This
   is the summary report of the American Library Association's ALCTS Task
   Force on Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access relating to
   four out of five of its charges (the fifth will be considered in light
   of the findings of of the first four). The charges consist of: 1)
   analyzing the resource description needs of libraries, 2) building a
   conceptual map of the resource description landscape and developing
   models for using metadata both inside and outside the library
   community, 3) devising a definition of metadata and investigating the
   interoperability of newly emerging metadata schemes with the
   cataloging rules and MARC format, and 4) recommending ways in which
   libraries may best incorporate the use of metadata schemes into
   current library methods. The fifth charge not covered in this report
   is "Recommending, as needed, rule revision to enable interoperability
   of cataloging (with AACR2) with metadata schemes." - RT
   
   Bosak, Jon. "XML Ubiquity and the Scholarly Community" Computers and
   the Humanities 33 (1-2)(April 1999):199-206. - This special issue of
   Computers and the Humanities provides selected papers from the 10th
   Anniversary Conference of the Text Encoding Intiative (TEI), a widely
   accepted standard interchange format for textual data. There's a
   little something for everyone in this issue from the history of TEI
   and the basics of XML, SGML and HTML, to current issues and trends for
   the TEI research community. The volume concludes with Jon Bosak's
   closing keynote address on the implications of XML for the scholarly
   community. In his conversational remarks, Bosak asserts that the
   promise of XML (extensible, human-readable, open, easy to use
   standards for providing content) may finally be possible because the
   goals of the scholarly community are becoming congruent with the
   incipient requirements of industry and commerce. In other words, the
   scholarly community will finally be able to deliver desired data, take
   advantage of much cheaper tools, provide richer experiences with
   scholarly publications, link databases and hire people who can be
   easily trained to make this happen. But Bosak cautions that to reach
   this promised land, the academic community must be ever vigilant about
   standards, and "shove vendors forward" who begin to stray off the open
   standards path. - LY
   
   The Eighth International World Wide Web Conference Toronto (May 11-14,
   1999) (http://www8.org/fullpaper.html). - For those unfamiliar with
   it, the International World Wide Web Conference is for Web
   researchers, mostly from universities and the private sector.
   Therefore, this collection of papers consists mostly of research
   findings regarding either cutting edge technologies (some of which may
   never go into production), how people are using the Internet, or new
   uses of existing capabilities. Although many of the papers will be too
   narrowly focused or impractical for those using and maintaining web
   sites on a daily basis, there are nonetheless some nuggets here for
   virtually anyone interested in web issues. - RT
   
   Pear, Robert. "NIH Plan For Journal On the Web Draws Fire" The New
   York Times (June 8, 1999): D1. - Harold Varmus, director of the
   National Institutes of Health, has proposed an electronic publishing
   operation called E-biomed that would allow NIH-sponsored scientists to
   disclose and disseminate the results of their research on the
   Internet. Publishing online would accelerate the exchange of
   biomedical research as well as increase the number of people with
   access to this information. Despite the fact that electronic
   publication of scientific research is already being done by many
   established scientific journals and through the Los Alamos National
   Labs which publishes physics and math pre-prints on its server
   (http://xxx.lanl.gov/), there is opposition to the NIH plan.
   Predictably, critics (mostly publishers and scientific societies) say
   that electronic publishing would allow scientists to bypass print
   journals thus circumventing the peer review process; it would also
   endanger print journals, they say, because most journals have a policy
   against publishing work that has been published elsewhere. The editor
   of the New England Journal of Medicine fears that if subscribers could
   get all their research free on the Internet, they would no longer
   subscribe to the print journal. The NIH counters that, as a
   publically-supported institution, they have an obligation to provide
   access to their information as quickly and inexpensively as possible.
   Furthermore, E-biomed would have a governing board of scientists,
   editors and computer experts who would develop rules of operation for
   the site. - MP
   
   Petrazzini, Ben and Mugo Kibati. "The Internet in Developing
   Countries" Communications of the ACM 42(6) (June 1999)
   (http://www.acm.org/pubs/articles/journals/cacm/1999-42-6/p31-petrazzi
   ni/p31-petrazzini.pdf). - For most of the world, Internet access is a
   rare and costly thing, and this article describes the current problems
   and future challenges for Internet growth outside of North America and
   Europe. Some topics addressed are the lack of low-cost regional IP
   backbones (e.g. monthly charges for circuits between Asia-Pacific
   countries are much higher than monthly charges between those countries
   and the U.S.), the limited availability of local call rates for dialup
   services, and of course the inescapable facts of poverty and
   purchasing power (in Ghana, an account with Africa Online costs $50
   per month, which is almost twice the monthly income of most Ghanians).
   As is often the case with the CACM, our cited article is part of a
   valuable special section; in this case the section is titled "Emerging
   Internet Infrastructures Worldwide." In it are articles on making the
   Internet less U.S.-centric, net development and control in China,
   India and Haiti, deploying wireless data systems in Kenya and
   Thailand, and commentary on the potential global impact of the
   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). - JR
   
   Russell, Kelly and Derek Sergeant. The Cedars Project: Implementing a
   Model for Distributed Digital Archives" RLG DigiNews 3(3) (June
   15,1999) (http://www.rlg./org/preserve/diginews/diginews3.3html). -
   The CEDARS Project (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cedars/) was chartered by
   the UK Electronic Libraries Programme (eLib)
   (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/ ) to investigate issues
   regarding the long-term preservation of digital materials. Their work
   has focused on trying to develop a model for a distributed archival
   information system, based on the idea of "packages". They propose
   three types of packages: submission, archival, and dissemination. A
   digital object would be submitted to a repository as a submission
   package, which would then be processed for inclusion in the archive as
   an archival information package. For online delivery to users, a
   dissemination information package may be required. For example, a
   collection of images stored in TIFF format may need to have JPEG
   versions for online use. The dissemination information package would
   contain those delivery versions of the archival images. - RT
   
   Stephenson, Neal. In the Beginning was the Command Line
   (http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html). - This longish (207Kb,
   59 page, freely downloadable in PC Zip or Mac Stuffit) essay can be
   summarized as an exploration of how we relate to operating systems and
   interfaces, but that doesn't do justice to the humor, tangential
   comments and insights which make this a great summer read for anyone
   interested in computers. The author is an experienced programmer whose
   first novel, Snow Crash, is a computer geek fave and whose latest is
   partially about cryptography. He's been intimate with Unix and Linux,
   Windows and the Mac and Be operating systems; his metaphors for those
   systems and the cultures that have grown up around them gave this
   reader many little epiphanies. (The car metaphor: the Mac OS is a
   sleek but untinkerably sealed European sedan, Windows is a hulking,
   unreliable station wagon that everyone buys because everyone else is
   buying it, Be is a Batmobile and Linux is a state-of-the-art tank
   available at a "dealership" consisting of yurts, tepees and RVs with
   salespeople who are giving it away and will come fix it for free). The
   essay is not just a bunch of cleverness - it's didactic and
   contentious. One of Stephenson's main arguments is that computer users
   have become much too GUI'd away from a real understanding of how their
   computers work. It's a convincing case made by a guy with a technical
   background and the imagination to come up with a good analogy between
   HTML and Ronald Reagan broadcasting a baseball game from a windowless
   room. - JR
