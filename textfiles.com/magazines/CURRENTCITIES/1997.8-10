  DIGITAL LIBRARIES
   
   Friedlander, Amy. "D-Lib Magazine: Publishing as the Honest Broker"
   The Serials Librarian 33 (1-4) (Spring 1998)
   (http://web.mit.edu/waynej/www/friedlander.html). -- Ask anyone
   involved in the creation of digital libraries what the most important
   journal is in their field, and most will name D-Lib Magazine. In it
   you get cutting-edge research reports, descriptions of production
   services, highlights of new projects, and much more. In the two years
   since it was begun it has already become an indispensable resource,
   for which the evidence is here in your hands (at Current Cites we cite
   only the best, and a number of D-Lib Magazine's articles have made cut
   over the last two years). The editor Amy Friedlander bridges the
   library and computer science communities with aplomb, and gathers
   articles that illustrate issues and advances that inform the work of
   both. In this piece she describes the philosophy behind the D-Lib
   server organization. -- RT
   
   Duranceau, Ellen Finnie. "Beyond Print: Revisioning Serials
   Acquisitions for the Digital Age" The Serials Librarian 33 (1-4)
   (Spring 1998) (http://web.mit.edu/waynej/www/duranceau.htm). -- As
   many librarians have realized by now, the game has changed. Not only
   are we not doing the same thing we did five years ago, but in many
   cases we could not have even imagined it. If you need proof of this,
   read this article. Web-based serials simply cannot be dealt with in
   the same fashion as print, although even floppy-disk and CD-ROM-based
   serials were not enough to break the print mold. This article provides
   a thorough description of what makes Web-based serials so different in
   terms of library procedures. Read it and weep. -- RT
   
   Dartois, Myriam, et. al. "A Multilingual Electronic Text Collection of
   Folk Tales for Casual Users Using Off-the-Shelf Browsers" D-Lib
   Magazine (October 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/october97/sugimoto/10sugimoto.html). -- I
   admit to having been very skeptical of the claim made by this article
   that an "off-the-shelf" Web browser could simultaneously display folk
   tales in three different languages -- English, French, and Japanese.
   Yes, Japanese. Without special fonts or language kits. It is a good
   thing I'm not a betting man, or I'd be eating my hat right now. Run,
   don't walk, to http://www.DL.ulis.ac.jp/oldtales and see for yourself.
   I loaded their applet over a 28.8K modem connection using Netscape
   3.01 and was very impressed. By contrast, other (admittedly more
   complex) applets I 've recently tried to load over a 10Mb network
   connection using Netscape 4.0 have not only taken orders of magnitude
   longer to load but have also crashed my computer. This project is well
   worth checking out if you want to be either a producer or a consumer
   of texts in non-Roman character sets. -- RT
   
   Xu, Amanda. "Metadata Conversion and the Library OPAC" The Serials
   Librarian 33 (1-4) (Spring 1998)
   (http://web.mit.edu/waynej/www/xu.htm). -- Every once in a while I run
   into an article that gives me a distinct impression that the person
   writing it is living before their time. This is one such. I have a
   feeling that most of what Xu writes about in this article will be
   barely understandable to most people and yet may be taken for granted
   within five years. Xu's basic thesis is that the best interface to
   information for library users is the library catalog. Given that, why
   should we force our clientele to use a separate interface to access
   Web resources? Why not "suck in" metadata from Web resources into our
   library catalogs and provide our users with "one-stop" shopping? Why
   not indeed? Well, the very idea is anathema to many -- mainly those
   charged with creating and maintaining a highly structured and
   high-quality library catalog database. To some degree, this
   philosophical issue is at the very core of our future digital
   libraries. Will our users increasingly see a division between print
   and digital? Or will we use technology to bring them ever closer
   together? Xu is of the latter camp, but unfortunately she may just be
   a few years too early for most readers. Read this article, read it
   again, then read between the lines. Then think about possibilities and
   our users who depend upon possibilities realized. -- RT
   
  NETWORKS & NETWORKING
   
   Junion-Metz, Gail. K-12 Resources on the Internet: An Instructional
   Guide. Berkeley, California: Library Solutions Press, 1997.
   ISBN:1-882208-22-6. (Instructor's Supplement: ISBN: 1-882208-23-4) -
   An update of last year's edition, this workbook continues in the fine
   tradition of other Internet workshop guides published by Library
   Solutions Press. Serving a dual purpose as both a self-paced guide for
   individual teachers and librarians who want to learn about the
   Internet and as a model training tool for those teaching the Internet,
   this guide is divided into three modules: Module 1 provides a broad
   overview of the Internet and includes everything from the history of
   the Internet to the obligatory treatise on netiquette; Module 2
   focuses on teaching offering suggestions for setting up a general
   Internet teaching strategy and creating assignments; Module 3, for
   those teachers and librarian who are not yet online, outlines the
   basic issues of acquiring the Internet. Each module contains an
   annotated list of resources for further exploration. New to this
   year's addition is an accompanying disk that can be used with a web
   browser and lists the most up-to-date addresses for the many resources
   listed in the print guide. Also new to this edition is a section on
   searching the web (gone are references to Veronica and Jughead). Of
   particular use in this volume is the extensive bibliography of books
   and journal articles (yes, print resources). As with the many other
   Library Solutions Press guides, the Instructor's supplement includes
   Windows and Macintosh disks which contain presentation slides that can
   be used for instructional purposes. -- MP

   Research Libraries News 58(9) (October 1997):627-630, 639
   (http://www.ala.org/acrl/resoct97.html). -- This guide to Internet
   resources lists sites for accessing current, relevant national
   statistics published by reputable organizations. The first part
   includes references to good starting points like the National Center
   for Health Statistics (NCHS)
   (http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/nchshome.htm). Topics of other sections
   include aging, AIDS, cancer, environmental health, ethnic health
   issues and mental health. Most of the references are to U.S. sites but
   there is a brief section on international statistics. -- MP
   
   Lan, Zhiyong and Santa Falcone. "Factors Influencing Internet Use - A
   Policy Model for Electronic Government Information Provision" Journal
   of Government Information 24(4) (1997):251-157. -- The article
   discusses four key issues that must be considered in order to foster
   widespread acceptance of the Internet: 1) Technical development
   efforts should focus on enhancing ease of use by increasing the speed
   of information processing as well as creating standard to avoid
   systems incompatibility. 2) Because Internet access is expensive, and
   because private investment is heavily involved in the information
   revolution, government information disseminated through the Internet
   only reaches the well-to-do. This factor must be considered in any
   attempt to render the Internet the primary mode of access for
   government information. 3) Institutional arrangements which lead to
   the centralization of information services and the effect of economies
   of scale which lead to monopolies in the information services market
   are factors that may hamper unrestricted access. 4) Finally,
   psychological factors influencing information processing to be taken
   into consideration include "fearful attitudes toward the Internet" as
   well as lack of acceptance of this new medium by users. -- CG
   
   Max, J. and W. Stickle. "Humanities and Arts: Sharing Center Stage on
   the Internet". Request For Comments 2150; FYI 31. IETF Network
   Working Group, October 1997 (http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc2150.txt)
   -- This is an easy-to-understand explanation of the Internet and all
   of its various services with the particular needs of artists and
   humanists in mind. For those who match the profile audience and who
   have resisted using the Internet, this may be just the document to
   inspire them to get online and describe what they can do when they get
   there. But give it to them on paper, please. In the early days of the
   Internet we would joke that one could learn to use the Internet if one
   could only learn to use the Internet, since everything describing how
   to use it was online. Better yet, give them a copy of this document
   and send them off on a long coffee break while you connect their PC to
   the network. Then, when they return all jacked up on caffeine, sit
   them down in front of a Web browser and show them how to type in the
   URLs listed in the RFC they just read. Just be sure to escape before
   they ask you what "Request for Comments" means. -- RT
   
   Maxwell, Bruce. How to Access the Federal Government on the Internet.
   Washington, DC : Congressional Quarterly, 1997. An update of his 1995
   guide, the 1998 version contains descriptions of more than 600 federal
   government Internet sites, hundreds of which are new to this edition.
   Maxwell does not claim to list every federal Internet site or every
   document ever produced by the government; for this reason, the first
   section of the book lists such important gateways such as United
   States Government Information
   (www-libraries.colorado.edu/ps/gov/us/federal.htm) or the U.S. Federal
   Government Agencies Page (www.lib.lsu.edu/gov/fedgov.html) describing
   these gateways as excellent starting points in a search for federal
   government information. Maxwell's descriptions of each site are
   concise yet evaluative. He also does a good job of putting the
   Internet into perspective noting that not everything published by the
   government is on the Internet and cautioning the researcher to
   question the accuracy of information retrieved. One wonders if the
   publishers of this guide, Congressional Quarterly, Inc., will ever
   make a website out of this guide. I, for one, would definitely place
   such a website high up in my list of bookmarks. -- MP
