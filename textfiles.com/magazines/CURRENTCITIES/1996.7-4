Electronic Publishing

Arms, Caroline. "Historical Collections for the National 
Digital Library: Lessons and Challenges at the Library of 
Congress" D-Lib Magazine (April 1996) 
[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april96/loc/04c-arms.html] -- The 
Library of Congress is embarked on a massive digitization
program to make much of the cultural heritage of the United 
States available to its citizens through computer networks 
(and thus to the world as well). Arms outlines the program 
and provides background information, but the real meat of 
this piece is the "lessons learned and challenges posed," 
of which this article is part one. Anyone involved with 
digitizing projects, or who wishes to be, will find this 
article fascinating and revealing reading. -- RT

Peek, Robin P. and Gregory B. Newby, editors. _Scholarly 
Publishing: The Electronic Frontier_ Cambridge, 
Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1996. ISBN: 0-262-16157-5. 
-- If academia is your major home or haunt and if you have 
more than a passing interest in the issue of electronic 
publishing, run -- don't walk -- to your nearest library 
(or independent bookseller) and check out what is probably 
THE definitive treatise on the topic. This is a collection 
of 19 papers that deals specifically with the future of 
electronic publishing and its impact on the academic world. 
Editors Newby and Peek assert that as publishing moves from 
a print-based paradigm to an electronic one, the very nature 
of scholarly communication is being challenged in ways that 
it has never been before. The book is divided into two parts. 
The first part "The Impact of Electronic Publishing on 
Scholarly Life" includes an article by Robert Silverman that 
discusses the effects of electronic publishing on the producers 
of academic knowledge and the need for academic performance 
and evaluation procedures to respond to the changing nature of 
scholarly communication. Also in the first part of this book, 
Stevan Harnad writes about peer review and scientific quality 
control in scholarly electronic journals. The second part of 
the book "The New Challenges" introduces some of the issues 
that are unique to the realm of electronic publishing (or at 
least not as common in the print world). Lisa Freeman 
discusses the role that university presses should continue to 
play within electronic publishing; L.W. Hurtado argues for an 
academically-based consortium that would create standards for 
refereed electronic journals; Brian Kahin tackles perennial 
legal issues associated with electronic publishing especially 
copyright. Other biggies who have contributed chapters to this 
book are such familiar names as Clifford Lynch, Ann Okerson, 
David Rothman and Ira Fuchs. -- MP
 
SGML Open Staff. "SGML in Education: The TEI and ICADD 
Initiatives" Computers in Libraries 16(3) (March 1996): 
26-28. -- SGML Open [http://www.sgmlopen.org] is a 
consortium dedicated to promoting the use of SGML, an 
ISO standard for data encoding that enables value-added, 
reusable, platform-independent documents. This article, 
highlights two international efforts which are using SGML. 
TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) provides guidelines for 
encoding literary and historical texts. The TEI guidelines 
are meant to be flexible and scalable, able to accommodate 
any body of text and delimit salient features with markup, 
adding intelligence and meaning. ICADD (International 
Committee for Accessible Document Design) focuses on making 
textbooks available in formats such as Braille, large print 
and voice synthesis. SGML encoding not only provides 
structured access to documents that could otherwise be 
unavailable, but also makes that access more democratic.

Multimedia and Hypermedia

Glaser, Mark. "Video Crawls onto the Internet" New Media 6(5) 
(April 1, 1996): 36-38 [http://www.hyperstand.com/]. -- The 
most important topic of this article is not really the new 
video software discussed, but rather another emerging standard 
for delivering multimedia across the Internet: RTP (or Realtime 
Transport Protocol). Several software vendors offer their wares
and agree to work together to use this industry-driven proposed 
standard. Whether a standards-based approach in this arena will 
work is unknown, but given the perceived market hunger for 
real-time moving image content on the Internet and thus pressure 
to be first, the effort is admirable as well as sensible. -- RR

Wilcox, Sue. "VRML 2.0 Takes Flight" New Media 6(5) (April 1, 
1996): 19, 28 [http://www.hyperstand.com/].  -- VRML, or 
Virtual Reality Markup Language, is an emerging standard for 
describing 3-D spaces and objects that can be rendered by 
VRML-capable software, including some WWW browsers. VRML, an 
area of confluence between the twin rivers of 3-D multimedia 
and the WWW, has naturally attracted a number of industry 
players from SGI, Sony, IBM, Microsoft, Netscape, and Apple 
to formalize the next incarnation of the standard, VRML 2.0. 
Differences between 1.0 and 2.0 are improved texture-mapping, 
dynamic object-behavior, links to outside scripts and 
multimedia (sound, movies), and a greatly increased range of 
software supporting VRML. Other differences include the 
capability for end-user interaction in VRML worlds via 
"avatars" (graphic equivalents of screen names), and storage 
of worlds in small OpenFlight databases. This last improvement 
requires storing the VRML info in a binary file instead of a 
standard SGML text file, and thus veers away from being a true 
hardware and software-independent standard. Therefore it may 
be an accepted extension, but not part of the formal standard.

Zimmermann, Kim Ann. "Imaging Helps Government Serve the 
People" Imaging Magazine [issn: 1083-2912] 5(4) (April 1996): 
72-82. -- This article not only gives justification for use 
of imaging in government as a labor and capital-saving 
technology, but also provides detailed examples from the EPA, 
DOD, and two county and city government offices. The other 
aspect is, of course, the implicit case for improved service 
to the people; however, this cuts two ways, by improving 
government surveillance as well as freedom of information 
goals. Although this article is about the technology and does 
not explicitly delve into the social implications, it is 
useful in any case. -- RR
 
Karpinski, Richard. "Easy Audio on the World Wide Web" 
Communications Week (Interactive Age supplement) [issn: 
0746-8121] no. 606 (April 15, 1996): IA3, IA5. -- This is 
a fairly detailed introduction to three software packages 
available for authoring audio for use on the Web; most do
so in real time, and better yet, inexpensively. Some of 
these solutions do not require a separate audio server 
software component, just the authoring and converting 
package and a WWW server. The sidebar gives a brief 
introduction to audio file formats and other technical 
details. A detail not mentioned in the article is that at 
least one of the applications mentioned, ToolVox, will 
probably use the proposed real-time transfer standard (RTP) 
since it is from a vendor acquired by Netscape as part of 
its LiveMedia solution, which uses RTP. -- RR

Balas, Janet. "Beyond Veronica and Yahoo!: More Internet 
Search Tools" Computers in Libraries 16(3) (March 1996):
34-38. -- While no search tool can find everything, often, 
the more of them you try, the more information you find. 
This article mentions some useful tools for finding what you 
need on the Internet. Resources include sites for finding 
Internet Service Providers (The List - http://thelist.com),
email addresses (Four11 - http://www.Four11.com), newsgroups
(InterLink - http://www.nova.edu/Inter-Links/usenet.html) and 
mailing lists (List of Lists - http://catalog.com/vivian/
interest-group-search.html, TILE.NET - http://www.tile.net/

Banks, Julie, Linda Carter, Carl Pracht. "Library Luncheon and 
Update: Teaching Faculty about New Technology" The Journal of 
Academic Librarianship 22(2) (March 1996): 128-130. -- Through 
a series of luncheons and formal update sessions sponsored by 
the library at Southeast Missouri State University, faculty 
learned about a variety of electronic resources available in 
the library. As a result of the sessions, faculty began to 
integrate what they'd learned into their instruction. -- MP

1996): 41-44. [URL for the links from this article, not the

-- These days there are hundreds of search tools available for 
free on the Web. From searching for someone's email address to 
a finding a shareware software program, there are often several
tools to choose from. This article is chock-full of URLs for
different kinds of search tools, organized by broad category. 
The categories include search engines, directories, what's new, 
email addresses, gopher archives, software search, newsgroups, 
and metasearches. The one glaring omission is a category for 
the increasing number of commercial full-text search services 
such as Electric Library [http://www.elibrary.com/] and NLightN
[http://www.nlightn.com/]. -- RT

Day, Pam A. "Internet Resources in Folklore and Folklife" 
College & Research Libraries News 57(4) (April 1996): 204-207. 
-- A selective list of Internet resources in folklore and 
folklife, this list is strong in the areas of Southern culture 
and Arthurian and medieval folklore with references to 
association homepages, discussion groups and electronic 
journals but seems to entirely omit any references to 
resources on urban legends (alligators in sewers, etc.) or 
contemporary folklife (personalized license plates, swear 
words, etc.). -- MP

Phillips, Carl D. "Energy Resources on the Internet" College & 
Research Libraries News 57(3) (March 1996): 142-146. -- Another 
handy C & RL News guide to Internet resources, this month 
focuses on energy resources. It contains the usual list 
(conveniently annotated) of directories, government agency web 
sites and newsgroups and discussion lists. -- MP

Pratt, Gregory F., Patrick Flannery and Cassandra L.D. Perkins. 
"Guidelines for Internet Resource Selection" College & Research 
Libraries News 57(3) (March 1996)): 134-135. -- A working group 
of librarians at the Houston Academy of Medicine-Texas Medical 
Center recognized the responsibility that libraries have to 
evaluate and select resources regardless of media; at the same 
time, they realized that unlike the traditional world of books 
and journals, Internet resources lack the publishing industry's 
filters. Therefore, the group developed a set of guidelines for 
Internet resource evaluation and selection which they added to 
their collection development policy and which they have 
reprinted in this month's issue of C & RL News. The six points 
of this concise list of criteria (which includes such items as 
quality & content, relevancy, ease of use and more) along with 
the discussion of unique challenges associated with collection 
development on the Internet should prove to be an invaluable 
resource for many information professionals. -- MP

Vander Meer, Patricia Fravel. "Enhancing University 
Administrators' Awareness of the Web: A Library Perspective" 
Computers in Libraries 16(3) (March 1996): 50-56. -- This 
article makes a case for academic librarians to find Web 
applications that are useful to the campus community and 
present informational sessions to promote Web awareness 
among campus administration. The author suggests that by 
using and promoting this new technology, the library will 
be seen as a strategic resource in times of shrinking 
budgets. Resources given as examples include sites for 
university admissions applications, access to grades and 
class schedules and campus security information. -- CJC

-- Finally. Someone who understands the difference between a 
Yahoo and a Lycos. Venditto describes and rates the seven best 
robot-built Web search tools. He includes a lot of good 
background information in the tool descriptions as well as 
searching tips. A table summarizes the features of each tool. 
Although he either did not know about or chose not to discuss 
Alta Vista's quite powerful search features, this article is 
nonetheless one of the best summary articles on the key Web 
search tools I've seen. -- RT

-- In this interview with Don Norman of _The Design of Everyday
Things_ and _Things That Make Us Smart_ fame, we discover all
over again things that we knew (intuitively perhaps) but had 
forgotten amid the day-to-day necessity of dealing with our 
computers. Norman, who is now VP of Advanced Technology at Apple 
Computer is trying to make computers go away. He would prefer 
that we spend our time focusing on the work we are doing and 
stop futzing with the device we are using to do it. More power 
to him. This is an interesting and thought-provoking interview 
that is well worth the time of anyone who has ever used a 
computer. And if you're reading this, that's you. -- RT
