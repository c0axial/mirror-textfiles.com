  DIGITAL LIBRARIES
  
   
   
   Frauenfelder, Mark. "Content-Based Image Retrieval" Wired (June
   1997):82. -- This article spotlights recent developments in developing
   programs that can search image files the same way search-engines now
   search text files (Web pages). Previously, work in this area has
   concentrated on locally-based image databases that would use
   content-based retrieval to search for images with a certain color
   pattern, texture, or composition. This new project works in much the
   same way, looking for commonalites in percentages of areas covered by
   certain colors, textures, etc. but is framed in terms of enabling
   Web-wide search engines that would be the image equivalents of
   Infoseek or AltaVista. - RR
   
   Gladney, Henry M. "Safeguarding Digital Library Contents and Users:
   Document Access Control" D-Lib Magazine (June 1997)
   [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june97/ibm/06gladney.html]. As digital
   library collections grow and expand, it becomes increasingly important
   to protect on-line documents from unapproved access or alteration,
   whether deliberate or accidental. Many of us rely on Unix's native
   permissions system, but it is awkward and often proves an annoying
   hinderance to authorized users. This article, based on work done at
   IBM's Almaden Research Center, describes an object level approach
   based on organizational practice that appears to be much more
   sophisticated. Although this system was developed, I'm sure, with
   military/industrial users in mind, the author's discussion of the
   issues involved and the solutions he has applied really helped to
   clarify my thinking on the topic. - KH
   
   Lynch, Clifford A. The Z39.50 Information Retrieval Standard; Part I:
   A Strategic View of Its Past, Present and Future" D-Lib Magazine
   (April 19 97) [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april97/04lynch.html]. In the
   first part of a two-part series, Lynch explains the Z39.50 standard,
   describes the history of the development of the standard and its
   implementation, and discusses the role of content semantics. Readers
   of this series will gain not only an understanding of the technology,
   but also gain the benefit of Lynch's perceptions about further
   development of the protocol and systems based upon it. Unfortunately,
   those who are eager for Part II must wait un til the October 1997
   issue. - RT
   
   Marcum, Deanna B. "Digital Libraries: For Whom? For What?" The Journal
   of Academic Librarianship 23(2) (March 1997): 81-84. As president of
   the Commission on Preservation and Access and Council on Library
   Resources, Deanna Marcum describes her organization's formation of a
   National Digital Library Federation whose mission is to address the
   complications and problems associated with digital libraries. Although
   research libraries are generally noted for their carefully-selected
   and comprehensive collections, rising costs have forced the library
   community to find new ways of providing access to the intellectual and
   cultural heritage traditionally housed in the library. The goal of the
   National Digital Library Federation is to explore ways that the
   characteristics and capabilities of digital technologies can be
   integrated with the strengths of research libraries to provide
   convenient and affordable access to materials. As such the group is
   urging the library community to provide leadership in three specific
   areas: 1) discovery and retrieval mechanisms; 2) intellectual property
   rights and economic models; 3) achiving of digital information. Marcum
   argues that it is librarians who must take a leadership role -- not
   commercial information providers and computer scientists who are
   already seeing opportunities for themselves in the digital library --
   so that they can integrate values normally associated with the library
   profession to the new digital library. - MP
   
   Maxwell, Christine, and Gutowitz, Howard. "Data Mining Solutions and
   the Establishment of a Data Warehouse: Corporate Nirvana for the 21st
   Century?" First Monday 2(5), May 5, 1997
   [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_5/maxwell/]. Pick up any
   issue of Businessweek and you're likely to read all about "data
   mining" and "data warehousing". Based on industrial-strength computing
   hardware and software, these systems promise to offer new levels of
   instant analysis of markets, trends and inventory-to-sales ratios. Not
   so fast, say Maxwell and Gutowitz. Data is only as good as the brain
   power applied to analysis. They offer the best overview of data mining
   and warehousing reviewed in Current Cites to date, and propose a more
   human-oriented approach. Data mining and warehousing needs to be
   adaptive and to keep the business end-user in mind. Drawing (perhaps
   unconsciously) on the core principles of the library profession, they
   argue that effective corporate information management, is "a social
   system, a physical system, and an artificial biological system, all at
   the same time." - TH
   
   Miller, Heather S. "The Little Locksmith: A Cautionary Tale for the
   Electronic Age" The Journal of Academic Librarianship 23(2) (March
   1997): 100-107. Despite the many technological advantages offered by
   electronic resources, the catalog record is ultimately the key to
   providing access to materials in the library. In this day of OPACs,
   catalogers need no longer be ruled by the tyranny of the catalog card.
   Miller argues that it is through technology that a greater depth and
   breadth of access can be provided and she challenges catalogers to add
   more subject headings to records and to consider adding summaries to
   each record so that keyword searching in an OPAC can be truly useful.
   An excellent, comprehensive bibliography accompanies this
   thought-provoking article. - MP
   
   Weibel, Stuart, Renato Iannella, and Warwick Cathro. The 4th Dublin
   Core Metadata Workshop Report" D-Lib Magazine (June 1997) [http://w
   ww.dlib.org/dlib/june97/metadata/06weibel.html]. As we have reported
   in previous issues of Current Cites, the Dublin Core is one of the
   most promising draft standards in existence for creating metadata
   records for digital objects. This report describes the work of the 4th
   Dublin Core Workshop, held in March 1997 at the National Library of
   Australia. The goals of the meeting were to fu rther revise the Dublin
   Core in the areas of element structure, extensibility, and element
   refinement. In explaining a tension between two positions taken by
   conferees, the article describes a continuum of resource description
   from full-text indexing (lik e Web search engines) to
   richly-structured surrogates (like a MARC record). The two camps are
   described as minimalists (those who prefer a simple structure) and
   structuralists (those who prefer additional element attributes to
   support refinement and quali fication). Out of the meeting came a set
   of "Canberra Qualifiers" (scheme, language and type) which will join
   the "Warwick Framework" as Dublin Core add-ons. One can hardly wait
   for the upcoming DC-5 to see if we get a "Helsinki Hegemony" to bring
   this al l together into a workable whole. Nonetheless, if you're in
   the metadata game (and if you're building digital collections you'd
   better be) then this is the draft standard to watch. - RT

   DeLong, Stephen E. "The Shroud of Lecturing" First Monday 2(5), May 5,
   1997 [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_5/delong/]. DeLong
   explores the ways in which Web-based information competes with
   classic-style lecturing for the attention of students. The explosion
   of information has created multiple pathways for learning, he argues,
   and the best teachers will be the ones who can teach students to
   discern the differences between substantive knowledge and the dross of
   cyberspace. University education will probably change dramatically as
   a result, because learning is "democratized" by the network. Faculty
   and administrators need to face the challenge directly, or risk losing
   the status and prestige of the 800-year old idea of the university to
   more nimble players. - TH
   
   Ghosh, Rishab Aiyer. "Economics is Dead. Long Live Economics! A
   Commentary on Michael Goldhaber's "The Attention Economy" First
   Monday 2(5), May 5, 1997
   [http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_5/ghosh/]. Point,
   counterpoint. Current Cites reviewed Goldhaber's First Monday article
   about the "attention economy" of the Internet in May. Netizens in the
   online community "Electric Minds" were so intrigued that they posted
   the cite and launched a discussion of the content of the article.
   Perhaps this article, written as a response by First Monday's Managing
   Editor, will heap coals on the virtual fire. It's a very interesting
   synopsis of traditional economic thinking and its continued relevance
   in the digital arena. Ghosh writes in a straightforward style that
   will make America's unofficial religion, Economics, eminently
   understandable to an entire rogues' gallery of supply-side apostates,
   post-humanists, and anti-Keynesian monkey-wrenchers. But the author
   avoids patronizing tones. "Scarcity is much misunderstood", he rightly
   claims. He also argues that virtual citizens value a variety of online
   pursuits, and they continue to defy easy description. Flame on,
   Electric Minds! - TH
   
   Jacobs, Paul F., and Holland, Chris. "Archaeology Online: New Life for
   Old Dead Things" First Monday 2(6), June 2, 1997 [http://www.f
   irstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_6/jacobs/]. The authors argue that digital
   media is creating a whole new sphere of value for classical
   archaeology. Their arguments fall into two main areas: first, high
   resolution, three-dimensional imaging can bring archaeological digs to
   life in previously impossible ways, thereby expanding the professional
   audience and readership. Second, online, refereed articles that
   include this high caliber of digitized evidence from archaeological
   digs may be published years in advance of similarly documented print
   publications. The upshot is that it's a very exciting time to be an
   archaeologist who can master digital technology. Since specificity of
   detail is a crucial element in archaeological analysis, high
   resolution digital media can increase the amount of detail that can be
   shared with colleagues, and enable them to participate in
   collaborative analysis much earlier in the excavation process of an
   archaeological dig. - TH
   
   Sewell, David R. "The Internet Oracle: Virtual Authors and Network
   Community" First Monday 2(6), June 2, 1997 [http://www.firstmon
   day.dk/issues/issue2_6/sewell/]. This essay was originally published
   in 1992, and explored the emerging culture and consciousness of the
   Usenet group known as "Usenet Oracle". Now called Internet Oracle, the
   multi-user domain continues to evolve. The meaning of authorship is
   explored by Sewell in detail, and he poses some interesting questions.
   For example, participants in an online dialogue experience the
   submersion of individual identity into an "anonymous, collective
   personality", as a stream of text plays out in a chat room. Hmmm--is
   this what the Vulcan "mind-meld" feels like? Questions about
   individual and collective identity are terra-firma for educated
   netizens these days, but this article's original premises remain
   insightful and definitive, after four years of explosive Internet
   growth. It's well worth the time to revisit this article in its
   updated form. - TH

   Bridges, Anne E. and Russell T. Clement. "Crossing the Threshold of
   Rocket Mail: E-mail Use by U.S. Humanities Faculty" The Journal of
   Academic Librarianship 23(2) (March 1997): 109-117. A survey of
   humanities faculty at Brigham Young University and the University of
   Tennesee, Knoxville revealed their use of e-mail is significantly
   higher than previously reported in the literature. The authors suggest
   that librarians can take advantage of this fact and encourage faculty
   to use e-mail for research assistance, reference queries, interlibrary
   loan requests and collection development information. Moreover, e-mail
   can be used as a launch pad for humanities faculty to explore other
   online library systems and electronic resources. - MP
   
   "California Universities To Develop New Electronic Superhighway", UC
   NewsWire [UC Office of the President]. This article reports on the
   newly formed Consortium for Education Network Initiatives in
   California (CENIC, http://www.aldea.com:80/cenic/) and it's plans to
   build CalREN-2 (California Research & Education Network). CENIC is
   comprised of several large universities and private telcom companies,
   and CalREN-2 will provide a model for building the rest of the new
   "next generation Internet" or Internet2 (http://www.Internet2.edu/).
   The main improvments proposed on CalREN-2 are stability and speed (the
   CalREN-2 announcement points out that at the proposed 600 mbps, the
   entire 30-volume edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica could be
   transmitted in less than 1 second). Real world developments in this
   area are crucial for anyone involved in the Internet. Of special
   concern are the vying notions that these developments will either spur
   the entire Internet community to more dependable and faster
   technologies or balkanize the Internet into strictly commercial and
   research communities with only loose connections between them. - RR
   
   Garfinkel, Simson and Spafford, Gene. Web Security and Commerce
   Sebastopol, CA : O'Reilly & Associates, 1997. Security and commerce
   are becoming increasingly important components of the jobs of many Web
   programmers. As would be expected, this most recent addition to the
   Nutshell Handbook series is a very in-depth guide to the risks of the
   Web and what both the user and administrator can do to decrease them.
   Covered are browser vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, issues with
   Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, and plug-ins, digital certificates,
   cryptography, Web server security (e.g., SSL, TLS, server access
   methods, and secure CGI/API programming), blocking software,
   censorship technology, and relevant civil and criminal issues. I
   especially appreciated the section on writing secure CGI scripts,
   which caused me to take a very hard look at the scripts I have running
   now. The discussion of the evolving field of digital commerce was also
   especially clear and helpful. - KH

   College & Research Libraries News 58(6) (June 1997): 403-407
   [http://www.ala.org/acrl/resjun97.html]. Whether you're looking for
   information about a flood or a famine or a plague of locusts, chances
   are you need to know something soon. That's why the Internet is an
   ideal medium for disseminating information about disasters. From large
   "metasites" that cover multiple types of disasters to more focused
   sites on meteorological, geophysical, biological (diseases, famines)
   or technological (plane crashes, bombs, etc.) disasters, this article
   provides a comprehensive, evaluative list of general Internet
   resources in this area. - MP
   
   Sheehey, Helen M. "A Community Closer to Its Citizens: The European
   Union's Use of the Internet" Government Information Quarterly 14(2)
   (1997): 117-142. This article discusses the European Union's
   "awareness campaign" to promote integration initiatives, and
   particularly its use of the Internet to grant the public, researchers,
   and business people greater access to information. Two main resources
   are at the center of the EU's communication strategies: databases and
   full-text documents available through the WWW. Database services,
   accessible via telnet include ECHO, which is mostly free to the
   general public, and EUROBASES, a fee-based service. WWW resources
   include EUROPA (http://europa.eu.int/), the EU's principal Web site
   which provides access to important documents and background papers,
   I'M Europe (http://www2.echo.lu/), which treats new information
   technologies, and CORDIS (http://www.cordis.lu/), the Community
   Research and Development Information Service, which provides
   information on EU research and development initiatives. Sheehy notes
   the absence of statistical databases from these services and points
   out that detailed statistical materials are available by purchase
   only. The author also briefly touches on the problems of language
   equity in these resources, the absence of a long-term access policy,
   and librarians' role in critically evaluating EU electronic resources.
   The article is complemented by two tables listing available databases
   and URL's of EU WWW servers. - CG

   give him a copy of this article. Next thing you know, he'll be running
   around the reference desk yelling "Show me the money!" The article
   lists the major sources on the Internet for finding out information
   about grants, foundations, fellowships, and other funding sources.
   Included in the list are references to organizations, directories,
   government funding webpages and electronic journals. Particularly
   useful are the references to sites that offer tips and advice on
   successful grant writing. - MP
