Information Transfer 
 
"Netware 3.11: Multidesktop Support Through Seamless Integration"  
PC Magazine 10(7) (April 16, 1991):55.  Novell's latest version of its  
network operating system takes interoperability to new heights.  It  
provides integration of heterogeneous desktop computing  
environments, allowing DOS, Microsoft Windows, OS/2, Macintosh,  
and Unix users to share information and resources.  Netware 3.11  
also supports TCP-IP and offers interconnectivity with Open  
Systems Interconnection (OSI). 
 
Swain, Leigh and Paula Tallim. "X.400: The Standard for Message  
Handling Systems" Library Hi Tech (Special Issue) 8(4) Consecutive  
Issue 32 (1990):43-55.  X.400 is one of the first OSI application  
layer protocols ratified and provides for transfer of information  
across differing computer systems. 
 
Turner, Fay. "The Interlibrary Loan Protocol: An OSI Solution to ILL  
Messaging" Library Hi Tech (Special Issue) 8(4) Consecutive Issue 32  
(1990):73-82.  This article describes the ILL Protocol, based on the  
OSI Reference Model,which allows interlibrary loan requests to be  
sent between heterogeneous computer systems. 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Cisler, Steve "NREN Update: More Meetings and New Tools" Database  
14(2) (April 1991):96-98.  Cisler reviews some of the recent events  
and discussions regarding the National Research and Education  
Network: the Coalition for Networked Information met in November,  
Harvard University sponsored a symposium on computers and the  
public sector, and the Office of Technology Assessment held a  
hearing to discuss access issues of the NREN.  Also included is a  
description of Apple Computer's role in advancing the networking of  
computers and their users. 
 
Karraker, Roger "Highways of the Mind" Whole Earth Review 70  
(Spring 1991):4-11.  Karraker takes a close, and much needed, look  
at some of the political implications of the NREN.  The four crucial  
questions are: Who will build the network?  Who will have access to  
network services?  Who will pay for all this?  What kind of  
information will be allowed on the network?  Karraker wants us not  
only to question, but also to contact our legislators on this  
important issue.  Also provided are some resources for further  
information on the NREN. 
 
Lynch, Clifford A. "Information Retrieval as a Network Application."  
Library Hi Tech (Special Issue) 8(4) Consecutive Issue 32 (1990):57- 
72.  In this article Lynch describes the way the new Z39.50  
electronic data protocol facilitates remote access to information  
resources computer networks.  With the Z39.50 protocol, users can  
construct queries in terms of logical information elements that will  
be supported, or understood, by the both the local and foreign hosts,  
even if they run on different platforms. This interoperability is  
known as Open Systems Interconnectivity (OSI).  Included are  
sidebars on the history of Z39.50 and OSI SR (Search and Retrieve),  
the Z39.50 Implementors Group, and the Z39.50 maintenance agency:  
LC, by Sally H. McCallum Mark Hinnebusch, and Paul Evan Peters,  
respectively. 
 
Planka, Daniela "Network Directory Services" Library Hi Tech  
(Special Issue) 8(4) Consecutive Issue 32 (1990): 93-103.  The need  
for a global electronic directory of networks, users,and resources,  
is being addressed by the Directory (CCITT X.500/ISO 9594)  
international standard.  The actual directory is in development now,  
and is expected to be "logically centralized but physically  
distributed."  While the Planka article can be quite technical, she  
points out that it is important for library professionals to  
understand this emerging development. 
 
 
Optical Disk Technologies 
 
King Alan. "Room with a View: Microsoft Windows and CD-ROM"  
Database 14(2) (April 1991):99-101.  King urges information  
professionals to encourage the development of sane and utilitarian  
user interfaces for CD-ROM products, such as Microsoft Windows 3.0  
's graphical user interface (GUI).  Not only would a GUI be user  
friendly, it would also allow for multitaskingQthe simultaneous  
operation of two or more programs on one computer. 
 
Nelson, Nancy Melin. "CD-ROM Growth: Unleashing the Potential"  
Library Journal 116(2) (February 1, 1991):51-53.  Billed as a CD-ROM  
round-up, this article provides a concise overview of current issues  
and obstacles in CD-ROM implementation, including networking,  
search software, licensing, pricing, and standards.  A sidebar  
contains a CD-ROM product round-up. 
 
 
General 
 
Gillespie, Thom. "High-Tech Libraries of TomorrowQToday" Library  
Journal 116(2) (February 1, 1991):46-49.  This article presents six  
library automation projects pursued by Apple Library of Tomorrow  
(ALOT) grant recipients.
