From the Editor: At the beginning of this month, I began working 
as the Educational Documentation Specialist at NorthWestNet, a
mid-level Internet service provider.  In order to make the 
transition to a new editor and staff easier, I will continue to
edit and contribute to Current Cites for the last two months of
this year.  Since I am now "dot net", rather than, "dot edu", to
avoid a conflict of interest, I have asked Roy Tennant to review 
those articles that deal directly with network service providers.
I am truly excited to be working at an organization providing 
Internet access and services and I am grateful to Berkeley, the
staff of Information Systems Instruction & Support, and the
TechWatchers for providing the environment that has lead me to 
this juncture.  Of course, Current Cites has been an important 
part of my life these past three and a half years, and the 
encouragement of so many readers has been crucial to our success.
It has been a real pleasure, and I hope to see you on the net!

Cheers,
David F. W. Robison

Electronic Publishing

Franks, John. "The Impact of Electronic Publication on Scholarly
Journals" posted on VPIEJ-L@VTVM1 (November 4, 1993) as a reprint
from the Notices of the American Mathematical Society 40(9) 
(November 1993):1200-1202.  Franks addresses some interesting
issues facing authors, publishers, readers, and librarians, in a
time when serial prices are increasing rapidly, university 
budgets are shrinking, and electronic publishing is taking hold. 
Although Franks works in the Department of Mathematics at 
Northwestern University, he has a good sense of the issues 
facing librarians and their role in the information industry.
Franks also published an article on PACS-L last Spring, entitled,
"What is an Electronic Journal."   This new article examines the
changes in the economics of scholarly publishing where authors,
universities, and readers play the necessary parts to create,
publish, and archive referreed works.  Further, Franks offers 
this analysis in a clear and concise manner. - DFWR


Networks and Networking

Christian, Eliot. "Government Information Locator Service (GILS)"
(draft of Novermber 11, 1993).  Available via anonymous FTP as 
text (gils1111.txt), Word for Macintosh (gils111.Word.hqx) and 
Windows (gils1111.doc), and PostScript (gils1111.ps) at <URL:
ftp://ftp.cni.org/pub/docs/gils/>.  Christian outlines the plans 
for a system designed to help users locate govrenment-produced 
information in a networked environment.  According to this plan, 
GILS would offer a variety of views of the data to satisfy both 
inexperienced and expert users across a number of systems (i.e., 
the Internet, BBSs, CD-ROMs).  The GILS would also be agency-
based, with maintenance of the data decentralized.  The system as 
a whole would comply with the current version of the Z39.50 
standard.  Included in the forward to the paper is a request for 
comments.  Comments should be received by December 15, 1993.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. "Serving the
Community: A Public Interest Vision of the National Information
Infrastructure" (October 1993) [available via anonymous ftp in 
Rich Text Format (cpsr_nii_policy.rtf - though I was unable to
get my word processor to read this version) and plain text 
(cpsr_nii_policy.txt) at <URL:ftp://cpsr.org/cpsr/nii/>].  This
CPSR policy paper makes a number of recommendations about the
development of the NII, in terms of economics, social issues, 
and technical issues.  While most of the recommendations have
been made before, they are well articulated here, and placed
with an historical context.  The 26 page text rests on the idea 
that the NII will most likely be an outgrowth of the Internet, 
and even if not, it should take lessons from the Internet.  To 
this end, CPSR has included a short history of the Internet and 
examined some of the social, technical, and political issues of 
it.  A notable reminder is that the most popular use of the 
Internet (in terms of number of transactions), is personal 
communication of one kind or another. - DFWR

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Surviving in the Internet Era" The 
Chronicle of Higher Education 40(12) (November 10, 1993):A22.
The organization the runs BITNET has recognized that it can not
compete with the Internet, so they have come up with a plan to
remain valuable in the academic world.  With BITNET III, users
associated with colleges and universities will be able to look
in the phone book for a local Internet-access number, and gain
access to their home institution's computers when they are
travelling.  The pilot project should begin this Spring, with
local access numbers in 10 cities. - DFWR

Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Open Platform Campaign: Public 
Policy for the Information Age" (November 1, 1993).  Available 
via anonymous FTP as both gzip'd PostScript (op2.0.ps.z - use 
GNUs gunzip to uncompress, then remove the first line) and text 
(op2.0) at <URL:ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/papers/>.  The EFF has 
just released its second revision of the Open Platform proposal, 
bringing it up to date with recent developments in networking and 
telecommmunications policies and technologies.  The idea behind 
the proposal is to encourage the development of a national 
information infrastructure that offers open-access, affordable 
service, and with sufficient bandwidth both to and from 
consumers.  Specifically, "Open Platform service must meet the 
following criteria: widely available, switched digital 
connections; affordable prices; open access to all without
discrimination as [to] the content of the message; sufficient
'up-stream' capacity to enable users to originate, as well as
receive, good quality video, multimedia services."  The 
proposal is also reviewed in EFFector Online 6(5) <URL:ftp://

"FBI's Operation "Root Canal" Documents Disclosed" CPSR Alert
2(5) (November 12, 1993) <URL:ftp://cpsr.org/cpsr/alert/
alert-2.05.txt>.  Through documents released through a
Freedom of Information Act request, the Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility have discovered that the Federal
Bureau of Investigation undertook an orchestrated effort to
convince congress and the public of the dangers of non-
breakable cryptography.  While this is not so surprising, it
is interesting to read that field offices were unable to
provide evidence that modern telephony created any additional
challenges to law enforcement. - DFWR

"GAO Report Criticizes Gov't Crypto Policy" CPSR Alert 2(5) 
(November 12, 1993) <URL:ftp://cpsr.org/cpsr/alert/
alert-2.05.txt>.  A Government Accounting Office report 
indicates the restrictions on the sale of cryptographic
software by US firms to foreign countries has far reaching
effects.  The loss of sales due to the restrictions has 
limited the developers' ability to produce new and better 
software, thereby leaving US businesses more vulnerable to 
computer espionage. - DFWR

"Intenet is a Tough Sell on Wall Street" The Internet Letter
1(2) (November 1, 1993):1, 6-7.  While most Wall Street firms
are unsure and a bit afraid to get on the net, others are using
it to their advantage.  The Internet offers the possibility of
better communications with customers and potential customers,
the ability to transfer data within the company (when security
is not a great concern), and access to a wealth of economic
data.  As an example, J.P. Morgan & Co. receives almost 10
Gigabytes of data a month from the Internet. - DFWR

Kriz, Harry M. "Windows and TCP/IP for Internet Access" posted
in two parts on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (Novemmber 16, 1993).  Kriz has
compiled a list of public domain and shareware programs 
available via anonymous FTP that allow a PC running Windows 
with an Internet connection (hardwired or dialup SLIP or PPP) 
to run TCP/IP applications.  Also included are brief 
instructions for installation of each package.  Even if you
already have TCP/IP applications running on your Windows PC,
you may find this list helpful. - DFWR

"Library Groups Join in Issuing Telecommunications Policy 
Principles" ALAWON 2(49) (October 27, 1993).  The American 
Library Association, the American Association of Law Libraries, 
the Association of Research Libraries, the Coalition for 
Networked Information, Libraries for the Future, the Medical
Library Association, and the Special Libraries Association
have all joined the Telecommunications Policy Roundtable.  The
Roundtable has seven principles relating to the developing 
information infrastructure: universal access; freedom to 
communicate; vital civic sector; diverse and competitive
marketplace; equitable workplace; privacy protection; and 
democratic policy making. - DFWR

Markoff, John. "Keeping Things Safe and Orderly in the 
Neighborhoods of Cyberspace" The New York Times v.143 (October 
24, 1993):E7.  Markoff introduces us to Richard Petthia, the 
coordinator of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).  As 
the Internet grows in leaps and bounds, so does the number of 
malicious computer break-ins.  CERT helps site administrators
handle attacks as well as offering prophylaxis.  For those
unsure of the real danger behind computer break-ins, there is
the attack in England that knocked out weather warnings for the
English Channel and a ship was lost. - DFWR

Markoff, John. "Traffic Jams Already on the Information
Highway" The New York Times v.143 (November 3, 1993):A1, D9.
Markoff describes some interesting events that caused
literal traffic jams on the Internet.  Because of the speed
with which information about events and resources travels,
host computers offering new resources can be deluged with 
requests causing both problems for the server itself, as well as
x for the network.  As Mark Rotenberg of Computer Professionals 
for Social Responsibility says, "If there is a lesson to be 
learned it is that you must create technical fixes for these 
problems because you can't create social fixes."  Once again, 
we are reminded that the Internet is not about computers, but 
about people. - DFWR

Wilson, David L. "Near-Disaster on the Internet" The Chronicle of
Higher Education 40(13) (November 17, 1993):A26-27, A29.  A patch 
for a security whole in common Unix network software was recently
released by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).  The 
patch should be installed on Unix machines that are connected to
the Internet to protect them from unauthorized access.  
Information on the fix is available from <URL:ftp://cert.org/pub/

Optical Disc Technologies

Atkins, Susan L. "CD-ROM: A Review of the 1992 Literature"
Computers in Libraries 13(8) (September 1993):20-53.  Atkins' 
annual tour de force does not disappoint.  In the past, this 
comprehensive review was featured in CD-ROM Librarian.  Earlier 
this year, CD-ROM Librarian changed its name and its focus, 
becoming CD-ROM World.  Due to popular demand, CD-ROM Librarian 
returns as a regular feature within the pages of Computers in 
Libraries.  Its debut appropriately showcases this review of 
literature published during 1992 which summarizes developments in 
CD-ROM technology, with special emphasis on its impact in 
libraries.  The article provides an overview of the CD-ROM 
industry from an international perspective and summarizes the 
effects of CD-ROM on librariy policies and practices governing 
selction, budgeting, collection development, reference, staffing, 
users, and instructions.  Major issues associated with 
networking, licensing, publishing, and standards are also 
prominently featured.  An extensive bibliography, with nearly 400 
entries, concludes the review. - TR
 
Spanbauer, Scott. "The Write Stuff: CD-Recordable" New Media 
3(10) (October 1993):62-68.  This article describes the 
capabilities and drawbacks of the new CD-R systems, from a 
multimedia publisher's perspective.  Although CD-R has real 
potential in the multimedia market, Spanbauer sees CD-R's true 
niche as a corporate archiving and back-up medium that will 
compete head on with tape, rewritable magneto-optical and even 
hard disk drives.  Although CD-R recording systems now cost 
between $6,000 and $7,000, it is predicted that prices will drop 
to below $2,000 within the next two years. - TR

Crawford, Walt. "Dreams, Devices, Niches, and Edges: Coping with
the Changing Landscape of Information Technology" The Public-
Access Computer Systems Review 4(5) (1993):5-21 [available via
email by sending the following message to LISTSERV@UHUPVM1 or 
LISTSERV@UHUPVM1.UH.EDU: GET CRAWFORD PRV4N5 F=MAIL].  With the
explosive growth of information technology in the last few years,
many librarians have felt bewildered and even threatened by the
changes.  Not only must we deal with the actual changes we see
around us, but also with the visions of the dreamers among us
who envision an even more radical future.  Crawford offers some
succor.  While the dreamers are important, their dreams must be
viewed in the context of reality.  And while information 
technology is changing our profession, each library fills an
important niche, filled with both paper- and non-paper-based 
materials, not likely to be replaced entirely by electronics.  
Crawford, himself, envisions a "library beyond walls, but not 
[a] library without walls." - DFWR

Rooks, Dana. "The Virtual Library: Pitfalls, Promises, and

F=MAIL.  Rooks reminds us that the shift towards the virtual
library is just one more step in the ongoing evolution of 
libraries.  Further, she exhorts librarians to become involved
in the development of the technologies and user interfaces,
saying, "It is imperative that librarians become involved in the 
technical design issues of the virtual library, or we and, most 
importantly, our users will pay the price of our failure." - DFWR
