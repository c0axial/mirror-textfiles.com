From the Editor: Beginning with this issue, Current Cites is 
Information Systems Instruction & Support of the UC Berkeley 
Library.  While made up largely of the same staff as the 
Library Technology Watch Program, this change reflects a new 
commitment on the part of the Library to encourage, develop, 
and support the growing number of electronic information 
systems and resources on our desktops. - DR


Electronic Publishing

Brandt, D. Scott. "Accessing Electronic Journals" Academic 
and Library Computing 9(10) (November/December 1992):17-20.  
Brandt describes the way four client/server systems (WAIS, 
Gopher, WWW, and TechInfo) are being used to provide access 
to electronic journals.  While these systems are currently 
being used successfully, each provides certain advantages as 
well as disadvantages, and none is perfect. - DR

Cover, Robin. "SGML Software (exists)" posted on VPIEJ-L@
VTVM1 (February 19, 1993).  Cover argues that SGML readers/
browsers are currently available.  They vary widely both in 
price and utility.  Cover recommends the Electronic Book 
Technologies' DynaText which is available for most major 
platforms.  While most of us do not have browsers around right 
now, SGML browser software is already a 250 million dollar 
industry, and expected to grow rapidly in the next few years.  
Cover also discusses how the use of SGML might affect the way 
text is created on a formal, conceptual level. - DR

Franks, John. What is an Electronic Journal?  Posted in four 
parts on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (January 21 1993), January 1993.  Franks 
offers an analysis of various schemes for distributing electronic 
journals: the vanity press model, the data base model, the 
software model, the subnet model, and the subsidized model.  
Focusing specifically on scholarly journals distributed over the 
Internet for which authors and editors are not paid, Franks 
examines the advantages and disadvantages of each model.  One of 
the main points made in this paper is that for electronic 
journals to be successful, they must leverage the advantages of 
the electronic format.  Franks finds that too often, the 
distribution models conflict with these very advantages. - DR

Hawkins, Donald T., et al. "Forces Shaping the Electronic 
Publishing Industry of the 1990s" Electronic Networking: 
Research, Applications, and Policy 2(4)(Winter 1992):38-60.  
Hawkins and his colleagues at AT&T Bell Laboratories believe that 
electronic publishing will "be a significant part of consumers' 
lives by the end of the decade."  In this article they describe 
the range of products that fall under the rubric of electronic 
publishing (as distinguished from electronic-aided publishing), 
the state of the traditional publishing industry today, and how 
electronic publishing can mitigate some of the problems 
traditional publishers are facing in today's market.  The authors 
focus on seven forces that effect publishing and electronic 
publishing, specifically, both currently and will in the future: 
technology, economics, demographics, social trends, government 
policies, applications growth, and industry trends.  They end the 
article with a list of recommendations for successful electronic 
publication. - DR

Hockey, Susan. "Developing Access to Electronic Texts in the 
Humanities" Computers in Libraries 13(2) (February 1993):41-43. 
Hockey describes the continuing evolution of the Center for 
Electronic Texts in the Humanities (CETH).  Among the Center's 
initiatives are the development of a text encoding standard, the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) employing Standard Generalized 
Markup Language (SGML), and an Internet-accessible textbase 
(Brown University's Women Writer's Project). - DR

Kriz, Harry M. and Dave Beagle. "Electronic Journal System" 
posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (March 3, 1993).  Kriz and Beagle 
report on a local system developed to automatically receive and 
archive and electronic journal (CHIP News) and then make the text 
publicly-accessible with full search capabilities.  The system is 
fully automated and reports its progress daily to the 
bibliographer in charge.  If a problem is encountered, the 
bibliographer is notified and appropriate action is suggested.  
While this system was designed specifically for CHIP News, it is 
clearly an interesting model for the processing of other 
electronic journals. - DR

LOC Workshop on Electronic Texts: Proceedings / edited by James 
Daley.  Project Gutenberg, February 1993 [available via anonymous 
ftp from mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu as locet10.txt in directory 
etext/etext93].  Daley has compiled an impressive document (well 
over 100 pages) covering the proceedings of this June 1992 
conference at the Library of Congress.  Speakers from all areas 
of electronic publishing came together and discussed their work, 
their hopes, their plans, and what they thought the Library of 
Congress could do to foster the electronic library.  Included here 
are discussions of imaging, searching coded texts, computer 
networks, CD-ROM production and dissemination, preservation of 
materials through conversion to electronic format, and the study 
of the use of electronic materials by scholars.  A key element of 
the conference, and the proceedings, were the discussions among 
the participants.  For instance, the CD-ROM advocates and the 
network advocates could help each other understand the benefits of 
each technology, and together see where each has its place.  
Clearly this was a breakthrough conference, even if resolutions 
were not made. - DR

Love, James. "Update On Windo/Gateway Legislation" Taxpayer 
Assets Project, Information Policy Note, February 28, 1993 
[posted on CPSR@GWUVM on March 3, 1993].  Love reports on the 
replacement bill for last year's GPO/WINDO legislation, now 
called GPO Access (though the name may change).  The bill is 
intended to give the public improved access to government 
information in electronic form.  According to Love, the new bill 
is not as strong as previous versions and Love decries the 
support given by the American Library Association and the very 
fact congress is proceeding with a watered down effort. - DR

Rawlins, Gregory J.E. "The New Publishing: Technology's Impact 
on the Publishing Industry Over the Next Decade" Public-Access 
Computer Systems Review 3(8) (1992):5-63 [available by sending 
the following e-mail messages to LISTSERV@UHUPVM1: GET RAWLINS1 
PRV3N8 F=MAIL and GET RAWLINS2 PRV3N8 F=MAIL].  While 
concentrating on book publishing, Rawlins examines a wide range 
of issues related to electronic publishing in the coming decade, 
predicting a full-scale revolution.   Rawlins explores issues of 
copy protection and copyright, the information economy, 
electronic publishing formats, book selling, libraries, and the 
advantages of electronic publication.  Some of his discussion is 
a bit quixotic and the issue of appealing displays is almost 
ignored.  On the other hand, this article provides an interesting 
view of some of the possibilities and struggles that lay ahead.

Taubes, Gary. "Publications by Electronic Mail Takes Physics by 
Storm" Science 259 (February 26, 1993):1246-1248.  Taubes 
describes how the use of an e-mail bulletin board to distribute 
high-energy physics preprints has fundamentally altered how many 
physicists do their work.  By now there are more than 8000 users 
of this bulletin board system in a number of subdisciplines of 
physics.  Publishers of scientific journals are taking note, and 
some are getting into the electronic act themselves.  While 
physics was ripe for this type of transformation (established use 
of non-peer reviewed preprints and the pressure of timelines), 
there are valuable lessons here for other disciplines. - DR

Van Goethem, Jeri and Richard Jasper. "Okerson Talk Spotlights 
'Proprietary Obstacles' Facing Electronic Publishing" ALCTS 
Network News 5(15) (March 11, 1993).  Van Goethem and Jasper 
report on a talk given by Ann Okerson, director of the 
Association for Research Libraries' Office of Scientific and 
Academic Publishing, at ALAs 1993 mid-winter conference on 
information ownership and management in the era of electronic 
publication.  Okerson contends that authors, libraries, and 
publishers must reexamine the issues of copyright and ownership 
with an eye to updating these relationships and reestablish the 
balance between interests of the parties involved. - DR

Berman, Jerry and Daniel J. Weitzner. "Keys to Privacy in the 
Digital Information Age" Electronic Networking: Research,
Applications, and Policy 2(4) (Winter 1992):2-5.  In this opinion 
piece, Berman and Weitzner describe efforts by the (US) National 
Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) to block the use and sale of technologies that provide high 
quality data protection.  As the Director and Senior Staff Counsel 
of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, respectively, they also 
describe the efforts of the EFF in blocking the NSA and FBI 
initiatives.  They argue that "In the information age, concerns 
for protecting individual privacy should take precedence over 
outmoded national security concerns left over form the Cold War."

Foster, Steve and Fred Barrie. veronica FAQ.  Posted in two parts 
on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (January 25, 1993) [available via gopher at 
veronica.scs.unr.edu, in the veronica directory].  Foster and 
Barrie have published this very helpful set of answers to 
frequently asked questions about veronica, the interactive gopher 
index (or meta-burrow) that aides users in resource discovery.  
As developers of the software, Foster and Barrie provide insight 
into how veronica works, why it acts the way it does, and why 
some things don't work the way we want them to.  If you don't 
already know, veronica is an acronym for "very easy rodent-

on Science, Space and Technology Subcommittee on Science, 
February 2, 1993 [available by sending the following e-mail 
message to LISTSERV@BITNIC "GET TESTIMON HETERICK CCNEWS].  
Heterick, the President of EDUCOM, testified before congress that 
more of the funding for the NREN should be spent on getting more 
schools and libraries connected to the network, that EDUCOM 
supports many of the recommendations of the Computer Systems 
Policy Project [see Current Cites 4(2) (February 1993)], and that 
there is general concern over "the lack of progress in developing 
a plan for the evolution of NSFNET" and the lack of public review 
of current plans. - DR

Jordan, John and Lee Brintle. "Coalition for Communication: 
Developing a Public Communication System"  Computers in 
Libraries 13(2) (February 1993):29-32.  Jordan and Brintle 
describe their new initiative to create a coalition-based, 
public-access, non-profit network communications system.  
Loosely modeled on the Public Broadcast system, they hope to 
offer the Public Communication System (PCS), employing 
specialized servers and a very friendly client (Panda) over 
the Internet/NREN.  Fees would be paid by institutions and users 
on a cost-recovery basis.  The system would also allow the public 
users to create conferences and publicly shared databases on the 
PCS servers.  Included in this article are a call for 
participation, and an interesting description of the Panda 
client. - DR

McClure, Charles R., William E. Moen, and Joe Ryan. "Design for 
an Internet-Based Government-Wide Information Locator System" 
Electronic Networking: Research, Applications, and Policy 2(4) 
(Winter 1992):6-37.  In a follow-up to a 1990 study, McClure, 
Moen, and Ryan describe their new study of Federal (information) 
locator databases (FLDs) that already exist in order to offer 
insight into the planning process for creating an interagency 
government-wide locator system.  They propose a distributed, 
virtual government-wide information inventory/locator system 
(GIILS) based at least in part on the wide-area information 
system (WAIS).  The authors specifically propose that government 
agencies contribute data to the system in a Z39.50 compliant 
format to ensure a coherent distributed database. - DR 

Ramirez, Anthony. "Data Can Move 45,00 Times Faster, for a Price" 
New York Times 142 (March 10, 1993):C4 (Western edition).  
Ramirez describes the advanced capabilities of asynchronous 
transfer mode (ATM) which allows the high-speed transfer of any 
data of any type over typical telephone lines.  ATM accomplishes 
this feat by establishing a standard packet size, but varying the 
number of packets sent per second according to the amount of 
traffic on the line.  Seen as a competitor to ISDN, Ramirez 
quotes some high-powered executives who believe that ATM will 
become the standard for networking in the future. - DR

an Information Infrastructure Technology Program to assist 
industry in the development of relevant hardware and software; 
provide funding for networking projects in states, school 
districts, libraries, and other non-profit organizations; and to 
promote the dissemination of government information at a 
reasonable cost.  Perhaps most exciting, however, is the fact 
that so many parts of the document refer to the use of the 
Internet/NREN and other applications of information technology, 
indicating a clear understanding of the crucial role they will

CD-ROM Titles in Print 1992" CD-ROM Professional 6(1) (January
1993):60-64.  CD-ROM continues on its phenomenal growth curve
in 1992, according to the results of an annual survey based
upon an analysis of the two main printed directories to 
commercially-available CD-ROM titles: CD-ROM Directory and
CD-ROMs in Print.  Among the interesting findings is that there
was a 65% increase in CD-ROM titles over last year.  If the
present trend continues, 5,000 titles will be available early
in 1993.  Although this will still not quite match the number
of online databases available, CD-ROM could surpass these 
toward the end of 1993.  Predicted trends include robust growth
in available titles, more full text and reference titles, more
horizontal and humanities titles, wider access to CD-ROM by the
Macintosh, growing availability of multimedia titles and 
steadily declining disc prices. - TR

Negroponte, Nicholas. "HDTV: What's Wrong with this Picture?" 
Wired 1(1) (1993):112.  Negroponte argues that the rush for 
high-definition television is a misguided effort.  Pointing out 
that computer makers are busy adding video and other multimedia 
capabilities, Negroponte encourages television makers and 
developers to consider issues of programming in the digital age 
(that is, making the TV smart enough to get the programs the user 
wants), rather than  presentation.  As he puts it, "the future of 
video is no different from the that of audio or data; it will be 
nothing but a bit stream." - DR
