   Given the fact that many libraries are now considering establishing
   in-house digitization capabilities, this is a timely piece. Chapman, a
   well-known author (e.g., Digital Imaging for Libraries and Archives)
   and speaker on digitization topics, and his colleague William
   Comstock, take us through the process Harvard followed to setup their
   own digitization shop. In addition, they include a number of specific
   details and descriptions of how they scan material and the standards
   to which they adhere. Articles such as this provide an essential
   source of authoritative and specific information for libraries lacking
   the resources to develop these procedures on their own. But even those
   libraries that have established such procedures would do well to study
   Harvard's decisions. - [11]RT
   
   Chepesiuk, Ron. "JSTOR and Electronic Archiving" [12]American
   Libraries 32(11) (December 2000): 46-48. - [13]JSTOR was funded by the
   Mellon Foundation in August 1995 as a pilot project to investigate the
   requirements of storing journals in digital form. Since that early
   pilot, JSTOR has seen success in a number of areas. This article
   serves as a useful overview and summary of the project, including the
   challenges that remain. One such challenge is to add enough
   institutional subscribers to reduce the fees that some (particularly
   at smaller institutions) believe to be too high. - [14]RT
   
   Crawford, Walt. [15]Cites & Insights: Crawford at Large 1(1) (January
   2001) (http://cical.home.att.net/). - Walt Crawford, a well-known and
   widely published library commentator has launched his own free
   self-published serial in Adobe Acrobat format. Readers of the likely
   monthly 16-page periodical can look forward to being regaled with
   Crawford's no-holds-barred commentary as well as timely bits on the
   latest PCs and other technologies. Each issue contains a section of
   annotated citations from mostly MS Windows-centric sources like PC
   Magazine, PC World, The Industry Standard and others. One of the most
   useful sections is one that tracks current PC values, in which
   Crawford picks the top systems in three categories (budget, midrange,
   and power) and notes the increase in value for dollar from previous
   benchmarks. The publication of each issue is announced on a variety of
   library listservs, including [16]Web4Lib and [17]PACS-L, or you can
   sign up to be notified directly. This deserves a spot on your reading
   list as one of the most useful current awareness resources available
   for microcomputer related technologies. - [18]RT

   Dale and Beagrie summarize the proceedings of the recent (December
   2000) Preservation 2000 conference, as well as a preceding one-day
   workshop. The meeting was sponsored by CEDARS (CURL Exemplars in
   Digital Archives), the Joint Information Systems Committee, the
   Research Libraries Group (RLG), and OCLC. Speakers from Austria,
   Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the US
   demonstrated that the challenge is international in scope and that the
   response must be as well. One of the main outcomes of the meeting was
   the promulgation and eager acceptance of the idea of creating a
   Digital Preservation Coalition. The [21]full proceedings of both
   meetings have just become available on the RLG web site. It should
   serve as a rich resource for learning about the challenges of this
   issue and how particular projects are attempting to address them. -

   High Quality Documents by using Harvest" [24]D-Lib Magazine (December
   2000)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december00/severiens/12severiens.html). -
   One would not usually look to a project that is more than five years
   old for a model of cutting-edge technology, but the [25]PhysDoc
   project is not your normal case. By either luck or skill, they began
   where others have eventually arrived, using a piece of software that
   is ancient in Internet terms, [26]Harvest, to gather metadata and
   indexing information from over a 1,000 institutions in order to
   construct a union catalog of freely-available physics research. Now
   the [27]Open Archives initiative is promulgated the same model, albeit
   with altered and enhanced technology. What is old is new again, it
   seems. This piece describes the missiont, history, services, usage,
   and possible future of the project. An appendix includes advice to
   authors, web managers, heads of insitutes, and national physics
   societies about how best to participate in the project. - [28]RT
   
   Sirapyan, Nancy. [29]"In Search of..." [30]PC Magazine (Dec 5, 2000):
   187.
   (http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/stories/reviews/0,6755,2652815,00.html). -
   In a series of capsule reviews of 20 search engines Sirapyan gives a
   good overview of the state of Internet search tools. She starts out
   with a clear discussion of the types of search tools available, the
   availability of advanced features such as Boolean queries and
   differences between directories, regular search engines and metasearch
   engines. It is unclear from the article whether the author and other
   testers used the same searches across all of the 20 tools but each
   review clearly outlines perceived strengths and weaknesses, gives tips
   on the advanced features, if any, of the search tool in question and
   suggests the types of searches that are most successful. The tools
   which receive top honors are [31]Google, [32]Northern Light,
   [33]HotBot and [34]Oingo. Finally, there is an extra sidebar the
   discusses meta and specialized search tools such as Infozoid and
   FirstGov. I can't help thinking that the usefulness of this article is
   related to the fact that Sirapyan is PC Magazine's librarian and goes
   into greater depth on those features that are of interest to
   information professionals. - [35]ML
   
   Stoffle, Carla, et.al. "Predicting the Future: What Does Academic
   Librarianship Hold in Store?" [36]C&RL News 61(10) (November 2000):
   894-897. - Anyone interested in the present and future of academic
   libraries should read this brief piece. It is simultaneously
   challenging and encouraging, informative and inspiring. Despite the
   promise of the title, as Stoffle puts it, "I am optimistic about our
   future, but I don't have much of a concrete sense of what libraries
   and librarians will be doing even ten years from now, except that it
   will be radically different." A number of the challenges faced by
   academic libraries are laid out, as well as some strategies that can
   be used to help meet those challenges. Some specific initiatives that
   epitomize the best of our response to these challenges are identified.
   One highlighted development is the creation of the [37]Keystone
   Principles a year ago by 80 academic library leaders, and described as
   exemplifying the "kind of actions we must take to create the libraries
   our customers need." The piece ends with Jerry Campbell's ten axioms,
   which includes the admonition "Whoever acts will create the future."
   Stoffle, et.al. clearly believe that to be true, and if you agree,
   then consider this your wakeup call. - [38]RT

   Initiative: Mission, Current Activities, and Future Directions"
   [40]D-Lib Magazine (December 2000)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december00/weibel/12weibel.html). -
   Long-time readers of Current Cites know that we've been following the
   development of the Dublin Core metadata standard since the beginning.
   This latest piece on the initiative brings us up to date with the
   latest developments in this draft standard for describing digital
   objects. It provides a brief history of the effort, reviews the year's
   milestones, enumerates all the working groups and their status, and
   ends with the workplan for 2001. The lengthy list of references
   identifies all the key working documents as well as related web sites.
