   Cromwell-Kessler, Willy. "Dublin Core Metadata in the RLG Information
   Landscape" D-Lib Magazine (December 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december97/12cromwell-kessler.html). - In
   July 1997, the Research Libraries Group (RLG) held a "Metadata Summit"
   to provide a venue for a number of communities interested in metadata
   to explore their commonalities and differences, particularly vis. a
   vis. the Dublin Core. One of the outcomes of this meeting is the
   document "Guidelines For Extending the Use of Dublin Core Elements to
   Create a Generic Application Integrating All Kinds of Information
   Resources", which is aimed at those involved with developing the
   Dublin Core specification. At the core of this article as well as the
   "Guidelines" is the issue of how to handle the original object vs. the
   digital surrogate. - RT
   
   Frey, Franziska. "Digital Imaging for Photographic Collections:
   Foundations for Technical Standards" RLG DigiNews 1(3) (December 15,
   1997) (http://lyra.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews3.html#com). -
   This brief article serves as a good introduction to the issues
   relating to digital imaging. But since it is the barest of overviews
   of the outcome of a two-year project of the same name, funded by the
   National Endowment for the Humanities, one is left with a feeling of
   impatience until the products from the project are published "sometime
   next year". But at least this piece can give a sneak peek into what
   will be coming soon in more detail. - RT

   "Safeguarding Digital Library Contents and Users: Digital
   Watermarking" D-Lib Magazine (December 1997)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december97/ibm/12lotspiech.html). - Digital
   watermarking is the online equivalent of the long-practiced art of
   marking paper with a mark of ownership or origin. Digital watermarking
   may be important to assert copyright or to mark a file as authentic.
   This article is a great introduction to the principles, applications,
   and technologies relating to digital watermarking. But if you are
   interested in this topic, don't stop your investigation here, as only
   technologies from IBM are highlighted (all the authors are IBM
   employees). - RT
   
  Electronic Publishing
   
   Valauskas, Edward. "Waiting for Thomas Kuhn: First Monday and the
   Evolution of Electronic Journals" First Monday 2 (12)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_12/valauskas/). - First
   Monday's editor surveys the growth of the journal as a case study in
   Internet-based, peer-reviewed journals. It's not at all a self-serving
   piece; on the contrary, he uses his experiences with the journal and
   with print journals to think about the future in broad terms. The
   print journal will not disappear entirely, he believes; instead, a
   rich diversity of formats will persist. - TH
   
  Multimedia & Hypermedia
   
   CIDOC Multimedia Working Group Multimedia Evaluation Criteria
   (http://www.archimuse.com/cidoc/cidoc.mmwg.eval.crit.html) September
   1997. -- This set of evaluation criteria can be used in many
   evaluation or survey projects as a set of questions and criteria for
   measuering the full effectiveness of multimedia resources on web,
   CD-ROM, DVD, etc. - RR
   
  Networks & Networking
   
   Global Information Locator Service FAQ, Dec. 26, 1997
   (http://www.usgs.gov/gils/faq.html) . - This FAQ, compiled primarily
   by Eliot Christian of the US Geological Survey, is very thorough in
   answering questions about this new technical standard to facilitate
   resource discovery. - RR
   
   Minow, Mary. "Filters and the Public Library: A Legal and Policy
   Analysis" First Monday 2 (12)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_12/minow/). - Minow
   insightfully reviews the tangled area of public policy covering
   Internet access in public libraries. Much policy is decided without
   empirical evidence for any stance, and the resulting policies
   demonstrate this gap in their ambivalence, and lack of clarity. Minow
   maps some strategies librarians can employ to balance the needs of the
   community with the directives of the profession, and provides a useful
   review of the issues along the way. - TH
   
   Olson, Nancy B. Cataloging Internet Resources: A Manual and Practical
   Guide. Second edition. Dublin, Ohio: OCLC Online Computer Library
   Center, 1997 (http://www.purl.org/oclc/cataloging-internet). - In what
   is clearly a nascent field, this online resource stands out as the
   only reference tool for librarians cataloging Internet resources using
   MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloging). If you are a cataloger, this is
   the kind of nitty-gritty guidance that makes a difficult job easier.
   One of the most useful sections is the appendix with record examples,
   although in poignant counterpoint at least a couple of the URLs in the
   example records were out of date. - RT
