Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Fersko-Weiss, Henry. "Software: 3-D Reading with the  
HypertextEdge" PC Magazine 10(10) (May 28, 1991):241-282.  The  
most thorough and current review of Hypertext and Hypermedia  
packages for the PC.  Software writers for the IBM world are  
catching up with Apple's pioneering HyperCard and this detailed  
review as well as sidebars on general concepts of hypermedia  
authoring, provide an excellent source for information about these  
packages.   The distinction between hypertext and  hypermedia   
eases as many packages offer linking capabilities to video disk  
sources, sound and graphics packages and other applications.  These  
are clearly the second generation of PC-based hypermedia  
applications, displaying some sophisticated capabilities like  
Boolean searching, generous indexing and other new features. 
 
 
Information Transfer

Technology 24(3) (May 1991):95.  In the Document Imaging section

Networks and Networking 
 
Braunstein, Yale M. "Resolving Conflicts between Information  
Ownership and Intellectual Freedom" Library Trends 39(1-2)  
(Summer/Fall 1990):126-131.  The "tension between information  
ownership and intellectual freedom emerges both from the balancing  
of economic and political interests and as a result of the underlying  
structure of communications and information industries."  While not  
a new issue, the advent of mass electronic data and information  
sharing only adds to this tension.  Braunstein investigates some of  
the legal and intellectual aspects of this issue. 
 
CREN Board of Trustees, BITNET Network Information Center  
(INFO@BITNIC) "Why Continued Membership in CREN is Important"  
NetMonth / An Independent Guide to BITNET 38 (July 1991):3-5  
(BITLIB@YALEVM).  As plans and some implementation of the  
NREN/NSFNet progress, it is important that institutions  
participating in the national networks understand the ramifications  
of membership in the various networks currently available.  Those at  
CREN (BITNET and CSnet) "believe that it is important to maintain  
your CREN membership at least until the NREN exists with access  
rules, funding, and usage policies which enable a smooth and  
complete transition from current connectivity and capabilities to  
the new expanded capabilities we aspire to achieve on the NREN."   
The promise of an open-access NREN is not secure.  On reserve in  
LSL. 
 
Eaton, Nancy L. "Freedom and Equality of Access to Information: The  
Lacy Commission Report" Library Trends 39(1-2) (Summer/Fall  
1990):111-125.  Eaton looks at the impact of the Lacy Commission  
Report, which centered "upon dissemination of, and access to,  
information," ALAs response, and the ensuing discussion of  
information in the electronic age. 
 
 
Optical Disk Technologies 
 
Flanders, Bruce "General Periodicals Ondisc: UMI's one-stop wonder"  
CD-ROM Librarian 6(4) (April 1991):27-32.  As the title clearly  
indicates, this is a very enthusiastic review of the University  
Microfilms, Inc. family of full- 
text CD-ROM data-bases.  General Periodicals Ondisc links an  
abstract and index database to a full-text image database of  
complete articles of key publications.  The articles appear just as  
they do in the original publication-only in black and white-complete  
with photographs, charts, graphics and  
maps. 
 
Kesselman, Martin "CD-ROM/Online Update" Wilson Library Bulletin  
65(7) (March 1991):94-97.  Among the new products Kesselman  
discusses is the Kubik Compact Disc Changer Jukebox, which has the  
potential to take CD-ROM jukebox technology a giant step forward.   
Currently in the prototype phase of development, this jukebox  
format has a capacity of 240 discs and includes a multiple server  
with up to five Phillips drive mechanisms.  It would greatly enhance  
access to large CD-ROM sets such as UMI's full-textcollections. 
 
King, Alan "Kicking the tires: the fine art of CD-ROM product  
evaluation" Online 15(3) (May 1991):102-104.  The author outlines  
the basic foundation for planning and executing a CD-ROM product  
evaluation during a trial run period offered by the manufacturer. 
 
Quint, Barbara "Controversy over NLM CD-ROM licensing prices" CD- 
ROM Librarian 6(4) (April 1991):24-26.  This articles discusses the  
National Library of Medicine's controversial fee restructuring for  
networked CD-ROMs.  Annual fees for providing access to CD-ROM  
Medline databases through local area networks have jumped from  
$100 to many thousands of dollars in some cases.  Medical librarians  
are outraged and the information community fears that NLMs move  
may be precedent-setting. 
 
 
General 
 
Duggan, Mary Kay. "Copyright of Electronic Information: Issues and  
Questions" Online 15(4) (May 1991):20-26. Electronic information is  
discussed in relation to the issues of copyright, fair use, and the  
protection of intellectual property vs.the free exchange of ideas.   
The author anchors these broad topics in everyday reality by citing  
specific examples of current uses of CD-ROMs and other electronic  
databases. 
 
Seiden, Peggy, ed.  Survey of Libraries Providing Locally Mounted  
Databases. RASD Occasional Papers, 8.  Chicago: American Library  
Association, Reference and Adult Services Division, 1991.  The  
growing phenomenon of libraries mounting additional databases on  
their online catalog systems is documented by this survey of U.S. and  
Canadian libraries conducted during 1989.  Analytic essays  
accompany the survey data.

Review. A thoughtful, stimulating, and wide-ranging review of  
issues regarding intellectual property, copyright, free scholarly  
exchange, and a host of related issues within the environment of a  
national research and education network. Definitely a must read for  
librarians interested in networking issues.
