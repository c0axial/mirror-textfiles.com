Brandt, D. Scott. "'Neither Fish Nor Fowl' - The Persisting 
Elusiveness of Electronic Information"  Academic and Library
Computing 9(9) (October 1992):16-19.  Brandt addresses the 
related problems of creating policies on collecting of and access
to electronic resources in libraries.  He notes that collection 
of e-documents that are purchased or licensed are typically  
treated as traditional purchases.  The more complex issue arises 
with "free" or publicly accessible objects.  There are the 
traditional questions of appropriateness to the institution, but 
also ones of hidden cost in providing access to these resources.  
Brandt suggests that libraries treat these "free" documents as 
gifts, or ILL transactions where the library does recognize costs, 
but somewhat lower costs than those associated with traditional 
purchases. - DR

McMillan, Gail. "Technical Processing of Electronic Journals" 
Library Resources & Technical Services 36(4) (October 1992):
470-477.  Acknowledging the fact that "the libraries' online 
catalog is the best single place for scholars and students...
to find out what their options for information resources are," 
McMillan describes the procedures the Library at Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute uses for the technical processing of 
e-journals.  The decision to provide full technical processing 
for e-journals guarantees traditional online access to works 
published via this new medium.  Although the format of 
publication may be new and high-tech, with a few modifications 
the processing of e-journals easily fits into the adaptable 
procedures originally designed for the more common serial 
formats. - LR


Hyper- and Multimedia

Aslib Information 20(10) (October 1992) An issue from the
Association for Information Management (UK) largely devoted to
developments in multimedia computing:
 
o	Callaghan, Jane.  "British Interactive Multimedia 
Association" pp. 385-386.  The author describes the composition 
and activities of BIMA.  
 
o	Martin, Gillian. "The Impact of Multimedia Systems on 
Libraries" pp. 372-374.  This article addresses the question of 
whether multimedia systems will replace books by looking at both 
the future impacts of multimedia in libraries and on the future 
of the book as we know it.  As we move towards the "virtual 
libraries" of the future, conventional lending libraries will 
need to reassess the needs of their clientele.  As for books, 
their role in libraries will change to reflect a growing reliance
on other technologies for learning and reference.
 
o	Richie, Ian. "Of Course Multimedia is Hot -- So Be 
Careful or You'll Burn Yourself" pp. 375-376.  A thought-
provoking and cautionary piece that weighs the merits of packaged
multimedia systems and user-created platforms.  The author 
illustrates the near-desperation of manufacturers seeking to 
create a major market where as yet only a minor one exists and 
warns against becoming too infatuated with the technology.
 
o	Rickard, Stephen. "McGraw-Hill: A Strategic Approach to
Multimedia Publishing" pp. 378-380.  An examination of pedagogical
and technological considerations to be made in the publishing of
multimedia products.  The emerging notion is that multimedia may
become more widely used by the public as the barrier of system 
costs begins to lessen in tandem with the drop in high-end 
computer prices.
 
o	Wynne, Richard. "Multimedia Authoring: Not for the Faint-
Hearted" pp. 382-384.  As system costs continue to decrease, the 
potential for authoring of multimedia products in smaller 
environments increases.  The author describes the work of 
MedMedia in creating story boards and scripts which have resulted
in two acclaimed packages released in 1992: 'The Nature of Genes'
and 'The Etiology of Cancer'.  The collaboration of authors with
a production team may be indicative of a path to successful 
multimedia publishing. - MT
 
Beer, Jeffrey. "3-Dimensional Desktop Animation: Fake Reality is
Coming to a PC Near You"  CD-ROM Professional 5(6) (November 
1992): 33-38.  Autodesk's 3-D Studio (Release 2) is a three-
dimensional modeling and animation product for off-the-shelf 
desktop platforms. Its capabilities have already begun to change 
the shape of business for doctors, lawyers, designers, and the 
film industry as the modeling capabilities more closely and 
convincingly reflect reality.  Even the movement of virtual 
cameras and lighting arrays is made easy by the program which 
promises to raise the level of multimedia production in the DOS 
world. - MT

Culshaw, John. "American Memory: Taking the Library of Congress 
to the Masses"  CD-ROM Librarian 7(9) (October 1992):14-21.  The
prototype project American Memory is presently being tested in a
variety of sites across the country.  This package combines
photographs, motion pictures, sound recordings, and printed items
from the Library of Congress into a multimedia system that allows
users to sample LC's vast collections from a Macintosh 
workstation.  Interestingly, the replacement of information
surrogates like catalog records with the information itself in 
this type of product brings up the question of how clients will 
make use of their retrievals.  The experience of the staff at the
University of Colorado at Boulder would seem to indicate that 
users will continue to rely on intermediaries for reconciliation 
of their needs with what the system provides. - MT
 
Ito, Russell. "The Multimedia Mac: The Macintosh IIvx"  MacUser
8(12) (December 1992):126-131.  This revision of the popular Mac
IIci holds great promise for multimedia in its upgrade of hardware
and incorporation of a 5.25 inch drive bay for CD-ROM or other
magneto-optical drive.  The $3,000+ list price almost begins to
look reasonable when one factors in the software and the 10 CD-ROM
titles that will be bundled with the CD-ROM IIvx. - MT
 
Miller, Carmen. "Dr. Thomas A. Furness III, Virtual Reality 
Pioneer"  ONLINE 16(6) (November  1992):14-27.  Virtual Reality
(VR) is explained thoroughly in this interview with Dr. Furness
III, Director of the Human Interface Technology Laboratory.  VR
enables the user to interact with data "in a way that provides 
the ability to "enter" and navigate through a computer-generated 
3-D "world" or environment...and interact with objects within
that environment." - VR
  
--. "Virtual Reality and Online Databases: Will 'Look and Feel'
literally mean 'Look' and 'Feel?'"  ONLINE 16(6) (November 1992):
12-13.  Miller is convinced that we have to engage and interact 
in a three-dimensional world of computers in order to change the 
way we think and learn, thus better assimilating the vast 
information available to us. - VR
 
Rosebush, Judson. "Adventures in QuickTime"  CD-ROM Professional
5(6) (November 1992):17-23.  A thorough description of the product
that brings video to the desktop.  The notion of time in the
product extends well beyond the name, as users can coordinate
aspects of the presentation accurately with the assistance of the
QuickTime clock.  As an extension of the operating system,
QuickTime begins to integrate compression, cut and paste features
for each media element and cross-platform control of media
presentations in a solid framework. - MT

DeLoughry, Thomas J. "Project Aims to Save Visual Images by
Storing Them on Compact Disks"  The Chronicle of Higher Education
(October 28, 1992):A22.  The Eastman Kodak Company, Cornell 
University, and the University of Southern California are 
involved in a project to store visual images on compact disks. 
This method of storage will have interesting implications for 
the preservation and access of the visual collections of the 
libraries involved. - VR
 
Holden, Lynn. "The Interdisciplinary Teaching Network (ITeN): 
Ancient Egypt Prototype Application"  ASIS Bulletin 19(1) 
(October 1992):10-11.  The Interdisciplinary Teaching Network

environment to permit linking program segments in many different 
ways."  The project is intended to bring to the world of
instruction and research a computerized multidisciplinary
learning environment. - VR
 
Santosuosso, Joe. "Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for
Libraries and Publishers"  ASIS Bulletin 19(1) (October 1992):15-
17.  EDI promises to improve the exchange of messages, data, and

indicates that this electronic format would offer improvement to
some library operational functions, especially in the serials 
orders/acquisition area. - VR

some of the connections are still in development (e.g., instant 
infrared LANs), others, like a PowerBook-cellular phone interface, 
are shipping. - DR

Clinton, Bill. "A Technology Policy for America: Six Broad 
Initiatives" EFFector Online 3(8) (November 4, 1992).  As part of
a broad based proposal to enhance the USs R&D position, now 
president-elect Clinton explains that "Federal funding for the 
National Research and Education Network is one example of how the 
federal government can serve as a catalyst for private sector 
infrastructure investment.  We will also provide additional 
funding to network our schools, hospitals and libraries."   There 
is a clear theme in this proposal that a strong R&D initiative 
will benefit all Americans in the long run. - DR

Dern, Daniel P. "Interview with Dan Lynch, President and Founder, 
INTEROP" Internet World 3(8) (October 1992):14-16.  INTEROP has 
become *the* Internet conference, with over 55,000 attendees at
the Fall '92 conference.  In this interview, Lynch talks about how 
it all got started and where he sees the net going.  While 
decrying arguments over commercialization and protocols, Lynch 
describes the Internet as the "glue for building a huge worldwide 
society of people who cooperate with each other." - DR

Achieve a Single Worldwide TCP/IP/OSI/CLNP Internet by the Year 
2000" ConneXions: The Interoperability Report 6(10) (October 
1992):24-31.  desJardins seeks to broker a peace between the OSI/
CLNP (international) and TCP/IP (US) communities by appealing to 
the moderates of each camp.  He proposes a compromise protocol 
framework dubbed "Internet 2000" that combines parts of both 
protocol suites as well as offer a solution to the problem of the
depletion of address space. - DR 

Hinnebusch, Mark. "A Primer on Z39.50 - Part 8" Academic and 
Library Computing 9(9) (October 1992):24-28.  In the last of his  
Z39.50 primer series, Hinnebusch describes an actual search and 
retrieval using the Z39.50 protocol.  In this example Hinnebusch 
goes into technical detail of the process and includes pseudo-code 
for the programming types.  The protocol is supposed to make all 
of this invisible, but it doesn't hurt to have at least and idea 
of what's going on behind the screen. - DR 

Internet: Getting Started. Managing Editor, April Marine.  Menlo 
Park: SRI International, 1992.  Already in its second printing 
(with revisions), this reference source on the Internet covers a 
broad range of topics not normally covered in single sources.  
Brought together are chapters on the organizational workings of 
the net, how one joins (including sections on obtaining an IP 
address, installing a router, etc.), costs, lists of service 
providers, non-US networks and service providers.  The second 
part covers some of the background, including the list of RFCs 
and description of the RFC process, Internet applications, 
organizations, and a classified list of resources for further 
information.  There's lots more than can be covered here, but 
suffice it to say, the serious networker should have this book 
around. - DR

Kunze, John A. "Nonbibliographic Applications of Z39.50" The 
Public Access Computer Systems Review 3(5) (1992):4-30 
[available by sending the following message to 
LISTSERV@UHUPVM1: GET KUNZE PRV3N5 F=MAIL].  Kunze uses the
example of the UC Berkeley InfoCal server (a not-quite-CWIS) to
demonstrate some of the developments in non-bibliographic record
syntax and attributes.  Since Kunze is a member of the Z39.50 
Implementors Group, the article presents us with an opportunity
to understand some of the process of the ongoing development of
the standard, even if we don't understand all of the technical
details - DR

LaQuey, Tracy, with Jeanne C. Ryer. The Internet Companion: A 
Beginner's Guide to Global Networking.  Forward by Senator Al 
Gore.  Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, c1993.  LaQuey and Ryer 
have put together an excellent guide to networking for the 
beginner.  The authors provide the uninitiated or newly initiated 
with both motivating decriptions of the power of the network as 
well as the tools for getting connected and guides for sucessful
activity on the net.  Rather than trying to list all of the neat 
resources that are available, the authors have described the key 
sources for further information.  The coverage of issues is quite 
broad, and I learned some new things about the types of 
connections available.  For only US$10.95, this is a great buy.

Nelson, Nancy Melin. "ISDN Test Call: Advent of National ISDN" 
Academic and Library Computing 9(9) (October 1992):12.  Nelson 
reports on the first interstate call using the developing ISDN 
network.  This technology offers simultaneous transmission of 
voice, data, video, graphics, and signaling over a single 
telephone line.  The national ISDN network was expected to be 
launched on November 16th, 1992 and is designed to work between 
any manufacturer's switching system and any vendor's telephone 
equipment. - DR

Strauss, Howard Jay. "CWISes: Myth, Mania, or Miracle" Academic 
and Library Computing 9(9) (October 1992):13-16.  In the first 
of a series of columns called "Data Day," Strauss explains how 
a Campus-Wide Information System can be used as a marketing tool 
by libraries and other campus information providers.  He also 
argues that while the library will be providing large chunks of 
information, and the computer center may provide technical 
support, the campus public information office may be the best 
department to actually  administer the CWIS since they already 
have experience in creating a public face for the institution.

Tyckson, David. "The Settling of the Internet" EFFector Online 
3(7) (October 22, 1992).  Causing a sensation when it hit the 
net, Tyckson argues that the Internet hit a turning point last 
summer and moved from the pioneering to the settling stage.  
While he applauds this maturation of the medium, he also notes 
the loss of a certain freedom and enthusiasm as "the 
formalization process will tend to discourage 'skywriting' as we 
have known it in the past." - DR

Beheshti, Jamshid and Andy Large. "Networking CD-ROMs: Response 
Time Implications" CD-ROM Professional 5(6) (November 1992):70-77.
A commonly-held assumption is that networked CD-ROMs produce
slower response times than their standalone counterparts. Beheshti
and Large of McGill's Graduate School of Library and Information
Studies confirmed this assumption in an experiment designed to
answer the question: what are the response time implications for
CD-ROM searching as additional workstations are networked?  
Although response times increased as the number of workstations
increased, the degradation was not uniform across different CD-
ROMs or when using different kinds of search statements. While 
simple, non-truncated single index term searches performed 
satisfactorily on simultaneously accessed CD-ROMs, the more 
complex searches characterized by multiple, truncated index terms 
joined by boolean operators yielded unsatisfactory response times.

Hartigan, John M. "Price Versus Performance in the Optical Media"
CD-ROM Professional 5(6) (November 1992):8-9.  Hartigan cautions
against the apples and oranges comparison between optical and
magnetic media. The performance of CD-ROM is often measured 
against what magnetic media does best, ignoring the attributes 
such as crash-proof media, data integrity, portability, and low
publishing costs.  Hartigan defines optical media as enabling
technologies that allow us to do things not possible before
rather than an improvement over an existing technology. Therefore,
the price/performance equation of optical media must be adjusted
in terms of systems need rather than compared to other methods
of delivery. - TR
 
Herther, Nancy. "Mergers, Consolidations and More: CD-ROM

the CD-ROM industry over the past year. Partially a reflection of
the economy and the ten-year maturation of the industry, the
degree and extent of the changes are significant. - TR

Lynn, Meridian Data's new president.  In this interview with CD-ROM 
Professional editor Nancy Herther, he discusses the future focus
of Meridian Data and the dynamics of the CD-ROM industry.  He 
characterizes the industry as market-driven, once a niche of the 
publishing business and currently making a transition to the 
corporate desktop.  Ultimately, he sees CD-ROM as a universal 
peripheral device. - TR

Tamule, Harold B., et. al. "A New Look at CD-ROM Prices" CD-ROM
Librarian 7(9) (October 1992):22-26.  For librarians faced with
fixed or shrinking budgets, the authors construct a price index
for the CD-ROM market.  Among the conclusions drawn is that CD-ROM
titles aimed at academic and research markets are now only 4% more
expensive than they were four years ago.  This percentage compares
quite favorably both to the inflation rate and the book publishing
industry's price index. - TR
 
Volkers, A.C.W., et. al. "Multiple Usage of CD-ROMs Using Meridian
Data's CD-Net: Performance in Practice" CD-ROM Professional 5(6)
(November 1992):91-98.  In the second article this month 
investigating response times of networked CD-ROMs, networks fared
much better.  The experiment's platform/venue was a 16-workstation
Novell-based Meridian Data CD-Net located in the Medical Library
of Erasmus University Rotterdam.  One especially surprising result
was that the CD Net system was about twice as fast as the
standalone CD-ROM workstation previously used.  Other tests 
included all workstations searching the same disc, all 
workstations active with different operations and the effects of 
multiple, simultaneous downloading sessions. - TR

NISO standard Z39.2, which we all know and love as the standard 
for information interchange of bibliographic data (that is, the 
framework for MARC) was broadened in scope to encompas non-
bibliographic materials, specifically to accomodate records for 
community information.  While this change has many uses (e.g. 
cataloging information on services and governmental agencies) one 
use which will effect technologists is the use of this format for 
cataloging online database services, and other stores of electronic 
information. - LR
