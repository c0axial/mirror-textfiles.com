  Digital Libraries
   
   Arms, William Yeo. "Implementing Policies for Access Management" D-Lib
   Magazine (February 1998)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february98/arms/02arms.html). - Virtually
   any digital library will require methods by which it can control
   access to content. Whether the content is commercial data for which a
   licensing agreement stipulates only certain users may view it, or
   internal collections such as electronic reserve material, libraries
   will have a need to enforce access policies for digital objects. This
   article outlines a sophisticated yet fairly simple architecture for
   libraries to stipulate policies that can interact dynamically with
   information about a particular user (and that user's _role_) and a
   particular digital object (and that object's _attributes_) to derive
   an appropriate _operation_ (for example, delivery or denial). This
   piece reflects work that the Corporation for National Research
   Initiatives (http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) has been undertaking along
   with the Library of Congress (http://www.loc.gov/). - RT
   
   Lamont, Melissa. "Managing Geospatial Data and Services" The Journal
   of Academic Librarianship 23(6) (November 1997):469-473. -- This
   article addresses three often neglected aspects of geospatial data
   management: collection, description, and access of spatial data. The
   author identifies federal, state, and local government agencies as
   possible data resorces. She stresses the importance of standardized
   metadata and points out that, besides appropriate computing
   facilities, skilled staff and user-friendly interfaces, it is the the
   essence in the successful delivery of GIS services in libraries. The
   article emphasizes the ever increasing importance of web-based
   geospatial data services. Not only does the web, as a convenient
   remote access mechanism, mitigate increased demand on local resources,
   it is also evolving into a prime source for information on GIS as well
   as for geospatial data sets. Sites such as the Consortium for
   International Earth Science Information Network (CIESN)
   (http://www.ciesin.org) or Starting the Hunt: Guide to Online and
   Mostly Free U.S. Geospatial and Attribute Data
   (http://www.cast.uark.edu/local/hunt/index.html) are impressive
   repositories for spatial data. Other sites such as GIS WWW Resources
   List (http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/giswww.html) or Guide to GIS
   Resources on the Internet
   (http://library.berkeley.edu/UCBGIS/gisnet.html) provide links to GIS
   related web sites. -- CG
   
   Starr, Susan S. "Building the Collections of the California Digital
   Library" Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship (Winter 1998)
   (http://www.library.ucsb.edu/istl/98-winter/article2.html) - One of
   the most interesting developments in libraries is happening at the
   moment in California, but there is presently very little in print
   about it. Thus this article is a welcome insight into some early
   developments in the University of California's efforts to create a
   California Digital Library. There is as of yet no publicly-accessible
   Web site to point to, but the Executive Working Group Report
   (http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/UCDL/title.html) that led to its
   formation is available at http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/UCDL/title.html.
   Also, a brief insight into the thinking of the man who runs the
   operation can be found in "Visions and Intersections: A Conversation
   with Richard E. Lucier of the University of California"
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february98/02editorial.html), which just
   came out in D-Lib Magazine. - RT
   
   Stephens, Denise. "Managing the Web-Enhanced Geographic Information
   Service" The Journal of Academic Librarianship 23(6) (November 1997):
   498-504. -- This article discusses the development of an
   Internet-accessible collection of digital spatial data sets, the
   creation of "canned" map images, the implementation of interactive
   mapping tools, and the development of a collection of Internet-based
   GIS reference materials at the Geographic Information Center (GIC)
   (http://www.lib.virginia.edu/gic/) of the University of Virginia
   Library (UVA). The Center has assumed the role of "data intermediary",
   creating access mechanisms to a variety of geospatial data in many
   different formats incompatible with widely used commercial GIS
   systems. Aimed at, but not restricted to, a clearly defined primary
   clientele consisting of students, faculty, and staff at UVA, GIC
   developed not only interactive tools allowing for both the creation of
   user-defined maps-on-the-fly (U.S.G.S. Digital Line Graph Data Browser
   http://www.lib.virginia.edu/gic/spatial/dlg.browse2.html) and for
   querying and retrieving data files mounted on FTP servers (Digital
   Resources Catalog http://www.lib.virginia.edu/gic/catalog/) but also a
   "Reference Desk" (http://www.lib.virginia.edu/gic/reference.html) web
   page that assembles links to documents, sites, and databases that
   answers to reference queries. The author points out that the
   successful implementation of Web-based GIS services is based on UVA's
   commitment to innovative service based on advanced technology and that
   the Library's "ownership of the development process" was achieved by
   building in-house technical expertise to develop web-to-application or
   web-to-database interfaces. -- CG
   
   Weibel, Stuart and Juha Hakala. "DC-5: The Helsinki Metadata Workshop"
   D-Lib Magazine (February 1998)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february98/02weibel.html) - Faithful readers
   of Current Cites will recognize the Dublin Core, which is probably our
   best chance at creating a metadata (can you say "cataloging" boys and
   girls?) standard that can serve a diversity of users and purposes.
   This article is a report on the Fifth Dublin Core meeting, held in
   Helsinki in the fall of 1997. The article also serves to bring us
   up-to-date on the current status of the draft standard, in which we
   discover that the frozen north served to freeze the 15 elements in
   what is being called in typical DC style, the "Finnish finish". There
   will be no more elements added or deleted to the core. Don't let that
   fool you, though, as much work remains to specify what can be put into
   those fields (content) and how (syntax). Those of you who would like
   to participate can find everything you need to know at the Dublin Core
   Web site (http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core). - RT
   
   Young, Jeffrey R. "A Community College Uses Windfall to Create a
   Library without Books" Chronicle of Higher Education 64(20) (January
   23, 1998) -- The title should be warning enough to seasoned readers:
   it's a new library at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in
   New York City, but it does have books. However it will also has
   computers, lots of them. The new library, which will be a "virtual
   library" in concept, is the result an unusually generous gift by
   college landlord Miles Fiterman. Fiterman gave the college a building,
   which will be designed to maximize the digital benefits-- along with
   the print. The article goes on to describe how the campus is planning
   to update its library services in the context of the digital
   revolution, and it's interesting not only as a guide to the library's
   planning process, but also as an analysis of library trends in
   general. -- TH
   
  Electronic Publishing
  
   Grothkopf, U. "Bits and Bytes and Still a Lot of Paper: Astronomy
   Libraries and Librarians in the Age of Electronic Publishing"
   Astrophysics and Space Science 247 (1997):155-174
   (http://www.eso.org/libraries/bits-and-bytes/bits-and-bytes.html). -
   This wide ranging article serves as an interesting overview of
   technologies and standards that are providing challenges and
   opportunities for librarians trying to bring libraries into the new
   millennium. Grothkopf touches on networking technology, digital
   libraries, electronic publications, copyright and access control,
   metadata, addressing, archiving, and the changing role of librarians.
   Unfortunately, the addition of the word "Astronomy" may greatly limit
   the audience unnecessarily, since there is almost nothing in the piece
   that is of interest to only astronomy librarians. - RT

   1998):58-68 (http://www.byte.com/art/9803/sec5/sec5.htm). - HTML 4.0
   has barely been released, but to some of us it is dead on delivery.
   We're already looking past it to XML, the eXtensible Markup Language,
   which promises to add much more power, flexibility, and reliability to
   the Web. This article serves as a great introduction to XML and, to a
   lesser degree, Dynamic HTML (DHTML). The online version of the article
   links you through to some of the essential documents on XML. If you
   are interested in the future of the Web, listen up. As the authors of
   this article put it: "Although it will require developers and user to
   retool, the migration to XML must begin. The future of the Web depends
   on it." - RT
   
   Okerson, Ann. "Copyright or Contract?" Library Journal 122(14)
   (September 1, 1997):136-138. -- Uncertainty about making intellectual
   property available without infringing copyright has vexed many
   information managers. This piece contrasts copyright law, which is
   general in nature and open to debate on many points, with licensing
   agreements, which are specific in their wording and presumably
   acceptable to all parties concerned. The author deftly summarizes the
   protections and exceptions in copyright law, and shows how chinks in
   this armor became gaping holes in the hail of arrows from digital
   storage & transmission. Information owners and customers are turning
   to contracts to regain some control. After an initial period of
   paranoia, with proposed licenses so strict as to be virtually
   unworkable, licensing for information resources has become a viable
   way to avoid misunderstandings and courtroom appearances. However, the
   wrinkles are not all ironed out yet - see Okerson's list of unresolved
   issues. An unabashed advocate for licensing in libraries, she includes
   a selection of online licensing resources headed by her LIBLICENSE
   (http://www.library.yale.edu/~llicense/index.html) site. -- JR
   
   Time and Bits: Managing Digital Continuity (February 1998)
   (http://www.ahip.getty.edu/timeandbits/intro.html) -- This "document"
   is actually the website for a conference that took place at the Getty
   Information Institute this month. However, the website includes an
   exhaustive set of links to related resources and will include the
   conference proceedings soon. The conference grappled with the issue of
   information preservation in the digital era. Many topics were covered,
   from the need, desire, and feasibility of preserving digital
   information for decades, centuries and even millenia, to some proposed
   technological approaches for implementing such preservation. To be
   sure, no one had "the answer", but the discussions and links
   themselves will be very informative to anyone involved in information
   preservation and access. -- RR
   
   Z39.50 Draft Attribute Architecture (February 18, 1998)
   (http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/orlando/output/attrarch.html) --
   This draft document, hosted on the Library of Congress' website, and
   announced by NISO (National Information Standards Organization
   http://www.niso.org ) is fairly technical in nature. Nevertheless
   anyone interested in the development of network standards for resource
   discovery, Z39.50 is one act to follow. This document is the latest
   draft of proposed improvments to this standard - including means to
   integrate the recent proliferation of different Z39.50 profiles by
   different user communities (GILS by the US Governemnt, CIMI by the
   Consortium for the Interchange of Museum Information, etc.) -- RR

   Cobb, David A. and Arlene Olivero. "Online GIS Service" The Journal of
   Academic Librarianship 23(6) (November 1997):484-497. -- The present
   article reviews a wide range of GIS related web resources in the
   following five categories: geographic snapshots, spatial database
   catalogs and libraries, map generators, map browsers, and real-time
   maps and images. Each category is succinctly defined and reviews of
   individual sites include title, URL, and a brief summary of the
   services provided. Overall, the reviewed sites constitute a
   representative sample of geographic information available on the web.

   Gould, Cheryl. Searching Smart on the World Wide Web: Tools and
   Techniques for Getting Quality Results. Berkeley, California: Library
   Solutions Press, 1998. -- Number 8 in Library Solutions Press Internet
   Workshop series, this guide like the others in this series, is
   designed as both a practical workbook for individuals as well as a
   training model to be used by teachers. In this case, Cheryl Gould
   takes on web searching. But it's more than about how to find stuff on
   the web, it's about how to be a conscious evaluator of the web sites
   and how to be "information literate." Taking a wholistic approach,
   Gould's philosophy is that searching the web intelligently is not
   necessarily a sequential process but requires knowledge of many
   concepts that do not necessarily build upon each other. Each of the
   eight chapters takes on a different concept -- from a first chapter
   that gives an overview of what the Web is to later chapters on the
   different types of search tools, how search tools work and how to
   assess the quality of your results; depending on your level of web
   savviness, you can start from the very beginning or skip around as
   necessary. Each chapter includes exercises liked a guided online
   excursion through Yahoo! or a mini-quiz that tests your understanding
   of Boolean Logic or a worksheet to help you better evaluate web pages.
   Included in the workbook is a disk that contains Netscape bookmarks
   and Internet Explorer favorites for sites referred to in the volume.
   Particularly useful in this guide is the appendix which includes a
   grid on that list the search features of the major subject directories
   and search engines. -- MP
   
   Kushigian, Nancy. "Researching Women's Lives and Issues: Contemporary
   Women's Issues and Women 'R'" Database 20(6) (December 1997):19-26. --
   As women's studies programs continue to develop and grow, the activist
   and interdisciplinary nature of women's issues has posed difficult
   challenges for scholarly research in this area. However, the recent
   availability of two CD-ROM (and soon to be online) full-text databases
   is good news for those interested in women's studies. In this feature
   article, Nancy Kushigan provides a thorough review of Responsive
   Database Systems' (RDS) Contemporary Women's Issues (CWI)and Soft Line
   Information's Women 'R'. While Women 'R' receives high marks for its
   more popular focus and coverage of ethnic and minority media, CWI is
   the clear favorite. CWI is recommended for scholarly research as it
   offers a greater range, variety and depth of source materials as well
   as "beautiful" subject cataloging and a thesaurus - all at an
   affordable price. This article also features a nice summary of
   Internet-based resources on women's studies. -- LY

   Lin, Zi-Yu. "How to Use CJK Software to Read Chinese, Japanese and
   Korean on the Web" Computers in Libraries 17(10) (Nov/Dec 1997):50-54.
   -- We all know about language barriers, but some web masters are
   encountering character barriers too. This short article is a primer on
   the linguistics, character encoding and application software involved
   in reading CJK on the web. There are conflicting and competing
   encoding standards, as one might imagine; the explanations here
   provide a useful reference when confronted with ISO-2022-GB, Big5, et
   al. Knowing about them will be important when choosing application
   packages! Four are described: AsiaSurf, Asian Viewer, AsianSuite 97,
   and NJWIN CJK Multilingual Support System Version 1.5 for Windows
   3.1/95/NT. Downloading and use instructions for each one are given in
   sidebars. The author is looking at evaluation versions of shareware,
   but plenty of direction is given for anyone who needs to go further
   with fonts and functions. Some interesting web sites are suggested,
   for the day when your new CJK add-ons are installed and ready to
   pounce on some juicy content. -- JR

   Blumenstyk, Goldie. "Western Governors U. Takes Shape as a New Model
   for Higher Education" Chronicle of Higher Education 64(22) (February
   6, 1998). -- "WGU" has 21 participating colleges and firms in 16
   states (and the U.S. territory of Guam), but California is
   conspicuously absent. This article describes the bare-bones structure
   that has already taken shape, which has a solid funding base, a board
   of directors, and a dream. It sounds like a great idea, but there are
   some hurdles to cross. The biggest is how to obtain financial aid
   under strict federal guidelines. Following fast on funding questions
   is how to keep good fences with member colleges who are themselves
   embroiled a swiftly changing educational marketplace. A surprise
   issue: college administrators worry that W.G.U. will increase pressure
   to invest in technology at a cost to other critical needs, and may
   result in more large, impersonal courses. -- TH
   
   Brand, Stewart. "Freeman Dyson's Brain" Wired 6.02 (February 1998):
   130-177. -- "How would you build a 10,000 year library?" This question
   caught my eye as I scanned Stewart Brand's interview with futurist
   Freeman Dyson. As I began reading with great expectations, this
   interview quickly evolved into an intellectual sparring match between
   Brand (cofounder of Global Business Network and author of The Media
   Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT) and Dyson (renowned for his work in
   quantum electrodynamics). While their discussion focused more on
   historic scientific breakthroughs, biotechnology and cosmic ecology
   than libraries, Dyson does offer thought-provoking ideas such as the
   abolition of the PhD system and the inevitability of returning to a
   village culture. By the end, the most I could extract of Dyson's views
   on the 10,000 year library was an appreciation for long term thinking
   and the need for patience - this article serves as a good exercise in
   both. -- LY
