Electronic Publishing

Laws, Kenneth L. "net.journalism"  Serials Review 18(1-2)
(Spring-Summer 1992):82-84.  The varieties and quantities of
information available on the net, if not already overloading the
user, will soon reach such a great quantity as to thoroughly
overwhelm the net traveler.  This information is of value and so
cannot be abandoned; however, there does not yet exist a well
organized/indexed method of access to the information - finding
what one needs is often hit or miss.  Laws suggests that the 
commercialization of the net will help this by providing services
tailored to users' needs. Information brokers (net journalists)
will cull information from various net sources and sell 
"newspaper-like" (electronic) publications to those interested.
With this sort of development, Laws predicts a division of the
diffuse group of net users into classes- from those who can and
will pay to subscribe to elite groups, on down to the
"impecunious users" who will receive publicly supported
services.  This collation of net information, driven by user
need and the forces of a free market, will, according to Laws'
view, benefit all users, net journalists and authors (who will
receive due royalties). - LR

Dougherty, Richard M. "A 'Factory' for Scholarly Journals"
Chronicle of Higher Education 38(41) (June 17, 1992):B1, B3.  In
this excellent opinion piece, Dougherty shows the distance 
between where libraries are now with respect to journal
publishing, and how far there is yet to travel to make it to the
electronic library.  He recognizes that there is one problem we
all face now - we are unsure what the next step is in the 
process of transformation.  He makes the very interesting and
thoughtful proposal to create the "Universal Journal Factory."
This enterprise would consist of academia taking responsibility
for publishing its scholars works, perhaps by creating a
company-like consortium of several universities.  This would
provide a transition to the electronic, thus avoiding the
"electronic plunge."  Dougherty says, "while we have the
expertise, and we can find the money if we really desire change,
the question remains: Do we have the will to seize the
opportunity?"  Indeed. - LR


Hyper- and Multimedia

Barron, Gary.  "The Role of Optical Technology in Megamedia
Applications" CD-ROM Professional 5(4) (July 1992):36-40.  The
new IBM Illuminated Books and Manuscripts package serves as an
example of a fully integrated megamedia (or "Ultimedia" to quote
IBM) application.  Along with the Knowledge System Platform (a 
PS2 M57 SLC with a 160 MB hard disk, 8 MB of RAM, video and audio
cards and an internal read/write optical disk together with a
Pioneer 8000 laser disc player), the introduction of packages
such as this make the case for stand-alone systems that provide
users with both flexibility and control.  An accompanying sidebar
suggests how the Columbus Project and the Illuminated Books
products lend themselves to adaptation for specific educational
goals. - MT
 
Herther, Nancy K. "The MPC - A Progress Report"  CD-ROM
Professional 5(4) (July 1992):10-11.  An interesting summary of
the progress toward multimedia compatibility, the obstacles new
users will encounter and the hopes for the future of the medium.
Since Microsoft "controls the game and owns virtually all the
marbles," development of independent products will be slowed 
until the MPC (multi-media PC) platform enjoys a broader
installation base. - MT
 
"Roundtable: Making Sense of Multimedia"  BYTE 17(5) (May
1992):107-110.  A brief discussion, moderated by Tom Yager of
BYTE's Multimedia Lab, that asks some key questions about the
future of multimedia computing.  While technical issues are 
touched upon, the most important aspect of the debate centers on
how multimedia will further our ability to communicate 
effectively. - MT
 
Schultz, David A. "The Seventh International Conference and
Exposition on Multimedia and CD-ROM"  CD-ROM Professional 5(4)
(July 1992):53-57.  A critical review of the conference and
exposition held in San Francisco in March 1992, by a systems
engineer who looks carefully at the proceedings.  The conference
theme of Charting The Course provides a focus for some thoughtful
talks on the implications of multimedia in education and the
author chooses his own favorites from the wealth of products
demonstrated at the exposition. - MT

Yager, Tom "Winning Graphics" BYTE 17(6) (June 1992):131-140.  In
the third part of a series on Practical Desktop Video, Yager
explores the benefits of integrating basic graphics into
multimedia presentations.  The excitement of video and audio
presentation can lead us to overlook the importance of well-
constructed graphics as an accompaniment to desktop-produced 
videos.  The capabilities of new software can make even the
least artistic of us ready to produce professional presentations.
A "company information" box follows the article. - MT

American Publishers' statement regarding commercial and fee-
based document delivery, ILL, and copyright. A very informative
article on the background of the AAP statement, the present
copyright regulations, the CONTU guidelines and the problems
for today and the future of ILL and document delivery. - VR

limitations and inherent problems...FTP [is a] primary method
of electronic publication." - VR

Schuyler, Michael "Evil of Fax" Computers in Libraries 12(5) (May
1992):29-30.  In his column, "Systems Librarian and Automation
Review," Schuyler describes the fax as "the wrong technology at
the right time."  The PC is a more effective, more efficient, 
and more economical method to do what the fax does and more.  He
concludes by saying that fax technology has caused the setting
back "of machine retrievable documentation by many years." - VR
 
Sessions, Judith and Hwa Wei Lee, et al. "OhioLINK: Technology

translated into English. - VR 

 

Networks and Networking 
 
Electronic Frontier Foundation  "The Electronic Frontier  
Foundation's Open Platform Proposal" available via 
anonymous ftp from ftp.eff.org in directory pub/EFF/papers 
as open-platform-proposal.  This document describes the 
EFF's proposal to increase the range of telecommunications 
services, expand the market for these services, protect  
first amendment rights and privacy of users, and provide 
wide and low cost access to such services by developing 
the ISDN platform.  ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) 
is a switching technology "which allows low-cost communication 
in data, voice, video, and graphic media over the exiting  
copper telephone network." - DR
 
IEEE Communications Magazine 30(6) (June 1992).  This issue 
contains numerous articles on recent technological and 
administrative developments in the personal communications 
services (PCS) (personal communications network (PCN) in Europe 
version of PCS - industry.  While most of these articles refer 
to person-to-person telephony, these developments apply to 
all wireless data services.  As the industry progresses, we 
will probably see the NREN serving wireless users.  The 
articles include: 
 
o  Adams, Danny E. and Carl R. Frank "WARC Embraces PCN"
While focused on the administrative issues, this article
offers a good explanation of the logistics of the planned
network. 
 
o  Hardy, G. Todd "Personal Communications Services" pp.53-54. 
Hardy provides a quick look at where PCSs fit in the future 
of telecommunications. 
 
o  Lipman, Andrew D. "Leaping from the Barricades" pp.34-36. 
Lipman applauds the FCC for (finally) getting down to 
business and beginning to establish rules for the allocation 
of radio bands for PCSs. 
 
o  Ormerod, John and Alex Butterworth "The Ideal
Communications Service" pp.38-42.  Development of the
personal communications network has moved faster in Europe
than elsewhere, giving the EC a preeminent position in the
industry. 
 
o  Taylor, Jack T. "PCS in the U.S. and Europe" pp.48-50. 
Following up on Ormerod, Taylor explains how Europe's lead 
in developing PCSs has goaded the US into being more 
active. 
 
o  Wimmer, Kurt A. and J. Barclay Jones "Global Development 
of PCS" pp.22-27  Summarizes the developments in various 
countries around the world. - DR

Sinha, Alok "Client Server Computing" Communications of the ACM 
35(7) (July 1992):77-98.  This article opens with a detailed 
description of the client-server model and can provide a good 
introduction to some of the benefits of distributed computing. 
On the down side, the article gets fairly technical and is 
focused on the LAN environment, though much of the same issues 
apply in the WAN environment. - DR

takes the NREN another step further, asking for funding(!) for 
specific projects, such as access for K-12 and health 
care providers.


Optical Disc Technology

Clark, Katie "To Cancel or Not to Cancel (Print Indexes)" CD-ROM
Professional 5(4) (July 1992):126-128. "In these times of
tightening budgets" writes Clark, "libraries are taking a closer
look at duplicate subscriptions, including titles duplicated in
paper and compact disc."  Indeed, the debate is no longer
whether or not to buy CD-ROMs, but whether or not to cancel the
duplicate print index. Clark outlines the issues librarians
should consider before making this decision: license agreements,
coverage, database content, retrieval software, frequency of
updates, user preferences, cost considerations, and space
concerns. - TR

Koren, Judy "Multiuser Access to CD-ROM Drives Without a CD-ROM
LAN" CD-ROM Professional 5(4) (July 1992):59-66.  Koren presents
alternative ways of providing multiuser access to CD-ROMs
mounted on a single workstation without the benefit of a local
area network. Among the configurations described are CD drives
connected directly to a campus network, a PC CD-ROM server
connected to a VAX, and CD drives on a VAX/VMS or SUN/UNIX.
Advantages and disadvantages of each configuration are
discussed. - TR
