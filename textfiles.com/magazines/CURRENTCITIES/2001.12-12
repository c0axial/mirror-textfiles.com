   Education 48(12) (November 11, 2001)
   (http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i12/12a03501.htm). - Our numbers are
   down: fewer students are coming to the library; circulation statistics
   are falling; reserve loans have dropped dramatically. Needless to say,
   electronic resources play an important role in this drama. Students
   are using online databases and e-journals and, of course, Internet
   services like [11]Ask Jeeves and [12]Google. Many library
   administrators, in turn, are citing the explosion of e-resources as an
   excuse to cut funding for print collections and space. On the other
   side of the debate are librarians who value the library as an
   important central space for the academic community. These are the
   librarians who are in involved in building café's and creating ambient
   wood paneled reading alcoves as a means of drawing more students to
   their libraries. Others are bringing computer centers and writing
   centers into the library. The library, it seems, is many things to
   many people: for some it is the intellectual heart of the campus; for
   others it website that provides access to hundreds of licensed
   resources (don't forget to tell these people that not everything is
   online); for others it's a good place to check e-mail; and let's not
   forget the many undergraduates who think of the library a great place
   to flirt and socialize. Can the library of the 21st Century be all
   these things and more? - [13]MP
   
   Deuze, Mark. [14]"Online Journalism: Modelling the First Generation of
   News Media on the World Wide Web." [15]First Monday 6(10) (October 1,
   2001) (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_10/deuze/). - The
   author explores the impact of the Web on a longstanding and proud
   profession. He argues that the Web is an entirely new medium and that
   has had great impact on the consciousness of journalists. He
   specifically focuses on the graphic interface of Web pages, which has
   influenced readers, writers and designers. Web journalism has become
   known as computer-assisted reporting (CAR), and is rapidly emerging as
   a legitimate area of specialization. After charting the past decade of
   "online journalism", which was dominated by an exploration of
   "hyptertexuality", he identifies three strategies that journalists may
   use to enhance the potential of journalism online: annotative
   reporting, open source journalism and hyperadaptive news sites.
   Information professionals will enjoy reading this overview of
   journalism as a profession and the changes the Internet has wrought on
   it. - [16]TH

   Duffy, Daintry. [20]"Why Do Intranets Fail?" [21]Darwin (November
   2001) (http://www.darwinmag.com/read/110101/intranet.html) - A bad
   intranet is worse than no intranet at all because "suboptimal
   intranets can drain corporate coffers," according to usability guru
   Jakob Nielsen, a source for much of the information in this article.
   Not only is there an upfront expenditure for hardware, software and IT
   time, Nielsen says, but there's a significant cost attached to the
   time wasted by employees who are fruitlessly searching for the
   information they need. And this isn't chump change, either. Nielsen
   "estimates that if you multiply the number of people in the world
   using intranets by the number of minutes they're wasting on them each
   day, it's approximately a $1 trillion problem." At the dawn of
   intranet time, these internal sites were built and maintained by
   "small groups of techies, librarians and knowledge management
   ideologues." But as Web publishing tools proliferated and became easy
   to use, "people throughout the company started cranking out content
   like crazy and posting it willy-nilly." Also, many intranets "became
   the poor stepchildren of their companies' flashy Internet site."
   Common pitfalls of intranet development include insufficient planning,
   ignoring the end user, lack of organization, no one in charge and
   disconnect by higher management. Article includes a sidebar on the
   costs of running an intranet. - [22]SK

   5(6) (December 2001)
   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews5-6.html#faq). - Everyone
   loves images. The web wasn't anything until images came along, then it
   was an overnight success. So how does one find a specific image on the
   web? By using one of a burgeoning number of image-focused search
   engines. These search engines are simply optimized versions of typical
   web indexes, with crawlers that go around sucking down web content and
   indexing it. But with image search engines, they focus on images only,
   and the web page text that may describe them. As information
   professionals, we know that this is a clumsy approach at best, but as
   the author puts it, until more sophisticated methods become available,
   the tools profiled here will "have to suffice." Seven search engines
   are thoroughly tested in this review article, with [25]Google's Image
   Search (http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en) being the highest rated. -

   Monday 6(10) (October 1, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue6_10/hillesund/). - Hillesund
   argues that to chart the fortunes of e-books, it's necessary to study
   the impact of networks and information technology on society. He
   explores "what e-books are" by studying book production processes and
   other features of the print artifact. One key difference is that while
   e-books are often regarded as a single digital object, they are in
   fact "diffuse", ported to different platforms in bits and pieces-a
   characteristic that has unexpected impact on readers and marketing
   plans. Much of his analysis predates recent setbacks for the budding
   e-book industry and its main players, but this article remains a very
   overview. - [29]TH

   DigiNews 5(6) (December 2001)
   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews5-6.html#interview). -
   Digital preserveration is, as anyone with even only a passing interest
   in the topic knows, a headache-inducing problem. Just keeping the bits
   around is a big enough problem, what with formats coming and going
   with a rapidity not seen since the days of eight-track tapes (anyone
   remember the 5 1/4" floppy?). Add to that the problem of moving data
   from one proprietary format (such as WordStar) to another (such as MS
   Word), and you should start watching those with such responsibility
   for suicidal tendencies. Some in the field are convinced that the only
   reasonable solution to such problems is the creation of centralized,
   cooperatively-supported digital repositories charged with preservation
   responsibility. Efforts such as those described in this interview, by
   OCLC and RLG, two of the most significant U.S. cooperative library
   organizations that exist, are essential to such solutions. OCLC is
   taking the lead in the realm of preservation metadata, building on
   previous experience with such efforts as CORC and the Dublin Core. RLG
   is leading the charge in defining the attributes of a digital archive.
   Together, they hope to help libraries come up with some essential
   pieces of the digital preservation puzzle. This interview gives us a
   glimpse into how they are approaching this effort. - [32]RT

   (November/December 2001)
   (http://www.foreignpolicy.com/issue_novdec_2001/lessig.html) -
   Although the Internet was "made in the USA," it's been widely
   acknowledged as a vehicle with the potential to promote information
   sharing and increase cultural understanding worldwide. Alas, says
   Lessig, the so-called "Internet Revolution" is dead. What killed it?
   "A series of new laws and regulations" which, "under the guise of
   protecting private property," are "dismantling the very architecture
   that made the Internet a framework for global innovation." Lessig, in
   this article, explains how "courts and corporations are attempting to
   wall off portions of cyberspace," and examines the undesirable effects
   resulting from this. Examined herein are online music sharing, the
   DMCA, and WIPO's role in ensuring that this balkanization of
   cyberspace becomes more and more of a worldwide phenomenon. - [35]SK

   (http://www.pewinternet.org/releases/release.asp?id=32). - The
   intention of this survey was to gauge the effect of the "dot-com
   meltdown" on average Americans. The short answer is not much. Indeed,
   most look at the event as a "benefit to the online world". Perhaps
   most significant however is the great reluctance of U.S. web surfers
   to pay for content which hitherto they've been getting for free. 17%
   reported being asked to pay for services they previously got for free
   and of that 17%, a mere 12% were willing to foot the bill. The others
   either found alternatives or did without. - [38]LRK
   
   Poe, Marshall. "[39]Note to Self: Print Monograph Dead; Invent New
   Publishing Model." [40]The Journal of Electronic Publishing 7
   (December 2001) (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/07-02/poe.html). -
   Harvard professor Marshall Poe had a problem: academic publishers
   loved his book (one called it "an incredible achievement"), but none
   of them would publish it. Given the economics of scholarly print
   publishing, no one could afford to publish a monograph titled [41]The
   Russian Elite in the Seventeenth Century: A Quantitative Analysis of
   the "Duma Ranks," 1613-1713, which Poe estimates might only be of
   interest to 200 readers in the next two centuries. Remarkably, Poe did
   not give up. Instead, he conducted an informal peer review process
   with experts in the field and made revisions. Next, he fired up
   Microsoft Word and formatted his manuscript as an electronic book.
   Concerned about universal access issues, he then converted it to the
   Adobe Acrobat format. Next, he let specialists know it was available
   by posting a message to the Early Slavic Studies list, and he e-mailed
   it to journals for review. Finally, he investigated print-on-demand
   options, and he talked to librarians about whether the e-book could be
   added to the collection of the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard.
   Poe says that "the old model--big university press, big print run, big
   publicity campaign, big losses--is deader than Elvis." He may be
   right, but, glancing at his [42]home page, I notice that the monograph
   is now "forthcoming from the Finnish Academy of Science." However, if
   this is what it takes to get a scholarly book published, how many
   other faculty members will have the vision, technical skill, and
   determination to follow his lead? It's a pity that research
   universities can't afford to support small, fully subsidized technical
   support units to help faculty members like Poe publish freely
   available e-books and to arrange for print-on-demand production of
   conventional books on a cost-recovery basis. - [43]CB
   
   Rainey, Rebecca Fairley. [44]"Eclipsing the Sunshine of E-Government"
   [45]Online Journalism Review (November 7, 2001)
   (http://ojr.usc.edu/content/story.cfm?request=661) - "Without
   question," says the author of this look at the current issues facing
   e-government, "government leaders have largely embraced the Internet."
   However, she points out, they've run into a number of obstacles that
   are keeping online government from fulfilling its potential. These
   include financial issues (how to pay for e-government in an era of
   shrinking budgets, and whether charging fees is an answer); political
   issues (including a major one involving the FirstGov search engine,
   created through a nonprofit organization backed by Inktomi and Sun
   Microsystems, which forbids advertising on sites that link to it and
   may mean an unfair advantage when the renewal contract comes up for
   bid); and the implications of GovNet, a proposed private network for
   government entities that is separate from the existing Internet. While
   these issues represent significant challenges, e-government has
   achieved a high level of public acceptance, and "both government
   agencies and the public are ready for better Internet services." -

   (December 11, 2001)
   (http://ecommerce.internet.com/how/build/article/0,,10362_938071,00.ht
   ml). - The filling out of forms on the Internet and the frustration
   derived therein is rapidly becoming an almost universally shared
   experience among web users, much like waiting in line at the
   Department of Motor Vehicles. Needless to say, quite a literature has
   developed on how to make these experiences more user-friendly. By far,
   one of the most important factors is, as the author puts it, "the less
   you ask for, the greater the chance of completion". The author brings
   up many other good points. This includes the kind of expertise
   required to write error messages when something isn't correctly filled
   out: "Ideally, the same person who writes the company's groveling
   apologies for major foul-ups should be brought in to edit programmers'
   attempts at error messages, which will rarely hit the right tone." -

   - O'Reilly books become so familiar to web developers that often
   they're referred to simply by the animal appearing on the cover. In
   the case of David Flanagan's book "JavaScript : The Definitive Guide",
   that would be a rhino. The 4th edition of this key tome has just been
   published and the author takes this opportunity to touch on some of
   the changes both to JavaScript and to his book. "Some developers", he
   confesses, "can get by with just a cut-and-paste or cookbook knowledge
   of JavaScript, but in the long run, I think it is worth taking the
   time to learn the language." - [52]LRK
   
   Wiggins, Richard W. [53]"The Effects of September 11 on the Leading
   Search Engine." [54]First Monday 6(10) (October 1, 2001)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_10/wiggins/). - The author
   explores how people turned to the Internet for news and information on
   the day of the apparent terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. He
   showcases how the leading search engine, Google, fared in the days
   following in the eyes of its users. Google uses "search is king" as a
   motto, and has remained a search-focussed site style rather than a
   human-generated "portal" with added interactive features. Yet the days
   that followed the attack saw the pursuit of news and "community"
   dominating the search logs. Google focused on links to breaking news
   and cached news from different sites, essentially steering users to
   primary new sources instead of recreating them. Within days of the
   event, traffic on this section of Google grew vastly. The author
   forecasts that this feature will remain live on Google-pushing it more
   in the direction of a "portal" instead of a metasearch site. - [55]TH
   
   Youngs, Karla. [56]Managing the Digitisation of Library, Archive and

   pamphlet (24 small-format pages) gives a broad overview of managing
   digitization projects. Topics covered include justifying the project,
   selecting materials, scoping the project, planning and managing it,
   and preserving the digital images (OCR is not addressed). As an
   overview of the process, this publication is most relevant to anyone
   who does not require an in-depth knowledge of these topics, or as a
   very beginning foray into these issues for someone who does. The brief
   bibliography points to some essential resources that can provide much
   more detail on these topics. - [58]RT
