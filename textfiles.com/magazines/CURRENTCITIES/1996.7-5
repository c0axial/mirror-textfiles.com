Networks and Networking

James-Catalano, Cynthia N. "The Virtual Wordsmith" 
Internet World 7(6) (June 1996):30-31. -- A descriptive, 
narrative list of more than 25 URL's (mostly Web sites) 
that provides an interesting variety of dictionaries,
encyclopedias and thesauri. -- DR
 
Kalfatovic, Martin R. "Internet Resources in the Visual 
Arts" College & Research Libraries News 57(5) (May 1996): 
289-293. -- The Web's ability to display images means 
that it has attracted many artists, museums and galleries 
to its realm. Among the sites listed in this article are 
indexes and general resources, sites devoted to artists 
and artistic movements (check out !Surrealisme!), online 
exhibitions, museums (the Smithsonian, the Met, the Andy 
Warhol Museum, etc.), and commercial galleries and auction 
houses (find out just how much those fake Jackie-O pearls 
went for at the Sotheby's web site). Also listed are 
definitive e-journals in the art world as well as 
discussion lists, newsgroups, and usenet groups. The list 
is very selective but offers a good representative sample 
of international resources. -- MP

Maddox, Kate. "Masters of the Web" Information Week
[http://techweb.cmp.com/iw] 577 (April 29, 1996): 46-54. 
-- This article is not about technology per se, but about 
technology managers - especially WebMasters. The article 
explains some of the difficulty in integrating newly formed
"WebMaster" positions into the larger enterprise and how 
some companies are doing it. Although written from the 
corporate point of view, many of the same issues overlap 
with educational institutions. -- RR

Pack, Thomas. "Electronic Words: A Word Lover's Guide to
Digital Dictionaries, Thesauri, and Other Cyberplaces"
Database 19(2) (April/May 1996): 25-31. -- Yet another
offering for logophiles. Pack describes the variety of
electronic resources available on consumer online 
systems, the Internet, and CD-ROM. -- TR 

Steinberg, Steve G. "Seek and Ye Shall Find (Maybe)" 
Wired 4(5) (May 1996): 108-114, 172-182. -- To ponder 
the question of how to organize the rapidly growing and 
ever-chaotic Web, is really to explore age-old attempts 
to organize human knowledge. But efforts to classify the 
Web have been developed anyway in the form of search 
engines. An exploration of Yahoo!, Inktomi and Excite 
and a still-under development project at Oracle called 
ConText, illustrated for Steinberg the essential 
conundrum of classification: a catalog (which some may 
consider Yahoo! to be) in which a human being analyzes 
an object of human knowledge (such as a book or, in 
Yahoo!'s case, a Web site), then categorizes it under a 
prescribed classification scheme will always be 
subjective; automated indexing systems (found in various 
forms in Inktomi, Excite and ConText) lack the ability 
to provide context (something that, so far, only humans 
can provide). While Steinberg didn't find an answer to 
the question of how to classify human knowledge (or at 
least how to better organize the Web) he did discover 
that while humans, (i.e. librarians and information 
scientists) may not have figured out how to organize human 
knowledge, neither have the computer scientists. -- MP

Young, Jeffrey R. "'Indecency' on the Internet: Court 
Hearing Stirs Fears of Censorship of Student and College 
Web Pages" Chronicle of Higher Education  XLII(33) 
(April 26, 1996): A21, A25-A26 -- Surely among the first 
of many articles on how the "Decency in Communications" 
rider to the 1996 Telecommunications Act will affect the 
sharing of scholarly and cultural knowledge, both in the 
academic sphere itself, and with the outside world. Among 
the cases cited are a university art museum identified as 
showing potentially "indecent" images of nude greek statues
in their WWW site. Of course more contemporary art and 
discourse will be seen as even more dangerous. Though the 
Internet started largely as a way to freely share scholarly 
information, this component of law poses a serious 
reconsideration of just that use. -- RR
 
Query Based on Image Content [http://wwwqbic.almaden.ibm.com] 
-- This WWW site is a demonstration of a new tool for 
content-based retrieval (searching the images themselves, 
rather than textual meta-data). These tools are almost 
ready for commercial use, and are being demo'd on the 
vendors' WWW sites: Query by Image Content, from IBM 
[http://wwwqbic.almaden.ibm.com] and Visual Information 
Retrieval System, from Virage Inc. [http://www.virage.com]. 
Even the old demo of QBIC (for HTML 2.0 browsers) works
with a surprising degree of accuracy, searching from one 
image for similar images based on color percentage or 
layout. These types of tools have profound implications 
for content provision and research in visual disciplines, 
from Art History and Architecture to Archaeology and 
Paleontology. The fact that they are integrated with the 
Web increases their potential usefulness. -- RR


Optical Disc Technology

Guenette, David R. "Document Imaging, CD-ROM, and CD-R: A
Starting Point" CD-ROM Professional 9(4) (April 1996): 32-
44. -- Guenette begins with the dream of the paperless
office and the concurrent irony of contemporary office
culture: as more documents are digitally generated, we 
continue to produce and handle more paper-based documents 
each year. The answer to this irony may be CD-Recordable 
technology with increasingly affordable scanner devices, 
document imaging systems and OCR technologies combined with 
cheap, networkable high-storage media devices such as CD-ROM 
and CD-R. This article provides a comprehensive overview of 
the document imaging process as well as the important 
questions you need to ask before designing a system. -- TR
