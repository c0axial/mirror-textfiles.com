Electronic Publishing

Corthouts, Jan and Richard Philips. "SGML: A Librarian's 
Perception" The Electronic Library 14(2) (April 1996): 101-110.
-- This article profiles several innovative digital library 
projects, including applications which use SGML for bibliographic 
control (as an alternative to MARC), information access and 
full-text presentation. While the implementation of SGML projects 
can be a complicated and costly venture, with these prototypical 
projects the authors present possible strategies and motivation 
for libraries to invest in "future-proofing" information with 
SGML. -- CJC
 
Harter, Stephen P. and Hak Joon Kim. "Electronic Journals
and Scholarly Communication: A Citation and Reference Study"
(http://www-slis.lib.indiana.edu/PrePrints/harter-asis96midyear.
html) -- This paper was delivered at the ASIS Midyear Conference 
in May 1996. It presents the results of an empirical study that
focused on the impact of the electronic journal in the academic 
community. The stated purposes of the study were to assess 
accuracy and completeness of e-journals, identify the extent to 
which e-journals are cited, identify academic fields of study 
that most often use e-journals, identify e-journals most often 
cited and record and analyze demographic characteristics and 
access problems. As one might expect, along with the detailed 
statistical tables,  there are plenty of links to e-journals 
provided. -- DR

Jacobson, Robert L. "Colleges Urged to Protect Rights in Licensing
Negotiations" Academe Today: This Week's Chronicle (July 5, 1996)
:A5 (http://chronicle.com) -- With publishers now making full-text 
resources available electronically, a re-wording of use contracts 
for scholarly material is needed. Ann Okerson, associate university
librarian at Yale University believes that many universities have 
signed contracts with publishers that are too expensive and 
unreasonably limit use. Some of the things that are being bought 
may well have fallen into the "fair use" arena. She urges academic 
libraries to promote users rights and negotiate with publishers for 
contracts that meet the needs of their patrons. Terms negotiated 
now may serve as precedents for the future availability of 
electronic resources. One way to keep costs down is to form a 
consortium with other institutions and sign group contracts.

Okerson, Ann. "Who Owns Digital Works?" Scientific American 
(http://www.sciam.com) 275(1) (July 1996): 80-84. -- Okerson
introduces readers to developments in copyright and intellectual 
property issues involving digital technology. She draws a brief 
history of copyright, then focuses on the U.S. Federal NII 
([U.S] National Information Infrastructure) committee on 
copyright led by Bruce Nehman. The white paper from that group, 
Okerson argues, covers the interest of copyright and content 
owners, but does not allow for adequate fair use by libraries, 
educators and others. She notes however that this committee has 
since started to work with the public sector to address these 
issues in a second report, being developed and evaluated now, 
called the CONFU (Conference on Fair Use) paper. Ultimately 
without adequate provision for fair use, the Internet will cease 
to be a rich resource of freely available information for 
education and research, and instead will become even more 
restrictive and pricey than print and broadcast media. The 
article includes a short bibliography of reading on the topic.

Networks and Networking

Beaulieu, Micheline and Christine L. Borgman eds. "Current Research
in Online Public Access Systems" JASIS 47(7) (July 1996): 491-492.
 -- This special topic issue of JASIS includes six articles which 
range in focus from user behavior, query models, search and 
retrieval effectiveness and online evaluation methods. Particularly 
interesting is "Cheshire II: Designing a next-generation online 
catalog" by Larson, McDonough, O'Leary, Kuntz and Moon, which 
details a project using an SGML-based probabilistic search engine 
and Z39.50  with a graphical user interface to provide full-text 
and multimedia, as well as bibliographic information. -- CJC

Wilson, David O. "Experts Differ on Security Threat Posed by Java 
Computer Language"  Chronicle of Higher Education 62 (44) (July 
12, 1996): A19-A21. -- Wilson summarizes some of the problems 
that can be caused by over-rambunctious Java applets. These are 
mainly in the "gag" category and flow between friends on 
geek-destruct, but they could be serious for less sophisticated 
Internet users. For example, "poison applets" can trick your PC 
into yielding passwords, or delete data from hard drives; and 
since "nice" applets need substantial access to perform their 
function, it's hard to spot the ones with a bad attitude. Many 
computer scientists see no cause for worry, while others advise 
basic precautions, such as turning Java "off", or accepting 
applets only from known persons. Meanwhile Javasoft (Sun 
Microsystem's Java unit) is busy patching and reworking Java for 
better security. Bottom line: take Dr. Ruth's advice and have a 
nice time, but play it safe with strangers. -- TH


Optical Disc Technology

Bell, Alan E. "Next Generation Compact Discs" Scientific American
(http://www.sciam.com) 275(1) (July 1996): 42-46. -- As the title
suggests, the next generation of CDs has arrived in the form of
yet another acronym to add to the optical disc alphabet soup: DVD,
Digital Versatile Disc. Bell's article provides a general overview
of the new standard which is the result of an unprecedented 
agreement reached late last year among rival groups of 
international companies such as Philips, Sony, Toshiba and 
Time-Warner. The new generation of optical disc reader will play
both existing CDs and DVDs. The DVD specs are quite impressive: it
can store about 14 times more information than current CDs can;
the rate at which the first-generation DVD player plays back data--
11 million bits per second--matches that of a fast 9X CD-ROM 
player, setting a new benchmark for performance. A DVD FAQ is
available at http://www.ima.org/forums/imf/dvd/faq.html. -- TR

Gunshor, Robert L. and Arto V. Nurmikko. "Blue-Laser CD Technology
Scientific American (http://www.sciam.com) 275(1) (July 1996): 48-
51. --  This second article in Scientific American's "The Future
of CD Technology" series is a highly technical discussion of 
blue-laser research. Currently the lasers inside of CD players
utilize infrared light that can read pits in a CD disc no smaller
than a micron in size (roughly 1/50th the diameter of a human 
hair); blue diode lasers can read even smaller pits. For example,
an audio CD could store all nine of Beethoven's symphonies, 
instead of just one. The ramifications for the world of multimedia
are staggering. However, please keep in mind that this research is
still in the preliminary stages, and we won't be seeing the 
results at your local music store any time soon. -- TR

Browning, J. "New Stars for the New Media" Scientific American 
(http://www.sciam.com) 275(1) (July 1996): 31. -- This article 
is a short foray into the effect of new technology on leisure 
time in America. The argument is for the insertion of some 
charisma into the Internet and other new digital media (ala early 
television); however another opportunity is implied as well. The 
article cites studies that show that Americans are spending more 
time with new media, and less with television (the numbers are 
still far from equal, but are changing). In fact, exposure to new 
media creates enhanced criticism of old media content among the 
study group, presenting the other opportunity: for educators and 
scholars to provide a higher ratio of new types of educational 
content than exists in old media. There seems to be a receptive 
audience for it. -- RR
 
"Central Intelligence Agents" The Economist 339 (7970) (June 
15-21, 1996): 76-77. -- In the mud-wrestling match between 
human intellect and virtual agent prototypes, the software is 
usually found wanting. However, for a generally positive review 
of virtual agents research, take a look at this article. 
Scientists are abandoning past efforts to recreate the human
brain, and instead are focussing on smaller and more practical 
goals. Development of virtual agents now falls into two broad 
categories: "rule-based" systems and "collaborative filtering".  
Recent successes include music recommendations ("Firefly") and 
virtual shopping ("Shopbot" and "BargainFinder"). The authors 
include a helpful history of artificial intelligence and its 
gradual evolution from a "scientific" bias towards a more 
pragmatic, engineering approach. -- TH

"Categories for the Description of Works of Art" 
(http://www.ahip.getty.edu/ahip/cdwa/INTRO.HTM) -- This 
document, published by the AITF (Art Information Task 
Force, a joint program of the Getty Information Institute 
and the College Art Association) outlines a very thorough 
conceptual model for describing works of art that can be 
used as a standard or guideline by librarians, database 
developers, museums, publishers, researchers, and anyone 
else who may need to devise or use formal ways to describe 
art objects. The standard is content-based and is not a 
technical standard. It will help art and humanities 
information to be used and exchanged more easily in the 
networked environment, as new systems use the model to 
organize art information thus giving researchers a consistent 
framework, or it is used as a mapping tool between different 
systems for sharing information across systems. Anyone needing 
to organize, use, or exchange art information in any type of 
system, from database to exhibition labels should read this 
standard. The article describes the concepts, goals, and 
history of the categories, as well as provides a complete 
online guide to them. -- RR

Nardi, Bonnie, and O'day, Vicki.  "Intelligent Agents: What We 
Learned at the Library" Libri 46(2) (June 1996). -- The good
news about Nardi and O'day's study of intelligent agents and 
human interaction at the reference desk was cited in last 
month's issue of Current Cites as reported in the Christian 
Science Monitor. The report itself is even better still!  If 
you are interested in a first-class analysis of reference as a 
valuable business skill, don't miss this ground-breaking research. 
(http://www.atg.apple.com/personal/Bonnie_Nardi/default.html") 
Nardi is an anthropologist and Apple Fellow. Apple's Advanced 
Technology Group (http://www.atg.apple.com) set out to study how 
intelligent agents should be designed to mimic reference service. 
In doing so they discovered a world of highly nuanced interpersonal 
and research talent that the current generation of software can't 
touch with a ten foot pole. Intellectually rigorous yet 
entertaining, the authors perform two services for information 
specialists: they demystify how intelligent agents function in 
plain english, and they describe the rich, intellectual process 
of the reference interview. -- TH
