Electronic Publishing


Jacobson, Robert L. "No Copying" Chronicle of Higher 
Education 40(26) (March 10, 1995) A17-A19. -- Soon-to-be 
proposed legislation that will outline "fair use" of 
copyrighted materials in electronic formats is expected 
to favor the concerns of commercial publishers and to 
"protect the marketplace" from unrestrained digital 
copying. Whereas current fair use laws provide for 
exemptions that allow educators to copy portions of books 
and periodicals for non-profit educational uses, the new 
legislation is expected to be much more restrictive. 
Instead of being able to capitalize on new technologies 
that allow increased access to copyrighted materials, 
users may find that electronic media will only be 
accessible by fee. Many academic and library leaders fear 
that this legislation, authored by the Commerce 
Department's Working Group on Intellectual Property, 
could seriously disrupt scholarly communication as they 
now know it. -- MP

Powell, James. "Spinning the World Wide Web: An HTML 
Primer" Database 18(1) (February/March 1995):54-59.
-- A concise article that includes a brief overview 
of the World-Wide Web, a quick description of HyperText 
Markup Language (HTML) and a simple guide to marking up 
a document in HTML. Included in the article are some 
very helpful sidebars describing "HTML Helpers" such as 
converters, editors and tools and their ftp addresses. 
The bulk of the article is a guide to HTML mark-up and 
although it is just a "primer" it is also quite useful 
as a guide for the novice and a quick reference for the 
seasoned HTML editor. -- DR


Vaughan-Nichols, Steven. "Internet Publishing Tools 
Proliferate" Byte 20(3)(March 1995):30.-- This is a brief 
descriptive list of some of the new author/editing tools 
and add-ons that are becoming available for creating 
documents in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and 
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) formats. The 
list includes several HTML add-ons for popular word 
processing programs such as Microsoft Word for Windows 
and for full-blown SGML editing tools such as Electronic 
Book Technologies' DynaText. -- DR


Networks and Networking

Barlow, John Perry. "Is There a There in Cyberspace?" 
Utne Reader 68 (March-April 1995): 50-75. -- The theme 
for this issue, announced on the cover, is "Cyberspace 
vs. Neighborhood". It is not a one-sided battle. The 
editors' opening article is titled simply "Networks are 
*not* communities", and other articles cover the noticeable 
absence of African-Americans online, the monetary obstacles 
to even cursory connectedness for the average citizen, the 
rush to allow the commercial industries to subsidize the NII,
as if they will kindly step aside once it's built to make way 
for all the online museums, town halls, and other groups 
which have little voice in old media, but have found one 
online. Articles swing from grassroots, libertarian calls to 
abandon social networking, to more moderate comparisons of 
the values and advantages between virtual and physical 
communities. -- RR

Gallegos, Bee, Charles E. Kratz, and Victoria J. Spain. 
"Internet Resources for Education" College & Research 
Libraries News 56(3) (March 1995): 153-157. -- This 
month's C&RL News feature on Internet resources by 
discipline focuses on sources in education. Included 
are lists of scholarly discussion lists and electronic 
conferences, usenet groups, electronic journals and 
newsletters, gopher sites and World-Wide Web sites. 
Particularly useful in this article are the references 
at the end to other bibliographies and lists on Internet 
resources in education.  -- MP

"Internet Security" Internet World 6(2)(February 1995):
32-72. -- This sequence of nine articles answers many of 
the questions that new users and experienced alike are 
posing about Internet security. While the articles focus 
on the importance of securing transactions for business 
use of the net, such as for credit card purchases, other 
articles also explain the current and future security of 
longstanding Internet activities including email. Richard 
Wiggins "Business Browser" (pp.52-58) is especially 
informative in its coverage of the development of secure
World-Wide Web servers and clients. -- JLO

Jacobsen, Kristin. "Time to put the Internet in 
Perspective" College & Research Libraries News 56(3) 
(March 1995):144-147. -- A timeline of the history of 
the Internet from its inception as a communication 
network for the Department of Defense in the 1960s to 
the establishment of the NSFNET backbone in the mid-1980s 
to today when the number of hosts on the Internet 
surpasses 4,800,000, this article provides a basic 
historical context for the development of the Internet 
and successfully illustrates the fact that the Internet 
is not the overnight success that mainstream media 
coverage seems to suggest. The bulleted chronology along 
with the selective bibliography should be useful tools 
for individuals giving presentations or training sessions 
on the Internet. -- MP

Reinhardt, Andy. "New Ways to Learn" Byte 20(3) (March 1995): 
50-72. -- This article covers the impact of new technology 
in learning, both in education and the workplace. The three 
areas of technology credited with the most impact are 
networking, multimedia, and mobile computing. The article 
also contains useful sidebars with case studies from NYU, 
Carnegie Mellon, and UCLA. The article is rife with statistics, 
and mentions briefly that in the race of educational 
institutions to utilize new technology as a means of reducing 
overall costs, we should take the time to consider how the
technology is changing our audience as well as the way they 
learn, and not just the tools they learn with. -- RR


Optical Disc Technology

Beiser, Karl. "CD-ROM Report: Evolving Search Interfaces"
Database 18(1) (February/March 1995):88-92. -- Beiser looks
at two new CD-ROM products that successfully employ a 
graphical approach (WinSPIRS and Map'n'Go) and a third 
product that has improved by increasing database coverage 
within a powerful DOS shell (Global Books in Print Plus).
Not only does the extent and quality of the database need
to be evaluated, but the means of gaining efficient access
to that content is also a primary concern. The products 
described make reference tools easier to learn and more 
pleasant to learn, yet without an obvious performance 
penalty. -- TR  



General

"The Computer in the 21st Century". Scientific American 6(1) 
1995 Special Issue. -- This entire issue is dedicated to 
exploring many aspects of computing, from an article on civil 
liberties by Mitch Kapor to one on government & cyberspace by 
Al Gore. Other issues addressed include computers in education, 
technical innovations to watch for, and digital photography. 
Of special interest to librarians and archivists is the short
article on the last page about archiving electronic resources. 
The article mentions that it seems easy enough to print out 
important records for archiving, but what about complex hyper-
media, or the need to invoke involuntary "archiving"? In one 
instance of the latter, the courts were able to stay the 
destruction by the White House of paper records of Iran-Contra 
dealings by invoking archival value, but the Administration did
not hand over any email about the issue, and those records are 
still in litigation. -- RR
