Electronic Publishing

Amiran, Eyal, Elaine Orr and John Unsworth. "Refereed Electronic Journals 
and the Future of Scholarly Publishing." Advances in Library Automation 
and Networking 4 (1991):25-53.  Stressing the need for academic 
institutions to take a leading role in the development and support of 
electronic publishing, the authors approach the subject from several key 
angles ranging from the technological to the philosophical.  The article 
describes the work of organizations (e.g. the Association for Computers in 
the Humanities, the International Standards Organization, to name two) 
who are developing standards for the formatting and citing of electronic 
texts; and other academic organizations (such as the American 
Philosophical Association) who have convened subcommittees to prepare 
bibliographies and other such documents on the electronic texts and 
electronic serials and articles which are of interest.  Included is a lengthy 
and interesting discussion of the medium of e-mail and the powerful role 
the modem has come to hold.  This discussion in particular, puts into 
perspective the need for libraries to provide access to electronically 
published information, and the responsibility each of us has to educate 
ourselves and those around us in the use of technologies which will put us 
on this golden road to virtually unlimited information.  Also included are 
two appendices: one on LISTSERV commands and the other, a list of 
electronic publishers and archives. -- LR

Expert Systems & Artificial Intelligence

Bailey, Charles W., Jr. "Intelligent Library Systems: Artificial Intelligence 
Technology and Library Automation Systems" Advances in Library 
Automation and Networking 4(1991):1-23.  After a brief discussion of the 
nature of intelligence, Mr. Bailey presents several problems which 
presently hinder the development of intelligent systems (e.g. the 
complexity of incorporating semantic and pragmatic capabilities into 
natural language systems). While it is clear that further AI research and 
development is necessary for the creation of truly sophisticated intelligent 
systems, several valuable systems have been built and there exists a 
fruitful ground for application in the field of library science.  Unfortunately 
there are several factors within our field which, according to Mr. Bailey, 
hinder experimentation and development of intelligent systems within the 
library community: a limited pool of expertise; the limitations imposed by 
our chosen development tools; our lack of training in AI; and lastly, 
something he aptly calls "risk aversion." The article ends with an insightful 
look to the future of intelligent systems, detailing areas where 
development is likely to be fruitful and suggesting AI tools and techniques 
which will be of value in such developments.-- LR


Hyper- and Multimedia

Marmion, Dan  "Hypertext/Hypermedia for Libraries" in Advances In 
Library Automation and Networking: A Research Annual.  Volume 4, 1991.  
Greenwich, Conn. : JAI Press, 1991.  A rich overview that condenses a great 
deal of the history and theory of hypertext and hypermedia systems into a 
very readable chapter.  After moving through second-generation 
hypermedia systems, the chapter surveys some current library 
applications, outlines the advantages that hypertext systems offer for 
library patrons and points towards future potential for hypermedia 
applications in libraries. -- MT 

Flanders, Bruce  "Multimedia Programs to Reach an MTV Generation" 
American Libraries 23(2) (February 1992):135-137.  An article directed 
towards the general library audience conveys the author's impressions of 
two IBM multimedia products: Columbus: Encounter, Discovery and Beyond 
and the, perhaps mis-named, Illuminated Books and Manuscripts.  IBM's 
Educational Systems will certainly make a splash with these products 
(expected in June 1992) which need OS/2 (or DOS 4.0) and Micro Channel  
Architecture support provided by a new workstation.  High-end hardware 
requirements aside, IBM seems determined to catch Apple in the 
multimedia arena, although the $2,000 price tag on each title may cause 
some to balk.  The titles in Illuminated Books include Tennyson's Ulysses, 
Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Declaration of Independence, Dr. King's Letters 
From Birmingham Jail and John Neihardt's Black Elk Speaks.  Flanders 
presents a more in-depth view of the products in "IBM's Impressive 
Multimedia Educational Programs"  CD-ROM Librarian 7(1) (January 
1992):32-36. -- MT

Information Transfer

Bove, Tony. "Voyager's Expanded Books" Bay Area Computer Currents 
(February 11-24, 1992):35-36.  Bove gives an enthusiastic description of 
the Mac PowerBooks which, with the Voyager's Expanded Books series, 
allows not only searching features, but also typing annotations in the 
margins of pages and marking pages for quick page access.  Bove implies 
that this type of electronic book is "even better than the real thing," and it 
is inexpensive. -- VR

Networks & Networking

Caplan, Priscilla "Providing Access to Online Information Resources: a Paper 
for Discussion" Posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1.BITNET (March 11, 1992) as 
well as on USMARC-L@MAINE.BITNET and CNIDIR-L@UNMVM.BITNET.  
Responding to MARBI Discussion Papers 49 and 54, Caplan offers a new 
proposal for the categorization of electronic documents.  She suggests at 
least two categories of documents: "electronic data resources" and "online 
systems/services."  The first category would act more like typical 
bibliographic data, whereas the second would need to be described by 
something like the community information format. -- DR

Optical Disc Technologies

Bouley, Raymond J. "The Life and Death of CD-ROM" CD-ROM Librarian 7(1) 
(January 1992):10-17.  Bouley provides an overview of the research into 
the longevity of CD-ROMs.  He discusses the differences between longevity, 
durability, and stress-resistance, as well as the different types of 
accelerated aging test methods.  Since not all the research results are 
available yet, he strongly urges the library community to listen carefully 
for the announcement of these results.  As it now stands, the preferred 
preservation medium in Bouley's estimation is an optical disc composed of 
etched glass substrate coated with gold alloy. -- TR

"CD-ROM Consistent User Interface Guidelines: A Final Report" CD-ROM 
Librarian 7(2) (February 1992):18-29.  This is the final proposal of the CD-
ROM Consistent Interface Committee (CD-CINC), a working group of the 
Special Interest Group on CD-ROM Applications and Technology (SIGCAT). 
This proposal is now being submitted for consideration as an industry-wide 
standard. CD-CINC was formed to investigate what could be done to 
encourage some consistency across user interfaces, particularly with 
respect to functionality and terminology. The proposal's guidelines identify 
thirteen basic user functions, grouped into three areas: top-level, 
operational, and navigational. The proposal also encourages the use of good 
design principles and provides guidelines for developing CD-ROM 
installation procedures. A useful bibliography of related materials is 
appended to the proposal. -- TR

Flanders, Bruce "Protecting the Vulnerable CD-ROM Workstation: Safe 
Computing in an Age of Computer Viruses" CD-ROM Librarian 7(1)  
(January 1992):26-29.  With over 400 known viruses in the MS-DOS 
environment, virus protection has become a matter of increasing 
importance to librarians; CD-ROM workstations that allow users to 
download data to a floppy disk are particularly vulnerable.  Flanders 
evaluates two leading virus protection software packages available-the 
Norton Anti-Virus and Central Point Anti-Virus. -- TR

Stewart, Mary R. "Users, Standards, and Access: In Search of the Standard 
User" CD-ROM Librarian 7(2) (February 1992):10-17.  This article focuses 
on the need for accurate observations of the library user before developing 
a standard user interface for CD-ROMs. Stewart contends that without a 
more complete understanding of the current user, user culture, and 
capabilities, we create or perpetuate our systems and standards around a 
"standard" user, a mythical creature as rare as the "average person" or 
"normal behavior" Stewart challenges library and information professionals 
to become more than armchair or reference desk philosophers,and act as 
anthropological observer of the library user. -- TR
