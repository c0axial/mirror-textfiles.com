Hyper- and Multimedia    
 
Loveria, Greg and Don Kinstler "Multimedia: DVI Arrives."  BYTE IBM  
Special Edition 15(11) (Fall 1990):105-108.  This article discusses  
Digital Video-Interactive (DVI) technology, one of the keys to the  
development of multimedia systems.  Combining sources such as  
audio CD-ROM and video disk images and using data compression  
technologies, DVI is helping multimedia to become less unwieldy in  
terms of hardware, and more versatile in its abilities to produce  
both still and motion video images.  Some interesting applications  
are also mentioned.  
 
Ray, Kenneth and James R. Driscoll "New Directions for  
Microcomputer-based Hypertext Systems."  Database 13(4) (August  
1990):60-64. This article discusses hypertext within the context of  
evolving ideas about information retrieval systems.  Combining the  
potential of hypertext with advanced information retrieval concepts  
like natural language searching, the article describes using the  
SPIRIT software program (developed by computational linguistic  
researchers) to explore a database made up of the NASA Space  
Shuttle reference manual.  The co-evolution of searching techniques  
and new information retrieval pathways like hypertext systems has  
potential to greatly change the way that we approach information. 
 
 
Optical Disc Technologies 
 
Butcher, Karyle S.  "CD-ROM Report:  The rewards and trials of  
networking." Database 13(4) (August 1990):103-105.  This article  
provides a detailed description of a CD-ROM network at Oregon State  
University,featuring Meridian Data's CD Net product.  Not only are  
some of the technical aspects discussed, but the issue of site  
licensing is also considered.  
 
Harvey, David A. "Optical Storage Primer." BYTE IBM Special Edition  
15(11) (Fall 1990):121-230.  As the title suggests, this article  
provides a basic overview of optical storage technology.  The author  
concludes thatwhile it is impossible to predict whether the optical  
disk will replacemagnetic media, it is definitely finding its way  
into a number of computers.  As examples, he cites Tandy and  
Headstart systems with CD-ROM drives as standard equipment and  
IBM's CD-ROM package for its PS/2 line.  
 
Rogers, Michael.  "CD-ROM standardization proposed by government."   
Library Journal 115(19) (November 1, 1990):67-68.  This article  
discusses CD-Rx a standard to facilitate interoperability of CD-ROm  
databases among all operating systems, CD-ROM drives,  
access/retrieval programs, and user interfaces, proposed by the  
Information Handling Committee of the U.S. Intelligence Committee.  
 
"State of the Art: Magnetic vs. Optical."  BYTE 15(2) (November  
1990):272-338.  BYTE devotes an entire section of this issue to  
what it deems one of the hottest debates in the computer industry:  
will optical media replace magnetic media?  Among the ten articles  
comprising this section is David Harvey's "State of the Media," which  
looks at the advantages and disadvantages of each technology and  
explores the possibilities of hybrid technologies combining the good  
points of each. Other articles discuss the newest optical  
technologies on the horizon, including holographic data storage and  
phase change, which merges the capacity of magneto-optical storage  
with a performance better than that of traditional optical storage.  
 
 
Networks and Networking
 
Cisler, Steve "An Essay on the Openness of the Networks, Electronic  
Free Speech, and the Security of Computers."  Online 14(6)(November  
1990):101-104.  One of the hot topics of networking is security and  
privacy, as well as freedom of information.  Cisler, of the Apple  
Computer Library, brings up some of these issues. In addition, he  
describes some of the pioneering work in these areas by Clifford  
Stoll (author of "The Cuckoos Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze  
of Computer Espionage"), the developer of LOTUS 1-2- 3 (Mitch  
Kapor), and others.  Of note is the online discussion at the WELL- 
Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link called the Electronic Frontier Foundation  
(eff@well.sf.ca.us).  
 
Library Perspectives on the NREN : the National Research and  
Education Network / edited by Carol A. Parkhurst.  Chicago : Library  
and Information Technology Association, 1990.  Although the  
legislation to establish the NREN did not pass before Congress  
adjourned, it should be back next session.  In the meantime, libraries  
and librarians can become a more integral part of the planning  
process.  This LITA monograph provides the background information.   
 
Lynch, Clifford A. and Cecilia M. Preston "Internet Access to  
Information Resources." Annual Review of Information Science and  
Technology 25 (1990):263-312.  This article provides a lengthy  
description of the history of networked resources as well as the  
situation today.  Also included are a discussion of standards and  
protocols and a compleat bibliography.
 
Raeder, Aggi W. and Karen L. Andrews "Searching Library Catalogs on  
the Internet: a survey." Database Searcher 6(7)(September 1990):  
16-31. This article describes the advantages and occasional  
frustrations of logging on to remote library catalogs. There are also  
ample instructions for doing so and a survey of accessible catalogs. 
 
 
Expert Systems
 
Page, Mary. "Librarian Ex Machina 4.0."  LITA Newsletter, 11(42) (Fall  
1990):8-10.   For those of us who missed it, this report summarizes  
the papers delivered at the 1990 ALA LITA session titled: Librarian  
Ex Machina 4.0: Planning for Expert Systems. 
 
Penrose, Roger.  The Emperor's New Mind. Oxford University Press,  
1989.  Within this book, two chapters are of particular interest.  
Chapter 1: "Can a Computer have a Mind?" discusses what it would  
mean to say that computers can think. Incorporated with this is a  
necessary discussion of the major philosophical issues behind the  
problem of computer 'intelligence.' Also, chapter 9: "Real Brains and  
Model Brains" discusses the functional nature of real brains and  
suggests a logical similarity to model (computer) brains. Some very  
interesting connections between the two are given especially with  
respect to the idea of "quantum computers."  Read and be amazed.  
 
Stern, David. "Artificial Intelligence Databases: A Survey and  
Comparison." Database 13(4) (August 1990):19-24.  Mr. Stern roots  
out the most useful online databases for searching for AI material.  
Among these are: INSPEC, SUPERTECH, COMPUSCIENCE, COMPENDEX. He  
discusses availability of these databases (some are available via  
DIALOG) as well as giving a relatively detailed description of each  
database, including some hints on searching.  
 
 
Information Transfer 
 
Garcia, Linda.  "Information Exchange: The Impact of Scholarly  
Communication."EDUCOM Review 25(3) (Fall 1990):28-32.  This  
article raises issues concerning  intellectual property rights and  
reviews a study completed by the Office of Technology Assessment  
(OTA) called "Intellectual Property Rights in an Age of Electronics  
and Information."  It suggests that the University environment in  
particular should seriously consider these issues since the  
University is the producer, user, and distributor of information.  We  
are left with the question of "what role do we want the University  
to play in an information age?" 
 
Hart, Michael S. "Project Gutenberg: Access to Electronic Texts."  
Database 13(6) (December 1990):6-9.  Through a particular project,  
Gutenberg, designed to encourage the creation and distribution of  
electronic texts, the author discusses the issues of access to  
electronic texts, benefits, methods, and trends. 
 
Sten, Mark. "Assessing Electronic Image Technology." Computers in  
Libraries 10(9) (October 1990):37-39.  Sten discusses the  
capabilities, advantages and disadvantages of electronic imaging; he  
raises questions regarding the viability of the paperless society, and  
electronic imaging in general:  are the benefits real or imaginary?  
 
Welsch, Erwin K. "Microcomputers and Workstations in Libraries:   
Trends and Opportunities." Computers in Libraries 10(9) (October  
1990):9-14.  Welsch attempts to define "workstation", he gives us a  
little history and functions of the workstation, and asks humanists  
in various institutions to contribute to the definition.  In so doing he  
touches on trends and implications of information access and  
delivery.  
 
 
General
 
Science and Technology Libraries 11(1)(Fall 1990).  Issue devoted to  
electronic information systems in sci-tech Libraries, but the issues  
are relevant for all libraries.  Includes such chapters as: "Electronic  
Delivery of Information via a Campus-Wide Network," "Using the  
Internet to Access CARL and other Electronic Information Systems,"  
and "Re-Inventing the Library"(!)  
 
Desmarais, Norman. "Computers 1, Intelligence 0: Is Automation  
Making Us Lazy and Stupid?"  Computers in Libraries 10(8) (Sept.  
1990):43-45. I don't know, but I'm too lazy and stupid to care. 
 
 
News Bits 
 
Stephens, Mary "ANS Inc. Announcement." Protocol Newsletter 26  
(November 1990):[p.3].  The formation of Advanced Network and  
Services was announced by IBM and MCI in September.  The two  
giants are joining forces with others to create an advanced network  
system that is intended to complement the NREN.  
 
Meckler introduced two new periodicals on networks and networking:  
Research & Education Networking, a monthly newsletter, and  
Research Networking and Information Systems, a journal.  Articles  
in the first issue of the newsletter (October 1990) include an  
interview with Paul Evan Peters, Director of the Coalition for  
Networked Information.
