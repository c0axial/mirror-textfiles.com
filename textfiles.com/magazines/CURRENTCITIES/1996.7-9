   Editor's Note: I am very pleased to announce the availability of a new
   service for Current Cites readers, thanks to our web master Roy
   Tennant. With just a couple easy steps you can now create your own
   "Virtual Issue" of Current Cites based upon your own search words.
   Your virtual issue is constructed of all the citations in the
   500-entry Current Cites database that match your search and is
   displayed to you in one Web document. You may try it at:
   
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/virtualcc
   
   With the creation of this new service, it is also now possible to make
   a link that will automatically create a virtual Current Cites issue on
   a particular topic. To see how this works, go to
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Copyright/ and click on the "Quick
   Bibliography" message. If you wish to do something like this yourself,
   go to the Virtual Issue page, enter the title and search that you
   wish, view the results and verify that it is what you want, and then
   simply copy the link information from your Web browser's "location" or
   "go to" box and paste it into a link tag in your Web document. Then,
   when someone clicks on that link the search will be done automatically
   at that moment for them.
   
   SWISH search software and Perl were used to create this service. If
   you wish to see the Perl script that accesses the SWISH database and
   that creates the Web pages on the fly, it can be viewed at
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CurrentCites/virtual. Questions about
   the service should be directed to Roy Tennant at
   rtennant@library.berkeley.edu.

   Allen, Mike. "Testing Whether Internet Readers Will Pay" The New York
   Times (September 16, 1996): C2. -- Using the experiences of the Wall
   Street Journal Interactive Edition (http://www.wsj.com/) as a model,
   this article poses the question as to whether Internet users are
   willing to pay for access to Web sites and other electronic journals.
   Although 650,000 people registered as readers of the Wall Street
   Journal Interactive Edition during its trial period, only about 10 to
   30 percent stated a willingness to pay for the service. Other online
   news sites such as those from CNN (http://www.cnn.com/), USA Today
   (http://www.usatoday.com/) and the Los Angeles Times
   (http://www.latimes.com/) remain free; charging users for access to
   their services seems to be a goal but users' willingness to pay is
   still being studied. In an interesting twist, Microsoft
   (http://www.microsoft.com/) found one way to finance their electronic
   publication Slate (http://www.slate.com/) was by selling paper
   versions of it for $29.95 which is $10 more than what the online
   version will cost when it starts charging in November. -- MP
   
   Hawkins, Donald T., "Information Metering: Paving the Way for
   Pay-Per-View Information" ONLINE 20(4) (July/August 1996): 36-41. --
   Information metering will allow publishers and information providers
   to increase revenue from their intellectual property in a manner that
   is convenient yet affordable for users. Two companies' similar
   approaches to implementing an information 'pay-per-view' model are
   introduced. Encrypted information is provided at a minimal cost, and
   the user pays for selective decryption. Wave Systems, Inc. relies on
   an information-metering chip, while CD-MAX, Inc.'s metering capability
   comes with the content itself, in the form of software. -- CC
   
   Peek, Robin, editor, "Special Topic Issue: Electronic Publishing"
   Journal of the American Society for Information Science 47(9) (1996)
   -- This special topic issue of JASIS covers many aspects of electronic
   publishing, including the redefinition of the basic concept of
   'document' to include multimedia, multi-use collections of information
   which is demanding information professionals to become
   'cyberliterate.' Other articles include a study of how scholars
   determine the value of digital library collections, a report of the
   trials and successes of the implementation of an electronic journal,
   and articles addressing the special concerns of electronically
   surveying the readership of electronic journals, and the
   organizational and practical design concerns of creating a guide to
   Internet resources. -- CC
   
   Pemberton, Jeff. "An ONLINE Interview with Jeff Crigler at IBM
   infoMarket" ONLINE 20(4) (July/August 1996): 28-34. -- An interview
   with Jeff Crigler discussing IBM's infoMarket plan for metering the
   use of electronic information. The infoMarket scheme creates a
   third-party relationship between publisher and user, facilitating (and
   billing for) the use of material using a non-proprietary, but
   IBM-developed 'cryptolope' technology. A cryptolope is a secure data
   container with prices and usage restrictions built in. The user will
   have the option to buy a digital unlock key or, for a lower price, a
   view-only key. -- CC
   
   Tally, Bill. "History Goes Digital" D-Lib Magazine (September 1996)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september96/09tally.html) -- An interesting
   and anecdotal description of how some teachers are using digital
   library resources in the classroom. Using a couple of teachers as
   examples, Tally describes both the challenges and opportunities that
   digital collections provide teachers to bring history alive. Embedded
   in the article are some tips for digital library developers on how to
   better serve the instructional needs of teachers like those in the
   article. -- RT

   (http://istweb.syr.edu/Project/Faculty/McClure-NSPL96/NSPL96_T.html)
   -- This report updates the 1994 report on Public Libraries and the
   Internet cited in the July 1994 issue of Current Cites. This report
   asserts that since that time there has been a 113% increase in public
   library Internet connectivity and a 119% increase in public libraries
   offering public access to Internet services. On the other hand, nearly
   40% of the public libraries without Internet connections have no plans
   to connect in the next 12 months. For more statistics as well as
   insights into how well or ill public libraries are integrating the
   Internet to their services, check out this report in either its online
   or print form. -- RT
   
   "Internet Resources for the 1996 Election" College & Research
   Libraries News 57(8) (September 1996): 481-486. -- Prepared by the
   ACRL Law and Political Science Section Library Instruction Committee,
   this month's C&RL News article on Internet sources focuses on the 1996
   election. On the national front it appears that only those candidates
   with a "realistic chance of winning" will be allowed to participate in
   the televised presidential debates; this article, however, takes a
   much more inclusive approach and lists Internet sites for many
   political parties including the Communist Party USA
   (http://www.hartford-hwp.com/cp-usa/), the Green Party
   (http://www.greens.org/), the Reform Party
   (http://www.reformparty.org/) along with, of course, official web
   sites for the Democrats (http://www.democrats.org/) and the
   Republicans (http://www.rnc.org/). Already out of date, references
   to individual candidates, the primaries and the two big conventions
   seem anachronistic but the annotations for everything on the list are
   thoughtful and include important information such as the site's
   sponsor and a brief summary of content. Particularly useful in this
   article are references with detailed annotations to news and
   non-partisan voter education sites on the Web such as the Countdown
   '96 Home Page (http://www.comeback.com/countdown/), AllPolitics
   (http://allpolitics.com/), Vote Smart Web (http://www.vote-smart.org/)
   and Voter Information Services (http://world.std.com/~voteinfo/). --

   Jerram, Peter. "Forms Follow Function" Byte 21(9) (September 1996) :
   153-158. -- The promised "paperless office" remains an unrealized
   dream of the information age. However, new software products are
   making it much easier to manage electronic forms, both locally and on
   the World Wide Web. By coupling a crafty administrator with the right
   e-forms software package a company might easily find itself with far
   fewer paper forms to deal with. This article explores three of these
   software products from Paperless Performance
   (http://www.paperless.com/), Symantec's Delrina Group
   (http://www.delrina.com/) and JetForm Corp. (http://www.jetform.com/),
   and optimistically looks at the future of e-forms and the Web. -- DR
   
   "State of the State Reports: Statewide Library Automation,
   Connectivity, and Resource Access Initiatives" Library Hi Tech 14(2-3)
   (1996): 1-348 -- This special double issue of Library Hi-Tech contains
   reports from representatives of 46 states outlining core library
   information technology and electronic library projects developed or
   developing in their states. The states not included are Arkansas,
   Hawaii, Massachusetts and South Carolina. There are two "Featured
   State Examples": "GALILEO: Georgia's Electronic Library"
   (http://www.galileo.peachnet.edu/) and "The Electronic Doorway
   Library Initiative" in New York. This issue also serves as a
   directory, with contact information for each of the contributors. The
   sheer size of the issue and the outline format of the reports make
   this issue more of a reference work than anything else. Although for
   many of us it is interesting to see how other states and institutions
   are grappling with the issues facing all of us; but be aware that
   these articles contain the quick summaries rather than the detailed
   answers. -- DR
   
   "The Total Librarian" Review of Books and Multimedia Supplement, The
   Economist 340 (7983) (September 14, 1996): 12. -- The Economist rates
   Internet search engines to evaluate whether it is possible to
   successfully index the Internet. The authors provide humorous
   critiques (on Yahoo!: "...bringing order to all human knowledge is a
   long-standing Sysyphean folly, but Yahoo! comes close") and also
   evaluate the programming strategies employed by the more successful
   search engines. A new strategy in development would utilize PC-based
   "softbots" that learn about user interests and perform more complex
   textual parsing. What's missing? Any mention whatsoever of the
   authority control, structured fields, and other enhancements one
   expects to find in the information professions. What's the message?
   Lifetime employment for librarians who can sell themselves to Internet
   service providers. -- TH 
   
  OPTICAL DISC TECHNOLOGY
  
   Halfhill, Tom R. "CDs for the Gigabyte Era" Byte 21(10) (October
   1996): 139-144. -- Digital Versatile Disc or Digital VideoDisc (DVD)
   has the potential to revolutionize mass storage for small systems.
   This new format type would take CD-ROM way beyond 650MB to as much as
   17GB per CD-sized disc. This informative article explains the plethora
   of physical formats and the problems that such variety can cause
   (which has apparently pushed back the likelihood of seeing available
   products into 1997), but luckily this variety is limited to how the
   data is physically stored on the disc. There is only one logical
   format, called the Universal Disk Format (UDF), that all forms of DVD
   will support. One possible use of this technology would be to put a
   full-length feature movie on a disc along with a computer game or
   education software based on it on the same disc. Definitely a
   technology to watch, as many in the music and movie industry are
   already doing. -- RT 
   
  GENERAL
  
   "Focus Interview" The Electronic Library 14(3) (June 1996): 225-229.
   -- In this brief but informative interview five librarians
   representing Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Canada and Mexico
   answer questions about library automation. The format is a simple
   question and answer mostly about topics that involve moving to
   automation in a library. For instance, procedures to define specs and
   functionality, the overall cost and staff training are all covered
   during the course of the interview. For anyone that might be looking
   at starting the process toward library automation this interview
   furnishes some good systems information that may save a step or two,
   at the very least it will provide an idea about what is involved. --
