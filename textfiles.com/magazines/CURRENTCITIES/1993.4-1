Beaver, David. "Pushing Beyond Paper"  MacUser 9(1) (January
1993):215-221.  Beaver foresees that "our struggles to give up
paper will seem endearingly backward" as we move into the 90s,
and document servers and electronic document management systems 
become more sophisticated, more affordable, and more
commonplace functions of the future workstation. - VR 
 
Computers in Libraries 12(11) (December 1992) Special issue on
document delivery.  This entire issue is devoted to several 
aspects of electronic document delivery, including copyright 
issues of electronic publishing; the relationship of libraries, 
publishers, and authors in an electronic world; and 
developments and trends of document delivery systems. - VR
 
Welch, Elisa M. "Can You Read This?: OCR Software" MacUser 
9(1) (January 1993):152-184.  Welch provides us with a detailed
comparative study of eight stand-alone optical character
recognition (OCR) software packages for the Mac. Among these 
are OmniPage, WordScan, AccuText, Read-It, and TextPert. The 
business letters her group chose to test included italics, 
bold, underlined words, and other difficult character 
combinations. - VR 
 
Willett, Perry, and Diane Geraci. "Optical Scanning in an
Academic Library" College & Research Libraries News 53(11) 
(December 1992):698-701.  Libraries at SUNY Binghamton, Albany, 
Buffalo, and Stony Brook participated in a project to determine 
whether or not it was feasible for libraries to provide optical 
scanning technology services to their users. Users could either 
scan materials they needed themselves, or ask library staff for
assistance. Project participants concluded that the library
should continue to provide scanning technology services to 
their users. - VR


Networks and Networking

Calcari, Susan. "NSF Network Information Services Awards"  
posted on nis@cerf.net (January 5, 1993).  Calcari describes 
the NSF award of a $12 million grant to three organizations 
(AT&T, General Atomics, and Network Solutions) to launch a 
cooperative project to provide seamless network address 
services (IP numbers, domain name services), white and yellow 
page services, as well as general network information assistance.  
The providers will be free to charge for their services to those 
outside the US research and education arena. - DR

Dern, Daniel P. "Internet Consultants" Internet World 3(9) 
(November/December 1992):12-16.  Dern conducts an e-mail 
roundtable with five network consultants to discuss some of the 
issues facing Internet service providers, users, and potential 
users, with a focus on the last group.  They point out that 
users are now demanding full service from the providers and the 
service providers are responding appropriately.  While many 
potential users may be ignorant of the possibilities and 
potential benefits of Internet access, more and more are 
recognizing its importance and value.  Also included in this 
discussion are some of the commercialization/privatization 
issues facing users and service providers. - DR

--. "Provider Spotlight: PANIX: Bringing the Internet to the 
Big Apple" Internet World 3(9) (November/December 1992):8-11.  
Dern's interview with Alexis Rosen President of New York's first 
public-access Internet provider, PANIX, provides an interesting 
view of an Internet pioneer (yes, there are still some pioneers 
out there!).  Find out what it takes to offer public access 
service and whom to trust to get the work done.  Rosen also 
describes some of the future plans for PANIX' expansion, as well 
as the contingency plan in the case of a common-carrier take-
over.  After the interview Dern has included an excerpt from 
PANIX' sales information as well as the address for the full 
text. - DR

Hinnebusch, Mark. "The Z39.50 EXPLAIN Service" Academic and 
Library Computing 9(10) (November/December 1992):12-14.  
Hinnebusch, "Mr. Z39.50", describes the recent work on the 
development of the Z39.50 implementors on the much desired 
EXPLAIN service.  This service will hopefully have its first 
implementation in the next revision of the standard (Z39.50-
1993).  EXPLAIN will allow a Z39.50 compliant client to query 
a server's EXPLAIN database (using a Type 1 Query) and find out 
crucial information about the use of the server.  EXPLAIN 
database attributes will not only let the client know how to pay 
for a search, but it will also give information that can assist 
the client in optimizing a search. - DR

Loen, Larry. "Hiding data in plain sight: Some Key Questions 
About Cryptography"  EFFector Online 4(5) (January 7, 1993).  
Loen provides a kind "Encryption 101," that originally appeared 
as an FAQ on the USENET group sci.crypt: what is encryption, how 
it works, how it is tested, attacked, who are the players, and 
who are those trying to thwart the system.  This is the first of 
a series on encryption that will appear in EFFector Online. - DR

The National Research and Education Network Program: A Report to 
Congress / submitted by the Director, Office of Science and 
Technology Policy.  Washington, DC (20506): The Office, December 
1992.  57 p.  [The report is available from the National 
Coordination Office for High Performance Computing and 
Communications, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 38-A, Room B1N30, 
Bethesda, MD 20894, 301-402-4100.]  This report, required by the 
first NREN legislation, describes the government's proposal for 
the actual implementation of the legislation.  The report 
addresses six major issues: funding of the Network and its 
continued development; the future operation and evolution of the 
Network; how commercial services can pay for usage of the Network 
and how users can be charged for such services; technical issues 
of allowing commercial use of the Network and its component 
networks; protection of copyright; and privacy and security. 
Included here are descriptions and charges (i.e., 
responsibilities) of the myriad groups, committees, and 
consortia that constitute the organizational structure of the 
Network.  Clearly this is an important document in the 
development of the NREN. - DR

Nickerson, Gord. "World Wide Web: Hypertext from CERN" Computers 
in Libraries 12(11) (December 1992):75-77.  Without going into 
too much detail, Nickerson provides a view of the underside of 
the operations of the World Wide Web (WWW).  Readers learn how a 
networked hypertext link works and the relationship between the 
HyperText Transfer Protocol, the HyperText Markup Language and 
other developing standards such as SGML, Z39.50 and MIME. - DR

Pengelly, Vicki L. and Barry N. Brown. "'King Kong Versus 
Godzilla': A Team Approach to Training on Internet Resources"
Proceedings of the ACM SIGUCCS User Services Conference XX:
Learning from the Past, Stepping into the Future, 1992, pp.181-
186.  Pengelly and Brown offer an interesting look at their
Internet training program.  The three part course covers WANs,
library catalogs and databases, and computer conferences and
electronic journals.  In this article the authors relate their
experiences teaching the course and include a course outline,
as well as some of the problems that have come up.  For those
planning Internet training, this article should provide some
useful guidance.  The authors themselves are from the computing
center and the library of their campus, respectively, and have 
found this combination to be complimentary.  Beyond this, the 
collaboration on the class has fostered a better relationship 
between the two departments in general. - DR

Smith, Jane D. "Clearinghouse for Networked Information 
Discovery and Retrieval"  posted on PACS-L@UHUPVM1 (January 8, 
1993).  Smith describes the mission of the Clearinghouse for 
Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR).  CNIDR 
will work closely with the Coalition for Networked Information 
and the Internet Engineering Task Force and developers of 
resource discovery tools such as WAIS, Gopher, and WWW to 
provide developers with up-to-date information on standards and 
protocols.  In this way CNIDR hopes to foster better 
interoperability, "compatibility and consistency, and, to the 
extent possible, convergence of the tools." - DR

Smith, Richard J. "Report on Navigating the Internet: An 
Interactive Workshop" posted on NETTRAIN@UBVM and PACS-L@UHUPVM1 
(January 12, 1993).  Smith describes his second online Internet 
course that provided training for 15,000 users and lasted over
seven weeks.  The students were an eclectic group from over 50 
countries and administration of the class became a full-time job 
for Smith.  Plans are in the works for further such training as 
well as a published report on the workshops. - DR

Steele, Shari. "BBS Legislative Watch: Legislation from Last 
Congress that May Affect Your Online Communications" EFFector 
Online 4(1) (December 17, 1992).  Steele provides a round-up of 
recent legislative issues on the electronic frontier.  In this 
issue: Threats to Privacy: FBI's Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted; 
Cellular Scanners Prohibited; Threats to Free Speech: Federal 
Agency to Study Hate Crimes on BBSs; Threats to the Public's 
Right to Government Information: Fees Charged for Use of 
Government BBS; Federal Employees Denied Copyrights for 
Government Software; Reproducing Copyrighted Software Now a 
Felony; Network Access for All: Commercial Users Given Internet 
Access. - DR

Strauss, Howard Jay.  "CWIS: What's in a Name?" Academic and 
Library Computing 9(10) (November/December 1992):14-17.  Strauss 
describes the two most important features of the Campus-Wide 
Information System (CWIS) that will make it successful: that it 
really be campus-wide and that the information be interesting 
(and obviously so).  He makes the point that like a newspaper, 
a CWIS should have something for everybody.  In the interest of 
keeping the mounted information up-to-date and serving a wide 
range of interests, Strauss recommends that the CWIS should be 
administered by the campus public relations office (as the 
library's and computing center's foci would be too narrow). - DR

Tomer, Christinger. "Anonymous FTP Resources" Academic and 
Library Computing 9(10) (November/December 1992):8-12.  Tomer 
presents an analysis of the use of the File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP) at Washington University over a two year period.  In 
addition to a four-fold increase in usage between 1990 and 1991, 
Tomer presents findings on the most popular types of files 
retrieved.  Given the large number of files retrieved per year 
(7.5 million in 1991 from this site), and the fact that the 
large majority of the files are software, Tomer concludes that 
"anonymous FTP servers have materially altered the development 
and distribution of software."  Also included is a description 
of the archie file index system and a helpful sample archie 
session. - DR

General

Communications of the ACM 35(12) (December 1992):26-81.  Special 
section on Information Filtering.  Information filtering is the 
solution to information overload we're all waiting for.  The 
articles presented here cover both the theoretical and practical 
aspects of information filtering and its current development.

o	Baclace, Paul E. "Competitive Agents for Information
Filtering," p.50.  Baclace describes an agent system under
development at Autodesk that literally employs multiple agents
for a user in a competitive fashion.  Each agent is paid, and 
must pay rent to keep its disk space!

o	Belkin, Nicholas J. and W. Bruce Croft. "Information 
Filtering and Information Retrieval: Two Sides of the Same 
Coin?" pp.29-38.  Belkin and Croft analyze information filtering 
and retrieval in parallel in order to discover the relationship 
between the two.  They find that the two operations have much in 
common, so much so, that they encourage researchers in 
information filtering to employ certain findings in IR research.  
They also point out where the two diverge, and must be treated 
differently.

o	Bowen, T. F., et al. "The Datacycle Architecture," pp.71-
81.  Bowen, et al. describe the Datacycle database system that 
provides flexible processing by eschewing indexing.  Datacycle 
accomplishes its processing by filtering a complete copy of the 
database as it is broadcast to a parallel processing system.  The 
database is continuously rebroadcast so that the data is kept up-
to-date.  This method allows for complex Boolean queries as well 
as the creation of fuzzy sets.

o	Foltz, Peter W. and Susan T. Dumais. "Personalized 
Information Delivery: An Analysis of Information Filtering 
Methods," pp.51-60.  Foltz and Dumais describe their research 
into the application of information retrieval methods in n
information filtering.  Working with technical documents (less 
dynamic than news articles) as a sample, they found that Latent 
Semantic Indexing provides the best results.

o	Goldberg, David, et. al. "Using Collaborative Filtering 
to Weave an Information Tapestry," pp.61-70.  Goldberg and 
company describe their information filter designed at the Xerox 
Palo Alto Research Center called Tapestry.  This client/server 
system allows users to select e-mail and other objects through 
preset profiles as well as ad hoc search queries on the server's 
archive using Tapestry Query Language.  The advantage of this 
specific filter is that it allows users to specify in the profile 
or query attributes of an object such as whether or not the 
object has received a response or comment from other readers,  
hence a collaborative approach.

o	Loeb, Shoshana. "Architecting Personalized Delivery of 
Multimedia Information," pp.39-48.  Loeb helps expand the bounds
of information filtering by approaching multi-type objects.  She
also notes that two types of users must be satisfied, the casual
user and the proactive user.  A detailed description of a music
information filter is included as an example of a filter for
primarily non-textual objects.

o	Ram, Ashwin. "Natural Language Understanding for 
Information-Filtering Systems," pp.80-81.  In this sidebar, Ram 
describes, in simple terms and a short example, how natural 
language processing can be used to in information filtering.  He 
describes two systems in use or development now, as well as the 
long term development goals of natural language systems in 
information filtering. 

o	Stadnyk, Irene and Robert Kass. "Modelling Users' 
Interests in Information Filters," pp.49-50.  In a preliminary
study of Usenet News, the authors found that users were able to
describe with some regularity the reason(s) a message was or
was not interesting to them.

o	Stevens, Curt. "Automating the Creation of Information
Filters," p.48.  Stevens describes the INFOSCOPE system which
"employs rule-based agents that recognize a user's usage patterns
and make suggestions based on them." - DR

Computers in Libraries 12(10) (November 1992).  "Special Section: 
Library  Equipment and Furniture," pp.8-34.  The five articles in 
this section cover design and purchase issues for library 
technology and furniture with emphasis on ergonomic concerns as 
well as ADA compliance.  Included here are guides to electronic 
information resources and a directory of vendors and distributors 
of technological devices for the disabled. - DR

Forester, Tom. "Megatrends Or Megamistakes?: What Ever Happened 
to the Information Society?" EFFector Online 4(1-2) (December 17, 
1992).  In this first part Forester looks at the effects or lack 
of effect that information technology (IT) has had on society.  
He finds that despite the dire and utopian predictions, IT has 
not had the transforming effect as predicted.  Forester also 
looks at some of the reasons why the microchip has not made 
humans obsolete or given us endless leisure time.  In the second
part, Forester examines some of the unintended effects of IT, 
including privacy breaches, information overload, electronic 
crimes. - DR

Rogers, Michael. "Mile-High Technology: LITA Does Denver" 
Library Journal 117(18) (November 1, 1992):30-32.  Rogers 
provides an entertaining synopsis of LITA's Third National 
Conference held in September 1992.  "The nexus of all the 
speakers' messages," writes Rogers, "was that the library 
without walls, or virtual library, is no longer a dream but a 
cold, hard fact.  With networking, and especially via Internet, 
there is no piece of recorded information that isn't accessible 
to anyone anywhere at any time." - TR
