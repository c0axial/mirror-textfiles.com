   Basch, Reva. "High AJeevers: Valet-Added Searching from Ask Jeeves"
   Database 22(3) (June/July 1999): 28-34. - As libraries continue to
   struggle with the most effective web interface to Internet and library
   resources, the single, simple search box as online reference desk is a
   tempting model. But who envisioned it would be staffed by a butler?
   P.G. Wodehouse's caricature of a proper British butler is the host of
   Ask Jeeves, a second generation search engine where users are
   encouraged to submit a natural language query in a simple search box.
   In this behind the scenes look at Ask Jeeves, Basch describes how
   Jeeves accepts a natural language query and attempts to match it
   against a list of known questions - about seven million as of early
   1999 - in its knowledge base. Jeeves uses a proprietary parsing
   technology called QPE (Question Processing Engine) that is based on
   both semantic processing (understanding the meaning of words) and
   syntactic processing (understanding parts of speech and how words are
   used in context). Of course, the key element in this process continues
   to be the humans on the six newspaper-style content desks who build
   the knowledge base. Yet even with seven million "answers" Jeeves may
   still send you down a few dark hallways. But it will be interesting to
   see if one day this knowledgeable butler will give new meaning to
   silver platter. - LY
   
   Sheehan, Mark. "Faster, Faster! Broadband Access to the Internet"
   Online 23(4) (July/August, 1999):18-26. Tilley, Scott. "The Need for
   Speed" Communications of the ACM 42(7) (July 1999):23-26
   (http://www.acm.org/pubs/articles/journals/cacm/1999-42-7/p23-tilley/p
   23-tilley.pdf). - Ah, working from home. Whether that means more
   flexibility or just more work, if you're doing it you'll probably want
   the fastest affordable Internet connection. These two articles neatly
   summarize the currently feasible options for increasing your flow:
   56Kbps modems, cable modems, Integrated Services Digital Network
   (ISDN), and Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL). Tilley's article in the
   CACM describes his experiences with fast modems, DSL and cable. It's
   helpful to learn what he had to do himself to get things to work, such
   as running a test on his phone line to see if it could handle higher
   speeds. Sheehan's article in Online is a more systematic overview, and
   includes tables and sidebars which list costs, availability, predicted
   vs. observed downstream and upstream speeds, etc. The sidebar titled
   "Promises, promises" was certainly a cold shower — it details mundane
   problems which can drastically cut speed, e.g. phone wiring too close
   to a dimmer switch, or the distance of your home from the telco's
   central office, or who happens to be using your particular branch of
   the cable system. (Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, there've been
   stories in the local media about disgruntled cable Internet
   subscribers who discovered they were sharing pipelines with
   bandwidth-hog digital video developers). Sheehan also touches upon
   broadband wireless and satellite possibilities. - JR
   
   Coffman, Steve. "The Response to 'Building Earth's Largest Library'"
   Searcher 7(7) (July/August 1999): 28-32
   (http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/jul/coffman.htm). - In this
   interesting follow-up to his explosive article in the March 1999 issue
   of Searcher (cited in the April 1999 issue of Current Cites), Coffman
   addresses some of the 250-odd responses he received. The response has
   been so dramatic to the idea put forward in his original article that
   Information Today is devoting a day-long track to the idea in the
   November 1999 Internet Librarian Conference they sponsor. For this
   follow-up piece to make any sense to you, you should first be sure
   you've read the original article. Whether you agree with him or not
   (and I do), all librarians need to sit up and take notice. - RT
   
   Gorman, Michael. "Metadata or Cataloging? A False Choice" Journal of
   Internet Cataloging 2(1) 1999: 5-22. - In this thoughtful piece Gorman
   considers the appropriate roles of MARC, AACR2, the Dublin Core, and
   web search engines in making electronic resources more easily
   discoverable. He ends with the assertion that we are not faced with a
   dichotomy, but with an opportunity, and he proposes using the
   four-pronged approach to resource discovery: 1) full MARC cataloging,
   2) enriched Dublin Core records (what is also called the
   "structuralist" approach), 3) minimal Dublin Core records (the
   "minimalist" approach), and 4) full-text keyword searching via web
   search engines. Those resources deemed the most valuable would get the
   full-MARC/AACR2 treatment, while others would get progressively less
   attention until reaching the mass of unselected resources available
   through web search engines. - RT
   
   Green, Ann, JoAnn Dionne, and Martin Dennis. Preserving the Whole: A
   Two-Track Approach to Rescuing Social Science Data and Metadata,
   Washington: Digital Library Federation, June 1999.
   (http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub83/pub83.pdf). - This second
   publication from the Digital Library Federation focuses on how to
   rescue statistical data from outdated formats and/or systems. This
   process, called _migration_ by those knowledgeable about digital
   preservation matters, is complicated and not-often attempted (yet).
   Thus this early report from the front lines of preservation is all the
   more important. The two-track approach is necessary since not only the
   data must be rescued, but also the metadata or descriptions of the
   data, and each requires a different process. - RT
   
   Phillips, Margaret E. "Ensuring Long-Term Access to Online
   Publications" JEP: The Journal of Electronic Publishing 4(4) (June
   1999) (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/04-04/phillips.html). - The
   problem of retaining access to digital material that may exist in only
   one location -- and in the hands of a commercial enterprise that may
   go bankrupt any day -- is enough to keep just about any librarian
   awake at night. But if the National Library of Australia has their
   way, librarians in Australia my soon be sleeping a bit sounder. From
   the NLA viewpoint, there are two distinct processes: archiving
   (collecting the material to be preserved), and preservation (keeping
   the material accessible as technology changes). Since it is still
   anyone's guess how best to handle the latter problem, this article
   mainly describes how the NLA is dealing with the former issue.
   Phillips discusses the collecting process (including identification of
   material and comprehensive vs. selective collecting), metadata
   management, quality control, access, permanent naming, and costs. - RT
   
   
   "The ROADS Project Exit Strategy - Ensuring the Future of ROADS for
   its Users" ROADS Development Newsletter Issue 9 (July 1999)
   (http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/roads/news/latest/futures/). - Bringing a
   project to a close is never an easy task, but in this case at least,
   it appears that it doesn't have to mean the end of the ROADS. The
   British Electronic Libraries (eLib) Programme is an ambitious
   collection of projects that have sought to advance library technology
   and technique into new areas of digital collections and services. One
   of the more successful projects is the Resource Organization and
   Discovery in Subject-based Services (ROADS) effort to create a set of
   tools for building interoperable subject-based indexes to Internet
   resources. Their software now serves a number of subject indexes well,
   and provides a method by which to query these indexes simultaneously.
   Therefore, the ROADS team is committing to some level of continuing
   support despite the end of eLib funding. To do this, they are using
   the Open Source model that has served so many other software
   development projects well (can you say Linux?). - RT
   
   "Web Search Engines: Precision, Power, and Performance" Online 23(3)
   (May/June 1999): 20-
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OLtocs/OLtocmay4.html). - This
   special section on web search engines covers many different aspects of
   these tools, and provides some handy charts detailing their various
   features. Included are programs you can install on your own server as
   well as the huge indexes that attempt to comprehensively index the
   web. Specific topics include results ranking, natural language
   processing, meta search engines, features and commands, and the future
   of search engine technology. Some of the articles are available online
   at the Online web site. - RT
