Expert Systems    
 
Minasi, Mark.  "More Complex Knowledge Representation."  AI Expert  
(January 1991):15-19. Mr. Minasi offers brief and intelligible  
descriptions of the various methods of knowledge representation  
used in A.I.: semantic nets, object-attribute-values (OAV), frames  
and scripts. 
    
Vizine-Goetz, Diane, Stuart Weibel and William Oskins. "Automating  
Descriptive Cataloging."   Expert Systems in Libraries.  Norwood,  
New Jersey: Ablex Publishing, 1990.  Ch.10, pp.123-134.  In an effort  
to further automate the cataloging process, the folks at OCLC are  
developing a descriptive cataloging expert system.  This chapter  
gives details of the OCLC Automated Title Page Cataloging Project  
and an analysis of the system's performance.  While the project can  
so far claim only a moderate (73%) success rate, the possibility of  
this project developing into a future service from OCLC is quite  
exciting.    
 
Walters, Samuel T.  "Expert Systems and Artificial  Intelligence   in  
Reference."   Expert Systems in Libraries.  Norwood, New Jersey:  
Ablex Publishing, 1990. Ch.3, pp. 24-40.  This chapter offers an  
excellent use and development of expert systems.  Mr. Walters does a  
fine job in explicating the use and value of expert systems in  
reference work.  Additionally, he offers valuable practical advice for  
the development of systems. 
 
 
Information Transfer   
 
Balas, Janet. "Pictures from Space." Computers in Libraries  10(10)  
(November 1990):29-30.  Balas describes the mechanics of  
transferring picture files to a microcomputer via modem using the  
GIF format, a software program.  
 
Busby, Brian. "Pro-Cite in a Special Library." Computers in Libraries   
10(10) (November 1990):44-48.  Busby describes in detail the  
bibliographic information management software, Pro- Cite, and its  
capabilities.  He also relates his experience using Pro-Cite at the  
Information Resources Facility of the University of Wisconsin  
Biotechnology Center.  
 
Edwards, Shirley J. "The TransImage 1000 Handscanner." CD-ROM  
Professional  4(1) (January 1991):54-57.  Edwards, Head, Indexing  
Branch at NAL, reports on a study conducted at NAL using optical  
character recognition (OCR) technology to process bibliographic  
records. She compares time and accuracy using the traditional  
keying of information versus scanning. The result was that keying  
was generally more efficient mainly due to the number of errors  
resulting by scanning.  Edwards leaves us with a hope: "NAL staff has  
identified a scanning system that it believes will meet our  
requirements for speed and accuracy." 
 
Lesk, Michael. "Image Formats for Preservation and Access"  
Information Technology and Libraries  9(4) (December 1990):300- 
308. As the title well describes, this article is about the role of  
digital imagery technology as it relates to preservation efforts and  
access. If this area interests you continue reading through the  
Special Section for more information on the same topic. 
 
Meeks, Brock. "PC Fax: Shaping the Product to Fit the Marketplace."   
Link-Up 7  (5) (September/October 1990):22-23. Meeks does a good  
job describing faxcards capabilities and manufacturers' efforts in  
trying to improve faxcards. 
 
 
Networks and Networking
 
Branscum, Deborah. "Ethics, E-Mail, and the Law: When Legal  ain't  
Necessarily Right."  MacWorld  (March 1991):63-83. Branscum begins  
this article with a two-page story about an e-mail administrator  
who alleges she was fired for protesting her company's monitoring  
of e-mail.  This story brings up numerous issues of privacy and  
property rights in a new arena.  Such issues will continue to be the  
subject of much debate for at least the next decade.    
    
Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc. EFF News .  January 1991-.   The  
Electronic Frontier Foundation is committed to protecting free and  
unfettered access to electronic information as well as protecting  
the privacy of users.  They frequently file amicus briefs on behalf  
of computer users who have been arrested for "hacking."  EFF News is
distributed electronically.    
 
Gier, Sue. "How to Use Electronic Mail and Bulletin Boards    
Effectively."  The Computer Connection, January 1991.  Available  
from the CCNEWS archive (CCNEWS@BITNIC.BITNET).  This guide to  
effective e-mailing starts with a look at which tools are most  
effective for different kinds of communication.  The author then  
gives a detailed description of the etiquette of electronic  
communication.  (We have also included a copy of  
the Unofficial Smilie Dictionary.)  :-) 
 
West, Richard P. and Richard N. Katz. "Implementing the Vision: a  
Framework and Agenda for Investing in Academic Computing."  
EDUCOM Review  25(4):32-37.  West and Katz, who both work  at UC  
Information Systems and Administrative Services, foresee  the  
future of academic information delivery and communication    
becoming increasingly tied to network-based information  
exchange.   Further, they write, "To facilitate this shift, all elements    
of the academic information infrastructure will undergo change."   
Some of their ideas of the future are illustrated here. 
  
    
Optical Disc Technologies
 
Hutchison, Roger. "Benchmark testing of CD-ROM drives."  CD-ROM   
Professional  4(1) (January 1991):31-34. This is the first in a series  
of articles which will compare the results of independent  
performance tests on several of the more common brands of CD-ROM   
drives.  This month's comparison finds the Toshiba XM 3201 out- 
performing the Texel DM 3020.  Part II will compare several portable  
CD-ROM drives; Part III will compare the Sony and Hitachi drives.    
    
Jasco, Peter. "Data transfer capabilities of CD-ROM software: part I."   
CD-ROM Professional  4(1) (January 1991):63-66. This two-part  
study maintains that CD-ROM software designers need to place a   
greater emphasis on more powerful output options for data transfer.   
Currently, very few CD-ROM products offer appropriate facilities for  
formatting the results of a search.  This month's installment  
reviews the scope of output and downloading requirements; the  
March installment will discuss the exchange formats most  
commonly used for importing data. 
 
Morrow, Blaine Victor.  "Do-it-yourself CD-ROM LANs: a review of  
LANTASTIC and CD-CONNECTION."  CD-ROM Librarian  5(10)  
(November 1990):12-24. This article provides highly technical and  
detailed descriptions of two local area network systems for CD- 
ROMs.  Appended to the article is an unofficial listing of CD-ROM  
products that work with both systems and a useful glossary of  
networking terms.    
    
Zink, Steven. "Toward more critical reviewing and analysis of CD- 
ROM user software."  CD-ROM Professional  4(1) (January 1991):16- 
22. This article calls for a more critical and rigorous evaluation of  
user software interfaces not only as a source of evaluation  
information for potential buyers, but also as a means of actively  
influencing manufacturers of library CD-ROM products to devote  
more resources to making user interfaces more intuitive.  The author  
asserts that clumsy user interfaces prevent many current products  
from reaching their true potential.  Congressional Information  
Service's MASTERFILE 2 is used as an example of a product's less- 
than-perfect user interface which was revised in response to  
customer concerns.

Anderson, Charles. "Using Technology: Gain Without Pain?"  Wilson  
Library Bulletin  (January 1991):92-95, 146.  Mr. Anderson raises the  
question, "what is computer literacy and to what degree must  
librarians be computer literate?" His analogy to the automobile is  
quite telling: must we know all about the internal workings of the  
machine merely to drive well?  It appears that, as  with most other  
areas of librarianship, those who really like and show a  talent for  
computers, become the resident experts.  However, as libraries  
become more and more involved with electronic formats and  
systems, the librarian's role as facilitator will require that s/he  
become increasingly more computer literate.    
   
Clarkson, Mark. "An Easier Interface." BYTE  16(2) (February  
1991):277-282. Describes the Information Visualizer technology  
under development by Robetson, Card and Mackinlay at Xerox PARC  
(including illustrations), which is one of the first really new  
approaches to graphical user interfaces I have seen in some time.  
There are a number of technical papers coming out on these  
developments, but this article presents an easily accessible  
overview of the approach, which includes a model of the user  
interface as windows into a series of "rooms" or virtual workspaces,  
which can contain a number of types of moving, three-dimensional  
graphical displays of information. - Clifford Lynch. 
 
Ryan, Bob. "Dynabook revisited with Alan Kay."  BYTE  16(2) (February  
1991):203-208. Alan Kay, who originally envisioned the Dynabook in  
the late 1960s (a sort of portable personal computer/information  
access device) looks backwards, talks about today's computers, and  
looks forward to the 1990s. Includes some very provocative  
discussion about the need to develop intelligent software agents as  
a key component of user interfaces in the 1990s. - Clifford Lynch.
