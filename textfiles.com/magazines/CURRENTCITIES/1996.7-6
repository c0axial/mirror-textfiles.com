Arms, Caroline R. "Historical Collections for the National 
Digital Library: Lessons and Challenges at the Library of 
Congress, Part 2" D-Lib Magazine [http://www.dlib.org/] 
(May 1996). [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may96/loc/05c-arms.html] 
-- This is part two of a piece that we cited in the April issue 
of Current Cites. It is an excellent overview of the challenges 
faced by the Library of Congress in digitizing major collections 
and making them available on the Internet. The insights shared 
in this article are invaluable to anyone involved in similar 
activities. If you read but one article on digital library 
issues this year, make this (both parts, of course) the one.

Brown, John Seely and Paul Duguid. "The Social Life of Documents"
[http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue1/documents/index.html]
First Monday 1(1) [http://www.firstmonday.dk/index.html] 
(May 1996) -- Brown and Duguid offer a redefinition of the 
meaning of "documents", both in history and in cyberspace, 
primarily by expanding the definition of the word to include all 
of the social interaction and "negotiated meaning" a document 
must entail. Audacious, but it works. As an extended metaphor, 
the document enables the authors to connect "virtual communities" 
to the traditions of discourse that have long been part of the 
world of paper technologies (though they move at a much slower 
speed). For example, sociologist Anselm Strauss (much depended on 
here) sees documents as community builders, hence the "social 
world" of the title. They conclude by saying that contemporary 
society focuses on the "commercial life" of documents, but we 
should remember to understand the social uses of documents (and 
the endless margin notes and copies they engender). Clever, 
iconoclastic, and written to challenge our assumptions about 
information exchange in the bitstream, this article invites us 
to reassess our assumptions about ideas, paper, and electrons.

French, Rob. "Where is Publishing Headed?" Adobe Magazine 7(5)
(May/June 1996): 34-39. -- You'd have to be living on the moon 
to miss the fact that the Internet offers both a challenge and 
an opportunity to the publishing world. In this 
thought-provoking article from a magazine on "publishing, design 
and digital media", some interesting facts and figures are cited 
in between quotes from major and minor players in Internet-based 
publishing. -- RT

Gagos, Traianos, with sidebars by Peggy Daub, Ariel Loftus and 
Shannon Zachary. "Scanning the Past: A Modern Approach to 
Ancient Culture" Library Hi Tech 14(1) (1996): 11-22. -- A 
detailed look at University of Michigan's Papyri Digitization
Project (http://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/) including project 
proposal plan, hardware/software used, image capture 
specifications, and intellectual controls. Initiated as a 
preservation project, the digitization of the materials and 
their wider availability has changed collection use policies 
and facilitated research and instruction. Since the beginning 
of the project in 1991, technology has, inevitably, improved 
and become more accessible. Other institutions are now doing 
similar digitization projects, see Duke University's papyrus 
collection (http://odyssey.lib.duke.edu/papyrus/). The Advanced 
Papyrological Information System (APIS) is a planned "virtual 
collection", which will make possible the electronic 
reunification of papyrus fragments not physically located in the 
same repository. The participating institutions are University of 
Michigan, Duke, Columbia, Princeton, Yale and U.C. Berkeley.

Laplante, Mary. "Information Interoperability" Inform (Magazine 
of AIIM, the Association for Information and Image Management) 
10(5) (May 1996): 16-18. -- One of the best concise 
introductions to SGML that I have seen. This article outlines 
the use of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) for 
document management and dissemination by the academic and 
commercial sectors. The benefits of SGML include the ability 
to encode information in such a way that it can be repurposed 
for many uses, thus speeding and economizing many operations, 
all while using an open standard. The role of HTML (certainly 
the most popular implementation of SGML) for document delivery 
(but not storage) is outlined as well. The article is a great 
starting point (make a copy for your Dept. Chair/CIO/Director) 
and a gentle nudge to move to the next step beyond HTML. -- RR

McClung, Patricia A. _Digital Collections Inventory Report_. 
Washington, DC: Council on Library Resources and the Commission 
on Preservation and Access, 1996. -- Any print publication that 
provides an inventory of digital projects is out-of-date upon 
release. But as is mentioned in the foreword, this is a 
"snapshot" of projects existing at the time (February 1996), and 
will provide a historical benchmark at the very least. But it is 
also useful for more than that. Discovering the information 
included in this slim volume online would be difficult if not 
impossible. For each project there is a brief description, 
contact information, and, when available, a Web address. -- RT

Musciano, Chuck & Bill Kennedy. _HTML: The Definitive Guide_. 
Sebastopol: O'Reilly Press [http://www.ora.com] April 1996. 
ISBN: 1-56592-175-5; Order number: 1755. -- "Definitive" might 
be an exaggeration, but this book has excellent coverage of HTML 
commands and extensions (3.0, Netscape, Microsoft). It gives 
"how to" examples and recommends style and structure elements 
that will make your HTML readable by the greatest variety of 
browsers. Covers tables, forms, dynamic documents and other 
advanced topics (though not CGI scripting, which is handled by 
another O'Reilly book, [http://www.ora.com/www/item/cgi_prog.html] 
CGI Programming on the World Wide Web) and other advanced topics. 
Has appendices with quick command reference, the HTML DTD, a list 
of character entities and a color chart. It also includes a handy 
foldout pocket guide to HTML commands. Assumes a working knowledge 
of the Web. -- KC

_Preserving Digital Information: Report of the Task Force on 
Archiving of Digital Information_. Commission on Preservation 
and Access and the Research Libraries Group, May 1, 1996. 
[http://www.rlg.org/ArchTF/] -- Digital preservation is clearly 
one of the most difficult issues that face those who are building 
digital libraries. This report from a Task Force created by the 
Commission on Preservation and Access and the Research Libraries 
Group clearly outlines the issues and enumerates a number of 
actions that must be taken should we care to preserve our digital 
cultural heritage. If you count yourself among that number, the 
first thing to do is to read this report. -- RT

Tennant, Roy. _Practical HTML: A Self-Paced Tutorial_. Internet 
Workshop Series, Number 6. Berkeley: Library Solutions Press, 
[http://www.library-solutions.com/] 1996. ISBN:1-882208-19-6. 
-- Library Solutions Press has issued another in its Internet 
Workshop Series, this one a self-paced tutorial by Current 
Cites own Roy Tennant. (In order to avoid any appearance of 
nepotism, I will try to contain my enthusiasm -- but it may be 
difficult). A practical guide, this workbook is divided into 
two main sections: the first module covers basic HTML such as 
tags for basic structure (head, title, body), general formatting 
(headers, paragraphs, line breaks, etc.) and linking; the second 
introduces some advanced HTML features (image mapping, tables 
and forms). Each module introduces a set of concepts and tags 
followed by an exercise that requires readers to use what they 
have just learned. The value of this workbook is its simplicity 
and its practicality. Roy has been remarkably selective in the 
tags he chooses to teach. Yet, with just a few tags, the reader 
who completes all of the exercises can create an elegant, 
professional quality Web document that incorporates images, links, 
lists, forms and tables. All that is required of the reader is a 
simple text editor and a Web browser; the image files necessary 
to complete the exercises are included in a diskette (both Windows 
and Mac versions) that come with the workbook. Also useful in this 
volume is the quick reference guide at the end which includes a 
glossary and lists of HTML tags ordered both in alphabetical order 
and by function. The Guidelines for Web Document Style and Design 
should be required reading for anyone designing a Web page. -- MP
 
Weibel, Stuart, with sidebar by Judith Pearce. "The Changing 
Landscape of Networked Resource Description" Library Hi Tech 
14(1) (1996): 7-10. -- Wiebel gives an update on the status of 
many projects and standards for resource description including 
the Dublin Core, a set of descriptive elements intended to 
promote self-describing Web documents and provide semantic 
interoperability of documents. A sidebar details the experience 
with the Dublin Core of the National Document and Information 
Service (NDIS) Project (http://www.nla.gov.au/2/NDIS/), a joint 
project of the National Library of Australia and the National
Library of New Zealand. Also, a report from the 34th Internet 
Engineering Task Force with news of advances in the areas of 
HTTP, HTML, URNs and PICS. Of note are OCLC's Persistent 
Uniform Resource Locator (PURL) scheme (http://purl.OCLC.ORG), 
and the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) effort.

Multimedia and Hypermedia

Fenske, David E.  and Jon W. Dunn. "The VARIATIONS Project at 
Indiana University's Music Library" 
[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june96/variations/06fenske.html] 
D-Lib Magazine [http://www.dlib.org/] (June 1996) 
-- While much of this article is focused on description of the 
technical challenges and solutions for delivering high quality 
digitized sound to music listening stations - a feat not to be 
taken lightly and whose success at Indiana is receiving wide 
recognition - it is perhaps the tangential comments that are 
most intriguing. Those interested in multimedia technologies 
will relish the thorough description of challenges in bandwidth 
and the explicit naming of hardware and software solutions. 
Others will turn to the comments suggesting a close link 
between building design and technology deployment or explaining 
that delivering sound is only a relatively small component of 
larger pedagogical and library preservation issues. -- JLO

Frappaolo, Carl. "Moving to Multimedia" Inform (Magazine of 
AIIM, the Association for Information and Image Management) 
10(5) (May 1996): 10-15. -- This article outlines the shift in 
information management from purely text based systems to 
increasingly complex multimedia systems. It proposes that 
multimedia should not be considered for its own sake, or as 
separate from other information, but rather considered an 
extension of the document. The author suggests that multimedia 
should also not be considered secondary, mere dressing for the 
substantive textual information, but as a value-adding data type 
in the document, one which improvements in data management 
systems and compression is making more feasible for common use 
by all who manage and provide access to information. -- RR
 

Networks and Networking

Clark, Kathleen A. "Internet Resources for Agriculture" College 
& Research Libraries News 57(6) (June 1996): 359-363. -- Another 
handy list of Internet resources, this article includes 
government sites, sources for agricultural statistics, weather 
and even a list of sites for clip art and agricultural images 
(see close-up images of plant pests, for instance, at a site 
called Agricultural Images from the National Agriculture Library).

[http://www.ora.com], 1996. (1004 p.) ISBN: 1-56592-148-8; 
Order number: 1488. -- This is the book that tells you how hackers 
might enter your UNIX system and how you can close those entry
points. It covers system basics like backups, account auditing, 
detection, and the UNIX file system design, but also deals with 
the management of security incidents and the related personnel 
issues (not all hacking comes from the outside!). More advanced 
topics include firewalls, secure SUID, and NFS and TCP/IP related 
questions. It has both plain language explanations and full 
technical details with code samples. -- KC

6-10 May 1996, Paris, France" Computer Networks and ISDN Systems 
(May 1996). [http://www5conf.inria.fr/fich_html/paper-sessions.html] 
-- Out of all the many Web conferences that have sprung up in no 
time at all, this is the one that attracts those who are on the 
cutting edge of Web technologies. That's both good and bad. It's 
good because it attracts researchers involved in some very 
innovative projects. It's bad because a number of the resulting 
papers are narrowly focused on complex topics of limited appeal. 
Many of them will result in no detectable influence on the Web.
But others may influence the Web's future course in dramatic ways. 
And in the end there is something here for virtually anyone. -- RT

"Vinton Cerf: Poet-Philosopher of the Net" EDUCOM Review
[http://www.educom.edu/web/pubs/pubHomeFrame.html] 31(32)
(May 1996): 26-41.
[http://www.educom.edu/web/pubs/review/reviewArticles/31336.html]
-- In the kind of short summary style that characterizes many of 
EDUCOM Reviews pieces, this interview with Vinton Cerf 
(co-developer of TCP/IP, ex-Stanford faculty member, current 
president of data architecture for MCI) covers a lot of ground 
in few pages. Readers are treated to a concise personal history 
of the Internet as well as to Cerf's departure from some Net 
conventional wisdom as, for example, he downplays the threat of 
over-commercialization and reveals his skepticism about the 
complete convergence of communication, computer, and network
technologies. -- JLO 

Weiss, Jiri. "The Wiring of Our Children" 
[http://www.hyperstand.com] New Media 6(8) (June 3, 1996): 
36-39. -- By the end of this year, 13,000 California schools 
will be connected to the Internet, in part due to the massive 
"Net Day" volunteer activities. The home of the Silicon Valley 
is not alone however: 40 states and 20 other countries have 
similar plans. Educational use of the Internet has long been 
held as one of the promises of networked information, and this 
article shows that, slowly, it may be happening. Through several 
case studies, the author maps the mostly school-initiated 
educational content available online. -- RR


Optical Disc Technology

Johnson, Doug. "The Evolution of Information Storage" Inform 
(Magazine of AIIM, the Association for Information and Image 
Management) 10(5) (May 1996): 40-42. -- A short tour of the 
history of information storage (text, not oral/multimedia) 
from pictographs to microfilm, ends by spelling out the 
imminent demise of the latest high-capacity storage solution: 
CD-ROMs. The author introduces us to DVD (Digital Video Disc) 
which is really another form of optical CD, but one using a 
different standard for encoding and retrieval (UDF for 
Universal Disk Format, instead of the current ISO 9660) and a 
different hardware technology for the disks themselves. The 
author does not give in to bemoaning the vagaries of digital 
storage, since the benefits for retrieval and repurpose are 
too great, but rather sensibly advises information managers 
now to adhere to standards since that will enable the porting 
of information to new standards as they emerge. -- RR

1st ACM International Conference on Digital Libraries, March 
20-23, 1996, Bethesda, Maryland"  New York: Association for 
Computing Machinery, 1996. -- As with any scientific conference, 
the proceedings are a mixed bag. Some papers will have a very 
limited audience, whereas others will have a much wider appeal. 
In any case, if you are working in the "digital library" area 
(with all its many definitions), then you should check out these 
proceedings.  -- RT

Intelligent Agent: Newsletter on the Use of Interactive Media 
and Technology in Arts and Education. 
[http://www.intelligent-agent.com] 1(2) (May 1996): 8 pgs. 
-- This newsletter, in its second issue, consists of reviews 
of education-oriented WWW sites, CD-ROMs and books. It also 
contains a few longer articles on digital art, wildlife 
conservation activities online, and "virtual economies". At 
this point it's interesting reading, with a slightly 
underground feel (allusions to Gibson novels), but a bit slim. 
That could change if momentum builds and more writers come on 
board; the focus on arts and education technology certainly 
makes this title worth watching. -- RR
 
McNulty, Tom, ed. "Libraries and the Empowerment of Persons with

for people with disabilities. These articles are co-published 
with the journal Information Technology and Disabilities, and are 
available by ftp (ftp://ftpvms.rit.edu/pub/easi/itd_journal/). 
Articles discuss such topics as architectural barriers, adaptive 
technology, enhanced GUI environments employing sound and video,

Nardi, Bonnie A., Vicki O'Day, Edward J. Valauskas. "Put a Good
Librarian, Not Software, in the Driver's Seat" The Christian 
Science Monitor [http://www.csmonitor/com88] (132) (June 4, 
1996): 18. -- Yes, the electronic world is revolutionizing 
information but it still requires human beings (namely 
librarians) to analyze information requests, anticipate 
information needs and weed out false drops, not to mention 
evaluate and judge the reliability of sources. A summary of a 
study conducted of corporate librarians in Silicon Valley, 
this article is a delightful ode to special librarians and 
their demonstrated ability to adjust to the ever-changing 
landscape of electronic resources while at the same time 
understanding their clients' information needs in ways that 
"intelligent software agents" cannot. It seems as if I'm 
starting to read more and more articles like this. Is the 
rest of the world finally starting to get it? Or has the 
American Library Association retained the services of a very 
effective PR firm? -- MP

[http://www.ahip.getty.edu/ahip/home.html] Santa Monica, Calif.: 
Getty Art History Information Program, 1996. ISBN 0-89236-414-9. 
-- This latest publication from the Getty AHIP is comprehensive 
and in-depth. It proposes a broad agenda of topics, which range 
from Knowledge Representation and Image and Multimedia Retrieval 
to New Social and Economic Mechanisms to Encourage Access. The
sections' authors hail from Rutgers to Eastman Kodak and give 
each section thorough consideration. Includes a glossary and 
topical index to the articles. -- RR

"The Information Appliance" BusinessWeek no. 3481 (June 24, 1996) 
-- Readers of BusinessWeek are used to sifting through the 
editors' unremitting excitement about new technology in order to 
get the skinny on what's new and good. Here's another entry worth 
the read, mainly because Robert D. Hof (primary contributor) and 
his colleagues dissect the dueling proto-platforms that are 
currently battling to bring down Microsoft and Intel and put in 
their place new, cheaper gadgets  that more people will buy.  It 
is estimated that by the year 2000, twenty-two percent of all 
Internet-access devices will be machines that are not PCs--so, 
what will they be?  Early (loss?) leaders include Oracle, Acorn 
Computer and IBM's iterations of the network PC; settop TV box 
technology; "diskless" PCs that are reminiscent of NeXt's first 
foray into the market, and personal digital assistants.  There are 
several attending articles in the Special Report that are well 
worth a look; the best are about corporate strategies and 
"intelligent agents".  -- TH
