   Beamish, Rita. "Rescuing Scholars from Obscurity." The New York Times
   (February 18, 1999): D7. - How to get wider distribution of obscure
   dissertations? Answer: the Web (of course). This article profiles
   various enterprises for distributing dissertations including two
   commercial sites, Dissertation.com (http://www.dissertation.com) and
   UMI (http://www.umi.com/). Also profiled is Virginia Polytechnic
   Institute (http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/) which provide free access to
   its dissertations and is pushing other schools to join its Networked
   Library of Digital Dissertations (http://www.ndltd.org/), which they
   hope will become a worldwide clearinghouse of dissertations. - MP

   Distribution: The Social and Economic Implications of the Production,

   Mellon Foundation grant was awarded to UC Berkeley to study the costs
   and benefits of the networked distribution of digital museum
   information for educational use. This study takes advantage of the
   existing collaboration between the seven cultural repositories and
   seven universities that make up the Museum Education Site License
   Project (MESL), and utilizes professionals from the participating MESL
   institutions as well as the communications and collaborative
   structures that MESL established." This is a significant study of the
   issues involved in creating and delivering digital archives of primary
   materials in an online environment. The study concentrates on the MESL
   project, and thus to images and delivery in a campus setting
   primarily, but many of the issues and findings extend well beyond
   that. Of particular interest is attention paid to the end-user and
   demand and use of such databaases. The Executive Summary
   (http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Imaging/Databases/1998mellon/finalreport/
   0-execsummary.html) provides a concise 9 page overview of this very
   detailed study. - RR

   This short piece is a useful summary of the main findings of the full
   report of the same name, published by the Council on Library and
   Information Resources (CLIR) at
   http://www.clir.org/programs/cpa/hybridintro.html in Microsft Word
   and Adobe Acrobat formats. The purpose of this report is to
   disseminate information on this hybrid approach to preserving brittle
   books, and to stimulate further discussion and research into this
   strategy. Topics covered include the characteristics of microfilm both
   as a source for, and end product of, digital conversion, the choice of
   a digital conversion path (film first or scan first), and proposed
   administrative and structural metadata for the page images. - RT
   
   Dale, Robin. "Lossy or Lossless? File Compression Strategies
   Discussion at ALA " RLG DigiNews 3(1) (February 15,
   1999)(http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews3-1.html#technical1)
   . - The American Library Association Midwinter Conference in
   Philadelphia at the end of January 1999, was the site of a discussion
   by six experts about the pros and cons of "lossy" and "lossless"
   compression schemes. Lossless compression schemes can reduce the size
   of a file without losing any of the information contained within it;
   lossless schemes sacrifice some data to achieve greater file size
   savings. The six experts included some of the top people in the field:
   Carl Fleischhauer from the Library of Congress, Louis Sharpe, III of
   Picture Elements Inc., Howard Besser from UC Berkeley, Peter Hirtle
   from Cornell, Joy Paulson of the University of Michigan, and Steven
   Puglia from the National Archives and Records Administration. The
   common theme of the remarks are that "it depends". Given one set of
   circumstances and goals lossless compression is called for (for
   example, for the preservation of digital masters), while lossy
   compression is often perfectly acceptable for other situations (for
   example, for derivative versions to be delivered to the end-user over
   a computer network). Recommended reading for anyone facing file format
   decisions for digital images. - RT
   
   "Digital Libraries: Technological Advances and Social Impacts"
   Computer 32(2) (February 1999). - The focus of this issue of Computer
   is on digital libraries, with six articles including the introductory
   piece (from which the special section derives its name) by Bruce
   Schatz and Hsinchun Chen. Half of the articles are from three of the
   six NSF-funded Digital Library Initiative projects (Cornell, Stanford,
   and UIUC), with additional contributions from those working with the
   JSTOR (journal storage) and New Zealand Digital Library projects.
   Although most of what is described in these articles comes from the
   "big science" end of digital libraries, some useful nuggets for the
   rest of us can be mined. In particular, the JSTOR article -- being
   more focused on production than research -- is useful in terms of the
   technical decisions that were made while mounting a massive archive of
   digital material. - RT
   
   "Digital Library Using Next Generation Internet" IEEE Communications
   Magazine 37(1) (January 1999). - This special focus on digital
   libraries includes six articles from various research perspectives,
   mostly industry (IBM, NEC, etc.), edited by Chung-Sheng Li and Harold
   S. Stone. Although a few of the articles are somewhat cutting-edge
   (such as the one on software agents) and unlikely to be of practical
   use any time soon, others (such as the one focusing on IBM's digital
   library projects and the one on searching the Web) either relate to
   projects in production now or technologies that are on the near
   horizon. All things considered, if you are trying to soak up anything
   related to digital libraries, go for it. Otherwise, take a pass. - RT

   Web Techniques 4(3) (March 1999):63-70
   (http://www.webtechniques.com/features/1999/03/gessner/gessner.shtml).
   - If this were a puff piece about the latest Netscape technology, you
   would not be reading about it here in Current Cites. No, you're
   reading about it here because Gecko is potentially much more. Gecko is
   being developed under the Open Source model via Mozilla.org
   (http://www.mozilla.org/), which means pretty much anyone can help
   work on it, and the benefitd accrue to everyone. A "layout engine" is
   a piece (or many inter-related pieces) of software that can take an
   object instance and any associated files (such as style sheets,
   images, etc.) and render those objects on your screen. At the heart of
   every Web browser is a layout engine, for example. In fact,
   differences between layout engines in different Web browsers cause no
   end of grief for Web authors striving for minute control over the look
   of their Web pages. As a "next-generation" layout engine, Gecko is
   aiming to provide full and native support for HTML and XML, cascading
   style sheets (full CSS1 and partial CSS2), and the Resource
   Description Framework (RDF). Gessner (a Netscape employee) claims that
   when Gecko ships, it will be "the fastest, smallest, most
   standards-compliant HTML layout engine available." We'll see. But
   meanwhile, don't let the little reptile escape your notice. - RT
   
   Greenstein, Daniel. "Publishing Scholarly Information in a Digital
   Millenium" Computers and the Humanities (32) 4 (1998): 253-256. - This
   special issue of Computers and the Humanities features a collection of
   stories based on a variety of commercial and scholarly forays into
   electronic publishing. While these four case studies may not top your
   reading list, Greenstein's preface does provide a good introductory
   synopsis on the risks, rewards and future directions for electronic
   publishing. He also has a call to action for the scholarly community:
   it's time to better articulate requirements (both as consumers and
   producers) with regard to electronic publications. - LY

   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews3-1.html#feature2). -
   Detailed technical descriptions of digital imaging projects are rare,
   which makes this short piece more interesting than it would be if they
   were not. Those libraries, museums, and archives that are setting up
   scanning operations are faced with an array of difficult decisions for
   which there are few guidelines. For anyone in such a position, it can
   be useful to discover what decisions others in similar situations have
   made. This piece describes some of those decisions made by the
   Gttingen University Library, with links to more complete descriptions
   (including, for example, a description of the metadata elements they
   insert into the TIFF file header). Anyone interested in the
   nuts-and-bolts side of digital libraries should take a look at this. -

   Withers, Rob and Jane F. Sharpe. "Incorporating Internet resources
   into bibliographic instruction." College & Research Libraries News 60
   (February 1999): 75-76. - Some practical tips on incorporating the
   Internet into bibliographic instruction: don't try to cover
   everything; instead, identify pertinent topics such as effective
   searching, evaluating resources, or resources in a particular
   discipline; have a back-up plan (the age-old "technical difficulties"
   problem); market your skills to the faculty who may not associate
   Internet training with the library. Teaching the Internet within the
   contraints of the traditional instruction section is a challenge and
   the authors have provided a short, practical checklist of how to do so
   effectively. - MP
