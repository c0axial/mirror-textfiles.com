Expert Systems 
 
Harmon, Kenneth. "Software for Expert Systems." Expert Systems In  
Libraries. Norwood, New Jersey: Ablex Publishing, 1990. Chapter 2,  
pp. 12-23.  After a clear and quick review of the fundamentals of  
expert system architecture, Mr. Harmon summarizes the 3  
techniques of ES development: 1) programming the system in Prolog,  
Lisp or Smalltalk; 2) using an ES environment (basically a large ES  
shell used mostly for large computers) and 3) using one of the many  
PC shells: Expert-Ease, ESP advisor, VP-Expert, etc.  It is this last  
option which is the most feasible for expert system development in  
libraries. 
 
Smith, Karen.  "POINTER: The Microcomputer Reference Program for  
Federal Documents."  Expert Systems In Libraries. Norwood, New  
Jersey: Ablex Publishing, 1990. Chapter 4, pp. 41-50.  This program  
offers its users minimal level reference assistance in federal  
government documents.  Although POINTER has sometimes been  
called an expert system, Ms. Smith explains that it is not.   Despite  
the fact that POINTER does not reason independently (a key feature  
of an expert system) it is likely to be a valuable reference tool -  
especially in settings where Reference Librarians are not always  
available.  Furthermore, through this paper Ms. Smith illustrates,  
though perhaps not intentionally, the differences between  
conventional programming and an expert system. 
 
 
Hyper- and Multimedia 
 
Cisler, Steve.  "Sound Advice: New Uses for Audio on the Macintosh."   
Online 15(2) (March 1991):84-86.  An often-overlooked aspect of  
multimedia technology receives treatment here in the MacMonitor  
column authored by Apple's Librarian Steve Cisler. Several  
sound/audio applications are discussed, opening up the possibilities  
of annotating voice mail, creating audio dictionaries connected to  
the print or online forms and storing audio data in digital form on  
hard disks.  Compression technologies present one obstacle to mass  
storage of sound, but the potential for sound to become a  
manipulable form of data similar to text and graphics presents  
exciting new prospects for audio technologies to begin catching up  
to their print counterparts. 
 
Nairn, John. "The Proposed Disk Description Protocol (DDP) Standard:  
Background and Overview." CD-ROM Professional 4(2) (March  
1991):56-57.  DDP is a proposed standard for the submission of  
multimedia data to CD-ROM disk mastering facilities. While the  
method for submitting text, record and still-image data is fairly  
straight-forward, multimedia data is more complex in its structure.   
As no common format exists, the current process is difficult and  
error-prone, necessitating a standard before the diversity of ad-hoc  
submission methods become too entrenched. 
 
Oberhauser, Otto C. "Multimedia Information Storage and Retrieval  
Using Optical Disk Technology: Potential for Library and Information  
Services" Osterreichisches Institut fur Bibliotheksforschung,  
Dokumentations- und Informationswesen, 1990. Beginning with a  
thorough overview of optical disk technologies, this comprehensive  
monograph surveys applications of multimedia optical disk media in  
Europe, Asia and North America.  The focus is on current projects  
from libraries and museums, but extends also to projects that are  
related to the work of reference librarians in many fields.  The  
well-organized study includes some local projects and provides a  
glimpse of the type of work that these paired technologies make  
possible. 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Flanders, Bruce L. "KICNET: Interlibrary Loan in a Wide-Area Network  
in Kansas" Online 15(2) (March 1991): 55-60.  The Kansas State  
Library system found that creating and managing their own e-mail  
network for interlibrary lending requests was both easier and  
cheaper than using OCLC, phone, fax, or mail (or a combination of  
these modes of communication).  The software they selected,  
cc:Mail, seems to have been a key part of their success.  KICNET  
currently handles an average of 1,600 messages daily for 150  
libraries.  The cost per message is approximately $0.05. 
 
Malkin, G. and A. Marine "FYI on Questions and Answers: Answers to  
Commonly asked 'New Internet User' Questions" Network Working  
Group RFC 1206  (February 1991): 32 p. The goal of this paper is to  
document the most commonly asked questions and answers in the  
Internet.  And that it does.  This document can also be useful to  
those with some Internet experience but want more information.   
Also included are a glossary and list of suggested readings.

Optical Disc Technologies 
 
Jensen, Mary Brandt.  "CD-ROM Licenses: What's in the Fine or Non- 
Existent Print may Surprise You"  CD-ROM Professional 4(2) (March  
1991):13-16. This article provides a concise overview of CD-ROM  
licensing agreements. As most CD-ROM products are licensed rather  
than sold to users, rights and obligations differ quite dramatically  
when compared to the purchase of printed products.  This article  
explores the restrictions associated with control of the disks and  
software, back-up copies and warranties, down-loading, multiple  
user access, and confidentiality.  The author points out that the  
terms in the standard CD-ROM agreement are merely an offer made  
by the producer, and all the terms should be negotiable. 
 
Kesselman, Martin "CD-ROM Trends" Wilson Library Bulletin 65(5)  
(January 1991):84-86.  This article outlines recent trends and  
developments regarding CD-ROM and other optical media.  Among the  
newest optical consumer products, slated for release this  
Christmas, is the Sony Data Discman. The postcard-sized Discman  
includes a 3-inch CD-ROM player, keyboard, and liquid-crystal  
display screen. It also includes a video adapter that allows the data  
to be displayed on a TV screen and an earphone for listening to  
conventional audio CDs. 
 
LaGuardia, Cheryl, et al. "CD-ROM Networking in ARL Academic  
Libraries: a Survey." CD-ROM Professional 4(2) (March 1991):36-39.  
This article presents the results of a survey conducted by UCSB  
Library staff.  While all responding libraries have some CD-ROMs in  
place, ranging from 2-85 workstations, a relatively small number of  
local-area networks were in place, 21 out of 78 responses.   
However, 50 libraries not currently networking CD-ROMs, plan to do  
so by 1992 at the latest. Only five libraries have definitely decided  
against networking: one because of cost considerations, while the  
other four plan to mount databases on their local mainframe instead. 
 
 
General 
 
Pollack, Andrew "Universal Computer Code Due: Rivals Join Forces to  
Design Standard for All Languages"New York Times  140(48,517)  
(February 20, 1991):1, 5.  Twelve companies, including IBM, Apple,  
Microsoft, Sun and Xerox, are joining forces to create a universal  
computer code that will allow computers using any (human) language  
to communicate.  The first release of Unicode should occur this  
spring with a limited set of 27,000 of characters.  Eventually, this  
code system will be able to accommodate any language in existence,  
including those that use ideograms and those that are no longer  
spoken.
