  DIGITAL LIBRARIES
   
   Crane, Gregory. "The Perseus Project and Beyond: How Building a
   Digital Library Challenges the Humanities and Technology" D-Lib
   Magazine (January 1998)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january98/01crane.html). - The Perseus
   Project was one of the earliest large-scale digital library efforts
   to be undertaken. Conceived and created before the explosion of the
   World Wide Web, this ambitious interdisciplinary collection of digital
   materials relating to Ancient Greece has become the project by which
   others measure themselves. In this article the projects founder, Dr.
   Gregory Crane, reflects on the last ten years and describes future
   directions and goals. The article focuses on how the developers of
   Perseus have tried to transcend the constraints of the printed
   document by offering a completely integrated set of tools for the
   navigation and analysis of interrelated texts, objects and scholarly
   writings. Judging by their Web site, I would say that the project has
   succeeded to a large extent. Dr. Crane then goes on to discuss how
   such an effort can be a positive force for the scholarly comminutes
   which they serve. A number of new and innovative careers have been
   built around the project, and it continues to be an active arena for
   the development of a "new generation of humanists". Looking forward to
   the future, Dr. Crane explores ideas for new formats, expansion of the
   project's subject coverage, and how Perseus might be a force for the
   institutionalization of electronic scholarship. - KH
   
   Crawford, Walt. "Paper Persists: Why Physical Library Collections
   Still Matter" Online 22(1) (January 1998)
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/JanOL98/crawford1.html). - For
   many years the library community has benefited from Walt Crawford's
   reality checks. No technophobe, he analyzes information systems for
   the Research Libraries Group. With this Online essay, he addresses an
   audience which may see total digitization as imminent, but he gently
   deflates that notion by citing examples of digital media limitations
   and library usage patterns. He makes a convincing case that, for now
   and the forseeable future, the value of online resources will beto
   enhance and extend library collections. For those administrators and
   others who demand that an argument be put succinctly, he offers the
   simple phrase "and, not or" as a reminder that any good information
   center will combine appropriate technologies, including the printed
   page. - JR

   Selected Resource Guide" Information Technology and Libraries 16(3)
   (September 1997): 126-131
   (http://www.lita.org/ital/1603_klemperer.htm). - An excellent selected
   guide to digital library resources for anyone wanting an overview of
   digital library issues, draft standards, and technologies, as well as
   strategies for staying current in the field (full disclosure: Current
   Cites is mentioned). The sources cited here serve as good background
   Main sections include general resources, bibliographies, retrospective
   conversion and preservation, electronic publication of current
   materials, initiatives to follow, listservs, conferences, journals,
   and workshops. - RT
   
   Lamont, Melissa and G. Ian Bowles. "Advancing the Digital Map
   Library"Information Technology and Libraries 16(3) (September 1997):
   121-124. - This article describes an innovative service wherein Web
   users can select census data for the state of Pennsylvania and have a
   thematic map created to their specifications. The Pennsylvania County
   Mapper allows users to select a data set and a year, then a
   subdivision of the data set, the variable to map, the type of data
   classification, the number of data classes and the color. How this
   service is constructed is discussed in the article, but basically the
   three pieces are static HTML pages for setting up the map, a CGI
   program written in Perl to translate the settings, and a script
   written in Arc Macro Language to interact with ArcInfo, which draws
   the map. This project demonstrates how current technologies can be
   used to create innovative and useful library services. - RT
   
   Lejeune, Lorrie. The Internet Public Library: Before Its Time" JEP:
   The Journal of Electronic Publishing 3(2) (December 1997)
   (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/03-02/IPL.html). - This article
   describes an innovative project to offer public library services to
   the entire Internet. Growing out of a graduate school project, the IPL
   soon took on a life of its own, complete with grant funding, staff,
   and a burgeoning Web site and clientele. It is an interesting story,
   and one that raises questions about how to support projects that serve
   the common good when there is none of the tax structure in place that
   normally supports such efforts. Needless to say, until new funding
   models are created and realized, efforts such as this one may be
   doomed to failure. How we can prevent this from happening is the
   challenge set forth by this article. - RT
   
  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING
   
   Gilpin, Kenneth N. "Concerns About an Aggressive Publishing Giant" New
   York Times (December 29, 1997):C2. - Although buried in the business
   section, this article on the aggressive business practices of Reed
   Elsevier, one of the world's largest publishers of science journals,
   is really more about the nature of scholarly communication and about
   how consolidation among publishers is stifling competition and driving
   up journal prices -- in other words, it's about the "Microsoft-zation"
   of the science publishing industry. With Purdue University at the
   lead, libraries and academic communities may be starting to fight
   back; when Reed Elsevier's president offered to lock in the annual
   increase in the price of 350 online publication to 9.5 percent, Purdue
   University balked and ended up cancelling many of its Elsevier titles.

   the publishing industry, see a letter by Professor Rob Kirby of the UC
   Berkeley mathematics department:

   Rosenblatt, Bill. "Solving the Dilemma of Copyright Protection Online:
   The Digital Object Identifier" JEP: The Journal of Electronic
   Publishing 3(2) (December 1997)
   (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/03-02/doi.html). - Publishers have
   long desired a standard way that individual intellectual objects
   (journal articles, for example) can be uniquely identified without
   using a physical address (which is what a Uniform Resource Locator or
   URL is). Books have International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) that
   perform this role for printed books, but a similar system was needed
   that provides the same service but in a networked environment and for
   a much broader range of material. This article describes the process
   that the publishing community went through, and the outcome of their
   efforts in the form of the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Rosenblatt
   gives us a good start, but I wish he had provided more links to the
   resources that are required to truly understand how these are
   constructed. For example, he repeatedly refers to the Serial Item and
   Contribution Identifier (SICI, more information at
   http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SICI/) as a part of the syntax of the DOI,
   and yet neglects to mention where one can go to figure out how one
   should be constructed. Nonetheless, this article is a useful
   introduction to both the reasons for, and the use of, this object
   identifier. - RT
   
   Schad, Jasper C. "Scientific Societies and Their Journals: Issues of
   Cost and Relevance" The Journal of Academic Librarianship 23(5)
   (September 1997):406-407. - It seems that for-profit publishers are
   not the only ones to blame for the rising cost of journals (see cite
   for Gilpin in this issue). In this perspective piece, Schad questions
   the publishing motives of scholarly societies. For instance, the
   American Chemical Society states that one of its top priorities in
   publishing a journal is to preserve the archival record of research in
   their disciplines. Another spin on this motive might be that journals
   published by scholarly societies are simply a service for scientists'
   quest for tenure, promotion and grants and as such, some of what is
   published in these journals may be of archival use but may not
   necessarily be of use to currently active scholars. Yes, scholarly
   societies should continue to publish journals since journal literature
   is an important part of scholarly communication; journal prices could
   be reduced, however, if they were downsized and were to publish only
   the best of the professions' scholarship. Schad goes on to suggest
   that if scientific societies want to continue to preserve an archival
   record of research in their discipline, they can do so cheaply by
   providing access to this material in electronic form. - MP
   
   Turner, Judith Axler. "Pioneering an Online Newspaper: Lessons from
   the Chronicle" JEP: The Journal of Electronic Publishing 3(2)
   (December 1997) (http://www.press.umich.edu/jep/03-02/chronicle.html).
   - In this piece the editor of the Chronicle of Higher Education
   describes the process and the lessons learned from moving a print
   publication to the Internet. As a pioneer (Academe Today was one of
   the earlier online publications), they learned a lot, and this article
   shares a good deal of that experience in an informative and engaging
   way. What they learned about online user behavior is well worth the
   time it takes to read the article. But then you get to the "missed
   opportunities" section, in which Turner shares her regrets. Now this
   is candid and informative stuff, and not to be missed. Her ending
   section is titled "Pioneers Are the Ones with Arrows in their Backs",
   but because of the lessons learned from pioneers like Turner's outfit,
   those who follow in their footsteps will have a much better
   opportunity to dodge them. - RT
   
  NETWORKS & NETWORKING
   
   Devlin, Brendan. "Conceptual Models for Network Literacy" The
   Electronic Library 15(5) (October 1997):363-368. - Devlin uses
   cognitive science concepts to present a conceptual model for general
   information retrieval and guidelines for when to use the Internet in
   research. The eight step conceptual model can be summarized in four
   phases: (1) identify information in the form of a question, (2)
   classify the type of question (ready reference, known item, subject
   specific, or research), (3) develop asearch strategy and (4) assess
   results. When considering the Internet, Devlin concludes that the
   Internet should only be chosen if the question is unlikely to be
   answered elsewhere, if other sources have proved unsuccesful or if a
   comprehensive source is required. While there is little assessment of
   specific search tools or strategies, this article does provide a
   preliminary framework for the information retrieval process and for
   assessing the Internet as a research resource. - LY
   
   Knight, Lorrie A. "Locating Public Domain Images" College & Research
   Libraries News 59(1) (January 1998):11-13
   (http://www.ala.org/acrl/resjan98.html). - A concise list of public
   domain image collections available on the web, this may be the only
   resource that web developers need consult to find images for
   incorporating into their sites. Listed here are references to thematic
   image collections like the Library ClipArt Collection
   [http://www.netins.net/showcase/meyers/library_clipart/clipart.html],
   government sites like the NASA Photo Gallery
   [http://www.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/index.html] and image archives like
   The Clip Art Connection [http://www.ist.net/clipart/]. When using
   images from these sites, as the author advises, just remember to abide
   by the appropriate rules of copyright. - MP
   
   Press, Larry. "Tracking the Global Diffusion of the Internet"
   Communications of the ACM 40(11) (November 1997):11-17. - So many
   unsubstantiated claims are made about Internet growth and usage, it's
   tempting to simply dismiss all estimates. However, when you need to
   know more than that it's just really really big and really really
   busy, this article names the organizations that are making responsible
   efforts to track and quantify, and gives a URL for each. From veteran
   net-watchers like John Quarterman's Matrix Information and Directory
   Services to the newly formed Cooperative Association for Internet
   Data Analysis, each organization's function and methods are
   described. The article appears in an issue themed "Computational
   Infrastructure: Toward the 21st Century," and there are several
   related pieces which depict the evolving infogrid. - JR
   
   "Special Issue: The Best Library-Related Web Sites" Library HiTech
   15(3-4) (1997) (http://www.pieranpress.com/). - The articles in this
   special issue are from the site managers of the winners of the "Best
   Library-Related Web Sites Contest." If one overlooks the flawed
   contest itself, the articles represent an interesting mix of
   experiences in setting up and managing a diverse range of
   library-related Web sites. Some of these sites are clearly
   well-deserved of their reward, and are setting the standards by which
   others should aspire (for example, the OhioLink site at
   http://www.ohiolink.edu/). Some well-deserved sites are unique in what
   they do and will likely not have many competitors (such as the
   Internet Scout Report at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/scout/report/). They
   all have stories to tell, and you can pick and choose among them to
   find the ones that best meet your needs or pique our interest. - RT
   
  GENERAL
   
   Bronson, Po. "Is the Revolution Over? Report from Ground Zero: Silicon
   Valley" Wired 6.01 (January 1998):99-112. - If you aren't completely
   tired of hearing the Wired digerati proselytize about the ongoing
   digital revolution, you may want to pick up Wired's 5th Anniversary
   issue "The State of the Planet-1998." In particular, Po Bronson's
   journey into Silicon Valley - the epicenter of the new economy - is
   revealing and entertaining. Bronson's stories of knowledge workers in
   the Valley depict the new "total dedication model": no longer to the
   company but to the dream of transforming the world through technology.
   While Bronson is clearly an insider, he doesn't seem to take it all
   too seriously and the result is a generally optimistic, good read. -
