Hyper- and Multimedia

Ford, Patrick "Microsoft's Windows with Multimedia Extensions: Standards, 
Simplicity and Success in Multimedia"  CD-ROM Professional 5(3) (May 
1992):53-55.  Finally the PC world rises to the Apple challenge for 
multimedia!  A discussion of the Multimedia PC specification (MPC), a 
Windows-based standard with Multimedia Extensions software.  Details of 
equipment requirements, services and the standards that afford 
compatibility between devices are briefly noted.  The extensible package, 
insuring device independence and future compatibility through the Media 
Control Interface (MCI), should open the gates for new product development
in the world of Multimedia for the PC. - MT 
 
Beer, Jeffrey "Multimeditation--One Users Thoughts on MPC and the Future 
of Multimedia"  CD-ROM Professional 5(3) (May 1992):8-9.  An ode to the 
future joys of multimedia computing.  Education and entertainment meet  
in some of the commercial products currently available for multimedia 
computing such as Hyperglot's Learn to Speak Spanish, Sierra's Mixed Up 
Mother Goose and Voyagers' Multimedia Beethoven.  These early multimedia 
packages indicate some of the range of possibilities that the future may 
bring to multimedia computing on the PC. - MT 
 
Mann, Mary "Software Unites Multimedia's Pieces"  PC Week 9(16) (April 
20, 1992):95-103.  Multimedia authoring tools are among the first to 
cross the lines between the PC and Apple environments.  This buyer's 
guide discussion (accompanied by a comparison chart on authoring tools) 
indicates the range of multimedia applications for presentations, 
computer-based training (CBT) and other applications. - MT 
 
Sullivan, Kristina B. "Development Center Lets Users Buy Time on 
Multimedia Tools"  PC Week 9(16) (April 20, 1992):32.  Announcing the 
industry-sponsored Graphix Zone in Irvine, California which provides a 
multimedia development site with a variety of tools for users on a per-
hour fee basis.  Other centers are to follow in San Francisco, New York, 
Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and Atlanta. - MT
 
Sullivan, Kristina B. "'Portable Multimedia' Picks Up Steam"  PC Week 
9(16) (April 20, 1992):25.  A number of portable peripherals and 
complete systems promise to aid multimedia presenters in their work away 
from the home office. - MT

 
Information Transfer
 
Finnigan, Georgia "Document Delivery Gets Personal." Online 16(3)
(May 1992):106-108. Finnigan briefly describes online document delivery
systems that are available to and accessible by the individual user.  She
refers to these systems as "personal document delivery systems."  As
convenient as these might be, Finnigan concludes with the caveat that
there are still many unresolved issues with personal document delivery
systems. - VR
 
Valauskas, Edward J. "Information at Your Fingertips: Large Databases and 
the Macintosh" Database 15(2) (April 1992):99-101.  The Library of the 
European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), in Geneva, Switzerland 
is used as an example for demonstrating the viability of "megadatabases" 
which offer access not merely to bibliographic citations of books, 
papers, and reports, but also text, illustration, tables, and "thousands 
of a peculiar relic of the literature of high-energy physics called the 
preprint." - VR 
 
Wolff, Thomas E. "Personal Bibliographic Databases: An Industrial 
Scientist's Perspective" Database 15(2) (April 1992):34-40.  Wolff 
evaluates four bibliographic software packages, Library Master, Notebook 
II, Papyrus, and Pro-Cite, from the perspective of an industrial 
scientist.  Wolff claims that scientists use these personal bibliographic
databases differently in that they are more interested in information 
management rather than "document output management." - VR

Berners-Lee, Tim (et al.) "World-Wide Web: The Information Universe" 
CERN, 1992.  Available via anonymous ftp from nxoc01.cern.ch in directory
pub/www/doc, filename Article_9202.ps and at csuvax1.csu.murdoch.edu.au
in directory pub/library/soft, filename wwwinfo.doc.ps.  These are Post-
Script documents.  This paper provides an overview of the WWW, a hyper-
text document system designed to provide access to documents around the
world, thus creating an organized world-wide web of data and relevant
connections between databases.  The article "describes the aims, data
model, and protocols needed to implement the 'web' and compares them
with various contemporary systems. - DR

Cate, Vincent "Alex - a Global Filesystem" School of Computer Science,
Carnegie Mellon University, 1992.  Available via anonymous ftp from
cs.cmu.edu in directory sp/alex/doc, filename intro.ps, intro.txt and
at csuvax1.csu.murdoch.edu.au in directory pub/library/soft, filename
alexintro.doc, alexintro.doc.ps.  This paper describes the main issues
around implementing a ftp client that makes distributed files, available
for anonymous ftp, appear as though they wee on the user's local machine.
Named after the library at Alexandria, Alex employs a metadata caching
algorithm to store information on the client and retrieving and
updating documents on an as-needed basis only. - DR

Gelartner, David.  Mirror worlds, or, The day software puts the universe 
in a shoebox-- : how it will happen and what it will mean.  New York : 
Oxford University Press, 1991.  This is a semi-popular book that 
describes large-scale distributed information systems and the operating 
systems that will manage them.  It includes a discussion of Gelartner's 
LINDA system, which essentially permits an application to seek out and 
utilize idle cycles on workstations connected to a network to perform 
distributed computation.  The writing style is a bit hard to take at 
times, but this provides an accessible picture of one possible future 
for distributed computing and very large scale information systems built 
on object-oriented techniques. - CL

Kaminer, Noam "USMARC Fields and Data Elements" posted on PACS-L in three 
parts (April 27-28, 1992).  Kaminer's paper demonstrates how one might 
use the standard MARC format to describe an online catalog, thereby 
creating a metacatalog.  Such a catalog of OPACs would be a boon to the
networked searcher.  He also shows where USMARC alone is deficient. - DR

Nickerson, Gord "Networked Resources" Computers in Libraries 12(4)
(April 1992):31-34.  In this column Nickerson explains what the Usenet
system is, how it got its start, and how to get involved. - DR

"R & E N Transcripts" Computers in Libraries 12(4) (April 1992).  These
three articles are edited transcripts from the Research & Education
Networking Conference, March 7-8, 1991.

	McClure, Charles "A User Perspective on Developing Internet
	Services" pp.53-55.  McClure urges us to concern ourselves
	with our users, in terms of interface design, user instruction
	and the way they actually use our services and to expand 
	traditional library services to include electronic resources.

	Peters, Paul Evan "Networked Information Resources and Services:
	Next Steps" pp.46-53.  Peters explains why the networks are so
	exciting, how they developed, and poses some questions about the
	future of networking with a special focus on libraries.

	Tennant, Roy "Network Basics" pp.55-57.  Our own Roy Tennant
	goes through the basics of how networking works, what you
	can do (E-mail, lists, file transfer, and remote login). - DR

Ramirez, Anthony "I.B.M. and 9 Cellular Powers Team Up for Data 
Transfers" New York Times (Western edition) 141(48,944):C1, 7.  This
high-powered consortium announces the start of wireless data transfer
on large scale.  This technology allows for the broadcast of e-mail
and other data files over the cellular phone system.  Although the
service is fairly expensive now, it is expected to decrease in price
in the near future. - DR

Stanton, Deirdre E., comp. "Using Networked Information Resources: a
Bibliography" Murdoch University Library, 1992.  Available via
anonymous ftp from infolib.murdoch.edu.au in directory pub/bib, filename
stanton.bib and in WordPerfect format in filename stanton.bib.wp.  This
updated and expanded version of two earlier compilations, Stanton offers
a useful extensive guide to information on networked information.  The
list on its own is great (and over 100 pages!), but the usefullness is
enhanced by the good organization of the citations (an index is included).
Stanton has also included retrieval instructions for electronic documents.

Optical Disc Technologies

Ensor, Pat.  CD-ROM Research Collections: An Evaluative Guide to 
Bibliographic and Full-Text CD-ROM Databases.  Westport, Connecticut: 
Meckler, 1991.  Ensor provides evaluative descriptions of 114 research-
oriented CD-ROM databases chosen for their usefulness for bibliographic 
research.  The evaluation of each database considers geographic coverage,
time period covered, variety of material formats covered, and breadth of 
subject area included. - TR

Jackson, Kathy "Disc Technology and Long-Range Planning" CD-ROM 
Professional 5(3) (May 1992):123-125. Jackson urges librarians to be 
more futuristic in planning equipment purchases. Third-generation CD-ROM 
drives now provide access speeds of 300 milliseconds versus the current 
industry standard of 500 milliseconds; second-generation drives may 
appear to be bargains, but they will probably be too slow for networking 
applications or for use with multimedia CD-ROM discs. Jackson also 
covers timely issues such as remote access demands, the projected rise of 
multi- function optical drives at the expense of WORM drives, and cutting-
edge networking solutions such as SilverPlatter's new tower containing 
four 1 gigabyte magnetic disk drives. - TR

Jacso, Peter. CD-ROM Software, Dataware and Hardware: Evaluation, 
Selection, and Installation.  Englewood, Colorado: Libraries Unlimited, 
Inc., 1992.  Jacso systematically reviews the most characteristic 
features of CD-ROM databases and the facilities required to use them.  
The purpose of the book is to help the librarian in the evaluation, 
comparison, selection, installation, and operation of CD-ROM products.

Theil, Thomas J. "Integrating CD-ROM and WORM Optical Disk Systems on 
the Navy's Paperless Ship" CD-ROM Professional 5(3) (May 1992):17-26.  
This article details the U.S. Navy's "Paperless Ship Project."  Depending 
upon the type of ship, a naval vessel carries between 10 to 40 tons of 
paper. In an attempt to reduce this heavy and cumbersome reliance on 
paper, this project tested systems which offer integrated optical disk 
document management capabilities.  Citing enormous increases in work 
effectiveness and efficiency (e.g. four hours of microfiche searching 
took 1.5 minutes on one tested system), the study concluded that systems 
which integrate both writable optical disc and CD-ROM technologies are 
the trend for the future. - TR

White, Wendy "CD-ROM in Developing Countries" CD-ROM Professional 5(3) 
(May 1992):32-35.  White writes of the surprising popularity of CD-ROM 
technology in Africa.  While information specialists in America were 
still evaluating CD-ROM technology, librarians in Africa were using it. 
White explains how the technology is perfectly suited to harsh, remote 
environments. - TR


General

Kupersmith, John "Technostress and the Reference Librarian" RSR:
Reference Services Review 20(2) (Summer 1992):7-14+.  An interesting
and very readable overview of the problem of "technostress" and 
some possible solutions.  Kupersmith introduces four related components
that create technostress: performance anxiety, information overload,
role conflicts, and organizational factors and discusses both
individual and organizational strategies for coping with technostress.
The notes accompanying the article include citations to many additional
articles for those wanting more information.  Definitely recommended
for those who are (techno)stressed out, whether you happen to be
a reference librarian or not. - RT

Lewis, Peter H. "Of Turning the Pages Without Any Pages" New York Times
141 (May 19, 1992):B7 (Western edition).  The Voyager company announces
the publication of their first nine Expanded Books, designed for reading
(and listening to) on the Macintosh Powerbook (pun intended?).  The
books are displayed using HyperCard and take advantage of the sound and
linking capabilities of the medium.  Current titles include "The
Annotated Alice" and "Brave New World" and one of the titles planned for
publication is  "Neuromancer."  This development may allow at least some
of us to try and cuddle up with an electronic (power)book and read in
bed! - DR

Wiederhold, Gio "Mediators in the Architecture of Future Information
Systems" IEEE Computer 25(3) (March 1992):38-49.  This paper, which 
reports on ongoing work that Wiederhold and his colleagues have been 
carrying out at Stanford, deals with the large-scale architecture of 
future information systems.  It envisions a world where there are many 
autonomous, large, complex information systems and looks at concepts 
such as "metaprogramming" which can be used to treat these systems as 
building blocks in constructing larger, cross-system applications.  The 
paper touches on a number of very complex and important issues, such as 
knowledge representation and transfer across systems.  An interesting 
question for the reader to consider: where do future library information 
retrieval systems fit into the picture that Wiederhold discusses? - CL


Forthcoming

Hallman, Judy "Campus-Wide Information Systems" Advances in Library
Automation and Networking, v.5, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press, 1992.  Due
out in October or November 1992.  CWISs are a fast growing group of
campus computer services that provide access to any number of data-
bases through a single server.  Although they tend to be developed by
computing serces on campuses, they provide an excellent opportunity
for cooperation between computing and library staffs.  This paper
explores the basic questions about CWISs and provides examples of
some implementations.  Hallman herself is a CWIS manager at the
University of North Carolina. - DR
