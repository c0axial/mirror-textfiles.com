Information Transfer 
 
Basch, Reva. "The User Wish List and System Software for the 90's: How Far  
so Far?" Online 15(6) (November 1991):42-47.  Basch examines the influence  
consumers have had and will continue to have in system software  
development as they demand more custom-tailored options in databases.--

Billington, James H. "Library of Congress to Open Collections to Local  
Libraries in Electronic Access Plans."  American Libraries (September  
1991):706-. Billington describes a current pilot project, LC Direct, enabling  
remote electronic access to the holdings of the Library of Congress; and the  
American Memory project which will eventually deliver electronic copies of  
materials of some of LC's unique collections to remote users.--VR 
 
Celko, Joe. "DBMS Report: Retrieve your Information with 'Textbases.'"  
Systems Integration 24(9) (September 1991):31.   Celko gives a good and  
brief explanation of textbase systems and their relevance to document  
retrieval.--VR 
 
Cotton, Dirk. "At last! Standards for Broadcast Data." Data Communications  
20(10) (August 1991):31-32. Cotton reports on two organizations who are  
developing standards "that will integrate broadcast data and interactive  
applications on the same network, eliminating the cost of operating  
multiple networks."--VR 
 
Hawkins, Donald T. "Imaging--Another New Technology for the Information  
World: The Basics." Online 15(6) (November 1991): 103-105.  Hawkins  
explores the basics of imaging and promises "sequels [that] will look at  
retrieval from image-generated databases...."--VR 
 
Tucker, Tracey. "Telephone Response Technologies' InteleFax. A Fax-On- 
Demand Application Toolkit." Teleconnect 9(8) (August 1991):145-147.  This  
article describes how fax-on-demand, integrated voice/fax systems, "have  
expedited customer access to information."--VR 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Goode, Joanne and Maggie Johnson "Putting Out the Flames: The Etiquette and  
Law of E-Mail"  Online 15(6) (November 1991):61-67.  Goode and Johnson  
point out that since e-mail is a new and still evolving mode of interpersonal  
communication, we may need some pointers on its use beyond the basic  
procedures.  The authors discuss mail management, style guidelines,  
survival skills and the issue of privacy.--DR 
 
Hinnebusch, Mark "Z39.50: A Path for Implementation" Computers in  
Libraries 11(8) (September 1991):30-31.  Hinnebusch updates us on the  
activities taking place to bring about implementation of the Z39.50  
standard.  This standard will allow full compatibility for search and  
retrieval of information across multiple platforms, described as "the most  
important standard in library and information retrieval automation since  
the MARC format."--DR 
 
Kibirige, M. "Information Communication Highways in the 1990s: An Analysis  
of Their Potential Impact on Library Automation" Information Technology  
and Libraries 10(3) (September 1991):172-184.  This in-depth article  
explains how the combined increases in bandwidth of networks (primarily  
through the increased use of fiber optic cable and satellite transmission)  
and computing power of local systems are bringing immense changes in the  
library and information industry.--DR 
 
Quint, Barbara "Flipping for Full-Text" Wilson Library Bulletin 66(1)  
(September 1991):82-85.  Quint gives us some of the low-down on full- 
text--is it really "full"? Why can't I find the San Francisco Chronicle's  
Sunday edition?  What about optical databases?  The author also provides  
some sources on locating and evaluating full-text services.--DR 
 
 
Optical Disc Technology 
 
Ciuffetti, Peter D. "A Plea for CD-ROM Interchangeability" CD-ROM Librarian  
6(8) September 1991:27-28.   This article analyzes the state of  
standardization within the CD-ROM industry and makes a proposal for multi- 
vendor cooperation through standards that will enable the industry to  
provide the next level of capabilities to researchers.--TR 
 
Brown, Christopher L. and David E. Coleman "Testing and Development of an  
Efficient, Remote CD-ROM System" CD-ROM Librarian 6(9) October 1991:13- 
18.   This case study profiles the CD-ROM-based aquaculture information  
service designed to increase access for a regional community that is widely  
dispersed throughout the Pacific. The article discusses site selection,  
system selection criteria, components, performance, operation, and impact.   
One major impact of remote access is reducing the need for expensive  
information-gathering practices, such as traveling to more technologically- 
advanced places or hiring consultants.--TR 
 
Paul, David, et al. "The Over-The Counter CD-ROM Network Solution" CD-ROM  
Librarian 6(9) October 1991:19-23.   This is another case study of remote  
access to a CD-ROM network. The Southern Maryland Regional Library  
Association (SMRLA) set out to provide a wide variety of CD-ROM packages  
to meet the needs of its branch libraries.  Because of the grant size, they  
were unable to implement a "turnkey" or Novell-based system, but utilized  
off-the-shelf components to build their networking solution instead.--TR
