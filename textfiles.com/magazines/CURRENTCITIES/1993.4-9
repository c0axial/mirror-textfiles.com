Electronic Publishing
 
Cronk, Ronald D. "Unlocking Data's Content" Byte 18(10)
(September 1993):111-120.  The data in a document is often richer
and more informational than a simple text or numerical figures.
Electronic documents can be made to work for an organization in
ways paper documents never could.  Various applications running
on different platforms can be linked to run as one document.
Markup languages are one way to make the data computer readable
across different applications. SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
Language) is the most widely used tagging language. One drawback
of SGML is that there is no universal standard for the specific
processing rules used for encoding and decoding documents,
another is that SGML itself only works on text.  Another way to
solve the problem of document interchange is to link multiple
applications in a single document.  This method is known as
compound document architecture (CDA).  The two leading CDAs are
Open Document Architecture and DEC's Compound Document
Architecture.  An attractive element of CDAs are that they are
not limited to text, but also allow for the interchange of
images and graphics.

Lu, Cary. "Publish it Electronically" Byte 18(10) (September
1993):94-110.  Organizations of any size might benefit by 
publishing their documents electronically.  Ease of searching, 
and reduced storage requirements and paper use make online 
document databases attractive to many users.  There are some 
hurtles to overcome, however: so far the technology is best 
suited for minimally formatted text documents and there is no 
clear standard solution for managing electronic documents.  The 
benefits of electronic document delivery are best realized with 
computer-readable text.  This means that non-electronic documents 
need to be optically scanned and run through OCR (optical 
character recognition) software, which can be time consuming and 
labor intensive.  Software companies (e.g., Adobe Systems and No 
Hands Software) are working on "print-to screen" technology that 
allows for better graphics and typography in searchable 
electronic document delivery. - DBR
 
Murray, Phillip C. "Documentation Goes Digital" Byte 18(10)
(September 1993):121-129.  Electronic reference documents (ERDs)
are becoming more popular and more prevalent in today's workplace.
ERDs (sometimes employing hypertext) are supplanting their hard
copy predecessors at an accelerating rate in part due to their
flexibility and the increased ease of access to the information
they contain.  Their flexibility allows ERDs to be useful in a
wide range of documents from technical handbooks to organization
policy manuals.  As it stands ERD technology is young, there is not 
yet the wide base of experience found in desktop publishing. 
Consequently paper documentation is not going to disappear soon.
However, as organizations become more comfortable with them, the 
future is likely see a wider and more creative use of ERDs. - DBR


Hyper- and Multimedia

Anson, Louisa. "Image Compression: Making Multimedia Publishing a
Reality" CD-ROM Professional 6(5) (September 1993):16-29.  A
thorough overview of current and possible future image 
compression technologies, including the JPEG standard and the
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) upon which it is based.  Research
into Fractal Transform image compression indicates that it may
outperform the DCT-based algorithms, particularly with images
that are compressed once and then accessed many times.  By 
treating "whole images" rather than image blocks as is the case
with DCT compression, the Fractal Image Format (FIF) more closely
approximates the originally scanned image, and enhancing image
quality and providing better performance, particularly with
moving images. - MT

Beer, Jeffrey.  "Video for Windows: Microsoft's Latest Multimedia
Winner" CD-ROM Professional 6(5) (September 1993):44-46.  Beer 
offers a short review of the new Video for Windows describing the 
video capture and edit features, audio linking and the updated 
runtime version of the Windows Media Player.  A video capture 
board and Video for Windows may be all that you need to get a 
start in the Windows multimedia world. - MT

Fetterman, Roger L. "Multimedia Networks for Business" CD-ROM
Professional 6(5) (September 1993):78-81.  The first of a two-
part article on multimedia networks for business applications
examines the range of needs within the world of commerce for
multimedia computing.  Videoconferencing and electronic
performance support systems join training, merchandising and
presentations as avenues which will benefit from the use of
multimedia technology.  The merging of multimedia computing with
networked work groups could produce substantial improvements in
the abilities of businesses to improve worker productivity. - MT

Grossman, Becky Lockwood. "A User's Guide to Multimedia CD-ROM
Drives" CD-ROM Professional 6(5) (September 1993):150-152.  A
useful description and handy comparison table for various
multimedia CD drives.  Multimedia PC (MPC) specifications and 
the aligning of CD-ROM formats are briefly covered in this 
article which indicates some of the cross-compatibility of 
devices that are presently on the market. - MT

Kappe, Frank, Gerald Pani, and Florian Schnabel. "The
Architecture of a Massively Distributed Hypermedia System"
Internet Research 3(1) (Spring 1993):10-24.  Progressing from a
description of present networked hypermedia implementations 
towards the future of such systems, the authors introduce a 
project which would provide better performance and global 
coverage for networked hypermedia systems.  Extending the Hyper-G
system used at the Graz University of Technology and employing a
link server and document cache servers, performance improvements
and solutions for updating changing information are made easier
under the described model.  Multimedia document types, advanced
searching, links that can be traced bi-directionally and document
security features promise to yield a robust networked hypermedia
system, a pilot of which should be available by late 1993. - MT


Networks and Networking

Breeden, Laura, and Lawrence Bouman. "Demythologizing the 
Internet: Lessons from the Real World" EDUCOM Review 28(5) 
(September/October 1993):29-35.  Breeden and Bouman examine some 
of the myths surrounding the Internet and its funding sources.  
As the executive director of FARNET, Inc. and senior vice 
president for Network Engineering at MCI, respectively, Breeden 
and Bouman are insiders with a mission to clear up the common 
misconception that the loss of Federal subsidies to networking 
organizations will end networking as we know it.  As they point 
out, "The federal investment in the Internet represents a small 
but critical fraction of the total, perhaps as small as 10 
percent overall."  This money has been considered critical 
because, in the past, it provided seed money for development in 
high-risk areas.  Now that the Internet has reached a certain 
level of maturity, this money may not be so critical.  The 
authors also note that there is legislation under consideration 
in Congress that would provide direct funds for networking to 
various research and education organizations including libraries 
and K-12. - DFWR

Dern, Daniel. "Start Here: How and Why to Join the Internet and 
Get Going"  Internet World (September/October 1993):67-77.  Dern 
offers a fairly complete, though article-length, guide to 
getting connected to the Internet.  Describing the advantages, 
disadvantages, and costs of the various options available to 
both individuals a organizations of all sizes, Dern offers 
potential users a way out of the muddle of connection acronyms 
and promises.  To whet the appetite, Dern includes a "handful" 
of the many reasons to join the Internet world (as if we didn't
know already ;-). - DFWR

Deutsch, Peter. "Peter's Soapbox" Internet World (September/
October 1993):48-49.  Deutsch introduces his new column in 
Internet World.  He describes his plans for musing on 
various aspects of the Internet and its ongoing development, 
concentrating on social and technical issues.  Much of the 
discussion in this installment is about the possible effects of 
the rapid commercialization of the Internet.  Deutsch wonders 
whether the anarchic, local-initiative-oriented aspects of the 
Internet will survive, and opines that this is the time to try
and influence the future direction of the network. - DFWR

Digital Privacy and Security Working Group. "Outline of 
Testimony Before NIST Advisory Board" EFFector Online 5(16) 
(September 3, 1993).  
<URL=ftp://ftp.eff.org//pub/EFF/newsletters/effector5.16>  The 
Digital Privacy and Security Working Group, a coalition of over 
50 telecommunications, computer and public interest organizations 
chaired by EFF, testified before the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology on the Clinton administration's Clipper 
Chip/Slipjack proposal.  They stated that the proposal could be 
accepted if use of the Clipper Chip/Slipjack were completely 
voluntary.  Among the requests made by the Working Group were a 
relaxation of export controls on encryption technology and a more 
complete, public evaluation of the Clipper technology.  [NIST h
as asked for public comment by September 28, 1993; comments may 
be emailed to cryptnow@eff.org by 8pm EDT Sept. 27th, where they 
will be printed and delivered to NIST] - DFWR

Estrada, Susan. Connecting to the Internet: A Buyer's Guide.  
Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly & Associates, 1993.  This timely and 
concise handbook covers most of the bases when it comes to 
getting connected to the Internet in the US.  Designed to help 
users select the best choice of connection type and service 
provider, Estrada's guide explains how each type of connection 
works, what parts of the connection the user needs to be 
concerned with, and what are the relative advantages and 
disadvantages of each option.  Appendices include a list of 
dial-up providers, dedicated connection service providers, and a 
glossary. - DFWR

Godwin, Mike. "The Law of the Net: Problems and Prospects"  
Internet World (September/October 1993):52-54.  Godwin, legal 
services counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, offers 
a brief primer on some of the emerging legal issues surrounding 
network activities of various sorts.  Many legal doctrines of 
the past are challenged by the network, and in less than 
obvious, but still profound ways.  Among these challenges: what 
does libel mean when the injured party can publish just as 
easily as the party that published the libelous statement? What 
about the international nature of the network, where individuals 
in one can country can contact thousands of users in another?  
Godwin also describes how the net effects criminal, negligence, 
and of course, copyright law. - DFWR

Kelly, Kevin. "When Bandwidth is Free: The Dark Fiber Interview 
with George Gilder" Wired 1(4) (September/October 1993):38-41.  
Gilder, a writer on technology and society, describes some 
aspects of the future he sees where networking bandwidth is 
free.  Arguing that fiber optics can offer virtually unlimited 
bandwidth, Gilder claims that the ultimate resource will be the 
human mind and where we will need to economize.  Advances in 
computing will also give immense information power to 
individuals, power that formerly was only in the hands of a few.

Klensin, John, and Randy Bush. "Expanding International E-mail 
Connectivity: Another Look" ConneXions 7(8) (August 1993):25-29.  
Klensin and Bush note that when email-based personal networking 
and collaboration become available to users, they quickly become 
dependent on it. In fact, "previously-unanticipated 
collaboration seems to come into being almost spontaneously."  
To increase the availability of email in those areas that lack 
the infrastructure and expertise, a number of factors need to be 
considered: consider the local conditions as even in the 
"developed" world, expecting an elementary school to obtain a 
dedicated phone line may be asking too much; address the basic 
needs of the user community rather than aiming too high and 
possibly scaring them off (e.g., dial-up access at 2400 baud 
rather than a 56K line).  Typically, small beginnings will breed 
further development with little or no outside encouragement. -

Lawton, George. "The End of the Party Line" Wired 1(4) 
(September/October 1993):66-69.  With Russia's telephone network 
barely beginning to enter the latter half of this century, 
efforts are underway to provide digital service in St. 
Petersburg and Moscow.  In the meantime, however, a number of 
networks connected to the Internet have sprung up in the last 3 
years.  Among the service providers are FidoNet, Glasnet, 
Relcom, and a commercial network, Sovam Teleport.  Levels of 
service and prices vary widely among these providers, and often, 
the fastest line available is only 2400 baud.  Ironically, the 
US government's rules limiting sales of high technology 
equipment to "communist" countries is limiting the development 
of an open and easily-accessible network in Russia. - DFWR

Markoff, John. "A New Information Mass Market" The New York 
Times (September 3, 1993):C1, C4 (Western edition).  With the 
announcement that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has acquired 
the Delphi Internet Services company comes the recognition that 
the Internet is now a mass market opportunity.  Murdoch plans to 
distribute some of his newspapers online, and other companies 
are offering services such as Internet fax, a cheaper 
alternative to standard fax.  Clearly, this news heralds a new 
era for the Internet. - DFWR

Peters, Paul Evan. "Are We Gardeners or Are We Farmers?: Guiding 
Internet Resource and Service Planners and Developers" EDUCOM 
Review 28(5) (September/October 1993):60-62.  Peters describes 
how Internet resource and service planning and development 
strategies fall into three categories: modernizing, innovating, 
and transforming strategies. A modernizing strategy simply 
updates an old solution (e.g., email); an innovative strategy 
solves an old problem that heretofore was unsolvable (e.g., 
Z39.50); a transforming strategy is one which solves a problem 
that heretofore did not exist.  In this last instance, the 
"problem" is the accumulation and aggregation of knowledge and 
specialists in a single virtual space.  Peters points out that 
the Internet is "brimming with noteworthy initiatives by 
individuals who seek to modernize, innovate, and/or transform 
the ways knowledge is created, managed, and utilized within 
their communities." - DFWR

Reynolds, Dennis. "Evaluating Dial-Up Internet Access Options" 
Computers in Libraries 13(8) (September 1993):86-93.  Reynolds 
provides a library perspective on the more popular questions of 
the day, "How do get on the Internet?"  Similar to Estrada's 
book, and Dern's article, this article describes the issues 
user (in this case librarians and library staff) must consider 
when purchasing a dial-up connection to the Internet: base 
costs, hourly costs, user support, interfaces and editors, and 
performance.  Unfortunately the article fails to clearly 
explain all the advantages of a SLIP or PPP connection other 
than the improved speed of data transfer.  For the library that 
knows it wants a dial-up Internet account, this article is a 
good place to start learning about the important concerns.

Sandfort, Sandy. "The Intelligent Island?" Wired 1(4) (September/
October 1993):52-55, 116.  While the US has a plan for its "data 
superhighway", Singapore is already well along the technological 
path to ubiquitous, multimedia, networked computing.  But 
currently, their Teleview system is has no international links.  
What will happen is a country that censors the foreign press and 
officially has no drugs or prostitution offers Internet 
connections to the general public?  One economist who has spent 
time teaching in Singapore says, "Their big problem is what to do 
when Singaporeans are introduced to the world." - DFWR

The White House.  National Information Infrastructure: Agenda for 
Action. Version 1.0. September 1993.  
<URL=ftp://ftp.ntia.doc.gov/pub/niiagenda.asc> 
<URL=gopher://gopher.nist.gov/DOC Documents/niiagenda.asc>.  
This is the latest release from the Clinton/Gore administration 
regarding the National Information Infrastructure (NII) 
initiative, and provides some of the clearest information yet 
about the administration's plans.  For the first time, there is 
a clear articulation of the goals of the NII initiative itself, 
as well as the specific programs both planned and in progress 
designed to effect the overall plan.  One sentence, from the 
Executive Summary, describes the administration's overall 
position on the government's role in the development of the NII: 
"Carefully crafted government action will complement and enhance 
the efforts of the private sector and assure the growth of an 
information infrastructure available to all Americans at 
reasonable cost."  Outlined in the text are 9 principles of the 
NII.  Among these are: "universal service"; a trustworthy and 
secure network, "protecting the privacy of its users" - but 
still allowing authorized wiretaps; protection of intellectual 
property. Towards these ends, the President has convened a 
Federal inter-agency Information Infrastructure Task Force 
(IITF) that will work with Congress and the private sector with 
three committees focusing on telecommunications policy, 
information policy, and applications. The administration will 
also establish a private sector Advisory Council on the National 
Information Infrastructure to advise the IITF.  Included in the 
report is a list of government actions taken in each of the 9 
focus areas and description of projects in business, health 
care, civic networking, research, life-long learning, government 
operations.  It is a pleasure to see that the administration 
recognizes the value of the participatory nature of the network, 
writing, "the NII will be of maximum value to users if it is 
sufficiently 'open' and interactive so that users can develop 
new services and applications or exchange information among 
themselves, without waiting for services to be offered by the 
firms that operate the NII." - DFWR

Wilford, Neville. "Cello: Getting a Window on the World Wide 
Web" The World Wide Web Global Network Newsletter 1 
(September/October 1993):11-12.  Wilford reviews Cello, an MS 
Windows World-Wide Web browser similar to Mosaic that is 
available via anonymous FTP.  While still in beta testing, 
Wilford claims Cello is stable and quite useful as an Internet 
front-end, supporting WWW, FTP, Telnet, and email.  Wilford also 
includes handy tips for loading the software and extensions for 
handling sounds, graphics, and PostScript. - DFWR 


Optical Disc Technologies
 
Hartigan, John M. "Compact Disc Recording: A Technical Overview"
CD-ROM Professional 6(5) (September 1993):102-106.  "In an age
of revolutionary products and revolutionary ideas," writes
Hartigan, "one product stands out as the most revolutionary: a 
recorder with the ability to record compact discs at the
desktop."  Hartigan enthusiastically describes both the 
innovative technology and its promising market potential. - TR
 
Herther, Nancy K., et. al. "CD-ROM Distribution Today: Surveying
Attitudes of Top Computer Distributors" CD-ROM Professional
6(5) (September 1993):86-91.  This article presents the results
of a survey targeting computer distributors, designed to 
determine the nature and scope of CD-ROM acceptance in the
traditional computer distribution channels.  The results of
the survey provide evidence of a major shift by computer
distributors to not only include CD-based products in their
product line, but to actively support and promote these products 
to their clients. - TR
 
Herther, Nancy K. "Dancing With Life: Talking About the Future
of CD-ROM and SilverPlatter with Bela Hatvany" CD-ROM 
Professional 6(5) (September 1993):71-76.  CD-ROM Professional 
Editor in Chief Nancy Herther interviews Bela Hatvany, 
SilverPlatter's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.  
Hatvany, one of the early believers in CD-ROM technology, 
describes the humble beginnings of Silver-Platter, originally 
called INCubator, residing in a 10' x 10' office space.  A decade 
later, SilverPlatter is intent upon being the world's best 
distributor of information in electronic form. Hatvany's future 
vision of SilverPlatter includes heavy investment in four areas: 
distribution (naturally), internal systems, technology, and 
market-specific publishing. - TR
 
Kovacs, Diane K. "The Best and the Worst Government Printing
Office CD-ROMs: Govdoc-L Reports Again" CD-ROM Professional
6(5) (September 1993):58-61.  This article presents the results 
of a survey ranking GPO CD-ROMs which was conducted on a
government documents electronic discussion list, Govdoc-L.  Since 
the GPO no longer distributes some of its material in printed 
format, libraries often have no choice regarding CD-ROM 
collection development.  The overwhelming favorite for best CD-
ROM was the National Trade DataBank; the "favorite" choice for 
worst GPO CD-ROM product was the Congressional Record. - TR
 
McDonald, Dennis D. "Access to Data While on the Road: A 
Hands-on Look at Portable CD-ROM Systems" CD-ROM Professional
6(5) (September 1993):120-127.  McDonald provides a personal
perspective on portable CD-ROM systems.  Portable CD-ROM systems
are defined, the connection between the CD-ROM drive and the
computer is explained, and salient issues such as portability,
battery life, performance, durability, and display are discussed.
The author cautions that both portable computing and CD-ROM-based
electronic publishing are changing rapidly.  What was considered
state-of-the-art only six months ago may be obsolete tomorrow, or 
it might still be in use five years from now. - TR
 
McQueen, Howard. "CD-ROM Servers: An Overview" CD-ROM 
Professional 6(5) (September 1993):54-57.  This article reviews 
various CD-ROM server configurations, ranging from the simple to 
complex.  Among the systems described are access to CD-ROMs 
attached to individual workstations, dedicated CD-ROM (only) 
servers, and dedicated file server/CD-ROM servers. - TR
 
Richards, Trevor and Christine Robinson. "Evaluating CD-ROM
Software: A Model" CD-ROM Professional 6(5) (September 1993): 92-
101.  Richards and Robinson start by summarizing the literature

evaluation which concentrates primarily upon user interface 
criteria.- TR
 
Rugg, Tom. "Installing a Low-Cost LAN: Fool-Proof Tips From a 
Pro" CD-ROM Professional 6(5) (September 1993):114-118.  The
major drawbacks of local area networks (LANs) are the expense and 
the complexity.  Rugg presents alternatives, utilizing two of the 
most popular, low-cost network operating systems, LANtastic and 
NetWare Lite. If conditions are ideal, LANs can be installed for 
as little as $150 per PC. - TR
