Electronic Publishing

Glaberson, William. "Creating Electronic Editions, Newspapers Try
New Roles" The New York Times 142(49,425) (August 16, 1993).  
More and more print newspapers are beginning to aim at the online 
home computer market by offering electronic versions of their 
publications.  Generally speaking the electronic medium is new to 
newspaper publishers and questions about advertising and the
electronic newspaper's role in the media are yet to be answered. 
There are those skeptics who remember the failed "videotext 
systems" of the mid-1980's and worry that the same failure will 
be repeated.  However, the potential for expanded services 
(community bulletin boards and increased local news) and the 
ability to easily update and cross reference news stories has 
many people excited. - DBR

Abernathy, Aileen. "Managing Your Media" MacUser 9(9) (September 
1993):190-206.  Database software packages for the cataloging of 
image files are described and reviewed in this article which 
includes a chart comparing the features of 8 recent releases.  
Most programs will handle a variety of image formats, both still 
and moving, and provide thumbnail views of the image files 
themselves.  Several offer a variety of indexes for searching and 
users can define their own fields as well as use pre-established 
fields. Programs of the type described are sure to be useful as 
users seek ways to control growing image files.  - MT

Dunley, Tim. "Microsoft Modular Windows: A Key Platform for
Multimedia CD-ROM Development" CD-ROM Professional 6(4) (July
1993):152-157.  Describing a Microsoft Windows operating system 
for the control of interactive multimedia that is open for third-
party development, scalable throughout the Windows family and 
extensible for new devices or applications, this article details 
the new modular approach taken in Microsoft's newest multimedia 
authoring release.  The user interface is designed for a 
television as the display and the package has been optimized to 
use less memory that Windows 3.1 through the use of a smaller set 
of core routines.  The open system approach will enable other 
vendors to develop multimedia applications based on the modules 
and authors should find working with the new system simpler and 
easier than many other authoring kits. - MT

"Answers to Clipper Questions" EFFector Online 5(14) (August 5,
1993) [should be available via anonymous FTP from ftp.eff.org as 
/pub/EFF/newsletters/effector5.14 <URL=ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF
/newsletters/effector5.14>].  Responding to 114 questions sent to 
President Clinton about the Clipper Chip proposal, John D. 
Podesta, Assistant to the President and Staff Secretary, provides 
answers to the questions.  Highlights of the answers appear in 
this article, while the entire response should be available at 
the EFF FTP archive site in the directory /pub/EFF/legal-issues 
<URL=ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/legal-issues/>.  Among the 
questions and answers: Q: Why is the key escrow scheme being 
proposed? A: To provide security for US businesses while 
preserving the ability to perform authorized wiretaps; Q: Is the 
key escrow initiative compatible with constitutional rights? A: 
The key escrow initiative does not require the user to create 
"speech" nor does it infringe upon the content of the speech, so 
it does not infringe upon 1st Amendment rights, as wiretaps would 
need to be authorized, and the user does not know their own 
escrowed keys, there is no 4th or 5th Amendment infringement.

Benford, Steve, et al. "GRACE: A System to Support the 
Development and Use of Global Computer-Supported Cooperative Work 
(CSCW) Applications" Internet Research 3(1) (Spring 1993):25-35.  
Benford and his colleagues describe both the concepts and 
implementation issues of a cooperative work system.  Although the 
system they are developing is designed around Open Systems 
Interconnection (OSI), the conceptual model could be ported to 
other networks, and is intended to support world-wide cooperative 
work. - DFWR

Clarkson, Mark. "All-Terrain Networking" BYTE 18(9) (August 
1993):111-116.  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is considered 
the new panacea of networking, providing a seamless interface 
between LANs and the public telephone network and high-speed, 
high-bandwidth communications over common media.  Clarkson 
explains how ATM makes this possible by standardizing packet size 
and thereby allowing for dynamic, very high-speed switching.  
Although widespread implementation of ATM is not expected for 
another 18 months, it can be used effectively in small-scale 
implementations today. - DFWR

End-Users on the Internet: What They Want, What They Need, What 
They're Doing" Internet World 4(5-6) (June/July/August 1993):4-9.  
Dern outlines the needs and desires of both individual, private, 
and business Internet users (now numbered in the thousands).  
While individuals want a simpler interface and new user training, 
businesses are interested in stable and secure services.  Dern 
also predicts that we are approaching a another burst of new 
connectivity, and consequent development of the network and 
services for these new users. - DFWR

1993):A17, A20.  While no big problems were solved, the 
impressive part of a meeting on the National Information 
Infrastructure at the Library of Congress was the list of 
participants.  The first hour of the meeting was presided over 
by Vice-President Gore who pointed out that gigabytes of 
information that is poorly organized will be useless.  Other 
participants included university, library, networking, and 
entertainment representatives. - DFWR

Electronic Frontier Foundation. "Toward a New Public Interest

from ftp.eff.org as the file named /pub/EFF/papers/open-
platform-discussion-1993 <URL=ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/papers/
open-platform-discussion-1993>].  The EFF describes its 1993 
open platform proposal to encourage the development of open 
networking.  The document calls for universal service, free 
speech and common carriage, privacy and security of 
communications, and the development of public interest 
applications and services.  The key is to be sure that the 
emerging infrastructure that includes cable and telephone 
services provides two-way, switched communications that gives 
users the power to be both information providers as well as 
information consumers. - DFWR

Kent, Stephen T. "Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail" 
Communications of the ACM 36(8) (August 1993):48-60.  Privacy 
Enhanced Mail (PEM) offers Internet users the ability to 
integrate various levels of privacy and security in their 
communications without making big changes in the way they do 
their work.  Mail authentication does not require that 
recipients employ PEM, though those users will not benefit from 
PEMs authentication scheme.  PEM has been designed to offer 
various levels of security so that implementation can be effected 
according to need and level of participation on the recipient's 
part.  PEM offers further flexibility by being able to employ 
either public or private key encryption. - DFWR

MacKie-Mason, Jeffrey K. and Hal R. Varian. Pricing the 
Internet. Preliminary draft. April 1993 (current version: June 
11, 1993).  Available via anonymous FTP from 
alfred.econ.lsa.umich.edu in directory /pub/Papers as 
Pricing_the_Internet.1.ps.Z 
<URL=ftp://alfred.econ.lsa.umich.edu/pub/Papers/ Internet.1.ps.Z>.  
MacKie-Mason and Varian argue that in order to encourage efficient 
use of network bandwidth and investment in increased capacity, it 
makes sense to charge for packets according to priority and 
congestion.  In this scheme, the user sets the priority of their 
data (e.g., low priority for email, but high for video 
transmission) and offers a bid for the maximum price acceptable.  
When the network is congested, users would then be forced to pay 
for data up to and including the price they bid.  These fees would 
then be applied to creating additional capacity.  Since the 
marginal cost of low priority packets and packets during non-peak 
times is essentially nothing, these packets could be priced at 
little or no cost.  The pricing structure these authors have 
devised is intended to address four types of network costs: "the 
fixed costs of providing the network infrastructure," "the 
incremental [or marginal] costs of sending extra packets," "the 
social costs of delaying other users' packets when the network is 
congested", and "the cost of expanding capacity of the network."

Mello, John P., Jr. "Future Communications" BYTE 18(9) (August 
1993):94-106.  Mello describes the convergence of computers and 
telephony hardware and software and the increasing ability of 
both computers and networks to handle multimedia objects.  As 
telephone-based services become more complex, it only makes sense 
to provide users with a better interface than the 12 basic keys 
available now.  A number of computer manufacturers are teaming-up 
with telephone manufacturers to develop new computer/phones or 
"smartphones" for both desktop and wireless use.  Novell and AT&T 
have also released a product that links a PBX and Novell server 
that allows data and services to be exchanged between the two 
systems.  As computer-based telecommunications become more 
robust, the ability to share and manage multimedia objects in a 
distributed environment also grows.  Also included with this 
article are sidebars on the entrance of cable TV systems into the 
networking fray and emerging methods of mass data storage (by Bob 
Ryan). - DFWR

Murray, Janet. "K12 Network: Global Education Through 
Telecommunications" Communications of the ACM 36(8) (August 
1993):36-41.  K12Net is a network for K-12 students and 
educators and is available through FidoNet and USENET.  K12Net 
offers activities in 19 curricula as well as a data and software 
library.  Topics range from intercultural discussions to 
scientific experiments.  A conservative prediction is that there 
will be 3-4 million student users of K12Net by the year 2000.

Rotenberg, Marc. "Communications Privacy: Implications for 
Network Designs" Communications of the ACM 36(8) (August 1993):
61-68.  Rotenberg, Director of the Washington Office of Computer 
Professionals for Social Responsibility, begins this article by 
describing the three areas of concern in communications privacy: 
confidentiality, anonymity, and personal data protection.  
Rotenberg then goes on to describe the major policy efforts to 
protect users' rights, internationally and in various nations.  
It is important to recognize that as the communications 
infrastructure becomes unified, privacy concerns often need to 
be addressed with a new perspective.  See also, Tuerkheimer, 
Frank M. "The Underpinnings of Privacy Protection"

Ruth, Stephen R. and Raul Gouet. "Must Invisible Colleges be 
Invisible?: An Approach to Examining Large Communities of 
Network Users" Internet Research 3(1) (Spring 1993):36-53.  
Ruth and Gouet describe their study of network use by the 
community of scientific researchers in Chile.  Unlike most other 
studies of network users, this one began with a large sample 
(908 usable responses).  Among the findings: scientists using the 
networks claimed that the network made them more efficient, there 
was no correlation between age and network usage, and women were 
more likely to be network users than men. - DFWR

Sadowsky, George. "Network Connectivity for Developing 
Countries" Communications of the ACM 36(8) (August 1993):42-47.  
While the advantages of Internet access may be obvious in the 
developed world, it is not always so in the developing one.  
Those of us in the developed world must be sensitive to local 
needs when extolling the virtues of networking in the developing 
world.  Among the benefits available to such users: stable 
communications both within their own country and internationally 
as well as access to expertise around the globe. - DFWR

Stix, Gary. "Domesticating Cyberspace" Scientific American 269(2) 
(August 1993):100-110.  Stix provides a clear analysis of the 
current situation in the development of the National Information 
Infrastructure.  The next few years should prove to bring quite a 
few changes to the network.  As digital and fiber technologies 
are deployed, we should see both telephone companies of various 
types and cable companies getting deeply involved. - DFWR

"Telecommunications Infrastructure Act of 1993 (S. 1086): A 
Summary by the Electronic Frontier Foundation" EFFector 
Online 5(13) (July 23, 1993) [available via anonymous FTP from 
ftp.eff.org as /pub/EFF/newsletters/effector5.13 <URL=ftp://
ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/newsletters/effector5.13>].  The bill 
before the US Senate would allow regional Bell operating 
companies (RBOCs) to compete for local telephone and cable 
services for both residential and business customers.  The new 
local carriers would still be required to support traditional 
interconnection and universal access.  One of the advantages of 
this legislation is that, if it became law, RBOCs would be in a 
better position to provide hand-off support for cellular 
services between cellular service providers.  The full text of 
the bill is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.eff.org as file

Weitzner, Daniel J. "The Clipper Chip, Key Escrow and the 
Constitution" Networks & Policy 1(2) (Summer 1993):1, 4 [should 
be available via anonymous FTP from ftp.eff.org].  Weitzner asks 
whether the Clinton Administration's Clipper Chip proposal can 
really satisfy the desires of law enforcement if the encryption 
scheme is voluntary.  What is to stop criminals from using 
another, more secure encryption scheme?  If the Administration 
does in fact require that telecommunications in the United 
States be encrypted only using the Clipper Chip, a number of 
constitutional questions arise: does this violate the 4th 
Amendment? do users of the system waive their 5th Amendment 
rights? does this violate the 1st Amendment by prohibiting 
certain types of speech (i.e., speech using another type of 
encryption)? - DFWR

Wilson, David L. "Electronic Riches Are Free on the Internet, but 
Some Worry About the Consequences" The Chronicle of Higher 
Education 39(47) (July 28, 1993):A18, A20-A21.  As the Internet 
enters the public consciousness, and American campuses are 
further strapped for cash, many wonder about the appropriateness 
of the free lunch on the Internet.  While there is a tremendous 
amount of data available for no charge on the Internet, much of 
it is made available with little or no marginal cost to the 
information provider.  Wilson predicts that access to this kind 
of information will continue for a while, even as the pricing 
structure of the network itself may change. - DFWR

Winner, Langdon. "How Technology Reweaves the Fabric of Society" 
The Chronicle of Higher Education 39(48) (August 4, 1993):B1-3.  
Winner writes in this opinion piece that technological advances, 
when implemented on a wide scale, have a profound effect on 
society.  The danger now is that many changes to the US 
infrastructure are in the making but decisions are being made 
without popular participation.  Winner uses emerging national 
information infrastructure as an example of this failure to 
involve the citizenry in the decision-making process. - DFWR

James, Jonathan K. "CD-ROM in the Information Marketplace: A
Comprehensive Study from UMI" CD-ROM Professional 6(4) (July
1993):102-105.  This article presents the results of UMI's annual 
study to track the use of CD-ROMs in the library industry, 
monitor market share levels, and identify trends.  Among the key
findings highlighted is that the use of CD-ROM is approaching
saturation in academic and public libraries; the use of CD-ROM
in high school and corporate library environments is growing
rapidly.  Use of CD-ROM networks in academic and corporate 
libraries is expected to triple by 1994, while doubling in public 
libraries.  Interestingly, this article also notes that database 
tape licensing is also expected to increase nearly threefold by 
1994.  From a product development standpoint, the author points 
out that vendors need to create CD databases that are easily 
networkable and have a tape format to satisfy this growing need. 
From an information professional standpoint, librarians need to 
make intelligent decisions regarding the best-suited database 
formats and configurations. - TR
