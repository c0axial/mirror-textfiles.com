   Arar, Yardena. [7]"Just Plug It In: Networking Via Power Circuits"
   [8]PC World (April 2002)
   (http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,85003,00.asp) - The first
   iteration of powerline networking, using the HomePNA standard, was
   doomed by poor performance. However, the new HomePlug specification
   looks like a more viable technology. HomePlug allows you to network
   your computers by plugging external adapters into standard wall
   outlets. PC World found that it delivered "performance superior to
   that of 802.11b wireless networks at only a small price premium -- no
   more than $25 to $50 per computer." Unlike the earlier HomePNA
   networks, HomePlug's performance is not marred by the operation of
   large household appliances or by powerstrips. It also features DES
   encryption, which affords a better level of security than the RC4
   algorithm employed by 802.11b wireless networks. While HomePlug is not
   cheap -- and certainly not as convenient as wireless for notebook
   computers -- it appears to be worth consideration as a home networking
   alternative. - [9]SK

   January 2002 (http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub105abst.html). -
   Got a new member of the Web Advisory Committee you want to break in?
   Need something more substantial than simply a journal article to
   illustrate best practices in order to move that digital library of
   yours into the 21st century? Look no further than this manual-length
   overview of common techniques for assessing our online efforts. The
   product of interviews with 24 major libraries, the report lavishes
   insightful attention on the usual suspects of evaluative methods
   including surveys, focus groups, heuristic examinations and log
   analyses. The author takes nothing for granted, addressing even the
   most basic questions. During a discussion of surveys for example, she
   takes the time to look at what exactly a survey questionnaire is.
   Marvelous. Helpful as well is the often sobering account of
   difficulties institutions have first undergoing a regime of
   examination and then actually applying the lessons learned to some
   practical end. In the preface we are promised that this is only the
   first of a series of reports sponsored by the [16]Digital Library
   Federation. The series is called Tools for Practitioners and if the
   first offering is any indication, we have a lot to look forward to. -

   Crawford, Walt. [18]"The Crawford Files: Talking 'Bout MyLibrary"
   [19]American Libraries (April 2002): 91,
   (http://www.ala.org/alonline/crawford/cf402.html). - Devoted Current
   Cites reader Walt Crawford casts a skeptical eye on what now might
   legitimately be called the MyLibrary phenomena. It's open to abuse, we
   don't need it, no one uses it. These are some of the problems he sees
   that plague the concept. Of course, if you look around, these are also
   some of the problems that plague all personalization/customization
   schemes both inside and out of the library. It ain't just us.
   Nevertheless I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of these
   efforts. Indeed, there's every expectation that our investment will
   increase rather than diminish and that chat reference will sooner
   heave over and die than we yank the MyLibraries from OurLibraries.
   What makes the concept so attractive, still, is the fact that we've
   got so much stuff on our sites. Anything that can help out the
   navigation and local search engine, those two other paragons of
   access, is potentially a boon. Current implementations are certain to
   be improved over the ages and this in itself is sure to tempt a larger
   following. One obvious improvement is to make setting them up less
   onerous. The user shouldn't have to do anything, runs one line of
   thought. In fact, why should we even have to go to another page? In
   any case, as they become less intrusive, they certainly will become
   more popular. I don't want a computer to make choices for me, by
   golly, but I sure would appreciate a machine that remembers me. Is
   that too much to ask? - [20]LRK
   
   Dickard, Norris. [21]"Federal Retrenchment on the Digital Divide:
   Potential National Impact" Benton Foundation Communications Policy &
   Practice, Policy Brief #1 (March 18, 2002)
   (http://www.benton.org/policybriefs/brief01.html). - Those of us using
   information technology in higher education have thought about the
   digital divide to varying degrees but we don't see much firsthand
   evidence of it, and I'd guess that most Current Cites readers are
   serving populations which haven't had much problem getting online so
   we get a false impression that Internet use is improving for society
   as a whole. Dickard states the converse, and succinctly presents the
   case that the digital divide will widen if the federal government
   stops funding programs which have helped close it, in particular the
   Dept. of Education's Community Technology Centers Program and the
   Dept. of Commerce's Technology Opportunities Program. His
   well-documented points support the argument that continuing government
   efforts to improve access and training for low-income and rural
   communities is not only socially progressive but economically smart.

   - For those of us still struggling with basic concepts regarding
   metadata in this brave new world in which cataloging means much more
   than MARC, an article like this is welcome indeed. In this 30,000-foot
   overview of the metadata landscape, broad issues such as modularity,
   namespaces, extensibility, refinement, and multilingualism are
   discussed. In addition, "practicalities" like application profiles,
   syntax and semantics, metadata registries, and automated generation of
   metadata are explained. Although this piece is not exhaustive of
   high-level metadata issues, it is nonetheless a useful description of
   some of the most important issues surrounding metadata creation and
   use. - [26]RT
   
   Fraase, Michael. [27]"When Elephants Dance" [28]Arts & Farces (March
   23, 2002) (http://www.farces.com/stories/storyReader$414) - In this
   essay, widely referenced around the Net, Michael Fraase explains how
   the publishing, music and motion picture industries are in the process
   of "a worldwide intellectual property power grab with two distinct
   targets" -- little old you, the average consumer, and the big
   technology companies like Microsoft, Intel, Apple. Fraase is careful
   to exempt authors -- "the entertainment industry hates authors almost
   as much as they hate customers" -- but he castigates the consumer
   electronics industry (manufacturers of DVD players, VCRs, stereos) for
   sleeping with the enemy. Fraase includes a particularly juicy quote
   from security and cryptography expert [29]Bruce Schneier
   (http://www.counterpane.com/schneier.html), who told online civil
   liberties attorney [30]Mike Godwin
   (http://www.panix.com/~mnemonic/about.html), "If you think about it,
   the entertainment industry does not want people to have computers;
   they're too powerful, too flexible, and too extensible. They want
   people to have Internet Entertainment Platforms: televisions, VCRs,
   game consoles, etc." The essay discusses the implications of
   copy-protected CDs, intellectual property "moral rights," the DCMA,
   the Internet radio/royalties issue, copyright history, digital TV,
   digital rights management and the controversial Hollings bill.
   ("Should we be surprised that four of Hollings’ top campaign donors
   are media conglomerates?") The technology industry is working to
   counter this ugly intellectual property trend; [31]DigitalConsumer.org
   (http://www.digitalconsumer.org/), founded by two former members of
   Excite.com, has issued a [32]"Consumer Technology Bill of Rights"
   (http://www.digitalconsumer.org/bill.html), which seeks to protect
   consumer fair use rights. This essay is a must-read. - [33]SK

   [35]Information Technology and Libraries 21(1) (March 2002)
   (http://www.lita.org/ital/ital2101.html). - Open source software
   (software which is distributed in a form that people can read and
   modify) is becoming increasingly important to libraries. Besides using
   Apache to serve many of our web sites, a number of other open source
   applications are helping us solve library problems. Therefore, this
   special issue of ITAL is both welcome and none too soon. Eric Lease
   Morgan's contribution [36]"Possibilities for Open Source Software in
   Libraries" is of particular note, and is luckily available on the web
   (http://www.lita.org/ital/2101_morgan.html). An annotated list of OSS
   applications in use in libraries would have been quite useful, but
   disappointed readers can at least get a start at the good [37]OSS4Lib

   HTML and Adobe Acrobat formats, is "a detailed, step-by-step guide
   leading readers through the creation of a business plan for start-up
   and early-stage electronic publishing ventures, including digital
   repositories and journals." In reality, it is closely focused on
   databases and journals, and those created and managed as fee-supported
   entities. If you have a different model for support (e.g., public
   subsidy) or a different type of publication (e.g., books) this will be
   of limited usefulness. But if your planned project fits the mold, this
   publication will help you consider the questions that will be
   important to answer to be successful. - [40]RT

   (http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/erm0228.pdf). - "Expect to be
   hearing a lot about Web services in the coming year". That's how
   author Carl Jacobson begins this short review of an approach that
   increasing is gaining a lot of attention. Protocols have been
   developed that make it possible to mix and match information from
   disparate parts gathering them into new and customizable combinations.
   Google for example has recently announced the development of a set of
   hooks that go into its own database. Outside parties can use these
   hooks to dip into the resource and pull out results, formatting them
   according to local customs and needs. Hot stuff, or maybe just "hype",
   as the author posits. Of course, a little hype isn't necessarily a bad
   thing. The author manages to control his own sense of excitement long
   enough to go over some of the protocols involved plus explore a number
   of ways this intriguing new way of sharing and manipulating data can
   be put to use in the context of higher education. - [43]LRK

   Supplement to [46]Library Journal (Spring 2002): 28-29
   (http://libraryjournal.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&articl
   eid=CA210717). - Digital reference is one of the hottest topics in the
   library profession at the moment, but so far there has been precious
   little good, practical advice from those who have had real hands-on
   experience running full-blown digital reference services (not just
   email). That's why Kawakami's piece on the "nitty-gritty details" of
   running a digital reference service is so welcome. Kawakami outlines
   the lessons learned not just her experience running UCLA's service,
   but from other similar projects. All in all, this short piece is
   chock-full of good, practical advice based on experience. Any library
   thinking about, or actually implementing, a digital reference service
   would do well to pay close attention to what Kawakami has to say. -

   Institutional E-Print Archive" [49]Ariadne Issue 31 (March/April 2002)
   (http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue31/eprint-archives/). - Following the
   success of the e-print server [50]arXiv.org in helping to transform
   how high-energy physicists communicate their findings, a number of
   institutions, organizations, and scholars have considered how such a
   model could transform other disciplines. But so far the success of
   discipline-based archives, where faculty are expected to post their
   own work, has been spotty. An alternative to discipline-based archives
   are institutional-based archives, which are more likely to provide
   submission support for authors. In fact, the authors of this piece
   declare that mediated posting of articles (they suggest by library
   staff) is "more or less the only thing that works." Partly this may be
   due to the lengthy and complicated process to upload an article that
   the [51]eprints.org software they are using requires, but for some
   faculty it is unlikely that any computer-based process would be simple
   enough to be attractive. Although those who are considering setting up
   a repository using the eprints.org software will find the
   implementation details in this piece instructive, their discussion of
   issues such as how to answer faculty questions about such a project
   are more broadly applicable. - [52]RT

   - Yes, junk food is wonderful, but you'd better watch where you put
   that empty Pringles can. Some hacker could pick it out of your trash
   and concoct a homemade antenna he or she can use to hack into your
   wireless network. It's already old news that many wireless networks
   are far from secure; this article references a study by i-sec, a
   security firm, which found that "two-thirds of networks were doing
   nothing to protect themselves." An empty Pringles tube -- or coffee
   can, salted nuts tin, etc. -- can easily be turned into a directional
   (Yagi) antenna that can find vulnerable networks. "In one 30-minute
   journey using the Pringles can antenna, witnessed by BBC News Online,
   i-sec managed to find almost 60 wireless networks." Some suggestions
   given by i-sec to harden wireless network security: change default
   names, move access points to the center of a building or complex,
   switch off network broadcast functions. - [55]SK
