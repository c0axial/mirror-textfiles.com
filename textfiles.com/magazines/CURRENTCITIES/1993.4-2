EDUCOM Review. "Establishment of the GPO WINDO/Gateway: An
Interview: EDUCOM Review Speaks with William H. Grave and Richard
West." EDUCOM Review 28(1) (January/February 1993):43-46.  Graves
and West present their views on the best way for the Government
Printing Office (GPO) to be sure that there is some method at
work as more and more government data is published electronically.
The GPO needn't be the publisher, but should act as a coordinator,
require standards of usage (e.g., Z39.50) and access for
publishers of public information, and maintain a directory of
public information databases. - DR
 
 
Hyper- and Multimedia
 
Davis, Ben. "Looking and Learning Through Computers"  EDUCOM 
Review 28(1) (January/February 1993):20-25.  MIT's Center for
Educational Computing Initiatives (CECI) is following up on 
the work of Project Athena's Visual Computing Group with a
number of interesting projects for delivery of multimedia
services to educational users.  In addition to pursuing large-
scale development of platform, services and multimedia
implementations, CECI and the AthenaMuse Software Consortium 
(AMSC) are developing specific projects in media literacy,
 online documentation, a visual archive, and several social
sciences fields. - MT
 
FitzGerald, Michael and Henry Olsen.  "Genesis of a Multimedia
Social Sciences Curriculum"  EDUCOM Review 28(1) (January/
February 1993):36-41.  As part of the CUNY projects described
below by Wagner and Picciano, the Medgar Evers College received
grants to fund multimedia courseware in the social sciences, 
producing works in sociological theory, black history, women's
studies and psychology.  The grant process, hardware and
software selection, and the specific projects themselves are 
described in detail. - MT
 
Flanders, Bruce. "Hypertext Multimedia Software: Bell Atlantic
DocuSource"  Computers in Libraries 13(1) (January 1993):35-39.
Flanders provides a thorough description of Bell Atlantic's 
DocuSource system which provides online text and image
management for large volumes of information.  A wedding of OWL
International's multimedia technologies with text conversion 
software from Avalanche and Bell Atlantic's own graphical
interface, full-text searching and other capabilities make up
the DocuSource system which can operate as a stand-alone system
or run on a LAN.  Several projects that were submitted as part
of a "DocuSource Use in Education" contest are described and 
the features of the system are detailed as well. - MT
 
Heid, Jim.  "Sound Advice"  Macworld 10(3) (March 1993):118-123. 
As part of Macworld's Special Multimedia Guide, this article 
addresses the incorporation of sound into multimedia
presentations.  Several products are evaluated and tips offered
in recording, editing, saving and employing sound files. 
Enhancements to off-the-shelf hardware are suggested for those
who seek professional quality results. - MT
 
Morgan, Eric Lease. "Implementing TCP/IP Communications with
HyperCard"  Information Technology and Libraries 11(4)  (December
1992):421-432.  In this tutorial, Morgan describes two HyperCard
stacks that will assist the Macintosh user in using networked
information resources.  Mini-Atlas automates the process for
accessing the Geographic Name Server and stores the retrieved
data in records that can be further manipulated on the local 
terminal.  The ListManager allows users to search LISTSERV
archives with ease and to perform other LISTSERV operations.  
Appendices include the HyperTalk scripts for these stacks, which
can be modified to suit other networked information resource 
activities. - MT
 
Nordgren, Layne. "Evaluating Multimedia CD-ROM Discware: Of 
Bells, Whistles and Value"  CD-ROM Professional 6(1) (January
1993):99-105.  A number of useful criteria for the evaluation
of multimedia platforms and products are discussed in this
article which ties the review of multimedia to other software
reviews.  A survey of review methodologies for similar materials
contributes to the author's work in this area and a strategy for
proceeding in an organized way through the process of evaluating
multimedia products will prove helpful to those responsible for
the selection of multimedia information sources in a library.

Schaller, Anne. "Multimedia: A Glossary"  CD-ROM Professional
6(1) (January 1993):106-111.  From ADPCM to YUV color system,
this glossary from Intel includes a great deal of information
about multimedia concepts.  A short bibliography of sources 
used in compiling the work is included.  This glossary is
likely to be very useful when trying to evaluate systems based
on vendor literature. - MT
 
Sheng, Samuel, Anantha Chandrakasan, and R. W. Brodersen  "A
 Portable Multimedia Terminal"  IEEE Communications Magazine
30(12) (December 1992):64-75.  A technical paper on the
capabilities that will be expected of portable multimedia
machine, this paper provides an exciting look at what may be 
just around the corner for portables.  The terminals should 
access large commercial data services and digital video services,
provide for pen or voice input and will support distributed 
computing through a system like X- Windows.  Critical elements
will be the wireless link for communications and a further
reduction in size and weight with a concurrent increase in
battery longevity. - MT
 
Soloway, Elliot, Mark Guzdial, and Kenneth E. Hay.  "Reading and
Writing in the 21st Century"  EDUCOM Review 28(1) (January/
February 1993):26-29.  An exciting future lies ahead for the 
integration of images, sounds and animation along with text for
scholarly publication.  A University of Michigan multimedia 
document processor, MediaText, allows students to create
interactive documents incorporating multimedia with ease.  The
challenge of making multimedia authoring a seamless part of 
scholarly research seems well in hand with projects of this kind.

Wagner, Collete A. and Anthony G. Picciano.  "The View From 
Within" EDUCOM Review 28(1) (January/February 1993):30-35. 
Wagner and Picciano detail two perspectives on the development of
multimedia courseware emerging from a joint effort between City
University of New York and the Academic Information Systems 
division of IBM.  CUNY maintains a diverse array of multimedia
ventures among its many campuses and a number of exciting
projects are being developed within the social sciences,
humanities and sciences.  Administrative support enabled faculty
participants to focus on their individual course proposals and
despite a modest budget, several impressive courses were
developed using Toolbook software. - MT
 
 
Networks and Networking
 
"AT&T Will Provide Directory & Database Services to the National
Science Foundation NSFNET" AT&T Press Release (January 5, 1993)
posted on NETTRAIN@UBVM (January 27, 1993).  AT&T announces that
it has signed a cooperative agreement with the NSF to develop and
maintain an Internet Directory of Directories covering FTP sites,
white and yellow pages services, library catalogs, archives, and
other servers.  AT&T will work cooperatively with CERFNet and
Network Solutions, Inc. to form INTERNIC which will manage the
service.  Included in this press release is the NSF statement on
user fees for the service (applicable to those outside the US
research and education community).  See also, Calcari in Current
Cites 4(1) (January 1993). - DR
 
Coalition for Networked Information. Fall 1992 Meeting of the
Task Force: Summary Report. December 7, 1992. 7p. [Available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.cni.org in directory
/CNI/tf.meetings/1992b.fall or by sending e-mail to joan@cni.org
or calling the Coalition at (202)232-2466.]  This brief report
provides a look at the numerous discussions and presentations
that further CNI's goal of fostering networked resources and 
services that benefit the scholarly community.  Topics include:
The Transformational Potential of Networked Information,
Aesthetics of Visualization, Architectures for High-Performance
Networked Information Resources and Services, NREN Public Policy
Framework, and Project Big Ideas.  Paul Evan Peters, Executive
Director of the Coalition, introduced the new Project Big Ideas
which aims to take advantage of the new presidential
administration and provide a forum to "frame and realize the 
potential for progress in the current situation." - DR
 
Computer Systems Policy Project. Perspectives on the National
Information Infrastructure: CSPP's Vision and Recommendations for
Action. Washington, DC : The Project, January 12, 1993. 17p. 
[Copies of this report are available from Pam Fandel at  (202)
662-8403.]  This report outlines the recommendations of the CSPP
to the Clinton administration, the congress, and the computer,
telecommunications, and information industries for the
development of the national information infrastructure (NII). 
While the CSPP is composed of the biggest players in the computer
industry (Apple, AT&T, Compaq, Control Data, Cray, Data General,
Digital, HP, IBM, Silicon Graphics, Sun, Tandem, and Unisys), the
perspective of the report does not seem to be fatally limited by
the lack of participants from outside the industry.  Among other
ideas, the CSPP proposes the creation of both an NII Council 
chaired by the Vice President "to provide a management focus" and
include the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy and the Chairman of the FCC as 
well as an NII Implementation Entity to coordinate, manage, and
focus research and implementations of high-speed networks and
services. - DR
 
Keays, Thomas. "Searching Online Database Services Over the 
Internet" ONLINE 17(1) (January 1993):29-33.  Keays explains why
using fee-based services over the Internet can save money and be
more flexible.  Included are tips for getting the most mileage
out of networked searching as well as instructions and addresses
for logging on to the following systems: EPIC and FirstSearch,
NEXIS/LEXIS, ORBIT, RLIN, and STN.  Of course, you'll still need
an account to use these systems, but your telecom charges  will
most likely be lower. - DR
 
Ladner, Sharyn J. and Hope N. Tillman. "Using the Internet for
Reference" ONLINE 17(1) (January 1993):45-51.  Ladner and Tillman
provide a full analysis of the data they collected on the use of
networked resources in the provision of information upon request
by special librarians.  The results presented here indicate that
communication (i.e., e-mail), and in particular, electronic 
discussion lists, is the most important aspect of their network
use.   The collapsing of distances and virtual communities that
have developed over the net have brought great changes to the way
these librarians do business. - DR
 
Markoff, John. "Building the Electronic Superhighway" The New
York Times 142(49221) (January 24, 1993):Sect.3, 1, 6 (Western
edition).  Markoff presents a remarkably clear analysis of the
debate over whether the National Information Infrastructure 
should be built by the private or public sector, "who will own it
and how it will be regulated."  Markoff presents Vice President
Gore as one of the major proponents of the publicly funded
network and Robert Allen of AT&T as one of the major proponents
of the privately funded network.  In addition to the positions
these major players, Markoff explains why the Electronic Frontier
Foundation supports a privately funded ISDN implementation of the
national network. - DR
 
"NREN Hearing" ALAWON: ALA Washington Office Newsline 2(5)
(February 5, 1993).  [For information on back issues, send the
e-mail message "send ala-wo filelist" to listserv@uicvm or to
listserv@uicvm.uic.edu.]  ALA's Washington Office reports on the
February 2nd hearing before the House Science Subcommittee on
high-performance computing and networking.  A number of
 witnesses testified, including Robert Hetrick of EDUCOM,
Mitchell Kapor of the EFF, and Sara Parker representing ALA.
The witnesses testified in support of increasing access to the
network both among institutions of higher education as well
as K-12. - DR
 
Peters, Paul Evan. "Technology, Scholarship, and the Humanities"
EDUCOM Review 28(1) (January/February 1993):16-18.  Peters
briefly summarizes the recommendations of the participants in the
national conference on information technology in the humanities
organized by the Getty Art History Information Program and the
American Council of Learned Societies and cosponsored by CNI, the
Council on Library Resources, and the Research Libraries Group.
Conference participants made numerous proposals for increasing
the availability of electronic texts and other resources to
scholars in the humanities, as well as increasing the involvement
of humanists in creating those resources.  A full report of the
proceedings is due out soon. - DR
 
Proceedings of the NREN Workshop: Monterey, California, September
16-18, 1992 / sponsored by Computing Research Association,
EDUCOM, IEEE U.S. Activities Board, with assistance from the 
National Science Foundation, c1992.  239p. Available from EDUCOM
for $10 (send a check payable to EDUCOM to Elizabeth Barnhart,
EDUCOM, 1112 16th St. NW, Suite 600, Wash. D.C. 20036).  This
September workshop allowed for numerous Internet/NREN
constituencies to gather and come to some consensus on what they
thought the development of network should be.  Among their
findings is the notion that the NREN should be considered not a
specific network or even an internetwork, but a program for 
developing the National Information Infrastructure.  The bulk of
the report (over 200 pages) is an appendix composed of the
position papers of the participating organizations (e.g., the
American Library Association, Advanced Network Services, the  
Association of Research Libraries, AT&T, the Coalition for
Networked Information, and the Library of Congress).  These 
proceedings help us, and hopefully the US government, understand
some of the possibilities of the NREN's future. - DR
 
 
Optical Disc Technologies
 
Allen, Dennis. "CD-ROM: Now is the Time" BYTE 18(2) (February
1993):12.  BYTE's editor-in-chief heralds the debut of the
recordable CD-ROM drive (see Udell below) as "every bit as
revolutionary as was the Gutenberg press."  He urges those
without CD-ROM drives to buy one.  He tells companies to outfit
all their personal computers with a CD-ROM drive.  Furthermore,
he says it is unconscionable for computer manufacturers not to
include CD-ROM drives in their new systems. - TR
 
Desmarais, Norman. "CD-ROM Expo Features New Drives and Titles"
CD-ROM Librarian 7(11) (December 1992):24-33. Desmarais reports
on the CD-ROM Expo held in Boston last fall.  As the title
suggests, this article summarizes the ever-improving new drives,
many of which include support for multimedia applications, and
the expanding number of software titles currently available on
the market.  The range of titles include guides to power
negotiating, national parks, and even a history of the
technological innovations of IBM (!). - TR
 
Udell, Jon. "Start the Presses" BYTE 18(2) (February 1993):116-
134.  Udell describes a revolutionary breakthrough in the CD-ROM
industry: recordable CD-ROM drives (CD-R), retailing for under
$10,000.  This type of new and affordable do-it-yourself CD-ROM
publishing is predicted to shift the electronic publishing
revolution into high gear.  This article explains the technology,
comparing it to existing optical disc technologies it may well
replace and discusses the impact it will have on the industry. 
Informative sidebars include a "colorful" explanation of CD  
standards and an overview of affordable CD-R drives. - TR
 
Weide, Janice. "CD-ROM Reference Survey" CD-ROM Librarian 7(11)
(December 1992):45-49.  Weide provides a useful, selective rather
than exhaustive, list of electronic reference tools available on
CD-ROM.  The list is particularly well-suited for public
libraries.  The list is divided into the following sections: 
bibliographies, encyclopedias, general periodical indexes,
newspapers and current events, dictionaries and thesauri, science
and technology, directories and business information, music, art
and literature, geography and atlases, and biographies. - TR 
 
 
Emerging Technologies
 
BYTE 18(2) (February 1993).  BYTE's State of the Art column 
focuses on wireless data communications, which Mello and Wayner 
predict will be commonplace within three years.  Also included 
are numerous sidebars as well as a one-page resource guide for 
obtaining wireless services.
 
o    Mello, John P. Jr. and Peter Wayner. "Wireless Mobile
Communications: The Infrastructure for Ubiquitous Wireless Data
Communications is Rapidly Expanding" pp.147-154.  Mello and 
Wayner bring some much-needed clarity to the description of the
emerging set of wireless technologies.  In competition are
cellular services (analog and digital packet-switched), radio
frequency digital services, guard band transmission, satellite
connections, as well as other local and national network
implementations.
 
o    Ryan, Bob. "Communications Get Personal: AT&T Unveils
its Plan for the Personal Communications Revolution" pp.169-176. 
Ryan describes AT&T's plans for their personal communicator which
combines the Go Corporation's PenPoint operating system and 
AT&T's Hobbitt chip specifically designed for low power and  high
performance.  The article does get fairly technical in its
description of the instruction processing architecture of the
Hobbitt chip.  Also included are descriptions of Apple's Newton
and the two EO communicators for comparison.
 
o    Wayner, Peter. "Stretching the Ether: How Wireless
Technologies Make the Most of Limited Bandwidth" pp.159-165.  
Wayner goes into some depth in describing specific areas of 
wireless network development.  Included in this article is a 
discussion of calling cells and their configuration; cellular
digital packet data (CDPD);  time division multiple access (TDMA)
and code division multiple access (CDMA) which both allow more
data throughput per channel; and Teatherless Access Ltd. (TAL)
which hopes to provide an Internet-like packet radio network 
where each user acts as sender, receiver, and router.  TAL's 
dream is to put "a transceiver on every home." - DR
