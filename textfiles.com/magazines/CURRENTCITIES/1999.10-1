   Editor's Note: Commencing with our tenth year of publication, Current
   Cites will no longer use subject/category headings. As the world of
   information technology has evolved over the past ten years, it is
   becoming increasingly difficult, and often times impossible, to assign
   our citations into one distinct category. More often than not,
   citations touch upon many categories; for example, a digital library
   article will often discuss electronic publishing and networking issues
   as well. We encourage the use of our Bibliography-On-Demand service,
   (http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/CurrentCites/bibondemand.cgi) which
   enables readers to construct subject-specific bibliographies from the
   Current Cites database of bibliographic citations.

   - I recommend the entire January issue of Inc. because it reflects the
   business world's concern with information overload and how to handle
   it; this particular article is cited because librarians need to know
   when they're being appreciated. Amid editorial comments about "taming
   the info beast" and "the unbearable glutness of being" we have this
   profile of a corporate librarian who is highly valued for her ability
   to confront the chaos and extract what's valuable. CEO Duncan
   Highsmith meets regularly with the librarian, Lisa Guedea Carreno, to
   draw upon her mastery of information systems and, more importantly,
   her ability to synthesize and make cognitive connections in ways that
   no software can. Highsmith felt that he had missed golden
   opportunities through ignorance of coming trends, and he uses the
   meetings with his librarian to ensure that never happens again.

   woman's skills are the yardstick against which your products will be

   Chilvers, Alison and John Feather. "The Management of Digital Data: A
   Metadata Approach" The Electronic Library 16 (6) (December, 1998):
   365-372. - If you're concerned and frustrated about the preservation
   of digital data, Chilvers and Feather remind you that you are not
   alone. This article is a preliminary report from their research on the
   role of metadata in helping organizations effectively preserve data.
   The authors use a case study approach, conducting semi-structured
   interviews with key players in the information community (including
   major data creators, and users in the science and financial services
   industries, along with libraries and archives). Not surprisingly, the
   initial interviews reveal that organizations face many challenges as
   they attempt to achieve long-term preservation of digital data. With
   little research on the longterm preservation of many digital record
   types, some key concerns include the variety of metadata formats, the
   prevalence of embryonic, fragmentary and variable organizational
   policies, and the lack of trust in 3rd party preservation. Their
   research also highlights the increased importance of selection
   mechanisms for long-term preservation. While the authors note that
   organizational goals drive the parameters for the preservation of
   digital data, they stress the need for a coordinated approach to
   metadata (or "super-metadata") which is the ongoing subject of their
   research. - LY
   
   Doran, Kelly. "Metadata for a Corporate Intranet" Online 23(1)
   (January 1999) :42-50. - Much of what we read about metadata, at least
   here in the groves of academe, is on the "megameta" level - policy and
   standards with a large scope. In contrast, this article is about an
   application of metadata to solve a common real-life problem: finding
   anything in an organization's forest of online resources, which
   sprouted haphazardly over many years. The author is an Electronic
   Information Specialist at Weyerhauser, which has thousands of
   employees scattered around the United States and Canada. She describes
   the development of a plan, a controlled vocabulary and a metadata
   generator program which data owners use to tag their documents with
   the HTML <META> tag (not XML; she explains why in a sidebar). Though
   the text of this article is not offered at the Online website, two
   related ones are offered there and in the magazine: "Metadata:
   Cataloging by Any Other Name"
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL1999/milstead1.html) and
   "Metadata Projects and Standards"
   (http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/OL1999/milstead1.html#projects).
   Kudos to the editors of Online for including three articles on
   metadata in a special section devoted to intranets, because it makes
   the point that without data about your data, you're lost in the woods
   without a compass. - JR
   
   Guernsey, Lisa. "California State U. Tries to Create a New Way to Buy
   Online Journals" Chronicle of Higher Education 65 (20) (January 22,
   1999): A18. - This article describes California State University's
   statewide initiative to create a digital library of electronic
   journals. CSU has announced a request for proposals to attract the
   attention of large publishers who will bid on the opportunity to
   provide e-journals. Although CSU hope to be able to "pick and choose,"
   there remains some concern about blanket coverage. For example, even
   if all offerings from UMI, Gale and Information Access Co. were
   included, a full 30 percent of the university's journal titles would
   not be covered. To fill the gap, many smaller licenses would be
   needed. - TH
   
   Lankes, R. David Building and Maintaining Internet Information
   Services: K-12 Digital Reference Services Syracuse, NY: ERIC
   Clearinghouse on Information & Technology, 1998. - This volume is the
   doctoral dissertation of the co-founder of the famous "AskERIC"
   service (see http://ericir.sunsite.syr.edu/), David Lankes. Lankes
   has been involved with providing digital reference service for some
   time, and therefore is no stranger to the issues involved. But the
   usefulness of this volume does not rest on his experiences alone, but
   the accumulated experiences of many individuals and organizations
   presently offering digital reference services. Lankes thoroughly
   surveyed the field, interviewed the practitioners, and mapped their
   process of question answering. These models of interaction were then
   boiled down to a standard model for this kind of service. This
   thorough and thoughtful treatment of this topic will no doubt form the
   foundation of the literature in this emerging field for some time to
   come. - RT
   
   Lipow, Anne G. "Serving the Remote User: Reference Service in the
   Digital Environment" Proceedings of the Ninth Australasian
   Information Online & On Disc Conference and Exhibition, Sydney, 19-21
   January 1999
   (http://www.csu.edu.au/special/online99/proceedings99/200.htm). - If
   you are a librarian, read this keynote speech. If have anything to do
   with providing library reference service, commit it to memory. Lipow
   makes a compelling case for rethinking how we provide assistance to
   library users, and advocates that we should provide reference service
   to information seekers "at the place where they are when they have a
   question." The fact that information seekers are increasingly
   somewhere outside a library when they get stuck is the problem, and
   Lipow asserts that we must get better -- much better -- at serving
   their needs. Lipow's perceptions of the problems and the possible
   solutions she describes have partly emerged from an effort spearheaded
   by the Library of Congress to address the issue of providing
   appropriate reference service in a digital environment. Even if you
   don't agree with her suggested solutions for providing "in-your-face
   reference service" you owe it to yourself and the profession to
   consider carefully the implications of not implementing what she (and
   others) suggest. I have, and I can assure you it isn't pretty. - RT
   
   Proceedings of the Ninth Australasian Information Online & On Disc
   Conference and Exhibition, Sydney, 19-21 January 1999
   (http://www.csu.edu.au/special/online99/proceedings99/). - The
   proceedings of this conference are a treasure-trove of reports on
   interesting projects and think-pieces on important topics (see the
   citation in this issue for "Serving the Remote User"). Australia is
   blessed with a cadre of professional librarians on the cutting edge of
   technological change, and these proceedings exhibit some small part of
   what they are accomplishing, often with very little attention from the
   rest of the world. You will also find some presentations from token
   Americans as well (Anne Lipow, Peter Lyman, Greg Notess, Marydee
   Ojala, and others). - RT
   
   Stalder, Felix. "Beyond Portals and Gifts: Towards a Bottom-up
   Net-economy" First Monday 4 (1) (January 4, 1999)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue4_1/stalder/) - Stalder argues
   that the Internet is a victim of its own promise: the liberation of
   information. He views the vaguely utopian rhetoric that drives much
   popular thought about the Internet as "a strange hybrid of 60's
   progressive libertarianism and 90's aggressive venture capitalism."
   The slogan "information wants to be free" still shapes the dynamics of
   online content consumption and production, which has caused Internet
   portals to shift their revenue strategy from "selling to the audience"
   to "selling the audience." Moreover, much of the activity that occurs
   on the Internet is non-economic, such as providing directions or
   cooking recipes; Stalder regards this kind of activity as
   fundamentally social, and so it eludes economic formulae and notions.
