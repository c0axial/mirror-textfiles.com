   Bilal, Dania, Jeff Barry & W. David Penniman. "A Balancing Act"
   Library Journal 124(6) (April 1, 1999): 45-54. - This article is LJ's
   annual picture of the automated systems marketplace. 1998 is depicted
   as a year of partnerships, and the authors describe the ways in which
   vendors and customers are working together to address such problems as
   planning for new interfaces while living with old closed systems,
   checking for Y2K readiness, and creating Web-based services. After the
   overview, 27 vendors are profiled. Tables include microcomputer system
   sales, server-based system sales, academic, school and public library
   system sales and others. - JR
   
   Coffman, Steve. "Building Earth's Largest Library: Driving Into the
   Future" Searcher 7(3) (March 1999)
   (http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/mar/coffman.htm). - Every once in a
   while an article comes along that sparks your imagination, or provides
   the missing piece to a puzzle, or spurs a moment of "ah-ha!" insight.
   For me, this is just such a piece. In this article Coffman paints a
   compelling vision of a library catalog system that is accessible,
   convenient, personal, and _huge_. Using Amazon.com as his inspiration,
   Coffman wonders why libraries can't band together and do something
   similar, only better. I can't help thinking the same thing. Sorry,
   patient Current Cites readers, you're going to have to read this one
   yourself. I really can't do it justice in one paragraph, and frankly I
   can't think of any librarian who shouldn't read this. If you think you
   are such a person, drop me a line. I'd like to know why. - RT
   
   Hedstrom, Margaret and Sheon Montgomery. Digital Preservation Needs
   and Requirements in RLG Member Institutions Mountain View, CA:
   Research Libraries Group, December 1998
   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/digpres.html). - This study commissioned
   by the Research Libraries Group (RLG) was to determine the status of
   digital archiving at its member institutions. Fifty-four libraries
   responded, and fifteen participated in supplementary interviews. While
   fully 98% of the responding libraries expect to be preserving digital
   material by 2001 if they are not doing so already, almost half lack
   "the capacity to mount, read, or access files on some of the storage
   media they hold." The service most libraries look to consortia to
   provide is the development of standards and best practices;
   third-party vendors, on the other hand, are expected to provide
   migration and conversion services. The report ends with
   recommendations based on the findings of the survey for RLG, member
   institutions, and service providers. - RT
   
   Kiernan, Vincent. "An Ambitious Plan to Sell Electronic Books:
   University Librarians and Press Officials See Promise and Possible
   Pitfalls in the Concept" Chronicle of Higher Education 65(32) (April
   16, 1999): A27. - A Colorado-based firm is embarking on a venture to
   sell electronic books to university libraries, and some university
   press officials say the new program is "the most promising experiment
   with e-books yet." The product is called netLibrary
   (http://www.netlibrary.com), and it already has 2,000 titles on its
   list. Library officials are quoted in more cautionary tones, but
   powerful agencies like CARL and OhioLink are charter customers. - TH
   
   Kiernan, Vincent. "Two Big Libraries Abandon Home-Grown Software for
   Commercial Products" Chronicle of Higher Education April 14, 1999. -
   This article describes recent developments at the Library of Congress
   and National Library of Medicine in cataloging policy. Both libraries
   are shifting their cataloging activity to commercial products, hoping
   to cut overhead and streamline work processes. Current arrangements at
   LC can involve searches in as many as three databases to confirm
   holdings and veracity, so the library is also trying to solve legacy
   system challenges at the same time it is updating work practices. - TH
   
   
   Seadle, Michael. "The Raw and the Cooked Among Librarians" Library
   HiTech 16 (3-4) (1998): 7-11. - In this introduction to Library Hi
   Tech's special issue on digital libraries, Seadle posits how
   librarians can use anthropological methods and theories to examine
   library systems in fresh, new ways. He notes that as our language has
   yet to catch up to modern technology, we tend to gravitate towards
   physical metaphors to describe digital artifacts, such as "electronic
   library." While helpful in their familiarity, these metaphors can skew
   user expectations and conceal new technology-based capabilities.
   Seadle's observations are insightful and foreshadow the organizational
   themes which dominate the electronic text and information technology
   center profiles in this article series. - LY
   
   Stokes, John R. "Imaging Pictorial Collections at the Library of
   Congress" RLG DigiNews 3(2) (April 15, 1999)
   (http://www.rlg.org/preserv/diginews/diginews3-2.html). - The Library
   of Congress is one of the few institutions that has the resources to
   outsource the digitization of a quarter of a million images. But
   nonetheless, this account of such a project will likely be fascinating
   to anyone who digitizes pictorial material. Judging from the
   accompanying photographs, a phenomenal amount of work was accomplished
   in what appears to be a space not much larger than an elongated
   closet. But what is most fascinating are the decisions that were made
   along the way and the reasons for them. There is little enough of this
   kind of nitty-gritty information around, so digital librarians (and
   those who aspire) should take a good look. - RT
   
   Stubbs, Walter and Eric Wettstein. "U.S. GPO CD-ROMS: Blessing or
   Curse?" Journal of Government Information 26(2) (March/April 1999):
   131-163. - Federal legislators see it as a painless method of
   streamlining government, and librarians know what headaches it can
   cause: the push for a more electronic Depository Library System has
   resulted in a Tower of Babel of Government Printing Office CD-ROMs.
   The authors surveyed 205 federal depository libraries in 1996, with a
   lengthy questionnaire about 156 CD-ROM titles. The statistics derived
   can't be seen as overwhelmingly conclusive about much of anything,
   because only 70 usable responses were received, and a lot has changed
   in three years. However, this study sheds light on what librarians
   found useful, why some disks were avoided like the plague, and if and
   when the Web was preferred. Particular attention is paid to the
   advantages and disadvantages of the many varieties of enabling
   software required to run these disks. Comments from depository
   librarians are included. - JR
   
   Weibel, Stuart. "The State of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative,
   April 1999" D-Lib Magazine 5(4) (April 1999)
   (http://www.dlib.org/dlib/april99/04weibel.html). - The effort to
   define a basic set of metadata elements for Internet resource
   discovery has been ongoing for years. In this report, the leader of
   the Dublin Core effort describes the current state of affairs and
   identifies six areas where participants are currently focusing their
   efforts. The six areas are: formalization of a process for the Dublin
   Core, standardization, HTML encoding, qualification mechanisms, the
   role of RDF, and relationships to other metadata models. For those
   wanting to follow this effort, either as an observer or a participant,
   the references for this piece point to some essential current
   resources. - RT
   
   Young, Jeffrey R. "Three Research Libraries Plan Vast New Facility to
   Store Little-Used Books" Chronicle of Higher Education April 6, 1999.
   - Columbia, The New York Public Library and Princeton are pooling
   resources to build a single off-site storage facility in the Bronx,
   and it will be a big one. This article describes the project, which is
   cast as a defining moment in inter-university collaboration on a very
   large scale. Princeton's provost makes several insightful comments
   about library planning, to wit, "In the past, [collection development]
   has been an area where many universities sought to compete, rather
   than cooperate with each other to provide the very best service."
   Other joint initiatives, such as digitization of material, may follow
   in time. - TH
