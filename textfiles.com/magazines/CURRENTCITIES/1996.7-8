Dietz, Steve & Margaretta Sander. "Unlocking Museum Information 
with SGML" Spectra (http://world.std.com/~mcn/): Journal of the 
Museum Computer Network 23(4)(Summer 1996): 16-17. -- A concise, 
informative introduction to the benefits of applying the SGML 
(Standard Generalized Markup Language) standard for electronic 
publishing and document management. The article will be a useful 
resource for any type of organization considering its document 
access needs; the writers cite examples of successful 
applications in the museum world for illustration of how SGML can 
work in the real world. -- RR
  
Harter, Stephen P. "The Impact of Electronic Journals on Scholarly
Communication: A Citation Analysis." The Public-Access Computer 
Systems Review 7(5) (1996). 
(http://info.lib.uh.edu/pr/v7/n5/hart7n5.html) -- Electronic
journals have been available on the Internet for years, but there 
have been few studies on their impact on scholarly communication. 
This citation study attempts to answer that key question by 
comparing citation statistics of electronic journals begun prior to 
1993 with citation statistics of print journals. The author 
concludes that "the great majority of scholarly, peer-reviewed 
e-journals have had essentially no impact on scholarly 
communication in their respective fields," but nonetheless 
acknowledges that this is the case partly due to publishing far 
fewer articles, in general, then their print counterparts. 
Therefore, even though the overall impact of e-journals appears to 
be slight, the impact of the typical e-journal article is high. Of 
all the e-journals examined in this study, PACS Review (in the 
field of library and information science) emerged as the most 
successful. -- RT

John, Nancy R. "Putting Content on the Internet: The Library's 
Role as Creator of Electronic Information" First Monday 1(2)
(http://www.first.monday.dk) -- The University of Illinois-Chicago 
launched a large scale project to offer digital libraries with four 
partners, including the Chicago Public Library, the U.S. Department 
of State, the Illinois State Archives, and Pemberton Press. The 
project is titled the "Great Cities Initiative," and the goal is to
leverage academic library skill in the greater context of the urban
community. Each project varied according to the "content" of the 
partner institution, with Illinois-Chicago coordinating the overall 
shape of the service. The author reviews the development, 
challenges and future prospects of the collaborative venture, which 
seem bright. Since launching the project the Illinois-Chicago 
library has also become the publisher of an online journal titled 
the AIDS Book Review Journal, further evidence of a strong 
commitment to digital collections. -- TH

MacEwan, Bonnie, and Mira Geffner. "The Committee on Institutional
Cooperation Electronic Journals Collection (CIC-EJC): A New Model 
for Library Management of Scholarly Journals Published on the 
Internet" The Public-Access Computer Systems Review 7(4) (1996).
(http://info.lib.uh.edu/pr/v7/n4/mace7n4.html) -- An overview of a
cooperative project to catalog, archive, and provide structured 
access to a collection of electronic journals. Access to all titles 
is provided by linking to the publisher's site, but they are also 
building an archive to serve as a permanent record should the 
original be destroyed or discontinued. The Web site provides for 
searching and browsing by topic or title. All journals in the 
collection are cataloged with standard MARC records that are 
distributed to OCLC and member institutions. The URL for each title 
is included in the 856 field of the MARC record to facilitate
access from the catalog record. Future plans include a Persistent 
URL (PURL) server. -- RT
 
"The Property of the Mind" The Economist 340 (7976) (July 27 -
August 2, 1996): 57-59. 
(http://www.economist.com/issue/27-07-96/wbsf1.html) -- For a 
clear look at the challenges facing intellectual property 
regulation in a global context, step beyond the U.S. debate and 
read this issue's feature article and leader, titled "Copyrights 
and Copywrongs" (p. 16). The Economist traces the development of 
copyright (Jefferson: "...he who lights his taper at mine 
receives light without darkening me") and analyzes the dramatic 
changes wrought by digital media. In effect, the Internet is one 
big copying machine, some argue, while others wish to hold to the 
Jeffersonian high ground. Meanwhile, most Americans (and many 
others too) feel that what they do (and digitally replicate) in 
the privacy of their own homes is no one else's business. UC 
Berkeley law professor Pamela Samuelson argues that the 
attitudes of the public ("Don't Tread On Me") and of publishers 
is moving farther apart. Although no strong solutions are in sight, 
Esther Dyson thinks original content could be enhanced, or perhaps 
publishers could discover new ways to make money from it. 
Unregulated recording at Grateful Dead concerts is one example of 
this, Netscape's long-lasting giveaway of its browser is another.

Stewart, Linda. "User Acceptance of Electronic Journals: Interviews
with Chemists at Cornell University" College and Research Libraries 
57(4) (July 1996): 339-349. -- Based on interviews with a group of 
students and faculty affiliated with the Cornell University 
Chemistry department who participated in a project that loaded the 
full text of twenty American Chemical Society (ACS) texts, this 
paper explores the potential of electronic journals to accomplish 
the scholarly role traditionally associated with printed journals. 
Important to participants in the study was ease-of-use and the 
ability to browse regardless of the format; most users felt that 
printed copies (or at least the ability to create a print copy) was 
important and some questioned whether electronic journals would 
allow them to discover articles serendipitously or read the 
articles in comfort (eyestrain and the awkwardness of reading in 
front of a terminal were cited as problems). On the other hand, 
participants thought that electronic journals would allow them to 
read more complete articles, spend their reading time more 
efficiently and read articles sooner. As libraries face the 
challenge of choosing between electronic and printed journals, this 
article offers an excellent snapshot of how academic users feel 
about electronic journals. Also helpful are the footnotes which 
cite some important research in this field. -- MP
 

Multimedia and Hypermedia

Nov'Art [ISSN: 1165-37x] -- This quarterly publication from France 
covers a range of issues in new media, usually from a conceptual 
or social angle rather than purely technical. The February 1996
issue (118pg), for instance, focused on writing and multimedia; 
articles ranged from the role of the artist in new media to the 
network blurring the line between spectator and actor. A website
is not listed, however you may contact them via email at:

Networks and Networking

Theme issue of _Computer_ on the U.S. Digital Library Initiative 
(May 1996) (http://www.computer.org/pubs/computer/dli/) -- This 
special issue covers the six digital library projects funded by 
the National Science Foundation.  An overview article entitled 
"Building Large-Scale Digital Libraries" (by Bruce Schatz and 
Hsinchun Chen) leads into articles on each of the six projects 
based at U.S. Universities:
 
Schatz, Bruce, et. al. "Federating Diverse Collections of 
Scientific Literature" (University of Illinois)
 
Wilensky, Robert. "Toward Work-Centered Digital Information 
Services" (University of California, Berkeley)

Wactlar, Howard D., et.al. "Intelligent Access to Digital Video:
Informedia Project" (Carnegie Mellon University)
 
Smith, Terence R. "A Digital Library for Geographically Referenced
Materials" (University of California, Santa Barbara)
 
Paepcke, Andreas, et. al. "Using Distributed Objects for Digital 
Library Interoperability" (Stanford University)
 
Atkins, Daniel E., et. al.  "Toward Inquiry-Based Education 
Through Interacting Software Agents" (University of Michigan)
 
The cutting-edge digital library research reported in these 
articles is interesting, but don't hold your breath waiting for 
much of it to appear in an application on your desktop. It is, 
after all, research, which need not concern itself with 
practicalities or products. -- RT

Library of Congress, 1996. -- This trio of Web documents provides 
the best source for practical, up-to-date advice on various aspects 
of building digital collections that will interoperate well with 
other such collections. They were drafted by the Library of 
Congress to provide guidelines for organizations competing in the 
LC/Ameritech National Digital Library Competition, but their 
utility goes far beyond that. For anyone who is involved with 
creating or managing digital collections, these documents provide 
important advice and assistance on some of the key decisions to be 
made as well areas of continuing ambiguity. You won't by any means 
find all the answers here, but you'll find a few as well as
many of the pertinent questions that must be answered before a true
National Digital Library can be a reality. -- RT

Gardner, Elizabeth. "Keeping Users Hot on Your Site's Trail"
WebWeek 2(6) (May 20, 1996): 48.
(http://www.webweek.com/96May20/undercon/webweaver.html)
-- This article introduces the idea of PURLs or "Persistent 
URLs" as a better way of identifying and locating webpages. 
URLs of course are dependent on the location of a specific 
filename at a specific machine, domain, and directory location. 
If any element in that structure changes, the document is as 
good as lost to most users, at least until all relevant links
are laboriously updated. OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) 
proposes to keep the URL's for web documents centrally on a 
local PURL server. Then when someone requests the page, the 
central PURL server sends them along to the document. This way, 
a user merely needs to know which online system a document 
resides at, and all updating of URL's happens at the location, by
the people who know best. While this is not quite the nirvana of 
each document having a unique identifier which travels with it, 
regardless of system, it would be quite an improvement to current 
document location systems, especially if PURL Servers could be 
networked and updated like newsgroup servers, so one need only ever 
find the local World-Wide PURL server to locate any document on the 
web. -- RR 

Varian, Hal. "Differential Pricing and Efficiency" First Monday 
1(2) (http://www.firstmonday.dk) -- Varian, an economist and 
Dean at UC Berkeley's School of Information Management and Systems, 
lays out the reasons why several core economic suppositions are 
turned upside down by digital media. Specifically, he argues that 
a key market concept--marginal pricing--is not relevant where 
digital media allows for increasing returns to scale, large fixed 
costs (such as telecommunications infrastructures) or economies of 
scope are at play. "Willingness to pay" is an equally important 
principle. The solution he argues, lies in differential pricing 
that can allow both forces to work in an inter-related fashion. 
Economists will enjoy the thorough treatment (with beautifully 
rendered graphics of economic formulae), while laymen will be able 
to follow Varian's plain English.  This is a useful guide to the
economic issues underlying impending commercial uses of the 
Internet. -- TH

Wilson, David. L. "Campus 'intranets' Make Information Available to 
Some but Not All, Internet Users" Chronicle of Higher Education 
62(47) (August 2, 1996): A15-A17. -- Higher education was the 
primary launching pad for Internet information systems (along with 
the defense industry), but higher education is just beginning to 
catch up the corporate sector in the development of "intranets." 
Where corporations have moved quickly to implement web-based 
internal services that are safe behind firewalls, higher education 
has moved more slowly, mainly due its open computing environment. 
The author explores several of the issues that arise when colleges 
seek to define who should and who should not have access to college 
intranets, and some of the technological challenges of distance 
learning and remote registration (to name just a couple issues).  
There's an interesting discussion of the downstream impact of 
choosing proprietary software (like Lotus Notes) over Internet 
software; and, according to many quoted, there's plenty of room for
improvement in all the options. -- TH
 

Information Technology & Society 
 
Reagle, Joseph M., Jr. "Trust in Electronic Markets: The 
Convergence of Cryptopgraphers and Economists" First Monday 1(2)
(http://www.firstmonday.dk) -- This is one of those studies that 
skillfully summarizes a tried-and-true "real world" function: the 
social and technical infrastructure of commerce, and then explores 
the impact of cyberspace on the status quo. Reagle poses the 
question of what is to be done in cyberspace, where none of the
stanchions of secure financial transactions have been fully worked 
out; clearly, it's not an area that can be safely left in the hands 
of either cryptographer or economists, when we all have a stake in 
the outcome. It's a fascinating article, for two reasons. First, 
Reagle lays out the things we take for granted, such as 
check-writing, security and deposits, and so on, reducing this 
universally accepted system to its most basic definition: it's just 
information. Second, Reagle writes speculatively about how to
transfer (or perhaps better said, invent) a similar system in 
cyberspace. You may not agree with some of the ideas (how about 
buying this nice "Digital Bearer Bond?"), but the analysis is 
cross-disciplinary, and grounded in an understanding of both 
society and human nature, and technology. -- TH
