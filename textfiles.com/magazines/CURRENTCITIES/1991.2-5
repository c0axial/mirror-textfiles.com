Expert Systems 
 
Belew, Richard K. "Artificial Life: A Constructive Lower Bound for  
Artificial Intelligence" IEEE Expert  6(1) (Feb. 1991):8-15.  The goal  
of Artificial Life (ALife) "is to abstract the 'logical form' of life" in  
order to understand and possibly create artificial life.  Unlike  
genetic engineering, ALife does not begin with organic matter,  
rather, like AI, its development occurs via computer.  Making the  
claim that "the dumbest smart thing you can do is stay alive," ALife  
considers itself to be a lower bound for the work of AI.  While this  
is not immediately relevant for the field of library and information  
science, this work does present itself as an interesting development  
in the current AI-related technologies. 
 
Tuthill, G. Steven "Legal Liabilities and Expert Systems" AI Expert  
6(3) (March 1991):45-51.  Mr. Tuthill briefly presents the potential  
areas of liability in knowledge programming.  While there has yet to  
be a great deal of AI-related court cases, he offers his view on the  
specific types of risk which are imminent in knowledge  
programming and suggests a corresponding seat of responsibility.   
This is an area that we, as information providers, will be very  
concerned with if we do indeed choose to develop expert systems. 
 
West, David M. and Larry E. Travis "The Computational Metaphor and  
Artificial Intelligence: A Reflective Examination of a Theoretical  
Falsework" AI Magazine 12(1) (Spring 1991):64-79.  An excellent  
article which discusses the role and importance of metaphor in  
science generally, and then focuses on the predominant metaphor of  
AI (the computational metaphor: computer as mind, mind as  
computer) West and Travis present an interesting assessment of the  
value and shortcomings of both this strongly challenged metaphor  
and of its alternatives. 
 
 
Hyper- and Multimedia 
  
Steffey, Ramona J. "Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia: Bringing  
Multimedia to the Masses" CD-ROM Professional  4(3) (May,  
1991):13-20.  A description and review of the award-winning  
multimedia encyclopedia from Britannica, which contains the full  
text of the 26-volume printed version integrated with images, maps  
and 60 minutes of sound.  A dictionary accompanies the work,  
rounding out a package that will set the standard for future  
products.  A variety of search tools leads the user through a chosen  
path that can include bookmarking of articles, cut and paste options  
and other features.   
 
Communications of the ACM  34(4) (April 1991).  An entire issue of  
this journal devoted to digital multimedia systems, with a number  
of very technical articles and some of more general interest.   
Standards are emerging for a number of multimedia tools, the most  
notable being from the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) and  
the Moving Picture coding Experts Group (MPEG).  Standards such as  
these will govern design of these aspects of multimedia and make  
development of products by individual companies more likely in the  
near future.  As common coding, compression and authoring  
standards are used in new products, further interest in the field  
becomes a better investment. 
 
 
Information Transfer 
 
Cornwell, Douglas W. "Downloading from Dialog into dBase III Plus"  
Online 15(3) (May 1991):91-93.  Cornwell details procedures for  
downloading records from Dialog to dBase III Plus using the Dialog  
Report function. 
 
Jackson, Mary E. "Library to Library" Wilson Library Bulletin  16(5)  
(April 1991):84-87.  Jackson describes the RLG Document  
Transmission Workstation (Ariel) its functions, capabilities, and its  
integration in ILL department procedures (with UCB as one of the  
test cites).  It's an improvement over the fax. 
 
 
Networks and Networking 
 
Dempsey, Lorcan Libraries, Networks and OSI: A Review of North  
American Developments. Bath: UK Office for Library Networking,  
1991.  [210] p. : ill.  ISBN 0951685600 (pbk), 0951685 600.  This  
book, is a detailed study of library application protocols for  
information retrieval and  interlibrary  loan, plus a  discussion of  
EDI, X400 and X500, and  their use  in library networking.  It covers  
developments both in the US and in Europe, and provides a  
fascinating European perspective on recent developments in the US.   
Considerable attention is given to policy and infrastructure Q  
resource sharing, the NREN movement, the Coalition for Networked  
Information -- and to existing projects, such as Carnegie-Mellon's  
project MERCURY, UC's MELVYL system, and CARL. -- Clifford Lynch 
 
Dictionary of Data Elements for Online Information Resources  
(MARBI Discussion Paper no. 49).  USMARC Advisory Committee,  
[199?] Distributed by CNIDIR-L@UNMVM.BITNET.  This paper, up for  
discussion at ALA in Atlanta (7/1/91 2:00-5:30), is a look at where  
the MARC format is heading with respect to online information  
resources.  Using Berkeley's own GLADIS OPAC as an example (among  
others) we can see how these resources can be cataloged to give the  
fullest and most useful access.  Just trying to cite the paper itself  
has heightened my appreciation of the issue! 
 
Hall, Stephen C. "The Four Stages of National Research and Education  
Network Growth" EDUCOM Review 26(1) (Spring 1991):18-25.  In this  
article Hall describes the projected growth of the NREN by looking at  
the history of computing and the needs of the network's  
constituencies.  According to Hall, we are in stage IIQgrowthQ with  
the stages of reduced or controlled growth (a privatized network)  
and maturity (a public network) to follow. 
 
Jacobsen, O. and D. Lynch A Glossary of Networking Terms . Interop,  
Inc., March 1991. Network Working Group RFC 1208.  This 18 page  
glossary covers terms of the more technical aspects of networking,  
as well as the numerous acronyms.  Very handy for someone delving  
into the networking world.  Available via anonymous ftp from  
nnsc.nsf.net (128.89.1.178) with pathname rfc/rfc1208.txt.
 
Michalak, Thomas J. and Thomas Kirk "Coalition for Networked  
Information Maps Directions" C&R Libraries News  52(4) (April  
1991):229-230.  Michalak and Kirk point out that CNI is becoming the  
"primary forum for discussing development of a national computer  
network and capabilities for publishing and sharing information  
electronically."  The Coalition has organized seven working groups to  
focus on specific issues: non-commercial publishing; commercial  
publishing; architecture and standards; legislation, codes, policies  
and practices; directories and resource information services;  
teaching and learning; and management and professional and user  
education. 
 
"Network Management" BYTE  16(3) (March 1991):154-219.  Actually  
this is a group of seven articles and a resource guide providing some  
of the latest information on managing a LAN.  Perhaps the most  
interesting article is Peter Stephenson's "Mixing and Matching LANs"  
(pages 155-164) where one can learn the in's and out's of  
interconnecting heterogeneous networks. 
 
Pool, Ithiel de Sola Technologies Without Boundaries: on  
Telecommunications in a Global Age.  Cambridge, Mass: Harvard  
University Press, 1990.  283 p.  Pool's untimely death in 1984  
deprived us of one of the great thinkers about the social and  
political impacts of the new electronic technologies.  This book is  
the manuscript he had almost completed at the time of his death; it  
extends and expands upon concepts discussed in his 1983 classic  
work Technologies of Freedom (Harvard U. Press, 1983) and focuses  
particularly upon international implications of the revolutions in  
mass media, publishing, and computer networks.  The book contains a  
wealth of information about the impact of technological changes on  
society, including many analogies between earlier communications  
advances such as the telephone and telegraph and what is happening  
today. -- Clifford Lynch 
 
Price-Wilkin, John "Text Files in RLG Academic Libraries: A Survey  
of Support and Activities" The Journal of Academic Librarianship  
17(1) (March 1991):19-25.  Textual analysis using electronic text  
files is opening  up new windows in  the academy.   Textual analysis,  
as a specialized part of full-text retrieval, allows for the user to  
interact with the text in the fashion of a concordance  In addition  
the user can. engage in stylometrics where the style of the author is  
studied.  Many text files are available through the Internet. 
 
Stein, Richard Marlon "Browsing Through Terabytes: Wide-Area  
Information Servers Open a New Frontier in Personal and Corporate  
Information Services" BYTE  16(5) (May 1991):157-164.  Stein takes  
us on a trip to the land of mass storage, retrieval and data/text  
manipulation using Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS).  As he  
puts it, "WAISes can distill the contents of vast archives into neatly  
manageable and browsable folders."  Included are some really  
interesting visual examples using the Macintosh platform. 
 
Weingarten, Fred "Five Steps to NREN Enlightenment" EDUCOM Review  
26(1) (Spring 1991):26-30.  Weingarten argues that now is the time  
to articulate the vision of what we think the NREN should be.  He  
sees two visions being articulated currentlyQthe techie and the  
universal, with "the true NREN vision" somewhere in between. 
 
 
Optical Disk Technology 
 
Bunge, Charles A. "CD-ROM Stress" Library Journal  115(7) (April 15,  
1991):63-64.  In the first of two articles dealing with resistance  
and stress related to CD-ROM technology featured in this month's  
Current Cites, Bunge explores this new villain of library stress. 
 
 
Giesbrecht, Walter "Staff Resistance to Library CD-ROM Services"  
CD-ROM Professional  4(3) (May 1991):34-38.  This article examines  
reasons for resistance to CD-ROM among library staff, including  
psychological reasons, the problem of multiple interfaces, increased  
teaching load, increased costs, increased stress, time required to  
maintain CD-ROM service, and hardware/software issues. 
 
Myslewski, Rik "Is it Time for CD-ROM?" MacUser  7(6) (June  
1991):151-166.  In answering the title's question, Myslewski  
asserts that all  signs indicate  that  the CD-ROM  breakthrough is  
finally underway.  This article features a survey of CD-ROM disk  
drives currently available for the Macintosh platform. 
 
"Silver Platters that Matter" MacUser  7(6) (June 1991):171-186.   
The editors of MacUser have compiled a descriptive list of  
interesting CD-ROM titles ranging from state-of-the-art multimedia  
extravaganzas to simple text dumps of books.

Larson, Ray "The Decline of Subject Searching: Long-Term Trends and  
Patterns of Index Use in an Online Catalog" Journal of the American  
Society for Information Science   42(3) (April 1991):197-215.   
Larson studies MELVYL usage data and concludes that as the database  
has grown, users are increasingly turning away from subject  
searching to the use of title word searching due to various  
dissatisfactions with subject retrieval, including problems in  
formulating subject search terminology. -- Clifford Lynch
