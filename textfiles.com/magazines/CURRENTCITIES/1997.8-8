   Barnard, D.T. and Ide, I.D. "Text Encoding Initiative: Flexible and
   Extensible Document Encoding" Journal of the American Society for
   Information Science 48(7) (July 1997):622-628. - The Text Encoding
   Initiative is an effort to produce a common encoding scheme for
   complex texts. After three years of development, it seems well on its
   way to becoming the standard, especially for texts from the
   humanities. This article is an unusually clear description of the TEI
   Document Type Definition (DTD), for those that want a better
   understanding of its structure and features. The authors cover gross
   structural elements, the reasoning behind TEI's development, and the
   implications for future directions in structured document use and
   presentation. Most useful for me was the way in which the authors step
   through some of the decision-making processes that go into determining
   how to mark up a particular text. - KH
   
   Kenney, Anne R. "Digital to Microfilm Conversion: A Demonstration
   Project, 1994-1996" Final Report to the National Endowment for the
   Humanities, PS-20781-94. Cornell University Library, August 15, 1997.
   (http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/com/comfin.html). - One
   of the thorniest problems that librarians face is how to preserve
   digital collections. There are currently no accepted digital
   preservation *formats*, only *strategies*. One such strategy may be to
   use the digital object to produce computer output microfilm (COM) that
   meets national preservation standards for quality and permanence. This
   report studied the feasibility of such a strategy by looking at such
   issues as quality, expense, and process. It is formal studies such as
   this one, and a related one by Yale University (see
   http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february96/yale/02conway.html), that will
   provide much-needed data for evaluating digital preservation
   strategies. - RT
   
   Logan, Elisabeth and Pollard, Marvin, eds. "Special Topic Issue:
   Structured Information/Standards for Document Architectures" Journal
   of the American Society for Information Science 48(7) (July 1997). -
   This special issue of JASIS covers the latest developments and
   directions in structured document architectures. It consists of ten
   articles covering everything from the history of SGML to
   implementation issues and future trends. For those not very clear on
   the uses of SGML and its relationship to the various Document Type
   Definitions (DTDs), a number of the articles serve as good
   introductions and overviews. What I found especially interesting,
   however, were those covering ideas for the extension of the standards
   to perform more sophisticated types of document analysis and
   searching.- KH
   
   Sengupta, A. and Dillon A. "Extending SGML to Accommodate Database
   Functions: A Methodological Overview" Journal of the American Society
   for Information Science 48(7) (July 1997):629-637. - While many
   projects, over the last couple of years, have focused on the creation
   of large SGML document repositories, very little has been done toward
   providing more sophisticated methods of accessing and querying these
   collections. In this article the authors propose extending SGML to
   include database functionality through what they are calling a
   Structured Document Database Management System. This is radically
   different from the mapping of SGML documents into one of the prevalent
   database models (relational, object-oriented, and object-relational),
   which seems to be the direction of most researchers. According to the
   authors their approach avoids the potential problems of data loss
   during document reconstruction and allows for more sophisticated
   search interfaces. While their arguments are not entirely convincing,
   they certainly do explore some interesting new ground with regard to
   improving access to large structured text collections.- KH

   "The Digital Frontier: The Best Ideas From the Hottest Research Labs."
   Businessweek 3532 (June 23,1997). Special Feature. - Businessweek
   profiles late-breaking, mind-bending research developments that are
   popping up at research universities throughout the nation. This
   lengthy feature's high points include succinct descriptions of some
   really wild ideas that are coupled with analysis of their chances in
   the marketplace. Products related to the research won't appear for a
   few years in most cases, so this is a great article to read if you
   enjoy the game of anticipation. Some of the trends covered in this
   survey have been caught by Cites in the past. For example,
   "Lifestreams", a Yale project, would reorganize computer file and
   document management to mimic human memory patterns. The editors also
   evaluate which research outfits and computer science departments are
   moving up in prestige. - TH
   
   "Global Library Strategies for the 21st Century: Summit of World
   Library Leaders" Biblion: The Bulletin of the New York Public Library
   5(2) (Spring 1997): 4-127. - As part of its centenary celebration, the
   New York Public Library brought together a number of the library
   leaders from around the world to consider the state of the art in
   libraries and their future. Chief executive offices from over 50
   libraries in twenty-seven countries were represented in the three-day
   long forum. The transcription of the proceedings is interesting and
   thought-provoking, as one would expect from such a stellar panel. But
   since the proceedings were no doubt transcribed from a recording, the
   reader experiences both the realism of chit-chat and the distraction
   it brings. Errors have also crept in, such as Ameritech being
   transcribed as "Meritec". But these small quibbles aside, anyone
   interested in knowing what inspires and bothers those responsible for
   the vast majority of the world's information heritage can get some
   small insight by reading these proceedings. - RT
   
   Goldhaber, Michael. "What's the right economics for cyberspace?" First
   Monday 2 (7) (July 7, 1997)
   (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_7/goldhaber/). - In an online
   continuation of a debate about the usefulness of classcial economics
   as a measure of electronic commerce, Goldhaber replies to First Monday
   editor Rishab Ayer Ghosh's June rebuttal of his May manifesto.
   Goldhaber holds firm to his belief that "attention", that is, how much
   time you spend looking at web sites, cannot be quantified by classical
   terms. Whether or not you agree, this discussion is an interesting
   exploration of value and activity in digital realms. - TH
   
   Miller, William. "Troubling Myths About Online Information." Chronicle
   of Higher Education 63 (47) (August 1, 1997): A44. - The president of
   the Association of College and Research Libraries debunks myths about
   the economics and media "spin" on electronic solutions to library
   funding and service issues. He's addressing a faculty readership, and
   does an excellent job of walking the uninitiated through the maze of
   crises that libraries face. The fact that electronic copies often cost
   more than their print counterparts is but one of the many points he
   makes, but he skillfully avoids sounding atavistic or resistant to
   change. Quite the contrary. Miller's assessment of the challenges
   facing research libraries and universities expertly challenges
   non-librarian faculty members to look deeper than advertising and
   promotional literature at the long-term health and success of their
   campus libraries, and to join forces with librarians. - TH
   
   Schwuchow, W., S. Graumann, and W. Bredemeier. "A study of the
   European information market". Journal of Information Science 23(3)
   1997: 249-259. - The article presents results of a study of the
   electronic information services (EIS) markets in seventeen countries
   of the European Economic Area (EEA, including the member countries of
   the EU plus Norway and Iceland). The results include figures detailing
   market size, worldwide revenues, imports and exports from or into EEA
   countries, and breakdowns of revenues by type and subject orientation
   of products on a country level. Real-time information services (eg
   Reuters) are the leading product type and financial services the
   dominant subject category. In absolute figures, the United Kingdom,
   Germany, and France lead the pack. However, if compared by means of
   two "relative development indicators", one a ratio between EIS
   expenditures and the GDP of a country, and the other a ratio between
   EIS expenditures and the number of inhabitants of a country,
   Luxembourg, Iceland, Finland, and Norway emerge as the top ranking
   countries. - CG

   Fiore, Mark. "Colleges Ponder the Pros and Cons of Having Students
   Design Web Sites". Chronicle of Higher Education 63 (47) (August 1,
   1997): A22. - Ever wonder who does all those cool university sites? It
   turns out that student skill and labor are the workhorse for many
   colleges. On the up side, students are fairly likely to be surfing the
   curls of the latest wave of technology (such as Java scripting), and
   they can play the positive role of educating career staff and faculty
   through example. Unfortunately, they graduate, and leave behind them
   some very elegant, but complex web servers that can pose challenges
   for those who remain. One solution is to recruit more career staff who
   can provide continuity, but the temptation of exploiting relatively
   cheap student labor is strong. - TH
   
   Rothenberg, David. "How the Web Destroys Research Papers." Chronicle
   of Higher Education 63 (49) (August 15, 1997): A44. Rothenberg is a
   philosophy professor who argues that when students limit their term
   paper research to web searching, they forfeit quality and intellectual
   rigor. His examples of dicey scholarship include irrelevant graphics
   and references to news stories that all appeared during a one year
   time period. His main point is that Internet search engines make
   research look too easy. In addition to taking potshots at student
   research skills, he finds fault with college libraries for diverting
   precious dollars to ephemeral technologies, that might be gone in two
   years. Thankfully, he also admits to shortcomings in classroom
   pedagogy. What starts out as a critque of the web's shortcomings ends
   up as a Zen buddhist admonition: "Pay attention" -- to the basics,
   like reading, thinking and verifying your sources. - TH
   
   Young, Jeffrey R. "Searching for 'Killer Applications': Networking
   Experts Meet to Discuss What They Will Be Able To Do With Internet 2."
   Chronicle of Higher Education 63 (48) (August 8, 1997): A22. -
   Delegates from universities participating in Internet 2 met at the
   University of Michigan in July to talk about what they can do with all
   that speed and bandwidth, and this article gives a tantalizing
   overview. Video-conferencing is a really just a "low-end" capability;
   scientists hope to control highly complex scientific instruments (like
   magnetic fields and telescopes) from remote locations, eliminating
   grueling travel schedules. Musicians would be able to "jam" online,
   and advanced digital libraries could conceivably include detailed user
   profiles and push technology that would send new acquisitions and news
   to them automatically. The most challenging aspect of such ambitious
   applications will be traffic-regulation on the network, and "quality
   of service", is a key feature. Given the spontaneous potential of
   networked users to invent their own "killer apps", perhaps most of the
   fun to come cannot really be foretold at this early date. - TH
