Well, its been fun hasn't it? What's that I hear you say? It hasn't!
What the articles were too biased towards phones and not enough
hacking? You thought the articles were feeble? You think you could do
better!! 

Well thats more like it .... if you think you can do better than the
articles in PHUK-zine then write them and send them to us. We always
need snippets of news, articles, code, numbers, hints, tips and
general ideas to keep the ball rolling.

Anyhow, next month we have the following goodies for you ....

Green Boxing - DrKaos & TheGoat
BT Computer Security Manual Part II
Something on Novell Networks ...
Some trash from BT wastebins ....
And maybe something on hacking for a change ....:)

Send all articles, flames, Letters of Comment etc etc to PHUK
magazine, anon93143@anon.penet.fi, OR speak to any of the PHUK crew
at any London 2600 meeting .........

- have PHUN and be careful out there ... it a dangerous world and
getting worse by the minute!
