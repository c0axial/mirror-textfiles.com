Reading the phile in sUBTERRANEAN TECHNOLOGIES mAGAZINE by nEIL.s on
answerphones, (complete with BT Response 400 manual), made me realise
that quite a few people mess with these things and that working the
commands out is often more of a drag than hacking the remote code. A
happened to have a answerphone manual and decided to type in the
relevant portions and send them to PHUK magazine. If everyone typed
in an answerphone manual then we would soon have the manuals for
every answerphone in the known universe .... making our lives
considerably easier!

Anyway, on with the answerphone manual
