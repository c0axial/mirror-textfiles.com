			Notes & Queries

Note: Notes & Queries is the section where the readers send in any
questions, problems etc that they might have, and other readers can
send in the answers. Obviously, in the first issue of a magazine, this
is not going to work!! However, just to be a pain in the arse, and
just to pad out this section, we have gone to all the trouble to ....
... make some up!!! 


Q: Does anyone have a full list of BT Star services?

A: It just so happens that I do .....

Q: In the light of the recent BT "hacking" case can anyone tell me
the difference between what the media call "hacking" and what the
lawyers call "Breach of Confidentiality"?

A: Um, No! Can any of our more legal-eagle style readers please
enlighten us?

Q: In the light of the recent BT "hacking" case, I was just
wondering, what WAS the oh-so-secret telephone number for the 
Queen?

A: Last time I looked the Queen's telephone number was 071-445-2865,
oh and by the way, that oh-so-secret MI5 number was probably
0800-894-410, because they gave everyone a hard time when you rang
it!! (Let's just say that they got all secretive and asked where we
had got this number ......) Just remember ... PHUK magazine ...you
heard it here LAST!!!

Q: Can you make up anymore stupid questions before everyone gets
bored?

A: No, we can't! That's why we want YOU the reader to send your
questions and answers to us, at anon93143@anon.penet.fi .... so that
we have more to publish and can keep phukmag goin with the minimum of
effort on our part (of course) so that we can spend more time playing
with computers and less time asking people for the articles they
promised 3 months ago ......
