   		CHANNEL FOUR DOCUMENTARIES SUCK - Phuk-Ed
		-----------------------------------------

That recent documentary on channel four sucked. Just what we needed
was some stupid media c*nts telling the entire world that we were all
boxing throught Hawaii Bell. For some strange reason this line died
very soon after the documentary .... are we surprised? I think not.
At the same time horror stories about people being charged for boxed
calls through 0800 numbers began to circulate, stories of beeing fed
straight into overseas operators when using Country Direct numbers,
along with a whole slew of paranoia, which may or may not just be
disinformation designed to discourage boxing in th UK.

For example, I recently leeched a tfile from a UK bbs that claimed
that from 10-02-94 BT have been monitoring all free phone numbers
from the base in Blackpool, and that the information is also going to
the BT investigations dept at Milton Keynes. The person writing the
tfile claims to be a contracter linked to BT, and that Channel 4
had contacted BT before the documentary was screened and that this
resulted in the circulation of a confidential memo was sent
to all system & exchange managers asking what steps can be taken.
Apparently suggestions ranged from "put filters on the line", via 
"link all 0800 calls to a billing machine" to "change all the
numbers". Well the many of the numbers HAVE changed, and even the
merest hint that all 0800 calls are getting routed into a computer
and analysed to check if they are legitimate data/voice/fax calls
is enough to give any phreak the willies! He also claims that "any
questions can be directed to bt internal investigations on
0800-890-999, ask for extension 131". [Does anyone know if this
number is really the BT investigations unit??]. We do not need this
type of paranoia, and all because of one stupid documentary!

The documentary itself was pathetic. Programming your computers to do
continuous directory listings might look good to the media vampires,
but to anyone with any computer literacy it just looks stupid.
Showing the two anonymous hackers inside a Brighton phone box with
what must have been the BIGGEST tape machine you could possible carry
(can't show Walkmans can we now guys!) while boxing using a tape was
hilarious. Showing them dial up an American sex line while they were
saying in essence that this is a line for all the sad computers spods
who can't get a girlfriend, was a joke. The whole chunk of credit
card fraud at the end, bleeped as if they were giving away vital
information, (of course no-one knew about credit card fraud before!)
was a useful ploy used by the documentary to discredit hackers (look
middle classes, your credit is under attack ... better lock those
hackers up quick!!).

This documentary should act as a warning to any hackers who might
consider getting involved with the media in any way. They can, and
WILL distort what you say by selective editing and voiceovers. They
can and WILL sensationalise hacking in an attempt to increase ratings
and thus advertising revenue. Luckily at least one person in the
known universe is trying to put together a film that shows hackers
and phreakers in a more favourable light ... and we here at PHUK
magazine wish her the best of luck!
