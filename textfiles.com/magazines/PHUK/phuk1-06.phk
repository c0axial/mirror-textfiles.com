		Simple Line Monitor - TheGoat
		-----------------------------


The simple line monitor provides a number of functions, initialy it
was produced to give a visual indication of ringing.

Parts : Line connection jack & cable.
	Two led's, green and red.
	Two resistors 33K.
	Small piece of vero.

For convenience I used a ready molded phone jack cable scavenged from
an old phone, I also found it had a .1" pin socket on the other end,
the plug for which was also removeable from the phone, mounting the
plug at one end of the vero, I put the resistors and LEDs in the
middle to form a small square.

2   +------\         +----+ ==+2-\-R1----D1+----+    |
3/4 |P/jack]+----//--|    + ==+   \--R2----+D2--+    |
5   +------/         +----+ ==+5----------------+    |

Effectivly, pin 2 of the phone jack connects to both resistors each
resistor to a diode, note positive of each diode. and finaly both
diode ends lead back to pin 5 of the phone jack.

	Pin 2 ------------------+-------+

				R1	R2

	Pin 5 ------------------+-------+

The connection of pin 5 and 2 is not too important.

When connected to a line one LED will be lit to show line voltage,
if a ring signal is present both LEDs will light brightly in the ring
pattern. (ie: flash-flash--blank-blank-..... etc). As such this met
the initial requirements, but when we first tried it in anger we
found it could also indicate a number of other things. When a phone
is also attached to the line and is picked up the single LED will dim
to about half its previous brightness. If a futher phone is added,
then when the second phone is picked up a futher dimming is noticable.
When tapping a line, indication that the destination phone is in use is
important.

Coming in the next article: Upgrading to give a direct connection to
a computer port for Ring Indication.
