     THEY ARE OUT TO GET YOU!
                         A piece of POST-LOGIC.

  By: Modok Tarleton


  Is that tuna fish I smell? No, its the CONSPIRACY. As avid
  readers of this magazine probably already know, the
  conspiracy has tried to use its poison tentacles to steal
  eggs from our snake pit. For now, our eggs are safe. One
  day, however, they might try it again. We will be there,
  knife in hand, ready to chop off their offending
  appendages.  Yes, they will probably try to squirt
 their
  government ink in our eyes but we will continue to fight
  with the weapons given to us by (your savior here).
  W e  m u s t  t a k e  a  s t a n d  a g a i n s t
  the pervasive eye of the conspiracy's octopi (yes, it
  rhymes).  You must ask yourself "What can I do to help stop
  this reign of tyranny from the unseens and the who-whats-
  its?" You must continue to fight against the
  shickelgrubers, the boot boys and the LOGIC-WEAVERS! You
  must never fall for LOGIC, you must always
 use POST-LOGIC
  (real men always think in POST-LOGIC). Confusion and
  ambiguity are the weapons in this war.  Turn their
  MEDIASPEAK, GOOBLEDYGOOK and BAFFLEGAB against them! Weave
  great webs of Orwellian nightmare language!  Master the art
  of circular logic! When they ask you what you believe, tell
  them "I believe what you believe. Just don't practice it".
  Are you confused yet? Good! You get "it"!

                    ON THE SUBJECT OF GOVERNMENT...

 By: Cyndre the Grey

 Welcome to a new age!  Yes this is a world where technology
 has hit an all time high.  It seems there is no other way to
 go but up.  Funny, that includes taxes, cost of living, and
 trouble in government.  Yes, this is the day and age that we
 are subjected to, by our wonderful president Mr. George
 Bush, the New World Order...  Most Americans are probably
 still wondering "Just what is this 'New World Order?'" Well,

 lets talk about that:

 The New World Order is a product of the Trilateral
 Committee, made up of the World's key leaders.  In this form
 of government, the entire world will be broken up into 3
 'Nation States':  Europe, The Asias, and The Americas.  The
 worlds decisions will be made by the 'elected' presidents of
 each nation state.  The entire world will be on a common
 market with a universal currency I'm sure we have all heard
 of - the 'credit.' Yes for years we have been getting
 orien
ted to this system, whether in movies, or by our
 banking system.  Well, in the near future, there will be
 very few private banks, we will store our credits (for a
 small fee) in the World Bank.  We will be forced to carry
 around credit chips that, when inserted into a machine, will
 access our account number, list what is to be purchased, and
 the price.  Forget about tax evasion!!  It will all be
 AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCTED from out accounts.  Yes, the new
 government will be a cross between capit
alism and communism.
 They will know our every move.  Business owners will still
 be allowed to keep their businesses but they will have to
 pay exorbitant taxes.  State security will be at an all time
 high.  There will be no middle class.  Citizens will be
 either very rich or very poor.  The machine has already
 started.  Our wonderful government does not want a car on
 the road that is over 10 years old.  A bill has already been
 passed limiting parts for the cars that fit in this 'danger
 zo
ne.'  It is now impossible to get manufacturer parts for
 these cars.  If you have a problem, you must use after-
 market parts and hope that it fits specifications.  Todays
 cars are built to last 10 years or less.  Its a sad thing
 that more people do not understand what is coming down the
 proverbial 'road.'  The governing machine is going to run
 right over the common people like a steam roller.  People
 won't even know what happened.  Take a look around!  The New
 World Order is not nearly as
 wonderful as our government
 would like us to think.  Don't worry, it won't be long and
 we won't have to worry about what they want us to think.
 They will soon control that too!

 WE HAVE BEEN WARNED.  NOW ITS TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!

                            Fight the Power!


        As I sit here writing this, I can't help wondering what the hell is
g
oing on.  Why is it that every time a group a people find some new freedom or
form of expression, the government steps in to suffocate it?  Just look at the
National Endowment for the Arts controversy or the PMRC.  Why must a small
group of paranoid people try to force their fears down all of our throats?  I
must admit that when these things first began happening, I just sat by
thinking to myself that it was a crock of shit without doing anything about
it.  It didn't strike close enough to home for 
me to get involved.  Recently,
however, there's been a series of events that have struck close to home and
have forced me to take action.  The events to which I'm referring are none
other than the government's recent attempts at bringing the computer world to
justice (as they define it, of course).
        It's really disturbing to hear about the methods the feds used to
crack down on "dangerous" users.  Unsigned search warrants have been used to
gain entry to homes where all sorts of equipment, co
mputer related or not, was
confiscated while no charges were specified.  There have also been cases of
holding guns to children's heads while a raid was going on.  What kind of
gestapo tactics are these?  Have these guys never heard of the Bill of Rights?
This isn't the America I was told about as a kid; it sounds a helluva lot more
like those "evil" communist countries that I was taught to hate.
        The only logical conclusion that can be drawn here is that the
government is very afraid.  Why 
else would they dedicate so much effort to
something they know so little about?  These guys don't have a clue as to
what's going on out here in cyberspace.  That's the source of the problem.
Here we sit with these marvelous machines in front of us.  Touch a few keys
and any information that we want to exchange can be sent anywhere in minutes.
This must seem like a pretty major threat to a government that so often relies
on misinformation and cover-ups in order to scam the public into believing
what
 it wants them to believe.  We can't be controlled like the media bozos
who drone bullshit through the idiot box at us.  We can't be censored like the
newspaper or the radio.  In fact, this is probably the truest form of
information exchange we have available today.  That alone is worth fighting
for.
        It could also be that they are afraid of a society where people are
judged solely on their thoughts and ideas.  We have no style whores here.
Race, creed, color and religion are insignificant a
nd pointless in cyberspace;
they serve no purpose.  There can be no discrimination, there can only be
disagreement with someone's opinions.  To me, this is pretty close to a
perfect society.  It is refreshing to judged on what I think and how I express
myself rather than by the color of my skin or the origin of my birth.  In a
society like this, the government cannot play people off against one another.
They have no ground on which to stand.  Perhaps it's this lack of footing that
makes them nervou
s.  Whatever it is, it's got them thinking that they need to
put a stop to it and "bring it under control".  We are a far too dangerous
force for them to just ignore.  This fact should be remembered and taken
advantage of, information is the key!  Less than an hour ago, I posted issue
number six of this magazine on Internet along with messages urging others to
read it.  In a matter of minutes it was all over the world.  Maybe this will
draw others into the fold, maybe not.  Regardless, it'll force t
hem to think
and maybe to take action themselves.

                  The True Significance of Zodiac Signs

 In order to break 
the ice on all these serious topics, I have submitted
 a 'phunny phile'. Enjoy!

                                          Elrond


 AQUARIUS (JAN 21-FEB 19)  You have an inventive mind and are inclined to
 be very progressive.  On the other hand, you lie a great deal and you are
 inclined to be careless and impractical, causing you to make the same
 mistakes repeatedly.  Everyone thinks you are stupid.

 PISCES (FEB 21-MAR 20) You have a very vivid imagination and often think
 you are being f
ollowed by the KGB and the CIA.  You have minor influence
 over your associates and people resent you for your self-important
 flaunting of this power.  You lack confidence and are generally a coward.
 Pisces people tend to screw small animals.

 ARIES (MAR 21-APR 21) You are a pioneer and an innovator.  You hold most
 people in contempt.  You are quick tempered, impatient, and scornful of
 advice.  You are a prick.

 TAURUS (APR 21-MAY 21) You are practical and persistent.  You have a
 dogged d
etermination to work like hell.  Most people think you are
 stubborn and bull-headed.  You are nothing but a goddamn redneck.

 GEMINI (MAY 22-JUNE 21) You are a quick and intelligent thinker.  People
 like you because you are bisexual.  However, you are inclined to expect
 too much for too little.  This means you are a cheap bastard.  Geminis are
 notorious for thriving on incest.

 CANCER (JUNE 22-JULY 23) You are very compassionate and sympathetic to
 other peoples' problems.  You are a sucker
 and a perfect target for con
 artists.  You are always putting things off.  You will always be on
 welfare and will never be worth a shit.

 LEO (JULY 24-AUG 23) You consider yourself a born leader, while others
 consider you loud and pushy.  Most Leos are bullies.  You are vain and
 cannot tolerate honest criticism.  Your arrogance is disgusting.  If you
 are male, you have a very small penis.  Leos are always thieving bastards.

 VIRGO (AUG 24-SEPT 23) You are the logical type and hate disorde
r.  You
 are anal-retentive.  Your nit-picking is sickening to your friends.  You
 are cold and unemotional and often fall asleep while making love.  Virgos
 make excellent bus drivers and pimps.

 LIBRA (SEPT 24-OCT 23) You are the artistic type and have a difficult time
 with reality.  If you are male, you are most likely a faggot.  Chances of
 employment and monetary gains are excellent.  Most Libra women make
 exemplary whores.  All Librans die of venereal disease.

 SCORPIO (OCT 24-NOV 22) 
You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted.
 You will achieve the pinnacle of success due to your complete lack of
 morals and ethics.  You are a perfect son of a bitch.  Most Scorpios are
 murdered.

 SAGITTARIUS (NOV 23-DEC 21) You are overly optimistic and enthusiastic.
 You have a reckless tendency to rely on luck since you lack any real
 talent.  The majority of Sagittarius are drunks and drug addicts.  People
 laugh at you a great deal because you are always getting fucked over.

 CA
PRICORN (DEC 22-JAN 20) You are overly conservative and afraid of taking
 risks.  You don't do much of anything and are very lazy.  There has never
 been a Capricorn of any importance.  Capricorns should avoid standing
 still for too long, as they tend to attract pigeons.  Capricorns are
 notorious for farting in church.

                 ON THE SUBJECT OF PURISTS...

  By: Cyndre The Grey

     I am aware that this article will probably spark much
 criticism but it's something that needs to be discussed here.
 I'm talking about PURISTS!  These are people that believe
 that if they don't drink, smoke, etc., 
they will live
 forever.  I hate to break this to them but...  WRONG!!!
 These people disgust me because they tend to push their
 ignorance and beliefs off on the general public.  We have
 been aware that smoking is bad for us for ages, we have the
 right to choose what we do with our lives.  But now the
 purists decide to play mommy to us and tell us that we can no
 longer smoke in many public places.  They are the ones
 lobbying to get these cigarette taxes raised every time we
 turn around!  S
mokers have become the scapegoats for tax
 hikes!  Its disgusting.  The purists are going to have taxes
 so damn high that we can't even afford to smoke, drink, or
 anything!!!  We have the right to do the things that we
 consider pleasurable.  The purists are trying to take that
 away.  Don't let them commit this atrocity!  Its time we of
 the non-purist belief stood up and lobbied for our own writes
 granted to us as American citizens.  If purists succeed in
 eliminating smoking and drinking fro
m our society, what will
 they go after next?  SEX?!?!?

 Eat well, stay fit, DIE ANYWAY! - Think about it!

                                       Smoker of cigarettes,

                                       Enjoyer of life!

         BECOME A MEMBER OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER 
FOUNDATION

        A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic media
which connect us. Computer-based communication media like electronic mail and
computer confrencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community. These
communities without a single, fixed geographical location comprise the first
settlements on an electronic frontier.
        While well-established legal principals and cultural norms give
structure and coherence to uses of convential media like newspapers, bo
oks,
and telephones, the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing
frameworks. Conflicts come about as the law struggles to defineit it's
application in a context where fundamental notions of speech, property, and
take profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the threat
inherentin new computer and communications technologies, even as they struggle
to master or simply cope with them in the work place and home.
        Throughout 1990, law enforcement activities which were o
stensibly
aimed at "cracking down on crackers" were, in fact, seizing the computer
systems of innocent parties like Steve Jackson and shutting down bulletin
boards used by hundreds of utterly innocenty people. Wether through ignorance
or malice, these actions were depriving manyof their legitament rights under
the Constitution, and chilling the free expression and growth of the Net.
        The EFF was formed in response to these injustices. Our mission was to
protect constitutional guarantees of f
ree speech and freedom from unreasonable
search and seizure. This remains the core of our mission today. We believe that
these fundamental civil liberties must apply to all users of computer networks.
A threat to the rights of anyone is a threat to the rights of us all.
Experience has taught us that these freedoms must be fought for if they are to
be given a firm foundation in the online world. Constitutional guarantees, as
we have seen by actions such as Operation Sun Devil, are not the default sta
te
online, but must be "designed" in from the start. To do nothing risks setting
a series of precedents which will be difficult, if not impossible to reverse
at some time in the future.
        Today, the EFF has evolved to become an advocacy organization, with
broad concerns in the area of information technology policy, including, but
not limited to civil liberties, which represent the interests of it's members
and serve as a bridge between "Cyberspace" and other exotic locales, like
Washington D
.C.
        In order to continue the work already begun and to expand our efforts
and activities into other realms of the electronic frontier, we need financial
support of individuals and organizations.
        If you support our goals and our work, you can show that support by
becoming a member now. Members receive our quarterly newsletter, EFFector,
our bi-weekly electronic newsletter, EFFector Online (If you have an electronic
address that can be reached throught the Net), and special releases a
nd other
notices on our activities. But because we believe that support should be freely
given, you can receive these things even if you do not elect to become a
member. Your membership/donation is fully tax deductible. Our memberships are
