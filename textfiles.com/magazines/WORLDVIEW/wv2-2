         B. The Proper Level of Scrutiny for Children's Rights


     Under traditional constitutional analysis, a statute that infringes
fundamental rights can survive judicial scrutiny only if the government
can show that the statute is both necessary and narrowly drawn to serve
a compelling state interest (33).  Given that children are persons under
the Constitution, logic would seem to demand such strict scrutiny for
infringements not only of adults' rights, but of children's rights as
well.  Yet courts, pointing to the unique developmental traits of
childre
n, have afforded minors' rights a level of protection lower than
that secured by traditional strict scrutiny (34).  Thus, in one
relatively recent case, the Supreme Court suggested that an infringement
of minors' fundamental rights need only serve a "significant state
interest... not present in the case of an adult" (35).  Although the
Court has declined to apply consistently either this standard or any
other, the Court's decisions reflect both a persistent unwillingness to
engage in traditional st
rict scrutiny analysis and a continuing
recognition that children's rights deserve considerably more protection
than that offered by the rational relation test applied in Bykofsky.

     The lack of any developed framework for analyzing children's rights
was highlighted in the recent case of H.L. v. Matheson (36), in which
the Court, addressing the constitutionality of a statute requiring that
parents be notified of a minor's decision to undergo an abortion,
divided on the issue of the proper leve
l of scrutiny in challenges to
differential state treatment of children and adults.  Chief Justice
Burger, writing for the majority, upheld the statute on the ground that
it served "important state interests" and was "narrowly drawn to protect
only those interests" (37).  Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment
on the basis of his characterization of the state interests as
"fundamental and substantial" (38).  Although dissenting from the
Court's judgment, Justice Marshall implicitly expressed sup
port for some
variant of a significant-state-interest test and noted that validating a
statute under such a test indicated not that minors' rights are less
fundamental than adults' but only that special state interests justify
infringement of those rights (39).

     The Court's confusion over the proper formulation of the standard
of review results from the tension caused by the recognition that, while
children are persons for constitutional purposes, they are
simultaneously the subject of speci
al state concern.  Yet in many cases
this tension may be illusory: a careful analysis of the state's alleged
special interests in infringing minors' rights may reveal that such
interests are not at stake in a particular situation or will not be
furthered by a specific restriction.  In such cases, there is no
justification for affording less protection to the rights of minor
citizens than to the rights of adults. This conclusion is implicit in
the wording of the "significant state interest not prese
nt in the case
of an adult" standard. Because the state must present an interest that
pertains uniquely to children before treating them differently from
adults, it follows that, absent a significant difference between
children and adults, the state must treat the two groups identically
(40).  But a lower standard of review, if applied in all cases involving
infringement of children's fundamental rights, would lead courts
automatically to afford less protection to those rights even in cases in
whi
ch there was no justification for doing so. Thus, children's
fundamental rights should be presumptively equal to those of adults, and
violations of such rights should merit strict scrutiny (41).  Only if
courts respect this initial presumption can they properly protect the
fundamental rights of children when there is no basis for treating those
rights differently (42).

     Statements that children possess fundamental rights but may be more
restricted than adults in the exercise of those rights r
epresent a
belief that, although children's abstract rights are identical to those
of adults, their concrete rights are not.  Because a person's status as
a child is not always relevant to her competence to exercise her rights,
however, children's concrete rights should also be presumed equal to
those of adults.  The state should be able to rebut this presumption by
demonstrating the relevance of childhood in a particular case.  Under
the proposed approach, however, courts would not merely apply st
rict
scrutiny to infringements of the rights of children while recognizing
special state interests regarding children, for such a procedure,
according to traditional strict scrutiny analysis, would be
self-contradictory.

     The principle of strict scrutiny for infringements of fundamental
rights presupposes a universe of citizens equal under the Constitution;
what qualifies as a compelling state interest does not ordinarily vary
depending on which citizens are affected (43). Singling out a gro
up of
adult citizens and affording less protection to their fundamental rights
solely because of their membership in the group would cut at the very
heart of the equal protection principle.  Thus, to recognize special
interests surrounding one unique class of citizens -- children -- is to
recognize the need for a unique form of strict scrutiny.  Such a form of
review would acknowledge compelling state interests that pertain only to
children.  Interests that the courts deem compelling under traditio
nal
strict scrutiny analysis would, of course, also suffice to justify
infringements of children's fundamental rights; such interests would
constitute a subset of the acceptable state interests recognized by this
new analysis.  The only additional compelling interests that the
proposed form of strict scrutiny would recognize would be those based on
the unique developmental traits of children -- interests that might be
called "compelling for children" (44).  Under such a test, the rights of
childre
n would not be coextensive with those of adults, for the universe
of state interests sufficient to justify the infringement of children's
rights would be broader.  When a law affecting children -- for example,
a curfew ordinance -- would not, if applied to adults, survive
traditional strict scrutiny, the only possible justification would be a
"compelling for children" interest.

     Courts should therefore require the state to demonstrate that,
because of the unique developmental traits of minors
, unrestricted
exercise of a particular right in the situation in question would create
significant (to merely possible or imaginable) dangers of physical or
emotional harm to the minors or to others.  Thus, the state's power to
act in furtherance of its special interests regarding children would not
be plenary; rather, the state would have to show not simply that a
restriction affected only children, but also that concerns unique to
children and relevant to the specific situation in question legit
imated
the restriction.  If such a "compelling for children" interest were
present, the statute would be upheld, provided that it was narrowly
drawn to protect that interest.  If it did not serve an interest
"compelling for children," a statute that differentially affected the
fundamental rights of children and those of adults would be struck down.

       C.  What Constitutes a "Compelling for Children" Interest

     As noted above, the assumption that children are particularly
vulnerable to c
ertain forms of emotional trauma and are unable to
exercise their rights in an informed, rational, and safe manner forms
the basis for finding a "compelling for children" interest in
legislation restricting children's rights (45).  The Supreme Court
seemed to be operating under such an assumption in Bellotti v. Baird
(46), which struck down a statute that placed various restrictions on
the ability of minors to obtain abortions.  In Bellotti, a four-Justice
plurality set forth three factors that are
 generally found to justify
differential treatment of the constitutional rights of minors.  These
factors, each of which reflects a different aspect of the assumption
that children are not fully competent to exercise their rights, are (1)
the peculiar vulnerability of children, (2) the inability of children to
make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner, and (3) the need
to ensure that parents are able to play a central role in their
children's upbringing (47).

     Although Justice Po
well's opinion for the Court was joined by only
a plurality of the Justices, those who wrote separately did not dispute
the preliminary section of the opinion, which articulated the factors
relevant to an inquiry into differential treatment of children's rights.
The three factors thus provide a framework within which the unique
traits of children may be analyzed in accordance with Supreme Court
precedent. These three factors form a useful framework for assessing
government interests served by a giv
en restriction on the rights of
minors (48).  Under the proposed analysis, a restriction serves an
interest "compelling for children" only if the restriction is narrowly
drawn and only if one of the three factors justifies it.  In the
following Part, each factor is examined more fully in connection with
its application to the question of the validity of juvenile curfew
ordinances.

                             Who Pays for FTP?

From: netspec@zeus.unomaha.edu
(Dan Kenny, Network Specialist/ U of N-Omaha)


In a previous article, tld@cosmos.bae.bellcore.com
(Terry Davidson) writes:

"One question: I've asked this before, and have received no response.
Who pays for ftp? Some uploads/downloads can take a *VERY* large amount of
time; and this has to cost someone some hard cash - but  who? Is the login
used to send bills to the company from where the call originated (some ftp
may be anonymous, but modern UNIX systems darned well get the info anyway,
including the actual line/port/phone of the originati
ng machine).
I'd like answers to these questions, simply because (1) I have
approximately   5 MB of shareware (DOS) utilities to upload to an ftp
site for propagation,   and (2) there are some GIF files out on the ftp
sites I would like to ftp in. Whether or not I actually do this depends
on how ftp is billed.

Terry,

FTP (the file transfer protocol), NNTP (the protocol for the news
service you are reading), TELNET (the remote login protocol), SMTP
(the mail protocol you receive Internet mail 
through), and other
protocol services in the TCP/IP specification are made available to
you courtesy of the educational system in America.

Individual colleges, military sites, organizations and commercial
sites wire up their machines as a campus network. These networks join
a consortium of regional networks (like MIDnet for the Midwest
colleges, MILnet for the military, etc) for a fee and if they are an
educational institution, also receive subsidization on the cost of
connecting their campus ne
tworks to the regional network through the
National Science Foundation. Additionally, the NSF foots the bill for
the long-haul national network connecting the regional networks in one
giant internetwork. This long-haul network is built upon the work of
the military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPAnet) in
the 1970's and 1980's.

These resources are provided to the average Internet user virtually
for free, and are done so in the spirit of research and cooperation.
Not everyone in t
he world ascribes to the philosophy of the
"bottom-line" business mentality, and they recognize the value of open
access to educational resources in the quest for enhancing
communication between educators, researchers, students, businesses,
organizations, and the community.

So to answer your question, we all pay - just like we all pay for open
and public access to the nation's highways, the open and public access
to community libraries, the open and public access to secondary
schools, and the op
en and public access to the state universities.

Individual sites on the Internet make services and resources available
(like disk space for anonymous FTP or the ARCHIE database service) out
of the spirit of this cooperation and belief that the greater benefit
of increased communication outweighs the per-unit-cost of a megabyte
of disk storage or a packet of network bandwidth. Usenet news feeds
are traditionally provided as a courtesy between educational
institutions in this spirit also.

If you
 believe your 5 megs of utilities have educational value, by all
means upload them to an appropriate FTP site. If you believe that
files you find on an anonymous FTP will enhance your education,
download them. Realize that the mere act of communicating with someone
on the Internet and exploring available services has educational value.

Speaking as a student majoring in one of those science/technical and
engineering fields (Computer Science) that people keep worrying about
due to growing lack of i
nterest from our youth, I can assure you that
the educational benefit I have received through the cooperation of the
Internet community has been tremendous. Innovation is not dead in
America, at least not yet. We just need to properly recognize the
value of long-term investment and commitment to cooperation (whether
that be in basic research & development, educating ourselves, or in
laying fiber to every household like Japan is doing), regardless of
short-term cost (or lack of profit). Remember the
 technological
fallout from the Apollo Moon program? We -all- foot the bill for it,
and we -all- (consumers, industry, education, military, and our
general competitiveness in the world) benefited from the cooperation
and technology-sharing of that national project.

Think of the Internet in the same fashion. I do.

Just my opinions,

From:   ADMIN/NASA
To:     NASA
Subj:   Virus Early Warning

This is a Product Assurance and Security Office (PASO) Virus Early
Warning. The PC (not MAC) virus "Michelangelo" has started spreading in
the U.S. very fast.  This virus has a "trigger" date of March 6 where it
will attempt to overwrite vital areas on the PC hard disk.  Please make
sure that you have a current copy of Virusafe 4.5 installed in your
computer. Virusafe is able to 
detect and remove the mentioned virus.
Some other antiviral programs may detect "Michelangelo" but not be able
to remove it. If you don't have Virusafe installed, contact your Code
AIS representative or call the PASO Virus Prevention Team at XXX-XXXX.
Attached is the Virus-L (Internet) message received from A. Padgett
Peterson.

Subject: WARNING - Michelangelo Virus (PC)
THIS VIRUS IS SCHEDULED TO EXECUTE ON MARCH 6, 1992

>From all reports this destructive virus is spreading world-wide very
rap
idly. Unlike the DataCrime "fizzle" in 1989 which contained similar
destructive capability but never spread, the Michelangelo appears to
have become "common" in just ten months following detection. I have
encountered three cases locally in just the last few weeks.

Three factors make this virus particularly dangerous:

1) The virus uses similar techniques as the "STONED" virus which
   while first identifies in early 1988 remains the most common virus
   currently reported. Since the virus infect
s only the Master Boot
   Record on hard disks and the boot record of floppy disks, viral
   detection techniques that rely on alteration of DOS executable files
   will not detect the virus. Similarly, techniques that monitor the
   status of the MBR  may only provide users with a single warning that,
   if execution is permitted to continue, may not be repeated.

2) Michelangelo was first discovered in Europe in mid-1991 consequently
   many virus scanners in use today will not pick up the virus
 unless
   more recent updates have been obtained.

3) Unlike  the Stoned and Jerusalem (the most common viruses in the
   past) which are more annoying than dangerous, the Michelangelo virus
   will, on its trigger date of March 6th, attempt to overwrite vital
   areas of the hard disk  rendering it unreadable by DOS.  Further,
   since the FATs (file allocation tables) may be damaged, unless
   backups are available  recovery will be very difficult and require
   someone  who is able to rebuild
 a corrupt FAT (also a very
   time-consuming process).

Fortunately, the Michelangelo virus is also very easy to detect: when
resident in a PC, the CHKDSK (included with MS-DOS (Microsoft), PC-DOS
(IBM), and DR-DOS (Digital Research) {all names are registered by their
owners}) program will return a "total  bytes  memory" value 2048 bytes
lower than normal.  This means that a 640k PC which normally returns
655,360 "total bytes memory" will report 653,312.  While a low value
will not necessarily m
ean that Michelangelo or any other virus is
present, the PC should be examined by someone familiar with viral
activity to determine the reason.

If the Michelangelo virus is found, the PC should be turned off until
disinfected properly.  All floppy disks and other machines in the area
should then also be examined since the Michelangelo virus is spread i2n
the boot record (executable area found on all floppy disks including
data-only disks).

employer.  Comments refer only to the specific example of the virus that
I have examined. Other strains may exist.

                                  ENIAC
By: Unknown

In the beginning there was ENI
AC.
And the ENIAC was without language or form.
And so was created Machine Code.  And it was Good.
On the second day, Hex was created.  And it was good.
On the third day, Assembly Language was created.  And it was good.
On the fourth day, Fortran was created and it was good.
On the fifth day, man programmed in Fortran.  And it was very good.

And it was spoken: "Though may program in any of these, but the tree of
COBOL thou shall not partake for thou shalt surely pay for thine
transgresssions."


But, there was a hacker in the woods who took the form of a mini and
spake to the man and said "Thou shalt not pay for thine transgressions,
for he knoweth that if thou partakest, thou shall have power to program
large and wonderful things that shall be readable by others!"

So, the man partook of COBOL.

And it was spoken: "Thou hast partaken of the tree of COBOL:
Thou art doomed to write hundred thousand line programs,
be enslaved by IBM, and not have other good programming options for years
."

And it was so.  Many years passed.  IBM dominated.  Programs grew larger and
larger.
BASIC, Pascal, SNOBOL, PLI, Ada and many others came and went.
IBM dominated.  And COBOL programs grew.

Then, as implied, a program came out of the telephone.
It spread to the universities who took it on and made it grow.
IBM tried to kill it many times, but after the PC was introduced,
it was inevitable.  First, A.  Written in Assembly, not COBOL.
Then B which was better that A.
Then finally C took full 
form and shape.
With UNIX, it launched into the market seemingly impervious to
COBOL's domination.
IBM tried again to kill it.  Through security holes, and portability, and
unreadability IBM tried.
But C could not be quashed.
The implied savior of programming everywhere had come!
And the great COBOL could finally start to be removed.
Open systems and high capacity graphic's aided and spurred C on until there
was C for DOS, C++, and finally, C for the IBM series 3090.

And it was very good.

(
to be continued ... maybe)

           For Those Who Haven't Heard: The Challenger Transcript

DISCLAIMER: This info was submitted by an unknown freelance journalist.
The World View Magazine And It's Editors Claim No Responsibility For The
Creation Of This Document. We Have No Ties To NASA, Or Any Other
Government Organization. The Transcript Follows The Audio Tape Which
Was Released To The Public By NASA. As Journali
sts, We Chose To Publish
The Document, Because We Feel The American People Have A Right To Hear
All Opinions Regarding This Issue. The World View Does Not Condone Nor
Do We Necessarily Agree With The "Cover-Up" Theory Related To This
Incident. As Far As We Know, This Information Is Public Domain.

                              --==(*)==--

  A secret NASA tape reveals that the crew of the shuttle Challenger not only
survived the explosion that ripped the vessel apart; they screamed, cried,
curse
d and prayed for three hellish minutes before they slammed into the
Atlantic and perished on January 28, 1986.

  The tape is said to begin with a startled crewman screaming,"What happened?
What happened? Oh God - No!"  Screams and curses are heard- several crewmen
begin to weep- and then others bid their families farewell.

  Two minutes forty-five seconds later the tape ends. That's when the shuttles
crew compartment, which remained intact after the vessel exploded over the
Atlantic, hit the oc
ean at over 2,000 miles per hour, instantly killing the
crew.

 " Cover up? Of course there was a coverup, " declared Robert Hotz, a member
of the Presidential commission that investigated the disaster. " NASA can't
face the fact that they put these astronauts in a situation where they didn't
have adequate equipment to survive. NASA doesn't give a damn about anything
but covering it's ass, " he said.

  The official account released by NASA ends with shuttle pilot Michael Smith
saying, " Uh-oh! 
" Some NASA employees have evidently heard more-much more.
And they provided the rest of the account based on what they've discussed
within NASA in the last five years. The astronauts had time and realized
something was happening after the shuttle broke up.

 " All shuttle astronauts carry personal recorders and the tape in question
apparently came from Christa's (McAuliffe), which was recovered after the
shuttle disaster, " said Hotz. Jarvis was sitting beside her, and when he
figured out what wa
s happening he said, " Give me your hand. "

 " NASA insists there's nothing like that on tape but they're talking about
the mission tape, not Christa's. So they're not lying, but they're not telling
the truth, either. "

   A journalist with close ties to NASA was even more emphatic, " There are
persistent rumors, dating back to the disaster, that this tape is absolutely
bone-chilling. "

   The following transcript begins two seconds after NASA's official version
ends, with pilot Michael Smit
h saying, " Uh-oh! " Times from the moment of

                      DUTCH POLICE ARRESTS HACKERS
The facts:

At 10.30 Monday morning, 27 January 1992, Dutch police searched the
homes of two hackers. In the city of Roermond, the parental home of
the 21-year old student H.W. was searched and in Nuenen the same
happened to the parental home of R.N., a Computer Science engineer,
age 25.  Both were arrested and taken into custody
. At both sites,
members of the Amsterdam Police Pilot Team for computer crime were
present, alongside local police officers and representatives of the
national organization CRI (Criminal Investigations Agency). Both
suspects were transported to Amsterdam. The brother of one of the
suspects was told the suspects could receive no visits or mail. All
of this has happened more than one week ago and the two are still in jail
as we write this.

The charges:

A break-in supposedly occurred at the bro
nto.geo.vu.nl site at the VU
University in Amsterdam. This UNIX system running on a SUN station (IP
130.37.64.3) has been taken off the net at least for the duration of
the investigation. What happened to the actual hardware is unknown at
this time.

The formal charges are: forgery, racketeering and vandalism. The
police justify the forgery part by claiming that files on the system
have been changed. The vandalism charge is valid because the system
had to be taken off the net for a period of time
 to investigate the
extent of the damage.  By pretending to be regular users or even
system management the hackers committed racketeering, the police says.

Both suspects, according to the Dutch police, have made a full
statement.  According to a police spokesman the motive was "fanatical
hobbyism".  Spokesperson Slort for the CRI speaks of the "kick of
seeing how far you can get".

Damages:

According to J. Renkema, head of the geo-physics faculty at the VU,
the university is considering fili
ng a civil lawsuit against the
suspects.  "The system was contaminated because of their doing and had
to be cleaned out. This cost months of labour and 50.000 guilders
(about US$ 30,000).  Registered users pay for access to the system and
these hackers did not.  Result: tens of thousands of guilders in
damages." Renkema also speaks of a 'moral disadvantage': The
university lost trust from other sites on the network. Renkema claims
the university runs the risk of being expelled from some networks.


Renkema also claims the hackers were discovered almost immediately
after the break-in and were monitored at all times. This means all the
damages had occurred under the watchful eyes of the supervisors. All
this time, no action was taken to kick the hackers off the system.
According to Renkema all systems at the VU were protected according to
guidelines as laid down by CERT and SurfNet BV (SurfNet is the company
that runs most of the inter-university data-traffic in The
Netherlands).

What real
ly happened?

The charge of 'adapting system-software' could mean that the hackers
installed back-doors to secure access to the system or to the root
level, even if passwords were changed. New versions of telnet, ftp,
rlogin and other programs could have been compiled to log access to
the networks.

What really happened is anybody's guess. One point is that even the
CRI acknowledges that there were no 'bad' intentions on the part of
the hackers. They were there to look around and play with the

networks.

About hacking in general:

In the past we have warned that new laws against computer crime can
only be used against hackers which are harmless. Against the real
computer criminals a law is useless because they will probably remain
untraceable.  The CRI regularly goes on the record to say that hackers
are not the top priority in computer crime investigation. It seems
that hackers are an easy target when 'something has to be done'.

And 'something had to be done': The pressure from esp
ecially the U.S.
to do something about the 'hacking problem' was so huge that it would
have been almost humiliating for the Dutch not to respond. It seems as
if the arrests are mainly meant to ease the American fear of the
overseas hacker-paradise.

A closer look at the charges and damages:

The VU has launched the idea that system security on their system was
only needed because of these two hackers. All costs made in relation
to system security are billed to the two people that just happened t
o
get in. For people that like to see hacking in terms of analogies: It
is like walking into a building full of students, fooling around and
then getting the bill for the new alarm-system that they had to
install just for you.

Systems security is a normal part of the daily task of every system-
adminstrator. Not just because the system has to be protected from
break-ins from the outside, but also because the users themselves need
to be protected from each other. The 'bronto' management has negle
cted
some of their duties, and now they still have to secure their system.
This is not damages done, it's work long overdue.

If restoring back-ups costs tens of thousands of guilders, something
is terribly wrong at the VU. Every system manager that uses a legal
copy of the operating system has a distribution version within easy
reach.

'Month of tedious labour following the hackers around in the system'.
It would have been much easier and cheaper to deny the hackers access
to the system direct
ly after they had been discovered. 'Moral damages'
by break-ins in other systems would have been small. The VU chose to
call the police and trace the hackers. The costs of such an operation
cannot be billed to the hackers.

Using forgery and racketeering makes one wonder if the OvJ (the
District Attorney here) can come up with a better motive than 'they
did it for kicks'. If there is no monetary or material gain involved,
it is questionable at best if these allegations will stand up in
court.


As far as the vandalism goes: there have been numerous cases of system
management overreacting in a case like this. A well trained
system-manager can protect a system without making it inaccessible to
normal users. Again: the hackers have to pay for the apparent
incompetence of system management.

This does not mean that having hackers on your system can not be a
pain.  The Internet is a public network and if you cannot protect a
system, you should not be on it. This is not just our statement, it 
is
the written policy of many networking organizations. One more

metaphor: It's like installing a new phone-switch that allows direct
dial to all employees. If you get such a system, you will need to tell
your employees not to be overly loose-lipped to strangers. It is not
the callers fault if some people can be 'hacked'. If you tie a cord to
the lock and hang it out the mail-slot, people will pull it. If these
people do damages, you should prosecute them, but not for the costs of
walking after 
them and doing your security right.

Consequences of a conviction:

If these suspects are convicted, the VU makes a good chance of winning
the civil case. Furthermore, this case is of interest to all other
hackers in Holland. Their hobby is suddenly a crime and many hackers
will cease to hack. Others will go 'underground', which is not
beneficial to the positive interaction between hackers and system
management or the relative openness in the Dutch computer security
world.

Public systems:


If you are not a student at some big university or work for a large
corporation, there is no real way for you to get on the Internet. As
long as there is no way for some people to connect to the net, there
will be people that hack their way in. Whether this is good or bad is
besides the point. If there is no freedom to explore, some hackers
will become the criminals that government wants them to be.

                 "Our system is perfectly secure !"

        (and if you prove it's not, we'll ha
ve you put in jail)
