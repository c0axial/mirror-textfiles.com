When:      Friday December 18 through Sunday December 20, 1992



Somebody call hotel security, we're at it again! Xmas/HoHoCon '92, three
years and running. HoHoCon '91 turned out to be the largest and most chaotic
gathering of any other computer underground conference ever, yet it was also
the most organized and well planned. Everything from party ball soccer to
interhotel telegrams from Cliff Stoll to elite cYbuR-strippers, and everyone
from Bruce Sterling to Erik Bloodaxe & Doc Holiday of Comsec to K0DE WARRI0R
himself. It was also the first conference to produce .gifs, a definite new
trend. How we got away with it is still a mystery, and how we'll top it,
I just don't know. But you can bet we're gonna try! We're looking to get an
even larger group of people from the computer underground, computer
security, media, and telecommunications world together to discuss a variety
of topics. Still no ego trip either, the event will once again be open to
the public so that anyone may attend, and everyone is encouraged to
participate in the activities.


This is actually a pre 'official announcement', so at this point, we don't
exactly have all of the conference itself planned. We are still in the midst
of arranging times and confirming speakers. We would like to have a number
of people speak on a varied assortment of topics. If you would like to
speak, please contact us as soon as possible and let us know who you are,
who you represent (if anyone), the topic you wish to speak on, a rough
estimate of how long you will need, and whether or not you will be needing
any audio-visual aids. The main announcement will probably be going out in
three weeks, and we will be releasing updates every three to four weeks
after that.

We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year, so if you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. We will also include a list of items
and videos that will be present in a future update.

We received a nice amount of media support last year in the form of
pre-conference announcements and would greatly appreciate the same this
year. Besides our updates, you will most likely be able to get HoHoCon
details from CuD, Informatik, Mondo 2000, and Phrack Magazine. If you are a
journalist and would like to do a story on HoHoCon 92, or know someone who
would, contact us with any questions you may have, or feel free to use and
reprint any information in this file.

If anyone requires any additional information, needs to ask any questions,
wants to RSVP, or would like to be added to the mailing list to receive the
HoHoCon updates, you may write myself (Drunkfux) or any of the other
HoHoCon planning committee members (uh... whoever they may be) at:


                          dfx@nuchat.sccsi.com

              Or:         Fennec Information Systems

                          11504 Hughes Rd. Suite 131
                          Houston, Texas 77089


For those without net access, we'll list a few boards to reach us on in the
upcoming announcement, as well as a P.O. Box. Currently, your best bet would
be to try any of the cDc systems. Mainly, Demon Roach Underground -
(806) 794-4362, Login: THRASH, NUP: Jihad (I think).

HoHoCon 92 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals (yeah,
right) and gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct
from the source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members
of the computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We
urge people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn't
happen very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of the most famous
people from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance.
Don't wait to read about it in all the magazines, and then wish you had
attended, make your plans to be there now! Be a part of what we hope to be
our largest and greatest conference ever.

                               SIXTY-TWO SIGNS
                               OF THE END TIME


 [Editor's comment: I don't believe in any of this. I published this
 because it sounded half-way interesting. Take it how you wish. ]

Jesus'  disciples wanted to know: "What will be the sign of  Your coming, and
of the end of the age?" (Matt. 24:3). Jesus  answered their question with not
only one sign, but many. People today are asking  the  same question, and the
Bible tells us  what  we  can expect in this day as the coming of the Lord
draws near.


 1. The airplane                Like birds flying about, so will the Lord of
                                hosts defend Jerusalem. Defending, He will
                                also deliver it; passing over, He will
                                preserve it. Is. 31:5

 2. The automobile              The chariots rage in the streets, they jostle
                                one another in the broad roads; they seem like
                                torches, they run like lightning. Nah. 2:4

 3. Atomic power                But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in
                                the night, in which the heavens will pass away
                                with a great noise, and the elements will melt
                                with fervent heat; both the earth and the works
                                that are in it will be burned up. 2 Pet. 3:10

                                Therefore, since all these things will be dis-
                                olved, what manner of persons ought you to be
                                in holy conduct and godliness. 2 Pet. 3:11

                                Looking for and hastening the coming of the
                                day of God, because of which the heavens will
                                be dissolved being on fire, and the elements
                                will melt with fervent heat. 2 Pet. 3:12; Rev.
                                13:13; 18:8; Luke 17:29, 30; Gen. 19:24

 4. Marked increase in          "But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
    knowledge                   the book until the time of the end; many shall
                                run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."
                                Dan. 12:4

 5. Marked increase in          "But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
    world travel                the book until the time of the end; many shall
                                run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."
                                Dan. 12:4

 6. Invention of radio          Can you send out lightnings, that they may go
                                and say to you, 'Here we are!'? Job 38:35

 7. Invention of radar          Can you send out lightnings, that they may go
                                and say to you, 'Here we are!'? Job 38:35

 8. Invention of telephone      Can you send out lightnings, that they may go
                                and say to you, 'Here we _are_!'? Job 38:35

 9. Invention of TV,            Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every
    satellites and Telstar      eye will see Him, and they also who pierced
                                Him. and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
                                because of Him. Even so, Amen. Rev. 1:7; Rev.
                                11:9

10. Pride                       For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of
                                money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobe-
                                dient to parents, unthankful, unholy. Ezek.
                                16:49; Luke 17:28, 30

11. Boasters--bragging          These are murmurers, complainers, walking
    spirits                     according to their own lusts; and they mouth
                                great swelling words, flattering people to gain
                                advantage. Jude 16; 2 Tim. 3:2

12. Manufacturing of            Proclaim this among the nations: "Prepare for
    armaments                   war! Wake up the mighty men, let all the men
                                of war draw near, let them come up." Joel 3:9

13. Disregard for the           "Look, this was the iniquity of your sister
    poor, needy, hungry:        Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, full-
    taking advantage of         ness of God, and abundance of idleness; nei-
    the poor                    ther did she strengthen the hand of the poor
                                and needy." Ezek. 16:49; Luke 17:28-30

14. Lovers of pleasure          Traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of plea-
                                sure rather than lovers of God. 2 Tim. 3:4

15. Increased idleness,         "Look, this was the iniquity of your sister
    shorter work week           Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, full-
                                ness of God, and abundance of idleness; nei-
                                ther did she strengthen the hand of the poor
                                and needy." Ezek. 16:49; Luke 17:28-30

16. Intemperance in             "They ate, they drank, they married wives,
    eating                      they were given in marriage, until the day that
                                Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and
                                destroyed them all. Likewise as it was also in
                                the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they
                                bought, they sold, they planted, they built."
                                Luke 17:27-28; Matt. 24:37-38; Ezek. 16:49

17. Exchanging wives,           "But as the days of Noah were, so also will the
    remarriage, increase        coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days
    in divorce                  before the flood, they were eating and drink-
                                ing, marrying and giving in marriage, until the
                                day that Noah entered the ark." Matt. 24:37-
                                38; Luke 17:27

18. Building boom               "Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot:They
                                ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
                                planted, they built." Luke 17:28

19. Increase of ungodly         "To execute judgement on all, to convict all who
    people                      are ungodly among them of all their ungodly
                                deeds which they have committed in an un-
                                godly way, and of all the harsh things which
                                ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."
                                Jude 15; 2 Tim. 3:2; 2 Pet. 2:3

20. Haters and despisers        For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of
    of God                      money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobe-
                                dient to parents, unthankful, unholy. 2 Tim.
                                3:2

21. Despisers of them           Unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without
    that are good               self-control, brutal, despisers of good. 2 Tim.
                                3:3; Matt. 24:9

22. False accusers              For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of
                                money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobe-
                                dient to parents, unthankful, unholy. 2 Tim.
                                3:2

23. Incontinent and             Unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without
    fierce                      self-control, brutal, despisers of good. 2 Tim.
                                3:3; Matt. 24:9

24. Violence                    The earth also was corrupt before God, and the
                                earth was filled with violence. And God said to
                                Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before
                                Me,for the earth is filled with violence through
                                them; and behold, I will destroy them with the
                                earth." Gen. 6:11, 13

                                "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the
                                prophets and stones those who are sent to her!
                                How often I wanted to gather your children
                                together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her
                                wings, but you were not willing!" Matt. 23:37

25. Labor troubles--            Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed
    strikes                     your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry
                                out; and the cries of the reapers have reached
                                the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. James 5:4

26. Greediness for              For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of
    money--covetou              money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobe-
                                dient to parents, unthankful, unholy. 2 Tim.
                                3:2

27. Money problems--            "There shall arise in his place one who imposes
    burdensome taxes            taxes on the glorious kingdom; but within a few
                                days he shall be destroyed, but not in anger or
                                in battle" Dan. 11:20

28. Rich heaping up             Your gold and silver are corroded, and their
    wealth--treasures           corrosion will be a witness against you and will
                                eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up
                                treasure in the last days. James 5:3

29. Perilous times--            "And there will be signs in the sun, in the
    distress--perplexity        moon, and in the stars; and on the earth dis-
                                tress of nations, with perplexity, the sea
                                and the waves roaring." Luke 21:25; 2 Tim. 3:1

30. Nations crumbling           "And I will make them one nation in the land,

                                be king over them all; they shall no longer be
                                two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into

                             ---------------------
       Using "anonymous ftp" to get files from other Internet machines


By Mark Moraes, University of Toronto


 [Editor's Note: I realize that most of us know how to do this...however,
many subscribers have written to me wondering how. So instead of me
explaining it, let's let this file enlighten the less-priviliged.]


Anonymous ftp is a facility offered by many machines on the Internet.
This permits you to log in with the ftp program with the user name
'anonymous' or the user name 'ftp'. When prompted for a password, type
your e-mail address -- it's not necessary, but it's a courtesy for
those sites that like to know who is making use of their facility. Be
courteous.

Most ftp sites do not like people getting files from them during their
working hours since they usually have other load on their systems --
avoid 9am-5pm in their time-zone.

Also bear in mind that countries are often connected by relatively
low-bandwidth links, so please check local archive sites before you
connect to some distant country to fetch something.  If you think the
item you want is popular, ask your local archive site sysadmin, who
may be willing to set up a copy on the local archive.

Different archive sites have different forms of etiquette -- if you see
a README or README.TXT file in the ftp directory, please read it.

Once you're connected to the remote site via ftp, you can look around
and retrieve files. (Most anonymous ftp sites do not permit people to
store files) The ftp program prompts you with

ftp>

and offers a few commands that are similar to Unix.  "cd" changes your
directory on the remote machine, "lcd" changes your directory on the
local machine, "get" will get a file, etc. See the manual page for ftp
(use the command "man ftp")

Typically, a directory called 'pub' is where the interesting things
are stored. Some sites will have a file with a name like ls-lR, that
contains a complete list of the files on that site. Otherwise, you can
type ls -lR and get such a listing -- for some sites, this can take
a LONG time.  This doesn't work on some sites.

Usually, files are grouped in composite "archive" files, so you don't
have to get many small files separately. The most common Unix archive
file format for the Internet is tar, usually indicated by a ".tar"
suffix in the file name.  tar archives can be unpacked by running the tar
command -- you may want to first do a 'tar t' on the file to see what
it contains before unpacking it.

Occasionally, people use shell archives (with .shar or .sh suffixes)
instead.  These are Unix Bourne shell scripts, with files encapsulated
in them.  Be careful when unpacking shell archives since they have to
be run through the Bourne shell to unpack them.  The simplest way is
to use the unshar command, if your system has one installed.
Otherwise, you have to delete all the leading text with an editor and
then run the rest of the text through "sh" o unpack the archive.  Make
sure you're in the directory you want the files in before you try
unpacking the archive, since there's no good way to list the contents
of an archive.

Files are often stored compressed -- for Unix, the most common form
is the compress program, indicated by a .Z suffix on the file name.

Sometimes, people use programs like arc (indicated by a .ARC suffix),
zoo (.ZOO), zip (.ZIP) or lharc (.LZH), which are combined archival
and compression formats. (There are lots of other archive formats -
talk to the systems staff if you encounter them and don't know how to
deal with them) Macintosh archives are often in StuffIt format (.SIT).
In each case, you need the relevant extraction program.  Usually, the
archive site will also have a copy of the extraction program for ftp.
Finally, there's the "self-extracting" archive format, popular in the
PC world -- they look like executable programs (.EXE) and when run,
they unpack the files they contain.

When retrieving non-text files, you must use binary mode, otherwise
the file gets messed up. To do this, use the 'binary' command. (It's
safe to set this for text files if the other end is a Unix system,
since Unix doesn't differentiate between text and binary file
representation. If the site at the other end is non-Unix, you may need
to use some other mode -- see the documents for that site and for ftp)
