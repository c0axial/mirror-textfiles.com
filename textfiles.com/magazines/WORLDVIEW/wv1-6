                                   THE WRATH
 
 
By The Desert Fox
 
Well everyone, the World View is back after a short absence. Some of you might
have not even noticed the late issue. Since the last issue, some of the
World View staff were under surveillance by the SS. I cannot specifically say
which ones suffered this wrath. However, I can say that the number was quite
significant. Also, another friend of The World View staff and Editor of
another very popular E-Mag was involved. I apologize for the lack of
specific information here. However, we feel that by giving information such
as this, we could very well compromise security. I can assure the readers
of our publication and other curious cyberpunks, that all persons involved
in this matter is completely innocent of any crime. We have the best cyber
lawyer in the business and we feel secure. In time, we will be vindicated of
any suspicions (whatever they might be). Those who are associated with this
publication are not hackers, phreakers, or trouble makers. We are JOURNALISTS!
And nothing more. The World View staff were forced to 'drop carrier' for a
while in order to evaluate the current security level. Several 'War Councils'
were held in order to assess the situation. As I am writing this article,
it still remains the opinion of the World View that the SS and/or FBI are
still conducting operations against members of this publication. If these
actions of harrassment continue, charges may be filed in a court of law.
We have gathered information as it has become available. We have reason to
believe that the Constitutional right of Attorney/Client privilege to
confer in private has been violated. Other rights may have been violated,
but have not yet been fully documented. We are prepared to take action as
the situation warrants. It is a 'hurry up and wait' situation at this point.
We will inform our readers as we can. The World View will not be interrupted
anymore than necessary. The repercussions of this incident have been
tremendous. It has caused everyone to go underground for more than a month.
It has caused us to be more careful when we leave our homes. We must now look
for a car that might be following us. (And believe me...it happened!). It has
caused the online database for the World View to be taken down. (Note: this is
not the Dickinson Nightlight). I operated some software where my staff could
call in and pick up and deliver news, etc...I had my system removed from my
home immediately. I did not have any illegal or unauthorized information on my
system. However, as soon as the 'shit hit the fan', thoughts of Steve Jackson
getting his equipment seized popped into my brain. Other thoughts included the
many people around the country who have suffered the same wrath and never got
their systems back. So, I did it as a precautionary measure. I was never too
worried. Cautious: Yes... One can never be too cautious. This wrath also
caused members of the Weltanschauung to quit communicating over the phone for
long periods of time and caused some of us to leave the state. I guess the
general reaction among the individuals involved was that of a 'pissed off'
attitude. Understandably so. But as the wrath continues, the World View keeps
on ticking. I would like to take this time to congratulate all the great users
who knew about this incident and did not back off. I would like to extend my
thanks to everyone also. We found out who our true friends were. And most of
all, I would like to publicly say that our attorney, and partner through thick
and thin, Bryan O' Blivion, was instrumental in this issue. We could not have
made it through this with out him. Invaluable friends are hard to come
by...and if he is not one, then no one is! We still live in fear because of
this. But he has made it 99% better. If you want to thank anyone...thank him.
Don't send me mail thanking us for publishing this stuff. Send him some
thanking him for keeping the World View alive! I have good reason to believe
that if it weren't for him, I'd probably be in a small wooden chair in a cold
dark room screaming 'Fu*k you! I wanna talk to my lawyer!'

                      THE MANIFESTO OF DER WELTANSCHAUUNG
 
By Bryan O' Blivion
 
   We, the persons who have associated ourselves voluntarily under the above
    name, declare and announce to all persons the following statement of our
                             beliefs and purposes:
 
              We, the undersigned  of the WELTANSCHAUUNG believe:
 
       That all free persons have the basic right, inalienable by rule of
    government, law or man, to think, to speak their thoughts, to write and
    publish their thoughts, and to associate with any person or organization
                                they so desire.
 
     That the above rights of freedom of association and of expression are
     forever expressly and irremovably enshrined in the Bill of Rights and
              in the Constitution of the United States of America.
 
   That any governing person, law, or regime which, on any basis or pretext,
   suppresses the free flow and exchange of information, or public or private
     speech, or human thoughts fixed or expressed in whatsoever medium, is
  contrary to the purpose and intent of the United States Constitution, and is
               historically doomed to fail, oppress, and injure.
 
    That these Constitutional rights are applicable, in their fullest extent
   and highest purpose, to all forms of freedom of expression and association
                        which occur by electronic means.
 
   That full protection and of adherence to these rights, even if we find the
 particular ideas being expressed distasteful, is essential as a wellspring of
                   our free, creative, and advancing society.
 
   That certain governmental, commercial, and other interests in contemporary
     society have an interest in actively opposing and repressing the free
       exercise of these Constitutional rights by United States citizens.
 
      THEREFORE, BY THESE PRESENTS WE, AND EACH OF US, DO SOLEMNLY AFFIRM:
 
    That we will support, uphold, and defend the  Constitution of the United
    States, and all of the Amendments thereof, to the fullest extent of our
                             individual abilities;
 
    That we will at all times so act as to preserve, protect, and defend the
    Constitutional liberties granted to every citizen of the United States;
 
     That we will, by word and deed, encourage others to express themselves
             freely, and to tolerate the free expression of others;
 
      That as journalists, thinkers, writers, and publishers we will never
   tolerate, condone, or ignore unConstitutional activities by any person or
 organization, public or private, which operate to chill and diminish the free
    flow of information between the citizens of our society, or which act to
     punish or persecute persons who exercise their Constitutional rights.
 
 
   That we will oppose and will challenge, by every lawful means, any attempt
  by any person or organization, public or private, to inhibit the exercise of
       any person's Constitutional rights of freedom of expression and of
                                  association;
 
  That we shall forever adhere to the United States Constitution and to these
 principles, willfully and freely, putting them before any allegiances asked
 of us by politicians, governments, territories, economic interests, or any
 other persons or organizations, public, private, or religious.
 
                WITNESS OUR HANDS THIS 16th DAY OF AUGUST, 1991.
 
                     Your friends of The World View Magazine

         BECOME A MEMBER OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION
 
        A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic media
which connect us. Computer-based communication media like electronic mail and
computer confrencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community. These
communities without a single, fixed geographical location comprise the first
settlements on an electronic frontier.
        While well-established legal principals and cultural norms give
structure and coherence to uses of convential media like newspapers, books,
and telephones, the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing
frameworks. Conflicts come about as the law struggles to defineit it's
application in a context where fundamental notions of speech, property, and
take profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the threat
inherentin new computer and communications technologies, even as they struggle
to master or simply cope with them in the work place and home.
        Throughout 1990, law enforcement activities which were ostensibly
aimed at "cracking down on crackers" were, in fact, seizing the computer
systems of innocent parties like Steve Jackson and shutting down bulletin
boards used by hundreds of utterly innocenty people. Wether through ignorance
or malice, these actions were depriving manyof their legitament rights under
the Constitution, and chilling the free expression and growth of the Net.
        The EFF was formed in response to these injustices. Our mission was to
protect constitutional guarantees of free speech and freedom from unreasonable
search and seizure. This remains the core of our mission today. We believe that
these fundamental civil liberties must apply to all users of computer networks.
A threat to the rights of anyone is a threat to the rights of us all.
Experience has taught us that these freedoms must be fought for if they are to
be given a firm foundation in the online world. Constitutional guarantees, as
we have seen by actions such as Operation Sun Devil, are not the default state
online, but must be "designed" in from the start. To do nothing risks setting
a series of precedents which will be difficult, if not impossible to reverse
at some time in the future.
        Today, the EFF has evolved to become an advocacy organization, with
broad concerns in the area of information technology policy, including, but
not limited to civil liberties, which represent the interests of it's members
and serve as a bridge between "Cyberspace" and other exotic locales, like
Washington D.C.
        In order to continue the work already begun and to expand our efforts
and activities into other realms of the electronic frontier, we need financial
support of individuals and organizations.
        If you support our goals and our work, you can show that support by
becoming a member now. Members receive our quarterly newsletter, EFFector,
our bi-weekly electronic newsletter, EFFector Online (If you have an electronic
address that can be reached throught the Net), and special releases and other
notices on our activities. But because we believe that support should be freely
given, you can receive these things even if you do not elect to become a
member. Your membership/donation is fully tax deductible. Our memberships are
$20.00 per year for students, $40.00 per year for regular members. You may,
of coures, donate more if you wish.
        Our private policy: The EFF will never, under any circumstances, sell
any part of it's membership list. We will, from time to time, share this with
other non-profit organizations whose work we determine to be in line with our
goals. But with us, member privacy is the default. This means that you must
actively grant us permission to share your name with other groups. If you do
not grant us explicit permission, we assume that you do not wish your
membership disclosed to any group for any reason. Please copy this notice to
any appropriate forum, and distribute hardcopies to anyone who is interested!

 An Editorial By The Desert Fox
 
   I look around today at all the articles, editorials, and features that are
 being written about how the government is suppressing the computer users of
 this country. It amazes me to see the priority that this nation's authority
 has in solving problems. Lately, those priorities seem to be to nail the
 silicon-generation first, and then nab the 'real criminals'. I do see the
 point in bringing true software pirates and  so-called 'fone phreaks' to
 justice. I personally have no sympathy for those who risk loosing their
 right to be a couch potato because they are illegally using the phone
 service or they are just dying to get the latest 'warez'. The main reason
 why I do not sympathize with phone phreaks is simply because most of the
 phone system is so secure today. And it makes it much easier for the phone
 company to catch a perpetrator. So, if they are so incompetent as to use
 the phone system for illegal purposes, then they are sealing their own fate.
 
   But, as of late, I have heard numerous stories about the Secret Service,
 and other government agencies raiding establishments, seizing equipment, and
 prosecuting individuals with no concrete evidence. Take the Steve Jackson
 case as an example. Must the SS use an invalid search warrant, and a wrongful
 cause in order to arrest this man for a crime he did not commit?
 
   There are many documented cases about the government conducting operations
against computer users with invalid warrants and without probable cause.
I ask myself why an agency would have to resort to illegal means in order to
incarcerate an individual. This brings up the issue of legitimate users being
harassed by the agency. I am at ease with myself as far as the law goes.
But it really angers me to think that the law can bust down my door and
obtain my equipment just because they get some idea that I am trying to
install Communism deep into the bowels of America, or because I simply call
local bulletin boards.
 
  Because of cases like Mr. Jackson's, there has been an uprise in the
visibility of groups like The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). These
groups' purpose is to aid computer users who have been treated unfairly by
the SS. The EFF has handled some landmark cases, including the Craig Neidorf
case. Neidorf was found innocent of the crimes in which he was charged.
Steve Jackson was also found innocent, and is now taking the SS to court for
damages incurred during the farce engineered by the SS. The EFF, along with
similar groups, I feel, will be the only savior for users such as you and I.
The relentless onslaught of the government on computer users is not over.
The users need to speak out against this suppression. Until then, the SS will
conduct operations at will. If you are taken into custody for a crime that you
did not commit, you need to take action! There are resources available.
Please take advantage!
 
  The era of the silicon warrior is here! Electronically published magazines
such as The World View, are here for good! The fraction of society that is
up-to-date with the evolution of the computer generation should not have to
be suppressed by those who are not. It is a shame that groups like the EFF
even have to exist. However, as long as there are people who are out there
promoting the progress of our cause, and condoning the will of the people,
we will always be looked down upon by those who get nervous when someone
makes an impact on society. Be different. Be unique. Eventually, those who
choose to play off the silicon generation as a fad will succumb to the 'fad'
of never-ending progress in our field. We are here to stay and will make the
biggest impact of this generation. History is being made as we speak. So,
if you are not yet on this train, I suggest you buy your ticket now. If you
are, hang on tight. We're in for one hell of a ride.

            Time To License Those Evil Computer Programmers!
 
 
More Suppression Submitted By: Neuromancer
 
 
New Jersey, that state which has lately proved to be "the toughest in
the nation" by trampling on its residents is once again attempting to
reach all new lows. Now, what has this got to do with programming...?
 
A bill has passed in the assembly that would require the licensing of
computer programmers -- to protect the public interest, of course.
Lord knows the number of times I've been accosted in pizza parlors,
late at night, by renegade bands of unlicensed programmers. Well, now
we'll be able to control these low-lifes.
 
If you think I'm kidding, read on. What follows is Assembly Bill
A-4414, which has already passed the assembly. AT&T has estimated that
it would need to license over 5,000 people in New Jersey alone, and
there is nothing in the bill that differentiates home from business
use.
 
So watch out: besides being arrested for legally buying a gun 20 years
ago, you could also be arrested for modifying a DOS batch file!
 
New Jersey and you. Perfect together?
PS: I don't think there are any errors in what follows, but no
    promises.

                       The EFF Meeting In Austin, Texas
 
 
By John Quarterman & Steve Jackson
 
 
In case any of you haven't seen it, here is Steve's meeting report. It
has previously appeared in EFFector Online, and I posted it to
austin.general on USENET. Incidentally, a couple of people have already asked
to be added to the eff-a@tic.com list; people who hadn't heard about the
meeting. This may indicate that there is a larger pool of interested people
out there.

An Austin meeting for those interested in the EFF and its mission was held
July 19 at the offices of Steve Jackson Games. About 60 people (50 or so
actively interested, and another 10 along for the ride) attended to cook hot
dogs, drink sodas and beer, and talk about Constitutional freedoms in the
electronic age. The meeting had been publicized almost exclusively over the
net and local BBSs; some attendees read about it first on the Well. Local media
were informed, but as far as we know, none mentioned it. I introduced the idea
of an Austin EFF chapter by pointing out that the EFF *has* no local chapters,
and one of the first missions of an Austin group - if we started one - would
be to find out what a local chapter was good for. Suggestions from the group
included:
 
* Liaison with local law enforcement groups, both to influence their attitudes
and to offer expert assistance and cooperation.
 
* Liaison with media: offering information, correcting errors, and if necessary
being ready to go to editorial boards if facts are consistently misrepresented.
 
* Education and communication with others: speaking at schools and club
meetings, writing opinion pieces for newspapers, and so on.
 
* Education and communication among ourselves. The issue of "Just what ARE
the laws regarding sysop liability?" was specifically raised.
 
* Direct political action: querying candidates on their stands on EFF-related
issues, and initiating legislation to preserve civil rights in the high-tech
age.
 
* More organized input into national EFF concerns, especially creation of
"ethical standards and practices."
 
* Recruitment of members for the national EFF.
 
* General networking among people with common interests. (Earl Cooley, sysop
of SMOF -an old and respected, but underutilized, local board) - volunteered
to host a local EFF discussion. SMOF, the `World's Oldest Online SF Convention,
can be reached at 512-467-7317. Four people - Bruce Sterling, John Quarterman,
Matt Lawrence and myself expressed willingness to serve on a local EFF board
"provided no one of us has to do all the work." Four seems to be about the
*minimum* workable number; we'll certainly be looking for more organizers.
Another attendee was a Houston civil-libertarian, representing a group of about
20 like-minded computer users; [This Is The World View]
A Houston EFF chapter is probably in the offing. 10 people signed up as
national EFF members at the meeting (several others had already joined),
and many more membership forms were distributed. A signup sheet was passed
around so that everyone could be contacted directly for further meetings.
And there will be more meetings; the "sense of the crowd" was clear on that.
Our four volunteers will now have to discuss the next step.
 
Thanks go to Loyd Blankenship, for making sure that all the food, drink and
furniture arrived at the right time and place; to Monica Stephens, Mike and
Brenda Hurst, and John Quarterman for assorted help with cooking, cleanup and
publicity; and to everyone who brought chairs and food!*********************

Newsletter of The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Volume I, Number 9, July 26,

"Think Globally, Act Locally"
 
We are really encouraged and a bit overwhelmed by the spontaneous interest in
forming chapters. In comp.org.eff.talk several other individuals offered to
help organize local chapters in different parts of the country .  Local
activities to promote EFF causes can be a major factor in civilizing the
frontier. Over the summer we will be thinking about what constitutes a good set
of ground rules for chapters and how to coordinate and support activities from
the already-busy EFF office. We'd certainly like to see more discussion on
comp.org.eff.talk about possible roles for local chapters. Thanks to Steve
Jackson for getting the ball rolling.

                              Editor's Comments
 
I hope this issue was informative! I am very pleased with the final draft.
There are terrible things happening right now that need to be stopped.
The Cyber-Generation that YOU are now apart of is being put down by the
immoral values and ignorance of those who call themselves "The Authority".
I beg of you to take part in the fight against this. It is a terrible thing.
Please fill out the EFF form and send those guys a few bucks. It is a well
spent investment and it is tax deductible. As we speak, the members of the
World View are preparing to get legislation governing computer users changed.
We have access to political officials who are willing to help us. And they
have access to Ann Richards, the Governor of the great state of Texas.
Hopefully developments will continue and we will be able to get an address
for you to write to so YOU can take part and express your opinion.
On a side note, I have heard of a certain individual who suggested that the
editors of this magazine might be condoning the use of drugs in our writing.
This is funny. I cannot remember where we ever wrote anything condoning or
promoting the use of drugs. Hell, I'll take a piss test for you. Evidently,
this person did not read the magazine and developed an opinion from here-say.
Oh well...no we do not condone drugs. I hope this answers your question.
We are a free-speech/information/editorial based publication.
I hope you all enjoy this issue. If you know of ANYONE who would like a
subscription, please send mail to (713)337-1452 (1:106/995) to The Desert
Fox. My user number there is 623. On Internet, it is: fox@nuchat.sccsi.com
You will be mailed the next issue on the date of release.
 
Thanks to all!         ...and remember  Don't Be Sorry...Be Careful!
