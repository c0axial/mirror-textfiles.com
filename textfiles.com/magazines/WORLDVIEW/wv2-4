                         EFF Meeting, World View On TV


    The weekend of May 2-3 was a very active one in cyberspace. The first
item on the agenda was to do a bit of television for Austin Public Access.
Dean Langston phoned us 3 days before the show was to go on. Therefore, I
had 3 days to pick a panel of speakers to rant about networks, civil
liberties, the EFF, and such. Those on the panel were in order from
left to right:

David Smith, spokesperson for EFF Austin.
Chris Goggans, Ex-Legion Of Doom, target of 1990 SS raids.
Jay Lee, Radio DJ for 90.1 KPFT Houston, moderator of the panel.
Steve Palmer, Houston Sysop.
George Phillips, Co-Editor of The World View, Sysop of a new Unix box.
Scott Davis, (thats me) Editor of The World View.
Carl Guderian, Representing 'Art Damage', provided us with excellent videos.

Two other 'masked hackers' appeared at the halfway point of the show to talk
about credit card abuse, phone phreaking, etc... The show lasted about
one hour, and for the most part, the feedback was positive. I thought the
show was fairly good considering that I had only 3 days to put it together.
It went out to 40,000 - 50,000 people on Saturday night at 8:00pm central
time.

The second item was the EFF general meeting

Many people attended the first EFF-Austin General meeting. Speakers included
John Quarterman, Ed Cavazos, and Steve Jackson. Topics ranged from the
latest on the SJG case against the Secret Service, to upcoming events such
as CyberTex and CyberDawg. All in all, it was a very constructive and
informative gathering. It was a great place to meet all the other 'cyberfolk'
that you only knew via E-Mail.

        A definitive guide to resources bringing you the future.....


By Andy Hawks (ahawks@nyx.cs.du.edu)


While no article that attempts to document an entire emerging subculture can be
complete, I will do my best to give you enough complete and accurate
information to get you on your way to the future.

This article will focus mainly on cyberpunk culture, rave culture, industrial,
post po-mo, virtual reality, drugs, computer underground, etc. Basically, the
elements that make up the developing techno-underground.

Included in this article will be: suggested readings -- books, magazines,
zines, requisite authors, etc., BBSes devoted to relevant topics, corporations
and merchandise geared toward the techno-aware, Internet e-mail addresses for
relevant figureheads in this area, suggested music and movies/videos, FTP
sites, etc.

I will do my best to update this article every so often, as the
techno-underground is not stagnant and is always shifting and changing and
moving forward.  If you have any complaints/comments/suggestions/errors or just
wanna send someone mail, write to me on the Internet - ahawks@nyx.cs.du.edu.

This article is intended to be a handy-dandy reference guide to subculture.  It
is NOT the place to look for "an intro to the computer underground" or an
"intro to raves" or anything like that - it's just a reference guide - a
cyberography, if you will (but please don't :-).

I am also cosysop of a BBS that specializes in freedom of information and the
computer underground - The Kracker Box BBS @ 303.438.1481.  However, as of this
writing, The Kracker Box is only 2400 baud, and Apple specific - ProTERM
Special Emulation is required to log on.  If you have an Apple and this stuff
interests you, give us a call!  Send feedback saying you got the number from
Hawkeye's article.

- -----all the information contained in this article is for information purposes
     only - I am not responsible for anything but me and all that - I disclaim
     everything I possibly can and all that other shit

- -----many thanks go out to The Butler for his article "An Introduction to the
     Computer Underground", which was an invaluable resource and model!

                            ON THE SUBJECT OF...

                   Our "Justice" System And It's Leaders

A commentary by: Cyndre the Grey

I think I'm going to join a police force and beat the hell out of the citizens.
Its nice to know you can do that these days!  I'm glad to see that there are
still ignorant little sheep citizens that will look the other way from
justice! Maybe someday, a cop will beat the hell out of them too!  I sure
hope so.  But they'd probably turn around and thank the officer for setting
them straight!

I would like to start off this commentary by stating that I think the jury
in the Rodney King case should be hung in the streets.  That should be
they're punishment for raping justice the way they did.  That's ok, they
now have to live with they're mindless decision for the rest of they're lives.
I really hope they stew in it!

Well, its been a while since my last article, but I'm back now in full force.
I think what has inspired this article is the Rodney King verdict.  After I
saw his gross and profane lack of justice, I wanted to start a revolution.
I think that is what this country needs anyway!

Its been a long time since we've taken up arms against our oppressors.
I think hat just about everyone reading this article can think of at least
one or two public officials that need to go up against the wall.  Hey,
I can't count on my fingers the number I know of that need to be terminated.
This seems the only way to get rid of this bad blood we have running this
country.

I don't know.  Maybe a firing squad is a bit too harsh but one way or another,
I think the people need to make a strong statement about what they think of our
leaders.  Sure, we voted these people into office, but chances are, they were
the lesser of two evils.  Come on!  Sure this is a free country!  You can vote
for the dog with flees, or the dog without flees!  Don't let them fool you.
One way or the other, both officials probably suck.  The question is, which one
sucks less!?!

I, for one, would like to see Ross Perot get elected into office.  True, I
don't believe in a lot of his ideals, but it would be a nice little slap in the
face to the other big parties.  Its time we show them that a change is
necessary if this country is going to continue.  If not, I fear there will
be a evolution.  I can't say I wouldn't join it either!

In short, lets start being a little more vocal.  Protests never hurt, and
it is your right as well as your duty.  Use it now, before they try to
take that from you too!

Cyndre

By The Desert Fox


    I realize this issue is somewhat late. It has been a busy month. Both
Cyndre and I have been working out butts off trying to get our systems
working and everything that is involved with getting on the net...
Everything looks smooth, though. My machine's name is Fennec, and his is
Ashpool. Therefore our internet addresses have changed. From now on, if
possible, please mail to us at the addresses on the header of this issue.
The old Taronga addresses still work, and our mail is forwarded to us,
but it is just a little more convenient. Please send all your subscription
requests to request@fennec.sccsi.com.
