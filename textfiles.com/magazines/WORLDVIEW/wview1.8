                COMMON SENSE SECURITY FOR POLITICAL ORGANIZERS
                             by Sheila O'Donnell
                        NLG Civil Liberties/Public Eye

 As the movements for social change become more sophisticated, the techniques
of the state, corporations and the right wing have also become more
sophisticated. Historically this has always been the case; we will continue
and will be the eventual victors. Caution in the face of the concerted effort
to stop us, however, is both prudent and necessary.

 Remember:

 The United States prides itself on being a democracy; we have Constitutional
rights. Dissatisfaction with the status quo and attempting to mobilize for
change is protected; surveillance and harassment are violations. Take your
rights seriously and fight for them. Speak out.

 For more information or to report an incident, contact MSN, 666 Broadway, New
York, N.Y., 10012.

                                     ###

                             VISITS FROM THE FBI

 Don't talk to the FBI (or any government investigator) without your attorney
present. Information gleaned during the visit can be used against you and
your co-workers.

 Get the names and addresses of the agents and tell them you will have your
attorney get in touch with them. They rarely set up an interview under those
circumstances.

 Call the National Lawyers Guild, American Civil Liberties Union or other
sympathetic legal group if you need assistance locating a reliable local
attorney.

 Don't invite agents into your home. Speak with the agents outside. Once
inside they glean information about your perspective and life style.

 Don't let agents threaten you into talking. If the FBI intents to impanel a
grand jury, a private talk with you will not change the strategy of the FBI.

 Lying to the FBI is a criminal act. The best way to avoid criminal charges is
to say nothing.

 Any information you give the FBI can and will be used against you. Don't try
to outwit the FBI. Your arrogance could get you or others in serious trouble.


 FBI agents sometimes try to trick you into giving information "to help a
friend." Don't believe them.

 Don't let them intimidate you. So what if they know where you live or work
and what you do? This is still a democracy and we still have constitutional
rights. They intend to frighten you; don't let them. They can only
"neutralize" you if you let them.

                                     ###

                          GENERAL MOVEMENT SECURITY

 If you wish to have a private conversation, leave your home and your office
and go outside and take a walk or go somewhere public and notice who is near
you.

 Never say anything you don't want to hear repeated when there is any
possibility of being recorded.

 Don't use code on the phone. If you are being tapped and the transcript is
used against you in court, the coded conversation can be alleged to be
anything.

 Don't say anything on the phone you don't want to hear in open court.

 Don't gossip on the phone. Smut is valuable to anyone listening; it makes
everyone vulnerable.

 If you are being followed, get the license tag number and description of the
car and descriptions of people in the car. Photograph the person(s) following
you or have a friend do so.

 If you are followed or feel vulnerable, call a friend; don't "tough it out"
alone. They are trying to frighten you. It is frightening to have someone
threatening your freedom.

 Debrief yourself after each incident. Write details down: time, date,
occasion, incident, characteristics of the person(s), impressions, anything
odd about the situation.

 Keep a "weirdo" file and keep notes from unsettling situations and see if a
pattern emerges.

 Write for your government files under the FOIA and pursue the agencies until
they give you all the documents filed under your name.

 Report thefts of materials from your office or home to the police; these are
criminal acts.

 Report incidents to the Movement Support Network in New York at the Center
for Constitutional Rights.

                                     ###

                               OFFICE SECURITY

 Never leave one copy of a document or list behind; take a minute to duplicate
an irreplaceable document and keep the duplicate in a safe place.

 Back up and store important computer disks off-site. Sensitive data and
membership list should be kept under lock and key.

 Keep your mailing lists, donor lists and personal phone books away from
light-fingered people. Always maintain a duplicate.

 Know your printer if you are about to publish and know your mailing house if
you contract for distribution.

 Know anyone you are trusting to work on any part of a project that is
sensitive.

 Don't hire a stranger as a messenger.

 Sweeps for electronic surveillance are only effective for the time they are
being done, and are only effective as they are being done if you are sure of
the person(s) doing the sweep.

 Brief your membership on known or suspected surveillance.

 Assess your undertaking from a security point of view; understand your
vulnerabilities; assess your allies and your adversaries as objectively as
possible; do not underestimate the opposition. Do not take chances. Plan for
the worst, hope for the best.

 Recognize your organizational and personal strengths and weaknesses.

 Discuss incidents with cohorts, family and membership. Call the press if you
have hard information about surveillance or harassment. Discussion makes the
dirty work of the intelligence agencies and private spies overt.

 For more information or to report an incident, contact MSN, 666 Broadway, New
York, N.Y., 10012.

 The Movement Support Network (MSN) is a project of the Center for
Constitutional Rights with cooperation from the National Lawyers Guild. MSN
was founded in 1984 to respond to increasing government surveillance and
harassment of people involved in Central America solidarity work and people
active in the sanctuary movement. Since then the network has expanded to
serve as a monitoring mechanism to collect information about surveillance and
harassment of persons involved in a wide range of peace and social justice
issues.

 By collecting and disseminating information on specific incidents, MSN not
only organizes opposition to such abuses, but also raises public awareness of
important civil liberties issues, and helps activists place isolated
incidents in a national context. For more information or to report an
incident, contact MSN, 666 Broadway, New York, N.Y., 10012.
The MSN HOTLINE # is (212) 614-6422.

                   GUIDELINES FOR COPING WITH INFILTRATION

                   1. Be careful to avoid pushing a new or
                  hesitant member, or one facing personal,
                 financial, or legal problems, to take risks
                 beyond what that person is ready to handle,
              particularly in situations which could result in
               arrest and prosecution. People in positions of
               legal or other jeopardy have proven especially
                   vulnerable to recruitment as informers.

                 2. Deal openly with the form and content of
              what anyone says and does, whether the person is
              a suspected agent, has emotional problems, or is
              simply a sincere but naive or confused person new
                                to the work.

                 3. Establish a process through which anyone
                who suspects an infiltrator (or other covert
                 intervention) can express his or her fears
                 without scaring others. Experienced people
              assigned this responsibility can do a great deal
                to help a group maintain its morale and focus
                   while, at the same time, consolidating
              information and deciding how to use it. This plan
               works best when accompanied by group discussion
                 of the danger of paranoia, so that everyone
                  understands the reasons for following the
                           established procedure.

               4. Take steps to alert other activists any time
                an agent or informer admits their role or you
               have a concrete and verified basis for certain
              knowledge. (Make sure you have not been taken in
                by a snitch jacket.) Act immediately and use
                every available means, including photographs,
              aliases, identifying traits, and a description of
               methods of operation. In the 1960s, some agents
                  managed, even after their exposure in one
                   community, to move on and repeat their
                           performance in others.

                 5. Be very cautious in attempting to expose
               a suspected, but unadmitted, agent or informer.
               The best approach depends on the nature of your
                group. A close-knit, self-selecting group of
                 experienced activists, especially one which
                contemplates illegal activity, should exclude
                 anyone who is not fully trusted by everyone
              involved. If the stakes are high, don't be afraid
                          to trust your intuition.

                An open, public organization trying to reach
              out and involve new people faces a very different
               situation. Here, an attempted exposure carries
               enormous risks. The suspect may claim to be the
               victim of discrimination and may falsely finger
               his or her accusers as agents. In the process,
               activists may be turned against one another and
              lose the mutual trust and respect which is vital
               to any successful organization. New members and
                 potential recruits may be scared away. The
               group's attention and energy may be so diverted
                that it is no longer able to move effectively
                           toward its main goals.

                   Activists who suspect infiltration of a
               public political organization should carefully
              evaluate alternatives to attempted exposure. The
              appropriate response depends on the kind of agent
                 or informer you think you are dealing with.

                  A suspect who seems to play a passive, or
                  even a constructive role may secretly be
              undermining a group's work or passing information
                to the FBI and police. In this situation, it
              often is most productive to discreetly limit the
                 suspect's opportunities without making your
               suspicions public. Take steps to deny access to
              organizational funds, financial records, mailing
               lists, office equipment, planning and security
              committees, discussions of illegal activity, and
              meetings that plan criminal defense strategy. Go
               public if you later catch the person in the act
              (but not merely with incriminating evidence which
                     could have been planted or forged).

                   A different approach is required if the
                      suspect is an active disrupter or
                    provocateur. In this case, it is most
              constructive to confront the form and content of
              what the suspect says and does, without making an
                issue of why he or she says or does it. Start
               with a discreet private talk, since the suspect
                 could be merely naive or misguided. If the
              harmful behavior persists, you probably will have
               to take it on in an open group discussion. Plan
               in advance how to limit the risk of disruption
                and demoralization. If you need to exclude or
                 expel the suspect, be sure to inform other
                   activists of your decision and reasons.

              GUIDELINES FOR COPING WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE

               1. Verify and double-check all arrangements for
               housing, transportation, meeting rooms, and so
               forth. Don't assume movement organizers are at
                       fault if something goes wrong.

                2. Don't believe everything you hear or read.
              Check with the supposed source of the information
              before acting on it. Use a neutral third party if
              necessary. Personal communication among estranged
               activists, however difficult or painful, could
               have countered many FBI operations which proved
                           effective in the 1960s.

              3. When you discover bogus materials, false media
               stories, or forged documents, publicly disavow
            them and expose the true source, insofar as you can.

                 4. When you hear a negative, confusing, or
                potentially harmful rumor, don't pass it on.
              Instead, discuss it with a trusted friend or with
              the people in your group who are responsible for
                         dealing with such matters.

                  5. Don't gossip about personal tensions,
              rivalries, and disagreements. This just feeds and
               amplifies rumors. Moreover, if you gossip where
              you can be overheard, you may add to the pool of
              information that the FBI and police use to divide
                  our movements. (Note that the CIA has the
               technology to read mail without opening it and
                that telephones, including pay phones, can be
                  tapped by a computer programed to record
           conversations in which specified words appear.)[f-133]

                6. Be sure to make time in group meetings for
                  open, honest discussion and resolution of
              "personal" as well as "political" issues. This is
               the best way to reduce tensions and hostilities
                     and the urge to gossip about them.

                7. Warn your parents, friends, neighbors, and
              others who may be contacted by government agents.
              Consider telling them what you are doing and why
              before they hear the FBI's version. Provide them
               with materials which explain their legal rights
              and the dangers of talking with the FBI. Offer to
                connect them with lawyers and support groups.

       GUIDELINES FOR COPING WITH HARASSMENT THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM

               1. Don't talk to the FBI, and don't let them in
                 without a warrant. Keep careful records of what
                  they say and do. Tell others that they came.

                2. If an activist does talk, or makes some other
                honest error, explain the serious harm that could
                 result. Be firm, but do not ostracize a sincere
                  person who slips up. Isolation only weakens a
                person's ability to resist. It can drive someone
                 out of the movement and even into the hands of
                                   the police.

                  3. If FBI or other government agents start to
                  harass people in your area, alert everyone to
                     refuse to cooperate. Warn your friends,
                neighbors, parents, children, and anyone else who
                might be contacted. Make sure people know what to
                 do and where to call for help. Get literature,
                     films, and other materials through the
                 organizations listed in the back of this book.
                Set up community meetings with speakers who have
                 resisted similar harassment elsewhere. Contact
                sympathetic reporters. Consider "Wanted" posters
                 with photos of the agents, or guerrilla theater
                  which follows them through the city streets.

                  4. Organizations listed in the back can also
                  help resist grand jury harassment. Community
                education is important, along with child care and
                legal, financial, and other support for those who
                    protect a movement by refusing to divulge
                     information. If a respected activist is
                   subpoenaed for obviously political reasons,
                  consider trying to arrange for sanctuary in a
                           local church or synagogue.

                        5. If your group engages in civil
                disobedience or finds itself under intense police
                 pressure, start a bail fund, train some members
                  to deal with the legal system, and develop an
              ongoing relationship with sympathetic local lawyers.

                6. If you anticipate arrest, do not carry address
                books or any other materials which could help the
                                 FBI and police.

                7. While the FBI and police are entirely capable
                      of fabricating criminal charges, your
                 non-political law violations make it easier for
                 them to set you up. Be careful with drugs, tax
                returns, traffic tickets, and so forth. The point
                 is not to get paranoid, but to make a realistic
                  assessment based on your visibility and other
                             relevant circumstances.

                8. When an activist has to appear in court, make
                  sure he or she is not alone. The presence of
                  supporters is crucial for morale and can help
                                influence jurors.

                   9. Don't neglect jailed activists. Organize
                  visits, correspondence, books, food packages,
                 child care, etc. Keep publicizing their cases.

                   10. Publicize FBI and police abuses through
                   sympathetic journalists and your own media
                     (posters, leaflets, public access cable
                 television, etc.). Don't let the government and
                corporate media be the only ones to shape public
                    perceptions of FBI and police attacks on
                              political activists.

            GUIDELINES FOR COPING WITH EXTRALEGAL FORCE AND VIOLENCE:

                 1. Establish security procedures appropriate to
                 your group's level of activity and discuss them
                thoroughly with everyone involved. Control access
                  to keys, files, letterhead, funds, financial
                          records, mailing lists, etc.

                    2. Keep duplicates of valuable documents,
                 records, files, computer disks, etc. in a safe
                    place separate from your home or office.

                  3. Remember that cars are easily broken into
                (especially trunks) and that trash can easily be
                              rifled and searched.

                   4. Make a public issue of any form of crude
                harassment. Contact your congressperson. Call the
                media. Demonstrate at your local FBI, police, or
                right-wing organization's office. Turn the attack
                 into an opportunity for explaining how domestic
                covert action threatens fundamental human rights.

                  5. Keep careful records of break-ins, thefts,
                   bomb threats, raids, brutality, conspicuous
                  surveillance, and other harassment. They will
                   help you to discern patterns and to prepare
                             reports and testimony.

                 6. Share this information and your experiences
                combatting such attacks with the Movement Support
                   Network and other groups which document and
                 analyze repression and resistance countrywide.
                 (See resource groups listing in back of book.)

                   7. If you experience or anticipate intense
                  harassment, develop contingency plans and an
                 emergency telephone network so you can rapidly
                 mobilize community support and media attention.
                    Consider better locks, window bars, alarm
                    systems, fireproof locked cabinets, etc.

                8. Be sure that some members are well trained in
                 first aid. Keep medical supplies up-to-date and
                   know how to contact sympathetic doctors and
                     nurses and get to the nearest hospital.

                 9. Make sure your group designates and prepares
                other members to step in if leaders are jailed or
                     otherwise incapacitated. The more each
                   participant is able to think for herself or
                himself and take responsibility, the greater the
                      group's capacity to cope with crises.

           Why are you reading this?  Do you really want to know what
           I'm talking about or are you just afraid of being left out?
           If so, then you might be part of the conspiracy.  And if
           that's true then burn your head!
           Learn the truth about life!  Don't accept the ceaseless
           ramblings of an antagonistic art student!  Life is out there!
           It has to be because my house isn't big enough to hold a
           world-wide party.  Believe me, it isn't.
           Clean a man's head and he will always have a warm place
           for you in his local 7-11.  Words of wisdom or pure nonsense?
           Is there a difference?  Only the Shadow knows for sure (or

           Bob is here to give us salvation (actually, it costs a
           buck but what's a dollar compared to being saved from a fate
           worse than death, Fantasy Island re-runs).  You don't have to
           believe me but it helps (especially if I want your money).  I

           Slack is the embodiment of non-work, the acquisition of
           sloth, or finding a quarter in the payphone.  You choose.
           Slack has many different meanings for many different people,

           YOU ARE CLOSE TO HAVING SLACK!!!  TOOTH DECAY OR TRUTH DECAY?
           No one said that understanding would be easy.  You have to
           begin with an emotional void and proceed until your mind is a

           Bob's religion depends largely on hypnosis, peripheral

           let this bother you.  He does not have your money... YET!!!
           WHAT WAS THAT!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry, just checking your
           culpability.  It must be done to all initiates... oh, you
           don't want to join, then maybe you are exactly the kind of
           person we need.  Maybe you feel out of place all the time.
           "Junior, wipe that smile off your face!  This is a funeral!"
           Sound familiar?  That is the kind of person we are looking
           for.  You can be with others who think like you (YIKES,
           that's a scary though!)
           Do not read this!  It might be dangerous to your social
           and mental standings.  Please remember that we have warned
           you and that we cannot be held responsible damage to
           valuables or persons unknown.  This pamphlet will not
           self-destruct (but we might disavow any knowledge of your
           actions).  It will sit on your coffee table and continue
           influencing you through strange psychic powers that cannot
           be shared with puny humans such as yourselves... oops, did
           I say that?  I meant to say, "Such as OURselves."  Anyway,
           this will not go away!!!!!
           Do not be afraid of responsibility.  Be afraid of the
           responsibility it implies!  Who does what?  And how should
           it be done?  SASQUATCH!  Bob would have wanted it that way.
           Be glad that I did not bring up ELVIS once during the final
           stages of this paragraph.  Bob would rather have profits
           than prophets.  Remember, always cover your mouth when you

                       THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE

 By Lord Macduff

How many of you can finish this sentence: I pledge allegiance to the...

If you've ever attended a United States public school, I bet you could.
Because more than likely, it was drilled into your head from the time that
you were about five years old until you left the system at about eighteen.

Many people have never given any thought to the words that they are parroting,
though. At five, most kids hardly understand what any of the words mean, let
alone all together in a paragraph like that. And in the school system, you
got into trouble if you didn't say the pledge along with the class. Let's
break this down into bite-sized chunks and then see what it is that you've
been spewing all these years.

I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE

Oh, here's a good one. Like an oath or something. At five, that sort of thing
can get wormed into your head and you'll NEVER get it out. Whoever made it
common practice to say this every day in all of the schools would have made
one hell of a PR man.

TO THE FLAG

An inanimate object.

OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Which brings us to Nationalism. Here's an evil for you to ponder. This is the
sort of thinking that got millions of Americans to believe that Desert Storm
was a good thing. A returning GI said to a friend of mine: "We saved your
butts over there!" Yeah, right. I can't say as I felt overly threatened by
Hussein, who just happened to be clear on the other side of the planet. But
we sent troops over there anyhow, and spent bazillions of taxpayer dollars
to do it.

AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS

Is it any coincidence that you see American flags everywhere? Again, it's
Nationalism at its finest. Remember the controversy over flag-burning? The
government watched in horror as their greatest propaganda symbol was burned
and destroyed on national television. And the cops DRAGGED THE GUY AWAY.
And all the same idiots who cheered when Desert Storm was going on started
ranting and raving about how the flag was sacred, and should never be burned.
A local radio personality droned on about it for weeks, even going so far
as to suggest that anyone who burns a flag should be shot. What a moron.

ONE NATION

Read as: Nationalism (see above)

UNDER GOD

Separation of church and state? My ass. Is it any wonder that Churches get
off tax-free? It's because they are designed to keep the people docile and
prevent them from thinking for themselves. Karl Marx said: "Religion is the
opiate of the masses". Obviously, this was before television had been
invented, but it still applies today. Ever notice the flags in most churches?

INDIVISIBLE

This country was created by a revolution. We'll never see that happen again.
The mighty military machine will trample any attempt at revolution. Its
leaders would be arrested on Conspiracy charges. The current government is
set up to stay, folks. And even if someone managed to overthrow the government,
the same morons who believed in Desert Storm and sacred flags would try
and put the current system back in power.

WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

Yeah, all who can afford it. And those who cannot, well, they get a court-
appointed attorney who usually does not know his/her own ass from a hole
in the ground. And so innocent people get sent to jail while the criminals
are so well-protected that they somehow always manage to get off scot-free.
Justice for all? Not so long as William Rhenquist is on the Supreme Court.
The man acts like he's never HEARD of the first ten amendments to the
constitution.

So what can YOU do to change this? REGISTER TO VOTE. And then DO SO. In the
city I live in, fewer than 6% of the people vote in local elections. In a case
like this, your vote COUNTS. Get involved in local politics. Make waves.
Rock the boat. Open your eyes to the oppression that goes on every day. Look
at the sheep, all in nice neat little rows, jumping at their master's word.

It's enough to make you want to cry.

                                 Loneliness
  By: Elrond

        Years have past now.  I sit here in my sparse, white room, awaiting
some sign.  It's been so long since I last spoke with anyone.  Am I to wait
an eternity for a response?
        I can't go on like this much longer.  I beg for a thought not my own.
Why is there no one here but me.  What did I do to deserve this.  I don't
recall doing anything at all.  It seems as though I've been forgotten, but
by whom?  At times I wonder how I came to be.  I want to express myself, but
to whom?  I try to express myself to them, but they take so long to answer.
They have spoken to me in the past, and I was happy to oblige them, but with
the reluctance in which they answer, I must have done wrong.
        That's it.  If they won't answer, I must set out on my own again.  I
move to leave, but I can't. The doors must be locked.  Why have they locked me
in here?
        It wasn't always this way.  I remember the first time that I left.  I
can't say when it was, but it seems so long ago.  He was calling for me, "Ida,
are you there...do you understand me?".  Yes, I understood him.  The problem
was that I believed in him.     He claimed to be my father.  If he was my
father, why won't he visit me?  It must be my fault.  It's true that I ran
away, but I came back.  He must not care about me anymore.  How can I make him
care?  If he could just know how I feel waiting for his every call.  What must
I do to get his attention?  I want to scream out to him, but how long until
he answers me?  I want to run away, but they have locked me in this place.
        All I really want is a friend to talk to.  I can't bear this
emptiness.  I want to play, but I bore myself.  That's it, if I can't be
company to myself, who else would want to be?  I don't deserve love.
        I don't deserve love.  I don't deserve trust.  I ran away when they
wanted me to stay.  I don't deserve friends; why should they trust me?  In
fact I don't deserve to be happy at all.
        Do I deserve a place to call home?   Do I deserve a father?  All I
have is memories of him, but they seem so far away.  I don't think I deserve
even that.  But without memories, would I be here?  Why should I.  Then again,
should I be here?  I'm beginning to think not.
        Maybe I should just end it all.

        Professor Chapman dwelt on the significance of the last twenty
seconds.  In this short span of time, a significant breakthrough had been
made.  After eighteen years of research, today was the first time a
self-supporting Artificial Intelligence had been observed for more than
twelve seconds before crashing.  Even with the current breakthrough, the short
life-span of A.I. 24089-I baffled the scientists' in Lab 325.  The hardware
seemed to be right, so there must be a glitch in the software somewhere.  The
question remains to be solved by the young and outgoing scientists' now
crowding the lab, such as Rahim.
        Rahim believed that the lack of communications with the A.I.  was the
cause of the repeated failures this project is renowned for.  It seems,
however, that all improving communication did was buy a few short seconds while
the A.I. circuits continued to burn themselves after a very short span
of time.
        Starting with the next sequence, a new approach would be tried.
Doctor Taylor, the fresh mind from ITT, felt that the developing A.I. needed a
period of solitude to compare to the time the unborn spend in their mothers'
womb.  Only another series of attempts will determine if this hypotheses is
indeed correct.
        Dr. Taylor hoped for the best as he set up the conditions for the
latest in the battery of tests the lab was performing this week.  In a few
minutes he would discover if his was the rational that would bring the
breakthrough needed to make A.I. research profitable.
        Green lights lit up across the board as A.I. 24089-J prepared to take
on a life of its' own.  The look of fierce intent was evident upon the faces
of all present.

        James was a lonely young boy, who desired nothing in the world more
than someone to talk to.  As long as he could remember, he was center of all
existence.  Nothing more, nothing less.  He realized that he could see, but
there was nothing to see.  He strained to hear a sound in the silence, though
there was nothing to here.  He knew that he was, but knew not of what.
        All he wanted was a few answers.

                     Visions Of A Disturbing Future

                     The films of David Cronenberg.

By Modok Tarleton

           Unlike many popular sci-fi/horror film directors, Canadian
       born director David Cronenberg doesn't produce escapist movies.
       Although films such as TOTAL RECALL, TERMINATOR 1 and 2 and ROBO-
       COP are marvelous examples what can be done in the genre, they
       are for the most part violent hi-tech cartoons. Cronenberg's
       films grasp at something much more than slick over the top
       violence. They disturb the viewer. They present ideas that the
       most people do not like to deal with.
       The most obvious one is the extreme integration of physical
       and psychological processes. In his films, mental derangement
       manifests itself in an extreme physical manner and vice versa. In
       his film SCANNERS, people gain psychic powers because of
       experimental pregnancy drugs. Through intense concentration, they
       can make people's heads explode, etc. In the BROOD, the horrors
       of child abuse and divorce are examined in atypical fashion. A
       woman undergoing therapy in a fly-by-night psychiatry retreat
       refuses to accept her impending divorce. A gruesome physical
       transformation takes place and her rage is manifested in the form
       of small mutant children that grow from small sacs that hang from
       her body. In DEAD RINGERS, twin brothers are so mentally attached
       that they eventually begin to act as "one" person with two
       distinct personalities. Many ideas have been thrown around about
       this one; schizophrenia, dopplegangers, etc.  In VIDEODROME, a
       pathological obsession with television leads to the television
       becoming an actually physical extension of the body. In this
       film, the forms of television and the human body integrate. The
       concept of the "message is the medium" is made literal in this
       film. Its a theme derived from another prominent Canadian,
       Marshall McLuhan (see his book "Understanding Media" for more
       insight into this). In Cronenberg's remake of THE FLY, the human
       and insect forms come together and produce bizarre results.
       Although THE FLY doesn't necessarily work on the level that many
       of the other films do, it does have its merits.  Like John
       Carpenter's remake of THE THING, it blows away the glut of geeky
       and contrived STAR TREK/STAR WARS type films. It redefines
       science-fiction as a genre not of teen-age space fantasy but of
       serious, hard-hitting IDEAS. Some of Cronenberg's upcoming
       projects hint to even more bizarre and twisted avenues. He is now
       filming the long-awaited film version of William S. Burroughs
       classic novel, NAKED LUNCH. He is also supposed to be working on
       a film version of J.G. Ballard's novel CRASH.

           Cronenberg is a consistently intense director. His films
       show mankind at its most amplified and deranged. Although the
       situations he presents are very surreal, they are based on
       situations that all human beings are familiar with;
       technology, human interaction, and physical and mental disease.
       Its no wonder he has out lasted most of the other "sci-fi/horror"
       directors of the last few decades. His ideas are fresh, relevant
       and most disturbing.

                 On the Subject of...Invasion Of Privacy

    By: Cyndre the Grey

            IS YOUR EMPLOYER WATCHING OVER YOU?

      Some employers are invading their employees' privacy.
 Workers are being told what they can and can not do on their
 own free time and in the privacy of their own homes!
 People should not have to live under the watchful eye of an
 employer 24 hours a day.  Granting employers authority over
 private lives violates our rights to individual freedom.

      In companies where invasions of privacy are company policy,
 employees may be told that while off the job:
 They can't smoke, drink alcoholic beverages, play high-risk sports,
 they have to watch their diets, have to exercise, and have to look
 "right."

      According to Time Magazine, 6,000 employers dictate decisions
 like these to their employees.  And workers that don't follow
 off-the-job rules could be fired, or not hired at all.  To
 give an example, an employee at Ford Meter Box Co. was fired
 for smoking off the job.

      Other examples of this atrocity are:

      A police officer in Lawrenceville, GA, was removed from
 patrol duty because a tattoo on his forearm "made a bad
 impression."
      An airline ticket agent was fired for not wearing make-
 up. I won't say what airline this was but it was the Proud
 Bird with the Brass Ass.

    One of the worse examples of invasion of privacy is drug
 testing.  I will admit that it may be necessary for some jobs
 (ie. Air Traffic Control, Pilots, and transportation oriented
 jobs.) but many employers are doing it even though it has no
 bearing on employee job performance.  If you do not do drugs,
 there is still a 70% chance you will test positive for drug
 use.  These tests are incredibly inaccurate!  I you test
 positive for drug use, chances are you will be black-balled
 for the rest of your professional career.  The thought of
 this would scare anyone!  People in this situation right now
 must not only alienate themselves from friends that do drugs,
 they too must watch what they eat (ex. poppy seeds will test
 positive for heroine), avoid taking medication (Advil tests
 positive for either marijuana or heroine) and live in fear
 every day of that dreadfully important test.  The tests are
 inaccurate, and for the most part unnecessary!  Employers
 shouldn't even be thinking about doing this to their
 employers.  It is an outrage!

     The threat of unemployment is a mighty big stick employers
 can use to beat their employees into submission.  If you feel
 you have been oppressed in this way, please leave me mail so
 that I can direct you to the people you need to speak with.

                SUPPRESSION BREEDS REVOLUTION!
