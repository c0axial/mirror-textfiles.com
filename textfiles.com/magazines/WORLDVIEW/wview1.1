Title:     The Shockwave Rider. (background on Robert T. Morris Jr., author
           of the Internet 'worm')
Author:    Unknown

Summary:   A profile of Robert T. Morris Jr, author of the 'worm' program
which caused major system crashes on the Internet network in Nov 1988, is
presented.  Morris is the son of Robert Tappan Morris Sr, the chief computer
scientist of the National Security Agency's Computer Security center and a
master cryptographer.  Morris junior ('RTM') identified with the protagonist
of John Brunner's science fiction novel 'The Shockwave Rider,' a social rebel
who outsmarts computer security measures and is forced to make a
controversial decision.  Some hackers view RTM as a 'freedom fighter,' but
some say he is placing freedom of information at risk. The younger Morris was
known for computer pranks while an undergraduate at Harvard and worked on
graphics problems as a Cornell University graduate student.  He was allegedly
bored and created the Internet worm as an experiment; it was designed to
replicate itself throughout the umbrella Internet network and exploited
well-known bugs in the Unix operating system.  It struck academic, military
and commercial scientific research sites, consuming memory and causing
machines to grind to a halt.  Many computer security experts argue that RTM
should not be punished, but many worry about the social implications of
computer security: more and more systems will require cumbersome 'locks'
which will make it difficult for legitimate users to access information.

The Shockwave Rider "ONCE YOU RELEASED this worm, did you have any ability to
control it?"  the defense attorney asked the defendant.

"No.  Once I released it, I had essentially no contact with it at all.  I
couldn't control it," said the young man, facing the jury in the Syracuse,
New York, courtroom.  "After it started, it was pretty much doing its own
thing."

Robert Tappan Morris, the creator of the Internet computer worm, patiently
told the courtroom packed with TV and newspaper reporters how his secret
experiment had gone terribly awry.

In the front row of the courtroom sat a slender man holding a copy of Livy's
History of Rome.  The man's suit was worn, his shoes untied, his gray beard
unkempt.  But he just happened to be an internationally known computer
security expert, master cryptographer, and the National Security Agency's top
computer scientist.  His name: Robert Morris, Sr.

"It was a mistake, and I am sorry for it," said the younger Morris, his
large, watery eyes focused on the jury. Minutes later, at the lunch break,
the prosecutor walked past the defendant, and the young hacker couldn't
suppress a smile.  His soft, pale checks seemed to rise into a smirk.  Was he
giggling?

"The work of a bored graduate student," was Morris senior's explanation to
The New York Times after his son released the most virulent worm the world
had ever seen.  Indeed, the younger Morris did seem bored at Cornell, where
he was only a few weeks into his graduate studies.  Two weeks before the
worm's release, Peter McIlroy, a childhood friend, had visited Morris.  "He
liked some classes and not others," McIlroy remembers.  "Some he seemed to be
blowing off."

But Morris seemed to be getting along in Ithaca.  He had taken to
rock-climbing and was playing intramural hockey.  "There was no inkling he
was about to write a computer worm," recalls his friend.  Except, perhaps,
for one clue.  McIlroy, also a techie, had casually mentioned to his friend
that he believed the Unix operating system was pretty secure.

"No!  It's unbelievably insecure!"  Morris snapped.  "It's unbelievable how
many holes there are!"

McIlroy was caught off-guard by Morris's fervor.  "It bothered and surprised
him that the holes would never get fixed."

Was it as simple as that?  Bored by his courses, had the son of the nation's
leading computer security expert taken things into his own hands?  Had the
"attack" merely been a well-intended but bungled attempt to shore up computer
security and teach the world a valuable, relatively safe lesson?

Theories on the worm and its author's motivations consume several chapters of
popular books and countless articles.  Some have hypothesized that the worm
was a high-tech, father-son spat played out on a global scale, while one book
blithely concluded that father and son had jointly launched the attack under
the auspices of the National Security Agency.

Hackers saw a broader political motivation.  The trial of Robert Morris
became the trial of an entire generation and philosophy of computers and
information.  To many hackers, Morris became a freedom fighter, a symbol of
electronic free speech, a voice against the power that centralized computers
wield over individuals.

But more than a few hackers wondered if the coup was misguided, if Morris was
not placing at risk the very freedom of information that his supporters
angrily demanded.

At the center of the debate stood two elite hackers, the very sort of wizards
we have come to expect to guard us against computer saboteurs.  But that was
before Morris stepped over the line and plunged into a digital no-man's land.

Under provisions of the untested 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Robert
Tappan Morris, Jr., was indicted for trespass.  His offense?  Unauthorized
computer access.

THE STORY OF ROBERT TAPPAN MORRIS begins with his father and the hauntingly
powerful electronic world he helped to create.  In the early 1970s, when Bell
Laboratories began designing the universal operating system called Unix, it
was Morris senior who imbued the virgin software with security.

"The scheme for encrypting passwords was very heavily influenced by him, the
interest in low-grade cryptography--the things we think of as absolutely
routine," says Douglas McIlroy, Peter's father and one of the designers of
Unix at Bell Labs' Murray Hill, New Jersey, facility.  The elder Morris
helped bar snoopers by making it difficult for anyone to become a "super
user"--a person with the power to use or abuse a system.

"There was this constant game of trying to figure out how to circumvent the
best security measures we had," McIlroy recalls.  "You had to be able to
out-think the most devious minds."

That was the dilemma Morris senior faced: to protect, he had to know how to
destroy.

Morris senior often seemed locked in an elusive battle with the equally
brilliant and eccentric Ken Thompson, a legend in the computer industry and
widely respected as one of the inventors of Unix.  "Each would try to outdo
the other in a friendly, but mean-spirited, way," McIlroy says.

Morris thrived in the daily skirmishes.  One of the cryptic scientist's most
revealing feats occurred during tests on the first working copy of the Multix
operating system.  He walked into the laboratory and typed two
characters--two specific characters he had a hunch the system could not
compute.  The machine crashed.  "It was dramatic," says McIlroy.  "He always
liked to put on an air of mystery."

First Bell and then other companies invited Morris to break into their
computer centers to test their defenses.  Hired by one defense contractor to
discover its computer system's Achilles' heel, Morris dressed himself as a
security guard, walked in, and watched someone type a password.  While this
tactic was an exception (Morris usually broke systems with his encyclopedic
knowledge of encryption, cryptography, and computer security), it
demonstrated his dramatic side.  "Bob had a certain amount of flair," recalls
McIlroy.  "He definitely enjoyed his prowess."

By the 1980s, the chain-smoking, shabbily dressed scientist had developed
into a master cryptographer and a world expert in protecting electronic
information.  He designed a Navy computer that tracked enemy submarines by
spotting anomalies in the masses of data gleaned by ocean sensors.  At the
time it was the world's largest computer.

Morris senior's stage broadened in 1986, when he became the chief scientist
at the National Computer Security Center of the National Security Agency and
assumed responsibility for protecting sensitive computer-based data
worldwide.  Friends reported that he dove into the mysterious intelligence
underworld with a passion.  His office was outfitted with a "Tempest"
computer, encased in lead to prevent the interception of radio emissions, and
visitors say his blackboard was covered with Russian words.

Years later, in the tumultuous days following the Internet attack, Morris
senior's sense of mystery and drama had not waned.  Newspaper and TV
reporters camped in front of his new home in Arnold, Maryland.  Inside, his
son was quiet, talking little even to his Harvard buddies who had driven
through the night to support their friend.

It was his father who spoke to the press, telling The New York Times, "I know
a few dozen people in the country who could have [created the worm].  I could
have done it, but I'm a darned good programmer."  Perhaps it was not
surprising that after the press left, Morris senior placed the puzzling deed
in historical focus.  "Let's find out where this all started," he said to his
son's friends, pulling down a book by John Brunner titled The Shockwave
Rider.

In a scholarly tone, Morris senior explained that the 1976 science fiction
classic, one of his son's favorites, popularized the idea of computer worms.
What he didn't explain was that the book's protagonis was remarkably similar
to himself.  And to his son.  Like both Morrises, the Shockwave Rider
outsmarted computer security measures with the cunning of a secret agent and,
like Robert Morris, Jr., the Shockwave Rider was forced by his genius to make
a difficult, controversial decision.  Having spent his youth expanding his
computer powers, the Shockwave Rider pondered the true test of wisdom:

"What a wise man can do, that can't be done by someone who's merely clever,
is make a right judgment in an unprecedented situation."

YOUNG MORRIS MAY HAVE BEEN CHARGED with the crime of the future, but he grew
up in a world closer to the last century than the next.  The Morris family
lived in a 250-year-old farmhouse on nine rambling acres of spruce, pine, and
swamp alongside the Passaic River near the quaint town of Millington, New
Jersey.  The children cared for the farm animals and Robert tended the
family's sheep.

"They wanted to keep the old ways," recalls the current owner of the house.
"They lived very simply.  They didn't have material things."  The family grew
vegetables in a 50-by-100-foot garden, and if they needed something more than
the earth and animals could supply, Morris senior would bring home a cast-off
to salvage, like the giant-size freezer he repaired to store their freshly
slaughtered meat.  The family cut firewood for themselves and in winter
dragged it by sleds over the ice-bound river.

There was something untamed about the Morris clan.  "I don't think the
Morrises even knew how many cats they had," recalls a friend, who says 20 or
more cats roamed the property while three or four big furry black dogs ruled
the hearth.

Inside the old farmhouse, unnecessary elements were eliminated.  A mantle
considered "too ornamental" was hacked out, a closet was torn out to squeeze
in yet another bookcase, and a bathroom was ripped out to create another
bedroom.  The ceiling sagged and the plaster was cracked, but the
"unbelievable mess," as a friend calls it, held an unusual collection of
quirky wartime coding devices, including the mysterious Nazi Enigma machine.

Named from the Greek word for puzzle, the Enigma was a mesh of gears and
rotors that controlled an electronic drum rimmed by the letters of the
alphabet and fed by a typewriter.  Considered a foolproof scrambler, the
battery-powered Enigma served as the Third Reich's top coder in World War II.
But in 1939, an elite British team of cryptanalysts and mathematicians
cracked the coder and gained a tremendous edge over Hitler's forces
throughout the war.  With the Enigma's secrets unlocked, the Allied
commanders could read the Fuhrer's orders often before his own generals
received them.

Almost everything at the Morris house had a story behind it, no matter how
obscure it might appear.  The house was overflowing with puzzle sculpture
pieces, magazines, and more books than you'd find in most small libraries.
And not just any books.  Morris senior had been a brilliant mathematician at
Harvard, but he also loved the classics and learned to read Greek and Latin.
His wife, Anne Morris, counted the vast family collection one day and, after
tossing out duplicates, logged 7,000 volumes.

Morris junior began reading at the age of four.  The curious toddler created
working scale models out of paper, file folders, and paper clips--cars with
wheels that turned when you moved the steering wheel and revolvers with
bullets and chambers that turned.  At nine he read stacks of Scientific
American.  His father had a ham radio license, and before long the boy began
assembling and disassembling radios and a variety of other electronic
equipment.  By the time he reached his early teens, his reading list had
expanded to include the classics, history, economics, political science, and
science fiction.

But downstairs, in the old kitchen, in front of an unused Dutch oven, was a
machine like no other.  From a distance, it looked like a huge mechanical
typewriter stretched over a desk, but what were those protruding rods and
cables?  The strange-looking device, which had been in the house since the
mid-1960s, when Morris junior was born, was a computer terminal.

As a top scientist at Bell Labs, Morris senior was one of a few employees
with a home computer terminal during an era when electric typewriters were
still rare.  "Everybody lined up behind one another to get their computer
time," recalls Anne Morris of the Digital Equipment terminal.  But her
children were not all alike.  Soon her daughter lost interest, and the
younger boy rebelled.  (He now works as a tree surgeon.)

Only Robert, the older boy, remained captivated by the clanking, screenless
terminal.  Each time he struck a key on the machine, mechanical rods shifted
like the trackers of a pipe organ, forming the eight bits that made their way
over the terminal's modem to Bell's central computer.  Frequent lubrication
was needed to keep the machine's rods from sticking, and after a long
session, Robert would often emerge with oily knees.

When Peter McIlroy visited the Morris farmhouse, he noticed his friend wasn't
merely playing the computer's math and guessing games.  "By the sixth grade,
he was finding holes [in the operating system]," recalls McIlroy.  "But he
wasn't a snoop.  It was much more of an intellectual game."

Not yet in his teens, Morris junior already knew his way around the huge,
complex Unix operating system.  He created multiuser games to chat with his
friends simultaneously and a surprisingly sophisticated Unix interface shell.
The Unix code was online, and nearly every day after school Robert studied it
the way other boys studied girls.  His girlfriend, the daughter of another
Bell employee, was online, and the budding hacker zapped love notes to her.

By his mid-teens, the young Morris showed Peter McIlroy how, by logging on to
one terminal, he could masquerade as a legitimate user on any computer in
Bell's network.  "He found it, played with it, and fixed it," says McIlroy.
"I think they [Bell officials] were impressed."  Bell officials say that
while Morris did modify some files, no serious damage was done.  "He was told
to stop and that was that," says Bell's Fred Grampp.

But Morris was allowed to visit his father's office and continue his poking,
and in December 1982, Grampp invited him to give a talk about tightening
security on a Unix communications program.  Soon Morris was working part-time
at the lab after school and full-time for the next two summers, writing his
first scientific paper, "A Security Flaw in Berkeley . . . Unix," in January
1983.

His initiation into the rites of super-hacking couldn't have been more pure.
In the elite, challenging research environment of Bell Labs, the teenager
learned "to spot and repair security holes" at the feet of the very people
who had created Unix.

But Morris was far from a one-dimensional, stereotypical hacker.  At nearby
Delbarton, a preparatory school run by Benedictine monks, he excelled in a
broad range of courses, swam the breaststroke on the school swim team, sang
with the abbey's chorus, and was, according to the Delbarton credo,
"encouraged to become an independent seeker of information and take
responsibility for gaining both knowledge and judgment."

Yet years later, his parents proudly announced that it was he who was
featured in a 1982 Smithsonian magazine article as a "quiet, polite young
man" who "has broken into password files" and read "supposedly private"
computer mail.  "I never told myself that there was nothing wrong with what I
was doing," the boy was quoted as saying, adding that he was driven by the
challenge of testing computer security.  It was a family preoccupation that
Morris shared with his fictional double, the shockwave Rider:

"I guess my daddy was a 'phone phreak' and I inherited the gene."

The following year, Morris senior wrote in his 25th anniversary Harvard
report: "I promised myself that I would learn to read Greek, learn in some
detail how the planets move in their orbits, and learn how to decipher secret
codes.  I have gone a long way toward keeping all three promises."  But it
was secret codes--not Greek or the heavens--that captivated his teenage son,
and he was soon fast at work on his first paid computer security project at
Bell.

The security crusade didn't end at the laboratory.  At the farmhouse, father
and son often discussed Unix and computer security.  "I'm very sure he got
hints from his father," says Douglas McUlroy, "but I doubt he got much
detailed help.  I think his father wanted to generate self-reliance."  The
young Morris told a friend that his father created games to develop his
programming skills, once even making him program without GOTO
commands--something like playing basketball with only your left hand.  "His
father was always challenging him," recalls Roy Horton, Morris junior's music
teacher and a close family friend.  "They were of similar minds."

The next year Morris senior and Grampp wrote and, with some trepidation,
published the definitive paper on Unix security.  In the footnotes was a
reference to Morris junior's paper, and in the introduction, a warning:
"There is a fine line between helping administrators protect their systems
and providing a cookbook for bad guys."

Morris junior seemed to understand the dangers.  In his second published
scientific paper, he sounded every bit the seasoned computer security expert.
"The old uucp [Unix to Unix copy procedure] was designed on small machines
with light traffic and little concern for security," wrote the confident
18-year-old.  "Times have changed.  With many hundreds of machines running
uucp, one cannot assume that no uucp requests will be malicious."

"AREN'T YOU THIS FAMOUS, GREAT HACKER?" asked an impressionable fellow
Harvard student.  "No," said Morris, his boyish face betraying embarrassment
and a slight smile.  "That's my roommate."

Morris continued the playful deception for several minutes.  The Shockwave
Rider, too, had many identities, many lives woven through the electronic net:

"An individual could rewrite him or herself via any terminal connected to the
federal data banks . . . this was the most precious of all freedoms . . .
freedom to become the person you chose to be instead of the person remembered
by the computers . . . it was the enchanted sword, the invulnerable shield,
the winged boots, the cloak of invisibility.  It was the ultimate defense."

Morris had several identities at Harvard.  The story goes that as a freshman
he walked in, brought down the system, and hacked his first identity, an
unauthorized Harvard account.  Whether that initial act of mastery be myth or
fact, in a matter of months Morris had hacked and cultivated a fistful of
computer credit accounts.  His log-on name became his identity, both online
and among his friends: RTM.

As a freshman, RTM began hanging around Harvard's graduate computer science
department, Aiken Lab, an ugly slab of concrete built in the 1940s and named
after one of the inventors of the modern computer.  It was here, behind a
glass wall, opposite the antiquated vacuum-tube computer, that RTM spent most
of his waking hours.

"He'd fix things for free," recalls Paul Graham, a computer science graduate
student and close friend.  "There was no question that he was the most
technical person."

RTM's breadth of knowledge was exceptional: Unix, networking, hardware,
graphics, and several other languages.  Andrew Sudduth, Aiken's system
manager, hired RTM, and like many who employed him on campus, Sudduth found
that RTM was too busy chasing the latest computer problem to punch a time
clock or do his class work.  "A professor would say, 'Wouldn't it be nice if
we had this?'" he recalls.  "And Robert would go and do it."

He began by pacing the halls.  There was no evidence he was working on the
problem.  After sufficient gestation, he settled in at a terminal, preferably
"a lousy one," with a black and white display, a throwback, says Graham, to
his days on his father's mechanical, screenless terminal.  There were no
distractions, no interruptions, and once he began, the pace was fierce, for
TRM could program as fast as he could type.

Rail-thin, RTM ate little, and when classmates invited him to lunch, two
hours later he would still be hunched over his keyboard, typing furiously.
Friends would stand over him, calling out his name, but the transfixed
programmer seemed to hear nothing.  When a few nights of intense programming
finally gelled, RTM would snap out of his spell.  "He would jump up and rub
his hands when he figured something out," says Sudduth.

Not all of his achievements were altruistic.  RTM could do "anything he
wanted" when friends were logged on to a Sun workstation, according to Graham
and others.  One of his most playful pranks was creating a subliminal message
that would flash for less than half a second on the screen of an unsuspecting
user.  Graham said he saw the fleeting message, "Help, I'm being held
prisoner within a VAX 750!" and then wondered if he'd imagined it all.

Occasionally RTM took the game further, demanding a response to his whimsical
intrusions.  Classmates sometimes found their work interrupted by a sage
called The ORacle.  "Ask me a question and I will answer you," asked RTM, The
Oracle.  "But first you must answer me."

Some of his pranks tested a user's technical knowledge.  On a lark, RM
reverse-engineered the Harvard network into an older, defunct interface.
Everything worked, but the commands were different, and "true" hackers seemed
to enjoy the challenge.  Roommate Greg Kuperberg, a nationally ranked college
mathemaician (also prone to feverish pacing) who befriended RTM and
collaborated with him on an elaborate graphics program, says his friend's
forays into Harvard's computers were exagerrated and misunderstood.  RTM was
simply inquisitive, says Kuperberg, and his experiments were not much
different from those of a young chemist who occasionally mixed the wrong
chemicals.

But RTM's experiments were not without side effects, and there were some who
didn't consider it good, clean fun.  One night, Robert Ziff, a Harvard
engineering student, watched the program he was working on slow to a snail's
pace.  He complained to the deparmtent's system manager, who checked to see
who was tying up the computer's resources and exclaimed, "Oh God!  It's
Robert Morris."

RTM had programs simultaneously running off his accounts on the engineering
and robotics computers--in addition to Aiken's.  It wasn't the first time he
had "hogged" computer time.  Ziff was instructed to warn RTM that "if it
happens again, they'll take you off the account."

Ziff was by no means the only one at Harvard who was unhappy with RTM and his
experiments.  A few were "mistrustful of Robert because he was smarter and
better," says a friend.  To those individuals, RTM sometimes sent commands
that mysteriously crept onto their computer screens.  There was never any
doubt who had sent the ominous commands.  Only RTM knew the secret security
holes.  And there was never any doubt that he would keep his dark knowledge
secret.  "He wouldn't tell them how he did it," says the friend.  "He didn't
trust them."  Instead, RTM left his enemies hanging, wondering whether he
might just decide to execute the REMOVE FILE commands he dangled on their
screens.  "I did in fact break into other people's computers [at Harvard],"
Morris later admitted in court, "but I ... knew that they wouldn't mind."

In one sense, RTM was no different from other hackers.  The first commandment
of hacking is to not waste computer time, to push and pull every electron's
worth of processing might.  It is a boy's pursuit, a masculine display of
virtuosity.  Test pilots call it "pushing the envelope."  No longer protected
by his father or the understanding researchers at Bell Labs, RTM began
testing his wings, and, like the Shockwave Rider, he thrived in his new
environment:

"Meantime, taking advantage of the corporation's status, he could gain access
to data nets that were ordinarily secure.  That was the whole point of coming
to KC.  He wanted--more, he needed--data..."

RTM never did carry out the ominous threats, and at the same time he was
building professional credentials as a dedicated computer security expert.

"The Unix software is very flexible and convenient, but it places too much
trust in a protocol that provides very little security," he warned in a 1985
Bell Labs paper that described how to attack "trusting" host on the vast
national computer network known as Internet.

Two years later, while still at Harvard, RTM delivered several long talks on
his extensive knowledge of computer security at the National Computer Science
Security Center and the Naval Research Lab.  During his summers he hacked for
computer companies on both coasts.

As he became more technically accomplished, his two personas--the mischievous
RTM and the dedicated computer security expert, Robert Morris, Jr.--struck an
uneasy balance.  The same friends who detail how RTM inspired fear in his
enemies remember him as a person who believed in the importance of
"character" and who hacked out favors at a moment's notice.

But in his professional role, Morris increasingly found that the real world
was not nearly as responsive to security concerns as the Bell Laboratories of
his childhood.  he discovered that if he reported a security bug, companies
often did nothing, or they waited for months before issuing patches.  He
worried that unscrupulous hackers would take advantage of his discoveries.
He began to keep the secret openings to himself.

When RTM was taking graduate mathematics and computer science courses in
1985, the combination of his freelance projects, his generosity, and the
"difficulty and the boredom" of graduate work became too much for him.  RTM
did not excel in every course, as his father had.  So he dropped out and went
to work at the Convex Computer Corporation, in Richardson, Texas.

The young hacker's education began to have more in common with that of the
Shockwave Rider:

"Shortly thereafter, he began to concentrate on data processing techniques at
the expense of his other study subjects."

The following year, Morris junior returned to his Harvard studies eager to
learn.  Friends remember his pacing about their homes or apartments, picking
up things to see how they worked.  Often his excitement bubbled over.  "He
was always breaking things," says Graham.  "And he was insatiably curious."

The love of the classics his father had inspired had not diminished.  "He
might be interested in medieval art, English history (a poster of English
kings adorned his dorm room), Homer, the Renaissance, or Greek art," recalls
a Harvard classics professor RTM helped with some computing problems.  "His
knowledge was pretty encyclopedic."  But the serious topics didn't keep the
Harvard student from classic adventure stories like the Norse sagas and one
of his favorites, The Three Musketeers.

Something of an adventurer himself, RTM and a classmate spent a week buying
copies of The Racing Form at six in the morning and entering "tons of data
about correlations of past performances."  Then the budding computer bookies
took in their first horse race at nearby Suffolk Downs.  "It was so
depressing," says RTM's friend about the crowd of retired, alcoholic
pensioners.  Deciding it "criminal" to beat such sorry bettors, the two
abandoned their get-rich-quick scheme.

Computer graphics became a new infatuation.  With Kuperberg, RTM created an
advanced ray-tracing graphics program.  When he found that higher mathematics
were not enough to create beautiful forms, he turned to the ancients,
studying the works of Vitruvius, the inventor of proportion standards for
classical columns.  One of RTM's finest creations was of a temple standing in
the middle of a blue sea.

Excited by their success, the talented duo entertained the idea of launching
a computer graphics firm.  "We had this picture of a kid running a lemonade
stand who one day turned into Donald Trump," says Kuperberg, who, like his
friend, had a "default plan" of graduate school.

BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH.  It was the way RTM entertained an idea, as
if by the movement of his light steps he might nudge the completed thought
from his brain.  But this time he seemed more driven than usual.

He had come the nearly 300 miles from his graduate computer science studies
at Cornell to pore over the Unix source code at Harvard's Aiken Lab and visit
his friend, Paul Graham.  "He had discovered a big hole and he had to tell
someone," recalls Graham.  Excitedly, RTM paced the small office, telling
Graham how he had isolated holes in Unix that could enable him to be a super
user--not at Cornell or Harvard, but across the country and around the world.
Both of the bugs were communications holes, but RTM explained how the FTP
(File Transfer Protocol) bug could conceivably grant an invader root
privileges--the ability to read or delete anything on a compromised machine.

"It was an experiment," Morris later testified.  "I had never heard of
anything like it before ... to see if I could write a program that would
spread as widely as possible in Internet."  His friend was similarly
entranced.  "I thought it was the greatest idea," says Graham, "All over the
world.  A big living organism.  No one had ever done it before."  Of course,
it had been done before by the Shockwave Rider:

"This is indeed the father and mother of a tapeworm.  You'll have noticed how
much use it makes of terminology derived from the study of living animals.
And with reason.  Not for nothing is a tapeworm called a tapeworm.  It can be
made to breed ... my newest--my masterpiece--breeds by itself."

To Graham, the worm was not only an incredible creation, it was a bold strike
for freedom, and later in court he would compare RTM to Mathias Rust, the
West German pilot who landed in Moscow's Red Square in May 1987.  Encouraged
by his starry-eyed friend, RTM paced, describing how he wanted every computer
on the Internet to receive one innocuous probe, one worm that would wriggle
its way into each computer's memory.

Finally, the excitement grew too great for Morris.

"RTM, you're on his desk," said Graham, as he watched RTM's feet pad by on
top of their colleague's desk.

"Oh," said RTM, for the first time aware of his rise in elevation.  This
behavior was typical of Morris when he was absorbed in thought.

Later, on that cool October night in 1988, RTM and Graham continued talking
about the probe as they stood in front of a Boston seafood restaurant waiting
for Sudduth, a champion rower, whom they would toast as a winner of the
annual Head of the Charles regatta.  As they waited, Graham suggested that
the worm write something to the computers it wriggled its way into.

"No, no, we can't do writes," his friend said, explaining that any writes, no
matter how well-intended, might be dangerous.

What the two couldn't figure out was how to protect a single worm on each
machine.  "It would have been very simple for someone to write a program that
just acted as if it was a worm [an antiworm]," tricking new worms into
believing a computer had already been penetrated and stopping "my worm from
growing at all," Morris testified.  And so, he decided it might be all right
to have two, or maybe three, worms per machine.

But neither knew much about population growth, and if RTM had any technical
shortcoming, it was his ambivalence toward higher mathematics.  There on the
sidewalk, the two decided that the second worm to invade a machine should
have a one-in-seven rate of survival.

No particular formula was used, Morris later told a jury.  "It was based on
the intuition I had on how rapidly it would spread."  He figured a new worm
might appear once every few hours.  As the Shockwave Rider explained,
everything was under control:

"And, no, it can't be killed.  It's indefinitely self-perpetuating so long as
the net exists ... incidentally, though, it won't expand to indefinite size
and clog the net for other use.  It has built-in limits."

When Sudduth arrived at the restaurant, the two collaborators abruptly
changed the subject.  "When we were on a project," says Graham, "it was
understood that it was secret."  But RTM couldn't keep everything under his
hat.  Without hinting that he planned an attack, he excitedly told Sudduth
about the bugs he had uncovered.

And at first, in the ensuing days, it seemed that RTM's wild idea might go
the way of his racetrack betting and computer graphics schemes.  For several
days after RTM had returned to Cornell, Graham heard nothing from his friend.

The two had an old practice of sending elliptical messages over Internet--for
security's sake.  "Any news on the brilliant project?"  Graham asked in his
electronic message.

There was no response.

RTM HAD BEEN BUSY.  More than a week before his visit to Harvard, he had
created a wish list for his worm on his university computer.  It was
strangely appropriate that he began the work at Cornell.  Officials would
later say it was his reputation as a hacker that gained him admittance to the
university's prestigious graduate school in computer science.

RTM's list was divided into the two main goals he had for his worm: attack
and defense.  The target was Internet, an umbrella of three national
communication networks, including ARPAnet, run by the Department of Defense
to link research computers at military sites and universities; MILnet, used
by military and civilian researchers to send routine, unclassified
communications; and NSFnet, a National Science Foundation network.

In the beginning, RTM and Graham used the popular term virus to describe the
worm, but as the creation took shape it came to resemble the prehistoric
worm.  Viruses exist by invading and altering their host cells, and their
computer counterparts are similar.  They cannot "live" or run without
attaching themselves to other programs.  But a computer worm is independent.
Self-propagating and self-running, worms can exist without directly
endangering a network or its users.  Some early computer worms were actually
loosed to perform network management tasks.  The Shockwave Rider's worm had a
higher social and moral goal:

"The primary my worm is designed to invade is that privacy under whose cover
justice is not done and injustice is not seen."

RTM designed his worm to clone itself, spreading throughout the net.
Searching out new nesting locations, the worm scanned address lists of
computers, selecting the most directly linked machines, such as gateways, and
then began cycling through its attacks.  If one method failed, the tireless
invader quickly picked another from its arsenal.  The attacks fell into three
categories: nooking a foothold through a security hole, taking advantage of
"trusting" computers, and cracking passwords.  RTM playfully named his worm's
attack engine the "cracksome" routine.

Footholds could be gained through either of two techniques.  One involved a
utility designed to elicit such information as a user's full name, office,
and phone number.  It was fittingly named Fingered.  The worm overflowed the
program's small buffer and tricked unsuspecting machines into downloading,
compiling, and running a tiny source code "grappling hook"--the worm's scout.

Once ensconced within the target computer, the hook called the original worm
and "pulled" back sections of a new version of the original worm compiled to
run on either a VAX or a Sun workstation, the two most common computers on
the network (if the hook guessed wrong, it pulled over the other version).
Finally, the hook linked the sections together and the new worm began
running.

By compiling his worm for the two machines in advance, RTM avoided the risk
of sending an easily decipherable source code copy of the program.  Only the
tiny "grappling hook" was written in source code, to ensure that the first
cast would draw a bite.  The drawback, of course, was that the worm could
successfully invade only VAX or Sun workstations.

A similar attack was launched on an electronic mail program called Sendmail.
RTM had discovered that the program's seldom-used debugging utility allowed
users to send a set of commands instead of a user's address.  Through the
gaping security hole went the worm's grappling hook, and, as in the Fingerd
attack, in less than a minute a new, fully functioning copy of the worm was
running on the target machine.

The worm made another attack, not so much on a security hole but on the
network's community of trust.  Once a machine was invaded, the worm attempted
to connect with remote machines that "trusted" the invaded machine and didn't
require a password.  The techniques were similar to what RTM had described as
a teenager in a Bell Labs paper he wrote about a "weakness" in security that
allows "users on untrusted and possibly very distant hosts to masquerade as
users on trusted hosts."

These were the cracked windows, loose hinges, and open doors upon which the
worm directed its principal attacks.  But the worm also tried to find keys
lying around, checking to see if an account had no password, and then
attempting simple heuristics using a combination of words from a user's
account, including names, nicknames, and names spelled backward.

If these attacks failed, the worm would try its internal dictionary of 432
passwords.  But the task of cracking new passwords was a time-consuming
process.  The only passwords publicly available were encrypted.  To figure
out the true password behind its encrypted double, the worm had to encrypt
its own internal list of probable passwords against those it attempted to
crack.

If two encrypted passwords matched, the worm knew that its original password
(before the worm encrypted it) was identical to the password it was trying to
crack.  Since virtually every target password was encrypted under a different
key, each target password forced the worm to re-encrypt its list of possible
passwords.  After trying this strategy for a few seconds, the worm tried
words from Unix's online dictionary, using the same tedious encryption
method.  Cycling through its arsenal of attacks, the worm continually
camouflaged and transformed itself.  Immediately upon arriving in a new
computer, the worm deleted the disk copy of itself and ran only in memory
under the alias of an innocuous command interpreter, the kind often used in
shell scripts or automatic commands.

Every three minutes, the worm forked, splitting into a dead parent and a
child.  The child started off "fresh," using to apparent resources such as
processing time or memory usage.  The short dashes made the worm more
difficult to seize, even if it happened to be spotted.

THE WORM LEFT FEW CLUES.  It read all its support files into memory, deleting
file system copies that might be noticed.  And by turning off the generation
of core files, if the worm made a mistake and accidentally died, it left no
corpse behind.  Once every 15 infections, the worm attempted to connect to a
Berkeley computer.  RTM had hoped the "red herring," as he called it, might
by itself shift suspicion onto the computer center, but it never actually
made the connection.

Finally, if the worm, or parts of it, were somehow captured, the binary (near
machine-level) program would require many hours of complex decompilation
before its nuts and bolts could be understood.

For nearly three weeks RTM worked sporadically on the worm, increasing the
number and complexity of its potential assaults.  Its diverse collection of
attack strategies gave it a character more like that of a bulky battleship
than a sleek submarine, and one friend and security expert later called it
"everything but the kitchen sink."

RTM collected password files form computers at Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley,
and other universities around the country; he found the fast encryption
routine he needed in a program written at Bell Labs; he incorporated
password-breaking techniques his father had discussed in his classic paper on
Unix security.  RTM didn't want to omit anything, and he feverishly threw a
decade of security training into the worm.  There was little time to check
for errors; besides, the Shockwave Rider didn't make mistakes:

"'How the hell were you able to build a tapeworm this complicated"'  It's a
talent, like a musician's or a poet's.  I can play a computer read-in
literally for hours at a time and never hit a wrong note."

Everything seemed to be going exactly as planned.  On Wednesday, November 2,
1988, RTM logged on to his terminal at Cornell's Upson Hall at a little after
10 a.m. and worked until lunch.  In the afternoon, the trouble began.

RTM noticed a posting from Keith Bostic, of Berkeley: a patch to the FTP bug
he had discovered on his fateful visit to Harvard.  RTM quickly typed out an
electronic mail message to Sudduth, asking whether he had been the source of
the leak.

"I didn't think it was a good idea to spread information about random
security holes," Morris later testified.

Sudduth sensed panic in his friend.  "Maybe he worried that the [other] bugs
would be patched before he sent his worm."

At 8 p.m. EST, sitting at his Upson Hall terminal, RTM copied the worm to an
account at MIT known to be frequented by hackers.  "I wanted to start it out
so it wouldn't be obvious that I had started the worm myself," Morris
testified.  (The final version of the worm did not include attacks on the now
patched FTP bug.)  For the next 20 minutes, RTM tried to track the worm's
path, but as far as he could tell, "it wasn't working right.  It seemed to
have been getting bogged down, not really doing very much."

And so, having begun his experiment, RTM left his terminal and walked home.

ON INTERNET, THE WORM WAS AWAKENING.  One hour and 24 minutes after its
release, the worm squirmed its way across the country and into the computers
of a Santa Monica defense contractor, the Rand Corporation.

In two hours it hit the major gateway at the University of California,
Berkeley; the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, in Berkeley and Livermore; and
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New Mexico.  Very quickly it became
apparent that something had gone terribly wrong.  Individual machines became
infected by not one or two but several worms.  Then, the infection erupted.

Since university and military computers are rarely used so late at night,
they generally register only a 1 or 2 load average of a possible 100.  But by
9:21 p.m. PST, computers at the University of Utah had already documented a
load of 5.  Twenty minutes later, the load reached 7; in another 20 minutes,
16; and incredibly, in just another five minutes, the system topped out at
100, choking to a standstill.

Of course, as his lawyer later argued, RTM had been careful to ensure that
his worm not read, delete, or in any way damage targeted computers.  But he
hadn't counted on a more insidious risk.  Simply by reproducing, the worm was
sucking the oxygen out of Internet the way algae strangle a dying sea.

RTM's birth control wasn't working quite the way he had planned.  Only the
first virus on a machine listened for others.  Subsequent worms didn't hear
each other and didn't submit to the killer dice roll.  And those few worms
that lost the roll were allowed to continue their efforts to propagate new
copies of themselves on other machines, even after they'd received death
sentences.

Emergency teams at Berkeley, MIT, and other computer centers worked
frantically to stop the invader.  Though the worm didn't appear to be
directly damaging files, the rescue workers desperately searched for hidden
trap doors, Trojan horses, or time bombs.  By midnight EST, NASA's Ames
Research Center, in Silicon Valley, had shut off all communications with
outside researchers, stranding 52,000 computer users.  Minutes earlier, one
of the Berkeley scientists on the front line had sent out an electronic
S.O.S. over the net: "We are under attack from an Internet virus..."

"No.  We can't stop it!  There's never been a worm with that tough a head or
that long a tail.  It's building itself, don't you understand?  Already it's
passed a billion bits and it's still growing ... and now it's so goddamn
comprehensive that it can't be killed.  Not short of demolishing the net!"

While computer experts across the country raced to salvage what they could of
the worm's wreckage, RTM sat dazed.  When he telephoned Sudduth, his voice
was deathly quiet.  Sudduth passed the receiver to Graham, who listened to
the barely audible voice and wondered whether Morris had broken up with his
girlfriend.

"I really F_____ed up," said Morris as he quietly described how his worm was
reproducing like a virulent cancer, jamming Internet with resource-sapping
copies of itself.  Graham was stunned.  He had thought the project was far
off in the future.

"RTM, you idiot!" he yelled, angry at his friend for "blowing" such a great
idea.  Then he asked, "How did this happen?"

"Well, you remember the number I picked?"

The two worked on possible cures.  It was nearly midnight, and the worm had
been racing through Internet for four hours.  Graham suggested that they
create a Pac-Man cannibal worm to gobble up the worms.  "I didn't do that,
because I had messed up with the first one," Morris later testified.

The two couldn't agree on a strategy, and the conversation ended.  Graham
went to Sudduth's office practically bursting with his secret.  "Something
really big is up.  I can't tell you."

"F_____k you, Paul!" shot back the Olympic rower.

"Well ... Robert wrote this virus," Graham said, "and it's taking over every
computer in the country!"

Sudduth punched out an e-mail message.  Though surprised that Morris wasn't
doing more to stop the worm, he guessed his friend was finding it hard to
admit that "something he created was out of control!"  Morris phoned back and
told Sudduth how to stop the worm from spreading on Harvard's computers.

Later, at about 1:30 a.m., Morris called Sudduth from his home phone.  The
two decided that Sudduth should publish the worm antidotes on
Internet--anonymously.

"I was scared," Morris later testified.  "I knew people would be annoyed
about this because it was causing problems, and I wasn't particularly eager
to catch the blame for this at that time."

Why didn't Morris send the warning?

"Well, I was at home," testified the driven programmer, who had been known to
work till dawn.  "I don't have computer access at home.  I suppose I could
have walked back to Cornell at 2 in the morning ... but even then I wasn't
sure I could get access to the network."  Critics later questioned why Morris
didn't simply telephone computer experts at Berkeley or MIT, but somehow,
after having grown up online, in the electronic net, that direct,
non-computer solution seemed to have escaped him.

Friends have a simpler explanation.  Morris, quite unlike his hero, the
Shockwave Rider, was simply "frightened out of his wits."

"'Precipice is going to be attacked with nukes at 0130!'  [The Shockwave
Rider] launched into a burst of furious activity, punching his board with
fingers that flew faster than a pianist's. '... Run like hell--because this
may not work'"

SUDDUTH WORKED TO GET THE WORD OUT.  By now, the system was clogged.  the
only connection he could find was to a bulletin board at Brown University,
hardly a center for Unix or Internet.  The tired system manager typed out the
antidote, describing how to close the holes and protect against new attacks,
ending with the odd phrase, "I hope this helps, but even more, I hope it's a
hoax."

At about 4 a.m., Sudduth finally dragged himself to bed.  Computer centers
around the nation were in the process of shutting down the relay centers that
might pass the worm--and its antidote.  His friend had already been fast
asleep for two hours.

The next morning, Morris worked on some school-work he had neglected and
"just generally tried to relax."  In the evening he went to choir practice.

Almost 24 hours had passed since he'd released the worm.  When he returned to
Upson Hall, he logged on to read his mail.  The system seemed to be working
fine.  Morris read several Cornell notices about a "loose virus" that seemed
under control, although users were warned to "be careful"; some notices from
Keith Bostic about patching security holes that the worm had used; and a
message from Paul Graham asking him to call.  There was something else Morris
did at Upson Hall on November 3:

"Yes, I believe I cleaned up some of my files."

"By 'cleaned up,' you mean you deleted some of the files?" probed the
prosecution.

"I deleted some of my files, yes."

"And that copy of the virus you left on your account, that was encrypted,
that was in an encrypted form, wasn't it?

"It was.  Yes."

Once again, Morris left Upson Hall and returned home to make a phone call.
Graham excitedly informed him that the worm and disclosure of its staggering
impact "was about to get into newspapers, and that it might be a big sort of
media event."

Morris "screwed up" his courage and called his father, the computer security
expert, because he "felt that he ought to know."  Morris senior was not
amused.  He told his son to go home and not to talk to anybody.  "So then I
went to bed and I left Cornell the next day," Morris testified.

But the true Shockwave Rider never abandoned the front line.  With a nuclear
bomber zeroing in, he bravely hacked out the commands to avert the attack:

"And you did it in less than ten minutes?"

"Looking back on it, I feel I had all the time in the world."

MEANWHILE, MORRIS WAS RETREATING, though not as smoothly as planned.  One of
his friends had inadvertently let RTM's log-on and nickname slip to John
Markoff, a reporter from The New York Times who happened to have written
extensively on computer security and who counted among his friends one of the
nation's leading computer security experts, Robert Morris, Sr.

The reporter used an Internet account to "Fingerd" RTM, and the program
faithfully flashed the name Robert T. Morris.  When the reporter called
Morris senior and noted the similarity of their names, the elaborate
"experiment" unraveled.  Morris junior's secret trail of anonymous accounts,
red herrings, and encrypted files suddenly became the machinations of an
adolescent playing war games.

Officials at MIT estimated that 6,000 of the nation's 60,000 Internet
computers had been invaded.  The country's top computer experts spent several
sleepless days and nights battling and cleaning up after the attack, while
tens of thousands of military and university researchers went without
computer power.  (Blocked at the relay point, Sudduth's antidote had not been
delivered for two days.)  The tab for the wasted time and resources was
estimated at $15 million.

Three days after the attack, The New York Times began a series of front-page
stories about the missing Internet attacker, Robert Tappan Morris.  While
Morris maintained a public silence ordered first by his father and then by
his Washington, D.C., attorney, the FBI began an investigation, and
government and university officials harshly criticized the hacker.

Old Bell Labs colleagues like Douglas McIlroy were puzzled by their progeny's
slip.  "What I don't understand is the secrecy part of it.  All of the
juvenile tricks, encrypting source files to launch from some other machine,
encrypting the program," says the scientist.  "That's not consonant with a
fun-loving kid."

Yet many computer security experts--some of them friends and former
associates of Morris senior--rose to Morris junior's defense.  They said his
experiment was a harmless, overdue warning of gross gaps in computer
security, and argued that Morris should be cheered, not convicted.

"When all is said and done, this kid is going to come down as a folk hero,"
Peter Neuman, a computer security expert at SRI international (one of Morris
junior's former employers) told The New York Times.

Of course, the hacker is the hero--in fiction.  The Shockwave Rider liberates
the masses from a corrupt, computer-controlled government with a
freedom-fighting worm, risks his life to foil a nuclear attack, wins his
girl's heart, and is praised by the world.  But Morris had no such righteous
intentions.  He had no social or moral agenda, and never intended to expose
Internet's well-known security limitations.  His worm had no other purpose
than to spread as far and wide as possible, and if it had spread as planned,
slowly, innocuously, most say the response would have been even greater
panic.

The world that Morris's worm entered was far removed from his boyhood
computer security training in the hallowed research halls of Bell Labs.  In
the decade since his code-cracking childhood, computers leapt into the
mainstream to become the foundation of business and commerce.  Assaults on
computers became assaults on industry, and by the mid-1980s terrorist
computer attacks and malicious break-ins revealed the dark side of hacking,
forever ending the playful era of his father, when hacking was a rite of
passage.

Therein lay the irony and tragedy of the trial of Robert Morris.  He was
being tried for what he was taught by his father, his institutions, and his
generation: access, unauthorized.  The trouble was, as the would-be security
expert wrote in one of his early papers, "Times have changed."

Some were not prepared for the change.  On the day before the verdict, a
Harvard professor warned that "if Robert had wanted to do damage, there would
have been nothing left!  All the computers would have gone up in smoke!"
Another Harvard friend suggested that if Morris were "unjustly punished," it
might inspire a less restrained, less idealistic hacker to "do it right."
The reasoning was similar to Morris's main line of defense.

"Was it your intention to have the worm program destroy or damage any files?"
asked the defense attorney.

"No, it was not."

"Was it possible for you to do that?"

"It would have been easy to do that."

The implication was ominous, and at least one close friend of Morris's was
not convinced that everything was OK just because his bored buddy hadn't
pulled the trigger.  "On some level I know why he did this, and on some level
I don't," says Kuperberg, glancing away and pacing like the old roommate he
struggle to defend.  "On some level [Morris senior's explanation of boredom]
is not satisfactory."

No answer seemed likely to come from the one person who might know.  After
the guilty verdict was issued in his trial, Morris and his attorney walked
past the jostling TV crews and newspaper reporters and into the winter night.

His father held back.  The press surrounded him and the TV lights shone
eerily on his face.  "What do you feel, Mr. Morris?  What do you feel?"

He chose his words carefully, stiffly stating that the trial had been fair,
though he was not happy with the verdict.  The question came again, and this
time he spoke with conviction:  "It's perfectly obvious that there is not a
fraudulent or dishonest bone in his body."

IN THE WORM'S WAKE, there has been no great improvement in security, but
fresh concern that future computer communication tools used by the average
citizen may have to be weighed down by cumbersome locks and chains.  For, as
Morris senior wrote in his treatise on Unix security, "It is easy to run a
secure computer system.  You merely have to disconnect all dial-up
connections and permit only direct-wired terminals, put the machine and its
terminals in a shielded room, and post a guard at the door."

Such is the bleak reality of total computer security, and if history is any
lesson, computers, too, will move through cycles, bringing periods of cold
war as well as openness.  In the end, security is trust, which must be
nurtured and cultivated like any other human quality.  Morris wanted to be a
hero, yet he lacked the patience and vision to forge a new direction.

"What would have been great is if he had shut the holes after himself.  That
would have been a coup," says Peter McIlroy.  "If he had thought of that, I
think he would have done it."

But RTM wanted nothing of the sort.  In the private war he waged it was his
duty to hold on to the holes, to wield them in the way he "knew they wouldn't
mind."

And Robert Tappan Morris?  He was just a kid.

"He might have been trained to display such powers of judgment; he might have
been specially bred to possess them.  One thing was sure: he hadn't lived
long enough to grow into them."

                              WORDLESS
          By Homer Mandrill

          The new era is rapidly upon us, folks, just like it
     always has been since the beginning of time. With every
     passing moment, with every exhalation, with every beat of our
     hearts the potential for this new era is conceived,
     disregarded, and thrown away.
          The new era of which I write will not be heralded by a
     great battle. Neither will it be heralded by rapture,
     discernment, the rise of the Anti-Christ, bill HR 4079 (which
     EVERYONE needs to learn about REAL quick), or the arrival of
     aliens from Planet X.
          It will be ushered in by some random but seemingly
     'composed' event. Neither I nor anyone else know what it will
     be, and there in lies its power. It will not have been
     manufactured by any ego, collective or individual. Neither
     will it be 'perceived' as a prophecy, 'as it is written'.
          In this way, it will catch us unawares; we will stand as
     a world, jaws lowered, gasping, trying to conceive of words
     that apply to the situation.
          Each individual on the planet will be caught in that
     breathless Moment of confusion; a tugging on the compassion
     of every human alive, simultaneously. A hole in our
     collective chest cavity where once beat our hearts, we will
     all, simultaneously be forced to come to terms with something
     none of us had counted on. We will all be out of our depth.

          This Gasp will be felt by everyone, everywhere. This
     event will transcend religion, politics, race; no one will be
     immune to its effects/affects. It will be universal. And
     words won't do it justice.

          A billion trillion dollars/yen/deutchmarks/pounds/gold/
     frankenscence/myrhh, the cold right hand of fundamentalism
     made into a fist, the hopes and prayers of trillions of
     people of all races, the actions of every amassed army,
     ever, the commercial exploitation of every nation ever to
     have existed and which will ever exist, the shaping and
     moulding of justice and liberty, the simultaneous reduction
     and expansion of freedom around the planet; these things are
     not the ends to which civilization aspires, but rather the
     tools of our collective psyche, simultaneously raising our
     standard of living and raining on our parade.
          All these things are representative of our greatest
     accomplishments and our greatest folly, and they are the raw
     materials of the Moment of the Gasp. Just as the artist forms
     the clay into something of sublime beauty, so that Moment
     will form our perceptions of ourselves into something we are
     not ready to understand. We will stand in the gallery and
     look at the work of art that is the culmination of all
     humanity throughout the ages encapsulated in that Moment, and
     we will find ourselves unable to judge that which is before
     us.
          The Moment of the Gasp has no analog, no metaphor, no
     preconception, no 'safe zone'. The white man will not be able
     to blame the black man. The black man will not be able to
     blame the white man. The Christians will not be able to blame
     the Jews, the Atheists will not be able to blame the
     Believers, the Right will not be able to blame the Left, I
     will not be able to blame you and you will not be able to
     blame me. The very concept of blame will become obsolete, our
     internal systems of judgement, already built of flimsy
     material, will be dashed to bits on the hard edge of the
     Moment.
          The cynic will be unable to discount the facts before
     him. The idealist will see the cold face of reality. The
     ascetic will be filled with compassion for those around him.
     Every step we will take to run away from the truth will be
     met with more evidence, every word we say will crawl out of
     our mouth like a salted slug.

          "Q: When will this Moment come? Is it upon us?"
           My answer can only be that no one knows. As I mentioned
     earlier, it can not be anticipated. And to do so would ruin
     its effect/affect. Being practical for a moment, it seems to
     be rapidly approaching. But again, we cannot anticipate the
     Moment. It will fall down like a bird dropping from a bright
     blue cloudless birdless sky. Who's to say?

          "Q: What will come after the Moment of the Gasp?"
          This is the crucial question, because the answer lies
     within the it.  Since we can't determine what the event will
     be, we can't predict what will come afterward.
          "A: It all depends."
          This is the frightening realization that has been at the
     back of our collective minds for thousands of years. We
     really DON'T know what the future holds, and whatever it is,
     we in fact are totally unprepared for it. So we listen to
     Nostradamus, we re-read Revelations, we consult the Tarot and
     I Ching... to what end? We wish to control the future...
          When these temporal Holders-Of-The-Power wax poetic of
     the New World Order, they are not speaking of what is to come
     after the Moment of the Gasp. They are just covering their
     tracks. This war in Iraq made some among us humans gasp, but
     it was not THE Gasp. I certainly felt cheated by the system
     I'd been brought up to 'love and obey, or else'. But once
     more, The Gasp will be total, universal, and undeniable. Even
     George Bush will feel it.
          When that Moment comes and we have floundered and
     wallowed and died to our sanity, hopefully we will pick
     ourselves up and learn the lesson of that Moment. Q:What is the
     lesson? A: What kind of bird dropped that turd on us from the
     cloudless birdless sky?

          When we find ourselves in the Moment, and all we can do
     is Gasp, the time for change is at hand. Hope springs
     eternal, but then again, the circumstances of the Moment may
     kill us one and all.

          Who's to say?

THE STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY -- HOW MUCH WE (DON'T) KNOW

November 11, 1990
Re-Release April 3, 1991

By The Desert Fox
Transcribed and Edited by Lord Macduff


        I have been a member of the modem community for about seven years.
During that time period, I have watched literally hundreds of bulletin boards
go up and go down. A great majority of these systems were based on a public
message and file exchange. But a few of these systems were dedicated to the
exchange and distribution of information... Information that was not usually
available on a regular basis. In my day, I have seen files on VAX/VMS, phone
switching systems, hacking, phreaking, and anything else that one could dream
of. But one thing that constantly has me pondering at all hours of the night
is the state of our national defense.
        How close and how often do we come to pressing the button? Defined as
DEFCON-1, the state of panic which is actually sub-defined as World War III,
is something that has not been reached... yet.
        There are five levels of International Status. DEFCON-5 is what we'd
all like to be at... unless you're a real nut case and have absolutely no hope
for the future of mankind. DEFCON(s) 4-1 are lesser states of "panic". A dumb
reference, yet a valid one, is the movie "Wargames". Although a liberal dose
of fiction was mixed in as far as the actual methods of hacking and such, it
makes one think "Just how often DO hackers break into systems like that and
cause problems possibly leading to the destruction of the world?" [Editor's
Note -- Not as often as certain federal agencies would like to think. Go
catch some REAL criminals instead of picking on us modem users...]
        Another question that comes to mind is "How often do Soviet troop
movements or something of that nature cause a defcon decrease to bring us to
the brink of global extermination... and the public never knows about it?"
During the Kennedy Administration, this country was brought to what is the
equivalent of DEFCON-2 when the Soviets brought their missiles into Cuba in
the early 1960's. From what transcripts say about the incident, we were
seconds away from DEFCON-1... what a pisser, huh? Although that happened seven
years before I was born, my generation would have taken it with a grain of
salt and looked at it as a chance to get a tan. (A real good one, I might
add...) Our country goes seconds from World War III and we never found out
until years later. How often does this happen? Personally, I'd like to know
when Vodka is going to replace Coca-Cola as the national beverage. I'd also
like to know when fish eggs are going to be put on the menu at fast food
joints.
         At this very moment [4:27 AM on Sunday, November 11, 1990 if anyone
is curious... -Ed.] United States and Allied troops are in the Middle East
preparing for war. The media reports that all the troops are over there just
sitting around bored to death. [Yet another Editor's Note -- Due to a time
control problem, I will finish this essay instead of Sir Lawrence...
Apologies for the interruption.] It's very possible we could have another
Vietnam on our hands. Hell, Saddam Hussain is not going to stop with the
invasion of Kuwait... There's a very interesting parallel between Hussain and
a short German guy who started World War II... I'm not so sure why everyone's
worried about German Reunification -- It's the Iraqis we SHOULD be worrying
about! Hussain insists that the American citizens that he is holding hostage
in various hotels in Baghdad are "Guests". We might do well to round up every
last Iraqi citizen in this country who has a visa or green card and stick 'em
all in ONE Motel 6 somewhere in the midwest. Let Tom Bodett deal with them for
a while... Perhaps the CIA could go blow up some of their planes or important
buildings... Goodness knows they've done the same to us enough times to make
the average citizen want to puke. If we hurry up and storm the place NOW,
before Saddam figures out how to put together that mail-order nuclear bomb,
we could take the whole place over in a matter of days. We could use that oil.
The weapons manufacturers would make a fortune, perhaps even create new jobs.
Our economy could USE a boost, with the gas prices what they are. [Sidenote:
Who's to say that Exxon isn't financing Saddam Hussain?] Sell the entire
country to Russia for them to use as parking, for that matter.
        The projected costs for Operation Desert Shield are in the billions,
while it has accomplished virtually nothing. Truly another case of YOUR TAX
DOLLARS AT WORK.
        But who's to say if this is for real? This may be a conspiracy by the
oil companies (who secretly own the government) to make more money. The
government controls the media, which is our only source if information from
over there. Small wonder they want to supress publications like PHRACK...
They aren't from the government-controlled media.

Why Beer*Net?
-------------
        Houston is famed for its intolerance of basic rights and
the opinions of others on its bulletin board systems.  This is not
surprising in a city where the most common activity is the proverbial
leechline activity, but is distressing nonetheless to intelligent users
who want to make their opinions known without living in fear of
mysterious account modifications, deletions or message removal.  At
times the oppression has been so blatant that users have made the
transition from user to sysop and have run "free speech" systems that
broke all of the established (and stupid) rules and allowed the open
expression of intelligence.  They have always met with opposition from
the petty tyrants who run their own digital kingdoms for the
gratification of having power, no matter how unconnected to reality it
is.  And, since these types generally invest a good deal of money in
their systems, they are the ones who have what the common user covets -
file transfers - and use this as the basis of their power.  When
something threatening such as a board with free speech allowed or a no
ratio file transfer system appears, they often band together and assault
the sysop, especially if he is a minor, where they know they can
sufficiently confuse his parents into forcing them to remove the
offending bulletin board system.  This has happened to more than one
reputable user-turned-sysop, and with the emergence of Beer*Net, will
hopefully be eradicated.

Free Speech
-----------
        Simply put, "free speech" is the right to say whatever the user
pleases without any immediate repercussions other than the responses of
fellow users.  On a free speech BBS, a user may say whatever he wishes
without trepidation, because the sysop is honor bound not to take action
against the user.  This is not easy for a sysop, especially when said
user espouses neanderthal beliefs such as racism or bigotry.  However,
the overall outlook is much better for a BBS that allows intellectual
development and interesting posts through free speech than for a
squeaky-clean and silent BBS.  This is a basic right we hold to be
necessary, and we, the Beer*Net sysops, are committed to defend it.
        We agree that by allowing free speech we are exempting the users
from action taken by the sysop against them for what they say publicly
or privately on a BBS, with the exception of illegal activity such as
passing long distance codes or passwords.  We also agree that we will
not read private mail, nor will we ever use a user's account for our own
purposes.  Any change in access level, change in user information or
deletion of a part or the whole of the user's account in response to
user posting is considering a violation, as are passing on to any other
sysop, user or official all or part of a user's information and
confronting anyone but the user himself with details of a supposed
infraction.
        In addition, we are committed to helping others interested in
maintaining free speech on bulletin board systems.  If we hear of a case
where unwarranted harrassment is being delivered by other sysops, we are
pledged to combat it by whatever means necessary.  Rights must be
preserved above all.

The Systems
-----------
        The systems listed on the file header are all committed to the
Beer*Net ideals and have implemented them.  They do not support
blacklisting, and do not pass on user information between systems or to
other users.  Moreover, the sysops will NOT call up parents or deal with
anyone besides the user himself regarding the user's conduct.  The
sysops do reserve the right to preserve in copy buffer form all or part
of any chats, posts, or e-mail directed to the sysop or in a public
area.  These policies are implemented at the verification of this file
by all of the sysops involved.

History
-------
        Beer*Net was an idea developed in part by the sysops of TURD
(the "original" true free speech system), namely Royal Flush, Vile Scent
(Toxic Waste, Yeast Infection) and Captain Crapp (Vehicular Slaughter,
Nuclear Gerbil) and in part by Zen Master, an original user on TURD and
now sysop of the Magic Window.
        TURD had its origins in the Apple II community, where the sysops
observed that more than the normal amount of petty didactic types
reigned, and committed themselves to do something about it.  Today, the
remnants of TURD are to be found in Apocalyptic Funhouse (713-531-1139),
as are parts of the Metal Hell and Dead Animal Pickup.
        Malacology Unlimited and Magic Window are later additions to the
free speaking world, but are viable systems worthy of investigation by
any user.  They are running Hermes on the Macintosh and TAG on a clone,
respectively.  All are open systems.

Attribution
-----------
        The credit for the impetus and ideas behind Beer*Net go to the
        following people:

Yeast Infection:        part of original brainstorm project
Myself:                 Captain Crapp had to be involved...
Zen Master:             stimulated us to further develop the idea

                        sysops in Houston

                        smarter...

     THE LAW OF TORTS

     James J. Spinelli
     The Activity Bulletin Board Service - ABBS - (914) 779-4273

     =====================================================================

     This paper is NOT intended as a substitute for a lawyer NOR as a
     do-it-yourself kit. It provides basic information to help you under-
     stand certain legal principles. In any serious situation or when you
     are in doubt, there is no substitute for competent professional legal
     advice. Trying to act as your own lawyer can be costly and, in some in-
     stances, dangerous. The author assumes no responsibility, accountabil-
     ity or liability whatsoever in the use or misuse of any information
     presented herein. The information herein is of a general nature.

     =====================================================================

     Most of us are generally aware of what crimes are (murder, arson,
     theft, for example) but are vague about what the law refers to as
     torts. There's a good reason: leading legal writers agree that no one
     has satisfactorily defined a tort. This is partly because torts are so
     common, so widespread and so varied. You are far more likely to be the
     victim of a tort than a crime, and you are also far more likely to com-
     mit a tort than a crime.

     The purposes of this paper are sevenfold:

          1.   To explain torts;
          2.   To show how they differ from crimes;
          3.   To stress the importance, in the law of torts, of
               negligence, intent and liability;
          4.   To indicate what relief is available to you when a
               tort has been committed against you or your property;
          5.   To show you how to seek that relief by starting a
               lawsuit;
          6.   To explain how such a suit is tried;
          7.   To relate all of the above purposes to a specific
               classification of circumstances, i.e., how they relate
               to the role and responsibilities of a systems operator
               (Sysop) of an electronic bulletin board service (BBS).

     TORTS VERSUS CRIMES - A tort is a civil wrong against an individual. A
     crime, on the other hand, is an offense against the public at large, or
     the state. For example, an automobile driver who carelessly bumps into
     your car in a parking lot and crumples the fender has committed a tort

     against your property. Because the law recognizes your legal right to
     freedom from injury to your property caused by other people's careless-
     ness, you are entitled to sue the driver and be awarded damages for his
     breach of your tight. But, he has committed no crime.

     Once again, a tort is an act that violates your private or personal
     rights. Unless the act that is a tort is also a crime, the state will
     do nothing about it. If you believe someone has violated your personal
     rights -- but has not acted against the interests of the public as a
     whole -- it is entirely up to you to seek relief by suing the person in
     the civil courts. If the person who you believe has legally aggrieved
     you is found liable -- that is, the judge or jury finds that the person
     did in fact injure you or your property -- the person may be required
     to:

          1.   give you relief by paying you "damages" for the injury or
               property loss you suffered,
          2.   discontinue the wrongful acts, or
          3.   restore to you what was taken from you.

     In some cases the person may be imprisoned.

     If the tort is also a crime, two separate legal actions confront the
     wrongdoer: your's and the state's.

     A tort is usually committed when someone injures you physically, dam-
     ages or misuses your property, attacks your reputation arbitrarily or
     takes away your liberty and freedom of action without just cause. To
     recover damages for a tort you must prove either that the act was com-
     mitted with deliberate intent (as when someone spreads false accusa-
     tions about you) or that it was the result of negligence.

     In most cases you must prove that the act inflicted actual damage or
     injuries. A malicious act that does you no harm is not sufficient cause
     for legal action.

     A person who is proved to have committed a tort will be held respon-
     sible for all the damages proved to have resulted from the act, includ-
     ing damages to "third parties."

     WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMITTING A TORT - Generally speaking, any per-
     son, young or old, mentally competent or not, is responsible for
     his/her torts, i.e., for the consequences of the actions to others in-
     jured by those actions. Here is an interesting distinction between
     torts and crimes. Children below a certain age not usually liable for
     crimes they commit, on the ground that children of their age really do
     not understand the significance of their actions. For basically the
     same reason, persons who have been adjudged mentally incompetent are
     not liable for their crimes. BUT, these SAME persons may be liable for
     their torts, whether they are deliberate or the result of carelessness.


     Intent is an essential element in such torts as libel and trespass. Al-
     most all employers are liable for the torts of their employees if the
     employee committed the harmful act during the course of employment.
     (This also applies to "agent" and "principal" relationships.) The point
     to keep in mind is that the law usually holds an employer liable for
     what happens when his employee is carrying out instructions and/or
     working on behalf on the employer. But, not all employers -- especially
     not governmental ones. The doctrine of sovereign immunity -- that the
     state cannot be sued except by its own consent -- severely limits your
     right to sue governments and governmental bodies for the torts of their
     employees. However, the US government and the government of many states
     have in recent years passed laws that do permit such suits to be
     brought against them. In some instances separate courts, usually called
     courts of claims, have been established to handle these actions.

     Some people may not be held liable in tort actions. Among them are hus-
     bands and wives, who are not considered responsible for each other's
     torts, and parents, who are not usually liable for the torts of their
     children. The situation changes, however, if the parent knows that the
     child has developed what lawyers call a vicious propensity to commit
     acts that injure other people or their property. In addition, some
     states have passed laws that do make the parents responsible for will-
     ful damage caused by their minor children.

     Of course, if it can be established that the husband or wife or parent
     or other adult actually thought up the tortious action, planned it and
     coerced or persuaded the spouse or child into committing it, than that
     adult or spouse WILL be held responsible for the act and liable for the
     damage it caused.

     Except for so-called acts of God, any interference with your personal
     or property rights, whether intentional or through negligence, is a
     tort.

     When it comes to personal rights, torts typically deal with one or more
     of the following intentional violations: (negligence comes later)

          1.   Interference with your freedom of movement
          2.   Misuse of the legal process
          3.   Interference with your person
          4.   Interference with your peace of mind
          5.   Interference with your privacy
          6.   Interference with your reputation

     For our purposes, we shall examine only items 4, 5 and 6 -- interfer-
     ence with your peace of mind, your privacy and your reputation.


     INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR PEACE OF MIND - The growth in the sciences of
     medicine and psychology has brought about an expansion of the idea of
     freedom from fear or apprehension. You may have an action against some-
     one who intentionally inflicts mental suffering on you. You have a
     right to freedom from the consequences of mentally abusing malicious
     acts, and the courts protect that right by awarding damages -- nominal,
     or small, if the harm is slight; punitive, or large, if the damage is
     great or the act particularly outrageous. Consider the mental anguish
     if you are worried that someone will come into your home and cause dam-
     age, or that someone will "attack" your computer system while you are
     not around to protect it. The more expensive the equipment (your prop-
     erty), the more punitive the damages. At times, the intent alone, par-
     ticularly if shown to be an act of vengeance or malice, can be suffi-
     cient to award punitive damages that are considerably greater than the
     cost or value of property, depending on the mental anguish suffered. If
     such an act disrupts a business, the mental anguish can be quite se-
     vere, and the tort may be punishable by stiff fines and/or a jail term.
     In some cases, such torts can be classified as a crime, which then ne-
     cessitates the state to step in, since some states view the mental an-
     guish to be associated with acts of violence that concern the public at
     large. This applies since other businesses may be subjected to similar
     malfeasance.

     INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR PRIVACY - This is another right protected by the
     courts -- your right to be let alone. Such interference can take many
     forms, some obvious, others not so obvious. One of the not-so-obvious,
     or less direct violations to privacy, is the objectionable publicity to
     private information about you.

     INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR REPUTATION - As important as any freedom to
     which you are entitled is freedom from unwarranted, untruthful attacks
     on your character. This kind of attack, if made in the presence of
     other people, constitutes defamation, for which you are entitled to
     nominal or punitive damages, as the case may be. If you are defamed
     orally, you have been slandered. If the defamation is in writing and
     shown to or seen by someone else, you have been libeled. Slander is the
     less serious of the two torts because it is fleeting. The spoken words
     of defamation exist only as they are uttered and then disappear for-
     ever. Libel is permanent, and the damages awarded are therefore usually
     larger. Generally speaking, defamatory statements made over radio and
     television, and via computer are now considered libelous rather than
     slanderous.

     You can recover damages for slander or libel without proving actual fi-
     nancial loss if you are accused of something considered serious. The
     reason is that, since the good reputation of a professional person is
     essential to his/her ability to make a living, the law assumes that
     such accusations will diminish that ability and will therefore damage
     the individual. This kind of attack slander or libel is called slander
     or libel per se. Spreading lies about others, especially when the lies
     affect their ability to make a living or may hurt them in their family
     or public relationships, constitutes slander if spoken to others and
     libel if written or transmitted to others.

     With property rights, torts are generally concerned with the following
     intentional violations: (negligence comes later)

          1.   Nuisances
          2.   Keeping others off your property
          3.   Misuse of your personal property
          4.   Interference with your contractual and business
               relationships
          5.   Fraud, deceit and misrepresentation


     For our purposes, we shall examine items 3, 4 and 5 above, i.e., misuse
     of your personal property, interference with contractual/business rela-
     tionships, and fraud, etc.

     MISUSE OF YOUR PERSONAL PROPERTY - You have the right to the unre-
     stricted and uninterrupted enjoyment of your personal property. The law
     provides remedies for the intentional interruption of your right or in-
     terference with it. Interference with your personal property is called
     the tort of conversion. It can be conduct intended to affect your per-
     sonal property or conduct that, even though not intentionally wrong, is
     inconsistent with your right of ownership.

     Examples of conversion are:

          1.   Someone intentionally alters the property
          2.   Someone uses your property in a manner inconsistent
               with your wishes or requirements

     In both of these cases, your control of your property has been inter-
     fered with, and you are entitled to sue for the tort of conversion.

     INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR CONTRACTUAL AND BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS - You
     have a right to freedom from interference by others with the contrac-
     tual relationships you have entered into. This applies even when, after
     the contractual or business relationship, admission of errors are ac-
     knowledged by the offending party. (Remember, contracts occur into com-
     mon forms: oral and written. NOTE: The law of contracts is beyond the
     scope of this paper, and will only be referred to as sufficient to re-
     late to torts as defined herein.) Damages can be punitive if you can
     convince the court that the defendant specifically set out to interfere
     with the relationship or set out to ruin your reputation within the
     confines of your relationship. Proof need only be beyond a reasonable
     doubt and not necessarily overwhelmingly convincing. Potential disrup-
     tion also is considered, since business relationships can be both
     short- and long-term.

     FRAUD, DECEIT AND MISREPRESENTATION - You have a right to freedom from
     being improperly induced or persuaded to do something, or not to do
     something, by someone's trickery. What is involved in this tort is:

          1.   A conscious or knowing false statement made to you,
          2.   by someone who knew the statement was false,
          3.   with the intention  that you would rely on it,
          4.   followed by your actual reliance on it, and
          5.   your "suffering" as a result.

     The main thing here is for the person suing to establish that he/she
     was consciously tricked and that if the correct information had been
     given, the suing person would not have acted as he/she did.


     We now move onto the Law of Torts as it applies to the accidental in-
     terference with your personal or property rights. This is typically
     classified under the general heading of NEGLIGENCE.

     Earlier, we were concerned with the intentional interferences with your
     various rights as a member of society. In each of the torts presented
     the harm was intended or the result of an intended act. But, there is a
     large area of the law of torts that is basically different -- the area
     of civil wrongs or torts that are the result of negligence, or mere
     carelessness.

     In our increasingly complex society, wrongs resulting from carelessness
     are becoming more numerous than intentional torts. In any case, there
     is a major difference between the two kinds of wrong: to recover from
     someone's negligent conduct toward you, you must prove actual damages
     -- you must establish that the person really did injure your person or
     your property. By contrast with intentional torts, such as trespass,
     you are entitled to some damages just by proving the tort was commit-
     ted.

     Unintentional interference can result either from negligence or from
     accident.

     WHAT IS NEGLIGENCE - Legal actionable negligence exists when:

          1.   You have a legal duty or obligation to conform to a
               certain standard of conduct to protect others against
               unreasonable risk;
          2.   You fail to conform to that standard;
          3.   Your conduct is so closely related to the resulting
               injury that it can be said to have caused it --
               to have been its proximate cause, and
          4.   Actual damages results from your conduct.

     If these four elements are present in a situation in which you are in-
     volved, you may be sued and you will find it hard to defend yourself.

     These elements of negligence are reasonably clear. But, you should rec-
     ognize that the existence of "a legal duty or obligation" to others may
     depend on the circumstances of the case in which you are being sued.
     You have a legal duty to others only if the court or a statute says you
     do. You have no obligation if the court finds none.

     When a tort suit is tried, the standard of care expected of the defen-
     dant is defined by the judge (or the jury). The judge (or the jury, if
     there is one) determines the facts of the case and applies them in
     light of his/her (or their) definition.


     In groping around for guidelines as to whether you do or do not have a
     duty to act a certain way, and in deciding whether your conduct meets
     the required standard, the courts compare your conduct with the pre-
     sumed conduct of a reasonable or prudent man. If this imaginary reason-
     able or prudent man would have acted a certain way, the person who does
     is liable. You are supposed to do what the prudent man would do, and
     you are not supposed to do what the prudent man would not do.

     As A.P. Herbert, the English legal humorist, put it:

               He is an ideal, a standard, the embodiment of all
               those qualities which we demand of the good citizen...
               He is one who invariably looks where he is going,
               and is careful to examine the immediate foreground
               before he executes a leap or a bound...who never swears,
               gambles or loses his temper; who uses nothing except
               in moderation....In all that mass of authorities which
               bears upon this branch of the law there is no single
               mention of a reasonable woman.

     A key element in a successful negligence suit is the connection between
     what was done and the injury that supposedly resulted from the act. The
     person suing must prove that the defendant caused injury to his/her
     person or property. Some courts in trying to decide whether an act was
     the proximate cause of subsequent damage have applied what is called
     the "foreseeability test." They hold that the negligence is not the
     proximate cause unless the consequence was one that, in the light of
     all circumstances, our reasonably prudent man could have foreseen as a
     probably result of his actions or his failure to act.

     (NOTE: There is modification to the prudent man rule when professionals
     or experts in given fields are involved. Here, the court views the
     facts in light of the nature of the knowledge of the expert. For ex-
     ample, a computer programmer is not viewed the same way as a casual
     computer user. Actions attributable to an expert are viewed in terms of
     how the typical expert in that field would have acted or would not have
     acted. If a casual computer user unintentionally damaged your computer
     system, it would not be given the same consideration as if an "expert"
     did the same thing. Remember, we are dealing with reasonableness, and
     expertise or skills above the "ordinary person" can weigh heavily in
     determining the final outcome of a tort-based lawsuit.

     Other circumstances can apply, particularly if a business transaction
     occurs and/or a contract is in force.)


     YOUR DUTY TO OTHERS WHO COME ONTO YOUR PROPERTY - If you own property
     (any kind of property, not just real estate, e.g., computer bulletin
     board systems), you have definite responsibilities to persons coming
     onto that property legally or otherwise. Even to a trespasser, someone
     entering your property illegally, you have an obligation to give warn-
     ing of any genuinely dangerous (or injurious/harmful) condition known
     only to you. If you hobby is a computer bulletin board, you'd be wise
     to post a warning sign (or disclaimer) so that casual trespassers real-
     ize that there may be a danger in wandering around your property.

     (NOTE: You must be able to prove that the warning was in fact in such a
     place, state or condition that it could not have been bypassed or mis-
     interpreted. A warning (or disclaimer) that people cannot easily view
     or is not reasonably obvious is no warning at all. For example, a
     typical news item that can be bypassed on a bulletin board log-on is
     not considered a reasonable posting of a warning because it can be by-
     passed -- is not necessarily obvious to all.)

     You owe a stricter responsibility to trespassing children (minors) be-
     cause they are children and unlikely to realize or care about the fine
     points of the law of trespass. To protect young trespassers and to com-
     pensate them for injuries they may suffer in behaving like children,
     the courts have thrown over them a mantle called the attractive nui-
     sance doctrine. This doctrine requires the property owner who maintains
     on his property anything attractive to young children, and dangerous to
     them because of their immaturity and unawareness of possible risks, to
     exercise reasonable care in protecting them against the dangers of the
     attraction.

     (Think about this should you be carrying pornographic material on your
     bulletin board, or other such attractions that children can be harmed
     from. Computer games may become a potential source of difficulty given
     the current lawsuit against the manufacturers and distributors of Dun-
     geons & Dragons -- the "game" being blamed as a teenager's cause for
     committing a crime. As "ludicrous" as it may sound, the case is going
     to court.)

     There is a group of people called licensees who may come onto your
     property with your implied permission. They are different from tres-
     passers who have no permission, and you have a somewhat stronger obli-
     gation to protect them. You have a duty to warn them of dangerous or
     hazardous or harmful conditions they may not anticipate or easily see.
     (The law regarding your obligation to casual guests in your computer
     system is specialized and evolving.)

     Invitees are the people coming onto your property to whom you owe the
     maximum duty of protection, not only against risks you actually do know
     about, but also against dangers that you should know about if you exer-
     cised reasonable care. Invitees are persons who enter your property
     upon your business and upon your express or implied invitation.


     As in most tort cases, the court and the jury will carefully consider
     the facts in each situation before coming to a decision about whether
     or not the defendant was negligent. One rule commonly applied is that
     the standard of care required of the property owner is greater to the
     degree that the presence of people on his property is helpful or prof-
     itable to the property owner. In other words, a bulletin board sysop,
     who gains a benefit from your visiting his/her system, has a greater
     duty to you than does a friend who invites you to his/her home as a so-
     cial guest. (Note: the benefit need NOT be monetary.). The application
     of general rules is up to the court. The liability to trespassers,
     invitees and licensees is the owner's or that of the person in legal
     possession. (For example, if you lend your computer system to someone,
     and harm is done, the liability belongs to the person in legal posses-
     sion, which may or may not be your's., depending on the nature of the
     possession and of the restrictions thereof.)

     Torts frequently occur under circumstances in which, although it is im-
     possible to prove negligence on anyone's part, what happens is so ex-
     traordinary that negligence is presumed. As the courts say, the thing
     speaks for itself: res ipsa loquitur.

     The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may also be invoked where damage is
     caused by the breakdown of a device that is under the complete owner-
     ship and control of the defendant.


     THE IMPORTANCE OF LIABILITY - Underlying all of this is your right to
     recover for injuries you suffer from interference with your right to be
     free from a variety of wrongs, some well established and others just
     becoming established. If you feel that you have been wronged, you
     should carefully consider still another factor that will influence your
     decision whether or not to sue.

     This is the question, which only your lawyer should decide, of whether
     there is any liability on the part of the person who has wronged you.
     He will be liable, and your legal action against him will succeed, only
     if he/she has actually violated a legal duty which is owed to you as an
     individual. Forgetting momentarily the question of your responsibility
     for what happened, you can recover only where what was done or failed
     to be done violated the course of conduct that the reasonably prudent
     man would have done.

     If the conduct of the person you want to sue has not, judged by the
     presumed conduct of the reasonably prudent man, violated a duty to you,
     the chances are you have no action. Liability is essential: you can win
     your suit only if the person you are suing acted or failed to act in
     such a way as to make the person liable. Liability results from conduct
     that violates or interfers with one of your rights that the law recog-
     nizes. If there is no such conduct there is no liability, no matteer
     how aggrieved you may feel.


     However, remember that the "prudent man" standard can also vary. Pro-
     fessionals, i.e., doctors, lawyers, computer specialists, and the like,
     are not your "ordinary" layperson. As such, the standards that govern
     their conduct are viewed as a prudent practioner within the area of
     speciality. These standards are gauged at a higher level than the ordi-
     nary citizen's.

     RIGHTING THE WRONG - Let's say that your lawyer has decided that, on
     the basis of the facts you have given, the person who has wronged you
     had a duty not to do so and that a court can therefore find the person
     liable for violation of that duty. The question of which remedy you
     should seek becomes all-important. Underlying the answer to this ques-
     tion is the subject of damages. Also, keep in mind that many inten-
     tional torts are or can be crimes.

     Someone, for example, breaks into your computer system and destroys all
     of the information you had stored there. It would take you weeks, if
     not months, if at all, to be able to restore that information. However,
     in the process you are severely compromised for work that you were per-
     forming for someone for a fee. What is the "cost" of the damage? You
     need to decide whether what you've lost is worth the expense of suing.
     Also, is the person you are suing "judgment-proof?" That is, is the
     person being sued broke or without assets? Sure you can sue, but if you
     can't recover anything, you've gained nothing. You've lost the expense
     of the legal action. You may, therefore, decide to sue on principle.
     Provided you have the funds to take legal action, and do not care very
     much about recovering money damages, you may continue your efforts. In
     this example, some states would view the action as a crime. If so,
     "punishment" may no longer be simply "monetary" in nature.

     You are not limited to asking for money damages when you have been de-
     prived of your property. You may try to get back the property itself,
     or a reasonable facsimile. Let's say that someone causes damage to your
     equipment. You may sue to get back equipment of equal value.

     There are certain other torts for which money damages are not the re-
     lief you want. If you are bothered by the neighbor who persists in
     walking across your property despite all your requests that he stop,
     money damages don't help you much. What you want in such a case is a
     court order that he stop. Such an order is called an "injunction."

     Now, let's apply all of this to the BBS environment.


          ABBS wishes to thank Frank Levine, Attorney at Law and Co-Sysop

                    (2) intentionally exceeds an authorization to ac-
                        cess that facility and thereby obtains, alters,
                        or prevents  authorized access to a
                        wire or electronic communication while it is
                        in electronic storage in such system shall be
                        punished as provided in subsection (b) of this
                        section.

               (b) Exceptions.--A person or entity may divulge the con-

                    (1) to an addressee or intended recipient of such
                        communication or an agent of such addressee or
                        intended recipient;
                    (2) as otherwise authorized in section 2516,
                        2511(2)(a) or 2703 of this title;
                    (3) with the lawful consent of the originator or an
                        addressee or intended recipient of such
                        communication, or the subscriber in the case of
                        remote computing service;
                    (4) to a person employed or authorized or whose fa-
                        cilities are suited to forward such communication
                        to its destination;
                    (5) as may be necessarily incident to the rendition
                        of the service or to the protection of the
                        rights or property of the provider of that ser-
                        vice; or
                    (6)to a law enforcement agency, if such contents--
                              (A) were inadvertently obtained by ser-
                                  vice provider; and
                              (B) appear to pertain to the commission
                                  of a crime.

                             REPORT LANGUAGE

          Proposed section 2701 provides a new criminal offense.  The
          offense consists of either: (1) intentionally accessing,
          without authorization, a facility through which an electronic
          communication service is provided or (2) intentionally exceeding
          the authorization of such facility.

          In addition, the offense requires that the offender must, as
          a result of such conduct, obtain, alter, or prevent
          unauthorized access to a wire or electronic communication
          while it is in electronic storage in such a system.  The
          term electronic storage is defined in section 2510(17) of
          Title 18.  Electronic storage means any temporary,
          intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication
          incidental to the electronic transmission thereof and  the
          storage of such communication by an electronic communications
          service for the purpose of back-up protection of such
          communication.

          Section 2701(a) makes it an offense intentionally to access
          without authorization, or to exceed an authorization to ac-
          cess, an electronic communication service and thereby obtain,
          or prevent authorized access to a wire or electronic
          communication while it is in electronic storage in such sys-
          tem. This provision addresses the growing problem of unautho-
          rized persons deliberately gaining  access to, and sometimes
          tampering with, electronic or wire communication that are not
          intended to be available to the public.

          The Committee recognizes however that some electronic com-
          munication services offer specific features, sometimes known
          as computer "electronic bulletin boards," through which
          interested person may communicate openly with the public to
          exchange computer programs in the public domain and other
          types of information that may be distributed without legal
          constraint.

          It is not the intent to hinder the development or use of
          "electronic bulletin boards" or other comparable services.
          The Committee believes that where communciations are
          readily accessible to the general public, the sender has,
          for purposes of Section 2701(a), extended an "authorization"
          to the public to access those communications. A person may
          reasonably conclude that a communication is readily acces-
          sible to the general public if the telephone number of the
          system and other means of access are widely known, and if a
          person does not, in the course of gaining access, encounter
          any warnings, encryptions, password requests or other indicia
          of intended privacy.  To access a communication on such a
          system should not be a violation of the law.

          Some communcation systems offer a mixture of services, some,
          such as bulletin boards, which may be readily accessible to
          the general public, while others--such as electronic
          mail--may be intended to be confidential. Such a system
          typically has two or more distinct levels of security. A
          user may be able to access electronic bulletin boards and
          the like merely with a password he assigns to himself,
          while access to such  features as electronic mail ordinarily
          entails a higher level of security (i.e., the mail must be
          addressed to the user to be accessible specifically).

          Section 2701 would apply differently to the different
          services. These wire or electronic communications which the
          service provider attempts to keep confidential would be
          protected, while the statute would impose no liability for
          access to feature configured to be readily accessible to the
          general public.

          Section 2702 specifies that a person or entity providing wire
          or electronic communication service to the public may
          divulge the contents of a communication while in electronic
          storage by that service with the lawful consent of the
          originator or any addressee or intended addressee or
          intended recipient of such communication. The committee
          emphasizes that "lawful consent" in this context, need not
          take the form of a formal written document of consent. A
          grant of consent electronically would protect the service
          provider from liability  for disclosure  under section 2702.


          Under various circumstances, consent might be inferred to
          have arisen from a course of dealing between the service
          provider and the customer or subscriber--e.g. where a
          history of transactions between the parties offers a basis
          for a reasonable understanding that a consent to disclosure
          attaches to a particular class of communications. Consent
          may also flow from a user having had a reasonable basis for
          knowing that disclosure or use may be made with respect to a
          communications, and having taken action that evidences
          acquiescence to such disclosure or use--e.g., continued use
          of such an electronic communication system. Another type of
          implied consent might be inferred from the very nature of
          the electronic transaction. For example, a subscriber who
          places a communication on a computer "electronic bulletin
          board," with a reasonable basis for knowing that such
          communications are freely made available to the public,
          should be considered to have given consent to the disclosure
          or use of the communication. If conditions governing
          disclosure or use are spelled out in the rules of an
          electronic communication service, and those rules are
          available to users or in contracts for the provision of such
          services, it would be appropriate to imply consent on the
          part of a user to disclosures or uses consistent with those
          rules.

          Section 2702(a) specifies that a person or entity providing
          a wire  or electronic communication service or remote
          computer services to the public shall not knowingly divulge
          the contents of any communication while in electronic
          storage by that service to any person or entity other than
          the addressee or intended recipient of such communication or
          an agent of such addressee or intended recipient of the
          communications. Under some circumstances, however, a
          customer or subscriber to a wire or electronic communication
          service may place a communication on the service without
          specifying an addressee.

          The Committee intends, in that situation, that the communica-
          tion at a minimum be deemed addressed to the service provider
          for purposes of Section 2702(b). Because an addressee may
          consent to the disclosure of a communication to any other
          person, a service provider or system operator, as implied
          addressee, may disclose the contents of an unaddressed
          communcation.


          A person may be an "intended recipient" of a
          communication, for purpose of section 2702, even if he is
          not individually identified by name or otherwise. A
          communication may be addressed to the members of a group,
          for example. In the case of an electronic bulletin board,
          for instance, a communication might be directed to all
          members of a previously formed "special interest group" or,
          alternatively, to all members of the public who are
          interested in a particular topic of discussion. In such an
          instance, the service provider would not be liable for
          disclosure to any person who might reasonably be considered
          to fall in the class of intended recipients.

                                 COMMENTS

          The entire document has to be read and studied to draw final
          conclusions on a number of important issues. However, the
          following observations can be made:

          1. SYSOPS are to be considered providers of an electronic
             communications service. In other words, whenever a BBS
             goes up, it becomes an electronic communication service
             subject to the requirements of the law.

          2. Users of the BBS are protected and may have grounds to take
             action against or ask that criminal charges be brought if
             their communications are improperly disclosed.

          3. SYSOPs do have added protection against hackers, and
             federal law enforcement is available.

          4. Any "general" messages addressed to all members of the
             board, provided the board is open to the general public, may
             be disclosed and are not protected.

          5. However:

               a.  It is unclear whether a sysop may legally read pri-
                   vate mail on his board addressed to another user, un-
                   less sysop discloses in a warning message  that
                   he/she may read such messages.

               b.  Conferences that are not generally open to the pub-
                   lic may create an expectation of privacy and there
                   will be limited rights to disclose information.

               c.  Major changes in security procedures may require
                   user consent, or their messages may have to be re-
                   moved.


          6. It would be prudent to have a major disclaimer in the in-
             troduction of each BBS session, stating that there is no ex-
             pectation of privacy and that anything  left on the board
             may be read or disclosed by the sysop.

          Next, we present the "LEGAL" view.

     We wish to thank our friend, Ruel Hernandez, for the information in
     this section of our report.

                   COMPUTER_ELECTRONIC_MAIL_AND_PRIVACY

                                INTRODUCTION

     Four years ago, Congress introduced legislation which sought to
provide federal statutory guidelines for the privacy protection of
electronic communications, including electronic mail (e-mail) found on
commercial computer-based services and on other remote computer systems such
as electronic bulletin board systems (BBS).  The old federal wiretap law
only gave protection to normal audio telephone communications.  Before the
legislation culminated into the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986 (ECPA), which went into effect on January 20, 1987, there was no
contemplation of computer-based electronic communications being transmitted
across telephone lines and then being stored on disk for later retrieval by
or forwarding to its intended recipient.  Federal law did not provide
guidelines for protecting the transmitted electronic messages once they were
stored on these computer-based communications services and systems.

                                 QUESTIONS

     (1) Whether electronic mail and other intended private material stored
on an electronic computer communications service or system have Fourth
Amendment privacy protection?

     (2) Should private electronic mail and other such material be accorded
federal statutory protection guidelines such as those enjoyed by the U.S.
Mail?

                                  PROBLEM

     Law enforcement seeks criminal evidence stored as e-mail either on a
commercial computer service, such as CompuServe, GEnie or The Source, or on
a hobbyist-supported BBS.  (Note, this situation is equally applicable to
personal, private data stored on a remote system for later retrieval, such
as with CompuServe's "personal file" online storage capabilities.)


     For example, a computer user calls up a computer communication system.
Using the electronic mail function, he leaves a private message that can
only be read by an intended recipient.  The message is to inform the
recipient of a conspiracy plan to violate a federal or state criminal
statute.  Law enforcement gets a tip about the criminal activity and learn
that incriminating evidence may be found on the computer system.

     In 1982, such a situation occurred.  (Meeks, Life_at_300_Baud:_Crime_on
the_BBS_Network, Profiles, Aug. 1986, 12-13.) A Detroit federal grand jury,
investigating a million-dollar cocaine ring, issued a subpoena ordering a
commercial service, The Source, to hand over private subscriber data files.
The files were routinely backed up to guard against system crashes.  The
grand jury was looking for evidence to show that the cocaine ring was using
The Source as a communications base to send messages to members of the ring.
With such evidence, the grand jury could implicate and indict those
suspected of being part of the cocaine ring.  The Source refused to obey the
subpoena on the basis of privacy.  The prosecution argued The Source could
not vicariously assert a subscriber's privacy rights.  Constitutional rights
are personal and could only be asserted by the person whose rights are
invaded.  Additionally, since the files containing messages were duplicated
by the service, any user expectation of privacy would be extinguished.  A
court battle ensued.  However, before a ruling could be made, the kingpin of
the cocaine ring entered a surprise preemptive guilty plea to federal drug
trafficking charges.  The case against The Source was discontinued.

     Publicly posted messages and other public material may be easily
retrieved by law enforcement.  It is the private material, such as e-mail,
which posed the problem.

     Law enforcement's task was then to gather enough evidence to
substantiate a criminal case.  Specifically, they would want the e-mail, or
other private files, transmitted by suspected criminals.  In opposition, the
provider or systems operator of a computer communications service or system,
in his assumed role as keeper of transmitted private electronic messages,
would not want to turn over the private data.

                           INADEQUACY OF OLD LAW

     Meeks noted that as of August, 1986, "no ...  protection exist[ed] for
electronic communications.  Any law enforcement agency can, for example,
confiscate a local BBS and examine all the message traffic," including all
private files and e-mail.  (Id.)

CASE LAW

     There is little case law available on computer communications and
Fourth Amendment constitutional problems.  (See_generally M.D. Scott,
Computer Law, 9-9 (1984 & Special Update, Aug. 1, 1984).)  If not for the
preemptive guilty plea, the above described Detroit case may have provided
some guidance on computer-based communications and privacy issues.


     Of the available cases, there are those which primarily dealt with
financial information found in bank and consumer credit organization
computers.  In U.S._v._Davey, 426 F.2d 842, 845 (2 Cir. 1970), the
government had the right to require the production of relevant information
wherever it may be lodged and regardless of the form in which it is kept and
the manner in which it may be retrieved, so long as it pays the reasonable
costs of retrieval.  In a California case, Burrows_v._Superior_Court, 13
Cal. 3d 238, 243, 118 Cal. Rptr. 166, 169 (1974), a depositor was found to
have a reasonable expectation that a bank would maintain the confidentiality
of both his papers in check form originating from the depositor and the
depositor's bank statements and records of those checks.  However, in
U.S._v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 96 S.Ct. 1619 (1976), customer account
records on a bank's computer were held to not be private papers of the bank
customer, and, hence, there was no Fourth Amendment problem when they are
subpoenaed directly from the bank.

     Although these cases have more of a business character in contrast to
personal e-mail found on computer systems such as CompuServe or a hobbyist-
supported BBS, they would hold that there would be very little to legally
stop unauthorized access to computer data and information.

     Under the old law, a prosecutor, as in the Detroit case, may try to
analogize duplicated and backed up e-mail to business situations where data
on business computer databases are also backed up.  Both types of computer
data are stored on a system and then later retrieved.  The provider or
systems operator of a computer electronic communications system would
counterargue that the nature of computers always require the duplication and
backup of any computer data, whether the data files be e-mail or centrally-
based financial or credit data.  Data stored on magnetic media are prone to
possible destruction.  Duplication does not necessarily make e-mail the same
as financial or credit data stored in business computers.  Centrally-based
business information is more concerned with the data processing.  That
information is generally stored and retrieved by the same operator.  E-mail
is more concerned with personal communications between individuals where the
sender transmits a private message to be retrieved only by an intended
recipient.  The sender and the recipient have subjective expectations of
privacy that when viewed objectively are reasonable.  Therefore, there would
be a constitutionally protected expectation of privacy under Katz_v._U.S.,
389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507 (1967).

     However, the prosecution would note under California_v._Ciraolo, --
U.S. --, 106 S.Ct. 1809 (1984), users would have to protect their electronic
mail from any privacy intrusion.  The provider or operator of the service or
system has ultimate control over it.  He has complete access to all areas of
the system.  He could easily examine the material.  The prosecution would
note the user could not reasonably protect his private data from provider or
operator invasion.  This "knot-hole," where an observer can make an
observation from a lawful position, would exclude any reasonable expectation
of privacy.  If there is no privacy, there can be no search and therefore no
Fourth Amendment constitutional violation.  Law enforcement can retrieve the
material.


     The Justice Department noted the ambiguity of the knothole in a
response to Senator Leahy's question whether the then existing wiretap law
was adequate to cover computer communications.  (S. Rep. No. 541, 99th
Cong., 2d Sess. 4 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 3558.)  It
was "not always clear or obvious" whether a reasonable expectation of
privacy existed.  (Id.)

FEDERAL WIRETAP STATUTES

     The old federal wiretap statutes protected oral telephone
communications from police interceptions.  This protection was made during
1968 in response to electronic eavesdropping conducted by government.
(Cohodas, Congress_Races_to_stay_Ahead_of_Technology, Congressional
Quarterly Weekly Report, May 31, 1986, 1235.)  Although e-mail appears to
come under the old 18 U.S.C. sec. 2510(1) definition of "wire
communication," it was limited to audio transmissions by wire or cable.  The
old 18 U.S.C. sec. 2510(4) required that an interception of a wire
communication be an oral acquisition of the communication.  By being
"oral," the communication must be "heard." There would be a problem as to
whether an electronic communication could be "heard."  Data transmissions
over telephone lines generally sound like unintelligible noisy static or
high pitched tones.  There would certainly be no protection after a
communication has completed its transmission and been stored on a computer.
The communication's conversion into computer stored data, thus no longer in
transmission until later retrieved or forwarded as transmission to another
computer system, would clearly take the communication out of the old
statutory protected coverage.

     "Eighteen years ago ... Congress could not appreciate - or in some
cases even contemplate - [today's] telecommunications and computer
technology...."  (132 Cong. Rec. S7992 (daily ed. June 19, 1986) (statement
of Sen. Leahy).)

COMPARISON WITH U.S. MAIL PROTECTION

     A letter sent by first class mail is given a high level of protection
against unauthorized intrusion by a combination of federal and U.S. Postal
Service statutes and regulations.  For instance, the unauthorized taking out
of and examining of the contents of mail held in a "depository for mail
matter" before it is delivered to the mail's intended recipient is
punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.  (18 U.S.C. sec. 1702.)  In
comparison, under the old law, electronic communications had no protection.
Federal protection for U.S. Mail provided a suggested direction as to how
electronic communications should be protected when it was no longer in
transmission.

                           SOLUTION - THE NEW LAW

     There are two methods towards a solution: (1) court decisions; or (2)
new legislated privacy protection.


COURT DECISIONS

     Courts may have chosen to read computer communications protection into
the old federal wiretap statute or into existing state law.  However, they
were reluctant to do so.  Courts "are in no hurry to [revise or make new law
in this area] and some judges are openly asking Congress for help....
[F]ederal Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner in Chicago said Congress needed
to revise current law, adding that 'judges are not authorized to amend
statutes even to bring them up-to-date.'" (Cohodas, 1233.)

NEW STATUTE

     On October 21, 1986, President Reagan signed the new Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1986 amending the federal wiretap law.  ECPA
went into effect during the beginning of 1987.  (P.L.  99-508,
Title I, sec. 111, 100 Stat. 1859; P.L. 99-508, Title II, sec. 202, 100
Stat. 1868.)  ECPA created parallel privacy protection against both
interception of electronic communications while in transmission and
unauthorized access to electronic communications stored on a system.

     The new ECPA first provides privacy protection for any

     'electronic communication' ... [by] any transfer of signs,
     signals, writing, images, sounds, data or intelligence of any
     nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio,
     electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system that
     affects interstate or foreign commerce...."

(18 U.S.C. secs. 2510(12), 2511.)  The Senate Report noted examples of
electronic communications to include non-voice communications such as
"electronic mail, digitized transmissions, and video teleconferences."  (S.
Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 14 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. &
Ad. News 3568.)  Electronic communication is defined in terms of  how  it is
transmitted.  So long as the means by which a communication is transmitted
affects interstate or foreign commerce, the communication is covered ECPA.
(18 U.S.C. sec. 2510(12).)  Generally, that would include all telephonic
means including private networks and intra-company communications.  (S.
Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. &
Ad. News 3566.)

     Second, ECPA protects the electronic communication when it has been
stored after transmission, such as e-mail left on an electronic computer
communication system for later pickup by its intended recipient.  (18 U.S.C.
sec. 2510(17).)  The legislation makes it a federal criminal offense to
break into any electronic system holding private communications or to exceed
authorized access to alter or obtain the stored communications.  (18 U.S.C.
sec. 2701(a).)


     The legislation would protect electronic computer communication systems
from law enforcement invasion of user e-mail without a court order.  (18
U.S.C. secs. 2517, 2518, 2703.)  Although the burden of preventing
disclosure of the e-mail is placed on the subscriber or user of the system,
the government must give him fourteen days notice to allow him to file a
motion to quash a subpoena or to vacate a court order seeking disclosure of
his computer material.  (18 U.S.C. sec. 2704(b).)  However, the government
may give delayed notice where there are exigent circumstances as listed by
the Act (18 U.S.C. sec. 2705.)  Recognizing the easy user destruction of
computer data, ECPA allows the government to include in its subpoena or
court order the requirement that the provider or operator retain a backup
copy of electronic communications when there is risk of user destruction.
(18 U.S.C. sec. 2704(a).)

     The legislation gives a civil cause of action to the provider or
operator, subscriber, customer or user of the system aggrieved by an
invasion of an electronic communication in the system in violation of the
ECPA.  (18 U.S.C. secs. 2520, 2707.)  If the provider or operator has to
disclose information stored on his system due to a court order, warrant,
subpoena, or certification under ECPA, no cause of action can be brought
against him by the person aggrieved by such disclosure.  (18 U.S.C. sec.
2703(e); see_also 18 U.S.C. secs. 2701(c), 2702(b), 2511(2)(a)(i),
2511(3)(b)(iii) where the systems operator or provider is not held
criminally liable, may observe a private communication while performing
employment duties or according to authorization, etc., may intercept private
communication while making quality control checks or during the course of
forwarding communications to another system.)

SYSTEMS COVERED

     Clearly, the national commercial services in the United States,
including CompuServe, MCI Mail or a company using a contracted e-mail
service, such as GE QUIK-COM (See S. Rep. No.  99-541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.
8 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 3562) are covered by ECPA.

     However, there may be some confusion as to whether ECPA would protect
electronic communications found on a mere user-supported BBS.  For
instance, language in ECPA does not expressly state the term "bulletin
board."  Nonetheless, ECPA would indeed cover electronic bulletin boards.

     What are electronic bulletin boards?  Generally, they are personal
computers provided for and maintained by computer users out of their own
personal resources.  These systems traditionally allow free access to
computer/modem-equipped members of local communities and provide for both
public and private electronic mail exchange.  Some sophisticated systems,
such as the ProLine system written for Apple II computers, provide callers
with personal user areas where they may keep private files much like the
CompuServe personal file areas.


     Augmenting the single stand-alone BBS, there are networks of bulletin
boards linked together, often with the assistance of university mainframes,
with other bulletin boards or mainframe computers by sophisticated "mail
routing" systems (such as ARPAnet and FIDOnet).  These networks use
sophisticated message addressing instructions and computer automation where
networked computers make calls to other networked computers to exchange
"net-news" or private mail between users of the different bulletin boards.
Given the proper address routing instructions, a user may communicate with
another user on a cross-town BBS or on a BBS in another part of the country.
Although there is some delay with messages being routed through a network,
these networks help to reduce or eliminate the computer user's need to
make direct toll or long distance calls to faraway systems. (Note, there
are also network exchange systems and "gateways" between commercial
services.)

     Businesses have been turning to the use of BBS's and BBS mailing
networks for increased productivity, paperwork reduction, improved client
contact and the elimination of "telephone tag."  (See Keaveney,
Custom-Built_Bulletin_Boards, Personal Computing, Aug. 1987, 91.)
A number of these corporate BBS's are open to the public with
restricted access to business and client system areas.  Examples of
such systems include (a) two Washington D.C.  area boards run by Gannet
Company Inc. ("[f]or all Gannet/USA Today employees and other computer
users"), Issue Dynamics Inc. (catering to the consulting company's clients),
and (b) A Westchester County (NY) area board run by VITRON Management
Consulting, Inc. (catering to the general business community).

     ECPA language would show protection for bulletin boards.  18 U.S.C.
sec. 2510(15) provides that "'electronic communication service' means  any
service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire
or electronic communications".  A "remote computing service" was defined in
the Act as an electronic communications system that provides computer storage
or processing services to the public.  (18 U.S.C.  sec. 2710(2).)

     Intra-company communications systems, corporate BBSes, would also be
protected.  (S.  Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 reprinted_in 1986 U.S.
Code Cong. & Ad. News 3566.)  Language in ECPA refers to "the person or entity
providing the wire or electronic communication service," such as in 18 U.S.
secs.  2701(c)(1) and 2702(a)(1). Such language would indicate the inclusion
of individuals and businesses who operate bulletin board systems.

     The Senate report, in addition to defining "electronic mail," gave a
separate definition of "electronic bulletin boards":

          Electronic "bulletin boards" are communications networks created
     by computer users for the transfer of information among computers.
     These may take the form of proprietary systems or they may be commercial,
     or noncommercial systems operating among computer users sharing special
     interests.  These systems may [or may not] involve fees covering
     operating costs and may require special "passwords" which restrict
     entry to the system.  These bulletin boards may be public or
     semi-public in nature, depending on the degree of privacy sought by
     users, operators or organizers of such systems.

(S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 8-9 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code
Cong. & Ad. News 3562-3563.)

     ECPA, as enacted, takes note of the different levels of security found
on user-supported BBS's, i.e. the difference between configured system
areas containing private electronic mail and other areas configured to
contain public material.  (18 U.S.C. sec. 2511(2)(g)(i).)  The electronic
communications which a user seeks to keep private, through methods provided
by the system, would be protected by ECPA.  In contrast, there would be no
liability for access to features configured by the system to be readily
accessible by the general public.  An indicia of privacy on the system, with
no notice to show otherwise, would trigger ECPA coverage.  An indicia of
privacy may include passwords and prompts asking if a message is to be kept
private.

     House Representative Kastenmeier noted that there was an unusual
coalition of groups, businesses and organizations interested in ECPA.
(Kastenmeier, Communications_Privacy, Communications Lawyer, Winter 1987,
1, 24.)  Among those interested included the BBS community.  Reporters in
the BBS community noted how Senator Leahy and others were receptive to their
concerns.  They report Leahy to have been "soliciting [users and BBS
operators'] comments and encourag[ing] sensitivity to the needs of BBS's in
the legislation....  [Senators and congressional members] are ... willing to
listen to our side of things."  (BBSLAW02.MSG, dated 07/24/85, information
from Chip Berlet, Secretary, National Lawyers Guild Civil Liberties
Committee, transmitted by Paul Bernstein, SYSOP, LAW MUG, Chicago, Illinois
regarding Federal Legislation Affecting Computer Bulletin Boards, deposited
on The Legacy Network in Los Angeles, California.)

ESCAPING COVERAGE

     There are at least two possible ways to escape ECPA coverage.  The
first is to provide adequate notice that all material on a service or system
may be publicly accessible even though methods of providing privacy remain.
The bulletin board system maintained by DePaul University College of Law
Chicago, Illinois, provides an example of an electronic notice (displayed
upon user access):

     PURSUANT TO THE ELECTRONIC AND COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF 1986, 18
     USC 2510 et. seq., NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NO FACILITIES
     PROVIDED BY THIS SYSTEM FOR SENDING OR RECEIVING PRIVATE OR
     CONFIDENTIAL ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS.  ALL MESSAGES SHALL BE DEEMED
     TO BE READILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

     Do NOT use this system for any communication for which the sender
     intends only the sender and the intended recipient or recipients to
     read.

Note, although the DePaul notice states otherwise, user-operated message
privacy toggles remain on the board.  The second possible method to escape
ECPA coverage would be to merely not provide any means of privacy.


     One way of foiling the intent of a government subpoena or court order
requirement to keep duplicate copies of private electronic communications
would be the use of passworded private e-mail.  For instance, the private
e-mail capabilities of GEnie Mail and GE QUIK-COM include user-toggled
passwording which utilizes an encryption technique that no one, not even the
provider, knows how to decipher.  Bill Louden, General Manager of GEnie
(General Electric Network for Information Exchange), noted how GEnie Mail
and GE QUIK-COM passworded e-mail cannot be read by anyone who did not know
the password.  "[N]ot even our 'god' number could ever read the [passworded]
mail." (Message from Bill Louden, GEnie, Legacy RoundTable (LAW), category
1, topic 7, message 6 (May 15, 1987).)  The writer of the encryption
software has since left General Electric and no one has had success in
breaking the code.  (Message from Bill Louden, GEnie, Legacy RoundTable
(LAW), category 1, topic 7, message 10 (May 17, 1987).)

                                 CONCLUSION

     With ECPA, e-mail and other private electronic communications stored on
computer communication systems have privacy protection.  Unfortunately,
before ECPA, federal statutory guidelines for such protection were not
articulated.  Case law also did not provide any helpful guidance.  The
peculiarities of computers and computer storage were not addressed by the
old wiretap laws.  Electronic communications privacy could not stand up
against constitutional privacy law as defined by the United States Supreme
Court.  The then existing law was "hopelessly out of date." (S. Rep. No.
541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 reprinted_in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News
3556 (statement of Sen. Leahy).)  Fortunately, a legislative solution to
bring privacy law up to date with the advancing computer communication and
information technology was provided for in ECPA.


OBSERVATIONS

    One should note that ECPA was designed as a statutory solution to fill a
loop-hole in federal constitutional law where computer-communication
messages (e.g., email) are not protected.  Under traditional Fourth
Amendment Search and Seizure law, email and similar computer-communication
material are not considered to have any constitutional privacy protection
against government intrusion.  ECPA provides statutory privacy protection
where there is no constitutional protection.

    Generally, a BBS may fall under the coverage of ECPA if there is some
indicia of privacy found on the BBS.  There are various degrees of privacy
found on a BBS ranging from the opening login password to the sending of a
private message via UUCP.  Under ECPA, a sysop or online service employee
may not be found civilly liable for intercepting (i.e., reading/viewing)
private information or private messages between users who call in to a BBS
so long as he is performing "quality control checks" or other similar
duties.  This may include passive maintenance activity and intermail or
echomail forwarding.  ECPA thus provides some protection for a sysop from
civil liability if his system is found to fall under ECPA coverage.

    To escape coverage from ECPA, a BBS sysop may place a disclaimer at the
"front door" or throughout his system (such as an automatic notice whenever
if the caller wishes to send private email) giving the caller adequate
notice that the system has no privacy privileges.  (Note: what I mean by
privileges, in the legal sense, is much broader than mere privacy toggle
commands found on a BBS.)  Giving such notice would work to negate any
indicia of privacy that may be found on the system.  For instance, the sysop
may say that he has access to all private email, he will read all private
email, and he will disclose all improper or criminal information left on his
system to the appropriate authorities even if there are privacy toggle
commands found on the system -- and suggest the caller try another system if
he/she wishes to send secure private messages.  The sysop may then stand a
better chance of not being found liable under ECPA.

The DePaul University College of Law BBS Disclaimer:
----------------------------------------------------

This type of disclaimer, dealing with communications, should not be found to
be applicable to private login passwords -- in other words, passwords should
maintain their privileged private status.  (Note, some attorney may try to
argue that passwords are messages and therefore are excluded from ECPA by
the disclaimer and may be disclosed.)

Note, ECPA is primarily first a statutory solution to providing
statutory protection against government intrusion into private computer
communications in order to be more in tune with traditional Fourth Amendment
Search and Seizure law.  Generally, in order for police or other government
authorities to intrude into private computer communications, a court order,
subpeona, or warrant must be obtained.  A sysop may be ordered to provide
copies of particular information -- the warrant should particularly describe
what is sought, such as the author of the message, subject matter, etc.  The
author of the private information may also be given 14 days notice of the
search unless there are exigent circumstances, e.g., the author has the
ability to destroy the information.  Note, although there may be the
possibility that a sysop may be held in contempt of court for not providing
copies, this does not necessarily mean the sysop has the affirmative duty to
make and keep copies of all information kept on his system if it is not
reasonable for him to do so, e.g., the system program does not keep backups,
old messages are automatically destroyed after a certain period of time such
as on an HBBS system, etc. -- he may only have to provide copies when
ordered to do so and if reasonable (my interpretation).

    Although a sysop may not be found liable under the federal ECPA statute,
there may be alternative liability found under state law.  Generally, at the
state level, there is either state statutory or common law protection
against INVASION OF PRIVACY.  In particular, this would include (1) public
disclosure of private facts and (2) intrusion upon seclusion.  A possible
situation would include not only public disclosure of private email, but
also public discussion or private system passwords.  A good attorney may be
able to make good arguments to find liability under either one of the two
tort law causes of action -- particularly when a sysop holds himself or
herself out as a provider of private or semi-private information exchange.

    Note, under either the federal ECPA or state invasion of privacy laws, a
sysop or caller to a system may be able to sue users who break into the
closed or private areas of the system.  Of course, evidence would have to be
obtained to prove causation and liability and evidence is a completely
different issue problem....


Finally, there are several issues that are currently being reviewed for
possible statute inclusion. Such issues involve, but are not limited to:

     1. The dissemination and distribution of elements contributing to
        the delinquency or corruption of minors:
               - pornography
               - advocacy of games of chance (gambling)

     2. The maintenance of the integrity of electronically stored data
        and information within communication systems, including electronic
        bulletin boards.

These issues are the subject of a subsequent paper. In addition, they are
topics that represent areas of discussion within the potential PCBRelay
Legal conference.

We at VITRON (and ABBS) would greatly appreciate your feedback and input
regarding this paper. If you have any questions, comments, observations or
suggestions, please leave us a message. Your message will receive as prompt
a reply as is feasible (usually within 24 to 48 hours).

Subject: HR 4079 is for REAL!
Date: 29 Jun 90 20:04:36 GMT

(Thant Tessman) writes:
>A new bill, HR 4079 [...]

This posting bothered me enough even after dismissing the alarming rhetoric
that I placed a call to my Representative's local office. Two days later I
received a copy of HR 4079 in the mail. (I recommend others do the same - it
is too long for a lousy typist such as me to enter).

I found some errors in the claims made about it - but it is pretty bad stuff
anyway!  Some notes follow:

>[...] would open the way for American concentaration camps to be built,

It does. It calls for housing prisoners in "tent housing or other shelters
placed on available military bases and at other suitable locations." [P10L3-5]
It does not restrict the prisoners to those convicted of drug crimes.

In case that is insufficient, it calls for "any property that is determined
to be excess to the needs of a Federal agency that may be suitable for use as
a correctional facility shall be made available for such use..." [P15L5-7]

Oh, yes, it also says, "a Federal court shall not hold prison or jail
crowding unconstitutional under the eighth amendment except to the extent
that an individual plaintiff proves that the crowding causes the infliction
of cruel and unusual punishment of that inmate." [P8L14-18] The remedy?
"(2) The relief in a case described in paragraph (1) shall extend no
further than necessary to remove the conditions that are causing the cruel
and unusual punishment of the plaintiff inmate." [P8L19-22]

>and thereafter permit the state to round up suspected drug users

This one is a little difficult. Maybe I missed it, but it still requires
conviction. However, it does say, "Evidence which is obtained as a result of
a search or seizure shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a court of the
United States on the ground that the search or seizure was in violation of
the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, if the search
or seizure was carried out in circumstances justifying a reasonably objective
belief that is was in conformity with the fourth amendment." [P35L25-P36L7]

This is followed by (and this has been mentioned before): "The fact that
evidence was obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant
constitutes prima facie evidence of the existence of such circumstances."
[P36L7-9]

>so they can be forced to work without compensation for the state.

This is wrong. On Page 27, "Subtitle C - Mandatory Work Requirements for
Prisoners, Withholding Federal Benefits, and Drug Testing of Prisoners", it
does say "It is the policy of the Federal Government that convicted prisoners
confined in Federal prisons, jails, and other detention facilities shall
work." [P27L7-9]

However, it also says, "(2) Prisoners shall be paid a share of funds
generated by their labor conducted pursuant to this section." [P28L10-11]


>"The Drug Crime Emergency Act" drips with patriotism as Gingrich tries to
>vaguely connect the freedom movement in eastern Europe with America falling
>deeper and deeper into "the slavery of drug addiction."

I didn't find anything even remotely resembling this.

One small nit, there are exceptions listed to "All internees".

The 4th and 8th have been mentioned. There is a lengthy section called the
"Strom Thurmond Habeus Corpus Reform Initiative" [P37-43] which I cannot
reasonably comment on.

>A provision has been built in to allow the government to purchase goods

Just to clarify: This is a sentencing change - those already sentenced would
not be affected by this section.

>New mandatory sentences would be established, and probation, parole, and

True.

It says "no institution of higher education shall be eligible to receive
funds or any other form of financial assistance under any Federal program,
including participation in any federally funded or guaranteed student loan
program, unless it certifies to the Secretary that it has adopted and has
implemented a program to prevent the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of
alcohol by students and employees that, at a minimum, includes -
  (1) the annual distribution to each student and employee of -
      (A-E) [...information...]
  (2) provisions for drug testing; and
  (3) a biennial review by the institution of its program to -
      [...]"
[P57L19-P59L5]

It repeats essentially the same as above for "local educational agency".
[P60L13-P63L20]

There is even more in this bill than the authors of the quoted newsletter
mentioned. For example, it calls for:
 -revoking the driver's license of those convicted of drug crimes,
 -expansion of the "war on drugs" to include alcohol abuse,
 -the RICO-like seizure of property alleged to be used in or obtained through
  profits from drug crimes (with the burden upon victim/defendant to *prove*
  that it was not - could you *prove* you didn't buy your car with profits
  from illicit transactions?)
 -division of "profits" from such seizures, upon conviction, to be shared
  between the state and individuals who provided information leading to the
  conviction...

Yes!  (and thank you, Andrew, for posting this!)

What else can it be but that "this problem has become so serious we must
take special measures!"?

Sooo...  if you're *accused* of drug offences,  you no longer have a Sixth
Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. What issue of easy political
popularity will be next, I wonder: child abuse cases? Crimes against women
or the elderly? Flag desecration?


[And people wonder at my concern that we have passed the point where the
Bill of Rights is used to enumerate specifically the rights of the people,
as opposed to the idea expressed in the Tenth that: "The powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it
to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people."]

I'd be pretty sure that "destruction" means "as with a bomb", not your
typical highway accident or plane crash.

>>Espionage
>>Arson of federal property (watch those campfires in the Natl. forests)

Arson is most likely deliberate arson, again not accidents (but I'd sure
like to see the actual text of the bill, whatever it is).

Probably letter bombs and the like.

Treason: The offence of *attempting* by overt act to overthrow the
         government, or (Art. III section 3 US Constitution), "only
         in levying war against them [the States], or in adhering

Well, maybe you got a point.

I'm a big alarmist (I outmass most of my friends :-), but you are correct.
This stuff doesn't go away by wishful thinking, nor when you close your eyes.

             by Milton Mayer. (1955, U. of Chicago Press).

(excerpts from an earlier posting)

     "What no one seemed to notice, ... was the ever widening gap
      ... between the government and the people. ... And it became
      always wider. ...

     "... the whole process of its coming into being, was above all
      *diverting*. It provided an excuse not to think for people who
      did not want to think anyway. ...  Nazism gave us some dreadful,
      fundamental things to think about ... and kept us so busy with
      continuous changes and 'crises' and so fascinated ... by the
      machinations of the 'national enemies,' without and within,
      that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that
      were growing, little by little, all around us. ...

     "Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained
      or, on occasion, 'regretted,' that ...  unless one understood
      what the whole thing was in principle, what all these 'little
      measures' ... must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing
      from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. ...

     "... Each act ... is worse than the last, but only a little worse.
      You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great
      shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock
      comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don't want
      to act, or even talk, alone; you don't want to 'go out of your
      way to make trouble.' ... And it is not just fear ... that
      restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

     "... And you *are* an alarmist. You are saying that *this* must
      lead to *this*, and you can't prove it. ...

     "But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or
      thousands will join with you, never comes. *That's* the
      difficulty. ...

     "... The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the
      houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the
      concerts, the cinema, the holidays.  But the spirit, which you
      never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying
      it with the forms, is changed.  Now you live in a world of hate
      and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it
      themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. ...

     "... You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years
      ago, a year ago, things that your father ... could not have imagined.

    SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF NATIONAL DRUG AND CRIME EMERGENCY.

    (a) FINDINGS.--The Congress makes the following findings:

         (1) Next to preserving the national security, protecting the
         personal security of individual Americans, especially
         children, by enacting and enforcing laws against criminal
         behavior is the most important single function of government.

         (2) The criminal justice system in America is failing to
         achieve this basic objective of protecting the innocent and
         punishing the guilty.

         (3) Reform is needed to ensure that criminals are held
         accountable for their actions, that they receive swift and
         certain punishment commensurate with their crimes, and that
         the protection of innocent citizens takes priority over other
         objectives.

         (4) The principle of individual accountability should also
         dictate policies with respect to drug users.  Users should
         face a high probability of apprehension and prosecution, and
         those found guilty should face absolutely certain measured
         response penalties.

         (5) According to the Uniform Crime Reports issued in 1989 by
         the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), violent crime
         known to law enforcement reached an unprecedented high in
         1988.  A violent crime occurred ever 20 seconds.

         (6) The Department of Justice estimates that 83 percent of
         Americans will be victimized by violent crime during their
         lifetime.

         (7) The Federal Bureau of Investigation reports that violent
         crime in America rose by 23 percent during the period
         1984-1988.

         (8) The National Drug Control Strategy reports that in
         certain large cities more than 80 percent of the men arrested
         have tested positive for illegal drug use.

         (9) According to the Department of Justice, the total number
         of Federal and State prisoners grew by 90 percent from 1980
         to 1988.  The growth rate of the total prison population
         during the first 6 months of 1989 exceeded the largest annual
         increase ever recorded in 64 years of recordkeeping.  The
         6-month growth rate translates to a need of almost 1,800
         additional prison beds per week.

         (10) In 1985, 19 States reported the early release of nearly
         19,000 prisoners in an effort to control prison populations,
         according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

         (11) According to the United States Bureau of Justice
         Statistics, 63 percent of State inmates were rearrested for a
         serious crime within 3 years of their discharge from prison.

         (12) The criminal justice system is overloaded and does not
         deliver swift and certain penalties for violating the law.
         In America today, there exists crime without punishment.
         Such conditions imperil the public safety, jeopardize the
         rule of law and undermine the preservation of order in the
         community.

    (b) DECLARATION OF NATIONAL DRUG AND CRIME EMERGENCY.--(1) Guided by
         the principles that energized and sustained the mobilization
         for World War II, and in order to remove violent criminals
         from the streets and meet the extraordinary threat that is
         posed to the Nation by the use and trafficking of illegal
         drugs, the Congress declares the existence of a National Drug
         and Crime Emergency beginning on the date of enactment of
         this Act and ending on the date that is 5 years after the
         date of enactment of this Act.

         (2) During the National Drug and Crime Emergency declared in
         paragraph (1), it shall be the policy of the United States
         that--

              (A) every person who is convicted in a Federal
              court of a crime of violence against a person or a
              drug trafficking felony (other than simple
              possession) shall be sentenced to and shall serve a
              full term of no less than 5 years' imprisonment
              without release;

              (B) prisoners may be housed in tents, and other
              temporary facilities may be utilized, consistent
              with security requirements; and

              (C) the Federal courts may limit or place a "cap"
              on the inmate population level of a Federal or
              State prison or jail only when an inmate proves
              that crowding has resulted in cruel and unusual
              punishment of the plaintiff inmate and no other
              remedy exists.

    SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

    For the purposes of this Act--

         (1) the term "crime of violence against a person" means a
         Federal offense that is a felony and--

              (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
              threatened use of physical force against the person
              or property of another; or

              (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk
              that physical force against the person or property
              of another may be used in the course of committing
              the offense; and

              (C) for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10
              years or more is prescribed by law; and

         (2) the term "drug trafficking crime," (other than simple
         possession) means any felony punishable under the Controlled
         Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled
         Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.) or
         the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. 1901 et
         seq.), other than a felony constituting a simple possession
         of a controlled substance for which the maximum term of
         imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law.

               TITLE I--ELIMINATION OF CRIME WITHOUT PUNISHMENT

            Subtitle A--National Drug and Crime Emergency Policies

    SEC. 101. JUDICIAL REMEDIES FOR PRISON CROWDING.

    (a) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this section is to provide for reasonable
    and proper enforcement of the eighth amendment.

    (b) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that--

         (1) the Federal courts are unreasonably endangering the
         community by sweeping prison and jail cap orders as a remedy
         for detention conditions that they hold are in conflict with
         the eighth amendment; and

         (2) eighth amendment holdings frequently are unjustified
         because of the absence of a plaintiff inmate who has proven
         that detention conditions inflict cruel and unusual
         punishment of that inmate.

    (c) AMENDMENT OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.--(1) Subchapter C of
         chapter 229 of part 2 of title 18, United States Code, is
         amended by adding at the end thereof the following new
         section:

              "Section 3626.  Appropriate remedies with respect
                        to prison crowding.

              "(a)(1) During the period of the National Drug and
              Crime Emergency, a Federal court shall not hold
              prison or jail crowding unconstitutional under the
              eighth amendment except to the extent that an
              individual plaintiff proves that the crowding
              causes the infliction of cruel and unusual
              punishment of that inmate.

              "(2) The relief in a case described in paragraph
              (1) shall extend no further than necessary to
              remove the conditions that are causing the cruel

         SEIZURE.--Evidence which is obtained as a result of a search
         or seizure shall not be excluded in a proceeding in a court of
         the United States on the ground that the search or seizure

         of the United States, if the search or seizure was carried
         out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable
         belief that it was in conformity with the fourth amendment.
         The fact that evidence was obtained pursuant to and within

         of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by a
         statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant
         to statutory authority.

         State court fails to raise a claim in State proceedings at
         the time or in the manner required by State rules of
         procedure, the claim shall not be entertained in an
         application for a writ of habeas corpus unless actual
         prejudice resulted to the applicant from the alleged denial
         of Federal right asserted and--

              "(1) the failure to raise the claim properly or to
              have it heard in State proceedings was the result
              of State action in violation of the Constitution or
              laws of the United States;

              "(2) the Federal right asserted was newly
              recognized by the Supreme Court subsequent to the
              procedural default and is retroactively applicable;
              or

              "(3) the factual predicate of the claim could not
              have been discovered through the exercise of
              reasonable diligence prior to the procedural
              default.

         "(e) A one-year period of limitation shall apply to an
         application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in
         custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.  The
         limitation period shall run from the latest of the following
         times:

              "(1) the time at which State remedies are
              exhausted;

              "(2) the time at which the impediment to filing an
              application created by State action in violation to
              the Constitution or laws of the United States is
              removed, where the applicant was prevented from
              filing by such State action;

              "(3) the time at which the Federal right asserted
              was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,
              where the right has been newly recognized by the
              Court and is retroactively applicable; or

              "(4) the time at which the factual predicate of the
              claim or claims presented could have been
              discovered through the exercise of reasonable
              diligence.".

    (b) APPEAL.--Section 2253 of title 28, United States Code, is amended
    to read as follows:

         "Section 2253. Appeal

         "In a habeas corpus proceeding or a proceeding under section
         2255 of this title before a circuit or district judge, the
         final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the
         court of appeals for the circuit where the proceeding is had.

         "There shall be no right of appeal from such an order in a
         proceeding to test the validity of a warrant to remove, to
         another district or place for commitment or trial, a person
         charged with a criminal offense against the United States, or
         to test the validity of the person's detention pending
         removal proceedings.

         "An appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the
         final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention
         complained of arises out of process issued by a State court,
         or from the final order in a proceeding under section 2255 of
         this title, unless a circuit justice or judge issues a
         certificate of probable cause.".

    (c) APPELLATE PROCEDURE.--Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate
    Procedure is amended to read as follows:

         "Rule 22. Habeas Corpus and Section 2255 Proceedings

         "(a) APPLICATION FOR AN ORIGINAL WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS.--An
         application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made to the
         appropriate district court.  If application is made to a
         circuit judge, the application will ordinarily be transferred
         to the appropriate district court.  If an application is made
         to or transferred to the district court and denied, renewal
         of the application before a circuit judge is not favored; the
         proper remedy is by appeal to the court of appeals from the
         order of the district court denying the writ.

         "(b) NECESSITY OF CERTIFICATE OF PROBABLE CAUSE FOR
         APPEAL.--In a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention
         complained of arises out of process issued by a State court,
         and in a motion proceeding pursuant to section 2255 of title
         28, United States Code, an appeal by the applicant or movant
         may not proceed unless a circuit judge issues a certificate
         of probable cause.  If a request for a certificate of
         probable cause is addressed to the court of appeals, it shall
         be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be
         considered by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems
         appropriate.  If no express request for a certificate is
         filed, the notice of appeal shall be deemed to constitute a
         request addressed to the judgements of the court of appeals.
         If an appeal is taken by a State or the government or its
         representative, a certificate of probable cause is not
         required.".

    (d) STATE CUSTODY.--Section 2254 of title 28, United States Code, is
    amended--

         (1) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:

              "(b) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in
              behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the
              judgment of a State court shall not be granted
              unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted
              the remedies available in the courts of the State,
              or that there is either an absence of available
              State corrective process or the existence of
              circumstances rendering such process ineffective to
              protect the rights of the applicant.  An
              application may be denied on the merits
              notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to
              exhausted the remedies available in the courts of
              the States.";

         (2) by redesignating subsection (d), (e), and (f) as
         subsections (e), (f), and (g), respectively;

         (3) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new
         subsection:

              "(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in
              behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the
              judgment of a State court shall not be granted
              with respect to any claim that has been fully and
              fairly adjudicated in State proceedings."; and

         (4) by amending subsection (e), as redesignated by paragraph
         (2), to read as follows:

              "(e) In a proceeding instituted by an application
              for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody
              pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a full
              and fair determination of a factual issue made in
              the case by a State court shall be presumed to be
              correct.  The applicant shall have the burden of
              rebutting this presumption by clear and convincing
              evidence.".

    (e) FEDERAL CUSTODY.--Section 2255 of title 28, United States Code, is
    amended by striking the second paragraph and the penultimate paragraph
    thereof, and by adding at the end thereof the following new paragraphs:

         "When a person fails to raise a claim at the time or in the
         manner required by Federal rules of procedure, the claim
         shall not be entertained in a motion under this section
         unless actual prejudice resulted to the movant from the
         alleged denial of the right asserted and--

              "(1) the failure to raise the claim properly, or to
              have it heard, was the result of governmental
              action in violation of the Constitution or the laws
              of the United States;

              "(2) the right asserted was newly recognized by the
              Supreme Court subsequent to the procedural default
              and is retroactively applicable; or

              "(3) the factual predicate of the claim could not
              have been discovered through the exercise of
              reasonable diligence prior to the procedural
              default.

         "A two-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion
         under this section.  The limitation period shall run from the
         latest of the following times;

              "(1) The time at which the judgment of conviction
              becomes final.

              "(2) The time at which the impediment to making a
              motion created by governmental action in violation
              of the Constitution or laws of the United States is
              removed, where the movant was prevented from making
              a motion by such governmental action.

              "(3) The time at which the right asserted was
              initially recognized by the Supreme Court, where
              the right has been newly recognized by the Court
              and is retroactively applicable.

              "(4) The time at which the factual predicate of the
              claim or claims presented could have been
              discovered through the exercise of reasonable
              diligence.".

              conviction in a Federal court of a felony under
              this title, the court shall compile a list of all
              assets owned by the defendant not subject to
              forfeiture.

              "(B) After the release of a defendant described in
              subparagraph (A), upon request of the Attorney
              General, the court shall required the defendant to
              provide proof that any asset owned by the defendant
              not listed on the list described in subparagraph
              (A) was legally obtained.".

              "(C) In order to prove that a defendant legally
              obtained an asset not listed on the list described
              in subparagraph (A), the defendant shall be
              required to produce documentation of the same
              nature as that required of a taxpayer by the
              Internal Revenue Service.

              "(D) Assets that a defendant does not prove were
              legally obtained under subparagraph (B) may be
              seized by the Attorney General through attachment
              and foreclosure proceedings, and the proceeds of
              such proceedings shall be deposited in the
              Department of Justice's Assets Forfeiture Fund and
              shall be available for transfer to the building and
              facilities account of the Federal prison system.".

    SEC. 154. JURISDICTION OF SPECIAL MASTERS.

    Notwithstanding any other law, a special master appointed to serve in a
    United States court to monitor compliance with a court order, including

    by adding at the end thereof the following new section:

         "(a) The Administrative Office of the United States Courts
         shall annually publish a cumulative report on sentencing by
         United States District Judges.  The report shall be compiled
         for the purpose of enabling the reader to assess criminal
         sentencing patterns among Federal judges and post-sentencing
         treatment to determine judicial accuracy of forecasting
         future responsible and lawful behavior by those whom they
         sentence.

         "(b) The report shall--

              "(1) personally identify the judge that pronounced
              each criminal sentence;

              "(2) give a brief description of the crime or

               TITLE II--ACHIEVING A DRUG-FREE AMERICA BY 1995

    SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--

         (1) to make America drug-free by 1995 requires a concerted
         effort to hold drug users accountable for their actions,
         which sustain the drug trade and related criminal activities;
         and

         (2) the anti-drug policy of the 1990's must emphasize the
         principles of zero tolerance, user accountability, and
         measured user penalties.

    SEC. 202 PAYMENT OF TRIAL COSTS AND MANDATORY MINIMUM FINES.

    (a) FINE TO PAY COST OF TRIAL.--(1) A person who is convicted of a
         violation of section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (21

         the cost of the trial in which the person is convicted, as
         determined by the court, out of the income of such person.

         (2) If a person convicted of drug possession has insufficient
         income and property to pay the cost of trial as required by
         paragraph (1), the court shall determine an appropriate
         amount that should be paid in view of the person's income and
         the cost of trial.

         (3) The amount that a person shall be required to pay out of
         the person's income to pay the cost of trial shall not exceed
         25 percent of the person's annual income.

    (b) ADDITIONAL MANDATORY FINE.--In addition to the fines authorized in
    section 404 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 844) and in
    subsection (a), a person who is convicted of section 404 of the
    Controlled Substances Act shall be assessed a mandatory fine of at
    least 10 percent of the person's income for a first offense and at
    least 25 percent of the person's income for a second or subsequent
    offense.

    (c) INCOME.--For the purposes of this section, a person's annual income
    shall be determined to be no less than the amount of income reported on
    the person's most recent Federal income tax filing.

    (d) FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY.--If a person convicted of a drug crime has
    insufficient income to pay the fines imposed under subsections (a) and

    be subject to forfeiture through attachment, foreclosure, and
    garnishment procedures.

    (e) The court may order payment of trial costs and fines imposed under
    this section in a single payment or in installments, as necessary to

              State educational agency shall, upon request, make
              available to the Secretary and to the public full
              information about the elements of its program.

              "(d)(1) The Secretary shall publish regulations to
                   implement and enforce the provisions of

    SEC. 207. DRUG-FREE TRANSPORTATION.

    (a) SHORT TITLE.--This section may be cited as the 'Transportation
    Employee Testing Act'.

    (b) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that--

         (1) alcohol abuse and illegal drug use pose significant
         dangers to the safety and welfare of the Nation;

         (2) millions of the Nation's citizens utilize transportation
         by aircraft, railroads, trucks, and buses, and depend on the
         operators of aircraft, railroads, trucks, and buses to
         perform in a safe and responsible manner;

         (3) the greatest efforts must be expended to eliminate the
         abuse of alcohol and the use of illegal drugs, whether on or
         off duty, by persons who are involved in the operation of
         aircraft, railroads, trucks, and buses;

         (4) the use of alcohol and illegal drugs has been
         demonstrated to affect significantly the performance of
         persons who use them, and has been proven to have been a
         critical factor in transportation accidents;

         (5) the testing of uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces
         has shown that the most effective deterrent to abuse of
         alcohol and use of illegal drugs is increased testing,
         including random testing;

         (6) adequate safeguards can be implemented to ensure that
         testing for abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs is
         performed in a manner that protects a person's right of
         privacy, ensures that no person is harassed by being treated
         differently from other persons, and ensures that no person's
         reputation or career development is unduly threatened or
         harmed; and

         (7) rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing
         program for abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs, and
         should be made available to persons, as appropriate.

    (C) AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ACT.--(1) Title VI of the Federal
         Aviation Act of 1958 (49 App. U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) is amended
         by adding at the end thereof the following:

              interest of aviation safety, prescribe regulations
              not later than 12 months after the date of
              enactment of this section.  Such regulations shall
              establish a program that requires air carriers and
              foreign air carriers to conduct preemployment,
              reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident
              testing of airmen, crewmembers, airport security
              screening contract personnel, and other air
              carrier employees responsible for safety-sensitive
              functions (as determined by the Administrator) for
              use, in violation of law, of alcohol or a
              controlled substances.  The Administrator may also
              prescribe regulations, as the Administrator
              considers appropriate in the interest of safety,
              for the conduct of periodic recurring testing of
              such employees for such use in violation of law.

              "(2) The Administrator shall establish a program
              applicable to employees of the Federal Aviation
              Administration whose duties include responsibility
              for safety-sensitive functions.  Such programs
              shall provide for preemployment, reasonable
              suspicion, random, an post-accident testing for
              use, in violation of law, of alcohol or a
              controlled substance.  The Administrator may also
              prescribe regulations, as the Administrator
              considers appropriate in the interest of safety,
              for the conduct of periodic testing of such
              employees for such use in violation of law.

              "(3) In prescribing regulations under the programs
              required by this subsection, the Administrator
              shall require, as the Administrator considers
              appropriate, the suspension or revocation of any
              certificate issued to such a person, or the
              disqualification or dismissal of any such person,
              in accordance with this section, in any instance
              where a test conduct and confirmed under this
              section indicates that such person has used, in
              violation of law, alcohol or a controlled
              substance.

                           "PROHIBITION OF SERVICE

              "(b)(1) No person may use, in violation of law,
              alcohol or a controlled substance after the date of
              enactment of this section and serve as an airman,
              crewmember, airport security screening contract
              personnel, air carrier employee responsible for

              Administration with responsibility for
              safety-sensitive functions.

              "(2) No person who is determined to have used, in
              violation of law, alcohol or a controlled substance
              after the date of enactment of this section shall
              serve as an airman, crewmember, airport security
              screening contract personnel, air carrier employee
              responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as
              determined by the Administrator), or employee of
              the Federal Aviation Administration with
              responsibility for safety-sensitive functions
              unless such person has completed a program of
              rehabilitation described in subsection (c).

              "(3) Any such person determined by the
              Administrator to have used, in violation of law,
              alcohol or a controlled substance after the date of
              enactment of this section who--

                   "(A) engaged in such use while on duty;

                   "(B) prior to such use had undertaken or
                   completed a rehabilitation program
                   described in subsection (c) of this
                   section;

                   "(C) following such determination refuses
                   to undertake such rehabilitation program;

                   "(D) following such determination fails
                   to complete such a rehabilitation
                   program,

              shall not be permitted to perform the duties
              relating to air transportation which such person
              performed prior to the date of such determination.

                         "PROGRAM FOR REHABILITATION

              "(c)(1) The Administrator shall prescribe
              regulations setting forth requirements for
              rehabilitation programs which at a minimum provide
              for the identification and opportunity for
              treatment of employees referred to in subsection
              (a)(1) in need of assistance in resolving problems
              with the use, in violation of law, of alcohol or
              controlled substances.  Each air carrier or foreign
              air carrier is encouraged to make such a program
              available to all of its employees in addition to
              those employees referred to in subsection (a)(1).
              The Administrator shall determine the circumstances
              under which such employees shall be required to
              participate in such a program.  Nothing in this
              subsection shall preclude any air carrier or
              foreign air carrier from establishing a program
              under this subsection in cooperation with any other
              air carrier or foreign air carrier.

              "(2) The Administrator shall establish and maintain
              a rehabilitation program which at a minimum

              subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator
              shall development requirements which shall--

                   "(1) promote, to the maximum extent
                   practicable, individual privacy in the
                   collection of specimen samples;

                        substances testing and
                        laboratory procedures to be
                        applied in carrying out this
                        section, including standards
                        that require the use of the
                        best available technology for

                   involved in the controlled substances
                   testing of any person under this section
                   shall have the capability and facility,
                   at such laboratory, of performing
                   screening and confirmation tests;

                   "(4) provide that all tests that indicate
                   the use, in violation of law, of alcohol
                   or a controlled substance by any person
                   shall be confirmed by a scientifically
                   recognized method of testing capable of
                   providing quantitative data regarding
                   alcohol or a controlled substance;

                   "(5) provide that each specimen sample be
                   subdivided, secured, and labeled in the
                   presence of the tested person and that a
                   portion thereof be retained in a secure
                   manner to prevent the possibility of
                   tampering, so that if the person's
                   confirmation test results are positive
                   the person has an opportunity to have the
                   retained portion assayed by a
                   confirmation test done independently at a
                   second certified laboratory if the person
                   requests the independent test within 3
                   days after being advised of the results
                   of the confirmation test;

                   "(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for
                   testing to detect and quantify alcohol in
                   breath and body fluid samples, including
                   urine and blood, through the development
                   of regulations as may be necessary and in
                   consultation with the Department of
                   Health and Human Services;

                   "(7) provide for the confidentiality of
                   test results and medical information
                   (other than information relating to
                   alcohol or a controlled substance) of
                   employees, except that this paragraph
                   shall not preclude the use of test
                   results for the orderly imposition of
                   appropriate sanctions under this section;
                   and

                   "(8) ensure that employees are selected
                   for tests by nondiscriminatory and
                   impartial methods, so that no employee is
                   harassed by being treated differently
                   from other employees in similar
                   circumstances.

                    "EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS

              "(e)(1) No State or local government shall adopt or
              have in effect any law, rule, regulation,
              ordinance, standard, or order that is inconsistent
              with the regulations promulgated under this
              section, except that the regulations promulgated
              under this section shall not be construed to
              preempt provisions of State criminal law which
              impose sanctions for reckless conduct leading to
              actual loss of life, injury, or damage to property,
              whether the provisions apply specifically to
              employees of an air carrier or foreign air carrier
              or to the general public.

              "(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to
              restrict the discretion of the Administrator to
              continue in force, amend, or further supplement any
              regulations issued before the date of enactment of
              this section that govern the use of alcohol and
              controlled substances by airmen, crewmembers,
              airport security screening contract personnel, air
              carrier employees responsible for safety-sensitive
              functions (as determined by the Administrator), or

    (d) AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL RAILROAD SAFETY ACT.--Section 202 of the
    Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431) is amended by
    adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:

         "(r)(1) In the interest of safety, the Secretary shall, not
         later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this
         subsection, issue rules, regulations, standards, and orders
         relating to alcohol and drug use in railroad operations.
         Such regulations shall establish a program which--

              "(A) requires railroads to conduct preemployment,

              testing of all railroad employees responsible for
              safety-sensitive functions (as determined by the
              Secretary) for use, in violation of law, of alcohol
              or a controlled substance;

              "(B) requires, as the Secretary considers
              appropriate, disqualification for an established
              period of time or dismissal of any employee
              determined to have used or to have been impaired by
              alcohol while on duty; and

         The Secretary may also issue rules, regulations, standards,
         and orders, as the Secretary considers appropriate in the
         interest of safety, requiring railroads to conduct periodic
         testing of railroad employees responsible for such safety
         sensitive functions, for use of alcohol or a controlled
         substance in violation of law.  Nothing in this subsection
         shall be construed to restrict the discretion of the
         Secretary to continue in force, amend, or further supplement
         any rules, regulations, standards, and orders governing the
         use of alcohol and controlled substances in railroad
         operations issued before the date of enactment of this
         subsection.

         "(2) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall
         develop requirements which shall--

              1988, and any amendments thereto, including
              mandatory guidelines which--

                   "(i) establish comprehensive standards
                   for all aspects of laboratory controlled
                   substances testing and laboratory
                   procedures to be applied in carrying out
                   this subsection, including standards that
                   require the use of the best available
                   technology for ensuring the full
                   reliability and accuracy of controlled
                   substances tests and strict procedures
                   governing the chain of custody of
                   specimen samples collected for controlled
                   substances testing;

                   "(ii) establish the minimum list of
                   controlled substances for which persons
                   may be tested; and

                   "(iii) establish appropriate standards
                   and procedures for periodic review of
                   laboratories and criteria for
                   certification and revocation of
                   certification of laboratories to perform
                   controlled substances testing in carrying
                   out this subsection;

              "(C) require that all laboratories involved in the
              controlled substances testing of any employee under
              this subsection shall have the capability and
              facility, at such laboratory, of performing
              screening and confirmation tests;

              "(D) provide that all tests which indicate the use,
              in violation of law, of alcohol or a controlled
              substance by any employee shall be confirmed by a
              scientifically recognized method of testing capable
              of providing quantitative data regarding alcohol or
              a controlled substance;

              "(E) provide that each specimen sample be
              subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of
              the tested person and that a portion thereof be
              retained in a secure manner to prevent the
              possibility of tampering, so that in the event the
              person's confirmation test results are positive the
              person has an opportunity to have the retained
              portion assayed by a confirmation test done
              independently at a second certified laboratory if
              the person requests the independent test within 3
              days after being advised of the results of the
              confirmation test;

              "(F) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to
              detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body
              fluid samples, including urine and blood, through
              the development of regulations as may be necessary
              and in consultation with the Department of Health
              and Human Services;

              "(G) provides for the confidentiality of test
              results and medical information (other than
              information relating to alcohol or a controlled
              substance) of employees, except that the provisions
              of this subparagraph shall not preclude the use of
              test results for the orderly imposition of
              appropriate sanctions under this subsection; and

              "(H) ensure that employees are selected for tests
              by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that
              no employee is harassed by being treated
              differently from other employees in similar
              circumstances.

         "(3) The Secretary shall issue rules, regulations, standards,
         or orders setting forth requirements for rehabilitation
         programs which at a minimum provide for the identification
         and opportunity for treatment of railroad employees
         responsible for safety-sensitive functions (as determined by
         the Secretary) in need of assistance in resolving problems
         with the use, in violation of law, of alcohol or a controlled
         substance.  Each railroad is encouraged to make such a
         program available to all of its employees in addition to
         those employees responsible for safety-sensitive functions.
         The Secretary shall determine the circumstances under which
         such employees shall be required to participate in such
         program.  Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a railroad
         from establishing a program under this paragraph in
         cooperation with any other railroad.

         "(4) In carrying out the provisions of this subsection, the
         Secretary shall establish requirements that are consistent
         with the international obligations of the United States, and
         the Secretary shall take into consideration any applicable
         laws and regulations of foreign countries.

         "(5) For the purposes of this subsection, the term
         'controlled substance' means any substance under section
         102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6))
         specified by the Secretary.".

              shall establish a program which requires motor
              carriers to conduct preemployment, reasonable
              suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of the
              operators of commercial motor vehicles for use, in
              violation of law, of alcohol or a controlled
              substance.  The Secretary may also issue
              regulations, as the Secretary considers appropriate
              in the interest of safety, for the conduct of
              periodic testing of such operations for such use in
              violation of law.

                   accidents involving bodily injury or
                   significant property damage.

                   "(2) TESTING AS PART OF MEDICAL
                   EXAMINATION.--Nothing in subsection (a)
                   shall preclude the Secretary from
                   providing in such regulations that such
                   testing be conducted as part of the
                   medical examination required by subpart E
                   of part 391 of title 49, Code of Federal
                   Regulations, with respect to operators of
                   commercial motor vehicles to whom such
                   part is applicable.

              shall issue regulations setting forth requirements
              for rehabilitation programs which provide for the
              identification and opportunity for treatment of
              operators of commercial motor vehicles who are
              determined to have used, in violation of law or
              Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled
              substance.  The Secretary shall determine the
              circumstances under which such operators shall be
              required to participate in such program.  Nothing
              in this subsection shall preclude a motor carrier
              from establishing a program under this subsection
              in cooperation with any other motor carrier.

              "(d) PROCEDURES FOR TESTING.--In establishing the
              program required under subsection (a) of this

                   of test results for the orderly
                   imposition of appropriate sanctions under
                   this section; and

                   "(8) ensure that employees are selected
                   for tests by nondiscriminatory and
                   impartial methods, so that no employee is

                   of tests conducted and confirmed under
                   this section, to have used, in violation
                   of law or Federal regulation, alcohol or
                   a controlled substance but are not under
                   the influence of alcohol or a controlled
                   substance as provide in this title.

         "(g) DEFINITION.--(1) For the purposes of this section, the

         "SEC. 26. (a) REGULATIONS.--The Secretary shall, in the
         interest of mass transportation safety, issue regulations
         within 12 months after the date of enactment of this section.
         Such regulations shall establish a program which requires
         each recipient of assistance under this Act to conduct
         preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and postaccident
         testing of the operators of mass transportation vehicles for
         use, in violation of law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or
         a controlled substance.  The Secretary may also issue
         regulations, as the Secretary considers appropriate in the
         interest of safety, for the conduct of periodic recurring
         testing of such operators for such use in violation of law or
         Federal regulation.

         "(b) POSTACCIDENT TESTING.--In issuing such regulations, the
         Secretary shall require that postaccident testing of the
         operator of a mass transportation vehicle be conducted in the
         case of any accident involving a mass transportation vehicle
         in which occurs loss of human life, or, as determined by the

         significant property damage.

         "(c) PROGRAM FOR REHABILITATION.--The Secretary shall issue
         regulations setting forth requirements for rehabilitation

         for treatment of operators of mass transportation vehicles
         who are determined to have used, in violation of law or
         Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance.  The
         Secretary shall determine the circumstances under which such
         operators shall be required to participate in such a program.
         Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a recipient from
         establishing a program under this subsection in cooperation
         with any other recipient.

         "(d) PROCEDURES FOR TESTING.--In establishing the program
         required under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary
         shall develop requirements which shall--

              scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11,
              1988, and any subsequent amendments thereto,
              including mandatory guidelines which--

                   "(A) establish comprehensive standards
                   for all aspects of laboratory controlled
                   substances testing and laboratory
                   procedures to be applied in carrying out
                   this section, including standards which
                   require the use of the best available
                   technology for ensuring the full
                   reliability and accuracy of controlled
                   substances tests and strict procedures
                   governing the chain of custody of
                   specimen samples collected for controlled
                   substances testing;

                   "(B) establish the minimum list of
                   controlled substances for which
                   individuals may be tested; and

                   "(C) establish appropriate standards and
                   procedures for periodic review of
                   laboratories and criteria for
                   certification and revocation of
                   certification of laboratories to perform
                   controlled substances testing in carrying
                   out this section;

              "(3) require that all laboratories involved in the
              testing of any individual under this section shall
              have the capability and facility, at such
              laboratory, of performing screening and
              confirmation tests;

              "(4) provide that all tests which indicate the use,
              in violation of law or Federal regulation, of
              alcohol or a controlled substance by any individual
              shall be confirmed by a scientifically recognized
              method of testing capable of providing quantitative

              "(5) provide that each specimen sample be
              subdivided, secured, and labeled in the presence of
              the tested individual and that a portion thereof be
              retained in a secure manner to prevent the
              possibility of tampering, so that in the event the
              individual's confirmation test results are positive
              the individual has an opportunity to have the
              retained portion assayed by a confirmation test
              done independently at a second certified laboratory
              if the individual requests the independent test
              within 3 days after being advised of the results of
              the confirmation test;

              "(6) ensure appropriate safeguards for testing to
              detect and quantify alcohol in breath and body
              fluid samples, including urine and blood, through
              the development of regulations as may be necessary
              and in consultation with the Department of Health
              and Human Services;

              "(7) provide for the confidentiality of test
              results and medical information (other than
              information relating to alcohol or a controlled
              substance) of employees, except that the provisions
              of this paragraph shall not preclude the use of
              test results for the orderly imposition of
              appropriate sanctions under this section; and

              "(8) ensure that employees are selected for tests
              by nondiscriminatory and impartial methods, so that
              no employee is harassed by being treated
              differently from other employees in similar
              circumstances.

         "(e) EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.--

              "(1) STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND REGULATIONS.--No State
              or local government shall adopt or have in effect
              any law, rule, regulation, ordinance, standard, or
              order that is inconsistent with the regulations
              issued under this section, except that the
              regulations issued under this section shall not be
              construed to preempt provisions of State criminal

              leading to actual loss of life, injury, or damage
              to property.

              "(2) OTHER REGULATIONS ISSUED BY
              SECRETARY.--Nothing in this section shall be
              construed to restrict the discretion of the
              Secretary to continue in force, amend, or further
              supplement any regulations governing the use of
              alcohol or controlled substances by mass
              transportation employees issued before the date of
              enactment of this section.

              "(3) INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.--In issuing

              only establish requirements that are consistent
              with the international obligations of the United
              States, and the Secretary shall take into

              "(2) DETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS.--The Secretary
              shall determine appropriate sanctions for mass
              transportation vehicle operators who are
              determined, as a result of tests conducted and
              confirmed under this section, to have used, in
              violation of law or Federal regulation, alcohol or
              a controlled substance but are not under the
              influence of alcohol or a controlled substance as

    Editor's Comment: Well, I hope you enjoyed the first issue. I have no
    reason to believe that there will not be many more to come. I am sorry if
    this issue is a somewhat large. We had so much information, that we just
    had to pack it in. The Rivendell BBS will be up as of May 1, 1991. We are
    not sure of the number yet, but as soon as we find out, we will post it on
    the current Rivendell BBS. (713) 481-3448. Please do not call this number
    after May 1. I would like to extend my special thanks to Homer Mandrill for
    that exclusive editorial and to the dudes at Beer*Net for the input. I hope
    all of you are as happy with the first issue as I am. I would love nothing
    more than to hear from our readers. Please write, call the BBS, or drop me
    a line on Internet. All mailing/calling info is at the top of the magazine.
    This issue came out almost two months early. I thought it would be hell to
    do, but it was smooth as it could have ever been. But, send in those
    articles and editorials. I will fit them in somewhere. Please state if you
    would like to remain anonymous, use your handle, or real name. We will give
    you the courtesy of any option you desire. Many thanks to the guys at NIA
    for the plug. Keep on Rockin JD & LM! Well, thats the show, and I'm outta
    here.
