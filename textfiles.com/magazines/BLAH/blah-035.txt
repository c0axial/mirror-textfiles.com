        Some issues back, fellow BLaHster Chessman introduced the Twit of
the Month, an award given to only the most obnoxious and pathetic of BBS
vermin.  Well, I'd like to introduce the September Twit, a chap who goes
by the name "Rex".  Rex hangs out on a certain Southwest Florida public-
domain wasteland that shall remain nameless, not to protect it, but in
the hopes that it sinks into eternal obscurity...
        In order to find the perfect Twit, I logged onto the aforementioned
dating board as "Sandra", a perfectly-figured redhead who, as I wrote in
the on-line questionaire, "loves to FUCK and oter [sic] wild stuff with
whipped cream and vegetable oil!".  Then, feeling thankful for sysops who
give instant access, I cruised the chat channel for grazing twits.
        This is actually more of an indictment of "Dial-Your-Match" boards
and the idiots that call them than any individual lamer.  We're dealing
with entire groups of balding, horny men who think single women infinitely
more attractive then themselves are not only going to spend their free
evenings calling these boards, but are going to be incredibly turned on by
drooling spuds dragging them into chat mode and telling them how long their
willies are.  And they NEVER learn, no matter how many times you make idiots
out of them.
        And YOU thought k-rad boards were dangerous!

p/416  Oh, yeah!  I love your weewee!           <--And he STILL doesn't get
                                                   it.

---Chuckie 112 has left chat mode---

[what, doesn't it turn him on when you talk dirty, conn? --gweedagain]

(Rex 416):  /ptake my cock baby I'm cummminggg  <--Typed with one finger,
                                                   long pause followed.

Rex?  Did you achieve orgasm?

(Rex 416):  That was great, Sandy!  Wanna go voice?

That's SANDRA, you cheap bastard.

(Rex 416):  HUH?

Smile, Rexy-poo.  You're on BLaH camera.        <--Smile!

(Rex 416):  Whts blah?

An organization dedicated to eliminating vermin like yourself from the face
of the earth.  In mere days, a text file containing this entire conversation
will be circulated across the globe, so all REAL bbs users can see what a
gullible schmuck you are.  By the way, you're also a sexist pig and you come
WAY too soon.

(Rex 416):  FUCK YOU BITCH                      <--What a guy!

I don't think you get the point.                <--Ending our sad chronicle.

[connie.. that's not all he doesn't get..--gweed]

---------

        And I didn't even get the chance to tell him that he's our monthly        
Twit!  A few threatening letters to "Sandra's" mailbox followed, then
nothing.  Not even a "thank-you" note.
