        Being both a great supporter of the political process as well as
an equal-opportunity offender, I've jotted down a couple of new lists to
help you with your voting decision in the upcoming election.  That's right--
the new pussy lists.


                Why Republicans are Pussies
10.  See the BLaH file, "Why Christian Fundementalists are Pussies".  Pretty
   much the same folks.
9.  Family values are no fun.  Not the right-wing's, anyway.
8.  Who would you rather listen to on the radio, Rush Limbaugh or Kevin 
  Matthews?
7.  The REST of Rush Limbaugh.
6.  Read my lips-- same old promises.
5.  Liberty and Justice for Oil.
4.  I don't remember #4.
3.  My attourney advises me not to comment on #3.
2.  Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Quayle-- what a legacy!
1.  Jesse Helms, Jeffrey Dahmer, Adolf Hitler (now living in California),
  and Satan (ditto) are all registered Republicans.

                Why Democrats are Pussies
10.  Jesse Jackson and the one-color Rainbow Coalition.
9.  Loafers and cappucino are passe.
8.  "Thirtysomething".
7.  Remember Dukakis in the tank?
6.  Acid flashbacks impede political decision-making.
5.  "I didn't inhale"-- see #6, above.
4.  That wild-and-crazy Kennedy Klan.
3.  No affirmative action for poor WHITE people.
2.  BLaH is not politically correct.
1.  Voting Democrat means Bill Clinton which means Al Gore which means
  Tipper Gore and we don't want THAT again, do we?

        On a more serious note, droogs, (all Serious Notes are in the c-flat
range), if you're of voting age, PLEASE VOTE.  Sure, all the candidates this
time around are morons.  Know why?  Because the people who can make a real
difference in the system aren't getting the support they need, and the whacko
extremists on both wings gain power by the hour due to voter apathy.  If we
all GET INVOLVED (exactly what the fascists DON'T want us to do) and pull
together, we can make a difference.  It only takes a few minutes to register,
and the country you save may be your own.
        And while you're at it, make a few prank phone calls to Pat
Robertson.  He's lonely.
