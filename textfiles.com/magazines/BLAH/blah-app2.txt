Ok, this should be relatively painless. No k-rad-i-k00l .EXE files that
make encrypted data files to deal with. No nifty telegard .ASW files to
go through. Simple questions, followed by a blood oath of loyalty <you
can mail in the vial to the BLaH P.O. Box. Extra points given to those
who include at least one other vital fluid>. If you've read the BLaH
files, you'll know what kind of answer to type below. If not, I'm sure
the Watchtower could use a few freelancers..

Handle :

City   :

State  :

Where we can get in touch with you :
<prefer voice #, or board you call
a lot, preferably a BLaH site>

Why you want to join BLaH :

{--Thanks for applying to BLaH--}

Further Demands : Upload this file to a BLaH <sigh>t near you. Current
ones are listed below and hopefully there will be more. use PKZIP
<whatever version> to make an archive called "BLAHXXXX.ZIP" where XXXX
is your favorite four letter word or combination of random letters
<ASDF, etc>. The archive should contain this completed file and your
accompanying submission. The BLaH Prezs well review your literary
submission and let you know if you're a BLaH Prez. If we don't like it,
we'll just ignore it. Thanks for playing the game of the ego.

For sysops who would like to be BLaH <sigh>ts, just ask a BLaH member
and you'll probably become one instantly. You'll get s-krut N-f0 and a
mention in the propaganda section of every BLaH release.

                Good luck
