        Hey!  You, there!  Yes, you, with the dark glasses and the "I Heart
The Illuminati/I Club Eris" lapel button!  Are you sick of the Kennedy
assassination yet?  Does your nose curl when someone starts rambling about
the "magic bullet" theory?  Do you fly into a homicidal rage when some schmuck
insists on explaining his personal ideas (it was the post office!) for the
eightieth time?
        Hang on to your hats, kids!  Here it comes again!
        
        It's the limited edition Kennedy Assassination Chess Set.

        For the low-low price of of only $89.99 a month (plus $200/month
shipping and handling), the Franklin Mint will send you a new piece every
month until the year 3842.  Each piece comes with a certificate of 
authenticity, signed and numbered by sculptor Fnord William Shea.
        Just look at these beautiful, hand-painted masterpieces!  The
spray of pewter blood from J.F.K's demolished skull, the anatomically
correct splatter of brains on Jackie's pillbox hat, Governor Connoly's pants
soiled with real barium, and the perfectly reproduced rifles in Oswald's hand
(with opposite-pointing shadows!)
        You couldn't possibly find a more tasteful and distinctive addition
to your home decor, and if you order NOW you'll recieve a handsome Grassy
Knoll playing board to showcase your pieces.  Just think of what your friends
will say...
        "I wish >I< had a Kennedy Assassination Chess Set!"
        "Teddy Kennedy is a bishop?"
        "Wow!  Those splattered brains look so REAL!"
        "The barium is so tasty!"
        "Is that Ted Nugent over there?"
        "No, that's Newt Gingrich.. Ted's behind Cthulhu"

        Order today.  Dial 1-800-JFK-DEAD.  Visa, Mastercharge and
American Excess accepted, offer void in the event of Bob's second
coming.
