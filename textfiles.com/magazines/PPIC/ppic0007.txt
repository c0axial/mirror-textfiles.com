                               PRESENTS:
                           Anarchy @ School (#1)

Lets start out more advanced then in issue 4 of PPiC (how to fuk with your
school non-electronically).

First step, steal an alkaline from chem class.  It really doesn't matter
which one.  Lets just use Lithium for our example.
Go to a drinking fountain, rip out the grating (piece of metal with all
the holes in it) and place a small cup in it.  Inside the cup place the
alkaline.  When some one goes ot use th drinking fountain, BOOM Big
explosion.

Now go to the computer lab.  Most high schools probably still have some
Apple II's or something laying around.  many teachers use them for grading
purposes. but your flunking out right? Spend all your time on bbs's, forget
to do your Homework, Etc?  Well, lift up the little black thing in the
center of the disk drive, stick your finger in, till you hit something.
This something is probably either the device that holds the disk or the
Disk drive head.  Puch down on it really hard till you hear a snap.
Now you have destroyed the computer. If you wanna destroy the grades disk
also shove gum and powdered sugar in it. Or any other things you can find
Laying around. I big mud pie always helps disks last longer.. Hehehehe.

Another fun thing to do if the computers are all on a network. go to the
main server, pull all cords out of the back. Crash the computer, Format
the disk drive, It really doesn't matter, Just wreak havoc.

While walking ot the main server be sure to cut or rip every single thing
that is sticking out of the ports.

Now if they have some Macs.. Well, since macs are useless and not even good
for games, go out and rip off a copy of softwindows. And also get a program
that quits the finder (I think its called quit finder) While your at it get
folder bolt.  Install softwindows on all the computers, make sure to put
it in the startup folder, then folder bolt everything! Lock every single file
EXPECIALLY the startup folder.  Install "quit finder" after softwindows
starts. Now all the macs they have will boot into softwindows, Every file is
bolted shut and I don't think they can exit softwindows.  If they still can,
install At ease, have NOTHINg in the at ease folder accept softwindows. no
menu options And be sure to folder bolt all of At ease's files..

SO to recap, Since that might of got confusing:

Step 1: Get Folder bolt, Quit finder, Softwindows, and At Ease.

Step 2: Install all of the above, keep Softwindows and quit finder in the
        startup folder.

Step 3: TAke all items out of At Ease except for Softwindows.

Step 4: Folder Bolt EVER directory. It makes everything read only.

Step 5: Sit Back and laugh a little.

Results from following the above steps:

They now have windows for Mac, if they exit it somehow, Then all they can do
is go back into Softwindows. If they try to bypass it anyway, they've all
been blocked, all they can do is format the HD. hehehe

Well, Thats about all for right now. I'll add another installment in this
collection on was to cause problems at school.. Just in time for when they
let you back into the school..
