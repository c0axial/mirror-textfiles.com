                               PRESENTS:
                          How to Piss a Sysop Off

                        By No Name, Assisted by Duck


Its quite easy ot piss any sysop off.. Here is an example.
Log in with someone you hates name, go to the message area and write
a message to "@USER@" and cuss them out, say that this board sux, and
they should never call back again. add more @ codes, name, pw, address,
etc, and be sure to end it with a "@HANGUP@". Also write a post saying
that the bbs is going down and that the sysop is out of town and he asked
you to tell everyone.

Ex. Letter
To: @USER@
FROM: Joe Smith
Subject: The status of this bbs.

I thought I should write to you and tell you that "Joe Blows bbs" is going
to be shut down by the government for kiddie porn. When the fBI came to shut
it down they found a secet area for all the pirated and elite files that
hackers have sent.  to get out of trouble the SysOp is rolling over on
all the users, claiming that you all uploaded the pirated files that he has
in the area. The phone company has given the FBI all of the numbers that
have called in the last few months. And the FBI is setting up a sting.
I am writing this from laptop at a payphone, in hopes of not being caught.

Thank you. PLEASE DO NOT CALL.  You'll be arrested for piracy and no one
wants to be in on that.
@HANGUP@

End of Ex.

Post this message on every board in the state. He'll never get called again!
Then after writing this message, page him for chat. hold down the control
and G keys the entire chat. It'll beep the sysops computer OVER AND OVER!
Press control J about 20 times and scroll the line that says sysop off the
screen. That also tends to piss them off.

If you wanna be a real punk on a wildcat board, and the sysop has his bell
off, change your from line to say @BELL@@BELL@@BELL@@BELL@ And then hit W
from the main menu repeatedly, it'll beep the sysop 4 times each time you
hit W. <Note, all letters must be capital in the @BELL@ command>

Make macros that say "PPPPPPPPPPPPPP" and Ascii send them on the main menu

Go into group chat and Ascii Upload 1 meg text files.. :) OVER AND OVER.
They really love that. It tends to fill up the SysOps HD quite fast.

MORE FUN SHIT:

Everytime you log in, use a different name, Same password, same info, etc.
This causes a hassle for the sysop. He has to go through and delete EVERY
single user that you log in as.

Use @ codes in your from line. use "@MEMO@, @MEMO1@,@MEMO2@" these are used
by the system to store private information that only the sysop can see,
when a user see your name and from line, they'll see all the private info
that they typed to the sysop. And they'll get real PISSED.
Other fun ones are: @PHONE@, @COMPANY@, @PAUSE@@PAUSE@@PAUSE@, @BDATE@,
@FIRST@, @NOSTOP@, Etc. Hehehe


If you wanna write messages as someone else on a tribbs board, Download
an offline mail reader such as OLX.  Write the messages you want in that
but change who it's from. Log in with a fake account, Upload the QWK packet
and really cause some problems.. :)

These are the only things I can think of right now.. As I think of some more
tricks to pull I'll post em.
