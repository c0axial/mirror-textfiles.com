Now lets examine this a minute.  Nick acts like a lamer,
Talks like a lamer. Asks questions like a lamer.
So what could he be? I feel it is best represented by the
following formula:

(LAMER TALK) + (LAMER ACTS) + (LAMER QUESTIONS)/ X = Lamerness
   Always    +    Always    +    Constantly / X    = NICK

I think this equation is better if you count the number of
times in X minutes that each of these things happen.
Now you should do this several times to make sure they are
not just having a lame day.

The Results:
<Results from 3 polls of Nick on seperate days & subjects>
                 +--------+--------+--------+
                 | POLL 1 | POLL 2 | POLL 3 |

These were for 5 minute tests.
Average lamers register about 2-4 on this test
But Nick Seemed to consistantly score REALLY high..
Try this test on anyone. It's not perfect, but I do it
often, Keep scores, dates, etc. loads of fun.. :)
