Enigma's world
--------------
    My World appeals to very few, but the few it appeals to are a strong
bunch.  My world would be a world of anarchy, with its own government and
a hell of a lot more bombs.  We'd drop bombs on neighborhoods, blow up trees,
Kill furry little animals, And use macine guns to hunt deer.  my world would
not be in chaos, It'd just make it where you didn't brek the law over stupid
shit, It'd be a simple society, If you have the urge to blow something up,
and its yours, Go for it. If someone is on your property, Ask them to leave,
if they hassle you, Call up the cops and tell them.  They'll come and blow
the fukr(s) head clean off.  Its as simple as that.

    Elections would still be held, big business would not want money anymore,
They'd just do it to stop from being killed.  If you make more money then is
needed, you'd want to give it away.  Instead of being money hungry, we'd be
pussy fukrs. We wouldn't sit around worrying about taxes, Plenty of free
money sitting around.  Extra earning would go towards Things like paying
good programmers, ansi drawers a pay check. Pirating wold not be illegal
It'd be encouraged, because the more you like a particular programmer the
more he'd earn.

    The System would buck the way things are today, and the change would be
less then instant. Congress would vote it in, Because it'd make sence. As
long as all the computer people around the country voted for me, I'd be a
shoe in to win. I'd reinstate the death penalty, get all the hackers outta
jail, and I'd also free Tax frauders (If they ain't stuck up shits).
no killers or rump riders would be released. :) Or even molesters.
Cuz those people are truely sick faggot assed pricks of people who should
not be in the general public.  Plain and simple.

More on this subject later.  Send mail on what you think.
