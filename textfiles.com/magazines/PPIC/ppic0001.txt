History:
--------
The iNNER CiRCLE merged with Phose and Phree on March 1st, 1994. 
To form PPiC.  A diverse group devoted to hacking, phreaking,
anarchy, and other weird shit like storytelling and getting fucked.
   -Scourge and No Name, leaders of PPiC...





                        The True Game
                        -------------
                          -Scourge

        Who am I?  The question has happened many a time, over and over.
Am I the super-intelligent person some people make me out to be?  Am I the
brutal asshole others have labeled me?  Am I the vicious hacker, the
evil mischief-maker, the lover?

        I am fate.  I defy the bonds of the oppressing law, of the
corruption which eats at this world.  I destroy the corrupt, I live with it,
and it with me.  I am the lover, the fighter, the brain, and the devil.

        What is my destiny?  What am I meant to do?  Do I follow my current
path?  Does my destiny in destroying the security of this corrupt world
make me evil as well?

        I am not of this world.  I defy the corruption.  This is the True
Game.  The game of hiding, the game of seeking, the game of sex, the game of
war.  It is a battle I cannot win, but I will not lose.  Breaking
the standards others have set is not immoral, stopping the rise of the
evil of conformity is not immoral.  Fight the battle, and you may
not win, but we can still win the war.

Become the hacker.  Become the fighter.  Become the lover, the genius, the
thief and anarchist.  Join the movement.  We have the so-called power, if
we united, what law could stop us, what name could strike fear into our
hearts?







                        DESTROY CORRUPTION
                       ------------------
                     Stopping the Corruption:

There are several ways you can "liberate" freedom in your school.  
Sick of listening to conforming bitches like Mrs. Biatch, your 11th
Grade English teacher?  Well, you can give yourself a little relief (Grin)

        First, take the following:  
                Newspaper
                Scissors
                Glue
                Gloves
                Envelope
                Stamp.
Write a good nasty letter (bomb threat) to your school. 
Chances are 50/50 they will ignore it the 1st time.  Write a few more, get a
friend that's out of school to make a few calls from DIFFERENT pay phones.
(This is important.  If I hadn't said that, some poor kid would say,
"But mommy, Scourge didn't say I had to do it from different pay phones!"
If that doesn't close school, do this.  Take a little (PURE) ammonia, and
some iodine crystals.  Mix them till the iodine dissolves.  Dip some
toilet paper into the mixture, stuff it in the keyhole of the school
or something, while IT IS STILL WET!  Once it dries, anyone who touches,
hits, breathes on, or looks at the TP will probably be injured by the
explosion.  THEN, they will take you seriously.  Be VERY careful from now on.
If you get busted, you will most likely be on NATIONAL TELEVISION!  
                                                 -Scourge





                            No Names Shit
                            -------------
                               -No Name

Hey its me. I'm not gonna get all deep like Scourge. But here's the shit.
We're new at this.  The shit's probably all fukd.  Typo's and other shit will
be all over it. Sorry this'll be so short, but we wanted to get our name out.
As Scourge says, We are hackers/piraters/anarchists.  We plan on doing a lot
for the hacker community. But we need some help first. Call our board (29A)
give us some numbers of good boards to get on. In 616 there are only a couple
of kewl boards around so we need some more. -End of my shit.

About me: Past adventures.. Well, I remember when I became the "TiTANiC" and
sent a zip file that had a ansi bomb inclosed to many of the local bbs's.
which when unzipped redefined the return key to type format c: (enter) Y (enter)
Hacked around a security program that did loggins for a network. (Stole the
supervisor password with a log file.)

Remove cover from area marked in the above illustration. (use pry bar.)
You will find four (4) wires. Red, green, yellow, and black. The Red and
Green wires are for phone use. The yellow and black are used to tell when
coins are inserted, and when to give them back. If none are exposed, Use
wire strippers and strip the red and the green wires. Attach the red and
green sides of the beige box to the appropriate sides. And there you go.
You have just bypassed the phones coin collect.

(If wall mounted or in a different shell, reach under it and feel around,
If not found, pull phone off of the wall and get the wires.)

     1......At Ease v1.0

               There are many ways to get by "At Ease v1.0"


                    1) Overite the "At Ease Preferences" file using
                         a Word Processor of your choice.

                    2) Delete the "At Ease Preferences" file using
                         any application with a delete function.

                    3) Start up with a boot disk. Then drag "At Ease"
                         into the trash. Drag the "Finder" from the
                         boot disk into the hard drives "System" folder.
                         Eject the boot disk and reboot.

                    4) Use "HyperCard" to make a script to delete the
                         file "At Ease Preferences". (Knowledge of
                         HyperCard  Programming is helpful)...req...

     2......Folder Bolt v1.0

                    1) Rebuild the desktop. (by holding Shft-Cmnd-Opt-Ctrl
                    during boot) Then do a finder file search. Search for
                    "Kind" contains "Folder". Keep hitting Cmnd-G until

                    other hex-editor. This should show you the password.

                    4) Buy folder bolt. (or get the administrators disk)
                    Run the program "FolderBolt Administrator". Then select

There once was this kid named Norman.  Norman wasn't to liked by the kids
at his school.  He tried everything.  Bell bottoms, dancing the Cabbage Patch,
playing "lackey" for all the other kiddies.  Suddenly, an idea hit Norman.  He
would work out some, got his ear pierced, got his buttcheeks stiffened (for
the fellas), and wear the cute black handkerchief in his back left pocket.  He
got attention, all right.  He started hanging out with the crowd whose names
all ended in "enna".

                Chapter Two

   The annual FBA was meeting.  No one really knew what FBA stood for, it was
   considered a great honor of the group leaders.  Every Wednesday they would
   go out, take big sledgehammers, and go beat queers.  They were going to
   merge with the KKK tonight at their annual Queerbash fest.  They sent out
   invitations to all the unknowing rump-rangers, including Rush Limbaugh,
   George Bush, and Cindy Crawford (who by the way IS a man, you think any
   WOMAN could be that good-lookin?)  When the party started, nothing but
   underwear was left of the 3 celebs.  Not even a dickhair.  One of the
   group leaders' sons, whose name was Terrin, decided he was going to protest
   against such violence.  After all, homosexually-oriented people have their
   rights.  So, he staged a revolt, and got kicked out of the FBA.


                Chapter 3
So, Norman was in the grocery store.  He was checking out the pantyhose section
when four men in full-body armor burst into the store holding long metal
pipes.  Norman started viciously rubbing at the mascara and other highlights
on his face.  He ducked behind the isle.  Unfortunately (for him) he was
seen by one of the men.
        "Hey guys!  A fag!  Let's get him!"  screamed the man.
To no avail, Norman ran as hard as he could.
        "Sthtop it, you guysth!" he pleaded.  The men grabbed him, and shoved
their pipes up his ass.
        "Let's see how you like it, fag!" one of the men screamed.
        "Not stho hard!" yelled Norman.
But the men didn't listen.  They shoved their pipes up Norman's anus further,
and punctured his intestines.  Norman's blood began to drain from his face, and
shit started pouring out his butt.
        "Oh, you like it, huh?" laughed one of the men.  He shoved his pipe
until he heard a FSST and his pipe was dissolved by the mixture of stomach acid
and come.  THe man holding the now shortened pipe screamed, and the rest of the
men shoved their pipes in other places also, causing Norman's heart to come out
of his mouth, shit pour out of his ears, and have an enigma all at the same
time.
        "Whoa!  Look at that, guys!  Ain't ever seen a full-body breakdown
before!"
So the four men nailed his arms and legs to the front window of the Grocery
Store.  Their customers dropped by 50%.

                Chapter 4

  Terrin, hearing about the mishap at the grocery store, got there as quickly
  as he could.  The grocer took him aside.  After a long talk with the
  grocer, Terrin wrote all he had learned in the little notebook he had
  purchased for this person.
        "Stho Norman isth sthill alive?" Terrin asked the Grocer.
        "Yeah.  Of course!  As soon as the government heard of it!  You
know what a straight man's rights are worth nowadays!  Why, as soon as they
heard of Norman's plight, they kicked out all the white male Republicans!"
        "Yeah.  Stho?"
Terrin traveled to the hospital where Norman was.  He saw Norman hooked
up to a very expensive piece of machinery, with big patches of gauze on his
ears and a tube running up his anus.
        "Norman?  Are you all right?" asked Terrin.
        "Yesth.  I'm doing justh fine, for a man with a enigma."
        "Well, I've come on your behalf, to let you know that usth kind of
people do have righth."
        "Oh, fantasthic!  Terrin, will you be my lover?"
        "Yesth, you hunk of a ma-an!"
Stho Norman and Terrin went off into thhe thsunthset.

                Chapter 5

The FBA was at one of their Wednesday meetings.  They were in quite an outrage,
hearing that Terrin had joined the ranks of the butt-pirates.  They were all
wondering what was to be done about this.  So, they all joined together, and
after 2 coffee breaks, a few donuts, and some wild thang on the boss's desk
(characteristic of federally-oriented agencies), they came up with a wonderful
idea.
        "I say we kill him."
After 2 more coffee breaks, and a few more rounds of hanky-panky:
        "No.  We couldn't do that"
So they decided the best way to teach him his place was to show his foul acts
on public TV.

                Chapter 6

        "Oh, Terrin, you thsweet angel!" Norman screamed as he shot it
up Terrin.  He fell over, only to see, laying on his back, a 9mm camera.
        "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"  he screamed, mortified.  Terrin,
watching TV, also screamed when Tiny Toons was interupted by his session
with Norman.
----------------------------SIX HOURS LATER--------------------------------------

NOrman and Terrin sitting in a police station for exposure.  The cops, being
faggot-haters, staged a car chase and blamed their beating them on their
being temporarily insane.

                Epilogue

        Norman, still having a indecent life after being raped in prison and
suffering anal cancer, changed his name to **** *********.  Terrin, being
chased after, decided to change not only his name, but his actual sex.  He
got a Fake ID and renamed himself (Name with-held).

                Point of Story

HA!

See what eventually happens to faggots?

Corollary to Moral:  Faggots eventually get anal cancer.

III. Bank Codes [ International Bank or Interlink Numbers]



     These are used in checking credit. Later on, you will learn that while
checking the credit cards for the amount of credit, you will be prompted to
enter the Bank ID along with the Merchant ID. The bank IDs are, I believe, from
the following list. One note-- you cannot just choose any Bank ID and use it
with any merchant ID. They must correspond in some way. How, I don't know. I
THINK that a bank issues a merchant number to each of their customers. If you
try to use a merchant number with a bank number, and the merchant doesn't
actually use the bank that is specified by the bank number, you are going to
get some problems. (ie, the verification won't go through.) Again, I will state
that this is only a theory. The reason that I post this theory is to get minds
working. So far, no one has mentioned their ideas on the function of Bank
Codes. If you do happen to find out the true meaning of these numbers, please
get in touch with me so I can update this list. Thanks. One word- on VISA
credit cards, the bank IDs are the first 4 digits of the Card. For Mastercards,
however, they vary. A list follows:

     Bank                       Bank Code
     ----                       ---------
 Chemical Bank                    1263
 Marine Midland                   6207 [1207?]
 Manufacturers Hanover Trust      1033
 Citibank                         1035
 Huntington                       1226
 First Card Gold                  1286
 MBNA                             6017
 Chase Manhatten                  1665
 [ Bank from 5127 ]               1015



               The LLLL part, or the second group on a credit card in from
the left, contains some VERY useful information about the card. This group
holds the information on the Maximum Expiration Date and the Maximum Credit
Limit. (I believe that you can all see the benefits of this.) This does not
mean, however, that the ACTUAL expiration date and ACTUAL credit limit are in
this group. What it means is this: When the different Credit Card Companies
issue Credit Cards to the consumer, he of course has a credit limit. And when
the Companies formulate credit cards, they create certain groups for certain
customers. That is, certain "groups" contain all the credit cards for people
with a credit limit between $x and $y. The same thing goes with the expiration
dates. Everyone whose card expires after m1/y1 and before m2/y2 has their
credit card in a certain group formulated by the company. For example:
My name is Joe Schmoe. My Visa credit card expires in January of the year 1999.
My credit limit on this card is $7,000. My credit card number (CCN) will
probably be in the same group as my brother-in-law Jack Koff whose card expires
in December of 1998 and whose credit limit is $6,000. BUT, our cards will be in
different groups entirely than my boss' whose card expires in June of 1995 and
whose credit limit is $40,000.

     Back to the point of section IV: Lets say you have a credit card with a
known expiration date and known credit limit. Lets also say that you happen
upon ANOTHER credit card whose numbers are the same up until the last 2 groups.
(You and I see that these two cards were issued by the same bank and PROBABLY
have a credit limit in the same ball park and an expiration date not far from
each other. ) BUT, even though you have this new credit card, you lost the
expiration date and credit limit. GOSH! How are you going to use this card when
you don't know this information?? APROXIMATE! You have a general idea now, and
you can go from there.

     One warning here: I have found that small groups of cards with high credit
limits are often hidden in between large groups of cards with very low credit
limits. For instance, lets look at this card: 4123 4567 8901 2345. From -4567
until 4600 in group 3 (from the right) gold cards may exist. But after 4600 and
before 4567, cards with credit limits of $500 exist. Kind of sucks, huh?? Just
wanted to make you aware of this.

     Now, once you learn how to modify these without hurting the card, you have
increased your value as a carder by 100x. But be careful. Often when you modify
a card's group 3 to get a higher credit limit line of cards, you will find the
entire line is dead. Or, in other cases, just the original card you find is
dead, and all surrounding cards are valid with the new credit limits.


V. "Group 2" & "Group 1"



     These two groups, or the last two groups on the credit card, are the
easiest to modify. By changing these in such a way, you can formulate new
credit cards simply by doing a little math in your head. These two groups
contain the IDentification codes. Later on in your carding careers, you might
find out how to change these, and thus, you have found the secret to a vault of
new and awaiting credit cards. I stress here that the only purpose that these
two groups serve is to differentiate between customers. If the first two groups
of two cards are the same and the last two groups of two cards are different,
the two cards were issued by the same bank and probably have similar credit
limits, but are of course issued to different people.

So I'm sure you could play around with those on your own to get new CC numbers.

Now the tricky part is the Last digit, The Checksum...

Whats the check sum for? Its to stop people from making up there own cards.
But its easy to calculate. (With instructions)

Credit Card. XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXC (fill in numbers from above)

X is a number, and C (the key to the formula) is a check-digit.€
Ignore the check digit (we'll create one) fill in the X digit's with €
numbers ( zero through nine ). Take every odd digit (from right to€
left) a  and multiply it by two, if the resulting number is greater or€
equal to ten subtract nine. Do this for all of the odd digits and add€
the result's together. Next add all of the even digits to the total calculated€
the resulting number find the next higher multiple of ten and subtract€
out result from it.
