                           Some New Ass Shit

                               By Enigma


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
No disclaimer cause I don't give a shit if people get offended.  This is a
text file and isn't illegal so you FEDS can stay the fuk away.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Damn, No Name gots me hooked on spelling fuck fuk.> Oh well.


    New ass shit coming your way.. I'm chillen, bitch sukn on my cactus.
It feels good. Todays subject, uh.. Damn.. I must be.. Damn. what am I
thinking.. Oh yeah. I didn't wanna do this.. But I'm sick of lame ass
fuckers saying shit like "we want more box plans" and "make it larger"
Like I'm some fucking god of T-files that can just think and its done.
If it was thea fcking simple you'd see about a hundred PPiC dox a day.
I got so much shit running through my head.. Hey, I feel like a poem.

Fuck You Overkill (By Me)
-----------------
Fuck you Overkill
You fucking lamer
why'd ya sell out
to that fag Nick?
I don't like that
you tried to play
us like fools....
I'm gonna fucking
rip your computer
out of the fuckin
wall if you think
of fuckin me over
again. BE-AHTCH!!

YEAH.. That was kewl. kinda lame.. I don't really fuckin care.

    Okay.. next thing.. Some people think that this is some Super Hacker
Elite Magazine, and that its all about phone phreaking. Its not. If we find
out something NEW about the phones we'll share, but no sence rehashing old
shit. So if  you  want rehashed  shit, look  somewhere else.  We  try  to
stay as original as possible.

    On a sad'er Note we were betrayed by a close pal of mine, OverKill.
Seems Overkill can't keep his mouth shut. Oh well. Go talking to Nick
And we'll drop ya. If any of you don't know about Nick he's the guy we
always are messing with.  So if we can't have him we gotta move onto our
old buddy from the shit list.. Hmm.. Which one.. Well. as soon as I decide
we'll make them our anti-mascot.

    BTW: If you wanna add anyone or any bbs to our shit list, call the board
and log in. Write a messsage and tell us why they are on your shit list.
brief discriptions Etc. And also tell if you want your alias on it.
If you have a complaint about someone being on the shit list, tough.
write us tell us why. We'll think about it.

    Also. If you were wondering. we aren't out to please anyone. I'm just
trying to get some board busy enough where I can never get through to spend
money on (I can't stand paying 6.2 cents per phone call after 400) AS long
as I can't get in I don't spend money.. :) <The REAL reason I waste my time
on all this is that same. I don't make phone calls while typing>

    I also hate it when you call a LD board, and there are like 6 infoforms
Each of them talking probably ten minutes each. Then sometimes they are so
Picky about you knowing at least two users that you don't get on?
thats why my board, is gonna be super privat, You talk to me on a board,
I give ya the number, no infoforms, If someone I don't know is on, I'll ask
them kindly who the fuk they are. :)
