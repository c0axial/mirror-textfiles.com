   0) Sucks!!!                   6) Gettin' there...
   1) Bites!!!                   7) Kewl..sorta
   2) Eww!!!                     8) Yo!  I can dig this stuff! 
   3) Crap!!!                    9) Woo!  Play some more...

   5) Not half bad, but crap..  11) Has to be by Dream Theater?


     I have decided to break down and give you my opinion on Double-CD
packages.  Before I actually comment on the music, let me first whine about
the packages these wonderfull Double-CD "deals" come in.  When you go into
the store looking for your music, the idea of getting two CD's for the
price of 1 and a half sounds pretty sweet.  Indeed, when you go further
to look for a favorite artist, 30+ songs jammed onto two CD's looks GREAT!
HOWEVER, when you actually buy the Double-CD package, you learn just exactly
what a REAL pain in the ass it is.  What you have purchased is a bulky
nightmare, that is almost guarenteed not to fit in ANY conventional CD 
holder.  Yes folks, I am talking about those 1 and a quater inch nightmare
packages!!!  What's my point?  I think they suck.  Just give me two CD cases,
and shrink rap some plastic around them.  Then they will fit in my CD case
holder.  On to the reviews.
     Since I am on the Double-CD binge, I have decided to review two of the
more "recent" Double-CD packages that I have purchased.  One is the Pat
Benatar Double-CD, and the other is last year's Woodstock '94 Double-CD.
Enjoy...and BY THE WAY!!!  If you have some music that you would like
reviewed, and you A) think I can afford it, or B) can send me a dub tape,
please get in touch with me at mustaine@wam.umd.edu and arrange for me to
hear the stuff.  I would love to review stuff that I don't normally listen
to.

Band #1   
Name    : Pat Benatar 
Album   : All Fired Up (The Very Best Of Pat Benatar)
Info.   : Aside from the bulky packaging, this compilation of Pat Benatar's
          greats really doesn't pack much of a punch.  Sure, you get the
          songs you love from "Best Shots", but aside from that, the album 
          pretty much says nothing.  N-E-Ways, if you are an _avid_ fan of
          Pat Benatar, I would adivse checking this album out.  It pretty
          much covers most of her songs.  I did notice however, that is 
          does NOT feature the song she recorded for "The Secret of My 
          Success" soundtrack; that being "Sometimes The Good Guys Finish
          First."  Oh well, eh?

          absolute worst thing I have ever heard.  How they could butcher
          songs and put them (live) on CD I will never know.  Especially 
          since all the recording SUCKED.  Awesome bands, recorded lousy.
          It has to be a MTV function, no?  ALL of these songs recieve  
          a 5.

          Now before I leave, let me reiterate that the Woodstock '94 CD
is an absolute WASTE of money.  If you buy it, you do NOT have the option of
blaming me.  I told you so :)
     
     Maybe next time I will do some Tecno Compilations....then again...maybe
NOT!  Until then, see ya! - mustaine
