WATCHING THE CLOUDS


people always ask me who I am
and I tell them I'm not a prophet of Uncle Sam
they never guessed I was, never thought such
but don't you dream? - oh, not very much
for if I dreamt of all I didn't possess
then what I would really have would be less

well, can you direct us the way out
I cannot, I say, even though I need not shout
well, can you speak a few words of wisdom
I say I shouldn't, for that minister will someday come
they walk away, in a trance of solemn despair, from here
oh sad souls, why did you come to me with your fear

for I'm just watching the clouds go by
hoping that rain will fall from the sky
and maybe tomorrow a new group will approach me
but I still won't be able to set them free

I couldn't let them go without at least some preaching
I told them that to get ahead you must grab instead of reaching
they seemed to understand, but how can one be sure
and a sweet young girl asked me if heaven was pure
I said, my dear, I am not one to predict the Fate of the dead
she seemed satisfied, as they all did, at what I had said

but I'm just watching the clouds go by
hoping that rain will fall from the sky
and maybe tomorrow a new group will approach me
yet I still won't be able to set them free
