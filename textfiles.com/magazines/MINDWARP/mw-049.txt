                        Various. (Editorials) (Part I)
                                  [Mustaine]

     Wow, YOU WOULD BE AMAZED at how many people I have pissed off just in
the last few years I have been BBS'n in the tri-state area.  Girls and Guys
alike, I have managed to enrage pre-pubescent TEENAGERS everywhere!  What
does this tell me?  It tells me that even in the hallowed sanctuary of
BBS land, there are complete and UTTER MORONS!  Now, in the hopes of
getting some more hate mail...I decided to break down and flame some of
these people (with justification of course) just to make a nifty article
that is SURE to go down in the "Mustaine...Hall of Fame!"
     The first person I would like to pick on would be Mr. Gardner Swan.  
Well, let me take that back..I'm not going to pick on him...I'm more going to 
slam him so hard that when he wakes up his punk rock loving butt will still 
be spinning from the verbal blows.  OK!  This loser (you can find some of his
actually half decent articles in Helter Skelter (Dark Horse's 'Zine) goes
under the alias Red Dragon, because, as he put it : "it's sorta like my name,
spelled backwards."  Well, I don't know about you folks....BUT Gardner
Swan spelled backwards is Rendrag Naws.  Rendrag Naws could become Redrag
News maybe with a vowel exchange.  That would be A) A newspaper devoted to
drag queens, B) Red Dragon spelled bacwards, or C) the farthest thing from
Gardner Swan spelled backwards that I could ever think of.  Now, before you
people start condemming me, please let me make it impicitly clear that all
of this is meant in jest, and I wish NO TRUE ill being towards Mr. Swan in
the slightest.  NOW, I know for a fact he has a sense of humor...so it's safe
to assume he'll live.
      Next, this complete imbecile has the NERVE to tell ME on MY bbs that he
has TOTAL freedom of speech.  (Um...NO).  First, it's MY BBS, subject to MY
rules, and therefore anything I give to YOU (Swan) is a gift, not a RIGHT.
Big difference, I assure you!  He also implicitly stated that he didn't
believe in god (which is OK, I happen to believe in god, but everyone has
their own opinion!), and then further went on to attempt to participate in
a discussion of god (which is lame, because he doesn't believe in god) and
made a total ass of himself.  I really didn't care, cuz it stimulated some
GREAT discussions, which I am thankfull for!  Unfortunately, he persisted in
his nonsense, and pissed off 95 PERCENT of my users, who began threatening to
kill HIM.  Unfortunately, I had to warn him that I couldn't have this hatred
going on, and I asked him to stop, but he didn't so I took his posting access
away for a period of two weeks.  He then unfortunately decided never to call
again, and that was not good.  Oh well.  Maybe next time.  He has his own
BBS now, and I encourage everyone to call it and post and stuff.  He really
can be cool at times, even if he pissed almost EVERY user of Recluse off.
AH well, on to another moron!
     Next, WildNCrazyGuy (or in my version WILD'N'CRAZY'PREPUBSECENT'MORON'
WHINING'MOTHER'(WANT-TO)'F*CKER).  This punk has the nerve to call my BBS,
which runs under the absolute BEST BBS SOFTWARE in the world : SynchroNet : 
and upload WWIYuckV with the description 'Kicks this software in the BUTT.'
Um, well that right there lost him some serious brownie points.  SERIOUS
brownie points.  THEN he has the nerve to fake some of his information and
ASK ME WHY I WANTED IT????  Well, listen up you little f*ck.  I LIKE my 
software, and although Raven is one of the coolest sysops in the world, I
think WWIV blows chunks.  It is geared towards little teenagers who can't
read a manual and set up a decent BBS.  It ALSO comes fully operational in
a shareware form, so YOU KNOW it's gotta suck unmodded.  ALSO, you have no
right to tell me what software to run.  Go blow yourself.  NEXT, I require
all my users to give me real information so I can mail them with BBS changes
when MY BBS changes numbers every other semester.   Pretty cool huh?  
     Personally, I feel that all users should be required to give out all 
their real information when they login to a legitamite BBS.  Most of the 
sysops aren't going to give the information out, and you should at least
figure that even if they do, nothing *that* serious could happen.  Maybe
that's not true in other area codes...but who cares!  I have already 
digressed enough because of the train of thought this moron makes me walk
upon.
    Ack, who should be the next person to flame?  AH!  Here's one everyone
will love.  In the far corner of area code 301's BBS land, there lies a
young 3 year old BBS called Hell's Kitchen.  The sysop, Hell Raiser, is
a pretty respectable 16 year old, and most of his users are cool.  EXCEPT one.
One little moron on this board has the audacity to pick fights with ME (of
all people right?) every single time I log on.  I first called this BBS
when it originally went up, and I used to like it a lot.  That was before I
stopped BBS'n every week.  Now I've narrowed it down to like 2 or three a 
month...BUT ACK!  I digress.  N-E-Ways, this user's glorius alias is
Shaft, or as he recently changed is, NiggaShaft.  Is he black?  Is he white?
Do I care?  NO.  This moron tries to make me look stupid by posting absurd
'crap' about me every single time I log on.  Not to mention the fact that I
recieve about 2-3 new e-mails from him telling me to stop making him look
stupid every time I respond to him.  
     It got so bad at one point that he tried to delete me.  (He has semi-co
access on this BBS.)  To his surprise, Hell Raiser had given me a gloriously
huge security level about two years back for helping him with a personal
problem, and when he tried to delete me, he learned that I HAD MORE security
than him.  He posted as such, and the sysop promptly told him to quit 
messing with me.  I don't know the exact details, because I am not really in
the habit of reading private mail.  At any rate, I think I have made my point
on this moron very clear.
        Alright boys and girls, I must go and write some other articles.  In
the meantime, I plan to continue this article in a future issue of Mind Warp.
I have decided to make it one of my continuing series of Editorials.  Next
issue will feature some other morons I have encountered.  Elvis maybe?  We 
shall see!  Untill the next half....

                ..to be continued..
