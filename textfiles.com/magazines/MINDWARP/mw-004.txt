     Well, by my watch it is now 06/16/94, and I figure I'd better start my 
first music review for Raven... so here we go.  I put together a real dinky 
system to make all you people happy...I know you hate reading boring para-
graphs that have absolutely no value whatsoever.  So check out the little 
chart below, and read on for my music review.  Enjoy, and remember, I never 
said any of this stuff was current.  In fact, this one will be full of some 
old goodies.

BaND #1 : 
Name    : STaBBiNG WeSTWaRD
Members : David Suycott     (DRuMS,PeRCuSSioN)
          Jim Sellers       (BaSS)
          Walter Flakus     (KeYBoaRDS)
          Christopher Hall  (VoCaLS, KeYBoaRDS)
          Stuart Zechman    (GuiTaRS, BaSS)
Album   : uNGoD
Info.   : These guys are like an industrial / metal band that totally rip!
          I first heard them when Raven stuck a CD in my car, and loved em
          ever since.  My favorite songs by them are : Control, Lies, and
          Violent Mood Swings.  The rest of the CD is pretty awesome too.
          Anyways, this one gets a 10+, and if anyone had checked them out
          and disagrees...well, you suck monkey dick and if you are on AA,
          I will PERSONALLY kill your access.  As far as metal industrial 
          goes, this band is gonna rock in the future.  They have that
          college grundge sound, with that cutting edge metal and keyboard
          jazz thrown in.  

BaND #2 : 
Name    : PRoNG
Members : Are you kidding?  They suck SO bad that their names aren't even
          printed on the damn CD of their most recent release, Cleansing.
Album   : Duh....Like read above.
Info.   : CRAP!  0, 0, and MORE 0.  These guys might have been kewl once,
          but I was never around for that.  I heard their song, Snap Your 
          Fingers, Snap your Neck, and I swear, it was like Pantera with
          a different name.  The song was pretty neat, for death metal crap,
          but the whole tape sounds the same.  It's not like Pantera or
          Selpultura(sp?) that occasionaly throw in a ballad here and there.
          IT's crap.  The only songs on this album that one would possibly
          might want to listen to would be track's 3, and 5, those being
          Snap your fingers...and Broken Peace.  Don't buy this tape.  It
          sucks.  I hate it.  I could have spent 11 dollars on something
          much more interesting....like a dozen or so pop tarts.

BaND #3 :                                      
Name    : DReaM THeaTeR
Members : James LaBrie   (LeaD aND BaCKGRouND VoCaLS)
          Kevin Moore    (KeYBoaRDS)
          John Myung     (BaSS)
          John Pettrucci (GuiTaRS)
          Mike Portnoy   (DRuMS aND PeRCuSSioN)
Album   : Images and Words
Info    : 10. Period.  They rule.  Techno Metal at it's finest.  You have
          your hard core metal-techno stuff on tracks 1,3,5,6, and 8. The
          other tracks are awesome ballads.  Hit songs include Pull Me Under,
          Take The Time, and Learning To Live.  Buy their CD.  I did.


     Well that's it for this zine.  Next time I'll do another 3-4 bands.  And 
if you bozos haven't figured it out yet...NO they're not all current releases.  
See ya next time.
