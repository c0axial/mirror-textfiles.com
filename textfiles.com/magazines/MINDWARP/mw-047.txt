                    Its The End Of The World As We Know It
                              (And I Feel Fine)
                               [Killer Wombat]

     Armageddon, Nostradamus, Satan... FUCK THEM.  Yes, the world will be
ending in the next 2 decades or so, but all the bull-shit religions that
people believe in arent have nothing to do with it.  No antichrist fellow is
going to come along and kill everyone in a day.  The end of the world is going
to be much slower and more painful than that.  Its a good fucking thing, too.
     Now I dont study sociology any more than the next guy, but just because
Im smarter than the average bear, it is clear to me that all of you are going
to die, and its your fucking fault.  Just look at the generation gap between
the 80s kids and the 90s kids.  The 80s kids are now in their 20s, and with
the exception of a few, are generally a pretty caring, responsible group.
They are all into this Save The Planet bullshit and spend their money on
environmentally safe detergents, etc.  This is the case against the end of the
world.  If everyone was like the 80s bunch, chances are that the world would
be in a good condition.  A minority of 80s kids were into the punk lifestyle.
Which, in my eyes is the way to go.  Im sure you know all about the punk
culture, so Im not gonna waste my energy on that.  Not enough people were
into the punk thing in the 80s to do any damage... sure it was big, but not
big enough.  In the 90s however, punk broke and merged with the mainstream.
Today's kids are truly punks at heart, they just dont know it, and because of
this, a good majority of today's teens are destructive, apathetic, chain-
smoking fuckheads who vandalize, steal, abuse drugs, and break the law far
more than any 80s type person.  This is definitely a good thing.  Were
talking good with two zeros.  If you look at statistics, you will see crimes
among teens have gone up since the 80s.  Were not talking 1% either, I mean
at least 15%.  If this trend continues, we will have a decent recipe for
widespread disaster.  Wait until the next decade when we are in our twenties
and the next generation is looting and vandalizing and stealing on a day-to-day
basis.  I cant wait.  In fact, I can predict the entire time-line.  Here
fucking goes:

          2005-  Rebel youth are now in the majority. Teens are bringing guns,
                 drugs, and other illegal items to school in numbers which
                 are unstoppable by the authority.

          2010-  Teens start rioting, looting, and vandalizing by the million.
                 Were not talking just the U.S., either, were talking
                 western civilization

          2013-  The government is overthrown, at long last.  Authority, being
                 lazy, greedy fools, cant stop people from anything, due to
                 the sheer numbers of the crimes.

          2014-  Apathy and greed among everyone creates complete anarchy for
                 at least the US.  Life is good.  People start killing each
                 other like mad.

          2015-  Civil wars break out in many countries along with mass
                 terrorism.  Tensions between other countries begin to
                 develop.

          2016-  World War III is upon us.  GOOD.

          2017-  After three years of civilian warfare, and killing for fun,
                 the nuclear weapons are brought out to play.  Were talking
                 NUCLEAR WARFARE, baby.

          2019-  Human life is scarce among a scene of decay, ruin, and ash.
                 Those strong enough to survive are few and far between.  Due
                 to deadly fallout, nuclear winters, radiation, and disease,
                 those who were able to survive the bombings die due to lack
                 of everything.

          2020-  With the exception of a tiny population (maybe 10,000 people
                 or so)  The human race is wiped out.  No chance of coming
                 back.  In a few years, there is no trace of human life on
                 earth.  GOOD.

     Well thats my little prediction... Ill be damned if its accurate.  Well
I guess the moral of this t-file is:  You cant make a fucking difference.  The
world is coming to an end in the next 25 years.  Theres NOTHING you can do
about it.  So have fun and dont worry about a career, a future, etc.  Youll
be dead by the time youre 35.
