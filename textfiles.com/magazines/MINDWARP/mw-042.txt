Angst wrote this... imagine it all in blue

I said i would write a mind warp article a long time ago.  I told Mustiane
I would.. hehe uh.. i never did.. oops.. well now i wrote 2. k?  i am in
a writing moood now.. so here goes.. this article is about... the wop wop.

i got wop wop today.. i love wop wop..  wop wop is
the best.. and wop wop loves me too.. me and wop wop.. i know wop wop likes
me and not anyone else casue wop wop makes a nice sound for me.. wop wop
...  wop wop and me will be together froever.  i walked out of there with
wop wop who i love and who is great because wop wop was free.  but i walked
out with wop wop in my hand with the stolen thing up my sleeve and wop wop
out in the open cause wop wop had no price it really was free.. not like
the thing up my sleeve.. it had a price of 3.17 so it was not free.. it was
up my sleeve.  but i waslked out.. holding wop wop.. so happy i had wop wop.
i fell in love wil wop wop instantly...  i was so fuckign happy it was given
to me for free.. so i went to the car and put wop wop down on the seat next
to me.. i alnost belted wop wop in, but then realized wop wop didn't need it.
because nothing could harm wop wop.  so wop wop sat next to me and then we
drove.. i did not want to go home.. not go home to the pale boy on the phone
not go home to the pedophile and k... not go home to green hair chicka... not
go home to redneck asswipe  not go home to mom..  not go home at all.. i 
wanted to have a house that just me and wop wop would share.. i wanted to be
in my car with wop wop.. just live there..  wop wop was all i needed at that
moment.. and all i ever will i think.  but anyways wop wop and me drove.. 
drove without a care.. did 70... did 55 did not care...  any speed was good
enough for me cause wop wop was there.  all was calm... wop wop and me didn't 
even get real mad when we were cut off..  it was ok.. it was all so fucking
ok because wop wop was there...  don't ever leave me wop wop...  i love wop 
wop soo much...  but i am going to make wop wop a star.. wop owp will be a
star one day... and it will be ok cause wop wop won't be a snob and wop wop
will stay with me and that's the wayu wop wop wants it.. i know. wop wop told
me so.  wop wop wants to be a star, but wop wop want's no life o fame.  that's
good..  becuase i really love my wop wop.  but wop wop and i in the latino 
gangsta car drove.  we got to the atm.  i needed money.. i touched wop wop
before i left.. i was scared someone would take my wop wop.  steal wop wop
away from me.. i could not have that... i almost brought wop wop with me,
but then thought better of it.. even in deserted place i thought i tbest to 
let wop wop stay and rest.. i got back and wop wop was still there .. i touch
wop wop again to make sure wop wop is still there.. that's good.. it's there.
love that wop wop....  i notice wop wop has clothes.. that is neet.. so when
wop wop gets bad on one side then take of the clothes and wop wop is good as
new again.  i get home.. i carry wop wop upstairs.. hope noone asks questins
about wop wop...  wop wop does not like others.. or maybe that is me.. maybe
it is both.. but i know we definately did not like the hick on the couch., 
but i take wop wop upstairs and put it on green coat chair.. the green is 
good for wop wop.  and then i gotta pee.. so i grab phone.. i listen to 
messages.. afraid someone is calling about wop wop.. someone wants wop wop 
or soemthing.. someone who will steal my wop wop away from me... and there is
none.. and that makes me happy becayse wop wop is not threatened away from me.
so then i gotta do work so wop wop goes on the crates in a higher place 
where nooen can harm wop wop and there wop wop sits.. i do the work and as i
do the work i think about wop wop.. how happy wop wop makes me.. but then i
think that one day wop wop is going to die.. wop wop is gong to die real soon.
and i wonder if i should still love wop wop or stop loving wop opw.. i am 
scared that wop wop is going to leave me.. what if wop wop doesnot love me as
i love it?  then what?  so i try to decide whether to love wop wop or to send
wop wop away before wop wop hates me.. hurts me...  but i decide wop wop is
all i have right now and that i will love wop wop and that wop wop will love 
me too and if it dies or if it does not love me one dya then i will deal with
it then/..  so wop wop sits there as i do my work and as i finish and want to
write all about wop wop as i am now so that i will not forget my lovely wop 
wop.
