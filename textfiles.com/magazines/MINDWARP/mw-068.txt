                             Where's Raven?
                               [mustaine]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     As most of you have probably noticed, there are no articles by the 
founding editor and ex-sysop of Arsonist's Arsenal, Raven.  As of 06/13/95
Raven has moved to Houston Texas.  Most likely, he will get to meet Erik
Bloodaxe (damn), and hack himself a dialout to occasionaly get back in touch
with us.  Unfortunately, he has decided to let me handle the magazine from 
here.  Now, admittadly, I am not the easiest person to get along with, and
I myself didn't really want the responsibility of running the zine, but I
will try to keep it coming and keep the zine alive.
     Raven has informed me that he will be starting a "Mind Warp! in Houston"
sister zine, which hopefull will be publishing within the next few months.
I wish him luck.  Now, about our zine.
     I still need more writers, even though our new Javert (PRiDE), and
Dark Horse are pulling out all stops for cool fiction and poetry.  Yes, yes
I still do music and flames and programs, but I need more humourous info-
articles, etc, etc.  I will try to setup a schedule, and get new volumes out
every one or two months.  This will only happen if we get material to write
about.  SO, I am asking for help.  Check out the Index for how to get in
touch with us, and send us your stuff.  I'll publish pretty much anything.
I am looking for :
     
     o political commentary       o jokes
     o sports                     o short fiction
     o anarchy!                   o computer underground
     o recreational news          o bitchy editorials
     o hate mail                  o Elvis sightings
     o condom usage instructions  o used lysol cans
     o and much, much more!       o in fact, anything more!

     So help us out folks, we need the support!  Thanks.
