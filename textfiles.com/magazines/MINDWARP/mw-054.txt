                             Mind Warp! Index #4
                                   [raven]
                            January - April  1995

        Welp, here it is, volume #03, our fourth one.  It's been a while, I
know.  I put together a WWW homepage for the zine, so check it out (address
is farther down).  What's most excited me since the last volume, is when I
read the latest uXu release, and I saw that the GNN had mentioned us at the
end of one of his files (UXU-244.TXT "The New World Order", to be exact).
I was so thrilled, that I ran around the house yelling "I got a UXU mention!
I wanna be The Chief when I grow up!"  Ok, enough brown-nosing...
        Hmm, since January, I've become a major fucking druggie.  Thank you,
thank you, I'm enjoying it (failing school, but I'm fucking enjoying it).
I started smoking up in January, and I was a recreational drug user.  Then,
in like February, I had what was supposed to be an intimate little gathering
with my friends to smoke some reefer, while my parents were in New Orleans
getting drunk.  There were so many people crammed into my little townhouse.
Those INFLUXX peoples had brought this schweet Grafix bong, and it toked
quite nicely.  I was fucked up that whole weekend, and I'm now basically
high 24/7.  That's the main reason why this volume took 4 months to complete,
because I was too busy being stoned and/or building bowls and bongs, to put
it together.  I'm currently out of pot, so I'm working on this.  I do have
some nice brownies to eat after I'm done, tho. :)
        Another thing that has changed since the last volume is my BBS going
down.  Now, I have made Dark Horse's BBS my WHQ. (And he doesn't even know it
yet, I guess he'll find out when (if) he reads this :)  
        Enjoy the zine, I had to like do work on it.  :)

        Please send all of your Mustaine Hate Mail to either address as well.
We know you want to send it.  Hate mail will be sent to him, and it will be 
published (with a reply) in a future issue. :)

        Distribution info:  Please, distribute these all you want, but just
keep the files in format of MW!-XXX.TXT where XXX is a the file number that
is already on there.  Also, if the file is archived, please keep it in the
same format, except for the .TXT extension which should be replaced by the 
default extension of the archiving program (ex. ZIP,ARC,ZOO,ARJ,LZH, etc..).
And the other format of distribution (and probably now the MAIN format) is 
in the form of MW!-VXX.AAA, where XX is the volume number, and AAA is the
default archive extension.  This method will contain all of the issues of one
volume in a single archive.
** New!  Another format of distribution is the MWy-XXX.TXT, where y is the 
volume number and XXX is the file number.  Mustaine had to start this format
for the FTP site, because UNIX doesn't allow the '!' character in filenames.
Thanks.
