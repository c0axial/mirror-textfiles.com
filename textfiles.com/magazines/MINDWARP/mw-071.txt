   Ordinarily, the commentary part of the 'zine usually comes from within
the index.  However, since so much "stuff" has happened, and these particular
events are of some relevancy to our readers, I have decided to include it
here, in the first article of this issue.
   To begin, I apologize for the 'zine not releasing any new material for
the last couple of months.  There was actually a Volume #5 that was ready to
be released, chock full of cool stuff by Raven, Dark Horse, and myself,
but when I upgraded to Windows 95, I completely lost EVERYTHING.
   Consequently, Dark Horse has been very hard to get in touch with, and I
do not have backup copies of his work.  Raven and myself are much eaiser to
get in touch with, but neither of us have backups of our work either.
   Many people noticed our World Wide Web homepage was not functioning for
the summer, and for those of you who were upset...sorry.  The homepage was
disabled because the administration on WAM (Workstations at Maryland)
decidied that many Mind Warp and Sphear articles were "illegal", and
"touching on grey areas of the law."  Because of this, the homepage is
being constantly revamped to comply with the rules.  Life's a bitch.
I might add that Sphear is NO LONGER supported at Mind Warp! sites, and we
no loner endorse readers to check out the 'zine.
   These are just some of the few reasons why Mind Warp! hasn't released in
so long.  So what are some others, you might ask?  Well, for one, life
f*cking sucks right now for me.  I am taking a truckload of courses, I
am going through a pre-have-togetarealjobanddosomethingwithmylife crisis,
and I am majorly depressed.  Why am I depressed?  I don't know.  I have a
wonderful girlfriend, I have an abundance of friends, I have an entire
HOUSE to myself, I have pets, and I am potty-trained.  I think I need a
'proverbial' kick in the ass.  Note I said 'proverbial'...of any of you see
me on the street and start kicking me, I'll beat the living sh*t out of you.
Oh well...enjoy the volume.  <har har>
