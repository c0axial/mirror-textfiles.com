                              Untitled Poem #2
                                  [Deker]

*Untitled*
9/20/94


I have seen the all swallowing chasm of eternity
I have seen how inconsequential we all can be
Though it took only a moment
A quick flash in time's eye
And I've seen with what ease we may die

But these thoughts I saw were not my own
They will stay the property of an unknown
And What *I* saw
The thoughts *I* made
Were of a bright and airy glade
With color swirling to and fro
And I regretted that I had to go

For the music looked so sweet
And the flowers sounded grand
And I felt I held the world in the tiny palm of my hand

I regret you did not see it too
The wonderous things that I've told you
But I'll keep these thoughts safe in  my mind
For so many people are so unkind
To those of us who will choose to 
Alter our minds
