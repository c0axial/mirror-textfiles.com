     Ok, Volume #4.  As you may have noticed, Raven isin't around at all for
this volume.  Check out "Where's Raven (MW!-068.TXT) for information.  So
what's new since the last volume?  A lot of rather cool stuff has happened.
Javert (Pride) has joined our little group and submitted a truckload of 
poems.  Dark Horse has once again graced us with his poetry, and he also
submitted some short fiction as well.  One was published now, and look for
the rest in upcoming Mind Warp! volumes.  I also did some poems and stuff,
and this volume has a very literary orientation to it.  Add to that my
usual music review, occasional editorial, and hate mail flame responses, and
you can pretty much sum everything up.  I do believe most of our audience
will agree that this volume is a step back in the right direction after
the release of our third volume.  We still are looking for more writers...
and we pretty much promise that so long as I can read it, I will publish it.
