     ..ok, ok, I lied.  Sorta.  I am *not* going to flame Elvis this time.     
I have found people much, much more worthy of my time.  This time folks, I
am going to slam our very own Angst, and a l00ser known around here as
"the Lizard King" or "Phiber Optik."  Before you start yelling, NO, it is 
not the same Phiber Optik that is the well known hacker.
     First, shall we start with Angst?  As I recall, a long time ago, Angst
went to the same college as me.  Unlucky me, eh?  At any rate, she called
Recluse (my bbs way back when), and we started a working dialouge in e-mail
on my system.  She was rather amazed with my assorted collection of zines
in my file area, and told me she had a zine that I might find interesting.
Unfortunately, the zine was on paper, and that would mean I would have to
trek somewhere to get it from her.  No problem, campus only has 50,000 people
in it, and walking around all day is no big deal.  Well, we finally aranged
a meeting time in between exams, and I decide to walk to the place *after*
I had eaten my lunch, so I could be five minutes early.  Mind you, I had
to eat lunch on the *wrong* end of campus to meet this chick.  So I get 
there, and I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  She doesn't come.  Oh well.
     After trekking back to my dorm, I find in my voice mail that she has
left a message that she is sick, and could not make it.  Okay, I can let
that slide.  I have a decent temperment.  N-E-Ways, school gets out, I
hear nothing from her for like a week, and then BLAM 12:00am (at my
parent's home), the phone rings, and on it is a chimpubk sounding girl
asking for Mustaine.  Can you guess who it was?  At any rate, she and I
make plans to exchange the zine at the mall or something.  When the time
came, my grandmother happened to fall ill, and I ended up in the hospital.
No big deal right?  I think everyone can understand an illness in the family.
WRONG.  This bitch writes me the meanest, nastiest, most selfish e-mail I
have ever recieved.  She was PISSED!   This bitch then goes on to post my
HOME PHONE number (where my parents live) on several automessages in the
301 area code.  Mistake.  Listen up you pudgy little bitch.  If you *ever*,
and I mean *ever* try to phuck with me again I will personally find your
ass, rip up your jeep, and tie you to the bumper of a postal truck.  Agh.
     Now, for the Lizard King.  This lamer, formally known as Tom Sikora,
but knownst to us with suck lovely alias's as "the Lizard King" and "Phiber
Optik" has the NERVE to pick the bone with me.  First off, let's pick at
his alias, Phiber Optik.  It is a well known fact that one of the most 
famous hackers in all of computer history was known as Phiber Optik.  It's
just plain desecration to take that name and give it to someone as lame
as Tom.  Then, to actually flaunt it in front of *my* face, and have the
nerve to leave me e-mail with the context "no one will mind if I borrow it"
....what in the hell are you thinking bozo?  Half the users on #HACK and
#HACKERS were ready to kill the boy when he logged on with that alias.
I warned him that half the 301/202/703 hackers weren't to pleased to see him
using it either.  Does he listen?  NO.
     Not only does he have a long history of being both a PD and WAREZ leech,
but this lamer has the nerve to pose as a well known hacker.  Huh???  He
even had the nerve to try to kick me off one of my favorite boards because
he didn't like me making him look bad.  Too bad for him the sysop gave me
more priority.  Listen up punk.  It would be in your better interests to
leave BBS land forever.  Pack up the modem, and sell it.  No matter what
alias you hide behind, the behavior is the same.  You've got an elitist
little attitude, and NO ONE LIKES YOU.  You leech files, try to play god,
and piss of hundreds of users.  Unlike me, who also has somewhat of an
elitist attitude at times, you have NO CLOUT.  Whenever you pop up with a 
new alias, (like Sting once said), "I'll be watching you."  ...err...and I'll
probably be flaming you.  Untill I find more people that piss me off folks,
that about raps it.  Latez!
