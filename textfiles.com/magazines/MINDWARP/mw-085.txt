THIS INDIANA NIGHT


Indiana nights are like coffee beans;
everything is dry until the water percolates down.
But there is more to an Indiana night
than a mug of caffeinated liquid.
There's a chance something may happen this Indiana night.

Each cloud changes in gradient from a pure white;
a contrast of grays mounted on a blue canvas.
Points of view are misty, but still visible
as the moon beams like a pinwheel of spirals.
There's a chance something may happen this Indiana night.

All the smiles on the children's faces turn to frowns;
they know what is to come as mothers holler.
A cow, as a breeze rustles the corn stalks,
lays on its side to give birth to her calf.
There's a chance something may happen this Indiana night.

As the rain begins to fall in installments, I cry too;
each dark cloud comforts my lost affection.
I extend my trembling hand to the heavens for help
but it roars and spits, as if my dedication was not true.
Something happened this Indiana night.
