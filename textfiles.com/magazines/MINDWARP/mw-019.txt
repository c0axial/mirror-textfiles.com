                                 Untitled Poem:
                                  [Dark Horse]

ShIT I have no topic.

the midpoint of summer looms
and I am still alone.
I will meet someone! i say
bullshit
you don't just meet someone
but I am shy
timid
my heard pounds, 
races my eyes following a girl
and I am, five seconds later
still alone
laura?
no, she has to choose between two already
maybe three's the charm, 
but I doubt that in this case
besides
i bet I'm like a brother to her
I'm her boy-best friend
not boyfriend
who else?
noone of note
all my girl-friends
are spoken for.
computer girl, modem mate?
possibility.
but remember "jenpunk"
from IRC?
Reconnisance mission
from a friend at her school
showed ugly at 12 o'clock
and annoying dead ahead.
well, modem girls are like
a box of chocolates:
"You never know what you're gonna get" (horrible I know :) )
they might be worth a shot.
but in the meantime,
I'll meet someone
somewhere
soon.

Until then I'm alone
in my basement
with 2 dogs
and a broken syle of poetry
sorting out my life
