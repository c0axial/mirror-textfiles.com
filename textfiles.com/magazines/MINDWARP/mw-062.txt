        There are many different compression utilites available for
use in the pc world to shrink the average filesize for more room on the
host compters hard drive.  Some of the most common for the DOS operating
system include PkZip, Arj, and Lharc.  These utilites have obvious advatages
for the user.  Creating more disk space, packaging many files into a small
mobile file that can be extracted elswhere, and the ease of moving such files
are certainly transparent.  However, these compression utilites all use
a different algorythm for their storage capabilites, and as data suggests,
these different algorythm's are not all suitable for compressing all types
of files with the best compression ratio.  Indeed, in some instances, the
compression utility can actually increase the size of the file.
        The procedure below outlines the use of three compression utilites,
PkZip, Arj, and Lharc, and their induvidal results in the compression of
three types of files, ascii text files (.TXT), executables (.EXE), and
graphics (.GIF) files.  As the data suggests, different compression utilites
can be more effective on certain files than others.

Procedure

        Three files were randomly selected off of a hard drive contributed
        by a willing pc user.  These files were as follows:

        FileName       Size         Type
        ------------   -------      -----------------
        SCANDISK.EXE   124,262      Executable 
        GENERIC1.TXT    86,303      Ascii Text File
        TESLA-02.GIF    63,885      GiF Graphics File

The files were then compressed using the three compression utilites keeping
the same filename, with a new extension.  (ie. .ZIP, .ARJ, or .LZH.)

Data + Results.

FileName       Compression Name   Original Size  Compressed Size  Rank
-------------  ----------------   -------------  ---------------  ----
SCANDISK.EXE   SCANDISK.ZIP       124,262        120,715           #3
SCANDISK.EXE   SCANDISK.ARJ       124,262        120,696           #2
SCANDISK.EXE   SCANDISK.LZH       124,262        120,666           #1
-------------  ----------------   -------------  ---------------  ----
GENERIC1.TXT   GENERIC1.ZIP        86,303         31,716           #1
GENERIC1.TXT   GENERIC1.ARJ        86,303         31,925           #2
GENERIC1.TXT   GENERIC1.LZH        86,303         33,517           #3
-------------  ----------------   -------------  ---------------  ----
TESLA-02.GIF   TESLA-02.ZIP        63,885         63,775           #1
TESLA-02.GIF   TESLA-02.ARJ        63,885         63,911           #3
TESLA-02.GIF   TESLA-02.LZH        63,885         63,834           #2
-------------  ----------------   -------------  ---------------  ----

Conclusion

        The data shows that not all the compression utilites work the same
on certain files.  For executables (.EXE), Lharc is clearly the utility
to use.  For ascii text (.TXT), and for graphics files such as GiF (.GIF),
PkZip should be used.  Arj never placed 1st in any of the trials, but one
would note that Arj actually increased the file size when attempting to
compress the Gif file.  All in all, either PkZip or Lharc are recommended for
use in the compression field.  Both have excellent help available, and are
well documented. Keep in mind however, that these are not the ONLY 
compression programs available for the pc user.  Not mentioned in this
article were such compression utilites as .ZOO, and .UC2.
