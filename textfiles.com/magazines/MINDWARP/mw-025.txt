                          Mustaine's Music Review #4
                             [Mustaine/Influenza]

        Hey everyone.  Long time, no..write articles.  I'm away at college,
so what I submit depends on what time I have available to me.  Which,
by the way, has been about nil.  But here I am with a spare second, so
here comes a quicky doodle music review, making this my fourth.  And as
always, if you don't like it, take it and shove it.

Band #1 : 
Name    : Crystal Waters
Members : This isn't a conventional band, so I can only enter who 
          contributed to the effort.  David Sussman, Kenny Hicks,
          Basement Boys, Brian "G", Sean Spencer, Maurice Fulton,
          Gary Hudgins, the P-Funk Horn Section (Greg Boyer, Greg Thomas.
          Benny Cowan).  There were several others, but I am focusing on
          a maxiCD, and I am only reviewing the one song.  So if this ain't
          enough info wise...go buy the damn album and check it out.
Album   : 100% Pure Love
Info.   : Woah...like you can find this under the soul section in any well
          stocked Kemp Mill.  Crystal Waters is a kickin' singer, and I
          learned a really nifty hip-hop routine to this one (100%...).
          It's definatly dance music!  Anyways, I bought the maxiCD, cause
          I have like no money anymore...(300 dollars worth of required
          books for college at UMCP, first semester freshman!!)  At any
          rate, this maxiCD has seven tracks, and I like most of em..
          Er...this is too long...onto the rating of the songs!
                
                1) Club Mix                  *9  (8:04) (100% Pure Love)
                2) Radio Mix                 *10 (3:06) (100% Pure Love)
                3) Gumbo Mix                 *8  (5:22) (100% Pure Love)
                4) Hump Mix                  *8  (5:33) (100% Pure Love) 
                5) DJ EFX's Tribal Pump Mix  *7  (6:41) (100% Pure Love)
                6) PG Tips Anthem Mix        *9  (7:40) (100% Pure Love)
                7) Trance Vox                *7  (6:40) (100% Pure Love)

          Woah, like Trance Vox is slightly acapella. On to the next
          band...

Band #2 :
Name    : Tears for Fears
Members : I have NO clue.  The CD sleeve was lacking in member info.
          Here are the names *I* know..
          Orzabal, Smith, Bascombe, Holland, Stanley
Album   : Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82-92)
Info.   : It's Tears for Fears and their greatest hits!  Do you like              
          Tears for Fears?  Do you like Ah-ha?  Well, if you like Tears
          for Fears, it's them at their finest in this album, and if you
          like Ah-ha...well they sounf like Tears for Fears too.  This
          CD is filled with killer tracks by the masters of poppish sounding
          stuff.  Buy it, or my dog will rape you.  Here's the rated list..

                1) Sowing The Seeds Of Love          *9  
                2) Everybody Wants To Rule The World *10/11
                3) Woman In Chains                   *8
                4) Shout                             *10/11
                5) Head Over Heels                   *10
                6) Mad World                         *9
                7) Pale Shelter                      *8
                8) I Believe                         *9
                9) Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)     *9
               10) Mother's Talk                     *9
               11) Change                            *9
               12) Advice For The Young At Heart     *9

          See all those 9's and 10's????/  THEY ROCK.  So do the potential
          11 ones....provided you don't overplay them.  

        Well guys, I have a dorm meeting to run to, and to tell ya the
truth, I got home and had Voice Mail telling me a girl that was coming to 
visit(and I missed her cause I was on the phone...) so after the meeting
I am gonna go kick myself...this may be one of the last few things you
see from me for quite some time. (Like you care.)  So here's my message
to her...cause she's got internet, and I'm gonna leave her mail...

        Mandy...sorry to have missed you...I will make it up to ya.  Still
staying sober!!!  Second day too.  At any rate, if you ever read this,
remind me when I'm talking to ya.  Your the sweetest and kindest girl I
have ever met in my life.  Long live the summer camp crew of F'N'F.
Call me. (09/01/94)

        What, you guys are still reading this????  HELLO!  That last bit was
NOT for the general public, so if you didn't understand it...good.  Quick
greets to Raven, Pornlo, the F'N'F Summer Crew...especially Mandy...and to
my faithfull readers...the hate mail is getting WAY out of hand.

        For anyone wanting to leave me mail...GOOD ONLY...I'm at
