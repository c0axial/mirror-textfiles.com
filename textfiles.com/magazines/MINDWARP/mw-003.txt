                               Lame School 'Phun'
                                  [Raven/EoS]

        Another list of stupid things to do at school, there must be at least
a hundred different text files that cover the topic.  A special thanx to 
PlasticMan for the idea of #2, Hershey Kisses for #7, and to Big Bernie for 
the ideas for #1 and #9...

1.   If you witness a fight, <preferably one with a large crowd around it> run
     into the crowd and yell at the top of your lungs "GUN!".  it's great to
     see the people run.. usually even the people in the fight will take off.

2.   If you happen to come across someone who's recently been dropping acid  
     <if your school's anything like the ones I've been to, which it probably
     is, you can find these people in the bathrooms all the time> tell him
     something pleasant like "Aw, d00d, there're ants crawling all over you!!"
     or "Ahhhhhhhh!!! the room is filling up with snakes!!!"  or anything 
     that will scare the hell out of someone who can't reason and will believe
     everything that you happen to tell them.

3.   Go to your local supermarket, and buy a pad-lock and some ground beef <or
     any other meat you want, fish works nicely, too>.  Now, goto school on a
     friday or the day be for a holiday, and find an unused locker, throw the 
     meat in it, and put the padlock on it.  By next Monday <or whenever you 
     return to school> there'll be a quite unpleasant smell, that will be sure
     to disrupt the school, and hopefully get you out of class (if it doesn't,
     then your friends will hate you).

4.   Simple, but effective: Pull a fire alarm.  But please, use enough sense
     to wear a glove or use a stick, or something, so #1 you don't leave 
     finger prints, and #2 all fire alarms nowadays have a dye that comes out
     of the alarm when you pull it, thus marking the person who did pull it.

5.   For those really religious, christian teachers <every school has 'em>: 
     When it comes time to hand in your homework, hand in a sheet of paper
     that is nothing but pentagrams, "satan loves you" written backwords, 
     lot's of 666's, and some broken crosses and anything satanic you can 
     think of.

6.   If you have a teacher who is constantly late, when you're in the class
     room, and the teacher isn't, go press the intercom pager button, thingy,
     and wait for the secratary to respond, then, when she does, have a girl
     in your class scream "SECURITY!!!" and you can get a security guard sent
     to your class, if you time it right, then you can get the teacher and
     the security guard to come into the room at the same time.  Do this daily
     then do it on and off, like do it 2 days, then don't do it, do another
     day, then don't do it, make an irregular pattern, then, after a while of
     this, when they actually stop responding to these calls, just go and
     kill your teacher one day, it won't matter how loud she screams for
     security!  hahahaha!

7.   Near the beginning of a new semester, when you get into a new class, and
     the teacher is assigning new books to each student, there are usually
     a lot of extra books lying on her desk, when she isn't looking, steal as
     many as you can fit into your bag.  Then take the books to a local used
     book store.  They'll buy em back for $10-$20 a piece.  

8.   Become great friends with all the school faculty, especially security
     guards and janitors.  #1: Janitors are just plain cool, #2: if you become
     friends with the security guards, and you get into a fight with someone,
     they can help you in one of two ways: if you're kickin the kid's ass, 
     they'll take their time getting over to the fight, and let you kick his
     ass a little longer, or, if you're getting your ass kicked, they'll run 
     over, and maybe pound on him a little for you.

9.   If your school is currently offering free condoms, go get a couple, 
     and unroll them.  Then get a big ass loogie in your mouth, and spit it
     into the condom.  Find a busy hallway, or even better, a crowded lunch
     table, and fling the condom in.  It'll take about 2 seconds for someone 
     to realize what it is, but when they do, you can believe the area will
     be empty in another 2 seconds.  Loogies and cum are very hard to tell
     apart from each other when you're glancing at it for a second.

10.  If you know someone who has openly declared themselves as a 'homophobe',
     stalk them, and when they go into the bathroom, get a bunch of your
     friends together, and go into the bathroom behind him.  Go to the urinal
     next to his, while a friend goes to the one on the other side, and have
     the rest of your friends kind of create a semi-circle around the dude.
     then while he's peeing, both you and your friend, will both blatanly 
     start staring at his penis, with a wide grin on your face, while the
     others all stare at him with the same big grin, when he turns around to
     run, he'll be greeted by a bunch of other smiling faces. hahahaha that'll
     scare the shit outta the little ignorant mofo.

11.  Turn your school's air conditioning into the world's biggest bong.  Buy
     as much pot as you can afford, I mean a LOT of pot, and go to the boiler
     room of your school.  Most schools have centralized A/C, so look for one
     of the major A/C ventilation ducts.  Find something that can hold the 
     burning pot, but will let still the smoke out of it and let it burn 
     properly (it should be big, cuz you shoulda gotten enough pot.  If you're
     a poor mofo, then go steal some, or kill a dealer or something.)  Now,
     set the container with the pot in it, in the air duct, now, light it up,
     and when the fire alarms go off, and everyone leaves the building, just 
     have all your friends stay in the bathroom or something, and get real 
     close to the A/C...
