no difference


one white
one black
no difference
but one
one rich
one poor
can't you guess?

one white
one black
no difference
but now two
one is hired
one is not
can't you guess?

one white
one black
no difference
any more
illness claims one
war claims the other
can't you guess?
no, you can't
we are all equal

in the end

(untitled)


the light of the stars filters into my room, yet i don't care
i am oblivious to all external interferences
except you

i'm going away soon
hard to believe it's only in two years
i've know you for three, half our time is gone
where did it all go?

tears on my pillow, on my sheets, on my shirt
will they not stop?
it's as if my eyes have a will of their own
will they not stop?

i hope not

the words...emotions i have never even dared to speak to you
come rolling out of my mouth
  fear
   jealousy
    love

real love...i hadn't know it until i said it
but i know it's true

and i know it can never be
and there will always be a place for you here
in my heart

but where did the time go?

and why did the time go?

i...don't...know...

it's going to be hard in two years
god knows where i'll wind up
texas?  california?  new york?  idaho?

you will never be replaced
  ...and i need you now
    ...and i will need you more than ever then


where will i be next year?
a new place, probably
i have never done anything without you there beside me
holding my hand, wishing me luck, praying for me
i hope you understand

i need you

a sinking buoy out in the harbor
and you are my net
don't let me go
and i promise i'll hold on

Utopia
  (for Mr. David Duke)


monkeys, monkeys everywhere!
dancing all around me.
dancing, and singing;
must they be a part of my world?

send them all back,
back to where they came from,
or else...make them my slaves
and have no one question me;
for that is how it should be.

i agree with cosmic slop
they are a...nuisance,
that must be dealt with
before we can reach that giant step...to power.

let them be shipped away,
away to some far-off world
and peace will reign.

they can have their dances,
their food,
their music,
and we...we can have peace!

why are they here?
they don't belong here
in my world.

because i am the man
and it is my world.
i will see to it...personally.
