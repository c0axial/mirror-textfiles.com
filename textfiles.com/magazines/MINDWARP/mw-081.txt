        Sick as it may seem, at the time of this writing, if you were to
use the finger option on your internet service provider, and do a finger
of mustaine@wam.umd.edu, you would recieve current information on my account,
as well as my real name, phone number on where to reach me, mail adress to
contact me, as well as a quote from the "Chronicles of Influenza."
        The "Chronicles of Influenza" are a collection of my own thoughts
concering the computer underground.  If you will, it is my own personal
Testament to the Underground.  There is only one.  It is by no means in
a state of completion, nor do I wish it ever do be so.  It is changed,
revised, updated, as I wish.
        What in the world am I talking about, some may ask?  Does this
article have direction, or am I rambling?  I am forced to ask myself that
question to myself.  The answer is subjective.  This article exists, such
as a dance might exist.  It is here now, and it's interpretation will
exist, in it's own form, by whoever reads this article.  The words will
always be the same, much as the movements of a dance can always be repeated,
but their meaning...their essence, will differ with each reading, or by
each viewing.  Take now, these few excerpts from my own personal Chronicles.
Read them, take them for what they are, and use them if need be. I only
refer to their essence.  Copyright infringements will occur if that statement
is taken literally.

        ..on groups..
       It's funny how there exist groups inside the underground. Whether they
be hackers, or phreakers, or even those funky art coders, there are always
groups.  Warez couriers simply couldn't exist without the concept.  They
always take care of their own as well.  Of course, backstabbing occurs,
such is the life in any aspect of life.  But aside from that unpleasent
abnormality, a bonding not unlike a clanship, or blood brothers, exists.
       I suggest groups are a necessary form of survival inside the
underground.  What good is information learned if it is lost with the
induvidual?  In small masses, the information is distributed to a larger
populous.  Thus the survival of the information is given a larger chance.
There are no secrets worth keeping in the underground.

       ..on time..
       Time is too precious to live inside the underground.  Their is life
outside the eliteness of your computer.  To exist inside the underground
just to exist, is to further nothingness.  Insights are always better when
they are brought from a new perspective.  What new ideas come from the same
group of induviduals?  New experiences lead way to new thoughts.  Stagnation
is the root of all things boring.  I hate boring.

        ..on documentation..
       Necessary, and yet at the same time dated.  By the time this is
written, the moment is over.  The secret is out.  The patch is made, and
the sytem scrambles to adjust.  Make way for technology...you can't make it
stop by writing it down.

        ..on the "a" in hpacv..
        An organization to purport anarchy stops itself.  The heart of the
ideal is exterminated by the body that forms it.

        ..on intelligence..
        Not all understand.  Not all were meant too.  But EVERYONE is
welcome the attempt.  The underground may be exclusinary by it's own goals,
but the right of exclusion is not up for human opinion to decide.  Actions
speak louder than councils, leaders, and ceo's.  Intelligence and will are
the mother of sucess.

        Remember, take what you have read, and use what you will.  There is
always more where the mind thinks, and there is always more where the mind
does not think.  Time is cruel that way.  It will never stop and reflect.
It will on progress, evolve, and exist.
