                        What Happened To Mustaine???
                            [Mustaine/Influenza]

        Hey folks!  It's Mustaine.  As I probably mentioned (many, many
times) I am at college.  So, when Raven called me and asked me to put out
some more articles for Mind Warp I naturally started writing.  But seeing
how I am currently out of ideas, I am just gonna tell you a few things
that have been going on around me, like my board, my love life, my feelings
toward crippled ants, etc, etc.
        Firstly, I am like running a board out here in college-land, called
Recluse.  It's specializes in art, graphics, and magazine files.  Most 
importantly I guess it specializes in conversation.  We have a really neat
forum on airbrushing hosted by Slartibartfast, and many users end up 
buying air-brushed tees, helmets, and other kewl stuff because of it.
On that note, call it today, and become a funky-fresh user like everybody
else.  The number is (301)314-1505 (as of 10/05/94) and the New User Password
is "BLACK AND WHITE ARE BALANCED BY GRAY."  I don't deal in no warez, illegal
credit card info, or any other bad stuff like that.  I'm over 18 now, and
I don't feel like going to jail.  BTW- Raven was nice enough to make us a
distro for Mind Warp, so if you want the files, and don't want to log on as
new, call and login with the 'Guest' account so you can leech the k-kewl
zine.
  
  [Editor's Note: This file is a little outta date, I do believe that the     
   NUP has been taken off of Recluse, if not, then just do as it says..  ]
        
        On to more kewl stuff.  WHERE'S MY FLAME MAIL????  I'M WAITING.
I DELIBERATLY TAKE TIME OUT MY LIFE TO WRITE SHIT TO PISS PEOPLE OFF AND
I DON'T GET ANY FLAME MAIL.  SO, IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE YOU LITTLE 
COUCH POTATO - MR. ROGER'S WATCHIN' - SORRY ASSED - PIMPLE FACED LOOSERS -
WHO LEECH PHILES AND PICK THEIR NOSES ALL DAY, I AM GOING TO THROW OUT SOME
STUFF THAT I WOULD LIKE RESPONSES TOO.  HERE GOES.

        "Computers suck.  People who use computers suck.  People who get
         reall kewl computers to run games suck.  People who use modems
         suck.  People who run BBS's suck. ('cept me, Raven, Dark Horse,
         Alby, Dime, Armitage, and a few assorted others)  People who call
         these boards and leech philes suck.
