That Wonderful, Awful Grinch

'Tis two weeks before Christmas and most parents wonder
If their choice of presents is truly a blunder.
But there is a sure winner for kids around six.
Great story, great artwork, a beautiful mix.
Go to the bookstore, and take no excuse.
Get How the Grinch Stole Christmas, by our friend Dr. Seuss.

It's a story for Christmas, it's all about giving,
And thievery, who-vile, roast beast, and living.
But the theme most important, the best of them all
Is the growth of a heart that's two sizes too small.
The devilish Grinch couldn't stand Christmas season,
And it seems most apparent that this is the reason
That one night he rode from his hilltop hut down
And stole from the whos almost half of their town.
The plot is important, so I won't reveal
What finally happened to all he did steal.

I will tell you this: if you pick up the book
The drawings deserve a significant look.
They are drawn in three colors: red, white, and black.
Let me tell you, my friend, there is nothing they lack.
The drawings in Grinch, the weirdest you'll find
All seem to come from a young child's mind.
Dr. Seuss must be old, maybe even a parent,
But just from his artwork this is not apparent.
The pictures are playful and wonderfully done
The creatures! The features! They're nothing but fun!

So parents, I'll tell you, as one who's been there
And as who's well known as perfectly fair
Just go buy this book, run off, get it hurry
And on Christmas day there'll be no need to worry.
This is one book that is worth every cent.
It will be the best Christmas cash you ever have spent.
