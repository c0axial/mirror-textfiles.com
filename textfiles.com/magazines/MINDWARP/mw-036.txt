        13 Hours here. 

        The day
        early
        bright
                        I rise
        to sun
        warmth
        blankets
                        I hear
        alarm clock
        screeching
        crap
                        I move
        down the hall
        into to the bathroom
        a shower
                        I feel
        water
        warm
        relaxing
                        I dry
        myself
        towel
        complete
                        I dress
        clothes
        warm
        dry
                        I leave
        school
        class
        breakfast       
                        I rest
        study hall
        school 
        luch            
                        I feel
        frustration
        eagerness
        tired
                        I continue
        dance
        practice
        rehersal
                        I look
        the sun
        setting
        blackness
                        I walk
        finished
        complete
        dorm
                        I collapse
        exahusted
        hungry
        aching  
                        I sleep
        waiting
        dreaming
        of tomorrow

                               I found this..
                            [Mustaine/Influenza]
                                 10/10/94

        Gaithersburg High School's graduating class of 1994 can go
SUCK me.  I HATE ALL OF YOU DAMMIT!  (Cept Slarti, Essex, MWagner, WF,
and of course...ME!)  For all of you not familiar with the internet, it
can be a bitch to use.  Especially the mail options.
        So here's my story...GHS's class of 1994 has compiled a list
of everyone's college Inet addresses and sent them out for everyone. NICE
idea, BUT when someone replies to someone on this list, they have the option
of replying to the person they are talking to, or EVERYBODY.  I opened my
mailbox the other day to find 200 mail items.  F*CK.  So I ask the people
to take the time to hit 'R' and respond to JUST the person deserving the
mail...I GET 400 FLAMES.  So, I have decided to stop helping these GHS
moron's with their internet problems.  Here is my poem for you guyz
summing up my feelings right now.  (Note: I DID NOT originally write this
poem...thank my friend Mischelle.)

                WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
                AS THEY USUALLY WILL
                AND YOUR DAILY ROAD
                SEEMS ALL UPHILL,
                WHEN FUNDS ARE LOW
                AND DEBTS ARE HIGH
                WHEN YOU TRY TO SMILE
                BUT CAN ONLY CRY
                AND YOU REALLY FEEL
                YOU'D LIKE TO QUIT,
                DON'T RUN TO ME
                I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

        Peace out, and look for more pointless articles my the most
hated and loved Mind Warp writer since Raven...Mustaine!
        Greets:
