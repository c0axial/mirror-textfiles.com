                       Memorable Class Voting Questions
                             [Raven/EoS, Catwoman]

        Ok, ya know those stupid voting ballot things that you fill out at 
the end of your senior year in High School?  The things where you vote for 
categories such as: Class Clown, or Best Smile, or Most likely to Succeed,
and other such pointless questions.  Well, here is a list compiled by
Catwoman and myself(Raven) of categories that SHOULD be on the ballots...

1.  Class druggie
2.  Class whore
3.  Most likely to drive around and ask small children if they would like
    some candy
4.  Class date-rapist
5.  Most likely to die by lethal injection
6.  Most likely to appear on "Psychic Friends Hotline" commercials
7.  Class drug dealer
8.  Most likely to have a sex change operation
9.  Most likely to spend another 3 years in High School
10. Class drunk
11. Most likely to follow in Adolf Hitler's footsteps
12. Most likely to appear at a baseball stadium wearing a clown wig and 
    holding up a sign that reads "John 38:3"
13. Most flexible
14. Most likely to appear on "Geraldo" for being abducted by aliens
15. Class illiterate
16. Most likely to be lost in the Bermuda Triangle without anyone noticing
17. Most god-awfully annoying
18. Most likely to live with their parents for the rest of their lives
19. Most likely to knock up the class whore and have a "shotgun wedding"
20. Class ditz
21. Most likely to get into Harvard even though they only got a 200 on 
    their SAT's because their rich "daddy" has connections
22. Most likely to appear on the Rush Limbaugh show
23. Most likely to become a Playboy centerfold model
24. Most likely to base life on episodes of "90210"
25. Most likely to write trashy romance novels for a living

categories.
