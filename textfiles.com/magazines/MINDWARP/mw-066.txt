                              Flame Response

    Well, you'd figure with my slanderous remarks that I would have recieved
a plethora of hate infested letters some time ago, but I really have not.
Instead, the only paltry remark that I recieved that could remotely be 
considered akin to "hate-mail" was a small and crude remark that a little
twelve year old user (under the alias "Slayer") sent to me on the 18th of
January.   So as promised, here is that letter, then a copy of that letter
with my remarks (or responses) imposed between the lines.  Please enjoy, and
of course if you think you can do better, send me some stuff, and we'll
blast you!

     Now for some debuttle.  First off, what kind of moron sends e-mail
on a BBS with a title like "hey?"  My grandmother could have formed a more
coherent title.  And before I start, let me metion that your alias sucks.
Now, let's examine some of your e-mail.  Firstly, my eyes fell upon this :

     Mind Warp! rulz, keep up the good work!!!!!

Why thank you, you little piece of inflamed mucus.  I appreciate any and
ALL comments.  My eyes then strayed upon this :

     Oh yeah, and here are some flames that you wanted (what did you 
     want them 4 again???  What did u do??  Ohwell) Uhhm, well, since I 
     don't feel like thinking of anything original here goez 
     You stupid dumb shit goddamn mother fucker!!!!!!!!!!

Okay.  That was original.  According to you, I am simply a "dumb sh*t goddamn 
mother fucker!!!!!!!!!!!"  Gee Slayer, a whole 11 exclamation marks on that 
well thought out comment.  Could you possibly have tried for 12?  I really 
think one more would have made the difference. Oh well.  I guess they don't 
teach proper punctuation and grammatical uses in 6th grade.  (Not that I 
ever use any sort of methods and means in my articles.)  N-E-Ways, to get 
back to my point that flame (SINGULAR) was the weakest piece of sh*t that 
I have ever read.  If you ever try to degrade me with such a weak and 
unsupported flame ever again, I'll frickin' call your MOMMY and have your 
ass spanked.  Would you like me to start bustin' on you?  You remember how 
I tore up that lead singer for Pantera?  I'll f*ckin' make you look like 
a gay sperm whale if you try anything. Puke.                                                                    *)

     Welpers, I really can't say much more.  There really wasn't a very
big flame or anything.  However I would like to thank Slayer for 
participating in Mind Warp and the whole flame thing, and I would just 
like you to NOT take this personally or anything...BUT...your flames SUCK!  
Thanks for the attempt, and I will be looking for more from you and others in 
the future!  Send it all (uncut and uncensored) to mustaine@wam.umd.edu or
contact me on one of our fine support boards.
