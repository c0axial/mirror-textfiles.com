                                Rock the Cradle
                                  [Mustaine]


     Once upon last month, in a very lame area code (301) there died TWO very
important boards.  Arsonist's Arsenal, followed up by Recluse, both bit the
big one..  Why?  When?  None of your buisness.  So the sysops of these
esteemed BBS's got together to talk.

   Sysop # 1 "Hello?  Raven?"
   
   Sysop # 2 "Hey Mustaine...my board's down."
   
   Sysop # 1 "ACK!  What to do about the Mind Warp?"
   
   Sysop # 2 "Well, you could run it.."
   
   Sysop # 1 "Uh..no.."

   Sysop # 2 "How about we run it though the internet, and you handle 
              submissions?"

   Sysop  #1 "Uh...YEAH!"

And thus Mind Warp was saved.  Unfortunately, poor Mustaine fricking makes up
something like 50 percent of the articles represented within the Zine.  Now,
to mention that all of his articles are either boring, or twisted would be
a gross understatement.  SO, Mustaine is personally asking that we get some
more articles for the Zine.  Write em up, and send em to us.  Just please,
don't email me with crap like "What should I write about?"  It just ticks
me off.  Write something...and WE'LL PUBLISH IT.  It's that simple.  Of 
course, that pornographic text file stuff is not my scene, BUT...Raven might
publish it...  I go for stories, editorials, music reviews, art, etc.  So 
write stuff, send it to me. mustaine@wam.umd.edu  It's that simple.  Olay!
