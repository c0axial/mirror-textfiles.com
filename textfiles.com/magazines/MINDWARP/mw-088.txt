                         Four Essential Questions
                                  [Chris]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOUR ESSENTIALS QUESTIONS

I. How can I believe in religion is I know not what God is?

Just a moment ago, I thought I was visited by God
but he betrayed me, so to Hell with prophets.

Oh Satan, I have sinned with pride and joy
as I took a bite from the fruit of the apple tree
and disgraced the obscenity of gratitude.

II. How can I believe in technology when I know not what politics are?

Light bulbs are twisted from their fixtures
for broken glass resembles a crystal prism
that light can no longer shine through.

Cable cords and telephone wires
stretch all the dismal distances
that are apart at the seams.

III. How can I believe in this if I know not what that is?

Nature is nature and soil is soil
while grass is grass and a rose is a thorn.

Everything is everything and nothing is nothing
while the sun only shines at the stroke of midnight.

IV. How can I believe in myself when I know not who I am?

Conceited beliefs and self-sufficing means
make me more stable among the fallen
as those on a pedestal know not at all
where their angry thoughts border.

When all I can see is my reflection,
in the shadow of a street light,
I feel something that's a novelty
and maybe it's just my hand on my face.
