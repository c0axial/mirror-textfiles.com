                             Mind Warp! Index #3
                                 [raven/MG]
                            October-December 1994

        Woo Woo!  Our third volume!(is that all?)  Oh well.. There've been a
lot of changes since the last volume.  Ok, where to start?
        First, Catwoman has joined the US Navy.. (AHH!! KILLING MACHINE!), 
and she is currently being screamed at in boot camp, while I'm writing this.
Hopefully she'll learn some cool stuff, and we'll be publishing US military
secrets.  Yeah, right, if she actually did get something juicy like that to
write about, she'd send it to Phrack.. <g>
        Second, Thanks to Mustaine, we have an FTP site.  Check out the end
of the file to see the list.
        Third, I'm happy to say we have two more writers, Slartibartfast, and
Deker (SysOp of Solsbury Hill, you know the number, you'd better!).
        Fourth, I keep hitting my capslock key, and it's pissing me off!
Enjoy the volume, and thanx for reading!

(To other Mindwarp Contributers, just yell if you want your address up there,
 and be sure to tell me what it is. :)

        Distribution info:  Please, distribute these all you want, but just
keep the files in format of MW!-XXX.TXT where XXX is a the file number that
is already on there.  Also, if the file is archived, please keep it in the
same format, except for the .TXT extension which should be replaced by the 
default extension of the archiving program (ex. ZIP,ARC,ZOO,ARJ,LZH, etc..).
And the other format of distribution (and probably now the MAIN format) is 
in the form of MW!-VXX.AAA, where XX is the volume number, and AAA is the
default archive extension.  This method will contain all of the issues of one
volume in a single archive.
** New!  Another format of distribution is the MWy-XXX.TXT, where y is the 
volume number and XXX is the file number.  Mustaine had to start this format
for the FTP site, because UNIX doesn't allow the '!' character in filenames.
Thanks.
