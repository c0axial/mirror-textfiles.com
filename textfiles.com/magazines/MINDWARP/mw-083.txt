   5) Not half bad, but crap..  11) Has to be by Dream Theater?

        Wow.  It's been a while since I have been able to review any music.
Thanks to my wonderful girlfriend however, I beleive I have enough new
material to do a great couple of reviews in the next few volumes.  Today
though, I am going to do some oldies, but goodies!  Watch for Dream Theater,
Stabbing Westward, and some Enya on the next volume.  Today we do Journey,
Pet Shop Boys, and Corey Hart.

          my dog will rape you.
