        "...You know, son," the man started, "we wouldn't have any of this
if not for a man who roamed across this vast country planting seeds that grew
into luscious, beautiful plants for us to use and enjoy."
        "Do you mean Johnny Appleseed?" inquired the boy.
        "No, son," replied the man, "I'm refering to Davey Hempseed."

                           *    *    *    *    *

        The father quickly but neatly packed another bowl into his pipe.
"Many years back, there lived a man by the name of Davey Hempseed.  Well, he
was just called Dave back then, but you get the idea.  Anyway, Davey Hempseed
was a great man who realized the importance of hemp for the continued success
of this nation.  He was determined to educate the people of America as to
the benefits of cannabis..."
        "But didn't they already know how wonderful the herb is?" asked the
boy.
        "No," chuckled the man, "People back then were savages and not very
intelligent.  Computers had only recently been invented, and they used
devices called microchips that were made of silicon, haha.." the man sighed,
"They had also made hemp illegal."
        The boy's mouth dropped upon hearing this last statement.
        "Yes, people sure were stupid back then.  Alas, thanks to Davey
Hempseed we've come along way, but without him who knows."
        The man paused to take a long deep toke from his pipe.  "Davey
started off with just one brick of marijuana.  He smoked it all with his
friends, and found that he had a over a hundred seeds.  Since they didn't
know how to extract the protein and nutrients from the seeds to make a
hemp-burger or other fine hemp product from the seeds back then, Davey set
off on a road trip to follow the Grateful Dead's summer tour."
        "The Grateful Dead?" exclaimed the boy, "Was this before Jerry Garcia
died?"
        "No," replied the man, again pausing to toke his pipe, "this was
shortly aftwerwards, but the rest of the Grateful Dead members were sell-outs
and continued to go on tour to make more money, but that's not the point."
        The boy pulled his hempen blanket up around him, and begain rolling
a joint.
        "Davey Hempseed," continued the man, "followed the Dead everywhere
in his Volkswagon bus.  Seattle, Chicago, New York, DC, Atlanta, New Orleans,
Austin, Los Angeles, everywhere.  And everyplace he went, he would plant the
hempseeds from the last brick he smoked, and buy another brick.  He planted
the seeds in public parks, private property, landfills, anywhere they would
grow."
        The boy fired up his tightly wrapped J.
        "The following year, Davey followed Pink Floyd around on their US
summer tour."
        "Pink Floyd?!?" the boy exclaimed in pure awe.
        "Yes, Floyd had sold out by this time as well, but they still played
some great tunes.  Anyway, as Davey Hempseed went to each city he had
visited the previous year, he found marvellous fields of hemp already growing
where he had planted them.  Soon hords of concert goers followed in Davey's
footsteps.  They would smoke the plants that Davey had planted and then
replant the seeds.  After a few years the entire country was green with hemp.
All because of one man and a dream.  Davey also did some political stuff,
but I can't remember what right now.  Pass me the herb..."
