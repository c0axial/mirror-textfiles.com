                                 [Raven/MG]

        Ok, Welp this is our first volume of files.  I hope you've enjoyed 
them, and will stick around for the next volume and the volume after that.
We've been having a semi-enjoyable time writing these, and wish some others
would submit something as well.  

So far, the current people involved in this effort are:

   Raven     : Writer / Editor
   Catwoman  : Writer / Editor / Proofreader
   Mustaine  : Writer / k-rad d00d

..and we hope that the list will continue to grow.

        Hopefully next time the files will be much longer, and a whole lot
more of them.  
        As it is, we currently don't have a mailing list, but I'd be glad to
take your e-mail address down, and send the next volume out to each of you
by hand.  I can be contacted at dmaez@cap.gwu.edu on the internet, or #1@3111
on IceNET.  Or, you could call up my board (see the end of the file), and 
download it from there.  The same goes when submitting an article.  E-mail it
to me at one of those, or call my board and e-mail it to me, or upload it.
        The following is the Mind Warp! PGP key.  It isn't required that you
encrypt your mail or your submissions, but it would be greatly appreciated if
you would encrypt all submissions, and if possible encrypt any other mail,
even if it's not an important piece of mail, it's still nice to show support
for public encryption (Die, Clipper Chip!).

        As of now, we also don't have any real distribution sites, either. 
So, if you're interested, e-mail away.

        Distribution info:  Please, distribute these all you want, but just
keep the files in format of MW!-XXX.TXT where XXX is a the file number that
is already on there.  Also, if the file is archived, please keep it in the
same format, except for the .TXT extension which should be replaced by the 
default extension of the archiving program (ex. ZIP,ARC,ZOO,ARJ,LZH, etc..).  
Thanks.
