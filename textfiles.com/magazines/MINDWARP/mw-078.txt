Numero Uno ( I hate Spanish )

            Spring is coming
            and so are the flowers.
            You look very beautiful,
            in and OUT of showers.

            PMS sucks,
            but it goes away.
            I will still love ya,
            and..I'm here to stay.

            Have a great day,
            I hope you can read this handwritin'
            Maybe if you feel OK,
            we can go moonlightin'

            damn it

                  Showers

            not enough
            time
            damn it

                  Toothpaste

            not enough
            flavors

            it's TIME WRITERS had different FLAVORS for their CRAYONS
            then maybe they would have TIME to make WHOOPIE
            or maybe they would have some MONEY with different COLORS
            damn it
