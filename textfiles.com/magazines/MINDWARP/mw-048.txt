                    10) Incredibly Spiffy!


        Hey folks, before I begin, I would like to point something really
nasty out.  If you remember back to Music Review #5, I noted that on the
Clerks soundtrack there was a really spiffy Alice in Chains song...WELL!
It turns out that song was already released (and I should have known this 
cuz I have the album it originally came out on) on the second EP they did 
called SAP.  BUY SAP, and forget the Clerks...  Now, back to your regularly
scheduled music review!



Band #1   
Name    : Megadeth 
Album   : Killing is my Business... and Business is Good!
Info.   : Wow.  I *think* this was Megadeth's very first release into the
          music community immediatly following Dave Mustaine's little
          incident with Metallica.  (He got kicked out.)  It's nothing
          special, unless you like old 80's HEAVY metal, but I really dig
          Megadeth, and I would highly recommend this one.  The most notable
          aspects of this album are the spiffy sound effects that pop up 
          before almost each song.  k-spiff.
                
                1) Last Rites/ Loved to Death         (9)
                2) Killing is my Business... and 
                   Business is Good!                  (10)
                3) Skull Beneath the Skin             (8)
                4) These Boots                        (8)

                6) Chosen Ones                        (6)
                7) Looking Down the Cross             (9)

Album   : Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?
Info.   : Yes!  I can almost remember the first time I sat in my home, late
          Saturday night, watching Ricky Rackmann, when there was still a
          Headbanger's Ball...and LOVING the Peace Sells video..  This is
          another k-spiff release from Megadeth...and it has two REALLY
          cool songs.  Peace Sells...and Good Mouring/Black Friday.  Gotta
          love it...(or I will KILL you.)
                
                1) Wake Up Dead                       (9)  
                2) The Conjuring                      (9)
                3) Peace Sells                        (11) *YES!*
                4) Devils Island                      (9)
                5) Good Mouring/Black Friday          (11) *YES!*
                6) Bad Omen                           (7)
                7) I Ain't Superstitous               (9)

          Yes folks, I have decided to do sort of a Megadeth theme this
          release...and I will NOW be telling you about this album.  Really
          cool cover art on this Cd, it's the Megadeth Skull Guy dresses up
          in army fatigues...YEAH!  The music rocks too.  They do a cool 
          cover of Anarchy in the UK, and they have a spiffy little
          instrumental as well.  BUY THIS ONE.
