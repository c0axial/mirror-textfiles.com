ninja-man bob on music:

Corm: The Conservation of Momentum 7"
(shute number 7 / dischord 98.75)

     DC's very own Corm does it again with their new 7": The
Conservation of Momentum.  3 new songs full of typical strong Corm
vocals, dynamic beats, and new sounds of brass.  Older Fugazi and
influence of Edsel come to mind.  The anticipation and eventual
execution of the solo breakdown in "Movie Actor Patrick" is almost
orgasmic.

Dead Kennedys: Give Me Convenience of Give Me Death
(alternative tentacles records)

     I don't know why you WOULDN'T have this album, especially if
you're a dk fan.  It has everything: reckless, carefree, FUCK-YOU
punk songs, satirical political bits, Biafra humor (he even tells
ya a STORY!), long songs, short songs, really short songs, and a
great deal of meaningful commentaries that most of you won't
absorb.  A great interpretation of "I fought the law" and even a
couple of live songs are included.
     Kinky sex makes the world go round, buy this album.
=================================================================
Nine Inch Nails: Further Down the Spiral
(halo ten)

     Decent, but definitely not up to par.  Compared to Fixed, the
mixes of BROKEN, these remixes (of songs off of The Downward
Spiral) are disgracefully uncompetitive.  Rick Rubin made Piggy
sound like house music (still rather energetic, but a lot more
upbeat) and Peter Christopherson/Coil threw in some of his strange
flavor on a couple of tracks, but I thought the highlight of the
whole album was the hard-edged, mechanical, industrial creation of
Aphex Twin: at the heart of it all.  My opinion: if you want some
good CURRENT mixes, buy halo 9: closer (don't be fooled! this cd-
single nears an hour of playtime and a whole lot better).
=================================================================
Pixies: Trompe le Monde
     
     I've never heard anything by this group that was any less than
spectacular and this album is definitely no exception.  Their
ingenuitive music set inspiration for countless contemporary bands,
and after listening to it, you'll know why.  From quick and catchy
pop songs of Black Francis to the compellingly mellow music
appropriately backed by the soothing voice of Kim Deal, I can
honestly say this is the best music I have ever bought for a buck. 
Of course, you can no longer purchase it for that price, but you
have your great modern radio stations to thank for that.
     Overall, very emotional music.. inspiring even.  Switching
moods like a fat woman does buffet plates, this music will have you
ready to take on the world in one moment, crying for your lover in
another, and then up and running again.  Perfect any occasion: buy
it, thank me l8r.
=================================================================
Jen Hitt: Music For the Royal Fireworks

     Wonderful local blastpop.  Very Velocity Girl with guitar that
hints early Billy Corgan.  Though containing some calming soft
spots, this tape possesses an aura of fun pop music.  Personally,
I hoped for more crazy beats from the bass-man, but definitely
worth the five dollars.  Watch for these crazy QOHS'ers ('cept
Tammy, the vocals: UMD for her) at a fine musical establishment
near you.
     Mail me if you're interested in future shows, new music, etc.
