X-mas 1995 December 21st

   I offered to bake Mom's traditional cookie dough--Nan's Russian Tea Balls
and Pank's Lace Cookies.  For years, Mom used to get rather tense around the
holidays.  We'd all offer to help with the endless chores, but she invariably
refused or, reluctantly gave in.  Nowadays, Mom is much more relaxed.
Yesterday, in an effort to help out, I took the cookie dough to Sara's new
apartment in Cockeysville to bake.  Needless to say, I left unmistakeable
signs (as usual, which is yet another story) that I had been in the kitchen.
Later, I'll go into detail about my popularity in that regard.
   Without the recipies, I went ahead and started to bake away.  I called Dad
and asked him to read me the recipe cards.  He only found the temperature for
the Lace cookies and he didn't give me the specifics on spacing and sizieng
of the cookie drops.  So, I went ahead and plopped 'um on the parchment paper
as Mom suggested.  First of all, Sara didn't have a timer, or a clock for
that matter (not to rationalize), in the facinity.  The first batch burnt
quite nicely and they all spread becomming one massive cookie blob.  I
thought perhaps I ought to rename them; at least this year's supply:
		 
Here, have some festive treats.... I baked some of Mom's traditional feast!!!

            Lace cookies?  Oh no, it's a lovely Lace Bake!
             It's crinkly and crumbly, toasted just right 
                      --a fine golden brown crisp--
                A colorful mosaic of buttery brown hues,  
             From a lovely light tan to a deep dark black.
                        Lace cookies? Heavens no!  
                    I've baked Mom's rich dough, into
                            Beautifully laced,
                         Burnt, Buttery, Crap!
