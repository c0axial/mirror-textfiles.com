*Untitled*
9/26/94

I sometimes think 
of electron paths
And particles too small to know
Coursing endlessly through silicon substrates
Messeners delivering their word
At the speed of light

I sometimes think
Of data streams
Carrying vast amounts of information
Ceaselessly flowing through the vast networks
That criscross our ever shrinking world

I sometimes think 
Of numbers too large to comprehend
And quantities no human can know
Quantities, that fly
From machine to machine
Their own cryptic language

I sometimes think
Of what lies beyond
This encoded world
Of things that can spring forth
From the patterns of ones and zeros

And I sometimes dream
Of how free it all can be
Information
passing from one mind to another
Only seconds away
Yet across the globe

And I sometimes see
How boundaries drop
How race and gender
And everything else that seperates
One mind from another
Loose meaning in this digital dream

And once again I dream
Of this freedom 
Of this place where 
You are judged only by what you say
And not who you are

And I sometimes i think I see
The paradigm about to shift
And open this world to everybody
Who would come

I invite all to come here
The assholes
The bigots
The politically correct
The leftist radicals
All those who will come

For this is a place of freedom
Information makes it free
Lack of boundaries makes it free
Diversity makes it free

But the most liberating thing of all
Is the anonimity
The facelessness
The lack of color
The lack of physical being
The wealth of oddity
The wealth of normality

And most of all
The wealth of freedom
