                         Mustaine's Music Review #3
                            [Mustaine/Influenza]

     For starters, some of you may have noticed I dropped the k-rad crap
in the title section.  The reason for this is...none of your business.  At
any rate, welcome to my third music review.  This one, I can personally
guarantee, will contain NO Pantera reviews.  I hate Pantera.  This one will 
contain several reviews on one of my favorite bands..Testament.  Anyways, 
here's my scale...following it will be the review..enjoy.

Band #1 : 
Name    : Testament
Members : Louie Clemente (Drums) 
          Eric Peterson  (Rhythm Guitar)
          Greg Christian (Bass)
          Alex Skolnick  (Lead Guitar)
          Chuck Billy    (Vocals)
Album   : The New Order
Info.   : This is not Testament's first album by a long shot, but it is
          totally rad.  I haven't been able to find many of their earlier
          CD's...and for a plug, I am willing to buy them if any of you folks
          want to get rid of your old Testament CD's.  You can reach me on
          Arsonist's Arsenal if you want to sell.  Back to the music though..
          This CD is really good thrash metal.  Every single song on this CD 
          is kewl.  I love em.  Here they are rated... 
          
               1) Eerie Inhabitants      *9
               2) The New Order          *10
               3) Trial By Fire          *10
               4) Into The Pit           *8
               5) Hypnosis               *9  (instrumental)
               6) Disciples of the Watch *10
               7) The Preacher           *10
               8) Nobody's Fault         *7
               9) A Day of Reckoning     *9
               10) Musical Death         *10 (instrumental)

          If you are a fan of Megadeth, or Exodus, old Dio, or even old
          Metallica, I would strongly reccomend checking these people out.
          Their instrumentals are phenomenal, and Chuck Billy's voice is 
          almost as eerie as Dave Mustaine's.

Band #2 :
Name    : Testament
Members : Louie Clemente (Drums) 
          Eric Peterson  (Rhythm Guitar)
          Greg Christian (Bass)

          Chuck Billy    (Vocals)
Album   : Practice What You Preach
Info    : This one was released in 1989, and in my opinion was not quite as 
          all around kewl as The New Order was.  Don't get me wrong..I AM
          talking all 9's and 10's..it just was different.  Here are the 
          songs rated.

               1) Practice What You Preach      *10
               2) Perilous Nation               *9
               3) Envy Life                     *10
               4) Time Is Coming                *9
               5) Blessed In Contempt           *9
               6) Greenhouse Effect             *10
               7) Sins Of Omission              *10
               8) The Ballad                    * F*cking 11!!
               9) Nightmare(Coming Back To You) *9 
               10) Confusion Fusion             *10 (instrumental)

Band #3 :                              
Name    : Testament
Members : Louie Clemente (Drums) 
          Eric Peterson  (Rhythm Guitar)
          Greg Christian (Bass)
          Alex Skolnick  (Lead Guitar)
          Chuck Billy    (Vocals)
Albumn  : Souls Of Black
Info    : Yes!  1990 came, Souls Of Black was released...and I LOVED it.  It 
          was just like The New Order with its intensity..but BETTER.  Souls
          Of Black..the song totally ROCKS.  Seven Days of May was a 
          commentary on the Red Square incident.  This CD blew everything in 
          the metal category away.  If you get any of their albums...this is 
          definitely in the top two list.  Here are the songs rated.

               1) Beginning Of The End  *10 (instrumental)
               2) Face In The Sky       *10
               3) Falling Fast          *10
               4) Souls Of Black        * F*cking 11!!
               5) Absence Of Light      *9
               6) Love To Hate          *9
               7) Malpractice           *10
               8) One Man's Fate        *10
               9) The Legacy            * F*cking 11!!
               10) Seven Days Of May    *10

          This album IS really, really good.  Buy it.  If you hate it you 
          suck big hairy monkey dick dripping with sour lemon juice.  And you
          pick your butt with a shoehorn.  Start loving this album.  Or I'll 
          get Dorothy and the Tin Man to rape your dog.

Band #4 :
Name    : Testament
Members : Louie Clemente (Drums) 
          Eric Peterson  (Rhythm Guitar)
          Greg Christian (Bass)
          Alex Skolnick  (Lead Guitar)
          Chuck Billy    (Vocals)
Album   : The Ritual                              
Info    : Uh..yeah.  They released The Ritual in 1992 and I was slightly in
          shock.  Don't get me wrong...the album rocks.  The format in this
          album changed slightly. The music seems now more refined.  The 
          metal is still burning with that hellish acidic sound...but now 
          it's like maybe they went and took lessons.  It is most likely that
          they are just getting older.  Doesn't really make a difference
          though...the album is killer.  Buy it.  Here are the songs rated.

               1) Signs of Chaos      *10 (instrumental)
               2) Electric Crown      *10
               3) So Many Lies        * F*cking 11!!
               4) Let Go Of My World  *10
               5) The Ritual          *10 (This is the funky weird one.)
               6) Deadline            *9
               7) As The Seasons Grey *10
               8) Agony               * F*cking 11!! YES YES YES!!
               9) The Sermon          *9
               10) Return to Serenity *10 (Another weird one.  But GREAT!)
               11) Troubled Dreams    * F*cking 11!! 

          Well, I could rap up and review their latest album, Return To The
          Apocalyptic City...but I won't.  Needless to say that album is full
          of live cuts...and a different version of Return to Serenity off of
          The Ritual.  I hated my intro review for this album, so I think I
          am gonna say some more.  The Ritual is a really good album. 
          However, after listening to Testament's music for so long..I can
          definitly say SOMETHING has changed since Souls of Black.  I have
          yet to decide whether or not I like this change..but the music still
          rocks so go out and buy it.  Or I'll personally come to your house
          and rip off your reproductive organs.  Maybe not personally..but 
          you get the picture.

                              
                              
     That's about it for this review...I hope you like it.  If not... well
     then f*ck you.  And f*ck your little dog too.  Be waiting for my next
     few reviews...I think review Numbah 5 will be a Megadeth special.  As
     for next time...who the hell knows?  Seeya.
