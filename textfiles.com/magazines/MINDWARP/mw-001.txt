        I think too much.  (well, some of my High School teachers will argue
that statement, but screw them)  I find myself scared by some of the things 
that I laugh at inside, and by some of the things that I'd LOVE to do.       
Unfortunately, I'm not as cool and fucked up in the head as some other       
computer-writers are, to actually claim to do these things, I just think     
about 'em...                                                                 
                                                                             
The Good Son: This was a stupid film about a little kid who like killed      
            people.  But there was one scene in the film, where the kid was  
            holding another kid by the arm, on a tree house at about a 50ft  
            height, and the kid said, "If I let you go, You think you could  
            fly?"  I cracked up when I heard that, I thought it was the most 
            hilarious thing I had ever heard, And I had a sudden urge to go  
            abduct small children, and hang them off of a bridge, and tell  
            them that line, and then laugh an incredibly maniacal laugh, then 
            pull them up, and let em run home crying, hoping that they'd then 
            be mentally screwed for the rest of their existance.            
                                                                            
Escalators: As my fellow EoS members know, when walking down stairs, or riding
            down an escalator, I like to imagine kicking the person in front
            of me, square in the back of their head, and watching their body
            tumble down, head first, the rest of the elevator.  The only thing
            that prevents me from doing this, is the fear that the person   
            behind me is thinking the same exact thing, and then I start to 
            hold on to the railing tighter.                                 
                                                                            
Suicide:    Heh, Kinda like the "Jeremy" video by (blegh) Pearl Jam.  Where at
            the end, Jeremy pulls out a gun and shoots himself.  That's the 
            best way to kill yourself, not only are you ending your life, but
            hopefully, when you've splattered your brains upon your class-
            mates, it screws them up, and they'll continue to seek psycholog-
            ical help twenty years later.                                   
                                                                             
My Parents: The fact that sometimes I can actually relate with my parents.  
                                                                             
Movies Theatres: When I go to the movies, and some 7ft tall schmuck sits down 
            in front of me, I feel like pulling out my lighter, and roasting
            his head, and then sitting back and laughing as the guy runs  
            around screaming, with a big flaming head.. haha..              
                                                                             
Public Restrooms: While I'm standing at a urinal, and noone else is around, I
            glance downwards, by the stall doors, and if there is someone in 
            there, with their pants obviously pulled down to their ankles, I 
            have to keep myself from going and getting a big handful of those
            nasty brown paper towel things, roll them up into a kind of ball,
            and light it, and just as the thing is almost egulfed enough in
            flames to burn my hand, throw it over the stall door, into the 
            guy's lap, or into his pulled-down pants.  haugh..
                                                                            
Annoying Kid: While I was walking thru the mall, a little whiney, bratty 4
            year old kid, was crying to his mother, and yelling and carrying 
            on about god knows what, and the mother didn't do anything, she
            just ignored him, while the rest of the mall cringed at the sound
            of the little pest.  I figured out, that I could shut the little
            shit up by grabbing the mom by her hair, slamming her fucking head 
            into the wall as hard as I possibly could, and then, still with a 
            good grip on her, jam her face (preferably the eye region) into a 
            nearby water fountain (the faucet part, that sticks up), hopefully 
            causing the faucet to go into her eye, and back into her brain, 
            and then, turn her head over, pull out her semi-squashed eye-ball, 
            walk over to the brat, and stick it in his mouth.  But to be sure 
            he stayed quiet, I'd pick him up by his chin (so to cause a 
            helluva lot of pain, and to make sure that he couldn't spit out 
            his mom's eyeball), and throw him as far as possible.  heh.
