                         Excuses to Get Out of Class

        What?  Another stupid list of ideas?  Yup, this time, I've got
idiotic excuses to get out of class (many of which I have tried, some of
which actually worked...).  Enjoy.

1) "I'm having female problems." (works for guys, too)

2) "I think I'm having a flashback, 'cause there's this ugly demon sitting
    at my desk, and I'm scared.  Can I go to the Substance Abuse Counselor?"

3) "I just got through 'talking' to my girlfriend, and now I've got blue
    balls, can I go to the bathroom to (ahem) fix this?"

4) "Can I go to my counselor to see about changing classes?  The chick who
   sits in front of me is giving me wood, and I'm much too well hung for it
   to go un-noticed."

5) "Can I go to the bathroom?  I forgot to wipe..."

6) "I just smoked a fat blunt, can I go to the nurse for eye drops?"

7) "I just smoked a gram of crack, GIMME A PASS, BITCH!"

8) "I need to go ask my health teacher where I can purchase extra-large
   condoms at.."

9) "I need to go ask my health teacher where I can purchase petite condoms
   at.."

10) Put your hand over your mouth, inflate your cheeks, and run out of class
    like you're gonna spew.  Don't forget gagging noises.  Go back to class
    ten minutes later, apologize, and ask for a pass to the nurse.

If all else fails, play the race card:

"You won't gimme a pass because I'm (fill in ethnic backgroud here)!  I'm
 gonna sue!"
