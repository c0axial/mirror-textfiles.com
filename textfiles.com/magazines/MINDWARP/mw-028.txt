                    Tricks to do with Lighters and Cigarettes 
                                  [raven/MG]

1.  Sparkling Cigarette: get a lighter, and gently turn the ignition wheel,
    just enough so that it doesn't make a spark, but that it scrapes off 
    small pieces of flint.  Do this over top of your cigarette box (box, not 
    softpack).  Now, once you have a decent amount of black, flint dust(not 
    too much, just a little), lick your cigarette, and roll it in the flint 
    dust. Now, go outside at night, and light up, the cigarette will sparkle 
    all nice and pretty.

2.  Breathing Fire: take a disposable butane lighter, and jam it in your 
    mouth! Now, push the little red button (hopefully you're bright enough 
    not to use an electric ignition lighter) with your thumb that is also 
    stuck in your mouth.  Wait a couple seconds, and when you fill your mouth 
    is full, quickly pull the lighter out (making sure not to much butane 
    comes out), light it, hold it in front of your mouth, and open your mouth
    wide, while breathing a big deep breathe out.  If you did it right, 
    you'll see a big flame appear in front of your face.  Warning: this is 
    best done inside, and do not inhale the butane, or you might have your 
    lungs combust. (ooh fun-fun)

3.  The "Seven Drags from a Cig" Bet: Ok, go up to someone, and take THEIR
    cigarette.  Tell them, "I bet you 5 bucks that I can take seven drags off
    this cigarette without it going down over 1mm."  If you actually find
    someone stupid enough to take such a type of bet, then go at it, if they
    don't take the bet, then do it anyway, it's their cig.  Here's what you 
    do: light the cigarette in the side of the middle.  that's it, now take 7 
    drags from it, and collect your money, or finish off the cig.

4.  Exploding Cigarette: This takes some of work (stressful work).  Take a 
    fire cracker, rip the fuse off quite short, and unwrap and tear off some 
    of the paper on it, so it's a little thinner.  Then take a strip of paper
    that's as wide as the fire cracker is long, and wrinkle it up.  Once the
    paper is nice and wrinkled, wrap it around the fire cracker, so that it's
    roughly the same diameter as a cigarette.  Now, the hard part.  Take a
    cigarette, and use some thin tweezers or something to pull the tobacco
    out of the paper, being as careful as possible not to tear and wrinkle 
    the paper too much.  Once you have pulled out all of the tobacco, slide
    the wrapped fire cracker into the empty cigarette as carefully as you 
    can, with the fuse sticking towards the end of the cigarette.  The 
    wrinkled paper is there to add volume and to give it a soft feel.  Now, 
    the OTHER hard part :)  Try to pack the tobacco in as best you can, it's
    not easy at all.  Now, when someone asks you for a cigarette, give them
    that one, and say that it's been in your shirt pocket all day.  This is
    quite mean, if it doesn't injure their eyes, then it will at least make
    them deaf for quite a while, and sting their fingers pretty badly.

5.  Flame thrower lighters:  Umm.. I was watching a movie when I was about 
    ten that had this pyro dude that had this bitchin lighter that went up to
    about an 8 inch flame.  And when I was 13 I figured out how to do this.
    First off, you need one of those cheep ADJUSTABLE, disposable lighters.
    It has to be adjustable.  Now, pop off that little piece of metal that
    guards the flame.  You'll see the adjuster which is a little circular 
    piece of plastic that is around another piece of plastic.  Turn the thing
    to HIGH, now, lift up the adjuster piece of plastic, so that it's
    disconnected from the other one.  Now, turn it to LOW, and place it back
    down around the other piece of plastic.  Now put the little metal thing
    back on, and flick yo' bic! (well, figuratively, BIC doesn't make
    adjustable lighters unfortunately)  When you turn your lighter to HIGH, 
    it will now be a big-assed flame that shoots out.  

Now go out there and have phun amazing your smoking buddies at what k-cool
things you can do while getting cancer!
