Band #1   
Name    : Yes 
Album   : 90125 (no, it ain't beverly hills..)
Info.   : WOO!  Like this is a kewl 70's band, back in the 80's...well now
          it's the 90's..but who cares, eh?.  It's just really cool.
          The song "Owner of a lonely heart gets ya into the CD...then it
          sucks for a while...then it get's kewl with "Changes"...then it
          sucks some more...then you get pissed off cuz u bought it without
          reading my review...so you didn't know it sucked!  HAHAHHAHAHA
          Here are the songs...in order.  If you buy this, you either like
          Yes, or you just wanne be kewl like me.

                1) Owner of A Lonely Heart  *10
                2) Hold On                  *05
                3) It Can Happen            *05
                4) Changes                  *10
                5) Cinema                   *05?????

           I am kewl.  I must say.  That, or I am really stupid for
           typing this far without getting pissed off and blowing up my
           computer.  I hope it's the previous..and not the latter.

Band #2 
Name    : The Police
Album   : Message In A Box (Box Set)
Info.   : Good GOD man!  If you like the Police, this is the box set to
          get!!  It includes everything they ever released while they were
          together, plus a few live cuts.  Not to mention the nifty info-
          pullout that's wedged in between the FOUR CD's... DAMN!  I
          don't even have to rate this one, it rocks for Police fans!!!!
          (Add to that fact that there are something like 50+ songs for me
          to rate, and keeping in mind that I am lazy, you can clearly see 
          why I refuse to list all the songs...sorry!)

Band #3
Name    : Testament
Album   : Low
Info.   : Wow.  No Alex Skolnick this time around, apparently he left for
          some other projects.  That sucks in my opinion...because the only
          people that are going to suffer are the members of Testament.  His
          guitar sounds was so unique I can't belive they let him go!  
          N-E-Way.  This album is really, really, really, really, good.  In
          fact, this is one of the best metal albums I have heard so far this
          year.  Here are the songs, rated for your pleasure!

                1) Low                 (3:33)  *10
                2) Legions (In Hiding) (4:17)  *10 
                3) Hail Mary           (3:32)  *09
                4) Trail of Tears      (6:06)  *11 (Very nice slow, metal!)
                5) Shades of War       (4:40)  *08
                6) P.C.                (2:50)  *08
                7) Dog Faced Gods      (4:02)  *08
                8) All I Could Bleed   (3:37)  *09
                9) Urotsukidoji        (3:39)  *10 (Instrumental)
               10) Chasing Fear        (4:56)  *10
               11) Ride                (3:06)  *09
               12) Last Call           (2:40)  *10 (Instrumental)


          Testament has always been one of my favorite heavy metal bands.
          They always manage to put in one or two songs that are slow, and
          usually they put in some really interesting instrumental pieces.
          I really reccommend checking at least one of their albums out at
          some point in your life.  Tower Records has this thing where you
          can listen before you buy...try one out some time, eh?

Band #4
Name    : Numerous!
Album   : The Clerks Soundtrack
Info.   : Ok, this soundtrack is nothing special, excepting the fact that it
          has a really neat Alice In Chains song, and some really cool 10 
          second clips from the movie that are really funny.  Half of them
          are great little clips to record on an answering machine.  Please
          note that one of my most favorite bands (Stabbing Westward) is
          also favored on this track.  Unfortunately, they recorded a REALLY
          bad verison of Violent Mood Swings (called the 'Thread Mix') which
          totally made the WHOLE band look like rabbit dung.  <sigh>  Here
          are the songs...enjoy.

                2) Clerks                 *05
                3) Kill the Sex Players   *06
                5) Got Me Wrong           *10
                7) Making Me Sick         *05
                9) Chewbacca              *08
               10) Panic in Cicero        *05
               11) Shooting Star          *05
               12) Leaders and Followers  *04
               14) Violent Mood Swings    *07 (ONLY because of who they are!)
               15) Berserker              *04
               16) Big Problem            *05
               17) Go Your Own Way        *LAME!
               19) Can't Even Tell        *01


        Welpers, that's all folks.  I'm off to bigger and better things.
I'm off to Valentine's day.  Valentine's day....sigh. Oh well.
