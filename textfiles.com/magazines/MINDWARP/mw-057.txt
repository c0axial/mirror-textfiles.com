Midnight Blues
4th chorus(?)

alone
tired
aimless
but somehow happy

the beach looms
like a sunrise
dead ahead
monday night
i will lay my head on the sand
in alyson:
not a girlfriend
not yet a friend
but at least an outlet
with substance
not like you:
the anonymous reader

in my mind's I:
a calm
peacefull knowing
that things will happen
someday

in burroughs:
a teacher
a direction for life
knowledge, free from
the 13 channels of shit
on the TV to choose from
          to choose from
          to choose from

knowing
i cant end in allusion
and that the show is over
i look forward
to sand between my toes

that's something from last summer.  I've been searching my HD for something I 
wrote on another bbs and I'm pretty sure I logged, but I can't find it.  I've 
been finding all this stuff I just wrote and stuck away (I'll keep looking 
too.)  I have another poem that I wrote to the alyson in the 3rd stanza of 
this poem.  we corresponded for a while thorugh e-mail, she was in a torrid 
love affair, it sounded intense and true (as in true forever love that is) and 
one day as the situation got more and more intense (her b-friend running away 
from home, them talking about just running away together, .....)she stopped 
writing.
i guess she did finally run away with him or something.  who knows, anyway
it's a great thing to wonder about.  anyway, I might as well get on to than 
next poem.  if this works, here it is:

Improv poetry on a dirty sunday night -- fall '94

Open those wings and fly through my mind
with you inbetween them 
You
a traveler
and I am but another wasted land
a desert of a million thoughts
dry and dusty as saharan sand
but pick up a grain of thought
after you land your satin feet in my head and fold your velvet wings to your
               side
That grain, up close, is a little yellow diamond.
worthless but beautifull
and nothing compared to the rest.
You sit and stare awhile
     at the sand
          remembering days at the beach with sand between your toes and love
in your eyes.

I may never see your eyes
     or touch your soft brown hair
          or hold your hand
       but I know you better now
     and forever
than all those who see you in the halls
     and most who have brushed your soft brown hair
          and some who hold your hand.

So fly on, 
through a million minds and a million wasted lands
but always remember
you have my sand between your toes

----
and I guess to finish the story she did fly on, and I'll run into her 
sometime and we'll both be shocked and talk for hours and she'll introduce 
me too her true love of twenty years whom she ran away with.  or something.  
but there are two poems.  I may write more tonight.  who knows.
