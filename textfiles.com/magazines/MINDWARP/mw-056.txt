"Sheep"

oh, sheep,
walking through the green pasture,
where is your goddess?
is she lying on the floor?
does she fly overhead?
is she playing chess?

oh sheep:
walking through the green pasture,
and not a care in the world...except lunch.
you never question, do you?
the grass will always be there,
right?
and you'll live your simple life,
and the most joy you'll ever feel...is when you eat lunch.

o, sheep,
walking through the green pasture;
sheared or slaughtered, you'll still be you:
a sheep.
always a sheep
searching for a goddess

"Wool"


wool

itches my skin
no choice
but one

the wool has me
enclosed like in a womb
the wool owns me
we are one and the same

wool

warm at night
hot during the day

wool

must stop
must stop
NO

wool

can't take it
heat intolerable
no choice
but one

wool

set on fire
charred ashes
now i am
     no
       longer
