                                Untitled Poem
                             [Mustaine/Influenza]


     This was originally posted on Friday March 11, 10:31pm 1994 on the 
"C-I-L-L My Landlord: Poetry Sub" on Arsonist's Arsenal (301)-208-0847.  At
the time I had just been informed that I would NOT be going to my senior prom 
with the date I had originally selected.  It turned out that XXXXXXX had done 
poorly on her third semester report card, and her parents had frowned on her 
spending time getting ready for a huge dance.  I was massively depressed, 
(and feeling slightly vindictive) so I wrote this untitled poem featured 
below.  It really did not stay on topic with the events that had happened, 
however I just had the craving to write so out it came.  Enjoy.

         
                               (uNTiTLeD...)
         
                          And then the sea fell,
                           and the sky rose...
                           My heart was ladden
                           With grief and woes.

                             For if not love,
                           then must it be hate?
                          Why not her love today?
                               Except fate...

                        SO bring on the morning day,
                          and let the sun freeze,
                        Let the world slowly decay,
                 For in the end, she'll still hate ya d00d.
