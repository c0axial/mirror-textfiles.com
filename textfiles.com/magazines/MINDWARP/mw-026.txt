                             Mind Warp! Index #2
                                 [Raven/EoS]
                              June-August 1994

        Ok, Welp this is our second volume of files.  And Mustaine is getting
more and more obnoxious <g>.  This time he's gone and insulted the editor of
another zine (oi vey.. a zine that I happen to like, but of course, I like 
all zines :).  Anyway, please keep reading to find out how (and where) to
send Mustaine Hate Mail.

So far, the current people involved in this effort are:

   Raven      : Writer / Editor
   Catwoman   : Writer / Editor / Proofreader
   Mustaine   : Writer / (wierd) k-rad d00d
   Dark Horse : Writer (Poet) / Editor
   Buckwheat  : Writer (O-TAY!)

..and we hope that the list will continue to grow.

        I am VERY proud to introduce two(2) new writers in this volume!  Dark
Horse, who is an EXCELLENT writer, and an EXCELLENT editor (made him an
editor, cuz he has/had(???) his own zine, and most likely knows a helluva lot
more about this than myself :), and is also a great SysOp.. (give him a call:
The Omniverse @ (301) 718-0225 - a vast cauldron of drug information (yay!))
Also, we've got Buckwheat (uh what can say? uh.. ;)  Oh! and Catwoman FINALLY
wrote something! :)  A TON of thanks to all those who wrote and helped...

        As it is, we currently don't have a mailing list, but I'd be glad to
take your e-mail address down, and send the next volume out to each of you
by hand.  I can be contacted at mindwarp@aa.bbs.org on the internet, or 
#1@3111 on IceNET.  Or, you could call up my board (see the end of the file), 
and download it from there.  The same goes when submitting an article. E-mail 
it to me at one of those, or call my board and e-mail it to me, or upload it.
        The following is the Mind Warp! PGP key.  It isn't required that you
encrypt your mail or your submissions, but it would be greatly appreciated if
you would encrypt all submissions, and if possible encrypt any other mail,
even if it's not an important piece of mail, it's still nice to show support
for public encryption (Die, Clipper Chip, DIE!).

        Please send all of your Mustaine Hate Mail to either address as well.
We know you want to send it.  Hate mail will be sent to him, and it will be 
published (with a reply) in a future issue. :)
        
        As of now, we also don't have any real distribution sites, either. 
So, if you're interested, e-mail away.  With Mustaine's help, though, we
should be getting an anonymous FTP site for the zine.  Also, if I can't get
access to a listserver to create a mailing list, then I'll try and program
my own friggin mailing-list server for my domain.  

*****************************************************************************
        Some info on sPHeAr digizine, which was headed by Signal:
It seems that Signal will NOT be coming into the hack/phreak scene for 
reasons unknown to myself, for a while.  Control of the Sphear zine has been
handed to Mustaine, who should be working with it if he ever gets off his
lazy butt.  For more info, please contact Mustaine (for I myself am somewhat
in the dark as to what happened).  
*****************************************************************************

        Distribution info:  Please, distribute these all you want, but just
keep the files in format of MW!-XXX.TXT where XXX is a the file number that
is already on there.  Also, if the file is archived, please keep it in the
same format, except for the .TXT extension which should be replaced by the 
default extension of the archiving program (ex. ZIP,ARC,ZOO,ARJ,LZH, etc..).
And the other format of distribution (and probably now the MAIN format) is 
in the form of MW!-VXX.AAA, where XX is the volume number, and AAA is the
default archive extension.  This method will contain all of the issues of one
volume in a single archive.
Thanks.
