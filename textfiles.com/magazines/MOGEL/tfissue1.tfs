Your BasiK FedS are allowed to chase down the bbsz in the area to keep
the eleet heads off the scene.Cover Your ass. this is how to protect your bbs
from any charges that maybe forced on said bbs' staff.First thing is make
one of your application questions ... this and this exactly 
"Are you in anyway connected to Law Enforcment,Federal Agencies or Private
invs. services, parties. that legel binds em in court.... if they lie about
and make sure that its known that liarsw of info have no right to anything
to do with the bbs. then if it gets to court if their right to any info 
obtained is null/void. also Make a bulletin which expresses that if a user(s)
reads this and does not send email saying they disagree to it then they are
considered in agreement. and in the bulletin state "That at logon without
disagreeing a user forfeits his right to tell,explain, devulge any information
about the bbs of any nature to local,federal,private law enforcing or 
investigation agencies,parties or servicies. Now! big thing is.
Lets say a fed comes on ... dont delete em .... dont worry. They're are some
walkin fedz .... let em on ... at your shareware access.
email them saying account is only good for 1 week do to the nature of this 
PRIVATE BBs. always include that your a priavte and not public bbs so you can 
reserve the right to rake and grant access levels and sort from and to users.
NeXt is alwayz have a good copy of what the hell is going on out there fed
wise... once and while someone will upload to the other bbs in the area or 
maybe yourz the list of fedz they know of .... hold on to each update.
Also ... you can do as i did and have this notized by JD&F Law Associates for
20 bucks.... your bulletin and shit, it rulez, then your toally covered
becuase its a binding contract and not just a Verbal type Agreement.
Thankz for the time ....
and Dont FaLL
