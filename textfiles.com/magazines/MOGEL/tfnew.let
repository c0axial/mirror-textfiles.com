wElK0Me ..  to the ..  tF newletter ..

HEY!  What is this?  This shit is Mogel!  Where's my buddy Uslurper/God(+d)?!
Well, you see, this is the thing.  I was in this k-k00l k0ference wiFF a
whole bunch of rad's the other day and we decided that we really wanted
to help God(-d+d) out.  You see, GodDdD is the most important and powerful
person in the 215 *AND* <gasp> 610 area codes and it just bothered us.

What bothered us was that when yer as 'k' as GoDddD is, then it must be
really *REALLY* hard to put out a rADDd group like tF.  Beyond that, GoDD
had a very busy schedule.  You see, his parents have recently discovered
that he had been using his "personal" line for quite a while as a BBS
life...er, I mean line.  So anyhow, his parents THEN discovered that for
some reason strange things began to happen to their phone line...and they
we're being charged for a series of AT&T conferences (there is DEFINTALY
no correlation to the above-formentioned conference... I assure you ;>).

*THEN* goDDdD''z parents discovered that he had run into quite a few people
that didn't like what he was doing (d00difing the h/p scene even MORE than
already it already is).  Anyhow, because GodD had become so busy, we realized
he had no time to put out the next release for his group teXt fORcAStERS.
Instead of letting such a incredibly talented group die (I mean who could
ever forget the infamous "t0p 10 rE4sOns tO nOt KaLL a pEEdEE bOarD"), we
decided to write the next release for him.  We're don't need any thanks from
GoddD because doing this for him was plenty enough.  It's time for us all to
reflect on what GoDD had done for our lifes.

Mogel: "GodDd has shown me that there REALLY is a TRUE moron out there.
        That's a lesson I'll never forget.  Whenever I feel that there
        SHOULD be total freedom of information... I remember GoDDd and
        clasp my heart and thank god (the other one) for my SysOp
        User-delete fuction! bOO-yAh!"

Dark Phiber: "Well Godd has been a really good sport about this. And so have 
              his parents. They seem to like us very much and will sit and
              chat with us for hours because they have no lives. Well first
              we started just making a bunch of accounts on Godd's BBS. Then
              we started calling at hours of the night and making prank
              calls. Finally we had some real fun and rerouted Godd's BBS
              number to the Secret Service in Philadelphia. Finally Godd
              had a passcode put on his phone account so we can't change it
              anymore. We've talked to Godd on a few teleconferences and we
              are even being nice enough to release a pak for his group Text
              Forecasters. We even had Godd on a couple of conferences and
              had him tell us how cool we really are."

"pbiber, hey this is the eternal d! whats up man? i like you TF thing but

being as it was all problemed doing... anywayz... i just wanted to say
yello, and uhh ... well maybe next weekend you can check out my telecon i
will have up....i will email the details anyway but .... thanks man sorry
about rippings yaz that time it was outta line cuz you had already explained

"DEAR PEOPLE!
This is Godd DA DA! DA DA .....
i wonna make the announcement that the text forcastors thing
released under the name TF2-95.zip IS NOT mine....
nor will any other files under that name be mine.....
i never write any actual files for it..... i only mentioned 
that as a name for group to a few people a month or so back....
i belived it was PROBLEMED, being as he started my past 
problems... Futhermore i wonna Apologize for what i said about 
CAFBL that long time ago to DP, becuase he had made it clear 
he had no problem with me previous to the writing of my hate 
mail...... now.... i wonna thank for you time.... and i guess thats it...."

"but you can docotr anything you want i was never in TF!... as for grave
digger like i said he jumps on the band wagon of whatever is up for now....
which is better than what i do, at least as far you you go, i might act like
a moron but i do my best ot clean up any mess' i make.... i never pick
anyone for a serious attack, usually, though i aint as lame as some might
think... perhaps my lash out on you has made you non-understanding of the
situation... i have no problem with anyone in the area code... lest you
consider my past... but all in all i have seriously cleaned up what i have
done and made all around good relations..... so as far as what most want to
think about my story (the truth) or this whole situation i dont really
care.... i mean i know this may seen blurred and not very informative but...
thats what its supposed to do isnt it.... each action that seems to come
next from me a lil more and more unpredicable.... probably DO OT the fact
that i aint doing em... why would i starte a war with CAFBL... and mogel i
have never said anything but sorry's and thank you's to you!... as long as i
see no reason to fight..."

Mogel's Goodbye Message:

  So now, humble reader...you can see who GoDDDddD is.   You can also see
how much delight we took in creating this throughly redundant file that will
beacon a new age of wisdom.  There are no Mogel Minions and Cafbl is not the
modem mafia...we just really can't stand obnoxious morons.  GoDD [Usurper] is
now the official 215 Mascot!  Another note, GoDD didn't know what '/<-RaD'
even was and used the word a lot.  I discovered in chatting with him that he
actually didn't know what it meant, but "was always used negatively".  Heh.
