mindflow #1 ascii version
05.25.94
edited and programmed by josh ruihley
mindflow #1 is the first attempt at getting different thoughts from people
acrossed the country and putting them together in a nice little
file.  these thoughts can be in the form of a poem, short story, brainstorm
or any other kind of self expression that can be put on a computer.
the purpose is to create a nice little mind trip that people can take once
a month.  it features different views from different people on different
subjects.  all that is needed to take these trips is an open mind, so open up
your mind, and enjoy. if you would like to submit something to be printed in
future versions of mindflow, please either mail or email me.  mindflow will
not work if it isn't for 'thought donations', so if you have something that
you would like to be put in here, please, donate your thoughts and make
mindflow a trip worth taking.

all versions of mindflow can be downloaded for free from:

too basic   by paul kell------------------------------------------------------

two basic emotions
two basic fears
two basic eyes
shedding two basic tears
two basic hearts
two basic souls
a story of love
as our story unfolds

they were two basic friends
with two basic minds
their friendship was one
too basic to find
too lost in emotions
too lost in their fears
too lost in their eyes
and too lost in their tears

one basic body
one basic mind
set apart from the world
unfeeling, unkind
not feeling the love
only feeling the fear
persecuted by many
persecuted by peers

from two basic persons
united as one
separated forever
they both have no one

wish        by josh ruihley---------------------------------------------------

i threw the penny in the wishing well
my hopes and dreams needed still to come true
the penny fell and the water splashed
the well one cent closer to purchasing heaven
and me one cent closer to foreclosing on hell
but the birds dont bother me one bit
the grass is still green and the sky is still blue
and i am still nothing cause im without you




Untitled    by Matt Williamson------------------------------------------------

The overwhelming dark flood
         of
  smoke caught us
        off
 Guard.

 Help! someone screamed
       as
   I hovered over
     the
 Fire.

The toxic fumes were
    pleasant
 To my primitive
    senses.

My time was up -
      Destruction done
  Time to leave
    Manifest.
 My essence in the Floating
           ash.

To be scattered across
  the land
  of human fraility




The Girl Who Lived Here Before  by Melissa Pike-------------------------------

The horses keep falling;
I guess she likes the dolls better,
because she never bothered them.
It must be a little girl
Who hated living on this farm.
My sister is afraid for her horses;
Their plastic legs don't hold up well
to falling six feet
The floor's not very soft.
Maybe we should put something there
for them-- some pillows or something.
I think the girl will get uses to the horses;
she must learn that things change.
She must have been spoiled
and rich from the looks of this house.
I wonder what her name is and
what happened to her.
Maybe it had something to do with
horses.
And why is she still here?
She must be lonely.
Sometimes I hear her crying in the night.
I would be her friend
if only I could find her.
I must look in the yard.
The stones will reveal her to me.




Inside      by Andy Malloy----------------------------------------------------

looking inside
i see the blackness
a Void
i can remember,
there was a heart there...
once...
long ago...
it was stolen
and never replaced...




Untitled    by Betsy Hughes---------------------------------------------------

i look about me
and everywhere i see
what i could have been
misconceptions linger on the ground
where i have dropped them

the visions of my dream of success
float quietly across the walls
out of my reach
or just too quick for me to catch
i grasp one suddenly, hold on, then let go.




Psycho Disco Ninjo      by Brad Wright----------------------------------------

   Bzzzzzt.
   Bzzzzzt.
   Bzzz -- SMASH!
   Billy managed a moan of contempt for the alarm clock as another Monday
started.
   "Boy, I hate Mondays."
   Billy rose from his bed, if a mass of covers and blankets on a couple
pieces of wood is a bed.  In his early morning stupor, even the mild-mannered
wallpaper seemed to scream at him.
   "Billy!  Get your scrawny butt in the shower!"
   Billy blinked several times before he realized the wallpaper was, in fact,
not talking.  It was only his slightly demented and completely crazy and evil
step-mother.
   "Whatever, Sherona!" Billy sighed, as he lumbered towards the bathroom.
The hallway was full of little dolls and little cars and dog poop.
   "ARGH!  When is anyone besides me going to clean up for this filthy
animal?!?" Billy screamed, getting no reply.  But today was going to be
different, he decided.  No more letting people walk all over him.  No more
taking flak from schoolmates.  No more -- SPLAT.
   "I just stepped in a DOG TURD!!!"
   "Well pick it up, duh, stoooopid," came the low reply from around the
corner.
   Billy rounded the corner to see his little sister, Cindy.  Cindy was
wearing her My Little Pony pajamas and waggling her tongue at him.
   "Santa Claus isn't real, ya know," Billy muttered, just loud enough to be
sure the rugrat heard him.  Tears filled Cindy's eyes, and a low moan started
to eminate from her.
   "MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMOM!!!" Cindy shrieked.  "BILLY SAID --"
   Billy slammed a fist into Cindy's midsection, ending her yelp in mid-
breath.  Cindy looked up, startled.
   "B-b-billy..." she whispered.  "W-w-w-why-dj-ja d-d-do th-that f-for?"
   Billy stared down at her with molten eyes.  "Listen, munchkin.  Dad and
Scum-ona have been giving me crap since I kicked the dog down the stairs
after it bit my knee.  Now, we aren't going to say a word to Dad and --"
   "BIIIIIILLY!!!  ARE YOU READY FOR SCHOOL YEEEET?!?"
   "SHUT UP, SCUM-ONA!!!" Billy yelled down the stairs.
   "WHAT?!?"
   "I SAID, NOT YET, SHERONA, PRINCESS!"
   "BULLCRAP!  GET IN THE SHOWER, OR I'LL BEAT YOU SILLY!"
   Billy sighed, and went into the bathroom, which, by some grace of God, was
actually empty.  Billy stumbled in, and looked at his dejected form in the
mirror.
   Billy was always a small boy, until eighth grade, when he grew ten inches
over three months.  Still, he was slight at 5'11", 140 pounds.  With brown
hair and green eyes, he was an almost mirror image of his father.  From the
day he was the born (not the night, but the day, mind you), we knew he was
trouble (not monopoly, but trouble).  Billy jumped in the shower, and bathed
quickly, knowing if he took too long, he would have to deal with She-Man
Sherona.
   After putting on a t-shirt and pair of blue jeans, Billy weaved his way in
and out of toys and other miscellaneous mishaps waiting to happen on the
'Stairs of Doom', and grabbed his bookbag and a Pop-Tart on his way out the
door.
   "BILLY!  GET BACK IN HERE AND --" started Sherona, whining/screaming as
usual.
   "Cram it, freak!" he yelled back, and started off to school.


   Bzzzzzt.
   Bzzzzzt.
   Bzzzzzt.
   Billy lifted his head and wondered how it could be Tuesday already.  He
got out of bed, and that was when he saw Kathy Ireland battling a pitch-black
demon.
   "Well, there's something you don't see every day," Billy mused.
   Kathy turned her head.  "Mind giving me a hand, cutie?"
   Billy stared for several seconds, and jumped off the bed, landing a vicious
side kick to the face of the demon.  The demon howled in anger/fury/pain, and
promptly turned into a wisp of smoke.
   Kathy turned around, and smiled at Billy.  "Thanks.  He was a handful, let
me tell you.  Now, let me show you my gratitude."
   Kathy moved towards Billy, parting her thick, moist lips...
   "BILLY!  Are you going to stay in here for fifth hour, too?"
   Billy's dream faded almost as quickly as the demon had.  He shook his head
to clear the cobwebs, and realized the bell had rung, and he was still in his
fourth hour class when it was fifth hour.
   Billy managed a squeak of bewilderment, gathered his things, and headed to
fifth hour class.  He was relieved when he got there.  His mind was totally
blown, and he couldn't think straight.  Thank goodness he had a free period
to...
   "Okay, class.  Get out fourty sheets of paper and write a novella.  You
have fifty minutes.  Begin."
   Billy stared numbly at his Advanced English teacher, Mrs. Learse.  She was
staring out the window at her nice shiny red car, a Ninjata or something.
Billy screamed, once, and pulled out his paper and began.
   Forty eight minutes later, he was done.  His hands were bleeding, and his
eyes swam in and out of focus, but he was done.  "Mrs. Learse?" Billy asked.
"What should we do with our --"
   Mrs. Learse leaped from her perch, and with the deftness of a jungle beast
(which, Billy assumed she was related to one anyway), snatched the papers from
Billy's hands.
   Her face was expressionless as she snapped, "No talking during writing.
Automatic zero."
   Billy suddenly realized how people can commit murder.  He jumped up, ran to
Mrs. Learse, and started yelling in her face.
   "You stupid freak!  You Hooked-On-Phonics dropout!  You wouldn't know a good
essay if it jumped up and bit you on your ass!  You --"
   Mrs. Learse slapped Billy full in the mouth.  Billy started to bleed, and
gaped at her.
   "No one, I repeat, no one, EVER talks to me like that."
   Billy considered his options briefly.  He could...

   1 -  Let it slide.  Billy wasn't a violent type, so, being slapped in the
        face by a woman in front of 25 classmates shouldn't have bothered him.
   2 -  Complain to the principal.  This was the best thing to do, as it was
        democratic and would be a peaceful solution.
   3 -  Beat the living snot out of her.

   Billy headed for his desk, pivoted on his left foot, and shot his right
foot into the front of her knee.  Mrs. Learse shrieked, and toppled over
backwards, grabbing a letter opener from her desk.  She lunged at him on her
unbroken knee, but he moved out of the way, bringing his knee up into her fist,
jamming the letter opener into her throat.
   Werdna Yollom stood up.  "Wow, Bill.  That was actually pretty cool."
   Bill grabbed the letter opener from Mrs. Learse's throat, and flung it at
him.  It lodged in Werdna's thigh, and he shrieked like a woman.
   "Shaddup," Bill muttered, and went into the hallway.
   Bill headed for the parking lot when Mr. Bigguy, the prinicpal, put his
hand on Bill's chest.
   "Thinking of skipping out, are we?" he smirked.
   "Um.  Get off me, or I'll rip out your liver and stick it in your ear."
   "Don't take that tone of voice with me, young --"
   Bill jabbed him in the belly, and threw him into a vat of Dunbar Funk.
   "Ow," Mr. Bigguy said/died.
   Bill laughed jovily, and continued towards the parking lot.  Carla Barch
waltzed by.
   "Hey," Bill said.  "Cool waltz."
   "Thanks," Carla replied, and waltzed away.
   Bill smiled, changed directions, and headed towards the newly completed
Ammo Annex section of Dunbar.
   "Boy, that Ammo Annex sure was a swell addition."  Cheesy grin.
   Bill stopped, and pondered why he had taken this choice in life.  Could it
be because his parents divorced at the age of ten, after his dad discovered
Bill's mother was actually a man?  Could it have been that nasty Cheez-Whiz
incident with the police?  Could it have been...
   "Could it have been those burritos I had for lunch?" Bill wondered.
   Bill continued wondering and walking until Chris Lyman flew by on an acorn
tree.
   "Squirrels," Chris said.
   "Booha," Bill replied.
   Chris nodded, and flew away.
   Bill waved goodbye, and noticed the floor had turned into Jello.
   "Darn," Bill darned.  "Lemon.  I *HATE* lemon Jello."
   Bill wobbled his way to the door of the new annex, when the door opened and
Kathy Ireland answered.
   "Hi," Kathy purred.
   Bill laughed.  "Say, weren't you in a dream I had a while ago?"
   "No, but I was," replied a second Kathy, emerging from the shadows.
   "Wow, Beavis.  This is pretty cool," Bill said to no one in particular.
   "I wasn't either," chorused twenty more Kathys.
   "Uhhhh... wow.  Neato.  Spiffy.  Et cetera," Bill sighed.
   A large red dog appeared next to Bill.
   "Like, bark.  Bark, or something," Clifford barked.
   "Hey.  I know you," Bill replied.
   "Not anymore..." Clifford said, halfway through the metamorphesis he was
undergoing.  In fifteen seconds, he was a squirrel.
   The squirrel nodded at the Kathys, and looked at Bill.
   "The time is short.  We must save the world!!!" the squirrel chriped.
   "Too wierd," Bill gasped.
   Suddenely, and without warning, and redundantly, a huge alarm sounded.
   BUZZT!  BUZZT!  BUZZT!
   "Wow," Bill moaned, suddenly getting very sleepy
   (awake)
   BUZZT!
   Buzzt!
   Bzz


      zt!
   Bzzzt!
   Bill sat bolt upright in his bed, sweat pouring off him in pails.
   "Bill!" a voice yelled.  "Come downstairs!"
   "That was some strange dream..." Bill said, starting downstairs.
   His step-mom was behind a newspaper when he sat down for breakfast.
   "Sherona," Bill began.  "You won't believe the dream I had..."
   "Oh no?" the woman replied, and laid the paper down.
   "Kathy???"

   Bzzzt!




Memory             by Jennifer Hacker-----------------------------------------

I see your face a thousand times before I enter the realm of sleep.
I see the smile you gave only to me, the little sister who loved you.
I reach out to take your hand, to tell you I love you.
Then I remember you're gone, and the image shatters.

I see myself, nine years old, not able to understand.
I watch as you cry when you thought no one could see.
I wanted to help you, and gave part of myself to save your life.
But still I watched you weaken, still I watched you die.

I see myself at the funeral, full of rage.
I see myself curse the God that would take a 17 year old girl away.
I see myself, now, the same age as you were.
I see myself, I see you, and I see the connection.




The Victory        by John Geurkink-------------------------------------------

Lord on the football field of life
where I will suffer pain and strife
Help me to achieve the goal
which is salvation for my soul

Keep me running straight and true
ever closer Lord to you
round the left or round the right
running hard toward the light

When sinful foes around me near
help me pass into the clean
but when I'm blitzed and taken down
let my foes ne'r see me frown

But help me stand and run again
up the middles, or round the end
To break through so all may see
How great Thy faithfulness to me

But if I boastful pride portray
thinking that these yards I've made
Stop me Lord and make me humble
make me fall or make me stumble

If in the huddle, you call the plays
there'll be no fouls, no delays
But when I plan my own attack
without fail, Oh Lord, I'm sacked

Now that the final goals in sight
and my days give way to night
I know the game has only been won
by the blood of Gods dear Son

When my flesh couldn't carry me through
and my spirit was black and blue
Jesus lifter me up and carried me
over the line to victory.




Simple             by Cislyn Hunt---------------------------------------------

Sitting Indian style on a scratchy rug
Scooping handfuls of cocoa puffs
And flashing those dimples
As you watch Scoooby Doo
You make life seem so simple
There are tire marks on your front lawn
It's easy to see; the weeds are pressed down
I ask you where they came from
"Who knows? Who cares? Not me!"
What a philosopher thou art
I swear I heard a gunshot last night
But you laugh and say that it was
Only a bad muffler on one of the cars
That incessantly turn left at the light
You call me "obsessive"
Mostly about the little things
And tell me to relax and
Live a little
But I would rather live a lot
Because I don't think life is complicated
I know it is.




Mind Wind          by Chris Lyman---------------------------------------------

Thoughts converge
  and I emerge
    From the deep black tide
      Omnipotent in the power surge

          All I see
            is me
              Existing as all
                Imagining things that will always be

                    Nothing is heard
                      like a dirty word
                        Silence is deafening
                          Distinction is vague and blurred

                              Gray son
                                realizing I am one
                                Destination fulfilled
                              The battle is won

                          Laying to rest
                        the visions jest
                      Seeking all but sleep
                    The mind wind blows west

                All that I fear
              within a tear
            Burning into the sky
          Not far, not near

      Fall with haste
    to a breathing place
  Mount the omniscient steed
And vanish into space




Rebirth        copyright 1994 by Aaron Ramey----------------------------------

He had been there
all the while,
And yet
     was invisible -

alone marble inaseaofbrokenglass.

Suffering a non-
existent existence,
Until now.

Surfaces begin to
take shape,
A life emerges beyond
tangible bleakness -

the desert fern against
       immeasurable odds.

He begins anew.
a new path -
A new opportunity
     not to be forsaken.

Murky skies finally crack -
allowing the mind
To bathe the fruits
of his intellectual labors
     in newfound promise.

Never again would he
allow his life to
     slip
          away
               from him.

After all, it isn't
every day that the lost
are born
     again.
