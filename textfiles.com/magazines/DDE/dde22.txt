Hate
I hate love
I hate life
I hate pain
I hate death
I hate this twisted form
   of existance
I hate this wretched man
   I've become
I hate - I fucking hate!
Anger
It fills me inside
I rebel
With ruthless pride
I laugh
Despite my foes
Conqueror I am
Of nothing.
Hate.

************************


Fool,
You ask?
Oh, yes!
Many times over.
I am
forever
destined
alone.

***********************


I try...
   Oh, but it's not good enough.
I wait...
   Oh, but it's not long enough.
I see...
   Oh, but it's not far enough.
I love...
   Oh, but it's not strong enough.
I fail.

**********************


I was proud
Once
That I had a family
It has come
            gone
                 past
To drift into that place
Where it was dremt
Long


Ago.

*********************

Reflecting back upon the past
of a time where life was real
and death was only once;
      a transition.
But now I see a time
where conformity to public opinion
is the law.
And I feel pain
for a loss so great.
Drifting, passing, fate.
Come with me children
for all hope is not lost.
Never!

********************

If one wonders whether I care,
   assume the answer `no' and work up from there.

********************

A lack of action on my part
does not necessarily indicate a lack of concern.
Only a lack of importance
to the persepective of life as we know it.
   If one asks himself the importance of a daily chore,
   in relation to death,
   one wouldn't deem it important.
For, what else is there, but life,
                               and death.
And all else falls by the wayside.

********************

Pain
Relentless pain
I bleed
A river running red
Ripping, tearing, shred
Ice
Veins of frozen ice
Stone
Turning my heart to stone
to prevent it's happening twice.
Time
Searching endless time
To find the One.

********************

Take a chance
they say
Reach out
only to have your hand
slapped away.
Hate
This world is filled with hate
And sometimes...
I follow suit
Perseverance
We must hold on
Until the end
To a future world.

********************

Lie?
What do you care,
In this expediant existance?
Truth?
What is truth?
Claimed by philosophers, and danced
         around by politicians.
Search for truth?
You will NEVER find it!
Save in One.

*********************

Brick wall.
Do you care?
   Oh yes, I care, says the wall.
Do you feel?
   Oh yes, I feel, says the wall.
Do you forgive?
   Oh yes, I forgive, says the wall.
Then why such anger?
   I am not angry, says the wall.
...as she walks away.

*********************

I feel you
So close
But a canyon seperates us
So far
A wall
Labled with ignorance
Unknown to me
Let us journey to it's base
Let us bring knowledge to this place
So we may be joined
As One.

*********************

Obligation
Do you feel this to me
For what I've done?
Do not.
For what I give
Is done freely.
And what I receive
Should be likewise.
Respond as you feel
Respond as you trust
Feel me.
Trust me.
Love me.
