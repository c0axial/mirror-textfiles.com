 ... suburban teenage angst rears its ugly head

Like, its 3am. Denny's parking lot ... we're all smoking our 
cigarettes and trying to think through the foggy haze that we
have gleefully transformed our minds into. The landscape is
gaunt ... the attitude is dispersed and replaced with a communal
cesspool of swirling and raw fun. We don't know who we are or
why or when but we do know that we can trust each other and we
can believe that though we might not know what we'll do to our-
selves, we know what we wouldn't do to anybody else. 

But as the curtains of night are lifted and we filter back to our
own little place, the unsettling realization of reality comes
reeling back. Fuck, we think, fuck - this really sucks.

... whatever

See, this is just the shit that has made me do what I done did.
But first!- a few words to help provide some background into 
these things.

 1. Bulletin boards are crucial.

   I have always felt that telecommunications is not only the
   most fertile place for individualism, but also critical in
   maintaining the self, electronic or not. Bulletin boards
   are the last refuge for the socially persecuted ... the 
   socially deviant ... and the socially unacceptable. BBS'es
   are faceless, raceless, genderless (sometimes!) forums of
   intellectualism ... perhaps J.S. Mill would find his 
   marketplace of ideas only in bulletin boards. When the
   Orwellian disaster occurs, bulletin boards and the creative
   force that drives it will be the key to any sort of under-
   ground freedom. 

 2. Bulletin boards are art.

   Aside from being politically important, BBS'es are also 
   aesthetically important. A painter begins with canvas and
   works with it. A sysop begins with a board program and
   works with it. A friend of mine once said that everyone
   should have their own board ... and design it to fit their
   own personality and expression. Sounds good to me, but 
   maybe not here and maybe not now. It seems that I'm in a
   sea of blank canvasses propped up as paintings! I can't
   really say that I've seen a board in 216 that has a very
   distinct personality in a long time.

 3. Johnny Rotten has the right idea.

   John Lydon once said that the Sex Pistols broke up because
   it became what it was and that was it. "We did it and we
   moved on. It was all very natural." People need to learn
   their limits. The Cure should have broken up years ago, 
   for instance. Arrakis should have been offline for a long
   time. And I don't really want to commit the same crime 
   that I profess against!

... so, this means what?

 Well, kids (and I do mean baby goats), let's quit beating
 around the bush. The TDL/Necropolis era is OVER. There will
 no longer be a Necropolis bulletin board system. It is
 permanently offline. 

 Now, when I first put up the Dragon's Lair way back when, I
 thought about the day it would go offline. I'd be off to
 college, the board-death date would be widely known, there'd
 be a big online wake ... well, it didn't happen that way. In
 a burst of wild realization, it came plummeting down without
 any warning. 

 I don't want the Necropolis to become old hat. I don't want it
 to be second-hand watered-down over-the-hill et cetera etc. 
 Towards that end, it is over. 

 Now, there have been a lot of swell times over the years on
 the ol' Necropolis. Some things we would like to talk about and
 some things probably best left unsaid. In the end, I would 
 suggest that the Necropolis was one of the more successful and
 maybe significant bulletin boards in Stark County's illustrious
 history. Maybe that's being a little immodest, but I think its
 true, objectively speaking (is there such a thing...?). 

 In short, I've lost the passion and the edge that used to keep
 things running. But there's no blame to be placed here and 
 there isn't really any negativeness about the whole affair. 
 I don't regret anything about the Necropolis or TDL and that's
 the way it will remain now. 

 This is the end of the Necropolis, but I seriously doubt 
 whether this is the end of my sysoping career. Already, plans
 for a new project are in order. Something entirely different
 than the Necropolis ... hopefully better! There are a couple
 of things I need before it goes back up: 1. A 14.4k modem,
 2. Long-distance and 3. A new BBS program.

 Actually, the board program is already selected... that won't
 be revealed for a while though. More than likely, you'll see
 this new project towards the end of the summer. 

 BBS'ing in Stark County has become utterly horrible. Akron isn't
 even much better. There is absolutely no resourcefulness, no
 creativity, and no mental processes at work. I must say that I
 am thoroughly revolted at the idea of BBS'ing. But like many
 users I know, I doubt I'll be gone. 

... tying up loose ends

 Right now, the only board I call regularly (semi-regularly) is
 Radio KAOS. You can contact me there. Distorted Digital Erection
 is on temporary hiatus until things can be worked out and some
 new direction is given. Belch is still in the works. There will
 probably be a Necropolis going-away cookout or something, but
 that's still in the works too. My voice number is now 966-PILE 
 and you can call me there anytime to chat or whatever. 

 I would like to hear your thoughts on my decision, so if you
 could call that # and leave a message on the machine... that'd
 be cool.

 Well, that's that. Those of you who thought another 3-month 
 repair session was on, guess again! 

 I loved being a sysop. Now I'm another user... may Gog be 
 with me!
