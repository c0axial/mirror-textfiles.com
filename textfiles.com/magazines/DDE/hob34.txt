Dress

The matter of dress is an area for attention and careful consideration for 
several reasons.  There is a strong relationship between dress and 
appearance and the the seriousness with which students approach learning.  
This dress code is in effect at all school related activities including 
athletic, extracurricular and social events.
ALL STUDENTS:
  1.      Footwear shall be worn, properly laced and tied, and must be 
          clean. Thongs, sandals, "flip-flops," etc. (footwear with only 
          toe support) shall not be worn.
  2.      Jams, beachwear, swimwear, tights of any type (as an outer 
          garment), athletic sweatpants (tie waist and elastic band legs), 
          and an extreme style of trousers shall not be worn.  Jeans and 
          slacks must be neat, in good condition, not tattered or in need 
          of repair, and of proper fit. Clothing with any type of holes will 
          not be permitted.  If any type of tights is worn, (leggings, capri 
          pants, leotards, etc.), an outer garment must be worn over them 
          that meets the 5" hemline lenght requirement.
  3.      Shorts will be permitted on a trial basis during the 1992-93 
          school year. They will be permitted as long as the hemline does 
          not exceed 5" above the knee when kneeling.  All clothing will be 
          measure from the solid part of the material. "Lacy or Sheer" 
          material is not included in the 5" hemline measurement length.
          -       All shorts must be loose fitting and have a sewn hem with 
                  no vertical cuts or slits.
          -       Shorts with a frayed hem are unacceptable.
          -       Tight-fitting shorts made of spandex material such as 
                  biker shorts are not permitted.
          -       Skin-tight blue jeans or denims are not permitted.
          -       The layered effect or look of spandex shorts or any other 
                  shorts under regular shorts is not permitted. In other 
                  words, only one pair of shorts is permitted.
          -       Cut off sweats or sweatpant material is unaccepatble.
          -       Shorts with rolled cuffs are permitted.
          -       If the above short regulations are not followed, the 
                  wearing of shorts will be eliminated.
  4.     Any clothes of sheer, "fishnet" materials shall not be worn.
  5.     A shirt, blouse or dress of a low cut or bare midriff style shall 
         not be worn. Example: tank tops (tops that have the front, back or 
         arms cut out, sunbacks, tube tops, half-shirts, etc.).  A shirt, 
         blouse, or dress with straps less than 2" wide shall not be worn 
         unless the shoulder area is covered with proper clothing.
  6.     If you are not sure your dress will be acceptable, DO NOT WEAR IT!
  7.     If clothing or dress becomes so extreme that it disrupts the 
         orderly progress of the school, the student will be required to 
         change his/her attire.
  8.     Heavy winter type jackets and outerwear (vests) shall not be 
         worn in the building during the school day without permission.
  9.     Proper undergarments shall be worn.

         refer to drugs, alcohol, sex, bondage, cults, devils, suicides, 
         death, skulls, snakes or blood will not be permitted.  This
