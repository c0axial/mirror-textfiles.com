It seems to be MODEM WAR time again! Yes, spring is on its way and
the peasants of the modem world are feeling frisky again. Let's
just take a peek at the call to arms initiated on the Town Crier
BBS ... at least, that's where I saw 'em.

Well, maybe if I could do nothing but call around all day long and talk
to someone who THINKs he is GOD, Yea, I'd be having FUN *NOT*!

Besides, I get my fun and get paid to do it! Finger that one out

   Rather than hurling random insults, why don't you explain why you
feel that the Necropolis is not up to your standards of maturity?

   I'm just curious. Necropolis has an active message area, active
games, a huge text library. Various topics are discussed. I don't know
what could be so wrong with all of that.

Oh, come on now, Thom. Do you REALLY want to invite another bulletin
board war? Think that you'll be up to it? I know I would be. If your
definition of being grown up is mis-spelling and horrible grammar and a
bulletin board that looks like it was set up by a five-year old (or an
illiterate) ... then I'm proud to say that I'm not grown up. 
 
We've had these little conflicts before, Thom. And you've always come
out on bottom. 
 
So, shut up.

Hey, Thom? Its called: 'creativity.' Its something you like. In lower
forms of life, imagination is one of the lacking mental stages. You are
a perfect example.
 
See, there's more to bulletin boards that your standard
messages/files/doors set-up. I realize that in your feeble mental
condition, that's a hard concept for you to grasp. But, its true.
That's why your BBS will always be fourth-rate and mine will always be
the best.
