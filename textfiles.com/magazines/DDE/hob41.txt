  Wicca: An alternative path to deity
  ------

     By: The Dark Jester


   Witchcraft, also known as Wicca, is a diverse and decentralized religion 
that is part of the nature-based religious movement which is emerging in the 
world today. At this moment, there are thousands of individuals and groups 
who practice Wicca in North America and many others in Europe and South 
America.

   There is no "holy book" or great man who inspired or created Wicca. 
Instead, Wicca is a religion based upon the centries old traditions of the 
pagan peoples of Old Europe. It incorporates ideas from MANY pagan paths, 
and puts them all together in an understandable, natural way. Wicca isn't
about sin, or hate, or eternal damnation. Instead, Wicca is about life. The 
plants, animals ... all that is alive, incuding humans, are a part of 
"deity". In Wicca, god(ess) isn't in some celestial palace or in a fiery 
pit, but instead is manifest in the universe as all that is - the life force 
if you will. Nature is used as a teacher. 

   Wicca is a religion of common sense. As we are all a part of deity, it 
makes no sense to destroy the environment or to hurt other people since when 
you do so you only hurt yourself. While Wicca has many traditions 
(denominations) including some homemade ones (which is just fine) it has
some central ideas that most all Wiccans ascribe to. The most important one 
of which is the Wiccan Rede: "It it harm none, do what thou wilt". If 
followed to its logical conclusion, the Rede is a key to responsible, 
ethical living and can arguably be considered more responsible than some 
more mainstream religious "commandments".

   Witchcraft incorporates into itself the use of magick. Magick is 
important to Wicca, as it enables Witches to help themselves and other 
people (provided they WANT the help). Witches don't cast curses, or summon 
negative spiritual entities. Instead, Wiccans use their magick to heal and 
to improve the quality if life. In short, Wiccan magick is POSITIVE magick.

   Wiccans use nature as a guide. In nature, there is birth ... growth ... 
and then finally ... death. With the coming of spring however, there is 
re-birth! Wiccans believe in reincarnation. When someone dies, their spirit 
passes into a place called by many names in many cultures. Wiccans commonly
call it the Summerlands. A place of rest and love where the spirit is allowed 
to grow strong again. After this occurs, the spirit is returned to earth to 
live another life again and again gaining experience and knowledge from 
each life. The rebirth is NOT locked into linear time. (If it was, it would 
be impossible as there are now more people living today than at any time in 
history.) What life you live each time is based upon a plan beyond our 
understanding AT THIS TIME. It doesn't depend on "karma" as the people of 
the East understand it. 

   For purposes of relating to deity, Wiccans use many symbols. As there is 
duality in nature, Wiccans use both the male and female to represent the 
"image" of the deity. Both God and Goddes, Lord and Lady are symbolized as 
the deity. This makes sense, as both sexes are a PART of nature. Various
deities from the different cultures of the world are used as symbols as well. 
Some Wiccans might call upon the symbol of Tyche, the Greek goddess of luck 
for aid. Other Wiccans might call upon Forseti, the Norse deity of Justice 
to deal with someone who has wronged them. Different traditions use different 
deities. 

   There are really two groups of Wiccans. Those who practice together, in a 
group called a "coven" and those who practice alone called Solitares. Both 
ways are fine, although a coven can be a great way to meet new people and to 
learn more about oneself and others. 


   At the last, it's time to talk about the Wiccans worst problem: bad press. 
Many Christian groups have made a concerted effort to spread lies about Wicca, 
calling it "Satanic" and insisting that Wiccans in reality are worshipers of 
their devil. This is absolutely untrue. The devil, or Satan is a Christian
concept. Wicca has nothing to do with Christianity, and so does not believe 
in the Christian Devil or any other Christian theology. The press also has a 
tendency to call any female magician a "witch" which is not accurate. Male 
Wiccans are not called Worlocks. 

   There is much more to Wicca than what you're read about in this article. 
I suggest that you pick-up a few books on the subject and then decide for 
yourself whether Wicca is for you. Wiccans don't go looking for converts, so 
asking questions isn't going to put you in danger from people coming to the 
door with books to press on you. You should, however, be polite and careful 
if you want to talk to someone who you think IS a Wiccan. Many Wiccans have 
been harrassed by many well meaning, and sometimes not so well meaning 
members of other religions who want to convert them and might not want to 
come "out of the broom closet" so to speak. Ask, but don't press. If you DO 
find someone who says they are Wiccan, check with your "inner self" when 
you hear what they say. If their views and practices don't work for you, 
just don't do it. Find a tradition that's right for you, or when you've read 
more, come up with your own as I have. It's ok.
