This was the response on TCC when I took posting in the 
Films&tv forum from 5 meassges total, about 1 per week posted 
only by the SysOp, to 53 messages total, about 5 per week 
posted by about 7 different users. The SysOp of the forum is 
Star, Mega is evidently her mother. The controversy was over 
Rush Limbaugh: Wheather or not his facts were factual?

I would like to suggest that a new forum be started to handle the
controversy on Rush Limbaugh!  This is getting a little boring here, and
obviously is not about to end soon!

Start your own forum, Petula, dear, and you will have the final say on
all the replies!   ...and then this forum will return to it's original
purpose...to allow users to review films and TV shows, not to express
their political opinions.

Love,
Mom


P.S.  (to Star)  you have great taste in men!  ;>


Yes Mom, I know! :)  -Star-

I don't want final say, whatever that means - if you're referring to me
having a say in what appears, I am against censorship so I would allow
all points to appear - This forum is also to discuss Films and T.V. Rush
Limbaugh is a T.V. personality so he should be discussed. We are also
not discussing him politically, we are discussing the validity of his
statements that he makes on T.V.!

Just another fine example of the kind of users on TCC.
