Rarely does mainstream America choose to promote a musician that 
can be deemed satisfactory! Unfortunately, DGC has found one ...
and decided to exploit them. He is Beck. And in tribute of his
rather mournful ascension to the higher (lower?) realm of the
corporate music scene, we offer the lyrics to his Top 40 hits,
_Loser_:

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and a map to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car  flaming with the loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin T
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat
Someone keeps saying I'm a saint to complain about
A shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Savin' all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo...cut it

Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
Double-barrel buck shot
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me

Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phoney gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in the bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nosejob
The daytime crap with the folk singer suave
He hung himself with a guitar string
It's like a turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pidgeon wing
If you can't write, if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef or the body for the hate
And my time is a ball of wax
Fallin' on a termite, who's chokin' on the splinters

Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
Get crazy with the Cheez Whiz
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
Yo...bring it on down
(Assorted unintelligible giberish)
"I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it."
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
I can't believe it
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
Sprekenze Deutsche baby?
Soy un perdidor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me
Know what I'm saying?
