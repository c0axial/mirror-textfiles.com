It is just so interesting and I found it during one of my nightly
prowls on TCC:

          'How to Smoke in Your Dorm Room & Not Get Caught'
                         by Amphetamine Gobbler

So you're sitting around your dorm room in a very lazy manner and
reach for your Phillies box ... open it up and see a big, fat
roach just waiting for you.. calling you almost. You want so much
to smoke what is contained in that tiny piece of white paper, but-
DAMMIT- you're at school. Here's what you do to not get caught.

1. Method of Choice. While it might be simply the God's way of
smoking bud through a blunt, and you might be satisfied in a
wonderful way by a nice joint... this is just stupid. These two
methods let off an enormous amount of smoke. Remember that the
walls in dorms aren't very thick to begin with. So something that
keeps on smoking is stupid. I know some kid who dealt in out of
his dorm room locally and one day he lit up a joint and smoked
it then went down the hall to watch a movie. Campus security was
there in no time. A pipe with a cap is good. A huge water bong
is bad. Just find something that doesn't let out much smoke.

2. Prepare!. Also be prepared. First of all, you'll need blow
tubes. These can be just tiny toilet paper tubes with a wad of
fabric softener at one end. When you exhale your hits, exhale
into the tube. The smoke will still come out but the smell will
be mitigated. Second, put a towel over the crack in the door
and DON'T FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR. Third, this might seem self-
explanatory or obvious, but maybe not. Also keep your goods and
related tools in one spot. After three or four bowls, you'll
be so confused you won't want to think about that. That's bad.
Fourth, investing in a good potpourri spray or just a regular
Lysol air freshener is great. Spray while smoking.

3. Keep things locked up. Depending on what school you go
to, things are generally run this way: Campus security can look
through anything that is 1. their's or 2. in plain view. For
instance, we smoked bud down in Cincinnati and we always kept
it in the refrigerator. Not only did it keep the plant fresh,
it also was the property of my friend's roommate and therefore
could not be searched by Campus Security. Make sure you know
the penalties and procedure for this type of thing. Your dorm
front desk should have all of this information.

4. Be cool. Make sure you're cool with your neighbors. A lot of
people WILL make calls to campus security .. you'd be surprised.
Some people want the excitement or maybe they're just assholes
but they will call. Don't push your luck if you don't think that
you can.

All in all, smoking pot in a dorm room can be a real blast. Just
be careful. Campus security isn't as lax as they might seem and
the punishment is very real and very severe. One kid I know got
busted with just a resinated bowl and an EMPTY plastic bag and
he got his license suspended and also a big fine, plus a nice
misdemeanor on his permanent record. That sucks. 

Until then ...

Hey, you crazy cats: comin' up to the world of distorted penis 
excitement ... hacking Kent Stark LANs, TCC in CHECK!, and 
some other clever little productions. Also!- more MWF and
fiction by Azathoth... and a first-hand glimpse at life in
the Ku Klux Klan!

BTW- this was the start of a Distorted Digital Erection that just
never got going. Its just here for trivial and nostalgic reason,
and nothing more.

Wow. We're sitting here listening to P.J. Harvey. I just got home.
I spent the night taking shots of Absolut, Shnapp's Firewater and
smoking just tons of pot - blunts and bowls. I'm still so blowed.
Thought I would stumble in and call some boards. I just logged
onto Cool Beans! in Berkely. I don't like it as much as I used 
to. Its getting too ... I don't know. Je ne sais quoi. I think
I might vomit. I want some pizza ... but that might make me 
vomit. P.J. Harvey is impressing me. I've never heard the whole
CD... just parts. Its not bad so far.

So, here's the thing. I'm turning into an asshole. I mean - a
complete asshole. Now, I've always been somewhat of a smart ass.
I'm good at it. I can make any feel stupid any time. Its a 
talent. Anyway, this is when I noticed it.

It was about two weeks ago. I was calling someone and on accident
called the wrong number. I said: "Is George there?" The woman
replied - rather politely - : "I'm sorry, you must have the
wrong number." I replied: "Oh, DO I?"
    
Anyway, thanks for reading.

"Every single degrading aspect of capitalist society in decay -
wars for profit and plunder abroad, race hatred dividing the
working class, the slums we live in, the ruin of our environment,        
expensive, poor or nonexistent medical care, inadequate education,
the second class status of women, drug abuse, riots, crime--in
short, every one of those brutal, callous, cruel and desperate
things which goes on every hour, every minute, in capitalist society, 
grows out of exploitation. If we want to stop the degradation,
we must end exploitation. If we want to free ourselves from wage
slavery, we must abolish the profit system."
  From _The Socialist Republic_, Winter/Spring 1991
