Hello, kids! Another meat-grinding, saliva-dribbling, heart-pounding,
sweaty installment of Distorted Digital Erection slides its way onto
your hard drive. The last t-file was the TWENTY-FIFTH DisDigEre (as
it is sometimes called on the Internet) ... now, usually, this is a
big to-do for marriages and the like. But, for us, it was just an
article by the Ferret. But, y'know ... we've always been a little
informal. 

Ok, for this edition we have something that will convince any of you
TCC'ers who still think that Chaos is a nice guy that he is actually
a jerk. Because DDE21 was uploaded to TCC, this message was posted
by the sysop of Canton Connection (at least one of them). You'll note
that it is riddled with lies and half-truths. Let's take a look.
By the way, this capture is courtesy of Duuk Tsarith.

  HA HA!  I think ANYONE with HALF-A-BRAIN knows not to call a system
    like the one mentioned above.

    Before you know it, your phone number and password are distributed
    to the entire modem community. You will recieve PRANK phone calls
    at ALL HOURS of the night.

    Folks, READ THE ABOVE MESSAGE VERY CAREFULLY. These people have said
    " The ONLY GOOD Tcc users I ever found were Necro Junkies ".

   Yet, this is the same Bbs that is asking you to drop TCC and call
   them! They have 1 LINE, maybe 50-75 messages, and ALL OF THEM do
   nothing but DOG and CRACK on " YOU ", the person who accually DOES
   find TCC entertaining.

   I have been in this modem community for 13 years now. I have been
   calling bbs's before the 1200 Bps modem was even being sold. I have
   seen alot of systems like that one come and go, but they will ALLWAYS
   be around. But you the User will have to learn how to avoid them.

   I will post a message outlining on how to tell whether a Bbs is SAFE

   We are not here to BRAINWASH you! <LOL>  YOU are the one who dials
   our number! YOU are the one who sent in the donation (most of you!)!
   WE are the ones who take 200 calls a day. Anyone who tries to tell
   you that we try to FOOL YOU into calling our bbs, is really the one
   who is pulling the wool.

   Dont let these "Fly-by-Night" Bbs systems RUIN ANOTHER peacefull bbs.
   We ARE NOT here to stop ANYONE from calling ANY other Bbs's. We
   CERTAINLY dont go around posting messages on OTHER PEOPLES BBS'S
   saying how bad they are!

   THIS GUY HAS THE NERVE TO CALL OUR SYSTEM TO POST TRASH ABOUT US!
                                  ---                            --

        WHAT KIND OF RESPECT DO YOU THINK HE WILL GIVE YOU!?!



Oh, the beauty of this message! That's right kids - give us your 
phone number and it'll be distributed, like some secret organization
of hoodlums! Yes, these fly-by-night systems ... even though the
Necro went up the same week that TCC did! Yes, the system with no
more than 100 messages a day ... even though TCC doesn't get 100
messages a month! Yes, TCC doesn't want to discourage people from
calling other boards ... that's why any Necropolis ad that goes up
there is soundly deleted!

Wow. The propaganda of it all.
