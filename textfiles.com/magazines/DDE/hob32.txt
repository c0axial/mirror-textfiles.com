  ... and you thought you had seen the last of text file power in
      Stark telecom! Well you were wrong!

  ... Distorted Digital Erection is a thing of the past. Taking
      over for it is Hallucinatory Oyster Burrito, a fiending,
      seething cauldron of textual sorcery that is just waiting
      to be unleashed. 


 This text file is a brief look at the new world of HOB ... which
 is replacing the on-hiatus DDE!


 a brief historium
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Distorted Digital Erection first came onto the scene 8 February
  1994!... in its 31-issue life, Amphetamine Gobbler, Spirit of
  Entropy, Azathoth, Duuk Tsarith, Tsunami, Petula Clark and the
  rest of the Necropolis-crew took it to a level that is totally
  unprecedented in recent telecom history. However, with the demise
  of the Necropolis came the demise of DDE (see DDE#31 for more).

  However, out of the ashes of former glory comes Hallucinatory
  Oyster Burrito ... that is going to conquest and plunder more
  fervently than DDE ever could have.

  New writers! New ideas! New circulation!

  With the Seinsfrage now operating along beautifully, HOB will
  become the new staple of text fileage for 216 and soon ... the
  nation, doncha know.

  
 a word on ... the hookah
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge
   of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large
   blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms
   folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the
   smallest notice of her or of anything else."
                       - from _alice in wonderland_

  Something that has carried over from DDE is the hookah representation
  in the HOB masthead. This is a symbol of the hookah which Menstrual
  Chowder brought back from Israel. It was a fantastical device that
  reeked of character and was a wondrous addition to other smoke-
  inhalation devices. Unfortunately, it was destroyed and abducted by
  unknown forces. This is a memorium to that fine creature.

 and now, just HOB
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Well, anyways. HOB is "in effect" and we's got some bizznizz to
  attend to. But, must I say, that submissions are a welcome thing!
  The beauty of DDE is that it invoked creativity and participation.
  This is a GOOD thing! So, fire up those text editors and fire up
  those neurons and let's see some submissions. You know how to
  get ahold of us, y'know.
