   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To the troubled modem user:

First, allow me to say that I understand your grief. I understand
where you are. You know that you love telecom, but you feel kind
of unfulfilled. You feel shallow and useless. You feel that there
is more to life than chat sex.

But you can't find your way out. I understand. 

There's a whole new world awaiting you once you escape the trap.
The enemy is very seductive. They take people in and use them
towards their own aims. After the "donation," it seems as though
you mean nothing to them. 

Stand tall. Stand proud. You are an intelligent, rational person.
Once you are out of the pit of ruin that you've sunken into, your
life will be much better.

You can leave TCC. Its easy. To begin, start calling Radio KAOS.
The number is: 830-4657. For those of you who call this BBS and
decide that you want more, the treasures of the Necropolis await
you. 

Call and find out what else there is. You don't have to pay for
online services. You don't have to chat to have fun. Life is 
more than online sex. All of these things can be achieved:
BY YOU!

Take the first step. Get out of it. Now, before it really is too
late. 

Thanks.

People who have been saved!

Tsunami, Azathoth, Morgoth, Milton Berle ... and so many more.

You, too, can escape.

The only sad thing is that there are many potential good users signing up
every day onto TCC.  They are new to the modem, as you and I once were, and
are thus very impressionable.  Just inexperienced enough for Larry to
brainwash em, making them think that TCC is what a BBS is supposed to be.

I wish there was some way to open up the truth to those people, but that would
expose us...
