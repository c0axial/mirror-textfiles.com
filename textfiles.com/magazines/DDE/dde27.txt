larry, I have reviewed your message bases and i've come up with this
conclusion: your message bases blow goatsssssssssss boy
The people that post in them are Immature perverts who try to draw mw
into chat mode and talk dirty to me.  I an't beleive all the perverted
immature users you have here.  Your bases are lame... Nothing like the
Necropolis and Radio Kaos...  And at least the users their are mature
and can carry on decent conversaitions.  Oh, yeah, they are smart too.
I guess your BBS is for people that like Files and doors... well, I am
not a Files and doors Kinda guy... I also heard you had porno .GIFs
here.. I think that is sick... especially if little kids can get a hold
of them.  And I heard you created a female account so you could have
"Chat sex" with little kids.  HOW DISGUSTING!!  Get a life man.

Hell Ya! You say Nec and Kaos is so good.... then why don't you just
stay there, why do you have an account if you hate this board?

Maybe it's because you want to participate in so called "Chat Sex"
Even though Nec is the one that started that rumor

Attention all users! If you're thinking of calling Radio KAOS or
Necropolis, take a good look at the above message. On those boards
TCC is a regular topic of discussion. If you try to defend TCC in
any way, you'd better be prepared for a barrage of messages like the
one above, and worse.
