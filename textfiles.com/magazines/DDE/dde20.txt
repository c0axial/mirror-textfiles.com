                    DISTORTED DIGITAL ERECTION AT #20! 

A milestone in Stark County telecommunications is found herein. This
is for a number of exciting and delicious reasons. First, this is the
twentieth edition of DDE ... something that forces people to be in
a creative mindset. It fosters and develops something beyond beating
your dick while downloading. And second, this issue in particular is
important because it forges a new paradigm in telecom ... one that 
has been struggling to be born but hasn't yet had the chance. But
FIRST!... a little more TCC fun, shall we?

The censorship infection continues! Finally, when a forum does get
activity on TCC, they begin censoring all the posts! And here comes
a TCC sub-op to justify the censorship. It's a hoot:

Red, 

I have decide to remove this topic from the Poetry Forum, since I feel 
that only poetry should be placed there. I will delete my original post.
You can still read it, since it is quoted at the beginning of this post.

Red, would you please read my original message, again. There is no 
mention about keeping "anyone" from writing "anything". 

You have the freedom to write what ever you wish, but with all things, 
there comes responsibility with that freedom. 

This BBS has restricted areas, as I'm sure you already know. <G> In 
these areas you can post anything you like as long as it doesn't hurt 
someone else, such as defamation of character, etc. To gain access to 
these areas, a person has to get permission from the sysops. And yes, 
these areas are restricted by age. 

This means that the general forums are open to all age groups. 
Therefore, all material posted has to be acceptable material for anyone 
under the age of 18, as Federal laws mandate. Yes, even BBS have Federal
Rules and Regulations. At least this is my understanding of the rules of
this BBS.

I'm sure that you already know this. And I'm sure you don't agree. I do 
have a suggestion for all of you that are under 18 and feel a need to 
post such material. Perhaps you could ask one of the adults to post the 
material for you in the proper forum. Or maybe, you could talk to one of
the sysops about ways you could U/L into one of the forums, if you don't
have access to them. This would be the responsible thing to do.

But that won't be as much fun, will it? I believe the whole ploy here 
was to have some fun & see how many people would get upset by these 
posts. Do I see some bad cases of "cabin fever" out there? <G>

Please, next time you decide to yell about censorship, make sure you 
have been censored. Those who are responsible for their actions, find 
censorship a rare things these days, at least in our country. Seems to 
me, only trouble makers and the lazy yell censorship. And it usually 
works, they either stir up trouble or get somebody else to do what they 
should have done in the first place. Which is a real shame, because if 
we don't become a little more responsible for our own actions, we 
probably will see more censorship. So, like it or not, responsibility is
your best defense against censorship, at least as I see it.

As for feelings..they have lead to some incredible works of art & 
literature. On the other hand, if one does not control or "censor" their
own feelings in certain situations, they may live to regret it. It is 
not always wise to react to feelings with out thinking of their 
consequences. You can read about it almost every night in the 
Repository. It happens right here in our own community...Angry parent, 
losses custody of kids: kills 3 children, x-spouse & self..."A person 
should be allowed to express himself in a way he/she sees fit".....
In these cases? I hope not!

OK, let's get the record straight....
1. I am against Censorship....most of the time (still in parent mode)
2. I am for Responsibility
 for ones self & actions....for it removes the
need of Censorship by others.

So, now am I as mean as your mom?   <G>

And for our next 20th ISSUE TCC FUN-TIME FEATURE, we have a TCC
user who is having trouble in paradise. Bono, a TCC-olyte, had
made plans for having a meeting for TCC users. He called it the
TCC modem meeting or something like that. Well, the TCC staff
just WASN'T going to stand for that! They told him that he was
not permitted to use the acronym TCC or "Canton Connection" in
advertising his meeting for them on TCC. Here's his response:

Date: Friday, March 18, 1994  2:26pm                                 /Hello

CH>  I am sorry that you feel the way you do Bono. All that we asked is
CH>  that you save the TCC name for the people that MADE the name. We hold
CH>  a picnic every year in which alot of people work real hard to make it
CH>  a success. We just want to assure that we keep our picnics seperate
CH>  from the meetings that "just anybody" can put together.

Hold it... get off your throne.  You are talking down to me and the
other users as though you are royalty.  Do not do that.  You are not.


CH>  Your actions in Teleconference last night DID NOT reflect the attitude
CH>  of someone who agrees with what we are asking. Please do not bend the
CH>  facts or the truth.

That was between you and me.  This does not have to be brought into a
public forum.


CH>  #2: Just dont call it the TCC meeting, or TCC anything. Cuz it is not!
CH>      If you started a Bbs, would it be right for you to call it the
CH>      TCC #2? Well what then gives you the right to call your meeting
CH>      the TCC meeting? 
It is not that big of a deal. Obviously we dont

Hold it!  Let's see if YOU can understand THIS.  TCC is NOT, I repeat,
NOT a bunch of hardware and software.  TCC is the people who use it,
whether or not you'd like to consider us a part of your "empire".  If I
get a bunch of people together and call it a TCC meeting, it is no
different than if I would get together a group of Browns fans and call
it a Brown's backers tailgate party.  Do the Browns get as upset about
them using the name "Browns" as you do with "TCC"?  No, and I think that
the Browns have a much bigger reputation than this "BBS".  What gives me
the right?  Hell, if you paid for stock in a company, you'd want to have
some say so.  We have all paid $25 for this BBS, so we should have some
say so.

CH>If anyone feels they need to better understand what we are saying, then
CH>leave us mail. This is not a difficult one to figure out. We only asked
CH>one thing. Honesty is the best policy. If someone tells you different
CH>(in Tcon for example) and claims that we said more than listed above,
CH>just ignore them and move on. Some people just need to mature a bit and
CH>realize that the world does not revolve around them.

And now, ladies and gentlemen ... a nice rant/rave/manifesto on the
new paradigm for telecom, as it relates to the Necropolis.

The Necropolis is now an underground system. The number is private.
The new user password, also, is private. As most people involved
knew, it came down to having an open system and letting Larry Smith
control my message bases or going private. This story is well 
known among all.

However, a dangerous trend is seeping into the Necropolis. This
cannot be found in any one individual ... rather it seems to be
a tide coming in. This is the danger of elitism. 

The elitist mentality fosters itself when one group of people 
realize that they are doing something 'better' than someone else.
It is the disease that infects Christian fundamentalists. It is
the same affliction that people who think that they are the 'real
alternative' get. They walk into the store sporting their blue
hair and start bitching because the record store doesn't have
the entire discography of Blood Monster Mushroom, an obscure 
band from San Francisco (i.e. "What do you mean you've never heard
of them? They're so fucking rad!"). Anyway, back to the story.

This elitism makes the group irrational. The dangers of the elitist
mindset are very real. First of all, the elitism more than likely
will create hypocrites out of the people involved. In the case of
the Necropolis, I would hope that the idea of the Necropolis is
one of the electronic community .... a subterranean telecom world
that is akin to a rave or a Dead show. Second, elitism completely
annihilates the appeal of the group's philosophy. No one likes to
be talked down to. It is an utter turn-off. Third, elitism turns
a group in general into assholes. It makes them confrontational,
snobby and unlikeable. 

Now, how to stem this tide of elitist thinking? It must end where
it began, obviously. I personally cannot force someone to think
the way I want them to. I wouldn't want to even if I could. But
what I can do is explain my idea of utopian telecom.

My idea of the perfect telecom experience would be a diverse number
of users who all participate in discussions regarding the useless,
the meaningless, the meaningful, the silly and the serious. It 
would be - as I said - a fucking online Dead show. For those of 
you who have never had the luck to attend a Grateful Dead show,
it is channeled through the country by a spirit of complete
acceptance and everyone there is just 'cool.' I've offered people
a cigarette and they're like, 'No, man, I got some ... you keep
it for yourself.' That's the attitude. And that's the attitude
I would want conveyed on the board.

The function of a bulletin board is the intelligent transfer of
information. It is the last way that a private citizen can truly
form an underground base of ideas. Bulletin boards, if done 
properly, are completely uncensored, untouched (by the gov't)
forums of discussion. Huge forms of information can be spread
across the country in a matter of hours. I've always said that
if I wanted to overthrow the U.S. Government, I would begin by
creating a national network of private, secret bulletin boards
that would facilitate all information exchange. 

I must admit - this asshole-free environment has not been often
seen from me (Sorc). But in general, I try to be friendly. Or if
not, I try not to say anything at all. But ideological opponents
are different. I try to show them the errors of their way and 
then resort to what some would call juvenile forms of coercion.
I'm obsessed with some twisted form of justice. I would love to
write all about the information I have on Larry Smith: his home
phone number, his address, his place of occupation, some really
neat stories about his past, et cetera. I can't because of the
law and whatnot. 

Anyway, allow me to apologize for the rambling nature of this
essay. It is just being thrown together without much forethought.
This is not to say that what it says is not what I think. I would
like everyone who reads this to think about this new paradigm that
can be forged out of what could potentially be a disaster.

Thanks for reading.
