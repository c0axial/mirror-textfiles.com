Oh, boy! Have we got a rather unique treat, gentlemen. This file was
sent to me in an anonymous fashion and details some of the better
sides of TCC. The point of this - the 'Madmax File' is described.
I think it shows something more interesting - a Night on TCC!
There's chat sex, some macho-ism and some cool psueo-psychology.
All in all, its a real hoot. Kinda long, though.

--- this is a chat log between Justina (at least i think it’s her) and 
Snowman-

SN> hesitation between  am   and 29.  You are sure that that is your real age?

LH>You see too much......but yes that is my real age.

I am nothing if not observant  :)  Just by the words you choose, I can tell a 
lot about you.  But...we need to chat more for it to work.  You can ask me 
some-thing now.

thanks for your "permission" oh gracious one.......<G>

No problem.  I am kind to those in need.  You sarchasm flows through your
modem like oil on a turkey  ???  anyway, what is your first question for me?


who are you really?

My name is Christopher George Mann.  I attend Sandy Valley High School.  I am
18 years old, and will graduate in one month.  Does that help?

Very much so.

You don't know me do you?

And what makes you think I don't know about you.

Hmmmm.   You type pretty fast, which leads me to believe that you have been
doing some SERIOUS chatting.  No doubt, my name has come up once or twice, and
since you asked me to call you, you must not have heard completely bad things

about me.  How is that for logical?

You seem pretty intelligent. I have been typing for quite some time. I am a legal secretary.

That's interesting.  In what department?

Domestic affairs.

Ohhhh   That's the fun stuff, like what child battering, break ins, etc.?

Yes, sometimes, but mostly divorces and custody battles and stuff like that.

That can be almost as violent, as I am sure you must agree.  Not only did my
parents go through a nasty divorce, but there was also a custody battle about
ten years later for my petition to move from my mom's to my dad's.  No douby
you must see people like our family every day.  This is boring!!!!!!!  Let's talk about something a little more.......interesting.

Like sex perhaps........

:)  I knew you weren't the sweet little innoscent gal that six other people I
have asked about you said you were :)

Six others said I was an innoscent little gal?

What was that?

What was what?


Suddenly your text flipped to the top of my screen instead of continueing on.  AAnyway, you are still legible, and I am still a pervert :)

You're very funny.

sorry I keep hitting the home key by accident.

That is what is doing it.  Can you hit enter about 20 times to clear my screen?























ThanHk you.

You're very welcome Christopher.

Thank you!!  Most people immediately shorten my name to Chris.  Chris is not
genderspecific, and though you might think that trivial, it is not funny when
someone yells for "Chris!" and I turn my head, and its Christin or Crissy, that
they want.


I know that is why I called you Christopher.

What is your name?


My name is Justina

hmmm  an uncommon name for an uncommon gal.  I like it!

I'm sure you would......<G>

That's probably true :)  Even if it would have been  Garlwenda, I probably 
would have said I liked it for not wanting to be impolite.  But....I 
DO actually like your name.  We are once again straying from the topic 
of choice...<G>

So you are a pervert aren't you?

No NO.  I'm a gentleman.  

hahahhahaha! You are very amusing.

That's what they all say......until.........

 You are really a lot different in person though.

Is that a question?

No.

You have seen me?

I've seen what I need to.

You were at the last Canton Connection meeting?

I could have been, but you wouldn't know that would you?

It depends (where you sat).  This is unusual.  Usually I pride 
myself as being one of the few people on here who are very similar online 
and in person.  your comment has left me a little flustered.  
Where did you sit?  


I didn't say for sure that I was there, I only said I could have been there.

Your comments up to this point have led me to believe that you were.  
You forget that I am Snowlock Holmes, and can read your print as though 
it were you mind.

No, I wasn't there but I would like to be.

Just as I suspected!!  You weren't.  When I said that I though you were, 
it was a ploy to make you come clean....yeah, thats the ticket.  We 
are AGAIN straying from the topic that we must embellish in.

LOL  I am (truely, no lie)  6 feet tall, weigh about 150lbs.  have brown hair
and eyes, and have a very gentle face.  To know me would be to be completely
unsuspecting of my hidden sexual drives.  I have the kind of face that you just
want to hug when you have a problem.  

You are truly a very amusing individual. So you have met LB

Yes, I have know her for quite awhile and spent many MANY hours in chat with
both of her.

You poor boy you......

You know her I assume, and don't like her?

Well what would Snowlock Holmes say?



Casper and LB , yes I know and I think that what she is doing with them
is very wrong.

You are strongly opposed to bi-sexuality?

No, I'm not, I have felt similar feelings but I don't like someone who 
is so pushy and when she doesn't get what she wants, she starts 
spreading rumors and lies about people.  That is a very immature individual.

yes, if I knew that she was doing those things, I might feel similarly to you.
Am I special by having you decide to pick me, or are you a regular at this?

 What do you mean by "pick"? 

To just say, "Call me at such and such a number"  Didn't I play the role of 
Welcome Wagon with you?

 I asked you to call me because I like to talk to you and haven't had the 
chance for a while.

Well, I'm glad that you enjoy talking to me.  You are also pleasent to 
chat with mainly because you are not limited to the few thousand words 
that several people on this board seem only to know, and you type 
reasonably fast, so its not frus-trating.  I like you.


 Thank you Christopher, I like you too.

Well, it sure is getting late.  Time for me to get to bed.......

Why is that?

No, that was the wrong response for you.  I didn't really mean I had to go to 
bed, you were supposed to say  "Ohh,   mind if I join you?"  something to that
effect.  I hope that I am not reading you completely wrong and shooting my
stupid mouth off right now.

 No you are not shooting your stupid mouth off right now, and I really 
enjoy frustrating you completely......Huge grin

I can tell.  Can you describe youself physically to me (I can learn the 
emotional and the physiological from your print)  ?

 
 Well I'm very short, and I have flowing auburn hair, dark brown eyes, and 
very  sensual lips, I love to kiss with these lips. I am also very 
physically inclinded.

Hmmm.  That is good to know.  How would you describe your build, and how 
short?

 Why do I feel like I'm filling out an application for a modeling position 
on Let's Make a Deal?


Sorry, just tell me your Social Security #, and your last place of employment,
and we will be done with the preliminaries.

hahahaha! That is so funny I don't think I will ever be able to stop 
laughing...............................hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahaha
 HA!

Boy you really got a good ole' belly chuckle out a' that one didn't ya'?

No.

Mmmmm?  Confusion.  Seriously though, could you describe your build (it helps
to formulate an image, you can lie if you need to)

Why would I need to lie. I'm not Humpty Dumpty or something like that....<G> 

Laugh!!  Well, an honest description.  Here is where I start to get down on my-
self:  If you are what you say, why would you waste your time talking to some-
one so much younger than yourself, when you no doubt could do much better?

 Well, I like people, especially young people.

That no doubt makes the "young peope" very happy.  Can you give me an example
of one way in which you express your fondness for the youth?


I enjoy the stamina of youth, it seems that the youthful ones are the 
only one \s that can keep up with my demands.......

Laugh.  That is probably true, and quite errotic.  Hmm.  You can ask me 
anything that you want to, (and I might just even answer it for you)

 Do you have any problems in your life right now? I feel that there is 
something that you are not telling me, something that you aren;t  
comfortable talking about with other people.

Hmmm Very observant LadyHawke Holmes,  I have had a similar occurance to 
what is currently taking place with another member on the board who is 22.  
She is some-what of a nympho (used completely as a compliment) and wants 
to meet me some-where in actual life, yet I have repetedly asked for 
a number, or someway to contact her, and she responds with more T-Grams 
so errotic I'm embarred to read them.  But....she won't let me contact her.  
I don't know if this is intentional or not, but its a little frustrating.  
I guess that I am really just looking 
for some kind of substance, some real life thing to cling to, and she 
just ends up taunting me.  :(  Sorry to ramble on...

Don't appologize, I asked you for goddess sake.....I really hate it when 
people appologize all over the place. I like hearing you talk, and I 
would also like to help you with anything you are dealing with.

See, here's the deal.  We could have chat sex, I could get a brief high out of
it, and then it would be a memory.  I understand that contacting people 
outside the board for that purpose is not usually done, and I don't 
blame anyone for that.  It is just I have so much energy built up 
inside, have no where to release it, and become very frustrated.  
I hope you can understand me.

 I understand you completely, I know someone who has the same problem 
that you do.

Who is that?

 I'm surprised Bitch Bird...oops I mean Lady bird hasn't told you.

You need to hit enter about 20 times again, I think that you hit 
the home key.

Thank you.

No problem

So you see my problem, tell me someone who has a similar one, but offer me no
advice or help?


 Max is just like you, he has so much energy built up that he is 
constantly looking for ways to release.

OK.  You don't happen to know anyone who is in the buisness of taking highly
charged males and helping them overcome their problems do you?

 You are being very, "amusing" again. Not very subtle are we?

I was actually trying to be very subtle.  I am usually to blunt, I 
will try har-der to be subtle, but I will NOT apologize, in fact 
I'm glad I said it....<G>


 You are ............ something!

 I don't know whether to take that as a compliment, or a come on.

Well, what would you consider a Cum on.

A statement like "I would like to meet you in public, and see how everything 
goes"  To me, that would be a cum on.

 Oh so you like public places? Hmmmmmm.

Well, not personally, but usually they make the other person feel more com-
fortable.  That is my job after all to make other people comfortable, is it 
not?

 And how would someone go about making YOU more comfortable Christopher?
.............Hmmmmmmmmm?

Probably an offer to go to dinner.  Conversation tells a lot about 
someone. And. at dinner (if both parties go there seperately) there is no 
uncomfortableness about if one person wants to leave or does not like 
the other person.  (That was not very poetic sentence structure, but I 
got my point out)

I'm not grading you on grammar Christopher you don't have to worry about 
that.

I didn't say I was sorry though, did i?

No, you didn't and I appreciate that.....What do you like to do?

Come on.  You are bright.  That question is too broad, you need to narrow it 
down a little bit.

And how NARROW would you like me to be.  Hmmmmmm......I think that you 
probably like ..........................................................

What?  Games are fun, but only in bed.  I've said that earlier, and it 
wasn't just a random thought running throught the recesses of my brain.  
You are funny. I like it in a way.  You push me to tell you what I'd like 
to do outside of the meeting (perhaps making me thing subconciously.....)
and then just sit back and say,  Oh, that's intersting..........<G>

I don't play games Christopher. I am a very serious person when it comes to 
 "feelings" both physical and emotional. I have ways of getting the 
information that I need.

Ohh  torture is strictly forbidden under the United Nations provisions of POW in
section 4 paragraph 7, it clearly states "No female may attempt to remove infor-
mation from a perverted male from a BBS, unless the female has the males per-
mission......."

Thanks again.  Have you ever been out on a date to dinner, and you just 
couldn't keep your hands above the table?  It is soo hard to get a 
good meal nowadays.


You are very right, you're capturing this aren't you? Haahahahahahahaha!


Funny.  Anyway, I am soooo frustrated and talking to you makes it worse, but 
I'm a glutten for punishment.  Would Max find you a suitable outlet for his 
frustra-tions?

 Max has found me a suitable outlet, but he has others that he does too.

Well, you're honest.  I admire honesty above most everything else (except 
a fine-ly shaped ass)  LOL

 You're incorigable.

No, I don't even have to be incoriged.  I do it without help...LOL

 I'm sure you do do "it" without help, but do you know how hard it is to 
type with one hand?

I will confess yet another thing:  I do not, repeat do not, partake in 
one-handed self-sports.  Perhaps thats part of my frustration, but if 
its not real, I don't want to touch it.

 You must be VERY frustrated then.  How can you please others if you 
can't please yourself?

Thats the key.  Pleasing others IS pleasing myself.  Without one, the 
other is not possible.  I am sooo philosophical tonight :)  Anyway, did 
you take pity on Max because of his frustrations and let him have his 
way with you?  LOL

 No, I really had no choice in the matter, he has a very strong aura and 
my atrr ...attraction to him was immediate. He is magick....in every 
sense of the wordk.

OK OK, I don't care for the details.  I am REALLY trying to be 
subliminal here witout offending anyone.  It is perfectly all right for 
you to shoot me down, and I will not think any less of you, and will 
attempt to carry on the same kind of friendship we have thus far created. 

 Why would you think I'm shooting you down?

Well, you aren't giving me encouragement.  Snowlock Holmes: Regection 
is not a game where there is a middle ground, you are either accepted 
or not, not a blend of the two.  Since you have not responded to my 
advances, I can assume that I am on the loosing side of the regection.   
Watson:  Mabey there is something 
that you havn't considered Snowlock.  Snowlock:  What's that  
Watson:  I don't know myself, but perhaps now we will.........

You are certainly melodramatic aren't you? You must like the theater.

See you shot me down.

No, I made a statement about your nature.

I do like the theater, but that is because of maternal encouragement to 
attend performances at Little Theater in Dover.  I don't do impressions 
that well though

  You are an intriguing individual Christopher....... I like speaking 
with you, you are fun.


Am I fun enought to just meet you for dinner (see you made me come out 
and dir-ectly ask you, but perhaps that was what you were waiting for?)

 I don't eat food Christopher, I partake of more carnal cuisine.

I could cook up some Macaroni with a heap of Hamburger in it.

 That is very ......... appetizing........

Should I take your second comment back as a no?

 And what comment would that be?

Snowman: Go to dinner?   LadyHawke: I do not eat.


Well it could be interpreted as a no, but it could also mean other 
things............ You are Snowlock Holmes, you tell me.

I can read your mind (or at least do a pretty good impression of doing so), 
and I think that you want to go to a resturant with me.  No commitments, 
no expec-tations, conversation is better in person.  I don't want you to 
think I have alterier motives after all that I just told you, but just 
being able to have a real life meeting with as good of a conversationalist 
would be an honor.

 You are too kind.

Where would you like to go to eat?

":I
 

Hello?

I'm sorry I dropped the keyboard......don't think I'm a klutz please, 
and don't every tell anyone else how much of one I am......Geeeez 
I'm so embarrassed.

I do not think you are a clutz, but you are a fine avoider of questions <G>
Rook to Bishop 3, Where do you want to go to eat at?

Do you know Bishop?

ARGR!!!  Where?

You didbn't answer my question, how is it that a man can avoid a question, 
but a woman can only give in to the will of a man, that seems very stubborn 
and 
 

I have faithfully answered every one of your questions until that last one.  
Please don't think that I am stubborn, for I am, but if you think so, it ruins
the image of my resiliency.  I know bishop, he is a good friend of mine, 
and the same age.  Where do you want to go to eat?

 Didn't I already answer that question?

No, you did not.  If you did, I did not get the response.  I can see you 
laughing over there at my expence. Games are fun, but only in bed.  
Can you repeat your answer?


 You  cna see me laughing can you?  I repeat, I DO NOT PLAY GAMES!!!!! 
 I do not eat food. I have other things that sustain me.

Would you like to meet somewhere a little less.....stuffy?

 Why would you want to meet an old lady like me?

I think that elderly women are more fun..........<G>

 Max thinks the exact opposite. He likes younger people.

You are still capturing this aren't you?.......<G>

Funny.  Where do you want to meet?  (Please tell me where, or just flat 
out say you don't want to meet, I hate to have us have a conflict, and if 
pushed much farther, I will no doubt get too frustrated, and become saddened 
at the conflict that may arise between us)

 That is one of the things about youth that will never cease to amaze 
me.......... why is everyone so impatient.

We have been chatting for and hour and a half.  An hour has been devoted 
entirely to this topic.   A simple "Would you like to go out and where?".  
Patience I have time I do not.

 Time, and what does an obvious youth like yourself know about time, you 
don't have any concept of time, I'm not trying to insult you I'm just 
stating a truth....... I will see you at the meeting.

Mmmmm.  Not before?

 Just trust me,, I will see you at the meeting, we can talk there, then 
we can decide whether or not you still want to go "out" with me.

OK.  I am too young to "go out" with you, but I'm not too young to go out 
with you.  Its a paradox.  

   Please don't push me

that far.  I like to chat and all, but its is just to much tension.

 I know you were getting angry, and you were being very obvious about it. 
I can see more than you may think about people, I am very different from 
any other female you may have crossed paths with in your short lifetime. 
I like you Christopher, but you need to show less of yourself, especially 
to people that you don't know very well. You are an intelligent young 
man, I see that. But don't waste it.

If I have one flaw, it is too much trust in others.  If my confessions made 
you uncomfortable, or in some way made you think that I was less of a 
"man", then they shall cease immediately.

No nothing of the sort, I just want you to know that you don't have to 
be............ a "man" 

with me all of the time.

What else is there to be?

Yourself....Your true self, and don't tell me that you are being your 
true self because i know that isn't the whole truth, maybe some part of 
you is there. But there is a lot lurking inside you that is afraid to 
come out. You don't have to be afraid to show it to me.

Snowlock:  Watson, I believe that she's looking for a confesstion  
Watson: You know, I believe you are right.  What in the devil do 
you think it could be?
Snowlock:  I've no idea, lets ask her to narrow down the topic 
range, but...just to be on the safe side (I am not a homosexual, or 
a bi-sexual)

I know that Christopher, I'm not idiotic or anything. Geeez noone can 
see what I really know can they. Especially not the ones who are my 
enemies......like LB

Well, I do not think that you are stupid or idiotic.  But, I truely 
have noth-ing else within my mind that is private.  Everything of any 
value or cofidment I have already told you.  There is nothing else I think.


You think?

I think, ergo I am.  Wait I thought of something, but its sexually 
oriented, and I percieve that you think I have something hidden that 
does not have to do with sex?

Its something deeper than sex.

Sex is the root from which all drives spring forth.  there is nothing deeper 
than the sex drive.

You don't know much about the human mind then do you?

More than you think.  Tell me what you want to know, and I'll devulge it.

 I can travel the paths of the human mind so easily that you would think 
I was born doing it.  You may not even be aware of thinking a certain way 
about a certain thing, or you may be hiding it from yourself, it comes out 
in the end though.


Now you are starting to talk like MiracleMax.

 What would make you say that? Hmmmmmmmm?

I think that the weather should be warm tomorrow.

Verry funny, ok.

Anyway, you are starting to scare me just a wee might.

Why would you have anything to fear, as long as you don't cross me, 
you are fine. 


enter 20 times (WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THAT!?!?!?!?)

why do I keep doing what?

Hitting the home key.

I'm sorry I think sometimes I just type too damn fast.

Hmm.  I have nothing to fear, but by that last statement, I fear even more.

Do you have a reason to think that there is something you have done that 
would make me cross?

Not to my knowledge, but I believe that you have an alternate handle.



And what might that be?

Wasn't it a nice day today?

 You are a little shit aren't you.....<G>
 No Max is my husband. 

No, Max is your husband.  Or Max is not my husband?

Max is my husband.

That is precisely the kind of relationship I predicted.  You scare me 
almost as much as he does.  I can see why you two get along so well.

Why does he scare you, and why do I for that matter. Simply because we 
can see more than others can?

Well, #1 You taunt me by drawing me into your personal chat telephone line.  
#2 You allow me to tell things about myself I would rather not have, simply 
because you appear to be a listening and kind ear  #3 You use your 
influence as a woman and as an object that I would seek to further 
extract information  #4 you get me angry to the point the you finally 
release me, but only conditionally.  #5 You tell me that I am hiding 
something, which I am not, and which is "not so deep that I can not even 
tell I'm hiding it.  

I am not God, and do not profess to be, nor have I ever lived before, and 
after my physical body dies, I will die forever, for there is no such 
thing as a soul.

You have been talking to other people too much.

Only very few sentences, and the rest was guesswork.  You know that I'm a 
smart kind of "guy" so that part is belivable.  I don't know what you are 
trying to profess, but I am not in the posision to adopt a new philosophy.

 Who is professing anything.  I simply see what i see, 

The mear fact that you are married allowed you to know that there was no 
chance of my going out with you.  You knew that, and still pretended that 
such a thing was possible.

And what makes you think that Max is so shallow as to not let me do as 
I please.......

What makes you so shallow as to think that I would have sex with a married 
gal. Since religiously I would not have a problem with it, it would be OK 
in my book.

Yet, socially I do not need the reputation of Adulterer.

 Are you trying to get me angry?


Look at what I type.  I only profess the truth.  Call me on anything that you
want.  I am not TRYING TO GET YOU ANGRY, though that may be the end result of
what my words produce.  And a apologize a thousand fold for that.

I just don't want you to think that I can be tricked so easily into getting
 angry, because I don't get angry unless someone give me a reason to be.

I don't care if you do or do not get angry.  that point is not germain to 
this discussion.

 Isn't it?  I'm not so sure, you seem to be very close to anger.

You sound like a wind up psychologist.  Tell me, what would the normal 
reaction of anyone be who had been teased such as I have been?

 I have not teased you.

Then you have admitted that you will sleep around while married.  Its one or 
the other, there is no middle ground.


 Whether I sleep around as you put it is not the issue, it is when and who 
I choose to do it with that counts and there must be some special reason, 
not just sex that would make me no better than a common whore. Like some 
other people I know, who will remain nameless <G>

You have admitted it, that was all I was concerned with establishing it.  You 
say that sleeping around is not the issue.  I think it is, isn't it?  You 
seem a little insecure about that aspect of life, as if you are hiding 
something.

 Of course I'm hiding something. Why would I give away all of my secrets.

Thats just it.  You deny even yourself to your hidden thoughts.  You must un-
derstand that this kind of action will only lead to harm.

  Don't tell me about my thoughts, I am the only one who knows about my 
thoughts....................... 

You think that you know yourself, yet you deny yourself that basic necessity 
of life:  Honesty to one's self.  You may think you know your own thoughts, 
but it is just a delusion.


LB has many delusions, doesn't she?

You have mentioned her several times.  I think that you fear her, and yet 
are attracted to her.  You won't even allow yourself the luxury of knowing 
which.

I know exactly how I feel about her, she is using people, she is talking to 
the wrong peolple about the wrong thing. I will not let her do that. I will 
not let her get away with that sick shit. She's worn my patience and if she 
isn't careful I will be forced to show my hand, and I'm carrying all the 
aces.

You avoid the real issue superbly.  On the exterior you hate Ladybird, but in-
side you love her.  There is no use denying it, for you can't even know that
yourself, it is too deep for you to comprehend.                          

You are amusing Chris.

Yes, and I am not God.  This is a real "enlightening" conversation that I 
have been having with you Justine.

 You are not very good at slipping, and you may think whatever you want to, 
only I know the truth.

Physically you and MiracleMax are two seperate entities, yet spiritually, 
and intellectually, you are one.

 No, he's alot stronger and more powerful than I, that is why I'm handling 
Lady bitch and not him, he would most likely have disposed of her a long 
time ago.

Power is destructive, and absolute power is absolutely destructive.  
To end ones life or to do something evil such as "disposing of her" 
indicated a vindictive personality, one devoid of copassion for human 
life.  Care for others is a basixtennant of existance, and to speak 
so indicates the beginning of the end.

 You don't really know what you're saying do you, you think that all of 
this sounds intelligent and good, but you're just making a fool of 
yourself , I know what has to be done and I am doing it. Noone is going to 
get in my way especially not the likes of a pissant like LB.

You now finally get the point I have been trying to make.  "you think that 
all of this sounds intelligent and good".  On the contrary, I have been 
spuing pure unadulterated shit for the past 15 minutes and only now has it 
dawned upon you that it is garbage.  The reason I have been doing this is 
to show you by example the type of sentences you used upon me not too long 
ago, and to indicate that MiracleMax is in fact a very weak man, who uses 
words to confuse and pursuade.

 That is too bad. I'm sorry you think that way, 


Well, you don't get angry, or so you said, so I will take you at face value.  I 
have noticed that you feel Ladybird is preventing you from doing something,
something that "noone is going to get in my way"  something important.  Yet it
is you against world and for that I pity you.

 Me against the world? I would hardly consider her so important.

Tuchee, she by herself is not, but the feelings you try to expell on others 
are so contrary to basic morals that she can quickly become nearly ALL when 
and if the time arrives.

 Good boy. 

Good gal.  I will not degrade you as you have done me, because unlike you 
I am not angry, I am amused.  You preech a good book, but you have to live 
up to it.

I am an aggresivly pursuasive individual and to think that you could sway 
me was from the start a loosing game.

And you are foolish to think that I didn't know who you really were.

And who might that be?

Her "special friend"

Oh contrar, I was very angry to learn the identity of Casper.  I am opposed 
to bi-sexuality, and to have a friend such as her be one was quite a 
shock.  I am still opposed to it, and she knows it.  Yet, we are friends.  
I do not defend her, for that is her responsibility, not mine.  For this 
reason, I let all of your comments about her fly past me.

Even if she is doing something morally wrong and illegal.

Morally wrong, and until now I did not know "illegal" but I will not 
challenge your knowledge of laws.  As far as being a "special friend", all 
of my friends are "special".  I would not go around saying to people.  
You are a good "common friend" of mine.


hahaha!, That is good, that wouldn't be fair to others, but it still 
doesn't change the fact that she is doing wrong and it involves children, 
I'm a mother and so is she and to think that she could do what she is 
doing makes me sick.

That is too bad.  Without evidence, (which you CAN NOT provide), I will once
again have to dismiss that argument as "speculative and judgemental"  
OVERRULED But, I do not think that you understand what I mean.  I am a 
very rigid person-ality, and you will not be able to budge me.  In 
fact, if I can not budge YOU myself, than at least we will come to a 
standstill..

 I do not stand for very long my friend.

I have the mental stamina of a mountain, and the stubborness of a 
dozen mules.

I can see that, but don't mistake my meaning, I was truthful to you when I 
said that I like you, just don't get in my way, that's all.

I like you as well.  I just dont' trust you.  I don't mean that as a 
criticizm, it is just the way I feel.  Also, I am SUCH a rebel, that I 
usually will undertake causes (such as providing you an oposition or 
"getting in your way". Were it not for me, the "Canton Connection Meetings" 
would not exist.  This is the extent of my  influence and power.

Do you think that impresses me?

It is not meant to.  It is mearly a statement of my (not intentions) basic
drives.  King, to Knight 4

 I have enough people that i have to deal with, you are not one of them 
and I wnat it to stay that way.  I will do what I have to. Please don't 
make me feel that you are going to be a problem.

Once I find out exactly what it is that you are espousing, should I be so 
com-pletely opposed to it, that I fear for others, you will indead find 
me in your way.  Should this occur, we should still be able to chat like 
this without anger.

I mean no harm to others, I just want to do what I have to do. That 
inclusdes whatching out for those who can't nessesarily see what they 
have in front of them.

You keep talking about your mission.  Perhaps you would care to impart 
what is so god-awful important.  If you do not, I will understand that 
you are either planning something malign in nature, you are secretive, or 
you are embarrased of the plans.

 I would love to tell you, but you would not hear it well, becasue you see 
that only ones that know are the ones that are supposed to know. And as 
I know that you are not one of those, I can not tell you.

Well, that is a likely story, and covers that nice ass of yours nicely.  
I expected some kind of response (like the one you told me was intelligent 
sounding, but nonscence) like that.

I'm sorry that you are so non trusting of me, I told you the truth, 
take it or do not take it, you will hear no more about it from me.

That is just as well.  I think that I look forward to this kind of conflict 
in a sadistic sort of way ...<G>  This is too serious.  You will think me 
mad, but what are you dressed in?

those drives again?.....<G>

What can I say, they are on a time schedule.


I am wearing a long t-shirt, it has a silly looking rabbit on it.

Can I just say something.  Though we seem to be arguing about nothing, you 
have to admit that it is very rewarding in a way to banter with someone who 
is your intellectual equal, don't you?

I will not insult you by challenging that remark, but you have not lived 
long enough to be my equal.

What I lack in experience, I make up for in imagination....<G>  That was 
not the jist of my thought though.  Isn't it somehow rewarding for you to 
talk to me?

Only if you make it worth my while.  And thus far you have.

Good, we don't have to be so serious all of the time.  Debate is good, but 
is augmented by the ocasional comic relief.  I don't know how you can remain 
so solid for so long.

Because i know what has to be done, you don't.

Stop it stop it.  No more serious talk.  I can't take it with only 3.5 hours 
of sleep to look forward.  Can we partake in a more....enjoyable style of 
prose chat before I must lay my weary head to bed?


Yes I suppose that we could, but could I get something to drink first, 
I'm dying of thirst over here.

Fine go ahead, I'll wait a minute

Thank you.......Hello?

Hello I'm back sorry I took so long.

Did you have ta' go potty too?

You brat.

laugh....

Yes I had to tinkle.

LOL.  This is fun.  I hope you don't like me "Chris" anymore.

I'm sorry, but you got me poed.

Poed?

Sorry no punctuation P.O.ed

Oh OK.  End of that.  (Can we agree in the future that no matter how riled 
up we get, we will always show each other the basic courtesy of politeness 
though)

 I guess that is not too much to ask.....<G>

Anyway, you were telling me about your T-Shirt with the silly little animal 
on
it...

 And what was that animal?

Just let me think a sec (I remember, I really do) Hmmmm  a rabbit?

You cheated.

<G>  How could you tell?


I live with a programmer, did you expect me not to know you were looking at 
the  spillover.

LOL,  You know, I actually kind of love you in a weird ASCII sort of way.  I 
can't get away with too much.  Things which I could easily pull on others are a
challenge (though not impossible <G>) to pull on you.

 I love you too.

Then the sentiment is shared equally.  What is your warm little bottom 
adorned with?

 My "warm little bottom" is adorned with the couch I am sitting on.

What cloth covers its face?

 I think I just told you.

I was in denial..  You are bare?

 I always go without when I am at home.

Hey, if you can't be free at home, where can ya' be?

That is what I have always felt.  I even used to go outside with nothing 
on before, but I can't do that where I am now.

Too many peeping Tom's huh?

 Well yeah, but its the neiborhood. Its just not conducive to the 
tingling sensation I used to get when I would "streak"


:)  You mean that at this very moment, you could reach down and strock your 
glossy legs without any resistance from fabric?

Yes Christopher, I could.........

Hmm.  You can ask me some questions now, but I doubt the'll be as rewarding 
asyour answers were.

 What kind of skin do you have? 

Hmmmm.  Creamy, unblemished from any pre-Spring tan, soft, hairy around 
the legs, and heads, and very touchable.

Don't think I didn't see that subliminal message that you gave me.....<G> 
It wouldn't make a bit of difference anyway.......

Well you sure as heck think I was odd if I was black and complained about 
not having a tan wouldn't you?  But anyway, next question (this is fun)

What is the most touchable part of your body?

The second most touchable part of my body is my face, it is so warm and wel-
coming, that you just want to bury yourself in it....

 That wasn't what i asked now was it.......<G>

No it wasn't, but you can ask something else....

What is the most expressive feature about your face?


My eyes, I can permutate them into so many different combinations of 
posistions that I could wear a mask concealing everything but my eyes, 
and I could show exactly what I was feeling, (right now, they are hanging 
kind of low)

Do you smoke?

No

Do you smoke other things?....<G>

No  I'm just your ole' clean cut "oh-he's-so-nice-but-I'd-never-date-him" 
sort of Ohioan guy.

What do you think of forigners?

They usually don't put out as fast.  And unless they are Scandinavian, 
they do't look as good generally.

 TSk tsk tsk.

What was wrong with that answer?

You don't know what I might be?

I didn't say that they were ugly.  I just said that Scandinavians look better
generally.  You could be drop-dead sexy, and to me the fact would still be 
true.

 What do you think of accents?

It depends on which ones.  Each one has a different connotation in my mind.

British accents.

Generally sound scholorly.  Can range from snobby to low class, but most 
people generall fit into the middle.


You truly have a fascinating view of things that you don't really know about.

Thats part of my charm.

Is it?

Yes

Are you tired?

Yes, but not too tired, if you know what I mean.

I know exactly what you mean.

Its never a bad time for Orange Juice.

Depends on how its squeezed.....

Personally I like mine fresh and pulpy.

Hello?

I'm here. 

It was your turn to talk.

I know.

Are you OK?

I'm thinking of something.

We are on a beach in southern Sacremento.  Walking slowly, the salt air

what you say mean, and how did it pertain to an errotic environment?

It means "the way of the water"

Are you too tired for this kind of encounter.  I know that at your age, you 
just don't have the endurance that you used to.  If you are too tired then by all 
means get some sleep....<G>

Nice try Christopher.

Add some detail or please tell me something errotic to keep the flow moving.

do you not know what the statement refers to.

No, I assumed it meant good ploy into making me make you think that you were 
too old.  What did I misunderstand?

Well, it is in the way of the water that we find the motions of love making.

The waves are rhythmic.

Very good.

Thats part of my charm.

Hello?

I'm here.

What in the hell are you doing?

That is a very good question.

Good Night.


Why do you say that?

I am too tired to keep pushing to make this happen.  If you can't or won't 
put forth some effort of your own, its not worth it.

That isn't very patient of you.

I sat there 2 times for quite a while while not a character appeared on the 
screen, yet the minute I typed "hello" you were there.

Yes, that is usually the polite thing to do, when someone speaks to you.

I will not play these games.  I am sad that after all of this you do this.

And what am I doing? Not giving you what you want........ I told you I 
dont play games, and I don't like being pushed.

I wasn't pushing.  2 times it was your turn to talk.

 I know, I was thinking about something, you interupted my thoughts.

Sorry, but I can't live a life of not knowing if your next responce will take 20
seconds or 2 minutes.

 What do you have a stopwatch or something....sheeesh!

I just gave you ample time to at least start the thought that you were 
thinking.

 You wouldn't like ti.


No, I don't suppose I would.  I'll see you later.  And I will be 
inquiring many things about you from others, so don't think I'm going 
behind your back.  I'm telling you flat out, I'm going to try to find 
out as much as I can.

 That is fine with me.

good night

Good night Christopher, I'm sorry if you didn't get what you were 
looking for, but that is sometimes the way life is.

Sometimes life throws you a curve ball, and sometimes it just a LadyBird
NO CARRIER

  Re:


    I recommend to all who are interested in the Celtic customs and
 lifestyles that they read THE PENDRAGON CYCLE:

               They are in three volumes:

                       BOOK ONE - Taliesin

                       BOOK TWO - Merlin

                     BOOK THREE - Arthur


    I'm sure that you will enjoy these books as much as Idid , and
please leave any comments or ideas posted here.  Anything involving
Celtic lifestyle or related topics can be posted here.  Also anything
dealing with Arthurian Legend is in its proper place here. I will answer
all posts promptly..
                       Thank you

  who takes an interest in this subject is free to post here, Perhaps
   you could provide me with more information about the Games in Canal
  Fulton...I have never attended but I would be very int finding out
   more about it.

               Again thank you for posting,  I look forward to hearing
           from you again.
