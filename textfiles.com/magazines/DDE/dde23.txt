Hello, kids, and welcome to another wonderful edition of Distorted
Digital Erection. Before we get to the main feature ... allow me 
to say that DDE is now being carried on another bulletin board. 
The Sewer, in Dayton, is now a DDE support board. Its sysop, the
Aligator King, was just up here in Canton and took home with him
the wonders of DDE #1-21 and through the amazing technology of 
Internet, will be receiving each and every one of them. Wow. And
now:

                   'Twenty Reasons to HATE MTV!'
                      - amphetamine gobbler -


1. Kennedy.
2. That geek on 120 Minutes.
3. Mike Judge makes fun of them - and they don't even know it.
4. They consider Tori Amos to be 'alternative.'
5. They like U2.
6. They're subverting Henry Rollins.
7. They promote Pearl Jam, but NOTHING ... and I mean NOTHING ..
   about the Screaming Blue Messiahs. Fuck them.
8. Its on the air 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
9. Kurt Cobain - in a coma? Big news. Frank Zappa - dead? No big
   deal.
10. They think Elvis Costello is 'alternative,' too. 
11. Stone Temple Pilots was a 'Buzz Clip.'
12. Ninety-eight percent of 120 Minutes are bands on major labels.
    Of course, indie bands aren't REALLY alternative.
13. That geek on 120 Minutes deserves TWO entries on this list.
14. Geeks from the Real World end up being the new star on their
    silly dance-club shows.
15. Kurt Loder feels completely at ease making snide remarks about
    Vanilla Ice ... and then goes on to praise the work of Eddie
    Vedder, like he's some avant-garde musical genius.
16. Those fucking Art Institute commercials.
17. I want to hear Green Day sing the word 'shit' ... damn it!
18. The MTV Awards show.. oh, god. Isn't that enough?
19. 120 Minutes is the show where you go 'into the future' ...
    although nearly every band on there is at least three years
    old.

   - and last, but certainly not least -

20. Pauly Shore!

COMING SOON, from DISTORTED DIGITAL ERECTION:

  1. A special preview of "Son of _Big Bush Fan_" ... 
  2. An UPDATE on the infamous DDE #21.
