                 GîtterdammerÅng vs. GlenOak High School

** Most people know that I had a lot of trouble with my high school
   during my senior year. Here is an article I wrote for the EAGLE,
   while I was on the editorial page, that kind of talks about one
   of the unfortunate incidents I was involved in. Enjoy. **


   While writing this editorial, I was forced to re-evaluate two 
journalistic conventions. The first is a primary rule of editorial 
journalism: "criticize the institution, not the individual." This 
idea has guided my articles for the past three years and I have
concluded to continue adhering to it. The second is a personal 
conviction: "refrain from using the first-person." Although the scope 
of editorial writing frequently includes this style, I have felt that 
it is a poor choice. However, I have obviously disregarded this rule
to facilitate writing this particular article, because it is partly 
anecdotal in nature. Please remember that the following story is just 
that: a story. It is written from my perspective and other versions 
may exist.
   While in a class that is set in the Macintosh lab at GlenOak, I was 
typing an assignment for AP English. Many of the students in this 
class utilize the advanced equipment for this same purpose. Upon 
printing the assignment (which was a collection of my short stories)
the advisor told me to let her see it. I said no, since the stories 
were for me and were snugly put away in my bookbag. An ultimatum was 
presented to me: give the stories to her or be written up for 
insubordination. I gave up the document and was promptly written up 
for profanity. I was subsequently suspended. My appeal to the 
principal was denied and as of this writing, I am dubiously being 
recommended for expulsion.
   This example illustrates two transgressions at GlenOak. First, that 
students' right to privacy is severely limited and second, that 
students' right to freedom of expression is also limited. The 
document was for my eyes only. It was not for public consumption and 
did not create a classroom disturbance. Additionally, regardless of 
school code, the profanity in the document was used for strictly 
literary purposes. 
   Fortunately, the Supreme Court disagrees with GlenOak's policies. In 
Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), 
the Court rules that students are individuals who retain their 
constitutional rights during the school day. As Professor Robert
J. Shoop writes, schools "may not be enclaves of totalitarianism" 
under this ruling. How can a school prepare students for a democratic 
society, he argues, through a dictatorial process?
   Perhaps for both ethical and legal reasons, Plain Local should 
consider what the Supreme Court has to say regarding students' 
rights.
   I certainly expected as much, but perhaps I am just cursed with undue 
optimism.
