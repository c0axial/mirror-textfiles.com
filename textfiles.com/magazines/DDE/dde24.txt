FUCK! Fuck. This always happens. I go looking through my old buffers
and all the other shit I have from telecom ages past, and I begin 
to remember the fun ol' days, when life was worth living. Here
assembled is a collection of TDL/Necropolis users from the Winter
1992. This is a rather recent time, though, so be expecting something
from a lot longer coming up. But for now, enjoy. It should bring 
back some old memories.

These were the days when users were users and rodents were rodents.
And we all had user numbers. Christ, I can't believe we had user
numbers. 

Sidewinder - The original ... the only ... the co-sysop. Wow.
His Grace - And, oh my, yet another co-sysop, replacing Sidey.
Elminster - Jesus, he's been around forever. User #46!
Iron Eagle - Where'd he go? Wait ... he's back! Is he? Umm..
The Mistress - The woman with twenty last names!
Power Man - A user that everyone loved to hate.
Cochise - Whatever happened to hi- Krell? Ratlung? What?
Ceasaro - I can't tell. Leech or one of the best users? Hm.
Spew Queen - I can't live life without her. 
Watson - Another one of those: whatever happened to?
The Womanizer - Our only defense against the Lord.
Prince of Darkness - Was this guy ALWAYS on acid or what?
Chris - Remember her? Just for a little while?
Mr-bad-example - The champion of the USS Paramount!
Quantum - "Oh, shit... was that your leg? Sorry."
Strider - "Wow, Larry! What're these? Balloons?"
Napoleon - Ugh.
Beef Jerky - You just gotta love those Music Mags, huh?
Elvis - Remember him? Yeti's friend.
Yeti - Also known as Barney Gumble on Arrakis.
Deity - Finally that little brat moved away. 
Cyberpunk - Yod Yawannablowmelikemymomneverdid.
The Cultist - Wasn't this evil incarnate?
Goldfish - Remember him? At the MMfMD?
Varicose Brain - Christ, one of the only 300 bauders left!
Cleopatra - Boy, did she ever sizzle my circuits.
MC Rad - Part of the growing telecom hood.
Sentinel - Wow! Remember him? The right-wing FREAK?
Tape God - Part of the Louisville Invasion.
Midiman - One of those users everyone likes.
Mac - Hey, remember him? Well, remember those E-MAIL buffers?!
Semidri - What the FUCK ever happened to him?
Shaboo - And you thought TCC was the first to deal in modem perversion!

  and, you just KNOW who I have to save for the VERY, VERY last..
  someone who never graced us on the Necropolis, oh... but we 
  think of her like part of the family...

      FAIR LADY!

"Hey.. you messin' wit' Fair Lady? You want to ruin her modelin'
 career? Da family will take care o' ya... eeder dat or we'll
 send Dan to tackle ya!"

Well, this ends our nostalgic trip for this time. Let's just end
with something that might just sum up the experiences we've all
had on the Necropolis. This is a New User (of JEW User, really)
message from none other than the immortal Edorhas:
