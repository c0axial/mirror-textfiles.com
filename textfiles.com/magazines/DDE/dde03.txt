Isn't that just a MONSTER? Damn!

Ok, let's move to the point of this little eensy-beeny text file.
This is going to be a short one. That's all there is to it.

I was swirling about the arch-nemesis, shall we say, of our entire
way of life - Canton Connection - when I noticed something so silly.
But before I get to that, can I just say: "Of course?" That's what
I thought when I read THIS on the famed Wall:

         Will the Girls be table dancing on the tables at the picnic?
            I think the Tcc Girls are a wild group of modem users:)

Geez... what a picnic THAT'LL be! 

Anyway, I was looking at something on TCC and thought: Jesus, man,
that's propaganda!

Check it out:

  To: ** ALL **                                                            
  Re: Some Stats for TCC                                          (1 reply)

 Here are some ineteresting statistics that I have gathered about our
 system, and how many calls and downloads it has per day.


 CANTON CONNECTION BBS

 Average calls per day:            162

 Average Downloads per day:         74

 Average Meg's Downloaded per day:  22 MEGS

 Messages per day (Local and Net): 549


 These figures are spectacular! Thanks to all the people who make TCC a
 part of thier life, our average calls per day is at 162! If everyone
 just spent 1/2 of an hour online, that would be 81 hours of use packed
 into just 24 hours!

 Just look at it like "We pack over 3 DAYS worth of use, into one day!"

 Another nice number is our 74 DOWNLOADS per day. Some times, I have
 seen that number go as high as 160, from our CD's alone! When we
 figured the number of MEGABYTES we transfer each day, it came to 22
 MEGS.

 Just look at it like "We fill a whole 20 MEG HARD DRIVE each day!"

 Messages per day is a really high number. This is due to the amount of
 mail/messages that we get from out MailLink areas. When you combine the
 private email with our local forum messages, that adds up to alot of
 mail!

 Ohh and BTW, we also handle over 170 TELEGRAMS per day! :)

Ok, now by reading that, you would assume that TCC has over 500
local messages a day - which would be roughly 5 times that of
the Necropolis. Now, a prudent user would stop and think, "Geez,
I only read about 5 messages a week on here from the local subs.
They must be getting around 544 MailLink messages." BUT! Note
that Chaos did NOT separate local from echo in the stats. And
why is that? Well, let's just find out. Taking a peak into the
MailLink logfiles, we can discover that:

 164 msgs processed in packet


Now, look closely. There were 164 messages in the latest packet. 
PLUS... the 554 that is also listed up there. Now, I'm no math
wizard, but that's a lot more than the 549 that Chaos quoted!
So, we can deduce that TCC has a NEGATIVE amount of local messages
a day, on the average.

Do you SEE what it has come to? Oh God- I beg for the days of
honesty... and truth... and justice... free love... cheap bud..

Then I thought: well, geez. Sorc posts whenever there is a NEW
record in posts ... isn't that propaganda? Maybe. But when Sorc
does it, it is with a more pride issue .... rather than a
subversive form of convincing people that tons of local messages
are posted a day!

BUT! One lone vigilante ... who we all know and love but not by
this handle ... stood up amount the herds of common cattle and
spoke the voice of truth:

A user known as Falstaff asked: "How many LOCAL messages, though?"
Just look at the double-talk answer he gets! E-mail, MailLink,
local, ahh... huh?

 I assume you mean how many our OUR LOCAL users write messages. Well,
 that would be easy to figure. Its close to 120 message created
 locally. EMAIL takes a good part of that, plus the local foums have
 about 10 or 15 a day if you read them all.  So , yes, I would say that
 115 - 120 message per day WRITTEN on Tcc (not inclunding Newtwork).

  Chaos :)

(R)eply, (E)mail reply, follow (T)hread, (P)revious or (N)ext message? 

Oh, so there are 10 - 15 messages posted on ALL the local forums..
BUT BUT BUT 120 messages a DAY WRITTEN ON TCC! WOW! 120!

Whatever. I think we all can see through this idiocy. 

Thank you, boys... and have a good one.
