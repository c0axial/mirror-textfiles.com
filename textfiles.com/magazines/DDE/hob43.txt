Part 1: Editor's Comments

   Just a small note to let readers know that future issues of HOB will
be of wider interest. I'm going to attempt to steer the 'zine towards
topics of wider interest to the telecom community in general rather than
making the 'zine predominantly a source for local issues and information.
As always we will gladly accept submissions from just about anyone on just
about any topic. Drop me a note in e-mail or on Radio KAOS BBS.

Part 2: Hey, I thought HOB #42 was the *last* issue?

   Well, since you're reading this, obviously it wasn't. If you read the
supposedly last issue of this 'zine I declaired that the Stark County
modem community was dead and that the future of telecom was on the
internet. Well, I was wrong. Atleast for the moment.

1. Skyrocketing on-line service costs

   The major on-line services such as America Online, Prodigy, and
Compuserve charge in my opinion outrageous rates. It's not at all
impossible for someone to end up with a $100 monthly bill if they spend
a considerable amount of time online with one of these services.

2. The Internet can be less than warm and friendly.

   The Internet is really huge. It's sometimes a good deal of work
just to find what you want in terms of information. The Internet is
often very much like a huge shoping mall. Large and impersonal.

   Computer bulletin boards provide a way for people to enjoy their
modem hobby without huge costs (providing they use a free BBS system).
They also allow for a more personal form of communication by allowing
users who live in the same general area to communicate with each other
concerning topics and issues they have in common. It's unlikely that
the folks in the alt.fan.bob-larson or alt.discordia newsgroup are
going to have much insight in to what's going on in a local political
race, a local high school, or at a local theatre.

   Bulletin Board Systems will continue to provide a valuable service
for people for some time to come. What's interesting is that there are
many people now on the internet who have never even BEEN on a BBS!
SysOps have a new challenge of luring 'net users back to the fold of
local telecom.

=============================================================================

Part 3: The Canton Connection. Have old modem users sold out?

   I don't have the desire to re-hash all of the old issues concerning the
past of the Canton Connection BBS. Previous issues of the DDE or HOB
'zines should give you atleast some sort of understanding of what went
on. Suffice it to say, the TCC of today is very different from the TCC of
previous years.

   Ex-Necropolis sysop Ryan Baguerous (Amphetamine Gobbler/Sorc/Gott) has
accused former Necropolis users who now call TCC of having "sold out" and
gone over to the enemy. I don't agree.

   First, TCC has undergone major changes in the years since the Necropolis
& TCC modem wars. Pornographic/adult materials are now less in evidance on
the system. Second, the sysops seem to have finally decided to take
a more hands-off approach to running the system. I've seen people make
comments about certain topics that I know atleast one sysop would not
appreciate and no one has been attacked or banned. Finally, TCC offers
telnet access to the internet for a nominal fee. For someone like myself
who has an older system, it just doesn't make sense to pay $20 a month
to a ISP provider for services I really wouldn't be able to exploit
to the fullest. Additionally, the presence of ex-Necropolis BBS members
has helped to spark interest in message base participation. There was
a time when you wouldn't see a new post on TCC for a week or more at a
time.

   If the TCC staff were engaging in oppressive activities; suppressing
speech and baning users who disagreed, and if they were allowing just
anyone to access the adult materials on their system I would not call it.
Internet telnet access or no telnet access. If I called TCC despite
such conditions I would then agree that I had "sold-out". However, such
is not the case. Xpietoe/Albanara, a former Necropolis user, is well
known for his Christian beliefs. I really doubt he would be on TCC as
a user any more than I would if such activities still occured. If new
information comes to light that is outside of my personal experiences, I
would definately look at it and perhaps reevaluate my position. As for
now, however, I have no problem being a user of today's TCC BBS.

   "Sold Out" ... gosh, i'm starting to feel like an alternative rock
star that decided to sign to a major label! Too bad I don't get the
money that would go along with such a scenario!
