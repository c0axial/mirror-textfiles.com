                       'A Comparison of 216 & 513'
                             by the Ferret

 First of all, I'd like to reckognize a few folks that made this
 little t-file that much fun... Goldilocks, Visigoth, Killer,
 Quicksilver, and Xavier.  They've provided me with support and
 kept me up until 3 am every night (bastards).

 As you probably don't know, my old handle used to be Sidewinder.
Now, however, I've switched to The Ferret.  Sidewinder was getting
old and frankly, it was stupid.  So, I moved on down to (513)
(temporarily, to attend school) and changed my handle.  I also run a 
part-time board (2am-10am) which is a theme board; it's a Sewer.  
So, in taking part with the theme of the board, I use the handle of 
Alligator King there.
               
 Summary of My Handles:
               
  Sidewinder        --    Old (216) Handle
  The Ferret        --    New (513 and 216) Handle
  Alligator King    --    Only used on my board

 My internet address is:

   TKEEFER@UDCPS3.CPS.UDAYTON.EDU      -or-
   KEEFERTR@UDAVXB.OCA.UDAYTON.EDU

 Anyway, enuff about me.  This file is about the differences (and
 similarities) between the modem community of (216) and (513).
 I'll be focusing on the Dayton area of (513) and the Canton area
 of (216).  So, without further DO..LOOP, on to the file... 
 (God damn that was stupid.)

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "The Comparison"

  An analysis of the differences between (513) and (216)

 The differences and similarities between the (513) and (216)
 area code a many.  They cover both the insubstantial as well
 as the material.  However, I've found that the most drastic
 theme to contrast is the immaterial.  I'll cover all
 these below.

   Material Differences
   --------------------

  First, the number of bbss in the two area codes are vastly
  different.  Specifically, my dialing directory has 245 entries
  for Dayton.  My Canton dialing directory had about 20.  The
  number of bulletin boards in the Dayton area is astounding.
  Although Dayton is about 3-4 times the size of Canton, the 
  number of bulletin boards in the Dayton area is disproportional
  to its size (if you count Canton as the standard).  At last
  count, Dayton had:
 
   65 Wildcat
   19 SuperBBS
   18 Renegade
   15 Remote Access
    8 PCBoard
    7 Cnet
    6 Robo
    4 Maximus
    3 Excalibur
    3 EzyCom
    3 Tag
    3 Major
    and... 3 WWIV BBS's

     (I know these boards don't total 245, but there are a lot of
     boards that run weird BBS progs...)

     Second, the speed of the boards in Dayton is primarily 14.4k.
     Lots of bbss in Canton still run at 2400.  Here in Dayton,
     there are many boards around here that proclaim something
     along the lines of "2400 IS DEAD!!!"  Regardless, the speed
     of boards in (513) breaks down as follows:
    
      3  28.8k
      4  21.6k
     15  19.2k
     27  16.8k
    152  14.4k
     11   9600
     27   2400

 Also note that there are as many 16.8k boards as there are 2400!
 (I lost count a couple of times, so these numbers don't add up
 either, but it's pretty close!)

 Third, Netting Mail is pretty big in (513).  Nearly all boards
 carry some form of off-bbs net.  Some carry Internet e-mail
 access.  The most common nets are: TeenNet, AKANet, and
 FlameNet.
 However, most of these nets are Local nets.  That is, most of
 these messages don't leave the (513) area code.  With over 200
 bbss, it would be nearly impossible to check all of them for
 new mail every day.

 Fourth, the number of users in (513) is astounding.  In addition
 to old users, you see new users _every_ day.  I'll get to what
 these users are like later.  I've been on a couple of bbss that
 claim to have had a quarter of a million calls.

 Fifth, there are more "theme" boards here in Dayton, on average
 than there are in Canton.  When I left (216), there were
 arguably _no_ theme boards.  Most were the standard, run of
 the mill bbss (with the exception of The Necropolis).  In (513),
 with such a large body of users to satisfy, there are a bunch
 of boards that will suit any users needs.  There are boards
 such as For Collectors Only (which specializes in collectables),
 The Train Board (obvious), and Levee (Lesbian/Gay Board... hmm..
 maybe Canton Connection fits in here somewhere).

   Immaterial Differences
   ----------------------

  If I were to typify the normal user here in (513) I would
  use words such as: Leech, Lurker, Lamer, and R0dent.  Most
  of the users here have _NO_ clue what is going on in either
  the modem community or the world in general.  It's as if
  Prodigy suddenly quit operation, and all Prodigy users in 
  the area called the local bbss.

  Fortunatly, there are a good number of _*REAL*_ users in
  (513).  Most, however, are located on Private systems.
  Unlike (216), the number of Private systems here is high.
  I'm not talking about pay boards (of which there are few
  here as well), I'm saying that the board is closed to the
  general public.  These boards are often carriers of HPCAS
  stuff and warez.

  Now, in (216), most of the users that could be described
  as IDEAL users call The Necropolis.  I find that those
  who don't call are either close-minded or mentally
  deficient.  It's easy to tell who is a real user by what
  boards they call.

 As you can see, the differences between (216) and (513) are
 quite distinct.  If you're still reading this dry, bland stuff, 
 then you've got either 1) no life, or 2) an unending interest 
 in modem communities.  Either way, you need serious help.
