Blackened:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Newsted>
Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of mother earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's End
Never will it mend

Never

        Fire
        To begin whipping dance of the dead
        Blackened is the end
        To begin whipping dance of the dead
        Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never

        Fire
        To begin whipping dance of the dead
        Blackened is the end
        To begin whipping dance of the dead
        Color our world blackened

                   Blackened.

Opposition... Contradiction... Premonition... Compromise
Agitation... Violation... Mutilation... Planet dies

   Darkest color
   Blistered earth
   True death of life

Termination... Expiration... Cancellation... Human race
Expectation... Liberation... Population... Lay to waste

   See our mother
   Put to death
   See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never

Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
       
        Fire
        Is the outcome of hypocrisy
        Darkest potency
        In the exit of humanity
        Color our world blackened

                   Blackened.


...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon You'll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower

 
        The ultimate in vanity
        Exploiting their supremacy
        I Can't believe the things you say
        I Can't believe
        I Can't believe the price you pay
        Nothing can save you
        Justice is lost
        Justice is raped
        Justice is gone
        Pulling your strings
        Justice is done
        Seeing no truth
        Winning is all
        Find it so grim
                 So true
                 So real

Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds

        Lady justice has been raped
        Truth assassin
        Rolls of red tape seal your lips
        Now You're done in
        Their money tips her scales again
        Make your deal
        Just what is truth?  I cannot tell
        Cannot feel


EYE OF THE BEHOLDER:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

        Doesn't matter what you see
        Or into it what you read
        You can do it your own way
        If it's done just how I say
        Independence limited
        Freedom of choice
        Choice is made for you my friend
        Freedom of speech
        Speech is words that they will bend
        Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

=-=CHORUS=-=

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

=-=CHORUS=-=
=-=CHORUS=-=



One:
<Hetfield, Ulrich>
I Can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

        Hold my breath as I wish for death
        Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But Can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

        Hold me breath as I wish for death
        Oh please God, wake me

        Now the world is gone, I'm just one
        Oh God, help me hold my breath as I wish for death
        Oh please God, help me

Darkness:  Imprisoning me
           All that I see
           Absolute horror
           I cannot live
           I cannot die
           Trapped in myself
           Body my holding cell

Landmine:  Has taken my sight
           Taken my speech
           Taken my hearing
           Taken my arms
           Taken my legs
           Taken my soul
           Left me with life in Hell


THE SHORTEST STRAW:
<Hetfield, Ulrich>
Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending

Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

        Shortest straw
        Challenge liberty
        Downed by law
        Life in infamy
        Rub you raw
        Witchhunt riding through
        Shortest straw
        The shortest straw has been pulled for you

   =-=CHORUS=-=
   Pulled for you
      Shortest straw
   Pulled for you
      Shortest straw
   Pulled for you
      Shortest straw
   Shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
Your living catch-22
Deluding

A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be

        Shortest straw
        Challenge liberty
        Downed by law
        Live in infamy
        Rub you raw
        Witchhunt riding through
        Shortest straw
        This shortest straw has been pulled for you

=-=CHORUS=-=
=-=CHORUS=-=

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You're reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

        Shortest straw
        Challenge liberty
        Downed by law
        Lie in infamy
        Rub you raw
        Whichhunt riding through
        Shortest straw
        The shortest straw has been pulled for you
                              Pulled for you



HARVESTER OF SORROW:
<Hetfield, Ulrich>
My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give
You Take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

        Anger
        Misery
        You'll suffer unto me

        Harvester of sorrow
        Language of the mad
        Harvester of sorrow

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin

Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

        Anger
        Misery
        You'll suffer unto me

        Harvester of sorrow
        Language of the mad
        Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies

Infanticide

        Harvester of sorrow
        Language of the mad
        Harvester of sorrow
        Language of the mad
        Harvester of sorrow



THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

   
        Old habits reappear
        Fighting the fear of fear
        Growing conspiracy
        Everyone's after me
        Frayed ends of sanity
        Hear them calling
        Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

=-=CHORUS=-=

Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, Hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

=-=CHORUS=-=




TO LIVE IS TO DIE:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton>
When a man lies he murders
   Some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which
   Men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear
   To witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation
   Take me home


DYERS EVE:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
Dear mother
Dear father
What is this Hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear mother
Dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

        Innocence
        Torn from me without your shelter
        Barred reality
        I'm living blindly

Dear mother
Dear father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear Nothing
say Nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother
Dear father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

        Innocence
        Torn from me without your shelter
        Barred reality
        I'm living blindly
        I'm in Hell without you
        Cannot cope without you two
        Shocked at the world that I see
        Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother
Dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew
