LYRICS TO "KILL 'EM ALL" <_METALLICA_>
HIT THE LIGHTS:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>
No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming its right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

        Hit the lights
        Hit the lights
        Hit the lights

You know our friends are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

        Hit the lights
        Hit the lights
        Hit the lights

With all out screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain oh sweet pain
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again

        Hit the lights
        Hit the lights
        Hit the lights


THE FOUR HORSEMEN:
<J. Hetfield, L. Urich, D. Mustaine>
By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company

        The horsemen are drawing nearer
        On the leather steeds they ride
        They have come to take your life
        On through the dead of night
        With the four horsemen ride
        Or choose your fate and die

You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverence rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life

        The horsemen are drawing nearer
        On the leather steeds they ride
        They have come to take your life
        With the four horsemen ride
        Or choose your fate and die

Time
Has taken it's toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

        The horsemen are drawing nearer
        On the leather steeds they ride
        They have come to take your life
        On through the dead of night
        With the four horsemen ride
        Or choose your fate and die


Motorbreath:
<J. Hetfield>
Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never
  Be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean
       
        Moterbreath
        It's how I live my life
        I can't take it any other way
        Motorbreath
        The sign of living fast
        It is going to take
        Your breath away

Don't stop for nothing its full speed
  Or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is
  In my way
Getting your kicks asyou are shooting
  The line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine

        Motorbreath
        Its how I live my life
        I can't take it any other way
        Motorbreath
        The sign of living fast
        It is gonna to take
        Your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is all about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

        Motorbreath
        Its how I live my life
        I can't take it any other way
        Motorbreath
        The sign of living fast
        It is going to take
        Your breath away

JUMP IN THE FIRE:
<J. Hetfield, L. Urich, D. Mustane>
Down in the depths of my firey home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
To join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and i'm the one
You people make me do it
Now It's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down in this pit

        So come on
        Jump in the fire
        So come on
        Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my viens
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child
Not the meek or the mild
But do just as i say

        So come on
        Jump in the fire
        So come on
        Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in every one
So reach down and grab my hand and walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

        So come on
        Jump in the fire
        So come on
       Jump in the fire

Whiplash:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>
Late at night all systems go
You have come to see the show
We do our best you're the rest
You make it real you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fucking mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

        Adrenalin starts to flow
        You're thrashing all around
        Acting like a maniac
        Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
Its hot as hell tonight

        Adrenalin starts to flow
        You're thrashing all around
        Acting like a maniac
        Whiplash

Here on stage the marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass it kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now is the time to let it rip
To let it fucking loose
We are gathered here to maim and kill
'Cause this is what we choose

        Adrenalin starts to flow
        You're thrashing all around
        Acting like a maniac
        Whiplash

The show is through the metal is gone
Its time to hit the road
Another town another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms AND motorways
Life out here is raw
But we will never stop
We will never quit
'Cause we are Metallica

        Adrenalin starts to flow
        You're thrashing all around
        Acting like a maniac
        Whiplash


PHANTOM LORD:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich, D. Mustaine>
Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

        Hear the cry of war
        Louder than before
        With his sword in hand
        To controll the land
        crushing metal strikes
        On this frightening night
        Fall onto your knees
        For the Phantom Lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear the crying dying pains
The fist of terrors breaking through
Now There's nothing you can do

        Hear the cry of war
        Louder than before
        With his sword in hand
        To controll the land
        Crushing metal strikes
        On this frightening night
        For the Phantom Lord

The leathered armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

        Hear the cry of war
        Louder than before
        With his sword in hand
        To controll the land
        Crushing metal strikes
        On this frightening night
        For the Phantom Lord

Fall to your knees
and bow to the Phanotm Lord


NO REMORSE:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>
No mecy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We Don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse foe the helpless one

        War without end
        No remorse no repent
        We Don't care what it meant
        Another day another death
        Another sorrow another breath
        No remorse no repent
        We Don't care what it meant
        Another day another death
        Another sorrow another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats it's way across the land
We Don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

        War without end
        No remorse no repent
        We Don't care what it meant
        Another day another death
        Another sorrow another breath
        No remose no repent
        We Don't care what it meant
        Another day another death
        Another sorrow another breath

Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill at all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

        War without end
        No remorse no repent
        We Don't care what it meant
        Another day another death
        Another sorrow another breath
        No remorse no repent
        We Don't care what it meant
        Another day another death
        Another sorrow another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Souldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take thier abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone hear
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening you
Know death is near
NO REMORSE

SEEK AND DESTROY:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>
We are scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We are looking for you
To start up a fight
There is an evil feeling
in our brains
But it is nothing new
You know it drives us insane

        Running
        On our way
        Hiding
        You will pay
        Dying
        One thousand deaths
        Running
        On our way
        Hiding
        You will pay
        Dying
        One thousand deaths
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy

There is no escape
And that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye
To the world you live in
You have always been taking
But now you're giving

        Running
        On our way
        Hiding
        You will pay
        Dying
        One thousand deaths
        Running
        On our way
        Hiding
        You will pay
        Dying
        One thousand deaths
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire
With the feeling to kill
And it will not go away
Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
Cause You're the one we will find

        Running
        On our way
        Hiding
        You will pay
        Dying
        One thousand deaths
        Running
        On our way
        Hiding
        You will pay
        Dying
        One thousand deaths
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy
        Searching
        Seek and destroy


METAL MILITIA:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich, D. Mustaine>
Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowerdly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it was free
Ripping and tearing

        On through the mist and the madness
        We are trying to get the message to you
        METAL MILITIA
        METAL MILITIA
        METAL MILITIA

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

        On through the mist and the madness
        We are trying to get the message to you
        METAL MILITIA
        METAL MILITIA
        METAL MILITIA
