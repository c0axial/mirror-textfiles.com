JAMES HETFEILD-=-=-Master of lyrics and killer riffs!
James Hetfield is a rarity in Metal<!>a frontman who would rather take a back
seat when it comes to discussing himself and his muzak. The most private
member of Metallica...James has made no secret 0f the fact that he hates
doing interviews and prefers to let his muzak do the talkin'.  On the rare
ocassion when he does speak 0ut, he's VERY h0nest and blunt. In person he can
be shy or outgoing, quiet or loud, depending on his mood. Ask 6 different
people about him and you'll get 6 diffr'nt answers. In addition to composing
and playing wickedly creative riffs, he writes and sings some of Metal's most
intellegent, powerful lyrics and that no one else could ever make them sound
"so grim, so true, so real"
        The son of strict Christian Scientists, James was a quiet kid, and
was into sports<kinda eerie, huh?> His older stepbrother played drums in a
local band and turned James into rock in general, Black Sabbath in
particular. In his junior year, the Hetfields moved from from Downey to
LaBrea, CA, where James attended a "really preppy high school". It was the
kind of place where it was taboo to like sports AND have long hair. James
kept his hair and dove into his guitar. He played f0r a while in "High
School party band" Obsession, doing mostly Zeppelin and Sabbath covers and
latre formed Leather Charm, an outfit he once described as "Not too happenin'"
It was around that time that he met and hooked up wit Ron McGovney, who would
soon be Metallica's FIRST bass player.  Metallica was formed when James
met Lars Ulrich through an ad in RECYCLER 0riginally the bands singer,
James wound up playing rhythm guitar as well when they couldn't find any one
else wit the right feel. Latre Metallica looked into a frontman to give James full concentration
on guitar, but it never happened, so he continued doin' both.
        Metallica just wouldn't be Metallica any other way.

future references!


Now on to part 2...you probably just skimmed the above note from me....

KIRK HAMMETT-=-=-=-Just a normal down-to-earth virtuoso
Kirk Hammett has the destinction of being the most cheerful member of
Metallica. Usally in a good mood and a unfailingly genial, his sunny nature
can belie the fact that he's a very serious, very accomplished guitar player.
        The de late '60, Kirk's older "hippie" brother turned him into Jimi
Hendrix, Santana, Led Zeppelin and other happenin' sounds way back then.
When brother Rick was at school, young Kirk would pick up the guitar and
attempt to play. He seriously began to play at 15 and started a garage bamd
"about two weeks latre". Kirk, a friend who recently got a bass and other guy
who could sing all plugged into one amp in the bassist garage.
        After school, Kirk took jobs in a warezhouse<just kidding> really in
a warehouse and a Burger King(tm)in order to buy guitars and an amp. At age
20, he decided to take guitar lessons and studied with Joe Satriani for a
few years to refine his technique. In '81, Kirk and drummer Tom Hunting,
formed Exodus. They gigged around local and once played on the same bill as
Metallica.(right before the band flew to N.Y. for their 1t LP)
It was while Metallica were out east they decided Dave Mustaine must go.
When kirk recieved a call asking him to join de band, he thought it was an
April Fool's joke. No joke, he flew to New York where he jammed wit James,
Cliff, and Lars. Kirk 'members it being a strange situation cuz he really
didn't know them and they weren't letting on om what they thought of him. He
realized that he was hired when he was included in the recording of
"Kill 'em All". Casual beginning to what would be a momentous relationship.
Kirk's inventive leads and k-k00l attitude are one quarter of what
makes Metallica great.

AHHHHH!  That's better.  Well, hope ya enjoyed part I of this shit.
I would like to thank MOVIE MIRROR for making s0me 0f this possible.....
Shit...I guess that's all from me......go get the next issue or else.
                                                               Splattergut
