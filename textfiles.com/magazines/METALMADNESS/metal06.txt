Well, the long awaited Ride the Lighting is here and I hope you enjoy it.
No small talk here, just on lets get on with it...

FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton>
Do unto others as they have done to you
But what the hell is the world coming to

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

        Fight fire with fire
        Ending is near
        Fight fire with fire
        Bursting with fear

We shall all die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon is here, like said in the past

        =-=CHORUS as before=-=

Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

        =-=CHORUS again!=-=

        Fight fire with fire

        <--repeat the whole thing again,-->
        <--i'm just saving you some bits-->

RIDE THE LIGHTING:<yeah!>
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton, Mustaine>
Guilty AS charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There is someone else controlling me

Who made you good to say
"I'll take your life from you!!"

        Flash before my eyes
        Now It's time to die
        Burning in my brain
        I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end

Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciencness is my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

        =-=CHORUS=-=

Someone helps me
Oh please god help me
They are trying to take it all away
I Don't want to die

Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see

How true is this?
Just get, it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed by this frighting dream

        =-=CHORUS=-=
        
FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton>
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless gray
On they fight, for they are right, yes, but whose to say?
For a hill men would kill why? they do not know
Stiffined wound test thier pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

        For whom the bell tolls
        Time marches on
        For whom the bell tolls

Take a look at the sky before you die
Its the last time he will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinding eyes to see

        For whom the bell tolls
        Time marches on
        For whom the bell tolls


FADE TO BLACK:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton, Hammitt>
Life it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more to me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, thats why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye


TRAPPED UNDER ICE:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
I Don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked up in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, i can't take anymore

        Freezing
        Can't move at all
        Screaming
        Can't hear my call
        I am dying to live
        Cry out
        I'm trapped under ice

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

        =-=>CHORUS<=-=

Scream, from my soul
Fate, mystified
Hell, forever more
No release from my chronic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, cannot break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

        =-=>CHORUS<=-=

escape:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true FALSE world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

        Out for my own, out to be free
        One with my mind, they just can't see
        No need to hear things that they say
        Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I Don't care now, cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

        -=-<CHORUS>-=-

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

        Life is for my own to live my own way

        (now repeat the whole thing again!!!)

CREEPING DEATH:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton, Hammett>
Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown on, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

        So let it be written
        So let it be done
        I'm sent here by the chosen one
        So let it be written
        So let it be done
        To kill the first born pharaoh son
        I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

I
Rule the midnight air the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I
Creep the steps and floor final darkness
Blood
Lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

        |/-\|CHORUS|/-\|
