Yo! Back with part II of our Metallica members close up! Let's get going wit
 the co-founder, and drummer LARS ULRICH!!


        As a co-founder, Lars is usually the one who talks to the media.
He's exteremely talkative 'n' can sometimes be intensely serious, but he can
also get as fucked up as the rest of the band. Born 'n' raised in Copenhagen
he tried a career at tennis just like his father until he moved to L.A. in
1980. When he realized that just about everyone there was not only into tennis
but was better than him, he quickly gave it up. Now he dove full tilt into
his other passion: muzak! Drummin' in particular. In '77 he got a drumkit
from his grandmother and started fantasizing that he was Deep Purple's Ian
Pace.
        When he first moved to L.A., hardly anyone had heard of Iron Maiden,
Saxon, Motorhead and other cool European bands. He searched for a guitarist
with his tastes and found one bad-assed James Hetfield, a guy who appriciated
the finer things in metal. Months later, METALLICA was born in a skanchy old
garage.

        QUOTES: "We are doing this first and foremost for ourselves. If we as
a band feel comfortable and good about it, that's enough. We haven't been
forced into doing anything...putting out something that we are not
completely satisfied with could never happen."
        ADVICE: "If we're trying to tell people anything, it's just do it
yourself, get your own shit together, cause that's what we've always tried to
do. Follow your instinct and and be a leader instead of a follower."

Pretty cool, huh? 'Ya hungry fer more? How about Jason Newstead, current
replacement of the late, great Cliff Burton?

        Jason is a real serious-lookin' dude in Metallica. In interviews, he
doesn't kid around much, with answers direct 'n' to the point. He looked like
the most dignified Metallican, until I saw his starrin' role in "amplified
body" noises "on their Justice show." Can't be in Metallica if you're not a
little crazy right?
        He got his first bass after being "corrupted" by KISS at age thirteen.
He fucked around with it for a while, then put it in his closet for 5 years.
When he heard Black Sabbath 'n' Rush at 18, he was again inspired and started
playin' bass seriously. He quit school to go with a band of older guys to
California. In Arizona they ran out of money, and all but Jason went home.
He stuck it out with dishwashin' jobs and eventually hooked up with drummer
Kelly Smith. Together they formed Flotsam and Jetsam. In the fall of '86 Cliff
Burton of Metallica was killed under a bus. He was recommended to Metallica
and was asked to audition wit them. Around 2 a.m. after talkin' with the rest
of the band, Lars casually asked, "You want a job?" Jason casually "screamed
at the top of his lungs in the middle of this restaraunt". After rehearsing a
couple of days Jason played his first gigs with Metallica: two surprise "warm
up " sets at L.A.'s Country Club. After that, they toured Japan and Europe                        "
        Cliff was a tough act to follow, but Jason did it with style!

        QUOTES: "You gotta play like you are never gonna play again.You just
gotta roar EVERYWHERE, whether the are 20 people or 20 million."
        ADVICE: "Success is being able to play what we want, and not having to
conform to anybody and still coming through over and over, still being
accepted. Being true to ourselves that's what it comes down to"
