Enter SANDMAN:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich, K. Hammet>

Say your prayers, little one.
DON't forget my son,
To include everyone.
I tuck you in,
Warm within,
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes.

        Sleep with one eye open,
        Gripping your pillow tight.
        Exit light
        Enter night
        Take my hand
        We're off to never never land.

Something's wrong, shut the light.
Heavy thoughts tonight,
And they aren't of Snow White.
Dreams of war, dreams of li'rs,
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite.

        Sleep with one eye open,
        Gripping your pillow tight.
        Exit light
        Enter night
        Take my hand
        We're off to never never land.

<now i lay me down to sleep>
Now i lay me down to sleep
<pray the lord my soul to keep>
Pray the lord my soul to keep
<if i die before i wake>
If I die before I wake
<pray the lord my soul to take>
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush little baby don't say a word
And nevermind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet in your head
       
        Exit light
        Enter night
        Grain of sand
        Exit light
        Enter night
        Take my hand
        We're off to never never land



SAD BUT TURE:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>

Hey, I'm your life. I'm the one who takes you there.
Hey, I'm your life. I'm the one who cares.
They, they betray. I'm your only true friend now.
They, they betray. I'm forever there.

        I'm your dream, make you real.
        I'm your eyes when you must steal.
        I'm your pain when you can't feel.
        Sad but true .
        I'm your dream, mind astray.
        I'm your eyes when your away.
        I'm your pain while you repay.
        You know it's sad but true.
        Sad but true.

You, you're my mask. Your my cover my shelter.
You, you're my mask. Your the one who's blamed.
Do, do my work. Do my dirty work, scape-goat.
Do, do my deeds. for you're the one who's shamed.

        I'm your dream, make you real.
        I'm your eyes when you must steal.
        I'm your pain when you can't feel.
        Sad but true.
        I'm your dream, mind astray.
        I'm your eyes when your away.
        I'm your pain while you repay.
        You know it's sad but true.
        Sad but true.

I'm your dream.
I'm your eyes.
I'm your pain.

I'm your dream.
I'm your eyes.
I'm your pain.
You know it's sad but true

Hate, I'm your hate.I'm your hate when you want love.
Pay, pay the price. Pay for nothing's fair.
Hey, I'm your life. I'm the one who took you there.
Hey, I'm your life. And I no longer care.

        I'm your dream, make you real.
        I'm your eyes when you must steal.
        I'm you pain when you can't feel.
        Sad but true
        I'm your truth, telling lies.
        I'm your reason, alibies.
        I'm inside, open your eyes.
        I'm you.
        Sad but true.

HOLIER THEN THOU:
<J. Hetfield, L Ulrich>

No more! The crap rolls out your mouth again.
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin.
Little whisperes circle around your head.
Why DON't you worry about yourself instead?

Who are you? Where ya'been? Where ya' from?
Gossip burning on the tip of your toungue.
You lie so much you believe youreself.
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself.

        Holier than thou,
        You are.
        Holier than thou,
        You are.
        You know not.

Before you judge me take a look at you.
Can't you find something better to do?
Point the finger slow to understand.
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand.

It's not who you are, it's who you know.
Other's lives in the basis of your own.
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth.
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself.

        Holier than thou,
        You are.
        Holier than thou,
        You are.
        You know not.

Yeah! Who the hell are you?

        Holier than thou,
        You are.
        Holier than thou,
        You are.
        You know not.

Whoa not!


THE UNFORGIVEN:
<J. Heltfield, L. Ulrich, K. Hammet>

New blood joins this earth,
And quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pain disgrace,
The young boy learns their rules.
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts,
The young man struggles on and on he's known.
Oooh a vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away.

        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown.
        Never be.
        Never see.
        Won't see what might have been.
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown.
        Never free.
        Never me.
        So I dub thee unforgiven.

They dedicate thier lives
To running all of his.
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is.
Throughout his life the same,
He's battled constantly.
This fight he cannot win.
A tired man they see no longer cares.
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully.
That old man here is me.

        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown.
        Never be.
        Never see.
        Won't see what might have been.
        What I've felt, what I've known
        Never shined through in what I've shown.
        Never free.
        Never me.
        So I dub thee unforgiven.
        
        You labeled me, I'll label you
        So I dub thee unforgiven

WHEREVER I MAY ROAM:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>

<and the road becomes my bride>
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride,
So in her I do confide,
And she keeps me satisfied.
Gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I crave,
Only knowledge will I save.
To the game you stay a slave.
Rover, wand'rer, nomad, vagabond,
Call me what you will.

        But I'll take my time anywhere,
        Free to speak my mind anywhere,
        And I'll redefine anywhere.
        Anywhere I roam,
        Where I lay my head is home, yeah!

<and the Earth becomes my throne>
And the Earth becomes my throne.
I adapt to the unknown.
Under wandering stars I've grown,
By myself but not alone.
I ask no one.
And my ties are severed clean,
The less I have, the more I gain.
Off the beaten path I reign.
Rover, wand'rer, nomad, vagabond.
Call me what you will.

        But I'll take my time anywhere,
        Free to speak my mind anywhere,
        And I'll nevermind anywhere.
        Anywhere I roam,
        Where I lay my head is home.
        
        But I'll take my time anywhere,
        I'm free to speak my mind.
        And I'll take my find anywhwere.
        Anywhwere I roam,
        Where I lay my head is home. That's where.
         
        But I'll take my time anywhere,
        I'm free to speak my mind anywhere,
        And I'll redefine anywhere
        Anywhere I roam,
        Where I lay my head is home.
        Carved upon my stone,
        My body lie but still I roam yeah, yeah.

Wherever I may roam...


DON'T TREAD ON ME:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>

DON't tread on me.
Say DON't tread on me.
Liberty or death,
What we so proudly hail.
Once you provoke her,
Rattling of her tail.
Never begins it,
Never but once engaged,
Never surrenders,
Showing the fangs of rage.
Say DON't tread on me.

        So be it,
        Threaten no more.
        To secure peace is
        To prepare for war.
        So be it,
        Settle the score.
        Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.
        DON't tread on me.

Love it or leave it,
She with the deadly bite.
Quick is the blue tongue,
Forked as the lightning strikes.
Shining with brightness,
Always on surveilance.
The eyes, they never close.
Emblem of vigillance.
Say DON't tread on me.

        So be it,
        Threaten no more.
        To secure peace is
        To prepare for war.
        So be it,
        Settle the score.
        Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.
        DON't tread on me.

        So be it,
        Threaten no more
        To secure peace is
        To prepaer for war.

Liberty or death,
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her,
Rattling of her tail.
        So be it,
        Threaten no more.
        To secure peace is
        To prpare for war.
        So be it,
        Settle the score.
        Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.

DON't tread on me.


THROUGH THE NEVER:
<J.Hetfield, L.Ulrich, K. Hammet>

All that is, was and will be.
Universe, much to big to see.
Time and space, never ending.
Disturbing thoughts, questtions pending.
Limitation of human understanding.
Too quick to cririsize.
Obligation to survive.
We hunger to be alive. Yeah.

        Twisting, turning, through the never.
        All that is,
        Ever,
        Ever was
        Will be ever .
        Twisting, turning through the never.

In the dark, see past our eyes,
Pursuit of truth, no matter where it lies.
Gazing up to the breeze on the heavens.
On a quest, meaning, reason.
Come to be, how it begun.
All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone.
On our home, third stone from the sun.  Yeah.

        Twisting, turning, through the never.
        All that is,
        Ever,
        Ever was
        Will be ever.
        Twising, turning, through the never.

On through the never. We must go
On through the never. Out to the
Edge of forever. We must go
On through the never. Then never comes.

        Twisting, turning, through the never.
        All that is,
        Ever,
        Ever was
        Will be ever.
        Twisting, turning,
        Who we are,
        Ask forever.
        Twisting, turning, through the never.
        Never.

NOTHING ELSE MATTERS:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart.
Forever trusting who we are.
And nothing else matters.

Never opened myself this way.
Life is ours, we live it our way.
All these words I don't just say.
And nothing else matters.

Trust I seek, and I find in you.
Ev'ry day for us something new.
Open mind for a diff'rent view.
And nothing else matters.

Never cared for what they do.
Never cared for what they know.
Oh, but I know.

So close, no mattter how far.
Couldn't be much more from the heart.
Forever trusting who we are.
And nothing else matters.

Never cared for what they do.
Never cared for what they know.
Oh, but I know.

I never opened myself this way.
Life is ours, we live it our way.
All these words I don't just say.
And nothing else matters.

Trust I seek and I find in you.
Ev'ry day for us something new.
Open mind for a diff'rent view.
And nothing else matters.

Never cared for what they say.
Never cared for games they play.
Never cared for what they do.
Never cared for what they know.
Oh, and I know. Yeah, yeah.

So close, no matter how far.
Couldn't be much more from the heart.
Forever trusting who we are.
No, nothing else matters.


OF WOLF AND MAN:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich, K. Hammet>

Off through the new day's mist I run.
Out from the new daay's mist I have come.
I hunt. Therefore I am.
Harvest the land.
Taking of the fallen lamb.

Off through the new day's mist I run.
Out from the new day's mist I have come.
We shift. Pulsing with the earth.
Company we keep, roaming the land while you sleep.

        Oh, shape shift
        Nose to the wind.
        Shape shift
        Feeling I've been
        Move swift
        All senses clean.
        Earth's gift
        <back to the meaning>
        Back to the meaning of
        Life.

Bright is the moon, high in starlight.
Chill in the air, cold as steel tonight.
We shift, call of the wild.
Fear in your eyes.
It's later than you realized.

        Oh, shape shift
        Nose to the wind.
        Shape shift
        Feeling I've been
        Move swift
        All senses clean.
        Earth's gift
        <back to the meaning>
        Back to the meaning of
        Life.

<I feel a change>
<Back to a better day>
Shape shift
<The hair stands on the back of my neck.>
Shape shift
<In the wildness is the preservation of the world.>
<so seek the wolf in thyself.>

        Shape shift,
        Nose to the wind.
        Shape shift,
        Feeling I've ever been
        Move swift
        All senses clean.
        <Back to the meaning>
        Back to the meaning
        Of wolf and man.  Yeah.



THE GOD THAT FAILED:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>

Pride you took, pride you feel,
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel.
Not the word, not the love,
Not what you thought from above.

It feeds, it grows,
It clouds all that you will know.
Deceit, decieve,
Decide just what you believe.

        I see faith in your eyes.
        Never you hear the dicouraging lies.
        I hear faith in your cries.
        Broken is the promise. Betrayal.
        The healing hand held back by the deepened nail.
        Follow the god that failed.

Find your peace, find your say,
Find the smooth road on your way.
Trust you gave, a child to save,
Left you cold and him in grave.

It feeds, it grows,
It clouds all that you will know.
Deceit, decieve,
Decide just what you belive.

        I see faith in your eyes.
        Never you hear the discouraging lies.
        I hear faith in your cries.
        Broken is the promise. Betrayal.
        The healing hand held back by the deepened nail.
        Follow the god that failed.

        I see faith on your eyes.
        Broken is the promise. Betrayal.
        The healing hand held back by the deepend nail.
        Follow thw god that failed.

Pride you took, pride you feel.
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel.

Broken is the promise. Betrayal. Betrayal. Yeah.


MY FRIEND OF MISERY:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich, J. Newstead>

You just stood there screaming,
Fearing no one was listening to you.
They say the empty can rattles the most.
The sound of your own voice must soothe you.
Hearing only what you wanna hear.
And knowing only what you heard.
You. You're smothered in tragedy,
And your out to save the world.

        Misery.
        You insist that the weight of the world
        Should be on your shoulers.
        Misery.
        There's much more to life than what you see,
        My friend of misery.

You still stood there screaming,
No one caring about these words you tell.
My friend, before your voice is gone,
One MAN's fun is another's hell.
These times are sent to try men's souls.
But Something's wrong with all you see.
You. You'll take it on all yourself.
Remember, misery loves company.

        Misery.
        You insist that the weight of the world
        Should be on your shoulders.
        Misery.
        There's much more to life than what you see,
        My friend of misery.

        Misery.
        You insist that the weight of the world
        Should be on your shoulders.
        Misery.
        There's much more to life than what you see,
        My friend of misery.

You just stood there screaming.
My fiebd of misery. Yeah. Yeah, yo.


THE STRUGGLE WITHIN:
<J. Hetfield, L. Ulrich>

Reaching out for sommething you've gotta feel.
You're clutching to what you thought was real.
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you.
No way of showing your grattitude.
So many things you don't wanna do.
What is it, what have you got to lose?
What the hell?
What is it you think your gonna find?
Hypocrite.
Boredom sets into the boring mind.

        Struggle WITHIN
        It suits you fine.
        Struggle within.
        Your ruin.
        Struggle within.
        you seal your own coffin.
        Struggle within.
        The struggling within.

Home is not a home, it becomes a hell.
Turning it into a prison cell.
Advantages are taken, not handed out.
While you struggle inside your hell.
Reaching out.
Grabbing for something you've got to feel.
Closing in.
The pressure upon you is so unreal.

        Struggle within.
        It suits you fine.
        Struggle within.
        Your ruin.
        Struggle within.
        You seal your own coffin.
        Struggle within.
        Struggling within.

Reaching out for something you've got to feel.
While clutching to what you had thought was real.
What the hell?
What is it you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite.
Boredom sets into the boring mind.

        Struggle within.
        It suits you fine.
        Struggle within.
        Your ruin.
        Struggle within.
        You seal your own coffin.
        Struggle within.
        Struggling within.
