               by E. James Scott


          Hermes' Song

Divine morning
The breeze blows softly
The sun glances off Olympus.
A heavenly radiance enfolds the city.
Mortals sleep, and the gods themselves doze.

The watchman yawns
The seagulls hover
The ripples of the ocean flash golden.
A heavenly radiance enfolds the city.
Mortals wake and sacrifice to the gods
If prayers are heard, we are safe.


          Cassandra's Lament

Apollo, Apollo
Your golden arrows pierce my heart.
Apollo, Apollo, Apollo
O God of the Way and my destroyer.
Apollo, Apollo
You've brought me to the house of doom.
Apollo, Apollo, Apollo
I die your faithless love and humble slave.

            LIFE IS A GAME OF INCHES

                by Alan Vanneman


     I figure it's like boots. I never go anywhere without my boots.
Without my boots I'm  nothing. I'm five eleven. What's that? That's
nothing. With my boots I'm six one. I  fucking dominate. When I walk
into a bar, heads turn. They fucking turn. I'm a good- looking guy. I
know that. But without my boots I don't stand out. People see me, they 
smile, and that's it. But with my boots it's Hey! Who's this guy! They
want to fucking  know me. They feel they ought to fucking know me.
Chicks will fucking take my arm,  like, this is the one I want. This is the
guy to have. I have my fucking pick. But I've done  that, you know
what I'm fucking saying? I've done the bars. I'm not a kid any more. I'm 
ready for more. I'm ready for the big time. Which is why I'm fucking
going for it. Real estate is like everything else in LA. You've got to
have a fucking edge. My boots  give me an edge. I see those guys at
five nine and I laugh. What kind of a fucking life is  that? So if I'm a six
one guy, why do I have a five nine crotch? So that's why I'm going  for
it. I need the whole package.
     Now, this is not an implant. That is crap, like they're going to
cut open your dick and  stick in some plastic? That is so much crap.
What this is is a penis extension. Every guy,  or at least just about every
guy, has a bigger dick than he knows, because part of your  dick is
inside you. It's like you have about two inches of dick inside you, and I
figure I  have at least that, like I could have three inches. Could I use
three more inches on my  dick? I think I could!
I mean, I think I have a regular dick, like I have about six inches, which
is a regular  dick. Can you imagine what it would be like to have a
nine-inch dick? Nine inches! Can  you imagine what it would be like to
go into a sales meeting with a nine-inch pecker in  your pants? Can you
fucking imagine? I see all kinds of couples when I'm out showing 
houses, and I know what half those chicks are thinking. Yeah, they call
me, they want to  see that little house one more time. And I ball them.
Oh yeah. Sure. Which is cool. But I  want more than that. Because LA
is about image and attitude. Attitude creates image, and  image creates
attitude. And if you have a nine-inch dick, you become a different
person.  You become a fucking different person entirely. Because, I
mean, chicks talk. You ball a  chick with a nine-inch dick. and the word
is going to get out. You ball a chick with a  nine-inch dick, and she's
going to remember it for the rest of her life. Which is why I think I'm
going to go for it. Of course, it costs bucks, which is one  thing. And
you've got to get the right doctor. You can definitely get screwed if you
don't  get the right doctor. I heard about this guy who worked on Bruce
Willis, and I figure  that's the guy I need to get. I figure, if he's good
enough for Demi Moore, he's good  enough for me, right? Because that
fucking chick is fantastic. I need a good commission for this, a good
forty-five grand. That's the figure I need,  because this is a serious
operation. I mean, it's cool, it's totally cool, but it's serious,
because what they do is they cut around your dick, not in your dick, but
around your dick,  and the part of your dick that's inside you slides out,
so all of a sudden you've got two or  three inches you didn't have before.
It's pretty fucking simple, when you think about it. I  know having a guy
cut around your penis doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but I figure, this 
is science. They know what they're doing. They got lasers and shit. I
know there was this article in Buzz about these guys who got screwed
over, like they  were impotent and crap. So what is that? These are
guys who are assholes, who don't  know their way around town.
Because if you don't know your way around town, you will  definitely
get screwed in LA. I mean, this town was built on screwing. There are
real estate agents in this town who will sell you shit, absolute shit, for
top dollar, if you don't  know your way around town, and I am one of
them. But I will also get you a fucking  dream house, that no one else
could fucking get, if you know your way around town. So what I need
is the Bruce Willis guy. This is the guy that I've got to get. Because I 
know there can be complications, like your dick could turn purple,
which I think could  turn off a chick. So I need at least forty-five grand.
     They also have this thing, which I'm not so sure about, where
they take fat from your  body and inject it into your dick, so it's thicker.
Is that good? I don't know. I don't know  if chicks are going to say
"hey, this guy has a thick dick." I don't know that. But I also  figure, if
you plough some chick, she may not think, "hey, this guy has a thick
dick," but  if the chick is totally ploughed, she'll remember that. I mean,
if you totally plough a  chick, you fucking own her. And maybe that
could happen, because you had a thick dick.  It could be an intangible,
something that counts even though you don't know it counts.  Like, I
once read this interview with Johnny Wadd in Penthouse and he said his
dick was  thicker than his wrist. Well, shit. Who wouldn't want to have
a dick like that? So maybe  having the injections would be worth it. I
mean, I'd have to check it out. Also I figure I need a Porsche. I know a
guy who can get me one. It would be  unregistered, but I could handle
that. I mean, it's about fucking time, right? The agency  gives me a
Bonneville, which is like shit, but really it's not a bad car. And, to be
frank, I  don't need a car to get chicks. It's not that. It's just that I'm
ready to take my life to  another fucking level entirely. Because there is
this chick at this fitness center I go to-if  you saw this chick you would
fucking die. In fact, I don't want you to see this chick. This  chick has
skin like you wouldn't believe. It's like satin. It's like dark honey. It's
like  coffee and cream. I think she's some kind of Asian chick, because
her hair is like black  silk. It is like fucking black silk. And she has the
world's biggest fucking eyes. I mean,  when Bambi saw this chick, he
committed fucking suicide. She has these big dark-brown  pupils, and
big eyes, and this fucking beautiful dark skin. This chick is so cool. I
mean,  you never have to guess about where she's looking. When Chris
looks at something out  of the corner of her eyes, it just about blows
you away.
     Also this chick doesn't have a face. She has faces. She has like
about three or four  different faces. When she smiles she has one face,
when she's straight she has another.  Because this chick has fucking
incredible lips. There is no other chick in the world with  lips like this.
They are so thick. I mean, they are fucking erotic. Her nose is kind of
like a  black chick's nose. She could almost be part black, except that
her skin is so creamy, and  she has that straight hair.
     Usually she wears this black unitard, and when you see her in
that you don't want to  see her in anything else. She has a fucking great
body. She thinks she's fat. I saw her with  this one chick, and they were
both wearing shorts, and Chris was talking about how she  had this fat
under her butt cheek that she hated. Well, Christ, you should have seen
that  chick's thighs. Her tits aren't that much. I saw her once wearing
this white leotard, which  she'd sweat through, and you could see her
nipples. She has these little brown sweet sexy  tits. And her ass is
fucking unbelievable. She thinks it's big, of course. I hear her telling 
the girls "I've got this big ass." Once she was in some kind of rehearsal,
and she was  wearing this high-cut leotard and this fucking shiny panty
hose, and when she bent over I  could see her fucking tan lines. I mean,
Christ, that gave me three inches right there. I had  to go in the john
and whack off. I could have gone through a steel door with that bone.
I've been seeing this chick for two years. I try to talk to her but she
won't let me. I  tried to tell her I could get her a job as a model-which
I fucking could. I could get this  chick a job in a day. I could do her
career. I don't even know what she fucking does. I saw  her first in this
aerobics class when I was working out, so I took the class. When I
started  coming on to her, she dropped the class, so I went back to the
weights. Then I saw her in  class again. I didn't want to spook her, so I
kept my distance. I've never seen her with a  guy. There are definitely
gay chicks in that place, but I've never seen her with one. So  she's
available. She's definitely fucking available. But this is no ordinary
chick. This is  not a chick you get with a Bonneville. This is not even a
chick you get with a fucking  Porsche. This is a very special chick. You
have got to be on top, absolutely on top of  everything, to have a
chance with this chick. You have got to be the guy that, when you 
walk into a room, and I mean any room, you are the party. Right now I
am a player. I am  a fucking player. But I am not a star. I am not the
party. Which is why I need the whole  package. I need the Porsche. I
need the dick. I need it all.

             VISITORS FROM AMERICA

               by William Ramsay
                                  
(Note: the is chapter 10 of the novel, "Ay, Chucho!"


       I stood waiting while Dominguez searched in a battered leather 
schoolbag.  The adobe hut was cramped and dark and furnished with
thin  mattresses with straw sticking out of the tears in the cloth.  I
hoped I would  never truly need a safe house, if this is what safe houses
were like in real  life.  Since my interview with Fidel and Pierre's
fiasco, I was fresh out of  ideas, stymied, and the cloak-and-dagger stuff
really seemed like a sour joke.        
       Dominguez, looking every inch a legit ragman in his beaten-up
straw hat,  scratched his scraggly gray beard with one hand as he
handed me the letter.  He  left his fingerprints on it in light brown
smudges.  The envelope had been  mailed from Miami to some address
in San Salvador.  I tore it open.  Dominguez  looked up over his copy
of the "New York Times," which I figured must have been  smuggled in
with the letter, and raised his eyebrows.  I turned my back to him  and
scanned the familiar loops and crotchets in the narrow lines of purple
ink. 

       Dear Chucho, 

       Darling.  I hope this finds you well and that the _work_ is 
progressing.  Your mother wormed out of Paco the news about what
you were  really doing.  She joins me in sending you love -- but
naturally she's  concerned, we all are.  I know what the difficulties you
face must be, but I  have every confidence in you.
       My brother says his friends are grumbling, but I'm sure things
never go  fast enough for people like _those_ _men_ -- don't let that
worry you.  Not in  itself.  You're the man on the spot, you know what
must be done and why.  But  do make an effort to report on your
situation there through _secure_ _channels_  -- I agree with Paco that it
would be in your best interests to keep everybody  informed.  And if
you think it's safe, drop a line to your concerned and  devoted "little
piggy-pie."

                                   Love
       
                                    Amelia

P.S.  Elena says, "Tell him we'll do anything to help -- anything at all." 

       "You can write an answer," said Dominguez, "it will go out
tomorrow.   And they said you'd have something else to send."  I added
a note to a letter  to her I'd already prepared and handed it to him with
the "report" I'd hastily  written the night before for Marcus -- in which I
said as little as possible.   What I needed now was a new idea on how
to get my father out, not a lot of  hassle from a bunch of spooks and
gangsters.  It was nice to have the offer of  help from Mama, and
Amelia's support -- but that didn't change anything in my  situation in
Havana.  She and my mother could worry about me -- but I didn't  see
any way they could help.
       I knew something new had to be done -- but I didn't know what.  I
had  contemplated changing my name once again, and starting over in
Brazil or  Venezuela.  Walking away the long afternoons along the
Malecon and looking out  onto the brilliant blue of the sea, I would
calculate how many weeks worth of  "expense money" I could squirrel
away before someone really got impatient.   Another three or four
weeks might get me a plane fare and a few thousand to get  by on for a
few weeks in Asuncion, or wherever -- but I wasn't looking forward  to
what would happen after that.
       Meanwhile, while I was having all these troubles trying to fantasize
my  way out of my situation, some of my new-found Party comrades in
the Ministry of  Health found ways to keep me busy.  I was asked to
"volunteer" to give talks at  the Hospital Infantil Pedro Borras Astorga
on 27th Street and in the Clinico  Camilo Cienfuegos in Matanzas, a
small  town on the coast east of Havana.  With  the help of a few books
on tropical diseases and some papers that I had picked  up at the
Ministry, I managed to plow my way through both of these talks.  
There were some bad moments: "Dr. Elizalde, I notice that the patterns
of  diseases you talk about in El Salvador are the same as those in
Cuba.  Is that  correct?"
       Well of course it was correct, since everything I knew about the
subject  I had learned from a paper entitled "Endemic Diseases in Rural
Areas of Cuba."        
        I scrunched up my mouth and nodded deliberately. "Yes, yes, the
pattern  is similar, very similar."
       "But the climate of El Salvador is quite different, isn't it,
   Doctor?"
        I continued looking thoughtful.  "Yes, yes, that's partly true..." 
But  then someone else in the audience piped up and said that diet and
working  conditions were the important factors, not climate.  I nodded
even more  rapidly.  I could feel moisture on my brow.  "True, very
true," I said.  I  looked at my watch, raised my eyebrows appealingly at
the chairman.  Thank God,  he got up and thanked me for my "most
enlightening talk."  I wiped my brow --  it wasn't easy being someone
else.
       One of the bureaucrats in Agriculture had asked me to stop by on
the way  back from Matanzas and give a talk on the "Role of
Revolutionary Education in  Rural Areas" at the ESBEC, or rural
secondary school, Politecnico Salvador  Allende in the little town of
Campo Florido not far from  Havana.  Why not?  I  knew about as
much about that as I did about medicine.
       The audience was different at Allende, however.  Instead of
doctors and  medical students, it was high school students in their light
blue sports shirts  and dark blue scarves and shorts.  Some of them
looked terminally bored, like  students everywhere.  I did all right
faking the talk itself, but I slipped  into some trouble at the beginning of
the question period, when I had to  improvise a lot about what the hell
"revolutionary education" really was.  Then  a tall thin student stood up
and asked a question about computers.  I grabbed  for the topic like a
life preserver.  I gave a rundown on the latest in  desktops, laptops,
network systems, anything I could think of.  One of the  teachers
protested that computers wouldn't be available in rural areas.  
Someone else rose and said that it was a scandal, that more computers
were  needed.  Again I nodded, and I snatched the topic away and
wound up the  discussion with everything under control.  Afterward,
the tall student  buttonholed me.  He asked me questions about the
latest computers, the newest  types of chips, topics that took me a little
far afield from what I knew.  He  smiled and looked at me intently.  His
face was cadaverous but handsome, with  long eyelashes and dark eyes
above the sunken cheeks.  He walked along with me  and the teacher
acting as my escort, as we headed toward the waiting Ministry  car.  He
told me that  computer systems were his passion, but that they had 
almost no equipment or references at the Politecnico.  
       "The Lenin School," suggested the teacher -- "You should be
there,  Eddy."  
       The student pursed his lips.  "You're right, profesor, I should be --
by  rights.  But what rights are there in this country now?"          The
teacher looked shocked.  He smiled uneasily, muttered a good-bye,  and
walked off.  The student introduced himself -- Eddy Paniagua.  He was 
almost sixteen.  He said that he dreamed about going to the Lenin
School, the  elite technical academy outside Havana, where secondary
education included both  class work and practical production work on
calculators and TV sets.         
       "Why don't you transfer?" I said.  
       "It isn't that easy."  His face fell.  "My grades are good enough. 
But  my father isn't enough of a bigshot, he's just a foreman at an
avocado ranch  here.  He's not interested in politics -- he doesn't have
_pull_."  His mouth  turned down.  "Pull -- that's what the 'Revolution'
has come to."        
       "Tough," I said.
       "But maybe you can help me."  He stared down at me.          
       "If I can."
       He smiled slightly.  "Can you help me get some references,
anything I  can read on computers?" 
       I thought a minute.  I liked the kid.  Maybe sometime I would run
into  something at one of the Ministries.  Maybe even the big bookstore
opposite the  Havana Libre or the other one near the Floridita would
have books other than  Russian propaganda and unreadable
"revolutionary fiction."            "I don't know, but give me your address
and I'll be in touch."        
       He wrote something in his notebook, left-handed, leaning his tall
body  over and then tearing out the page.  I told him I was staying at
the  Presidente.
        I was tired when I arrived back at the hotel in Havana.  As I fell 
asleep, I thought, maybe Amelia could find a book for the kid in Miami
and send  it along.  Let the C.I.A. do a good deed for a change.
       The next thing I knew, the phone rang.  The alarm clock read 2:15. 
I  heard my mother's voice.  Oh-oh, I thought, as I usually do when I
hear from  her unexpectedly, what now?
       "Chucho, _amorcito_.  How are you?"
       "Fine, fine.  How are things in Miami?  Is something wrong?" I
said,  thinking of the hour.
       "No, but I'm very, very tired.  I'm too tired right now, I have to 
rest."
       "Too tired for what?" I said, not making any sense out of it.        
        "We'll get together tomorrow.  I'm in room two twelve.'        
        "Two twelve?  Here?"
        There was a long yawn and then a sigh.  "I don't believe this seedy 
hotel -- it used to be a showplace.  Our poor country.  And that flight,
like a  cattle car, in the middle of the night."  She gave another yawn,
this time a  more ladylike one.  I could picture her putting her tiny fist
to her mouth.        
       I asked her why she was here, feeling the minute I'd said it that I 
wasn't being a very gracious son.  _Mamacita_ was big on graciousness
-- at  least in other people.
       "If I weren't so tired, I would try to come up with a merry little
laugh  or two, _hijito_."  She yawned again.  "We need some sleep. 
Good night."        
        She hung up before I had time to wonder: who was 'we'?"  I lay
back down, but I could feel in my backbone my mother's presence, 
taking her nap, snoring in that well-bred way of hers, somewhere
probably not  more than a hundred yards away from me.  I tried
counting sheep, but that's  never worked for me.  All I could think was
what Mother -- and it must have  been Amelia, the other part of the
"we" --- were up to in Havana.  As I turned  over again one more time,
trying to get my arm into a comfortable position, it  seemed to want to
get in the way of the rest of my body.  I thought I'd left  Miami behind
-- now it was following me.  If my mother was here -- who next?   Mr.
Holbrook?  The IRS?  One of Mr. Gomez' men?
       I did fall asleep again, because a noise in my dream about being
beaten  with a squash racquet for being a bad boy resolved itself into
someone  scratching, then lightly knocking on the door.  The sound
stopped.  Then it  started again, scratching harder.  With the light on,
the numbers on the clock  had made it as far as the numerals 4:50.  I
heard a voice, grumbling  something.  English or Spanish?
       I went over to the door and bent over to listen.  The scratching 
stopped.  "Who is it?"  I found myself whispering in rhythm with the
gentle  waves of scratching.  There was stillness, and then a rooster
waked somewhere  outside and let out a full crow.  
       "_Jesus_!" I heard from behind the door.  I couldn't tell whether
the  interjection was a call for me by name, but I did recognize the
voice.  I  turned the safety lock and opened the door.  Uncle Paco was
wearing a beige  jacket and carrying an American Airlines bag.  He was
frowning.        
       "Quick, I thought I heard a noise," he said, pushing me inside,
turning  back for a second to peer both ways down the hall, then doing
a rapid tiptoe  in, pulling the door behind him very quietly.  
       "Everywhere," he said.
       "What?" I said, just realizing that the other part of "we" was not 
Amelia.
       He shook his head and sat down, folding his jacket carefully under
his  hips and slicking back his long black strands of hair to cover up a
patch of  balding pate.  He  smiled and pointed to the bag.  "Got 'em
through," he said,  as if he had just passed "Go" and collected $200.
       I had waked up, but my eyelids still felt draggy.  What was
happening to  my life?  I remembered the mirror scene in "Duck Soup"
-- nothing was what it  seemed.  "La Vida es Sueno" -- "Life is a
Dream," as Mr. Fernandez had lovingly  emphasized to us, telling us the
story of that famous Spanish play when I was  in the first grade.
       I didn't ask what was in the bag, I figured he was going to tell me
and  I wasn't quite sure I wanted to know.
       "Is there anyone else here?" he said, half-rising, his eyes staring
 at the bathroom door.  He made a face, satisfied, and sat back down. 
Then he  leaned over and peered under the bed.
       "Raul Castro may be hiding in the closet behind my trenchcoat," I
said.  "Take a look."
       "Got to be careful, Chucho."  He dragged out several
plastic-wrapped  packets of what looked like modeling clay and then a
box marked "Handle with  Care."  "Got to be prepared too," he said. 
He opened the box and shook out  several little rectangular pieces of
metal with pigtailed ends.             Plastic explosives and detonators.
I felt I had joined the Intifadeh or  the I.R.A.  "Oh, shit, Paco.  What
are you going to do with that little cache --  and how did you get it
through Security and Customs?"
       "Some friends," he said, "'The Men' have friends everywhere." 
"The Men"  were dissatisfied with my progress, he said, and when my
mother had decided to  come to Cuba, they had sent Paco along with
explosives and detonators and  orders to set up a jail break.  He must
have seen something on my face, because  he suddenly said, "Automatic
weapons too, Chucho -- they're coming."   He  leered.  "Help from the
Company.  Don't worry."
       Jesus!  Why was I supposed to "not worry" about automatic
weapons.  And  explosives  -- in the hands of a _bobo_ like Paco.  The
fact that he was openly  talking about C.I.A. involvement made it
worse, if anything.  I asked him if  _mamacita_ knew about all this
materiel.  He winked and shook his head.  "Don't  want her to know
too much.  Amelia always says a gentleman -- he used the word 
_caballero_ -- shouldn't endanger a lady."  The expression on his face
was  solemn.  I saw my mother through his eyes as a finishing-school
product, a  rosary bead-teller.  I pictured an old-fashioned duenna in
black lace with a  mantilla.
       Just then there was a knock on the door.  Paco hurriedly scraped
the  little packets and the pigtailed rectangles and the boxes into the
bag.  I went  to the door.  My mother's muffled voice said, "What are
you idiots up to in  there?"  Resplendent in a pink peignoir that was
fitfully covered by the narrow  folds of a black kimono, she first
frowned, then evidently deciding on a  "family first" policy, she said,
"Chuchito, _mi_ _amor_!" and gave me a firm,   businesslike _abrazo_. 
I tried to hug her back but was impeded by the rigidity  in her arm
muscles, which embraced but did not caress.
       I don't know why that always surprises me -- but it does.  Amelia
always  has reasons for why my mother is as she is but I always forget
what they are.   I suppose it has something to do with being our only
parent for all these  years, but maybe more with her being an Olivera --
of the Olivera Pescaderia,  S.A., which had a stranglehold on the spiny
lobster and scallops concessions in  Cuban waters under Batista.  And
with being related to the Bourbon kings of  Spain way back, and having
spent the first years of the Revolution in the safe  _americano_ haven of
Mt. Vernon School in Washington.  Anyway, she was the only  Mom I
had, and she was now in Havana, where she could only be trouble.        
       "What are you doing here, Mama?"
       She smiled.  "What a greeting."  She yanked on my arms and
shook her  head in mock dismay.  "Sharper than a serpent's tooth."  She
glanced down,  making a face as she straightened out the ruffles on her
nightgown.        
       Paco frowned.  "They didn't like your reports, Chucho."        
       I reminded him to call me "Felipe."
       My mother looked at me sternly.  "And the letter to Amelia said
so little.  We've all been worried."
       "Mr. Gomez..." Paco started to say.  
        My mother shushed him with a wave  of her hand:  "We thought
you might need some help -- so we're here!"  She  giggled, as if we
were starting out together on a Hawaiian vacation.        
        I tried telling her about the situation in Cuba, about my alias,
about  the danger.  "Pooh," she said.
       "The risks must be run, Chucho," said Uncle Paco.
       I thought about the explosives and my mother's ignorance of that
aspect  of the trip.
       "We're here perfectly legitimately," said my mother, "as members
of the  'Cuban community' visiting relatives -- there's my cousin Marta
and my niece  Mary.  You can keep on working as this 'Felipe' character
-- I'll see what I  can do on my own."  She made a face.  She took out a
pillbox, grasped a pinch  of coke, and sniffed it up her nose.  "'Felipe
Elizalde'!  What a name!"        
     "We'll see what we can do," said Paco.
       Now what was _I_ going to do?  The cruelty of my position was
that my  status was so phony that I couldn't assert any rights at all --
and certainly  not any right of making my mother and Paco buzz off
back to Miami and get the  hell out of my hair.
       Paco handed me two little bottles.  "What are these?" I said, and
then,  reading the labels saw that one was Dalmane for sleeping and the
other was  Valium.  Paco nodded.  "Amelia thought you might be able
to use these.  Also  brought along some toilet paper."  (Toilet paper
was a  scarce item, like so  many quasi-essential consumer goods in
Castroland.)
       I did use the pills -- both kinds, and I slept like a log.  Late
the next morning, I stood a long time looking out across the Avenida de
los Presidentes, watching runners jog along the track by the Malecon, with
the  light mist over the sea wispy along the water's edge.  As I felt the
warmth of  the sun rise up from the concrete below, I began to look on
the brighter side  of things.  Maybe it wouldn't hurt to have my mother
there -- she wouldn't be  able to do anything, I thought, but she couldn't
do any harm -- as long as she  didn't blow my cover.  I thought I had
made my mother understand that if they  didn't try to be extremely 
circumspect about contacting me, if she kept  calling calling me
"_amorcito_" on the phone, the secret police would soon have  her
"little love" in jail -- and probably herself too.   "_Ay_ _tonterias_,"
she said in reply.  "I would never tell a soul about the 'Felipe' business.
I'm not a dodo, you know."
       Naturally I also needed to think of some way to keep Uncle Paco
from  playing dangerous games with his homemade bombs.  As I lay on
the beach that  afternoon, watching a group of red-backed Russians
playing volleyball, and  deciding whether to try some mango juice as an
antidote to orange soda and  sugar cane juice -- I missed my diet cola --
I felt the sudden crazy temptation  to allow "Mommy" (and  "Uncle"
Paco) take care of me, get me out of my  difficulties.  "Crazy" is right.
       Mama was sure full of business.  I told her about my experience
with  MININT, and I hinted about Pierre's contretemps.  She nodded
knowingly when I  described the interview with my father -- "Just like
Fedy," she said, and took  a sideways look at Paco, who was watching
a soccer game on TV and fiddling with  one of the heavy-linked gold
chains she was always giving him.        
       She wasn't impressed by my story about Fidel.  "I knew his wife's 
people, the Diaz-Balarts, a good family.  He married out of his class." 
(As if  that had anything to do with anything -- you'd think she was
considering  inviting Fidel to a cotillion.)  She said, "I'll take it up
with the courts, I  used to know quite a few judges."
       "Don't let them catch you sniffing coke," I said.
       "Nonsense!  What a fuss you make about that."
       Well, she soon found out that there wasn't any judicial system in
Cuba  anymore, there were courts, "People's Courts," "Special Courts,"
and so on, --  but no _system_.  The judges were all non-professionals,
there were no rules of  evidence.  Undeterred, from there she attacked
MININT, but unlike me, she went  to the Minister himself, who it
turned out was a distant cousin.  But she came  back from the interview
with a grim face.  We were sitting on the terrace of  the President,
looking toward downtown, with the Habana Libre -- formerly the 
Hilton and still called that by many --  and the other highrises in the
Vedado  area standing like jagged teeth in the near distance.  Paco was
sipping a  _mojito_, the national rum drink, I was making do with a
beer, Mama was downing  her daiquiri as if she had just come in from
the desert.
       "You know, Chu..."  -- she caught herself "Felipe, there's one
power  that they can't suppress here."
       "What's that?" I said.
       "The power of the press."
       "But they control the press."
       "They don't control the American press," she said, "not 'El
Herald,'"  she said, referring to the Spanish edition of the Miami
newspaper.          
     "He doesn't care what the _gusanos_ say," I said.          
     She smiled.  "We have to make him care this time, don't we
Paco?"        
     Paco was staring at a long-haired blonde in a very short dress. 
"What?"  he said.  He stared at us and then smiled, "Sure Elenita, sure,
you're right as  always."
       "But first I have to see Fedy," she said, reaching over, taking
Paco's  hand, and squeezing it tightly until he made a face.
       My mother went, as I had, out to La Cabana to see Father.  As she 
described her visit, she gave him a piece of her mind.  She was allowed
to see  him alone, or almost alone, with a guard at the far end of the
room and no  chicken wire in between.  The guard even left them alone
for  a few minutes --  a partial "conjugal visit."  She told him that he
looked terrible, that he  wasn't taking care of himself.  She said he
started to raise his head in a  familiar gesture of defiance, then stopped
and stared down at her as if she  were a rare insect.  At that, she said,
her throat caught, and she had to  suppress a sob.  His eyes also looked
misty, and he took her hand.          
       Her: Fedy, this can't go on.
       Him: It can't be helped, Elenita.
       Her: Come back to us, back to the family.
       (At this point in her narrative, she stopped suddenly.  I was
imagining  that she wondered what she was going to do about Paco and
her other male  friends if our "family" were reunited.  But then she
sniffed and began again:)        
       Him: Nothing can be done.  Fidel...
       Her: Don't even mention that name.  _Him_!
       (Even many _habaneros_ were now calling their Maximum Leader
"_El_," or  "He," so Mama was right in style.)
       Mamacita made a face as she said this, and I wondered then if she
was  thinking about taking on Fidel himself.
       Him: He still respects me.
       ("Well," she said, "I didn't even try to argue with him about that,
I know it's craziness."  She made a cuckoo sign with her hands and
continued her  story:)
       Her: Your son needs you, he's in trouble.
       Him: Oh.
       Her: Yes, your son needs you.
       (At that point she described to him some of my "financial
problems" in --  "you know, a way he would understand."  Or perhaps
deliberately _not_  understand, I thought.  Good old Mama.)
       Him: I'm sorry.
       Her: Don't be sorry.  (Then, whispering:) Just be ready!        
       Him: You don't understand.
       Her (whispering loudly):  JUST BE READY!
       "So there!" she said, finishing her story.  But I was wondering,
"ready"  for what?  And I pictured my father just sitting there
stubbornly, waiting  impatiently for the Marxist millennium to turn up. 
Waiting with dignity in his  jail cell for his old pal Fidel to see the
light.
       We were in her room at the Presidente.  Through the window a
block of  darkness lay between us and the lights of the Rampa and
downtown.  Probably  another power outage -- I imagined I could hear
the sound of the hotel's  emergency diesel generators.
       "I have not yet begun to fight," said my mother in Spanish, echoing
Juan  Pablo Jones.
       "Leave it to me and Chucho," said Paco.
       She went to the window, her short, plump body casting a dark
shadow on  the glass.  "Castro!"  She snorted.  "_Canalla_."  She
turned around, looking  as if she were about to spit.  "I'm just beginning
to enjoy this," she said.   "I'll tell him.  He can't do this to a good
American family!"        
     She spoke with vigor.  I caught myself irrationally wondering
whom to  feel sorry for: her -- or Fidel.

               MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT

(Part 1 of "Julie," a play based on "Miss Julie" by August Strindberg, a
new version by Otho Eskin)

CHARACTERS:

          MISS JULIE     White, early thirties, the only daughter of
                         a "patrician" family in the deep south

          RANSOM    African-American, late twenties.  The family
                    chauffeur.

          CORA      African-American, early twenties.  The family cook.

PLACE:

The kitchen of a large, once-elegant home somewhere in the Deep
South. One door leads to the kitchen garden.  Another door leads to
Cora's bedroom.

TIME:

Sometime during the 1930's.  It is Saturday night    Midsummer's
Night (June 23).  At Rise  the sky, seen through the doors, is still
light.  As the play progresses the sky will darken, then lighten again
with morning.



                    SCENE 1


AT RISE:  Somewhere in the distance can be heard the sound of a
trumpet playing a jazz tune. The trumpet fades.  CORA stands at the
stove, cooking. 

                               (CORA sings to herself.)

                      CORA
 Some glad morning when this life is over, I'll fly away
                                                                                To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away.        

                              (Ransom enters, carrying a
                              trumpet.  HE wears a
                              chauffeur's uniform.)

                      CORA
The Judge gone?

                     RANSOM
I put him on the four o'clock train for Memphis.

                      CORA
That was hours since.

                     RANSOM
I sat in at the dance  Maybe you heard me playin? (He listens to the
music for a moment.) You mad 'bout missin' that dance?

                              (RANSOM carefully wipes his
                              trumpet with a cloth.)

                      CORA
Me? Not for a little thing like that.

                      RANSOM
You a sensible girl, Cora.  You gone make a mighty fine wife.
(RANSOM puts his arms around CORA's waist.) Everbody there
tonight.  You should go, Cora.  You have some fun.

                      CORA
What 'bout the old man?

                     RANSOM
He won't be back to tomorrow mornin'. We got plenty of time.

                      CORA
               (Shakes her head)
I be up since dawn at the cook-stove, makin' breakfast, makin' lunch,
gittin' dinner ready.  Now you want some supper, I 'spect.  I ain't been
off my feet for more'n five minutes.  An' tomorrow I gotta git up real
early.  It's Sunday, 'member, an' we gotta go to church.

                     RANSOM
It's only once a year, Cora.  It's Midsummer night.  Forget 'bout church
this once.  It's gone down heavy over there. Jus' listen.

                              (THEY listen to the distant
                              music.)

                      CORA
You gone dance with me?

                     RANSOM
Of course.  I promise. You my girl.

                      CORA
Maybe later, Ransom.  Maybe later.

                              (RANSOM puts his trumpet
                              away.)

                     RANSOM
That woman crazy.  I swear to God, she plumb crazy.
                        
                      CORA
What you talkin 'bout, Ransom?  Who crazy?

                     RANSOM
Miss Julie! I swear, that women be genuine crazy.  You shoulda seen
the way she acted. Everone was laughin' at her.  She didn' pay no mind. 
What's wrong with her, you reckon?

                      CORA
I know her since she was a baby chile an' I ain't never been able to
make her out right. 'Course, anyone raised in this house bound to be
strange.


                     RANSOM
When she come in I was playin' an' she spot me an' rush up an' just up
an' ax me to dance with her.

                      CORA
             (Turning to the stove)
She got no more sense than a flea.  Course' she always be a sometimey
girl but it got worse ever since the fire.

                     RANSOM
Why didn't Miss Julie go with the Judge to Memphis 'stead of stayin'
here by herself with nobody 'round but the house servants?  That not
natural. 

                      CORA
Maybe she 'barrassed to be with her kin what with her 'gagement broke
off an' all.

                     RANSOM
Her young man seemed like a nice person   for whitey.  Always
treated me right. Even when he was liquored up.

                      CORA
It's not our place to talk personal 'bout the Judge an' he family...

                     RANSOM
Know what I saw, Cora?  The two of them.  With my own eyes.

                      Cora
You spyin' on them?  You shouldn' spy on yore betters. You gotta
show respect.

                     RANSOM
I was workin' on the LaSalle when I seen them two down by the lilac
bushes at the corner of the garden. Miss Julie was doin' what she called
"trainin'" him.  Know what she was doin'?

                              (CORA, despite herself, is
                              listening with interest.  SHE
                              shakes her head.)

                     RANSOM
She was makin' him jump over her ridin'-crop   like when you train a
dog.  He done it twice.  An' each time she hit him hard with the crop.  

                      CORA
You tellin' a bald-faced lie, Ransom!

                     RANSOM
Gospel truth! The third time she tole' him to jump, he done up an'
grabbed the crop an' broke it in two an' walked away.  They 'nounced
the engagement was broke off a week later.  But I knowed it was all
over when I seen them two by the lilac bush.

                              (CORA turns back to the stove
                              and puts food onto a dish.)

                      CORA
This used to be a fine place.  A fine, 'spectable family.  Never been the
same since the fire. I know it's not our place to judge but...

                              (CORA brings the dish to the
                              table.  RANSOM sits and begins
                              to eat.)

                     RANSOM
Sugar, I need somethin' to drink.  

                              (CORA goes to the refrigerator
                              and takes out a bottle of
                              buttermilk.)

                    RANSOM 
Not buttermilk, girl.  This Midsummer's Night.  Fetch me a beer.

                      CORA
You think that right, Ransom? Suppose somebody see?

                     RANSOM
Who gone see? 

                              (CORA gets a bottle of beer
                              from the refrigerator.  She opens
                              it and places it on the table.)

                     RANSOM
                  (Continued)
What 'bout a glass?  We no field niggers.  We know how to drink outta'
a glass.

                              (CORA laughs and brings a
                              glass.)

                      CORA
Where you get this here beer, Ransom?

                              (RANSOM begins to eat and
                              drink heartily.)

                      CORA
                  (Continued)
You done stole it from the Judge's cellar. Lord help the woman who
gits you for a husband!

                     RANSOM
You be lucky to get someone as good lookin' an' smart as me, girl.

                              (CORA runs her fingers through
                              RANSOM's hair.  HE pushes her
                              hand away.)

                     RANSOM
Stop that!  You know I don' like that.

                      CORA
It's only love.

                              (RANSOM returns to eating. 
                              CORA begins to prepare
                              something on the stove.)

                      CORA
                  (Continued)
You the most conceited man I ever did meet in my entire life.  An' that
includes my Pa, my three brothers and'the Dornan twins.

                              (RANSOM pushes away the
                              plate and gives a satisfied sigh.)

                      CORA
Whose fool idea was it to hold a dance tonight?

                     RANSOM
Me an' some of the boys...

                      CORA
You know the Judge wouldn' 'llow that kind of music on his place.

                     RANSOM
Well, the Judge ain't here, is he?

                      CORA
Somebody might report to the sheriff.

                     RANSOM
I don' worry none 'bout the sheriff.  If you wan' somebody to worry
'bout, worry 'bout the night riders.

                      CORA
They ain't been no night riders in these parts for years.

                     RANSOM
I bin hearin' things, Cora.  But don' you worry. I kin take care a'
myself.

                      CORA
What you talkin' about, Ransom?

                              (RANSOM walks to a dresser,
                              opens it and takes out an old
                              revolver from under a pile of
                              clean shirts. CORA stares in
                              shock.)

                     RANSOM
Any those crackers tries to come here an' make trouble, they gonna find
it, sure.

                      CORA
I cain't hardly believe you talkin' like that, Ransom. Where'd you git
that gun?

                     RANSOM
My daddy found it years ago out back in the bushes behind the big
house. Give it to me 'case I needed some protectin'.

                      CORA
You put that gun away!  I don' like guns.

                     RANSOM
I'm jus' tellin' you, you got nothin' to fear from Mr. Charley.

                      CORA
I got plenty to fear from you, Ransom!  You gone kill somebody with
that thing. You don' know a damn thing 'bout guns.  You git rid of it,
hear!
                              (RANSOM puts the gun away.)

                     RANSOM
Don' worry, sugar, I don' aim to make no trouble 'less trouble come
lookin' for me.

                              (Disgustedly, CORA goes to the
                              stove and begins to make a
                              concoction in a large pot.)

                     RANSOM
What that you makin' over there, Cora?

                      CORA
Somethin' for Miss Julie's bird.

                     RANSOM
How come you gotta cook for some bird on a holiday? The bird sick or
somethin'?

                      CORA
That what she say. I promised I'd make a special medicine my mama
taught me.  It'll cure a bird a' any sickness. You know how particular
Miss Julie be 'bout that bird a' hers.
                        
                     RANSOM
I say Miss Julie be altogether too particular about a lot a' things.
(RANSOM goes to the refrigerator and takes out another beer.)  An'
then, sometimes, she not particular enough to my way of thinkin'.

                      CORA
I reckon she favors her mama there.  

                     RANSOM
Was the Judge's wife crazy as they say?

                      CORA
She had her ways.  She'd spend all her time here in the kitchen or out in
the old stables. But when she went to town she insist the LaSalle it be
polished so bright it hurt you' eyes to look at.  She git her skirts all
filthy out there in the garden or the fields but she wore her good jewels
all the time.  'Course, after the fire she took poorly. At the end, the
old lady she crazy as a betsey bug. 

                     RANSOM
Our Miss Julie, she got no respect for herself or for her position neither.
Like jus' now, in the barn, dancin' with the field hands.  That's not right. 
We wouldn' do somethin' like that.  That's what happens when white
folks try an' ack common.  They become common. But I gotta say...

                              (CORA turns and regards
                              RANSOM.)

                      CORA
What you gotta say, Ransom?

                     RANSOM
She's a damn sightly woman...

                      CORA
I don' like talk like that.  Talk like that mean nothin' but trouble.

                              (MISS JULIE enters through the
                              garden doorway. 

                      CORA
Why, good evenin', Miss Julie.
