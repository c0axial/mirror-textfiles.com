On the day last week when the telecommunications bill was passed in the
Senate, NPR played a tape of Senator Exon on the Senate floor including a
prayer by a Senate chaplin.

       "Almighty God, Lord of all life, we praise You for the
     advancements in computerized communications that we enjoy in
     our time. Sadly, however, there are those who are littering
     this information superhighway with obscene, indecent, and
     destructive pornography. Virtual but virtueless reality is
     projected in the most twisted, sick misuse of sexuality.
     Violent people with sexual pathology are able to stalk and
     harass the innocent. Cyber solicitation of teenagers reveals
     the dark side of online victimization.
       Lord, we are profoundly concerned about the impact of this
     on our children. We have learned from careful study how
     children can become addicted to pornography at an early age.
     Their understanding and appreciation of Your gift of
     sexuality can be denigrated and eventually debilitated.
     Pornography disallowed in print and the mail is now readily
     available to young children who learn how to use the
     computer.
       Oh God, help us care for our children. Give us wisdom to
     create regulations that will protect the innocent. In times
     past, You have used the Senate to deal with problems of air
     and water pollution, and the misuse of our natural resources.
     Lord, give us courage to balance our reverence for freedom of
     speech with responsibility for what is said and depicted.
       Now, guide the Senators when they consider ways of
     controlling the pollution of computer communications and how
     to preserve one of our greatest resources: The minds of our
     children and the future and moral strength of our Nation.
     Amen.
