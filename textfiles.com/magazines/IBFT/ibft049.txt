This is something I wrote when I was a freshman who had not yet realized
how wonderful having a full time job was going to be!  Now I don't bother
myself with silly things like awareness.  I pass the time away counting
my money, drinking, and masturbating.

My HTML project is going to be directed around "Hate".  Hate.  Seems pretty
broad?  Pretty easy to dismiss in one sentence such as "he's probably a
white supremacist" or "some uneducated hick".  Sadly I have more hope for
the human race than most of the school does, so your blanket dismissal
holds no water.  Hate is better than what you people practice, that being
indifference. 
 
What I mean by hate is anything pretentious, false, or contrived that is
presented as genuine or captivating.  Oh, and I hate stupidity, which gives
me a lot of fodder considering I go to Northeastern University.  With my
HTML project, I will do my best to enlighten you on how big of a lie your
life really is.  Since *my* ideologies are the only correct ones, you can
either agree to them, or continue living the life of a listless, passive
mental masturbator; the choice is yours. 
 
You think you know everything?  You're an adult now, have gone through the
ravages of puberty and are on your way to being a powerless pseudo
intellectual white collar slave.  Sometimes you wonder what could have been
if you had chased your dreams, but then the old guilt comes back and you
go back to the drudgery of your everyday existence.  You see the people
you graduated with on television and pretend not to be bitter as you yell
at your wife to get you another beer.  You're pathetic. 
 
The truth is that guilt you feel was instilled in you only to keep you in
line.   Nobody cares about you.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, lies to
you.  You have been weaned on television, and your mind, covered in blood
and sexual fluids from the number of times its been raped by the idiot
box, has turned numb and powerless to the things and people oppressing it. 
What kind of manipulation must take place so that when you see hundreds of
people dying on television, their carcasses, limbs, and skulls flowing in
a river of blood..   What kind of manipulation would make you not think
twice as you change the channel to see Erkel stick his head in his rear
end.  More importantly, what kind of sick and twisted mindrape would make
you *laugh* at Erkel?  The world is a sad place. 
 
You don't know anything.  You don't know what life is about.  You don't
know the beauty of it.  You've forgotten, because life moves slowly, and
your attention span is in single digits.  You don't know what death is! 
You've seen it so many times, know the technicalities and situations
inside out, but you don't know what a tragedy it is for a human life to be
wiped off the face off this putrid planet.  You don't even know the value
of life anymore, and that's just how the master plan is supposed to work
out. 
 
The concept of America is beautiful, but the corruption that has gradually
taken root here has turned it into an embarrassing wasteland.  Swallowing
the sugar coated media bites, its hard to realize that there are people in
power in this country that would make Adolf Hitler proud.  Our country's
only interest in others is economical.  Material based conflicts are
almost always interpreted as ethnic ones, located in countries the average
viewer could care less about, though he keeps close tabs on who's winning 
Bud Bowl XVII. If no one cares, who is going to stop the oppressors? 
 
Do you even know what Communism is?  This country seems to have this hate
for Communists calling them 'reds' and 'pinkos' and equating the danger of
Communism with leprosy.  But no one can really say what Communists are
except for the fact they are 'bad'.  Does this sound right to you? 
 
When is the last time you picked up a book?  A book you weren't forced to
read?  When is the last time you felt uncomfortable with something
everyone else was agreeing with?  When is the last time you suffered?  The
last time you were angry at something of substance, something that
mattered?  Your soap opera lives are so meaningless it amazes me.  Your
heros are manufactured.  Why stifle oppression when you can package it and
sell it at Marshalls?  Calvin Klein has a new perfume called 'One'.  It is
supposed to bring out the individuality in you.  It comes in a bottle. 
Tell me, is there something wrong with that? 
 
Does it bother you that people get pregnant as an afterthought?  That
since your landlord cannot shut off electricity in MA if you have an
infant, people have children to keep their utilities?  Does *this* bother
you at all?  Does it bother you that the gift of life doesn't mean
anything anymore, and more and more children are being raised improperly
unprepared to deal with an unforgiving world?  Probably not, since most of
you come from a white, suburban family and have no understanding of
poverty.  Poverty for you is not getting that Gameboy for Christmas.  Do
you know how goddamn hard it is to build a raft?!  God you piss me off. 
 
Turn off your TV!  Its rotting your brain.  There is more to life than
Doom!  There is hell to raise, lies to expose, and hibernating minds to
awake and enlighten.  They are obviously doing a damn good job of keeping
you from the library, but you must fight back.  Reading opens up the
synapses shut down from years of dekay.
