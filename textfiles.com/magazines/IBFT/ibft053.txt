Hello,
 
I have no idea if you'll be flattered or annoyed by this short note so
take it as you will.  I recently came across issue #22 ("Stupid Townie
Fucks"), written by your partner Snarfblat.  That's got to be the best
piece of writing I've ever seen circulated through these boards.  I
printed out several copies and gave them to friends.  Okay, well, I
know that was random and seeing the venom you've spewed before I'll
probably get flamed for it.  Whatever.  Keep up the cool Zine.

ok, well let's begin with an intro... i got IBFT # something from a 
friend and decided to check out some of your other stuff.  Pretty good.  
Now since I'm assuming you don't want someone fawning all over you saying 
"you guys are great, i love you, if you were a girl i'd fuck the hell out 
of you, etc..." and all that other fan club shit I'll give it to you 
straight.

Like I said before I read something like 38 issues of IBFT last night and 
was impressed.  And since you said that you wanted to know if anyone 
could relate, I'll tell you that you're not alone.  But since my best 
friend doesn't really know the extent of my pain, I'm not going to blab 
it to you.  Basically she tore out my heart and then gave me the "polite" 
but still very cold shoulder.  Anyways enough about me.

I read at the bottom of one of the files that you have a subscription, so 
sign me up.  That's about all.  Keep it going.  and if you ever find 
yourself short of quotations just ask... i've been keeping a file of 
quotes for the last 6 years that about sums up my entire life (kind of 
sad actually).  If you want it just ask.

This message is from Random Tox on the Eleventh Hour BBS:

Because he read and loved IBFT, a fucked up 14 year old wanna-be neo-nazi 
skinhead is calling my BBS long distance from Minnesota. 

His New User message ended with "Any skins here?"

I told him that because potato skins contain the most vitamins, I had 
probably eaten all of them, but I would check anyway.

He is an interesting boy.

Gee, thanks.  Please pull the fire alarm.

I'm the other guy.  In fact, I'm probably more punk than the woman I live 
with who claims to be punk.  Believe me, I hate the "new" punk of today.  
There are plenty of people who think they are punk that don't know what 
the hell that means.  My female roomate included.  Her husband on the 
other hand, who does not claim to be punk, is probably legitimately 
punk.

I also assure you, I am not a G-rated twat licking cunt. (although I am 
pretty good at eating pussy, if you must know).   The fact that we are 
drug free and against the frat-boy mentality does not make us G-rated PC 
rainbow whatever.  In fact, I hate the whole PC movement.  Having respect 
for alternative lifestyles (we have 2 active bi-sexuals living here) does 
not mean we are part of todays PC.

I am the 27 year old.  My band is very into doing what we do because we 
love it.  We have been doing it for almost 4 years, and we are pretty 
much hated in the valley.  We have turned down offers from record 
companies because they sucked, and we have accepted others because they 
were potentially lucrative and allow us to do our thing.  We want to make 
music for a living.  We don't necesarrily want to be rock stars, but we 
do not condemn the music industry, and we aren't about fucking the man 
(although I do tend to fuck the man on a day to day level).  Our CD has 
gotten some great reviews.  Even from reputable trade papers, but despite 
that, no one wants to touch it.  We could become the next modern rock 
band tomorrow, but we aren't into selling out in that way.  We write the 
music that we like.

Look, if you want to hate me, go ahead.  If you want to find out that I 
am a person with a brain, and a lot more going on for myself than your 
e-mail gives me credit for, than that's fine too.

I didn't agree with everyting in the roommate wanted post, but that's 
what living with other people can be about sometimes: compromise.  I 
don't care enough about telling my female roomate that she is the epitomy 
of poser.  I need to live here 'till the end of may, finish my degree, 
and then try to make a living playing music.

BTW - the part of today's punk movement that I do respect is the DIY 
thing.  I know some kids out there who are really in it for the right 
reasons, doing the right things, and don't use punk-rock as a fashion 
statement.

I've also been in a band when the fire alarm was pulled.  It makes for 
good stories.

without wax,
rob

PS - if you have any interest in checking out the band, our web page is:
http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~bdic/Falafel_Boy.html

and if you'd like, I'll put you on the guestlist if we actually play in 
the area during the semester.  Then you can decide to pull the fire alarm 
based on the music at least.
