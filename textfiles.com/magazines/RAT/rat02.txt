Ode to a Hacker.
-----------------

I'm a hacker and I'm Ok.
I phreak all night and sleep all day.

I break into Overseas Bank-Accounts.
Money money money in lots of amounts.

I've got a modem, it does 19k.
A Credit Card so I dont pay.

I've got an ego that fills the room.
I log onto Zen and call myself a hoon.

I'm an Elite, thats who I am.
Though I'm still wondering if I'm a man.

I'm in The Realm and feelin' fine.
Soon I'll be in jail doing time.

John Elliot's accounts I've got access to.
I wish I stayed at school to understand a few.

My face is acne, my gut is full of flem.
Pizza is the only food at 3am.

I've got a girl she's so neat.
I met her at a Zen meet.

Last night I called United States.
Spoke to a guy whose got no mates. (either)

I'm a hacker and I'm Ok.
I phreak all night and sleep all day.

                                          Anon.

Zen. I would say its a religion, and be heralded by a lot of misunderstood
monks, so I won't. I hate monks.
