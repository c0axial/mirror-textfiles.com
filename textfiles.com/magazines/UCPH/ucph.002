 I would like to classify three type of people that Phreaks run into:
1. Those who don't know what happened.(The Telco.)
2. Those who won't know what happened. (The Police,Feds..Etc..)
3. The people like us that make things happen..(Phreaks,Hackers..Etc..)

 In this dimension I AM the Presentor,and the Inventor,And the Tormentor.
Let's talk about hearts.. The hearts of men,who knows what evil lerks
within them..But lets take a travel down the blind side the side known as
"Stranded on Death Row", a place of rotting Phreaks,Phreaks that have no where 
to go.. They can't repent. They can't stay where they are.. They must journey 
to the next level..Just the sacrafices of they're tribe. A tribe that know's no
borders. A Tribe that knows no limits of knowledge,knows all races,knows all.

 Recognize the lyrics? Well I changed them around to fit.. But I think it
adds some grace to the Phreaks of the world. Were not geeks,nerds.. We ARE
the rulers of CyberSpace and the communication systems of the world. We
can concieve infinit possibilitys. After all,when you can travel thousands of
miles in a matter of seconds it sort of goes to your head. When you play games
with the Secret Service,the FBI and the Telco Security you learn alot about the
world.. It's all one big game really.. And in the end we all lose.. Death's a
destiny,we all have it, thats why there is so many Phreaks on Death Row..

 I know thats pretty weird.. But if you think about it,how many of you
really aren't sure you'll get away? Are you sure you haven't already been 
caught? Well lets see what the real story is supposed to be...

 "This...is a story about cops,and wild teenage whiz kids,and lawyers,hairy
eyed Anarchists,and industrial technicians,and hippies,and high tech 
millionaires,and game hobbyists,and computer security experts,and Secret
Service Agents.and grifters,and Thieves..
  
  This is about the electronic frontier of the 1990s. It concerns activities
that take place inside computers and over telephone lines.."

-Bruce Sterling The Hacker Crackdown.

  In the past three years,federal agents have come down like a ton of
hardware on the computer sub-culture. Some trace the crack-down to the
notorious King Day Crash,When AT&T lost all nation wide long distance
service on Martin Luther King Day 1990,and blamed it on Phreaks. To
which they swear they did nothing. Since then feds have confiscated 
thousands of dollars worth of equipment,searched homes,searched homes of
hackers' freinds and families,and pressed vague charges of corporate-
-propery and privacy violations that the cops themselves barely seem to
understand.
  Imagine the surreal social resonance of watching big southern cops
harrasing a bunch of flannel wearing poindexters clutching floppy disks
as if they were beeper wearing home boys blasting "Dre Day" too loudly.

  Apple computer was founded,in part, on the technology connected with
the infamous "Blue Box". Multi-Million dollar software companies like lotus
were also founded in part by self proclaimed hackers. In which the most
vital computer securitys found it's base.

  People like us ARE NOT the heels of the computer society. WE INVENTED IT!
And keep it going today, we built the demand for PC's. We are the ones who
spend hours at a time on the PC's. But the government itslef will NEVER admit
it. Because they want to control the information,all in part because 
information is power,not guns,not missles..(Although they are cool.) If you
will notice the media, thier one sided stories. They portray us as sedious
people. But they themselves are the criminals. The information will forever
be out there. And it is up to US to keep it free! So anyone can take part and
not have to freak out when the doorbell rings or get worried when your line
clicks too much.. If you do your part and we do ours.. We will succeed..
Join U.C.P.H., and do your part.
