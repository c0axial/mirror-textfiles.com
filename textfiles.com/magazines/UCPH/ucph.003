	Hello, my name is Aliester Crowley.  That of course is not my real 
name as it would be quite foolish for me to reveal my true identity at this
time.  My hobbies have taken me through a series of events that would 
eventually lead to my arrest.  My hobbies have included:  Blowing up small
animals, Trying to start my own political party, Almost burning down quite
a large forest, and of course Hacking and Phreaking.  I have encountered 
"Big Brother" many times in different forms.  In this issue I would like
to talk to you about UNIX.  Boy, do I hate UNIX.  But seeing as how UNIX is 
what runs many businesses I feel the need to talk about it.  Here goes 
nothing.........

	UNIX is case sensitive.  Therefore when you attempt illegal access
to a UNIX system you should experiment.  Try checking out the company's 
garbage bin for a clue of usernames and\or passwords.  In my extensive 
travelling through CyberSpace and UNIX I have found that you usually have
only 3 or 4 times to enter the correct username and password.  If you get 
one wrong (either the username or password) UNIX will not inform you which 
one is wrong!  Bummer!  You have to figure the gaining access part out for
yourself!  Anyways, once you are inside you should type "cat/etc/passwd".  
This handy command will show a list of usernames and their encrypted 
passwords!  I have a list of common usernames and passwords below.


	USERNAME                PASSWORD
	--------                --------
	
	root                    ???
	daemon                  ???
	adm                     admin, sysadm, sysadmin, operator
	uucp                    ???
	bin                     ???
	sys                     ???
	adduser                 ???
	admin                   see (adm) above
	anon                    anonymous
	asg                     device, devadmin
	bbx                     ???
	cbm                     ???
	csr                     support
	demo                    demo, guest, tour, visitor
	friend                  friend, guest, demo, tour, visitor
	guest                   see (friend, and demo) above
	help                    help
	ls                      ???
	maint                   sysmaint, service
	manager                 mgr, man, sysmgr, sysman, operator
	net                     network
	netmgr                  net, man, manager, mgr, netmgr, network
	operator                sysop, oper, operator, manager
	priv                    private
	service                 service, field, support
	super                   supervisor, manager, operator
	support                 see (service)
	sysadm                  adm, admin, operator, manager
	sysinfo                 info
	sysmaint                maint, service
	sysman                  manager, mgr, man, admin, operator, sysadmin
	sysmgr                  see (sysman)
	tour                    see (friend, guest, and demo)
	tty                     ???
	tutor                   tutor
	unix                    unix
	usr                     user
	uuhost                  uucp, host
	uunx                    uucp
	vashell                 ???
	visitor                 see (friend, guest, and demo)
	who                     ???
	
	Well, that's the list.  There are many other important things about
UNIX that you still need to learn, though!  The ROOT account - It is the 
most important account you need to know.  That might be why I could not 
figure out some root passwords!  Remember the Disclaimer, Kids!
