    This is for all of you who live in a crouded residential area where
  the MTUs (Main Telephone Units) are in the back yard or on the poles.

    Now to get what I am saying picture this.. I'll get real explicit on 
  how the phone gets from the exchange station to your home. Now,your line
  isn't ran strait from the exchange to your home(Not one line) it stops in
  several places and gets switched to another line. In some areas possibly 
  a LORAIN system. Now I am sure most of you know this.. But there might be
  a few who don't..Ok,now after it goes through all of it's stuff it will
  be coming in off a pole.. Then into the MTU where it is then switched to
  the wires that run underground to your NIU on the side of your house.
  (NIU is short for 'Network Interface Unit'")Then it runs into your home.

   Now then for this part you'll need to build or buy or steal a handset.. 
  Best way is to build one. I already have one but I don't think you people
  are as crazy as me..Now,handsets are almost the same thing as regular 
  phones,but they have meters and lights to tell you if you have the lines
  reversed. So, our objective is to build a handy portable phone,that hooks
  up by way of clips. So,look around your home,try and find a TOUCH TONE
  telephone,NO PULSE DIALS! TAKES TOOO MUCH TIME! And you need tone for some
  telco features. Now,if you have a phone that turns on by the hand set that
  is perfect but if you must you could use a 2 piece or just one that has a
  hang up button(usually has a plastic rest that has a pice sticking up that
  catches the hang up button,or pushes it in.)Now take a good look at the
  phone,notice where everything is,is it sturdy? Does it have any special
  features that require another power supply? No? Well then lets take that
  puppy apart! Find the screws and Take the covers off,don't get impatient
  during this part,do it carfully,lay the parts in a safe place. Now where
  the cord runs in,it will come to a wafer board,and solder on  this is our
  place of interest. Get a soldering gun.(If you don't have one go to the
  local Radio Shack or Wal-Mart and buy on and some solder)Warm up your gun
  and De-Solder the wires from the board,make sure you can tell which one
  is the ring and which one is the tip. RED IS THE RING,AND GREEN IS THE TIP.
   
   Now find two seperate colored copper wires around 3 1/2' in length. 
  Solder the wires to the spot where you took the others off. And make
  a place on the case for the larger wires to come out of the bottom.
  After you have done that,check your connections. After that,put the
  telephone back together. Now go the the ends of your wires and put some
  clips on them,the best are fully insulated ones found at Radio Shack 
  Put them on there and make sure they are strong. Now your hand set is ready
  I know it sounds like alot,but it shouldn't take more than an hour to 
  build. 
    
   Ok to demonstrate how this will work I am going to make a diagram. CRUDE.

            |  <O>  <O>  |   Now the <O> are posts with nuts on them,the
            |  <O>  <O>  |  telephone wires run to them,in most areas there
            |  <O>  <O>  |  2 posts per house so the boxes are common in 
            |  <O>  <O>  |  residential areas. Now this part is really really
            |  <O>  <O>  |  easy,if you can't do it,quit now. You clip your 
            |  <O>  <O>  |  phone to a post . like this:
            |  <O>  <O>  |
            |  <O>  <O>  |          <O>  <O>
            |  <O>  <O>  |          \/    \/
            |  <O>  <O>  |          |     |
            |  <O>  <O>  |          \      \
            |            |            \      \
            |         {  |             YOUR PHONE!
            --------------

    Make sure you don't get your clips touching other posts and if the people
   are on the phone goto the next. Don't fuck with them. You'll be back to
   use them later,find a dial tone dial your home # if it rings it isn't your
   post,try the next, if you don't find one thats busy you go to the next
   closest MTU by your home,now in some areas there is a number Identification
   in the 918 SWBT area it is 891-222-2222 but if your in another area you'll
   have to con an OP or a Telco guy.Once you find your post mark it or remeber
   it,only mark with a scratch, or a number (Like 3 if your the 3rd post down)
   Now all you need is a pair of pliars. Undo your wires going to your posts.
   And find some one elses hook thiers up to your post. Leave thiers undone.
   And go in,call your buddies in Germany,call all the LD BBSs ya wanna and
   hack till your hearts content. Then around 5:30am just before everbody 
   starts getting up for work run out and hook them back up the way they were.

    Now if you can't find your MTU it must be on the pole. Now all the same
    rules apply to pole MTU's except for thier obviouseness.. Hanging in the
    air.. Now if your crazy enough to climb the pole go for it,and here are
    your directions:

      The poles MTU is laid in sideways like so:

    Now, I know this is crude but I'll try to describe it more it is silver
    and most likly you'll see the black wire running from your house to it.

    NOW DO NOT MISTAKE IT FOR THE POWER LINE! IT IS **SMALLER** AND 
    ABSOLUTLEY **I MEAN IT** MAKE SURE IT IS RUNNING TO THE NIU! MAKE
    SURE!! 

    You'll run across it.. Then follow the MTU directions.. And most
    of all do it when people are sleeping. And think of a good excuse
    to be out,like walk the dog or something ok? And above all HAVE FUN!
    and remember the Electric Gypsy has proved these methods to be safe..
    and fun.. Like hook up to the posts,to where you can run away fast and
    call 911. Say something like "HELP! THERE IS SOMEONE IN MY HOUSE!" 
    then hang up. Make sure to disguise your voice.. Then it's cool.. And
    you can see who owns the lines on the posts.. hahaha
