 I would like to classify three type of people that Phreaks run into:
1. Those who don't know what happened.(The Telco.)
2. Those who won't know what happened. (The Police,Feds..Etc..)
3. The people like us that make things happen..(Phreaks,Hackers..Etc..)

 "This...is a story about cops,and wild teenage whiz kids,and lawyers,hairy
eyed Anarchists,and industrial technicians,and hippies,and high tech 
millionaires,and game hobbyists,and computer security experts,and Secret
Service Agents,and grifters,and Thieves..
  
  This is about the electronic frontier of the 1990s. It concerns activities
that take place inside computers and over telephone lines.."

-Bruce Sterling The Hacker Crackdown.

  In the past three years,federal agents have come down like a ton of
hardware on the computer sub-culture. Some trace the crack-down to the
notorious King Day Crash,When AT&T lost all nation wide long distance
service on Martin Luther King Day 1990,and blamed it on Phreaks. To
which they swear they did nothing. Since then feds have confiscated 
thousands of dollars worth of equipment,searched homes,searched homes of
hackers' freinds and families,and pressed vague charges of corporate-
-propery and privacy violations that the cops themselves barely seem to
understand.
  Imagine the surreal social resonance of watching big southern cops
harrasing a bunch of flannel wearing poindexters clutching floppy disks
as if they were beeper wearing home boys blasting "Dre Day" too loudly.

  Apple computer was founded,in part, on the technology connected with
the infamous "Blue Box". Multi-Million dollar software companies like lotus
were also founded in part by self proclaimed hackers. In which the most
vital computer securitys found it's base.

  People like us ARE NOT the heels of the computer society. WE INVENTED IT!
And keep it going today, we built the demand for PC's. We are the ones who
spend hours at a time on the PC's. But the government itslef will NEVER admit
it. Because they want to control the information,all in part because 
information is power,not guns,not missles..(Although they are cool.) If you
will notice the media, thier one sided stories. They portray us as sedious
people. But they themselves are the criminals. The information will forever
be out there. And it is up to US to keep it free! So anyone can take part and
not have to freak out when the doorbell rings or get worried when your line
clicks too much.. If you do your part and we do ours.. We will succeed..
Join U.C.P.H., and do your part.

UCPH mag. #2 

  Now that we have a fairly odd start. We can begin our journey.. If you wish
to become a member or have a artical you wish to submit,or wish to become a
editor(Which we REALLY need. ) Or wish to become a distribution site,please
contact us. You can print a letter and send it to:

  P.O. Box 364 Catoosa,Ok 74015 USA
 
 Or you could call any of the bbs's named in the end here and leave a message
to the Electric Gypsy . 
Thanks for participating.

   Please understand that for now information is short.. So in turn the 
magazine will be short.. But as soon we will be big.. Not too mention 
some of the spelling will be messed up.. We are not proffesional writers
or journolists...

Game Start.

This game starts in the Kansas City Metro Area, where Sprint WHQ and AT&T
corporate head quaters are. This Phreak is starting low on the pole. At a
place in this city known as AmTech Security Systems.. A dealer of the AT&T
home protection system. It isn't a glamorous start, but it'll have to do. 
Besides it is a very good place to learn Social Engineering skills. After
all telemarketing is a very tough job. You have to keep control of the 
conversation,but I have pro's teaching me. And I am getting good at sounding
like an AT&T operator. Now back to the story, I am up here because the 'work'
in the old home town was getting a wee bit slow. A phreak just can't sit 
still ya know..:) But soon Amtek got too slow and the information there ran
out.. So I transfured to a place called Vector Marketing, which I am learning
to become a good sales person, thats a VERY useful tool in Phreaking and 
hacking. You need to learn to control conversations, and how to get people 
to do what you want. After all, intellegence is power. And you begin to feel
more comfortable over the telephone. Not too mention it a good way to get 
your grimy little paws on corporate information! Which in itself is REALLY
valuable! Infor on mainframe #'s,and accounts on it! Really.. It's all there
and no one expects you to be a Phreak! But always remember not to get caught
after all that is INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE!! 
 Anyway you look at it is a big crime. A felony,which for me I don't have to
worry about.. I'm not 18! ha! :)

  I am working my way up though,in 2 days I am going to an interview at a
special place.. It's called AT&T. Now you are familiar with AT&T correct?
Well soon I'll be playing thier toon.. So you never can tell where a Phreak
is can you? There could be one on your line right now.. Ever get a call in 
middle of the night? Call it back,and it's a Phreak? Or been scanning and been
called back? And it's a phreak? Well they're out there.. And you never will
know.. When you fucking with the operator.. After all it might be me! hah..
Give ya a hint? Thats why you develope your own way to shit the ops! And then
we end up back at the job skip.. You understand? Your probably saying to 
yourself.."What in the hell?" Think about it ok? Remember just as easy as it
is for a any person you meet to be a phreak, it is EASIER for them to be a
Fed, think about this stat: 1 thats ONE out of every 3 THATS THREE!! people
ypu meet in Phreaking is a FED!! (Thats not literal) SO BE CAREFUL! Watch
how many numbers you scan, and NEVER I MEAN NEVER PHREAK FROM HOME! 
Just to clear that up.. I've met many Phreaks that have done that.. And thier
line always was clicking.. Hheh.. 

Now lets progress into more depth in some fields.. Computer Security.
For a brief period in recent history if you wanted to make a Data preccessing
security manager turn green all you had to do was mention the area code
for Milwakee,Wisconsin.
 That area code provided the name for the Milwakee based group of hackers
known as the 414 group. They gained national attention by hacking into
over 60 different computer systems.. Including Hospitals,Government 
agencies. They spawned television shows like "Whiz Kids" and "Riptide" whose
heroes perform unrealistic feats of hacking.
  
 Most of all they made even the most level headed guys paranoid. It became
so bad.. It seemed as though every line had a hacker on it.. 
That spawned a computer security awareness..Not after too long a special  
study by the federal Office of Technological Assessment (OTA) recently found
14 major areas of law and regulation that effect computer information systems
that are effected by them. The OTA list includes the individual right to
privacy,freedom of information, First amendment rights, the fourteenth 
amendment,the right to due process of law,and communication regulation with
particular emphasis on the AT&T break-up.
 Areas where the sytems are vulnurable to misuse include computer crime;
patents, trademarks,and copyright infringement; the use of computer generated 
evidence in court;liability laws;antitrust law;taxation;information available
from the government;and goverment purchases of information systems...As
extensive as this list is the OTA has definatly missed others..

You'll have to find out which ones are good for yourself.
There are many nice mainframes in here..
All scanned by: E.G. 
Over 15,000 numbersw have been scanned so far.. 
Some of these might be VMB systems..Where they just
happend to hit the right pitch for my modem to let onto.
They are all NOT at 300 I just scan at that speed.. It saves time.
