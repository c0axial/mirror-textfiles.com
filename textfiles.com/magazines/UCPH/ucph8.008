   Little green boxes,you know those boxes on the side of the road with 
   your local telephone companys logo on it. Now,these boxes are more
   important than people might think. They are the routers of the lines
   they hold the lines that come up from underground and hold the ringing
   generators. Now there are many types of boxes,the most significant boxes
   are the LORAIN ringing generators,they are by far the most expensive.
   They hold the fieber optic ducts,which are ran in underground by the
   local company. They are there because optics cannot carry electricity,
   or more importantly the standard lines.(electric) They recieve the light
   pulses and convert them into electrivcal signals which are then sent to 
   your home. They are like one big computer,has several 'cards' in it,which
   holds about 100homes per card(As my information supplies). There is around
   200volts DC power at 125amps. So there is enough to kill you if you are
   not careful. To find these boxes just drive around,you'll find them in 
   sort of a small cement drive-way with a fence around it,but one side is 
   open,sometimes you'll find small cement poles around it. There is generaly
   2 or 3 other boxes by it. One box is called a cabinet,it looks like a 
   small double doored refrigerator,and when opened has many,many lines
   which are plugged into small connectors,this is the pairs comming out
   of the trunk connected to the output of the LORAIN generater. Then you
   have your power conduit. Don't mess with it,it is brown and has a red 
   light on it and has many warnings. Leave it. The next is usually a MTU
   for the local houses. If they are within 1 block of the generater,now
   we all know what the MTU does..(U.C.P.H. #4 'Phreakin' While you sleepin')

      Now in the Cabinet the is usually a spool of wire. This wire is very
   very helpful,there is usualy 400 feet of wire which comes in very handy
   when Phreakin while people sleepin'. When you do this alot,you can obtain
   a fairly large amount of wire(I myself have around 6000 feet of wire.. Yes
   over a mile.) which can make 'beige' boxing a great thing to do. You can
   string in as many lines as you want,double them and give the operaters 
   hell. The next thing is dis-assembling the LORAIN generater to down the
   people who have the phones connected to it. It makes great revenge people
   usually don't have a phone for 11 or 12 hrs. And the phone company pays 
   out the ass for it. Now there is one thing that is of utmost importance
   when dealing with lorain ringing gernaters, THEY HAVE ALARMS! They have
   silent door alarms. It isn't a great huge emergency the first time one
   is opened and the police won't come and arrest you. But the phone company
   knows as soon as you open the doors that it has been opened. So make it
   quick,and always do this really late at night. Now,the best way to down it
   is to just pull the power supplys out,they are on either the left or right
   side of the generater like so:

     When downing the generaters you must move fast,because after the generater
     has stopped responding they move fast. They don't know somebody has
     tampered with it though,for all they know it was hit by a car. And was 
     demolished. But once they find out they will wait for you. And they *WILL*
     get you,so if you do it. Do it carefully. And remember once is the only 
     it will work. Well,thats my artical for 10-94, Later all.. And
     remember this is for entertainment only.
