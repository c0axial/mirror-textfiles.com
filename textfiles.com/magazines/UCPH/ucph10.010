   This phile is designed to identify various kinds of ETF (electronic toll
fraud) devices and to describe thier operation, according to a booklet put
out by Bell entitled: THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF ELECTRONIC TOLL
FRAUD DEVICES. (For official use only).        There are several different
types of electronic equipment which may be generally classified as ETF
devices. The most significant is the "Blue Box". The characteristics of each
type of device are discussed below.
 
 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
              *BLUE BOX*
              ----- ----
 
   The "Blue Box" was so named because of the color of the first one found.
The design and hardware used in the Blue Box is fairly sophisticated, and its
size varies from a large piece of apparatus to a miniaturized unit that is
approximately the size of a "king size" package of cigarettes.      The Blue
Box contains 12 or 13 buttons or switches that emit multi- frequency tones
characteristic of the tones used in the normal operation of the telephone
toll (long distance) switching network. The Blue Box enables its user to
originate fraudulent ("free") toll calls by circumventing toll billing
equipment. The Blue Box may be directly connected to a phone line, or it may
be acoustically coupled to a telephone handset by placing the Blue Box's
speaker next to the trans mitter or the telephone handset. The operation of a
Blue Box will be dis- cussed in more detail below.
 
    To understand the nature of a fraudulent Blue Box call, it is necessary to
understand the basic operation of the Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) telephone
network. When a DDD call is properly originated, the calling number is
identified as an integral part of establishing the connection. This may be
done either automatically or, in some cases, by an operator asking the
calling party for his telephone number. This information is entered on a tape
in the Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) office. This tape also contains the
number assigned to the trunk line over which the call is to be sent. The
information relating to the call contained on the tape includes: called
number indentification , time of origination of call, and info that the
called number answered the call. The time of disconnect at the end of the
call is also reForded.      Although the tape contains info with respect to
many different calls, the various data entries with respect to a single call
are eventually correlated to provide billing info for use by your Bell's
accounting department.
 
The typical Blue Box user usually dials a number that will route the call
into the telephone network without charge. For example, the user will very
often call a well-known INWATS (toll- free) customer's number. The Blue Box
user, after gaining this access to the network and, in effect, "seizing"
control and complete dominion over the line, operates a key on the Blue Box
which emits a 2600 Hertz (cycles per second) tone. This tone causes the
switching equipment to release the conn ection to the INWATS customer's line.
The 2600Hz tone is a signal that the calling party has hung up. The Blue Box
simulates this condition. However, in fact the local trunk on the calling
party's end is still connected to the toll network. The Blue Box user now
operates the "KP" (Key Pulse) key on the Blue Box to notify the toll switch-
ing equipment that switching signals are about to be emitted. The user then
pushes the "number" buttons on the Blue Box corresponding to the telephone #
being called. After doing so he/she operates the "ST" (Start) key to indicate
to the switching equipment that signalling is complete. If the call is
completed, only the portion of the original call prior to the emission of
2600Hz tone is recorded on the AMA tape. The tones emitted by the Blue Box
are not recorded on the AMA tape. There foref, because the original call to
the INWATS # is toll-free, no billing is rendered in connection with the
call.

  Although the above is a description of a typical Blue Box operation using a
common method of entry into the network, the operation of a Blue Box may vary
in any one or all of the following respects:
 
      (a) The Blue Box may include a rotary dial to apply the 2600Hz tone and
the switching signals. This type of Blue Box is called a "dial pulser" or
"rotary SF" Blue box.
 
      (b) Entrance into the DDD toll network may be effected by a pretext call
to any other toll-free # such as Universal Directory ASSistance (555-1212) or
any # in the INWATS network, either inter-state or intra- state, working or
non-working.
 
      (c) Entrance into the DDD toll network may also be in the form of "short
haul" calling. A "short haul" call is a call to any # which will result in a
lesser amount of toll charges than the charges for the call to be completed
by the Blue Box. For example, a call to Birmingham from Atlanta may cost $.80
for the first 3 minutes while a call from Atlanta to Los Angeles is $1.85 for
3 minutes. Thus, a short haul, 3-minute call to Birmingham from Atlanta,
switched by use of a Blue Box to Los Angeles, would result in a net fraud of
$1.05 for a 3 minute call.
 
       (d) A Blue Box may be wired into the telephone line or acoustically
coupled by placing the speaker of the Blue Box near the transmitter of the
phone handset. The Blue Box may even be built inside a regular Touch-Tone
phone, using the phone's pushbuttons for the Blue Box's signalling tones.
 
       (e) A magnetic tape recording may be used to record the Blue Box tones
representative of specific phone #'s. Such a tape recording could be used in
lieu of a Blue Box to fraud- ulently place calls to the phone #'s recorded on
the magnetic tape.
 
 
   All Blue Boxes, except "dial pulse" or "Rotary SF" Blue Boxes, must have
the following 4 common operating capabilities:
 
       (a) It must have signalling capability in the form of a 2600Hz tone.
This tone is used by the toll network to indicate, either by its presence or
its absence, an "on hook" (idle) or "off hook" (busy) condition of the
trunk.
 
       (b) The Blue Box must have a "KP" tones that unlocks or readies the
multi-frequency reciever at the called end to receive the tones corresponding
to the called phone #.
 
       (c) The typical Blue Box must be able to emit MF tones which are used
to transmit phone #'s over the toll network. Each digit of a phone # is
represented by a combination of 2 tones . For example, the digit 2 is
x-mitted by a combination of 700Hz and 1100Hz.
 
       (d) The Blue Box must have an "ST" key which consists of a combina-
tion of 2 tones that tell the equipment at the called end that all digits
have been sent and that the equipment should start switching the call to the
called number.
 
   The "Dial Pulser" or "Rotary SF" Blue Box requires only a dial with a
signalling capability to produce a 2600Hz tone.

              *BLACK BOX*
              ------ ----
 
 
   This ETF device is so-named because of the color of the first one found. It
varies in size and usually has one or two switches or buttons.      Attached
to the telephone line of a called party, the Black Box provides toll-free
calling *to* that party's line. A Black Box user informs other persons
beforehand that they will not be charged for any call placed to him. The user
then operates the device causing a "non-charge" condition ("no answer" or
"disconnect") to be recorded on the telphone company's billing equip ment. A
Black Box is relatively simple to construct and is much less sophisti- cated
than a Blue Box.
 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 
              *Cheese Box*
              ------- ----
 
   This device is so-named for the container in which the first one was found.
Its design may be crude or very sophisticated. Its size varies; one was found
the size of a half-dollar.
 
   A Cheese Box is used most often by bookmakers or betters to place wagers
without detection from a remote location. The device inter-connects 2 phone
lines, each having different #'s but each terminating at the same location.
In effect, there are 2 phones at the same location which are linked together
through a Cheese Box. It is usually foundn in an unoccupied apartment
connected to a phone jack or connecting block. The bookmaker, at some remote
location, dials one of the numbers and stays on the line. Various bettors
dial the other number but are automatically connected with the book maker by
means of the Cheese Box inter connection. If, in addition to a cheese box, a
Black Box is included in the arrangement, the combined equipment would permit
toll-free calling on either line to the other line. If a police raid were
conducted at the terminating point of the conversations -the location of the
Cheese Box- there would be no evidence of gambling activity. This device is
sometimes difficult to identify. Law enforcement officials have been advised
that when unusual devices are found associated with telephone connections the
phone company security representitives should be contacted to assist in
indentification. (This probably would be good for a BBS , especially with the
Black Box set up. and if you ever decided to take the board down, you
wouldn't have to change your phone #. It also makes it so you yourself cannot
be traced. I am not sure about calling out from one though)

              *RED BOX*
              ---- ----
 
   This device it coupled acoustically to the handset transmitter of a single-
slot coin telephone. The device emits signals identical to those tones emitted
when coins are deposited. Thus, local or toll calls may be placed without the
actual deposit of coins.

#11 "YELLOW BOX PLANS"
     By CAPTAIN HOOK
     On Feb  3, 1986  5:47

 Now to begin with you need the 
   following:


1) A telephone line showing up in the
    wall.You can find the opening
   behind all those round plates
  AT&T puts in when they disconnect
  or begin to put a phone in.
2) 1 Modular jack

3) 1 Screwdriver

4) 1 Human being who knows what
   the hell their doing!!!!
   (in other words an IQ of 3 or so
    will do)

PREPARATION:

1)  open the plate to expose the wire
    running through the wall or you ca
   n remove an old jack to find the 
   wire.(Note: it must be a complete 
    wire not an end as is used for the
    setup of a normal phone)
2) Cut the wire in half.Now check your
   other phones (Note: i had 2 other
   phones so one works the other wont
   )
3) Now splice up the 2 ends of the
   wire you just cut.You will find
    4 or 6 color coded wires on each
    end.
4) Splice up each smaller wire so as
   the metal is exposed.
5) Next now this is the hard part
   look at the jack at match the color
   s(Note:if you cant do this:
   a) get a very sharp razor blade
   b) now put to the wrists and slice
     that.
   c) wait about an hour and your dead
    KINDA FINAL ISNT IT!!!!!
6) each screw will now have 2 of each
    colore wire on it.
7) Plug in the phone.

YOUR DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE:THIS PROCESS IS IRREVERSABLE!!!!This bulletin has been taken from the OSUNY files from 82/83
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS BULLETIN IS FOR IN FORMATION PURPOSES
ONLY AND YOU SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO BUILD  THIS DEVICE FOR
USE IN ANY FRAUDULENT OR ILLEGAL ACT.

     The XR-2207 chip is a Voltage-Contr olled Oscillator and a 14 
pin device thu s you must be very careful when soldering
 the parts  to  this  device. It is a little dificult to actually  draw a 
schematic on a 80 character scren using limited gra phics but will 
give it a try.

     This is a diagram of how to locate the different pins on the chip please
no tice that pin one is the closest to the n otch on top  of the chip.  The
first thing we'll do is to connect power to the chip  (remember that  you
need to build two of these to get a complete system) this is accomplished by
connecting the positive wire of the battery lead to pin 1 one leg of R1 and R2
is solder to pin 11 the other leg of R1 goes to pin 1 or to the  positive of 
the battery. The other leg of R2 goes to ground, C1 goes between pin 10
and ground. 
   The timing capacitor or C2 goes between  pins 2 and 3 of the chip
pins 8 and 9 should be grounded to ground. Pin 14 is the output 
and this is where one leg of C4 (C3 goes on the other VCO) in series with
R3(the same goes for the other VCO) and to one lead of the speaker.
 

     The trimmer pots P1 to P10 should be grouped in groups of  5  pots  each
.   the way you group it is by soldering one end of the pot to each other
leaving the wiper and the other end free.
 
                   | This end goes to pin 6 of the chip
                   |

          This article will tell you how to take a normal touch tone keypad and
convert it to a portable unit. First of all, the tones made by a touch on
telephone are not single tones, they are a combination of two tones, making
'DTMF' (Dual tone Multi-frequency). The normal tone telephone dials 12
different signals (see bulletin on Silver Boxes). The power required by a
keypad is about 25 volts, but they will work with as little as 15, thereby
allowing the use of [file messed up here...]

matching transformer, this is one of those miniature ones available at radio
shack. Enough of the theory, no [file messed up here...]

You will need:
 
<1> Touch Tone Keypad
<2> Minature 1000 to 8OHM transformer
   (Radio Shack # 273-1380)
<3> A standard 8-OHM speaker
<4> Two 9-VOLT Radio Bateries

connections. It is also important to read this entire article before
attemping to construct this.
 
          First, connect the red wire of the transformer to either terminal on the speaker. Now connect the white wire from the transformer to the other 
terminal speaker. Next, connect the red (positive) wire of one battery
clip to the black wire on the other battery clip. Now connect the remaining red wire on the second battery clip to the green wire from the touch tone pad. Connect the blue wire from the touch tone pad to the orange-and-black striped wire from the touch to

black lead from the first battery clip. You have now finished the power
connection to the keypad.
          Next, connect the black wire from the keypad to the blue wire on the transformer. Now connect the red-and-green striped wire from the keypad to the green wire on the transformer. The black wire on the transformer should not
be connected to anything, along with quite a few wires from the keypad.
The connection of the keypad is now complete. All you have to do is 
connect two nine volt batteries to the battery clips, and you'll be 
ready to go. You may want to mount it in a case for easy portability.

This article will tell you how to change a normal touch tone
keypad and convert it to a portable unit. In addition, we
give the touch-tone frequencies.
 
First of all, the tones made by a touch tone telephone are not
single tones, they are a combination of two tones, making "DTMF"
(dual tone multi-frequency). The normal tone telephone dials 12
different signals, but is capable of dialing 16 different signals
(see bulletin on silver boxes).
 
The power required by a keypad is about 25 volts, but they will
work with as little as 15, thereby allowing the use of two 9-
volt radio batteries.  As you may have guessed, they are also
designed to operate with a telephone type speaker (and phone
line), and not the standard 8-ohm speaker which needs to be used
for adequate volume.  To accompolish this, we use a matching
transformer, this is one of those miniature ones available at
Radio Shack.  Enough of the theory, now for the circuit.
 
You will need:
 
A touch tone keypad
A miniature 1000 to 8 ohm transformer (Radio Shack # 273-1380)
A standard 8-ohm speaker
Two 9-volt radio batteries
Two 9-volt battery clips
A case to put it all in (optional)
 
A few construction notes, I suggest that you solder and tape all
connections.  It is also important to read this entire bulletin
before attempting to construct this.
 
First, connect the RED wire of the transformer to either
terminal on the speaker.  Now connect the WHITE wire from the
transformer to the other terminal on the speaker.  Next, connect
the RED (positive) wire of one battery clip to the black wire of
the other battery clip.  Now connect the the remaining RED wire
on the second battery clip to the GREEN wire from the touch tone
pad.  Connect the BLUE wire from the touch tone pad to the
ORANGE-and-BLACK striped wire from the touch tone pad.  To these
two wires, now connect the remaining black lead from first
battery clip.  You have now finished the power connection to the
keypad.  Connect the BLACK wire from the keypad to the BLUE wire
on the transformer.  Next connect the RED-and-GREEN striped wire
from the keypad to the GREEN wire on the transformer.  The BLACK
wire on the transformer should not be connected to anything,
along with quite a few wires from the keypad.  The connection of
the keypad is now complete.  All you have to do is connect two
nine volt batteries to the battery clips, and you'll be ready to
go. You may want to mount it in a case for easy portability.
Note that the silver box modification CAN be made to this unit,
allowing complete remote phreaking.  When none of the buttons
are pressed, this unit uses NO power, thereby eliminating the
need for a power switch, and extending the life of the
batteries.
 
The following are the frequency combinations generated by each
button on the keypad.

             3 WAY CALLING           
       Written by The Mortician      
 
 
 
     1) To do this you need two phone
lines with the jacks somewhat near each
other, or at least access to each jack
from a comman place as you will have to
run wires between the two different jacks.
 
     2) Now open up each jack and take a
look at the inside. (You can open it by
unscrewing the center screw on most modular
jacks.) You will see 4 terminals(Places where
wires meet) There should be one Red, One yellow
One Green, One black. Now what you will do
is take two extra wires(Preferably one Red
and the Other Green from your garage or where
ever you keep that shit). Now take your
red wire and attach one end to the Red
terminal. Do the Same with the green.
 
      3) Repeat step 2 with the jack for the
other line. So Now you will have a Red and
Greed Free wire for each Line.
 
      4) Now Get a Single Pole Double Throw Switch
From Radio Shack(Like $.28) Or where ever you can
find one.
      5) Now put the switch in between the
two green wires and the two red wires. Such
that when you turn the switch on the green
wires will be connected and the Red will be too.
If you have any questions call The Morgue
and leave me feedback and I will get back to you.

       Use: Well Say your two lines are 6666 and 7777.
Who cares about the prefix. Any way I will call them
6 and 7. Pick up 6 and call somebody. Now call another
person on line 7. Throw the switch. The Person on 7 will
now be able to hear the person on 6 and vice versa. You
can also hang up one of the phones and talk through the
other and both will still hear you. Because of the
way this is set up the person on 6 will hear the peron
on 7 faintly but it isn't that bad. That is true for 7
hearing 6 too. Fool around with id and see what you get.

Now at last, Underground_Elite brings you these ultrasophisticated box plans
for, well, uh, I guess we just kind of bring them for you. After many months
of keeping this puppy secret, we here at Underground_Elite have finally come
to the consensus that the public oughtn't be kept in the dark from the wrath
of Ma Bell, that great telephone company in the sky.
 
The Urine Box (tm) basically creates a capacitative disturbance between the
ring and tip wires in another's telephone headset. I have utilized this to the
distinct advantage of the operator of the Urine box and to the disadvantage
of the other party involved, hopefully you won't get caught.
 
Without further a doo, wire this schematic together. Copper wire (or gold)
will work best due to its lessened resistance. It might be a good idea to
keep the wiring cooled, to further reduce current loss.

note1 - VR1 is a three position variable resistor, enabling settings
equivalent to 100k ohms, 210k ohms, and 320k ohms (all 110k apart).
 
note2 - The diodes are silicon-germanium based bipolar RF reducers to limit
current polarity reversal. If these are placed backwards the box will not
work as intended.
 
note3 - The speaker will emit low tones when the SPST is closed (ie the box
is "ON") and when the settings of VR1 are moved to higher resistance the tone
level will increase.
 
note4 - Place setting evaluation symbols to represet the lowest resistance
setting for VR1 to be "STEAM", the second (210) to be "MELT", the third (320)
to be "VAPORIZE". 
 
Usage of box.
 
Use in place of your normal telephone receiver. Do not attempt usage as a
regular phone. Call victim by sending tones through speaker with tape recorded
noise. Use touch tone sounds as pulse requires electric disruption of line,
not just audio. After answer (listen in on SPKR 1) set VR1 to desired strength
and let her go. Victim will feel unpleasant sensations in his/her head and
will undergo a series of high intensity seizures, not unlike epilepsy, and
jointly proportional to VR-1 setting and time induced.
 
Settings. (The Fun Part)
 
STEAM. A short -poof- of water vapor condenses within the victim's earpiece,
       rendering the telephone short circuited and the victim quite dazed.
MELT.  Causes structural phase change of receiver (usually reinforced
       ureaformaldehyde plastic material - high tech). This has the unpleasant
       bonus of removing the victim's hand.
VAPORIZE. If the victim is particularly nasty, this setting will remove his
       upper anatomy (if box is enabled properly, that is!). Continued usage
       of this setting is generally not recommended, as death or other serious
       injury will accompany.

Yes, I will refuse to take responsibility for your incompetence in electrical
doings. This includes my reluctance to give court testimony, etc. etc.

 To put together a TV station you will need this stuff:

A VCR or Camcorder with video or RF outputs

A Ham Radio 6-meter Band Linear amplifier
        (This boosts the RF signal from the VCR for broadcasting)
        (The Linear Amp should have a bandwidth of 6 MHz for best results)
        A cable television RF distribution amplifier may also be used.

Coaxial cable with UHF connectors
       (Connects the Linear Amp to the Antenna)

A cable-TV patch cable with an F-connector and a UHF connector
       (To connect the RF signal to the Linear Amp)
       (F-connectors are the small ones used with cable TV)
       (UHF connectors are the large ones used for Ham Radio)

If your VCR does not have RF outputs:
       An external RF modulator (converts video to channel 3,6,12 etc.)
       a cable with RCA connectors (a standard stereo cord is ok)

A 6-meter Ham radio antenna.

If you do not have a pre-made 6-meter antenna:
       About 20 feet of strong wire
       3 ceramic antenna insulators
       another UHF connector

 Likely places to get the linear amplifier, connectors and cables is a
Ham Radio swapmeet, a Ham club newsletter's classified ads, a Buy-Sell-Trade
paper like The Recycler, or at a store specializing in Ham gear.
RF modulators are available at specialty video stores, or major VCR dealers.

[]   devices (name of device in brackets)
<I>  ceramic insulator (the kind with a hole at each end)


Building The Dipole Antenna:

          wire                        wire
<I>---------------------+<I>+----------------------<I>
                        |   |
           Short coax   |   |
                         [U]    UHF connector

The antenna is set up much like a clothesline with the wires tethered
straight out horizontally. The outer insulators are used to isolate the
antenna from the tether lines, which should be rope or nylon cords
for good results. The inner insulator isolates a gap between the two
long wires of the antenna.

The length of the wires used for the antenna is critical.
Look up the length in feet for the channel you want to use in the
table below & make each of the two long wires that length.
As a rule of thumb, a wire half-wave antenna's length in feet is equal to
468 divided by the frequency in MHz.

Subject: Re:  Infinity

 Yes, infinity transmitters do exist. they work on the principle that
the audio path is made even before a dialed phone starts to ring.
one sends a tone down the line which tells the infinity transmitter
to "pick up" the phone before the ringing starts, and can then listen
to teh location where the bug is planted. however these devices are
pretty much made obsolete by the fact that any of the ESS switches
do not open an audio path untill they receive answer supervision
from the dialed end.

Subject: Re: Infinity

    Ever heard of an "Infinity Transmitter"?
    
Yeah, they are pretty old tech bugging devices.  They used to work fine,
but with the advent of separate signalling and voice circuits in ESS
(the electronic version of Ma Bell's switching system) they became
obsolete.

The idea was that the bug would listen to the phone line for a tone.
When it heard the tone (or combination of tones -- they were called
harmonica bugs because people often used harmonica notes to trigger them)
it would pick up the phone and you could listen to what was going on
in the room that the phone was in, before the phone rang.  The problem
in ESS is that the caller is not connected to the line when it is
ringing -- the audio connection is only made when the phone is picked
up -- so the bug cannot hear the incoming tone.  No audio path to
transmit the tone, no infinity bugs.

One might imagine more sophisticated versions of the infinity bug;  It
could pick up the line WHENEVER it rings, check for the tone, do the
infinity bug thing is the tone is present and if the tone weren't present
it would have to generate its own ringing voltage (for the phone) and
ringing tone (for the caller) until the line really got picked up.   As
you might imagine, the ESS infinity bug would have to be much more
complicated (read more expensive and more likely to be detected) than
the old style ones.  I've never heard of anyone trying this.

There are lots of telephone exchanges that are not ESS (step and crossbar
are the two main alternatives) where the simple old infinity bugs still
work fine.  Any exchange where "Custom Calling" (e.g. call forwarding
or call waiting) is not available is probably not ESS.

People still sell things like infinity bugs as "home baby sitters" or
as burgler alarms, but they answer the phone all the time even though
they only turn the mike on if they receive a tone.  These are usueless
as bugs because no one can make calls TO the target -- the bug always
answers the phone.

You can rest easy re: infinity bugs, although you should be aware that
it is a pretty trivial task to use electronic surveillance these days
and that a lot of people do it.

Subject: Infinity Transmitters

I saw an article on these once (on a bboard that got closed down about
a year later for phone credit card postings). The main idea was that
someone who wanted to tap the room would add this little circuit board
to the phone, which would detect some sort of tone on the line when
the phone first rang, inhibit the ring, and open the microphone.
Something was mentioned about ultrasound (unlikely, given the quality
of the phone lines, but it was being vague), and how you
could tap in from anywhere as long as you could dial direct (ie. even
from England). The main flaw was that the phone was of course busy (to
the outside world) the whole time you were monitoring. It was
allegedly used extensively by PI's to gather ``evidence'' for divorce
proceedings. 
The article did not have much in the way of technical detail;
oh well.

Plan:Okay okay so you have brother's sister's and parents.
You want to hear what they are doing all the time on the
phone huh?

Parts: Female 2 Female RJ-11 jack.  And mini headphone
connector.

Tools:Soldering Iron, Knife, Hot glue or expoxy


Get Started:
Rip open the RJ-11 Jack

There should be a large end and a small end.  They snap apart
and together.  Cut the ends of the wires off the small end.
Cut the Black & Yellow wires off the large end.  Now all's
that's left is 1 each of green and red.  Strip the ends.  Now
Cut a rectangle in the snap of the large connector big enough
for the headphone connector.  Solder the red and green to
oppisite sides of the top of the connector.  Glue the
connector in, then snap it shut.

                              Introduction
                              ------------

     The Tan box allows you to make recordings from a phone line, and it will
only record once the victim's phone is picked up.
     Basically, this is a modified linesman's handset, or "Beige Box."  For a
copy of the Beige Box file, ask your friendly local sysop.  A Beige Box
consists of a speaker and two wires, a red (ring) and a green (tip).  The Tan
Box also works on this principle.


                              Construction
                              ------------

Parts:

A small cassette recorder, preferably a micro cassette recorder.
  (It MUST have both a microphone jack and a remote jack)
A single line recording control. (Radio Shack part number 43-228)
2 alligator clips (Radio Shack number 270-374)
A plastic box to contain the above parts (also available at Radio Shack)
Tan or Black spray paint
7/16 inch hex driver

1.  Take the recording control and cut the modular plug off.  Make sure you
    leave enough wire!

2.  Strip the red and green wires.  (The yellow and black wires are not
    necessary, and can be removed.)

3.  Drill a hole on the end of the plastic box (enough for two wires to go
    through).

4.  Put the recording control in the box and run the red and green wires
    through the hole.  Attach one alligator clip to each of the wires.

5.  Put the micro cassette recorder in the box and plug the remote and
    microphone wires from the recording control into it.

6.  Close the box.

7.  Spray paint the box and wires to make it look like it is supposed to be
    where it is.  (BE SURE YOU LABEL THE WIRES BEFORE YOU PAINT THEM!)


                              Installation
                              ------------


     You can either hook it up to the box on the side of their house or a
bridging head.  Use the 7/16" hex driver to open either of these.  (On older
houses, you may not have to use a hex driver.)  Attach the red wire to the
right terminal and the green to the left.  (Remember: Red-Ring-Right)  If you
attached the box to a bridging head, there may be room to leave it inside.
If you attached it to the side of a house, run the wires out of their box and
close it.  Attach the Tan Box to the side of their house.
     Make sure you come back and get the box pretty soon, or you may find it
gone!  Micro cassette recorders are not cheap!


     Be careful, wiretapping is a felony (2-20 years, a $10,000 fine, or
both), and various other laws may be broken (i.e., recording without the
other party knowing it, etc.)


                  Ways to avoid being Beige/Tan Boxed
                  -----------------------------------


     A tap detector may be purchased at Radio Shack (of course).  If you do
detect a tap, find the box, and you will have just gotten a new tape
recorder!

-/SWITCHBOX PLANS/-
 
 
 
    This tutorial is notable in that it is totally and
absolutely within legal bounds. It's only object is to
guide you in building a device with which you can control,
on many different levels, your home phone lines. It is
designed primarily for two phone numbers, although I
suspect that provisions for more than two can be easily
added. With it, you can put one or both phone lines on
hold with visible indicators of each lines status; conference
call with two people; change a phone from line #1 to line #2;
and lastly, make one phone line physically dead to outside
world. This is good, for instance, if you don't want to
recieve any calls, or if you want to stop someone from talk-
ing on that line really quickly.
    The circut is relatively simple to build and I believe
it is much more economical than buying something like Radio
Shack's line controller. It will require some knowledge of
electronics and the phone line in general, but I don't think
that should be a problem. I have personally found many uses
for the controller, and have put in into a pleasant "project
box" so it is not an eyesore.
    OK, now, let's start with the parts list --------
 
============================================================
                  *** Parts List ***
 
1. Two pushbutton (on-off) switches for hold
2. Two LED's for line status indication
3. One DPDT switch for conferencing
4. One SPST switch for line shut off
5. Another DPDT switch for phone line switching
6. Get some wire, you'll need it!
7. 2 modular phone plugs with at least 10 feet of wire each
8. Two 1.7K ohm resistors
9. *OPTIONAL* - Project Box
=============================================================
                  *** Construction ***
 
    We will take the construction of the switchbox-controller
in parts. First, the hold switches and status indicators. The
following is a diagram of the essential circut:
 
 
 
               Pushbutton #1    LED
--------------------------!x!-----0---
Phone Line #1     1.7K Resistor      !
-----------------/!/!/!/!/------------
 
Some word of explanation is in order. First of all, the
second phone line hold is constructed the same as the first.
Basically, there are two wires come out of your phone line,
the red and the green. You have to experiment to find out
which one is connected to the pushbutton switch and which
one to the Resistor. To do this, just connect it in any
way and then turn the switch on. If the LED lights up, you
connected it right, otherwise reverse the connections.
Got it? Good, now do the same for line #2, following exactly
the same procedure.
 
    Now, let's do an easy one. This will be the line black-
out switch. First, decide which line you wish to black out.
Actually, you can do it to both lines if you wish, just get
an extra SPST switch. Now, connect the switch across the line
as follows:
 
--------------------------------!!!!!!!!
         x                      ! Hold !
        !x! <---Switch          !Circut!
         x                      !      !
--------------------------------!!!!!!!!
 
Don't worry that your line can't handle both circuts, it can.
To test out, pick up a phone on the line you have connected
the switch to and flip it on. There should be dead silence.
Now, turn it off. You should hear a dial tone. You have to be
an absolute idiot if this doesn't work.
 
    OK, let's see what we have so far. If everything is
working you should now have two hold circuts and a black-
out switch connected. Now it really gets tough!
 
    Next on the agenda is the conference switch. I have a
few precautions for you on this one. First, you have to know
what you're doing, and second, it doesn't work that well. The
reason it doesn't is because I am naturally very lazy and
didn't feel like adding the needed phone transformer. But,
it is still good for many uses, limited only by your imag-
ination (to use a cliche').
    First, take the double pole double throw switch into your
hand. It should look like this on the back:
 
                    ---------
                    - 1   2 -
                    - 3   4 -
                    - 5   6 -
                    ---------
          * Note - Numbers correspond to actual pins.
Now connect two wires to pins 3 & 4 and two wires to pins
1 & 2. The wires going to pins one and two are connected
across the first phone line and the wires from three and
four go across the second phone line. Test it out: Pick
up your phone (either line) and wait for dial tone. Then
throw on the conference switch. You should get a second
dial tone. Now dial 555-1212. You should now have two
D.A.'s on the line, asking each other "What City?". If not,
then reverse the connections to phone line #1 or #2, it
doesn't matter. Now it should work. If not, then recheck
EVERYTHING! You messed up!
 
Now for the last section - the phone line switcher. With
this, you can connect a phone directly to the switchbox and
have it operate from line #1 or line #2, depending on the
position of the last DPDT switch. Let me emphasize that this
is optional. Actually, all the circuts are - they are in-
dependent of each other and each can be built separatly or
together.
    Now, refering to the diagram of the DPDT switch above:
Connect two wires to pins 1 & 2. Then connect these to phone
line #1. Now connect two wires to 5 & 6 and connect these to
phone line # 2. Lastly, connect two wires to 3 & 4 and con-
nect the ends of these to a phone. That's it! Now, pick up
the phone and you should hear a dial tone. Throw the switch
and you should hear another dial tone. In some areas you may
dial '958' to hear exactly what number you are currently
connected to, but that should be a problem. If you really
can't figure it out, then either trace the circut back or
call one of the numbers and see if you get a busy signal or
if it rings.
 
Finally - Put the whole mess inside a project case, unless
you like the site of wires all over the place. This also
shouldn't be a problem if you know even the basics of
hardware construction.

The Static Box         Created and Brought to You by: The Usurper and The Raver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We were looming at the Aqua Box plans and we saw something about static on
long-distance calls in the file.  It said that you get static because the
voltage is not getting regulated very well.  So why not have a box that keeps
the voltage regulated so that you can avoid static?  This would be very useful
when calling a BBS with an extender that flakes-out and gives you garbage on
the screen.  So here it is...

* Note: These are our first box plans with schematics, and electronics that I
        made, so bear with me.  And yes, this has been tested.


                                 EQUIPMENT

1. (2) Size 'AA' Batteries, and holder (You could use a adapter, so you won't
       have to buy batteries...ex. A 3,6,9,12 volt adapter in one!)
2. (1) Two fone line connector (Has two plugs from one)
3. (1) Modular plug w/6 inches of colored wire connected.
4.     2 feet of telephone wire
5. (1) 100k Resistor
6.     Soldering Iron
7.     Solder.....get all of this at Radio Shack of course!

                                 INSTRUCTIONS

Have your phone connected to one of the plugs, then if you want to use the
Static box plug it into the other one and put the batteries in the case.  That
will remove static.  This will be useful in using 2400 baud on an extender
(because of shitty lines).  You may want to make the voltage 9 volts, with a 9
volt battery holder.  What the hell, make two, one for 3 volts (Normal stuff),
and one for 9 volts (Special connections like 2400 baud on a extender).  Be
sure not to leave it hooked up, because it may make your phone act funny, and
people may not get calls through!  You could use even a bigger voltage, an use
it as "Lock 'n Trace", and make some asshole squirm!

          (SPDT) switch. (Smallest
          you can find.)
     1    Standard bell phone.

Tools:
     1    Soldering Iron and Solder.
     1    flat-tip screwdriver.
     1    Very patcient person.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1:   Take the casing off your phone by
     loosening the two screws
     underneath it.  (Don't take the
     screws all the way off!)
2:   Loosen (But don't remove) the
     screws on the side of the touch-
     tone keypad. (The ones that attach
     it to the mounting bracket.) and
     CAREFULLY remove the keypad from
     the mounting bracket.
3:   You will notice a plastic cover on
     the keypad; seperate the two
     halves and get the out of your
     way. (Don't destroy them, you will
     need them later.)
4:   Now, look at the top of the pad
     (so the 123 row is facing away,
     and the *0# row is toward you.
     Turn over the keypad. You should
     see a mass of wires, gold plated
     contacts, discrete components, and
     two large doughnut shaped black
     thingies. (These are the coils hat
     make the touch-tone frequencies.
     All you are going to do is connect
     the wires that Ma Bell "Forgot"
     to.)
5:   Look at the coil on the left (with
     5 solder contacts facing you,
     rather than being perpendicular to
     you.) Count over 4 contacts FROM
     the left (or 2 conacts FROM the  ï 7   3                          right) and solder the GRAY wire to
     the fourth post FROM the left.
6:   Solder the other end of the GRAY
     wire to the LEFT pole of the SPDT
     switch.
7:   (The point of no return)..........
     Take a look at the bottom edge of
     the keypad. You should see a row
     of three gold plated contacts (to
     the right of two very large
     capasitors) look at the one on the
     left and GENTELY seperate the two
     touching connectors (They are
     soldered together with a drop of
     solder) and spread them apart.
8:   Solder the brown wire to the top
     contact (The one futhest from
     you), and solder it to the RIGHT
     pole of SPDT switch.
9:   Now, take the blue wire and solder
     it to the bottom (Closest)
     contact.  Solder the other end of
     this wire to the CENTER pole of
     SPDT switch.
***************************************
                 DONE
***************************************
10:  Now put you phone back together.
     (To make it look professonal, make
     a hole in the plastic top of your
     phone and stick the SPDT switch
     through it.
  Now, (Hopefully) when the switch is
in on position you will have a normal
phone and when it is in the other
position the 3, 6, 9, and # keys (Which
are now the A, B, C, and D keys) will
magically produce the SILVER BOX TONES!

===================================
             USING A
           SILVER  BOX
-----------------------------------
  First off, a silver box adds the
four extra tones to your phone that
Ma Bell never told you about. They go  ï 7   3                     like this:

               1  2  3  A
               4  5  6  B
               7  8  9  C
               *  0  #  D

  There used to be many places were
you could use SILVER BOX tones, but
now you can only use it in places were
Ma Bell hasn't gotten around to
replacing here old switchboxes,
(4A), or on Autovan.
  Autovan is a special military phone
line, like a mass of private lines
hooked together (I think, but I'm not
sure).
  To see if a specific area has the
old 4A switchboxes try this test:
  Call up there directory assistance by
using XXX-555-1212, (Where XXX is
the area code you are check out. Now
hold down the "D" key as soon as you
finish dialing. (If you are using the
SILVER BOX that I showed you how to
make; Switch to SILVER BOX tones
and hold down the "#" key.) The phone
should start ringing and the operator
will answer.
  If the operator screams at you to
stop pressing your keypad, then hang
up and try a diffrent areacode. (This
one does not work.)
  If you get a pulsing tone the you got
a good line! Now try out different
numbers. 6 and 7 usually form a loop
line and two people with SILVER
BOXES can talk. But some of these
are whatched, so DON'T say anything
you wouldn't want your mother to
hear!
  I have heard the 213 works but is
being watched. Try out of the way
states like Iowa, Monatana, Wyoming,
ect...

How to build a SILVER box:
 
 
Tools and materials :  Soldering Iron, Solder, Some 22 ga.wire, a SPDT switch,
and a screwdriver.
 
 
1) Unscrew your phone (must be a touch tone, desk type)
2) Remove the mounted pad and take the clear plastic cover from the bottom.
3) Hold the pad with the numbers 0, *, # facing you, and turn
it upside down, so you can see the yellow pc board.
4) You should see 2 black round doughnuts.
5) Position the board so the solder points for the left doughnut face you.
6) Count over four points from the left, and attach a (green) wire to that
   point.
7) Between you and the doughnuts, there should be 2 long yellow
capacitors.  To the right of these, and on the edge of the
board there should be 3 gold contacts. We will use the one on the left.
8) The contact originally is spot welded, so snip it open.
9) To the one nearest you, attach a (red) wire to the other one, a (yellow)
   wire.
10) Run the wires out of the phone, and solder the switch.
11) The orientation should be (red) to center. The switch will
now alternate between normal and 1633hz fourth column tones.
         SILVER BOX DOCUMENTATION
 
       (CONTRIBUTED BY LEX LUTHOR)
 
THE SILVER BOX TRANSFORMS KEYS 3,6,9,# TO A,B,C,D.
THOSE TONES STAND FOR:
"A"- FLASH
"B"-FLASH OVERRIDE (PRIORITY
"C"-PRIORITY COMMUNICATION
"D"-PRIORITY OVERIDE (TOP MILITARY)
THOSE KEYS ONLY WORK ON CERTAIN NETWORKS. NOW WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THOSE EXTRA 
TONES??? CALL ANY LONG DISTANCE DIRECTORY BY DIALING (AREA CODE) 555-1212
AND WHILE IT RINGS PRESS THE # KEY THEN AS THE OPERATOR ANSWERS YOU WILL
DISCONNECT THEM INSTANTLY AND HEAR A PULSING TONE, PRESS 6(NORMAL TON
E) AND IT WILL STOP.THEN IF ANOTHER  PERSON DOES THE SAME THING ON ANOTHER
LINE AND THEN PRESSES 7 YOU SHOULD HAVE A VOICE LINK, 414 A/C IS GOOD FOR ONE
THAT YOU CAN SCREW AROUND WITH THE TONES AND SEE WHAT YOU GET. [/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/]

   The purpose of a Scarlet box is to create a very bad conection, it can be used to crash a BBS or just make life miserable for those you seek to avenge.
 
 
materials: 2 aligator clips, 3 inch wire, or a resister
 
(plan wire will create greatest amount of static)
 
(Resister will decrease the amount of static in porportion to the resister you are useing)
 
 
Step (1): Find the phone box at your victims house, and pop the cover off.
 
Step (2): Find the two prongs that the phone line you wish to box are connected too.
 
Step (3): Hook your aligator clips to your (wire/resister).
 
Step (4): Find the lower middle prong and take off all wires connected to it, i think this disables the gound and call waiting and shit like that.
 
Step (5): Now take one of the aligator clips and attach it to the upper most prong, and take the other and attach it to the lower middle prong.
 
Step (6): Now put the cover back on the box and take off!!

INTRODUCTION

  And now for all you basement engineers... Here's the ROCK BOX!  Basicly what
the Rock Box does is channel the music from the stereo out to the phone line 
via the headphone output.  There are two models to this Box, the Basic Box 
and Advanced Box.  I would recommend the Advanced Box for better sound 
quality, although the Basic one get's the job done.  Well... Enough for the
formalities, now for the Advanced Box!

  Now some of the Benifits of this wonderful little device is that you can
record conversations, at whatever volume you want, without those bothersome
beeps the answering machines make.  Or another fun thing is call up a Rodent
Bridge and blast this thing with your stereo at full... Wala!  The bridge
will most likely be clear, even they won't sit through that shit.  It is a
good idea to hit Radio Shack for a project box and soderless curcuit board,
because this can be messy and a project box can easily make you look like a
pro.  One more use for it is if your computer can generate tones to match a
Box of some sort, this makes a GREAT amplifier for it, with almost no loss in
clearity.  If you have any problems with a humm or it intercepting radio 
transmittions, then call up good-old Bell and get a line static clearer dealy
and splice that into the box via the outgoing line, which SHOULD clear it up.
If that does not seem to help, try putting a 9v battery (you know, the square
ones) on the red and green phone lines, because this will make up for the
power the box drains from the line.  Hope you enjoy the plans and Be watching
for more from me!  L8r...

by THE RESEARCHER
 
This article is presented as a news
item only. It is not to be taken as an
encouragement to make fraudulent
telephone calls.
 
Red boxing consists of simulating the
tones produced when coins are deposited
in a pay phone. Coin tones are beeps of
2200 Hz + 1700 Hz as follows:
 
5 cents - 1 beep, 66 milliseconds
duration.
 
10 cents - 2 beeps, each 66
milliseconds duration with 66
millisecond pause between beeps.
 
25 cents - 5 beeps, each 33
milliseconds duration with a 33
millisecond pause between beeps.
 
Two methods have commonly been used by
phone phreaks to produce these tones
and make free calls.
 
1. The traditional Red Box consisting
of a pair of Wien-bridge oscillators
with the timing controlled by 555 timer
chips.
 
2. Producing the signals with a
computer which are recorded and then
played back into the mouth piece of a
pay phone.
 
A third method has recently appeared
which is a real mind blower. A phreak
in the Midwest has extensively tested a
method of red boxing which uses nothing
more than a pair of brass or aluminum
whistles. The whistles are 1/4 inch in
diameter by 4 inches long and are tuned
by means of a wooden dowel rod which
fits snugly inside. The whistles can be
brought precisely on frequency by
tuning them against a known signal
source such as a computer capable of
producing the tones. Once tuned, the
whistles are glued or taped together so
they can be blown together to produce
the dual tone used in coin signaling.
It has been tested and proven that with
a little practice these whistles can be
used to make free calls. Now you can
blow your money without spending a
cent.
 
 
Please note these whistles are
available (for test purposes only) from

TASI LOCKING FREQ:

TASI (TIME ASSIGNMENT SPEECH INTERPOLATION) IS USED ON SATELITE
TRUNKS, AND BASICALLY ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE PERSON TO USE A TRUNK BY PUTTING
THEM ON WHILE THE OTHER PERSON ISN'T TALKING. OF COURSE, YOU'D NEVER HEAR
THE OTHER PERSON TALKING ON YOUR TRUNK.

 WHEN YOU START TO TALK, HOWEVER, THE TASI CONTROLLER HAS TO FIND AN OPEN
TRUNK FOR YOU. BECAUSE OF THIS, SOME OF YOUR SPEECH IS LOST( BECAUSE OF THE
DELAY IN FINDING A TRUNK) THIS IS CALLED CLIPPING.

WELL, IF YOU WERE TRANSMITTING DATA OVER A TRUNK, CLIPPING WOULD REALLY
FUCK UP THE DATA. SO THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED A TASI LOCKING FREQUENCY WHICH
KEEPS THE TASI FROM PUTTING ANYONE ELSE ON YOUR TRUNK OR YOU ON ANYONE ELSES
TRUNK. IN ANY CASE THE FREQ. IS 1850 HZ. SENT BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION).

Introduction:

        So you want to be James Bond eh? So you want to be a private eye eh.
Well here's your chance to pick up some very important clues or ideas using
your neighbors telephone line. Forget about climbing a telephone pole this sort
of boxing can be done on the ground.

Purpose:

        To tap your neighbors line without your neighbor knowing it. You can
also make FREE (let me repeat that) FREE!! Phone calls to your favorite
K-RAD-GNEW-WAREZ boards.

Materials:

1. Line Man's headset (no you can't buy one that's why we're making one you
   IDIOT)
2. Alligator clips (clips is Plural so you need Two)
3. A phone (preferbly one of those one peice kind that like the ones with the
   numbers and the thing the hangs up on the ONE phone piece)
4. A Telephone wall jack box or whatever they're called
5. Some green and some red wire
6. Some intelligence (very Much needed)

Plans:

        First hook up your one piece phone to the wall jack box. Then take the
alligator clips and attach red wire to one and green wire to the other one. You
should have 2 alligator clips with wire attached. Now strip the wire and open
the Wall jack box you have and attach the red wire with the red screw on the
box and the green wire with the green screw on the box. Your stuff should look
like this.

Hints:

/\/\/\- Red   Wire Alligator Clip

Using Your newly made device:

        Now that you have made or created your little Razz Box then you are
ready to go outside and do your stuff. First go to a neighbor's house and find
the black telephone wires. They should look like Example #1. Then cut off a bit
of the plastic covering so the alligator clips go in easier and you now stick
the alligator clips one on the right and one on the left side of the plastic
wire as shown on the diagram. The Black plastic wire should look like the
diagram. You should get a dialtone. If you do not then switch the alligator
clips around till you do. Remember your neighbors can hear you as well so get
one of the phones with the MUTE option so you can plug into theres quietly.

                              by 
          ___The Dolphin that came from Belmont___ 
 
   Hello  again  Comrade!  Well,  as  usual,  misinformation  has 
penetrated American undergound intellegence sources.  Some people 
are  stating that "Rainbox Box" is hoax!  Bah!  Could not be more 
removed  from  truth even if it came out  of  Russian Information 
Deptartment! So comrade, to dispell disbelief,  this capatalistic 
___The  Dolphin that came from Belmont___ is going to be  showing 
you  how to make your own Rainbow box for fun and support of  the 
workers party! See you in few lines! 
 
   I have just had the misfortune of reading that the rainbow box 
that I constructed is a fraud and never existed.  Being  slightly 
confused,  I  looked over at it and when I saw that it was  still 
there,  I  decided  that someone was wrong  on  their  assumption 
wasn't me. Here is a brief background on the Rainbow box: 
 
"Rainbow  Box:  SUPPOSEDLY non-existant.  Kills trace by  putting 
120v into the phone lines, SUPPOSEDLY!" 
(Exerpt from a phile found on local BBS, author unknown) 
   The  above  sums up what a Rainbow box does,  but it  is  VERY 
understated. Like my creation of the Bottle-Nosed Grey box, it is 
a VERY powerful box capable of doing a great amount of damage  to 
both the phone lines,  your phone and the person at the other end 
of the line's phone a/o modem.  Right now you have everything you 
need to build one, so let's see how. You'll need: 
1 each Telephone (Rotery with access to the mouth part) 
1 each Extention Cord (120v or 220v, your choice) 
1 each wall outlet 
1 each wire splicers 
5 points of I.Q. or above to build this thing. 
2 points of I.Q. or less to actually use it. 
 
Okay,  now:  Unscrew  the  mouth part of the phone and  take  the 
speaker  off.  You'll see two (2) wires.  A Red wire and a  Black 
wire  (please hold all 'No #$%^ Sherlock!' type comments for now, 
thank you.). Now splice the extention cord, you'll see a red wire 
and a black wire.  Splice the black wire in the cord to the black 
wire in the phone,  do the same with the red.  Congrats! You just 
made  a  non-existant Rainbow Box!  Don't  you  feel  proud?  You 
shouldn't, any moron could have figured this out! 
 
How to use:  Bloody hell,  if you can't figure this out,  I ain't 
even gonna tell you (here's a hint: Plug the cord into the wall.) 
 
How  it  works:  The phone lines can resist a charge of 6v and  a 
little more,  when you plug in that cord,  you're sending 120v or 
220v through the lines.  It blows out everything,  but it is  non 
selective.  Odds  are  you  will  take out every  phone   in  the 
neighborhood and get caught. It will melt the phone if you let it 
go  long enough.  WARNING:  THIS DEVICE CAN VERY EASILY  START  A 
FIRE, BE CAREFUL WHEN PLAYING AROUND WITH THIS! 
How this and Bottle-Nosed Grey Box differ:

1)  Bottle-Nosed Grey box is selective and will do damage to only 
your phone,  the line between you and your enemy and your enemy's 
MODEM, whereas the Rainbow Box just takes everything out. 

2)  The amperage  on the Bottle-Nosed Grey box can be  controlled 
by adding or removing capacitors,  but the Rainbow Box has only 2 
settings: Strong Pulse and STRONG pulse. 
 
  Well, now you know about a myth that came to life, the Rainbow
Box! 
 
  Well Comrade, I hoping you enjoy that file. Remember, these are 
only  presented  as  information and are not meant  to  overthrow 
capatalistic  Government  or  destory  phone  company  based   on 
exploitation   of  workers  by  cruel  overlords.  Do  plenty  of 
reading about these,  but don't be stupid and make something like 
that. Das Vadanya!

                        How to Construct a Purple Box. 
                        ------------------------------ 
 
                       Written 26 FEB 1986 by The Flash 
 
     The Purple Box is very simple to construct.  It takes only six
components and a PC board if you want.  The Purple Box is a telephone hold
button.  It will allow you to switch phones very easily. 
 
     A red LED indicates when a party is on hold and is automatically 
extinguished when either party releases the line. 
 
     To install your Purple Box, remove the telephone case and locate the red
and green wires.  From the green wire, make a connection to L1 and from the 
red wire a connection to L2. 
 
     To test the circuit, call a friend and then while pressing the push 
button, hang up the phone.  As soon as the phone is on the hook, you may let 
go of the push button. 
 
Parts: 
 
     D1 = Light Emitting Diode (LED) 
     D2 = 1N4003 Diode 
     R1 = 820 ohm 1/2 Watt 
     R2 = 1K ohm  1/2 Watt

Puce Box

Parts:

2 capacitors-- 100 mg, 250 toke capacity
4 Adiodes, 250 toke PIS (Peak Inhalation State)
A condensation coil (copper tubing)
Knox blocks unflavored gelatin
A beer.

Instructions:

AAttach the capacitors in the following manner:  one to red phone wire, one
Ato green wire.  The schematic is  as follows:

C1 ---|(----
         D1/\D2
          /  \_________ Copper tubing ______ Gelatin
          \  /
         D3\/D4
C2 ---|(----


This is the reception unit.  The send unit is simply the reception unit,
except a psychomagnetic transducer is in place of the tubing.

The LSD is heated at the send unit, causing psychomagnetic fields to
oscillate through the transducer.  The resulting psychomotive force (PMF) is
stored in the capacitors until the peak storage is reached, at which point
the caps discharge into the phone line, giving all telco operators a  nice
buzz.  The PMF reaches the reception unit, where it is stored until
discharged into the diode array, known as the lysergic rectifier.  The
rectifier emits vaporous LSD into the coil, where it is condensed into
drops, which fall on the gelatin to form window pane.

Pop the beer.  You've earned it.

WARNING:  Line noise may cause strychnine formation.

  This will tell you how to make a
portable silver box out of:

       A Radio Shack touch tone pad
       Some wire
       A Soldering iron
       And a SPDT switch

NOTE: You should have an I.Q. above
room tempature before attempting this.
Also, read all of this article before
starting.

WARNING: This may be hazardous to your
freedom.

1} Take off the plastic cover that
stores the batteries and remove the
screw that is in the center of the
batteries. Now use a screw driver to
pry open the box.

2} Now you should have the two halves
in your hands. On the side that has the
circuit board, it should be held by two
clips. Remove the circuit board now.

3} You should now be able to see the
back side of the keypad. Connecting the
the key pad and the circuit board is a
ribben cable. With the ribben ends
connected to the keypad away from you,
count from the left over four wires.
On the fourth wire, take and cut the
plastic on either side on the wire.
Then desolder it.

4} Now stare at the circuit board. Look
at the connections of the chip.
(SEE FIG.) There should be four pins
not connected to anything. On the
ninth pin (first row, first pin) solder
a 3 inch wire to it. The other end goes
to the left side of the spdt switch.

5} Go back to the cable. Solder a 2
inch to the ribben cable you just took
out. This is because it won't reach the
switch. The other end goes to right
side of the switch.

6} Now take a two inch wire and solder
it to the hole that the cable came out
of. Becareful not to get solder on the
other wires. Now take the other end and
solder it to the middle of the switch.

7} Make a hole in the top of the case
to put the switch through. And put it
back together.

(Pretty cool eh?)

_______________________________________

Switch the switch left according to the
way you soldered it to make silver box
tones on the 3,6,9, and # keys.
Switch it to the right for a normal key
pad.
Switching it to the middle does
NOTHING!!!!

This silver is small enough to fit in
your pocket for phreaking at your
nearest pay phone or where ever.

The Pearl Box:Definition - This is a box that may substitute for many boxes
which produce tones in hertz. The Pearl Box when operated correctly can pro-
duce tones from 1-9999hz. As you can see, 2600, 1633, 1336 and other crucial
tones are obviously in its sound spectrum.
 
Materials you will need in order to build The Pearl Box:
========================================================
C1, C2::::::::.5mf or .5uf ceramic disk capacitors
Q1::::::::::::NPN transistor (2N2222 works best)
S1::::::::::::Normally open momentary SPST switch
S2::::::::::::SPST toggle switch
B1::::::::::::Standard 9-Volt battery
R1::::::::::::Single turn, 50k potentiometer
R2::::::::::::  "     "    100k potentiometer
R3::::::::::::  "     "    500k potentiometer
R4::::::::::::  "     "    1meg potentiometer
SPKR::::::::::Standard 8-ohm speaker
T1::::::::::::Mini transformer (8-ohm works best)
Misc.:::::::::Wire, solder, soldering iron, PC board or perfboard, box to
              contain the completed unit, battery clip
 
Instructions for building The Pearl Box:
========================================
 
Since the instruction are EXTREMELY difficult to explain in words, you will be
given a schematic instead. It will be quite difficult to follow but try it any
way. There is also a Hi-Res picture you can get that shows the schematic in
great detail.

Now that you are probably thoroughly confused, let me explain a few minor de-
tails. The potentiometer area is rigged so that the left pole is connected to
the center pole of the potentiometer next to it. The middle terminal of T1 is
connected to the piece of wire that runs down to the end of the battery.
 
Correct operation of The Pearl Box:
===================================
You may want to get some dry-transfer decals at Radio Shack to make this job a
lot easier. Also, some knobs for the tops of the potentiometers may be useful
too. Use the decals to calibrate the knobs.
R1 is the knob for the ones place, R2 is for the tens place, R3 if for the
hundreds place and R4 is for the thousands place. S1 is for producing the all
the tones and S2 is for power.
Step 1: Turn on the power and adjust the knobs for the desired tone.
       (Example: For 2600 hz- R1=0:R2=0:R3=6:R4=2)
Step 2: Hit the pushbutton switch and VWALA! You have the tone. If you don't
  have a tone recheck all connections and schematic. If you still don't have
  a tone call Brainstorm BBS:612-345-2815, The Bay:415-775-2384 or Pirate's
  Harbor:617-720-3600 and leave me e-mail stating what the scene is.
 
 
______________________________________________________________________________
 
         This has been a High Mountain Hackers presentation  -  1985
______________________________________________________________________________
 
Shakepeare is currently working on an improved version of the Pearl Box..
look for the plans soon!                                   The

                            P A R T Y   B O X
                          ---------------------


                       Created by Greyhawke of TDK


        Ever wanted three-way calling without having to pay for it?  Wanted to
connect two phone conversations at once, without any static or excess wiring,
or even having two phone lines?  Ever gone beige boxing and wanted to connect
two operators (or anyone!) but didn't have the necessary stuff with you?  The
party box fixes them all!
        First off, go to your local Radio Shack and pick up the following
parts:

(1)     DPDT slide switch  (all you need is DPST, but DPDTs are easy to get)
(2)     Modular phone jacks
(4)     Alligator clips
        Some wire (doesn't matter what kind)

        For the modular jacks, if you get the kind that look like a box with
the back open, it makes a nice looking party box when you stick them together.

Assembly:

        Take four lengths of wire, and strip the ends about 1/4" on both ends
of the wire.  Connect two wires to the red and green terminals on one phone
jack, and two wires to the red and green terminals on the other phone jack (so
you've used all four pieces of wire).  Connect to the other ends of each wire a
red or green alligator clip (down at Radio Shack they sell some nice ones with
color coded insulator sleeves.  Get these, it's REAL important that you know
the red ends from the green).  If you do this right, you'll have a red and
green aligator clip on each of the two phone jacks, connected to the wires.  By
this time, you should not have any wire end loose; they should all be connected
to SOMETHING.
        Now, if you've been paying attention and you know your boxes, you'll
recognize the two pieces of equipment you've just assembled as beige boxes. 
That's all they are, really, is beige boxes.
        Here's what makes those two beige boxes into a single party box.  Take
four more short (like 1.5") lengths of wire, and strip all the ends to about
1/4".  First connect one side of each wire to a contact on the DPDT or DPST
switch.  Just make sure it's the right switch.  For DPST, you won't have a
problem, but for DPDT, make sure the switch looks like this when the wires are
connected:
                       *-**-* -
                       *-**-* -

        It's doesn't really matter which side you connect the wires to, just
make sure that at least two of them are in the middle.  The wires are connected
to the terminals surrounded by asteriks (*).  Solder each connection carefully
to make sure it's a good one that won't fall off, and make sure none of the
wires are touching each other!!  If they do you've got a short circuit and the
box won't work!
        Here's the tricky part.  Take the bottom two wires (looking at the DPDT
switch from the bottom, so it looks like the above picture) and connect each
one to the red terminal on the phone jacks.  One wire to each jack.  Then, take
the top two wires and connect one to the green terminal on each phone jack. 
Again, one wire to each jack.  Screw down all the terminals good and tight.  If
you've done this correctly, there should be two wires leading to each red and
green terminal on the two phone jacks.  Set the switch so it's in the off
position.  It's off when only the middle terminals of the switch are covered,
or so that the switch is on the side where there aren't any wires coming to the
terminals there.  Just make sure it's in the beige mode.  Your box is now
built.
        (This is if you used the jacks I suggested at the top of the file.)  To
make it look pretty, you can cut away a portion of the plastic surrounding one
of the jacks so that the switch will fit nicely in the place you cut away. 
Also cut away a small half-circle on the bottom of the surrounding plastic to
feed the wires out of (the ones with the alligator clips, not the ones leading
to the switch).  Once these two things are done, and the switch is screwed down
securely, tape it all up, super-glue, who cares.  It doesn't matter; just so it
stays together.
        Once all this is done, here's a few things I like to do to make things
easy.  Put a small dot of white paint in the lower part of the switch, so that
when it's on the paint shows.  This is easy to do.  Also you might want to know
which line you're using for each box.  Just put a glob of a different colored
paint on each side of the party box, and put the same color paint on the wires
leading out of that side of the box.

Use:

        When used in beige box mode (so that the switch is off), the party box
will operate just like two beige boxes.  There are totally, 100% separate from
each other, and the conversations don't get crossed.
        However, when used in the party box mode, the party box connects both
lines to each other, essentially connecting all four people to the same line. 
Everyone can hear each other, and there is little or no static created by doing
this.  It's works great for connecting anyone together, and all that's needed
is each beige box connected to an output device ("Bell Can"), and the switch in
the party mode position.  See a file on beige boxing for detained info on what
to do while boxing, etc, or how to connect to a Bell Can.

Schematic:

        This is a really easy box, but someone might want a schematic, so
here's one:

      <--- to one phone jack                     to the other phone jack --->

       ---------------------------    __/   -----------------------------
       (red [ring] wire)         | __/!     |           (red [ring] wire)
       ------------------------- O/   !_/   O ---------------------------
       (green [tip] wire)      |   __/        |        (green [tip] wire)
                               | O/         O |
                               | |          | |
                               ---          ---

        It's a really bad schematic, but the little things in the middle are
supposed to represent the switch in the off posistion, and the exclamation
points just mean it's a DPST switch that doesn't connect the top and the bottom
termials.  The (-) and the (|) are supposed to be the wire.

Disclaimer:

        This file is, of course, only meant for informational purposes, and is
in no way meant to be used.  Any tapping of telephone lines is a federal
offense, so don't come crying to me if you get busted, because I'm telling you
not to do it.  I'm not responsible for you; you're responsible for you.

BROUGHT TO YOU FROM THE EXPANSIVE, WELL EQUIPED, AND VERY EXPENSIVLY DECORATED
LABORATORIES OF DR. RAT C.I.

THIS BOX FALLS INTO THE PRANK CATAGORY.  IT HAS LITTLE PHREAK/HACK USE, EXCEPT
FOR IRRITATING THE HELL OUT OF ANYONE ON THE PHONE. IT MAKES OPERATORS MORE
PISSED THAN TURNING ON YOUR CARRIER FOR THEM.

A PHASOR IS A DEVICE USING HIGH INTENSITY SOUND TO PRODUCE PAIN. I'M SURE YOU
HAVE SEEN PHASORS (CROWD/DOG CONTROL, PAIN FIELDS, ETC.) FOR SALE IN
INFORMATION UNLIMITED ADS OR CATALOGS. UNFORTUNENTLY THESE OFTEN COST $100 TO
$1000. NATCHLY THIS WOULDN'T DO FOR DR. RAT. SO I CREATED THE POOR MAN'S
PHASOR OR ...PANDORA'S BOX. PRODUCING THE SOUND WAS EASY AND THE CIRCUIT IS
PROBABLY THE SIMPLEST MEATHOD TO PRODUCE A VARIABLE SOUND FROM A 555 CHIP. THE
ONLY DRAWBACK TO P.B. IS THAT YOU NEED TO USE A $13 TWEETER BECAUSE IT USES SO
LITTLE POWER AND GIVES THE LOUDEST OUTP
T OF HIGH FREQUENCY SOUND.

PARTS LIST WITH RADIO SHACK CAT NUMBERS

    1. ONE 555 TIMER (RS#. 276-1723)
    2. ONE .01 MFD CAPACITOR (RS#. 272-131)
    3. ONE 100K VARIABLE RESISTOR (RS#. 271-1722)
    4. ONE TWEETER (RS#. 40-1381)
    5. ONE 9V BATTERY
    6. SOME WIRE (ANY KIND. DR. RAT SUGGESTS RS#. 278-1294)

NOTE: YOU CAN CHANGE THE VALUES OF #2 OR #3 ON THE LIST SLIGHTLY. BUT THESE ARE
      EXTREMELY EASY TO FIND SO TRY TO USE THEM.

NOTE: PIN 1 OF THE 555 IS THE PIN NEXT TO A SMALL DOT ON TOP OF THE CHIP.
      VARIABLE RESISTORS HAVE THREE LEADS--THE CIRCUIT REQUIRES ONLY TWO SO
      CONNECT ONE WIRE TO THE MIDDLE LEAD AND THE OTHER WIRE TO EITHER OF THE
      OUTER LEADS.

HERE'S A PIN BY PIN READING OF THE WIRING IN CASE THE CIRCUIT GOT SCREWED
DURING TRANSMISSION.

1. PIN 1 CONNECTED TO THE -9V, ONE LEAD OF THE TWEETER, AND ONE END OF THE
   CAPACITOR.
2. PIN 2 CONNECTED TO PIN 6 AND THE OTHER END OF THE CAPACITOR
3. PIN 3 CONNECTED TO OTHER LEAD OF TWEETER AND TO ONE LEAD OF THE VARIABLE
   RESISTOR
4. PIN 4 CONNECTED TO PIN 8
5. PIN 5 NOT CONNECTED
6. PIN 6 CONNECTED TO PIN 2 AND OTHER LEAD OF VARIABLE RESISTOR
7. PIN 7 NOT CONNECTED
8. PIN 8 CONNECTED TO +9V AND TO PIN 4

P.B. WORKS ESPECIALY WELL ON ANIMALS, GIRLS, AND YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THE BONES
IN THIER EARS ARE SMALLER.  USE THE VARIABLE RESISTOR TO ADJUST THE PITCH TO
JUST ABOVE THE HIGHEST PITCH YOU CAN HEAR. YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE ANYTHING AT
FIST.  AFTER A SHORT TIME YOU SHOULD FEEL A TINGLE OR BUZZING IN YOU NECK,
EARS, OR SINUS.  A LITTLE WHILE LONGER YOU SHOULD FEEL A HEAD/NECK ACHE THAT
GROWS IN PAIN. TRY TURNING IT TO AN AUDIBAL FREQUENCY AND BLASTING IT THROUGH
THE PHONE. REMEMBER GIRLS CAN HEAR HIGHER PITCHES THAN MOST PEOPLE SO THEY CAN
TELL WHEN YOU HAVE IT ON. TRY TURNING THE PITCH A LITTLE HIGHER SO THEY CAN'T
HEAR IT. ENTERTAIN YOUR CLASS DURING FINALS. THEY CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING BECAUSE
ITS TOO HIGH PITCHED.

    This is a relatively new box, and all it basically does is serve as a phone
ringer. You have two choices for ringers, a piezoelectric transducer (ringer),
or a standard 8 ohm speaker. The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it, but
either will do fine. This circuit can also be used in conjunction with a rust
box to control an external something or other when the phone rings. Just
connect
the 8 ohm speaker output to the inputs on the rust box, and control the pot to
tune it to light the light (which can be replaced by a relay for external
controlling) when the phone rings.

             THE NEON BOX
--------------------------------------
 
A NEON BOX IS A VERY SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT
TO YOUR FONE, THAT WILL ALLOW A VERY
CLEAR PASSAGE FROM YOUR COMPUTER TONES
TO YOUR FONE.  IT ALSO WORKS GREAT FOR
RECORDING TONES, SEX FONE, OR ANYTHING
ELSE YOU WANT TO RECORD OFF OF YOUR
FONE.
 
             TOOLS:
             ------
THIS MODIFICATION IS VERY SIMPLE, AND
CAN BE USED ON MOST FONES, THOUGH IT
IS MORE DIFFICULT ON ONE-PIECE UNITS.
ALL YOU NEED IS AN OLD PAIR OF
HEADFONES, OR SIMILAR, A FILIPS SCREW-
DRIVER, A SOLDERING IRON AND SOME
SOLDER.
 
            INSTRUCTIONS
            ------------
OPEN YOUR FONE WITH THE SCREWDRIVER.
WHEN OPENED, LOOK FOR THE RED AND
BLACK WIRES THAT LEAD TO THE MOUTH-
PIECE. (IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHICH
WIRES LEAD TO THE MOUTHPIECE, OPEN UP
THE MOUTHPIECE AND FIND THE SAME
COLOR WIRES ON THE BASE. FOR ONE-PIECE
UNITS, JUST LOCATE THE MOUTHPIECE).
 
WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND THE MOUTHPIECE,
OR WIRES, CUT THE EARD OF THE HEAD-
FONES OFF, AND ONE WIRE (THE ONE THAT
LEADS TO THE RIGHT EAR). STRIP THE
LEFT WIRE SO ABOUT AN EIGHTH INCH IS
SHOWING. KEEP THE OTHER SIDE IN TACT.
 
THEN ON THE RED WIRE, SOLDER THE WIRE
THAT IS SEPARATLY SEALED FROM THE
OTHER ONE. ON THE BLACK WIRE (THESE
ARE THE ENDS OF THE WIRE ON THE CIR-
CUIT BOARD) SOLDER THE WAIRE WRAPPED
AROUND THE OTHER WIRE.  THEN SOLDER A
HOLE FOR THE WIRE. YOU HAVE NOW MADE
A NEON BOX.MUSIC BOX

   Another  Celestial  Elite phile!


For those of you who are sick and
tired of ruining their phone with
white and beige boxes that make
stupid (and now because of ESS,
worthless) tones, there is now an
alternative.  (Thanks to Magnus!)


 How this came about:

Once I was reading and complaining
that there must be a better way to
attach alligator clips to a phun
phone without ruining it and making
it a permanent phone man's set.

I began to contemplate the basic idea
of this new box, when I said, "I just
happen to have a spare modulator and
some phone wire in my phreak kit at
home!"  Immediately I got some
alligator clips.  By the thought I
was thinking, I knew I was up to
something to solve this pain in the
ass problem.


 Construction of the Modu-Box:

You will need:

2 alligator clips
2 lengths of wire
   Preferably red and green about 1/2
   a foot long.
1 phone modulator
   This can be bought (shoplifted!)
   at Radio Shack or other
   electronics stores for not very
   many bucks.  (No bucks if
   shoplifted: the five finger
   discount)  They are simply a
   little beige colored square piece
   of plastic that has a phone jack
   in the front, and when the back is
   taken off, the inside has 4 wires
   ready to hitch up to a phone line.

Symbols:

Y R B G - yellow, red, black, and
          green terminals inside
 - length of red or green wire
      < - alligator clip

             
           |B|  |G<
             

             
           |Y|  |R<
             

The black and yellow should be left
alone.  (for later use)

Now plug your phone into the jack,
open up the terminal (explained in
the "Terminal Phun" phile), attach
the alligator clips to the bolts
inside, and if you get a dial tone,
then phreak OUT!

If you really want to be a smartass,
you can use the black and yellow also
and make a party line!  (brown box)

     Please bear with me, as the construction of this box will seem rather 
     silly.  This box was found in a construction site.  Or rather, it found 
     us at a construction site.  We were using a $5 Radio Shack phone out of 
     a semi-completed office building.  One afternoon during a holiday, and 
     immediately following a storm, we found our bus in shambles.  To our 
     suprise, we also found that one of the phone connections we were tapping 
     had been draped through a murky puddle.  The fact that suprised us even 
     more was that this line still worked and now posessed some great 
     capibilities.


Materials:

2 tupperware or similar 8oz contianers
1 small bag earth (dirt) (12oz)
1 pint water
2 lantern batteries
1 nine volt battery
1 battery clip
2 SPST switches
4 ounces of iron shavings
2 polar magnets
5 feet wire
1 set soldering equipment


     This is the part you won't believe.  Take the tupperware containers, and 
     fill them with a mixture of the earth and the iron shavings.  Make sure 
     that the mixture is well done.  (*NOTE* for best results, use the sand in 
     fine ash trays.)  Cut the cut the red and green wires and splice the 
     switches into them.  From the switches, solder wire to the magnets.  
     Connect the red to the + (positive) side of one magnet, and the green to 
     the - (negative) side of the second magnet.  From the other poles of the 
     magnet, solder wires the battery & clip.  Make sure the + (positive) and 
     - (negative) are correct.  Set the nine-volt battery between the two 
     tupperware containers and place the battery end of the two magnets into 
     the tupperware.  Now connect wire to the two poles of the lantern 
     battery, and place them in the same containers as the poles of the 
     magnets/9-volt battery.  You are almost done.  Finally, add just enough 
     water to the two pots, and let them sit in the sun and bake like bricks.
     at this point, you have a MAUVE BOX.



Explaning and Using What You Have:

     The red and green wires have been places into a magnetic field which is 
     being charged continually be a lantern battery.  (It is necessary to 
     change this battery every one to one and a half months.)  This will 
     literaly pull in the nearest phone conversatiion.  (Don't try this in a 
     big apartment or dorm.)  When the 9-volt battery is connected, this will 
     now create enough current for the poles of the magnets to reverse 
     themselves (perhaps you're seen Mr. Wizard do this.  It's just like with 
     the soap).  At this point, you have a phone transmitting to one (if not 
     more) of the nearest phones.  (Again, if you're in a dorm, don't try 
     this.)  I suppose this just accomplishes what a tap would do, but with a 
     MAUVE BOX, your fingerprints never will show on a terminal or on 
     someones telephone lines.  


Notes and Addendum:

     This will only work with a touch-tone phone connected to a phone line.  
     When the switches are pulled, it's off your line and into the air.  This 
     is named a MAUVE BOX, becuase this is the most disgusting box, and I find 
     mauve to be the single most disgusting colour I know of.  Also, this file 
     is for information purposes only.  This is not to be used in an illegal 
     mannar.  Perhaps one of these by the pool, sending to your sethe co-author, accept no 
     responsibility for your actions with the MAUVE BOX.  Thank you...Note to sysops: You are welcome to 
  download this file and use it on

      Better Homes and Blue Boxing

               Part I

        Theory of Operation

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has
always been the most noble form of
phreaking. As opposed to such things
as using an MCI code to make a free
fone call, which is merely mindless
pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing is
actual interaction with the Bell
System toll network. It is likewise
advisable to be more cautious when
blue boxing, but the careful phreak
will not be caught, regardless of what
type of switching system he is under.
  In this part, I will explain how and
why blue boxing works, as well as
where. In later parts, I will give
more practical information for blue
boxing and routing information.
  To begin with, blue boxing is simply
communicating with trunks. Trunks must
not be confused with subscriber lines
(or "customer loops") which are
standard telefone lines. Trunks are
those lines that connect central
offices. Now, when trunks are not in
use (i.e., idle or "on-hook" state)
they have 2600Hz applied to them. If
they are two-way trunks, there is
2600Hz in both directions. When a
trunk IS in use (busy or "off-hook"
state"), the 2600Hz is removed from
the side that is off-hook. The 2600Hz
is therefore known as a supervisory
signal, because it indicates the
status of a trunk; on hook (tone) or
off-hook (no tone). Note also that
2600Hz denoted SF (single frequency)
signalling and is "in-band." This is
very important. "In-band" means that
is is within the band of frequencies
that may be transmitted over normal
telefone lines. Other SF signals, such
as 3700Hz are used also. However, they
cannot be carried over the telefone
network normally (they are "out-of-
band") and are therefore not able to
be taken advantage of as 2600Hz is.
  Back to trunks. Let's take a
hypothetical phone call. You pick up
your fone and dial 1+806-258-1234
(your good friend in Armarillo,
Texas). For ease, we'll assume that
you are on #5 Crossbar switching and
not in the 806 area. Your central
office (CO) would recognize that
806 is a foreign NPA, so it would
route the call to the toll centre
that serves you. [For the sake of
accuracy here, and for the more
experienced readers, note that the
CO in question is a class 5 with
LAMA that uses out-of-band SF
supervisory signalling]. Depending
on where you are in the country, the
call would leave your toll centre
(on more trunks) to another toll
centre, or office of higher "rank".
Then it would be routed to central
office 806-258 eventually and the
call would be completed. Illustration:

A---CO1-------TC1------TC2----CO2----B

A=you  CO1=your central office
TC1=your toll office. 
TC2=toll office in Amarillo.
CO2=806-258 central office. 
B=your friend (806-258-1234)

  In this situation it would be
realistic to say that CO2 uses SF
in-band (2600Hz) signalling, while
all the others use out-of-band
signalling (3700Hz). If you don't
understand this, don't worry too much.
I am pointing this out merely for the
sake of accuracy. The point is that
while you are connected to 806-258-
1234, all those trunks from YOUR
central office (CO1) to the 806-258
central office (CO2) do *NOT* have
2600Hz on them, indicating to the
Bell equipment that a call is in
progress and the trunks are in use.
  Now let's say you're tired of
talking to your friend in Amarillo
(806-258-1234) so you send a 2600Hz
down the line. This tone travels down
the line to your friend's central
office (CO2) where it is detected.
However, that CO thinks that the
2600Hz is originating from Bell
equipment, indicating to it that
you've hung up, and thus the trunks
are once again idle (with 2600Hz
present on them). But actually, you
have not hung up, you have fooled the
equipment at your friend's CO into
thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects
him and resets the equipment to
prepare for the next call. All this
happens very quickly (300-800ms for
step-by-step equipment and 150-400ms for other equipment).
  When you stop sending 2600Hz (after
about a second), the equipment thinks
that another call is coming towards
it (e.g. it thinks the far end has
come "off-hook" since the tone has
stopped. It could be thought of as a
toggle switch: tone --> on hook, no
tone -->off hook. Now that you've
stopped sending 2600Hz, several things
happen:
1) A trunk is seized.

2) A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end
from the CALLED end indicating that
the CALLED end (trunk) is not ready to
receive digits yet.

3) A register is found and attached
to the CALLED end of the trunk within
about two seconds (max).

4) A start-dial signal is sent to the
CALLING end from the CALLED end
indicating that the CALLED end is
ready to receive digits.

Now, all of this is pretty much
transparent to the blue boxer. All he
really hears when these four things
happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So,
seizure of a trunk would go something
like this:

  1> Send a 2600Hz
  2> Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.
  3> [beep][kerchunk]

  Once this happens, you are connected
to a tandem that is ready to obey your
every command. The next step is to
send signalling information in order
to place your call. For this you must
simulate the signalling used by
operators and automatic toll-dialing
equipment for use on trunks. There
are mainly two systems, DP and MF.
However, DP went out with the dinosaur
, so I'll only discuss MF signalling.
MF (multi-frequency) signalling is the
signalling used by the majority of the
inter- and intra-lata network. It is
also used in international dialing
known as the CCITT no.5 system.
  MF signalling consists of 7 frequen-
cies, beginning with 700Hz and
separated by 200Hz. A different set of
two of the 7 frequencies represent the
digits 0 thru 9, plus an additional 5
special keys. The frequencies and uses
are as follows:

Frequencies (Hz)  Domestic    Int'l
--------------------------------------
 700+900             1          1
 700+1100            2          2
 900+1100            3          3
 700+1300            4          4
 900+1300            5          5
1100+1300            6          6
 700+1500            7          7
 900+1500            8          8
1100+1500            9          9
1300+1500            0          0

 700+1700           ST3p       Code 11
 900+1700           STp        Code 12
1100+1700           KP         KP1
1300+1700           ST2p       KP2
1500+1700           ST         ST

  The timing of all the MF signals is
a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which
should have a duration of 100ms. There
should also be a 60ms silent period
between digits. This is very flexible,
however, and most Bell equipment will
accept outrageous timings.
  In addition to the standard uses
listed above, MF pulsing also has
expanded usages known as "expanded
inband signalling" that include such
things as coin collect, coin return,
ringback, operator attached, and
operator released. KP2, code 11, and
code 12 and the ST_ps (STart "primes")
all have special uses which will be
mentioned only briefly here.
  To complete a call using a blue box,
once seizure of a trunk has been
accomplished by sending 2600Hz and
pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one
must first send a KP. This readies the
register for the digits that follow.
For a standard domestic call, the KP
would be followed by either 7 digits
(if the call were in the same NPA as
the seized trunk) or 10 digits (if the
call were not in the same NPA as the
seized trunk). [Exactly like dialing a
normal fone call]. Following either
the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is
sent to signify that no more digits
follow. Example of a complete call:

  1> Dial 1-806-258-1234
  2> wait for a call-progress
     indication (such as ring, busy,
     recording, etc.)
  3> Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.
  4> Wait for about 2 seconds while a
     trunk is seized.
  5> Send KP+305+994+9966+ST

  The call will then connect if every-
thing was done properly. Note that if
a call to an 806 number were being
placed in the same situation, the area
code would be omitted and only KP+
seven digits+ST would be sent.
  Code 11 and code 12 are used in
international calling to request
certain types of operators. KP2 is
used in international calling to route
a call other than by way of the normal
route, whether for economic or 
equipment reasons.
  STp, ST2p, and ST3p (prime, two
prime, and three prime) are used in
TSPS signalling to indicate calling
type of call (such as coin-direct
dialed).

      Better Homes and Blue Boxing
                Part ii
          Practical Applications
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

(It is assumed that the reader has read
and understood Part i of this series).

  The essential purpose of blue boxing
in the beginning was merely to receive
toll services free of charge. Though
this can still be done, blue boxing has
essentially outlived its usefulness in
this area. Modern day "extenders" and
long distance services provide a safer
and easier way to make free fone calls.
However, you can do things with a blue
box that just can't be done with any-
thing else. For ordinary toll-fraud, a
blue box is impractical for the 
following reasons:

  1. Clumsy equipment required (blue
     box or equivalent)
  2. Most boxed calls must be made
     through an extender. Not for
     safety reasons, but for reasons
     I'll explain later.
  3. Connections are often sacrificed
     because considerable distances
     must be dialed to cross a
     seizable trunk, in addition to
     awkward routing.

  As stated in reason #2, boxed calls
are usually made through an extender.
This is for billing reasons. If you
recall from Part i, 2600Hz is used as a
"supervisory" signal. That is, it
signals the status of a trunk--
"on-hook" or "off-hook." When you
seize a trunk (by briefly sending
2600Hz), your end (the CALLING end)
goes on hook for the duration of the
2600Hz and then goes off-hook once
again when the 2600Hz is terminated.
The CALLED end recognizes that a call
is on the way and attaches a register,
which inerprets the digits which are
to be sent. Now, understand that even
though your end has come off-hook
(no 2600Hz present), the other end is
still on-hook. You may wonder then,
why, if the other end (the CALLED end)
is still on-hook, there is no 2600Hz
coming the other way on the trunk,
when there should be. This is correct.
2600Hz *IS* present on the trunk when
you seize it and afterwards, but you
cannot hear it because of a Band
Elimination Filter (BEF) at your
central office.
  Back to the problem. Remember that
when you seize a trunk, 2600Hz is
indeed coming the other way on the
trunk because the CALLED end is still
on-hook, but you don't actually hear
it because of a filter. However, the
Bell equipment knows it's there (they
can "hear" it). The presence of the
2600Hz is telling the billing equip-
ment that your call has not yet been
completed (i.e., the CALLED end is
still on-hook). When finally you do
connect with your boxed call, the
2600Hz from the called end terminates.
This tells the billing equipment that
someone picked up the fone at the
CALLED end and you should begin to be
billed. So you do start to get billed,
but for the call to the trunk, NOT the
boxed call. Your billing equipment
thinks that you've connected with the
number you used to seize the trunk.

Illustration:

  1. You call 1+806-258-2222
     (directly)
  2. Status of trunks:

<----------------------------------->
(You)                    806-258-2222
No 2600Hz-------> <------------2600Hz

  When you seize a trunk (before the
number you called answers) there is
no affect on your billing equipment.
It simply thinks that you're still
waiting for the call to complete
(the CALLED end is still on-hook; it
is ringing, busy, going to recorder
or intercept operator.
  Now, let's say that you've sezied
a trunk (806-258-2222) and for example,
KP+314+949+1705+ST. The call is routed
from the tandem you seized to:
314-949-1705.

Illustration:

<------------------>O<--------------->
(You)              806         314-949
                 tandem  
No 2600Hz----------> <----------2600Hz

  Note that the entire path towards
the right (the CALLED end) has no
2600Hz present and is therefore "off-
hook." The entire path towards the left
(the CALLING end) does have 2600Hz
present on it, indicating that the
CALLED end has not picked up (or come
"off-hook"). When 314-949-1705 answers,
"answer supervision" is given and the
2600Hz towards the left (the CALLING
end) terminates. This tells your
billing equipment, which thinks that
you're still waiting to be connected
with 806-258-2222, that you've
finally connected. Billing then begins
to 806-258-2222. Not exactly an
auspicious beginning for an aspiring
young phone phreak.
  To avoid this, several actions may
be taken. As previously mentioned,
one may avoid being charged for the
number called to seize a trunk by
using an extender (in which case the
extender will get billed). In some
areas, boxing may be accomplished
using an 800 number, generally in the
format of 800-858-xxxx (many Amarillo
numbers) or 800-NN2-xxxx (special
intra-state class in-WATS numbers).
However, boxing off of 800 numbers is
impossible in many areas. In my area,
Denver, I am served by #1A ESS and it
is impossible for me to box off of
any 800 number.
  Years ago, in the early days of blue
boxing (before my time), phreaks often
used directory assistance to box off
of because they were "free" long
distance calls. However, because of
competetive long distance companies,
directory assistance surcharges are
now $0.50 in many areas. It is
additionally advised that directory
assistance numbers not be used to box
from because of the following:
  Average DA calls last under 2
minutes. When you box a call, chances
are that it will last considerably
longer. Thus, the Bell billing equip-
ment will make a note of calls to
directory assistance that last a long
time. A call to a directory assistant
lasting for 4 hours and 17 minutes
may appear somewhat suspicious.
  Although the date, time, and length
of a DA call do not appear on the bill,
it is recorded on AMA tape and will
trip a trouble report if it were to
last too long. This is how most
phreaks were discovered in the old
days. Also, sometimes too many calls
lasting too long to one 800 number
may raise a few eyebrows at the local
security office.
  Assuming you can complete a blue box
call, the following are listed routings
for various Bell internal operators.
These are in the format of KP+NPA+
special routing+1X1+ST, which I will
explain later. The 1X1 is the actual
operator routing, and NPA and NPA+
special routing are used for out-of-
area code calls and out-of-area code
calls requiring special routing,
respectively.

KP+101+ST ...... toll test board
KP+121+ST ...... inward op
KP+131+ST ...... directory assistance
KP+141+ST ...... was rate & route. Now
          only works in 312, 815, 717,
          and a few others. It has
          been replaced with a univer-
          sal rate & route number,
          800+141+1212.
KP+151+ST ...... overseas completion
          operator (inbound). Works
          only in certain NPAs, such as
          303.
KP+181+ST ...... in some areas, toll
          station for small towns

  Thus, if you seize a trunk in 806 NPA
and wanted an inward (in 806), then you
would dial KP+121+ST. If you wanted a
312 inward and were dialing on an 806
trunk, an area code would be required.
Thus, you would dial KP+312+121+ST.
Finally, some places in the network
require special routing, in addition to
an area code. An example is Franklin
Park, Ill. It requires a special
routing of 032. For this, you would
dial KP+312+032+121+ST for a Franklin
Park inward operator.
  Special routings are in the format
of 0XX. They are used primarily for
load balance, so that traffic flow
may be evenly distributed. About half
of the exchanges in the network
require special routing. Note that
special routings are NEVER EVER EVER
used to dial normal telephone numbers,
only operators.

  Operator functions:

TOLL TEST BOARD- Generally a cordboard
position that assists in trunk testing.
They are not used by operators, only
switchmen.

INWARD- Assists the normal TSPS (0+)
operator in completing calls out of
the TSPS's area. Also, inwards perform
emergency inerrupts when the number to
be interrupted is out of the area code
of the original (TSPS) operator. For
example, a 303 operator has a customer
that needs an emergency interrupt on
215-647-6969. The 303 operator gets
the routing for the inward that covers
215-647, since she cannot do the
interrupt herself. The routing is
found to be only 215+ (no special
routing required). So, the 303 operator
keys KP+215+121+ST. An inward answers
and the 303 says to her, "Inward, this
is Denver. I need an emergency
interrupt on 215-647-6969. My
customer's name is Mark Tabas." The
inward will then do the interrupt (off
the line, of course). If the number to
be interrupted had required special
routing, such as, say, 312-456-1234
(spec routing 032), then the 303
operator would dial KP+312+032+121+ST
for the inward to do that interrupt.

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE- These are the
normal NPA+555+1212 operators that
assist customers with obtaining
telefone directory listings. Not much
toll-fraud potential here, except
maybe $0.50.

RATE AND ROUTE- These operators are
reached by dialing KP+800+141+1212+ST.
They assist normal (TSPS) operators
with rates and routings (thus the
name). The only uses I typically have
for them are the following:

1. Routing information. In the above
example, when the 303 operator needed
to dial an inward that served 215-647,
she needed to know if any special
routing was required and, if so, what
it was. Assuming she would use rate
and route, she would dial them and say
nicely, "Operator's route, please, for
215-647." Rate & route would respond
with "215 plus." This means that the
operator would dial KP+215+121+ST to
reach the inward that serves 215-647.
If there were special routing required,
such as in 312-456, rate & route would
respond with "312 plus 032 plus." In
that case, the operator would dial
KP+312+032+ST for the inward that
serves 312-456.
  It is good practice to ask for
"operator's route" specifically, as
there are also "numbers route" and
"directory routes." If you do not
specifically ask for operator's route,
rate & route will generally assume
that is what you want anyway.
  "Numbers" route refers to overseas
calls. Example, you want to know how to
reach a number in Geneva, Switzerland
(and you already have the number). You
would call routing and say "Numbers
route, please, Geneva, Switzerland."
The operator would respond with:
"Mark 41+22. 011+041+ST (plus) 041+22"
The "Mark 41+22" has to do with
billing, so disregard it. The 011+041
is access to the overseas gateway (to
be discussed in Part iii) and the 041+
22+ is the routing for Geneva from the
overseas sender.
  "Directory" routings are for directory assistance overseas. Example:
you want a DA in Rome, Italy. You would
call rate & route and say, "Directory
routing please, for Rome, Italy." They
would respond with "011+039+ST (plus)
039+1108 STart." As in the previous
example, the 011+039 is access to the
overseas gateway. The 039+1108 is a
directory assistant in Rome.

2. Nameplace information. Rate & Route
will give you the location of an NPA+
exchange. Example: "Nameplace please,
for 215-648." The operator would
respond with "Paoli, Pennsylvania."
This isn't especially useful, since you
can get the same information (legally)
by dialing 0, but using rate & route is
often much faster and it avoids having
to hang up when you are already on a
trunk.

*NOTE on Rate & Route: As a blue boxer,
always ask for "IOTC" routings. (e.g.,
"IOTC operator's route", "IOTC numbers
route", etc.) This tells them that you
want cordboard-type routings, not TSPS,
because a blue boxer is actually just a
cordboard position (that Bell doesn't
know about).

OVERSEAS COMPLETION OPERATOR (inbound)-
These operators (KP+151+ST) assist in
the completion of calls coming in to
the United States from overseas. There
are KP+151+ST operators only in a few
NPAs in the country (namely 303). To
use one, you would seize a trunk and
dial KP+303+151+ST. Then you would
tell the operator, for example, "This
is Bangladesh calling. I need U.S.
number 215-561-0562 please." [in a
broken Indian accent]. She would
connect you, and the bill would be
sent to Bangladesh (where I've been
billing my KP+151+ST calls for two
years).

Other internal Bell Operators.

KP+11501+ST ...... universal operator
KP+11511+ST ...... conference op
KP+11521+ST ...... mobile op
KP+11531+ST ...... marine op
KP+11541+ST ...... long distance
                   terminal
KP+11551+ST ...... time & charges op
KP+11561+ST ...... hotel/motel op
KP+11571+ST ...... overseas (outbound)
                   op

  These 115X1 operators are identical
in routing to the 1X1 operators listed
previously, with one exception. If
special routing is required (0XX),
then the trailing 1 is left off.

Examples:

A 312 universal op ... KP+312+11501+ST
A Franklin Park (312-456) universal
op (special routing 032 required)....
................... KP+312+032+1150+ST
[The trailing 1 of 11501 is left off].

Purposes of 115X1 operators.

UNIVERSAL- Used for collect/callback
calls to coin stations.

CONFERENCE- This is a cordboard
conference operator who will set up a
conference for a customer on a manual
operation basis.

MOBILE- Assists in completion of calls
to mobile (IMTS) type telefones

MARINE- Assists in completion of calls
to ocean going vessels.

LONG DISTANCE TERMINAL- Now obsolete.
Was used for completion of long
distance calls.

TIME & CHARGES- Will give exact costs
of calls. Used to time calls and
inform customer of exactly how much
it cost.

HOTEL/MOTEL- Handles calls to/from
hotels and motels.

OVERSEAS COMPLETION (outbound)- assists
in completion of calls to overseas
points. Only works in some, if any
NPAs, because overseas assistance has
been centraized to IOCC (covered in
Part iii).

  Note that all KP+1X1+ST and
KP+115X1+ST operators automatically
assume that you are a TSPS or cordboard
operator assisting a customer with a
call. DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO JEOPARDIZE
THIS! If you do not know what to do,
don't call these operators! Find out
what to do first.

  This concludes Part iii. There is
one final part in which I will explain
overseas dialing, IOCC (International
Overseas Completion Centre), RQS
(Rate/Quote System), and some basic
scanning.

(It is assumed that the reader has read
and$understood parts i & ii before
proceeding to this part).

  In parts i & ii, I covered basic
theory and domestic singalling and
operators. In this part I will explain
overseas direct boxing, the IOCC, the
RQS, and some basic scanning methods.

Overseas Dipect Boxing.

  Calling outside of the United States
and Canada is accomplished by using an
"overseas gateway." There are 7 over-
seas gateways in the Bell System,
and each one is designated to serve a
certain region of the world. To
initiate an overseas call, one must
first access the gateway that the call
is to be sent on. To do this auto-
matically, decide which country you are
calling and find its country code.
Then, pad it to the left with zeros as
required so it is three digits. [Add
1, 2, or 3 zeros as required].

Examples:

Luxembourg (352) is 352 (stays the
                         same)
Spain (34)   becomes 034 (1 zero added)
U.S.S.R. (7) becomes 007 (2 zeros                           added)

  Next, seize a trunk and dial KP+011+
CC+ST. Note that CC is the three digit
padded country code that you just
determined by the above method. [For
Luxembourg, dial KP+011+352+ST, Spain
KP+011+034+ST, and the U.S.S.R. KP+011+
007+ST]. This is done to route you to
the appropriate overseas gateway that
handles the country you are dialing.
Even though every gateway will allow
you to dial every dialable country, it
is good practice to use the gateway
that is designated for the country you
are calling.
  After dialing KP+011+CC+ST (as CC is
defined above) you should"be connected
to an overseas gateway. It will
acknowledge by sending a wink (which
is audible as a <beep><kerchink> and a
dial tone. Once you receive internat-
ional dial tone, you may route your
call one of two ways: a) as an
operator-originated call, or b) as a
customer-originated call. To go as a
operator-originated call, key KP+
country code (NOT padded with zeros)+
city code+number+ST. You will then be
connected, providing the country you
are calling can receive direct-dialed
calls. The U.S.S.R. is an example of
a country that cannot.

Example of a boxed int'l call:

To make a call to the Pope (Rome,
Italy), first obtain the country code,
which is 39. Pad it with zeros so that
it is 039. Seize a trunk and dial
KP+011+039+ST. Wait for sender dial
tone anf then dial KP+39+6+6982+ST.
39 is the country code, 6 is the city
code, and 6982 is the Pope's number in
Rome. To go as an operator-originated
call, simply place a zero in front of
the country code when dialing on the
gateway. Thus, KP+0+39+6+6982+ST woulf
be dialed at sender dial tone. Routing
your call as operator-originated does
not affect much unless you are dialing
an operator in a foreign country
  To dial an operator in a foreign
country, you must first obtain the
operator routing from rate & route for
that country. Dial rate & route and if
you're trying to get an operator in
Yugoslavia, say nicely, "IOTC
Operator's route, please, for
Yugoslavia." [In larger countries it
may be necessary to specify a city].
Rate & route will respond with,
"38 plus 11229". So, dial your over-
seas gateway, KP+011+038+ST, wait for
sender dial tone, and key KP+0+38+
11029+ST. You should then get an
operator in Yugoslavia. Note that you
must prefix the country code on the
sender with a 0 because presumably
only an operator here can dial an
operator in a foreign country.
  When you dial KP+011+CC+ST for an
overseas gateway, it is translated to
a 3-digit sender code of the format
18X, depending on which sender is
designated to handle the country you
are dialing. The overseas$gateways and
their 3-digit codes are listed below.

  182 ..... White Plains, NY
  183 ..... New York, NY
  184 ..... Pittsburg, PA
  185 ..... Orlando, FL
  186 ..... Oakland, CA
  187 ..... Denver, CO
  188 ..... New York, NY

  Dialing KP+182+ST would get you the
sender in White Plains, and KP+183+ST
would get the sender in NYC, etc., but
the KP+011+CC+ST is highly suggested
(as previously mentioned). To find out
what sender you were routed to after
dialing KP+011+CC+ST, dial (at int'l
dial tone): KP+0020000+ST.
  If you have difficulty in reaching
a sender, call rate and route and ask
for a numbers route for the country
you're dialing. Sometimes, KP+011+
padded country code+ST will not work.
I have found this in many 3-digit
country codes. Lexembourg, country
code 352, for example, should be
KP+011+352+ST theoretically. But it
is not. In this case, dial KP+011+
003+ST for the overseas gateway. If
you have trouble, try dialing KP+00+
first digit of country code+ST, or
call rate The IOCC.

  Sometimes when"you call rate and
route and ask for an "IOTC numbers
route" or "IOTC operators route" for
a foreign country, you will get
something like "160+700" (as in the
case of the Soviet Union). This means
that the country is not dialable
directly and must be handled through
the International Overseas Completion
Centre (IOCC). For an IOCC routing,
pad the country code to the RIGHT with
zeros until it is 3 digits. Then KP+160
is dialed, plus the padded country
code, plus ST.

Examples:

The U.S.S.R. (7) ...... KP+160+700+ST
Japan (81) ............ KP+160+810+ST
Uraguay (598) ......... KP+160+598+ST

  You will then be routed to the IOCC
in Pittsburg, PA, who will ask for
country, city, and number being dialed.
Many times they will ask for a ringback
[thanks to Telenet"Bob] so have a loop
ready. They will then place the call
and call you back (or sometimes put
you through directly). Some calls, such
as to Moscow, take several hours.

The Rate Quote System (RQS).

  The RQS is the operator's rate/quote
system. It is a computer used by TSPS
(0+) operators to get rate and route
information without having to dial the
rate and route operator. In Part ii,
I discussed getting an inward routing
for dialing-assistance and emergency
interrupts from the rate and route
operators (KP+800+141+1212+ST). The
same information is available from
RQS. Say you want the inward routing
for 305-994. You would sieze a trunk
and dial KP+009+ST (to access the RQS).
Sometimes, if you seize a trunk in an
NPA not equipped with RQS, you need to
dial an NPA that is equipped with RQS
first, such as 303. Anyway, after you
dial KP+009+ST or KP+303+009+ST, you
will receive a wink (<beep><kerchink>)
and then RQS dial tone. At RQS dial
tone, for an inward routing for 305-994
you would dial KP+06+305+994+ST. That
is, KP+06+NPA+exchange+ST. RQS will
respond with "305 plus 033 plus". This
means you would dial KP+305+033+121+ST
for an inward that services 305-994.
If no special routing were required,
RQS would have responded with "305
plus" and you would simply dian:
KP+305+121+ST for an inward.
  Another RQS feature is the echo
feature. You can use it to test your
blue box. Dial RQS (KP+009+ST) and
then key KP+07+1234567890+ST. RQS will
respond with voice identification of
the digits it recognized, between the
KP+07 and ST.
  RQS can also be used for rates and
directory routings, but those are
seldom needed, so they have been
omitted here.

Simple Scanning.

  If you're interested in scanning,
try dialing on a trunk, routings in the
format of KP+11XX1+ST. Begin with"11001
and scan to 11991. There are lots of
interesting things to be found there,
as Doctor Who (413 area) can tell you.
Those 11XX1 routings can also be
prefixed with an NPA, so if you want
to scan area code 212, dial KP+212+
11XX1+ST.

  There, now you know as much about
blue boxing as most phreaks. If you
read and understand the material, and
put aside preconceived ideas of what
blue boxing is that you may have
aquired from inexperienced people or
other bulletin boards, you should be
well on you way to an enlightening
career in blue boxing. If you follow
the guidelines in Part i to box, you
should have no problem with the fone
company. Comments made by "phreaks" on
bulletin boards that proclaim "tracing"
of blue boxers are nonsense and should
be ignored (except for a passing
chuckle).

NOTE 1: CCIS and the downfall of blue
         boxing.

CCIS stands for Common Channel Inter-
office Signalling. It is a signalling
method used between electronic
switching systems that eminiates the
use of 2600Hz and 3700Hz"supervisory
signals, and MF pulsing. This is why
many places cannot be boxed off of;
they employ CCIS, or out-of-band
signalling, which will not respond to
any tones that you generate on the
line. Eventually, all existing toll
equipment will be upgraded or replaced
with CCIS or T-carrier. In this case,
we'll all be boxing with microwave
dishes. Until then (about 1995 by
current BOC/AT&T estimates), have fun!

First of all I named this the Magenta Box because all of the

afford a fucking piece of shit Radio Shack 2-line phone with

Whew!  Well, the schematic explains almost everything.  It would be
helpful to you if you used one color for the line #1 clips and another
for the line #2 clips.  It will work even if you get the ring and tip
mixed up, but you must get all of the clips on the right line.  But,
to be safe, you could put tags on each clip labeling it RING #1, TIP #2,
ect.

Installation.  Find one of those green posts that are about 3 feet high.
They are everywhere.  Get a socket wrench to open it up.  There will
be (a) row(s) of paired up posts.  Each pair of posts represents a line.
YOU *MUST* KNOW THE NUMBER OF LINE #1.  Sometimes the number is tagged
on to the pair of wires leading up to the posts, if so pick these posts
as your line #1.  Then you can pick any other set of posts for line #2.

Now to the good part.  Use of the the final product.  When you call up
line one from your house you will get a dial tone almost immediately.
Using DTMF you can dial anywhere that the person who owns line 2 has
service to.  Which means you can direct dial alliance, Australia, and
your favorite BBS for FREE.

The Telco. will undoubtably discover the device after 2 days, so post
the number on your favorite boards so you can abuse it while it is in
service.  With a 2000 uF capacitor and a 1 meg resistor you will
get a 50 minute call before it disconnects you.  By lowering the value
of the resistor and capacitor you can change the time to your taste.
So don't dial a wrong number, because you will have to wait 50 minutes
until it resets again.  The formula for the time is the following:

2*R1    C1              C1 is in microfarads
---- * ----             R1 is in Kohms
100     10              See schematic for location of R1 and C1.
-----------  = Minutes
    60

The time produced by this formula is only approximate.

Well, that is one of the more complicated boxes to build.  But it
is very useful and will pay for itself with its first use.   It
would be wise to remove it before the Telco. finds it so you won't
have to make another, or install it on a line that belongs to a
family that is on vacation (GOOD IDEA)

Well, there it is.  I hope it saves you a lot of cash.


I, Street Fighter, designed this box
for the sole purpose of fucking over
Ma Bell.  It is not for imformational
purposes, but to be used to cost the
TelCo. thousands of dollars.

If you wish to have one built for you.  Leave me E-mail on the Iron Curtain
or the CornerStone or any other board I frequent.  It won't be more than $15,
hopefully it will only be about $8.

DON'T LET PHREAKING DIE!

Introduction
============
 
The Lunch Box is a VERY simple transmitter which can be handy for all sorts of
things. It is quite small and can easily be put in a number of places. I have
successfully used it for tapping fones, getting inside info, blackmail and
other such things. The possibilities are endless. I will also include the plans
for an equally small receiver for your newly made toy. Use it for just about
anything. You can also make the transmitter and receiver together in one box
and use it as a walkie talkie.
 
Materials you will need
=======================
 
(1) 9 volt battery with battery clip
(1) 25-mfd, 15 volt electrolytic capacitor
(2) .0047 mfd capacitors
(1) .022 mfd capacitor
(1) 51 pf capacitor
(1) 365 pf variable capacitor

Notes about the schematic
=========================
 
1.  GND means ground
2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
    connected.
3.  Where you see:  )(
                    ()
                    )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                       regular hook-up wire around it.
4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should run
    a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a .0047
    capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to broadcast
    approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
    broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for an
    antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
    line for about a 250 foot antenna!)
 
Operation of the Lunch Box
==========================
 
This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot. to  ï 7   3                     adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch on
the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is adjusted,
turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a friend
say some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it. The
plans for a simple receiver are shown below:
 
The Lunch Box receiver
======================
 
(1) 9 volt battery with battery clip
(1) 365 pf variable capacitor
(1) 51 pf capacitor
(1) 1N38B diode
(1) Transistor antenna coil

Closing statement
=================
 
This two devices can be built for under a total of $10.00. Not too bad. Using
these devices in illegal ways is your option. If you get caught, I accept NO
responsibility for your actions. This can be a lot of fun if used correctly.
Hook it up to the red wire (I think) on the fone line and it will send the
conversation over the air waves. If you have any problems or are confused,
leave me mail on:Hi-Times=702/832/7469  Warez House=702/827/9273

==============

aqua  box  -  A  box  designed to drain the voltage of the FBI lock-in-
 trace/trap-trace  so  you  can  hang  up  your  fone  in  an  emergency  and
 phrustrate  the  Pheds  some more. The apparatus is simple, just connect the
 two  middle wires of a phone wire and plug, which would be the red and green
 wires  if  in  the jack, to the cord of some electrical appliance; ie, light
 bulb  or  radio.  KEEP  THE  APPLIANCE  OFF.  Then,  get  one  of those line
 splitters  that  will  let  you hook two phone plugs into one jack. Plug the
 end  of  the  modified  cord into one jack and your fone into the other. THE
 APPLIANCE  MUST  BE  OFF! Then, when the Pheds turn their lame tracer on and
 you  find  that  you  can't hang up, remove your fone from the jack and turn
 the  appliance ON and keep it ON until you feel safe; it may be awhile. Then
 turn  it  off,  plug  your fone back in, and start phreaking again. Invented
 by: Captain Xerox and The Traveler.
 

      black  box  -  The infamous box that allows the calling party to not be
 billed  for  the call placed. We won't go in depth right now, most plans can
 be  found on many phreak oriented BBS's. The telco can detect black boxes if
 they suspect one on the line. Also, these will not work under ESS.
 
      bleeper  boxes  -  The  United  Kingdom's  own version of the blue box, 
 modified  to  work  with the UK's fone system. Based on the same principles. 
 However, they use two sets of frequencies, foreword and backwards.
 
      Blotto  box  -  This  box  supposedly  shorts  every  fone  out  in the 
 immediate  area,  and  I  don't  doubt  it. It should kill every fone in the 
 immediate  area,  until  the  voltage reaches the fone company, and the fone 
 company  filters  it.  I  won't  cover  this  one  in  this issue, cuz it is 
 dangerous,  and  phreaks shouldn't destroy MA's equipment, just phuck it up. 
 Look  for  this  on your phavorite BBS or ask your phavorite phreak for info 
 if you really are serious about seriously phucking some fones in some area.
 
      blue  box  -  An  old  piece of equipment that emulated a true operator 
 placing  calls,  and  operators  get  calls for free. The blue box seizes an 
 open  trunk  by  blasting  a  2600  Hz tone through the line after dialing a 
 party  that  is  local  or in the 800 NPA so calls will be local or free for 
 the  blue boxer. Then, when the blue boxer has seized a trunk, the boxer may 
 then,  within the next 10-15 seconds, dial another fone number via MF tones. 
 These  MF  tones  must be preceded by a KP tone and followed with a ST tone. 
 All of these tones are standardized by Bell. The tones as well as the inter-
 digit  intervals  are around 75ms. It may vary with the equipment used since 
 ESS  can  handle higher speeds and doesn't need inter-digit intervals. There 
 are  many  uses to a blue box, and we will not cover any more here. See your 
 local  phreak or phreak oriented BBS for in depth info concerning blue boxes 
 and  blue  boxing.  Incidentally, blue boxes are not considered safe anymore 
 because  ESS  detects  "foreign"  tones,  such as the 2600 Hz tone, but this 
 detection  may  be  delayed  by  mixing pink noise of above 3000 Hz with the 
 2600  Hz  tone. To hang up, the 2600 Hz tone is played again. Also, all blue 
 boxes  are  green  boxes because MF "2" corresponds to the Coin Collect tone 
 on  the  green box, and the "KP" tone corresponds to the Coin Return tone on 
 the  green  box.  See  green  box  for  more  information.  Blue  boxing  is 
 IMPOSSIBLE  under  the new CCIS system slowly being integrated into the Bell 
 system.
 
      blue  box  tones  -  The MF tones generated by the blue box in order to 
 place  calls,  emulating  a  true operator. These dual tones must be entered 
 during  the  10-15 second period after you have seized a trunk with the 2600 
 Hz tone.

      busy  box  - Box that will cause the fone to be busy, without taking it
 OFF-HOOK.  Just  get a piece of fone wire with a plug on the end, cut it off
 so  there  is a plug and about two inches of fone line. Then, strip the wire
 so  the  two middle wires, the tip and the ring, are exposed. Then, wrap the
 ring  and  the  tip  together,  tape with electrical tape, and plug into the
 fone jack. The fone will be busy until the box is removed.
 
      cans  -  Cans  are  those  big  silver  boxes  on  top of or around the 
 telephone  poles. When opened, the lines can be manipulated with a beige box 
 or whatever phun you have in mind.
 
      cheese  box  -  Another  type  of  box  which,  when  coupled with call
 forwarding  services, will allow one to place free fone calls. The safety of
 this  box  is unknown. See references for information concerning text philes
 on this box.
 
      clear  box  - Piece of equipment that compromises of a telephone pickup 
 coil  and  a  small  amp. This works on the principal that all receivers are 
 also  weak  transmitters.  So,  you amplify your signal on PP fortress fones 
 and spare yourself some change.
 
      green  box - Equipment that will emulate the Coin Collect, Coin Return,
 and  Ringback  tones.  This  means  that if you call someone with a fortress
 fone  and  they  have  a  green  box,  by  activating it, your money will be
 returned.   The   tones   are,   in   hertz,   Coin  Collect=700+1100,  Coin
 Return=1100+1700,  and  Ringback=700+1700.  However,  before these tones are
 sent,  the  MF  detectors  at  the  CO  must be alerted, this can be done by
 sending  a  900+1500  Hz  or  single 2600 Hz wink of 90ms followed by a 60ms
 gap, and then the appropriate signal for at least 900ms.
 
      gold  box  -  This  box  will  trace  calls,  tell if the call is being 
 traced, and can change a trace. 
 
      grey box - Also known as a silver box. See silver box.
 

      Paper  Clip  Method  -  This method of phreaking was illustrated in the
 movie  War Games. What a phortress fone does to make sure money is in a fone
 is  send  an  electrical  pulse  to  notify  the  fone  that a coin has been
 deposited,  for  the  first  coin  only.  However,  by  simply grounding the
 positive  end  of  the microphone, enough current and voltage is deferred to
 the  ground  to  simulate  the first quarter in the coin box. An easy way to
 accomplish  this is to connect the center of the mouthpiece to the coin box,
 touch  tone  pad,  or anything that looks like metal with a piece of wire. A
 most  convenient  piece  of wire is a bend out of a paper clip. Then you can
 send  red  box  tones  through the line and get free fone calls! Also, telco
 modified  fones  may  require  you  to  push  the  clip  harder  against the
 mouthpiece,  or  connect  the mouthpiece to the earpiece. If pressing harder
 against the mouthpiece becomes a problem, pins may be an easier solution.
 
      purple  box  -  This one would be nice. Free calls to anywhere via blue
 boxing,  become  an  operator  via  blue box, conference calling, disconnect
 fone  line(s),  tap  fones,  detect  traces,  intercept directory assistance
 calls. Has all red box tones. This one may not be available under ESS.
 
      rainbow  box  -  An  ultimate  box. You can become an operator. You get 
 free  calls,  blue  box. You can set up conference calls. You can forcefully 
 disconnect  lines.  You can tap lines. You can detect traces, change traces, 
 and  trace as well. All incoming calls are free. You can intercept directory 
 assistance.  You have a generator for all MF tones. You can mute and redial. 
 You  have  all  the  red-box tones. This is an awesome box. However, it does 
 not exist under ESS.
 
      red  box  -  Equipment that will emulate the red box tone generated for
 coin recognition in all phortress fones.
 
      red  box  tones - Tones that tell the phortress fone how much money was 
 inserted  in  the  fone  to make the required call. In one slot fones, these 
 are  beeps in pulses; the pulse is a 2200+1700 Hz tone. For quarters, 5 beep 
 tones  at 12-17 PPS, for dimes it is 2 beep tones at 5-8.5 PPS, and a nickel 
 causes  1  beep  tone  at  5-8.5  PPS.  For  three slot fones, the tones are 
 different.  Instead of beeps, they are straight dual tones. For a nickel, it 
 is  one  bell  at 1050-1100 Hz, two bells for a dime, and one gong at 800 Hz 
 for  a  quarter.  When  using  red  box  tones, you must insert at least one 
 nickel  before playing the tones, cuz a ground test takes place to make sure 
 some  money  has  been  inserted. The ground test may be fooled by the Paper 
 Clip  Method.  Also,  it has been known that TSPS can detect certain red box 
 tones, and will record all data on AMA or CAMA of fraudulent activity.
 
      regional center - Any class 1 switching office in North America.
 
      silver  box  -  Equipment that will allow you to emulate the DTMF tones
 A,B,C,D.  The  MF  tones  are, in hertz, A=697+1633, B=770+1633, C=852+1633,
 D=941+1633.  These  allow  special functions from regular fones, such as ACD
 Testing Mode.

     The XR-2207 chip is a Voltage-Contr olled Oscillator and a 14 
pin device thu s you must be very careful when soldering
 the parts  to  this  device. It is a little dificult to actually  draw a 
schematic on a 80 character scren using limited gra phics but will 
give it a try.

     This is a diagram of how to locate the different pins on the chip please
no tice that pin one is the closest to the n otch on top  of the chip.  The
first thing we'll do is to connect power to the chip  (remember that  you
need to build two of these to get a complete system) this is accomplished by
connecting the positive wire of the battery lead to pin 1 one leg of R1 and R2
is solder to pin 11 the other leg of R1 goes to pin 1 or to the  positive of 
the battery. The other leg of R2 goes to ground, C1 goes between pin 10
and ground. 
   The timing capacitor or C2 goes between  pins 2 and 3 of the chip
pins 8 and 9 should be grounded to ground. Pin 14 is the output 
and this is where one leg of C4 (C3 goes on the other VCO) in series with
R3(the same goes for the other VCO) and to one lead of the speaker.
 

     The trimmer pots P1 to P10 should be grouped in groups of  5  pots  each
.   the way you group it is by soldering one end of the pot to each other
leaving the wiper and the other end free.
 
                   | This end goes to pin 6 of the chip
                   |

MA BELL IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH STANDARDS! JUST ABOUT EVERY MANUFACTURER OF
IC'S THAT GENERATE TOUCH TONES HAS ALSO GONE BY THE 16 KEY (8 TONE) STANDARD
FOR TOUCH TONE PADS. AND IT IS EVEN EASIER TO CONVERT A TONE PAD THAT USES AN
INTEGRATED CIRCUIT TO GENERATE THE TONES THAN CONVERTING A MA BELL PAD!

IT WILL HELP IMMENSELY IF YOU HAVE THE SCHEMATIC FOR THE PAD IN QUESTION, OR
AT LEAST THE PIN-OUT DIAGRAM OF THE CHIP BEING USED. PIN-OUTS CAN USUALLY BE
OBTAINED FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR FROM AN ECG, SK, GE OR SIMILIAR
SEMICONDUCTER HANDBOOK (PROVIDED THAT MANUFACTURER MAKES AN EQUIVALENT FOR
THE CHIP IN YOUR PAD). I'LL USE THE RADIO SHACK CEX-4000 TONE PAD MODULE FOR
AN EXAMPLE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS PROBABLY ALMOST THE LOUSIEST ONE YOU CAN BUY,
IT IS FAIRLY TYPICAL ASILY AVAILABLE.

TAKE A LOOK AT THE DIAGRAM OR THE PIN-OUT OF THE CHIP. YOU SHOULD SEE TWO
GROUPS OF PINS, THE ROWS TONE PINS AND THE COLUMN TONE PINS. THESE WILL BE
MARKED AS R1,R2,R3,R4 AND C1,C2,C3 (RADIO SHACK) OR OR X1,X2,X3 AND Y1,Y2,Y3
ETC. ON OTHERS. AT ANY RATEU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH WHICH THREE
PINS CONTROL THE COLUMNS AND WHICH FOUR CONTROL THE ROWS. IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
EACH GROUP OF ROWS AND COLUMNS WILL BE CONTIGUOUS. NOW LOOK AT THE COLUMN
PINS, AND YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE AN EMPTY PIN RIGHT NEXT TO THEM. THIS IS THE
COLUMN PIN FTHE 1633 HZ TONES. THESE CHIPS USUALLY ACHIEVE THEIR SWITCHING BY
CONNECTING A ROW PIN WITH A COLUMN PIN (THAT WAY TQAN USE A0VERY SIMPLE
KEYBOARD PAD, UNLIKE MA BELL'S COMPLICATED ONE). SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE
A SPDT SWITCH AND A FEW PIECES OF WIRE, CUT THE TRACE GOING TO THE COLUMN 3
PIN OF THE CHIP, ATTACH A WIRE FROM THE CHIP SIDEOF THAT CUT TO ONE END OF THE
SPDT SWITCH, A WIRE FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CUT TO THE CENTER OF THE SPDT
SWITCH, AND FINALLY, FROM THE REMAINING CONTACT ON THE SPDT SWITCH, HOOK A
WIRE TO THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED PIN C4 (COLUMN 4). NOW YOU HAVE A "BANK
SWITCHING ARRANGEMENT EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS BULLETIN
FOR MODIFYING A MA BELL PAD.

IF YOU CAN'T GET THE SCHEMATICS OR THE PIN OUTS FOR YOUR CHIP, DON'T DESPAIR.
THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR YOU! YOU JUST HAVE TO TRACK THE CONNECTIONS GOING FROM
THE PAD'S KEYS TO THE CHIP. CHANCES ARE YOU'LL FIND THAT EACH ROW HAS A COMMON
TRACE, AND SO DOES EACH COLUMN (FOR THOSE NON-TECHNICAL FOLKS, A TRACE IS A
CONNECTION ETCHED OUT ON A CIRCUIT BOARD). JUST FOLLOW THESE TO THE CHIP, AND
MAKE YOUR OWN SCHEMATIC UP. NOW TAKE A LOOK FOR THAT EXTRA PIN--THERE SHOULD
BE ONE FLOATING AROUND RIGHT NEXT TO THE COLUMN PINS. IT WILL BE NOT BE HOOKED
UP TO ANYTHING ELSE, THAT IS, "HANGING FREE". DRILL A HOLE IN THE SIDE OF

      This stuff from IRON MAN -- formatted 80 columns
 In answer to all those who don't know what an infinity transmitter is, here
is A little history: A guy by the name Manny Mittleman ran a company called
the wireless guitar company located on Liberty St. In NY. Aide from wireless
guitars, Manny also built all sorts of electronic wireless bugs.  One item,
The infinity transmitter was a device that was placed inside an unsuspecting
persons telephone. When the phone number of that telephone was dialed and a
certain note was blown into the phone from a hohner, keyof-c, harmonica, the
bugged phone did not ring, and what's more, enabled the caller to then hear
everything said in the room that the phone was located in. As long as the
caller wanted to stay on the phone, all was open to him or he.  If the phone
was lifted off the hook, the transmitter was disconected and the "bugged" party
received a dial tone as if nothing was wrong with the line. Remember, all this 
was constructed in the 1960's when ic's were not as common place as they are
today.  Also bear in mind that during that period in time, even the telephone
company was no quite sure on how well or how portable tone decoding was.
Ps.  Many government agency's were some of Manny's best customers.

   The Green Box generates useful tonessuch as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, and
RINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to
the CO when appropriate.  Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a
fortress station, but must be used by the CALLED party.  The tones (hz) are:
 
   COIN COLLECT      700  +  1100
   COIN RETURN      1100  +  1700
   RINGBACK          700  +  1700
 
   Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator released
signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.  This can be done
by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followed by a 60 ms
gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.  Also, do not forget
that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3 minute period is up.

THE 1.4K RESISTOR IS VERIABLE AND IF THE SECCOND PAR OF THE GOLD BOX IS SKIPPE
D IT WILL STILL WORK BUT WHEN SOMEONE PICKS THE PHONE UP THEY WILL HEAR AFAIN
T DIAL TONE IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIGHT  REPORT IT TO THE GESTOPO ER...(AT&T).
1.4K WILL GIVE YOU GOOD RECEPTION WITH LITTLE RISK OF A GESTOPO AGENT A YOUR
DOOR.


   NOW THAT YOU HAVE BUILT IT TAKE TWO GREEN WIRES OF THE SAME LENTH STRIP THE
ENDS, TWIST TWO ENDS TOGETHER AND CONNECT THEM TO GREEN1 AND PLACE A PEICE OF
TAPE ON IT WITH LINE #1 WRITING ON IT.  CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH RED1 ONLY US
RED WIRE. REPEAT WITH RED2 AND GREEN2 BUT CHANGE TO LINE #2.





                            HOW TO INSTALL
                            ______________

   YOU WILL NEED TO FIND TWO PHONE LINES THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. LABEL ONE OF
THE PHONES LINES LINE #1.  CUT THE PHONE LINES AND TAKE THE OUTER COATING OFF
IT. THERE SHOULD BE 4 WIRES CUT THE YELLOW AND BLACK WIRES OFF AND STRIP THE
RED AND GREEN WIES FOR BOTH LINES.

   LINE #1 SHOULD BE IN TWO PEICES TAKE THE GREEN WIRE OF ONE END AND CONNECT
IT TO THE ONE OF THE GREEN WIRES ON THE GOLD BOX. TAKETHE OTHER HALF OF LINE #
1 AND HOOK THE FREE GREEN WIRE TO THE GREEN WIRE ON THE PHONE LINE. REPEAT HE
 PROCESS WITH RED1 AND THE OTHER LINE.

   ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS TO RIGHT DOWN THE PHONE NUMBERS OF THE PLACE YOU
HOOKED IT UP AT AND GO HOME AND CALL IT . YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE!!!

HOOKUP: TO HOOK UP THE BOX, PLUG YOUR
FONES INTO THE JACKS ON THE BOX. ON 
MINE, THE WIRES ARE LABELED EVERY FOOT
SO THAT I KNOW WHICH TRUNK I'M ON. CLIP
THE APPROPRIATE SET OF CLIPS ON THE
TERMINALS YOU WISH TO INVADE, AND THEN
LISTEN/DIAL THROUGH WHICHEVER PHONE IS
CONNECTED. THIS BOX HAS TWO LINES GOING
THROUGH IT, WITH AN OPTION TO CONFER-
ENCE THE TWO. I ADDED THIS SO IF WHILE
ON ALLIANCE TELECONFERENCING, YOU WANT
TO DIAL AN 800,900,700, OR 976 NUMBER,
YOU CAN SIMPLY DIAL IT WITH THE OTHER
TRUNK AND THEN CONFERENCE THE TWO.

CONFERENCING THE TWO LINES: TO JOIN THE
TWO LINES, TURN BOTH OF THE TOGGLE
SWITCHES TO THE ON POSITION.

NOTE: MAKE SURE THAT NO PHONE IS
CONNECTED TO THE BOX WHEN YOU HOOK UP
THE CLIPS, AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH
SWITCHES ARE TURNED OFF.

-> Author's note:

   Yes, yes, I know that this box is similar to several other boxes, including
the so-called "Bud box," and the "beige box." Well, my reason for writing this
version is because of the fact that once finished constructing the box, the
file does not contain very much information on usage. It is because of that
reason that this file was written. By the way, call Ground 0 at 988-4426.
Thank you.

-> What is the function of a Day-Glo box?

   Well, a Day-glo box will let you place calls for free with no time limit,
no possibility of a wiretap, and the calls can be placed from anywhere in the
world. Too good to be true, you say? Well, read on.

-> How does a Day-glo box work?

   A day-glo box is very easy to make, and very inexpensive to build. It works
like this: On the outside of every home that has a phone, there is something
called "the outside connection box," which is where the house is connected to
Ma Bell's network. This ingenious device connects to a) your phone, b) the
victim's outside box. You should be starting to get the idea.

-> How do I construct a day-glo box?

   Materials necessary: 1. Radio Shack modular conversion jack
2. A small experimenter's box (optional)
3. 1 foot of red wire. (better to overkill)
4. 1 foot of green wire. (same as above)
5. 2 medium alligator clips

   Well, in order to construct this box, you will need all of the above
materials. Note that your wire does not necessarily have to be red or green,
but it is necessary that you be able to tell them apart. Also, you might want
to use thick, easily bent wire (audio hookup wire works best) instead of bell
wire. Now, on to the construction.

   1. Remove the actual modular jack from the conversion box. This can be done
by pushing inward and then up, or you can just cut the plastic.

   2. Remove the black and yellow wires from the jack. You can either clip
these or rip them out.

   3. To your newly isolated jack, add the 1 foot wire extensions to the
respective wires. Soldering and then wrapping the connections with
electrical tape works best.

   4. Next, solder the alligator clips to the extended wires. If you do not
wish to solder them, then just wrap the clips with the wire.

   5. Now, place this newly made contraption into a box (optional). You may
need to drill a few holes, and possibly remove the alligator clips, but
you should have read this file first, anyway.

-> Wiring Diagram

  Modular--------------Red-----+----Extension wire---------< Alligator
   Jack  --------------Green---+----Extension wire---------< Clips

   Pretty easy, eh?

-> Usage of the day-glo box

   The day-glo box will work with any phone. First, you need to locate a house
that has a phone. Next, (it's preferable to do this at night) go up to the
and locate the outside connection box. Pop the cover off. Locate prong 3 and
prong 4. You will attach the green wire clip to prong 3. The red wire clip
will go to prong 4. Now, plug your phone (preferably a trimline or ranger) into
your modular plug. You may now either listen in on the call (wire tap) OR you
may call out to anywhere in the world. If you are really daring, you can bring
your computer with you. Note: This box may also be used in conjunction with
the lunch box in order to make a perfect phone bug.

-> Other neat things you can do with your new box:

   1: Call 976 numbers. This should be done very frequently. Also, I find that
after finding the victim's outside box, several calls to the gay hotline
will have interesting after-effects. Namely, his parents wondering about
him.

   2: Alliance teleconferencing can be accomplished quite easily. Try it!
Call 0-700-456-1000. Or, tell the operator you'd like to initiate a
conference.

   3: Of course, you should place several calls to other countries. This can
be accomplished by looking in the front of your white pages for the
various country and city codes. You should be able to follow the
directions provided in there.

-> Using your box at apartments/community connection boxes:

   Have you ever wondered what those 6ft tall cabinets with the bell logo on
them were for? Well, if you've never seen them, here's a quick description:
They are 6ft tall by 3ft wide, and painted the dull phone company green.
They can be opened quite easily with a 7/16ths inch socket wrench. After
turning the bold over the handle, turn the handle to the right and pull. It
should open, displaying over 100 different lines. Occasionally, you can find
tech. manuals and test kits inside. They are usually located near phone lines.
Okay, now, once you have opened one of these calling cabinets, locate the
line of your choice. You will have to take out both the orange and the white
insulated screws. The purple and white wires should come off along with the
screws. The lines go out to the house, and the screw posts are the actual line.
Now, you should clip the alligators to the posts, with one part of the clip
on the insulation, and on.]Now, you should clip the alligators to the nep
parteli. Oh, if you want the home to remain connected, clip the wires inside
the hole using the alligator clips. By the way, the red terminal on your box
goes to the orange post, and the green one to the white post... if that doesn't
work, reverse the connection. Now, to find out the number you have taken over,
dial 380-55555555. Yes, that's eight fives. A computer voice should tell you
what number you are on. heh. I hope you can take it from here. Oh, in
apartments, you can find the calling cabinet in the basement... remember, this
is not your line, so do anything you want. Call the President or something.

Disclaimer (I know...):
  This file is for informational purposes only.  No use of this technique
is recommended for one of many reasons: 1) It makes other Phreaks & hacks
very upset, 2) It makes the Telco VERY upset, and you could be put away for
a LONG time if you dont know what youre doing.  Telco employees could learn
something from the Copper Box. Well, anyway, off we go....

Purpose:
  This box can destroy a phone company, no matter how big.  You could bring
AT&T down to their knees!  Only to be used by the most irate of Phracks,
it is intended for informational purposes only.

History:
  This is really not a Box, but if you consider a Cheese Box a Box, then it
is.  It was first concieved back in 1986 when a Phriend and I came up with
the idea while using a Copper-coloured fone, hence, a Copper Box.

Instructions:
  You must obtain [1] extender, or phone company port, like an MCI or SPRINT
access number.  [2] A hell of a lot of nerve, and vendetta towards the phone
company (phriend gets busted, rates increase, etc.) [3] a computer & modem
capable of autodialing [tone.]

  Dial the number of the L/D service, then enter the code.  Dial the number of
the service again, through the outdial number you are still on, enter code,
then dial again and again.  You should hear, after a while (it will take a
long time for BIG companies) a slight high-pitched, unstable tone, that grows
louder and louder w/every dial.  Once it gets so loud that it refuses to let
in any more sounds, you have just completed the first cycle of the Copper Box.
  Leave line off-hook for about 10 minutes or until the tone seems to calm
down, or stop completely.  Then, dial again and repeat over and over again
until when you dial a last time, it [the port] doesnt answer.  You have just
killed a telephone company, extender, etc.

Theory of Operation:
  What happens is that when the tone begins to rise, it is a result of cross-
talk feedback.  The more you dial,  the more it grows.  In systems like these,
the small, sensitive equipment such as amplifiers, etc. begin to burn out as
a result of the feedback, damaging the equipment, and possibly starting a fire

   The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be used
throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on "PostPay" 
payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that dont require payment
until after the connection is established. You pick up the fone, get
a dial tone, dial your number, and then insert your money after the person
answers.If you dont deposit the money then you can not speak to the person on
the other end- because your mouth peice is cut off, but, not the ear piece.
(obviously these phones are nice for free calls to weather or time or
other such recordings).All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio Shack, or
electronics store,and get a four-transistor amplifier and a
telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be
hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation, except that it
would be plugged into the out-
put of the amplifier and a microphone would be hooked to the input. So when 
the party that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the
little microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out
the induction coil, and into the back of the reciever where it would then be 
broadcast through the phone lines and the other party would be able to hear 
the caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not being heard.
Luckily, the line will not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because
it will wait forever for the coins to be put in.The biggest advantage for all
of us about this new clear box is the 
fact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common.
Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,dial-tone-first
service, 2nd, it doesnt require any special equipment, (for the phone
company)This payphone will work on any phone line. Ususally a payphone line is
different, but this is a regular phone line and it is set up so the phone
does all the charging, not the company.
                             CLEAR BOXING

The idea for the Clear box comes from an article in the newsletter 2600.


The clear box works on 'post pay' coin phones, pay phones that require money
only after the connection has been made. The way this works is:  After the
connection is made the mouthpiece of the phone is muted but not the earpiece,
free calls to dial-it services can be made with these phones.

   In order to talk to the person you called without paying (NOTE:  It is
against the law to do this!!)  Take yourself down to your nearby electronics
store and get a four transistor amplifier and a telephone suction cup inductive
pick-up.  Put the pick-up on the earpiece and plug it into the output of the
amplifier, and plug a microphone into the input. You then talk into your
microphone and listen normally through the earpiece.

   Radio Shack sells an item that wont need much modification,and that
should work the same as the above construction.  It is their 'Portable snap-on
handset amplifier' (Part # 43-238) Their description says to put it on the
earpiece and it will boost the callers voice to five times the normal level.
In order to make this function like a clear box one would have to take the
amplifier apart and remove the internal speaker, in it's place, connect the
suction cup inductive pickup.  Place the pick-up (which is now the speaker)
to the earpiece of the payphone, and talk into the microphone of the amplifer.

  The line will not cut off, and will wait forever for you to put the coins in.
  Note also that these types of payphones are not connected to the TSPS in
the same way as normal payphones.  The phone does all the charging and not
the Central Office.  It is because of this, that a phone connected to the
lines BEFORE the payphone would act just like a normal phone. So get out
your smallest phone, cut off the jack and strip the wires. connect the wires to
two alligator clips. Then you can clip onto the payphone's wires BEFORE they
connect to the payphone, you then have a normal telephone line that you dont
pay the bills on!

  Emergency vehicles in many cities are now using devices called OptoComs.
OptoComs are a system of sensors on traffic lights that detect a pattern
of flashes from vehicle-mounted strobe lights.

  This flash pattern varies from city to city depending on the manufacturer
of the equipment used.  Often the sensors are installed only at major
intersections.  Nevertheless, the Chrome Box, which simulates these strobe
patterns can often be used to give your car the same priority as an
ambulance, paramedic van, firetruck or police car.

  Because of the varying patterns on different systems this phile will
outline a general procedure for making the Chrome Box.

Decoding Flash Patterns:

 First, you need to observe an emergency vehicle in action.  You can wait
until you encounter one by chance, running out to see when you hear a siren,
or when you pull over in your car to let one pass by. You might wait
near a fire station for the next emergency to occur.  Or, if you are very
impatient, you can summon one by calling in a false alarm (not recommended in
areas with limited services - that could divert attention from a real
emergency).  If the OptoComs in your area are the kind with a pattern of single
flashes at a steady rhythm, you have merely to buy a strobe light at Radio Shack
& adjust the flash rate until you can induce a traffic light to change.

 If the flash pattern is more complex, you can videotape the emergency vehicle &
then play back the tape in single-frame mode, counting the number of frames
between each flash. Each video frame is 1/30 of a second, using this you can
calculate the time between flashes in the pattern.  Another way is to count the
number of flashes (or flash-groups) in one minute and use that to compute the
rate. Counting video frames will give you a good idea of the spacing of the
flashes in a complex pattern.  For really accurate information, call the fire
station & ask them, or write to the manufacturer for a service manual, which
will include a schematic diagram that you can use to build one. A good cover
story for this is that you are a consultant & one of your clients asked you to
evaluate Optocom systems, or you could pose as a free-lance journalist writing
an article.

Modifying the Strobe Light:

 You may not have to modify the strobe at all. But if you need a faster
flash rate than your strobe allows, open it up & find the large capacitor
inside. Capacitors are marked in microfarads, abbreviated as mf,mfd or ufd.
By replacing the capacitor with one of the same voltage-rating (usually
250 volts or more) and a SMALLER value in microfarads, you can increase the
flash rate. Halving the microfarads doubles the rate.
 The other component that can be changed is the potentiometer (the speed
control device with the knob on it). Using a smaller value (measured in
ohms or Kilohms, abbrevaited with the greek letter 'omega' or the letter K)
will speed up the strobe. There may also be a resistor (small cylinder with
several colored stripes on it, and wires coming out of each end). Replacing
this resistor with one of smaller value will also speed up the strobe.

 To generate a complex pattern, you will either have to design and build a
triggering circuit using IC chips, or rig up a mechanical device with a
multiple-contact rotary switch and a motor.  It HAS been done.

 To modify the strobe for mobile operation the simplest thing is to get a
110-volt inverter that will run off of a car battery by plugging into the
cigarette lighter & run the strobe from that.  Or, you can figure out (or find
in a hobby electronics magazine) a strobe circuit that will run from batteries.
Battery-powered strobes may also be availble, either assembled or as kits.

Stealth Technology:

 Most light sensors and photocells are more sensitive in the infrared area of
the light spectrum. Infrared (IR) is invisible to the human eye. Putting an
infrared filter over the strobe light may allow the Chrome Box to operate in
traffic undetected by police or other observers. IR filters can be obtained from
military surplus sniperscope illuminators, or from optical supply houses like
Dow-Corning or Edmunds Scientific Co.

Using the Chrome Box:

 Mounted on your car, the Chrome Box can guarantee you green lights at major
intersections in cities that have OptoComs. Handheld Chrome Boxes may be used to
create gridlock by interfering with the normal flow of traffic.  If you have
access to a window overlooking a traffic light, you can play pranks by switching
the signals at inappropriate moments, or you can plug the strobe into an exposed
outlet at a laundromat or gas station.

Some Decoded Patterns:

A Cheesebox (named for the type of box the first one was found in) is a
type of box which will, in effect, make your telephone a Pay-Phone. This
is a simple, modernized, and easy way of doing it.

      Inside Info: These were first used by bookies many years ago as a way
of making calls to people without being called by the cops or having their
numbers traced and/or tapped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    How To Make A Modern Cheese Box


You will need:

     1 Call Forwarding service on the line

     1 Set of Red Box Tones

     The number to your prefix's Intercept operator(do some scanning for
     this one)

     How To:
     -------

       After you find the number to the intercept operator in your prefix,
use your call-forwarding and forward all calls to her.  This will make your
phone stay off the hook (actually it now waits for a quarter to be dropped
in).  You now have a cheese box.

In Order To Call Out On This Line: You must use your Red Box tones and gener-
ate the quarter dropping in.  Then you can make phone calls to people.  As far
as I know, this is fairly safe, and they do not check much.

    Ok, Now you're really pissed.

The Neighborhood Lamer has gone one step too far this time.

It's time for the Busy Box.



1) What is The Busy Box?

More[n,Y,=]
    The Busy Box is the Simplest Box ever created. It is attached to the

outside of the person's house, in their telephone box. It Makes it So that

When any Fone inside That house is Picked up, No dial Tone is heard, and

no Calls can be Received, or Sent. This is Good for Lame BBS's as They Tend

not to call out much, and it will remain Undetected for a longer Period of

Time.



2) Sounds Great! What do I need?



A) One Phone Cord - 5 Inches or so

B) Alligator Clips (Optional)



3) Wow! That's it? Tell me More! How do I set It Up?



    Well,  Take your phone cord, and remove the Outer insulation. Now you

should have 4 wires inside of it, Red, Green, Black, And Yellow. All you need

for most things are Green and Red, so save those. Take either the Black or The

Yellow and strip about 3 Inches with a wire stripper or a Knife. Now cut off 3

inches of Uninsulated wire and, voila, you have a really thin wire. Now, take

this wire, and go to your neighbors back yard. Look for Their Power Box, Near

it should be a small grey (or beige, or some ugly color) box with the little

Bell on it. Open this up (it should come right off, if not, use a 7/15 Hex

Driver) Now inside you should find four more pegs. Look for the Pegs with

More[n,Y,=]
a Green or Red wire coming out of them. If you have a Beige Box, hook it

up to Make sure there Is a Dial Tone. If therre is, Tie one end of your small

wire to the peg with the Green Wire coming out of it, and another to the one

with the Red coming out of it. Now use your beige box on it again, there should

be no dial tone, and pressing buttons should be ineffective. Congratulations,

you've disabled their fone line.



    Something you might want to try is to make the small wire longer, and stuff

    it in to the back of the box where there is a jungle of wires, so it will

be more unnoticable. The more discreet, the better.



- Some Pro's and Con's -



Pro's -

 Very Effective - Any Idiot Could Build it - Very Inexpensive - Easy to Install

Hard to Detect source of problem



Con's -

 Easy to Detect that there -IS- a problem (No dial tone when receiver is picked

 up)



    If anyone knows how to busy the line out, and leave a dialtone, Please

    let me know

The Bud Box
-----------

Revision 1.0
By: Dr. D-Code & The Pimp
    Of The High Mountain Hackerz


Necessary Materials
-------------------
Four alligator clips
One Telephone
Some telephone wire

Instructions
------------

1) Find a neighbors house that has a    little gray(box on the side. This box
should have a Bell logo on it (the gay  little bell in a circle).


2) Apply pressure underneath the box andthe front should come right off. Then,
strip one end off of the length of the  telephone wire. Then strip the ends of
all the different colored wires inside. These should be green, red, yellow and
black. Attach an alligator clip to each of the wires. Then clip the clips to
the same colors in the box. Yellow to   yellow, red to red and so on.

3) Then run the wire across the street  back to your house and then plug a
phone into the other end of the wire.

4) Now you can dial out and receive the neighbors calls. Great for tapping the
phones and then blackmailing them. You  can also stop phreaking because any
outgoing calls will be charged to the   neighbors!   Great eh?

All sysops may

          This is a fairly simple modification that can be made to any phone.
All it does is allow you to take any 2 lines in your house and create a party
line. So far I have not heard of any problems with it from my friends that have
set one up and I have [file messed up here...]

I think that the convenience of having two people on line at any one time will
make up for the minor volume loss.

           In some houses the black and yellow are already wired in others you
will have to go out to your box and rewire it. A good way to figure out which
line is which is to take the phone you are looking for off the hook.  Then you
only need to take the red and green wires entering your phone and hook them
to the different pairs of red and green going into the house.  You can't hurt
anything in the phone or telephone by probeing.  When you find the pair that
you want take the black from your line and attach it to the red of the other
line then take the yellow and attach it to the green line.  Now you are all set
to go.  For people with rotary phones you can have one person call you then
place the second call out to the other person. Though not phreakers tool, the
brown box can be phun.

OK WELL THIS ARTICLE WILL DEAL WITH  SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL,
INCLUDING EVEN THE MOST DIE HARD  PHREAKERS,DONT KNOW.THE FIRST PART  WILL DEAL
WITH THE BACKGROUND KNOW-HOW ,THE SECOND PART WILL DEAL WITH THE  TONES
NEEDED.THE THIRD WILL DEAL WITH WHAT TO DO WITH THEM WHEN YOU HAVE  THEM.THE
FOURTH PART WILL BE THE  THE CONCLUDING PART,ON THE AMERICAN PORTION.
 
.           FIRST LESSON
THE WHAT THE HELL HE IS TALKING ABOUT PART.
 
WELL THE WORD PHREAKING REALLY MEANS GETTING A CALL TO GO THROUGH AND NOT
HAVING TO PAY FOR IT.THE REST OF THIS ARTICLE WILL USE THE TERM PHREAKER OR
PHREAKING. WELL PHREAKING REALLY STARTED IN 1960 WHEN TWO MEN FOUND,IN THE
BOTTOM OF THIER TELEPHONE COMPANY,A OLD,OLD,OLD TEC-MANUAL.IT HAD ALL THE INFO
ON  TELCO TERMINOLGY OF THAT DAY,AND THE  SUCH,BUT THE BEST PART OF THE OLD
MANUAL WAS,----THE TRUNCK TONES. THEY TOLD HOW TO,WHEN TO,WHAT SHOULD
HAPPEN,AND THE SUCH.THAT FAITHFULL DAY BACK IN 1968,WAS THE DAWNING OF THE
PHREAKER.
 
.          SECOND LESSON
.               OR
.   OK THAT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO WHAT ABOUT NOW,AND HOW CAN I PUT THAT OLD
STUFF TO WORK FOR ME??
 
WELL YOU NEED ONE OF TWO THINGS 1-A COMPUTER CAPABLE OF PLAYING MUSIC. 2-A HOME
MADE MEMORY REDIAL BLUE BOX.
 
AND WELL SINCE,I GUESS,YOU ARE READING THIS OFF OF A BBS YOU ALREADY HAVE 1
SOOOOO PUT IT TO USE BUB!!

.            THIRD LESSON
.                 OR
.WELL HELL DUDE KEEP GOING,CAUSE I'M
.          READY AND WILLING.
 
OK SO YOUR JUST SITTING THERE LOOKING AT THIS DUMB PGM YOU MADE,WELL ENOUGH OF
THE TECH INFO,NOW FOR THE HANDS ON. YOU MUST ALWAYS BEFORE A CALL GET INTO A
TRUNK THIS TODAY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CALLING A STEP-BY-STEP SWITCHING SYSTEM,AS
OPPOSED TO CROSSBAR,ESS,OR DMS.FOR SAKE OF SIMPLICITY I WILL USE MONTREAL
DIRECTORY ASSICTANCE. CALL ON YOU PHONE,(DTMF),TOUCH-TONES. 1-514-555-1212,WHEN
YOU HEAR IT RING PLAY INTO THE PHONE 2600HZ.IF ALL GOES WELL YOU WILL HEAR
KERCHINK KERCHUNK SLINCE.NOW AFTER YOU DO THIS NO MORE TOUCH TONES WILL BE
USED. FOR YOUR FIRST TIME TRY 2600HZ WAIT 1 SEC AND KEY IN KP,ALL CALLS MUST
START WITH KP AND END IN ST,YOUR  FRIENDS AREA CODE AND # AND ST.NOW  WAIT.IF
ALL GOES WELL IT WILL RING AND YOUR FRIEND WILL ANSWER.BUT DON'T STAY ON TOO
LONG.
 
.           FOURTH LESSON

.           I HEAR ABOUT.
 
OK SO YOU GOT THIS FAR AND ARE HUNGRY FOR MORE,WELL IF YOU ARE NOT THEN YOU
WILL NEVER BE CLASSIFIED AS A PHREAKER BUT A LOSER. THIS SYSTEM HAS A GREAT
MANY FILES ON JUST THAT SUBJECT SO LOOK  THEM OVER.IF YOU READ SOMETHING ON
ANOTHER GREAT FILE,AND DON'T  UNDERSTAND IT,THEN YOU ARE MESSING  WITH
SOMETHING OUT OF YOU LEAGUE. GRADUALLY BUILD UP TO IT THEN YOU WILL NOT BE
CONSIDERED A LOSER BUT A GREAT PHREAKER. YOU KNOW I STARTED 6-7 YEARS AGO AND I
TOO HAD TO GRADUALLY BUILD UP TO IT, BUT NOT UNTILL A YEAR AGO THIS MONTH  DID
I HAVE AS MUCH FUN IN IT,AS YOU  WILL.AS I AM WRITING THIS ARTICLE I  STILL
HAVE VISIONS OF ALL THE GOOD  BBS'S THAT USED TO BE UP TO HELP  NEW PHREAKS AND
EXPERT PHREAKS,AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL KINDA SORROWED THAT THEY ARE JUST A
HANDFULL OF GOOD BBS'S AROUND FOR ALL THE FUTURE PHREAKS OF  THE WORLD TO LEARN
ON.

OK SO NOW YOU HAVE THE FREQUENCIES LETS GET ON A AUSTRALIAN TRUNK.
 
YOU MUST FIRST CALL AN AUSTRALIAN # AND SINCE SOMETHING MAY GO WRONG FOR  YOU
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,I SUGGEST STRONGLY CALLING THROUGH AN EXTENDER THAT WILL
ALLOW AN OVERSEAS CALL TO GO THROUGH. IF YOU HAVE ONE PUT IT TO USE NOW!!
 
OK LETS ASSUME YOU DO.WELL CALL AN AUSTRALIAN # AND WHEN YOU HEAR IT RING PLAY
THE MAGICAL TONES FOR THE CCITT EQUIPMENT,ITS 2400HZ+2600HZ,WHEN YOU DO THIS
YOU WILL HEAR A SOUND WHICH WILL MAKE YOU THINK THAT THE  CONNECTION WAS
LOST,BUT IT WASN'T,IN FACT YOU ARE NOW ON AN AUSTRALIAN  TRUNK!! AND BY THE
WAY,THERE IS NOT A 10SEC TRUNK TIME OUT.
 
 
.           SIXTH LESSON
.                OR
.      THE KEY DEFINITONS PART.
 
 
NOW YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PROPER PROCEDURE FOR THE CCITT LINE,AND WHAT KEYS DO
WHAT. KEYS 0-12 ARE EXACTLY LIKE OURS!!
 
 
KEY DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------
13 IS LIKE OUR KP.
14 IS LIKE OUR KP2.
15 IS LIKE OUR ST.
--------------------------------------
 
 
.           SEVENTH LESSON
.                OR
. THE PROPER PROCEDURE AND KEY USAGE
.               PART.
 
OK NOW YOU KNOW ALL THE KEYS AND TONES SO NOW IT IS TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE
THEM. LETS ASSUME YOU WERE GOING TO CALL A # IN AUSTRALIA,THE PROCEDURE WOULD
BE-> 13+5+15+0+AC+# WAIT ABOUT 2OR3 SECS  AND ENTER 1(OPER) OR 2(SUBSCRIBER) OR
3(TEST CALL). AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE SOUNDS YOU HEAR AFTER YOU KEY IN THE
TONES, BECAUSE ALL CCITT#5 TRUNKS ARE SUPPOSE TO ECHO BACK EACH CHAR YOU KEY
IN!! NOW LETS CALL THE UNITED STATES. PROCEDURE WOULD BE-->13+2(A LIVE OPER)
OR0(SUBSCRIBER)+AC+#+15. NOW IF IT COULDN'T BE PUT THROUGH, REORDER OR AN
INTERNATIONAL RECORDING TRY THE ONLY INTERNATIONAL SENDER AUSTRALIA HAS,IT'S
MONTREAL CANADA. YOU WOULD ENTER 14+COUNTRY CODE+2OR0+ AC+#+15. NOW THAT SHOULD
BE ABOUT ALL THAT YOU NEED KNOW TO HAVE FUN ON ANOTHER COUNTRIES TRUNK.
 
.           EIGHTH LESSON
.                OR
.        THE CONCLUDING PART.
 
WELL IF YOU ACCTUALLY LIVED IN  AUSTRALIA YOU WOULD HAVE A BITCH OF A TIME
BOXING,DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY USE DC PHONES UNLIKE OUR AC PHONES. YOU SEE
WHEN WE HANG-UP OUR PHONES THE PHONE SHOOTS A 2600HZ TONE TO TELL THE PHONE
COMPANY THAT THE PARTY HAS  HUNG-UP,BUT OVER THERE THEY JUST  REMOVE THE
GROUND,OR THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF THE LINE,SO THERE ARE NO TONES LIKE OURS.IF YOU
ARE SAYING HEY YOU MUST BE WRONG I KNOW SUCH AND SUCH WHO LIVES THERE AND BOXES
ALL THE TIME,WELL YOUR PARTIALLY RIGHT.THEY DO,OR AT LEAST  THEY DID.IN THE
PAST FEW YEARS A CALL TO THE STATES COST THEM ABOUT 20-30 A MIN.WHICH EQUALS
ABOUT 25-40$ OUR  MONEY.BUT THEY DID ONE UP ON THIER TELECOMM,THIER LIKE THE
OLD A.T.T. MA-BELL,YOU SEE THEY WOULD SHORT HAUL THIER CALLS TO THE STATES.WHAT
THEY WOULD DO IS CALL NEW ZEALAND AND THEN BLAST THE 2400+2600HZ SIGNAL AND
BOOM THEY WOULD BE PAYING FOR A CALL TO NEW ZEALAND,THE COST IS LIKE CALLING
FROM NY TO LA HERE,A SUBSTANIAL DIFFERENCE BUT YOU SEE THAT IS NOT SO ANYMORE.
THE COST IS ABOUT THE SAME,$1.00  DIFFERENCE A MIN,SO AUSTRALIANS DON'T REALLY
NEED TO BOX ANYMORE,AND THEY  DON'T!!WELL I HAVE TRIED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE
NEW THIS FIELD AND THE OLD  TIMERS IN IT TOO,WITH THIS ARTICLE. I HOPE THAT AT
LEAST ONE LESSON HELPS SOME OF YOU OUT THERE!!
 
I WISH TO THANK THE FOLLOWING.

A QUARTER IS 33MS ON, 33MS OFF REPEATED
5  TIMES. (MS= MILLISECOND). FOR  THOSE
OF  YOU  WHO   DONT  KNOW,  A  RED  BOX
SIMULATES MONEY  BEING  PUT  INTO A PAY
PHONE. YOU MUST PUT IN SOME MONEY FIRST
THOUGH (THE OPERATOR  CAN TELL IF MONEY
WAS PUT IN BUT AS TO HOW MUCH, SHE LETS
THE COMPUTER ANSWER THAT)

         TASI LOCKING FREQ:

  TASI   (  TIME    ASSIGNMENT   SPEECH
INTERPOLATION )  IS  USED  ON  SATELITE
TRUNKS, AND BASICALLY  ALLOWS MORE THAN
ONE PERSON TO USE A  TRUNK  BY  PUTTING
THEM ON  WHILE  THE OTHER  PERSON  ISNT
TALKING. OF  COURSE,  YOU'D  NEVER HEAR
THE OTHER PERSON TALKING ON YOUR TRUNK.

  WHEN YOU START TO  TALK, HOWEVER, THE
TASI CONTROLLER  HAS TO  FIND  AN  OPEN
TRUNK FOR YOU. BECAUSE  OF  THIS,  SOME
OF YOUR SPEECH  IS LOST( BECAUSE OF THE
DELAY  IN  FINDING  A  TRUNK)  THIS  IS
CALLED CLIPPING.

  WELL,  IF YOU WERE  TRANSMITTING DATA
OVER  A  TRUNK,  CLIPPING  WOULD REALLY
FUCK UP THE DATA. SO THERE IS SOMETHING
CALLED A TASI  LOCKING FREQUENCY  WHICH
KEEPS THE TASI FROM PUTTING ANYONE ELSE
ON YOUR TRUNK OR  YOU  ON  ANYONE ELSES
TRUNK. IN ANY CASE  THE FREQ.  IS  1850
HZ. SENT BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION).

        Blue Boxing:  This file assmes you have made and/or know how to make a Blue Box, that you know how to use a Blue Box, and that you know what a Blue Box can do for you.

        Blue Boxing at first:
                

        When Blue Boxing first started At&t (called Bell at the time) was totaly unwary for this move.  Blue Box tones where ordinginally created for the operator and the phone repair man.  Using them phreaks used to tap lines, call anywhere for free, etc.  
        Then one dreaded day somebody at Bell caught on and BAM, people where busted like mad cause they thought blue box was safe.  
        Suddenly, people relized that it was not safe all the time, not safe sometimes, not safe at all.  NEVER could you sue a Blue Box without being busted.  But even after all this, Bell (and now At&t) still used Blue Box tone and they are still being 
used today.  

        Now, how they got busted.

        Every time a Blue Box tone is used, the number is came from is put on a list.  This list contains all places where Blue Box tones came from in your area code.  Now, just cause your name is on this list dosen't mean that your busted or anything, yo
ur still fine.  However, at the end of the week another list is compared to the list of where the tones came from.  If your NOT on this list you are in BIG trouble.  Expect a vist to court.

        Now, the trick of not getting busted.

        The first thing is obvious.  You must get on the second list mentioned above.  Then your stumped, how do I get on that list?!?!?  
        
        Getting on a Blue Box tone list.

        Alright, all operators are always on the list.  So if you have a neighbor who is an operator, just put in a tap.  No problem.  
        Now your saying "Oh great, all I have to do is move nextdoor to an operator.  I read this whole G-file just to find that out!" Wrong.  That's is the easiest way but by no means the only.       
        Another way:  When a phone repair man comes to your house and either instals a new line, tests an old line, fixs a phone.  Fixes a tine or works on your main Box (you know those big GREEN BOXS sitting in about every 8th house's yard.  Then your nu
mber goes on the list.  
        By knowing a repair man you can get on this list or after having the line fixed, you can drag out your blue box and have some fun!
        Finnaly.  I have never succed in this but I know it DOES work.
        Run a war dial of you area until you get a gold box (also called a diverter) tone.  If you can find one go install a Gold Box somewhere.  Now scan again until you get your local At&t switching station.  Call back through the diverter and hack unti
l you get a High level persons access.  From a highlevel person access you can call in and edit the list of places where tones can come from.  Now you can use the Blue Box.  I personally have hacked a acount in At&t but it wasn't high enough to edit the l
ist but I could read it.  From reading it I fround a bunch of good places to install a Gold Box.


                 I be writing a G-phile on Gold boxing and then on on tapping a line.    
        Look for more stuff soon.

        The above was tested by The Micro Master, The Storyteller and someone else who dosen't have a modem but likes to call places free.

        The tests where done on At&t's Electronic Switching System (ESS) and no busts where even made so it is presumed safe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------This bulletin has been taken from the OSUNY files from 82/83


     This  bulletin  will  deal  only with the basic contruction,
troubleshooting and adjustment of the blue  box.   If  you  would
like  to  know  the specific job of a ny part in the circuit just
write me a msg and I will be glad to answer it.


 We all know that the touch tones frequencies are composed of two
tones  (Two different freqs.)  so t hat is the reason why we have
2 VCO'S ( Voltage controlled oscilators).   We  will  call  these
VCO#1 and VCO#2.  If you have noticed VCO#1 and VCO#2 are exactly
the same type of circuits.  That is why only one was drawn.   But
remember  that whatever goes for VCO#1 also goes for VCO#2.  Both
VCO'S are composed of a handfull of  parts.   one  chip  two  cap
acitors  2  resistors  and five potentiometers.  All of this will
give you (when properly calibrated) one of the freqs.   necessary
(the other one will come from VCO#2) for the operation of the BB.
Both of these freqs.  will be mixed in the speaker  thus  forming
the required tone.

This is one of the most sophisticated designs I have  ever  made.
Why?.    because  other designs will drain the battery after 10 -
calls!  This design will make them  last  10  months!!!!!!.   But
never  the  less  don't forget to put in a switch for on and off.
Ok let's build the two VCO'S and calibr ate the  unit  before  we
get to the keyboard contruction.


		       VCO CONTRUCTION
		       === ===========
  TOOLS REQUIRED

 1 ocilliscope    (recomended but not re quired)
 1 Freq. counter   (REQUIRED)
 1 Volt meter       "  "  "
  Electronics tools  (Pliers,drill, screwdrivers, etc)


      PARTS

 R1    1.5K RESISTOR  5%
 R2    1K   RESISTOR  5%
 C1    .1uf ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR   16V DC
 C2    .01uf ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR (MYL AR) 16VDC
 IC1   2207  VCO CHIP  BY EXAR ELECTRINICS
 remember  the  above  it is only for VCO#1 but the same goes for
VCO#2.

  R3-R4  150 OHM RESISTORS  5%
  C3-C4   .1 uf  ELECTROLITIC CAPACITOR  10VDC
  P1-P10 200K TRIMMER POT - 20 TURNS
  DIODES USED IN THE KEYBOARD ARE 1N914  TYPE (40 OF THEM)
  AND 13 SWITCHES FOR THE KEYBOARD SPST. MOMENTARY.

  SPKR= YOU CAN USE A TELEPHONE SPEAKER  FOR THIS(IT WORKS BEST)
	BUT REMEMBER TO TAKE OUT THE DIO DE THAT IS CONNECTED
	ACCROSS IT.
****************************************************************
		 IMPORTANT NOTES

   1 DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE THAN A MYL AR CAPACITOR FOR C2
   2 PINS 10,9,8 SHOULD BE TIED TOGETHER AND BE LEFT  FLOATING.
   3 ALL RESISTOR SHOULD BE 5%! NOTHING ELSE
   4 A TELEPHONE SPEAKER GIVES THE BEST RESULTS
*****************************************************************


		TROUBLE SHOOTING

 By now you should have constructed the  two  VCO'S  on  a  bread
board or anything that please s you.

 Check  for  cold  solder  joints,  broken wires, polarity of the
battery, etc.........

 Before we apply power to the VCO'S we have to  adjust  the  pots
for their half way travel point.  This is done by turning them 21
turns to the right and then 10 turns to the left.   Do  the  same
for all ten of them.

Now  apply  power to the unit check to see that you have power in
the chips by putting the positive lea d of your volt meter on pin
7  and  the negative lead on pin 12 .  If you don't have anything
there turn off the unit ant REC HECK THE WIRING.

When you get the right voltages on the chips, connect a diode  to
a  piece  of  wire  (look  at  fig.  2 for the orientation of the
diode) from ground to any pot at point T (look carefully  at  the
schematic  for  point  T  it is label ed T1-T10 for all pots) You
shold be able to hear a tone, if no t dissconnect  the  lead  and
place  the speaker close to your ear and if you hear a chirp like
sound, this means that the two VCO' S are working if  you  don't,
it  means  that  either  one or both of the VCO'S is dead.  So in
this case it is allways good to ha ve an ocilloscope on hand.

 Disconnect  the  speaker  from  the  circuit  and   hookup   the
ocilliscope  to  one  of the leads of the speaker and t he ground
from the scope to the ground of the battery.  Connect ag ain  the
ground  lead  with  the diode connected to it from grou nd to any
pot on the VCO that  you  are  checking  and  you  should  see  a
triangle  wave if not turn the pot in which you are appl ying the
ground to until you see it.  When you do see it do the  the  same
for  the  other  VCO  to make sure it is working.  (a mplitude is
about 2VAC)

When you get  the  two  VCO'S  working  you  a  re  set  for  the

   Disconnect  the  speaker from the circu it and connect a freq.
counter (the positive lead of the counte r to one of the speakers
leads that belongs to VCO#1 or connect i t to pin 14).

   Connect the negative lead to the batt ery negative and connect
the jumper lead with the diode f rom ground to pot number 1 T1 .(
The first pot number 1 point T1) If you got it working you should
hear a tone and get a reading on the counter.  Adjust the pot for
a  freq.    of  1700hz  and  continue doing the same for pots 2-5
except that they get d ifferents freqs.


		    P1= 1700hz
		    P2= 1300hz
		    P3= 1100hz
		    P4=  900hz
		    P5= 1500hz

 Now disconnect the freq.  counter from  t  he  speaker  lead  of
VCO#1  or  from pin 14 (which ever you had it attac hed to at the
beginning) and connect it to the speaker lead of VCO#2 or to  pin
14 of VCO#2 and perform the same adjustments to P6-10.

		    P6= 1100hz
		    P7=  700hz
		    P8=  900hz
		    P9=  2600hz   MAGIC  NUMBER!!!!!

  When  you finish doing all of the pot g o back and recheck them
again.


			    KEYBOARD

 If you look at fig-2 you will  see  that  the  keys  are  simple
switches  connected  to  ground and two diodes on th e other end.
These diodes  are  used  to  simplify  the  construction  of  the
keyboard  because otherwise the distribution of the ground signal
fo r both VCO'S would have been  done  mechanically.   One  diode
will go to VCO#1 and the other will go to VCO#2.  Fig-3 shows the
arrangement of th e keys on the keyboard.


  Below is a table that will  hel  p  you  connect  the  keys  to

THIS IS THE TONE MATRIX FOR A BOX WHICH GENERATES
TONES THAT OPERATORS USE TO DIAL.ROTARY WORKS AS WELL,
ON OPERATOR LINES, BUT THIS IS TECHNOLOGICAL(!).
NOW I AGREE WITH THE OPINION OF A WELL KNOWN PHREAK
THAT 'BOXING' IS/WILL BE FOR THE MOST PART DEAD, BUT
THIS IS TRADITION... FIRST,YOU DIAL DIR.ASST, OR AN OPER. ETC,
THEN YOU BLAST TE LINE WITH A 2600HZ TONE. THIS GIVES YOU THE
LINE, THIS IS ALSO HOW MA BELL TRACKS DOWN BLUE BOXERS...
THERE  ARE 2600HZ DETECTORS SYSTEMS, AND
EVEN ON OLD #4 CROSSBARS... ONCE ON A OPER.TRUNK LINE,
YOU USE YOUR BLUE BOX/ROTARY TO DIAL...
SO,  IF YOU USE2600HZ, WHICH IS NECESSARY, UNLESS YOU
ARE *VERY* CAREFUL, YOU WILL BE SNAGGED.
FINALLY, THIS IS WHAT YOU READ!SO LONG AND HARD FOR:

USE KP TO START A CALL, AND ST TO STOP, WITH
THE BELOVED 2600HZ TONE TO DISCONNECT.
I ALSO HEAR THAT 2600HZ RESETS SPRINT NODES AND
GIVES YOU THEIR INITIAL TONE..

                      Blue Boxes, Part II
 
 
     While  reading  the fine article on the blue box I saw  that 
there a lot of data left out of the document.   I hope this adds, 
in some small way, to the information.
     First the tones.   While all the informatio is correct, the 
timing specs were not included.   The tone pairs are to remain on 
for 1/10 sec. with 1/10 sec. of slience between digits.  The 'KP' 
tones  should be sent for 2/10 sec.   A way to defeat the  2600hz 
traps  is to send along with the 2600z some pink  noise(most  of 
the  energy  in this signal should be above 3000hz,  this  signal 
won't make it over the toll network,  but should carry as far  as 
your  local  toll  center) so that the traps  won't  find  'pure' 
2600hz  on the trunk.   Ths is not a perfectly safe way to  box, 
but it should slow down the discovery.
     As  to use,  the first thing you need to understand is  that 
there  are  two(2)  types of toll completing  trunk,  inward  and 
outward.  The names are reference to the ofice that is switching 
the  call(The toll center that serves the WATS line  you  called) 
and each type of trunk has a different class of service.  From an 
inward toll completing trunk, you can reach the different service 
operators,  the toll test board  and the Inward Operator.   Some 
offices also allow remote testing and it is in these offices that 
you  can access the outward toll completing trunks.   The Outward 
trunks  allow  you  to  make  Verification(emergency)  calls,  do 
service  monitoring(tapping),  stack trunks(busy out  all  trunks 
between  LA and NYC),  enable and disable TSPS positions,  and in 
some cases(on some 4A's) issue temporary rerouting instructions( 
send  all calls from LA to NYC via Miami,  Boston,  or any  other 
class  5  office or offices).   Both type of trunk allow  you  to 
place a 'standard' call with a box.
     In  some  offices,  mostly the small ones with a  toll  test 
board that is unattended at night and on weekends, you can get an 
outward  toll completing the [file messed up here...]

 Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the inncoent
phreakers around America has finally been concieved by the one phreak who is
the expert on lines and voltage: The Traveler. Other boxes by the Traveler
include the White Gold Box, the Aqua Box, The Diverti Box, and the Cold Box.
All of those plans will soon be available in a BBS/AE near you!
 Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box, here is a
brief summery of a legend.


--*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--

   For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that the function
of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage Master, it is
possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame, the Blotto Box is
finally available to the public.

   NOTE: The Traveler can not be responcable for the information disclosed in
the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and should not be
actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse machine could have
the severe results listed below and could result in high federal prosecution!
Again, The Traveler TAKES NO RESPONCABILITY!
   All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box and
it's function.
   The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on it's
knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for that
matter. As long as the switchhing system stays the same, this box will not
stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical impulses
that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will ring and ring
and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the box/ generator is
stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here. We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone
line will continue to ring, and people close to the box may be electricuted if
they pick up the phone.
   But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or
generator. If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a superficial
aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is not advised! The
Blotto Box will continue as long as there is electricity to continue with.
   OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you to
do with it...


--*-=> The Blotto Box Functions and Installation <=-*--

   Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
following are the instructions for construction and use of this box. Please
read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt to
construct this box.
   Materials:
             - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a
               stadium or some such place.
             - A radio shack cord set for 400 volts that splices a female
               plug into a phone line jack.
             - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
             - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
               you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
               boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
               or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
                   code!
             - A soudering iron and much souder.
             - A remote control or long wooden pole.

   Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of the
other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make sure it is
one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole, not the huge ones at
the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything convienent, if you are
two feeble that fuck don't try this. Take a look inside... you are hunting
for color-coordinating lines of green and red. Now, take out your radio shack
cord and rip the meter thing off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A
good level to set the voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage
meter to the cord and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of
the cord into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part
off. Open it up and match the red and green wires with the other red and green
wires.
   NOTE: If you just had the generator on and have done this in the
correct order, you will be a crispy critter. Keep the generator off until you
plan to start it up. Now, sauder those lines together carefully. Wrap duck
tape or insultation tape around all of the wires. Now, place the remote
control right on to the startup of the generator. If you have the long pole,
make sure it is very long and stand back as far away as you can get and reach
the pole over.

   NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading
the file first, you sill realized now that your area code is about to become
null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
damn life. Anywhere, just get away from it. It will be generating so much
electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself. The generator
will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your area code,
because all of that energy is spreading through all of the phone lines around
you in every direction.
   Have a nice day!

Ever want to really make yourself be heard? Ever talk to someone on the phone 
who just doesn't shut up? Or just call the operator and pop her eardrum? Well,
Up until recently it has been impossible for you to do theese things. That is, 
unless of course you've got a blast box. All a blast box is, is a really cheap
amplifier, (around 5 watts or so) connected in place of the microphone on your 
telephone. It works best on model 500 AT&T Phones, and if constructed small
enough, can be placed inside the phone.

Construction: 
 Construction is not really important. Well it is, but since I'm letting you 
 make your own amp, I really don't have to include this. 

Usage:
Once you've built your blast box, simply connect a microphone (or use the 
microphone from the phone) to the input of the amplifier, and presto. There it 
is. Now, believe it or not, this device actually works. (At least on crossbar.) 
It seems that illinois bell switching systems allow quite alot of current to 
pass right through the switching office, and out to whoever you're calling. 
When you talk in the phone, it comes out of the other phone (again it works 
best if the phone that you're calling has the standard western electric 
earpiece) incredibly loud. This device is espicially good for PBS Subscription 
drives.

           What is a BLACK BOX? A BLACK BOX is a device that is hooked up to your phone that fixes your phone so that when you get a call, the caller doesn't get charged for the call. This is good for calls up to 1/2 hour, after 1/2  hour the Gestapo (the

you can guess what happens. 
           What this little beauty does is keep the line voltage from dropping  to 10v when you answer your phone. The line is insted kept at 36v and it will
make the phone think that it is still ringing while your talking. The reason
for the 1/2 hour time limit is that the Gestapo thinks that something is wrong
after 1/2 an hour of ringing. (I mean, come on)

           Once you have hooked up all the parts, you must figure out what set of wires go to the line and which go to the fone. This is because of the fact
that LED's must be put in, in a certain direction.  Depending  on which way you
put the LED is what controls what wires are for the line & fone.
 
           In order to find out, hook up the box in one  direction
using one set of wires for line and the other for phone.

           *NOTE*  For Model ][ switch  should  be
                  set to side connecting the LED.
 
     Once  you have hooked it up,  then pick up the fone and see if the LED  is
on.  If it is, the LED will be lit.  If is  doesn't light then switch the wires
and try again.  Once you know which are which  then label  them.   *NOTE*  - If
neither  directions  worked  then  your switch was in the wrong position.   Now

     The purpose of this box is not  to people  who  call you so it would  make

()Introduction  
   Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset?  Surely every phreak has at least
once considered the phun that he could have with one.After searching unlocked
phone company trucks for one for months, We had an idea.  We could build one.
We did, and named it the "Beige Box,"simply because that is the color of ours.
In the following file we will give complete instructions for the construction
and use of a Beige Box.

()Construction
   The construction is very simple.  First, you must understand the concept of
 the device.  In a modular jack, there are four wires. These are red, green,
 yellow, and black.  For a single line telephone, however, only two matter:
 the red (ring) and green (tip).  The yellow and black are not necessary for
 this project.  A lineman's handset only has two clips on it: the ring and
 the tip.  You will need a phone (we recommend a touch-tone) with a modular
 plug, a modular jack, and two large alligator clips (preferably red and green
 respectively).  Take the modular jack and look at the bottom of its casing.
  There should be a grey jack with four wires (red, green, yellow, and black)
More[n,Y,=]
 leading out of it.  To the end of the red wire attach a red alligator clip.
  To the end of the green wire attach a green alligator clip.  The yellow and
 black wires can be removed, although I would only set them aside so that you
 can use the modular jack in future projects.  Now insert your telephone's
 modular plug into the modular jack.  That's it. This particular model is nice
 because it can be easily made,is inexpensive, uses common parts that are
 readily available, is small, is lightweight, and does not require the
 destruction of a phone.

()Uses
    There are many uses for the Beige Box.  However, before you can use it,
 you must know how to attach it to its output device.  This device can be any
 of several Bell switching apparatus that include terminal sets (i.e., remote
 switching centers, bridging heads, cans, etc.).  To open most Bell Telephone
 switching apparatus, you must have a 7/16 inch hex driver. This piece of
 equipment can be picked up at your local hardware store.  With your 7/16 hex
 driver, turn the security bolt(s) approximately 1/8 of an inch
 counter-clockwise and open.  If your output device is locked, then you must
 have some knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks.  However, we have
 never encountered a locked output device.  Once you have opened your output
 device, you should see a mass of wires connected to terminals.  On most of
 your output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip -- if not
 labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not labeled, it is
 usually on the right).  Remember: Ring - red -  right. The "Three R's" -- a
More[n,Y,=]
 simple way to remember which is which.  Now you must attach the red alligator
 clip (ring) to the "R" (ring) terminal.  Attach the green alliagtor clip
 (tip) to the "T" (tip) terminal.  NOTE: If instead of a dial tone you hear
 nothing, re-adjust the alligator clips so that they are not touching each
 other or other terminals.  Also make sure that they are firmly attached.By
 this time you should hear a dial tone.  Dial ANI and find out the number that
 you are using (you wouldn't want to use your own).
  
Here are some practical applications: Eavesdropping
                                        Long distance, static-free phone calls
                                        Dialing direct to Alliance Conferencing
                                        Phucking people over
                                        Bothering the operator 
                                        Blue Boxing 
                                        Anything at all that you want
                  
()Eavesdropping:
        To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box and then your phone.
  This eliminates static caused by connecting the box, therefore reducing the
 potential suspicion of your victim.  When eavesdropping, it is always best to
 be neither seen nor heard.  If you hear someone dialing out, do not panic;
 but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the receiver again.  The person will
 either have hung up or tried to complete their call again.  If the latter is
 true, then listen in, and perhaps you will find information worthy of
More[n,Y,=]
 blackmail!  If you would like to know who you are listening to, after dialing
 ANI, pull a CN/A on the number.

()Dialing Long Distance:
   This section is self-explanatory, but don't forget to dial a"1" before the
 NPA.

()Dialing Direct to Alliance Conferencing:
   Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from there.  I
 prefer this method over PBXs, since PBXs often have poor reception and are
 more difficult to come by.

()Phucking People Over:
   This is a very large topic for discussion.  Just by using the other
 functions described, you can create a large phone bill for the person (they
 will not have to pay it, but it is a hassle for them). In addition, since you
 are an extension of the person's line, leave your phone off hook, and they
 will not be able to make or recieve calls.  This can be extremely nasty
 because no one would suspect the cause of the problem.

()Bothering the Operator:
   This is also self-explanatory and can provide hours of entertainment.
  Simply ask or say things to her that are offensive and you would not like
 traced to your line.  This also corresponds with the previous described
More[n,Y,=]
 section, Phucking People Over.  After all, guess who's line it gets traced
 to? He he he...

()Blue Boxing:
   See a file on Blue Boxing for more details.  This is an especially nice
 feature if you live in an ESS-equipped prefix, since the calls are, once
 again, not traced to your line.

()Potential Risks:
   Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicions within the Gestapo, and
 result in legal problems.
  Therefore, I would recommend that you:  Use more than one output device
                                          Choose a secluded spot 
                                          Keep a low profile
 
()Safe Guards:
   In order to make sure that the enemy has not been inside your ouput
 device, I reccomend that you place a piece of transparent tape over the
 opening of your output device. Therefore, if it is opened in your absence,
 the tape will be displaced and you will be aware of the fact that someone
 has been intruding upon your territory.

 Beige  Boxing

        Beige Boxes are amazingly simple to make -  They are just
test sets, which are used by telephone linemen for connecting to
any phone line.  And test sets are just ordinary telephones.  They
are called beige boxes because they are a combination of a brown
box, a device for listening into phone lines, and a white box,
which is a portable touch-tone generator, sold by Radio Shack and
AT&T. (AT&T actually colors theirs white, which I find hilarious.)
Beige Boxing is easy, fun, and offers dialing options often
unavailable through LDC ports or extenders - you are physically
using an unsuspecting person's phone line for making calls
anywhere - even to the 0-700 and 900 SACs (Special Area Codes)
and 976- numbers.  The only reason I am writing this file is to
make this enjoyable hobby aware to phreaks who want something
different to try.

                o  Blue Boxing with a greatly reduced chance of getting 
                   caught     
                o  Anything at all that you want, since you are an

                        How to build a BLUE BOX 
                        ----------------------- 
 
   We all know that the touch tone frequencies are composed of 2 tones (2 
different frequencies) so that is the reason why we have 2 VCO's (Voltage 
Controlled Oscilators). We will call then VCO#1 and VCO#2. If you have
noticed VCO#1 and VCO#2 are exactly the same type of circuits. That is why
only 1 was drawn. But remember that whatever goes for VCO#1 also goes for
VCO#2. Both VCO'S are composed of a handfull of part. One chip, two
capacitors, 2 resistors and five potentiometers. All of this will give you
(when properly calibrated) one of the freqencies necessary (the other one
will come from VCO#2) for the operation of the Blue Box. Both of these freqs.
will be mixed in the speaker to form the required tone. 
 
   This is one of the most sophisticated designs I have ever made. Why? 
Because other designs will drain the battery after 10 calls. This design will
make them last 10 months!!!!!  But never the less, don't forget to put in a
switch for on and off. Ok let's build the two VCO'S and calibrate the unit
before we get to the keyboard construction. 
 
VCO CONSTRUCTION:

           TOOLS REQUIRED 
 
 1 ocilliscope(optional but not req) 
 1 Freq. counter   (REQUIRED)

 SPKR=YOU CAN USE A TELEPHONE SPEAKER 
      FOR THIS (IT WORKS BEST) BUT 
      REMEMBER TO TAKE OUT THE DIODE 
      THAT IS CONNECTED ACCROSS IT.
 
======================================= 
 
           IMPORTANT NOTES 
 
  1. DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE OTHER 
     THAN A MYLAR CAPACITOR FOR C2. 
  2. PINS 10,9,8 SHOULD BE TIED 
     TOGETHER AND BE LEFT FLOATING. 
  3. ALL RESISTORS SHOULD BE 5%! 
     NOTHING ELSE! 
  4. A TELEPHONE SPEAKER GIVES THE 
     BEST RESULTS. 
 
======================================= 
 
           TROUBLE SHOOTING 
 
   By now you should have constructed the two VCO'S on a bread board or 
anything that pleases you. Check for cold solder joints, broken wires, 
polarity of the battery, etc. Before we apply power to the VCO'S we have to
adjust the pots for their half way travel point. This is done by turning them
21 turns to the right and then 10 turns to the left. Do the same for all ten
of them. 
 
   Now apply power to the unit check to see that you have power in the chips
by putting the positive lead of your volt meter on pin 7 and the negative
lead on pin 12. If you do not have anything there turn off the unit and
RECHECK THE WIRING. 
 
   When you get the right voltages on the chips, connect a diode to a piece
of wire (look at fig. 2 for the orientation of the diode) from ground to any
pot at point T (look carefully at the schematic for point T it is labeled
T1-T10 for all pots). You should be able to hear a tone, if not disconnect
the lead and place the speaker close to your ear and if you hear a chirp-like
sound, this means that the two VCO'S are working if you don't, it means that
either one or both of the VCO'S are dead. So in this case it is always good
to have an ocilloscope on hand. Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and
hook the ocilliscope to 1 of the leads of the speaker & the ground from the
scope to the ground of the battery. Connect again the ground lead with the
diode connected to it from ground to any pot on the VCO that you are checking
and you should see a triangle wave if not turn the pot in which you are
applying the ground to until you see it. When you do see it do the the same
for the other VCO to make sure it is working. (amplitude is about 2VAC). When
you get the two VCO's working you are set for the adjustment of the
individuals pots. 
 
 
                            Adjustment 
                            ---------- 
 
   Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and connect a freq. counter (the
positive lead of the counter to one of the speakers leads that belongs to 
VCO#1 or connect it to pin 14). 
 
   Connect the negative lead to the battery negative and connect the jumper
lead with the diode from ground to pot number 1.T1. ( the first pot number
1 point T1) if you got it working you should hear a tone and get a reading
on the counter. Adjust the pot for a freq. of 1700HZ and continue doing the
same for pots 2-5 except that they get differents freqs. which are: 
 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
$ P1= 1700hz $ 
$ P2= 1300hz $ 
$ P3= 1100hz $ 
$ P4=  900hz $ 
$ P5= 1500hz $ 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
 
   Now disconnect the freq. counter from the speaker lead of VCO#1 or from
pin 14 (which ever you had it attached to at the beginning) and connect it
to the speaker lead of VCO#2 or to pin 14 of VCO#2 and make the same
adjustments to P6-10. 
 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
$ P6=  1100hz $ 
$ P7=   700hz $ 
$ P8=   900hz $ 
$ P9=  2600hz $ 
$ P10= 1500hz $ 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
 
   When you finish doing all of the pots go back and re-check them. 
 
 
                            Keyboard 
                            -------- 
 
  If you look at FIG-2 you will see that the keys are simple switches. 
Connected to a ground and two diodes on the other end. these diodes are used
to simplify the construction of the keyboard because otherwise the
distribution of the ground signal for both VCO'S would have been done
mechanically. The diode will go to VCO#1 and the other will go to VCO#2.
FIG-3 shows the arrangement of the keys on the keyboard. 
 
 
   Below is a table that will help you connect the keys to the required VCO's
pots.

     The XR-2207 chip is a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator and a 14 pin device
thus you must be very careful when soldering the parts to this device. It is 
a little dificult to actually draw a schematic on an 80 character screen  
using limited graphics, but I will give 
it a try.

is is a diagram of how to locate the different pins on the chip. 
Please notice that pin one (1) is the closest to the notch on top of the
chip. The first thing we'll do is to connect power to the chip (remember that
you need to build two (2) of these to get a complete system) this is
accomplished by connecting the positive wire of the battery lead to pin#1 one
leg of R1  and R2 is soldered to pin#11. The other leg of R1 goes to pin 1
or to the d. C1 goes between pin 10 and ground. The timing capacitor or C2
goes between pins 2 and 3 of the chip. Pins 8 and 9 should be grounded to
ground. Pin 14 is the output and this is where one leg of C4 (C3 goes on the
other VCO) in series with R3 (the same goes for the other VCO) and to one
lead of the speaker. 
 
     The trimmer pots P1 to P10 should be grouped in groups of 5 pots each.
The way you group it is by soldering one end of the pot to each other leaving
the wiper and the other end free. 
 
          | This end goes to pin 6 of the chip 
                   |

[Construction]
-Take the Molecular phone plug(Plug) with cord. The cord length 
 is if you want it next to the wall, phone, modem, ect. First,
 remove about an inch and a half of insulation off with the 
 wirecutters. Second, tie off the yellow and black wires. They are
 not needed. Third, take off about three forths of insulation off 
 the red and green wires. Then twist the wires, but not together.
 Then melt some solder on the wires. Forth, drill a forth of and 
 inch hole in one end of the project box. Fifth, put the wires 
 through the hole about three inches, and tie the cord so that
 the wires will not slip.

 three forths of a inch of insulation on both ends of both 
 wires. Third, put some solder on the ends of the wires. Forth,
 solder one wire on each p1 on SW1. The side where the red wire
 is,  solder the other end of the wire on p1 of SW1 to red on 
 the Jack. The side where the green wire is, solder the other 
 end of the wire on p1 of SW1 to green on the Jack. Sixth, cut 
 two more wires about five inches long. Seventh, take off about
 three forths of a inch of insulation on both end of both wires.
 Eighth, put some solder on the ends of the wires. Nineth, 
 solder one wire on p1 of SW1.
-Drill another hole on the top. File it, so that SW2 fits.
 Insert SW2. First, cut two wires about two and a half inches 
 long. Second, take off about three forths of a inch of 
 insulation on both ends of both wires. Third, put some solder on
 the ends of the wires. Forth, solder one wire on each p2 on SW1.
 Fifth, solder the other end of wires to the middle termal of 
 SW2. Sixth, cut four wire about three inches long. Seventh, take
 off about three forths of a inch of insulation on both ends of 
 the wires. Eighth, put so solder on each end of the wires. 
 Nineth, solder one wire on each termal p1 and p2 of SW2.
-Drill a hole on top, so that the LED fits. Cut a wire about 
 three inches,remove insulation,and solder to LED leg. On the 
 other leg solder R2.
-Take the perfboard. Insert T1. Connect wires from one side of 
 sw2 to the termals on one side of T1. Cut two wires about two 
 inches, remove insulation, solder to the other termals of T1.
 Next, solder ends of wires to the termals on one side of T2.
 Cut two wires about two inches, remove insulation, solder to 
 each end of R1, also solder the LED and R2 to each end of R1.

[How to Use It]
-SW1 is off/on,SW2 is black/aqua. 
-First, SW1 is 1, SW2 is 1. Second, turn on, the black box is on
 ,and you call as mention in definition. Third, when finish 
 change SW2 to 2, if LED comes on then F.B.I. is trying to trace
 ,but the aqua box is on and hangsup your phone.

 EVERY TRUE PHREAKER LIVES IN FEAR OF THE DREDDED F.B.I. 'LOCK IN TRACE.' FOR
A LONG TIME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE LOCK IN TRACE. THIS BOX DOES
OFFER AND ESCAPE ROUTE WITH SIMPLE DIRECTIONS TO IT. THIS BOX IS QUITE A 
SIMPLE CONCEPT, AND ALMOST ANY PHREAKER WITH BASIC ELECTRONICS KNOWLEDGE CAN
CONSTRUCT AND USE IT.
 
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/    THE LOCK     /-/
/-/    IN TRACE     /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
 A LOCK IN TRACE IS A DEVICE USED BY THE F.B.I. TO LOCK INTO THE PHONE USERS
LOCATION SO THAT HE CAN NOT HANG UP WHILE A TRACE IS IN PROGRESS. FOR THOSE OF
YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CONECPT OF 'LOCKING IN', THEN HERE'S A BREIF
DESCIPTION.
 THE F.B.I. CAN TAP INTO A CONVERSATION, SORT OF LIKE A THREE-WAY CALL 
CONNECTION. THEN, WHEN THEY GET THERE, THEY CAN PLUG ELECTRICITY INTO THE 
PHONE LINE. ALL PHONE CONNECTIONS ARE HELD OPEN BY A CERTAIN VOLTAGE OF 
ELECTRICITY, THAT IS WHY YOU SOMETIMES GET STATIC AND FAINT CONNECTIONS WHEN
YOU ARE CALLING FAR AWAY, BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY HAS TROUBLE KEEPING THE LINE
UP. WHAT THE LOCK IN TRACE DOES IS CUT INTO THE LINE AND GENERATE THAT SAME
VOLTAGE STRAIGHT INTO THE LINES. THAT WAY, WHEN YOU TRY AND HANG UP, VOLTAGE
IS RETAINED. YOUR PHONE WILL RING JUST LIKE SOMEONE WAS CALLING YOU EVEN AFTER
YOU HANG UP. (IF YOU HAVE CALL WAITING, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND BETTER ABOUT 
THAT, FOR CALL WAITING INTERSEPTS THE ELECTRICITY AND MAKES A TONE THAT MEANS
SOMEONE IS GOING THROUGH YOUR LINE. THEN, IT IS A MATTER OF WHICH VOLTAGE IS
HIGHER. WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN THE RECEIVER, THEN IT SEE-SAWS THE ELECTRICITY TO
THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN YOU HAVE A PERSON ON EACH LINE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HANG 
UP UNLESS ONE OR BOTH OF THEM WILL HANG UP. IF YOU TRY TO HANG UP, VOLTAGE IS
RETAINED, AND YOUR PHONE WILL RING. THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF
HOW CALLING WORKS, ALSO. WHEN ELECTRICITY PASSES THROUGH A CERTAIN POINT ON
YOUR PHONE, THE ELECTRICITY CAUSES A BELL TO RING OR ON SOME NEWER PHONES AN
ELECTRONIC RING TO SOUND.)
 SO, IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE TRACE, YOU SOMEHOW MUST LOWER THE VOLTAGE LEVEL
ON YOUR PHONE LINE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERY TIME SOMEONE ELSE PICKS UP THE
PHONE LINE, THEN THE VOLTAGE DOES DECREASE A LITTLE. IN THE FIRST STEPS OF
PLANNING THIS OUT, XEROX SUGGESTED GETTING ABOUT A HUNDRED PHONES ALL HOOKED
INTO THE SAME LINE THAT COULD ALL BE TAKEN OFF THE HOOK AT THE SAME TIME.
THAT WOULD GREATLY DECREASE THE VOLTAGE LEVEL. THAT IS ALSO WHY MOST THREE-
WAY CONNECTIONS THAT ARE USING THE BELL SERVICE THREE WAY CALLING (WHICH IS
ONLY $3 A MONTH) BECOME QUITE FAINT AFTER A WHILE.
 BY NOW, YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE BASIC IDEA. YOU HAVE TO DRAIN ALL OF THE
POWER OUT OF THE LINE SO THE VOLTAGE CAN NOT BE KEPT UP. I RATHER SUDDEN
DRAINING OF POWER COULD QUICKLY SHORT OUT THE F.B.I. VOLTAGE MACHINE, BECAUSE
IT WAS ONLY BUILT TO SUSTAIN THE EXACT VOLTAGE NESSECARY TO KEEP THE VOLTAGE
OUT.
 FOR NOW, IMAGE THIS. ONE OF THE NORMAL RADIO SHACK GENERATORS THAT YOU CAN GO
PICK UP THAT ONE END OF THE CORD THAT HOOKS INTO THE CENTRAL BOX HAS A PHONE
JACK ON IT AND THE OTHER HAS AN ELECTRICAL PLUG. THIS WAY, YOU CAN "FLASH"
VOLTAGE THROUGH THE LINE, BUT CANNOT DRAIN IT. SO, SOME MODIFICATIONS HAVE
TO BE DONE.
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/   THE AQUA BOX  /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
 
 MATERIALS NEEDED- A BEOC (BASIC ELECTRICAL OUTPUT SOCKET), LIKE A SMALL LAMP
                   TYPE CONNECTION, WHERE YOU JUST HAVE A SIMPLE PLUG AND WIRE
                   THAT WOULD PLUG INTO A LIGHT BULB.
                 - ONE OF CORDS MENTIONED ABOVE, IF YOU CAN'T FIND ONE THEN
                   CONSTRUCT YOUR OWN... SAME VOLTAGE CONNECTION, BUT THE
                   RESTRAINOR MUST BE BUILT IN (I.E. THE CENTRAL BOX)
                 - TWO PHONE JACKS (ONE FOR THE MODEM, ONE FOR IF YOU ARE 
                   BEING TRACED TO PLUG THE AQUA BOX INTO)
                 - SOME CREATIVITY AND EASY WORK.
 
 NOTICE: NO PHONES HAVE TO BE DESTROYED/MODIFIED TO MAKE THIS BOX, SO DON'T GO
         OUT AND BUY A NEW PHONE FOR IT!
 
 ALL RIGHT, THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE PROCEDURE. IF YOU HAVE THE BEOC, IT COULD
DRAIN INTO ANYTHING, A RADIO, OR WHATEVER. THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THAT IS
YOU ARE GOING TO SUCK THE VOLTAGE OUT FROM THE PHONE LINE INTO THE ELECTRICAL
APPLICENCE SO THERE WOULD BE NO VOLTAGE LEFT TO LOCK YOU IN WITH.
 1)TAKE THE CONNECTION CORD. EXAMINE THE PLUG AT THE END. IT SHOULD HAVE ONLY
TWO PRONGS, IF IT HAS THREE, STILL, DO NOT FEAR. MAKE SURE THE ELECTRICAL
APPLIENCE IS TURNED OFF UNLESS YOU WANNA BECOME A CRISPY CRITTER WHILE MAKING
THIS THING. MOST PLUG WILL HAVE A HARD PLASTIC DESIGN ON THE TOP OF THEM TO
PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING IN AT THE ELECTRICAL WIRES INSIDE. WELL, GET A NICE
AND REMOVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE PLUG (I DON'T SEE WHY...) THEN JUST CUT
THE TOP OFF.
 WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE, LOW AND BEHOLD, YOU WILL SEE THAT AT THE BASE OF THE 
PRONGS THERE ARE A FEW WIRES CONNECTING IN. THOSE WIRES CONDUCT THE POWER INTO
THE APPLIANCE. SO, YOU CAREFULLY UNWRAP THOSE FROM THE SIDES AND PULL THEM OUT
UNTIL THEY ARE ABOUT AND INCH AHEAD OF THE PRONGS. IF YOU WDON'T WANNA KEEP
THE JACK, THEN JUST RIP THE PRONGS OUT. IF YOU ARE, COVER THE PRONGS WITH
INSULTATION TAPE SO THEY WILL NOT CONNECT WITH THE WIRES WHEN THE POWER IS
BEING DRAINED FROM THE LINE.
 2)DO THE SAME THING WITH THE PRONGS ON THE OTHER PLUG, SO YOU HAVE THE WIRES
EVENLY CONNECTED. NOW, WRAP THE END OF THE WIRES AROUND EACH OTHER. IF YOU
HAPPEN TO HAVE THE OTHER END OF THE VOLTAGE CORD HOOKED INTO THE PHONE, STOP
READING NOW, YOUR TOO FUCKING STUPID TO CONTINUE.
 AFTER YOU'VE WRAPPED THE WIRES AROUND EAHC OTHER, THEN COVER THE WHOLE THING
WITH THE PLUGS WITH INSULATING TAPE. THEN, IF YOU BUILT YOUR OWN CONTROL BOX
OR IF YOU BOUGHT ONE, THEN CRAM ALL THE WIRES INTO THE AND RECLOSE IT. THAT
BOX IS YOUR TICKET OUT OF THIS.
 3)RE-CHECK EVERYTHING TO MAKE SURE IT'S ALL IN PLACE. THIS IS A PRETTY FLIMSY
CONNECTION, BUT ON LATER MODELS WHEN YOU GET MORE EXPERIENCED AT IT THEN YOU
CAN SAUDER AWAY AT IT AND FORM THE WHOLE DEVICE INTO ONE BIG BOX, WITH SOME
KIND OF CHEAP MATTEL HAND-HELD GAME INSUkjsoida.
 
 IN ORDER TO USE IT, JUST KEEP THIS BOX HANDY. PLUG IT INTO THE JACK IF YOU
WANT, BUT IT WILL SLIGHTLY LOWER THE VOLTAGE SO IT ISN'T CONNECTED. WHEN YOU
PLUG IT IN, IF YOU SEE SPARKS, UNPLUG IT AND RESTART THE WHOLE THING. BUT IF
IT JUST SEEMS FINE THEN LEAVE IT.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
 
 NOW, SO YOU HAVE THE WHOLE THING PLUGGED IN AND ALL... DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS
THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! WHEN THE TRACE HAS GONE ON, DON'T PANIC, UNPLUG
YOUR PHONE, AND TURN ON THE APPLIANCE THAT IT WAS HOOKED TO. IT WILL NEED
ENERGY TO TURN ITSELF ON, AND HERE'S A GREAT SOURCE... THE VOLTAGE TO KEEP
A PHONE LINE OPEN IS PRETTY SMALL AND A SIMPLE LIGHT BULB SHOULD DRAIN IT ALL
IN AND PROBABLY SHORT THE F.B.I. COMPUTER AT THE SAME TIME.

  [____________________________________________________________________]


 After creating system crushers and line-noise inducers for so long, I
decided to make something that would really appeal to all the anarchists
and phreaks out there who enjoy terrorizing people through the phone.
 Many months ago, I decided on this design as the "sure" thing to scare,
or even injure your enemies. The plans are simple, and easy to follow.
Make sure you read through once before you start.

Origin:
 Well a couple of my friends and I always go out phreaking on weekend
nights. After using dayglo [bud, wire tap, test kit,etc.] boxes, we were
bored and decided to move on to telephone terrorism. There are many ways
you can hurt people through the common telephone, or cause havoc in the
night. The following designs suggest a few, and as always, they are ready
for you to improve upon.

Assassin Box and line-surge injuries
__________________________________________________________________________

Materials needed for construction of Assassin Box:

1. One[1] common car battery or battery of equal voltage, must be portable
2. At least eight[8] feet of tough copper wire, preferable insulated
3. An AT&T test kit, or a splitter box connector [alligator clips,etc.]
4. A gunny sack, or leather bag to put battery in
5. Wire stripper, or raw telephone cord- Grade "G" AT&T manufacture

 There might be some extra stuff, I'll mention it in the construction.

Construction of Assassin box:

Step 1.
 First, take the test kit and strip it of any overhanging wire or extra
material. You might want to clean it off. Now get out that battery and your
copper wire. You'll see two terminals on the test kit, look like this:


                     *                     *
                     A                     B

Where A=positive tip, and B=negative tip. Now take about 4 feet of copper
wire and wire the A terminal to the positive bolt on the battery. Make sure
you've grounded yourself, and you should be wearing some kind of protection
against electricity. Next wire the B terminal and the negative bolt with
another four feet of wire. Don't cross wires, and let it hang down [test kit]
over the side of a table, with your battery on the table. Wrap all connections
with electric tape, or solder them if you want to.
  ï 7   3                     Step 2.
 This is the important part. You now just about have a working box. Put it
all in the bag or sack, and carry it with you [along with your supplies]
to your victim's house. Go to the back of the house, or on the side where
the Lighting & Power register is [metal box]. Now near that you should
find a little black, grey, or green, sometimes white, box with a pop-off
lid. Slide your hands underneath and pull the cover off. Note: I've seen
boxes where you have to unscrew it first. Almost all of them have the BELL
telephone logo on them. This is the connection box, or trunk connection, that
connects your house to Ma Bell's network.
Inside you will find four terminals...although some have five.
Here's how I label them.


                    *                           *
                    A                           B

                                 *
                                 E

                    *                           *
                    C                           D

Got it? Good... now look at the terminals closely. The ones for your use
will be C and D. Also, B and D might come in handy. The C terminal should
be connected to a red wire coming out of the house. The D should have a
green. If they don't, see which ones do. When you find them, get out your
assassin box [battery and test kit]. Now take the two prongs [alligator clips]
and attach the red one to the terminal with the red wire connected. Next take
the green [or black] prong and slip onto the terminal with the green wire
connected. You now have an operating assassin box. Just lay it down there,
or bury it in the ground [that's why it's in a sack].

Step 3.
 This final step is just a bunch of helpful things to do to hide your great
new box.
 1. If you haven't buried it, put grass all over and atop it. Make it look
like it's just a clump of grass, or a bush.
 2. IF it's buried, try to tape the wires together [Note: If they're not
insulated, don't worry about this part. Make sure the battery is well covered
and moisture cannot get to it. This might call for wrapping it up in
some form of cellophane or plastic cover-all.
 3. Put the cover BACK on the connection box, or close the door. If it has
a screwable cover, don't screw it back in. Just make sure it looks like
it's closed and secure.
 4. Now stand back about ten feet, and see if it's visible. If it is, then
do what is feasible to protect it.


End of construction.

Line-surge injuries with the Assassin box:

 The whole point of making an assassin box is to scare, or hurt your enemy.
No better way to do this than a shock of electricity right in the ear. Now  ï 7   3                     the box will send extra voltage through the line when your victim picks up
the phone [call coming through]. Note: this box sometimes causes funny
effects, like ringing a phone automatically [voltage surge], or messing up a
call. But most of the time it is effective.

Some sample scenarios:

 1. He [your victim] picks up the phone to dial. He might notice a tingling
vibration in his hand. Dial tone might be filled with static. As soon as
he dials, the earpiece will fill with static, and voltage will be applied
to the reciever and earpiece of the phone. This usually results in a
bad shock.
 2. This is more common. He will pick up the phone, and touch the keypad.
The KEYPAD will shock him. Now when a line goes into the phone, direct
current is applied for your call, while alternating current rings the bell
in the phone. Your 120 or so applied volts will most likely stay resident
in the bell or keypad area. When a button is pushed, it will come in
contact with the extra voltage, thus shock.
 3. Other things are always possible, like the destruction of vital circuitry
in the phone, which results in the defilement of the instrument.



 Well, that's just about it for this time. The plans will be effective, unless
you build it wrong, and I shouldn't be blamed for your total lack of electronic
skills. As always, here's a:

Ok the purpose of this box is to get Three-Way-Calling, Call Waiting,
programmable Call Forwarding, and an easier way of extended Bud Boxing ALL for
FREE.
 
 
Materials:
 
1) Wire stripers
2) Couple Feet Wire
3) AT&T/BELL Can
4) Hex Wrench
 
 
Idea: Ok the idea of this box is to get all of the above features by stealing
them from the fortunate ones on your block.
 
Procedure:
 
Step 1) Find AT&T/BELL Can that is being used to service you surrounding area.
 
Step 2) Open can with Hex wrench.
 
Step 3) Find your line and another persons line who has 3-way, Call
(waiting/forwarding), if the # of all the lines are not listed in the box you
will have to use your local ANI to find them.
 
Step 4) Once you have found the lines then wire the (Black & Yellow) wires on
the victims line to the (Black & Yellow) wires on you line (Be sure your phone
at home uses all 4 wire as some of the cheap phones don't).
 
Step 5) Then disconnect the victims (Black & Yellow) Wires, resulting the the
loss of these features to their line ( you mat want to leave these wires
connected, this may or may not cause problems I haven't tried it that may yet).
 
 
Well That Sums It Up!
 
 
Procedure for easier extended Bud Box.
 
If if for some reason your line is disconnected, or you just want to use hook
someone's line to your line for fearless phreaking follow the procedure below.
 
Ok Go to the local can and find a line that is used by weekend visitors or a
summer/winter home, and hook their (Red & Green) Wires to your (Red & Green)
Wires, and your off into the fearless world of phreaking ( i recommend you
phreak from these line, so that the owners don't get uptight and look into the
matter), unless of course you are doing it for revenge!
 
 
Some Suggestions:
 
Take a Bud box Along to do a ANI just to make sure you have the right line,
also in some cases you will have to switch between the (Red/Green)
(Black/Yellow) or any other combination  if your area has changed the standard
format which id very unlikely.
 
                       The Poor Man's 2600 Hertz!! 
 
What the hell could I be talking about!?!?  Well, let's say you're really hard
up (not in your usual sense, this time).  You really need to make 2600 Hertz
so you can have lotsa phun on the trunk lines, right?  But your mom and dad
didn't give you a blue box for Christmas- just an Apple!  And of course you
don't have a nice precision music card (like mine) or an Apple Cat.  So what
the hell can you do?  Well, you're not out of it yet.  You, too, can make 2600
Hertz!  Yes, that's right!  With  NO  additional hardware!  Try and beat
that with a stick (or your fist even for that matter).  And I bet you've even
figured out that I'm about to tell you just how to do this.  Well, you're
right!  EVERYBODY KNOWS... that at $FCA8, there's a little routine called 
"WAIT".  We are going to use that to produce the needed delay in the 
production of our tone.  Yes, you will have to use a little machine language.
But I'm going to show you exactly what to type here.  So even you, yes YOU
Poindexter, can get this right!  Here's all you do...
 
If you have an Apple //e with the enhancement installed, just type CALL-151 
from BASIC and get into the monitor.  From there, hit a "!" to use the mini-
assembler.  Enter this exactly as it appears...
 
!1000: LDX $C030
! LDA #$06
! JSR $FCA8
! JMP $1000
 
And there you have it!  Hit <RET> to get back to the monitor.  Then, type 
"1000G" and listen to that beautiful tone!  Not EXACTLY 2600 Hz, but close
enough to do the trick!
 
For you non-enhanced types, you can just load up INTEGER BASIC (Ha!) and type
"F666G" from the monitor and use the mini-assembler there.  After typing the
above code in, type "$FF69G" to return to the monitor, and proceed as above.
You would do that on a ][+, too (people still use those!?).
 
In all cases, just hit RESET to shut the thing up!  Use it as you will.  In 
case you didn't know, you can use that tone to reset SPRINT, MCI, etc. nodes
to there dial tone.  That way, you don't have to keep punching in your local
number first.  Just type the code and go!  Pretty nice.  Well, you can learn
what to do from all the philes around about blue boxing.  2600 Hz doesn't
work on 800 numbers here anymore.  SHIT!  What's going on?  ESS?  Well, if you
live in ESS, don't try this!  They'll snag your little butt fer sher!  Then 
it's off to reform school for you!  Well, have phun!  And remember...
 
I didn't tell you this!

                         BUILDING A RED BOX
                         by JR "Bob" Dobbs


   Essentially,the red box is a device used to fool the phone company
into thinking you are depositing coins into a payphone.  Every time you
drop a coin into a payphone, the phone signals the type of coin inserted
with one or more bursts of a combination of 1700hz and 2200hz.  The tone
bursts are coded as follows:
Nickel:One 60 millisecond pulse
Dime  :Two 60 millisecond pulses separated by 60 milliseconds
Quarter:Five 35 millisecond pulses separated by 35 milliseconds


                         HOW TO USE IT
                         -------------

   Operation is simple.  Simply dial a long distance number (some areas
require you to stick in a genuine nickel first), wait for the ACTS
computer to demand your cash, and press the "deposit" button on the red
box for each coin you want to simulate.  The coin signals are coupled
from the red box into the phone with a small speaker held to the
mouthpiece.  For local calls, either you must first deposit a genuine
nickel before "simulating" more coins or place your call through the
operator with 0 + 7d.  Use some care when the operator is on the
line--sometimes they catch on to your beeper ploy.


                         CIRCUIT OPERATION
                         -----------------

   Each time the pushbutton is pressed, it triggers half of IC1,
configured as a monostable multivibrator to energize the rest of the
circuit for a length of time determined by the setting of the coin
selector switch.  This in turn starts the other half of IC1, configured
as an astable multivibrator, pulsing on and off at regular intervals at
a rate determined by the 50k pot between pins 12 and 13.  The output of
the astable thus alternately powers of IC2, configured as a square wave
oscillator, providing the required 1700hz and 2200hz to the op amp which
acts as a buffer to drive the speaker.


                         CONSTRUCTION
                         ------------

   Assemble the circuit as you wish.  Component placement is not
critical.  I found the easiest method was to use point-to-point wiring
on a "universal" PC grid board with solder ringed holes.  Use sockets if
you aren't a whiz with a soldering iron.  Be sure to leave easy access
to the potentiometers for alignment.


                         ALIGNMENT AND TESTING
                         ---------------------

   For alignment, a frequency counter and tiggered sweep oscilloscope
are extremely handy (but not absolutely necessary.)

   Install a temporary jumper from +9v supply to pin 14 of IC2 and
temporarily disconnect the 0.01uF capacitors from pins 5 and 9 of IC2.
Power up the circuit.  Measuring the output from pin 5 of IC2 with the
frequency counter, adjust the 20k pot between pins 1 and 6 for an output
of 1700hz.  Now adjust the 20k pot between pins 8 and 13 for an output
of 2200hz from pin 9 of IC2.  Remove the temporary jumper and re-attach
the capacitors to pins 5 and 9.  (Note: if no frequency counter is
available, the outputs can be adjusted by ear one at a time by
zero-beating the output tone with a computer generated tone of known
precision.)

   Next, temporarily disconnect the wire between pins 5 and 10 of IC1.
Set coin selector switch in the "N" (nickel) position.  With the
oscilloscope measuring the output from pin 9 of IC1, adjust the 50k pot
between pins 12 and 13 of IC1 for output pulses of 60 millisecond
duration.  Reconnect the wire between pins 5 and 10.  (Note: If no scope
is available, adjust the pulse rate by ear using computer generated
tones for comparison.)

   The remaining adjustments are made by ear.

   Leave the selector switch in the "N" position.  Adjust the 50k pot
labelled "Dime" for a quick double beep each time the pushbutton is
pressed.

   Finally, set the selector to "Quarter".  Adjust the 50k pot labelled
"Quarter" until exactly 5 very quick beeps are heard for each button
press.  Don't worry if the quarter beeps sound shorter and faster than
the nickel and dime ones.  They should be.



                         CONCLUSION
                         ----------

   If all went well to this point, your red box should be completely
aligned and functional.  A final test should now be conducted from a
payphone using the DATL (dial access test line) coin test.  Dial
09591230 and follow the computer instructions using the red box at the
proper prompts.  The computer should correctly identify all coins
"simulated" and flag any anomalies.  With a little discretion, your red

Description of Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The control office for Emergency 911 service is assigned in accordance with
the existing standard guidelines to one of the following centers:

   o  Special Services Center (SSC)      o  Major Accounts Center (MAC)
   o  Serving Test Center (STC)          o  Toll Control Center (TCC)

The SSC/MAC designation is used in this document interchangeably for any of
these four centers.  The Special Services Centers (SSCs) or Major Account
Centers (MACs) have been designated as the trouble reporting contact for all
E911 customer (PSAP) reported troubles.  Subscribers who have trouble on an
E911 call will continue to contact local repair service (CRSAB) who will refer
the trouble to the SSC/MAC, when appropriate.

Due to the critical nature of E911 service, the control and timely repair of
troubles is demanded.  As the primary E911 customer contact, the SSC/MAC is in
the unique position to monitor the status of the trouble and insure its
resolution.

System Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The number 911 is intended as a nationwide universal telephone number which
provides the public with direct access to a Public Safety Answering Point
(PSAP).  A PSAP is also referred to as an Emergency Service Bureau (ESB).  A
PSAP is an agency or facility which is authorized by a municipality to receive
and respond to police, fire and/or ambulance services.  One or more attendants
are located at the PSAP facilities to receive and handle calls of an emergency
nature in accordance with the local municipal requirements.

An important advantage of E911 emergency service is improved (reduced) response
times for emergency services.  Also close coordination among agencies providing
various emergency services is a valuable capability provided by E911 service.

1A ESS is used as the tandem office for the E911 network to route all 911 calls
to the correct (primary) PSAP designated to serve the calling station.  The
E911 feature was developed primarily to provide routing to the correct PSAP for
all 911 calls.  Selective routing allows a 911 call originated from a
particular station located in a particular district, zone, or town, to be
routed to the primary PSAP designated to serve that customer station regardless
of wire center boundaries.  Thus, selective routing eliminates the problem of
wire center boundaries not coinciding with district or other political
boundaries.

The services available with the E911 feature include:

      Forced Disconnect         Default Routing
      Alternative Routing       Night Service
      Selective Routing         Automatic Number Id entification (ANI)
      Selective Transfer        Automatic Location Identification (ALI)


Preservice/Installation Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   When a contract for an E911 system has been signed, it is the responsibility
of Network Marketing to establish an implementation/cutover committee which
should include a representative from the SSC/MAC.  Duties of the E911
Implementation Team include coordination of all phases of the E911 system
deployment and the formation of an on-going E911 maintenance subcommittee.

Marketing is responsible for providing the following customer specific
information to the SSC/MAC prior to the start of call through testing:

 o  All PSAP's (name, address, local contact)
 o  All PSAP circuit ID's
 o  1004 911 service request including PSAP details on each PSAP
    (1004 Section  K, L, M)
 o  Network configuration
 o  Any vendor information (name, telephone number, equipment)

The SSC/MAC needs to know if the equipment and sets at the PSAP are maintained
by the BOCs, an independent company, or an outside vendor, or any combination.
This information is then entered on the PSAP profile sheets and reviewed
quarterly for changes, additions and deletions.

Marketing will secure the Major Account Number (MAN) and provide this number to
Corporate Communications so that the initial issue of the service orders carry
the MAN and can be tracked by the SSC/MAC via CORDNET.  PSAP circuits are
official services by definition.

All service orders required for the installation of the E911 system should
include the MAN assigned to the city/county which has purchased the system.

In accordance with the basic SSC/MAC strategy for provisioning, the SSC/MAC
will be Overall Control Office (OCO) for all Node to PSAP circuits (official
services) and any other services for this customer.  Training must be scheduled
for all SSC/MAC involved personnel during the pre-service stage of the project.

The E911 Implementation Team will form the on-going maintenance subcommittee
prior to the initial implementation of the E911 system.  This sub-committee
will establish post implementation quality assurance procedures to ensure that
the E911 system continues to provide quality service to the customer.
Customer/Company training, trouble reporting interfaces for the customer,
telephone company and any involved independent telephone companies needs to be
addressed and implemented prior to E911 cutover.  These functions can be best
addressed by the formation of a sub-committee of the E911 Implementation Team
to set up guidelines for and to secure service commitments of interfacing
organizations.  A SSC/MAC supervisor should chair this subcommittee and include
the following organizations:

1) Switching Control Center
      - E911 translations
      - Trunking
      - End office and Tandem office hardware/software
2) Recent Change Memory Administration Center
      - Daily RC update activity for TN/ESN translations
      - Processes validity errors and rejects 3) Line and Number Administration
      - Verification of TN/ESN translations 4) Special Service Center/Major
        Account Center
      - Single point of contact for all PSAP and Node to host troubles
      - Logs, tracks & statusing of all trouble reports
      - Trouble referral, follow up, and escalation
      - Customer notification of status and restoration
      - Analyzation of "chronic" troubles
      - Testing, installation and maintenance of E911 circuits 5) Installation
        and Maintenance (SSIM/I&M)
     - Repair and maintenance of PSAP equipment and Telco owned sets 6)
       Minicomputer Maintenance Operations Center
     - E911 circuit maintenance (where applicable) 7) Area Maintenance Engineer
     - Technical assistance on voice (CO-PSAP) network related E911 troubles


Maintenance Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The CCNC will test the Node circuit from the 202T at the Host site to the
202T at the Node site.  Since Host to Node (CCNC to MMOC) circuits are official
company services, the CCNC will refer all Node circuit troubles to the SSC/MAC.
The SSC/MAC is responsible for the testing and follow up to restoration of
these circuit troubles.

Although Node to PSAP circuit are official services, the MMOC will refer PSAP
circuit troubles to the appropriate SSC/MAC.  The SSC/MAC is responsible for
testing and follow up to restoration of PSAP circuit troubles.

The SSC/MAC will also receive reports from CRSAB/IMC(s) on subscriber 911
troubles when they are not line troubles.  The SSC/MAC is responsible for
testing and restoration of these troubles.

Maintenance responsibilities are as follows:

SCC*            Voice Network (ANI to PSAP)                 *SCC responsible
for tandem switch SSIM/I&M        PSAP Equipment (Modems, CIU's, sets)
Vendor          PSAP Equipment (when CPE) SSC/MAC         PSAP to Node
circuits, and tandem to PSAP voice circuits (EMNT) MMOC            Node site
(Modems, cables, etc)

Note:  All above work groups are required to resolve troubles by
interfacing        with appropriate work groups for resolution.

The Switching Control Center (SCC) is responsible for E911/1AESS translations
in tandem central offices.  These translations route E911 calls, selective
transfer, default routing, speed calling, etc., for each PSAP.  The SCC is also
responsible for troubleshooting on the voice network (call originating to end
office tandem equipment).

For example, ANI failures in the originating offices would be a responsibility
of the SCC.

Recent Change Memory Administration Center (RCMAC) performs the daily tandem
translation updates (recent change) for routing of individual telephone
numbers.

Recent changes are generated from service order activity (new service, address
changes, etc.) and compiled into a daily file by the E911 Center (ALI/DMS E911
Computer).

SSIM/I&M is responsible for the installation and repair of PSAP equipment. PSAP
equipment includes ANI Controller, ALI Controller, data sets, cables, sets, and
other peripheral equipment that is not vendor owned.  SSIM/I&M is responsible
for establishing maintenance test kits, complete with spare parts for PSAP
maintenance.  This includes test gear, data sets, and ANI/ALI Controller parts.

Special Services Center (SSC) or Major Account Center (MAC) serves as the
trouble reporting contact for all (PSAP) troubles reported by customer.  The
SSC/MAC refers troubles to proper organizations for handling and tracks status
of troubles, escalating when necessary.  The SSC/MAC will close out troubles
with customer.  The SSC/MAC will analyze all troubles and tracks "chronic" PSAP
troubles.

Corporate Communications Network Center (CCNC) will test and refer troubles on
all node to host circuits.  All E911 circuits are classified as official
company property.

The Minicomputer Maintenance Operations Center (MMOC) maintains the E911
(ALI/DMS) computer hardware at the Host site.  This MMOC is also responsible
for monitoring the system and reporting certain PSAP and system problems to the
local MMOC's, SCC's or SSC/MAC's.  The MMOC personnel also operate software
programs that maintain the TN data base under the direction of the E911 Center.
The maintenance of the NODE computer (the interface between the PSAP and the
ALI/DMS computer) is a function of the MMOC at the NODE site.  The MMOC's at
the NODE sites may also be involved in the testing of NODE to Host circuits.
The MMOC will also assist on Host to PSAP and data network related troubles not
resolved through standard trouble clearing procedures.

Installation And Maintenance Center (IMC) is responsible for referral of E911
subscriber troubles that are not subscriber line problems.

E911 Center - Performs the role of System Administration and is responsible for
overall operation of the E911 computer software.  The E911 Center does A-Z
trouble analysis and provides statistical information on the performance of the
system.

This analysis includes processing PSAP inquiries (trouble reports) and referral
of network troubles.  The E911 Center also performs daily processing of tandem
recent change and provides information to the RCMAC for tandem input.  The E911
Center is responsible for daily processing of the ALI/DMS computer data base
and provides error files, etc. to the Customer Services department for
investigation and correction.  The E911 Center participates in all system
implementations and on-going maintenance effort and assists in the development
of procedures, training and education of information to all groups.

Any group receiving a 911 trouble from the SSC/MAC should close out the trouble
with the SSC/MAC or provide a status if the trouble has been referred to
another group.  This will allow the SSC/MAC to provide a status back to the
customer or escalate as appropriate.

Any group receiving a trouble from the Host site (MMOC or CCNC) should close
the trouble back to that group.

The MMOC should notify the appropriate SSC/MAC when the Host, Node, or all Node
circuits are down so that the SSC/MAC can reply to customer reports that may be
called in by the PSAPs.  This will eliminate duplicate reporting of troubles.
On complete outages the MMOC will follow escalation procedures for a Node after
two (2) hours and for a PSAP after four (4) hours.  Additionally the MMOC will
notify the appropriate SSC/MAC when the Host, Node, or all Node circuits are
down.

The PSAP will call the SSC/MAC to report E911 troubles.  The person reporting
the E911 trouble may not have a circuit I.D. and will therefore report the PSAP
name and address.  Many PSAP troubles are not circuit specific.  In those
instances where the caller cannot provide a circuit I.D., the SSC/MAC will be
required to determine the circuit I.D. using the PSAP profile.  Under no
circumstances will the SSC/MAC Center refuse to take the trouble.  The E911
trouble should be handled as quickly as possible, with the SSC/MAC providing as
much assistance as possible while taking the trouble report from the caller.

The SSC/MAC will screen/test the trouble to determine the appropriate handoff
organization based on the following criteria:

    PSAP equipment problem:  SSIM/I&M     Circuit problem:  SSC/MAC     Voice
network problem:  SCC (report trunk group number)     Problem affecting
multiple PSAPs (No ALI report from all PSAPs):
Contact                                      the MMOC to check for NODE or
Host                                      computer problems before further
testing.

The SSC/MAC will track the status of reported troubles and escalate as
appropriate.  The SSC/MAC will close out customer/company reports with the
initiating contact.  Groups with specific maintenance responsibilities, defined
above, will investigate "chronic" troubles upon request from the SSC/MAC and
the ongoing maintenance subcommittee.

All "out of service" E911 troubles are priority one type reports.  One link
down to a PSAP is considered a priority one trouble and should be handled as if
the PSAP was isolated.

The PSAP will report troubles with the ANI controller, ALI controller or set
equipment to the SSC/MAC.

NO ANI:  Where the PSAP reports NO ANI (digital display screen is blank) ask if
this condition exists on all screens and on all calls.  It is important to
differentiate between blank screens and screens displaying 911-00XX, or all
zeroes.

When the PSAP reports all screens on all calls, ask if there is any voice
contact with callers.  If there is no voice contact the trouble should be
referred to the SCC immediately since 911 calls are not getting through which
may require alternate routing of calls to another PSAP.

When the PSAP reports this condition on all screens but not all calls and has
voice contact with callers, the report should be referred to SSIM/I&M for
dispatch.  The SSC/MAC should verify with the SCC that ANI is pulsing before
dispatching SSIM.

When the PSAP reports this condition on one screen for all calls (others work
fine) the trouble should be referred to SSIM/I&M for dispatch, because the
trouble is isolated to one piece of equipment at the customer premise.

An ANI failure (i.e. all zeroes) indicates that the ANI has not been received
by the PSAP from the tandem office or was lost by the PSAP ANI controller.  The
PSAP may receive "02" alarms which can be caused by the ANI controller logging
more than three all zero failures on the same trunk.  The PSAP has been
instructed to report this condition to the SSC/MAC since it could indicate an
equipment trouble at the PSAP which might be affecting all subscribers calling
into the PSAP.  When all zeroes are being received on all calls or "02" alarms
continue, a tester should analyze the condition to determine the appropriate
action to be taken.  The tester must perform cooperative testing with the SCC
when there appears to be a problem on the Tandem-PSAP trunks before requesting
dispatch.

When an occasional all zero condition is reported, the SSC/MAC should dispatch
SSIM/I&M to routine equipment on a "chronic" troublesweep.

The PSAPs are instructed to report incidental ANI failures to the BOC on a PSAP
inquiry trouble ticket (paper) that is sent to the Customer Services E911 group
and forwarded to E911 center when required.  This usually involves only a
particular telephone number and is not a condition that would require a report
to the SSC/MAC.  Multiple ANI failures which our from the same end office (XX
denotes end office), indicate a hard trouble condition may exist in the end
office or end office tandem trunks.  The PSAP will report this type of
condition to the SSC/MAC and the SSC/MAC should refer the report to the SCC
responsible for the tandem office.  NOTE: XX is the ESCO (Emergency Service
Number) associated with the incoming 911 trunks into the tandem.  It is
important that the C/MAC tell the SCC what is displayed at the PSAP (i.e.
911-0011) which indicates to the SCC which end office is in trouble.

Note:  It is essential that the PSAP fill out inquiry form on every ANI
failure.

The PSAP will report a trouble any time an address is not received on an
address display (screen blank) E911 call.  (If a record is not in the 911 data
base or an ANI failure is encountered, the screen will provide a display
noticing such condition).  The SSC/MAC should verify with the PSAP whether the
NO ALI condition is on one screen or all screens.

When the condition is on one screen (other screens receive ALI information) the
SSC/MAC will request SSIM/I&M to dispatch.

If no screens are receiving ALI information, there is usually a circuit trouble
between the PSAP and the Host computer.  The SSC/MAC should test the trouble
and refer for restoral.

Note:  If the SSC/MAC receives calls from multiple PSAP's, all of which
are        receiving NO ALI, there is a problem with the Node or Node to
Host        circuits or the Host computer itself.  Before referring the trouble
the        SSC/MAC should call the MMOC to inquire if the Node or Host is
in        trouble.

Alarm conditions on the ANI controller digital display at the PSAP are to be
reported by the PSAP's.  These alarms can indicate various trouble conditions
o so the SSC/MAC should ask the PSAP if any portion of the E911 system is not
functioning properly.

The SSC/MAC should verify with the PSAP attendant that the equipment's primary
function is answering E911 calls.  If it is, the SSC/MAC should request a
dispatch SSIM/I&M.  If the equipment is not primarily used for E911, then the
SSC/MAC should advise PSAP to contact their CPE vendor.

Note:  These troubles can be quite confusing when the PSAP has vendor
equipment        mixed in with equipment that the BOC maintains.  The
Marketing        representative should provide the SSC/MAC information
concerning any        unusual or exception items where the PSAP should contact
their vendor.        This information should be included in the PSAP profile
sheets.

ANI or ALI controller down:  When the host computer sees the PSAP equipment
down and it does not come back up, the MMOC will report the trouble to the
SSC/MAC; the equipment is down at the PSAP, a dispatch will be required.

PSAP link (circuit) down:  The MMOC will provide the SSC/MAC with the circuit
ID that the Host computer indicates in trouble.  Although each PSAP has two
circuits, when either circuit is down the condition must be treated as an
emergency since failure of the second circuit will cause the PSAP to be
isolated.

Any problems that the MMOC identifies from the Node location to the Host
computer will be handled directly with the appropriate MMOC(s)/CCNC.

Note:  The customer will call only when a problem is apparent to the
PSAP.        When only one circuit is down to the PSAP, the customer may not be
aware        there is a trouble, even though there is one link down,
notification        should appear on the PSAP screen.  Troubles called into the
SSC/MAC from        the MMOC or other company employee should not be closed out
by calling        the PSAP since it may result in the customer responding that
they do not        have a trouble.  These reports can only be closed out by
receiving        information that the trouble was fixed and by checking with
the company        employee that reported the trouble.  The MMOC personnel will
be able to        verify that the trouble has cleared by reviewing a printout
from the        host.

When the CRSAB receives a subscriber complaint (i.e., cannot dial 911) the RSA
should obtain as much information as possible while the customer is on the
line.

For example, what happened when the subscriber dialed 911?  The report is
automatically directed to the IMC for subscriber line testing.  When no line
trouble is found, the IMC will refer the trouble condition to the SSC/MAC.  The
SSC/MAC will contact Customer Services E911 Group and verify that the
subscriber should be able to call 911 and obtain the ESN.  The SSC/MAC will
verify the ESN via 2SCCS.  When both verifications match, the SSC/MAC will
refer the report to the SCC responsible for the 911 tandem office for
investigation and resolution.  The MAC is responsible for tracking the trouble
and informing the IMC when it is resolved.

E911 - Enhanced 911:  Features available include selective routing,
selective        transfer, fixed transfer, alternate routing, default routing,
Automatic        Number Display, Automatic Location Identification, night
service,        default routing, call detail record.

End Office - Telephone central office which provides dial tone to the
             subscriber calling 911.
The "end office" provides ANI (Automatic Number Identification) to the tandem
office.

Tandem Office
 - Telephone central office which serves as a tandem (or hub)
for all 911 calls.  Must be a 1AESS type of central office.
The tandem office translations contain the TN/ESN relationships
which route the 911 call to the proper SAP.  The tandem office
looks up the ANI (TN) that it receives from the end office and
finds the ESN (routing information) which corresponds to a
seven digit number ringing in at a PSAP.

PSAP - Public Safety Answering Point, usually the police, fire and/or
rescue        groups as determined by the local municipalities.  A "ringin"
will not        have ANI or ALI capabilities, but just receives calls or
transferred        calls from another PSAP.

ESN - Emergency Service Number (XXX) that is assigned to the subscriber's
telephone number in the tandem office translations The ESN represents a
seven digit number by which the tandem office routes the call to the
proper PSAP.  PSAPs with ALI capabilities also receive a display of the
ESN information which shows which police, fire and rescue agency serves
the telephone number calling 911.  An ESN is a unique combination of
police, fire, and rescue service for purposes of routing the E911 call.

ANI - Automatic Number Identification corresponds to the subscriber's
seven       digit telephone number.  The ANI displays at the PSAP on the
digital ANI       display console.

ALI - Automatic Location Identification provides for an address display of
the       subscriber calling 911.  With ALI, the PSAP receives the ANI display
and       an ALI display on a screen.  The ALI display includes the
subscriber's       address, community, state, type of service and if a
business, the name of       the business.  The PSAP will also get a display of
the associated ESN       information (police, fire, rescue).

Selective Routing - The capability to route a call to the particular
PSAP                     serving the address associated with the TN making the
911                     call.  Selective routing is achieved by building
TN/ESN                     translations in the tandem central office.
These                     translations are driven by the E911 data base which
assigns                     the ESN to each telephone number based on the
customer's                     address.  Service order activity keeps the E911
data base                     updated.  The E911 data base, in turn, generates
recent                     change to the tandem office (through the SCC or
RCMAC) to                     update the TN/ESN translations in the tandem data
base.

Selective Transfer - Provides the PSAP with the ability to transfer
the                      incoming 911 call to a fire or rescue service for
the                      particular number calling 911 by pushing one button
for                      fire or rescue.  For example, if an incoming 911 call
was                      reporting a fire, the PSAP operator would push the
fire                      button on the ANI console; the call would go back to
the                      tandem office, do a lookup for the seven digit
number                      associated with fire department, for the ESN
assigned to                      the calling TN, and automatically route the
call to that                      fire department.  This differs from "fixed"
transfer which                      routes every call to the same fire or
rescue number                      whenever the fire or rescue button is
pushed.  The PSAP                      equipment is optioned to provide either
fixed or selective                      transfer capabilities.

Alternate Routing - Alternate routing provides for a predetermined routing
for                     911 calls when the tandem office is unable to route
the                     calls over the 911 trunks for a particular PSAP due
to                     troubles or all trunks busy.

Default Routing - Provides for routing of 911 calls when there is an
ANI                   failure.  The call will be routed to the "default"
ESN                   associated with the he NNX the caller is calling
from.                   Default ESNs are preassigned in translations and are
usually                   the predominant ESN for a given wire center.

Night Service - Night service works the same as alternate routing in that
the                 calls coming into a given PSAP will automatically be routed
to                 another preset PSAP when all trunks are made busy due to
the                 PSAP closing down for the night.

Call Detail Record - When the 911 call is terminated by the PSAP operator,
the                      ANI will automatically print-out on the
teletypewriter                      located at the PSAP.  The printout will
contain the time                      the call came into the PSAP, the time it
was picked up by                      an operator, the operator number, the
time the call was                      transferred, if applicable, the time the
call was                      terminated and the trunk group number associated
with the                      call.  Printouts of the ALI display are now
also                      available, if the PSAP has purchased the
required                      equipment.

ANI Failure - Failure of the end office to identify the call and provide
the               ANI (telephone number) to the tandem office; or, an ANI
failure               between the tandem office and the PSAP.

Misroute - Any condition that results in the 911 call going to the wrong
PSAP.            A call can be misrouted if the ESN and associated
routing            information are incorrect in the E911 data base and/or
tandem data            base.  A call can also be misrouted if the call is an
ANI failure,            which automatically default routes.

Anonymous Call - If a subscriber misdials and dials the seven digit
number                  associated with the PSAP position, they will come in
direct                  and ANI display as 911-0000 which will ALI as an
anonymous                  call.  The seven digit numbers associated with the
PSAP                  positions are not published even to the PSAPs.

Spurious 911 Call - Occasionally, the PSAP will get a call that is
not                     associated with a subscriber dialing 911 for an
emergency.                     It could be a subscriber who has not dialed 911,
but is                     dialing another number, or has just picked up their
phone                     and was connected with the PSAP.  These problems
are                     equipment related, particularly when the calls
originate                     from electromechanical or step by step offices,
and are                     reported by the E911 Center to Network Operations
upon                     receipt of the PSAP inquiry reporting the trouble.
The                     PSAP may get a call and no one is there; if they call
the                     number back, the number may be disconnected or no one
home.                     Again these are network troubles and must be
investigated.                     Cordless telephones can also generate
"spurious" calls in                     to the PSAPs.  Generally, the PSAP will
hear conversation                     on the line, but the subscribers are not
calling 911.  The                     PSAP may report spurious calls to to
repair if they become                     bothersome, for example, the same
number ringing in                     continually.

No Displays - A condition where the PSAP ALI display screen is blank.
This               type of trouble should be reported immediately to the
SSC/MAC.               If all screens at the PSAP are blank, it is an
indication that               the problem is in the circuits from the PSAP to
the E911               computer.  If more than one PSAP is experiencing no
display, it               may be a problem with the Node computer or the E911
computer.               The SSC/MAC should contact the MMOC to determine the
health of               the HOST computer.

Record Not Found - If the host computer is unable to do a look up on a
given                    ANI request from the PSAP, it will forward a Record
Not                    Found message to the PSA ALI screen.  This is caused
by                    service order activity for a given subscriber not
being                    processed into the E911 data base, or HOST computer
system                    problems whereby the record cannot be accessed at
that point                    in time.

No ANI - This condition means the PSAP received a call, but no telephone
number          displayed on the ANI console.  The PSAP should report this
condition          immediately to the SSC/MAC.

PSAP Not Receiving Calls - If a PSAP cannot receive calls or request
retrievals                            from the E911 host computer, i.e., cable
cut, the                            calls into that PSAP must be rerouted to
another                            PSAP.  The Switching Control Center must be
notified                            to reroute the calls in the tandem office
E911                            translations.

MSAG - Master Street Address Guide.  The MSAG ledgers are controlled by
the        municipality which has purchased the E911 ALI service, in that
they        assign which police, fire or rescue agency will serve a given
street and        number range.  They do this by assigning an ESN to each
street range,        odd, even, community that is populated in the county or
municipality        served.  These MSAGs are then used as a filter for service
order        activity into the E911 computer data base to assign ESNs to
individual        TN records.  This insures that each customer will be routed
to the        correct agency for their particular address.  In a non-ALI
County, TAR        codes are used by the Telephone company to assign ESNs to
service        conductivity and the County does not control the ESN
assignment.  TAR        codes represent the taxing authority for the given
subscriber which        should correspond to their police, fire and rescue
agencies.  The MG        method, of course, is more accurate because it is
using the actual        service address of the customer to route the call and
provides the        county with more flexibility in assigning fire and rescue
district, etc.        The Customer Services E911 Group maintains the E911
computer data base        and interfaces with the County (customer) on all MSAG
or data base        activity.
