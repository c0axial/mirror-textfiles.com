In the mythology and symbolism of our name, "Lucifer" is not to be
confused with ha-Satan, the mythological source of evil.  Lucifer's
ancient identity was a bearer of light, the morning star, and it is
as such that this journal intends to publish.

As the religion virus depends on obscurity, obfuscation, confusion,
irrationality and darkness in order to flourish, it is natural that
it would see light as an enemy.  Rational, skeptical inquiry has
ever been the enemy of all religions and is ultimately fatal to all
gods.

The purpose of this magazine is to provide a source of articles
dealing with many aspects of humanism.  Humanists have been
vilified by the religious as immoral.  Apparently, the most
horrible thing they can think of is an atheist.

As we find their values, such as faith in the non-existent,
obedience to the imaginary and reverence of the ridiculous,
repulsive, we adopt the name of their ancient antagonist with
pride.

We are atheistic as we do not believe in the actual existence of
any supernatural beings or any transcendental reality.

We are secular because the evidence of history and the daily
horrors in the news show the pernicious and destructive
consequences of allowing religions to be involved with politics and
nationalism.

We are humanists and we focus on what is good for humanity, in the
real world.  We will not be put off with offers of pie in the sky,
bye and bye.

===================================================================

Can a Christian be a moral person?

Generally speaking it is not possible for a Christian to be a
completely moral person, as history bears out, for the following
reasons:

Many Christians have believed in predestination, therefore they
feel that they are not responsible for their actions, as God has
destined what these are to be and what the consequences are.

Many Christians believe in demonic possession, therefore they feel
that they are not personally responsible for their actions, but can
blame what they have done on possession by an evil spirit.

Christians do not understand the difference between damage, harm
and simple violation of taboo.  They equate a harmless act, such as
masturbation, or heavy petting, with a harmful crime such as theft,
rape or murder.  As these are all equally "sinful" to the Christian
mind, they cannot be trusted to refrain from criminal activities.

Christians believe that they have been forgiven in advance for all
of the sins that they may commit.  All a Christian has to do is
"believe in Jesus Christ" and the Christian's sins are forgiven. 
Over the centuries, this horrifying doctrine has been responsible
for innumerable criminal acts by Christians who believe they can
"sin" and evade responsibility through confession or believing
afterwards.

Christians believe that the "afterlife" is more important than the
real world.  They feel that any injustices they may commit will be
straightened out in some supernatural way, so it is not necessary
to try to fix things here and now.

Christians believe that they can find an accurate guide to their
code of conduct in a 2,000 year old book, which favors slavery,
misogyny, tyranny and religious intolerance, but contains no
reference to environmental caretaking, population control or
democratic civic responsibility.  With no incentive to be good
citizens or to make this a better world, many Christian groups live
a hermit-like existence, divorced from society, or as
uncomprehending parasites on society.

Christians are taught that they are sheep, and that their "pastor"
or shepherd is the one ultimately responsible for their actions. 
They are specifically relieved from rationally thinking about the
consequences of their religious doctrines and are taught not to
question religious or civic authority but, rather, to delude
themselves by pretending that everything is OK.  This is called
"faith."

Christians believe that "God's Law" is higher than "man's law." 
Therefore they feel that they can violate national and local
criminal codes with impunity.  No Christian can really be trusted
hold a position of responsibility in government or law enforcement,
as they do not believe in enforcing merely "man-made" laws.  Many
Christians have gladly committed murder and other heinous acts,
justifying their actions as defence of "God's Law," or "punishing
sinners."

Christians routinely practice discrimination against non-
Christians, believing themselves to be superior.  Christians
constantly attempt to divert public tax money to specifically
Christian purposes.  Christians attempt to force others to abide by
their taboos, such as forcing people to observe the sabbath, to
pretend to pray, or to practice Christian sexual morality.  As
well, they have denied everyone access to information on
contraception and abortion, and censored or destroyed works of art
and literature.

Christians believe that their religious organization (the "church")
is more important than the state.  When the laws of the state
conflict with the taboos of their church, they will violate the
laws of the state.  When men in their church organization violate
the laws of the state, Christians attempt to exempt them from
justice.  If they are in the law enforcement system, they conspire
to evade the law.

Visions; talking to invisible entities; superstition; inability (or
refusal) to understand history, geology, cosmology and biology;
complete misunderstanding of causality; glorification of ignorance
and denigration of reason; all point to the pernicious effects of
this deleterious doctrine on the minds of its deluded followers.

Not all of the reasons stated above apply to every Christian, and,
of course, some Christians have lead reasonably crime-free lives
despite the teachings of their religion.  However, it is likely
that they are the exception, rather than the rule.  I believe that,
just to be on the safe side, all those professing to be
"Christians" should be barred from public office, and perhaps,
denied the vote.

Of course, they should not be harmed or mistreated in any way. 
Just because it is necessary for a secular society to take
reasonable precautions against Christians' irrational behaviour, is
no excuse for atheists, people with a rationally based morality, to
begin behaving like them.

AFTERWORD

This was originally published as a posting to soc.religion.
christian.  (And I would like to point out that the moderator of
that group has never hesitated to post articles which have often
been severely critical of christianity in general, fundamentalism in
particular, and which were often rather sarcastic in tone.  The
group exists to *discuss* christianity, not simply to promote it.)
Response was so overwhelming that the moderator of the group had to
cease posting replies.  I personally received about 50 email
messages from outraged christian defenders of the faith.  If you
are an outraged christian, and wish to communicate that emotion,
please say something original.

Ernest Thompson Seton, BSA's first Chief Scout, a Freethinker 
 
>From ltaylor@denali.CS.UCLA.EDU 
(Originally distributed on InterNet.) 
 
The Boy Scout Handbook, tenth edition (1990), 
p. 582, acknowledges Ernest Thompson Seton as a 
pioneer in boy scouting, and the first chief 
scout of the Boy Scouts of America. 
 
E. T. Seton, artist and naturalist, was more than 
that.  A great part of _Scouting for Boys_, by 
Lord Baden-Powell, was taken directly from Seton's 
_Birch Bark Roll_.   Many of the games were taken 
from Seton's book, with just the names changed. 
Seton invented the merit badge system for his 
group, _Woodcraft Indians_. 
 
When Baden-Powell's version of Boy Scouting came to 
the United States, Seton wrote large sections of 
the BSA manual (1911).  Soon BSA became led, not 
by a naturalist, or a ``boy-man,'' but by lawyer 
and bureaucrat James E. West.  Due to personality 
conflicts and underhanded manipulation, E. T. Seton 
was finally forced out as Chief Scout in 1915, despite 
having dedicated years of his life to the advancement 
of the Boy Scouts of America. 
 
Guess what.  Ernest Thompson Seton, first Chief Scout 
of the BSA, originator of the spirit if not the form  
of scouting, did not believe in a personal God, and was  
antagonistic to traditional forms of religion. 
If he applied today as a scout leader, he would likely 
be rejected. 
 
Occasionally using the word God, or more likely, Great 
Spirit, it may be quibbled that he was not technically 
an atheist.  I will give you a section of his autobiography 
verbatim, in which Seton defines his terms, as well as 
reveals his character (pp. 355-6). 
 
Seton and an Archbishop Corrigan had attended the same 
social function, and had inadvertently switched coats. 
The clergyman invited Seton over, and after drinks were 
served, asked (begin quote), 
 
  ... ``To what church, may I ask, do you belong?'' 
 
  I replied: ``I was brought up in the worship of 
  Moloch.'' 
 
  ``_What!_'' he exclaimed in loud horror. 
 
  ``Yes,'' I answered, ``the demon-god of fire -- burn 
  your children -- the more of them you burn alive, 
  the greater your merit and likelihood of favor from 
  the grim fire-god.'' 
 
  For a moment he gazed in astonishment; then his  
  expression changed to one of understanding and  
  amusement, as he said: ``I see.  You mean Scottish 
  Calvinism.'' 
 
  I nodded.  Then he went on: ``I wish I could bring 
  you into the True Church.'' 
 
  ``There's no reason why you should not try,'' I  
  responded. 
 
  ``What would you give me for a starting point?'' he 
  asked. 
 
  ``Well,'' I said slowly, ``I will grant you that I 
  exist, because I think.  I will grant you that you exist, 
  because we are here facing each other, and exchanging 
  ideas; and we must postulate the reliability of our 
  senses. 
 
  ``I will grant that the universe exists, because if we 
  exist, we must exist somewhere.  That is all I will grant.'' 
 
  ``Will you,'' he said, ``grant that this universe whose  
  existence you admit, must have a first cause?'' 
 
  ``Yes, as a necessity of debate, not as a proven fact.'' 
 
  ``Will you let me go another step, and call that first 
  cause by the name of `God'? '' 
 
  ``Merely as a polite, but dangerous, concession to one's 
  respect for terminology.'' 
 
  ``Since you grant that the first cause is God, will you 
  further concede that God is a personal God?'' 
 
  ``No, I will not,'' I said firmly. ``And I see no reason 
  in logic, biology, or dynamics to justify any such 
  assumption.'' 
 
  ``Oh, bother,'' laughed His Grace, ``let's have another 
  glass of wine.'' 
 
End quote. 
 
Seton's version of atheism/ nature spiritualism/ whatever 
is enough for me.  I hereby claim him as a Humanist.   
 
Welcome, Chief.  You won't believe what your boys are up to.

Why is it no surprise that the religionist is guilty of plagiarism,
theft and then lying about it, and yet the religious organization
continues to refuse to admit atheists because the basis of morality
must be a belief in god?

                      THE PROMISE OF HUMANISM 
 
                       by Frederick Edwords 
 
 
     Every religion has its promise, the special reward it offers 
to the faithful.  Such a promise is often the main feature that 
attracts outsiders in.  As such, it can become a primary selling 
point and motivator. 
 
     The ancient promise of Christianity is eternal life in 
heaven.  I can remember a number of years ago listening to one 
radio preacher describing it in detail with vivid word pictures as 
he rhapsodized over how wonderful it would feel to be there.  I 
can remember as a child learning about the streets paved with gold 
and rivers flowing with milk and honey. 
 
     Different denominations also offer secondary promises, such 
as wealth and happiness in this life, God's helping hand in times 
of trouble, and even physical healings. 
 
     In Buddhism, the promise is somewhat different.  If you 
follow the Noble Eightfold Path of conduct, you will experience 
inner peace and eventually, through a series of rebirths, the 
state of Nirvana.  This state is the blowing out of all craving, 
attachment, and desire. 
 
     New Age religions tend to promise increased powers of mind 
that will bring about inner peace, happiness, power over external 
events, cosmic knowledge, and ultimate union with God. 
 
     Like in politics, so in religion: the key is PROMISE BIG. 
 
     In the past, Humanists have sometimes thought of themselves 
as too noble and honest to stoop to such strategies for gaining 
converts.  So, instead of offering our own "campaign promises," we 
used to prefer to run down the promises of all the other groups. 
Instead of focusing on a better way of our own, we kept the 
spotlight on those ideas we disagreed with.  Only we didn't seem  
able to do it with the captivating music of Omar Khayyam: 
 
     Of threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise! 
     One thing at least is certain--This Life flies; 
        One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; 
     The Flower that once has blown for ever dies. 
 
     This seemed to be our message, and to some it still is. 
But, if this is our message, are Humanists merely the consumer 
crusaders of the metaphysical world, the Ralph Naders of the 
religious realm?  Is our only role that of protecting the gullible 
from the purveyors of spiritual Florida swamp land? 
 
     This is, of course, a noble calling, worthy of the best 
efforts of talented individuals.  But is it ALL we should be 
about?  From much of our older rhetoric, you would think so.  On 
the other hand, today many Humanists are directing their focus 
on what HUMANISM has to offer. 
 
     And when that is done, the relevant question becomes "What is 
the promise of Humanism?" 
 
     Well, we already know what we can't promise.  As sober 
realists and no-nonsense straight-shooters, we're experts in  
throwing the wet blanket of rationalism over the fondest hopes of 
our fellows.  We know the "bad news," but what's our "good news,"  
what is the gospel of Humanism? 
 
     One way to find out is to ask ourselves how we would present 
Humanism to someone who has never been exposed to traditional 
religion.  Here would be a person in no need of disillusionment 
and possessing no idols in need of smashing.  We could now go 
directly to the goal of offering the "good news" of Humanism. 
 
     If some Humanists would find themselves speechless in a 
situation like this, it could be because they believe Humanism is 
simply the "default" condition of humanity, the "natural state" 
that prevails when no brainwash is present.  And I've known a  
number of Humanists who have put it to me in exactly those terms. 
 
     But, if that's the case, then the solemn duty of every 
Humanist when confronting a person unexposed to religion is to 
immediately teach him or her all about it!  In this way, the 
person will learn what to watch out for, will be prepared, and 
will be put on guard. 
 
     But I don't accept that Humanism is the default condition of 
humanity.  And I am indeed confronted with individuals unexposed 
to traditional religion.  I confront them every day.  They are my 
children. 
 
     How do I teach my children Humanism?  Well, I don't do it by 
running down religions they have never heard about.  I don't do it 
by exposing them to the varieties of religious experience. 
Instead, I expose them to the varieties of worldly experience.  My 
children, ages 4 and 5, already enjoy travel, pictures, movies, 
music, people, animals, flowers, daydreams, stories, words, 
numbers, shapes, colors, and the joy of learning.  I want them to 
live the good life envisioned by Humanism, to experience the 
promise first hand.  That's why, when I asked my eldest daughter,  
Livia, what the praying hands in front of the Oral Roberts medical 
complex were doing, she exclaimed, "They're clapping!" 
 
     Are my children Humanists yet?  Time will tell, but other 
Humanist parents I know who have used a similar approach have been 
pleased with the results.  And the implication is clear.  The 
promise of Humanism is a good life here and now. 
 
     So, let's discuss it in detail.  What IS the "good life?" 
Can it be pursued directly?  Can EVERYONE have it (that is, do we 
have a promise we can keep; can Humanism deliver the goods)?  And 
finally, will it play in Peoria? 
 
     Lloyd and Mary Morain talked about the good life in their 
1954 Beacon Press book, Humanism as the Next Step, when they 
wrote: 
 
     As a starting point let us take the idea that this life 
     should be experienced deeply, lived fully, with sensitive 
     awareness and appreciation of that which is around us. 
 
This was the first of their seven key ideas of Humanism.  They 
elaborated further, saying: 
 
     Back through the centuries whenever people have enjoyed 
     keenly the sights and sounds and other sensations of the 
     world about them, and enjoyed these for what they were--not 
     because they stood for something else--they were experiencing 
     life humanistically.  Whenever they felt keen interest in the 
     drama of human life about them and ardently desired to take 
     part in it they felt as humanists. 
 
     Referring to this attitude as "zest for living," they were 
following the lead of Bertrand Russell who, in his book The 
Conquest of Happiness, referred to "zest" as "the most universal  
and distinctive mark" of the happy individual.  People with this  
quality, Russell argued, are those who come at life with a sound 
appetite, are glad to have what is before them, partake of things 
until they have enough, and know when to stop. 
 
     This vision reminds us again of Omar Khayyam: 
 
     A Book of Verses underneath the Bough, 
     A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread--and Thou 
        Beside me singing in the Wilderness-- 
     Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow! 
 
     Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend, 
     Before we too into the Dust descend; 
        Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie, 
     Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and--sans End! 
 
Which sounds like the hedonistic doctrine Humanists are accused of 
advocating: 
 
     Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die. 
 
Or, as Mad magazine once put it -- 
 
     A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread, and Thou-- 
     Pretty soon I'll be drunk, fat, and in trouble. 
 
     But there is much more involved in the Humanist notion of the 
good life.  The physical pleasures are only a part of it, not to 
be denied of course, but far from representing the whole.  For the 
Humanist there are also the pleasures of an unfettered mind making 
new discoveries, solving problems, and creating.  There is the 
enjoyment of art, music, dance, and drama.  There is the joy of 
helping others and the challenge of working to make the world a 
better and more peaceful place.  And, of course, there are the 
joys associated with love and family.  The Humanist seeks the 
enjoyment of as many of these as possible. 
 
     In this, we are clearly at one with the ancient Greek ideal 
of wholeness and the integration of life.  For example, in the 
ancient Olympic games, competition included not only athletics but 
drama, music, poetry, and philosophy.  And the whole combination 
was viewed as a religious event.  The Greeks put it together and 
did it all.  So can we. 
 
     In having zest for living, we join with the ancient Chinese 
who, in following Confucius, saw much of life as play--which 
accounted for their enjoyment of ceremony and especially their 
love of toys. 
 
     This worldly and good-natured view of life that claims no 
ultimate knowledge, stands out when contrasted with Hinduism. 
Whereas the Yogi is often seen as renouncing desire, living an 
ascetic life-style, and acquiring eternal knowledge, Socrates, 
the sage of the ancient Greeks, deliberately provoked certain 
appetites in himself, lived a social and active life, and 
professed to have no knowledge whatever! 
 
     It is also radically different from traditional Christianity, 
which has sometimes called this world a veil of tears, has seen 
pleasures as vanity, and seems to find the goal of human life 
beyond the grave.  Such believers might quote Ecclesiastes-- 
 
     Better to go to the house of mourning 
     than to the house of feasting; 
     for to this end all men come, 
     let the living take this to heart. 
     Better sadness than laughter, 
     a severe face confers some benefit.     Jerusalem Bible 
 
     As an antidote, Robert Louis Stevenson offered these words in 
his Christmas Sermon: 
 
     Gentleness and cheerfulness, these come before all morality: 
     they are the perfect duties.  If your morals make you dreary, 
     depend on it they are wrong.  I do not say, "give them up," 
     for they may be all you have; but conceal them like a vice, 
     lest they should spoil the lives of better men." 
 
     Edwin H. Wilson, the grand old man of religious Humanism who, 
for 90 plus years, lived the promise, summed it up when he wrote: 
 
     The Humanist lives as if this world were all and enough.  He 
     is not otherworldly.  He holds that the time spent on the 
     contemplation of a possible afterlife is time wasted.  He 
     fears no hell and seeks no heaven, save that which he and 
     others created on earth.  He willingly accepts the world that 
     exists on this side of the grave as the place for moral 
     struggle and creative living.  He seeks the life abundant for 
     his neighbor as for himself.  He is content to live one world 
     at a time and let the next life--if such there may be--take 
     care of itself.  He need not deny immortality; he simply is 
     not interested.  His interests are here. 
 
     The way those interests should be carried out here is 
described by Havelock Ellis in his book, The Dance of Life.  There 
he presents living as an art, one best characterized as a dance. 
In this, he follows the ancient Greeks who chose the image of 
dancing because, unlike walking or running, dancing is not 
generally viewed as a goal-oriented activity leading from point A 
to B.  One dances for the sheer joy of the activity.  It is the 
process more than the product that counts.  And this is how the 
Humanist good life is to be lived. 
 
     So, when someone asks a Humanist, "What is the purpose of 
life?" the Humanist should answer, "Life is not purpose, life is 
art."  The meaning is found in the doing.   
 
     This is a revolutionary and truly unique way of looking at 
the world.  It is a way that finds the question of cosmic purpose 
irrelevant, one that is unmoved by the author of Ecclesiastes who, 
in contemplating the question of ultimate value, writes-- 
 
     I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and what 
     vanity it all is, what chasing of the wind! 
 
The Humanist response is that Solomon missed the point.  The 
people, ideas, things, and actions we love do not depend for their 
worth on how long they last or their supposed cosmic significance. 
They are things in themselves to be enjoyed for their own sakes. 
Life is an art, not a task.  Life is for us, not for the universe. 
And life is for now, not for eternity. 
 
     But there's more.  We can take Edwin Wilson's statement that 
this life is all and enough and beef it up a bit to declare that 
this life is more than enough.  Then it will express the Humanist 
optimism of Robert Louis Stevenson when he wrote: 
 
     The world is so full of a number of things, 
     I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings. 
 
(We ought to get some rosary beads and repeat this every day.) 
 
     There is more in this world than I could experience in a 
thousand different lifetimes.  There is a richness here, a 
cornucopia of choices, a wealth of opportunities.  There is so 
much to see, to do, to read, to learn.  The question is not, "What 
shall I do with my life?" but "What shall I do next?!" 
 
     Different people choose different things.  Most Humanists 
will choose a life oriented outward, not only to enjoying the 
good life, but sharing the good life through helping others.  Yet 
other people may choose the inner life of meditation.  By making 
such a choice, each one misses something the other is enjoying. 
But that can't be helped.  Any time one makes a choice in the use  
of one's time, one fails to engage in all the other possible uses  
for that time, including having other experiences. 
 
     So, if a monk or celibate priest speaks to me about the 
ecstasies of spiritual contemplation, I respond by sharing how 
thrilled I was in the birthing room watching my children being 
born.  If a young fundamentalist describes to me the experience of 
being "born again," I can't wait to talk about the exciting moment 
when I first appreciated geometry.  If heaven is described to me 
in graphic detail, I immediately want to show my slides of 
sunsets, seascapes, and mountain ranges. 
 
     I'm in love with life, and too busy with it to find time for 
things allegedly outside it. 
 
     But now we can ask, if this is the promise of Humanism--if 
this is the promise of liberal religion--is it a promise limited 
only to the affluent, the intelligent, the educated?  If so, then 
are we making a promise we can't always keep?  This is the 
criticism leveled against us by the otherworldly religions.  While 
we say that they can't keep their otherworldly promises, they 
explain that they turned to this other world because we Humanists 
didn't keep our worldly promises.   
 
     Otherworldly faiths offer the "joys of the spirit" to those 
who have been denied "the pleasures of the flesh."  And the claim 
is that such spiritual joys are more permanent and universal than 
is our pleasure.  But why give up so easily, denying oneself 
worldly pleasure to feed on a mirage in its stead?  Isn't this 
settling for less, and retreating into an unwarranted resignation? 
Bertrand Russell thought so when, in chapter 2 of The Conquest of 
Happiness, he took the author of Ecclesiastes to task for 
denouncing the very things that make happiness possible and give 
life meaning. 
 
     Nonetheless, I must admit that I benefit from growing up in a 
middle-class environment in a wealthy country where I have access 
to such variety.  But all is not lost in more impoverished 
environments in less wealthy countries.  At the Atheist Centre in 
Vijayawada, India, an extended family of Humanists teach the poor 
the joys of traditional folk dance, music, athletics (especially 
acrobatics), science, animal husbandry, occupational skills, and, 
most important of all, the vast world made possible only through 
reading.  Many of the beneficiaries of this effort are not only 
poor and uneducated, but are often crippled and abandoned.  Yet in 
a country steeped in an ancient tradition of other-worldliness due 
to just such harsh realities, the promise of Humanism is offered 
and met.  The International Association for Religious Freedom, the 
world organization of liberal religions, has similar projects in 
India and is getting similar results.  The promise is no illusion. 
 
     And I look at my own life, asking myself how useful the 
promise of the good life would be to me if I suddenly went deaf, 
or blind, or couldn't walk.  And yet I can answer with Robert 
Louis Stevenson that the world is indeed so full of things that 
can make me happy.  A calamity is a limitation, but if I were 
limited only to reading, I would find the world is so full of a 
number of books that I could not read them all in this lifetime. 
If I were limited only to seeing, I could not see all I want to 
see in this lifetime.  If I were limited only to hearing, I could 
not hear all I want to hear in this lifetime.  I have not tested 
all the thoughts I want to test, or worked out all the ideas I 
have started but don't have time to develop.  I haven't written 
all the speeches I want to write.  I haven't met all the people I 
could meet or faced all the challenges I could face.  Calamities 
destroy the promise usually because we concentrate on what we have 
lost instead of letting the misfortune simply focus our pursuits 
in a new direction. 
 
     The Stoic remedy for misfortune is as much a part of this 
promise as is the Cyrenaic enjoyment of good fortune.  When 
misfortune limits you, shift your focus and move on.  I would 
argue that we can, in most cases, keep the promise of joy in the 
here and now.  And even when all cannot be joy--for life indeed 
includes a large share of obligations, struggles, sorrows, and 
pain--the larger context can still be that of an artful life. 
 
     And when, in those rare instances, we find that the 
realization of the promise is futile, as in the case of an 
agonizing terminal illness, Humanism offers the freedom to exit 
this life at will and with dignity.  This is voluntary euthanasia, 
an area of great importance to Humanists, so much so that there 
will be two major workshops on this topic at the national 
conference of the American Humanist Association next weekend. 
 
     So, in the end, the promise is not a perfect one.  But we 
admit that.  Others may seem to offer more perfect promises, but 
can they deliver?  I have no evidence that anyone has ever gotten 
to heaven, realized Nirvana, or merged with God.  But I see 
evidence every day that the promise of the good life is no mirage. 
 
     So, I'll stick with the honesty of Humanism, that this life  
is all there is, and with the promise of Humanism, that this can 
be more than enough.  And this promise will serve as my motivation 
to make life better when all is not as it should be.  For I can 
better enjoy the promise on a clean rather than a dirty planet. 
And I can enjoy it better when I am helping others to participate 
in it. 
 
     This is a philosophy I can be proud of.  And, being proud of 
it, I can confidently share it with others.  I can offer the "good 
news" of its promise and know I am doing something valuable 
for others. 
 
     As a result, Humanism need no longer be a philosophy 
exclusively for those bold enough to face an uncaring cosmos with 
defiance, for those fearless enough "to go where no one has gone  
before," and for those impudent enough to call the majority of  
humanity cowards for fleeing to a sweeter tale.  Most people are 
moved by exciting promises.  They are captivated by thrilling 
visions.  And this philosophy can be for them to. 
 
     There's nothing wrong with offering a zesty promise if we  
have one.  And have one we do.  So let us Humanists stress it, 
publicize it, and present it as our entry in the religious/ 
philosophical sweepstakes.  I submit to you that this one shift in 
our focus will do more to counter the harmful effects of 
otherworldly belief than all the rationalistic arguments of 
history's greatest freethinkers.  So let's give it a shot. 
 
We have nothing to lose but our minority status.

1)  The Catholic church is the world's largest haven for
pedophiles.  When children or their parents have complained, the
Church protects the priest, threatens the parents with damnation,
and transfers the priest to another parish where he can commit the
same crimes again.  Only after years of losing expensive lawsuits
and being forced to pay millions in court settlements, has the
Church begun to take any action at all (obviously to save itself
money, not out of any concern for children).

2)  In the US, the Catholic Church, along with the Mormons and an
alliance of other fundamentalists, provided the funding to defeat
the Equal Rights Amendment which would have put gender equality in
the US Constitution.  Throughout the world the Catholic Church
works against women's rights.

3)  Similar to the last, the Catholic Church has made it virtually
impossible to provide contraception information or abortion
services to women as part of international projects.  Through this
method, the Catholic Church is responsible for killing tens of
thousands of women each and every year.

4)  In the Americas, the Catholic Church provided the ideology
justifying the genocide of Native Americans.  When given lands to
be held in trust for Native nations, the Church cheated the
Natives, and used the lands to benefit itself, as in Oka; Catholic
duplicity is the basis for the recent trouble with the Mohawk
nation there.  The Catholic Church ran "Indian Residential Schools"
which were designed to aid in the genocide of Indian culture. 
Death, sexual abuse and physical abuse, as well as simple
humiliation and garden variety racism were the order of the day in
these church-sponsored institutions.

5)  In Ireland, the Catholic Church ran the Magdalen Laundry up to
1988, women who were sent there as "immoral" were imprisoned,
abused and kept as slaves.  Many died.

6)  The Church is responsible for the spread of AIDS through its
ridiculous prohibition of condom use.  The Pope has stated that it
is better morally for a man with AIDS to forego the use of condoms
and infect his wife, if he cannot remain celibate.  Add a few
thousand more women to the church's total.

7)  The Church promotes dictatorships and anti-democratic
governments wherever it can as long as it can either protect itself
or, preferably, control them.

8) Catholic monasteries and nunneries in France (and possibly
throughout Europe) hid and protected Nazi war criminals for decades
after World War II.

9)  Through its alliances and concordats with Mussolini and Hitler,
the Catholic Church gave both Nazism and Fascism the respectability
they needed to become established.  Catholic support helped defeat
the elected democratic Spanish Republic and install the Fascist
dictator Franco.

10)  Through its magical thinking and peddling of trinkets, selling
blessings, and extorting money from the ignorant by threatening the
dead, it drains billions of dollars from the world's economies.

These are just off the top of my head, I am sure there are more.

Thanks for your excellent 10 bones of contention with the RC cult.
I was raised as a Catholic in Northern Ireland by liberal parents
who taught me to respect the religious beliefs of others. So when I
became an atheist I still held onto that tolerance and still find
it very hard to criticise actions motivated by strong religious
belief. It's refreshing to have someone do it with such well
informed flair.

OUR SUNDAY CHAPTER

THE INHABITANTS OF THE MOON, O. B. Huntington

Astronomers and philosophers have, from time almost
immemorial until very recently, asserted that the moon was
uninhabited, that it had no atmosphere, etc.  But recent
discoveries, through the means of powerful telescopes, have
given scientists a doubt or two upon the old theory.

Nearly all the great discoveries of men in the last half
century have, in one way or another, either directly or
indirectly, contributed to prove Joseph Smith to be a
prophet.

As far back as 1837, I know that he said the moon was
inhabited by men and women the same as this earth, and that
they lived to a greater age than we do -- that they live
generally to near the age of a 1000 years.

He described the men as averaging near six feet in height,
and dressing quite uniformly in something near the Quaker
style.

In my Patriarchal blessing, given by the father of Joseph
the Prophet, in Kirtland, 1837, I was told that I should
preach the gospel before I was 21 years of age; that I
should preach to the inhabitants upon the islands of the sea,
and--to the inhabitants of the moon, even the planet you can
now behold with your eyes.

>From the first two promises we may reasonably expect the
third to be fulfilled also.

---

One truth after another men are finding out by the wisdom
and inspiration given of God to them.

The inspiration of God caused men to hunt for a new
continent until Columbus discovered it.  Men have lost
millions of dollars, and hundreds of lives to find a country
beyond the north pole; and they will yet find that country--
a warm, fruitful country, inhabited by the ten tribes of
Israel, a country divided by a river, on one side of which
lives the half tribe of Manasseh, which is more numerous
than all the others.  So said the Prophet.  At the same time
he described the shape of the earth at the poles as being a
rounded elongation and drew a diagram of it in this form:

[crude drawing like a circle with handles at each side]

which any one can readily see will allow the sun's rays to
fall so near perpendicular to the center that that part of
the earth may be warmed and made fruitful.  He quoted
scripture in proof of his theory which says that "the earth
flieth upon its wings in the midst of the creations of God,"
and said that there was a semblance in the form of the earth
that gave rise to the saying.

ABORTION

A Humanist Response to the Bible Argument

When faced with a moral dilemma, many people turn to a book like the
Bible, in the belief that it will offer them some sort of guidance. 
This is particularly true for those who believe the Bible to be the
literal world of God and the only authority on morality.  However,
their  enthusiasm for what they believe the Bible says, rarely equates 
with what it actually does say.

What Does the Bible Say About Abortion?

This is a very easy question to answer, because the word abortion does
not appear anywhere in the Bible.  Out of the over 600 Mosaic Laws,
covering everything from the shape of a man's beard to the minutest
details of sabbath observance, not even one of them comments on
abortion.  One of the only references to this issue at all may be
found in Exodus 21:22-25 "If men strive, and hurt a woman with child,
so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow:  he
shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay
upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine.  And if any
mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth..."

Far from being any kind of pronouncement against abortion, this
passage suggests that the miscarriage is only punishable by a fine,
and is of little or no consequence and certainly does not involve any
loss of life.  It is only in the case of harm to the woman that the
biblical rule of "an eye for an eye" is to be used.  Other references
to untimely births occur in Hos. 9:14; Job 3:16; Psalms 58:8; and
Eccles. 6:3; but none of these imply in any way that abortion was
considered contrary to any religious or moral law.  Nowhere is there
any reference to abortion that implies that it is in any way contrary
to the will of God.

What About "Thou Shalt Not Kill"?

The sixth of the "Ten Commandments" is to be found in Exodus 20:13 and
states quite explicitly "Thou Shalt Not Kill."  Does this include
abortion?

Although this commandment is the most widely used argument in the
anti-abortionists' biblical arsenal, its meaning is nowhere near as
clear as they might like to think, because it does not explain just
what it is that must not be killed.

We use the word kill to refer to the ending of the life of anything
that lives.  We kill the weeds on our lawns, we kill the pests on our
crops, we kill to eat, in fact we literally cannot live without
killing something.  To understand what this passage really means, we
obviously have to see what the Bible says about different sorts of
killing.

I doubt that anyone would argue that the killing of plants is
considered unacceptable in the Bible. Likewise there is nothing to
suggest that the lives of domestic or wild animals were in any way
considered of value.  In fact the very opposite is the case as
demonstrated in Mark 2:14 where Jesus is said to have cast out demons
into a herd of swine which then drown themselves by running into the
sea, or Exodus 9:3-6 where God reportedly killed all of the Egyptian
cattle.  Not to mention the Old Testament passion for sacrificial
slaying and burnt offerings.

So, we are left with just human life to consider, but again the
meaning is not clear.  Many passages in the Bible detail the mass
slaughter of various enemies of the chosen people or their God.  2
Kings 8:12, "dash their children, and rip up their women with child",
or Isaiah 13:16 "Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before
their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished." 
In fact if all of these divinely approved deaths were added up, the
victims wold probably number in the millions.

Time and time again, after making such an apparently unambiguous
statement in favour of not killing, the Bible documents and apparently
condones the killing of men, women and children for committing such
crimes as picking up sticks on the sabbath (Numbers 15:32-35) or being
a stubborn son (Deut. 21:18-21).  The examples are almost endless and
a thorough reading of the Bible indicates that killing was not only
condoned but encouraged for such apparently trivial offenses and to a
degree that no civilized person would accept.

Surely Killing An Innocent Unborn Child Was Considered Wrong?

Abortion is not new, it has been practised with varying degrees of
success for thousands of years.  However, there is not a single
reference in the Bible to any woman being guilty of having or aiding
an abortion and it is inconceivable to suppose that during the period
that the Bible was written, not one abortion was performed.  Likewise,
it is inconceivable to imagine that this is merely an oversight, since
the Bible goes to such lengths to identify supposedly sinful acts.

If you believe that the Bible is the literal word of God, then you are
left with the inevitable conclusion that God does not condemn abortion
(which may explain the high number of natural spontaneous abortions). 
If you believe that the Bible was written by ordinary human beings,
you are left with the conclusion that they placed no value at all on
the unborn human fetus and not a whole lot more value on it even after
it was born.

Without the Bible as a Guide, How Can I Make Such a Decision?

Even many dedicated Christians no longer regard the Bible as their
only source of guidance, and an increasingly large proportion of the
population are rejecting all religious beliefs and biblical authority.

Whether they know it or not, and whether they use the name or not,
these people are using humanistic principles as their guide.  Simply
stated, humanism promotes the use of rational thought, human
experience and compassion to determine the most appropriate course of
action to be taken.

Some Christians ask how they can make a difficult decision on their
own without relying on a source of supposed authority such as the
Bible. However, most humanists would argue that once you have finally
rejected mystical or religious thinking, the real issues become much
clearer.  You are able to rationally consider the likely outcome of
each available course of action and make your decision based on the
particular circumstances rather than on some religious dogma.

Humanists acknowledge that the exercise of their free will requires
the courage to accept that they may make the wrong decision sometimes. 
They may not have all of the relevant facts, or may incorrectly
predict the outcome of certain events, but they regard the occasional
failure as the inevitable cost of their own humanity.  They would
rather strive to be the best that they can be, even when they know
that they may suffer failures, than blindly sacrifice their
responsibilities to a rigid dogma.

What is the Humanist View of Abortion?

Humanists recognize that there are no absolute answers to this
question.

Each case is different and the decision must be based on individual
circumstances.  A rational and scientific analysis of the issue
clearly indicates that there is a progression from single human cell
to fully developed fetus during the course of a pregnancy, which may
imply a changing value to that life.  Likewise, not all children face
a life of equal value.  Many are not wanted and cannot be supported,
or they may face a life of hunger, disease, neglect or abuse.

Humanists agree that every woman has the inherent right to decide for
herself whether to carry a pregnancy to term, or whether to terminate
it.  They trust women to care about the quality of life of their
future children, and to be capable of making the best decision.  They
believe that nobody has the right to impose their wishes or opinions
on a woman facing this decision, no matter what their motivation may
be.

Humanists believe that women can only exercise their rights in a free
society where there is easy access to a speedy and safe abortion, and
this is why humanists like Dr. Henry Morgentaler have fought and even
gone to prison in support of a woman's right to freedom of choice.
