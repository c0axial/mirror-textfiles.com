The purpose of this magazine is to provide a source of  
articles dealing with many aspects of humanism.  
  
We are ATHEISTIC as we do not believe in the actual  
existence of any supernatural beings or any transcendental  
reality.  
  
We are SECULAR because the evidence of history and the daily  
horrors in the news show the pernicious and destructive  
consequences of allowing religions to be involved with  
politics or government.  
  
We are HUMANISTS and we focus on what is good for humanity,  
in the real world.  We will not be put off with offers of  
pie in the sky, bye and bye.

                    WHAT INFIDELS HAVE DONE. 
 
     ONE HUNDRED years after Christ had died suppose some one had  
asked a Christian, What hospitals have you built? What asylums  
have you founded? They would have said "None." Suppose three  
hundred years after the death of Christ the same questions had  
been asked the Christian, he would have said "None, not one." Two  
hundred years more and the answer would have been the same. And  
at that time the Christian could have told the questioner that  
the Mohammedans had built asylums before the Christians. He could  
also have told him that there had been orphan asylums in China  
for hundreds and hundreds of years, hospitals in India, and  
hospitals for the sick at Athens. 
 
     Here it may be well enough to say that all hospitals and  
asylums are not built for charity. They are built because people  
do not want to be annoyed by the sick and the insane. If a sick  
man should come down the street and sit upon your doorstep, what  
would you do with him? You would have to take him into your house  
or leave him to suffer. Private families do not wish to take the  
burden of the sick. Consequently, in self-defence, hospitals are  
built so that any wanderer coming to a house, dying, or suffering  
from any disease, may immediately be packed off to a hospital and  
not become a burden upon private charity. The fact that many  
diseases are contagious rendered hospitals necessary for the  
preservation of the lives of the citizens. The same thing is true  
of the asylums. People do not, as a rule, want to take into their  
families, all the children who happen to have no fathers and  
mothers. So they endow and build an asylum where those children  
can be sent -- and where they can be whipped according to law,  
Nobody wants an insane stranger in his house. The consequence is,  
that the community, to get rid of these people, to get rid of the  
trouble, build public institutions and send them there. 
 
     Now, then, to come to the point, to answer the interrogatory  
often flung at us from the pulpit, What institutions have  
Infidels built? In the first place, there have not been many  
Infidels for many years and, as a rule, a known Infidel cannot  
get very rich, for the reason, that the Christians are so  
forgiving and loving they boycott him. If the average Infidel,  
freely stating his opinion, could get through the world himself,  
for the last several hundred years, he has been in good luck. But  
as a matter of fact there have been some Infidels who have done  
some good, even from a Christian standpoint. The greatest charity  
ever established in the United States by a man -- not by a  
community to get rid of a nuisance, but by a man who wished to do  
good and wished that good to last after his death -- is the  
Girard College in the city of Philadelphia. Girard was an  
Infidel. He gained his first publicity by going like a common  
person into the hospitals and taking care of those suffering from  
contagious diseases -- from cholera and smallpox. So there is a  
man by the name of James Lick, an Infidel, who has given the  
finest observatory ever given to the world. And it is a good  
thing for an Infidel to increase the sight of men. The reason  
people are theologians is because they cannot see. Mr. Lick has  
increased human vision, and I can say right here that nothing has  
been seen through the telescope calculated to prove the astronomy  
of Joshua. Neither can you see with that telescope a star that  
bears a Christian name. The reason is that Christianity was  
opposed to astronomy. so astronomers took their revenge, and now  
there is not one star that glitters in all the vast firmament of  
the boundless heavens that has a Christian name. Mr. Carnegie has  
been what they call a public-spirited man. He has given millions  
of dollars for libraries and other institutions, and he certainly  
is not an orthodox Christian. 
 
     Infidels, however, have done much better even than that.  
They have increased the sum of human knowledge. John W. Draper,  
in his work on "The Intellectual Development of Europe," has done  
more good to the American people and to the civilized world than  
all the priests in it. He was an Infidel. Buckle is another who  
has added to the sum of human knowledge. Thomas Paine, an  
Infidel, did more for this country than any other man who ever  
lived in it. 
 
     Most of the colleges in this country have, I admit, been  
founded by Christians, and the money for their support has been  
donated by Christians, but most of the colleges of this country  
have simply classified ignorance, and I think the United States  
would be more learned than it is to-day if there never had been a  
Christian college in it. But whether Christians gave or Infidels  
gave has nothing to do with the probability of the Jonah story or  
with the probability that the mark on the dial went back ten  
degrees to prove that a little Jewish king was not going to die  
of a boil. And if the Infidels are all stingy and the Christians  
are all generous it does not even tend to prove that three men  
were in a fiery furnace heated seven times hotter than was its  
wont without even scorching their clothes. 
 
     The best college in this country -- or, at least, for a long  
time the best -- was the institution founded by Ezra Cornell.  
That is a school where people try to teach what they know instead  
of what they guess. Yet Cornell University was attacked by every  
orthodox college in the United States at the time it was founded,  
because they said it was without religion. 
 
     Everybody knows that Christianity does not tend to  
generosity.  Christianity says: "Save your own soul, whether  
anybody else saves his or not." Christianity says: "Let the great  
ship go down. You get into the little life-boat of the gospel and  
paddle ashore, no matter what becomes of the rest." Christianity  
says you must love God, or something in the sky, better than you  
love your wife and children. And the Christian, even when giving,  
expects to get a very large compound interest in another world.  
The Infidel who gives, asks no return except the joy that comes  
from relieving the wants of another. 
 
     Again the Christians, although they have built colleges,  
have built them for the purpose of spreading their superstitions,  
and have poisoned the minds of the world, while the Infidel  
teachers have filled the world with light. Darwin did more for  
mankind than if he had built a thousand hospitals. Voltaire did  
more than if he had built a thousand asylums for the insane. He  
will prevent thousands from going insane that otherwise might be  
driven into insanity by the "glad tidings of great joy." Haeckel  
is filling the world with light. 
 
     I am perfectly willing that the results of the labors of  
Christians and the labors of Infidels should be compared. Then  
let it be understood that Infidels have been in this world but a  
very short time. A few years ago there were hardly any. I can  
remember when I was the only Infidel in the town where I lived.  
Give us time and we will build colleges in which something will  
be taught that is of use. We hope to build temples that will be  
dedicated to reason and common sense, and where every effort will  
be made to reform mankind and make them better and better in this  
world. 
 
     I am saying nothing against the charity of Christians;  
nothing against any kindness or goodness. But I say the  
Christians, in my judgment, have done more harm than they have  
done good. They may talk of the asylums they have built, but they  
have not built asylums enough to hold the people who have been  
driven insane by their teachings. Orthodox religion has opposed  
liberty. It has opposed investigation and free-thought. If all  
the churches in Europe had been observatories, if the cathedrals  
had been universities where facts were taught and where nature  
was studied, if all the priests had been real teachers, this  
world would have been far, far beyond what it is to-day. 
 
     There is an idea that Christianity is positive, and  
Infidelity is negative. If this be so, then falsehood is positive  
and truth is negative. What I contend is that Infidelity is a  
positive religion; that Christianity is a negative religion.  
Christianity denies and Infidelity admits. Infidelity stands by  
facts; it demonstrates by the conclusions of the reason.  
Infidelity does all it can to develop the brain and the heart of  
man. That is positive. Religion asks man to give up this world  
for one he knows nothing about, That is negative. I stand by the  
religion of reason. I stand by the dogmas of demonstration.

Public Education 
 
[Ed. Note:  originally appeared on ffrf-l, the Freedom From  
Religion Foundation's email discussion list.  The character named  
"Skeptic" had been posting the usual derogatory messages about  
the worthlessness of public education.  This was Brent Yaciw's  
excellent reply, which is worth sharing.  Permission sought and  
obtained.] 
 
I'm not going to bother repeating all of Skeptic's post; enough  
of you have already seen it to know the general direction. Let me  
simply point out a few of what I consider highly non-humanist  
attitudes in it: 
"some kids are unteachable" Presumably because god made them that  
way, right? Funny how people with this attitude give up SO EASILY  
on children, but expect these same "unteachable" kids to "pull  
themselves up by their bootstraps" as adults. Illogical, yes, but  
that never bothers true believers. 
 
"in public schools you can be suspended for calling a black man a  
nigger" Or a cocksucker, or pissant, or any number of other  
personal insults. If you can't tell the difference between that  
and expressing yourself on a political issue on your car in the  
parking lot, there's not much point in discussing it. Take a  
course in basic critical thinking. 
 
"YA right keep dreaming." 
Typical response of the know-not. 
 
"Yes and your political "opinions" are so much more logical...A  
prevailing political viewpoint is right because a majority of  
people have been convinced that it is right." 
 
He confuses opinion and belief with reality and logic. Given the  
same facts, the logical conclusion is inevitably the same. The  
anti-public school crowd simply ignores the facts. 
 
"Thats probably true, but I never said anything about wanting to  
shift money into theirs[the RRR's] or any other institutes  
coffers."   
 
If you fire a shotgun at me and miss and kill your mother, does  
your "intent" matter? That's MY point: you're killing the RRR's  
enemies for them, and then asking us to applaud you for it. 
 
"Why is it everyone hates it when some one gets a tax exemption?" 
 
I don't hate it when someone gets a tax exemption; I hate it when  
an organization that works to the detriment of us all, that  
inevitably wants to destroy my viewpoint by force, gets a tax  
exemption. The element of force is the difference, and that's why  
we keep losing battles: we're not willing (nor should we be) to  
force others to become atheists. 
 
"Private schools or religious schools, I think there is a  
difference in this case." 
 
Yes, there is, but realistically around 90% of private schools  
ARE religious schools. I would have no problem with ONLY purely  
secular schools being eligible for vouchers, but then, without  
government supervision, who would see that they stayed that way?  
Hell, it's hard enough monitoring the public schools! 
 
"death education for youngsters" 
 
You mean you can guarantee that no one's parents, brothers or  
sisters, or other relatives or friends will die before they reach  
fourth grade? The sooner children are taught that death is as  
natural as life, the sooner they lose their unreasoning fear of  
it--which is the heart of religion. Same with learning about  
other realities of life like child abuse--or need we wait until  
AFTER the priests have at them? 
 
"I can play the quote game too." 
 
I don't play "quote games." I have a macro that includes quotes  
with my signature, generally at random. Of course, I do choose  
the initial input, but they are for amusement purposes  
primarlily. 
 
"I don't want my kids to see that stuff in the sixth grade" 
 
Ah, the heart of the matter: protecting the kiddies from reality.  
Children as chattel, keep my property pure as long as possible.  
You sound more old testament all the time. By sixth grade, they  
probably know as much as you do about it. 
 
"Further I don't want to pay for the crap our public schools want  
to pass off as education" 
 
You know, I want McDonalds to offer prime rib too, but they  
don't, and if I go elsewhere to get it--which you have the choice  
to do as well--I pay more. The reality of government is that you  
can't please everyone, and those who take the easy way out by  
going outside the system (instead of improving the system we  
have, which takes a lot more work than whining and sniping from  
the cheap seats) pay for the privilege. You want prime rib at  
McDonalds prices.  Ain't gonna happen. 
 
" the job of government is to protect you from the criminal acts  
of others" 
 
And what, prey tell, is a "criminal act" if violating my rights  
isn't one?  Who are you to decide, for that matter, what the job  
of government is in a democracy? If enough people say the job of  
government is providing education for all, then that's what its  
job IS. 
 
"Governments violate rights, people commit crimes." 
 
Get real. A government is just a collection of people. 
 
"Your an ass" 
 
That's "You're an ass," which MY PUBLIC SCHOOL taught me.  
Apparently yours didn't. I guess you must have been  
"unteachable." Or did you go to one of those excellent private  
schools? 
 
"Not only do I have the right to discriminate, I do it all the  
time. I do it when I employ people, I do it when I choose who I  
will sit next to at a meeting..." 
 
You are confusing two senses of the word "discriminate." At  
least, I think you are; maybe you are one of those who decides  
who to employ based on skin color or other non-work-related  
characteristics, which means you are hurting yourself by failing  
to hire the best person for the job. Maybe you choose who to sit  
next to on that basis, which means you live in a very narrow and  
ugly world. But assuming otherwise, your choice to employ the  
best person for a job or sit next to a friend are hardly the  
issue here. Your decision to do me harm by preventing me from  
going where I wish on public streets, buying a home where I wish  
if I can afford it, or eating in a restaurant are. Whether you  
care to admit it or not, your bigoted restaurant owner IS DOING  
ME HARM by making me go elsewhere because of my skin color when  
he is serving others. 
 
I see only evidence of concern for the owner in your arguments,  
but I'll bet if you ran out of gas and had to walk past a dozen  
gas stations before you got to one that would serve you because  
you happened to be born white, and similar things happened every  
day of your life, you'd sing a different tune. 
 
"I for one won't higher fundy christians" 
 
Though I believe that this falls into a different category than  
race or gender, this attitude is as foolish as the guy who won't  
hire blacks. I don't know what business you're in, but suppose  
you owned a computer company and the next Bill Gates wanted to  
work for you and you said no because he was a fundy. You've also  
missed an opportunity to plant a seed of reason into him/her.  
Several of my best friends were once fundies, and I've had a  
number of fundy friends over the years that provided stimulating  
conversation. Trust me, you aren't likely to have to fire them;  
sometimes they'll get so scared they'll quit for fear you'll  
convert them, sometimes they'll work twice as hard to prove just  
how much their religion makes them better workers, and maybe, on  
rarer occassions, they'll drift out of fundieland into reality. 
 
"Now, I think its perfectly clear you don't like libertarians" 
 
Actually, I have a number of friends who are Libertarians, and  
just like religionists, they are perfectly rational and can  
discuss things logically, until you question one of their  
articles of faith and ask them for evidence, y'know, FACTS. Then  
they call you an ass, or an idiot, and scamper away claiming I  
just don't understand. 
 
"My test scores were always above those in public schools(reading  
and math anyway.)" 
 
Test scores are more a product of innate ability than anything  
else; as someone consistently in the top 1% in that category, who  
went to a public school, I could simply cite myself as "proof."  
But that's the problem with anecdotal evidence; the real proof is  
the statistical comparisons, which if you would simply read them  
demonstrate clearly that the average net gain in scores is HIGHER  
in public schools than private. In other words, if your freshmen  
score [as a sample figure] an average equivalent of a 1200 SAT in  
a public school, their average score as a senior is going to be  
1295, as opposed to a 1245 average if they went to a private  
Catholic school. Period. 
 
Furthermore, Catholic school students are more likely to use  
drugs, drink alcohol, or shoplift--and this is from a survey  
sponsored and published by the National Catholic Education  
Association, which I'm sure would have preferred the opposite  
results. 
 
I also suggest you read up on the boondoggles in Milwaukee, where  
two private "choice" schools have failed, leaving students-yup- 
seeking public schools as a fail-safe, and in one school the  
director wrote $47,000 in bad checks. Two similar schools are  
struggling to survive. As Dr. Alex Molar noted, "This is what  
happens when you make education policy based on ideological  
zealotry instead of the best interest of the children." A similar  
snafu occurred recently here in FL, when a local private school  
suddenly closed, again forcing public schools to absorb a sudden  
influx of hudreds of children. 
 
Research: there's NO substitute for it. I sincerely hope you and  
your children do have a nice life, but if you're planning on 
sending them to a private school (and there ARE a few good ones, 
secular, focused on academic excellence, run by dedicated 
educators who honestly thought they could do better without the 
red tape government involves, and were realistic in their tuition  
pricing), I hope you research it better than you've researched  
your arguments here. 
 
Cheers,

Rabid, Raving Atheism 
 
Part 1 
 
Atheism defended. 
 
I'm sure I've said it over and over but here it is again:  an  
atheist is simply one who has concluded, after considering the  
evidence, that no god exists.  One may further conclude, based on  
one's knowledge of human psychology, sociology, and comparative  
religion, that no god can exist.  I certainly have not yet heard  
a definition of a "god" that I can conceive of as actually  
existing in the real world. 
 
It is not merely a belief, in the way that a religion is a  
belief, i.e., clinging to faith in the absence of evidence, in  
the face of contrary evidence, sometimes.  Atheism is as valid as  
an absence of belief in werewolves, fairies in the garden,  
astrology, Casper the ghost, Holy the ghost, or Santa. 
 
Furthermore, using rhetorical akido, I challenge christians to  
give me reasons why they do not believe in Krishna, Zeus, Allah,  
Kwan Yin, or whatever.  Those reasons are also perfectly  
applicable to their home grown Yahweh and Jesus, why should I  
have to do all the work? 
 
Watson Heston cited Kings(1).  This argument "proved" that the  
ba'alim did not exist.  Now, there is an argument against god  
straight from an inspired source.  Try the test.  Does Yahweh do  
any better?  How about that, guys? 
 
(1) The Freethinker's Pictorial Textbook. 
 
Agnosticism sounds good until you examine it closely.  Why should  
I be agnostic about werewolves?  About witches on broomsticks?   
If I claim to be agnostic on the subject of a deity, I am  
admitting that I cannot decide anything at all.  Yet, I do not  
act as if werewolves were real, and I will not act as if god were  
real.  If new evidence, of the sort that would validate any other  
claim, comes to light, I will certainly examine it.  We can all  
think of perfectly simple things that would conclusively  
demonstrate the existence of extraterrestrial life, for instance. 
 
But for the same reasons that I do not think that evidence will  
come to light validating the claims that Atlantis existed or that  
there is such a thing as reincarnation, I am not going to waste  
any time looking for proof that things like gods exist. 
 
As Lemuel Washburn so aptly said:  "If god exists, what objection  
can he have to saying so?"(2) 
 
(2) Is the bible worth reading, and other essays. 
 
Christians remind me of the doctor in the joke who found a new  
disease with no symptoms. 
 
Or as Delos McKown put it:   "The invisible and the non existent  
look very much alike."(3)   (3)The Mythmaker's Magic. 
 
                         Part 2 
 
Atheism further defended. 
 
For an analogy, I refer people to Susan Blackmore's books on the  
paranormal, both _Dying to Live_ and _Adventures of a  
Parapsychologist_.  You may know that she received the first  
degree awarded in Britain in parapsychology, and that after more  
than a decade of research into psi, she concluded that she was  
studying something that didn't exist. 
 
Theology suffers from the same problem as parapsychology:  its  
purported object of study does not exist; all of the talk about  
god is done in the absence of a referent.  Hypothesizing that god  
exists leads to false and misleading conclusions:  like prayer  
works, there is an afterlife, teleology, and so on; as well, it  
is totally and utterly unnecessary. 
 
Blackmore put the problem thus, at the end of _Adventures of a  
Parapsychologist_: there can be two hypotheses about psi:  1)  
there are paranormal powers; 2) there are not.  As data we accept  
the *experiences* of people in this area.  People undoubtedly  
feel that they have experienced telepathy, precogition, dreams of  
the future and so on. 
 
Now, which hypothesis leads to increasing knowledge?  In about  
150 years of testing, parapsychologists have gone nowhere.  She  
says the only reliable finding of parapsychology is that psi is  
not repeatable.  If we *assume* as a working hypothesis: that  
these are psychological events within the human mind and that no  
paranormal powers exist, what do we get? 
 
The whole field of anomalistic psychology opens up, we have an  
understanding of mass delusion, the behavior of crowds, how  
memory works and fails, better understanding of perception, and  
the mechanisms involved and how they sometimes fail, the  
evolution of consciousness, perception, cognition and more. 
 
The same thing applies to the god hypothesis.  Postulating that  
god exists does not work as an explanation of the world and its  
events.  As a hypothesis, it fails every test.  As Richard  
Dawkins said, in his debate with the Archbishop of York(4), "A  
universe with a God would look quite different from a universe  
without one.  A physics, a biology where there is a God is bound  
to look different.  So the most basic claims of religion _are_  
scientific.  Religion _is_ a scientific theory." 
 
(4) Lions 10, Christians 0. 
 
Of course, he is assuming that "God" is a term with some meaning. 
 
He says (ibid.): 
 
<< Right then, what is God?  And now come the weasel words.  
These are very variable.  "God is not out there, he is in all of  
us."  "God is the ground of all being."  "God is the essence of  
life."  "God is the universe."  "Don't you believe in the  
universe?"  "Of course I believe in the universe."  "Then you  
believe in God."  "God is love, don't you believe in love?"    
"Right, then you believe in God?" >> 
 
Sound familiar? 
 
To reiterate:  not only does the god hypothesis lead to false and  
misleading conclusions, it is totally and utterly unnecessary.   
It is a useless and wasteful redundancy, as worthless as  
believing that Boreas is the source of the North Wind. 
 
OK, big finish from Richard Dawkins now: 
 
<< I want to end by returning to science.  It is often said, ...,  
that although there is no positive evidence for the existence of  
God, nor is there evidence against his existence.  So it is best  
to keep an open mind and be agnostic. 
 
At first sight that seems an unassailable position, at least in  
the weak sense of Pascal's wager.  But on second thoughts it  
seems a cop-out, because the same could be said of Father 
Christmas and tooth fairies.  There may be fairies at the bottom  
of the garden.  There is no evidence for it, but you can't  
_prove_ that there aren't any, so shouldn't we be agnostic with  
respect to fairies? 
 
The trouble with the agnostic argument is that it can be applied  
to anything.  There is an infinite number of hypothetical beliefs  
we could hold which we can't positively disprove.  On the whole,  
people don't believe in most of them, such as fairies, unicorns,  
dragons, Father Christmas, and so on.  But on the whole they do  
believe in a creator God, together with whatever particular  
baggage goes with the religion of their parents. 
 
I suspect the reason is that most people, though not belonging to  
the [fundamentalists], nevertheless have a residue of feeling  
that Darwinian evolution isn't quite big enough to explain  
everything about life.  All I can say as a biologist is that the  
feeling disappears progressively the more you read about and  
study what is known about life and evolution. 
 
I want to add one thing more.  The more you understand the  
significance of evolution, the more you are pushed away from the  
agnostic position and towards atheism.  Complex, statistically  
improbable things are by their nature more difficult to explain  
than simple, statistically probable things. 
 
The great beauty of Darwin's theory of evolution is that it  
explains how complex, difficult to understand things could have  
arisen step by plausible step, from simple, easy to understand  
beginnings.  We start our explanation from almost infinitely  
simple beginnings:  pure hydrogen and a huge amount of energy.   
Our scientific, Darwinian explanations carry us through a series  
of well-understood gradual steps to all the spectacular beauty  
and complexity of life. 
 
The alternative hypothesis, that it was all started by a  
supernatural creator, is not only superfluous, it is also highly  
improbable.  It falls foul of the very argument that was  
originally put forward in its favour.  This is because any God  
worthy of the name must have been a being of colossal  
intelligence, a supermind, an entity of extremely low  
probability--a very improbable being indeed. 
 
Even if the postulation of such an entity explained anything (and  
we don't need it to), it still wouldn't help because it raises a  
bigger mystery than it solves. 
 
Science offers us an explanation of how complexity (the  
difficult) arose out of simplicity (the easy).  The hypothesis of  
God offers no worthwhile explanation for anything, for it simply  
postulates what we are trying to explain.  It postulates the  
difficult to explain, and leaves it at that.  We cannot prove  
that there is no God, but we can safely conclude the He is very,  
very improbable indeed. >> 
 
Now to remove that last teeny weeny scrap of probability, to  
which he makes allusion, all we need is the known human tendency  
to fantasize, confabulate, and believe what they wish rather than  
what really exists, as Blackmore noted in parapsychology.  Of the  
two hypotheses, 1) god exists; or, 2) people make up gods; the  
second functions much better as a predictor of events in the  
world and that is all we ask of any scientific theory. 
 
If god existed, we would expect that descriptions of it would be  
more or less the same all over the world.  If people make up  
gods, we would expect gods to reflect local appearances.  If god  
were real and a source of morality, we would expect moral laws  
which claim to come from a god to be the same all over the world,  
if people make up gods, we would expect them to assign their  
local taboos and mores to divine sources. 
 
The idea that there is no god and that people make gods up  
functions so much better as a predictor of events that it is  
perverse to withold assent to it.  Were this any other area of  
human behavior, one that had not been infected by the "faith"  
virus, which tells you that believing impossible things is good,  
and that doubt is bad, there would simply be no argument. 
 
If you meet the Messiah on the road, crucify him.

After having written part 2, I experienced minor satori while

I certainly hope that the quotes from Dawkins were persuasive.

or I will send a copy of the Dawkins article, "Lions 10, 
Christians 0" to anyone who wishes. 
 
The first big thought was a gut-level appreciation of the truth  
and beauty of existentialism.  Existentialism was RIGHT!  This  
sounds like one of those things you write down in the middle of  
the night, when you think you've solved the problems of the  
universe while drunk or asleep, and then you wake up in the  
morning and all there is is something like "universe pervaded by  
odor of coffee."  But nooooo,... 
 
If I remember right, the main point of existentialism is that  
there is no such "thing" as "essence", there is only existence.   
>From Plato onward, certain philosophers and most theologians have  
believed that essence is the more important. For Plato, the real  
world was a mere shadowy representation of the perfect world of  
eternal essences.  The sin of reification.  I am using Plato only  
as a scapegoat, the problem is universal.  Existentialism has  
been around for a long time, I studied it 30 years ago, but I  
think we occasionally get lost, thinking about "the absurd",  
"hell is other people" and its other catch phrases, and forget  
about the main point. 
 
[How you could start from this, and then fall for some claptrap  
cobbled together patchwork of guesses like Marxism with a reified  
teleology of History, and Classes, is beyond me, but maybe I  
missed something.] 
 
[Taner Edis has pointed out, as part of his general  
antiphilosopher campaign, that many alleged existentialists are  
mere poseurs, spouting cliched phrases about absurdity and  
'existence precedes essence' without saying anything worthwhile.  
 I am not defending existentialism, except as it appeared to me  
at that moment, when I had an immediate apprehension of the  
difference between a wholly materialistic view, and one where  
"essences" or "spirits" are part of the deal.] 
 
We can see how people might get to thinking like this:  a circle  
drawn in the dirt is understood as an imperfect representation of  
the idea of a perfect two dimensional grouping of an infinite  
number of points all equidistant from one central point.  Does a  
Perfect Circle exist somewhere of which all our drawings are mere  
shadows?  If so, might there be a canonical, perfect Chair, or an  
eternal Rose, of which all real chairs and roses were also mere  
pathetic attempts at embodiment? 
 
As often is the case, we got it exactly ass backwards.  It is  
only in the head that this essence abstraction mechanism works at  
all.  We have an extremely well-developed ability to abstract  
similarities, to induce (i.e., the verb form of induction)  
relationships, and this creates the categories that make the  
essences appear to exist.  They don't.  Only things exist. 
 
Essence-thinking also allows you to believe that you are  
essentially a wonderful, decent person, while existentially you  
commit atrocities.  "My essence is goodness," you can say, while  
you are forced to foreclose the mortgage, twirling your  
moustache.  "The essence of the Church is sweetness and light,  
just right now we are forced to burn a few heretics, and  
slaughter unbelievers, but that's not the REAL essence of the  
church."  Existentialism says that essence only comes from being,  
what you do is what you are. 
 
Further enlightening meditations: 
 
1) First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then  
there is. 
 
2) There is no sky. 
 
3) North is not up. 
 
Sorry, for the apparent (or actual) incoherence.  The first, to  
me, means that "mountain," is a mere noise, a word, the thing is  
not a mountain, it simply is. The same goes for everything else. 
 
We think that by naming something we reveal, but in truth we 
conceal.  This causes inital confusion, as has just been 
demonstrated, but works itself out. 
 
2) Look up at night.  (I've been doing this every clear night  
lately staring at Comet Hyakutake).  What you are seeing is three  
dimensional, at least if it's clear.  Some stars are millions of  
light years further away than others.  There is no dome, no  
firmament.  Try to experience it directly.  Essences and all  
transcendental entities are only as real as that dome. 
 
3)  There is no "up" in the universe.  Virtually any line would  
do for a reference.  Avoid boreohomohemispherocentricity. (5) 
 
(5) The Trouble with Christmas, Tom Flynn. 
 
Like getting a gut level appreciation of Darwinism, ("actually,  
simple things *can* give rise to complex things, here's how it  
happens...") understanding that essences don't exist, and that  
many mores are purely arbitrary, rather than the result of Divine  
Fiat, or even Divine Honda, appears to be one of the things that  
people find hard to do.  Believing that essences exist leads one  
to the thought that the Ideal Government exists, that the Perfect  
Human exists, that there is One True Moral Code, and a lot of  
other serious mistakes.  And, of course, anyone who gets in the  
way of Perfection had better watch out. 
 
Existence is all there is. 
 
The material world is all there is. 
 
There is no transcendental to tempt us.  We create a falsehood  
and tempt ourselves with it. 
 
So, that is why, after experiencing this in a flash, (and you may  
be wishing it had been one of those ineffable experiences), the  
next thought was a clash of the alleged cry of the Jewish crowd  
at the crucifiction, "Let his blood be on us, and on our  
children..." clanging against the old Buddhist saying, "If you  
meet the Buddha on the road, kill him." 
 
I had always interpreted that latter to mean that, if you had any  
idea of the Buddha that could be articulated, you would have to  
get rid of that idea.  In fact, if there were still a "you" left,  
then you hadn't made it "there" yet. 
 
I then intuited that we, as atheists and humanists, should accept  
the responsibility for doing away with the supernatural, and the  
supernatural seeker, the transcendental tempter, in ourselves.   
We have slaughtered the supernatural and trashed the  
transcendental.  For real people living in the real world, it is  
not a bad thing to kill Santa, or his anagram, or Jesus.  Kill  
Krishna, murder Mohammed, massacre Mary, garotte god and hang the  
holy ghost; they are only ideas, and no idea is worth a human  
life, and any human life is worth hundreds of ideas.   The only  
good god is a dead god. 
 
Let his ichor be on us, and our memetic descendants.  I am proud 
to be a Christ-killer. 
 
The last stronghold of "god" is as the ground of essences.  (This 
is after eliminating god as the creator of the universe, the 
creator of life, or the source of consciousness, which we did 
last weekend.  The authority of the Bible, and other holy books, 
was destroyed long ago.  Try to keep up.)  Rather than a Platonic 
transcendental realm, christians speak of the Mind of God, even 
some scientists use the metaphor when speaking about the 
fundamental laws and relationships of the universe.  Chairness is 
an Idea in the Mind of God.  Morals exist eternally in the mind 
of god.  The conservation of energy, the Laws of Logic are Ideas 
of God, etc. 
 
Sooooo.....Anyway, that's why I thought, "If you meet the Messiah  
on the road, crucify him."  It's good advice.  Kill God, kill all  
gods.  By whatever method you choose.  Guilt, schmilt; Jesus is a  
stupid idea that is better off dead and gone.  We are all  
somewhat infected by Jesus and Christianity memes, or Moses and  
Judaism memes, or Mohammed and Islam memes or Krishna and Vedanta  
memes.  It is long past time for some spring mental house  
cleaning. 
 
Coda: 
Variations on the theme: 
"If you meet the Buddha by the road, kill him." 
 
"If you meet the Messiah on the road, crucify him."  
"If you see Santa coming down your chimney, light the fireplace." 
"If you see Mary in the sky, open your eyes."  
"Rabbit stew is a better meal than bunny eggs."  
"If you meet Holy the Ghost, say 'Boo!' and scare it to death." 
"If angels dance before you, turn the pin OVER, and poke!" [The  
real question is, How many angels can dance on the *point* of a  
pin?]  
"If Satan offers to buy your sole, refuse, but you *may* ~give~  
it away just for the halibut." 
 
OK, now things are just getting silly.

HAMILTON-WENTWORTH ROMAN CATHOLIC SEPARATE SCHOOL BOARD 
 
90 Mulberry Street				P.O. Box 2012 
Hamilton, Ontario L8V 4R1			(905) 525-2930 
 
MEMO TO:	APPLICANTS FOR TEACHING POSITIONS WITH THE 
		HAMILTON-WENTWORTH R.C. SEPARATE SCHOOL BOARD 
 
FROM:		MR. J.G. PONIKVAR 
		DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION 
 
RE:		H00: PASTORAL REFERENCE 
 
Thank you for your interest in seeking employment with this 
Board.  Roman Catholic Separate Schools of Ontario exist to 
provide Roman Catholic parents with the opportunity to ensure 
that their children receive a Catholic education.  Since Catholic 
parents may choose between public and separate schools, their 
choice of separate schools reflects their belief that the staff 
of a Catholic school will be committed to providing a different 
educational experience for their children than might be obtained 
in the public schools. 
 
The special character of the Catholic school depends, to a great 
extent, upon the religious character of the staff of the school.  
We believe, therefore, that we must employ teachers to whom we 
can confidently entrust the school and the students with the 
assurance that these teachers will give prime concern to 
cultivating the practice and development of the faith in 
themselves and in their students.  A commitment to these 
objectives is important if our schools are to maintain and 
strengthen the confidence and trust which our Catholic people 
have in our schools. 
 
The whole Catholic community has the responsibility of 
collaborating in the selection of staff for Catholic schools.  It 
is for this reason, therefore, that we seek the advice of our 
clergy when selecting candidates for positions in the school 
system.  We expect that each candidate will assist us in 
substantiating his/her commitment to the Church and to Catholic 
Education and also assure us of his/her willingness to give the 
special witness to the faith which is expected of Catholic 
teachers in Catholic schools. 
 
(Page 2) 
 
REASON FOR REQUESTING A PASTORAL REFERENCE 
 
1. The Catholic School Board has a duty: 
 
i) to employ teachers to whom it can confidently entrust the 
school and the students with the assurance that these teachers 
will give the practice and development of the faith prime 
concern, ii) to ensure that the character and leadership of a 
teacher is such that it will strengthen the confidence and trust 
of the people and the clergy in our Catholic Scholls, iii) to 
seek the advice of the local Church, in the person of its 
pastors, in providing our students and parents with teachers who 
will give solid witness to the faith in both word and example. 
 
2. Important Note 
  
References for teachers should be addressed to the Superintendent 
of Human Resources.  Each letter should be marked "confidential".  
The Superintendent will retain the references until such time as 
appointments have been confirmed by the Board.  References shall 
not be copied or distributed to anyone else.  It will be the 
Superintendent's responsibility to indicate whether or not the 
reference received is satisfactory.  Following the approval of 
the appointments the references will be destroyed. 
  
We suggest that candidates requesting references should be 
interviewed by the pastor and if possible, made aware of the 
contents of the reference.

3. Indicate the length of time and in what capacity you have 
known this candidate. (Give approximate dates) 
  
4. Does the candidate faithfully attend Sunday Mass and 
participate in the frequent reception of the Eucharist? (It is 
important that this minimum demonstration of commitment be 
clearly established in the reference.) 
  
5. To what extent has the candidate assumed extra 
responsibilities in parish life?  Indicate whether or not you 
consider the candidate's activity satisfactory in view of his/her 
aspiration, state of life and available opportunities. 
  
6. Is the candidate, to the best of your knowledge, of good moral 
character? 
  
7. Does the candidate, to the best of your knowledge, accept and 
profess the basic and essential truths of the Catholic faith?

commitment to his or her state of life qualify him or her for the 
position to which he or she aspires? 
 
(page 5) 
 
9. Do you have reason to believe that this candidate would be 
agood influence on the students under his or her care and on the 
other teachers with whom he or she would associate within the 
Catholic school community? 
 
  
10. Do you believe that this candidate would work to enhance and 
facilitate the high degree of co-operation which must exist 
between the Catholic school and the local pastoral team in such 
activities as: 
  
-sacramental preparation 
-liturgy preparation 
-preparation for celebration? 
 
 
 
11. Other comments which you believe need to be made in order to 
guide this administration in assessing the candidate's commitment 
and suitability as a teacher of Catholic children.

I got a copy of the application last year from a Roman Catholic 
acquaintance of mine.  I borrowed it from her long enough to race 
to the nearest photocopier, with my nose piched shut all the 
while.  I simply HAD to have a copy.  When I returned, she 
stuttered, "W-w-what are you going to do w-w-with it?"  I said, 
"Don't worry about it." 
 
One day this discriminarory piece of shit application will sit in 
a glass showcase in some Canadian museum.  Families will walk by 
and the kids will say, "Mommy,mommy, why did the Ontario 
government ever sponser that kind of religious discrimination?" 
 
"Shut up Suzie!  That document is a fake.  It's just a part of 
the Atheistic Master Plan to bring shame upon the Holy See."
