In the mythology and symbolism of our name, "Lucifer" is not to be
confused with ha-Satan, the mythological source of evil.  Lucifer's
ancient identity was a bearer of light, the morning star, and it is
as such that this journal intends to publish.

As the religion virus depends on obscurity, obfuscation, confusion,
irrationality and darkness in order to flourish, it is natural that
it would see light as an enemy.  Rational, skeptical inquiry has
ever been the enemy of all religions and is ultimately fatal to all
gods.

The purpose of this magazine is to provide a source of articles
dealing with many aspects of humanism.  Humanists have been
vilified by the religious as immoral.  Apparently, the most
horrible thing they can think of is an atheist.

As we find their values, such as faith in the non-existent,
obedience to the imaginary and reverence of the ridiculous,
repulsive, we adopt the name of their ancient antagonist with
pride.

We are atheistic as we do not believe in the actual existence of
any supernatural beings or any transcendental reality.

We are secular because the evidence of history and the daily
horrors in the news show the pernicious and destructive
consequences of allowing religions to be involved with politics and
nationalism.

We are humanists and we focus on what is good for humanity, in the
real world.  We will not be put off with offers of pie in the sky,
bye and bye.

Despite this beautiful explanation there are many who have objected
to the title of the magazine.  Therefore, a contest has been
announced to search for a new title.  The winner will receive
mention and a free subscription.

You may also vote to retain the current title.

So far, exchanging Lucifer for Phosphorous has been suggested, as
well as for Prometheus.  There has been a suggestion for Beyond
Belief.  Apparently, a new title means a new ISSN, which is not a
big problem.

Awaiting your responses.

Preface:

I want to get this information out, and announce the contest for a
new name.  Because this has to do with crimes of the clergy, (a
notoriously immoral and crime-prone group), it is exceptionally
long.  Thus, it would have been hard to include it with the
continuing articles "Christianity on Trial for Crimes against
Humanity," by Dr. Wendell Watters; a four part series beginning in
issue 2; and "Anti-Semitism, Its Prevalence Within the Christian
Right," by Skipp Porteous, a two part series beginning in issue 3.

Walker Story Banned, Reinstated. Following a campaign by the
Traditional Values Coalition led by Beverly Sheldon, the
California Board of Education committee in December pulled a
7-page story, "Roselily," by Pulitzer Prize-winning author
Alice Walker, from a statewide English test, for being
"anti-religious." Then Gov. Wilson endorsed a decision by
the state Board of Education to pull another Walker story
(for being "anti-meat-eating") from a statewide English
exam. Walker then rejected a Governor's Arts Award, which
would have designated her as a "state treasure." She agreed
to accept the award only after the state Board of Education
voted unanimously to reverse itself in March and return
stories by Walker and Annie Dillard to future achievement
tests for public students. Source: San Francisco Chronicle,

angered that 22 libraries permit the Washington Blade, a gay
newspaper, to be distributed in county libraries. Source:

with chairs, pelted with mud, spat upon, and berated as
"pigs" by the ultra-orthodox for daring to pray at
Jerusalem's Western Wall 5 years ago suffered a defeat
before the Israeli Supreme Court. It denied their petition

Man Sues Diocese For Molestation. While an altar boy in 1975
at Sacred Heart Church, Robert M. Delgado, now 30, says
Brother Jorge Ortiz Lopez sexually assaulted him in the
rectory. Delgado has filed suit against the Diocese of
Phoenix and the Franciscan Fathers of Arizona. Though a
police report indicated Delgado was intoxicated when he
entered Lopez's room, Lopez takes full responsibility and
punishment. The suit says the defendants promised to pay for
Delgado's counseling but have reneged on the agreement.

Assault Case Settled. A man, 28, who was recovering from
epileptic seizures in his apartment when he was attacked,
will receive $300,000 in damages from the Sierra Vista
Baptist Church for the sexual assault by John Adams Marshall
in April 1991. Marshall performed oral sex and fondled the
weakened man while pinning him down. The jury found the
church 40% liable for Marshall's assault and negligent in
retaining him as minister. Marshall did not lose his
ordination to be a minister elsewhere. Source: Inland Valley

Church Paper Omits Priest Abuse Ad. A national meeting for
victims of sexual abuse by priests was held in Marina del
Rey in late January. The group attempted for 3 weeks to
publish an ad for the meeting in Tidings, the newspaper of
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The church claims the ad was
lost from the computer due to the earthquake on Jan. 17.
This is the second time the paper has failed to run an ad
relating to sexual abuse by priests. Barbara Blaine, founder
of the survivors network, said, "I don't believe that their
excuses are the real reasons that the ad did not run."

Court Overturns Conviction. Even though the jury gave guilty
verdicts against Jon L. Walker, 45, pastor of Springfield
Baptist Church in San Luis Obispo, the court overturned the
1992 conviction of child sexual molestation and abuse of his
female cousin, because one of the jurors may have concealed
that he knew Walker and the woman. Both the defense and the
prosecution urged the judge to investigate the juror, but he
refused, with no reason. The woman, now 19, testified that
Walker began molesting her when she was 11 and began
intercourse when she was in 9th grade, until she was 15. She
now doubts whether she can go through another trial. The
defense requested bail and release of Walker, who is serving
a 12 year, 8 month prison sentence. Walker will remain
imprisoned. Source: Telegram Tribune, 2/15/94, 2/24/94

could receive up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all
counts. Blinkhorn was very well liked in the church, until
now. Source: Orange County Register, 3/10/94

TV Talk Show Host Jailed For Rape. The former talk show host
who equates himself with Jesus and MLK was sentenced to 14
years in prison for the rape of a girl, 13. Tito David
Valdez, Jr., 23, said (in an 8-page handwritten letter to
the judge) he is innocent because he would not have raped
the girl because he thinks she is ugly. Psychological
counseling was ordered. Source: AP, 3/94

Priestess Prostitute. A judge ruled that Church of the Most
High Goddess, which requires self-proclaimed priestess, Mary
Ellen Tracy, to have sex with parishioners, was not exempt
from prostitution and pandering laws. Tracy and her husband
claim they are victims of discriminatory prosecution. They
served 5-6 months in jail for prostitution and operating a
house of prostitution respectively. Source: Los Angeles

in a civil suit involving sexual abuse. Cikovic has admitted
to having sexual contact with a girl, 14. He was sentenced
in September to 6 months in jail and 20 years of probation
and is prohibited from contact with minors. The grandmother
of the child has filed suit for an undisclosed sum. The
grandmother had been taking the girl for counseling with the
priest because her parents had divorced. A parish employee
stated that Cikovic had taken girls on trips, and bought
them gifts, They said the priest made them "feel yucky."

Priest Resigns Amid Allegations. Though he denied any

Diocese Pays Lavigne's Victims. The Diocese of Springfield
has agreed to pay more than $1 million to 17 victims of Rev.
Richard R. Lavigne with the help of an insurance company.
However, the victims are not permitted to discuss the
specifics of the settlement lest they lose part of the
money. Lavigne pleaded guilty to child molestation but has

parishioners that the money for the case did not come from
their contributions, but from insurance and

Priest Acquitted. A Catholic priest of St. Pius X Church in
Middleton met a boy, 16, on a ski trip, then plied him with
Scotch and fondled him in his car and motel room. The boy
was a runaway from a school for emotionally troubled youths.
Thomas K. Ahearn, 56, was acquitted of molesting the boy,
but convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
He was sentenced to 2 years probation. The church relieved
Ahearn of his duties immediately . His future with the
church is uncertain. The mother felt the sentence was far
too light and says, "I'm a devout Catholic, and every time I
go to church I just want to throw up." Source: AP, Hartford

sexually abused by her stepfather, Truth Baptist Church's
Rev. Jim Rowley and another pastor began counseling the
father, who admitted abusing the girl. Rowley waited 6
months before reporting the abuse to authorities. He was
arrested and charged with a misdemeanor mandatory-reporting
violation and felony count of a risk of injury to a minor.
Clergy claim the law that is designed to help and protect
children violates their right to freely practice religion.
The stepfather was charged with over 30 counts of sexual
assault of the girl. He is now free on bond. Source:

when he was an altar boy, 14 years ago. This is the second
trial; the first trial, involving testimony from 2 other
men, was deadlocked. Rev. John R. Hanlon, 65, will be

Kansas City paid Richard Durocher $150,000 to silence his
accusations that he was sexually abused by Rev. John R.
Tulipana, 47, when he was 16, over a decade ago. Durocher
says officials have failed to remove Tulipana from contact
with minors as he is still actively serving in the diocese.
For this Durocher decided to break his secrecy agreement.
Tulipana has subsequently resigned because he felt he could

Former Priest Admits Abusing 30 Boys. In 1993 a civil suit
involving the Rev. Wilson Smart, 63, and plaintiff,
"W.T.M.," now 38, was settled for $1.7 million. In his
deposition Smart admitted sexually abusing and sometimes
photographing 30 boys, as young as 12, between 1957 and
1978, including W.T.M. for 8 years. He blames his
abusiveness on alcohol abuse and spent 5 months at the
Servants of the Paraclete center in New Mexico. He said he
met the boys in Scouting troops, in parishes or while
teaching and often molested them as they slept. He told no
one of the abuse, except in the protected privacy of
confession. He says he took no vow of chastity though he
knew it was morally wrong. Smart resigned from the
priesthood in May 1990. Case documents indicate that the
church knew of the abuse since 1960, but did not remove
Smart. W.T.M.'s lawyer asked the judge to open court
documents to counter information the church was distributing
about the case.Source: Missoulian, 2/4/94; Billings Gazette,

Santa Fe Diocese Settled 46 Cases. In the past 2 months the
Diocese of Santa Fe has settled 46 sexual abuse cases and is
being helped by its insurers, who still maintain they have
no liability in the cases. About 300,000 parishioners have
contributed $1.5 million to the settlements. But if the
insurance companies are not found liable to pay, the diocese
will have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Two
insurance carriers have sued the diocese saying they are not
liable, because the church knew of the abuses and did not
stop it or report it. Archbishop Michael Sheehan implies
knowledge of the abuse by saying, "No archbishop realized
fully the terrible harm of pedophilia. There was no
intention of harm." Source: Dallas Morning News, 2/14/94

Ex-Priest Sues Church, Pope. A man who spent 25 years as a
Roman Catholic priest, resigned in 1989 and is now
attempting to sue the Church, Pope John Paul II and Cardinal
John O'Connor of New York. Terence German, 51, says he knew
of clergy theft and pedophilia in every state he worked,

the pope points a finger at the U.S., there is clergy
pedophilia in Rome that the pope is ignoring. Now German is
unemployed and soon to be homeless. He says the church has

filing a frivolous lawsuit and advice from Bernardin's
attorneys "to do the right thing," Steven J. Cook, 34,
dropped Cardinal Joseph Bernardin from a civil suit charging
sexual abuse. Alhough Cook says he remembered some of the
abuse in 1970, there is no evidence to prove that the
memories were not introduced during hypnosis, according to

recalling repressed memories. Rev. Ellis Harsham remains a

Priest's Habit Was Touching Boys. The Rev. Francis E. Luddy,
accused of molesting at least 4 boys, is being sued for
unspecified damages by his godson, Michael Hutchinson, Jr.,
26, who also names  St. Therese's parish in Altoona and the
Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown. He says he was molested over a
decade ago. Luddy admits to molesting boys, including
Hutchinson's stepbrother, as far back as 1968 and said it
grew into a habit. Hutchinson testified that he received
money from Luddy for sexual favors in the early '80s.
Hutchinson has testified that the abuse began both when he
was 8 and when he was 11. This discrepancy led the defense
to challenge the plaintiffs credibility. Now retired Bishop
James Hogan testified that 3 priests (Rev. William Kovach,
Dennis Coleman and Joseph Gaborick) confessed to him that
they sexually abused children, but he only told them to keep
their mouths shut and "cool it" with the boys because the
"danger flags are up" that the diocese could be legally
liable for their actions. He admits never contacting the
parents of the children nor warning the officials of
parishes he relocated the priests into of the priests' past
behavior. Msgr. Philip Saylor testified that he informed
Hogan that Rev. Thomas Carroll had sexually molested a boy
and that Hogan only told Saylor to find a psychiatrist for
Carroll. Source: Centre Daily Times, 2/4,17/94, 3/4,10/94;
