TITLE: Virus Wars: A Serious Warning
FROM: PC Magazine
DATE: February 29, 1988
                              by: John C. Dvorak
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    A  new  computer virus is infecting microcomputers  around  the  world.  
    Where is the utility that will prevent our PCs from becoming victims in 
    this epidemic?
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      A  computer  virus (sometimes called a Trojan horse or a worm)  is  a 
    small  and sinister piece of software code that literally infects  your 
    machine.   It is inserted into a public-domain or bootleg program  and, 
    when the program is used, the virus code is alerted and rewrites itself 
    into  something in your system and typically (and eventually)  calls  a 
    hard  disk  routine  and  tells the disk  to  erase  itself.   Computer 
    sabotage.  It's getting worse and we should all be aware of it.  On the 
    West Coast a battle wages where Apple Macintosh users and IBM PC  users 
    are loading software with viruses to "attack" their foe: a user of  the 
    other kind of machine.
 
                               THE LEHIGH VIRUS
 
      Meanwhile,  one virus has made headlines.  It was released at  Lehigh 
    University.   Here's an excerpt from a memo sent out over  UseNet  from 
    Kenneth R. van Wyk, User Services Senior Consultant, Lehigh  University 
    Computing  Center.   It  describes the virus that was  set  loose  just 
    before Thanksgiving last year and is now floating around the world.
      "Last  week,  some  of our student  consultants  discovered  a  virus 
    program that's been spreading rapidly throughout Lehigh University.  It 
    has the chance of spreading much farther than just our University.   We 
    had  no idea where the virus started, but some users have told me  that 
    other universities have recently had similar problems.
      "The  virus  itself is contained in the stack space  of  COMMAND.COM.  
    When a PC is booted from an infected disk, all a user need do to spread 
    the virus is to access another disks via TYPE, COPY, DIR, etc.  If  the 
    other disk contains COMMAND.COM, the virus code is copied to the  other 
    disk.  Then, a counter is incremented on the parent.  When this counter 
    reaches  a  value  of  4,  and and every  disk  in  the  PC  is  erased 
    thoroughly.   The boote the FAT  tables,  etc.  
    All Norton's horses couldn't put it back together again.  This  affects 
    both  floppy  and hard disks.  Meanwhile, the four children  that  were 
    created  go on to tell four friends, and then they tell  four  friends, 
    and so on, and so on.
      "Detection:  while  the virus appears to be very  well  written,  the 
    author did leave behind a couple footprints.  First, the write date  of 
    COMMAND.COM  changes.   Second, if there's a write protect  tab  on  an 
    uninfected disk, you will get a WRITE PROTECT ERROR. So, boot up from a 
    suspected  virus'd disk and access a write-protected disk--if an  error 
    comes  up, then you're sure.  Note that the length of COMMAND.COM  Does 
    not get altered.
      "I urge anyone who comes in contact with publicly accessible disks to 
    periodically  check  their own disks.  Also, exercise  safe  computer--
    always wear a write protect tab.
      "This is not a joke.  A large percentage of our public site disks has 
    been gonged by this virus in the last couple days."
      The  mainstream computer magazines seldom discuss  these  destructive 
    little gags, even though there are plenty of them.  PC users must  make 
    themselves  aware  of  these things.  If a virus  program  got  into  a 
    corporation  and  started eating hard disks, you can be sure  that  the 
    next time someone brought in some software from home, it would  quickly 
    be confiscated.  This kind of thing only encourages MIS departments  to 
    take  total control of the microcomputer installation.  Remember,  that 
    most talented of the hackers love to design programs like this just  to 
    harass the average PC user.
      We  need  some  utilities that check the integrity  of  our  computer 
    systems.   Of course, these programs would be quickly defeated by  some 
    maniac who would find the loophole in the algorithm, and the  integrity 
    checker would have to be forever updated.  (Sounds like a money-maker!)  
    Some  say that the solution to these sick jokes is to perpetually  back 
    up  the  hard disk like a good little boy.  Great.  I back up  my  hard 
    disk  once a year whether it needs it or not.  So what am I  (and  most 
    users) supposed to do in between times?
      All you can do is be careful and know that someone out there is about 
    to make your life miserable if you're not prudent.

NOTA:


Viruses seem to be a very hot item these days as I've explained in previous
issues of TNS. Besides the many articles on viruses that have been published
(many of which are in previous issues of TNS or future issues) I have seen
several news reports on the dangers of computer viruses. All of this hysteria
has been caused by a few incidents at several universities here and Hebrew
University. Other tensions are still around because of the Chaos Computer
break-ins in NASA's SPAN network.
