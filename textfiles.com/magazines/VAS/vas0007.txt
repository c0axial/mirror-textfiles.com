        Yo-yo-yo its me again, the man who makes you sick back with some more
exciting text files. Today kiddies, we are going to discuss your friend and
mine, SATAN. In this three part series, we will tell you how to call satan
the proper way, The infernal names of Satan, and the 9 statements
of satan. This issue will be how to call upon our lord satan, directly from
the Satanic Bible...

        The magical language used in Satanic ritual is Enochian, a language
thought to be older than Sanskrit, with a sound grammatical and syntactial
basis. It resembles Arabic in some sounds and Hebrew and Latin in others.
It first appeared in 1659 in a biography of John Dee, the famous Sixteenth
Century seer and court astrologer. This work, by Meric Casaubon, describes
the occultist Dee's activites with his associate, Edward Kelly, in the art
of scrying or crystal gazing.
        Instead of the usual crystal ball, Kelly, who was the gazer, used a
many-faceted trapzohedron. The "angels" referred to in Kelly's first
revelation of the Enochian Keys, obtained thorugh the windows of the crystal,
are only "angels" because occultists to this day have lain ill with
metaphysical constipation. Now the crystal clears, and the "angels" are seen
as "angles" and the windows to the fourth dimension are thrown open - and to
the frightened, the Gates of Hell.
        I have presented my translation of the following calls with an archaic
but Satanically correct unvarninshing of the translation employed by the
Order of the Golden Dawn in the late Nineteenth century. In Enochian the
meaning of the words, combined with the quality of the words, unit to create
a pattern of sound which can cause tremendous reaction in the atmosphere.
The barbaric tonal qualities of this language give it a truly magical effect
which cannot be described.
        For many years the Enochian Keys, or Calls have been shrouded in
secrecy. The few printings that have existed have completely eliminated the
correct wording, as the proper translation has been disguised through the use
of euphimisms, and only designed to throw the inept magician and/or would-be
inquisitor off the track. Apocryphal as they have become, the Enochian calls
are the Satanic paeans of faith. Dispensing with such once-pragmatic
whitewashing in terms such as "holy" and "angelic", and arbitrairly chosen
groups of numbers, the purpose of which were only to act for substitutes for
"blasphemous" words - here, then, are the TRUE Enochian Calls, as received
from an unknown hand...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The first Enochian Key represents an initial proclamation from satan,
ş stating the inception of the laws of temporal theologies and of the lasting
ş power which resides in those bold enough to recognize earthly beginnings
ş and abosolutes.

        I reign over thee, saith the Lord of the Earth, in a power exalted
above and below, in whose hands the sun is a glittering sword and the moon a
through-thrusting fire, who measureth your garments in the midst of my
vestures, and trusseth you up as the palms of my hands, and brightened your
vestements with Infernal light.
        I made ye a law to govern the holy ones, and delivered a rod with
wisdom supreme. You lifted your voices and swore your allegiance to Him that
liveth triumphant, whose beginning is not, nor end cannot be, which shineth as
a flame in the midst of your places, and reigneth amongst you as the balance
of life.
        Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of yur creation! Be
friendly unto me, for I am the same!- The true worshipper of the highest and
ineffable King of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş In order to pay homage to the very lusts which sustain the continuance of
ş life, itself, The Second Enochian Key extends this recognition of our earthly
ş heritage into a talisman of power.

        Can the wings of the winds hear your voices of wonder?; O you!, the
great spawn of the worms of the Earth!, whome the Hell fire frames in the
depth of my jaws!, whom I have prepared as cups for a wedding or as flowers
regaling the chambers of lust!
        Stronger are your feet than the barren stone! Mightier are your
voices than the manifold winds! For you are become as a building such as is
not, save in the mind of the All-Powerful manifestation of Satan!
        Arise!, saith the First! Move therefore unto his servants! Show
yourselves in power, and make me a strong seer-of-things, for I am of Him that
liveth forever.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Third Enochian Key establishes the leadership of the earth upon the
ş hands of those greate Satanic magicians who thorughtout the successive ages
ş have held dominion over the people of the world.

        Behold!, saith Satan, I am a circle on whose hands stand the Twelve
Kingdoms. Six are the seats of living breath, the rest are as sharp sickles,
or the Horns of Death. Therein the creatures of earth are and are not, except
in mine own hands which sleep and shall arise.
        In the first I made ye stewards and placed ye in the Twelve seats of
government, giving unto every one of you power succesively over the Nine true
ages of time, so that from the highest vessels and the corners of your
governments you might work my power, pouring down the fires of life and
increase continually on the Earth. Thus you are become the skirts of justice
and truth. In Satan's name, rise up! Show yourselves! Behold!, his mercies
flourish, and his name is become mighty among us. In whome we say: Move!,
Ascend!, and apply yourselves unto us as the partakers of His secret wisdon in
your creation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Fourth Enochian Key refers to the cyclign of the ages of time.

        I have set my feet in the South, and have looked about me, saying: Are
not the thunders of increase those which reign in the second angle?
        Under whom I have placed those whom none hath yet numbered, but One;
in whom the second beginnings of things are and wax strong, successively
adding the numbers of time, and their powers doth stand as the first of the
nine!
        Arise!, you sons of pleasure, and visit the Earth; for I am the Lord,
your God, which is and liveth forever!
        In the name of Satan, Move!, and show yourselves as pleasent
deliverers, that you may praise Him among the sons of men!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Fifth Enochian Key affirms the Satanic placing of traditional priests
ş and wizards upon the earth for the purpose of misdirection.

        The mighty sounds have entered into the third angle and are become as
seedlings of folly, smiling with contempt upon the Earth, and dwelling in the
brightness of the HEaven as continual comforters to the destroyers of self.
        Unto whom I fastened the pillars of gladness, the lords of the
righteous, and gave them vessels to water the earth with her creatures. They
are the brothers of the First and the Second, and the beginning of their own
seats which are garnished with myriad ever-burning lamps, whose numbers are as
the first, the ends, and the contents of time!
        Therefore, come ye and obey your creation. Visit us in peace and
comfort. Conclude us recievers of your mysteries; for why? Our Lord and Master
is the All-One!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Sixth Enochian Key establishes the structure and form of that which
ş has become the Order of the Trapezoid and Church of Satan.

        The spirits of the fourth angle are Nine, mighty in the trapezoid,
whom the first hath formed, a torment to the wretched and a garland to the
wicked; giving unto them a fiery datrs to vanne the earth, and Nine continual
workmen whose courses visit with comfort the Earth, and are in government and
continuance as the Second and Third.
        Therefore, harken unto my voice! I have talked of you, and I move you
in power and presence, whose works shall be a song of honor, and the praise of
your God in your creation!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Seventh Enochian Key is used to invoke lust, pay homage to glamour, and
ş rejoice in the delights of the flesh.

        The East is a house of harlots singing praises among the flames of the
first glory wherein the Dark Lord hath opened His mouth; and they are become
as living dwellings in whom the strength of man rejoiceth; and they are become
as living dwellings in whom the strength of man rejoiceth; and they are
appareled with ornaments of brightness, such as work wonders on all creatures.
Whose kingdoms and continuance are as the Third and Fourth, strong towers and
places of comfort, the seats of pleasure and continuance. O ye servants of
pleasure, Move! Appear!, sing praises unto the Earth and be might amongst us.
For that to this remembrance is given power, and our strength waxeth strong in
our comforter.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Eighth Enochian Key refers to the emergence of the Satanic Age.

        The midday of the first is as the third indulgence made of hyacinthine
pillars, in whom the elders are become strong, which I have prepared for mine
own justice, saith Satan, whose long continuance shall be as bucklers to
Leviathan. How many are there which remain in the glory of the earth, which
are, and shall not see death until the house falls and the dragon doth sink?
Rejoice!, for the crowns of the temple and the robe of Him that is, was, and
shall be crowned are no longer divided! Coem forth!, Appear!, to the terror of
the Earth, and to the comfort of such as are prepared!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Ninth Enochian Key warns of the use of substances, devices, or
ş pharmecuticals which might lead to the delusion and subsequent enslavement
ş of the master. A protection against false values.

        A might guard of fire with two-edged swords flaming (Which contain the
vials of delusion, whose wings are of worm-wood and the marrow of salt), have
set their feet in the West, and are measured with their ministers. These
gather up the moss of the Earth, as the rich man doth his treasure. Cursed are
they whose iniquities they are! In their eyes are millstones greater than the
Earth, and from their mouthes run seas of blood. their brains are covered with
diamonds, and upon their heads are marble stones. Happy is he on whom they
frown not. For why? The Lord of Righteousness rejoiceth in them! Come away,
and leave your vials, for the time is such as requireth comfort!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Tenth Enochian Key creates rampant wrath and produces violence.
ş Dangerous to employ unless one has learnt to safeguard his own immunity;
ş A random lightning bolt!

        The thunders of wrath doth slumber in the North, in the likeness of an
oak whose brances are dung-filled nests of lamentation and weeping laid up for
the Earth, which burn night and day and vomit out the heads of scorpions and
live sulphur mingled with poison. These be the thunders that in an instant
roar with a hundred mighty earthquakes and a thousand as many surges, which
rest not, nor know any time here. One rock bringeth forth a thousand, even as
the heart of man doth his thoughts. Woe! Woe!, Yea!, woe be to the Earth, for
her iniquity is, was, and shall be great. Coem away! But not your mighty
sounds.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The eleventh Enochian Key is used to herald the coming of the dead and
ş establish a sustenance beyond the grave. To bind to the earth. A funerary
ş call.

        The mighty throne growed and there were five thunders that flew into
the East. And the eagle spake and cried aloud: Come away from the house of
death! And they gathered themselves together and because those of whom it
measured, and they are the deathless ones who ride the whirlwinds. Come away!
For I have prepared a place for you. Move therefore, and show yourselves!
Unveil the mysteries of your creation. Be friends unto me, for I am your God,
the true worshipper of the flesh that liveth forever.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Twelgth Enochian Key is used to vent one's displeasure towards man's
ş need for misery, and bring forth torment and conflict to the harbringers
ş of woe.

        O ye that range in the South and are the laterns of sorrow, buckle
your armour and visit us! Bring forth the legions of the army of Hell, that
the Lord of the Abyss may be magnified, whose name amongst ye is Wrath! Mve
therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto
me, for I am the same!, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King
of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Thirteenth Enochian Key is used to make the sterile lustful and vex
ş those who would deny us the pleasures of sex.

        O ye swords of the South, which have eyes to stir up the wrath of sin,
making men drunken which are empty; Behold! the promise of Satan and His
power, which is called amongst ye a bitter sting! Move and appear! Unveil the
mysteries of your creation! For I am the servant of the same, your God, the
ture worshipper of the higfhest and ineffable King of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Fourteenth Enochian Key is a call for vengeance and the manifestation
ş of justice.

        O ye sons and daughters of mildewed minds, that sit in judgment of the
iniquities wrought upon me - Behold! the voice of Satan; the promise of Him
who is called amongst ye the accuser and supreme tribune! Move therefore, and
appear! Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto me, for I am the
same!, the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Fifteenth Enochian Key is a resolution of acceptance and understanding
ş of the masters whose duty lies in administering to the seekers after
ş spiritual gods.

        O thou, the governor of the first flame, under whose wings are the
spinners of cobwebs that weave the Earth with dryness; that knowest the great
name "righteousness" and the seal of false honor. Move therefore, and appear!
Open the mysteries of your creation! Be friendly unto me, for I am the same!,
the true worshipper of the highest and ineffable King of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Sixteenth Enochian Key gives recognition of the wondrous contrasts of
ş the earth, and of the sustenance of these dichotomies.

        O thou second flame, the house of justice, which hast thy beginnings
in glory and shalt comfort the just; which walketh upon the EArth with feet of
fire; which understands and seperates creatures! Great art thou in the God of
stretch-forth-and-conquer. Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries of
your creation! Be friendly unto me for I am the same!, the true worshipper of
the highest and ineffable King of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Seventeenth Enochian Key is sued to enlighted the benumbed and destroy
ş throught revelation.

        O thou third flame!, whose wings are thorns to stir up vexation, and
who hast myriad living lamps going before thee; whose God is wrath in anger -
Gird up thy loins and harken! Move therefore, and appear! Open the mysteries
of your creation! Be friendly unto me for I am the same!, the true worshipper
of the highest and ineffable King of Hell!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ş The Nineteenth Enochian Key is the greatest sustainer of the natural balance
ş of the earth, the law of thrift, and of the jungle. It lays bare all
ş hypocrisy and the sanctimoniuous shall become as slaves under it. It brings
ş forth the greatest outpouring of wrath upon the miserable, and lays the
ş foundation of success for the lover of life.

        O ye pleasures which dwell in the first air, ye are mighty in the
parts of the Earth, and execute the judgment of the mighty. Unto you it is
said: Behold the face of Satan, the beginning of comfort, whose eyes are the
brightness of the starts which provided you for the government of the Earth,
and her unspeakable variety; furnishing you a power of understanding to
dispose all things according to the providence of Him that sitteth on the
Infernal Throne, and rose up in the Beginning saying: The Earth, let her be
goveren by her parts; and let there be division in her; The glory of her may
be always drunken and vexed in itself. Her course, let it run with the
fulfillment of lust; and as a handmaiden, let her serve them. One season, let
it cofound another; and let there be no creature upon or within her the same.
All ehr nubmers, let them differ in their qualities; and let there be no one
creature equal with anohter. The reasonable creatures of the Earth, and Men,
let them vex and weed out one another; and their dwelling places, let them
forget their names. The work of Man and his pomp, let them be defaced. His
buildings, let them become caves for the beasts of the field! Counfound her
understanding with darkness! For why? It repenteth me that I have made Man.
One while let her be known, and another while a stranger; because she is the
bed of a harlot, and the dwelling place of Lucifer the King.
        Open wide the gates of Hell! The lower heavens beneath you, let them
serve you! Govern those who govern! Cast down such as fall., Bring forth those
that increase, and destroy the rotten. No place, let it remain in one umber.
Add and diminish until the stars be numbered. Arise! Move! and appear before
the covenant of His mouth, which He hath sworn unto us in His justice. Open
the mysteries of your creation, and make us partakers of the undefiled wisdom.
