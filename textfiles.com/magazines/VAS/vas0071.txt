into the FTP site once I have some time...

From:  rml3362@venus.tamu.edu 

I am a popular commodity amoung some people I know, I am the only one
who knows how to roll a joint. Now this is because I tend to be older
than most of the people who smoke dope around me and have a bit more
intense life lesson than others.

I like rolling joints. It is a very viscereal pleasure, you get to
play with the nifty green stuff and it gives your hands something to
do. This is especially nice if it is good if you don't wanna get
really stoned but just catch a nice buzz and instead of keeping your
hands busy smoking you keep 'em busy rolling.

I like that green stuff. It's cool, kinda like oregano or some other green 
bulk spice but you know it aint. It has the smell, strange how
so many people don't groove to it, ahh well learnd response, like
appreciating good scotch. It reminds me of harvest day, right after
the fruit has been reaped and the oils and esthers fill the air. Very
good green homey feel to it. Then you get into carding the stuff to
take out the seeds and stems and to break it down so it will roll
effectively. It has to feel right, a bit drier than the best feel,
where it is so sticky with resin that all you can do is load it into
a bowl and do bong hits until your brain goes numb. 

You gotta decide how fine you are gonna sift the shake. I know some
who remove everything until nothing is left but a fine red dust. I
don't like that, it takes too long, and casues too many volatiles to
be released as you card it, and makes really lousey joints that pack
too tightly and don't draw worth shit. We all roll joints to match our
personality, my joins tend to have stuff in them that shouldn't be
there, leave things on the tray that SHOULD be, double paper walled,
kinda fat in the middle, nice where it meats the mouth, and fulla
garbage that gets burnt. 

Once you got the grass ready you them have to get you papers in order.
The way I learned to make a joint was to make a boat out of the paper.
Take the paper in you hand so that the gummed side is up and the
crease is away from you, the short sides are called edges and the long
sides are called sides. You fold the end towards the side, each in turn. 
First you take the left edge and you fold it about the top corner of
that edge, bringing the lower corner up to where it meets the top side
and the edge is perfectly in line with the side. Then you do the same
thing about the bottom corner, and then you do it for each of the
other corners on the other side. You have to make sure all the creases
are away from you, then, from where the two bisectors meet on out to
the edge you fold agains the crease, you fold in the same place but in
the other direction of the original crease

You do that with each edge and you get a little paper boat into which
you can shift your sift. After having thoughly raked the herb you wind
up with a little mound of grass, how big depends on how strong the
grass is, how big the papers are, and how stoned you wanna get. I
usually use a bit more than would fill a large bowl. You pick the
gras up between you fingers and dust it into the paper boat. Try to
get it even but don't worry about it you can fix it. Towards the
bottom of the mound you run into stuff too fine pick up with your
fingers, I consider it a point of grace to card once, and once only,
it back into a smalled mound and then try to get at least one good
pinch or two from it and let the rest of the shit go back into the
baggie until one is scaping for anything green that burns. As you load
the paper you are gonna spill dust, just let it go. Make sure you load over 
the tray and you will either get it with the cleanup card or smoke it
some other time.

Now you take your boat full of dope and begin leveling it. Stir it
about with your finger to balance as much as possible and then you
will begin rolling it. Make sure the gummed side is away from you if
there is one. You roll it to settle the grass and get it
even, and ya try to get it to spread out towards the edges. This is
where people who use doller bills use them, I always thought it was
too much hassle to fuck with. Once you have it spread to suit your
desires you then have to roll the paper up into a joint. This is the
tricky part. I always try to finish rolling it so that it is very near
the ungummed edge and then to just fold that over and roll it up. Try
to get it a bit tighter than you wanna some cause it will looesen as you
roll it up. Just before your finished you have to lick the gum. The
best I ever saw anyone do that was this little oriental girl I knew
who had the most pointed tounge that was always moist. She had absolute
control over her tounge, she could make it do things that would give
you an orgasm just watching the movements. I being who I am tend to
either slobber a bit too much or not get enough on there, it could be
better but it works. You finish rolling it up and and then you gotta
close the sides.

The best way I have found to close the sides is to just roll one end
and figure what gets caught gets caught and turn it so the other end
is upright and then use a small poker to pull out things which stick
out and push in the stuff that needs to go inside. Roll the ends
counter to each other and lick to close. I got friends that stick half
the damned joint in thier mouths, and others who just touch it to
thier tounge. I am undecided, the wetter it gets the better the joint
is but it just grates my aesthetics. Let it dry and you gotta joint. I
tend to double wrap mine, by rolling that joint in annother, it
strengths that fragine middle section and generally keeps a tight nice
looking joint. I also tend to tear off that messy end, the one that
caught what got caught, to suck on, and use the flashy paper tail to
light it.

	Last week I celebrated my promotion (like getting tenure at U of
Chicago).  After giving every one a "Hemp Saftey Course" including the
video of "Hemp for Victory" I brought out a batch of brownies.  The "pro's"
in the group said they tasted like "liquid hash".  Most people said they
felt good till 4pm the next day.  So I thought I'd share the recipe with
the net:
	Start with Hershey's Premium Baking Bar Unsweetened Chocolate.
On the back is a recipe for brownies which includes 1 cup butter, 4 squares
of chocolate, 2 cups sugar, 4 eggs, 1 cup of flour, and vanilla extract.
Start with dry hemp leaves and grind them in a coffee grinder to a fine 
powder.  Put in a measuring cup until ~75 ml of "green flour" is made.
Fill to the 1 cup mark (250 ml) with regular flour.  Proceed with recipe
on box: Heat oven to 350 F, Grease 13x9x2 (inch) pan.  Heat butter and
chocolate and stir with wooden spoon until smooth.  Stir in sugar.  Add
eggs one at a time.  Add vanilla extract and stir in flour mixture.
Add nuts if desired (a very nice touch I think) and bake for 40 minutes.
It seemed to take 10 minutes longer than the box suggested (30 minutes)
to be completely baked through.  Makes 3 dozen brownies.  Take 2 and wait
an hour.  Take 4 and cruise for 12 hours.  Enjoy!

In the interests of making marihuana use a little bit safer, to prove that 
use does not automatically equate to lung cancer, here are two use methods 
that bear attention:
 
The Dual-Chambered, Hot-Cold Bong

[it was noted in a followup that a hot-hot bong would supposedly be better
 because the temperature is not the key, its the water vapor.  Experiment
 and figure out for yourself what works better  -- Lamont]

        |   Cooling Coils   |
        +-------------------+
 
Basically, the principle goes like this: Most of the carcinogens in 
marihuana smoke are water-soluble.  THC is not.  Therefore, the bong was 
invented to remove carcinogens and to cool the smoke.  However, warm to hot 
water does tend to remove more carcinogens than does cold water, so using 
hot water would seem to make the smoke much safer to breathe (and still 
avoid lung cancer), except that the point of cooling the smoke is lost.
 
Thus, the Dual-Chambered Bong was designed to remove the most carcinogens 
as well as cool the smoke for inhalation.  Basically, the first, hot 
chamber is filled to the brim with water, and beneath it is placed some 
form of heating unit (or inside it, or whatever can be done to keep it hot).
Next, a short distance away, the second, cold chamber is placed with some 
way of keeping the area the smoke passes through really cold (such as: cold 
water with icepacks around the chamber; ice packed around a coiled tube; 
liquid nitrogen or dry ice poured/piled around the coiled tube; cold water 
in the chamber with cold water being pumped around the outside through a 
tube coiled around the chamber; etc.) to cool the smoke.  Then you keep the 
marihuana in the bowl lit by your favorite method, and treat it like an 
ordinary bong.  Since this apparatus is fairly complex, it is suggested 
that you disguise or have disguised the D-C Bong as some form of dualistic 
statuary (such as a couple kissing, where the point at which their lips 
meet is the link between the two chambers) to prevent police busts from 
wasting your investment on materials and design.

For the baker or cook with less of a turn for smoking marihuana, the 
following is a recipe for marihuana brownies suggested by Timothy Leary.
 
Brownie Recipe

> what is 'hash oil'? 

Its a thick black oil made from hash.  The hash is heated and pressed to 
release the oil.  (Same process used to make hash from marijuana, but carried
to an extreme.)  Its almost like a tar; very sticky, very thick.

> how is it used?

I've never seen it in the US, but When I lived in England, some 10 years ago,
it was occasionally available.  It came in two forms; sometimes it would be
in a little plastic vial.  Other times it would come in a piece of aluminum
foil.  From what I recall, the point was not to burn it, as that would burn
off the active ingredients; but you wanted to inhale the vapor from it.

The usual procedure was to get some heat resistant tube; the favorite was a
the clear plastic tube that is the body of a bic disposable pen.  Pull out the
end cap, and pull out the ink/ballpoint thingy.  Result: a clear plastic tube.
Then, smear a small amount of the oil on a piece of aluminum foil.  Hold the
foil with pliers.  With the oil on top, heat from beneath with a lighter.
Hold the end of the tube above the patch of oil.  As you begin to apply heat,
suck like hell.  The pliers (or something) are necessary because foil is
an excellent conductor of heat, and you can burn yourself.  It may take
several heatings to use up all the oil from a smear.  (You'll note this takes
three hands!)

For a nicer piece of equipment, take an old tablespoon.  Bend the handle so
that the handle bends away from the bowl, and then back so that it is pointing
up away from the bowl.  Attach same pen tube to the handle so that it points
down into the bowl of the spoon.  Smear oil into bowl of spoon, and heat
spoon from bottom. (This only takes two hands.)

Another technique, if you roll your own cigarettes, is to smear a streak of
oil on a cigarette paper, and then roll a cigarette with this paper.

I grew up in England, and when I was in high school (pun intended? ;-) there,
all we could ever get was hash.  For some peculiar reason, no one ever thought
to use pipes.  So we had to roll cigarettes with roll-your-own tobacco, and
put crumbs of hash in them.  Sometimes, to avoid the tobacco, we'd use
disassembled clove cigarettes, or herbs like tarragon.

If you've never used hash, (which I've never seen in the US,) it comes as a
brown-green brick, which is VERY hard.  You warm a corner over a lighter to
soften it, and break crumbs off of it.  You can't roll j's with this stuff; its
solid.  (Sometimes, good stuff is very dark in color, even black; this is
usually very soft, and if squeezed, drops of hash oil may sweat out.)

I don't seem to recall it being very common to find head shops where you could
buy smoking equipment proper, but tobacco and rolling papers were very common.
I don't think equipment was common, because I do remember a couple of pieces
of homemade equipment; one friend of mine made a bong in his ceramics class.  I
made one with a thistle tube, cork, glass tubing, and erlenmeyer flask from
a chemistry set of mine.

No, make that very, Very, VERY sticky.  Sticks to everything.  stays under
your fingernails for weeks after you've tried everything imaginable to get
it out (and you try everything imaginable because the milligram or so that's
stuck there is worth some money).  It ruins clothes; the only thing that
will take it off your skin or countertops is denatured alcohol or a similar
solvent.  The stickiest shit I have ever seen.

>> how is it [hash oil] used?

It turns up at dead shows occasionally.  A "friend" had some that came from
jamaica, which is where he assumes it was made.

"friend" says the smoke is better than the vapor.

Don't use a ballpoint pen unless you like to waste money (oil, same
difference).  This stuff costs a fortune--"friend" says $35/gram when you can
get it.  It's really not worth it at that price.  Anyway, as far as heating it
vs. warming it, "friend" says he's tried it both ways.  Both ways it's real,
real hard on your throat (worse than the harshest weed--almost as bad as that
"black morrocan" lettuce O shit).  It's a little harsher if you do the vapor
thing.  "friend" says seems to be more effective smoked, plus you waste less.

best vapor method:  put an old knife on a stove burner ("friend" used an
electric stove; use a gas job at your own risk).  let it get nice and hot (red
hot isn't too hot, but of course you don't wanna deform the knife...).  Get a
paper towell tube or similar-size tube.  GATHER EVERYONE AROUND CLOSE.  use a
real thin screwdriver or similar instrument to get a little dab of oil, stand
ready with the tube, press the screwdriver against the hot blade and suck.
don't take too much; it's got incredible expando properties.  The stuff will
smoke uncontrollably till it's gone, so make sure everyone gets in their suck
without letting too much go to waste (it's good if everyone has their own
tube). 

The aluminum foil method is okay, but "friend" thinks it's a little more
wasteful.  Eventually ya gotta throw that foil out.

"friend" says best way to do it is to roll it with some herb (tobacco kills).
Another good way to smoke it (according to friend) is to line a screened bowl
with rolling paper or leaf and put a drop in there.

However you do it, take SMALL hits.  the shit is lethal on your lungs.

Actually, now that friend thinks about it, the best way to do it is to put
about 10 grams in a 13x7" brownie pan with your favorite brownie recipe.  cut
into ~1.25" squares.  Eat one and have a wonderful night (sex is highly
recommended).  Eat two and become part of your favorite couch for 5 hours or
so.  Eat 5 or 6 and find out what heroin's like without having to mess with
needles. 

Of course $350 is a hell of an expensive pan of brownies.
>I always found that hash oil was much stonier than hash. (Whatever that
>means.....)  It gave me more of that feeling in my eyes of being in a smoky
>room when I was stoned on plain hash or mj leaves.

friend likes good hash better.  Easier to smoke, tastes better.  Right about
the buzz tho.  VERY intensly relaxing, almost paralyzing.

>Of course, this was all long ago, and I don't do that sort of thing anymore....
Of course, neither does friend.
:^)

A word of advice (from friend):  BE CAREFUL when buying this shit.  It's real,
real easy to get ripped off, and doling out $35 for a gram of roofing tar is
quite a bummer.

Is hash oil mentioned in a faq?  I'm too lazy to look.  If it's not it should
be. 

Oh, friend tells me to add one more thing: heating up the vial will make the
stuff a lot easier to deal with (liquifies it).  Also makes it more prone to
spillage, so take great care when handling it in its liquid form.  You can
heat the vial with a lighter or put it on an electric stove burner.

God, my friend is such a drug-craving unAmerican lowlife.:^)

This comes from a friend of mine that doesn't have net access, so I won't be able to supply further details...

1. Run all leaf through a wire mesh sifter (such as a kitchen flour sifter)
2. Completely soak the leaf with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol for about 4 or 5 days.
3. Strain resultant product through silk (used for silk-screening)
4. Evaporate remainder by applying very low heat from kitchen stove
   Caution: be very careful - the product is *quite* flammable
5. After evaporating, there will be a remaining "goo". This is the hash oil.
[It was noted in a followup that ispropyl alcohol is generally sold denatured,
 so that its vile to drink.  The chemicals which denature it, however,
 *should* get evaporated by step 4, and further combusted when you smoke it.  
 Therefore the effect of these chemicals *should* be minimal, but since I

 Use acetone instead of alcohol. THC is SUPER soluble in acetone - soak
 the ground-up leaves in acetone, then distill it off. best purity from
 any solvent I've ever tried. Next best choice is petroleum ether. Seriously,
 alcohols are too H2O - soluble for really good purity - lots of other
 nonpsychoactive stuff gets in the oil.

  P.S. once you've got the oil, it's REALLY sticky & hard to handle. mix with
  2 parts powdered leaf to form good hash.

   you're welcome.

Subject: THC extraction

Just for fun.  Here are some exerpts from the Experimental section of
a paper by Adams, Hunt, and Clark, JACS 62, 196 (1940).

    The hemp used in these experiments grew wild in Minnesota during
    the season of 1938.  It was cut in August, after flowering had
    begun but before seed had "set" in the female tops.  It was stored
    for six weeks in a room where a fan assured circulation of air in
    order to dry it completely.  No molding occurred.  The material
    was then beaten and shaken to remove the coarse stems which ammount-
    ed to about one-third of the total dry weight.  The stems were dis-
    carded and the relatively fine material that remained was extracted
    with 95% ethanol [equivalent to Everclear] in the manner described
    below.

    Four 20-gallon (75-liter) crocks, each holding approximately 23 lb.
    (10 kg.) of material, were set up in series for countercurrent
    extraction.  Each crock held approximately 61 liters of solvent of
    which about 41 liters were withdrawn at each transfer, the remain-
    der being retained by the hemp.
    ...
    The operations just described were carried out by Dr. John R. Matchett
    and his assistants in the Narcotics Laboratory of the Treasury
    Department, Washington, D.C.  They kindly furnished us with a gener-
    ous supply of ethanol extract. [don't you wish you had connections
    like that?]

The rest of the procedure involved removing ethanol and low boiling
components under reduced pressure (about 30 mm) and gradually increased
temperature (up to 200 C).  The remaining oil was distilled at 3 mm,
between 100-220 C.  This crude oil (180-200 g) was disolved in petroleum
ether (b.p. 30-60 C) and washed twice with water.  The pet. ether was
distilled off and the oil distilled at 2 mm, collecting the fraction
boiling at 175-195 C, yielding 90-110 g of "purified red oil."

So that's how the big boys did it back then.  University of Illinois
students and alums should note that the author Adams is none other than
Roger Adams for whom the chem lab is named.

At the time this paper was written it wasn't known just what the active
ingredient in pot was.  Cannabinol was the first compound identified in
red oil, and cannabidiol had just recently been isolated.  From the
conclusion of the introduction:

    Red oil probably contains other products closely related to canna-
    binol or cannabidiol in structure, such as partially hydrogenated
    cannabinols, isomers of cannabidiol, or molecules like cannabidiol
    with less unsaturation.  A large number of closely related compounds
    is possible.  The active marihuana principle or principles may be
    among this group of substances.  On the other hand, the possibility
    of the presence in red oil of a very potent active compound, entirely
    unrelated structurally to cannabinol or cannibidiol, is not excluded.

Very soon after that is was determined that THC was the active principle.
Roger Adams synthesized THC and several related compounds, some of which
were several times more potent than THC.  Roger Adams has a number of
interesting papers, Joe Bob says "check it out."

I don't personally own these books; I just saw them in a "books by phone" 
catalog along with a bunch of other books--you know, Knuth's _Art of
Computer Programming_ volumes 1-3, Wirth's _Algorithms + Data Structures_...

_Cannabis Alchemy_, by Gold, 1990

_Great Book of Cannabis by Cherniak_, 1983

_Marijuana Chemistry by Starks_, 1990

I realize the above info is vague, but that's all the books by phone catalog
listed.

Please perpetuate this information as widely as possible, the better to teach
people how to avoid addictive behavioral sequences while continuing to explore
the realms of awareness in a mature and thoughtful manner.

Also, there was much discussion of "double boilers".  You use a double boiler
whenever you are trying to heat, and evaporate volatile liquids.  It should
be reasonably obvious that this is necessary to boil off the [acetone|alcohol|
isopropyl alcohol] which you would mix with the hash.  A double boiler is
simplely a large pot with water in it, which contains a smaller pot with the
"pot" in it.  The water in the large pot boils, heating the smaller pot but
never exceeding the temperature of the boiling point of water.  Thus, there is
a much smaller risk of blowing yourself up.  

When dealing with flammable liquids like these solvents, proper ventalation
is required, and flames are an absolutely contraindicated.  There is a stupid
text file running around the net on how to "make" Methamphetamine, which is
actually a procedure for extracting psudoephedrine.  One of the brilliant
suggestions by the authors of this article was to evaporate by placing a
solvent on a hot water heater.  This is dumb.  Real dumb.  Particularly if
you've got a gas hot water heater with a pilot light.  (Can you say "Kaboom"
boyz & girls?  I knew you could...).  Be a little careful.

I don't ever touch marijuana anymore, but I had to comment on the correct
method of smoking hash oil. When I was younger I had a girlfriend who lived
in Calumet, in a little house on the edge of town. Across the road was
an old tailings heap covered in long grass that waved in the wind. Anyway, 
she loved to drink ginger brandy and she loved to get high. She had some
hash oil that summer and we smoked it together. Actually, I had more fun 
smoking it being high afterward. It was really too strong. But the smoking
method was a kick, and it didn't waste any of the oil. 
    We would sit at her kitchen table and heat a small, thin glass pipe
with a crook in it, but no bowl (there had been a bowl once, but it had
broken off, and it was not needed for the method) and heat the lower part 
WITH A PROPANE TORCH. Once the glass was glowing red, one of us would 
dip a wire loop into the hash oil and apply it to the inside of the lower
extremity of the glass tube while the other person inhaled.
    The oil vaporized instantly, but some always precipitated on the inside
of the pipe. After a few hits, we would 'cook' the pipe with the torch along
its length to get this resin out. 
    I maintain that this method, as opposed to others described, is truly
efficient and easy--AND YOU GET TO WAVE A FLAMING PROPANE TORCH AROUND
WHILE GETTING UNREASONABLY HIGH!!

[Disclaimer:  If you need a disclaimer to point out the potential danger of
 doing this, then you're too dumb to live and we can just think of it as
 natural selection in action -- Lamont]
