For many years, we at VaS have been bashing Emmanuel Goldstein and 2600
magazine. And, as usual everyone has copied off of us, but i ocasionally get
an email or msg on irc along the lines of "Why are you ripping on emmanuel,
he's 'l33t". Well, emmanuel was never "'l33t", and if u think so, i'll let you
in on a new secret red box.. This is easier to do than that greeting card
shit. Just walk up to any payphone, slit your wrists and pour the blood into
the quarter slot. Then u w1ll g3t phr33 c4llZ d00dz!@!@!@! But seriously,
emmanuel has been around forever(1984?), yet he still has never hacked
ANYTHING. And for all those who didn't know, he was the genious technical
advisor behind the greatest movie of all time: Hackers. Enough bullshit on
emmanuel.. He does a better job making himself look like an idiot then we
ever could.  Recently, #2600 had an "0pWaRzz" where emmanuel was kick/banned.
These are parts of the logs of this "opwar". We have cut out the non-important
parts for clarity and to not bore the fuck out of the reader. We have in no
way modified any of the following. No matter how coked up it sounds, emmanuel
actually said this shit.

 Commander Keen is a big strong boy who runs from building to building. He
 has nice little legs and a tight ass. He is so strong and it makes me sweat
 when he uses his long titanium shaft pogo-stick to overcome large slimy
 throbbing jelly-like monsters. He's so petite and sweet. I would just like
 to take him out of the game and make him run around in my pocket.
