        Greets, again.  The reason i haven't been writing in a long time is
        because i've been busy.  If you are pissed because you haven't read
        my volumes of glorious philosphy, fuck off.

        Now back to me.  a Long time ago, a dood named Tzeentch appeared on
        the 714 modempunk scene.  I mainly called PD systems, and RPG BBS's
        and thought 'this blows rancid emu nards..' and looked for something
        more intresting to do.  So, I called a modem pal, a dude named Horus
        (Looks like an oriental Elvis) who just got into the UlTiMatEsT
        'WaReZZzZ Scene'.  It was fun, for about two days. Then I started
        getting into the Phun shit, by joining a then forming group called
        P/HARM.  With the help of my friend Cyberpunk. During this time I
        changed my Handle to VAMPYRE.  I then turned 16 and we started dooing
        Gnarly drugs, and burglarizing Ma Bell for Fun and profit.  It was a
        blast.  Then, Cyberpunk got nailed for an Unrelated Burglary, and
        P/HARM stopped Burglarizin' in phavor of the more mellow stuff, such
        as beige boxing and code hacking.

        DISASTER STRiKES!: Actually, PHArm just broke up due to prezident
        Dopey's Nasty Cocaine habit.  the group split, and our sites went
        down....

        I quit Modempunking for about 6 months, and started Raving.  IT was
        ok I guess, But my Favorite form of Music is DEATH/GRiNDCorE.  I like
        some Industrial stuff like Laibach.  Hardcore Techno is cool on
        occasion, also.  I started using meth regularly, and I got bored and
        got sick of waking up not knowing where I was.  I got sick and tired
        of fucking up. I couldn't remeber, allot, and my school grades went
        to shit.

        Nocturnus Mellows Out: It was during this time that i met my current
        Girl friend, Who helped pull me out of the shit my life was in. The
        Only drugs I do now are Meth(once in awhile at least), Pot Shrooms,
        Acid, and Occasionally MDMA(X for you Idiots).

        Nocturnus Joins the Circus: I started Modeming agian.  714 sucked
        slop, so I started PBX hacking. And Calling LD. It was also during
        this time I started Buying Selling 'Sterile' Firearms.  This Quicky
        got sticky, and I still have a Warrant out there.... hehehe. I got
        Busted, got probabtion, and don't sell them anymore. So DON'T ask me
        to get you one, assholes.  I was into the NuKE scene(not a member,
        mind you) But they broke up, and I was pissed. I continue to Hack,
        Phreak, Destroy Ma-Bell Property,

        I get fucked up(not as Much as I used to.  I then Saw an ad for a
        board called PoT(which is DOWN) and I saw some .TXT files by people
        as Sick and fucked up as I was. So, I wrote one. and here I am.  My
        Specialties are 'Social Engineering', Internet stuff, Burglary, and
        'boxing'. I'm also a competent PBx hack(you know Sys75,85, ROLM..etc)
         Learning VAXEN VMS, and will be messing with your mind shortly.

        I have a DEEP Hatred for Ma-Bell. THey must all be destroyed. kill
        kill, maim, Dismember, Lick up the Steaming Entrails.

	ALWAYS fuck with the Fone CO. They rip us off Daily. fuck them.

         Hair color:  Black
           Computer:  XT-DOS & MINIX

  I like computers. Just started this stuff a while ago. I have done a little
  hacking like 10 or 15 accounts in the last 5 months and it's really boring 
  until you finally get it. I first owned a ZX81, then an Apple II, and Short
  -lived Tandy 6000 running Xenix and now a XT with Minix. I started all this
  when I had my Apple and I started out with a 300 baud Micromodem IIe and I
  hacked USGS and even cracked a game, 1987 Packman. Now I have a XT and I can
  do a little stuff but nothing big. I even make some money helping my dads
  friends and other small businesses with their systems and security and i'm
  saving to get a 486 so I can run 386BSD when a more stable release comes out.
  I don't make computers a big deal and I don't really want a 386 or 486 anyways
  but I like Unix so what the hell. I like all kinds of foods, Pizza, Hamburger
  (Not the tape from Mcdonalds) and Mexican and Italian food. I am Italian by
  the way but I can't speak much Italian. I nearly died when I was 6 or 7 but I
  can't really remember, I had some kind of disease. hah. Gone now. I love 
  parties and alot of my friends around here don't know how to turn on a 
  computer so I really don't use it much. I like lots'a music, lots'a Rock and 
  a little rap (not that jump jump pump up the bass shit). I can't stand Heavy 
  Metal cause it's worse than jump jump pump up the bass shit. I'm stable on 
  Acohol but this stuff makes me (no joke) bang my head. I've released a lot of 
  t-files. Well not a LOT but enough. I made various stuff like the complete BT 
  North America (Tymnet) list and a Sprintnet (Telenet) list and various other 
  networks and some PD stuff that is worth d/ling like a list of legitimate 
  1-800 support systems and a list (and how to use) the free Merit shit. Also
  I wrote some shitty UI newsletters (long dead, never really existed group).
  I also wrote (or got from Usenet) some VaS articles and more are coming...
  My girlfriend, Lisa, is  also 13 and she is real cool about everything. She 
  used to go out with me last year and then we broke up but now everythings
  back together. After I showed her how, she hacked two VMB's. She is also real 
  fun to be with when her mom and dad aren't fighting. They should have been 
  divorced years ago, her mom is a real fucking bitch. They fight about stupid 
  things like why her dad forgot the tomatoes or why he bought a lottery 
  ticket. Real fucking stupid. Anyways, I used to live in Marquette (in the 
  Upper Penunisula of Michigan) and it's real sweet there and when we move 
  back, I'm gonna open a big 'free speech' multiline BBS. I love the snow and 
  the woods, I like hiking (not really much camping though) and  there's a big 
  Bell building there. I started hacking and stuff after I moved here so I
  really didn't know it was useful. heh. L8r..

                               By: Sir Robin

  Now today we're going to talk about me. In order for me to do this, (And the
fact that it's 3:45 Am and I'm bored as hell) I'll discuss Me in third person.
  Me is quite young, a teenager who is the youngest in his high school
freshman class. Me is quite bored with all forms of life, and is thinking of
things to do. Me decides to Make Not-Me's lives hell, and think that's funny.
Me is quite strange, or so the Not-Me's say. Me is writing this thing because
Sutdmuffin (A Not-Me) told me to. Me has semi-long, dark-brown hair, and me
has strange eyes, that change with whatever color cloth me is wearing. 
  Me wrote V.a.s. Number 70, and Me think every Not-Me would like it. Me is
currently working on stuff, which may show up somewhere soon. Me lives in
Michigan. Me is tired of writing stuff for Not-Me's. Me is tired of writing
third person.
  Well, Kids, let's play count how many times the word "Me" was in this little
part of the file. I'm working on some other stuff, so keep watching.
