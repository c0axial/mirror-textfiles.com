======
        Before you go about trying to cook people, you should know the basic
steps to cleaning and preparing a human body for consumption. Unlike the
chicken, Human skin does not taste very good, So for most recipes you will
want to to remove this. One method is to place the body in a bathtub full of
ice cold water for about a week. This will loosen up the skin enough to
the point where you can peel it off like an orange, and it will keep the body
from rotting. Another method is to boil it off. Be careful doing this, I
would not reccomend it as the bodily organs may expand as the body fluids
boil and the corpse may explode.
        Bones are another problem. The spine can be particularly tricky to
remove if you want to get those tasty back mussles. The most effective way
to remove this nuissance is to cut off the head (This is one of the least
useful parts of the body - to be explained later), and pull the spine up
through the neck. You will have the problem of the ribs getting in the way,
So you may want to make a deep incision going from the top of the throat
down to the abdomen right in the middle of the front of the body, and a
horizontal cut at the abdomen where the other cut left off to avoid damage
to any other parts of the body. Save the lungs, heart, liver, spleen,
pancreas, etc... these will all be used.
        The useless parts of the body will be your feet, as they are mostly
tendons, bones, ligaments, and the like, so they won't be very tasty. Next
is the hands. They are a little bit meatier, good for apetizers (I do have
a recipe using the fingers and toes so you may want to save them!). The head
is basically useless, A human brain is not a tasty thing, trust me, I know.
Its kind of like eating rotten calliflour <SP?> that is all gray and dingy
and nasty smelling. Of course if it is a guy you probably wont want to eat
the dick after all the stuff that goes on around there, and the same with the
anal cavities, etc. Stomach, small & large intestines are NOT good eating.
If it is a female, the breasts are mostly fat anyways, so save the fat, it
makes for jucier meats when you saute them with it. I wouldnt reccomend trying
to eat the nipples either, I dont think they would taste very good.
        And I am not going to go into the methods of getting your human
subject. I will tell you that you want someone slightly overweight, not too
much, but with a little fat to keep the meats jucier and the skin easier to
remove.
        Anyhow enough of the technical stuff, On to the recipes. For this
stuff you will need a oven/stove. I wouldnt recommend using a microwave because
human flesh has the tendency to really get dried out when you put it in the
microwave.

Finger-Size Snacks.
===================
Ingredients:
10 fingers (or 8 fingers and 2 thumbs for smartasses)
10 toes
1  Cup flour
1  bowl of melted butter
1  Cup cornmeal

What to do:
First of all, you want to remove the fingernails and toenails (and thumbnails
for the smartasses again). Removing the bones is not neccessary, but a plus.
If the fingers were cut cleanly, the bones should just slide out. Mix the
cornmeal and the flour into one bowl (not the one with the butter in it). Now
dip the buttered fingers and toes into the cornmeal/flour mixture. Repeat
until all pieces are well coated. Now place the butter left over in a frying
pan, bring it to a sizzle, then proceed to fry them until they are golden
brown and crispy on the outside while soft and moist on the inside. Eat while
still hot. Serves 2. (1 hand & 1 foot for each of you!).

Chocolate Covered balls
=======================
Ingredients:
2 Testicles (if its a male)
2 Eyeballs
1 half pound of hersheys chocolate
4 toothpicks (or 2 if its a female)

What to do:
First, place the chocolate in a double boiler and melt it nice and soft and
goey. Then dip the balls into the chocolate (stick a toothpick in it to lower
it in and get it all covered). Now place these in the freezer to cool them
off, and boom, you have a ready-to-eat-snack anytime. Serves 1.

Entrail Salad
=============
Ingredients:
Any leftover parts from cleaning human

What to do:
The human body contains a plethora of useful body parts that we cant really
use for other recipes, yet it would be a shame to waste. For example, the
spleen, various fat tissues, Arteries & Veins, nerves, etc. Just mix these
up in a bowl, and then add some dressing (thousand island is good for this)
and you are set with a healthy nutritious 100% natural snack.

Bob Roast
=========
Ingredients:
1 Large thigh muscle
1 breast (if its female - else 1 ass cheek)
1 cup of miscelaneous body parts

What to do:
This is a good meal for a family of 3 or 4. You will remove the muscle on the
thigh of the person <pretend his name was Bob so we can call it Bob roast>,
and then the fat from the breast (or ass cheek) which you will melt in a
seperate pan and pour over it. Place the roast in a deep covered pan, in an
over at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes, until brown on the outside , sauteing
occasionally with the melted fat. After about 15-20 minutes, add the entrails
to the bottom of the pan, and re-cover. This will help keep the meat nice and
moist. Serve while hot. Feeds 4.

BBQ Spare Ribs & Watermelon Pie.
================================
HEY YOU NIGGER STOP READING THESE VaS FILES WE HATE YOU - GO BACK TO THE
JUNGLES OF AFRICA OR WHEREVER YOU CAME FROM.
If you arent a nigger than read on (there is no watermelon pie though).
Ingredients:
1 set of human ribs
1 jar of barbeque sauce

What to do:
This is an easy one to make, if you have a barbeque. It just wont work too
well in a oven or microwave. The main problem here is gettin 2 sets of ribs.
You will need a powerful saw, and saw the ribs off of each side, this can
get difficult, one of those electric meat cutting knives may help. Then coat
them with BBQ sauce before putting them on, Grill on each side for around
5-10 minutes, until nice and brownish-red, then turn over, adding more sauce
to the side as you turn it over to keep it juicy. Serve while hot. Feeds 2.

| Deserts |
+---------+

Boy after all that great food you are ready for some desert eh? Well here is
2 ideas for some good recipes for desert.

Hot Spleen Sundae.
=================
Ingredients:
1 Spleen
1 Pint Of Ice Cream

What To Do: The spleen holds excess blood that is really dirty and shitty, so
its tastes really good! Simply boil the spleen in some water until it starts
to turn a bright red, then quickly remove it <it will explode if you don't>,
and pour it over your ice cream. Voila! Instant delight for your kids and
relatives! Serves 2..

Pussy
=====
Ingredients:
1 Pussy
1 pint ice cream
1 bag cholcolate chips
1 cup sprinkes

What to do: You guys who tongue your girlfriend's clit think thats eating
pussy, you are sorely mistaken. What you need to do is to remove the actual
pussy from the corpse <if its a girl> with a sharp knife, and stuff it with
the ice cream, chocolate chips, sprinkles, etc. Then eat the whole thing like
a Pita bread.Yum Yum. Serves 1.
