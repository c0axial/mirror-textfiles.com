Re: Harrassment Case


                             September 26, 1994


      For nine months I have been receiving harassing calls on my telephone at
my home.  These calls have averaged from one to none to seven times a week.  
The total number of calls is approximately 70-100.  These calls have covered 
the spectrum as far as harassment.  This male caller sometimes alone and
sometimes with at least one other voice in the background has threatened my
life, threatened to kick my ass, has desired to collect drugs from me, has
ask me to come and play sporting events with him.  In a recent call he left a 
message explaining to me about my abortion and breast enlargement schedule.
My father heard this one before I did as he was doing some work at my house.
The harassment has been violent, deviant and personal in nature.  This 
caller/s have quite often sounded as if they were under the influence of 
alcohol or another narcotic.  This caller/s has has tended to call me between 
12 midnight and four in the morning and has at many times been under the 
influence of substances.  This caller has called me during all days of the 
week, but seemed to call me later at night during the summer months.  This
caller has threatened to come to my house to cause me physical harm.  This
caller has used disturbing and obscene language towards me throughout these 
70-100 calls.  I have asked the caller/s to cease and desist at least five
times.  I have numerous witnesses that can testify to the nature and 
consistency of these calls and the caller/s.  In a recent call which I do
have on tape, the caller explained how he met me at a fag bar and wants me to
take him home and fuck him.  He said he was going to come over tomorrow so
that he could fuck me and that I need to wear something fucking tight.
        During these nine months I have feared for my safety at night, I have
feared for my house mates safety, and I have feared for my dog's safety not 
knowing the extent and unstableness of this person's intentions or actions.
I have spent hours in conversation with the police, Ameritec and friends trying
to determine who this man was, and how I can press charges against them for 
harassment and more importantly how I can get this stopped.  I spent $85 for
a caller Identification machine to try and trace these calls.  I to this day
have paid $8.50 a month for this service from the telephone company.  I have
changed and unlisted my number for the price of $38.
        I have filed two police reports concerning my safety and those in my
house and to try to stop this harassment.  The case numbers are XX-XXXX and
XX-XXXX.  Today, September 20 at 3:30PM Detective Kowalec from the Ferndale
Police Department has informed me that the calls were coming from the residence
of Foulstaff and Foolbert Sturgeon.  These are the father's of two former
students of mine Foolbert Sturgeon and Foulstaff whom I taught in Eighth grade
at Brownell Middle School in Grosse Pointe, Michigan.  Due to the extreme 
content and duration of this harassment, I never conceived the fact that a
student would be the deranged individual.  This as not been an easy situation
for me.
