    I know you are thinking right now, "What the fuck is Absinthe?".  Absinthe
 is a form of liqour made from wormwood.  It is illegal in every country 
 except for Spain, Portugal and Denmark.  Here in the US, not much is known
 about it, so cops will probably think it is just plain alcohol.  However, 
 in Europe, this stuff is highly cracked down upon.  It was thought to cause 
 insanity and death in the 19th century and has since been banned.  You might 
 be thinking, "So why the fuck should i care about some nasty tasting liqour 
 when i can be drinking Absolute?".  The answer is that Absinthe produces 
 hallucinations and gives a better buzz than normal hard liqour. People have 
 compared it to an extremely long Nitrous trip with mild pysilocibin style 
 hallucinations. So you know see why this drug is so cool.  It gives a long 
 Nitrous buzz with trips.  But you might be asking now, "Why should i risk
 my life and sanity drinking this shit?". Do you think OE is any safer?
 However, since Absinthe has been banned so long that it has been almost 
 forgotten, you have a .000001% chance of finding a dealer that can get you 
 it.  So, the obvious thing to do is make it.  Lately, i have seen several 
 recipes floating around USENET for it. I will include them with comments 
 along with some of my own. 

** Absinthe #1 ** 

1 pint vodka                    2 tsp crumbled wormwood (dried)
2tsp anise seed                 1/2 tsp fennel seed
4 cardomom pods                 1 tsp majoram
1/2 tsp ground coriander        2 tsp chopped angelica root
1 2/3 cups sugar syrup

Place vodka in large jar with tight fitting lid.  Add wormwood and shake
well; steep 48 hrs and strain out.  Crush seeds and pods in mortar.  Add
them and all remaining spices to vodka and steep in a warm place 1 week.
Filter and sweeten.  (The sugar syrup mentioned above is your standard
simple syrup.)

** Absinthe #2 **

1 tsp crumbled wormwood         
1 cup vodka
2 Tbsp chopped peppermint leaves
1 piece of lemon peel, 3/4"x2"
1/3-1/2 cup sugar syrup

Steep wormwood in vodka for 48 hours.  Strain out and add peppermint
leaves and lemon peel. Steep for 8 days, strain and sweeten. Smells good
but is more bitter than #1.

(For Vodka, i recommend using Popov's or Mohawk 50%. The end product will 
 taste like shit anyway, so just buy the cheap stuff. Everclear would be 
 a better substitute if you can get it. Wormwood and the other spices can
 usually be bought at the supermarket or holistic medicine stores. The syrup
 is not to be added until you drink the absinthe. It may also be 
 substituted with sugar.)

** PiMp AbSiNThE **

1 cup Diluted Grain Alcohol(ethanol) 75% (3 parts alc., 1 part water)
1 tsp dried and crumbled wormwood

 Add the wormwood to the alcohol and shake it. Put it in a warm area, like 
 near a heat duct for 2-3 days. Now Strain the wormwood out of the alcohol.
 Now you may use whatever mixture of spices you want to flaver it.  The stuff
 for number 2 would be a good idea because those spices are easy to get and
 you know it will be more like absynthe then some random choice. As you get
 more experienced, experiment with other spices, more wormwood, adding a small
 amount of methanol, etc.. Leave the stuff in their for a week and then 
 strain or filter it out. 

    When your done making it, the vodka should have been turned a dark
 greenish color. If it isn't, it dosen't really matter. The 19th century
 distilleries often added chemicals to color it. It should at least have a
 greenish tint to it. Before you drink it, add the syrup or sugar. It should
 change color to a cloudy white. For the Pimp version, you should put some 
 water in a glass and hold a strainer filled with sugar over it. Now pour the
 absinthe through the strainer.  Drink up. If you can hook me up with some
 smuggled Spanish Absinthe, get in touch with me on one of the VaS sites or
 Email me at tpp1@free.org.

    Excessive use is supposed to cause psychosis, hallucinations and insanity.
 But they say the same thing about Psychedelics. I say Fuck Em'.
