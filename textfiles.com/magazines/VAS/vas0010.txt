excellent stage show, and their lyrics are sick and disgusting... Anyhow

dub those tapes <who buys em anymore?> you will know what the fuck they are

| HAM ON THE BONE |
+-----------------+

Can you hear the whispering wind?
Over the screams of your dying friends?
Did yuu know your life was mine?

You know what I got
HAM ON THE BONE
A Little thing
That I can't leave alone
Now i feel the purpose of my life defined
HAM ON THE BONE
is mine

Now you're on call
To the desperate scene
At the throbbing ball
And you'll do it all
Now you've become my geni-thrall

You know what I got

HAM ON! HAM ON! HAM ON! HAM ON!

Now my hand grasps
My throbbing root and shan't unclasp
Go to the head of the class
Madly stroke my flaccid shaft

+------------------+
| Crack In The Egg |
+------------------+

The egg was spawned in our mutation pits
In the bowels of your earth it was grown
Feeding on the blood of your loinspawn
And all the filthy load that was blown
Now the time is right for it's birth
And whatever it is shall stalk the Earth
What it looks like I care not
I just hope it kills a lot.

CRACK IN THE EGG!
CRACK IN THE EGG!
The time is right
Crack in my pipe

Parasitical scum, you die so easily
But you have always sickened me
Your will enslaved you grovel for more
Soon your bowels will litter the floor
Cannibalistic depravity
Bereft of all humanity
A fitting feast of abject insanity
A dark curtain before the last calamity

There is but one way to give the egg life
Murder the innocent soul
Their fluids project as their nipples are flayed
Their skulls are fashioned into bowls
You masses of humans are gagging in glee
Now you gape but you'll soon be here with me
If you're really lucky I'll vomit on thee
I'll shit in your stump
And then bathe you in pee

Sunder your form with my withering hacks
Mash up you face with my gauntled smacks
Now bring me dead babies - let there be no lack

SLAVE: I've got a bunch of them here in my sack

I've slaughtered your daughters and mangled your sons
If we kill enough of them Gor-Gor will come
The end of your race, we approach the hour

Gor-Gor will get a blood red baby shower
We'll bathe him in death to celebrate life
I'll be the doctor and Beef the mid-wife
But it takes so long, how can I cut slack

BEEFCAKE: Shoot the fucker up with some crack!

Gor-Gor see him now inside the egg
Please come out Gor-Gor of you I beg
Will he be a happy child, maybe?
More likely he'll be a crack baby
We infected his being with evil drugs
So he would grow up and be a thug
Destroying the planet, the world he will mug
The human race will die, and we'll just shrug

+-----------+
| GOR - GOR |
+-----------+

Gor-Gor comes
Sirens wail
Mournful drone of babblign flail
Thunderous gnashing firestorm
Flames illuminate his form
Gor-Gor comes and you must die
Swats F-16 from the sky
Admit you crave the gift he brings
Fall and worship tyrant king

Sow pestlential hate
It shall obliterate
The shadows of your long dead brothers
And all the mutilated others
Who died in waves, uniform
To appease your bloodied hulking form
Which broke thru layers of molten strata
To make the planet Earth errata

Gor-Gor Big!

Take the child in champing jaws
A pulping pile of frothign flaws
This horrid mass shall give us pause
As putrid rot fills gaping maws

Skulls are smashed and bones are bending
Joints are popping, claws are rending
Groveling sniveling driveling horde
To worship scaly overlord
Apocalypse becomes creation
Gor-Gor shall erase the nation
Before you leap into his gizzard
Fall and worship tyrant lizard
Gor-Gor comes and you must die
He swats the stealth down from the sky
Admit you crave the death he brings you
Fall and worship tyrant king you

Gor-Gor

| Have You Seen Me? |
+-------------------+

Mommies I've been stealing your babies
Gag the brat and then maybe
I'll suck out his brain

Dead kids
They make me feel almost hard
Go get one from the schoolyard
He bled like a stuck pig

HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

Suckle
My bloated love knuckle
Just like Fatty Arbuckle
I'm gay and i'm proud

Faggot
And a corpse full of maggots
I wanna blow cum not bag it
Goddammit I'm horny!

HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

It's just a dead child
An object i've defiled
Yes, I know it's wrong
You'd rather that it was your mom?

HAVE YOU SEEN ME?

Sated
Now that i've masturbated
I'm in love but I'm hated
I don't follow the crowd

You
You're covered in vile spew
My filthy chunk is all over you
My filthy, filthy, filthy chunks

| The Morality Squad |

We're the morality squad
Armed with the wrath of god
My name is Granbo
And here's my holy hot rod
Freedom for all the people
Brave and true and strong
Freedom for all the people
Unless I think they're wrong

Blashphemy!

Rapist mentality!
Teen suicide Necro-bestial anal butt sex!!

Oooooh!!!!

I got a couple of friends here
Trained by the C.I.A.
Special agents here to blow you the hell away
GWAR you're the worst, I'll put an end to you
You're even grosser than 2 Live Crew

My grandson the superhero just back from the war with Iraq

CORP. PUNISHMENT: My name is Corporal Punishment.
                  I want to scratch your back

GRANBO: MY nephew Tiny, a hundred tons of MAN!

| Gilded Lily |
+-------------+

Well I've been wearing a Gilded Lily
Cunningly carved in a manner frilly
To my design it was created
No deviation was tolerated
My Gilded Lily he think he funny
My Gilded Lily he worth cash money
My Gilded Lily he made me a smarty
I wore my Lily to all the right party go!

I was the envy of all the horde
I proclaimed myself overlord
My Gilded Lily gives all this and more
I puked my guts all over the floor

I found the entertainment banal,so,
Thru trenches of flesh we carved a canal
Lead harlequin then drew his last
He held a bejewled theatrical mask
The door heaved and then exploded
We split the bill and drove home loaded
When we got there the paint was peeling
We rose on Jell-o cubes to the ceiling

I wear the Lily
Gaily festooned in a manner silly
Draped in the apparel
I bathe in the smell

I gild the Lily
Adroitly crafted yet willy nilly
I wear the Lily
When I party with Milli Vanilli

And soon the pleasure barges
Rolled with the sun, pleasently bloated,
We mingled as one amidst debris of
Debauchery I looked for Lily and just found me

And all the while Gilded Lily faded
Though it was the best i'd created
But gilded lily was still in place
It made a mockery of my face
And delivered to us a suprise

The hulking mass of what we despised
Which lurched away as we moved to snuff it
Adn we delivered a princely buffet
Soon the continent split all asunder
And the radios blared to the blunder
My Gilded Lily expanded while spinning
That's when I realized we were winning
Fondly clutching our raging piss-ons
We piled up, peeled out, veered off, lashed out
And then we were gone.

| Poor Ole Tom |
+--------------+

He wakes on the outskirts of town
He sobs, his bowels release
His face is painted like a clown
His face contors in agony

POOR OLE TOM
POOR OLE TOM

You wake and wait
But you don't want to wait
You drag yourself from sleep
But look...Tom is coming
You kick him in the teeth

POOR OLE TOM
POOR OLE TOM

He is a buffonish harlequin
With a nasty habit of getting
The shit kicked out of him

POOR OLE TOM
POOR OLE TOM

The local Nazi bully boys
Must be rid of Tom
So the death camp will be immaculate
When they turn the ovens on

They smash his face in the shit
He writhed in his death throes

POOR OLE TOM

| Rock N Roll Never Felt So Good |
+--------------------------------+

I met her at a donkey show
She was minutes past 13
Sucking on a cherry Yoo Hoo
Reading "Nugget" magazine
Cum Spattered tube-top
Scrawny pre-pube tits
Then I saw she was a quadraplechick

And I said baby you're looking good
Thats when I noticed her legs were wood
I grabbed a stump and dragged her out of the door
I need a hole I don't need no hips
I laid a line of coke on her tits
That's when I ripped off her dirty shit filled drawers

Good, Should, Could, I think it feels pretty good

It wasn't nothin pretty
She took my genital germ
Her limbless body thrashed around
Filled with infected sperm
I criss-crossed with my cable
I smasher her face thru a door
They found her in a plastic bag
Down by highway 64

And I said baby yer lookin good
That's when I saw her legs were wood
And all you people
You just can't understand
I need a hole I dont need no hips
I need the taste of dick on my lips
I fucked her asshole
With a piece of Frozen Shit

Good, Should, Could, I think it feels real good
So good
Rock and roll never felt so Good

| The Road Behind |
+-----------------+

Well I'm traveling down the road
Carrying that heavy load
I'm in a drug induced stupor
Sleazy, I can't do the show
Hanging out backstage
I'm in a homicidal rage
Signed a million dollar contract
Puked on every page
Slaugtered 1/2 the crew
Cause they ate the deli tray
Oh baby hey
Said I'd do the show but I cancelled anyway
You were a road kill baby
Till I scraped you in my arms
Just another wattle flapping
On the old turkey farm

So baby...

And the wheels keep rolling
And another signpost gone
All along on the road behind
Oh can't you hear me calling
Just like the sad whale song
I'm on that road behind

Well there you have it baby
I'm just a sensitive guy
I snuffed a million planets
And still find time to cry
Because there is mroe to life
Then making other people die
Like a littl ebloody tear baby
Running out my dirty little eye
And some things baby
Just don't make no sense
Does it really matter baby
If I bug your parents?
You were a road kill baby
Till I scraped you in my arms
Just another wattle flapping
On the old turkey farm

Now baby quit yer crying
Put those clwon britches on

And the wheels keep rolling
And another signpost gone
All along on the road behind
Oh can't you hear me calling
Just like the sad whale song
A sad whale song...
Sad whale, baby

At home we're bored
Just got off another shitty tour
Moat filled with flaming us
Sleazy he won't talk to us
Fondle fish in way illegal
Coffin filled with dirty needles

BLIMEY! BLIMEY!
Waddaya do when you feel like that?
BLIMEY! BLIMEY!

Bio-mutant sexy made
Heave it down the balustrade
Give it fish, tell it to run
We indulge in naughty fun
Sexy's flanks are torn and rent
Slimey's on the rag again

BLIMEY! BLIMEY!
Waddaya do when you feel like that?
BLIMEY! BLIMEY!

That's right folks, here in the hal of
human hatred we've got some of your
most inspired brethen, genocidal maniacs
who carved their way thru the history
books straight into your hearts. We've got
Caligula, mad emporor of Rome whose
purges consumed thousands on his blazing
altar of syphillis. Or how about Giles
Lavalle, medieval crusader of God's will
whose search for the elixir of life led to
the ritual satanic killings of hundreds of
Parisian youth? Or Julius, religious despot
whose slaughter of the intelligensia of
Milan gave him the nickname of "The
Warrior Pope" That's right, some of the
greatest mass murderes in your sad, yet
vibrant history, are here inshrined,
impaled and pumped with agonizing life

Tummys tingle
Tongues-a-mingle
Forced extraction
Of corn-choked shingle
Bristling amoeba hole
MAtching cunt for every bowl
Madly flailing porno-cow
Get me on the road right now

BLIMEY!

Squandered seed and energy
