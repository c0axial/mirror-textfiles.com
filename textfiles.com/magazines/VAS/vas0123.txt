        " WATCHFULL EYE NEEDED FOR STUDENT WEB SITES
                     by Kelly L. Carter
        
                Sometimes I'm just at a loss for words.
                I shake my head, close my eyes and try to
          come up with something semi-intelligible to say
          when i read something I think is completely
          ignorant.
                I attempt to open my mouth, but nothing at all
          constructive or coherent comes out.
                I felt this same way early last week when a
          classmate in my English class brought me a
          sheaf of papers she downloaded off of the World
          Wide Web.
                The Web site that she located, which is put
          together by an MSU student, was completely
          disgusting. It linked to something called a
          "newsletter" that looked as if it was copied off
          of someone's e-mail, a freind who is a Web site
          guru told me(1).
                The newsletter, which is too disgusting to
          even mention the title, stated some pretty
          derogatory comments about Black people and
          women.
                It included things such as a malt liqour review
          -- which "flows from the faucets of every Black
          person in Detroit" -- the "review" said(2), and a
          rap written by a black man to a black woman
          which was completely derogatory.
                It also had a letter drafted to "the Black com-
          munity"(3) from Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan,
          who was made a staff member for the page through
          affirmative action, it fictitously stated(4).
                My classmate found the site after reading a
          letter by this particular student who wrote a let-
          ter to the editor printed in The State News. She
          was pretty taken aback, and facetiously said it
          was almost "poetic" the way some of it was
          written.
                During the past few years, with the ongoing
          talks of Internet censorship blah blah blah blah
          if you really want to read the rest go to
          www.statenews.com. blah blah blah October 20th 1997
          paper blah blah blah..."
                           The (MSU) State News, 10-20-97

(1). Web Site Guru?!?!?! Has the scene gotten that lame since we left last
    year? Copied off of someone's E-mail? WTF? The header does not show up
    correctly because most browsers don't support high-end ANSI. VaS has
    nothing to do with E-mail. This so-called Guru is a moron even among the
    lame.

(2). A misqoute, so typical of today's mainstream media. "Where the malt licka
    flows like water from the sinks of every project." is probably what she
    was refering to. This qoute was not from the "Malt Licka Review" issue as
    she states, but from "The Master Plan" issue. Another example of today's
    yellow journalism.

(3). Another misqoute. If you are going to qoute us, make sure it is something
    we actually wrote.

(4). Staff member for the page? "Due to affirmative action, I have gained a
    position on VAS's WRITING staff,". What does that have to do with the WWW
    page?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        When i reached the Reverend Foolbert J. Sturgeon, the author of the
 issues in question, he had this to say, "I am but a facetious young poet,
 spreading harmony throughout the world".
        I am honestly suprised that it took this long for someone to demand
 censorship of VaS. No Textfile group out there has come close to writing
 articles as sick and twisted as we have. However it is not going to happen,
 fuck you. We're gonna take the world, We will never die! All you have done is
 piss everyone in VaS off, and make us more determined.
        It is obvious that this h0 and her computer genius(hahahha) freind
 have never even been to the web page themselves. They have no idea what VaS
 is and do not even understand the concept of a "newsletter". Yet, despite
 their lack of knowledge and any intelligence whatsoever, they feel qualified
 to write an article about us. The State News is nothing more than a tabloid
 that would disapear over night if MSU cut their funding. I recieved a letter
 from the author of this article a while ago. She came off with this bitch
 attitude about how she was so much smarter than I am because she was a "well
 read, educated Junior" and i am but a "Naive Ignorant Sophomore". But what
 can you expect from someone who majors in journalism? Journalists are one of
 the most worthless types of people on the planet. They make their livings
 off of lies and deceit, brainwashing the mindless masses.
        The ironic thing is that we had been broken up for a year, with no
 interest in reforming, when this letter came out. However, after reading this
 letter, the inner circle was unanimous in it's decision to return to the
 scene. By writing this editorial, she is responcible for our return. I just
 have this to say to her
