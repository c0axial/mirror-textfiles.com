Below is the current list of popular hackers bulletin boards.  The list is 
entirely compiled by the users of the Hackernet BBS - so does not show ALL 
bbs which have hackers sigs, but it does show the ones that Hackernets users 
think are worth calling - after all would you waste 2 minutes of on-line time  
entering the details of a naff hackers bulletin board system?

If you have any additions to go onto this list then please call the Hackernet BB
and press '+' from the main menu to get the Hackers BBS menu.
