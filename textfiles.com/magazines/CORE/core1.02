                      Nobody Here But Us Chickens


       Last week, I think it was -- it might have been last year, or
tomorrow -- there was a fire in a chicken processing plant in North
Carolina, in a little town near where I, and my father, and his father,
and his, grew up. I heard the news on the radio for days, driving home from
an office where I'd sat feeling bored, wishing I were somewhere else.
       The facts are fuzzy in my mind already: I believe twenty-five people
died, fifty-some more were injured, in a work group of fewer than a hundred.
They fried chicken there, bite-sized nuggets to ship frozen to the fast-food
chains. A vat of grease caught fire fast: the most likely hazard. Exit doors
were locked (no breaks taken, no chickens stolen). Who knew where the fire
extinguishers were?
       A woman's voice on the radio said she was in the bathroom when it
happened. Women's bathrooms are great escapes. They (especially if they
are men) won't argue too much about your bladder's needs. She told the 
women in the bathroom with her not to leave; she told a big black man
outside to bust the nearby exit door.
       A researcher from a State think tank, a native judging by his accent,
was free to say (or dared) that manufacturing plants in North Carolina have a
chance of being inspected once every seventy-five years. North Carolina has a
law which says it doesn't have to do better than Federal Government standards,
slipping since Reagan.
       North Carolina has a superstition among the people which says that
Unions take your wages. This, perhaps, is the corollary of a custom among the
businessmen of paying by the minute, and not too much. The people have to eat;
some don't even grow cabbages and collards anymore, spending seed money on
gasoline to drive to the chicken plants, to earn the money which comes in
little yellow envelopes, sometimes a dime a raise, to feed the children
canned beans and white bread, to quench the thirst for alcohol, to get by, 
to forget, to get by.
       There's not much to do in Hamlet, N.C., except hold on to your
Daddy's land and eat and drink and screw. And work, because your Daddy 
worked, and his Daddy worked, and his. If your Daddy was a supervisor you
could be a supervisor.  If your Daddy was a farmhand you could work at the
chicken plant.
       My mother's maid told her she'd never work again at the poultry
packing plant in Monroe because her hands froze and she slipped on the 
guts on the floor. She simmered pinto beans all day on my mother's stove
while she cleaned the bathrooms and got pregnant while she waited for her
husband to get out of prison. They taught her maths in school but not
budgets and they taught her English grammar but not communication.
       My father told me not to play with their children and that it's
who you know every bit as much as what you know and you're known by the
company you keep. He told me to never clean my plate at a restaurant.
He taught me to play gin rummy but not how to gamble. He got me a summer
job at the textile plant as a payroll clerk when I was sixteen, without
an interview.
      The reporter on the radio told me that even on the second day after the
fire there was a strong odor around the chicken plant but she didn't tell me
what it was. She told me that two people die every week in North Carolina in
work-related accidents and that twenty-two percent of chicken industry workers
are injured on the job.
	I wasn't surprised.

                     THE ORIGIN OF MACHINE READABLE DATA


                                  The lights of the computer
                                  blink all night -- a city
                                  across water or traffic
                                  miles away.  What it plans 
                                  for itself, no one knows,
                                  but in the blue glow of a dream
                                  a man opens a grave
                                  and finds his body gone to pearl,
                                  weightless at last.

               He forgets everything by morning.
               Hair swept over blank eyes,
               the emptiness in his hands,
               become a tremor on his cheek
               and what the dream meant, if it must,
               a leap of fire beneath the eyes.
               At work, he mounts the first tape.
               It runs by like a rich, brown river
               and before it stops, he comes out
               of the underbrush, carrying bone,
               the thigh of that first animal.
               What he sees on the river 
               is all he can bear, and beyond it,
               the lights he begins to name.

                   No one can say what becomes of him.
                   In a forest that green, anything happens
                   and later, over coffee, he tells his friend
                   what he knows, his plans for himself,
                   how the lights across the water,
                   white as bone, came to him
                   darkened into syllables he could understand,
                   then darker into the machine
                   that sleeps beneath his hand.

                                 CRACKED


Outside the two-stall garage,
its walls covered with a brick facade,
I stood barefoot, the asphalt cool,
holding my favorite cup filled with coffee.
He was squatting by the machine,
tinkering with its innards.  The job complete,
he turned the engine on, revved it to a roar,
never noticing me walk through the door.

As I tired to talk to him, my husband,
my words were obscured by the motorcycle's din.
Raising my voice to a higher pitch,
the crescendo of noises rose,
and reachined a climax in a splintering crash
as I smashed the ceramic cup on cement.
There it lay, in fragments on the floor;
a scrap left over from the night before.

                         WHAT IS A BOOK?


   Psychology, like all wannabe sciences, aspires to prediction.  And
prediction is usually based, in science, on models, which in turn are based
on assumptions, which are of 2 basic types: processes and objects.  In the
world of the mind, examples of objects are goals, or desired states of
affairs.  An example of a process is a drive.  Thus, to maintain bodily 
functioning, there is the hunger drive.  For preservation of the species,
there is the sexual drive (not to be confused with a subclass of dating). 
There are others, but technology has now created a new drive - the drive
to computerize (some claim that this is merely the old "drive to annoy" in
a new guise).
    Nietzsche said, "When all you have to work with is a hammer, all prob-
lems start to look like nails."  Since we all have computers now and are 
looking for ways to justify the cost, the world reduces to data.  The
latest target for this behavior is - books.
    These same psychologist note that some mistake the drive itself for its
object, where the fulfillment of the drive, independent of its object, is
pursued in and of itself.  Some call this an obsession, others call it art.
For example, addiction to food is called gluttony (or an eating disorder),
whereas, given the proper descriptive vocabulary, and sufficient documenta-
tion of the process in satisfying the craving, one is then called a gourmet.
Thus, the urge to compute, which has as it's legitimate object that which
will be made more efficient, easy, etc. by computerization, becomes redir-
ected to the process of computing itself as the object, independent as to
whether the final product is useful or not.
    As documentation (books) went on-line, it seemed a natural step, given 
the drive to compute, to extend the treatment to all books.  Thus, there
are now schemes hatching aplenty to allow the utility companies and battery
makers to extract tribute from us whilst blissfully in the throes of
literary escape.  Interestingly, these books-on-a-(chip/disk/cassete
/whatever), are to be "played" on a device, usually called, ominously,
a "reader."
    What are we to make of this?
   
    Reading is much more than just an intellectual experience.  It has its
own gestalt, one that differs according to the type of reading that you're
doing.
    For example, if I'm reading something solely because I want to, generally
for pleasure, I like to curl up on the couch with something to drink 
(preferably hot tea), and comfortably dive right in.  The heft of the book,
the size, the type of paper used, whether I have to peer into the "gutter" 
to try to guess what characters are out of sight (because the pages are bound
with insuffient binding margins), whether the cover is plastic-coated with
sharp corners, etc. etc. etc. - all these things and others can enhance or
detract from the session.
    Reading a book on a computer means reading the text electronically - on
screen.  One problem with VTD screens, even with small, light portables, is 
that you are reading transmitted, rather than reflected, light.  Light
reflected off a page, especially one with a non-glaring-white page, is easy 
on the eyes.  Less contrast, less light enters the eye, so eye-strain is
minimized.  VDT screens, on the other hand, are all transmitters, so the
page IS THE LIGHT SOURCE ITSELF.  Reflected light is diffused, due to the
fibers in the paper; it is absorbed by the books very substance, resulting,
in the very best cases, in a kind of soft warm glow.
     There are some books having the purpose of maximizing the correct  
reproduction of photographs and graphic images; "coffee table" books and 
those devoted to works of art and photography are examples.  Though these 
can be wonderfully exciting to view, they are usually printed on highly
reflective clay-coated stock, which offers the same sort of glaring
glossiness that you'll see on photographs themselves.  These books will 
cause eye-strain if looked at too long, but, because of size, they're
usually not the 'curl uppable' kind anyway.  (This problem can be resolved
with different paper stocks that have a less reflective surface for the 
page and text, but the graphic image itself is glossy.  A nice compromise
that works fairly well.)
   Another difference from books is that light from a computer screen is con-
stantly being refreshed at a rate far slower than that from your average read-
ing lamp.  Like a television, a VDT screen is being refreshed at a certain
rate.  I'm not sure of the frame-rate on a VDT.  Since VDT screens are 
composed of discrete phosphors, this means that you're really looking at
a constantly changing, mini-electronic billboard.  In other words, with all 
those pixels going on and off, your reading material is strobing.
   Not something you want to do for too long.

     There is a novel called "Cyberbooks", by Ben Bova, which describes
such a device, a sort of computer/reader that is to be marketed as a
replacement for books.  Instead of buying a 'physical' book, you either 
buy a chip holding (or you can download to), text, that the device then
displays.  An interesting book, worth the quick read that it is.  The novel
itself points out another problem with computer "books."
     In the last several years, paperback book covers have sported playful
devices on the covers as artistic, or other, embellishments.  Most of them
are on the level of things you would find in children's books.  For example,
there might be a cut-out in the first page of a two-page front cover, which
reveals something fairly innocent looking.  When you turn to the second page
of the cover, what you saw, in it's proper context, is horrific, funny,
nasty, etc.
     'Cyberbooks' has, as an example, the shapes of the 3 main characters
embossed into the cover.  The villainess of the book has an especially 
interesting, um, bas-relief.
     Granted, this is just a ploy to get you to buy the book.   With the
cyberreader, books would have to be chosen on the basis of content.  And 
what book publisher would want to take that chance?

Synopsis: In our first installment we met Gelfen, a NYC Welfare
caseworker and stud manque, hardly working in a Bronx welfare center
during the late 60's.


                           CIVIL SERVICE

                              Part II
                              (of VI)



            The new case hit Gelfen's desk at 4:30 one afternoon, a
       thin manila folder with a number stamped across the tab and
       a category (thank God) already assigned: _thank God_ because
       it was Home Relief, and that meant no school-age kids to
       worry over, no absentee father-hunts, no half-an-ear
       listening to the kvetching of a Puerto Rican mama. A simple
       one that probably would be closed in two months, if that
       long. But a new case, called a ``Pending,'' not be faked or
       phonied: Gelfen would have to get out and visit his new
       client.

            Reading through the preliminary forms, Gelfen saw that
       the Intake worker, a lifer named Stampler, had done his
       usual shitty job. The client, Eusebio Colon, had been
       allowed to get through to a regular casework unit without
       producing a birth certificate or any other proof of his
       existence. All the record gave were a few gauzy details.
       Colon lived in an apartment on Charlotte Street with his
       19-year-old sister Nilsa, who worked as a secretary in a
       sheet-metal supply house. He had been released two weeks
       before from Attica, where he'd done two years of a four year
       sentence for trying to sell some heroin to an off-duty cop
       in a poolroom on 172nd Street. And now Nilsa was telling her
       ex-con older brother to either get some _dinero_ into the
       house or his ass into the street. At 9:30 the next day,
       Gelfen signed out for the morning and took the bus one mile
       up Boston Road to see what he could see.

            Even after eighteen months with one caseload, Charlotte
       Street still made Gelfen feel like he'd dropped some bad
       acid. His parents, he knew, had lived there when they were
       first married, but ran for their lives within a year because
       the block was already in sight of the bottom. When he made
       his first trip to Charlotte Street, Gelfen, despite six
       months of Bed-Stuy under his belt, took one look at what
       he'd been dealt and half-considered resigning on the spot.
       Even the cops, he was told, shat in their pants as they
       cruised the street in squad cars at forty miles an hour. The
       monthly (maybe) visit of the garbage truck was the occasion
       for mass jubilation on this three-block-long cloaca, and
       kids who had never seen the inside of a school joyfully
       rained down bricks and beer bottles on the truckmen who
       dodged and loaded with balletic movements. The buldings
       themselves were gargoyle-encrusted brick-and-plaster
       firetraps built around 1900, with long dark entrance halls
       and unlit narrow stairs that smelled of a deeply embedded
       combination of cooking, excremental, and sexual aromas.
       Gelfen was a kind of fixture on the block, a money-bearing
       emissary from a cockroachless world, but nevertheless he
       rubbernecked the rooftops for his own physical well-being.
       Finding the building he wanted, he climbed three flights and
       knocked at a door that bore a sign proclaiming _Somos
       Catolicos! No propaganda de los otros religiones aqui!_
       because Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses
       worked these blocks with the offensive regularity of
       streetwalkers. No answer: Latin music blared from the
       apartment and dogs barked in time on other floors, so Gelfen
       pounded on the door this time, and a male voice shouted back
       ``Who?''

            ``Welfare,'' Gelfen yelled back, figuring nobody had
       too many secrets in this place.

            ``_Momento_,'' came the reply, and for a moment Gelfen
       pictured the guy finally managing to hit a still-usable
       vein. But the music stopped, and a few seconds later the
       door was flung open to the accompaniment of a rattling of
       chains and police locks. Before Gelfen stood a thin but
       powerful-looking Puerto Rican man with cropped black hair,
       wearing pants and sandals, but no shirt. Gelfen did a quick
       once-over of the guy's arms: no tracks, no chippie, no
       nothing. ``_Me llamo_,'' he said in his updated high school
       Spanish, ``_es Mister Gelfen del Departamiento de Welfare.
       Estan usted Senor Eusebio Colon?_''

            ``Tha's me, man, I'm Eusebio,'' he replied in accented
       but fluent English. My lucky day, Gelfen thought, as they
       went into the living room. ``Be right back,'' Colon said,
       and left Gelfen alone in the living room as he went into the
       kitchen.

            Gelfen checked out the furniture and restrained a
       laugh. It was the Puerto Rican parody of Pelham Parkway
       Jewish, a garish travesty of middle-class city life bought
       from _mueblerias_ (``_Su Credito Es Bueno Aqui_'') on
       Southern Boulevard, complete with imitation French
       Provincial tables, chairs, sofas, and an Olympic combination
       TV and stereo. All the seats were covered in thick see-
       through vinyl that looked like it could deflect low-calibre
       bullets. This, Gelfen thought, could have been his parents'
       place except for the pictures of Jack Kennedy and Jesus
       Christ displayed before a burning votive candle.

            Gelfen heard the top snapping off a beer can, and a
       moment later Colon reappeared, brew in hand, wearing a tee-
       shirt. He sat across from Gelfen, took a long swig, and said
       sarcastically, ``Okay, man, I'm 26 years ol', I been in the
       Joint, I don't got no fuckin' Jones, and I got a 7-inch
       dick. What else you wanna know, Mr. Welfare? I know the
       routine, right?''

            In spite of himself, Gelfen cracked up. Time for the
       apologetics, he thought. ``Look, Mr. Colon, I know this is a
       pain in the ass, but they pay me to find out this kind of
       stuff, and if I can't say I saw it, then no money.''

            ``Bullshit,'' Colon responded without anger, like he
       was simply stating a fact, which Gelfen realized he was.

            Gelfen rolled out a conspirator's grin guaranteed to
       break down Eusebio Colon's resistance. ``Hey, if you ever
       need anything sort of . . . well, _special_, from us, I'd
       have to know the real story up front so I could sort of work
       around it.''

            Right on cue, Colon laughed briefly. He smiled at
       Gelfen in a way the caseworker found mysteriously
       disconcerting. ``I get it, man,'' he said. ``I scratch yo'
       back, you scratch my balls.'' He got up and went back into
       the kitchen. When he returned, he had two more cans: he
       tossed one to Gelfen, sat back, and proceeded to tell his
       new caseworker the story of his life.

            He was, as he said, 26 years old, born in Puerto Rico
       in 1942, and he was hauled off to New York when he was
       seven, right after Nilsa was born. The family gypsied around
       from Brooklyn to Manhattan and finally to the Bronx, staying
       off relief because old man Colon was a reasonably skilled
       electrician who scrounged non-union jobs in the city and
       North Jersey, working for under scale, but working, anyway.
       Five kids later, Federico Colon hit midlife crisis and
       decided his first 44 years had been a serious mistake, so he
       took up with a 17-year-old girl and beat it back with her to
       Puerto Rico and oblivion. A few months later, Jose, the
       second child, who had acquired a heroin habit as part of his
       education at Morris High School, caught an OD and died; and
       the mother, Elvira, conned the price of bus tickets, grabbed
       the five youngest kids, and went to live off her sister and
       brother-in-law in Cleveland. Which left Eusebio and his
       sister Nilsa to rattle around seven rooms of gloom: until
       Eusebio, out to make his own way in the world, discovered as
       the cuffs were slapped onto his wrists that he'd seriously
       misjudged the buyer for some heroin he was trying to sell,
       and that his last customer was to be Detective Henry Ramirez
       of the 48th, who lived around the corner and was just there
       to shoot a little nine-ball.  Eusebio drew a four year
       sentence, served two, and was released for good behavior.
       Nilsa, in the meantime, being the brains of the family,
       finished the commercial course at Morris, got a decent job,
       and began living with her high school _novio_, a part-time
       piano player and full-time stud named Javier Melendez, who,
       according to what Nilsa wrote Eusebio in the Joint, laid
       anything with the right plumbing, brought strange women to
       the house while Nilsa was at work, and harbored a burning
       life's ambition to become a pimp. A few weeks before
       Eusebio's release, Nilsa kicked Javier out; but he
       persisted, Eusebio said, in coming around to lay Nilsa, who
       made a great show of unwillingness but who nevertheless woke
       up the neighbors with the noises she made half the night
       while Javier was with her.

            ``Are they,'' asked the middle-class Gelfen, ``making
       any noises about getting married?''

            Eusebio laughed. ``Shit no, man, you don' know Javier.
       He is a real _cabron_, that one. Hey, I think he even wan's
       my sister to _work_ for him. He says she gives the world's
       greatest head, but she tells me she's through with him,
       done, goo'-bye. I don' think Javier believes her!''

            Gelfen reminded Eusebio about the birth certificate,
       and the client began hunting around in the drawers, but
       could not turn it. ``Aah, shit,'' he said. ``Nilsa, she
       knows where all this stuff's at. When I was Upstate, she
       took this dump down and put it back together, an' di'n't
       tell me shit about how. Look, man, she'll dig it out, and
       I'll get it to you, okay?''

            Gelfen did not like the idea of the case hanging fire
       while Eusebio or Nilsa or somebody got mobilized to find the
       birth certificate. Also, Gelfen felt that Colon had
       manipulated the conversation so the ugly topic of _work_ had
       never come up. What the hell? he thought. The guy's been on
       the street for two weeks, let him at least come up for air.
       Technically, he could have let himself off the hook by
       refusing the case based on lack of documentation. That would
       have meant a tight thirty days of waiting: if Colon did not
       reapply under the thirty-day wire, someone else would get
       the headaches. But Gelfen gave Eusebio his work number and
       told him to call.
