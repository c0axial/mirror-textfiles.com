        Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho!
        It's off to tests we go!
        But now, to relieve
        the Finals Week Blues,
        Here's a new issue
        ...uh...
        FOR ALL OF YOUSE! :)
 
        Why's this in rhyme? I haven't the time, to figure out questions like
that! Etc. etc. etc.....
        Hi all!
        Well, here it is, the final issue of M00se Droppings for this month,
semester, year, and DECADE! (Feeling old? Fnord.)
        Happy Holidays to everyone! I'll "see" you all next decade! (Of course,
THEY are watching you all the time! Fnord.)

From Jonathan Clemens <FSJPC@ALASKA.BITNET>
 
Fellow M00ses:
        I have a favor to ask. While working on the computer system here in
Alaska, I have been constantly pestered by a relatively bothersome user. I keep
getting volumes of mail from her saying such things as "Hi Jon!" or "How are you
today?" and nothing else. It has gotten MORE than annoying.
        I wish to call upon my fellow m00ses for a boon. I think the time has
come to subject this user to summary "Torture by M00se Mailing." She doesn't
have Bitnet access, so she won't be able to respond to the flood of mail we can
send her. I would like all m00ses who read this to send at least one (1) mail
message to FSEJR@ALASKA.BITNET saying somthing stupid like "Hi Erica!" or "Merry
Christmas, Erica!", or "Is is cold up there in Alaska?"
        Imagine a mail junkie getting dozens of sensless mail messages, and
being unable to reply to any of them. Can you think of a worse torture? (if so,
send it to FSJPC@ALASKA)
        Thank you all! I really appreciate this! :)

My Darling,
 
     I went to the door today and the postman delivered a "Partridge in a pear
tree".  What a thoroughly delightful gift.  I couldn't have been more surprised.
You're an angel.

Darling,
 
     Today, the postman brought your very sweet gift.  Just imagine "Two turtle
doves".  I'm delighted at your very thoughtful gift.  They are adorable and I
love you for them.

Dear Fred,
 
     Oh!  Aren't you the extravagant one?  Now I really must protest.  I don't
deserve such generosity as "Three French hens".  They are just darling but I
must insist, you've been too kind.
 
                                             Love,

Dear Fred,
 
     Today the postman delivered "Four calling birds".  Now really, they are
beautiful but don't you think enough is enough?  You're being too romantic.

Dearest Fred,
 
     What a surprise!  The postman just delivered the "Five golden rings"; one
for every finger.  You're just impossible, but I love it.  Frankly, all those
birds squawking were beginning to get on my nerves.
 
                                             All my love,

Dear Fred,
 
     I couldn't believe my eyes this morning as I walked out onto the front
porch and there were "Six geese a laying" on my front steps.  So you're back
to the birds again - huh?  Those geese are huge.  Where will I ever keep them?
The neighbors are complaining and I can't sleep through the racket.  I love
your thoughtfulness, but -
                            Please Stop!
 
                                             Cordially,

Fred,
 
     What's with you and those fucking birds???  Today I received "Seven swans
a swimming".  What kind of a goddamn joke is this?  These birds shit all over
the house and they never stop with that awful goddamn racket.  I can't sleep
at night and I'm a nervous wreck.
 
     Stop your laughing damn you!  It's not funny.  Just knock it off with
those fucking birds, OK?????
 
                                             Sincerely,

OK Buster,
 
     I think I prefer the birds.  What the hell am I going to do with "Eight
maids a milking"??  It's not enough with all those birds and the 8 maids
milking, but they had to bring their goddamn cows!  There is shit all over the
lawn and I can't even move in my own house.  Just lay off me, smartass!!

Hey Shithead,
 
     What are you???  Some kind of sadist???  Now I've got "Nine pipers
playing" and Christ do they play!  They haven't stopped chasing those maids
since they've arrived this morning.  The cows are getting upset and they're
stepping all over the screeching fucking birds.  What the hell am I going to
do??  The neighbors have already started a petition to have me evicted.
 
                                             You'll get yours, bastard,

You Rotten Prick,
 
     Who in hell needs "Ten ladies dancing"??  I can't imagine why I call these
sluts "ladies".  They've been balling the pipers all night long.  Now the cows
can't sleep and all the goddamn racket around here has given them diarrhea.
My living room is a river of shit!  The Commisioner of Bldgs. has subpoenaed
me to give cause why the building should not be condemned!

Listen Fuckhead,
 
     What's with the "Eleven lords a leaping" on those maids and ladies???  Some
of these poor broads will never walk again.  The pipers ravaged the maids,
gang-banged the ladies, and now are committing sodomy on the cows.  All 23
birds are dead.  They were trampled to death in the orgy.  I hope you're
satisfied, you rotten vicious bastard!

Dear Sir:
 
     This is to acknowledge your latest gift "Twelve fiddlers fiddling" which
you have seen fit to inflict on our client, Miss Agnes McHolstein.  As you
no doubt have guessed, the destruction of her property was total.  You are
advised that all future correspondence with our client should be cleared
through this office.
 
     I feel compelled to warn you that if you should attempt to reach Miss
McHolstein at Happy Dale Sanitarium, the attendants of that institution have
instructions to shoot you on sight.  With this letter please find attached a
warrant for your arrest.
 
                                            Season's Greetings,

     HAVE YOU EVERRRRR NOTICED:
     (for a bit o' holiday cheer)
 
SANTA CLAUS?
 
     Yes, Santa is a long-standing tradition in our typically bland American
society, and stands as a watchdog of current morality.  But think for a moment.
What IS this Santa Claus?
 
      1)  A pagan tradition.  Even St. Nickolas (or however you spell his name)
is a pagan tradition adopted by the Catholic Church upon contact with the
germanic tribes of the north.  He's a PAGAN.
 
      2)  He is a capitalist moneymonger.  What better way to brainwash small
children into blind faith in a capitalistic society than to reward "proper"
social behavior with gifts that ultimately do little except feed the capitalist
imperialist society more and more--and love of money distracts men from the
true meaning of Christmas.
 
      3)  He is a voyeur.  "He knows when you are sleeping/He knows when you're
awake".  Need I say more?
 
      4)  He wears a red suit.
 
      5)  Have you ever examined the letters that comprise his name?  S. A. N.
T. A..  Rearranged, they give us his true identity:
 
                       SATAN!!!!!!!!
 
Think about it--red suit?  pagan?  voyeuristic?  capitalistic?  claus?  It can
all mean only one thing.  Santa Claus is the devil himself.  Watch and beware

'Twas the night before Xmas
        the lab was quite still
Not a bunsen was burning
        (Nor had they the will).
The test tubes were placed
        in their racks with great care
In hopes Father Chemistry
        soon would be there.
The students were sleeping
        so sound in their dorms
all dreaming of fluids
        and crystalline forms.
Lab-aides in their aprons
        and I in my smock
Were sitting, recov'ring
        from semester-end shock.
When outside the lab
        there arose such a roar
I leaped from my stool
        and fell flat on the floor.
Out to the fire escape
        all of us flew
What was the commotion?
        None of us knew.
The flood lights shone out
        o'er the campus so bright
It looked like old Stockholm
        on Nobel Prize night.
My fume blinded eyes
        then viewed (dare I say?)
Eight anions pulling
        a water-trough sleigh.
And holding the bonds
        tied to each one of them
Was a figure I knew
        as our own Papa Chem.
With speeds in excess
        of most X-rays they came
As they Dopplered along,
        he called each one by name.
"Now, Nitrite, now Phosphate,
        now Borate, now Chloride,
On Citrate, on Bromate,
        on Sulfite and Oxide.
Forget what you know
        of that randomness stuff,
Let's go straight to the roof,
        if you've quanta enough."
As fluids Bernoullian
        behave in a pinch
Those ions said, "Alchemist,
        this is a cinch!"
So up to the lab-roof
        those "chargers" they sped
With Pop Chemistry safe
        in his water-trough sled.
Just a micro-sec later
        Electroscopes showed
Charged particles coming
        to our lab abode.
We raced back inside
        And what do you think?
Down the fume-hood Pop Chem fell,
        right into the sink.
He was dressed in a lab coat,
        quite ragged and old
With removable buttons
        (the style, we're told!)
A tray full of beakers
        he clutched to his heart
And under his arm,
        was an orbital chart.
His eyes, through his goggles,
        I just couldn't see,
His hands were all yellow
        from H-N-O-3.
His head was quite bald
        with a fringe all around
Like a ring test for iron,
        the same shade of brown.
He puffed a cigar
        with a smell not at all
Unlike the organic lab
        right down the hall.
The smoke billowed forth
        from his angular face
And with Brownian movement,
        enveloped the place.
He was thin as a match
        and not terribly tall
He wasn't the type
        I'd expect at all.
But a look at his clothes,
        in the lab's harsh white light,
With their acid burned holes-
        He's a chemist all right!
He didn't say much
        (he had no time to kill)
And filled all the test tubes
        with nary a spill.
Then placed them back
        on the benches with care
He dashed to the fume hood
        and rose through the air.
He called to his team
        and his ions took off
And kinetics took care
        of Pop Chem in his trough.
But I heard him cry out
        as he flew down the street
"Merry Christmas to all,
        may your stockrooms stay neat!"
 
Compliments of my old Chem prof!!

                     Poems Written for Chemistry 103
                            by: The Mad Poet
*************************************************************************
 
          Chem. 103
 
I think that I will never be
Awake for morning Chemistry.
The monotonal lecturing
Could put to sleep most anything.
 
While lofty theorems fall like rain,
My concentration starts to wane.
As I drift off, I wonder why
A lecture beats a lullaby.
 
 
 
 
      Ode to a Chem. Prof.
 
A prof. who makes frequent mistakes
Likes to think that he has what it takes.
So he's made up a ruse
To cover his goofs -
He's just keeping his classes awake!
 
 
 
 
       Classroom Chills
 
Through classes near and classes far,
Through classes new and old,
I wish that Building Maint'nance
Wouldn't keep the rooms so cold!
 
For even though I know the cold
Should keep us all awake,
Quite groggily I find that
I've begun to hibernate.
 
And as I watch my breath condense -
In steaming clouds it blows -
I realize I have icicles
A-forming on my nose.
 
The danger is that, though
My being here *might* help me pass,
*Survival* may be tough
With hypothermia in class!
 
 
 
 
    Full-Professorship
 
The Doctor had a lecture class,
But he was such a dud
That every time he lectured there,
His words were clear as mud.
 
He didn't give a syllabus
To his befuddled class,
And actually he didn't care
If anybody passed.
 
If everybody failed -
Why it was in all of the rules -
He'd just go on next year
To fail another bunch of fools.
 
What rule could let him do this?
If you said, "It's age!" well then you're
Getting close because
What our dear Doctor has is *tenure*!
 
 
 
 
                 The Party
 
Please, oh my friends, please don't veto my plan.
Please don't just tell me to stow it.
I really don't think the professor would mind.
In fact, shucks, he just wouldn't know it.
 
I know you all want to be learning in class
About vectors and gas density,
But what would it hurt if you took the day off
And started a party with me?
 
We would smuggle refreshments inside our bookbags.
We'd have walkmans for music galore.
We would spread ourselves out there behind the back rows,
And party there on the floor!
 
We'd have chips and wine coolers and pretzels and beer,
Soda and pizza and wings.
We would listen to music and play five card stud -
Why, we could do most anything.
 
The professor's so out of it, he'd just teach class
To the few die hard students remaining.
I really don't think that he'd notice at all
That his classroom attendance was waning.
 
So please, oh my friends, please don't veto my plan:
You know how much fun it would be
To spread yourselves out there behind the back rows
And come have a party with me.
 
 
 
 
A Health Hazard
 
For those poor infirm members of our happy little class,
For those who carry books of more than half their body mass,
For those who, weak of heart and lung, do dwell upon these lines,
I have a word of warning you might ponder in your minds.
 
The Surgeon General has said that smoking isn't good,
And all of you have heard him, and yes, most have understood.
But yet another danger lurks!  You should be made aware
Of the hazard that exists in climbing much too many stairs.
 
As you climb up, your pulse and breathing rates leap up so high,
That you can feel a heart attack is lurking just nearby.
Since you abuse your muscles, both your legs begin to cramp;
Because you sweat profusely, soon your clothing is quite damp.
 
The stairs outside the lecture hall: a good example, true,
And climbing all six flights of stairs cannot be good for you.
So all health-conscious students - never mind trying to pass!
You shouldn't risk a heart attack - unite and boycott class!

The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:
 
> Why did I just shit in my pants?  Did anyone else do it too?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} Yes, most people in your area also did -- a low-frequency sound wave
} caused sympathetic vibrations that made many people lose control of
} their anal sphincters.  Don't be ashamed!
        [ed. note - Hmm! It appears THEY are developing NEW ways to control us!
I could envision lots of possibilities for crowd control fnord here! ;^)  -Pat]

> Every night while she sleeps, my girlfriend slowly changes into a
> shapeless blob of pulsating flesh, still wrapped in her own skin.  By
> morning she is herself again, and apparently none the wiser.  Should I
> tell her about this?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} Nah.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
> I hope the Oracle has the answer to this most difficult question:  Why
> does my 25 year old son keep seeing a girl that he has broken up with
> and only gives him grief?  A puzzled mother wants to know!
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} Hold it, the Oracle needs to switch modes for this one.  What was the
} magic word for the German Psychaiatrist again?  Oh yes:  Goot Zex!  Goot
} Zex!  Goot Zex!  Goot..
}
} [blur blur blur]
}
} Ja!  Dat ees much better!  Vell, ve schall see joost vat ees vrong vit
} your son, Frau Vorryvart.
}
} He ees 25 years old, eh?  I vould say dat he is doing just vhat he damn
} vell pleases, den!  Actually, he ees seeing zis girl solely for der
} poorpose of making you und nutzkopf.  You should haff never given him
} such a vhipping over that broken bowl vhen he vas drei years old.
}
} Actually, eef you vould just meet zis girl vitout your son around, you
} vould see she ain't so bat after all, eh?
}
} So, quit meddling vit his bizness, unt get on vit your more pressing
} matters, like vhen ees he going to produce some grandtchildren ver you
} und Herr Vorryvart.
}
} Now, how vas dat I get back to zee normal Oracle?  Oh ja, Veert Answers!
} Veert Answers!  Veert Answers!  Veert...
}
} [blur blur blur]
}
} You owe the Oracle a better German accent.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
> What would be a good question to ask you?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} To start off, that WAS a good question.
}
} Other good questions include...
} Why is the soap dish always in line with the water in the shower?
} What is the correct response to "Thanks for calling!"
} What is the correct response to "What's up?"
} Do we have the right to an attorney being present on Judgment Day?
} Why did Ronald Reagan have to wait until AFTER he left office to
}      have his brain fixed?
} Why do health food fanatics not look so healthy?
} Was Manuel Noriega any fun when he was a kid?
} If diamonds tasted like chocolate, would people actually eat them?
} Why don't acoustic guitars have wa-wa sticks?
} Whatever happened to the manned Mars mission Bush promised us?
} Why do smokers think they have the right to litter the world with
}      cigarette butts?
} Why are places that are open 24 hours have locks on the doors?
} Why does the lighter flame drop to an unusable height every time you try
}      to do a bong load?
}
} Just to get you started.
