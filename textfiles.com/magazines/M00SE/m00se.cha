                   OFFICIAL CHARTER OF THE M00SE ILLUMINATI


 1) CHAPTERS:  Each and every member of the M00se Illuminati is his or her own
    chapter.  He or she is also the Bull M00se (spiritual leader), Grand Poobah
    (political leader), and treasurer (money-handler) of his own chapter.
    Therefore, a chapter could be listed as such:


               THE BILL DICKSON CHAPTER OF THE M00SE ILLUMINATI

 2) THRONGS:  Any group of two or more chapters gathered together in one place
    is a throng.  The more chapters, the bigger the throng.

 3) SYMBOL:  The symbol is a four-sided, eleven-step pyramid with an eye in
    the top step and a three-pronged antler on either side.  It once was
    thought impossible to draw with text characters, but a case of extreme
    boredom one day was cured by the invention of a text-character symbol.

 4) SECRET M00SE SIGN: Thumbs to side of head, fingers outstretched to simulate
    antlers.  Usually accompanied by the Secret M00se Call.


 5) SECRET M00SE CALL:  BL00P!  (Taken from Bloom County.)


 6) PURPOSE:  To confuse, obfuscate, bewilder, and befuddle the masses.


 7) POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS:  Varies according to the chapter.  The M00se
    Illuminati as a whole will support any chapter's beliefs.  Thus, the M00se
    Illuminati may, at any given time, be supporting any number of contra-
    dicting philosophies.


 8) NEW MEMBERS:  Any chapter can dub new members so long as it uses a silly,
    meaningless ceremony that is made up on the spot to do so.  It would be
    very nice if the Bill Dickson chapter (DICKSON@HARTFORD.BITNET) were
    notified so it could record the new member/chapter.  This will allow the
    Bill Dickson chapter to send all chapters any new information.


 9) SECRET NUMBERS:  The secret numbers of the M00se Illuminati are 11 (the
    number of steps in the pyramid) and 13 (11 + two antlers).  Be on the
    lookout for these numbers, as they may hold some significance.  Also watch
    out for 31 (13 transposed) and 11 (11 transposed).


10) PLURAL:  The plural of M00se is M00ses--NOT  M00se, moosies, moosi, moosei,
    moostachios, or Bim Skala Bim.


11) SLASHED 'O's:  The 'O's in M00se, Bloop, and all other EXTREMELY m00sey
    words are slashed: 0.  This apparently originated in the opening credits of
    Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to do
    this with the lower-case on a computer.  In fact, it is now difficult to do
    it with the upper-case, as most computers no longer have slashed zeros.  We
    use the zero where we would want a slashed 'o' anyway, to remind us that we
    are making an attempt.  Please draw the slashes in if you print a hardcopy.


12) FLEXIBLE RULES:  Any of the rules may be changed except for numbers 1, 3,
    4, 5, 10, and 11.  If you attempt to change a rule in  such a way as to
    create a paradox, remember that m00ses don't care about paradox.


13) ALWAYS REMEMBER:  Bloop!  Bloop bloop?  BL00P!  Bloop?  BL0000000P!
