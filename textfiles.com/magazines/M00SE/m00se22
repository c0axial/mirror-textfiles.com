Greetings All & Bl00p to Ya!
     
   Well another (how many?) rotations of the Earth, and M00se Droppings
did not get out as planned.  :(  The reason for this, to be honest, is lack
of submissions.  We need lots of submissions to have this on-going madness
continue... So please, send send SEND submissions...(droool, wimper, beg..)
     
   Enough of that.  Our very first issue came out and we were quite pleased
with it.  We hope you were all as pleased. :*)  We included page headers for
those who like to print MD out, but due to incompatibilities amongst host
machines, this didn't work out as planned.  Oh well... we tried.
     
   About the Mega-Thr0ng-A-Th0n, we still would like input:  suggestions,
scribblings, mad ravings, whatever...  The idea still sounds like a good
one to us (Pickle, SalmonM00se and Goblin).  We will try and help things along
by making suggestions or guest appearances (hint hint...*grin*).
     
   We've still included an index, but without page numbers it'll be a little
harder to find things.  (Hmmm, we could always do it by line number...)   8)
     
                                            Goblin & SalmonM00se


Just A short note: Please, PLEASE include your name/nick with Submissions.
We WANT to give you credit for yer submissions!

Anyone owning a Macintosh:  Have you seen the "Talking M00se" Desk Accessory?
It is VERY am00sing.  If you're inactive for a specified time, the M00se

add phrases (such as Bl00p) to its vocabulary.  For info, ask LEE_JES@CTSTATEU.

According to our sources, the Mega-Thr0ng-A-Thon will occur at the next
planetary conjunction.  M00ses wishing otherwise should elect a MTaT
co-ordinator in their area.  The co-ordinators will then be able to discuss
the MT-a-T with each other.  Other suggestions are welcome as well.

Spaceman Biff ....
     
     
Yo, hey, hey!
     
        Thanks for all the help rendered on the subject of mollusks and,
in particular, scallops (oooh). I now feel much more secure in accepting
them as valid critters in their own right, but I'm not sure I'd want one
to marry my daughter. If I had a daughter, that is. Anyway, that's not
what I'm writing about tonight. I'd like to address a matter closer to
the heart of much of the human population.
     
        Several years ago a friend of mine and I were discussing what it
is that causes some men to be attracted to certain women, while others
were not, and we worked out some of the mechanics thereof. While the
treatment may seem involved, there are actually several easily
understood fundamentals that m00ses might find of interest.
     
      Basically, despite outward appearances, men are discrete when it
comes to romantic attractions. It is only on the macroscopic level that
they appear indiscrete.
     
        To treat the problem correctly, it is instructive to consider each
man an operator. Then it follows that each of these operators has a set of
women, his eigenwomen, if you will, upon which the operator operates, returning
the same woman, times a constant. Note that men must be hermitian, as these
constants are never complex.
     
        Then, it may be said that every woman to which this operator is
attracted may be represented as a linear combination of his eigenwomen.
"Smoothness" is that quality of having a basis set of eigenwomen that
spans all possible women (the dimension of which set may possibly be
infinite), or to put it more succinctly, such a man is a "smooth
operator." That some peanut butter appeals to all humans serves as an
example; everyone likes smooth peanut butter, but only some people like
chunky. (What are those chunks made out of, anyway?)
     
        Other quantized values, for example, charm, beauty, and
strangeness, have but minor importance, but then, we all have our little
quarks.
     
        I hope that I have shed some light on a topic which causes no
end of confusion to the human populace. I recognize that I will most
probably get a good deal of heat for having couched this entirely from a
makAle standpoint, and in my own defense I should like to say that an
analogous system exists for women and their respective, if not
respectable, eigenmen. However, despite concerted efforts to discover
the nature thereof, I have failed to discern the logic of this
sister system. Perhaps other m00ses might take up here, where I
must leave off.
     
                                        Fondly,
     
                                        --Spaceman Biff!!!!!!!!

The Lemon.  A soliloquy delivered in the produce section
     
O Lemon!
You round
(well maybe not round but kinda funny-shaped)
thing
tell me in your simplicity
about life.
     
O Lemon!
Surely you know about life
about love
about happiness
You sit on the astroturf stuff in the fruit bin
and look wise.
     
O Lemon!
Surely if I pick you up
and hold you
I can feel wisdom in your funny bumps
and if I hold you
under my nose
I can smell your knowledge
or if I hold you
next to my ear
I can hear the sounds
of the fruit grove
that was once your home.
     
O Lemon!
Why do you not answer me?
Well.
Perhaps if I taste you
I can gather your understanding through absorption.
     
O Lemon!
(burp)

*************************** M00SCELLANEOUS NONSENSE ****************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
This Submission is from Pickle :)
     
Excerpts from Matt Groening's book _Love_Is_Hell_.  The book is a collection of
his cartoons, called "Life In Hell".  Highly recommended, especially if you can
get the boxed set, "Box Full Of Hell".
     
     
WHAT THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS HAVE SAID VIS-A-VIS LOVE
     
"Love is a slippery eel that bites like hell."  -- Bertrand Russell
     
"Love is a perky elf dancing a merry jig and then suddenly he turns on you with
a miniature machine-gun."  -- Kierkegaard
     
"Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips and
pins you underneath.  At night, the ice weasels come."  -- Nietzsche
     
     
Watch out for these early warning signs of love:
        1) Bouncy step
        2) Goo-goo eyes
        3) Babbling
        4) Bored friends
     
Avoid sharing affection with people wearing desperate t-shirts.
        "Will you be my friend?"
     
Forbidden conversation topics in bed:
        1) Local elections
        2) Septic tanks
        3) Chores
        4) Your partner's shortcomings ("Did anyone ever tell you you grunt
                amusingly when you make love?")
     
When getting undressed with a new friend for the first time, do not try to
break the tension by gesticulating wildly and making comical throat noises.
        "Geeba geeba geeba."
     
Warning signs your lover is getting bored:
        1) Passionless kisses
        2) Frequent sighing
        3) Moved; left no forwarding address
     
Advantages of heartbreak:
        1) More room in bed
        2) Time slows to a crawl
        3) Opportunity to get in touch with your weeping
     
When in doubt about how to proceed in love, heed the advice of your closest
friends.
        "Don't let yer meatloaf!"
     
Be considerate.  After mesmerizing your friends for hours with details of your
love miseries, be sure to feign interest when they start babbling about their
insignificant problems.
        "So I go, 'Oh yeah?' and she goes 'Yeah!!'  So I go--"
     
If you're going to argue with your partner at a restaurant, make it a cheap
one, because you won't be tasting your food anyhow.
        "How's your duck l'orange, stupid?"
        "Shut up and eat yer truffles."
     
Do not make jocular marriage proposals if you don't want to get clobbered.
        "Will you mar--"
        "Oh, yes!"
        "--inate this steak for me?"
     
When hanging up angrily on a lover, watch those fingers!
        "Go to hell!!" SLAM! "OW!!!"
     
Do not write and publish any books while in the midst of complete and utter
heartbreak.
        _They're_ALL_Sons_Of_Bitches_ (vol. I)
     
Do not take love advice from cynical, embittered, sarcastic cartoon strips.
        "Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?"
        "Him?"

What does the Oracle do after it gets off from work?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
What any other good oracle does...chill out...have a beer or 3...
play games....watch tv...see his gal... ;-)

If deer are camouflaged by being brown, why aren't cows camouflaged by
being green?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
It is obvious that the cows' camouflage has worked exceedingly well.
In fact, it has worked so well that nobody has ever seen a green cow
around, as they are too well hidden.  By comparison, the brown
with white splotches which deer refer to as their 'camouflage' is nothing.

Hey Oracle - -
     
What do signs that say  "Proper Identification Required" mean?
     
Is there such thing as "Improper Identification?"
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Such signs mean different things in different countries:
In Britain: You will be escorted out of the area if found within.
In the U.S: You will be escorted out in handcuffs.
In Germany: You will be put in jail for a month.
In Italy:   You will be put in jail for a year.
In Russia:  You will be sent to Siberia for five years.
In Turkey:  You will be shot by a guard.
In Bulgaria: You will be tortured on the spot for five days, then
                shot in the head at close range.
     
Improper identification is such an item as a driver's license, say, when
a Cosmic Top Security Nato Clearance Pass is required.

How did humankind ever get along without computers?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
This is a very brilliant question, on the scale of questions to the
Oracle.  The answer is: paper.  There was a strange and arcane art, now
lost to mankind, but once known as "writing," which allowed humans to
record data and even perform simple calculations on a sheet of "paper."
Paper was a very thin, white substance, the art of whose making has also
been lost to mankind, but which was created, by a secret but subsidized
process, from old-growth rainforest from the Tongass National Park.
Perhaps the reason this substance fell into disuse was that there is now
no plant life taller than six feet existing on Earth today.  Paper was,
of course, in the Oracle's unbiased opinion, a far worse medium than
silicon, but was far superior for wiping the rear end.
-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
Are there really people who just won't ever be rational?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
yes...in fact, you can count them.
there are exactly pi of them.
-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
Explain the American electoral process, using only vocabulary and phrasing
which the average American would understand.
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
screw the middle class...

What would the world be like if 12 wasn't a prime number?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
The world would be vastly changed for the worse.  Individual countries
would be in about the same place, but many things would be changed:
     
        - There would be a new nation, about where the junction between
          Spain, Italy, and Germany is now, called "France".  It would
          be populated by the most obnoxious people in history.
     
        - The country "Russia" would be governed by a weird and bizarre system
          known as "Communism".  Despite having failed economically for 60
          years, their leaders would be trying to spread "Communism", most
          often by invading their neighbors.
     
        - There would be many so called "religions", spread about the world.
          They would involve the idea that, rather than being dead for good,
          a person goes someplace after death.  Why anyone would think that
          is a mystery to the Oracle.
     
        - The almost unknown (in the present world) bug called the "mosquito"
          would have an appendage solely for the drinking of blood from animals
          while still living.  It would spread horrible diseases by this
          method.
     
These are just a few examples.  No one would want to live in a world
where 12 was not prime; in fact, there would be many suicides.

How long can you tread water?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
WEll, let me put it this way.
     
say an evil scientist captured me and brought me to his
evil laboratory and strapped me into an
evil machine that went
     
     
 WHIRRRRRR
     
and
     
 BUZZZZZZZZ
     
and whose sole evil purpose was to evilly create and
an exact copy of myself whose very essence and being
down to the last atom was identical to me in every way.
     
I would be able to tread water as long as he could.
