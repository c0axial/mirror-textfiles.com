               A Twenty Minute STTNG Short:

                 "The Stupidity Snare"

Scene:      Standard shot of Enterprise in orbit.

Picard:     Captain's Log, stardate, et cetera, et cetera. During a
            mapping mission of the Omicron Kappa system, we came
            across the wreckage of a Pakled ship.  Commander LaForge
            assisted in the decoding of information recovered from
            the ship's black box.

GERARLD is standing in front of a burned-out console.  Faint trails of smoke are
drifing up out of several large holes in the front. Behind him stand ALFREYD,
MORTIMERD and BENUTI.  Each takes a turn to point at the console and deliver a
line.
