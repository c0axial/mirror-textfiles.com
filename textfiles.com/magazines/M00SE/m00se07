        Hello, all.  As I write this, it is the only thing going into the
newsletter.  I have received *nothing else*.  If I'm going to keep this
thing coming out, I need contributions!  Send interesting news, fiction,
anything!  I've heard some GREAT ideas from some of you, but they don't
do me or any other m00ses any good unless you write them up and send them
to me!
        Which brings me to the next topic.  I've asked Sabre to stop forwarding
M00se Droppings to CSBB.M00se, mainly to ease up the load on BITNET that
must occur everytime M00se Droppings gets shot out of there (over 60 rather
large documents....)  We DO want to keep using it, though!  So here's what
it's for, at least in my opinion.  Let's use, as an example, the plea we
had from a person suffering tuition overload, last issue (or was it the
issue before?)  The initial document would go through m00se droppings, where
everyone can read it.  Any discussion that follows, however, should take
place on csbb.M00se.  This way, once a topic is started rolling in M00se
Droppings, it can continue at a much faster rate on CSBB.M00se.
        As another example, there is an *extremely* m00sey idea in the works
at our Maine thr0ng.  They are (supposedly!) going to write up a proposal
and send it to me, and I will include it in M00se Droppings.  But we don't
want to wait for the next issue to come out to see what kind of thoughts
people have about this idea, so we would discuss it on CSBB.M00se.  Perhaps
the final version would reappear in M00se Droppings, but all the modification
should be done on CSBB.M00se.
 
        Well, it's now been several days, and I've received two items.
So here comes issue 7......
 
                                        Bill.

        None this time, I'm afraid.  Except in reference to Camp Relay II.
I discovered, to my bewilderment, that Kamikaze did not, in fact, name it
Camp Relay II: The Quest for M00se.  *I* didn't make it up.  I don't know
who did.  But in any case, that wasn't the official name, it was Camp Relay
II only.  There were, however, lots of m00ses there, and we had fun.  Perhaps
someone will write up a report?  (Hint, hint)

THE ADVENTURES OF A FORD ESCORT..(Or driving with a crazy m00se)..
..(Or The Three wheel drive Ford escort)
 
The day was the day before this, Sunday August the 14th.
The Subject a blue Ford Escort..name unknown.
The driver a Stacey (Starfire?) strange name..
The passengers two obviously mentally unbalanced people..
calling themselves Sindex and Hobgoblin.
 
Hi! there, folks! M00selock Holmes here with a report on the strange goings on
of fellow m00ses..
 
It all started one evening in England when i was seated in my den awaiting the
famous ...oopps sorry..wrong tale...
 
The day was Sunday the 14th, the time 6:23pm..I was sitting picnicking near a
local reservoir (very m00se like hangout in the hot weather) when all of the
sudden i spotted some fellow m00ses out for a sunday drive. A nice day for a
quiet drive. I sat there drinking my tea in the shade as they tore around a
corner, careening towards a jogger and some kids (it was close by a half an
inch) and passed by in a blur.. I jumped up eager to find out where my fellow
m00se would be heading in such a hurry (spilled my tea too..) and got
into my truck, an orange Isuzu. The chase was afoot! I spotted them going out
of the reservoir and up a dirt road...(in a Ford Escort..incredible;
these americans are such brave people) I mean up! The road went up a hill
and into a field..The music coming from the car durring all of this  was
varied...from Lost Boys to the infamous Beetlejuice sound track..
 
Well, that was too much..The question was were they trying to confuse the world
by showing that a ford escort is really an off road vehicle, or was the car a
transformer?
 
I put my Isuzu in gear and followed as they went straight into the woods..
The ford escort putted along fine until the road suddenly filled with ruts.
Well, to make a long story short the silly m00ses got themselves stuck good
in the middle of the woods in a ford escort. It was up to me to save the day.
Before i got a chance great clouds of smoke came out of the car..It occured
to me that they were thinking..egads!.. I heard Sindex mutter something about
the car being a three wheel drive car and the next thing i knew all was well..
The ford had transformed into super ford!! Pulling itself outa the ditch it
lurched forwards back down the road, spilling coolant along the way..(well
what do you expect from a Ford?).
 
Later i found out the folk had been in search of reservoirs that day to
do strange water rituals to escape the heat..(under water bl00ping?)
 
They ended their day with a chinese food dinner and a few close run-ins with
the local police..
 
                     Well thats all for now..Gota Vam00se..
 
                             M00selock Holmes......
 
Starfire:"the question is, what is M00selock Holmes smoking in that pipe?",
"Vanilla beans?" (a weird hallucinagenic substance..)
