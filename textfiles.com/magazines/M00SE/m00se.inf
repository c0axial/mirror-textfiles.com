             INFORMATION ON VARIOUS M00SE ILLUMINATI SUBDIVISIONS


1) THE SOUTH WINDSOR AUTODUELLISTS OF THE M00SE ILLUMINATI

     SWAMI was formed to keep the streets clear of dangerous drunk drivers,
idiots, Yugos, orange trucks, the guy who, suddenly and without warning, turns
left in front of you when you have the right of way, and other things that
could in any way interfere with the pleasure of any m00se's driving.  SWAMI
units are not above the hijacking and looting of ice cream trucks.  The
vehicles of individual SWAMI units are vastly different from one another,
excluding one thing -- all are heavily armed and armored, and all are driven by
highly proficient autoduellists.


2) THE SECRET M00SE SERVICE

     The S.M.S. was formed in 1986 by a man whose real name cannot be printed,
for obvious reasons.  He may only be referred to as 'Chip'.  The S.M.S. was
formed to protect m00ses from the subversive influences of various rival
groups, especially the Ancient and Powerful Illuminati of Bavaria.  Enemy
agents are usually tickled and forced to eat pickled herring by our torture
expert, one Opus P. Bell.  The S.M.S. naturally uses covert means to reach the
ends it desires, occasionally calling in SWAMI units for military-type
operations.  All m00ses can rejoice in their new-found freedom from worry now
that the Secret M00se Service is protecting them.


3) CHAOS ENGINEERING

MII 321  CHAOS Engineering

     MII 321 offers a comprehensive study in CHAOS Engineering.  There are no
technical prerequisites as such, but a comprehensive background in sarcasm,
subordination, obfustication, and random behaviour patterns are highly
recommended.  Students will learn various methods of non-violent actions
designed to be counter-productive to the machinations of any sort of
administration, large or small.  Such methods will include back talk, petition
drives, subversive paper work (see also MII 274 Forms Substitution for Maximum
Disruptive Effect), and malicious sign posting.  Non-lethal weaponry will be
briefly discussed, and covered in depth in the course's continuation, MII 322.

MII 322  Advanced CHAOS Engineering: Use of Non-Lethal Weaponry

     MII 322 picks up where MII 321 left off, and covers extensively the use of
such Non-Lethal Weapons such as water guns, water grenades, powder bombs,
shaving cream, and, for extreme cases, splat-ball guns.  There is a $75 lab fee.
