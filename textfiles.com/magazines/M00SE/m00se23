Spriiiing is here! ah-suh-puh-ring is here!  Life is skittles and life is

BL00p!
     
Some of you may have noticed that there haven't been any M00se Droppings for a
while (you could say the M00se is constipated).  (Nia kulpo, nia granda kulpo!)
For a while, this was because there were *no* submissions.  This is, of course,
understandable, since many of us have papers to write and can't afford to bl00p
around.
     
NOW, however, there are submissions.  (Of course, this issue could have gotten
out a few days earlier, but this time it was *our* fault; Goblin decided to
join a Twinkie-farming commune while I was away in Florida training at the
SWAMI-swamp.)
     
The next issue *will* be out no later than the twelfth of May.  Submission
deadline for the next issue is Thursday, May 11.  (As long as we receive it by
Friday morning, it'll be in the issue, which will be sent out in the late
afternoon.)
     
One article is missing from this issue: we assigned a M00se to cover a rumored
conspiracy concerning blue-haired grandmothers, but he hasn't reported back.
If we have received no word from him by next Thursday, you'll have to remove
him from your lists.

Hi Gang! How's it going out there in television land? Spaceman Biff
here. I just had a few thoughts I just HAD to share with y'all.
     
        1) If Penelope' is the classical Greek symbol for wifely
        fidelity, and Calliope' is the Muse of the dance, and
        Turpsycchide' the Muse of music, does that make Envelope'
        the Muse of punctual postal delivery?
     
        2) Is there any interest out there in starting a new
        m00se shaped breakfast cereal? We could call it Fr00t Bl00ps.
        Test market: San Francisco.
     
        3) I am working on a new mollusk-specific hunter/killer,
        but am having a little trouble with the guidance system.
        The basic idea is that the fully automated unit is released into
        the ocean and hunts down scallops (oooh.) and cooks them in the
        shell using a small, poorly shielded microwave oven. The unit
        operates by distilling combustible hydrocarbons from the
        seawater itself which it then burns in a diesel engine.
        Unfortunately, the magnetic-to-true North deviation is huge up
        around Alaska, where the fuel is most plentiful this time of
        year. (And speaking of North deviations, how about that Ollie,
        huh?!) Any helpful hints would be appreciated.
     
        4) THERE IS _NO_ RULE #6!!!!!
     
        5) Love is like drinking from a broken water glass. It doesn't
        hold what you put in it, the edges are cold, hard, and pointy,
        and you risk serious lip damage if you try too hard. Ahem.
     
        6) And now, a poem from Mr. Steve Martin:
     
                        The Pointy Birds
     
                The pointy birds are pointy, pointy.
                They anoint my head, anointy, 'nointy.
     
        7) Well, that went so well I think I'll finish with a set of
        poems concerning fishing, and the logical conclusion of fishing,
        ripping off fishheads. These were written by yours truly, a Mr.
        Thomas Wickham, and a Mr. Michael Graham, all manly men who
        are mighty to kill fish.
     
     
TO FISH, TO FISH
THIS IS MY ONLY WISH
WHEN OUT FISHING LATE
I ALWAYS FEEL GREAT
WHEN OUT FISHING EARLY
I FEEL MANLY AND BURLY
TO CAST OUT MY LINE
IS NOTHING MORE DIVINE?
TRULY, FISHING IS MOST QUIET,
MOST PEACEFUL.
THEN OUT GOES YOUR LINE!
THIS IS THE TIME.
RIP OFF ITS HEAD
UNTIL IT SCREAMS AND IS DEAD!
     
     
     
I'll tell you a tale (which you'll get in the mail);
A schedule of fishing designs!
Of heads to be torn (on the Ides of March, morn)
From the fish that we snare on our lines!
     
We'll hook up the bait   and get there no late
-er than six A.M., beating the sun.
Then cast our rigs out, enticing the trout
To a meal, and thus, our meal become!
     
For the quiet of dawn, when to the lake I have gone
With a cup of hot Joe by my side
Makes me again whole, a tocsin of the soul
Awaiting doomed fish from the tide.
     
Then later, to Bud's, for some eggs and fried spuds
And strong coffee, and lightly singed bread.
Then 205 Linn is the place we'll begin
To peel skin back, and rip off some heads.
     
So now comes the time  for the end of my rhyme.
Preserve it so you can look back
Once again to this reference, so that, with great deference,
We can sacrifice the trout we caught at Wickhamhead rock, in full view
of the bass and sunny in the tank*, thereby striking fear into their
hearts as they watch us merrily decapitate their buddies and cousins!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!!!!!!!!!
     
     
* -     Mssrs. Wickham and Graham keep several locally caught fish
        in a seventy gallon aquarium in their living room. Wickhamhead
        rock is on of the ornaments in the tank.
     
     
     
     
Fish heads, fish heads!
Let's go hook some fish heads!
Fish heads, fish heads!
Let's rip off    some!
     
In the fish tank
Happy laughing fish heads!
Rip off fish heads
From the Lake!
     
     
Honestly, it seems to me quite a shame not to go fishing this afternoon!
Respond soon, or be a goon.
     
     
                                        Happy, Laughing

(Author's note - the following poem is written as if in a dialect common
                 to a particular southern community; no offense is
                 intended, any more than if I had written it using a

        It sure ain't too early to be manly and burly
        And rip off the heads of some fish
        And strip flesh from their spine, so with a fine wine
        Their remains make one hell of a dish.
     
        Perhaps thou wouldst deign, barring instance of rain
        To go snare a few sometime this week?
        We could try in the lake, or a stream, if we take
        The precautions for wading a creek.
     
        This Saturday noon would be all none too soon
        For this lad to go dangle a lure.
        Any cold that we catch will be surely no match
        For some trout liver oil; the cure.
     
        I've run out of rhyme, so respond in quick time
        O'er the system, or perhaps face to face.
        I'm sending this fare to both Wick and "Half-There"***
        To see who responds first; wins the race.

 Once again a fish poem, that is less than a tome
     
         It would be my pleasure,
         the length of to measure,
         HEAD to tail of a beautiful fish.
         Then rip off its head,
         butter on the rest spread,
         and turn into a devourable dish.
     
         The ides would be great,
         best early, not late,
         lest the piscines no longer are biting.
         We speak of this later,
         til then, alligator,
         in fishheadish thoughts be delighting.
     
     
     
        That's all for now, cadets. Stay tuned for Batman!!!

The following is from Indiana Joe...
     
   My roomate found this inside a roll of toilet paper.  We have no idea where
it came from or what it means, so we thought this was the perfect place to send
it.  Here it is.
     
There is garbage out of food-water-TV-
radio-books-newspapers in America -
mental and physical cancers are made
out of living and children everyday.
                                       1776
Why don't world governments and every state
in America do what Father Flanagan did -
build a boystown and save world children.
Easy to do if governments are not parasites.
     
Dictators and sick value free with their own
kind would die with *sickness-cancers and
wars* - why build them in any way.
     
There would not be any governments if
governments had to prove themselves
what governments allow.
     
Duty-honor-country and legally-
morally correct to destroy business
and government parasites
     
1776 - America minutement watchmen not
Washington DC Columbia parasites statues -
Valley Forge reminders not decorators
in every state in America -           1776
     
Big people are parasites not children
     
When is America going to have a
school of morals for lawyers.
Why are world governments not self
supporting Boy Scouts or better
                                    1776
Bankruptcy signature law is a sick devil
cancer parasite business and government
and are *accessories* to crimes against every
age and create martyrs and wars.
     
Minimum wages governments and people -
only good working conditions needed not
parasites = work clothes-work shoes
America not sick mirrors
     
Living creatures have to be killed every
day = best of medicine if possible -
salf control - medicine ground floor planet
not snake pits out of living or material
B[B                                 1776
No money schools - no useless studies
halfday in factory - halfday in school.
Everyone gets an equal chance -
nno government parasite tax or salary.
     
Big people are parasites not children.

******************************* ASK THE ORACLE *********************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
Here, from Hal Eisen, is more "Ask the Oracle"...
     
-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
     
     
It's been said that the Lord has an inordinate fondness for beetles
(tens of thousands of species; about 1/3 of all species of anything
are beetles).  Why is this?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Beetles are among the most funky creatures known to mankind.  But they are
also very well-designed.  A solid beetle, take for example a June bug, is
the flying tank of the animal world - nothing below the size of a bird or
a tarantula can so much as scratch its chitin.  But I wander, and begin to
leave the subject.  This may be a result of not sleeping last night.
Anyway, the Questioner asked why the Lord has an inordinate fondness for
beetles.  The Oracle can confirm this surprising fact.  The Lord loves
beetles - He has them fried for breakfast, boiled for lunch, and sauteed
for dinner; in a pie for dessert.  Questioner may then ask, if the Lord
loves his beetles so, why did He not have them rule the world?  Instead
we have these ugly, pale, squishy creatures.  This is a very good
question, which is only logical, because the Oracle asked it.  But I am
slipping again.  The answer is that humans really are beetles; we are
locked in a state of permanent hallucinations caused by sleeping too much.
Try not sleeping for a week or so, and the people around you will truly
appear to change into their natural form, that of the Giant Leprous Stag
Beetle.  It's a very illuminating experience.  Or, you can just put on
these special sunglasses, courtesy of the Resistance, and see that those
around you are actually GLSBs.  But I begin to plagiarize.  The Oracle,
being infinitely wise, knows that it is always time to go to sleep when
you begin plagiarizing.
     
     
-   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
     
     
Are computers good or bad? (You do not have to totally agree or disagree)  Why?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
WEll, one must first consider if computers can
truly BE. Then, we may decide if dey be good or dey be bad.
I tend to think of a computer, at least THIS computer,
as nothing more than an overgrown fancy automatic
coffee machine, which doesn't even brew coffee well, at that.
Is coffee bad? Well, that depends on it's source, the terror room
being a prime example of truly BAD coffee, while one is
hard pressed to come up with an instance of truly good coffee.
Since the computer really can't even do such a simple thing as
brew coffee, even bad coffee, one must conclude that it's
designers didn't like coffee very much, although it is reasonable
to suppose that they did indeed consume vast quantities of it.
Why this discrepancy exists is a matter of further speculation
which should perhaps be best contemplated by a system programmer
pulling an all-nighter to meet a deadline.
So, did the system's designer, under the influence of coffee,
design a system which was good?
I think not, as that most feared and dirty word, compromise
must have also exerted quite an influence, and under the twin
seductions of coffee and compromise, the designer could
only have fallen into catatonia.

How can I determine if I'm sane or insane?
     
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Flip a coin:  If it comes up a polka-dotted grue, you are insane.
If, however, it is the gold and silver herd of zebras chasing the
witch's broom, you are perfectly sane.

On the Master Lock commercials, why do they shoot the lock when picking
it is so easy?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Damn good question.  Maybe they've never picked one themselves.  Master
Locks are the most pickable locks ever developed; the Guinness Stout Book
of Irreproducible Records record that Peter ap Llacanwych holds the world
record for Master Lock picking, 3,423 consecutively in just over six
hours, with his teeth.  (The Welsh are, however, very dextrous with their
teeth.)  Maybe they figure that the lock is so old and incompetent that it
deserves a quick death.

If nobody said something to somebody, would they be as mad as if
another person had said something to somebody else?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
I hope you have studied logic to some degree or other, as to properly
answer this question, we must delve into monadic predicate logic.  I
will begin with the premise that our society consists of all sorts of
people, including those emotionally incapable of anger and those who
become enraged at the slightest provocation.  From this, we know that
there exists an x, such that x is a person (Px) and x becomes enraged
at the slightest provocation.  That is, somebody becomes enraged at
the slightest provocation.  Call this particular instance of x, c.
Thus, we know:
     
Pc ^ Ec (I forgot to include that Ex means x becomes enraged at the
slightest provocation.)
     
where c=somebody
     
By similar reasoning, there exists another arbitrary x (call it d)
such that x is a person and x is emotionally incapable of anger (Ix).
     
Thus:
     
Pd ^ Id
     
This allows us to say with confidence that somebody (c) would become
far more angry than somebody else (d) regardless of the situation.  Of
course, each one is equally mad, as neither one has what we would call
a stable mind-set.  That, however, is more the realm of the psychologist
than the logician.  How fortunate that the Oracle is all things.

Is selling class notes illegal and/or unethical?
 ($2.50 cheap call 555-5742)
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:

will do.

What is the best use for:
     
1 kg horsehair
3 gallons of rice pudding
and two hundred yards of library debit cards, laid end to end?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
To compute the value of pi.  Use the debit cards to mark out a 25 by
25 yard square, and inside the square a 25 yard radius quarter-circle.
Now mix the horsehair with the glop, mold into a ball, and let dry.
The repeatedly throw the ball to a random spot inside the 25 yard
square.  After several hundred iterations, the value of pi will be
four times the ratio of the number of times the ball fell inside the
quarter circle to the total number of times the ball was thrown.

how come when ever anyone besides me does something on the computer, it works,
but when i do the EXACT same thing, it doesn't?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
The computers today are smart. They have artificial intelligence and
are making you a experimental subject for their research in cognitive
science and human reasoning. You will soon find out that they have been
running you and you are inferior to them. The will send a full analysis
of your mental capabalities (if any) and your psychological behavior.

What does "eyes only" mean?  Do people often use their teeth to read?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
You laugh.  However, scientific studies have shown that the rats in the
deepest nether parts of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library are among the
most knowledgeable rats in the world.  Also, that the books in the deepest
nether parts of the Milton S. Eisenhower are among the most rat-gnawed
books in the world.  Therefore, the conclusion is obvious: rats read with
their teeth.  With only a few exceptions, curiously enough including most
of the people who run the world, humans are more talented than rats.
Therefor[Be, humans should also be able to read with their teeth.  The
Oracle therefore suggests that the Questioner take it upon himself to
test this theory by stuffing the Encyclopedia Britannica down his throat.

If all roads lead to Rome, how the hell do you get out of the city?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
        Rome is, of course, world renowned for one of its greatest
contributions to history (and civil engineering):  its roads.
However, this is not its only great invention/improvement.  Certain
other roman practices, such as the orgy, still have fame and followers
in this day and age.  This knowledge that the Romans had almost
comes close to impressing The Oracle.
        The Romans, in their finite, but still rather powerful logic, foresaw
the problem that you have queried and made another great contribution
to history (and civil engineering):  the sewer system.  That's right.
In its final death throes Rome had the brilliant idea that anyone who
wanted to leave the Roman empire not only had to beat all of the
Roman Legions, they also had to clamber through the dank, smelly, grue
infested Roman sewers.  This idea not only survives, albeit modifidied,
in the modern world, but prospers and is the subject of certain D movies:
C.H.U.D., Alligator, etc.
        Truly, the Romans were quite devious.

"The worms crawl in and the worms crawl out,
 The ones that crawl in are weak and thin,
 The ones that crawl out are fat and stout,
 Your eyes fall in and your teeth fall out,
 Your brains come tumbling down your snout,
 Be merry, my friends, be merry.  Uurrgghh."
     
So who wrote this originally?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
The true original author of this was George Bush, talking to Ronald
Reagan.  The little lecture on what really happens when you die fell
short of the desired effect, as Reagan did not appear to know what
a "brain" was.  This was possibly from the results of introspection.
