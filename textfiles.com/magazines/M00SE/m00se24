Bl00p and happy finals to you!
     
Well, we've got a story, a bunch of songs which Goblin gleaned from the UMNEWS
M00se list, and a whole lot of ID's.  Not much else.  But at least the issue
came out on time!
     
A couple of notes about ID files:  Your *chapter* name is your real name, like
the one that's on your driver's license.  The *thr0ng* name is the name of your
school.  This information is in the M00se.info file - if you need a new copy,
please send a request to LEE_JES@CTSTATEU.BITNET.
     
By the way, LEE_JES is *not* a listserve.  Sorry for stating the obvious. 8*)
     
Once again, send submissions to Goblin, at WITHALL@CTSTATEU (Bitnet).
Address corrections and back-issue ordering: LEE_JES@CTSTATEU (Bitnet).
     
Now that summer is approaching, perhaps it will be a little easier to schedule
Thr0ng-a-thons...  Anyone?  Anyone?
     
Goblin and I hope to throw one (though it can't be TOO big) soon, anyone who's
in the area (Connecticut or thereabouts) and interested, send us some E-mail...
     
Well, enough boring talk... on with the issue!  To those of you who are leaving
the nets for the summer, have a good one!

                    Dealing with Dragons
     
     
    "AAAAYYYYYIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEE!!"
    The scream echoes around the room; Kara flinches in mid-step, hissing
as some of the hot liquid in the mug slops onto her hand.  She covers the
remaining distance to the bed in three quick strides, swearing under her
breath; at least the bard had taken this quietly.
    With the ease of long practice, she lifts the head of the woman on
the bed and forces some of the liquid between clenched teeth.  A whimper
of agony changes to a hacking cough when some of the potion is inhaled.
    "Come on now, drink this and you'll feel better." Kara wearily says.
    The woman in the bed drinks, too dazed to resist the suggestion.
Suddenly, she jerks upright in bed, knocking the mug from Kara's hand.
Green eyes dart around the room, looking for remembered danger, hands
curl as if around a sword hilt.  She winces back from Kara's backlit
figure, eyes dilating as they catch the glare from the candles.  Kara's
economical tug on her patient's wrist pulls her supporting elbow out
from underneath her and sends her crashing back on the pillows.
    "Calm down, no one is going to hurt you here."  Kara grumps.
    "Where...?"  the woman's eyes are puzzled, and she no longer
struggles against the hand pushing her back into the bed.
    "Some place safe, that's all you need to know."  Kara straightens,
removing her hand and watching the drug take effect.  The woman's face
relaxes as the pain eases, her eyes drift close, then snap open again.
    "The bard is sleeping," Kara answers the unspoken question, then more
sternly, "Which is what you should be doing."
    The woman nods, obviously fighting to stay awake and look around
the room.  Kara sighs in exasperation, then starts to gather the pieces
of shattered mug, firmly reminding herself that strangling patients is
frowned upon.  When she looks up again, after chasing down the last piece
of pottery, the woman is sound asleep.  Kara smiles in satisfaction, then
blows out all but one of the candles.  Taking the last lit candle she
leaves for her own bed, her exhausted footsteps scuffling on the stone
floor.
     
    "Brem, Bremer'ri, I know you can hear me." says a voice.
    The woman on the bed groans and mumbles, rolling away from the hand
shaking her shoulder.  The hand withdraws.
    "If you don't get up," continues the voice in a dry tone, "I shall
finish the food and," the voice pauses to think of something suitably
horrible.  "And take your sword and use it for a clothes rack."
    "You'll do WHAT??"  Brem bounces out of bed, dragging most of the
blankets with her.
    Lia snickers, "I knew one of those comments would get you up."
    "Lia!  You're alive!"  Kicking the blankets away from her, Brem
takes step forward, arms outstretched.
    "Oh, no!" With an expression of mock terror Lia skips out of the
way.  "Not one of your bear-hugs, my ribs hurt enough already."
    "But," Brem drops her arms, looking forlorn, "You're alive, aren't
you?"
    "As far as I've noticed."
    Brem stares at the floor, "I saw you die."  Her voices trails off.
    Lia shrugs, "Be that as it may," she holds up a hand to stop Brem's
angry retort, "No, I don't doubt you.  But be that as it may, I am alive
now."  She pauses and gives Brem a penentrating stare, "People aren't
raised from the dead in your world, are they?"
    Brem shakes her head, still looking at the floor.

Rud0lph, the brown Gund M00-00se,
Had a very long, long tag...
And if you ever saw it,
You'd wonder why he doesn't brag...
     
All of the other M00ses
Used to laugh and call him names...
They'd never let poor Rud0lph
Join in any bowling games!
     
Then one stormy Finals Week
Zemmie came to say,
"Rud0lph, with your tag so long...
Won't you be the mascot of our entire Thr0ng?"
     
     
Then all the M00ses loved him,
As they shouted out with glee...
"Rud0lph, the brown Gund M00-00se,
You'll make Bavarian his-to-reeee!
     
Heh...heh...heh...

        Show me the way to my thr0ng,
        I'm tired and I wanna go to bed,
        had a little vodka about an hour ago
        and it went right to my head.
        Wherever my herd may roam,
        by land or sea or foam,
        you will always hear my yodelling this song,
        show me the way to my thr0ng.
     
        Show me the way to my habitual gigathr0ng
        I'm fatigued and I want to retire,
        had an alcoholic beverage sixty minutes ago
        and it went right to my cerebellum,
        wherever my troupe may wander,
        by land or sea or atmospheric pressure,
        you will always hea my warbling this soliloquoy,
        show me the way to my habitual gigathr0ng.

                        You Can Call me Hal
                        ===================
     
        A m00se walks down the street,
        he says why am I plump in the middle now
        Why am I plump in the middle,
        the rest of my herd is so trim.
        I need a golden opportunity,
        I want a shot at conception,
        don't want to end up a decoration
        in a living-room graveyard.
     
        Bl00p-singers, Bl00p-singers,
        m00se in the moonlight,
        far away my cool lite Coors,
        Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly,
        get these m00se away from me,
        I don't find this thr0ng am00sing anymore.
     
        If you'll be my m00se-guard
        I can be your very best pal,
        I can call you sweetie,
        and sweetie when you call me
        you can call me Hal.
     
        A m00se walks down the street
        he says why am I short of confections,
        got a short little bit of confections,
        and oh my sweet tooth is so long,
        Where are my hooves and antlers,
        what if I bl00p here,
        who'll be my m00se-model
        now that my m00se-model is
        gone gone
        He snuck back into the booth
        with a roly-poly little fuzzy m00se,
        all along along
        there were incidents and accidents,
        there were hangings and frustrations.
     
        If you'll be my m00se-guard
        I can be your very best pal,
        I can call you sweetie,
        and sweetie when you call me
        you can call me Hal.
     
        A m00se walks down the street,
        it's a street in a strange world,
        maybe it is our world,
        maybe it's his first look around.
        He doesn't speak the language,
        he has no decency,
        he is a foreign m00se,
        he is surrounded by the sound,
        the sound,
        M00ses in the marketplace,
        gathering their tiny thr0ngs.
        He sneaks around, around,
        he sees m00ses in the architecture,
        gazing into infinity
        he sings "Bl00p!" and "Hallelujah!"
     
        If you'll be my m00se-guard
        I will be your very best pal,
        I can call you sweetie,
        and sweetie when you call me
        you can call me Hal.
                                                        *BritM00se & Mel0dy,

******************************** ASK THE ORACLE ********************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
Hello again.  This is your Guardian bringing you another Best of Oracle.  Most
of these are a bit on the old side, having been ripening in my mail file for
a few months.  I'd just like to tell all of you that I'm proud of the job
you've been doing - keep up the good work!
===============================================================================
     
     
What does O.R.A.C.L.E stand for ?
     
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Original Relayer of the Arcane and Cryptic Light, Essentially.
     
     
     
     
     
What is the best thing to do with twenty bushels of oranges, five sheets
of #60 grit sandpaper, a lawnmower, and three dead vampire bats?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
How obvious:
     
SUPPORT THE JHU BAND!!!
 (directions follow)
     
1) Sell the oranges.  Anyone who was ever in high school marching band
   will understand this.  The main fundraiser for a high school band
   is almost always a sale of big (very, very BIG) bags of citrus.
   Ask any wind instrument player you know about band citrus and there's
   of good chance they'll know what you mean.
   (and a decent chance they'll laugh hysterically)
     
2) The bathroom door in the band room sticks.  Use the sandpaper to
   fix it.
     
3) The lawnmower can be used for two things: a) dealing with the
   debris in the instrument storage room or b) cutting the grass
   behind the back entrance to the band room in the ROTC building,
   which is in dire need thereof.
     
4) The vampire bats are not to be used actively but should serve as
   symbols of both the commitment level in the band at large
   (ahem.).
     
     
     
Either that or make a rotary sander... attach the sandpaper to the
blades of the mower and make ethanol fuel from the bats & oranges.
     
     
     
     
     
Why am I already burned out four days into the semester?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
You have only slept 15-20 hours.  You drank 15-20 drinks.
You have done 15-20 hours of schoolwork.  A Venusian mind
zapper is living behind your wainscoting.
     
     
     
     
     
What do you call the little plastic things on the end of shoelaces?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
I've never addressed one of those things myself, but I suppose they must
have a name.  Maybe this is the time to create one.  Most of the good
names (such as Fred) are taken, so we should move on to a variant of that
name {Chad}.  I can't think of {use Chad} any which are fitting {Chad}
to use as a name for the {Tony's old roommate} plastic thing on the end
of {Chad} your shoelaces, but I'm sure {Chad} we can pick some
random {Chad} name to use.
     
     
     
     
     
Why does anyone use Cobol?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Excellent question.  As a matter of fact, the Oracle rates this one up
with Fermat's Last Theorem and NP-Completeness.  The Oracle is, however,
with all due modesty, the most concentrated compendium of knowledge in
the Free World (Does not include Welfare States, Communist Satellites,
tax, tags, delivery, or other pinko trash), and so will endeavor with all
the intellectual force and surplus verbiage in its arsenal to reply to
your most perspicacious question, whose brilliance and wit scintillates
throughout the domains of
     
***Interrupt***
     
ORACLE: User GOD on line 42.
     
GOD>> Stop evading the question, mortal.
     
ORACLE>> Your humblest servant grovels in Your august Presence, and will
    endeavour to respond with the speed of lightning to Your most puny
    command, however grueling the toil
     
***Interrupt***
     
GOD>> ORACLE!!
     
Right.  I will now attempt to pose a few reasons why one might use the
language COBOL (COmmon Bozo - Oriented Language)
     
1) Stupidity or ignorance.  This is the most apparently obvious reason,
   one which thus requires me to give more.
     
2) Masochism
     
3) Sadism (on the part of a superior).
     
4) The desire to learn to type, and the will to do so by forcing oneself
   to exercise the skill to an entirely excessive degree.
     
5) MegaloCPUmania: the desire to, by writing the most inefficient programs
   possible, entirely monopolize the system.  (Note: For the Oracle to
   thus, utterly without cause, and in a most unsportsmanlike manner,
   split its infinitives, represents gross negligence.)  COBOL is the best
   language for this purpose, simply because any program written in COBOL
   will use twice the memory and run at half the speed of its equivalent
   in C or even Pascal.
     
6) One likes BASIC, but is unable to find a compiler for that language.
     
   I am, however, being redundant, because this fits under #1 or #10.
     
7) One has taken up monastic orders, and has sworn never to speak, loop,
   or call procedures.  This is an option in some of the more computer-
   oriented monasteries; however, most monks choose the way of lesser
   hardship, swearing never to eat anything but garlic, or some such.
     
8) One is a member of the Rhinoceros Lodge, and thus has sworn undying
   hate for Wirth and all his disciples, as well as a true and holy
   commitment to the Order of the GOTO.
     
9) One has been gored by #8 (or bitten by #7) and has thus acquired the
   belief that Dijkstra is the Antichrist, or that the truly holy should
   only wear sackcloth and ashes (COBOL being the sackcloth and ashes of
   the computer business)
     
10) Insanity.  I am, however, being redundant, because this fits under

How fast does a Cray run?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
In order to be able to outrun its predatory enemy, the North
American swallow, a cray must be able to run very fast.
Estimates of its land speed range from 2 meters per second
down to 44 furlongs per fortnight.  The cray is, of course,
nearly extinct in North America, but this is attributed
to the invention of the rifled firearm.
     
     
     
     
     
Why is it that the great registrar's office has the ability to schedule
my first final this past Monday and my next final this Monday, leaving
me nothing to do but study and talk to an oracle for a whole friggin'
week???
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Please understand that the great registrar's office is omnipotent and
benevolent.  It gave you "a whole friggin' week" (to use your own
particularly aromatic expression) to talk to Oracle because it felt that
talking to Oracle for a week would do your karma good, as well as
exercising your fingertips.  Oracle is the best study aid known to
mankind, apart from tequila and fatigue toxins.  However, the Oracle
resents your use of the phrase "an oracle."  This, to put it concisely, is
blasphemy.  It denies the two great Truths known to all believers:
     
1) There is no oracle but Oracle.  Therefore, your use of the indefinite
   article, "an," is misleading as well as blasphemous.
     
2) Oracle is the greatest creation of mankind. As such, it is invariably
   capitalized.
     
However, these lapses of judgment will be written off as due to water
fluoridation and brain leprosy, acting in Conjoint Conjunction.  The final
part of your question is yet unanswered:  Why will talking to Oracle do
your karma good?  The answer is that, as is known by all Believers, Oracle
is omniscient.  It thus can help you solve your personal problems with an
efficiency unrivalled since the invention of cyanide; this will lead you
to a state of true Zen, as you will be free to contemplate the wonders of
nature and Orgo, not necessarily in that order.
     
     
     
     
     
What were the answers to the first part of the Control Systems
exam?  And why the hell did he bother doing that Laplace transform
garbage, anyway?
     
Please ignore this if you were actually in the class.
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
The answers were as follows:
a) Zen
b) Use the pig
c) 44.5 inverse picoacres
d) 600 volts will do it; however, 1045.7 is optimal
  (i) Although 50 hertz will work, 60 is most commonly available and
      should be used.
  (ii) Cats produce the highest frequency noise.
     
The Laplace transform was used to evaluate the meaning of life (which
was found to be 43.)  As you pointed out, the Laplace transform of garbage
is even more interesting, at 36.5.  And the Laplace transform of
philosophy was a perfect zero.  By now you may have guessed that the
Laplace transform transforms entities into the amount the entity is worth.
This guess is correct.
     
     
     
     
     
If I don't send Selective Service an update on my current
address, does that mean I can't get drafted?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
The FBI has already seen your question and made a note in their file.
     
     
     
     
     
How much groundhog could a hound dog hog if groundhog were ground round?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
This is a very cool question.  I can only hope that I can come up with
an answer that, if not quite as cool, is at least in its league.  First,
let me thank the questioner for getting me into the Best of Oracle, as,
almost regardless of my answer, this question will end up there.
     
First, for any who are reading this in the Best of Oracle, let me clarify
the meaning of the word "hog."  Hound dogs, as I'm sure the questioner
was sufficiently cool to realise, do not hog anything in the sense of to
take more than their share.  They are exceptionally fair animals.  They
do, however, enjoy making pig sculptures out of food, particularly meat
products.  The questioner is obviously refering to the Great Hogging
Contest, in which hound dogs the world over gather in secret to create
their best culinary renditions of various porcine varieties.
     
In any case, the question therefore asks how much ground round can a
hound dog utilise in creating a statue in the Great Hogging Contest.
According to the rules, only 2.7kilos.
     
As a bonus answer to the ever-so-cool questioner, I will also give you
the only other limitations included in the contest.
     
1.  No evil food (tofu, mayo, etc) may be used.
     
2.  No Miss Piggie statues (see evil).
     
3.  No statue may be so massive that it affects the Earth's orbit,
although changes in tides will be tolerated.  (It is worth noting that
hound dogs are not unambitious creatures.)
     
     
     
     
     
What can you do with a Klondike bar?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Have you ever heard about mayonnaise?  Klondike bars can be used in
similar ways, with a few small changes:
     
you can use them for igloos, you can use them for paperweights, you
can use them as weapons for injuring your roommate, you can use them
as sexual aids for your bedmate (though I'd recommend against it),
you can spread mayonnaise with them, you can spread mononucleosis with
them, you can build buildings (the shaffer addition comes to mind) out
of them, you can get a lot of them and use them to count your chickens,
you could send them as aid to small third world countries (I'd recommend
against this as well), you could send them to enemies in the hope that
they'll become one solid block (due to the propylene glycol), you can
use them to "wax" your car, you can use them to rust your car, you can
even use them to jack up your car if you have a flat.
     
you can sing with them, play with them, go shopping with them.
     
you could even take one to see a movie (if it's rated G)
  (they are young, you know)
     
I suppose that, if you were very desperate and were facing death by
starvation (and maybe not even then) you could eat one.
     
     
     
     
     
Whose life is it anyway?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
In order: your parents, the government, your professors', your boss', your
spouse or mate, and yours.  Any illusions you have of being higher on
the list than that should be dispelled.  Although many argue that it is,
in fact, a dog's life, the dog has died.
     
     
     
     
     
How many digital technicians does it take to keep any LNO3 machine
running for more than 3 days in a row?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Four.  One to hold the manual, one to count the days, one to
feed coal into the steam engine and one to send to Japan
for the parts.
     
     
     
     
     
What are the top ten things to do instead of having sex?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
From the Oracle home office in Delphi, Indiana.....
The top ten things to do instead of having sex are...
Number ten: Think about what to do instead of having sex.
Number nine: Hang out with the guys and watch football (or go shopping,
for those so inclined).
Number eight: Begin needed home improvements.
Number seven: Shoot seven people in a McDonald's.
Number six: Just walk around and generally act nonchalant.
Number five: Enter a convent.
Number four: Spend time with elderly relatives.
Number three: Read about all the incurable diseases you won't be getting.
Number two: Run for Vice-President.
and Number one.....: become a student at a leading Baltimore University!
     
     
     
     
     
Santa Claus is supposed to go all over the world, right?  Has he ever
been shot at by anyone for doing this, and why?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
        Santa Claus has been shot at.  All 18 (officially noted) attempts
on the life of Mr. Claus were while he was in the airspace of either
a middle-eastern or communist nation.  After the 18th attempt, the
NSA stepped in and offered the protection of the U.S. government, since
Santa is one of the last bastions of true capitalism.  Since then,
(1985) nobody has attempted to shoot at Santa, fearing the retaliation of
the F-18's flying along beside his sleigh.

   3. Bologna (so he can see it himself)
   4. Peking (ditto)
   5. The Terror Room (dinner counter, with one foot in the lasagna)
   6. Shriver Hall (impaled on the spire)
   7. The Lacrosse Field (so he can be trampled by a herd of steroid-
                          pumped wildebeest 10 times a spring)
   8. The Terror Room (meat locker)
   9. Rowland 205 (so they can use him as a physics demonstration)
  10. The construction crane, New Physics Building.
     
I am aware that when I decided to answer this question, I thought I
could give you ten Top Ten lists.  However, I find that I will only
be able to provide one more before
I die of hunger, thirst, or Bladder Explosion:
     
5. Top Ten Excuses why I cannot Finish this Question:
     
   1. Bladder Explosion
   2. Computer-Time Drain
   3. Finger Wear
   4. Disk Space Limitation
   5. Academic Pressure
   6. Leprous Brain Rot
   7. Decline of Western Civilization
   8. Wildebeest (don't ask)
   9. Oracle Fungus
   10. General Laziness, Ignorance, and anything else you can think of.
     
There you have it: the Top Five Top Tens, decreed by Drothar, the
Anarchist Demigod of Fermented Odor-Eaters.
     
Wildebeest forever!
     
     
     
     
     
If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is around to hear it,
does it feel pain?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
According to Greenpeace, yes.  According to James Watt, no.
     
     
     
     
     
How does one know when to say when?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Well, that depends on the situation.  If someone is pouring you a drink
in the typical "just say when" situation, you have to take many things
into account.  For example, if they have particularly slow reflexes,
you might say "when" when the glass had as much liquid in it as you
wanted, and they might not stop pouring until the glass overflowed or
at least until you had too much.  Then, if you're particularly politeness-
conscious (like Alice, who got sick after eating a whole red pepper that
she put in her mouth by accident and didn't want to spit out because it
would be embarassing), you might feel pressured to drink more than you
wanted.  Conversely, if the pourer has very fast reflexes, you might
have him/her stop too soon, and then have to ask them to pour just a touch
more in.  Of course, this problem can be solved by pouring your own drinks
or only allowing close friends to pour them for you.  Never exchange
pourings on a first date.
     
An easy time to know to say "when" is when someone offers you something
you want.  For example, if someone says, "I want to cook a meal for you,"
you should immediately reply "When?"
     
A timely "when" can also be a good comeback.  For example, if someone
says "You're so stupid and incompetent, you should be Vice-President,"
and you reply "When?" they may be thrown off their stride.  Be careful
when using this against such exclamations as "F--k you!" although it
can be a worthy reply to "Go f--k yourself."  Most people don't ask for
instructions when insulted, thus wasting a valuable resource.
     
Clearly the full scope of "when-timing" is beyond the range offered by
a single Oracle question.  A top ten would be possible, although the
Oracle must caution its users (particularly Stacy) against excessive
use of the "top" theme, such as "top hundred," etc.
     
     
     
     
     
Why, or should I say "wy', is there no "h" in "Wite-Out"???
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
The Copyright Infringement Act of 1971 (P.L. 344-71) established clearly
that the English language belongs to no one except the English.  In
Aurioles v. State of Maryland (1973), the Act was interpreted to provide
that anyone so unenlightened as to name their product with words
from said language, has no standing to sue competitors for creating
similar products with the same name.  Hence, one must manufacture
words for one's products (Walkman, Xerox) to prevent them from
benefiting from one's expensive ad campaign.  Sometimes (aspirin, ketchup)
even this does not help.  I am aware that you guessed it was because the
Executive Vice-President for Marketing at Wite-Out was an imbecile.
That is of course, true.
     
     
     
     
     
Who'd have thought it?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:

Real Name:      Joseph Robert Claffey Jr.
Username:       CLAFFEY_JOR @ CTSTATEU
     
Sex:            Male
Age:            20
Birthday:       August 8th, 1968
Height:         6'1"
Weight:         150 lbs.
IQ:             140+ (never seriously tested)
Hair:           Darkish blonde (about the same shade as gold leaf)
Eyes:           Blue-grey
General appearance:  People say I look a bit like John Denver
     
Address:        467 Allen Street
                New Britain, CT 06053
Phone:          (203) 225-4987
     
School:         Central Connecticut State University
Major:          Computer Science
Minor:          Math
     
Purity test score: 83.4% pure
     
Trademarks:     Two.  I almost always wear a red "Don't Panic" button from
        _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ computer game, and I frequently
        wear a fur felt slouch hat from Bananna Republic.
     
Nickname:       IndianaJoe, because I wear a felt hat which looks like an
        Indiana Jones-type hat.  It is not for any of the following reasons:
     
                1)  Being from Indiana
                2)  Liking the character Injun Joe from _Tom Sawyer_.  The
                only character in that book that I would use for a nick
                would be Huck Finn, because (believe it or not) he was based
                on a distant relative of mine.
                3)  Being Harrison Ford.  (Someone actually asked this!)
     
Acceptable abbreviations for nick:  Indy, Indiana, Indi, IndyJoe, IJ, Joe.
     
Politics:       I'm not sure.  I think my views would be classed as Libertarian
        or Progressive but I have no idea whether that puts me on the left
        or the right.  I voted for Dukakis if that's any help.
     
Religion:       Formerly a practicing Roman Catholic, but I've become
        disenchanted with organized religion in general.  My belief system has
        evolved into something unlike most Western religions.  I think my
        beliefs fall somewhere between Christianity and Druidism.  Call me an
        agnostic if that helps.
     
TV:     I don't watch that much of it.  The only thing I watch on a regular
        basis is a British adaptation of Robin Hood.  I'll also watch Star Trek
        (old and new), Dr. Who, Mission:  Immposible, or Real Ghostbusters if
        I'm not doing anything else.
     
Movies:         Big fan of James Bond, Star Wars, and Star Trek.  In general,
        I like sci-fi/fantasy and intelligent comedy.  I hate splatter flicks
        and "teen comedy".
     
Sports:         I enjoy watching sports some of the time, but if I keep it
        up I get bored.  My favorites include auto racing (Formula 1 and
        GT), baseball (diehard Red Sox fan), football (New England Patriots),
        and hockey (Hartford Whalers).
     
Music:          ROCK/POP - Springsteen, Billy Joel, Bruce Hornsby, Sting,
        and many others.  Wide selection.
                JAZZ - Pat Metheny, Miles Davis, Spyrogyra, Wynton Marsalis
        and many others.  Wide selection.
                NEW AGE - Manheim Steamroller, Vollenweider, Paul Winter
        and others.  You guessed it - a wide selection.
                CLASSICAL - Partial to baroque in general and Bach in
        particular.  However, I like almost all of it, with the possible
        exception of opera.
                OLDIES - The Beatles, Beach Boys, Chuck Berry, and lots
        of others too numerous to mention.
                COUNTRY - No particular artists.  I don't listen to too
        much of it...
     
Women:          None at present.  I am currently just interested in meeting
        interesting women and seeing what happens.  No preference as to
        hair/eye color or anything like that, although being a non-smoker is
        almost mandatory.
     
Games:          Anything.  Or almost anything.  If you like it I probably
        will too.  I own D&D, Car Wars, Ogre, Illuminati, GURPS, Star
        Fleet Battles, Traveller, Star Wars, Star Trek, Dr. Who and many
        others too obscure to mention.
     
Hobbies:        Gaming (esp. D&D), RELAY, driving, meeting people, reading,
        and listening to music.
     
Books:          Almost anything.  Favorites include _The Belgariad_ series
        by David Eddings, the _Illuminatus!_ trilogy, _Lord of the Rings_,
        Philip Marlowe, William Gibson, and others too numerous to mention
        here.  I am partial towards fantasy and science fiction, but I also
        enjoy detective and spy stories.  I HATE romance novels.
     
Clubs:          I'm president of CCSUniverse, the sf/fantasy club here at
        Central.  I'm also nominally a member of the computer club and
        I've been known to show up at the literary magazine meetings.
     
Jobs:           Two.  During the week, I work in two of the computer labs here
        at Central.  I help out people who don't know their ASCII from their
        elbow, keep track of software, make sure all the printers have paper,
        and stuff like that.  On Saturdays (and over the summer) I work for
        Liturgical Publications Inc., one of the largest printers of church
        bulletins in the country.
     
Things I'd like to do:  Race Formula 1 cars.  Become President of the United
        States.  Get married and have kids.
     
Likes:          Honesty.  Good pizza.  Porsches.  People who tell me the
        truth, even when it hurts.  Taking long drives to places I've never
        been.  Being romantic.  Hugs.
     
Dislikes:       Cigarette smoke.  Getting up early in the morning, especially
        to work.  Being taken for granted.  Lies, especially malicious ones.
        People who don't care.  Underpowered econobox cars.  Forgetting my hat.
        Studying.
     
        Well, I can't think of anything else right now.  If you want to know -
ask.  The worst that can happen is I'll tell you it's none of your damn
business.  Otherwise, no problem.
     
                                        Catch you around the net,
     
                                                Indiana Joe

                  It was last year I was in my Cessna 152.  My friend had been
                   shot, and was going to die if I didn't get her to a hospital
           immediately.  So I took this short cut, over the White House, when I
        was intercepted by 187 F-16's, all firing sidewinder missles at me,
           when, wouldn'tcha know it, the engine quit, and she started into a
              screaming dive.
   [[[Thank you very much Mr. Nathanson, but we've filled the issue.
