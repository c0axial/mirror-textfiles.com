Hi!
        Bl00p to all, and all that rot. ;^)
        In case you are wondering why this is the Pirated Issue, it is because
I, Patrick Salsbury, a.k.a. DangerM00se, a.k.a. WarM00se, have taken over the
editorship of this here fine newsletter! It all began a week or so back, when I
got this letter in the mail.
        Oh! I remember it so clearly! I was sitting with RiffM00se on some
throw-pillows in my apartment, madly trying to learn how to play ILLUMINATI!, by
Steve Jackson Games, when this message appeared on my screen....

Pat, let's say you happened to gain control of the most powerful literary
propaganda newsletter in the world.  One that, theoretically, was mailed out
to a bunch of people on BITNET once a week.  How good a job do you think you

        What with the new location of M.D. Headquarters being in the lo-cal
(diet permeates all of our society nowadays) of the UB GIGATHR0NG at the State
University of NY at Buffalo, and seeing as I am the Bull M00se and FOUNDER of
the UB *GIGA*THR0NG, and as *I* was the one who BROUGHT the word of THE GLORIOUS
M00SE ILLUMINATI to ALL of the MILLIONS OF CHEERING MINIONS in **BUFFALO, NY**
...Ahem...Megalomania check!...Ah! That's better! :)  Where was I? Oh yes!
        Being as we are now in Buffalo, we are going to make production of M.D.
a group effort. (YOU HEAR THAT, GUYS? YOU'RE GONNA *HELP*! ;^)  ) Thereby, I
won't freak out of my gourd, and we may even actually get this beast up to a
weekly status!
        Right now, I'm taking submissions & such. My address is above. Darkling
M00se is going to handle the Chapter List. So any new chapters or changes should
be reported to him. His address is:

FLAG-BURNING!
        Yes, one of the other recent developments here at UB has been a VERY
active discussion of the new bill against flag-burning. We have been discussing
various means of protesting this bill. From an out-and-out burning, to the
wearing of the flag, draped around us like our President did when he visited the
flag factory while on the "Campaign Trail". This would be, in my opinion, more
in line with the goal of the M.I. of confusing everyone. People couldn't call us
un-American or non-patriotic, and they wouldn't really know how to react to a
flag-wearer! :)
        We are considering trying to make this a national event. Getting m00ses
and other similarly minded people (gak! are there OTHERS like us?) to organize
through the Net and all wear flags on their campuses on the same day. Maybe one
of our illustrious staff-reporters here at UB would like to make a report in the
next issue? [Captain Devious, perhaps?]  (That's a hint! :-)  )

        FLAG BURNING STATUS REPORT
 
The Flags:  We're getting a bunch of little paper flags from a party store
        to burn.  I'll find out how much they are, and whoever wants to can
        chip in.
 
The set-up:  I have yet to get in contact with the necessary groups.  I'm
        checking P.S. today or tomorrow, and I'm hoping that Thom will get
        me the list of possible groups together.
 
The date:  The protest date is tentatively set back to Friday, 11/10.
        The figuring is that a) more people will be in Founder's on friday, and
        b)  we probably won't get everything together till then.
 
The hype:  The press releases will be done by tomorrow.  Send out by this
        friday at the latest.  A copy will be posted here, on POLITICS, and
        wherever else i feel like putting them.  I need help with flyers.
 
The Group:  This demonstration will be the kick-off of a new organization,
        the Thousand Points of Light.  We will be a pro-rights discordian
        organization, affiliated with the Secret Society, and possibly the
        M-I, A.P.E., and the third church of Eris whatever. (guys, get
        back to me on this)
 
The network:  Kidd Vicious and the other S.S. members cross-country will be
        notified of these things, and great things will be afoot.  Whoever
        is in charge of the M-I network should disperse info quickly, also.
 
more later...

ANARCHY!
        We've been promoting anarchy here at UB, also. Having a nice, heated
debate on our POLITICS bulletin board. (And I think we are winning!) Here are
some things I posted:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The following is an excerpt from "Never Whistle While You're Pissing", by
Hagbard Celine, as quoted in "The ILLUMINATUS! Trilogy", by Robert Shea and
Robert Anton Wilson. (pp. 622-624)
 
 
                        DEFINITIONS AND DISTINCTIONS
 
        FREE MARKET: That condition of society in which all economic
transactions result from voluntary choice without coercion.
        THE STATE: That institution which interferes with the Free Market
through the direct exercise of coercion or the granting of privileges (backed by
coercion).
        TAX: That form of coercion or interference with the Free Market in which
the State collects tribute (the tax), allowing it to hire armed forces to
practice coercion in defense of privilege, and also to engage in such wars,
adventures, experiments, "reforms," etc., as it pleases, not at its own cost,
but at the cost of "its" subjects.
        PRIVILEGE: From the latin /privi/, private, and /lege/, law. An
advantage granted by the State and protected by its powers of coercion. A law
for private benefit.
        USURY: That form of privilege or interference with the Free Market in
which one State-supported group monopolizes the coinage and thereby takes
tribute (interest), direct or indirect, on all or most economic
transactions.
        LANDLORDISM: That form of privilege or interference with the Free Market
in which one State-supported group "owns" the land and thereby takes tribute
(rent) from those who live, work, or produce on the land.
        TARIFF: That form of privilege or interference with the Free Market in
which commodities produced outside the State are not allowed to compete equally
with those produced inside the State.
        CAPITALISM: That organization of society, incorporating elements of tax,
usury, landlordism, and tariff, which thus denies the Free Market while
pretending to exemplify it.
        CONSERVATISM: That school of capitalist philosophy which claims
allegiance to the Free Market while actually supporting usury, landlordism,
tariff, and sometimes taxation.
        LIBERALISM: That school of capitalist philosophy which attempts to
correct the injustices of capitalism by adding new laws to the existing laws.
Each time conservatives pass a law creating privilege, liberals pass another law
modifying privilege, leading conservatives to pass a more subtle law recreating
privilege, etc., until "everything not forbidden is compulsory" and "everything
not compulsory is forbidden."
        SOCIALISM: The attempted abolition of all privilege by restoring power
entirely to the coercive agent behind privilege, the State, thereby converting
capitalist oligarchy into Statist monopoly. Whitewashing a wall by painting it
black.
        ANARCHISM: That organization of society in which the Free Market
operates freely, without taxes, usury, landlordism, tariffs, or other forms of
coercion or privilege. RIGHT ANARCHISTS predict that in the Free Market people
would voluntarily choose to compete more often than to cooperate. LEFT
ANARCHISTS predict that in the Free Market people would voluntarily choose to
cooperate more often than to compete.

Description: RE: Anarchy Definitions
 
        And there you have the definition of anarchy that I work by. When you
look at it, it really isn't all that bad. Granted, we can't have it, given the
current mentality of our society, but that may change someday.
        As I typed that in, I realized something rather profound. TRUE
anarchists (not those fools who just go around spraypainting the "A"-in-a-circle
anarchy symbol on walls because it's a trendy thing to do) are Global Citizens.
They feel no fealty to any one nation, but rather think of all humans as equal.
(Unless, of course, they feel slightly smug about being intelligent enough not
to blindly follow a government like sheep. ;^)  ) They can think in terms of an
entire planet, whereas "subjects" are confined to thoughts of "us" and "them".
        What's more, the planet will never reach a state of true harmony with a
unified, planetary government while people cling to ideas of patriotism and
nationality. Therefore, I put forward the idea that TRUE anarchists are at a
level of maturity where they respect each person's individuality and rights,
and don't need the protective umbrella of a government to "keep them in line".
They have "grown up" and are capable of acting as adults should. Perhaps, as
I've hinted at, TRUE anarchy is somewhere down the road in the direction of
Global Citizenry, where people don't need rules telling them what they can and
cannot do, but they know how to "behave themselves" without threats of penalty.
If that is the case, then anarchists are the next stage in human evolution, and
are just a bit ahead of their time at the present.

| ALASKA PRESS INTERNATIONAL
|
| In a tragic accident at the Exxon corporate headquarters, the fish
| truck Prince William Express slammed into the side of the main
| building of the new corporate headquarters, spilling more than 20
| tons of dead herring, salmon, sea otters and various other wildlife
| onto the pristine lawn of the Exxon complex.
|
| Skipper Joe Woodhead was passed out in the sleeper compartment of the
| state-of-the art fish truck when the truck struck the clearly marked
| building. "Bobo", the skipper's dog, had the wheel at the time of the
| accident. Bobo, whose certification does not permit him to drive
| on planet earth, was unavailable for comment, and confirmed sources
| suggest he has a history of drug abuse.
|
| The skipper contends that he was not drunk at the time of the accident,
| but when he realized the seriousness of the spill he ran out to a
| local tavern and pounded down a half-dozen beers. Woodhead also
| contends that he told Bobo to give him a "Bud Light" not a "hard right."
|
| The President of Prince William Express Co. said that they would assume
| full responsibility for the spill and would submit a plan in about a
| month on the proposed clean-up procedure. He also stated that they
| ship over a million tons of seafood a year and that an accident like
| this is just the price we have to pay to eat fish.
|
| When asked about clean-up equipment for such a spill, company
| officials commented that a small pickup with a shovel in it was in
| Gopher Spits, Iowa, but had a flat tire and therefore would be unable
| to be dispatched to the scene.
|
| On the market side of things, fish prices will increase by 20% for all
| species.

Kinky lubricated leather studded necrophiliac fruitbats liberally
smeared with mashed potato and tomato sauce, marinated at gas mark 4 and
whipped severely with a rubber glove and a sticky thong that has been
used by a band of nubile young wood nymphs glistening wetly in pools of
sun drenched lubricant for purposes of extreme nymphomania with a group
of pleasantly inebriated (and therefore uninhibited) elves practicing
various forms of bondage hanging by thongs from a tree which is covered
with thrash marks from a well-worn riding crop that has seen better days
with more vital and effervescent water nymphs who alas perished one
midsummers morning in the throes of extreme pleasure after experimenting
wildly with a rubber hose and an air compressor that was covered with KY
jelly and many other strange liquids, some of which occur naturally and
others which were stolen by a helpful goblin from the local Tesco to pay
the aforementioned water nymphs for some rather personal services that
they rendered him one day and he doesn't really like to talk about,
although unbeknowst to him there are some photos of the said occasion
currently waiting to be collected in the local photo-processing shop
eagerly awaited by the water nymphs so they can get some more jelly, or
it would have been, if they hadn't all perished that midsummer morning
but luckily leaving the riding crop behind for the benefit of the wood
nymphs and the elves who are still drunken and are now entering a state
of complete uninhibitedness which has caused even the tree to shut his
eyes in shock which is unusual for a tree, as they are usually pretty
thick barked, except, perhaps, this one, which has had most of the
stuffing knocked out of it by the riding crop, which, although it has
seen better days, is still capable of a good thrash, even though one end
needs gluing and the other end is now angled at forty-five degrees, ie,
thoroughly bent, which is what the casual observer would think the elves
were, if he didn't look closely at the wood nymphs on the tree, who were
doing stunningly odd things with paper clips that occur naturally,
seeing wood nymphs don't get served in Tesco for reasons of hygiene, as
they tend to drip various sticky substances over the meat counter, which
doesn't really matter, except for the fact that species discrimination
is very upsetting to various kinky necrophiliac fruitbats who only
really want to be loved and played with very roughly with a riding crop.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
I do hereby pronounce Superguy Digest dead.  Dangerousman has destroyed
Washington, D.C., and with it all superheroes who were (A) at the convention,
and (B) had no means of escape or protection (in other words, if you want your
character to still be alive, make something up).
 
All characters who have fallen into disuse are, therefore, dead.  The only
surviving character I know of is Dangerousman.  The slate is clean.
 
I hereby announce the beginning of: SUPERGUY II -- THE NEXT SEMESTER.  If your
old character survived, start writing again.  If you have a new character,
start writing.  If you've never had a character, make one up and start writing.
Let's get this thing back off the ground.
 
Subscribers to this list will of course, be hearing the exploits of
Dangerousman, as he flees the government that created him for destroying their
home town.
 
But who else will be here?  Did Qwyntor throw up a force field?  Is the Awesome
Force still lurking around in western Connecticut?  What of Trash Man, The
Armadillo?  Will Superm00se join in the fun?  Is Flatphoot still alive?  How
about Punk With A Gun?  Did the Stealth Beetle protect him?  And what of
Dangerousman's fiancee, the lovely Relativity Woman?
 
And how about some new characters?
 
Let's all hope something's going on out there....
