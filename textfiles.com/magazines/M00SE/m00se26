  Greetings, as I sit here writing this editorial the alarm system here at
CTSTATEU has beeped 36443 times since Tuesday.  Having technical difficulties
all week long..arrrrrrrrrg!!!  Bet Batman wouldn't have to put up with this..
*grumble*..  Which, by the way, is what this editorial is really about.  Salmon
and I were wondering how many M00ses around the CT. area are interested in
having a M00sey get-together and see BATMAN.  If interested, send mail to
our Bitnet Addresses or call 224-7835.  We can figure out arrangements and such
then.

My fellow m00ses,
     
     Tomorrow, my brother (Scub) and I leave for England.  We will be there for
two weeks, doing field research for our book, _M00ses_Abroad_.  The work will
be very strenuous, and quite possibly dangerous, as there are many hostile
secret societies in Europe who would love to see the M00se Illuminati wiped
out.
     
     We will attempt to follow up on the translation of the Pnakotic
Manuscripts, which ended so tragically (as reported in M00se Dropping several
issues back).  In addition, we will be searching for the legendary M00sehenge--
the gigantic m00se shrine of which Stonehenge is rumoured to be a poor
imitation.
     
     As we may never meet again, I wish to impart some wisdom before I go.
However, I haven't got any.  So here is somebody else's:
     
       I admit that I ain't no angel, I admit that I ain't no saint
       I'm selfish and I'm cruel, but you're blind
       If I exorcise my devils, well my angels may leave too
       And when they leave, they're so hard to find
       So please call me baby, wherever you are
       It's too cold to be out walkin' the streets
       We do crazy things when we're wounded, everyone's been insane
       And I don't want you catchin' your death of cold out walkin' in the rain
     
                                                                -Tom Waits
     Of course, Tom Waits also said:
     
       Never trust a man in a blue trenchcoat,
       Never drive a car when you're dead.
     
     So maybe his wisdom isn't really worth that much.  So let's try Elvis
Costello, who said that America is "a trick they do with mirrors and with
chemicals."  Of course, Elm00se C0stell0 said it was "a trick they do with
m00ses and with assorted nutritious hostess products."  Which is true?  You
decide.  On June 10, when I return, if I return, I will attempt to bring a
Eurom00sean point of view with me, so that we may perhaps see things more
clearly.  Or less.  Whichever is more desirable.
     
     Fare thee well.  I hate being watched and monitored.  We can and will
police ourselves.

And now, the next installment of The Prophecies of the End of Time
by resident seer [read: Drunken Sot] Lord Trelf.
     
March:
     While roaming the countryside of England, a small schoolboy
     discovers the legendary sword Excalibur jutting out of a large stone.
     Within a week millions of people are arriving in England attempting
     to pull the sword from the stone and become King. Margaret Thatcher
     commits suicide after failing miserably to pull the sword from
     its resting place. Several professional wrestlers attempt, and
     fail. Finally, one man does succeed in freeing the sword:
     Richard Simmons. He declares himself King Richard of the
     Low BodyFat Content and declares England and the rest of Great
     Britain free of The Dark Queen's rule.
     
     Cher, The Dark Queen, refuses to recognize King Richard's claim,
     but does not wish to confront him immediately. Instead, she declares
     England a penal colony and begins to deport criminals, the insane,
     and elderly fat women to England.
     
     Japanese computer designers created the first voice-activated
     computer. The technology was stunning, but there were problems
     due to the fact that the computers refused to work if not spoken
     to in a polite, cultured tone. They absolutely refused to
     cooperate with most civil servants, university students, or
     office workers.
     
April:
     King Richard gladly accepts those sent to his Kinda' New England,
     and immediately begins to put them through extensive training
     programs. In four week's time he has them whipped into shape
     and forming a formidable army. It is suspected that he is
     planning to to someday openly face The Dark Queen in battle.
     
     Envoy Software has created a program which allows even the
     most surly of users to use Japan's voice-activated computer,
     The BabbleTalk 2000.
     
     Pork bellies have begun to slide down in the market following
     the accidental death of a five year old girl in Iowa. She fed
     some of the pork bellies to her pet pig, who then became enraged
     and chewed the girl to little tiny bits.
     
     New Zealand was over-run by armies of sheep, who slaughtered
     all humans on the small island and set up their own government.
     King Richard announced he planned to send an army to reclaim
     the province of Great Britain. It is rumored that The
     Dark Queen was behind the attack.
     
That is all for now. I, the Seer, Lord Trelf, shall bring you the
dark tiding of May and June in the next issue.

Here are the words to the song "Them M00se G00sers", as I mentioned in an
earlier post.  I taped it off the Dr. Demento show back in '82.
     
It's in 4.  Stomp on 1 and 3, clap on 2 and 4.
     
"Them M00se G00sers"
     
How 'bout them m00se g00sers, ain't them cl00se
Up in them b00ndocks, g00sin' them m00se

Then up to sn00ze g00sers, sneakin' through the w00ds
Pokin' them sn00zy m00se in they g00ds
     
How to be a m00se g00ser?  It'll turn ya puce!
Get your g00ser l00se and 'rouse a drowsy m00se!
     
(If you want to hear the tape, ask me and I can play it for ya.
I'm not sure on a few of the words, though.)

What's the chemical symbol for granola?  It must be an element, since
it's impossible to break down (especially with your teeth).
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Although granola does not break down with the teeth, it must be noted
that a megawatt CO2 laser will send little granola bits flying into the
nearest wall.  The chemical symbol for granola varies with the brand, and
is usually listed (as per federal laws) on the label.  The most common
formula is hexachlorodiphenylnitrotoluenatdekafluoromuraphosphobenzonitro-
chlorodipentaoxymegahydrousatamylpolypropoteflonatetriphosphopropylene.
Granola is best drank in a ten molar solution in milk.

What is the meaning of life?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
(editor's note--you really thought a lot on this one, didn't you?)
     
The meaning of life is not something that can be easily expressed
in words.  It must be experienced.  I suggest the following steps.
     
1.  Carve your initials in a large bowl of water.  This should
help you understand that life is a temporary, transient thing.
It should also give you a keen grasp on futility.
     
2.  Buy a Coke, or whatever soda you like, drink it, and then pretend
to continue drinking out of the can, even though there's nothing
left.  If you are convincing, you are (to everyone else) functionally
equivalent to a person actually drinking Coke, and thus, according
to many philosophers, you are actually drinking Coke.  This will either
make you realise how inane philosophers are or cause you to gain weight,
have lots of cavities, and disappear whenever not thinking, depending
on whether you fall for it.
     
3.  Think about what it would be like to be a vegetarian who only
ate meat.
     
4.  Repeat step 3, but this time pretend it's really deep instead of
just a stupid contradiction.  These steps will illustrate the fine
line between something meaningful and something you shouldn't waste
your time doing.  In this case it's the latter made meaningful by
your search for understanding.  At least it tries.
     
5.  Play Oracle some more.  This won't help you with the meaning of
life, but it will amuse Hal, especially if you put some thought into
your answers.  Or, dare I say it, your questions.
     
6.  send money to Chad.  This is very important.
     
7.  Repeat step 6, until poverty prevents you.  Then call Stacy.
     
8.  Go to a meeting of the Hopkins Christian Fellowship.  Or don't.
Personally, I wouldn't.  It's up to you.
     
9.  There is no step 9.  If you haven't got it by now, face it, you're
like all the rest of us.

Give 7 reasons why Steven Muller is REALLY resigning.
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
(drumroll.....................)
     
Reason no. 10:  There is NO reason no. 10 (hey, you only asked for
seven....)
     
for 9 and 8, see 10.
     
Reason no. 7:  Muller is actually an alien sent to Earth to learn about
Hofstra.  He just realised he's at the wrong school.
     
Reason no. 6:  His doctor told him he has to stay out of the sun, and
he doesn't want to disappoint his "tan-fans," so he's going into hiding.
     
Reason no. 5:  He's just going into hiding.
     
Reason no. 4:  Reagan created a huge deficit and left office...monkey
see, monkey do.
     
Reason no. 3:  He couldn't handle the guilt about APL.
     
REAL Reason no. 3:  (I mean, you weren't going to buy the guilt bit,
were you?)  He's tired of suffering biting sarcasm at the hands of
James Rosen.
     
Reason no. 2:  He secretly believes he's the descendant of Ludwar
Gassergeth, and wants to bring Frivenmirk back to its former days
of glory.
     
Reason no. 1:  He's a poofta.

A black cat crossed my path the other day. What shall I do?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
There are several possible courses of action that I, the inphallible
Oracle (that is NOT a spelling error) believe you are worthy of hearing.
     
1: Cross its path.  (the get-even method)
2: Cuss and spit.  (the get-mad method)
3: Take solace in the company of a member of the opposite sex (or the
member of a member of the opposite sex if you are of that bent)
    (the get-laid method)
4: Using time travel, erase the incident from your particular space-time
continuum by staying in bed that day.  For advice on how to accomplish this plea
se refer to #3.  (the get-back method)
5: Laugh it off!  These superstitions are silly. (the get-real method)
6: Pillowcase Nightshade painted whisper (the get-surreal method)
     
goodnight!

Does the Oracle Master ever need appeasing, and if so, where do we send
donations, virgins, and sacrifices?
     
The Oracle has answered your question as follows:
     
Yes, the Oracle Master has quite the bizarre taste for
bimbos and various buxom serving wenches.
     
All one needs to do is take them into Rowland 205 and
throw them over the railing while chanting,
     
                        "ooooh oooooh  Muller mania."
