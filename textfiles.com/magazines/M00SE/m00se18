     Welcome to Issue #18.  A word of wisdom to you all:  Do NOT spill apple
cider in your computer keyboard.  It requires heavy cleaning.
     It appears that the Anachronist's LISTSERV command works, from what
I hear you all received your copies of issue #17.  It wasn't a month late,
incidentally;  I marked the date wrong.
     To lessen the load on BITNET, I am attempting to get a list at YALEVM
to take care of half the chapters;  there is a possibility that Kamikaze
will be able to get one at Villanova as well.  There won't be any major
changes, however;  at most, a change in the list you receive your issues
from.
     Without further ado, on with the issue.

Bill,
 
        Markus and I were driving north on highway 301, just north
of the Nice Bridge in Maryland... and we saw a M00se l0dge... is it
ours??? We bl00ped to it just in case!!!
 
                                Glad to see all the chapters adding up!
 
                                                BL00P!

Fellow M00sers:
 
     It has come to my attention that there are not enough m00se thr0ng-a-
th0ns, due to the locale of many of the m00se chapters, and the funds
accessable to the conspiracy group. So, I would like to enter a proposal for a
m00se throng-a-thon here in Fayetteville, Arkansas, or any surrounding area in
Ark, OK, or TX for the Christmas holidays. It is expected that all the
followers of the UAFSYSB HABiT thr0ng (which can be a lot at times) will
attend, or as many as we can send. I hope that this is somehow accepted by some
of the chapters around the surrounding area, and that we can get this thing off
the ground. If not, Oh Well, I guess we will just have to have the usual
Christmas. Here in Arkansas, we have a lot of things to offer.

<< More Beez Babble >>
 
I think we should make it a law that we remain M00ses and never change to
something like Buffal0s. I know this sounds unimportant, but with the
rising p0wer of the Superthrong, it may be dangerous!
 
As of yet there are is only one other member of the Suave ladies men in
dry clothing and I haven't heard from her in months. This trend towards
men being wet and macho scares me since it was Manly men in wet clothing
which brought about such things as: the Reagan Administration, New York
Yankees, The Bay City Rollers and sweat.
 
Are you aware of the song by Queen called M00setafa? Its on the Jazz album
and is required listening.
 
Just remember what Nietchze (sp!) said about Love:
        Love is riding through the Siberian tundra and having
        your snowmobile tip over. At night the ice weasels come.
 
Which again reminds me that the big thing in my Bud House now is ice weasels.
They are cousins of Otter Pops except they don't come in various tasty flavors.
Not that this is really funny, but if something humorous does occur or I happen
to mention ice weasels over and over again, you know why.
 
As usual, anything I say can be distorted and/or published as you see fit since
if you didn't do it, the sys progs who read everyones mail because they work for
big brother would read it (I know sucky sentence structure!) and would use it
against me in case I ran from President (not for, but from). Blah blah blah.
 
Tag! You are it!
