     Hello all!  Bl00p!  Welcome to Issue #19.  There is much discussion of the
coming MegaThr0ng-a-thon in this issue; it being important, I suggest you read
it and get back to me or the csbb.m00se discussion.
     Also, the list owner at Yale turned down my request to use his listserv
for Droppings distribution, so we're still working from one listserv only.  If
anyone can get a list elsewhere, please do!  We need to spread this thing out a
little.
     Lastly, the listserv does not like off-bitnet addresses.  The only
off-bitnet chapter it can send to is Larry at B.U.  So would those of you near
the other other-network chapters please continue to forward mail to them.
     Hmm.  That's it for this editorial.  On with the issue!

BTW: could you put a query in M00se Droppings about how many M00ses are on the
internet, and how many of them would like to expand operations to there?

On this Mega-Thr0ng-a-thon...
        I was recently in a Thr0ng of chapters from the Buffalo SUPER THR0NG,
(about 6 of us), and one of the m00ses sugeested holding either THE M-T-a-T, or
at least *A* M-T-a-T here in Buffalo, as we have almost 20 chapters right here.
        What say? Anyone interested?

Hey!  Help!
 
What about us lower-in-the-corner-on-in-the-out-of-the-way people?  There are a
lot of m00se fans here, a lot that don't have id's that would like to
participate in this M-T-a-T.  I just cant lift off and fly to Buffalo.  I know
there are a lot of chapters there, but I think you could get a better
participation if you hold it closer to the middle of the US.  Like Indiana for
instance.  You could get all us Southerners (AR,OK,TX,MO) ppl along with
yourselves.  I think the event is cool and everything, but I think we should
pick a spot that will have more participation than Buffalo.

C'mon David, what about us in the north and west?  The Alaska thr0ng?  We've
pretty much resigned ourselves to not going, because even if you guys held it
in Seattle, it would still cost us a grand to get there and back.

Right on, I mean, what *true* m00se is going to want to trek *all the way to
CT*?  And when we all get there?  Have you people looked at a map lately?  CT is
small...we'd never fit all the chapters in the state without destroying it in
the process.  So, I propose we hold the Thr0ng-a-Thon in a nice, big state with
plently of wide open spaces.  It's winter, the farmers aren't using their wheat
fields for anything, we can just move in and take over.  Just think, Washington
State's Whitman County (the proposed site) is probably bigger than the *entire*
state of CT, and Washington has *plently* of counties to chose from.
 
So, what do you say?  Give chilly Pullman, Wa a try, it's not quite the last
place on Earth, but darn close!

Greetings all,
 
CT might be small...It might be only a two hour drive from one end to the other
but..but Washington is dullsville USA ( ;^) sorry bard )...
 
We of the Central CT State U thr0ng support our state..( 'Oh connecticut ...

Connecticut: If you can't spell it FAKE IT!
Bigger isn't nessarily better..
Its not the size that counts..

Reasons to have it in Buffal0:
 
 1) Largest thr0ng in the world is in Buffal0
 2) It's not in the east, not in the south, and not in Alaska.
 3) It's near canada
 4) I have a m00se(made by Gund)
 5) I said so!
 6) I'm too poor to travel south
 7) I'm too tired to find Connecticut
 8) I'm employed and can't leave my job to go Bl00p!(unreasonable of them, isn't
    it?)
 9) It's near Niagara Falls
10) It's near my house(this is NOT an invitation to use my house!!!!!!)
11) It's near sibericuse
12) It's near Lake Erie and Lake Ontario
13) Most of you have never been to Buffal0
14) If the buffal0 thr0ng fails to attend, 1/5 of all m00ses wouldn't make it.
15) It's cheaper than going to Alaska.
 
That concludes my list of 15 reasons to have it here.
Well, I hope you all have a m00sey day.....Bl00p!
 
aloha.

     I have a solution.  How about all m00ses having their own parties,
inviting those chapters and thr0ngs in the area to a common place, and hold all
these thr0ng-a-thons at the same moment, maybe even sending out updates via
this very conference to all m00ses nationwide?  That way, no one place has to
be picked.  Sort of like a major national m00se convention day, eh?  We just
have to pick a time and date, that way!

Like Thr0ng-a-th0n day idea.  Maybe the day Bush is sworn in, to add to the
confusion...??  Seems to be the best compromise among the much divided m00ses.

   I like the idea of simultaneous M00se-a-th0ns in varying parts of the
country.  Obviously a single location is going to be inaccessible to many, if
not most m00ses.  In addition to the possibility of phone communications
between the gatherings, may I suggest that one m00se at each Thr0nging place be
appointed official PhotoM00se?  The idea would be for everyone at each
Thr0ng-a-th0n to chip in to cover the costs of film and processing; then the
prints could be snail-mailed around to all the m00se chapters, preferably with
the photos labeled.
   Another possibility for a Grand Thr0ng-a-th0n would be to hold it in
conjunction with the annual bizarreness known as NetCon(tm).  No, I don't know
yet where next May's edition of NetCon(tm) will be held, but I suspect it will
be somewhere on the east coast.

<< In response to the above.. >>
 
Hey, that sounds like a great idea!  One question, though... Would people
want colour photos or black & white?  Some of the advantages of B&W are:
 
    1)  If any m00ses have the facilities, prints could be developed
        cheaper than sending them away.  (Many schools have darkrooms
        which students can use.)
 
    2)  We could make the prints bigger, (say, 8x10,) and make duplicates
        of only the ones we want to send out.

<< Well, there you have it.  Personally, I support the many thr0ng-a-thons at
   once idea, and I think the photos are an excellent idea.  However, the cost
   of 130 or so copies of as many sets of pictures as there are parties would be
   prohibitive, so I suggest that only a large group shot of each thr0ng-a-thon
   be distributed to all the m00ses.  If anybody wants more pictures than that,
   they can send money to the photographer.  That way, each party can buy the
   film, and each chapter can put in enough money for one large print from each
   thr0ng-a-thon.
     All that remains, then, unless there is strong objection to this idea, is
   to arrange a time and date for the parties.  Since we want them to happen at
   the same time, of course, we must account for time zones.  We shall continue
   this discussion on CSBB.M00se. >>

<< A suggestion from GypsyLynx >>
 
     Why can't we have a M00se Day?  I mean, really -- isn't it more than a
little ridiculous to have a day for Turkeys and not for the majestic m00se??
Let's hear it for staring our own M00se day and turning it into a national
