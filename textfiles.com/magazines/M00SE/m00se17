     Greetings once again, fellow m00ses!  First of all, I would like to
announce a wonderful and truly m00sey event: RED ROCK MUD PUDDLE is our 100th
chapter!  This means we can begin discussing the Megathr0ng-a-thon that we've
been waiting for!  See EVENTS for details...
     I would like to suggest, once more, a way to get to know our fellow
m00ses.  I made this suggestion over the summer, and only one person answered.
I would like to start at the top of the m00se list, and print a brief ID file
about a m00se each month.  Your standard BITNET ID will do, though if it's
longer than 25-30 lines it should be cut down to there.  This way, we'll learn
who we're associating with.  Those of you who don't know what an ID file is
will get the idea pretty quick.  Anyway, unless there is violent opposition to
this idea, I'm going to start it next issue.  That means YOU, G00se, get the
honor of going first!  If you don't want to, let me know ASAP and I'll move
down the list.
     Also, election time is coming.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I
refuse to vote for Bush or Dukakis.  If any of you feel the same way, and were
planning on not voting, or on writing someone in, may I suggest you vote for
Ron Paul, the libertarian candidate?  He stands no chance of winning, but if
enough people vote for him, maybe the percentage of the popular vote he gets
will say something about what we thought of the choices this year.
     Lastly, some people have been asking about the new distribution via
LISTSERV.  To clarify:  You *do not* need to subscribe to the LISTSERV. The
Anachronist will simply send the server a list of all people to forward
droppings to each week, and it will take care of the rest.
     Anyway, on with the issue....

******************************* EVENTS AND NEWS ********************************

     It's time to start planning the Megathr0ng-a-thon!  Here's what we need:
A place that can handle a large number of weird people.  I don't know how many
m00ses will be able to make it, but I suspect it will be rather a lot.  We're
not exactly swimming in moolah down here, so renting a convention center is out
of the question.  It also looks like it will be a winter event, so camping is
probably out.  If we hold it here in or near Hartford, I can provide a list of
hotels and rates for people, but I'd like to hear other suggestions first.
     The other major consideration is when.  If we hold it here, I'm going to
try to get it to coincide with Hartford's Winterfest, which should be lots of
fun (especially if there's snow on the ground!)  MAYBE we could hold it during
winter break....
     Anyway, let's start talking about this!  Send discussion on this matter to
CSBB.M00SE, our CSNEWS discussion list, so that we can carry this on faster.
Those of you not subscribed, even those at the Wesleyan thr0ng who couldn't
sign up before, try again.  Supposedly it has been fixed, so that off-BITNET
people can subscribe.  Send the following command to CSNEWS@MAINE:
 
                CSBB SUBSCRIBE M00SE CSNOTICE
 
     I don't recall if this is supposed to go in the subject line or the main
text of a letter, so try putting it in both places to be safe.  All important
discussion on this matter will be reprinted in M00se Droppings for those who
can't subscribe.
                                    Until later,
 
                                        Pickle.

<< Although he hasn't an episode for us this week, CHAOS Engineer has plans. >>
 
Greetings gentle readers,
 
        Although there is scheduled to be an episode of Superm00se this issue,
due the combination of writer's block and one and one-half tons of mindless
acadamia to deal with, it won't be ready till next week.
 
        Also, M00se Wolverine of the Lansing thr0ng has requested a guest shot
in the upcoming episode.  If there are any other m00ses out there who would
like a cameo appearance in a future episode of Superm00se contact me.
 
        Coming next week, Superm00se joins forces with the League of Super
Veggies to battle the Velta Vermin(!!!)
 
                                                CHAOS Engineer
                                                (JBANKERT@SUNRISE.BITNET)

     A matter of much concern is upon us.  You may recall that Sabre has
disappeared.  Sabre is a member of the Boston U thr0ng, but he originally came
from the Maine thr0ng.  Unofficial sightings abound, but we still don't know
where he is.
     This week, the Maine thr0ng was all but wiped out.  Rainmaker is all that
remains.  According to the mainframe there, the rest of the m00ses' accounts do
not exist.  Something is killing the m00ses.  It begins in issue #17....where
will it end?  We must do something about this.  Anybody with information,
please help.
