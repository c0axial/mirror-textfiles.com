Woof Woof Woof! Hello! My name is Raggs! (If you don't understand that, see
"Sleeper", by Woody Allen (c) 1972 or -3)
        Yes, it's another one of those damned...uh...I mean...WUNNERFUL issues
of M00se Droppings come to clutter up your mailboxes and directories!
        As to the "Pointyness" of this issue...I was just browsing through issue
23 of M.D. this morning, and I stumbled across the Steve Martin poem, "The
Pointy Birds."
                The Pointy Birds are pointy, pointy.
                They annoint my head, annointy, 'nointy.
        I thought this was AMAZINGLY funny, and thought I should re-share it
with all of you.

A SMILE costs nothing, but gives much.  It enriches those who receive,
without making poorer those who give.  it takes but a moment, but the
memory of it sometimes lasts forever.  None is so rich or mighty that
he can get along without it, and none is so poor but that he can be made
rich by it.  A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters good will
in business, and is the countersign of friendship.  It brings rest to the
weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and it is nature's
best antidote for trouble.  Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or
stolen, for it is something that is of no value to anyone until it is given
away.  Some people are too tired to give you a smile.  Give them one of
yours, as none needs a smile so much as he who has no more to give.

        Imagine you are a poor seafaring lobster who can't quite afford to
book passage aboard the Queen Mary (is that still running???). So, quite
naturally (literally quite naturally), you begin to swim from point a to
point b, both point a and point b being basically water somewhere, which
looks like water everywhere, except for water at toxic waste sites, or
somesuch. Anyhow, as you relax, working out, doing the backstroke, you
realize that there is a vast net around you. Suddenly you are pulled into
a boat very unlike the Queen Mary, and soon find yourself on ice. In
handcuffs. Upon waking up, you learn that you are either still in handcuffs,
or else you are suddenly performing Houdini's last trick.
        Where to from there????? At last we find out. Some 200+ lb. woman who
speaks no decipherable language(at least not decipherable to lobsters)decides
you'd look better in her home than in a store. She neglects to mention that
the invitation to dinner involves you as the main course. you realize that
when she holds you over her cauldron of boiling water and threatens to
make you into a chameleon: you will turn a very unnatural shade of red.
        Well, now is the time to stop this torture of poor harmless sea
creatures! join the Lobster Liberation League (LLL)! Now! That's right!
what could be a more joyful sight than 30 lobsters trotting happily out
the automatic doors of your local supermarket? Hobbling out the doors of
your  local fish markets(is that the right word???), claw in claw,
crying "free at last!", or at least its nearest lobsterian equivalent.
The time for action is NOW!!!!
                                        brought to you by the LLL
                                        goodbye and hello as always,

Hi there!  It's the Pompous Critic once again, telling you who and what to like
if you want to be a hip art snob.  Remember, if I don't say it's good, it's
not, no matter how much you like it!
 
Today I'm going to review the David Byrne concert that took place at the Palace
Theatre in New Haven, CT on November 4.  Byrne, as those of you with brains
instead of squid in your heads will know, is the singer and songwriter for
Talking Heads.  He has a new solo album out, with a latin feel to it --
inspired by the song "Mr. Jones," which was on the last Heads album, _Naked_.
 
Byrne isn't alone on this tour.  Your Pompous Critic counted fourteen people on
the stage at one time, including seven men playing brass instruments of one
kind or another, four percussionists, a keyboardist, a female backup singer
(who sang a couple of songs herself as well), and Byrne.  The guys on the horns
took turns playing a spare keyboard, playing some spare percussion, dancing,
and singing backup as well.
 
The concert basically consisted of the songs on Byrne's new album, _Rei_Momo_,
plus "Mr. Jones" and a song from the Jonathon Demme film, _Something_Wild_.
That song is one of the extra tracks on the Compact Disc version of the album.
In addition, for the second encore, Byrne played "Papa Legba" from his own
film, _True_Stories_.
 
The band looked great.  They were all in solid white, they were all enjoying
themselves immensely, and they were all *moving*, whenever they didn't have to
stand still to play.  The seven guys in back had choreographed little movements
to each song, and were obviously having a ball.  Byrne, even though he looks
like Norman Bates and sweats like a pig, could get an award for the Person Who
Enjoys Himself The Most On Stage.  He was constantly dancing around, by himself
or with his backup singer.  He suggested we all dance as well, with the warning
that "state regulations require that the aisles be kept clear, but there's no
aisles in the middle."  The energy they put out to the audience was wonderful.
 
So how was the music?  Well, let me put it this way:
 
There were only two flaws with the entire concert.  The first, more mild one
was when Byrne fumbled a drum he was picking up and had to chase it a bit,
causing him to get back to the microphone in the middle of a line he was
supposed to be singing.  He was clearly disturbed by this, but the audience
forgave him instantly, and he relaxed again.
 
The second was that there *was* no room to dance.  The music was so
entertaining, so successfully performed that it was impossible to sit still.
Even the older fogies I saw were moving around, and many of the Yalies were
doing their best to dance in the four inches they had between their own seats
and the seats in front of them.  "Mr. Jones" in particular, good as it was,
would have been infinitely better in an outdoor theatre with a green for
everybody to dance on.  It was a bit frustrating, getting all that energy from
Byrne and his band, and not having much outlet for it.
 
All in all, it was well worth the money.  It was even worth the money that
Jethro Tull, four days before, wasn't worth; so I kind of felt as if New Haven
had made it up to me.  Byrne was friendly, unpretentious, and entirely
entertaining.  The Pompous Critic says "go see it or be hopelessly crass and
inadequately tasteful."

                     The Armadillo -- Chapter Two
                             by Lord Trelf
 
     As you remember, the dame was just about to tell The Armadillo why she
needed help when an explosion ripped through the room.  The concussive blast
came from the direction of the window behind The Armadillo, pushing him
forward and onto the dame, knocking her to the floor.  The fact that he
landed on top of her [after all, what good flatfoot wouldn't be on top
of...oh never mind] and the sheer invulnerability of his Armadillo Armor
was what saved them both.
     As the smoke cleared, The Armadillo picked himself up, brushed the loose
debris and dust from his trench coat, and helped the dame up to her feet.
     "Well, that certainly was an adventure, now wasn't it?" he said.
     The dame gave him a weird look.
     And Hollywood sued the author for stealing lines from "The Princess Bride".
     Or at least they would, but they won't ever read this, so screw 'em.
     "What was that?" the dame breathed, frightened and shocked and confused.
     "I don't know, but I'm gonna' find out, shweetheart," The Armadillo said.
     Moving toward the window, he looked out to see a black sedan parked at
the curb, and a man in a three piece suit get in.  The Armadillo pulled
out his revolver with surprising speed for an armadillo and took a few shots
at the sedan before it drove off.  The car sped of down the street.
     "Damn," The Armadillo said.  "I'll get those sons-a-bitches."
     "My God!" said the dame, who looked out the window just as the man
got into the car. "I know that person! Those are the guys trying to kill
me!"
     The Armadillo turned to her. "Oh really?  Who are they and why would the
be wanting to kill you?"
     They were just a coupla' fellas workingfor the mafia until recently.
They want me 'cause I'm the only one who knows about their new boss."
     "Who is this mysterious new boss that they wanna kill you 'cause you
know him?" The Armadillo asked.
     "You wouldn't believe me if I told you," the dame said.
     "Try me," The Armadillo said.
     "The ressurrected Al Capone," the dame said.
     "You're right," The Armadillo said, taking the bottle of bourbon out of his
pocket and taking a swig. "I don't believe you."
 
     On the other side of the city, a figure in a black tuxedo sat behind
a very large and opulent desk.  A knock sounded at the door.
     "YWho is it?" asked a very gruff Italian voice that sounded as if it
was being spoken through a voice synthesizer.
     "Duh, it's Lumpy, Boss."
     "C'mon in Lumpy."
     Lumpy walked in, stealing himself for the encounter.  He looked at the
man behind the desk, who's right profile was in view to Lumpy.  It was the
face of an average middle aged Italian-American, but slightly scared. However,
the scars were becoming to his features. Then he turned. Lumpy looked at the
other side of the man's face.  It was a robotic face: steel skin, mechanical
eye, the works. The voice was filtered through a synthesizer in the man's
throat, giving it a metallic edge. This side of the man's face always gave
Lumpy the willies.
     "Did you do as I instructed, Lumpy?" the man asked.
     "Duh, we tried boss, but it didn't work. We blew up his office like you
told us we should, but he survived. So did the broad." Lumpy said in a
terrified voice.
     "WHAT!?!??!?" roared the man.
     "I'm sorry boss. It's dat damn armor of his. It fucked us up."
     "DID I ASK YOU FOR EXCUSES?" roared the man.  He raised his left hand,
which was also robotic, and shot a laser beam at Lumpy, disintegrating him
instantly.  "Let that be a lesson to you," he said.
     Just then the phone rang. "Hello," the man said. "Al Capone here."
 
IS THIS REALLY AL CAPONE RESSURRECTED?
WHO RESSURRECTED HIM?
CAN THE ARMADILLO SURVIVE THAT LASER BEAM?
DOES THAT DAME HAVE A NAME?
IS ANYBODY READING THIS?

            Kitten With A Whip
            ==================
 
            Kitten with a whip,
            tail, swish swish,
            take what you will,
            get what you wish.
 
            Teddy bear in chains,
            spread on a bed;
            fantasy games,
            deep in your head.
 
            Puss in leather boots,
            rising thigh high;
            black rubber suits;
            making him cry.
 
            Squirm from the blows,
            writhe from the pain;
            but teddy bear knows,
            that he wants it again.
 
            Now pussy's all hot,
            from the power trip;
            ready or not,
            next swing's from the hip.
 
            Teddy bear sighs;
            kitty's on top;
            there's fire in her eyes,
            and the cat won't stop.
 
            The world explodes,
            her claws dig in;
            then kitty cat goes,
            cause she's through with him.
 
            Teddy's still tied;
            lying all alone;
            even if he tried,
            he couldn't go home.
 
            Kitten with a whip,
            tail, swish swish,
            take what you will,
            get what you wish.

                                Things III
A DEMONSTRATION TO THINGS POETRY
--------------------------------
     Many Hugenots and other 17th century Reformers have asked me, Slapgruck,
you are such a great poet.  Why don't you teach us the way?  To this I say this:
"Gnnnnnnnnnnnannnnnnnnnng!!" (For no other reason except I like holding down
turtles until they scream for yogurt).  I then say, I am neither Slapgruck nor
his evil Twin, Brucie, but I'll give you a primer.
     All is based on the following:
        Things are good.
        Things are bad.
        Things are great.
        Aren't you glad?
      Now, you try it.  I knew you could.
 
            DIALOUGE
---------------------------------
     Okay.  Here's the situation. My broccoli went away on a week's vacation.
That is the problem with being a Lenny Bruce fanatic, you get easily bowled
over.
 
        WHALE GEOMETRY
----------------------------------
     We can all benefit from the Society of Sophomores protecting Albatrosses
and Djibouti.  SOSPAAD, created in 1986, had no real pur- pose when created, but
even less after it disbanded in early 1987.
     After the fall of Southern Civilization (what am I referring to THIS time,
PAT 8) ), we lost all of our resourses of recourses. Of course, we can all find
the common cure to the common cold by isolating the common cause.  I have never
screamed at a grapefruit, but it's safer than burning a flag. But, wait . . .
 
THE SCREAMING AT GRAPEFRUIT AMENDMENT
-------------------------------------
     Yes, folks.  Just when you though it was safe to take out your frustrations
every morning, we are faced with this. What are we, as omnipotent, impotent,
non-potent, impatient, malevolent and malodorous pseudo-Americans, supposed to
do???
     Nothing, of course.  That's what they want.  Oh yes, I know their kind, the
non- grapefruit discriminants.  Why, their common denominator can cause quite an
infraction.

        ..."Gertie," he crooned...which is a strange thing to say to me, since
my name's not Gertie.  "Gertie my love, my potato salad, come go with me."
        Now, I'm not one to quibble over a silly little thing like a name,
Goddess knows....ask anyone who's called me Gertie.  They'll tell you the same.
So I looked into his eyes, like limpid pools of burning petroleum, and hollered,
"Yes, Marty my life, my splatball.  I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth, or
at least 'til next Tuesday."
        And so we went.  I'm not exactly sure *where* we went, but at least it
wasn't that dismal palace anymore.  That place can get dreary after a while.
'Specially with Stella moaning about the apples in her nostrils.  My, what a
wet blanket.  Definitely depressing.
        We hopped into Marty's helicopter, and drove off down the road.  It
really is a nice 'copter - all shiny chrome and gleaming glass and naugahide
interior.  Too bad for all those naugas, though.  Poor things.
        We bumped along, never a care in the world, until suddenly there was
this sickening thud.  Marty pulled over and got out to look at what we'd hit.
It was a narwhal, the poor thing.  Broke its horn clean off, and so it looked
just like a manatee.  A mortally injured manatee, granted, but a manatee
nonetheless.  We picked it up, beat it until it was totally and irretrievably
dead, and dumped it into the trunk.
                ("FOOT LOCKER!"   Shut up, Stella.  I'm telling this story.)
        A little while later, after Marty strapped on a parachute and bailed
out, mumbling something about forgetting to turn off the iron that morning,
I took the 'copter down to ground level, and had a look around.  Unfortunately,
I took it too far and ended up decapitating a whole schoolyard full of kids
with the 'copter blades.  Hey, when I goof, at least it's productive.
        I dragged myself out of the burning, twisted wreckage, only to find
that the trunk and a case of Chivas Regal had been thrown clear.  Being unable
to carry either one of them for any distance, what with the narwhal carcass
in the trunk and everything, I decided to make the best of a bad job and have
a party.  I opened the trunk, thinking to hack off a few narwhal steaks to
roast in the burning wreckage, only to find that the narwhal was gone and a
full array of Mary Kay cosmetics had appeared in its place.  (Yes, it was the
trunk from the living room.)
        Well.  If I couldn't barbecue narwhal, I'd have to make do as best I
could.  I searched around the carnage of the schoolyard for some tidbits, and
you know something?  Children wings basted with cold cream really does hit the
spot.  Especially when chased with a couple of bottles of Chivas.  Aaaaaaaah!
        Well, just about then, I heard the sound of windswept nylon, and Marty
landed square on my head.  Little darling - he's such a kidder.  He scrambled
off, hacking at the shroud lines with a bow saw, and screaming about spiders.
What a character.  I tried to follow him, but ended up getting lost among all
the ambulances which suddenly appeared.  All those pretty flashing lights.
Quite hypnotic.  I guess that's what first attracted me to Marty.  Ambulances
follow him, like sharks follow a whaling ship.  He really does lead an exciting
life.
 
Just your daily dose of wierdness....

                        LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
                                1989
 
Once upon a time the was a girl by the name of Little Red Riding Hood, who
was on her way to her Grandmother's house.  As she passed a large rock a
large bear jumped out and said "Red Riding Hood, The Big bad wolf is waiting
for you at your grandmother's house.  He said he's going to tie you down on
the bed, and screw your brains out!"  "No he won't," said Little Red Riding
Hood.  "I've got a gun, and if he tries that I'll blow him away!"  So off
goes Little Red Riding Hood down the road to Grandmother's house when she
is approached by a rabbit.  "Little Red Riding Hood, the Big bad wolf is
waiting for you at your Grandmother's house, He said he's going to tie you
down to the bed and screw your brains out!"  "I'm not worried Mr. Rabbit,
I've got a gun, and if he tries something, he's going to be in big trouble."
So off goes Red down the road and finally arriving at Grandmother's house.
As she walks through the front door the Big bad wolf jumps out and says,"AH HA,

_The Cat in the Hat_
by Dr. Seuss, 61 pages.  Beginner Books, $3.95
Reviewed by:  Josh LeBeau
 
The Cat in the Hat is a hard-hitting novel of prose and poetry in
which  the  author  re-examines [?] through the window  of  their
single-family dwelling.   In the foreground, a large tree/phallic
symbol  dances  wildly in the wind,  taunting  the  children  and
encouraging   them  to  succumb  to  the  sexual  yearnings  they
undoubtedly  feel  for each other.   Even to the  most  unlearned
reader, the blatant references to the incestuous relationship the
two  share  set the tone for Seuss' probing  examination  of  the
satisfaction  of primitive needs.   The Cat proceeds to charm the
wary  youths into engaging in what he so innocently refers to  as
"tricks."  At this point,  the fish, an obvious Christ figure who
represents  the prevailing Christian morality,  attempts to  warn
the children,  and thus,  in effect, warns all of humanity of the
dangers associated with the unleashing of the primal  urges.   In
response  to  this,  the  cat  proceeds to  balance  the  aquatic
naysayer on the end of his umbrella,  essentially  saying,  "Down
with morality; down with God!"
 
After  poohpoohing  the  righteous rantings  of  the  waterlogged
Christ figure,  the Cat begins to juggle several icons of Western
culture,  most  notably two books,  representing the Old and  New
Testaments,  and a saucer of lactal fluid, an ironic reference to
maternal  loss  the  two children experienced when  their  mother
abandoned  them "for the afternoon."  Our heroic Id adds to  this
bold gesture a rake and a toy man, and thus completes the Oedipal
triangle.
 
Later  in the novel,  Seuss introduces the  proverbial  Pandora's
box, a large red crate out of which the Id releases Thing One, or
Freud's concept of Ego, the division of the psyche that serves as
the conscious mediator between the person and reality,  and Thing
Two,  the Superego which functions to reward and punish through a
system of moral attitudes,  conscience,  and guilt.  Referring to
this box,  the Cat says,  "Now look at this trick.  Take a look!"
In this,  Dr. Seuss uses the children as a brilliant metaphor for
the reader, and asks the reader to re-examine his own inner self.
 
The children,  unable to control the Id,  Ego, and Superego allow
these  creatures  to  run free and mess up  the  house,  or  more
symbolically,  control their lives.  This rampage continues until
the fish, or Christ symbol, warns that the mother is returning to
reinstate the Oedipal triangle that existed before her abandonment
of  the children.   At this point,  Seuss introduces a many-armed
cleaning device which represents the psychoanalytic couch,  which
proceeds to put the two youngsters' lives back in order.
 
With  powerful  simplicity,  clarity,  and drama,  Seuss  reduces
Freud's concepts on the dynamics of the human psyche to an easily
understood  gesture.   Mr.  Seuss' poetry and choice of words  is
equally  impressive and serves as a splendid counterpart  to  his
bold  symbolism.   In all,  his writing style is quick and fluid,
making _The Cat in the Hat_ impossible to put down.   While  this
novel is 61 pages in length,  and one can read it in five minutes
or less,  it is not until after multiple readings that the genius
of this modern day master becomes apparent.

USERID:         MOOSE
HOME ADDRESS:   RD 1
                Harappa, ON
SCHOOL:         Drew University
CLASS:          1993
MAJOR:          Computer Science
NICKNAMES:      Mike (friends and family)
                Mr. Oose (zoo keepers, animal trainers, publishers clearing
                          house)
                Moose (close friends and mammals)
                Animal (those who have seen me eat)
                Communist Pig (those who don't like mooses)
                Dinner (hunters)
BIRTHDATE:      Sometime in the late 60's (what do you expect I was born in the
                woods).
RELIGION:       Mookerjian (I worship the confused moose god.)
POLITICS:       Anarchist
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION:
                Big, heavy, furry, big nose, two big antlers, a stylist tail,
                four long strong legs, two big brown eyes.  I don't wear
                glasses since they won't balance right on my nose, and besides
                contacts are much better for those rare moments I am being
                chased by hunters.
HOBBIES:        I like to write trashy romance novels (I am still working on
                the first one.)  I love to play practical jokes, and leave my
                friends weird mail.  I am also member of a semi-secret
                Illuminati orginization.  I also like to sleep, and sometimes
                chase rug rats.  Oh, eating, how could I ever forget that.  I
                love to eat line printer paper.  YUM!  I watch soap operas too.
                Playing dead at the side of a major highway is always fun.
READING:        I read a lot of nature books.  They remind me of home.  I also
                tend to spend a lot of time researching the great trash authors
                of this decade.  Romance novels are so educational.
MUSIC:          I'm a wilderness moose.  I love that hoof stomping country beat,
                and their wonderfully traditional "my dog died" lyrics.  They
                make me feel at home.  That doesn't make me stuff though.  On
                weekends I wear some fancy fur and slick back my antlers for
                a night at the clubs.  Such fun.  I am the life of the party
                there because I have more feet than anyone else there, and let
                me tell you what an added advantage a tail is at those places!
FAVORITE TV SHOW:  Bullwinkle.  (He's my hero.)
FAVORITE MOVIES: The Moose That Ate Everything, The Three Mooseketeers
THINGS THAT ANNOY ME:
                Moose Hunters, construction sites, forest fires, paper shortages
                Zoos, People trying to make cloth lines on my antlers.
LOVES:          The company of fellow mooses.  I'm all alone at the moment.
                ATTENTION FEMALE MOOSES:  SEND MAIL.
QUOTES:
        Mooooooooose.
