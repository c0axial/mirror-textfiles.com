        Well well well how very nice.  Issue 10 is now out.  And with it,
school has started again at nearly every college and university across the
nation, with the exception of UHa, due to management stupidity or something
like that.  So what does this mean?  It means that there are now thousands
of people on campuses, with bitnet access.  And guess what?  MANY OF THESE
PEOPLE AREN'T M00SES.  You may be aghast; I know I am.  It is our clear
duty to help these people by inviting them into our organization, unless,
of course, you don't want to.  And so begins THE ANNUAL FALL M00SE ILLUMINATI
MEMBERSHIP DRIVE.  Yes!  Convince your friends to be m00ses!  After all,
if we're going to confuse the population, there's no better way than to
get the population to help.
        On another note, I had an idea to fill up some space in this
newsletter.  Let me know what you think.  Each issue, starting at the top
of the general list and working our way down, we'll include a *short* ID-file
type thing in the issue from one m00se.  This will help us get to know those
m00ses we've never come into personal contact with, and perhaps make the
FBI's job a little easier if they're looking in.  Hi guys!  So, good idea,
or horrid?
        Later,
                                                -Pickle.

<< I mentioned in an earlier letter that James L. Anderson (Andersen?) was
not reachable.  Apparently there is a gateway to Fidonet.... >>
 
Actually, iif you have the mailer setup correct, you can send to
hogbbs.ffidonet.org... (damn keyboardbounces) and if not you could
try jla%hogbbs.fidonet.org@hcx.psu.edu or @psuhcx.bitnet
that is a valid address on theinternet.

<< Kamikaze is again hard at work on MDNET Mk II, a new distribution network
that will hopefully be more efficient and reliable.  This is what he needs,
respond to him or me.  Please talk with the other m00ses at your node, so
we don't get multiple volunteers.  It will make Kami's job that much easier
if we just get one "I'll do it" from each node. >>
 
Pickle-
 
What I need is a list of one person at each node who is willing to be a
distributor, both for within his/her/its node as well as forwarding copies
to other nodes, where needed.  In the case of single person nodes, I need to
know if that one person is willing/able to handle distributing to other nodes.
The network model I am planning on creating will run along the same lines as
how the Relay network runs, when it does.  Basically, each distributor will
send copies to all local users, any local nodes, and to the next major node
in the network.  It's not firm yet, as I haven't looked at the structure of
where we are all located from this angle.
 
this would be so nice if we had a member m00se at cunyvm....

"Papa was a rollin' stone
 Wherever he laid his hat was his home..."
 
     Yes folks, big news indeed.  In my never-ending search for that illusive
creature, "A Fruitful and Successful Life", I am moving on to Ithaca, NY.
I will be living with Karen and John Godfrey, and can be reached there.
As for the computer, I will have an account, but until I know what the userid
is, I can be reached at Karen and John's account: B45J@CRNLVAX5.  The move
will be taking place this Thursday, so after Wednesday afternoon, send any mail
to that account.  To all my friends in the New York area, I'm looking forward
to seeing all you guys and getting the chance to spend time with you, and to all
my friends here in the area, don't forget about me, because I will be in the
area periodically, and I want to keep in touch with all of you.  Here's how to
get in touch with me:
 
Mail:   Frank Orzechowicz
        170 Myers Road
        Lansing, NY 14882
 
Phone:  (607) 533-7786 [KEEP RUM]
 
Bitnet: for now, B45J@CRNLVAX5
 
 
     I'll be logged on days here at Villanova from now through 4 pm on Weds,
and can be reached here.  See you all around.
 
"These little town shoes
 are longing to stray
 I wanna' be a part of it

        We have none this issue.  I expect some for next issue, however.
And incidentally, for a possible later story, how many of you play Car Wars?
Get in touch with me if you do.....

Propaganda has become almost an art form in recent years. While looking
through a delightful book about people dressed in armor hacking eachother
to pieces, I came across a beautiful chunk of it preceding a war. It comes
in two parts:
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part I
 
A. We are so numerous that we are starving.
 
B. Therefore we must encourage still larger families so as to become yet
more numerous and starving.
 
C. When we are so numerous and starving as all that, obviously we shall
have a right to take other people's stores of seed. Besides, we shall by
then have a numerous and starving army.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
After part one has sunk in, and been employed, and the birth rate has been
trebled, whether anyone is actually starving or not, part two is begun:
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part II
 
A. We are more numerous than they are, therefore we have a right to their
mash (food).
 
B. They are more numerous than we are, therefore they are wickedly trying
to steal our mash.
 
C. We are a mighty race and have a natural right to subjugate their puny
one.
 
D. They are a mighty race and are unnaturally trying to subjugate our
inoffensive one.
 
E. We must attack them in self defense.
 
F. They are attacking us by defending themselves.
 
G. If we do not attack them today, they will attack us tomorrow.
 
H. In any case, we are not attacking them at all. We are offering them
incalculable benefits.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Kinda funny how it never sounds quite so ridiculous in real life.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*************** AND, OF COURSE, THE UBIQUITOUS M00SE LIST UPDATE **************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Please add:
 
Stony Brook thr0ng              FNORD        @ SBCCVM     Fnord
 
Washington State U. thr0ng      90289872     @ WSUVM1     Cthulhu
 
 
And make the following changes:
 
Wolverine's new address is B45J @ CORNELLA, not CRNLVAX5.  He is still part
of the Lansing thr0ng, however.
 
Which brings us to the other change.....Lansing is no longer the location
of a chapter, but a thr0ng.
