     So, here we are with Issue #12!  Things are progressing nicely in the
M00se Illuminati.  We continue to expand, some goals are being set, interesting
activities are being carried out.
     One thing you may be interested in is the description of CHAOS Engineering
in M00se.Info.  I intend to update the file a bit myself, and then anybody who
wants the new version can ask me for it.  If enough people want it, I'll just
send it out along the distribution net.
     Which brings us to the one problem we have.  Virtually nobody is answering
the question about distributors.  Once again, we need one person at each node
to distribute for that node, and we need to know if that person is also willing
to forward a copy to the next major server node in line.  We want answers from
those who are alone at a node;  even if you won't be distributing to others at
your own node, are you willing to send a copy along to the next node in line?
PLEASE get back to me on this ASAP, Kamikaze can't design a new MDNET without
this information.  Since the current one has holes in it, and some people may
not be getting their issues, we want to take care of this as soon as possible.

******************************* EVENTS AND NEWS ********************************
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     As I said above, the M00se Illuminati keeps growing.  And now the day is
in sight when we shall reach 100 network chapters.  I hereby suggest that when
we do, we have a Mega-Thr0ng-a-Thong at the University of Hartford, here in CT.
I will begin looking into hotels and campgrounds in the area, to get ideas of
prices in the area.  The Science Fiction Society here at UHa will reserve a
good-sized room for a day.  And when we reach 100 chapters, we'll start working
on an actual date.
     Whaddaya all think?

                          GOOD ENOUGH FOR JESUS
                          ---------------------
 
                Jesus is my guidance
                he tells me what is true
                he tells me what to think
                he tells me what to do
                he tells me what i'm hearing
                he tells me what i see
                and if it's good enough for Jesus,
                it's good enough for me.
 
                Jesus healed the faithful
                back in the Good Old Days.
                He didn't have to do surgery
                he didn't need X-rays
                and he didn't need to medicine
                to cure their infirmity
                and if faith-healing's good enough for Jesus
                it's good enough for me.
 
                Those Evil Pawns of Satan
                are publishing books of sin
                books like 'Stuart Little'
                and 'Huckelberry Finn'
                and so what if this is America
                so what if the press is free
                if censorship's good enough for Jesus
                it's good enough for me.
 
                That heretic Charles Darwin
                said Creation was just a fable
                he said we evolved from monkeys
                not from Adam, Eve, nor Abel
                and so what if Galton proved it,
                quite irrefutably
                if Creationism's good enough for Jesus
                it's good enough for me.
 
                A man called Galileo
                said the Earth goes 'round the Sun
                and the Earth is just a planet
                and not the only one
                and so what if Kepler proved it
                in the Seventeenth century
                if Geocentrism's good enough for Jesus
                it's good enough for me.
 
                Yes Jesus is our savior
                he showed us the way
                and now it's our duty to save you
                so you'd better do what we say
                and if you don't want to go along with it
                we have ways of forcing you to
                cause if it's good enough for Jesus
                it's good enough for you.

<< One of the new chapters, Larry Nathanson, had an interesting idea some
of you may wish to try out. >>
 
Oh, by the way,  The treasurer of this chapter, collected dues from the
Poobah, and Bull Moose, (who promptly wrote him checks) and convinced the
ATM to triple his account.  He thanks you dearly, and will refer the bank
manager to you, if problems arise. :-)

<< This note came from the CHAOS Engineer, giving a little bit of hope that
Sabre is still alive... >>
 
        Today I did sight the rare and Elusive m00se whom is called Sabre.
This was indeed a suprise, as he has been reputed to have been kidnapped
by the brotherhood of evil relayers.  This in fact is not true, as the straight
p00p from the m00se's mouth did indicate otherwise.  He has in fact been
enslaved by the Boston Univeristy Bookstore.  further sightings will be
reported.
