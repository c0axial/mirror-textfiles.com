Hello again! And welcome to Church Chat! (Oops! Wrong personality cartridge!
Sorry!)
        Hi! Happy December! I hope all you happy Turkey eaters in America
(Remember, this is a world-wide, globally conscious conspiracy group, and not
everyone celebrates Thanksgiving) had a good holiday, gorged yourselves silly,
etc. And are now all happy to get back and get your 'Droppings.
        One quick plug for what I feel is a pretty good cause:
                As the Christmas Holidays approach, remember those who DIDN'T
get to have a nice Thanksgiving Dinner, and probably won't have a good Christmas
or New Years, unless we help. Buy an inexpensive toy, (Or grab one of yours from
you room, I know *I'VE* got a bunch of old stuff! I'm a pack-rat! :)  ) and a
can or two of food, and donate them to a local charity. There are lots of
collection places springing up now, keep an eye out for them. After all, we are
supposed to confuse the masses, but we can also help out those who need it.
        EAT THE RICH! ;^)

Would you belive I had not one, but TWO Beez sightings last week??
 
What can this portend??   does it mean the end of the world??  does it
mean I've finally lost the last of my marbles and am hallucinating?
does it mean Elvis really IS alive?  does it mean that Sun workstations
really ARE possessed by the devil?????

  The Surgeon General's Report on AIDS
  (All Internal Destruction Subprograms)
 
 The Surgeon General's office report a computer virus of epidemic
 proportions growing in the computing community.  These viruses
 are deadly and there is no known single cure for all of the
 strains.  The virus attacks the comupter where it has the least
 defense: the operating system.  Then it slowly destroys the
 system by slowly eliminating small portions of data.  The
 original strain has been shown to be suppressed by the program
 AZT (Anti-Zealous program Terminator), but the product may be
 over-marketed, and lesss effective than promised.  Additional
 strains have shown little effect when exposed to this program.
 A virus may be contained in a disk or memory for long periods of
 time before showing any of the effects.  Some are time triggered
 to go off at certain times (Columbus day, Fri 13, Halloween,
 ect.)  but all viruses seem to have some effect on all of its
 victims.
 
 Some users and computers are at greater risk than others.  Those
 computers that communucate with their own kind (homocommunals)
 are the apparant target of many viruses, although the virus can
 be communicated to other computer types, as well.  Those
 computers using DOS seem to have the highest concentration of
 the virus, compared to non-DOS machines.  Data recovery experts
 are often exposed to viruses by accidentally putting their own
 disk into an infected computer, or having an infected disk used
 on their own systems.  These experts should take extreme care in
 workign in these environments so they will not contract the
 disease.  Virus hunters have much the same risk.
 
 The Surgeon General's office reccomends the following measures
 to the US Government and its citizens:
 
 1) Don't do DOS.  If you MUST dont share your disks, or at least
    use a cleansing program on those disks before using them.
 
 2) Do NOT copy programs from another computer, or if you must,
    try to only copy programs with another or a small, closed
    group that has been tested for the virus, and do NOT have it.
    There must be NO outside input into this group, or the whole
    group may be exposed.
 
 3) Avoid BBS's and Software pools known to carry illegal or high
    risk programs that have been uploaded and downloaded.
    Especially those that require payment for copy priviledges.
 
 4) Also, we should regulate and heavily test all Public Domain
    programs and distributors and recovery specialists for signs
    of the viruses.  These are especially at risk since they
    draw programs from those who don't know that they have the
    virus, or those that don't know that it is contageous.
 
 
 The Surgeon General's office feels that these precautions will
 curtail the spread and magnitude of the disease, if the public
 is willing to act now.  Soon, everybody in the nation will know
 someone with the virus, and you may have to work next to a
 computer that has it.

Description: what is a wilbury?
Submitted by RuprechtM00se <V067LUFD@UBVMSD>
(Originally From V201LRXA@UBVMS)
 
        the original wilburys were a stationary people who, realising that their
civilisation could not stand still forever, began to go for short walks - not
the "traveling" as we now know it, but certainly as far as the corner and back.
they must have taken to motion, in much the same way as penguins were at that
time taking to ledges, for the next we hear of them they were going out for the
day (often taking lunch or a picnic).
        later - we dont as yet know how MUCH later - some intrepid wilburys
began to go away for the weekend, leaving late friday and coming back sunday. it
was they who evolved simple rhythmic forms to describe their adventures.
 
        a remarkable sophisticated musical culture developed, considering there
were no managers or agents, and the further the wilburys traveled the more
adventurous their music became, and the more it was revered by the elders of
thetribe who believed it had the power to stave off madness, turn brunettes into
blondes and increase the size of their ears.
 
        but as the wilburys began to go further and further in their search for
musical inspiration they found themselves the object of interest among many
lessdeveloped species - night-club owners, tour operators and recording
executives.
        to the wilburys, who had only just learnt to cope with wives, roadies
and drummers, it was a blow from which many of them never recovered. they became
hairdressers or tv rental salespersons.
 
        but a tiny handful survived - the last of the traveling wilburys - and
the songs gathered here represent the popular laments, the epic and heroic
taleswhich characterise the apotheosis of the elusive wilbury sound. the message
of the music travels, as indeed they traveled and as i myself must travel for
further treatment. good listening, good night, and let thy wilbury done...

Here's a copy of the M00se Quiz and Its answers from somebody at Buffalo
The origional Quiz was deleted, This is the best I can do.
 
 
>1)  Do m00se ever wear red jackets ?
 
        Yes there are three times:
                a) They are waiters at a Chinese Restaurant
                b) They live in a specific area of Ellicott
                [Ed. note: UB has part of a housing complex (Ellicott) called
                        Red Jacket Quad  -Pat]
                c) They join the Shriners (Sit on a happy fez!)
                        -- that last comment applies to hats, not m00ses.
 
>2)  How would a m00se...
 
>       2a)    .....hot wire a car?
 
        The general m00se technique of car hotwiring does not actually
        involve the wires. Since any respectable m00se carries around
        a good assortment of Craftsman hand-tools, he simply uses a file
        to file down his antlers into a key shape. This key-template can
        be broken off and used as a key, or kept on the head, and copied
        at a local hardware store.
 
        The second method is preferable to m00ses, as it is becoming
        increasingly popular or m00ses to have sculpted antlers, and a
        good set of keys is as attractive as a good Michelangelo copy.
 
        If all else fails, m00ses have been known to hire anarchists to
        either hot wire it (using human methods), or blow it up (if it
        was a particularly hard job, wasting much good antler space.
 
>       2b)    ....Pick up a girl in a club?
 
        Very carefully. Antlers can be damaging.
 
>       2c)    .........climb an elevator shaft ?
 
        What a silly question! But in case it's not obvious to everyone:
 
        He would hire a union crew to tip the entire onto its side, thus
        creating a horizontal shaft. The m00se would gingerly walk up,
        being a relative term, the shaft until the desired floor is reached.
        The same union crew would then be re-hired to set the building up
        in the position it was originally in -- ie: standing up.
 
        Climbing down the shaft is a bit trickier, and involves very
        difficult quantum physics, the nature of which is proprietary,
        and therefore cannot be divulged.
 
>3)  When is it a good time to avoid m00ses ?
 
        After they've been climbing elevator shafts. (Do you know how much
        a union crew of building tippers costs these days??)
 
>4)  Can m00ses ever be charmed ?
 
        Yes. A good m00se costume of the opposite sex works, but is danger-
        ous without chain-mail underwear around male m00ses.
 
        Another good method is giving them a free building tipping certifi-
        cate, as the number of m00ses taking up this hobby is increasing
        daily.
 
>5)  What's the average speed of a running m00se?
 
        For an automatic m00se, about 600 rpm. That's the normal idle. With
        air conditioning, 750 is average. For manual m00ses, 500 with no A/C,
        650 with. These averages can be used for timing and tuning up.
 
        Actual speed of movement depends on the model. The older Bl00ick
        Electras average only 90 or so, while the latest Antler-gini can
        has been rumored to reach 200 miles an hour.
 
>6)  What do you do when a m00se wants to sell you a used car?
 
        First see if he has the proper license. There has been a rash of
        m00ses opening up used car lots without licenses, which is ironic,
        as a m00se's license to operate a car lot it much easier to get
        then a human's.
 
        If the m00se can produce the license, make sure he/she is a m00se.
        There are a bunch of unscrupulous humans out there wearing very
        convincing m00se costumes, just so they can get a m00se license,
        thus avoiding the necessary literacy and urine tests humans are
        subjected to. An easy way of doing this is to look at the antlers.
        A real m00se does not have mold seam lines, nor the words "MADE IN
        JAPAN" imprinted anywhere.
 
        If you can determine that the m00se has a legitimate license and
        is a real m00se, use the charming methods I outlined above to get
        the best deal possible. (I saved over $8,800 on a '53 Studebaker
        using this method.)
 
>7)  If a m00se is seen on a highway, what should a driver do?
 
        Pull off and take public transportation! M00ses are notoriously
        bad drivers -- they're much better at selling cars.
 
                                                BL00P!

Hey! I located an Oracle on USENET! I'm not sure if it's the same source as
previous Oracle stuff, but it's funny! :)
                                                        -Pat
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:
 
> O Oracle most Unburdened with Mortal Affairs!  Why is it, that no matter
> how hard you try, you can't bend a potato chip?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} Seeker, you are trying too hard.  You yourself must bend, like a blade
} of grass in the wind, before you can bend a potato chip.  You must spend
} long years learning to center yourself, learning to quiet the multitude
} of voices in your mind, learning to be calm, learning to walk across
} vast bonfires, learning to chew with your mouth closed, learning to
} levitate and fly.  Then, and only then, can you bend a potato chip.
}
} Or you could soak it in water for a day or two.
}
} -- the zen oracle

> What is the meaning of lif?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} Th meanin o lif i butterfl hoverin ove flowe.  Th meanin o lif i lov an
} ligh an happines.  Th meanin o lif i purit o spiri, an blessednes.  Th
} meanin o lif i lif.

> Why have I never read an Ernest Hemmingway book that I thought was very
> good with the possible exception of the "Old Man and the Sea."  Did he
> sell his soul to the devil as a claim to fame, or is it that I have no
> taste?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} Ernest Hemingway lived in a simpler time.  A time when men were men and
} women were women (except for Dorothy Parker, who was Marie of Romania,
} and Marilyn Monroe, who was an android from Mars, but it's basically
} accurate).  A time when what was important was deeds.  Deeds were
} important!  Leins were pretty important too, and certificates of title,
} but deeds were king.  So, anyways, Ernie wrote about deeds, but his
} editor said to him "Mr.  Hemingway, you have no head for real estate.",
} so he wrote about other things instead.  He also threatened to take
} several of the most important reviewers on drinking expeditions with him
} if they wrote bad reviews.
}
} He didn't sell his soul to the devil, although at one point he offered
} the devil Van Gogh's ear in exchange for a new typewriter.
}
} You owe the Oracle some AM radio jamming equipment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
> What are text editors made of?
 
And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
 
} It depends on the editor.  MacWrite is made from congealed sparrow farts
} woven together with absurdities.  Most editors running on IBM PCen under
} DOS are made of cholera and bubonic plague germs compounded with the
} smell of rancid butter and marsh gas.  Vi is made of the glint of
} moonlight on steel, the smell of violets, and the gurgle of a brook.
} Emacs is made from the glint of starlight on purest gold, the echo of
} distant thunder, the smell of a ``La Reine Victoria'' Bourbon rose, a
} reflection of a shy maiden's smile, and the taste of the best champagne.
