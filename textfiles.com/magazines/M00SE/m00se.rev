Hi all.  I'm still alive, more or less, and living in Ithaca.  I'm working
slowly on a M00se revival, but it'll take work.

But that's not what I'm writing about now.  I'm writing about four things.

1)  If anybody has the most recent version of the M00se files (three separate
files), please send them to me.  They disappeared in my travels.

2)  I'm working on a big petition to get Dave Barry's name on the 1992
presidential ballot.  I'm also going to send him a m00se shirt and a copy of
the charter.  If any of you can possibly spare the time, I'd love it if you'd
snail-mail your signatures to:  Bill Dickson, 102 N. Tioga 4th floor, Ithaca,
NY 14580.

3)  Again, I am looking for an editor to revive M00se Droppings.  Judging from
past experience, this person should be:  A college student, with some free
time, with unlimited time on the campus computer system ($50 funny money/week
just won't do the trick), and who can extract submissions from people with
decent regularity.

4)  Just trying to find out who's still out there!

Bl00p,

Bill Pickle M00se.
