 the issue, so don't  blame him for the  quality or  content of the submissions.
 Excepting those  he may have written  himself, the enclosed items do not in any

Editorial from Pickle:
 
        Hi m00ses!  Here we have issue two, which is not very large.  If
you would all make submissions it would be larger (obviously).  So let's
have those stories, party announcements, subversive plans, etc!
        As promised, in this issue we will discuss the distribution of the
newsletter.  A couple of ideas have been suggested, and they follow:
 
 
Letter from Kamikaze:
 
>Pickle:

>Hi there big kahuna!

>Got another thought for you to cut down on the number of copies sent.  With
>the relatively low number of nodes you have now, maybe what you might want to
>do is have distribution sites, rather than just nodes.  In other words, set
>things up something similar to the LISTSERV's that are all over the place.
>For example, you could send a copy to me, and then I would send to all others
>at the Villanova thr0ng, as well as the Haverford thr0ng, and the Bryn Mawr
>chapter, all of which are rather close to my node.  In this way, we could
>expand (as we know we will) in the number of nodes we are gathering at, without
>increasing the number of copies you yourself send out.  Once we start getting
>large enough, we can incorporate the one-receiver-per-site idea as well, so
>that I, as the, um, let's call it the Mid-East-Coast-and-any-parts-South
>distributer, would send to one person at the Haverford thr0ng, and let him/her
>get it to all the others there.  Sound good?  Let me know, I'd be happy to
>invest the time in deciphering the Bitnet mappings to figure out the best
>Bitnet-geographic places for distribution sites.

>Kamikaze/Rick
 
 
 And another from Sabre:
 
>     Dear m00ses,
>     If a simple bull m00se may make a suggestion...why don't we
>simply have all the m00ses subscribe to m00se csnotice?  I'm
>already posting the m00se droppings issues as fast as they come in
>here...if everyone subscribes to m00se csnotice, Great Herd Leader
>Pickle will only have to send each issue of m00se droppings to
>the csnews facility, and then all us m00ses can bl00p with
>delight as it is hand delivered by csnews to our own e-mail boxes.
>Furthermore, csnews will send it flat, in a protective brown
>wrapper...and if you subscribe now, you'll also recieve, at no
>extra charge, the Csnews useguide!  Put it proudly next to your
>relay useguide and the notices from your cs deparetment!
>     Also, consider the advantages to regestration with Csnews...
>after all, once there, you can sign up for any number of discussions--
>informative info on Comic books, Startrek, SCA, Audio Equipment,
>Computers, and so on....
>     For those of you who like to read stories...well, there's Sfstory,
>a little ditty I cowrite.  It's a very M00selike story, and once even
>included a talking m00se!
>                                                    bl00p forever,
>                                                     Sabrem00se
 
 
I think it would be easiest if we all subscribed to CSNEWS.  Then comes
a big question, though:  Do you want to continue to send me submissions,
and I'll compile M00se Droppings and post it to CSNEWS (thus using it merely
as a distribution method) or should we drop the newsletter format, and just
have everybody post to CSNEWS (thus using it as a listserv of sorts).  Let
me know what you think.  I suppose we could do both, posting to CSNEWS for
casual banter, and I'll compile fiction and things into M00se Droppings.
        Tell me what you think ASAP, and we'll try and reach a conclusion
before next friday.  And until then,
 
                                        Bl00p and farewell,
 
                                                Pickle

There is, however, a song, submitted by Sindex.  Author unknown, he got
it at a con some time ago.
 
 
                                   M00SE
 
                When I was a young man i used to like girls,
                   I fondled their curves and I patted their curls,
                But me girlfriend ran off with a salesman named Bruce,
                   You'd never get treatment like that from a M00se!
 
                Chorus:
                   So it's M00se, M00se, I like a M00se,
                   I've never 'ad anything quite like a M00se,
                   I've 'ad many women, my life has been loose,
                   But I've never 'ad anything quite like a M00se!
 
                Now when I'm in need of a very good lay,
                   I go to me closet and gets me some hay,
                I opens me window and spreads it around,
                   'Cause M00se always comes when there's hay on the ground!
 
                Chorus
 
                Now I've made it with all kinds of beasties with hair,
                   I'd make it with snakes if their fangs were not there,
                I've made it with walrus, two ducks and a goose,
                   But I've never 'ad anything quite like a M00se!
 
                Chorus
 
                Now gorillas are fine for a Saturday night,
                   And lions and tigers, they puts up a fight,
                But it just ain't the same when you slams their caboose
                   As the feeling you gets when you 'umps with a M00se!
 
                Chorus
 
                (slowly)
                Now that I'm old and advanced in me years,
                   I'll look back on me life, and I'll shed me no tears,
                As I sit in me chair with me glass of Mateuse,
                   And play hide the salami with Molly the M00se!
 
                Chorus
 
 
 
                           ----------------------
                           MISCELLANEOUS NONSENSE
                           ----------------------
 
Apart from the above lewd song, there is no nonsense in this issue.  Quite
agreed, quite agreed, too silly, too silly.
