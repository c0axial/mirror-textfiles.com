     Fellow m00ses, I'd like to apologize for getting this issue out late.
I'd like to say I've been very busy and didn't have time, but the truth
of the matter is, I completely forgot about it.
     Before the actual issue begins, an announcement.  Because some people,
through faulty mailers, or slow distributors, or undetected holes in the
distribution network, are either getting their M00se Droppings very slowly
or not at all, Sabre has started a new CSNEWS list: M00SEDRP.  This will
*not* affect the normal distribution network at all.  If you get your issues
too slowly, subscribe to M00SEDRP to get them faster.  Then, when you receive
a second copy via the distribution network, delete it.
     And now, on with the issue.

<< This letter came to me from Love-Hounds Digest.  If it's true, it's very
   important to all of us. >>
 
  <The following letter was recently sent to the radio station I work
at (WMUA Amherst) by a group in New York called "Music In Action." I
think it will be of interest to many people on the network.>
 
Dear Music Lover,
 
In the last few weeks, the freedom of contemporary music has come
under new and alarming attack.  Lurking in the halls of Congress is
bill S.2033, the deceptively named "Child Protection and Obscenity
Enforcement Act of 1988," which would allow federal authorities to
confiscate the business and personal property of virtually every one
of us.  This bill would enable federal authorities to obtain obscenity
convictions against records (this bill has the same far-reaching
implications for all the other arts - films, books, magazines, etc.),
then to expropriate the goods, bank accounts, homes, automobiles, and
pressing plants of everyone associated with these disks' sales.
Artists targeted incidentally include Prince, Madonna, Debby Boone and
Bruce Springsteen.
 
Here's how it's being done.  Title I provisions of the bill legislate
child protection measures against child pornography, while *Title II
provisions make obscenity a federal crime via the power of Congress to
regulate interstate commerce.* Since the Supreme Court has ruled that
there is no federal standard for obscenity...this bill, if enacted,
would *empower any local extremist group to sue in federal court* the
publisher, manufacturer, or retailer of any material it deemed obscene
*according to it's own local standards.* In addition to the provisions
mandating seizure and forfeiture of property, Title II provides for
*IMPRISONMENT FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS.* This new legislation is the
crowning achievement of the ignominious career of former Attorney
General Edwin Meese who was forced to resign under fire.
 
As of early July, the RIAA's legislative representatives thought the
law had a very low chance of passage.  Belatedly, the RIAA has
dramatically altered it's opinion.
 
Now it appears that the *Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement
Act* will be attached to a package of 'anti-crime' legislation and
rammed through as part of a Fall 1988 election-year ploy.  Senators
and Congressmen will virtually be forced to vote yes for the bill if
they want to demonstrate that they care about crime and the protection
of children.  This bill has already garnered 237 Congressional
co-sponsors, and is drawing an overwhelming volume of mail - all of it
supporting the bill.
 
Music In Action fully supports the Title I provisions of the bill.  We
are strongly opposed to the Title II provisions aimed at denying
adults their constitutionally guaranteed First Amendment rights.
 
Our opponents are well organized.  So must we be.  Our future depends
on it.  Join us in the fight to preserve our right to creative and
artistic expression.  Form a chapter of Music In Action on your campus
immediately and organize a *Music In Action Is Freedom In Action*
campaign.
 
Thanks,

<< Sindex has this to say about the new csnotice. >>
 
1)  Since Sabre came up with the idea of the separate csnotice (m00sedrp)
    for m00se droppings, I thought it might be a good idea if Pickle were
    to send a 1-line bl00p to m00se when a new issue came out, so that
    fellow m00se would know if they hadn't received an issue that they should
    have, and could request it from csnews.
 
2)  I'm not sure on the actual mechanics and difficulty thereof, but wasn't
    LISTSERV designed to alleviate distribution problems such as those that
    we're having?  It's spread all over the net, and we wouldn't need people
    to log on and forward things.... If this seems like a good idea, let me
    know and I'll pursue it further and try to figure out just what must be
    done to get it onto a LISTSERV... shouldn't be all *that* tricky though...
 
                                             bl00pfully yours
                                                    Sindex

<< Yowzah!  A great idea (in my opinion) from Jonathan Clemens. >>
 
I will be attempting to start an Illuminati game over the network, here are
the parameters:
        First 9 People to respond will be accepted.
        List your group or groups of preference, IN ORDER, with your entry.
        If there is enough interest, I will be looking for more moderators, so
if you have a deluxe set and would like to help, tell me that, too.
        Deluxe set, all groups, will be used.
        The Atlanteans, from expansion set #3, will also be used.
        Propaganda and Brainwashing will not be used.
        Building up power and resistance will be used.
        Turnaround time will theoretically be one day per player turn. It will
most likely be slower than that, but it'll be a bit faster than PBM.
        Hidden Illuminati may or may not be used--Vote on this when you enter.
        All dice will be rolled by my vax, so impartiality is assured.
 
                        All questions, entries, and misc. nonsense to:
                                Jonathan Clemens        JSJPC1@ALASKA
 
P.S. Weekly, I will get updates on victors & action to Pickle for publishing;
        here's a fast way to increase your stature among the M00ses!
 
P.P.S. No unexperienced players need apply. I know it sounds cruel but I
        Absolutely refuse to type the entire rulebook into a file. Not only
        would it be a royal pain, it would be illegal (not that I worry...)
 
Oh, By the way, I know this will put distributors at an advantage. I intended
it that way; after all, they need SOME rewards...

Yo, hey, hey!
 
        I'm given to unnerstan' that yer having trouble reaching me over
bitnet. There is a reason; CHEME is an ARPA host, and does not support
bitnet. However, there are ways about this evil antim00sian censorship.
All the machines at cornell (well, almost all. The PC's and the
dedicated mini's don't count) are tied in a campuswide net, and the I've
Been Moved mainframes are, in fact BITNETtable. It gets worse; my
account is on a cluster of vaxen (still the only correct plural of "vax")
and this tangles the address cluster even worse. Basically, what must be
done is to route mail to me at CHEME through crnlcs.... try sending to
"ZEMANIAN%CHEME@CRNLCS". This is most certainly simpler than the address
wolverine sent you, and may circumvent whatever bottleneck is blocking
the mail. Good luck.

<< A very important piece of information from Wolverine. >>
 
   Guess what I found at 7 Rays this weekend...
 
"The Complete Discordian M00semas Celebration Handbook"
written by Andalusia the Heretic..all kinds of neat stuff in it,
including:
 
"There are many ways to celebrate M00semas, all incorrect. Actually
sleeping or even hibernation are most favored of the Gods, but other
possibilities are:
 
* Loafing, lounging, napping, 'veging out', pretending to meditate,
  drifting in and out of light trances, hanging out, viewing TV
  (on or off), and low-energy partying with very mellow friends.
 
* Disconnecting the telephone and doorbell.
 
* Playing cards or board games while making love in a tub filled
  with fragrant warm oils. (if you don't move too fast.)
 
* Feasting on ritual foods, such as a fresh loaf of bread in
  Bullwinkle's image..fruit juice...roast goose...and of course,
  chocolate m0usse.
 
* Avoiding taboo activities such as shaving, worrying, weeding,
  the lawn, housework, and thinking.
 
* Decorating the altar with snack foods, several goblets of wine,
  furry hand puppets, long rubber objects, and love sonnets
  to yourself.
 
* Dressing in brown, fuzzy robes and loafers, and invoking the Gods
  in a hoarse, bugling voice as rarely as possible, from a
  horizontal postion.
 
    So let us all honor the old ways on this day of holy days:
with minimal exertion, go forth and M00SE 0UT!"
 
Well?
 Frank.
 
<< Let it be known that the date of the MegaThr0ng-a-Th0n (to be held, you
   remember, as soon as possible after we get our one-hundredth chapter)
   will, from that day forward, be known as M00semas. >>

Well, Long Island is in the southern portion of New York State, is it

and I have been wrestling with, in hopes of solving some of life's
mysteries involving the briny deep. In response to an invite to a pahty
near hallowed evening, I made mention that oysters are a disreputable
lot, living only to be eaten alive and growing gallstones to be hung
about the necks of hair girls. The reply was swift and incisive, and gave
birth to The Trelf Letters, below:

Biffer,
    Greetings!  Knew you wouldn't be able to attend the party, but
didn't want you to feel left out, so I sent ya' an invite.  AS for
druids, I was called a peddler ofcheap silks this weekend by one druid
in particular!!!  All because I helped you with your Latin grammar!  So
I guess we're both merchants now....and as for clams..
 
 I once had confab with a clam
 On the topic of green eggs and SPAM
 It was quite jolly, talking with Rollie

 And in the moonlight, Rollie and I
 went hunting for chicks, keeping an eye
 out for clam-hunters, who with their devilish sticks
 would chase down the clams and cut off their-----
 
     <Sadly enough, the preceding broadcast was cut short
      when the broadcast booth was blown up by
      Clamnesty International, who cited the vulgar,
      violence-invoking as the cause for their pyrotechnic
      display.  Their leader, Rev. Jerry Clamwell, had this
      to say about the incident:
 
          "Those bloody bastards had no right singing those
           lyrics against us clams!  It's anti-clamitism!
           Why, how would THEY liked to be covered in tartar
           sauce and have US come up and bite their ---"
 
         [ They above statement was cut short when an unknown
          bit of plankton came up and whacked Rev. Clamwell
          over the head with a 20 lb. sack of compressed kelp.
          The Plankton stated that he wasn't really against
          clams or their causes, but had just woken up on the
          wrong side of the bed that morning.  He then began
          to slaver and scream that Satan would purge the
          world of Blue Whales, and was carried of by
          several state and city officials.  We now return
          you to our normaly scheduled program,

And just why DID Julia Child spend so much time stuffing ducks?  I

So! How's it going, Clamrade?
 
        Thanks for the response, but I think you missed something
crucial in there somewhere. I believe I was talking (and rather kindly,
mind you) about oysters, not those lowlife trollops; clams. Actually, I
guess clams aren't so bad, they simply come from a broken home (seagulls
will do that, you know); having been forced to leave their parents with
nothing but the shells on their backs. The ones I really hate are the
scallops. (oooh. That word gives me cold shivers down the spine when I
even type it, much less say it.) These filthy little buggers are the
most perverted swine of the deep. I'm not the only one who thinks so,
either. Why do you think Shell Oil uses the shell of a scallop (oooh.)
as their logo, huh? I'll tell you why: SEX SELLS!!!!!!!! Those miserable
smut-brokers are appealing to man's baser instincts. (and lets face it,
what red-blooded American male HASN'T felt sexually attracted to
scallops (oooh.) at one time or another?) Notice, however, that they
haven't the guts to admit it right out and call themselves the Scallop
(oooh.) Oil Company. Oh, no. They'd rather abuse a harmless word like
"shell" and then show a picture of one half the exoskeleton of a scallop
(oooh.) and send our teenagers' hormones racing. Makes me sick. See you
Thursday.
 
 
                                If hot dogs are a symbol of all that is
                                American, does that explain why George
                                Bush is trying to be such a wienie?
 
 
                                        --Spaceman Biff!!!!!!!
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Biffer,
    Greetings!  I realize that you were talking about Oysters,
but you know those mollusks...they all look alike...and I really
wouldn't worry about scallops ruining the morals of todays youth...
In the latest Reader's Digest poll, 90% of the youth polled said they
didn't take scallops seriously, and believed they were only a passing
fad, much like Morton Downey Jr.  7% said they believed that the
scallops were being prostituted against their will, and these youth
planned to write letters to Nancy Reagan about a "Scallops Say NO"
campaign.  1.5% believed it was just a bum wrap, 1% believed
the scallops were actually hippies re-mutated due to a latent effect
in the drug LSD, which, after an incubation period of 10 to 15 years,
would cause hippies from the Sixties to degenerate back to some form
of oceanic life, and .5% actually Worshipped the Scallop, claiming
"...the Scallop shall bring us back to the Holy.  The Scallop shall
bring us back to the pure.  The Scallop shall heal the ills of the
materialist world we live in.  The Scallop is all-knowing.  All
Praise the Holy Scallop. Ooommm!" [At which point the youths, who
called themselves The Holy Zionistic Scallop Movement, began doing
their Sacred Scallop Dance, which included stripping half their clothes
and hiding behind large cardboard cut-outs of the Shell logo.]
 
So you see, there really isn't much to worry about scallops.  they are
basically harmless little shellfish which make a damn good meal. Now,
if I were you, and since we are almost the same shape, it COULD happen,
I'd worry about that etel symbol of innocence, the baby deer.  Think
about it...why would they just stand there and let themselves be run
over..could they be some form of strange occult worshippers?
food for thought from your M00sepapa,
Frnak
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
So that's the extent of the discussion to this point. Any additions
from interested illuminati would be muchly appreciated. Perhaps one day
we can accomplish one of my greatest personal goals in life; the
formation of a Pangalactic Mollusk Malignment Foundation. Unfortunately,
this name does not land itself to any decent acronyms, as "PMMF" sounds
suspiciously like the sound made by a m00se upon inhaling (gad!)
DORITOBREATH VAPORS!!!!!. I would have liked to have come up with an
organizational name that acronymizes (Aaagh! Beware the creeping
verbformers!) to OOOH, but there just aren't enough "O" words around to
do it.

        Ms. Ann Landers
 
        c/o The Chicago Tribune
        Chicago, Illinois
 
 
        Dear Ann,
 
                Not long ago you printed a letter from a bride-to-be who
        was concerned that the practice of throwing rice at weddings
        kills birds who eat the rice. (Presumably, it swells up in their
        bellies.) Well, yesterday I read an article from an ornithologist
        at Cornell University who says that rice is okay after all. I
        thought I'd share a few helpful hints for those who are still
        worried for the birds' safety: firstly, throw birdseed instead,
        or, if that's too expensive, cook the rice first. That way, it
        won't swell up anymore after it's eaten, and you can save money
        too, since you get three cups of cooked rice to throw from every
        cup of uncooked rice; a savings of 67%.
                I hope I've saved a few brides some worry.
 
                                                Keeping the Faith,
