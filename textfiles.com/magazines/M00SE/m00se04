        There are no real editorials this week.  All I have to say is that
Kamikaze has nearly completed the forwarding map for the new distribution
method.  Hopefully the map itself will be included in issue #5, and we can
start using it as of issue #6.
        Oh, yes, many of you still have questions about subscribing to the
CSNEWS m00se discussion.  Issue the following command to CSNEWS@MAINE with
an interactive message:
 
                        CSBB SUBSCRIBE M00SE
 
        You will then receive lots of help files that will explain how to
post messages to the list.  We can thank Sindex for sending me the command
after I accidentally deleted it.

        There was a thr0ng-a-thon in Baltimore this past weekend, which
I attended (hence the lateness of this issue!)  My report will be included
in issue #5.

        Lots of nonsense this week.  This is from Wolverine:

                  Millions Cheer As Cher Keels Over Dead
                  -------- ----- -- ---- ----- ---- ----
 
     The nations of the world are a little closer this month, thanks in part
to the recent death of seventy-four-year-old health-club spokesunit  and
Oscar winner Cher, who suddenly degraded into her component elements during
the filming of a new spa commercial.
     In celebration of the blessed event, the Palestinians and Israelis have
agreed to peace talks, Iran and Iraq have called a cease-fire, and the
Nicaraguan contras have surrenedered their weapons.  Pope John Paul II has
called a special Mass in Rome, calling the death "proof positive of a God
who cars and takes and active part in imporoving the lives of men."
     The cause of death has not been determined.  The actress/singer/monlith
was last seen entering a hot steam bath.  Details are sketchy, although
bystanders report hearing screams of "Gatemaster, give me another year,"
followed by a soft gurgling sound.  No remains were found other than a
small piece of tinfoil the deceased often wore as an evening gown.

Lord Rassilon wrote:

        You will notice that Lord Rassilon used 'm00se' as a verb.  I hereby
propose that we use 'm00se' as a verb whenever it seems appropriate, but
certainly not to the nauseating extent that those little blue creatures
used 'smurf' as a verb.

The Mail order ad song
 
Fell asleep last night with the TV on,
Oh, what a dream I had.
Drempt I went and answered every single one of those
Late Night Mail order ads.
And four to 6 weeks later,
Much to my surprise,
The mailman came to my front door,
And I couldn't beleive my eyes
 
When he brought the
Vegematic, and the pocket-fisherman too.
The illuminated illustrated history of life,
Boxcar Willie with a ginsu knife.
A bamboo steamer and a smokeless ashtray,too.
And a tyed-dyed souviner shirt
From six flags over Burbank.
 
Well the doorbell rang all morning,
And all through the afternoon.
I shook with fright as it rang all night
Under the light of the Mastercard moon.
There was parcel post in the pantry,
UPS in the hall,
COD's to the ceiling,
And I just couldn't pay for it all.
 
When he brought the
Egg Scrambler, with a seal-a-meal carrying case.
A set of presidential commemorative plates,
So I can eat my eggs off the president's face.
A minute mender and a garden weasel too,
And an Autographed photgraph of Rin-Tin-Tin
At six flags over burbank
 
Well I realized I was dreaming,
So I gave a rowdy cheer.
But when I awoke, it was no joke,
Cause all that Shit was here!
So if you fall asleep with the tv on,
Let me tell you what to do.
Rip the telephone out of the wall,
Unless you want it to happen to you.
 
Cause you'll get the
Vegematic, and the pocketfisherman,too.
Illuminated Illustrated history of life,
Boxcar Willie with a Ginsu knife
A bamboo steamer and a needle that will knit or Croqhet,
And A tyed-dyed souviner shirt
From six flags over burbank.

And, of course, another update on the General M00se list.  We have somewhere
around eight new chapters, pushing our total BITNET thr0ng to over fifty
chapters, bl00p to you all and welcome!  I apologize that you didn't get
personal mail from me, but it's been a very busy week...
 
Once again, look this list over and let me know if anything looks wrong.
If you told me once and I still didn't correct it, bear with me.  I don't
always think straight.
