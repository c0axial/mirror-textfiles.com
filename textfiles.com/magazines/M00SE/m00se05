any problems let us know ASAP!  We don't want to lose anybody.
   And now, on with the issue.....

******************************* EVENTS AND NEWS *******************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                    INTERESTED IN OTHER PEOPLE'S VACATIONS?
                    =======================================
 
On July 8th, 1988, the Pickle chapter of the M00se Illuminati packed up and
headed for Baltimore, MD for a thr0ng-a-thon and concert.  This is his story.
 
 
JULY 8, 1988 (Approximately 3:30 P.M.):  Car packed.  Food and tapes on
  passenger seat.  Full tank (30-35 gallons) of premium gasoline.  Mad River
  Explorer on roof racks.  An estimated 4700 lbs. of car, driver, supplies, and
  canoe hit the road.  Itinerary:  bank, Triple-A, Highway 84w.
 
(App. 4:00 P.M.):  Bank accounts now empty.  $105 in pocket.  On way to AAA,
  1-liter bottle of Coca-Cola Classic assaults car and driver.  Theory:
  poltergeist in bottle.  Go to AAA, get card.  Coke is corrosive; as it would
  not do to leave it on the car, head for nearest car wash.
 
(App. 4:30 P.M.):  While entering gas station to pay for car wash, realize that
  there is Mad River Explorer on roof racks.  Curse, head for nearest non-
  automatic car wash in South Windsor.
 
(App. 5:30 P.M.):  Car Washed, Dairy Queen cherry Misty Freeze in stomach, on
  84w.  Just before passing Farmington exit, realize that there are no clothes
  suitable for concert in duffel bag.  Snarl a lot, take Farmington exit home.
 
(App. 6:00 P.M.):  Finally hit road with pants, shirt, mismatched but dark
  socks, shoes, borrowed tie.  Determined to call Stasa at approximately 10:00
  P.M. to tell her I'll be 2 hours late.
 
(App. 11:00 P.M.):  Realizing have forgotten to call Stasa.  About to seek
  phone when sign leaps out of bushes and states "Baltimore 58 miles."  Realize
  in amazement that the trip is two hours shorter than expected.
 
(12:02 P.M.):  Arrive at Stasa's home and habitation, 2 minutes late.  Present
  flowers and Asti and apologize.  Ponder the realization that the Supertanker
  quaffed down at least two quarts of oil on the trip.
 
 
(The time periods between events will now increase.)
 
 
(Saturday, July 9, 1988):  Wake up.  Accompany Stasa to pool.  Meet her fellow
  lifeguards.  Add weight to theory that one of the requirements of being a
  lifeguard is a stunning appearance in bathing suit.  Avoid looking too
  stunned, read book.  Several hours later, impressive electrical storm puts on
  spectacular audiovisual display.  Back to Stasa's house, change, meet Q. and
  friend with fast car, head out to meet Grup thr0ng.  See _Who_Framed_Roger_
  Rabbit_.  Meet straggling Grup chapters, head for dinner.  In attendance:
  Stasa, Q., Q.'s friend (Steve?), Sybil, Fast Eddie, Markus, Mommy Dammit, Mary
  Beth, Paul?, Mike, Damion (sp?), Damion's support group, myself.  In no
  particular order.  Sorry if I missed someone.  Fries, beverages, joke,
  homeward.  Mary Beth actually was ill and missed dinner, but at least we
  got to see her.  Home, sleep.
 
(Sunday, July 10, 1988):  Pool again, many of those listed above in attendance
  for pool party.  Stasa proves that she is paid too little.  Many scorched
  m00ses.  Sunglasses wars.  Home and sleep.
 
(Monday, July 11, 1988):  Wake up, discover everybody was right and shoulders
  were, in fact, burned.  Take painful shower.  Outdoor temp once again 100+.
  Stasa leads the way to the Gunpowder river.  Very pretty, much cooler, and
  infested with some kind of biting fly.  Back home, collect Mary Beth, go to
  Harbor Place, or Inner Harbor, or whatever its real name is.  Comic shop fails
  me second time in a row, does not have a single thing I'm looking for.
  (Doesn't carry Warlock 5?!  "Not much call for it 'round here", they say.)
  Buy delicious fudge.  Take Mary Beth home, go back to Stasa's, sleep.
 
(Tuesday, July 12, 1988):  Observe spectacular storm at 2:00 am.  Go with
  Stasa to Loyola, receive as gift from Mike an account of my own.  Back
  to Stasa's for a while, then back to Loyola, get wiped out by Mike in
  Conquest.  Back to Stasa's again, leave with Mr. Appel to concert.  German
  and Austrian dancing and music.  Inside for the concert.  Piano concerto,
  intermission, Ninth Symphony.  First movement lacking, but second incredible.
  Third and fourth very good.  Howard Johnson's for dinner and snack.
  Discovery:  HoJo's is not a rathole everywhere.  This one is more like
  Denny's.  Back once more, and sleep.
 
(Wednesday, July 13, 1988):  Awake, farewell to all.  Drive to Harbor Place,
  shop and eat a little more.  Hit the road home.
 
 
NOTE:  New Jersey bashing ahead.
 
 
  All was going well when a sign announced "This way to 95 north/NJ Turnpike".
  Figuring, since I was already on it, that there was construction ahead
  on the turnpike, I took the exit.  And ended up on Route 1 North, with
  a traffic light every half mile or so, for an hour.  In heavy traffic.
  Can't use air conditioner in stop-and-go.  Suddenly realize what those
  sneaky bastards had done!  (Later confirmed by parents, this detour has
  been there for years.)  On either side of the road are thriving roadside
  businesses, all of which would probably go out of business if people could
  take 95 around them!  If thoughts could drop bombs, New Jersey would be
  a smoking wasteland right now, rather than just a wasteland.  As if that
  weren't enough, they charge $3 to leave NJ via the big suspension bridge.
  I forget what it's called.  They don't charge you to enter NJ!
 
  Rest of trip without incident.  Oh, except for one item of note... on
  the NY-CT line is Danbury, CT.  In it is the Danbury Federal Correctional
  Institution.  On the way past it going into CT is a sign:
 
                     FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION
 
                        DO NOT PICK UP HITCHHIKERS
 
  This sign does not exist on the other side of the road, as you travel
  toward NY.  Does this mean it's been stolen by a convict/hitchhiker, or
  that CT doesn't care if escapees head for NY?
 
  Well, that's my report.  Not the best piece of writing I've done, but
  hey!  It's the summer!
 
                                                        Pickle.

***************************** FICTION AND POETRY ******************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
   Once again, there is no fiction and poetry this week.  Send me some and
I'll publish it.  Please.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*************************** MISCELLANEOUS NONSENSE ****************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                      SOMETHING FIENDISHLY M00SY TO DO...
                      ===================================
 
  Ahoy there!  How's life going?  What, you have a lot of time on your hands?
Well here's something that will both occupy your time and make the world a
stranger place to live in...
  You see, I have this roommate who badly needs to have something odd happen
to him, only he doesn't know it.  And what better place to go to get something
odd done than here?  So what I'm asking is that, if you've got the mind,
sit down and write a postcard.  Don't put your name on it, don't put a return
address, and for god's sake *SEND NO CASH*.  Leave the message part blank,
put something weird in it (and I know you can...), or maybe some argument
for/against the existance of something, or a math puzzle or just random
words, it doesn't really matter...so long as he's baffled, bewildered, and
bemused...(no threats would be best, I'm not out to give him sleepless
nights...)
  And, if you really care, let me know and I'll give you the bleedin' fifty
cents or so it costs.  And if you know somebody in a remote area who might
want to drop this fellow a line (really, he's a big cheese weenie), that
would be great (I'm trying for the largest geographical spread here).
  So anyway if you're still with me, here's the address:
 
          Eduardo Looney     (no, not his name but it's pretty close)
          3465 Edinburgh #7
          Riverside, CA 92507
 
by the way I'm sending this both to the literary underground and weird-l.
Sorry if you're seeing it twice.  And if you think it's a gross waste
of net resources to do this, well I'm sending this on a weekend, see? And
if you think it's the greatest idea since...well I'm sure you can think
of something, the tell a friend!  or a fiend!
 
Thank you for your consideration...
 
      Kevin "you're not getting my last name" Lund
