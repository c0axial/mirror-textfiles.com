	Welcome to the ISU Space Power Digest!!  This digest will
        seek to provide a forum for discussion of wireless power
        transmission, solar power systems.  It is hosted by alumni
        and faculty of the International Space University, but is
        open to everyone with an interest in this area.

************** Space Power, the journal *****************

If you would like to keep up on numerous interesting
technical developments in the areas of space solar power,
space nuclear power, non-terrestrial resources, space
manufacturing, etc. Subscribe to Space Power today! This
journal has been around for over 10 years and it features
in-depth, yet understandable articles in these areas and
more. I have typed in the information on the journal
advertisement brochure below. Notice that several ISU
faculty members and visiting lecturers are associate
editors. Also, each summer I ask some ISU students to write
papers for the journal and at least 2 papers written by ISU
students have been published in the last 2 years.

There have been many fascinating papers published in the
journal that are relevant to human expansion into space by
use of space resources. Two years ago, the Journal of Lunar
Exploration and Development (published by the notorious G.
Canough) was merged with Space Power, so that Space Power
does not only deal with energy, but also material resources.

So I invite you to subscribe to the journal and/or get your
local library to subscribe. The subscription rates are among
the lowest for a technical journal. Inspection copies are
available upon request (fill out form below).

The Council for Social and Economic Studies and the SUNSAT
council are affiliated with the United Nations.

I also invite you to write an article for the journal. We
are always looking for good papers. If you have an idea, and
want to discuss it, feel free to contact me, or any other
associate editor, or Andy Cutler (Editor).

And, if you would be so kind, please cross post this note to other
space and science bulletin boards! Thanks!

**********************************************
Copied directly from the brochure about Space Power:

Space Power is a quarterly, international journal for the
presentation, discussion and analysis of advanced concepts,
initial treatments and ground-breaking  basic research on
the technical, economic and societal aspects of: large-scale
space-based solar power, space resources utilization, space
manufacturing, space colonization, and other areas related
to the development and use of space for the benefit of
humanity. Papers, letters, notes, comments and occasional
editorial are published as well as topical book reviews.

Contributions:
Submissions should represent the original work of the
authors and should not have appeared elsewhere in
substantially the same form. Proposals for review papers are
encouraged and will be considered by the Editor on an
individual basis. Four copies of submissions and an abstract
(not exceeding 400 words) should be sent.

English is the official language of the journal. Editorial
assistance will be provided to authors whose native language
is not English.

Dr. Andrew Hall Cutler may be reached by telephone at 602
322 2997 or 327 9205, by facsimile at 602 326 0938 and by
mail : 4717 East Fort Lowell, Tucson, Arizona 85712, USA

Papers are of general and lasting interest and are written
so as to make them accessible to technically educated
professionals who may not be familiar with the specific area
discussed in the paper. Letters and notes are used to air
particular points and concepts when a lengthy paper is not
required. Comments allow workers in the field to respond to,
elucidate and  expand particularly interesting points in
previously published papers. Editorial and opinion pieces of
approximately one journal page in length are published if
they are well argued and pertinent to the content of the
journal. Topical books, journals, proceedings and meetings
are reviewed when considered to be of high standard.

Space Power is published by the Council for Economic and
Social Studies, 6861 Elm St. Suite 4H, McLean, VA 22101 on
behalf of the SUNSAT Energy Council.
