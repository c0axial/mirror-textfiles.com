Space Power Digest          Fri,  2 Apr 93       Volume 1 : Issue 004 

Today's Topics:
                      preparing for 21st century

	Welcome to the ISU Space Power Digest!!  This digest will
        seek to provide a forum for discussion of wireless power
        transmission, solar power systems.  It is hosted by alumni
        and faculty of the International Space University, but is
        open to everyone with an interest in this area.

Greetings space-power subscribers. Anyone have some input to
this topic? If you have read something relevant, please post
reviews or excerpts. (When posting excerpts, be sure to
reference them.) One way for us to all keep abreast of the
wide variety of developments which are relevant to solar
power and wireless power transmission, is for each of us to
post short notes summarizing some piece of information new
to you. In addition to keeping the solar power and WPT
community informed, I want to build up a bibliography to
have available to persons who are new to the field or just
interested in becoming informed. So please attach as
complete reference information as you can when posting
summaries or excerpts.

Information that would be appropriate for this topic
includes (but not limited to):

PV array info, research
solar thermal technologies
storage technology for solar power systems
phased arrays
FET developments and use
rectennas
power beaming info, hardware
satellite power systems i.e on comm sats etc
deployable solar arrays
Russian solar sail/reflector
power system for Mir, Freedom
environmental impacts (electric interference, health effects
of microwaves, power beam effects on atmosphere, etc.)
real cost of energy
energy needs of Earth and space users
demo projects, proposed and in progress (such as METS,
Alaska 21, Reunion Island...)
early commercial uses for wireless power transmission
how to use solar and or beamed power for South Pole Station
beam optics
frequency allocation possibilities for beamed power
commercial prospects for solar power (both terrestrial and
celestial)

****************************************************
The SUNSAT Energy Council meeting was held in Washington DC
on March 26, minutes will be posted very soon! At the
meeting Peter Glaser strongly recommended we read the book
"Preparing for the 21st Century" by Paul Kennedy (Random-
House). I went to check this book out of the library and,
not only was it checked out, there was a waiting list for
it! Figuring this (combined with Peter's recommendation)
must mean it's really good, I headed over to my local book
store an bought a copy.

Here are some excerpts from the first couple chapters. In
chapter one, he reviews the history of Britain in the
context of population pressures. He goes into how the dire
problems predicted by Malthus were avoided, at least for
Britain (if not for some of its colonies). In chapter 2 he
lays out the distribution and growth in the world's
population. Every time I see these numbers, I cringe.

p 6

"Nevertheless, three developments permitted the British
people to escape the fate Malthus predicted for them. The
first was emigration: people left the British Isles in vast
numbers, in search of better conditions elsewhere. While
only slightly more than 200 000 emigrated in the 1820's,
that figure trebled in the following decade and reached
almost 2.5 million in the 1850's. Between 1815 and 1914,
around 20 million Britons left the country, a massive exodus
relative to the overall population (By 1900, the British
population was about 41 million; without emigration it would
have been over 70 million)"

Notice that more than 1/3 of the population emigrated. The
other 2 developments were improvements in farming and the
industrial revolution.

p 12

"In the eighteenth century, the global population was adding
another quarter of a billion every seventy-five years;
today, such an increase occurs every three years."

Go back and read that again!!! Every 3 (!!) years, one
quarter of a billion people are added to the world.


p 22

"In 1825, as Malthus was making the final amendments to his
original Essay on Population, about 1 billion human beings
occupied the planet, the race having taken thousands of
years to reach that total. By then, however,
industrialization and modern medicine were permitting
population to rise at an increasingly faster rate. In the
following 100 years, the world's population doubled to 2
billion and in the following half century (1925 to 1976) it
doubled again, to 4 billion. By 1990, the figure had
advanced to 5.3 billion."

On page 23 is a graph showing population growth trends for
developed and developing countries. Whereas developed
countries have about 1 billion people today and will grow to
1.5 billion by 2000, developing countries have the other 3.5
billion which will grow to 6 billion by 2000.

p 23

"In the 1985-1990 period, the earth's enlarged population
was adding about 88 million people annually-equal to the
population of Mexico City today."

Just as a comparison, next year, there will(at least) 88
million more people, and this amounts to the yearly traffic
at the O'Hare airport, which moves about one plane load per
MINUTE!

Well, that's enough for today. As I told a friend of mine,
if we are going to use the emigration strategy (into space)
to alleviate the population pressure on Earth, we will be
launching a rocket every minute! Think on that...
