        hey-ho.  i'm so big, i'm so cool, i'm just so fuckin' elite.  "hey
  man, you got the garbage file?!1  thats ELiTE!@1"  anyhoo; i have a question
  for you.

        since when did halloween become the most exploited holiday in the
  history of mankind?  all of a sudden, it seems that all of the rules of
  halloween have been thrown out.  the ethics of this hallowed day that i grew
  up with as a kid, have been thrown out the window.

        let's go back to a different time.  (cue wavy lines on your monitor
  right now.)  a few years ago, i was younger, you were younger.  i lived in a
  different town, not far away from where i live now.  i was walking around
  town, trudging a wet pillowcase filled with candy.  my "jason" hockey mask
  flung over my head.  i was tired, wet, yet happy.

        they were simpler times.  kids dressed up in creative constumes (hey,
  don't knock "jason", its creative, read on..), getting candy, seldom seeing
  a decorated house.  it was all good, it was simple back then.

        suddenly, things changed.  it didn't happen over a few years, you
  didn't see it here, and then there, and then everywhere.  it just happened.
  maybe its because i'm older, and i notice more things now, but other people
  have noticed it, too.  it's not just me.

        suddenly, people are decorating their houses.  sure, people did that
  in the past for halloween, maybe a pumpkin and some corn stalks, but now,
  people put ten tombstones, these big ass sheets that they call 'ghosts',
  and a whole lot of other stuff.  stores are making big bussiness off of it,
  too.  no more of this thanksgiving then christmas crud.  now its halloween,
  thanksgiving, and then christmas.  they'll just extend it more, soon labor
  day will be mass marketed and exploited, too.

        also, another thing that peeves me about the whole halloween dealy
  deal, is that since when do kids get by without dressing up?  i admit, it
  gets annoying giving out candy and all, but then i think back a few years,
  and remember how much fun it was to get the candy, thank the person, and
  scamper off to the next house.

        something different is happening now.  i notice that _alot_ of kids
  that i go to school with, like high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors,
  are going out trick or treating.  i had one kid come to my house, regular
  clothes, paper bag, must have been 16 or 17.  my mom gave him candy, and
  asked him what he was, he said "i'm an undercover fbi agent."  dickhead.

        why don't kids dress up anymore?  i see kids that are like 8 going out
  in regular clothes, without dressing up.  i've lost all faith in major
  holidays now; they've exploited christmas, easter, and thankgiving.  saint
  nick, the easter bunny, and the turkey, yest we add the great pumpkin to
  this list?  i think not.

        STOP EXPLOITING ALL THE HOLIDAYS.  LEAVE SOME FUN IN THEM FOR KIDS
  STILL.  DOWN WITH THE ARISTOCRATS WHO DAMAGE OUR HOLIDAYS.  BAD BAD.

        wee-haw.  that was fun.  now, if you excuse me, i'll be gettin' my
  prozac pills.  now, for some news.

        this issue of jonas will be alittle longer then most previous issues.
  i've done some capturing of messages that i've found, and typed up some
  interesting newspaper articles.  overall, its just longer.

        also; this issue will be the best issue jonas has ever put out.
  "really?!@1", you ask yourself.  really.  i've done much more work then i
  have the previous issues, i've been on a creative streak.  i've had some
  pretty good ideas for this issue too.  i think this issue will redefine the
  word "'zine".

        maybe it _won't_ redefine the word "'zine".  oh-kay.  maybe it won't
  redefine anything, but i'm still pleased with how this issue is coming out
  _so-far_.  (yes, as always, i'm writing this way ahead of time.)

        thats weird.  that last comment i put in here.  most prior issues of
  jonas, i got my articles that were submitted to me, wrote some stuff on my
  own, and then put it all together.  beginning to end time was maybe a week,
  tops.  but this issue, its different.  i actually started writing this way
  ahead of time.  right after issue 12 came out, i started work on this.

        i think i like this method, too.  i put down all of the different
  story ideas in my head, and worked on them seperately.  i'm really happy
  with how my editorial came out, too.  all and all, i'm really pleased with
  this issue.  except for one thing;

        as of _this_ writing of my editorial (note the 'this', i sometimes can
  write parts or the whole editorial a bunch of times.)  its about 2 weeks
  before my target release date, and i have _no_ submissions.  terminal
  velocity said he would do some stuff, but thats it.  i have _nothing_.
  everything in here is written by me.  ack!@  i should just go elite, and go
  solo.  yeah, thats an idea.

        (* late editorial note, terminal velocity _didn't_ contribute
  anything, asshole *)

        i can change the name of the 'zine to "edicius".  i'd be a solo 'zine.
  i'd scoff at the non-believers, and just say that i'm leeter then them.
  yeah, that'd be rad.  i think i will do that.

        "ralph, get the guns.  we have a lamer on the loose."

        ok, i get the point.  i think i'll be leaving now.

        but before i go, i want to remind you of something that we're doing.
  the next issue of jonas shall be out on december 14, yeah, exactly at that
  time.  there will be a really special issue of jonas that will be put
  together, especially for a special person's birthday (hint, hint, nudge
  nudge..)  so, be waiting, it shall be a really good issue.  submit for it,
  too!  you'll be pleased.

        also, take a few minutes, and fill out the survey.  just use a regular
  text editor, and fill it out.  its not that hard.  i'd like to get a real
  good sampling of people for this survey, i want a really good survey result
  article to write.  so fill them out, fuckas!

        one last thing, i swear.  if you're hep to the net and looking for the
  ultimate in 'zine madness, point your web browsers to 'zineworld, the
  ultimate experience - http://www.pla-net.net/~jwapienn/zineworld/ - got
  that?  you better.  thanks to mercuri, this page lists an amazing and
  growing number of links and web papges for many underground computer 'zines.
  WE LOVE MERCURI!

        ok, thanks enough for now.
        buhbye.

  +---- --- -- - ------+ open letter to michael stipe +-------- - -- --- ----+

  dear mister stipe and rem:

        i am petitioning you and your band to change your lyrics.  in one your
  songs, "end of the world (and i feel fine)", you have a line that reads as
  follows:

  "the other night i tripped a nice continental drift divide, mount saint
  edelite, leonard bernstine"

        i am asking that you change the lyric to read:

  "the other night i tripped a nice continental drift divide, mount saint
  EDICIUS, leonard bernstine"

        edelite?  who's heard of 'mount saint edelite'?  who's heard of 'mount
  said edicius', for that matter.  no one, really.  but edicius, its the same
  amount of letters and sounds like 'edelite'. the word edicius is ten times
  cooler then the word edelite, too.   you won't have to change _that_ much,
  just one word.  consider it.

            thank you for your time.  i'm sure that you and rem will follow
  through with this lyric change, for the better of mankind.

  edicius.

        "tom.  wake up tom.  come towards the light," the deep voice
  beckons me in the nighttime.

        startled, i jump out of bed.  the big lcd clock stares me in the face,
  "two in the morning?  who the hell is this?"  i turn around, and see a mist
  in the room.  a ghoulish figure is standing near my closest.

        "hey, who the hell are you?", i ask.

        "me?  well, i'm satan.  i have a proposition for you," he replies, "i
  would like you to join me."

        "join you?  how?"

        "sell your soul to me, i will grant you immortality in hell."

        "really?  that sounds good, how much?"

        "WHAT?  he's actually going for it?  no one actually goes for it," he
  mumbles to himself, "uwhm.  lemme think, how much would it cost you to sell
  your soul to me?"

        "hm.  lemme write down a figure, we'll play it from there."  i grab a
  piece of paper from the desk, and scribble down some numbers.  i hand it to
  the man, and by the smile on satan's face, i can tell its no dice.

         "six million dollars?  this is properous.  what do you think we do in
  hell?  we don't have that much money.  geezus, who do you think i am?"

        "well, you're satan.  ok, so no deal there, eh?  lesse, here's another
  figure.  tell me how this looks."  with that, i scribble another number down
  on the paper, tear it off, and give it to him.

        "eighty-two cents?  you're gonna sell your soul to me for eighty-two
  cents?"

        "eh-yup.  hey, everlasting immortality is something that only comes
  along once in a lifetime, i'm not gonna be that stingy in trying to get it.

        "eighty-two fuckin' cents.  wow.  tom, you have a deal.  welcome to
  hell."

        "cool.  okey, so, when do i get there?"

        "well, lemme look here," he grabs a notebook from his jacket,
  "salvidor, sinclare, stevens, ah, here it is, sullivan, tom sullivna.  ok,
  you should be arriving into the firey pits of hell in twelve years.  from
  lung cancer, you'll be smoking too much.  haha.  i just made a hell joke!
  haha.  get it?  smoke, fire, hell!  haha."

        "wow," i say to him, "not only are you the demon of demons, but you
  have a sense of humor too.  pretty nifty, if you ask me."

        "well, you know, i try to be modest, but when you're the supreme ruler
  of evil, you have to have some funny side in you."

        "hah.  i hear you buddy, i hear you.  ok, so tell me, when's the
  presidental elections down there?"

        "what?  presidental elections?  what the hell is this rubbish?  i'm
  the dictator, there is no president down in hell.  i'm the leader."

        "eech.  that must suck.  hey, here's an idea.  when i get down there,
  give me four years to run it, i promise you a bigger population, and more
  money coming into the budget.  hell will be the hep place to be."

        "really?  a four year vacation?  i never really thought about.. wait a
  second, what the hell are you saying to me, the ruler of evil?  i'm the
  leader down there, you cannot take that away from me."

        "thats the problem, you're uptight.  you have this whole
  god-complex.."

        "god complex?  sorry to interupt, but there is no god in hell."

        "uhm, sure, whatever.  anyway; you have this whole ego thing.  you're
  uptight.  you need some time off.  no offense or anything, but people don't
  think too highly of you."

        "really?  i never knew that," satan says.  his face grows deeper, and
  looks to be saddened by this news.  "i've always tried to keep my image
  pretty good.  i don't really know how this whole horns and red skin thing
  came about, i'm not really that horrid looking, am i?"

        "no you're not, satan.  we could have this whole big never-world going
  down in hell, trust me.  you and me, we'll do good."

        "really?  hey, that could be good.  wait a fucking second, you're sly
  there tom.  but i'm not buying into this.  i'll come back at a later time."

        "but satan, wait!"  but it was too late, he had already left. back to
  sleep i went, still amazed about the transaction that took place.

  +-- - --+

        the next few days were spent thining up ideas for the "new hell", that
  i would create.  since satan is the root of all evil, i really knew i had to
  do a good job, or something horrid would be in store for me.  i really
  didn't want to find out exactly what would happen.

        i had ideas, visions of the new hell.  something beautiful, something
  that has been never seen before.  swimming pools, casinos, hotels, family
  entertainment.  it all would be there.  hell would surely become the hip
  place to be.

        it happened again.  right in the middle of my wet dream, satan
  appeared to me.  his vast, expressionless face staring at me in the middle
  of the night.

        "tom, what do you wish of me?  i can sense your mood, i know you need
  to speak to me."

        "ok.  i have these ideas, take a look at them.  remember, its
  still a rough draft, but take the things into consideration," i said, as i
  took out a large portfolio of various plans, blueprints, and charts.  "look
  at them, tell me what needs to be changed, and i'll work on it."

        "what??  what is this crud?  blueprints, charts.. hey, is there really
  going to be a eight-teen hole golf course next to the tropworld casino?
  hey, that could be pretty nice.  i've been looking for a place to work on my
  backswing."

        "but thats not all.  i was planning on changing a few more things.
  first off, we need to have a stable currency.  we're not looking to compete
  with the us dollar, or the japanese yen, just something that we can use.  we
  will be having a large population now, ya'know what i mean?"

        "true, very true."

        "but wait, thats not all.  we'll have a full run of commenrative
  stamps -- all the people in hell, joseph stallin, adolf hitler, jimmy buffet
  --  a better postal system too, a recent survey showed that alot of the
  population of hell was dissatisfied with the way the postal service was.."

        "dissatisfied my ass.  give me names, i'll make their eternal
  damnation even worse."

        "no!  thats another thing we need to change; your attitude.  many
  people, well, you know.  they're kinda scared of you."

        "they're supposed to fear me (not that pesky mogel guy.)  i am the
  death bearer, i'm not a real people person.  i am eviler then evil.  i'm not
  supposed to be nice."

        "well, it looks like your attitude will be hard to change.  i'll work
  on that more later.  i called all-state today, inquiring about an insurance
  policy.."

        "insurance?  why do we need insurance?"

        "with people coming, we need some type of tourist spot insurance
  coverage, so when people get hurt, we don't get sued."

        "fuck them.  cast them into the firery pits if they get hurt."

        "thats the thing that is hampering the whole insurance dealy-deal; the
  fire.  you know, hell is just one _huge_ firepit.  did you ever notice it?
  all-state said they can't insure a bad fire risk as ourselves.  so, i told
  them i'd start a few voulenter fire departments, have fire safety classes at
  the ymca, and mcgruff and smokey the bear put on a really bitchin'
  performance for the kids."

        "fire department?  ymca?  smokey the bear?  enough of this bullshit,
  tom.  i do not want to hear this crud any much longer.   you are banished
  from hell!@  do not come down here!  get out of my sight!@"

        "but satan.. what about me being president?"

        "get out of my sight you creaton!"

        "can i have my soul back?"

        "oh.  that thing.  yes, you can have it back.. here.. and my money?"

        "oh.  that.  i kinda spent it on gum.  want a stick of big red?"

        "no!  just take your soul, thats all i want.  i don't need money.  i
  am the leader of hell!@  i make my own money."

        "well.  ok, in that case, i don't want to go to hell, you asshole."

        "me?  asshole?  why you annoying little twirt," he says with a voice
  full of anger.  he runs, and lunged toward me.  i duck, he hits the wall.
  "pit pat spat.  why you fucking asshole.."  boom.  he hits me square in the
  jaw.  so, i kick him.

        "don't fuck with me nigguh!  i'll beat you; and i don't care if you
  are the prince of darkness."  i hit him again.  he hits me.  this escapade
  continues for 5 minutes.  we cease hitting each other while we catch our
  breathe.

           i stand up in the middle of the room.  "is that all you can do?!
  the big and almighty satan can't even kick a fifteen year-old's ass?  what
  are you?  like, a ga-zillion years old?  HIT ME RIGHT HERE," i pound on my
  chest, "right here you fuckin' asshole.  NOW!"

        fists a-flyin', satan runs towards me screaming, "aaaahhh!@  you
  little prick!"

        just before he is about to catch me, i knee him in the groin.  he
  falls to the ground in agony.  "oouh.  muh.  muh..  ouuch.  oww.  muh nuts.
  oww.  yoou..  f-fuck.. in..   oww.  oouuch.  oww, my crotch.  my crotch.  my
  crotch is on fire."

        "yeah, thats what i thought.  hooo-pbbt," i spit on him.  "some people
  are just so fuckin' egotistical.  you won't let someone else take over for
  awhile, and look what you're doing now.  on the ground, rolling around, in
  wretched agony.  you wuss."

        "vengence will be mine.  oh yes, it will be mine."  puff.  smoke, he
  disappears.  a dark drool spot is easily noticed against the grainy blue of
  the carpet where he fell.

        "a drool spot.  just one big fucking drool spot is left."

  +---- ----- - -------+ music, smhusic + by edicius +-------- - -- --- ----+

        is it just me, or is there a major conspiracy to ruin all of the good
  music in the world?

        i think there is, if not, somethings tragically screwed up.  now, one
  of my favorite bands, currently, is civ.  i got their 'debut' (if you want
  to call it that) cd just after it came out, and a day after i saw them in
  concert.  i've loved it ever since, i think its a really rad cd.

        i happen to have a 'zine cover with a picture of civ (the leader
  singer of civ - coincidence?) on it.  i was bored the other day, so i
  started drawing it in my sketchbook.  soon enough, i had a pretty good
  picture out of it.

        the next day, i was sitting in my art class.  i was bored with the
  project i was working on, so i whipped out the ole' sketchbook to finish the
  picture.  some kids asked me who it was, so i told them, "its the lead
  singer of the band called 'civ'.  ever hear of it?"  out of the three or
  four kids that i asked if they heard of civ, only one person said "yeah, i
  think so, i think i've heard of them."

        god damnit.  no one listens to anything if its not played on a big
  time radio station, or mtv.  civ has been being played on mtv, rarely
  outside of 120 minutes, thank god, but today, i'm clicking around the
  channels, and i hear a familar tune on the grind.  yup.  it was "can't wait
  one minute more" by civ.  these preppy wanna-be skinhead dancers are slam
  dancing, almost definally choreographed, too.  you could see that they
  planned how they would dance to this particular song.

        afterwords, the music dies out, and idalis comes on; "hey, now wasn't
  that groovey?  thats right.  that was civ with 'can't wait'.  now, after the
  commercials, we'll have a live performance from shaggy!@"

        c'mon, shaggy and civ in the same sentence?  sigh.  it just saddens
  me.  why the hell can't mtv leave the good stuff on "120 minutes"?  why must
  they do this?  they do this with every good band, and then they promote the
  bad bands, like greenday and offspring.  fuckin' assholes.

        to create a format that appeals to all, they must play what 'everyone'
  is listening to.  or so they think.  not everyone is listening to offspring
  and green day.  thats why radio stations like whtg 106.3 (eatontown, nj), do
  good; they play what other stations _aren't_ playing.  sure, they do play
  some green day and offspring, but not to the extext that many other stations
  play it.

        you have a major cable channel, and a million radio stations; all with
  the same format -- boring and "alternative".  you get a few stations that
  play what the "minority" wants to hear -- mainly indie rock and punk,
  generally "unheard" music anywhere else.  both stations do well, in their
  own aspects; they just get a different listening audience.

        in our history, many movie makers have tried to make a movie revolving
  around computer crimes, some have been successful; others have not.  the
  classics, such as wargames and sneakers, will live forever in the hearts of
  computer enthusists around the globe.  other movies, such as johnny
  mnemonic, can be written off and forgotten.

        in jonas' ever expanding cultural emphasis, we would like to give you
  now a review of the best, and worst, computer-related movies ever made.
  there have been alot of computer-related movies made, specifically, the ones
  we'll concern ourselves with are those that deal with some form of computer
  hacking and/or phone phreaking.

        now, without further ado, edicius reviews computer movies.

  "three days of the condor" (1976?) - robert redford plays an fbi agent on
  the run from his own superiors after his whole office is gun downed and
  killed while he is at lunch.  story-line is pretty good.  redford plays a
  really good part in the movie.  surpurb co-stars, also.

  as far as the computer-relatedness.  they have _really_ big computers in the
  office.  redford 'boxes' his way into a hotel phone line, and uses a tape
  recorder and dtmf decoder to figure out numbers a person is dialing.  he
  also picks a credit slip out of the garbage to figure out what a person's
  name is, before he carjacks and kidnaps them.  you cannot forget, either,
  that at one point, kevin mitnick used the handle "condor" before he went
  into hiding in the mid 80's.

  really great movie all around.  if you can find it at your local
  blockbuster, i would definally suggest renting this movie.

  rating: (out of four stars) ***1/2.

  +-- - --+

  "wargames" (1982) - matthew broderick, alley shedy, and a "whopper" of a
  computer.  (te-he.  i made a funny.)  this is the clasic computer hacker
  movie.  kid breaks into school computer, changes grades, wardials, finds
  governmental computer, and plays a game of "thermonuclear global war."  now
  is that just rad, or is it rad?

  personally, my favorite part of the movie, is when alley shedy's caracter
  says to broderick's caracter, after he has been on the run from the
  government, "is this about what you did to my grades?"  har har.

  you have hacking and phreaking in this movie.  movies just don't get cooler
  then this without having an nc-17 rating.

  rating: (out of four stars) ****

  +-- - --+

  "sneakers" (1989/1990.  one of them) - not a particulary bad movie.
  hacking, phreaking, carding, trashing, and a blind guy that can type really
  fast!@  hell, these guys are _paid_ to hack your computer, if you want them
  too.  they're the best, dE\x/D.  they're eXpERtZ.

  as i alluded to above, the only part in the movie that i was particularly
  pissed off about, is the fact that the blind dude can type.  ok.  i can see
  him typing --  they can have brail keyboards -- but how does he know what is
  being done by the computer?  it just didn't fit.

  if you want a real good flick night, rent this and "wargames" the same
  night.  watch the clerk look at you funny.

  rating: (out of four stars) ***

  "johnny nmemonic" (1995) - i really don't know where to begin with this
  movie.  i saw it with fellow cybergeeks, rattle and tut, and well, i think
  rattle sums it up best by saying, "it was the best comedy i've seen in
  awhile, but it was meant to be a drama."

  let's just say, keanu reeves shouldn't have been casted for this part.  if
  it was another actor, the movie would have been better.  keanu reeves just
  cannot act for his life.

  henry rollins got killed in the movie, that was a cool part.  :)

  rating: (out of four stars) *

  +-- - --+

  "the net" (1995) - you have to divide this one up into two different
  sections; as far as pure entertainment goes, this movie was pretty damn
  good.  _any_ movie with sandra bullock in a bikini is good in my book.  as
  far as computers go, it was a bad movie.  i did like some of the things that
  they did with the computers, tho.

  bullock is a pretty good actress.  the movie, overall, was pretty decent.
  storyline wise, it could have used some work, but still was good.  accuracy
  wise, it needed alot of work with the computers.

  if you can catch this still in the theraters (find a cheap second-run movie
  near you), definally go there and watch it.  you shalln't be disappointed.

  rating: (out of four stars) ***

  +-- - --+

  "hackers" (1995) - "boot up or shut up."  as far as the accuracy goes, this
  is one of the most accurate, if not the most accurate, 'hacker' movie in a
  long time.  it was still pretty far-fetched in some aspects, others it was
  pretty good.  some of the computers they had, of course, were too advanced,
  even for our own age.

  i've hung out with computer geeks in person, i don't think i've ever said
  the word "ELITE" as much as they did in this movie.  there is also a scene
  in which some 'haqurs' are looking at a new computer, and they say, "whoa,
  elite.  she has a brand new laptop... 16 megabytes of ram.. a 28 point 8 bps
  modem too!"

  they did make up for it by having an actual red box (that still does work in
  some areas), and by reading "the hackers manifesto" by 'the mentor'.  i was
  surprised to see them go that far.

  with everything in, i think this movie will go down as being highly regarded
  in the computer movie field as being one of the better movies of our time.

  rating: (out of four stars) ***1/2.

  +-- - --+

  other stuff:

  "disclosure" (1995) - ok, so this really isn't a true computer movie.  the
  job that michael douglas and demi moore work at, makes cd-roms and other
  computer equipment.  plus, the terminals that they use on all the computers
  for email and stuff is really rad.  i'd love to have that type of software
  on my computer.

  oh, seeing demi moore half-naked isn't bad, either.

  rating: (out of four stars) ***1/2.

  "masters of deception: the gang that ruled cyberspace" (1995) - it's a book.
  not a fully accurate book, but it is an interesting read.  i shelled out 20
  bucks for it, i'm not sure if it was really worth it, but it is worth the
  read if you can get it.

  rating: (out of four stars) **

  +-- - --+

        i noticed something, something eerie.  in "the net", they all drink a
  martini-type drink called a "gibson".  in "hackers", the name of the big
  mainframe operating system, is "gibson".  coincidence?  maybe.

  have courage!  life is so much easier when you're out of the closet.  i'm
  coming out because i went to the l.a. gay & lesbian parade this past summer
  and of the more than 700,000 people there i personally counted fewer than 80
  in drag or leather or other outrageous get ups.

  when i turned on the news that night it was like my personal count had made
  the news.  every single one of those 80 or so people.  the broadcast made it
  seem like a couple thousand people had shown up, and showing only those in
  drag or leather made it seem like that's all that showed up, like that's all
  there is to gays and lesbians.  the other 700,000 to 800,000 of us who are
  boring and average didn't make it onto the tv.

  when you come out you give non-gay people and accurate picture and concept of
  who and what gays and lesbians really are.  since it's perfectly legal in 44
  states to fire us from our jobs or evict us from our homes just for saying
  we're gay or lesbian, coming out is a very difficult thing to do.  i know
  that, and i have experienced all the fear and anxiety you have.  please,
  please, please come out!!!  life really is so much better now.

        courtney love is being sued by a a man who says she beat him up during
  a hole concert in palo alto, calif., last year.  jonathan james hogan said
  the widow of urt cobain lured him onstage, hinting of a dance, and instead
  kicked him in the groin.  love told police that he reached under he dress
  and grabbed her crotch while she crowdsurfed above her fans.  hogan, who
  insists that he was out of grope range, says he suffered emotional stress at
  being publicly humilated.

              aclu joins high school discord over 'oi' vs. 'oy'

        newark -- three hasbrouck heights high school students who were
  suspended from school for using a word some people interpreted as
  anti-semitic were reinstated yesterday pending an appeal before the school
  board, said david rocah, staff attorney for the american civil liberties
  union of new jersey.

        rocah said the suspensions where ilegal and that he was surprised the
  school board was continuing to pursue them.

        "there's no doubt in our minds that a violation of the students'
  rights, under the federal and state constitution and state law, has
  occured," rocah said.

        the school should drop the suspensions, apologize tothe students and
  clear their records, roccah said.  if neccessary, the school should provide
  the students with tutors to help them catch up in courses they missed since
  they were suspended last week.

        the three 16-year-old bous -- len longo, j.m. burr, and albert min --
  were suspended from school for a week after performing as the band utter
  confusion at a high school talent show last thursday night.

        because the music they play is sometimes call "oi", the three band
  members started yelling "oi!" to warm up the crowd.

        some people in the audience complained that "oi" was a play on the
  yiddish expression of grief, "oy vey," and was anti-semetic.

        "oi" is a gritty subcurrent of punk rock born in british garages in
  the late 1970's.  a right-wing sub-cult of "oi" includes german skinhead
  bands whose members sing about bashing black people, jews, turks and
  leftists.

        rocah said the suspensions where unjustified, especially since the
  concert was not a school-sponsored event but was part of an after-school,
  student-sponsored talent show.

        "these kids should not have been suspended," said rocah, who is
  representing one of the teen-agers, whom he declined to identify.  "students
  do not lose their free speech rights when they walk through the schoolhouse
  door."

        although the students insisted their song was not intended to be
  anti-semetic, rocah said that was not the issue.

        "speech by racists is just as protected as speech by nonracists," he
  said.

        if school officials did not respond to the teen-agers' concers, the
  students and their families could take them to court, rocah said.  there was
  no indication that would be necessary.

        "the issues here are clear.  it's not a difficult case, and it can and
  should be resolved amicably," rocah said.

        schools superintendent howard herbert did not immediately return a
  telephone message from the associated press yesterday.

        the rabbi of the borough's only synagogue said the school overreacted
  and that is actions could encourage an anti-semetic backlash.

        "it is a tempest in a teapot.  i think the punishment is definitely
  inappropriate," rabbi fredric dworkin of temple beth elohim told the record
  of hackensack.  "people make too much of an ordinary item.  the word has no
  significanes," he said.

        dworkin, who said he had received no complaints from temple members,
  said a false alamr over racism could spark the real thing.

        [oh the same topic; on "the week in rock" on mtv, for the week of
  october 21-27, they had a story about the above situation, and actually had
  the band on at the end of the show.  'utter confusion' played the <their?>
  song "oi is not a crime", now being boosted to stardom by their peers for
  appearing on mtv.  :)  they weren't all that bad, for a group of 16 year
  olds.]
