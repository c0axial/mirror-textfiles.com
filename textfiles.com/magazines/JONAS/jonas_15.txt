   (1) - Edicius' Editorial

   February 8, 1995

   Did you ever have that one special teacher in school?  The one person that
   showed a true interest in how you did?  The one who's class you did the
   best in, or at least worked the hardest in, mainly because s/he knew you
   could?

   I had that teacher, but I lost him last night.  Alot of people lost him
   last night.

   Last year, I had him for Algebra 1 Honors, and he wanted me to work really
   hard, and he worked really hard with me so I got it.  Unfortunally, I
   didn't make the right grade, so this year I was placed in Geometry B.  But
   this year, I also changed.  Every class, I would sit right in front of his
   desk.  I would pay extra attention during his class.  Most importantly, I
   had a A average in that class this year.

   When I would see him in the hallway, I would make an extra effort to say
   hi to him, and maybe talk to him.  I would go to class a few minutes
   early, because I knew he would be there to talk to, and have a nice
   conversation with.

   My sister's boyfriend had him a few years ago in school.  His family and
   his teacher's family have always been very good friends.  Subsequently, I
   paid alittle more attention to him, and was alittle bit nicer to him, then
   my other teachers.  I had a better student-teacher relationship with him
   then any other teacher I've ever had.

   One day, years and years ago, he made a choice.  He made a decision that
   he would be a teacher.  He didn't do it for the money, he was working at a
   private school and had five children, he just did it because he was
   devoted to it.  He taught at school during the day, and then he would
   tutor other kids at night.  It wasn't just a job, it was his life.

   He did this until his last day.  Last night, one of the spanish teachers
   from my school dropped her duaghter off at his house.  He was tutoring her
   in Algebra/2.  Alittle after five, he suffered a massive heartattack, and
   died before he got to the hospital.

   I heard about this a few hours later, and was very distraught.  School
   today was very somber, very solemn.  The guidance conselors were there if
   we needed to talk, and the teachers were very supportive.  Everyone you
   would talk to would have something to say about him, be it an funny story
   about him, or a familar saying, everyone was touched by him in some form
   or another.

   I do not grieve for him.  He lived his life here, and accomplished many
   things.  He would be happy knowing how many people he touched in his time
   on this earth.  He is in a better place right now, he's at peace with
   himself now.  I grieve for his family.  They do not have a father, or a
   husband there anymore, but they have the support of many.  I wish them the
   best of luck in the time ahead.

   Goodnite Mr. Rapolla.  You taught me alot.  About algebra, about geometry,
   and about myself.  You were a great teacher, and a great friend.  Even
   though our lives only intersected for such a short time, your memory will
   live in my heart forever.  Thank you Mr. Rapolla, with my entire heart.

   This issue is going to be weird.  I've been in a very lethargic/depressed
   mood the last week or two, and it may or may not show in my writing.  It
   does, however, show up in my attitude.  I'm annoyed at different things,
   things that didn't piss me off in the past.  But, I'll save that for my
   Valentine's Day rant.

   Oh, about this issue.  It may just be my perspective about things right
   now, but I can't decide if this is a good issue, or a bad issue.  I
   normally get a feel for the issue before I release it, but right now, I
   just have no idea.  Ugh.  We'll see in a few days, won't we?

   I made a few minute/major changes (it's all in your perspective of them).
   First, for those of your that dialed into a bbs and downloaded the latest
   issues, I don't have official bbs distribution sites anymore.  I still
   support the local bbses, but the Internet is giant, and I'd rather email
   the new issues of Jonas to a gazillion people, then call long distance and
   upload it somewhere.

   Anyway, there are no "official" distribution sites, but any bbs that
   carries it can call itself a Jonas e'Zine Distribution Site.  Happy now?
   Good.  The only "official" site, is the World Head Quarters.  You can
   always get the latest issue of Jonas from Avalon, reached at (908)
   739-4274.

   Also, way way back, back a few months ago.  When I released Jonas Numero
   Uno, I set one term.  That term was, "this 'zine is all me!  me me me me!
   ha ha!"  That translated to, "you can't write for it."

   I figure, I've been doing Jonas for 10 months now.  The last few months,
   I've recieved nearly nill as far as submissions go.  Belial, aka Marc
   Newman, is one of the only ones who actually has been writing anything for
   me.  So, this 'Zine is basically going to be "me, and my close knit group
   of friends."  If I like you, and you have something intellegent to write,
   maybe I'll publish it.

   Hey, I've done the last 3 or 4 issues with little outside help, and I've
   done fine with it.  So, why not continue it.  :)

   Lastly, I've jumped the ship, and become "Internet-trendy."  Yes, I've
   joined the millions of people who "web-surf", and put up my own.
   Actually, I put up three of my own.  Just a simple index page ("The
   Unofficial Homepage of Tom Sullivan"), the official Jonas page, and an
   unofficial homepage for WHTG-FM, located here in senic New Jersey.  Check
   the index page at: http://www.cybercomm.net/~edi/homepage.html, and you
   can reach all the pages.

   Have a good day.

   (2) - Chronology of the Communications Decency Act - Edicius

   Here's a timeline of events for those of you who aren't fully familar with
   the history of this very objectional bill.

   Taken from the "Campaign to Stop the Unconstitutional Communcations
   Decency Act", put out by the Voters Telecommunications Watch (vtw@vtw.org)

   Apr. 7,  1995 - Senator Leahy (D-VT) introduces S714, an alternative to
   the Exon/Gorton bill, which commissions the Department of Justice to study

   neccassary.

   May  24, 1995 - The House Telecomm Reform bill (HR1555) leaves committe in

   Jun. 14, 1995 - The Senate passes the CDA as attached to the Telecomm
   reform bill (S652) by a vote of 84-16.  The Leahy bill (S714) is not
   passed, but is supported by 16 Senators who understand the Internet.

   Jun. 21, 1995 - Several prominent House members publicly announce their
   opposition to the CDA, including Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA), Rep. Chris Cox
   (R-CA), and Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR).

   Jun. 30, 1995 - Cox and Wyden introduce the "Internet Freedom and Family
   Empowerment Act" (HR1978) as an alternative to the CDA.

   Sep. 26, 1995 - Sen. Russ Feingold urges committee members to drop
   Managers Amendment and the CDA from the Telecommunications Deregulation
   bill.

   Dec. 7,  1995 - The House half of the Telecomm conference committee votes
   the "indecency" standard for online speech into the Telecomm Deregulation
   Bill.

   Jan. 31, 1996 - The House and Senate prepare to signoff on the conference
   report for the Telecomm bill and rush a vote to the floor.

   Feb. 1,  1996 - Telecommunications Deregulation bill overwhelmingly passes
   the House 414 - 16, and passes the Senate 91 - 5.

   (3) Violation of our guarenteed rights. - Edicius
   
   [See endnotes for additional information.]

      "Whoever -- in interstate or foreign communications, by means of a
      telecommunications device knowingly .. makes, creates, or solicits, and
      initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion,
      proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd,
      lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten,
      or harass an other person .. shall be fined .. or imprisoned not more
      than two years, or both .. " -- Section 502 (1) (a)

   If a group of breast cancer patients were not allowed to discuss their
   cases with each other, would we not be mad?

   If we were not allowed to view such works as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
   paintings, would we not be outraged?

   With the passage of the telecommunications "reform" legislation
   overwhelmingly passed by Congress and signed last week by President
   Clinton, these things, and more, are now described as "indecent" material
   for online viewing.

   Our elected officials have gone out of their way to pass the most sweeping
   U.S. telecommunications bill in over 60 years, and have violated our
   Constitutional rights in the new medium of computer networking.  This bill
   contains a very vague and broad definition of what speech is unacceptable
   online, criminal prosecution, and large monetary fines, which will set off
   a tidal wave of censorship to avoid real and perceived liability.

   Internet providers will be forced to snoop and censor what their users do
   while online, so they themselves will not face criminal prosecution.
   Major corporations that have been started in the fields of Internet
   service and online publishing, which have invested large amounts of money
   into our economy, now face an Economic uncertainty.  This will lead to the
   closure of many of these buisinesses.

   The telecommunications bill encourages states to define their own
   indecency laws.  This legislation will lead to a legal tangle in the
   courts, with contradictory local regulations enforced from afar against
   providers and users in other areas.  What's legal in New Jersey, may not
   be legal in New York.

   In the future, other media will be affected by this as well.  With the
   expanse of newspaper, television, and radio, into the online communication
   field, it will become expensive to create a censored version for the
   online part, and a regular version.  Hence, this will lead to a
   combonation of the two, and a single, censored, version on all fields.

   Because of the broad definition of "indecent", the King James Bible could
   be censored for the repeated use of the word "piss" (Kings II), a word
   already defined by the Supreme Court as indecent.  A "Schindler's List"
   web site would earn an Internet service provider prison time.  Anything
   featuring nudity, in any context, including breast cancer information or
   photos of Michelangeolo's Sistine Chapel paintings, could result in the
   poster of the information facing large fines.  We face a very bleak
   future, when indecency applies to items of artistic talent, social value,
   or medical necessity.

   Part of this bill also targets prank telephone calls.  Section 502 (1) (d)
   states,

      "Whoever -- makes repeated telephone calls or repeatedly initiates
      communication with a telecommunications device, during which
      conversation or communication ensues, soley to harass any person at the
      called number or who recieves the communication; shall be fined under
      title 18 .. or imprisoned not more than two years, or both."

   Is the Internet not covered by our First Amendment right?  Do Internet
   users not have the same rights as a person walking into a bookstore?  Does
   the government have the right to pass laws without having one public
   hearing to hear what we, as American Citizens, have to say?

   Many civil liberties groups have already said no to this bill, and are
   preparing a massive legal challenge to this bill.  It is neccasary to
   protect what we, as American Citizens, are guarenteed in the First
   Amendment: The Freedom of Speech, Press, Association, Religion, and
   Petition.

   ----------

   Luckily, over the last few days, there has been a turn in the case.  For
   the best of Internet users.  U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter
   ruled in Philadelphia on Thursday, February 15, that until further notice,
   the government cannot enforce the "indecency" clause in the
   Telecommunications Reform Bill.

   He says the government must come up with a definition of indecency.  His
   research indicates that the Supreme Court never defined the word, which
   leaves many people wondering what is forbidden, and what is allowed.

   He also is hearing the cases of the ACLU, and 19 other groups who filed
   suit against this bill the days after President Clinton signed it into
   law.

   In my local area, a case has been brought to light over the last few days.
   A woman living in the town of Long Branch, NJ, started recieving letters
   from men wanting to have sex with her.

   Stephany Willman, 41, believes that her ex-boyfriend, who now lives in
   Florida, scanned and posted nude pictures of her to "several erotic
   newsgroups."  The pictures also included her address, and asked that
   lonely men write her.

   A South-Florida Internet provider, Icanet, has suspended the account of
   the poster of the pictures.  It is not known whether or not her
   ex-boyfriend is using the account, but it is suspected.  Icanet presidet,
   Bob Hurwitz said, "I caught him doing it again, and we put a cancel on his
   postings immediately."

   A man claiming to be Willman's ex-boyfriend called a local newspaper, the
   Asbury Park Press (who have been covering this story) and said, "I want to
   contact Bob Hurwitz and do anything I can to get Stephany's pictures off
   the Internet.  I'm not a computer whiz and I'm not the horrible person
   everybody thinks I am."

   Of the 3 pictures posted, only one was nude.  The other two were pictures
   of Stephany in a bikini.

   Police say that a harrassment case against Willman's ex-boyfriend remains
   open, but they will not pursue the case.  It would be impossible to get
   the main from Florida to New Jersey for a disorderly charge.  If enough
   evidence is found to prove that he really posted the pictures, then
   Florida Police would have to handle the case.

   I swear, this whole "computer" thing gets stranger by the day.

   (4) "Oh, sorry." - Edicius

   "Here's your fucking coffee, asshole," said the greasy haired fifteen
    year-old to the customer.

   "What was that you said, boy?"

   "I said, 'HERE IS YOUR FUCKING COFFEE, ASSHOLE.'"

   "Why'd you say that?"

   "Because people like you come in here all day, look down on me like you're
   better or something, order a eggs and coffee, and leave a nickel tip.
   Then you go home, for a rousing day of looking through the classifieds for
   a new job, and new parts to your '78 Ford sitting on the cynderblocks on
   your front lawn."

   "Oh, ok.  Got anymore half and half?"

   Startled, the boy said, "Uhm..  Yeah, in the back.  I'll get you some.
   "Wait, you're not mad for what I said to you?"

   "Nope.  Not at all.  I'm used to it."

   "Used to it?"

   "Yeah.  I'm James Exon, a senator from Nebraska.  You wouldn't believe how
   many people yell at me all day, all for this stupid Telecommunications
   Bill.  If I hurt you by my part in it, I'm sorry.  I just had to get back
   at those assholes on Compuserve.  If they won't let me post naked pictures
   of myself, no one can."

   "Uh.  Ok.  I'm gonna go cleanup in the kitchen now, nice meeting you."

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   (5) <Insert Generic Valentine's Day Rant Here> - Edicius

   In the past, I never really got down about Valentine's Day.  The last few
   days, however, I have gotten down about it, and alot of things.  Being
   that it's Valentine's Day and all, I figure I'll rant about love this
   issue.  It's always a fun topic to talk about, right?

   I never had a girlfriend, I've never been out on a date.  I have liked
   people, but I really like a girl right now.  But its confusing.  I've been
   told by some that she isn't right for me, that she wouldn't even go out
   with me.  But I think she is right for me, I think she's pretty, I think
   she has a good personality, but I do see the flaws in her.  Maybe I'm
   blind to certain things, maybe its just something deep-rooted in my mind
   where I think I need to like someone to be normal, maybe I'd be considered
   gay if I didn't like a girl at 16 ...

   Then again, I never really threw out the idea of being gay.

   I find that many guys, especially around my age, are very homophobic.  So,
   I play with this trait in them.  I make passes at them, jokingly of
   course, and make jokes about bestiality and incest.  But there is a point
   where I crossed the joking phase.  I said to a friend recently, "I'm gay,"
   and then continued the conversation without a grin or anything.  It seems
   so casual to say it.  Why not just bypass the whole girl phase, and just
   go gay. Better yet, I'll just remain single for my life.

   Back to the girl I like.

   I've been told I should ask her out, but I never get the nerve to.  Maybe
   if I really, truely, liked her, then maybe I would ask her out.  But I
   have doubts at time.  I never had a girlfriend yet, but right now I'm
   looking for the perfect girl to go out with.  So, sometimes I think that
   maybe the whole reason I like her is because I don't like anyone else, and
   she's the only one who I have a remote liking to, and it just becomes that
   much bigger because of it.  (Did you follow me there?)

   .. and that all goes back to the deep-rooted feelings about being gay and
   things like that.

   I want to find a girl that I can have a deep love with.  Not someone who's
   love is superficial, but someone who is intellectual & funny, not to
   mention pretty.  It's the typical thing a guy looks for.  I'm not looking
   for sex.  I wouldn't mind it, but that's still way back in my mind.

   I never experienced "love" first hand, so I may go on like a flaming
   hyprocitical idiot.  I see people and how they profess their "love" and
   how great it is, but then a time comes and they break up, and then see how
   silly & fake their "love" was.

   Sometimes I feel alienated and different because I never felt love.  I
   never felt the emotions that come with it, be it happiness or sadness.
   I'm most happy that I've never experienced the sadness that goes along
   with love, but I don't think I've ever truely been happy.

   I've been happy, but there just seems to be an intoxicating happiness that
   accompanies love.  It's just a different type of happiness, that you can't
   reach without love ..

   .. or so it seems.

   As I said, I've never really felt love.

   I made a vow to myself, to ask the girl that I really like right now out
   by the end of the school year.  "Babysteps", just like Bill Murrary said
   in _What About Bob?_.  So, within the next few months, I will, or will
   not, have a girlfriend.  Whether or not I have one, I at least asked her
   out.

   Wish me luck.  :)

   (6) Particle man vs. Universe man: The Great Debate - Edicius

   Recently, on the They Might Be Giants mailing list, a very important
   question was raise: who would win in a fight between Particle Man and
   Universe Man.  (Two characters in the TMBG song, "Particle Man.")

   Now, you must consider all sides of this great debate.  Let's analyze the
   lyrics, and find the deeper meaning:

      Universe man, Universe man / Size of the entire universe man / usually
      kind to smaller man / Universe man

   Now, according to this, Universe man is the size of the entire universe
   and he is kind to smaller men.  Knowing that, Particle Man must be smaller
   then him and Universe man must be nice to him.  Does that mean that
   Universe man is instantly nice to him, and Particle man wins by default?

   .. or do they fight?  In this case, let's look into the fight a bit.

   Universe man is big, he's the entire universe.  The universe is infinate.
   Does that mean that Universe man's size is neverending?  Then where is he?
   Is he above us?  or below us?  Are we him?  Are we _on_ him?

   Particle man is small, but he might have the speed, but we're not sure.
   Back to the lyrics,

      Particle man, particle man / Doing the things a particle can / What's
      he like? / It's not important

   They never tell us what he can do, but he should be fast.  He's small and
   compact, like a particle.  So, let's say he's fast.

   Now, we have the universe, versus a miniscule particle.  Albeit, a fast
   particle.  I'd put my money on Universe man here.  I mean, he is really
   big, a gajillion times the size of Particle man.  His reach must be
   amazing.  He could stand really far back, and never get touched by
   Particle man.  Alittle lobsided.  The Vegas bookmakers would put this in
   favor of Universe man.

   But, there is one chance for Particle man.  What if he catches Universe
   man while he's in happy land.  Back to the lyrics,

       Universe man / He's got a watch with a minute hand, / millennium hand
       and an eon hand / when they meet it's a happy land.

   We don't know how often he's in happy land, because we don't know how
   often the minute, millennium, and eon hands all coincide.  There still is
   that chance that Particle man could come up with an upset.  Buster Douglas
   did it!

   But wait, what if we turn this into a tag team match?  Triangle man and
   Person man could team up with Particle man.

   Maybe, maybe not.

       Triangle man / Triangle man / Triangle man hates particle man / They
       have a fight / Triangle wins / Triangle man

   Triangle is stronger then Particle man, so that's an advantage for the
   Particle man/Triangle man combonation, but there's one key element that
   we're missing here: cooporation!  "Triangle man hates particle man."  They
   can't get along.  Too much friction!

   What about Person man?

      Triangle man / Triangle man / Triangle man hates person man / They have
      a fight / triangle wins / triangle man

   After this fight, that puts Person man on or about the same level as
   Particle man.  They both lost in a fight to Triangle man, and they both
   must be bitter about it.  They could team up!

   No they couldn't.  Person man is a very bitter man.

      Person man, person man / hit on the head with a frying pan / lives his
      life in a garbage can / Person man / is he depressed or is he a mess? /
      does he feel totally worthless / who came up with Person man? /
      degraded man, person man

   Person man is too bitter at life to team up with anyone.  Look, first,
   he's hit in the head with a fuckin' frying pan.  I don't know about you,
   but I'd be a tad pissed about that.  Then, he lives in a garbage can!  I
   mean, we're not talking about Oscar the Grouch here, he's really living in
   a garbage can here.

   Conclusion -

   Particle man could fight Universe man, but he'd get his ass kicked.  With
   no help of joining forces, there's really no hope for Particle man.  Pity
   him.

   Triangle man fighting Universe man?  Well, I'd still put my money on
   Universe man here.  He's just huge.

   eZINE: E-Weezer - Volume 2, Edition 5

   Now this is the ultimate in 'Zines for the Weezer fanatic, like myself.
   Every issue, a new one comes out almost every week, is packed with the
   newest in information about Weezer, and related bands.  Including, The
   Rentals, That Dog, Space Twins, Spain, and 9 Iron.

   This issue, released February 15th, has a review of That Dog's concert at
   Whiskey A Go-Go in Hollywood.  It also introduces and gives information
   about Space Twins (Brian Bell from Weezer's side project), Spain (Petra
   and Rachel Haden from That Dog's brother's band :)), and 9 Iron (The side
   project of Tony Maxwell from That Dog).  There is also a good article
   about bootlegging of concerts.

   They even mention Jonas in this issue, too.  :)

   I highly suggest that you check this 'Zine out, it really has alot of
   information.  Tour dates, rumors, concert updates, everything you possibly
   need to know about Weezer and related bands.

   eZINE: I Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star - Issue 19

   This e'Zine is the side project of Jen Jurgens (aka BlackPope7), the
   editor of Moderate Rock E'Zine (see review in Jonas 14).  This 'Zine comes
   out between issues of ModRock, and is very good.

   This issue contains a very interesting comparision of television to music.
   Her article, "Why Rock Music Is Like Television" compares the Fox Network,
   to bands like Bush, Offspring, and "The Presidents of the United States of
   Bands With Too Many Words in Them For Anyone to Say Their Name Without
   Being Forced to Take 3 or 4 Breaths."  CBS = Classic Rock?  The list goes
   on and on.  Amazing, eerie coincidences between music and televsion!

   Remember Alf?  I'm sure you do.  Did you ever stop and think exactly what
   Alf meant to us?  What he taught us?  If you didn't, you'll learn now.
   Alf taught us alot, and Jen tells us exactly what it is he taught.

   This 'Zine, coupled with Moderate Rock E'Zine, is one of my favorite
   'Zines that I read regularly.  Jen puts alot of work in this, and has a
   very unique style of writing.  This 'Zine is a must read.

   (7) The End

   I hope you enjoyed this issue.  Please send all comments, be it good or
   bad, to edi@cybercomm.net.  Pass the word of Jonas around, I'll love you
   for it.

   Oh, also, the next issue of Jonas will be coming out on April 1.  Yes, I'm
   totally skipping March.  In 42 days, there will be a new issue.  The
   reason for this is simple: April 1 is the one year anniversary for Jonas.
   Yes, that's right.  For one whole year, I've been geeking out on this damn
   computer, improving my writing, and bringing Jonas to you.

   I could rush, make a quick issue, and then do the big one year
   anniversary issue.  Then the big one year anniversary issue would become a
   "not-so big one year anniversary issue."

   God, who would have thought?  A year ago, I put out 4 issues in 8 days.
   Now, I can't do 2 issues in 42 days.  :)

   I will be emailling and contacting alot of different people for special
   things I'm doing for the next issue.  I will (hopefully) have a really big
   surprise in the next issue.  Just wait, you'll be happy.

   I'll stop the tangent here.  I'll see you in 42 days.  I'll be a stronger
   and wiser man.  I'm going to see Spacehog in a week!  I hope you enjoyed
   this issue.  Have a great day.  See you April 1st.
