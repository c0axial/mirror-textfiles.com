        here is a survey for everyone to fill out.  it's our first annual best
  of the year awards, for the year, duh, 1995.  it mainly concerns itself with
  music, but it does go into some other categories.  you get the jist of it.

        after you're through filling it out, rename it <your handle/first
  name>.sur, and send it to me via a way listed in jonas_13.nfo.

        thanks alot!@
