     Welcome to the 1st issue of a new group called the News of Freedom
(NoF). Our goal is to search through major newspapers & magazines from
around the country for articles about phreaking, hacking and computer
systems which will benefit the elite community in general. We then 
copy the important parts of the articles and copy them here and then we
provide any commentary if needed. So here we go & I hope you like this!

   The following is taken from the New York Times, Business Section,
                        February 10, 1994
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      As long-distance telephone companies continue their pitched battle to 
capture customers and cut costs, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company
said yesterday that it would cut as many as 15,000 jobs, or 15% of the work
force, in its core long-distance business during the next two years...The
move comes as the nation's biggest long-distance carrier continues to lose
market share to MCI and Sprint, and the industry explots new technologies to
cut costs. The new round of cuts is intended to reduce management in a bid 
to trim AT&T's bureaucracy. All the cuts are in the long-distance business,
and about half of them will be in the management ranks. Roughly a third of
the people to be laid off work in and around the company's headquarters in
Basking Ridge, N.J....
      During the last year, the long-distance revenues of the company 
increased by only 1.5%, compared with the industry average of nearly 5%...
But the competitive pressure is expected to increase during the next
several years, particularly if Congress passes legistlation that permits 
the reginal Bell companies to enter the long-distance market. And new
technologies are allowing long-distance telephone companies to operate
with fewer people....
      AT&T has stedily cut more than 100,000 jobs since its monopoly over 
long-distance service was broken by the Federal Government 10 years ago, 
and it is cutting 6,000 telephone operators and 7,500 workers at NCR. 
AT&T employs 309,000 people, of which 96,500 work in the long-distance 
business. The remainder are in manufacturing, research and other 
businessess....
      Company executives said they would begin to notify the company's 
departments about pending layoffs by March 1, and individuals in April.
The first departures are to take place in June and proceed over the following
18 months. The reductions mark the biggest move since Mr. Mandl and his team
took control of the long-distance business last July. Since then, the 
company has dismissed the advertising agency Ayer Inc., which designed
its distastrous "i plan" campaign, added a raft of new marketing people
and tried to react more swiftly to new marketing salvos from MCI.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   First of I would like to congratulate all those phreakers out there who
have been doing such a great job! You have reduced AT&T's profit, maybe
now they'll learn....not! Second, this is great news as there should be
less operators to bug us and more dumb computers to hack. I must warn you
though, that you might be doing too good a job: we don't want AT&T to go
out of business as then we'd have to phreak with other companies & as you
all know, it's not as safe. Ok, well I hope that this was informative.
Good luck to everyone and look out for our next news file soon!
