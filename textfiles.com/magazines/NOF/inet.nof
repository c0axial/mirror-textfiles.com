       COMPUTER SECURITY EXPERTS SEE PATTERN IN INTERNET BREAK-INS.

    Computer security experts say they now believe that a recent rash of 
break-ins on the global Internet web of computer networks was an organized
effort to crack the security of the world's busiest computer systems. But
they remain baffled by the motives of the unknown intruders, who stole tens
of thousands of passwords...
    Mr. Gary, whose federally financed group sent a warning to all network
administrators on the Internet a week ago, said the break-ins apparently 
began sporadically last summer on isolated computers. But recently, the 
assault intensified, turning to computers that were strategic gateways to
the Internet. One such computer was operated by Panix of New York City, a
major Internet service provider. Panix reported that some 300 other computers
were compromised as a result of the security breach in the Panix computer...
    The warning came on Feb.3, after response team officals recognized a
surge in break-in reports from companies known as Internet service providers.
There are an estimated 500 service providers in the United States. Each acts
as a gateway to the Internet for as few as a dozen or as many as 10,000 or
more customers...Security experts said that all Internet users should
immediatley change their passwords and make a habit of doing so frequently...
    "There are about 50 people who really have the capacity to defeat the
system," Mr. Gary of the response team said. "At least, that's the number
we get from our friends in law enforcement and investigative agencies.
Those are the ones who have the skill, the desire, the energy and the 
persistence to go after the network until they get the job done." 
    Perhaps more troubling is that there is NO apparent motive for the 
attacks. Officals of the response team said there had been no reports of
intruders using stolen information for the malicious or criminal activities.
"The analogy is someone going around the neighborhood collecting keys to all
the houses," said James C, Settle, supervisory special agent for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Computer Crime Squad in Wash.
"They're probably not going to all that effort just to collect all those
keys. We would expect they're going to do something."

    Well it appears that the Feds really don't have a clue whose doing
these break-ins, so we're safe for now, but I warn all of you to be extra
careful as they're expecting something...I just hope that people really
don't change their passwords, because then we'll just have to do it all 
over again. That's all & remember you get your latest issue of NOF at your
favorite H/P board.
