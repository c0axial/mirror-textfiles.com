                        The Visitor

Spacecraft to base...
I send you this message although I know that you shall not receive it for
2000 years. I have returned to Sol 3 and I have found the conditions that
we expected to find. my report and data follows....

On the day of my arrival I observed that the planet's atmosphere had
changed drastically. It had become polluted and radioactive.
On the second day I sent a probe down to the eastern section.
the probe showed me video of nothing but dead bodies all around.
On the third day I took the ship down to what had been a major city, I found
no life of any kind there at all.
On the fourth day I landed in the western section where I found one of the
natives of this poor world. I was surprised that he did not fear me.
The only thing he said was:'this in my country commie,get out!!' Then he died.
On the fifth day I had to stay in orbit and de-radiate my self.
On the sixth day I landed in one of the few non radioactive areas on the
planet.What a change! There was plant life blooming and animal life around.
It was here that I met more natives, but this time they were very friendly!
Useing my computer as a translator we talked:
There were only a few of them left I found out. They were all dieing of
radiation sickness. It seem that although this section of Sol 3 was some what
free of radiation there was still enough of it around to kill them.
One of them asked me if I could take them with me when I left here.
I told them that this was unusual for me to do,but that if they would help me
gather data on this planet then I could take one male and one female child
with me,so that their race could continue anew someplace else.
They agreed....
On the seventh day I had filled the data banks full of information about this
planet and it's two atomic wars.
It was time for me to leave,so I gathered the two Children that had been
selected and I took off...

So this concludes my report. The children are in hibernation and I am in
transit to Xignis X6 to drop the two young colonists.
