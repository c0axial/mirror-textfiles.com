                           The Homerun for Heaven
When I was a boy the first thing I learned was that summer wasn't just summer,
it was baseball and that baseball is the Chicago Cubs!

My Grandmother was a great Cubs fan! She would sit and watch all the games on
TV even though she couldn't hear them.She would cheer them on or cuss them out.
She had her heroes and her villains,and sometimes the were one and the same!

Later on,when she moved into the nursing home my parents gave her a orange
television set so she could watch her beloved Cubs.
Oh the Cubs,the losers. Not a title in over 30 years!
Yet how devoted she was to her beloved Cubs!

So for the last few years of her life she cheered on her Cubs and never saw
them win a title.

My grandmother is gone now..
The Cubs are winning now..
So last night as her beloved Cubs were on the way to winning their division
a old patched together orange television set sat switched on in the other
room ,although nobody here was watching it. On that television set were the
Cubs,and they were winning!!
Here I had kept a old promise to myself,and I am very sure that from heaven
my grandmother was looking down into that room and she was smiling!

What is this,the voice in my head? I thought you were dead?!?
Why are you back? Did some one possibly give you the sack?
What is this you say? You are sorry that you have been away?
How could this be? You say that when you left you took away the real me?
Although you might be right. For recently my days have felt like the night!
And what had happened to my Joy of being an overgrown boy?
And where has gone the wonder that sometimes caused a small blunder?
And ,most of all where has gone that sense of love,that greeted me like a dove?
Oh yes I now see,You have returned the very real me!
Oh voice in my head,I'm glad that you are not dead!!!

                                    Sandman

Please hold my hand,said Hillery to the sand.
I can not hold your hand said the sand for I have no shape or life!
Then I shall make you into the shape of a man,said Hillery.
For the next twelve hours Hillery sculpted her man.
Then at 11:59pm she was done and she said: Please hold my hand.
To which the sand replied:I now have shape but still no life!!
Then as the clock began to strike midnight she said:THEN I WILL YOU TO LIFE!!!!
Moonlight glittered and shimmered on top of Hillery's Sandman.
Then he began to move,and he opened his eyes and sat up!!!!
He looked at his new hands AND body.
Please hold my hand said Hillery to her sand.
He looked at her and he saw her hand AND body.
He held her hand and he drew her close for a kiss.
They kissed and she melted into his strong arms.
They kissed and kissed ...
Bodies as one they moved and moved.
Their moans filled the night air.
As they lay there,all spent the clock began to chime out 3:00am.
Please hold my hand said Hillery to her sand.
Hold her hand he did as the chimeing stopped
Then as the moonlight faded,the Sandman changed back to sand!
As Hillery cried,her Sandman slipped through her fingers,again.
