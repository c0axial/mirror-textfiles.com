                                 In The Corner
  In the July issue of this column I re-printed a poem that had originally been
featured in a audio play series back in 1977.
I have received numerous requests for more of the same. Well, you asked for it!
  This month I am re-printing almost all of the poems featured in the H.S.
Series. There are a few that I have omitted, either because they were...uh...
not so great or because they no longer exist. (I have a TERRIBLE memory!)
I do have a list of all the poems and the episode they were featured in.
This list and then the poems follows.
                                                       Kevin

                                  The Touch

She looks at me and she holds my hand.
I see her eyes, the message is clear, and with this message there is a question
that I somehow understand. I know the answer, I answer in a gentle embrace.
Not a word has been spoken but we both know that we are in love, and love needs
no words!

Love does come, flying gently like the dove.
Love for you, for love is you! Oh but is it true?
Is it love for me or is it love for he?
Which love can it be?

Sing me a song, make it full of love and make it long.
Sing me a song, let it be full of you, let it be full of me.
Sing me a song, let it tell of hope for you, let it tell of hope for me.
Sing me a song, so we can see...
So we can see a better world for you and me!!

                           Where Is The World That Was

Remember the fun and jokes? Where have they gone? Remember when love and life
was simple? Where is that simplicity now? Remember when the answers to all our
problems came from out of the blue? Where are those answers now? Oh where is
the world that was? Have I lost it forever? Is the real world nothing but
heartache and pain?
I think not, I think that we all must make our own worlds from within
ourselves. Yes and when we do this, the world that was shall be again!

                            The Monster of Our Minds

The monster is deep, the monster is cruel.
The monster is no man, the monster is true.
He engulfs your mind and your heart too!
He makes it sure that the love you need won't see you through!
He remembers the then, but he blocks out the now.
He makes it sure that you won't guess how.
Yes the monster is deep, the monster is cruel.
But can't you see girl, the monster is you!

                                The Glisten

We stand before and about each other.
Stage which our feet walk so gently across.
Not-cry my love. For hands in hands hold holy in Gods glove.
Twinkle goes your eyes. Now not is time but none for lies.
Troubles go, come, and go then upon- lives which, like ours, will see many
more.
I see into the tears that fall cheek upon face that is beautiful.
Know as do I that force mighty as this our love shall hold together all.
The tears that glisten on your cheek's shall time, in time, stop.
Futures bright as now but then predicted are bright, too bright to have now
stopped by these things of unneedness.
These words are not to now needed.
For meaning is understood now and forever.
I love you.

                              Lonely is the Hunter

He is one where there once was two.
He is up, she is down.
He is the clown!

She is up, but yet she is high.
Don't you worry now, for he will soon fly.
Yes he will fly to the never, never land where the palms are high to the sky.
Yes, and once there the hunter will die!

Gone, is the huge show.
Gone, your way.
Gone, my way.
Gone!
