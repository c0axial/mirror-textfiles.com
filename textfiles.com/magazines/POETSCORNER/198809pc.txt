                                     Thank's

For the light and the night.
For my heart which still beats as thought it is a art.
For love and the white turtle dove.
For my sight and for that dove's gift of flight.
But, most of all, thank's fgor my life, which I shall play as if it were a fife!

Little lovely one: See the squirrel gather his nuts.
Little lovely one: See that squirrel climb the tree.
Little lovely one: See the bird in that tree.
Little lovely one: See that bird fly into the sky.
Little lovely one: See the sky.
Little lovely one: See the bright sun in the sky.
Little lovely one: See the world that the sun lights
Little lovely one: See the love in the world.
Little lovely one: Don't forget it!

                            Today is the Day

Today is the day, a day of happiness instead of sadness.
Today is the day, a day of peace instead of war.
Today is the day, a day of love instead of hate.
Today is the day, a day of looking ahead instead of behind.
Today is the day, the day of the future!
