                               (author's notes)

This month we feature three short short poems which differ in both subject
matter and form.
Only one of the poems has any rhyme at all. The other two use other methods to
convey their messages.
I hope you enjoy them!

Oh, isn't it true that the longer we live the faster time flies?
It seems such a long time ago that I last gazed into your soft blue eyes.
It was a time of excitement, a time of true to yourself lies!
When we would sneak into the projection room and then share our sighs!

On the street of no where a young woman travels the route of dead ends.

On the street of decay a woman breast feeds her baby. At least the child has
some food.

A boy runs out the broken store window. He has enough food for tonight.

A dog whines as it tries to find shade on the hottest day of the year.

In a quiet moment she almost cries when she thinks about what she must do to
live.

An old man looks out his window. He sees all this. As he has seen it for many
years. A tear falls down his cheek as he pulls the trigger on the gun.

                                    Misty
Time in the past tense.
   A place called school which was high.
Her not name was Misty.
   I am but was the Keykeeper.
Light sparkled off her hair-blonde.
   We danced on stage.
We danced in life.
   Time spent, but still being payed for.
Mistylover still is now.
