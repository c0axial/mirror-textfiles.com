                            A Return to Magic

It happened in the year of 1977. This was a year that did not rhyme with
Heaven! Things started to get grey, for the sunshine began to fade away! Then
in the month of June it was done...MAGIC WAS DEAD!

He had a name that rhymed with seven and even before this he had doubts about
Heaven. He rode up and down the streets on a black bicycle shouting the
news.'Magic is dead, dead is magic!' As he shouted, the few virgins left bowed
their heads and began to sob! Dispair spread through the world and all things
of beauty disappeared, and things of grey replaced them! For now was the
beginning of unreal realities...

It was in the year of the three that she came to be! She appeared in front of
the one whose name rhymed with seven. Startled he said 'Who can this be? Who is
this whose eyes burn bright with fire?' She said nothing, but she walked over
to the window and opened it. In through the window flew a white dove. The dove
landed on her out stretched hand. She walked over to the one whose name rhymed
with seven and she said:'See the dove of beauty and light? See the dove of
happiness not fright? Hold the dove and my hand,and your life will be no longer
bland!' So he reached out his hand and took hold of hers. Then there was a
giant flash of light,of all colors..even white. They all three,the dove the
woman and he, were as one. Yes it was the return of magic!

All around them the beautiful things of the world began to reappear!
Butterflies,birds, and love! Lips on lips, flesh on flesh, magic upon magic!!
Yes magic has been re-born. Now is the time for real realities,realities of
love!

                           The Touch

She looks at me and she holds my hand.
I see her eyes, the message is clear, and with this message there is a question
that I somehow understand. I know the answer, I answer in a gentle embrace.
Not a word has been spoken but we both know that we are in love, and love needs
no words!

                         The Three and Me
The three an me drive as far as one can see.
We go here, we go there, never with time to spare.
Up the hill, down the road don't you know we feel so bold.
To the fire in the night, a feeling so dark but yet a light so bright.
Time flies so fast. Don't you know that it's time for us to go.
The three and me drive as far as one can see:
See what we are to be!
