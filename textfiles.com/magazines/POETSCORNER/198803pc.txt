                          PARTY GIRL

Stand behind the counter, party girl.
Wave that long blonde hair with many a curl.
Smile that smile giggle and laugh.
As you listen to my jokes which are oh so daft!
Could we, I wonder, have a dance?
Or would that be taking to much of a chance?
Yes, wave that long blonde hair with many a curl.
As we, just us, take to the dance floor to give it a whirl!

                           See
Me, I am me.
See, I can see.
Time is a word and a word is just a word.
Love is just a word, but for me it is the gentle bird.
On white, satin wings it dose fly, but why dose it always fly by?
See, I can see.
See, I see me.
But why is it not she that I see with me?!

                       Chapter's End

We are each different,yet we are so much alike! You with your
painting,me with my poems!

What beauty I see in your mind! What colors and hues!
Finish your still-life,on black velvet with blues!
Oh me? I write my stories and rhymes,I write them so much
that some say it should be one of the crimes!

I know that your leaving is soon,sad I will be one that
day dose loom! But don't stop,go on! It's your turn to be the swan!

Being a writer I am used to the chapter's end
But that dose not mean that I am no longer a friend!!
Chapter's end is here,time to start the next!
Don't worry for I will not be vexed!
For each day gives us the chance to start again!
But will you remember me in years marked ten?
For I will remember you,until my life is through!!!
