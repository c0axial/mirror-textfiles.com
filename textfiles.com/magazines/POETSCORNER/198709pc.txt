                       CHANGES
                  (By Kevin Keyser)

CHANGES:
A snowflake meets the early spring's sun,and melts.
CHANGES:
A raindrop falls upon her face,already full of tears.
CHANGES:
Tears stop and loneliness ends as he returns.
CHANGES:
Smiles anew as they walk in the cool spring sunlight.
CHANGES:
The weeds of insecurity die,the flowers of love blossom.
CHANGES:
Two who are alone become one,and begin another.
CHANGES:
A snowflake meets the early spring's sun and melts.....

                             They
                        (By Kevin Keyser)
They are the 'in' crowd, Is that reason to be proud?
They have all the money that they need, but yet no water to start the seed.
They have everything that money can buy, but why does she cry?
They have hearts of gold, isn't that being bold?
They have everything that can be, but still they can not see.
They can not see a love like you and me.
Let the fools be!
