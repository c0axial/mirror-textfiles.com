August 18th...in a club on the smart side of town. Preteen punk grundge
wannabees are climbing out of their parent's BMW's to go inside one of the
shittiest clubs the world has ever known. Inside are the scum of the earth, the
creme of the crop, and the genetic inbred mutants of Catawba (see issue 1).
Music and bass blare alternative music while neon lights the faces of all
inside. No one dances here, they just sit and listen. Every five minutes like
clockwork one of the muties in the corner shouts PEARLJAM. I could only assume
it was the only word he could say. The creature wore an old budwiser t-shirt
covered in stains. He was basically furless except for a thin patch of red
sticking out from under his hat. It was here that I found nirvana. The energy
in the room was terrific, why? Because no one was using it!!! Meanwhile a
shirtless guitarist with a Dr. Seuss hat on was yelling Ambulance. Soon the
mutant in the corner had learned another word and the band toyed him with it
. AMBULANCE.... amboo lance! AMBULANCE..... Ambahl lence!! Ambulance....
Ambull hands!!! The ritual became a song as the band got into the groove of
this impromptu jam session. The name of the band was EVERYMAN, a must see.
They really know how to toy with a mutie. Anyway it was at this point that I
realised what the net was missing! We have no clubs like this in cyberspace.
No sound, no music, no culture (or lack of it). How can cyberpunks exsist
in the matrix without punk? Wheres the 200,000 whats of kick-ass on the net.
When was the last time your adrenaline got pumping in the matrix. Anyway
the point to all this is that I thought it was really neat when the guy got
up and said... "If you have Xs on your hands then you are being watched and
the man at the door has been paid lots of money to cause bodily harm." The
mutie just yelled PEARLJAM.
                                                          S.I.N.ERGY

That was the story..... moving on to activism......

In an interview lately Lord Gibson said that Cyberpunk was changing into
something else... what that 'else' is is hard to see. Where are the punks
headed. It is time to unite, or at least make sure we are headed somewhere!
Ok, issue #1, the "Corp". A.k.a the "system" or the "man". This social
operating system is long overdue for an upgrade. We all know that. That's
partially why we exsist here (c-space v1.0). So how do we "Shock the System".
It has to be a technollogically advanced operation, to suit our style.
I believe it should also be PASSIVE ('cause that's more annoying!).

I don't think operandi like Froggi's Armi are going to do much good. As we
all know any system needs funds, and jobless people don't get funds -unless
they are VERY resourcefull. So what do we do?

In the mists of the evolution of the net, such as the City interface, and
cyberspace.com, the time for action is now. I smell the need for a conference
soon, a REAL cyberpunk conference.....

Let's see your input.

       Forgotten youth goes untold . The radio plays on . The wipers go
back and forth as I hurtle down the eight lane . Back and forth . Jessicca
lies beside me in the passenger seat . Her breath is deep and relaxed for
the first time in days . The wipers go back and forth . Back and forth .
The rain continues to fall from the sky as if a mad god or a forgotten
promise . The wipers go back and forth .
       Angry and agnst ridden figures scream of their fate and the radio
plays on . Sitting behind me is Kris, huddled in a thick wool blanket, her
eyes shut . She shudders as if cold, then is still again . The wipers go
back and forth and the radio plays on .
       I signal to turn and then begin to slow as I enter the town .
Darkness . The pale illumination of neon . The rain pouring down upon
us, and the wipers go back and forth . Back and forth . The song from the
radio reminds me of the summer . The hopes that once were, are no more .
The sun that once filled me with warmth is no where in sight . I pull into
a parking lot next to what might have been a movie theatre in a past time .
I see no lights coming from the building . Broken glass .
       I gently wake Jessicca from her slumber . Her pale skin looks grey
and blue in the light coming from a flickering streetlamp in the distance .
      "Where are we Mark ?"
      "Were safe for now, help me get Kris ."
      I slip the keys out of the ignition and turn off the headlights . The
rain pelts against the car .

LC MARVEL is the Library of Congress' experimental Campus-Wide Infor-
mation System which uses Gopher software.  LC MARVEL offers access to
informational files about the Library of Congress, the ability to
search and retrieve information in those files, and connections to 
a wide variety of Internet resources.  Initially, only 10 simultaneous
connections will be available for direct TELNET connection from exter-
nal sites (with the exception of the US Congress).  However, it is     
possible to connect to this system using Gopher client software or
through another Gopher server (the 10-user limit does not apply to these
access methods).  For Gopher access, point to MARVEL.LOC.GOV, port 70.
Clearly, the Library of Congress bears no responsibility for the qual-
ity of information provided through other sites.

Want to Reach Bill Clinton? Try president@whitehouse.gov              Jun 1

  Washington, D.C. -- The Internet community now possesses one of the most
direct methods of contacting President Bill Clinton: electronic mail.
  The White House Tuesday said it is now receiving e-mail through the
Internet. The president can be reached at president@whitehouse.gov; Vice
President Al Gore's address is vice.president@whitehouse.gov.
  Clinton and Gore notified the public about the new service through a
letter posted on the Internet as the president traveled to Milwaukee, Wisc.,
to sell his economic program.
  "Today, we are pleased to announce that for the first time in history, the
White House will be connected to you via electronic mail," the letter said.
"Electronic mail will bring the presidency and this administration closer and
make it more accessible to the people.
  "As we work to reinvent government and streamline our processes, the e-mail
project can help to put us on the leading edge of progress," Clinton and
Gore said in the letter.
  According to the Washington Post, Clinton staffers have said they were
appalled to find after Inauguration Day that the White House still used
operators plugging lines into switchboards -- a technology tht is considered
hopelessly outmoded by many.
  Clinton first made use of the electronic mail system as a candidate,
aides said, but this was the first time the White House had been connected
to the electronic mail system.
  In making the announcement, Clinton also indicated that connections will
begin soon in the House of Representatives, as well as at various government
agencies.
  The White House will be accepting the letters, acknowledging their receipt
and keeping track of the subject. But so far there will be no electronic
response to individual letters.
  "We must be realistic about the limitations and expectations of the White
House electronic mail system," the letter said. "This experiment is the
first-ever e-mail project done on such a large scale."
  Messages will be read by the White House correspondence staff, with the
same priority as paper letters. A sampling will be shown to Clinton and
Gore, who made White House e-mail a personal priority.
  "It just depends on who has a lucky day that day and gets picked," Lynda
Rathbone, coordinator of public access e-mail, told the Post.
  The White House hopes to be able to respond to individual letters
electronically by the end of the year.
  "We eagerly anticipate the day when electronic mail from the public is an
integral and normal part of the White House communications system," Clinton
and Gore wrote. "This is an historic moment in the White House, and we look
forward to your participation and enthusiasm for this milestone event."
  The White House already had addresses with three commercial e-mail
services. Through them, it was receiving as many as 5,000 messages a week.
  But it wasn't truly an electronic connection. The services collected
messages on computer floppy disks, which they sent by mail or courier to the
White House. The new system provides for electronic delivery the whole way.

There is some concern in the administration that Clinton's own computer
will be an inviting target for hackers.

  "We do not want people constantly bombarding our system with attempts to
break in," Rathbone told the Post. "We're taking the necessary security
precautions."

     Thank you for sending in your thoughts and comments to the
President via electronic mail.  We are pleased to introduce this
new form of communication into the White House for the first time
in history.  I welcome your response and participation.

     As we work to reinvent government and streamline our
processes, this electronic mail experiment will help put us on
the leading edge of progress.  Please remember, though, this is
still very much an experiment.

     Your message has been read, and we are keeping careful track
of all the mail we are receiving electronically.  We will be
trying out a number of response-based systems shortly, and I ask
for your patience as we move forward to integrate electronic mail
from the public into the White House.

     Again, on behalf of the President, thank you for your
message and for taking part in the White House electronic mail
project.

                            Sincerely,

                        Marsha Scott, Deputy Assistant
                        to the President and Director
                         of Correspondence
