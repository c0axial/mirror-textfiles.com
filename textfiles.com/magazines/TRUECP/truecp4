  Janie looked up to her Father, repressing the sorrow that she always
  held so tight inside of her. "Father, tell me a story". "Okay", says
  he, grabbing an old fax from the floor and slipping on his decrypt-tek
  glasses. "Be very quiet". Janie smiled on the inside, she'd been waiting
  a long time for this.
  "Okay", says he again. "This is how it goes..."

       A story by Michael Cote'
 
            "Rain, rain," thought Chung, "It's always been this
       infernal rain."  He scuttled up the street towards his
       building.  A hidden sun failed to reflect light off  long
       dead neon tubes in the windows of abandoned stores.  His
       building loomed among a mass of rubble and muck in the
       deserted part of the city.  Narrow paths lead up to it's
       crumbling front door, their gutters running over with water
       from the television colored sky.  He arrived at the front
       door.  Soaked with rain he typed in his building access
       code.  A synthetic voice with female overtones spoke,
       "Welcome, Mr. Johnson."  Chung looked up, smoothing his wet
       hair back from his face, "Rack off, and open the door."
            Bits of trash littered the hall ways of Chungs
       building, occasionally barricading the path.  Small metallic
       creaking noises echoed throughout the hollow emptiness of
       the building as Chung climbed a set of ancient steel stairs.
       Chung looked upwards, towards the ceiling of the building
       into seemingly infinite darkness of abysmal loneliness.  A
       drop of water fell from a hole above, striking Chung on the
       face, causing him to real backwards and wipe away the horrid
       moisture.
            The building was utterly quiet except for Chung,
       "Alone," Chung said aloud tapping in his pass code at his
       door. "Welcome home Mr. Johnson," said the house computer.
       Chung threw down his coat on a near by couch, "Lights," the
       room came to life with a hologen glow.  "What's for dinner,"
       Chung asked himself, advancing upon his small kitchen and
       the refrigeration unit that it sheltered.  A small slab of
       brown bean curd sat by it's self on the middle shelf of the
       unit.  It had once been surrounded by a diversity of food,
       but now, after the other food had been eaten, it was the
       only item that gave the refrigeration unit warmth.  "Gatta
       go to the market tomorrow, but I need some money for that
       black-market food," he grabbed at the little chunk of curd.
       A little "wurrrr" sound erupted from the microwave, Chung
       waited for the tell-tale bing, then went into the living
       room.  He began his nightly ritual of watching Channel 34
       news, and gnawing away at his lump of tofu.  "Looks like
       tomorrow's' forecast is more rain, with a ten percent chance
       of sunshine," the weather man said.
            "What! More Rain! More Rain!," Chung threw his dinner
       at the TV, tofu and sauce ran down the screen, plopping onto
       the carpet.  He signed, rubbed the anger from his eyes, and
       went to the kitchen to get a towel.  The floor creaked under
       his weight.  Towel in hand, he dabbed at the carpet, then
       rubbed the screen.  "Tired of daily rain?," Chung looked up
       at the TV, "Want an escape form the solitude of your boring
       earth life?"
                 "That'd be grand, how much?," Chung spoke aloud in
       the voice of a transfixed person bathed in he glow of  a
       god, unable to move.
            "For only 5,000 dollars, you can fly away to the
       tranquillity of the Mars Colonies, surrounded by old and
       modern luxuries," the commercial seemed to reply directly to
       Chung, "So come along with TransWorld."  A trail of music
       followed the commercial.  Chung starred past the now drying
       smudged of curd and sauce, into the beauty of the Mars
       Colony fields.  Thoughts of hills of green grass with people
       crossed his mind.  The phrase "5,000 dollars" cast a shadow
       over his thoughts, he looked down at the carpet, starring
       into the pool of sauce.  He rubbed at his face, fighting the
       agony of reality and life.  "Next year, next year you'll
       have enough.  Then you can get off this crappy planet, go to
       mars and be somebody, with somebody."
                 He finished mopping up his dinner from the floor,
       and threw the towel onto the cleaning machine.  He sat back
       down.  The news ended with an aerial view of the city, and
       Chung sleeping in the chair.
                 The clocks green digits read "5:45," Chung
       scrambled to the bath room, and lifted up the seat.  With
       his free hand he rubbed the haze of sleep from his face, and
       looked out the window.  Lights filled the city at night, but
       they were far away, downtown.  He flushed down his waste,
       started starring at the swirling water, seeming to divine
       the untold secrets of the ages from the swirling mass of
       water in his toilet bowl.  He shuffled into the bedroom.
                 He sat on the edge of his bed, bent over a pillow.
       "Back to work," he put on his overalls.  They were a drab
       brown color only cut by the glow of a Federal Express
       hologram logo.  Coffee was pre brewed by the house computer,
       not too hot, just warm enough to bring out the flavor of the
       bean.  Chung wrapped his lips round the edge of the coffee
       cup, sucked in a small amount, the breathed out warm coffee
       breath.  The computer locked the door behind him, he dragged
       him self down the stairs to his car.  After thirty minutes
       of driving in silence and solitude, he arrived at the
       warehouse, his second home.  He drove up to the window,
       "Take this package to thirty five Marshall Street, give it
       to the butler," a woman with frayed hair gave him package.
       "Hi, Marge, how's your..," the package distributor closed
       the window before he could start talking to her.
                 Chung pushed a red button with a grimmy wrinkled
       thumb.  "Where to sir, " the car spoke aloud.  "Thirty five
       Marshall street," he closed his eyes and put his hands
       behind his head as the car drove off.  The car beeped at
       him. "All drivers are to have both hands on the steering
       wheel during auto pilot."  Chungs wrinkled hands, the trade
       mark of Earth life, grabbed at the wheel and closed his
       eyes.  An abrupt stop caused the package to fall face down
       on the floor.  Chung grabbed at the box, lifting it up.  A
       bundle of dollars fell out , the top had been broken in the
       fall.  "Stop!," he yelled out.  The car swerved to the side
       of the street and parked.  He scanned over the money, then
       looked about for other people, "Silly, there won't be
       anybody.  There must be, wow," he stopped and thought, "What
       is the description for package, uh, " he looked at the bar
       code of the box, "nine-five-zero-three?"  The car spoke,
       "Five comic books, insured for 5,015 and 23 cents."
                 "The sender must have lied, "Chung said smiling,
       "This would buy a nice apartment downtown.  I'd have
       neighbors, go to house warming parties, I'd talk to people!"
       He looked at the money again, "Or, I could..." he dove into
       the money, counted it three times.  "Car, change course,
       Airport."
                 He arrived to the bustling airport of the city.
       It was infested with people traveling about the earth.
       Middle management suck ups clung to corporation executives,
       seeming to protect them from the earth and the rain.
       Tourists looked for a cab with a worried expression on their
       face.  Bus boys scrambled about trying to make money carting
       about bags and  other pieces of luggage.  Scanning the
       offered ticket counters, he picked TransWorld, and walked up
       to it.  Once a human sold tickets to people, but now
       automation provided more expedient service, and eliminated
       the hassle of paying employees.  A large drawer served as
       the collection bin for money, a slot for credit chips.
       Chung thrust carried the box up to the counter and thrust
       the money into the drawer.
                 "Hello, sir, please enter Social Security Number,
       " a computer terminal spoke to him, concurrently displaying
       text on an inset screen.  Chung hurriedly looked at the
       label of the box, the number was there.  Chung punched the
       number into a keypad, his hand jittering with an the unknown
       high of excitement and hope.  "Please wait while your ticket
       is processed and your money is counted," the terminal
       paused, a faint sound of paper flicking could be heard,
       "Enter Colony Plan number.  Plane one is a..."
                 "I don't care, I just want to get away from this
       hell," he randomly pushed button two.  "I'm actually
       leaving, I'm leaving!" Chung said attracting a bit of
       attention from fellow airport patrons, and entered the
       airport.
                 "I don't have any of my things, " he said stopping
       in front of a baggage check robot, "Never mind that, I'll
       not need my possessions in the sprawling colonies."  He
       hopped onto a pedestrian conveyor belt.  The woman in front
       of him held a small leather bag in her left hand.  It's
       bottom punched down by some sort of spherical object.  She
       looked back at Chung for a moment, her red lips were full,
       her eyes highlighted by bluish eye shadow, then looked
       forward again.  Little waves of movement passed over the
       back of her silken shirt as they went under an airduct.
       They were nearing the mini mall section of the airport.
       Large signs informed travelers of a last chance to purchase
       duty free items, Chung steeped off the belt.  Randomly he
       picked out a shop, "All Things Scottish", the sign read,
       surrounded by  holograph array of plaid.  A bagpipe noise
       exploded from an unseen speaker when he opened the door,
       finally fading into silence.
                 Tartan cloth and green shelves covered the walls
       of the small store.  Behind a desk, a little old man dressed
       in full Scottish garb greeted him, "Welcome tou Aill Tins
       Scoutish," a thick accent cut through his English, "where if
       it's not Scottish, it's CRAP!," the last word came out with
       a thundering boom, sending bits of spittle across the
       counter as he bent down his head, "How ma' I 'elp eou?"
                 "Um, I'm just looking, thanks," Chung said.  He
       had fifteen dollars and twenty three cents left after buying
       the ticket, "Do you have any of those, uh, skirts for men?"
                 "Ah think eou mean keilts, lad, " the man replied
       sternly, "Ah've gote sume right over there,"  he pointed
       towards a shelf.  Chung walked over to the shelf, flipped
       through the kilts.  Green, red, black, blue, all arranged in
       geometric patterns.  He selected out a classic red and black
       one, "I'll take this and whatever socks and sweaters go with
       it."
                 After discarding his old clothes and stepping into
       his new traditional Scottish clothing, he stepped back onto
       the conniver belt, ten dollars poorer.  Somewhat high on
       excitement he rocked back and forth on his feet.  The odd
       feeling that the wool kilt produced caused Chung to scratch
       at his legs.  Large neon lights encircled the panel to the
       space shuttle.  No one else was waiting to enter the same
       portal as Chung, which caused him to check his ticket for
       the gate number again, "2H38, it's the same.  Reassured he
       stepped of the conveyor belt into the door to his flight.
                 His seat was a worn down brown cushioned chair.
       Next to him sat the lady with the silken shirt, she clutched
       the bulging bag  in her lap.  "That's a nice dress," she
       said with a smirk.  "What? Oh, it's kilt," he looked down at
       it and tried to discreetly scratch his leg, "I got it and
       this sweater and these socks, all for fifteen dollars."
                 "Isn't it great," she began, "going to a Mars
       colony, peace of mind, no more constant rain."
                 "Ahhh, no rain.  That'll be excellent, not to
       sopping wet constantly.  And meeting all those people!  I'll
       actually be someone, a neighbor to borrow sugar from!," he
       looked over to the lady for a response, but she had put on a
       pair of ear phones, looking in the opposite direction,
       "Well, no one will ignore me any longer no mars."
                 The shuttle landed on Mars five hours later.  An
       exhausted Chung stood up, ready to exit.  "Thank you for
       flying TransWorld," said the shuttle as he exited.  "Please
       exit through the door marked with your colony site number,"
       said a loud speaker in a digital voice.  Chung looked at his
       ticket, "Site 593A-65H", it read.  He passed by several
       doors, looking at the digital read outs on three panels
       before he arrived at his door.
                 "Please insert you ticket," said the door.
       Dumbfounded, Chung looked about for a slot, found it and
       slid in his ticket.  The door whisked open, "Thank you for
       flying TransWorld.  And please, enjoy your stay on colony
       593A-65H."
                 Chung sat on another seat for several hours, this
       time alone.  The manmade landscape of mars whizzed by him,
       visible through a window in the mini shuttle.  Clouds
       floated in a once barren sky, birds flew about where live
       creatures had once never been.  The shuttle stopped, a door
       opened, "Thank you for choosing TransWorld, enjoy your new
       home at site 593A-65H."
                 Chung walked up a path to a house, "This is odd,"
       he thought, "Where are all the other houses?"  He looked
       about.  His new house sat on a hill, surrounded by water as
       far as the eye could see.  He scrambled back to the landing
       site, only a small dark circle remained at the site.
       "Something must be wrong," he muttered," Where are all the
       people?!?"  He rabidity searched the island.  A quaint
       little hut rested on top of a small mountain.  Cooking
       implements and a refrigeration unit were the only
  \    furnishings.  Chung sat down in the hut.  He picked up a
   \   handful of sand.  The sand shifted through his fingers,
    \               leaving a single stone in his hand, "Alone."

  Father looked at Janie, all snug in her bed. Thoughts crept into his
  mind. He was full of those thoughts on the inside. Those dark thoughts.
  Those thoughts that made him feel guilty sometimes. He knows there is
  only one way to kill guilt. Janie laughed on the inside.

          So you think your E-Mail is private! Well, maybe it is. But
     what about the person your sending it to. What about the numerous
     possible between the two of you? That's why many user across the
     globe have been enjoying the security of PGP. Unfortunatly the
     Anal Retentive American Government to disapointed at their failure
     to control their own countries REAL problems has lashed out at
     Phil's Pretty Good Software. That's right! If you haven't heard yet
     PGP v2.3 has been labeled as 'high-level encryption'. This means
     you can not export it out of the country. Yulp- You probably guessed
     it! The U.S. gov'ment is accusing Phil of intention to export 'cause
     he put it on the net.
          If you feel you need to express your views on this act send
     some txt to the white-house or to Phil 'imself. (Addresses below).

  Father left the room and took off his glasses. They had succesfully
  thwarted Janie's attempt to read his mind. That's what his insides say.
  He knew that because he could still feel her happiness. She wouldn't be
  so happy if she had known what he was thinking. He began to laugh on
  the inside, as his meandering hands began to embrace him.

  Father didn't mind the wet pants. Father didn't mind. He just stood in
  the hallway. Thinking on the inside. Janie could see his insides, she
  had been able to see there for about three months. Janie understood
  what he had been doing to her. Making her forget the pain. Forget her
  insides. He did it because of "love" he says. Janie knows this is no
  love. Janie clings tightly to her security. Janie presses hard on the
  H-Icon that floats in her mind. The Aura-Gaurd Soft v13.2b ware that
  she linked to was active. Father didn't mind. He just stood in the
  hallway. Janie laughed on the inside, she knew that 'they' had all
  on tape somewhere, they would have prrof that her act was in 'defense'.
  She had moved the T.V. into her room.

  FROM: (UNIMPORTANT)
  DATE: (UNIMPORTANT)
 
 
  In an effort to gain access to the homes of millions of Americans,
  the FBI, CIA, and NSA have collaborated on a scheme which will
  finally bring to fruition George Orwell's nightmare scenario.
 
  American citizens will be the unwitting accomplices in this plan
  as they purchase new televisions and bring them into their
  livingrooms and *bedrooms*.  I'm speaking of the CC decoders that
  have secretly been mandated by law.  These decoders supposedly
  provide captions to TV shows for the hearing impaired, but in
  fact they are also rebroadcasters which will allow the gov.
  to spy on anyone they want.
 
  The television already comes with everything necessary to be
  a spying apparatus.  Speakers are essentially no different than
  microphones and therefore can be used to pick up sounds in the
  room.  The infrared eye which detects the remote control
  signal also receives an infrared picture of the room, especially
  detecting heat sources like people.  Thus, all that is needed is
  a way of gathering this information and relaying it to the government.
  The little understood "Decoder" is the solution.
 
  The congress has recently passed a Law (in virtual secrecy)
  that requires all new TV's to have the "Decoder."  This is
  claimed to be for the benefit of deaf people but that is
  obviously a smoke screen.
 
  How we know the congressional law mandating the "Decoder" is not
  for the deaf:
          1) Legitimate CC decoders are already available for TV's.
          2) The law doesn't cover other things, like telephones,
             which are obviously in the same situation w.r.t. the deaf.
          3) There is no law requiring that shows even be broadcast with
             closed captions, only that the TV have the "Decoder".
 
  Clearly we see that there is no real justification for mandating
  decoders other than for gathering intelligence.
 
 
  How to deal with the decoder:  simply removing the decoder will not
  be an option because it will undoubtedly be integrated in such a way
  that the television will not function without it.  Also, if you open
  the TV to get at it, you will void the warranty and then when you
  get it fixed, they will just replace the "Decoder" without telling.
 
  The best way to avoid the "Decoder" is to avoid it by not buying any
  new TV's.  This will be made difficult by the predictable introduc-
  tion of High Definition Television soon after the "Decoders" are
  on line.  In this way you will be forced to buy a new TV because the
  old one will not get HDTV.  When HDTV is made a standard by the govern-
  ment, the old style signal will not be allowed to be broadcast on the
  grounds that it interferes with the HDTV.  This is all to force people
  to buy new TV's with the "Decoder".
 
  When you find yourself with a TV equipped with the "Decoder" there
  are several things you can do to protect yourself.  First, don't
  put the TV in your bedroom, this is where the government is most
  interested in spying.  When not watching, push the antennas all the
  way in or disconnected the cable.  Unplugging the TV will not help
  because the "Decoder" will use passive broadcasting to continue
  sending its signal.  Also turn the volume down when not watching.
  When you watch the TV, place a candle or other heat source to confuse
  the infrared EYE.  Don't say anything secret or get undressed near
  the TV.  Don't be seen smoking near the TV.

  is very important to us all.  Warn you families.  I don't know
  how much longer I will be allowed to keep my account after this.

  Father takes his hand out of his pants. He hasn't had enough. Janie
  knows. She turns the TV up full blast by the remote. The audio
  damping warez that she slipped Father simultaneously activate. The
  brightness on the TV is all the way down. The room is dark, inside.
  Father wants, inside. Janie fears inside. "They have to have their
  damn evidence" says she, inside. Janie clings tigtly to her security.
  Father slips the cable into her port. His warez activate, she masks
  them. He comes inside, covers off. The TeeVee. is on. The TeeVee sees
  all. The pain. The disease. The sickness. The blood. She'd been waiting
  for this for a long time.
  Janie sits up in bed. Father was nothing on the inside. Father was a
  mess. As she stands to approach the TeeVee. Father slips out of her,
  inside. Janie grabs a vial and rubs it's cold edge against her pain.
  She caps it and places it on the bed. She calls security. She sits
  and waits. "It feels good to have it out", says she.
