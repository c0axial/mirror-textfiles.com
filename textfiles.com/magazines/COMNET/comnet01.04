NEW ORGANIZATIONS ON THE NET

From: mwalsh@internetinfo.com
New on the Net--April/May 1994

A cursory review of 1,400 plus Commercial Domains and their owners
added to the Internet in the April/May 1994 timeframe yields the
following observations.  Over 30% are in the computer related
fields.  This is based upon a rigorous and proprietary
classification technique of assuming that if the company's name
contains any of the magic words.... computer, digital, data,
software, etc, etc... that the company probably has something to do
with the computer industry.

Most (70%) of the companies are small or very new.  This
observation is based on the fact they do not show up in any of the
standard directories of business organizations or full text
databases of newspaper and trade articles.

Subject: Some Practical Stuff

I thought I might post some of the work we have done over the last
couple of weeks to give you an idea of day to day activities here in Littleton.

For a fast growing landscape contractor who wants to take his company
public, we did extensive research on IPO's (Initial Public Offerings).  We
were able to find articles on the problems of manipulating earnings
before going public; pro's and con's of IPO's; a list of major underwriters and
their performance; books and other publications on taking your
company public; and a list of local companies who had gone public recently.

He was also concerned about the liability of handling toxic waste and its
impact on his personal finances.  We found a whole series of articles
from sources as diverse as Risk Management, Business of New Hampshire,
LA Business Journal and Pennsylvania CPA Journal which indicated that
he did have a major liability as a transporter which would have to be
accounted for when he went public.

We also found a couple of newsletters that we suggested he subscribe to:
Construction Claims Citator and Hazardous Waste Litigation
Reporter.

The idea is that information like this makes you more competitive which
eventually leads to wealth and job creation.

This morning, we worked with our the TV studio of our local community
college to finish production on two video tapes about local "best
practices".  One is on customer service at The Tattered Cover, a four
story book store in Denver (Cherry Creek).  The other is on business
strategies and features a high quality independent meat store called
Tony's.  In the era of mega-grocery stores, Tony's has grown and
prospered by filling a niche for high quality meats.

Last Friday, we briefed some bankers on our search capabilities and
then proceeded to develop a list of auto parts wholesalers in the region,
ranked by sales, so they could make sales calls.

Yesterday, a company that puts embroidered logos on hats and golf
shirts asked for a list of conventions coming to Denver within the next year.
He will approach the participants and offer to provide shirts and hats.  We
had the list within 10 minutes.

Last Thursday, we met with a company that specialized in merging
private companies into public shells and providing financing.  We do not believe
that our small efforts at trying to solve the multi-billion dollar capital
needs of Littleton businesses will make much of a dent so we try to
improve the workings of the private capital markets through better
information.

Last Tuesday, we worked with our community college and the local
telecommunication companies to kick off a curriculum and training
programming supporting that effort.  We recently visited a
CD-I(interactive) shop and may use that technology to deliver training in
the field.  The cable TV houses may install CD players in trucks and then
their field people can learn and review while they are on the job.  Other
portions may be broadcast out of the college's TV studio.  The community
college made a major effort to get a micro-wave path to an uplink
station last year and it is starting to payoff.

We are continuing in our effort to become the "wired city".  We are
thinking of T-shirts that say "Whoever dies with the most wires, wins".

We are also sponsoring the Colorado Issues Network meeting in July
with a theme of "Complexity and Economic Development".  We hope to talk to
Brian Arthur via conference phone call.

U.S. TECH CORPS

From: Gary J. Beach
Publisher Computerworld
ustech@cw.com

Anyone who has written code, maintained a network, or planned a
company information system knows that implementation is everything.
Surprisingly, so do thousands of U.S. school teachers and administrators.

Throughout the U.S., our schools say that a shortage of technical talent
is their largest obstacle in moving the "information superhighway" from
vision to reality. Their tight budgets and a dire shortage of technical skills
stand in the way of implementing technology where it is most needed: the local
classroom.

A solution may be in sight.

Computerworld, the national newspaper of information systems
management, is working jointly with the White House Office of Science
and Technology to develop the U.S. Tech Corp.

Modeled on the U.S. Peace Corps, the U.S. Tech Corps will rally the
talents and skills of more than 1.9 million computer professionals to assist
public schools in planning and implementing information technology. Through
contributions of their time and expertise, these volunteers will play an
integral and crucial role in building local roads to the national
information superhighway. Even an hour a week of discussion and planning can
help your local school.

The U.S. Tech Corps will be operated with assistance from the White
House, the National Education Association, and the National
Association of School Administrators. Volunteers will receive a U.S. Tech
Corps certificate signed by the President, as well as local recognition. Of
course, the greatest reward may be the satisfaction gained from contributing
your valuable skills to the future of our school children.

[Action Items: What else is needed? Do you think that your fellow
computer professionals will respond favorably or unfavorably to this proposal?
How might the U.S. Tech Corp be made to work?]

COMBINING PUBLIC RADIO AND COMMUNITY up information about what we did.

This announcement was played on the radio station this week, and I
posted it to ba.internet and ba.broadcast (ba = Bay Area).

It was a half hour show, and we started by talking about what USENET
was, how it worked, and the different ways of accessing it.  The
detailed instructions I gave were for the tin newsreader, but we also
talked about how select aspects of USENET could be found on AOL and
local bulletin board systems such as Women's Wire, SF Net, and the SF
PC Users Group.  The USENET stuff went on for about 20 minutes, and
we had a few listeners call in with questions about access.

We then contrasted the asynchronous nature of USENET with the real-
time nature of IRC.  I created a #kpfa channel, gave instructions, and was
blown away by a few dozen people cascading in from The WELL,
Netcom, CRL, a21, UC Berkeley, and Delphi.  The radio program might have
gone up for grabs at the point, as the IRC channel filled with good natured
banter about the program, questions about USENET, and a call for
people to post what cities they were connecting from.

We're going to do it again on June 17th for 45 minutes as part of the
KPFA Marathon.  We're hoping that Osborne, who's local, will kick in a
few pairs of Hahn and Stout as $75 premiums.  We'll probably tour
gopher/veronica-space and wind up with another IRC session.

I have a tape of the show.  If anyone wants to mail me a cassette (in a
re-usable, post-paid mailer), I'll dupe it for you.  I suppose I should
put this out on the Web as an .au file, but maybe I'll just wait until
Carl "Internet Talk Radio" Malamud comes calling.  8-)

SCHOLASTIC LAUNCHES INTERNET SERVER AND NEW K-12 SERVICES

From: NETWORKS AND COMMUNITY : June 22, 1994 Stephen
Covington <cvington@NETCOM.COM>

New York, NY--June 12, 1994-- Scholastic Network today announced
the launch of Scholastic Internet Services,  Created to offer K-12
teachers and students an easy-to-use, high-value destination on the
coming 'Information Superhighway, the Scholastic Internet Services
are accessible to all Internet users and include a K-12 net site running
Gopher, WAIS and WWW..

The new Scholastic Internet services announced today are:  Scholastic
Internet Libraries, four electronic curriculum libraries with a myriad of
resources and over 5,000 full-text articles offered for site licenses; the
Scholastic Internet Center, a free Internet site offering information,
lesson plans, and electronic newsletters; and the Ultimate Education Store, a
searchable, on-line catalog of educational books, magazines, software,
curriculum kits, and more. "These Internet Services are an effective
first step in bringing Scholastic's information resources onto the Internet,"
said Susan Mernit, Director of Network Development. "All the Scholastic
Divisions contributed to this effort.".

"As more schools connect to the Internet, Scholastic Internet Services
provide a simpler method for teachers and students to get access to
libraries of information on science, language arts, and technology," said
Richard Robinson, President, Chairman, and CEO of Scholastic. " When we
launched Scholastic Network with America Online last fall, our goal was to
help K-12 teachers and their students work interactively with a variety of
information. With the introduction of our Internet services, all educators with
Internet access gain the ability to connect to Scholastic materials."

"From a national perspective, the emergence of electronic information
delivery presents new opportunities for all sectors of society," said Linda
Roberts, Secretary's Advisor on Technology, U.S. Department of
Education. "The Internet offers educators access to information that was
previously difficult to reach. With a growing number of teachers on the Internet
, this use of technology clearly allows teachers to better serve the needs of st
udents."

Using technology developed by Wide Area Information Services (WAIS),
Scholastic's technology partner in this effort,  parents and teachers can
easily search and retrieve what they are looking for in the Scholastic
libraries as well as the aisles of books, magazines, newsletters and other
educational products in the store, without leaving their home, school or
office. Consumers and educators can order information and materials
directly from the company using credit cards and purchase orders online.

The WAIS technology allows Scholastic Internet Services users to
browse and search without typing long commands.  For example, a student is
able to ask for information about "volcanoes" and immediately see a list of
all the data available relating to volcanoes.  This technology makes the
Internet more accessible to computer-users who often find the Internet
difficult to navigate.

One of the new services, the Scholastic Internet Libraries, is available
to state education networks, regional telephone companies, and regional
internet providers for site license for their account-holders. These
school science, reading and language arts, integrating technology into
the classroom, and teaching with seasonal activities. Subscribers to the
Scholastic Network on America Online have full access to these Internet
resources without additional charge.

Education-related networks, gophers, MOSAIC sites, etc. are
encouraged to connect to the Scholastic Internet Center For more information
on the services, including the URL and Gopher addresses to link to, send email
to sninternet@aol.com. A special effort is being made to provide
appropriate and relevant resources and pages for students as well--stay turned!)

Scholastic Network is the first full-service online network designed
exclusively for teachers and students.  Scholastic Inc. (NMS:SCHL) ,
headquartered in New York, is among the leading publishers and
distributors of children's books, classroom and professional magazines, and
other educational materials. The Company also publishes educational
computer software and produces children and family-oriented video and
television programming. Scholastic operates in the United States, Canada,
Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.

MOSAIC SITE IN CHINA

From:BMcKercher@idrc.ca
Bob McKercher
International Development Research Centre
Ottawa, Canada

The machine in Beijing is bepc2.ihep.ac.cn (in fact it is from bepc1 to
bepc5). You may use the command

finger @bepc2.ihep.ac.cn to find out who is on.

There is a way to find the email address of a particular
person. I forgot the postmaster name of this service.

The WWW service address is

http://www.ihep.ac.cn:3000/ihep.html

it also contains most information about internet in China.

IHEP-SLAC Networking

China Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP)
established its own Local Area Network (LAN)
supporting DECnet in 1988 and became a user of
CNPAC in 1990.

Due to the physics collaboration between IHEP and
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), the
first direct international 64 Kbps leased line
in China via AT&T satellite was established to
SLAC in March, 1993. The US Department of
Commerce ( DoC) restricted this first China
connection to SLAC only. IHEP users can send
e-mail to people all over the world, but can
only transfer files and connect to SLAC
machines. In 1993, IHEP local area network
supported both TCP/IP and DECnet; Only DECnet
ran on this lease line to the outside world.

At the end of 1993, IHEP got the final
permission of removing the restriction and full
access to ESnet part of the US Internet, in
the meantime, IHEP received the approval via DoE
to get the first CISCO in China in Feb, 1994.
ESnet and IHEP are working on the new network
configuration of IHEP since February, 1994.
TCP/IP routing between IHEP and the full ESnet
began on April 25th, 1994.More software has been
installed ( like WWW) and more network service
will be provided.

Dr. Rongsheng XU, director of Computer Center of
IHEP, has opened accounts for more than 300 top
scientists in different research areas in China
so that they can exchange e-mail with outside
world, obtain preprints... at home via modem and
phone line or via CHINAPAC.

In the summer of 1994 when BTA accomplishes the
fiber optic between Beijing and Shanghai, the
IHEP - SLAC network link will be changed from
satellite to fiber optic physical link from
Beijing to Shanghai, to Tokyo, to US, which is
more stable and easier for the future upgrading.
IHEP has an intention to upgrade the link rate
to 128 kbps and establish video conferencing on
the Internet; In the meantime, IHEP continues to
set up its scientific information database for
Chinese scientists. IHEP has gained the support
from National Science Foundation of China ( NSFC)
for the future network development and some
institutes have planed to connect their LAN to
IHEP network directly.

DELIVERING FISH ON THE HIGHWAY

The Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture is connecting its
electronic mail system to the Internet, an early step in using
the information highway to reach international markets. The
objective is to gain a competitive edge by providing
up-to-the-minute information to global customers. The department
is also examining the ways and means of using the Internet for
research and video conferencing to cut travel and offer training
to international students.
Contact: Guy LeBlanc  (506) 457-7303

A VIRTUAL GOVERNMENT

First, there was a coherent program for voice communications
that offered government departments better services at lower
costs. Now, the same idea is being used by the Information
Highway Secretariat to find  to find the best and most cost
effective ways to exchange data. Issues being discussed include
how small, medium and large government offices will connect, the
hardware and software they will use. Most of the information is
already in place and is being put into an overall plan that will
be released sometime this fall.
Contact: Danny Keizer  (506) 457-4888 danny@gov.nb.ca

PRINTING ON THE LEADING EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY

A sophisticated computer network, high speed digital modems and
video conferencing equipment are all working together to help
Centennial Print in Fredericton print documents on demand. A
major customer for the service is Northern Telecom which uses the
system to print small quantities of software manuals as they are
required by clients around the world. Locally, the print on
demand system is being used for small runs of textbooks and
brochures.
Contact: Mark Lancaster (506) 453-1310

ELECTRONIC FORMS TO REDUCE PAPER

The Department of Supply and Services wants to replace paper
forms with electronic versions. The objective is to reduce the
amount of paper used by government. More important, though, is
the promised reduction in handling. Intelligent computer forms
can be built to require that all the blanks be filled in and can
help reduce typographical errors. The project is a step towards
EDI - electronic data interchange - that aims to eliminate paper
between people, offices and organizations.
Contact: Richard Dunphy (506) 453-8737 richardd@gov.nb.ca

INFORMATION HIGHWAY GUIDE HEADED TO THE PRINTER

More than 60 companies that make use of the Internet have
asked to be included in the guide being produced by Harley*Mallory
Strategic Communications. The guide will be officially released at
the "Doing Business on the Information Highway" conference to be
held at the Wu Conference Centre, UNB, on June 30th. And Internet
email was the key tool in gathering the information so quickly --
far faster than previous efforts of this kind that relied on phone
calls and faxes. The guide is headed for the printer on Monday or
Tuesday -- so this is the last call for entries.

SINGAPORE TELECOM $50 MILLION SYSTEM UPGRADE

Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. has commissioned a Singapore
$50 million Multi-Machine Teleview System (MMTS) to expand its
information transmission capacity by six times and link users to
Internet, the international computer network.

ST executive vice president (local services) Lee Hsien Yang said at
the commissioning of MMTS that Teleview users will have services
like Internet access by the end of the month.

MMTS is a network of 12 mini-computers. Teleview is an on-line
service with 15,000 subscribers accessing a database of over 140,000
pages of information. Users must have a personal computer and a
modem to link to the information which is provided by over 100
vendors. The services include share price information, lottery results
and ticket booking.

Among Teleview's improved services will be access to enhanced
Reuters Holdings Plc financial database, Lee said. Local area network
(LAN) operators will also be able to offer Teleview through their
networks.

Lee said Teleview has to evolve to incorporate new technologies even
as Singapore embraces cable television and video-on-demand.
"Singapore Telecom will be conducting a multi-media Teleview trial
within the next two years," Lee said.

SURVEY SAYS: LARGE U.S. FIRMS SLOWLY BUYING INTO
SUPERHIGHWAY IDEA

Lake Forest, Ill. -- Large U.S. firms are buying into the heavy media
hype surrounding the so-called "Information Superhighway,"
according to a survey conducted by Interactive Facts, an industry
newsletter highlighting breaking developments in this field.

Interactive Facts initiated the survey of 268 executives overseeing
marketing and advertising decisions at large American organizations.
The survey was conducted between April 25 and May 18, 1994.

Following are the results of the survey:

  1)  Is your organization currently using any interactive technologies
to communicate with customers or market goods/services?
      YES               51%
      NO                47%
      Don't Know        2%

  2)  Is your organization currently, or will you in 1994, be
researching the new technologies such as on-line services, CD-ROM's,
kiosks or interactive television?
      YES               72%
      NO                23%
      Don't Know        5%

  3)  How long do you believe it will take before interactive actually
has any impact on how you communicate with customers or market
goods/services?
      Less than 1 Year  9%
      1-2 Years         48%
      3-5 Years         34%
      6-10 Years                6%
      Over 10 Years     3%

"The hype certainly has gotten big firms to turn their heads, whether
or not they'll follow through with interactive programs remains to be
seen," commented Sherry McHone, editor of Interactive Facts. "Many
of the firms claiming to already have interactive programs in place
are referring to the use of Electronic Mail. Beyond that, firms
apparently are feeling the need to investigate the other new
technologies like on-line services and CD-ROM's. Ninety-one percent
of those responding felt interactive will have an impact on how they
market within five years, quite an aggressive view."
