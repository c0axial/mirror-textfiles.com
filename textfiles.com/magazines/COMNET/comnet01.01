ALBUQUERQUE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY SEMINAR

The first Information Superhighway Seminar in Albuquerque, New 
Mexico was held on Thursday and Friday, March 24th and 25th. This 
meeting was jointly sponsored by the Albuquerque Chamber of 
Commerce, US West, MCI, Jones Intercable, and NM Technet. It was 
held in conjunction with the Albuquerque Business Fair. The two-
day meeting was very well attended, implying a serious interest in 
the so-called Information Superhighway.

The keynote speakers were Jim O'Brien, President of Jones 
Intercable Inc. and Roanne Robinson, Deputy Director of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. 
Department of Commerce. Other speakers on the first day of the 
conference included: Chris Bowick, Group Vice President, Technology, 
Jones Intercable; Jon Curran, Regional Manager, AT&T; Rob Smith, 
Vice President, Advanced Systems Networks, Microelectronics & 
Computer Corporation (MCC); Jeff Sterba, Vice President, Finance 
Development, Public Service Company of New Mexico; Tom Garcia, 
Vice President New Mexico, US West; Mort Aaronson, Vice President, 
Large Accounts and Global Marketing, MCI Business Markets. 
Speakers for the second day of the conference included: Robert 
Raisch, President, The Internet Company; Fred Smith, President, High 
Tech Computer Crime Investigations Association; Peter Broullire, 
Attorney; Teresa M. Johnson, Attorney, Keleher & McLeod; Steve 
Beffort, Superhighway Seminar Committee; Irwin Kirmer, Consultant.

The overriding theme of the conference was commercial applications 
for the Information Superhighway--how will money be made on this 
new highway. All of the industry speakers during the first day of the 
conference discussed their company's plans for providing 
commercial services over the new highway. Essentially, this relates 
to the so-called "500 channels." Services would include such things 
as movies on-demand, the golf channel and other specialized 
entertainment channels, banking, "smart homes," healthcare, 
telework (telecommuting), national defense, and purchasing goods on 
home-shopping channels. Some attention was paid to educational 
applications, but little was actually said. Ironically, US West Vice 
President for New Mexico, Tom Garcia, noted that in surveys that 
they had seen indicated that approximately 80% of the public poled 
felt that educational services were the most important and would be 
used the most. Yet, none of the speakers treated education as a 
major feature of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). 
Garcia also noted that in the US West United Kingdom venture to 
provide television and other services through telephone lines in a 
testbed location, that they started with 2,100 services two years ago 
and now provide over 71,000 services. The types of services were 
not discussed.

Overall, the industry participants were promoting their own 
company's approach to the development of the Information 
Superhighway. Unfortunately, most participants were more 
interested in advertizing their own approach, rather than trying to 
deal with the substantive issues facing the NII's development and 
utilization. MCI even showed its television commercials advertizing 
its network.

Jon Curran of AT&T made the point that the information 
superhighway is actually a "global" information infrastructure. He 
cited applications such as the "smart" home, learning, healthcare, 
banking and finance, retail sales, telework, national defense, and 
disaster recovery. Curran, who is the southwestern regional manager 
for AT&T indicated that he knew very little about the Internet and 
had never heard of community networks, nor was he aware of 
community network concepts. However, he did indicate an interest 
in the concept when informed about the community network 
movement in the U.S.

Rob Smith from MCC discussed his organization's project to build 
better tools and interfaces which would overlay networks to provide 
better access and ease of use for ordinary people. MCC is studying 
the managing and understanding of information and information 
dissemination. MCC also is working on security issues, particularly as 
they relate to banking and finance. Smith discussed the development 
of "virtual companies" which are formed when several companies 
come together for a specific project or projects, yet physically, they 
may be located in geographically disparate regions around the 
country or world. Once the job is done, the virtual company 
dissolves. The business, research, development, etc. of the virtual 
company is accomplished mainly through electronic means. The legal 
issues surrounding virtual companies (and other electronic issues) 
were discussed during the second day of the conference by Teresa 
M. Johnson, an attorney with Keleher & McLeod, who gave an 
excellent overview of some of the legal issues facing Internet and 
software entrepreneurs. Smith suggested that electronic online 
systems, the information superhighway, is probably the most 
valuable business opportunity since the development of the 
railroads. Smith also noted that he has finally reached the point 
where over half of his mail is electronic mail.

Jeff Sterba from the Public Service Company of New Mexico 
discussed the power company's role in on the information 
superhighway. Usually, when one thinks of the types of 
organizations becoming involved in the superhighway, one does not 
think of power companies, except when they plug-in their computer 
or television. However, power companies are interested in the NII 
for a number of reasons. First, the power companies are looking at 
the NII because it could provide real-time pricing for the customer 
so that power usage could be better monitored to reduce costs to the 
consumer and to the power company. NII technology also could 
provide for better feedback on the condition of power stations, 
transformers, etc. for improved predictions of failures and other 
potential problems. Meter reading also could be done more 
efficiently electronically. Power companies already utilize a 
significant amount of fiber-optic lines to provide communications in 
its systems. Some of the bandwidth of this fiber could be used for 
telecommunications applications. In addition, power companies have 
obtained rights of way which could be leased to NII providers.

Mort Aaronson from MCI discussed MCI's approach to the 
information superhighway, which is essentially to provide access to 
video on-demand and other commercial services. Much of MCI's 
presentation comprised promotional videos advertizing its 
NetworkMCI* systems. Aaronson was one of the more aggressive 
speakers, and clearly indicated by his comments, the intense rivalry 
between MCI and AT&T. Aaronson indicated that it was important 
for MCI "to control the content" of what was being delivered. This 
statement seemed to go un-noticed among the audience and other 
panelists. He also indicated that MCI was emphasizing partnering 
among companies. Aaronson, a top executive of MCI, had never 
heard of community networks, and was completely unfamiliar with 
the concepts. He indicated an interest, when informed about 
community network concepts.

Robert Raisch, President of the Internet Company, discussed 
commercial applications on the Internet. His company provides the 
network resources for Counterpoint Publishing, a company that 
processes government information and sells it online. The Internet 
Company also runs the Electronic Newsstand, which provides sample 
articles, tables of contents, and information about how to subscribe 
to a number of magazines. According to Raisch, the Electronic 
Newsstand receives 40,000 to 45,000 requests per day for 
information through this gopher site.

Raisch suggested that there are six main methods of making money 
on the Internet:

	1. Hardware--servers, routers, etc.
	2. Access Provider--connections, accounts, and dial-ins
	3. Software--protocols, archie, wais, gopher, front-ends, etc.
	4. Services--distribution, publishing, etc.
	5. Expertise--Technology transfer, training, seminars, etc.
	6. Content--information for a price.

He made the point that one of the most frequently made mistakes is 
to try to do too many things. That is, companies have problems when 
they try to tackle two or more of the above methods. He suggested 
that a company or organization should only do one of the above. The 
point was made that at the present time, he estimates that there are 
only 500,000 megaPel, multi-mip workstations out of about 2 million 
Internet hosts. This means that the fancier graphic interface 
systems, such as mosaic can be used by only a relatively small 
number of users. All of his company's information is in text form 
only.

Raisch also discussed electronic publishing and the difference 
between value and cost of the published product. Using the example 
of a Stephen King novel, if it is available in a bookstore for $28.95, 
should Simon and Schuster charge $28.95 when selling it online? The 
answer is no. He suggested that the appropriate way of charging for 
online publications is by time or volume. For instance, charging 25" 
per x amount of time to read the novel, or by a certain volume of the 
work. This approach can be profitable because the cost of electronic 
dissemination in minuscule compared to the cost of paper volumes 
and their dissemination. Obviously, the cost of reading the Stephen 
King novel online should be considerably less than in paper format.

Raisch was the only presenter that discussed the issues surrounding 
providing true two-way communications in networks. Most 
companies consider interactivity to mean buying products or 
services. He used Prodigy as an example. When Prodigy was 
designed, it was believed that its customers would only want to 
consume. Thus, a big "pipe" went to the customer, with only tiny 
tubes coming back (for purchasing). Prodigy found that instead of 
purchasing, people wanted to talk. According to Raisch, "...the 
Internet is the only major medium in which the individual can talk 
back and communicate with his or her peers..."

It was announced by Raisch that his company will be starting a 
series of  Usenet news groups specifically for advertizing on the 
Internet. This is a new approach to commercialization on the 
Internet.

One of the scarier presentations was by Fred Smith, President of the 
High Tech Computer Crime Investigation Association. Citing 
numerous articles which have discussed the highwaymen on the 
Information Superhighway, he proceeded to describe all of the 
potential (note potential) horrors that could befall travelers on this 
highway. The Information Superhighway began to sound like the 
highway to hell. He suggested that sex was driving the highway and 
organized crime was beginning to infiltrate the Internet--with no 
substantiation.

As in any other human endeavors, crimes will no doubt occur on this 
new highway. However, the draconian approaches Smith was 
implying suggested little regard for the First Amendment. Basically, 
he seemed to see demons and shady characters behind every news 
group sign post. And his approach to solving these purported 
problems was, in essence, what I would interpret as an Internet 
police. I told you it was getting pretty scary.

One of the glorious characteristics of the Internet is its freedom. It is 
one of the most democratic institutions ever devised--even if by 
accident. Rob Raisch made the comment that one could consider the 
Internet a city of 25 million people--who actually, for the most part, 
cooperate. Moreover, I will suggest that it is also a huge 
neighborhood watch. Its inhabitants have been very successful at 
policing their own neighborhoods--without an Internet police.

The last presentation of the conference was by Irwin Kirmer, an 
Internet consultant, who attempted to take the audience on a tour of 
the Internet. Actually, his demonstration amounted to a series of 
frustrating attempts to gopher, ftp, or telnet to sites which were 
overcrowded. It demonstrated very clearly the traffic jams already 
on the highway.

(It should be noted, to the panelist's credit, all thought the notion of 
community networks was an excellent idea. I brought up the topic of 
community networks at the end of the first day's session. It was 
encouraging to see a lot of affirmative nodding in the audience, as 
well as on the dais. However, it is unsettling to realize some of the 
key players in the Information Superhighway business had a 
complete lack of knowledge about community networking. For us in 
the community networking trenches, we must realize that many of 
those sitting in corporate offices trying to figure out how to deal with 
the Information Superhighway and how to wring the most money 
out of it, have never heard of, or considered community-based 
networks--a sobering thought.)[\\

SPACE COMMERCE '94--10th NATIONAL SPACE SYMPOSIUM

Space Commerce '94 is the 10th National Space Symposium, 
sponsored by the United States Space Foundation, headquartered in 
Colorado Springs, Colorado. This year's conference was attended by 
approximately 400 executives from the aerospace industry, 
government officials, military officers, astronauts, and others.

The conference's main theme was commercial applications in space. 
New business opportunities, technology transfer, and related topics 
were discussed.

Of particular interest to those with an interest in the NII, was a 
strong emphasis on utilizing space assets for the development and 
implementation of the Information Superhighway. It appears as if 
everyone is ready to jump onto the highway, even from Low-Earth 
Orbit.

Syed Shariq, Manager of Technology Commercialization, NASA/Ames 
Research Center, noted that NASA's approach to technology transfer 
has been reactive, rather than proactive. Now, NASA wants to be 
more proactive, and to this end, it is developing its NASA 
Commercial Technology Network that is accessible through a Mosaic 
interface on the Internet. He indicated that NASA wants to use the 
Internet for dissemination of proposals, RFPs, and be part of the "NII 
Test Bed." To connect to the NASA Commercial Technology Network

POT HOLES IN THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

POT HOLES is a column in this newsletter that will cover potential 
problems and difficult issues concerning the development of the NII. 
Most of us in the community networking world believe that 
community-based networks is one of the best approaches to 
providing democratic access to information and communications 
resources. However, not everyone thinks the way we do. It is very 
important to pay close attention to the corporate world, which as 
Herbert Schiller remarks below, "...are doing the most natural thing 
in the world to them..." For-profit corporations are in the business of 
making money--and I have no quarrel with that. Yet, like the public 
library, the citizenry must have free to very affordable access to 
information and communications which can be provided by 
community networking and the Internet.

As pointed out in the article on the Albuquerque Information 
Superhighway Seminar, several high-level executives from 
companies, presumably on top of the development of the NII, had 
never heard of community networks. This was not an isolated case. 
When I attended the Berkeley Roundtable for International 
Economics' Technology Summit meeting in San Francisco in 
November, the same problem was observed. Most of the top 
telecommunications and computer industry executives that I spoke 
with were unaware of the community network movement in the 
country. Perhaps, those in the community networking world, despite 
all of our sophisticated methods of communications, haven't paid 
enough attention to communicating with the corporate world.

It is critical that those who believe that community networks are 
valuable, if not essential, tools for using the NII, spread the word to 
the corporate world. Corporate executives are not ignoring 
community networks, but in many cases they simple don't know 
about them. When I have explained what we are doing in the La 
Plaza Telecommunity project, most executives with which I have 
spoken, have been responded very favorably. Now, whether 
favorable comments translate into action on the part of companies, is 
yet to been seen.\\

THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY: PAVING OVER THE PUBLIC

>From the March, 1994 issue of *Z Magazine*

"...Huge companies are doing the most natural thing in the world to 
them; following their own corporate interest..." Herbert Schiller

Open Magazine Interview with Herbert Schiller

"Q- Your article in the Nation (July 12, 1993) suggests that 
commercial expansion [of  information/Internet] is resulting in the 
extinction of the public sphere. Can you comment more on this?

A- Yes. A clear example of this can be seen in the case of public 
libraries. The public library has been one of the most democratic 
institutions in American history. When you read biographical 
statements of this country's most distinguished writers, many times 
you'll find them describing what a tremendous debt, or what 
gratitude they owe to the public libraries. It was a place they 
entered without any real barriers, picked up a book, and read. The 
public library has been one of the most progressive institutions in 
American history. Yes, it's got deficiencies. No one's saying it's a 
perfect institution. But, by and large, in comparison, it's been a much 
more democratic institution than others. And one of the cardinal 
principles of the public library system is that information is to be 
available for everyone, and it's to be available without cost. Free. 
Funding comes from the community. Therefore, the principle of 
unlimited and free public access has been the cornerstone of this 
democratic institution.

And what's happening now? As with so many other things in this 
society, information is being turned into a good for sale. A good 
that's made available on the basis of payment, a commodity. Of 
course, information has always been part of commodities. Books and 
newspapers were always sold. But a really massive change has been 
under way due to the technologies that can transfer and reorganize 
bits of data and information, and now an area that never had the 
attention of private enterprise is being regarded as source of 
massive profit.

An information industry has been developing since 1968. Companies 
involved in the industry say they are doing very valuable things. It's 
true that they are creating certain information services that were 
never available before. One wouldn't argue with that. But they're 
doing it on a commercial basis, which means that information which 
once was or could have been available free, now is available for a 
charge. If you have any experience hooking your computer in with 
databases, you know that you have to pay."\\

SMOKING OUT THE OPPOSITION

The following came from Edupage, a summary of news items on 
information technology, that is provided several times each week 
online as a service by EDUCOM -- a consortium of leading colleges 
and universities seeking to transform education through the use of 
information technology.

Lawyers for the American Tobacco Co. were granted a subpoena for 
the membership list of a computer network used by anti-smoking 
groups. The move to acquire SCARCNet's (Smoking Control Advocacy 
Resource Network) records is believed to be the first legal action of 
this kind. The subpoena also demands the names of those funding 
the network and copies of all posted strategy sessions. Attorneys for 
the Advocacy Institute have filed papers seeking to deny the 
subpoena on First Amendment grounds. (Wall Street Journal
