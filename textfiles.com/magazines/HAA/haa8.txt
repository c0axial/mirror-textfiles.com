                        "How to rip off game machines"

I was at a restaraunt today wiht some friends, we ran out of money and their 
were games there. Of course you needed 25 cents. Well, we didnt have any 
money. So I took a business card that was in a box, on of those free things, 
ans I folded it up so that it would fit through the hole that the money goes 
in. I then shoved the card all the way in. The machine clicked. It worked!!!

I did that all day and got 30 free games.

   Note: this only works on those machines that have no littl button to push.
  Only the ones that are just a pice of metal with a slit through it. Actually
  you can try it with the other ones. I have never tried them before
