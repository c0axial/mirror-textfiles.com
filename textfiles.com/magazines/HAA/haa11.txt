Hey, this is a special release of HAA. It is our last issue. The last issue
under HAA. So, we have decided to rename ourselves \//olü.
(Writers Of Literature Forbidden). I feel that this is a cooler name because
it is a word, and it sound cooler and looks cooler. I would like to say that
the group will not be changed in any way except for the name. This means that
we have the same members and we are under the same administration. We, still
hate Red Mage. Post it everywhere!!!!!!!!!!....
We are NO LONGER the HAA. We are now refered to as \//olü
(Writers Of Literature Forbidden. Post it!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you....
