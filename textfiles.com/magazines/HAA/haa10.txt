        This is a file about the new rivalry of HAA and the biggest fuck-up, 
Red Mage. As far as I know he was talking shit about HAA and all of its 
members. At first we didnt pay to attention to the fag lowlife that he is, and
his remarks. Then he really started to piss us off. So, being the hackers that
we are, we hacked his account. We got his Password. Then, being the idiot that
he is, he used it on a ton of other boards too. The PW was GIVEITUP, he 
ELEGEDLY changed it. Since we did not care for him to go crying to his mommy,
we didnt fuck his account up at all. Instead we just looked around and maybe
dled a few files on his name. This little rivalry is far from over. I know
we sound like we nothing better to do but mess around with a LAMER like Red 
Mage. But, today in the hacking world, the little losers must learn their 
lessons. So, we want to say that Red Mage had better watch his step and not 
fuck with the HAA. The moral of this file is....



                        DONT FUCK WITH THE HAA

                        thank you..
