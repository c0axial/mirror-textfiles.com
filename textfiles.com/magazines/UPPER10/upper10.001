        What's up all of you 'zine kiddies out there?  Handle here coming
 atcha' with some ramblings for the cause of curing boredom.

        Okay, I know that I'm going to get bashed after this one, but I have a
 confession to make.  I've been hanging around with angst ridden alternateens
 for the past couple of months.  There I said it, ridicule me.

        Anyways, the whole point of this thing is to help some of you out
 there.  Have you read anything lately encouraging you to leave your computer
 and go outside into the "real world"?  If so it was probably making pretty
 good sense to you at the time.  Well being the true do-gooder that I am, I
 am writing this to tell you that the "real world" is crap.  Don't get your
 hopes up about going out and having fun, really doing something other than
 sitting around turning into a lump of crap, you'll just be disappointed.
 Truth is, everyone but me is a moron.  Look at this shit, don't turn on my
 computer for a month, and I've lost all of what little writing talent I used
 to have.  I tried the whole normal teenager thing and found that in order to
 succeed you have to stop thinking.  I'm not saying that you have to stop
 thinking for yourself and being an individual, I'm saying you have to become
 an un-educated hippy moron.

        I know this sounds like crap, but please try to put up with me while
 I attempt to slip back into my writing groove.  I've always thought that one
 of my flaws was I was blinded by hatred, but I was wrong, that was the only
 thing keeping me from turning into hippy scum.  I've now officially walked
 a mile in the shoes of a normal "Nirvana rulez!!"  teenager and can say that
 I was always right to hate them.  They really are morons, not just
 misunderstood by the educated.  What they are doing isn't fun, just
 non-productive.  So next time you get the urge to go, "hang" with the guys,
 don't do it.  Stay home and read a book, take it from me, it will help you
 out a lot more in the long run.  For the moment I have been tainted by teen
 idiocy.  Is it permanent?  I don't think so, I sure hope not.  Listen to me,
 I fit in for about 3/4 of one summer and I feel cheated.  I could have been
 set back for years.  FUCK YOU SHIT FOR BRAINS DO NOTHINGS!  YOU CAN ALL LICK
 A SWEATY COCK!  Please, I know it may sound rough, but we have to beat the
 hippies and not just join them.  Thank you, and good day.

        Wow, sure am glad I got all of that out, well welcome to my new 'zine
upper 10: The lemon-lime soda.  Promising to be the biggest piece of shit that
your ever going to look at.   Yeeehhaahhhhhhhhhh!

        We here at Upper 10 (namely me) have decided to lay out our beliefs
and what this whole zine' is all about... we like gum.  In adition to liking
gum, we also like 'zines.

        Now don't get me wrong, I have no intention of this 'zine taking off
but if you both like gum, and 'zines, then maybe you'd like to submit
something to our happy little establishment.  Of course you'll have to submit
your stuff to Mercuri because I'm technologically impaired.

        We here at Upper 10 would like to now take some time to congratulate
"Baywatch" on all of it's overseas success.  We here at Upper 10 also would
like to congratulate Slinky for being the worst piece of crap out there, next
to us.  We beat you! We beat you!
