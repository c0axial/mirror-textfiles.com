                            Edited slightly
                                  by

The blackout or as it is commonly referred to, the death posture, is
the technique that the late Austin Osman Spare refined for his own
magical use and which has been adopted by chaoists, solo and group,
world wide as its popularity has been increased by the works of the
IOT over the last decade or so.

The normal procedure, as many will undoubtedly be familiar with,
(and this is only one of its uses) is that a sigil/glyph of desire
is held in the mind`s eye whilst in what we all refer to as the
death posture e.g., stood on tiptoe, arms locked behind the head,
body stretched to its limit, deep spasmodic breathing, until total
exhaustion and the inevitable black out.  The sigil is then lost to
the mind of the operator and laughter is used to banish the sigil.

Anyone who has used this technique for the above said purpose, will
have at sometime or another experienced, even if just slightly,
difficulty in holding the posture long enough for the desired gnosis
to take effect sufficiently for blackout. And due to this
difficulty, a well planned ritual can be a well planned waste of
time if the desired result is not implanted properly.

A technique that has been repeatedly employed by myself on such
occasions is based upon the same principles as the death posture but
as I have found, a little easier and without the pitfalls that one
can experience with A.O. Spare`s technique.

This technique is a strange mixture of inhibitory and excitatory
gnosis, forced overbreathing, dancing or spinning, and of course
exhaustion. The end result is of necessity for this process the
blackout, which is as we know, of the inhibitory gnosis. I will now
explain how this technique is employed by one for the insertion of
sigils for whatever purpose one feels the need.

First one has to sigilise the desire in any form that one may wish,
but in all cases and especially this one, it must be very easy to
visualise. Once that has been achieved, one may then begin to design
the ritual for that particular purpose in mind. Banishings and
invocations may be employed, if so wished, this is, however, not a
necessity for the successful outcome of this process. At the
culmination of the rite the individual starts the overbreathing,
panting deeply and spasmodically and at the same time visualising
the sigil as vividly as you possibly can, bright, intense and very
clear as the overbreathing continues. Then when you feel that the
time is right, start your spinning round and round, still
overbreathing and still holding your visualised sigil in your mind`s
eye. Music can be played for a background to the dancing, tom toms
or any other drum is rather excellent background sound for this
purpose. When the individual has reached a state of sheer
exhaustion, very dizzy, sweating and ready to drop, he or she then,
still spinning and overbreathing and of course holding the visulised
sigil in mind, works their way to the centre of the circle or
working area.

There a partner, either active or passive to the rite, (in other
words, if a solo worker, try to get someone to help you with this
part) stops you spinning and grabs you in a bear hug lifting you off
the ground and squeezing you about the solar plexus, where a large
network of nerves lie. At this precise moment the music, if any has
been employed, is stopped, and death-like silence is kept. The
practitioner holds his or her breath whilst being squeezed and the
sigil is visualised as if burning with bright, white heat as its
image is burnt into your mind. Within seconds the blackout will
occur and the sigil is lost to the mind. At this point it is
important that your partner lets you drop to the floor, unless that
is you wish to return to primal chaos! (death).

On coming round, in most cases, you should evoke laughter to banish
the sigil and all thoughts thereof, your laughter breaks that
silence and the rite is finished in whatever manner wished.

********************************************************************

Overbreathing is essentially the same as hyperventilation and this
procedure is undoubtedly familiar to most readers in the form of
the popular high school age game of 'passing someone out'.

The dancing etc. is familiar to the rites of invocation used by
Voodoists, etc. and other primitive and modern religions.   

This can also be a very interesting experience even w/o the use
of a sigil.  Just eliminate the visualization instructions and 
go on with the motion, music, etc.  You WILL blackout if this
is done properly.  Thats a proven fact.

If you do it alone make sure you have a padded surface to fall down
on!
