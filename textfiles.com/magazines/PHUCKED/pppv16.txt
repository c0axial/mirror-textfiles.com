     The non-presidents inaugral address.
     Hopefully sometime in the near future.
     But probably not.



     "Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, took a giant step
BACKWARDS for mankind.  For he finalized the illusory notion that that
which is without is not within and that which is within is not without.
We are all on the moon at all times and on every other heavenly body
simultaneously.  The problem is one of consciousness.  Just as a blind
man at the base of a skyscraper has not the slightest notion of the
structures enormity, so are we who dwell only in our waking minds
trapped within the earthy sphere of physical being.  The conclusion
drawn from the above by the intelligent person will be as follows:  Neil
Armstrong never reached the moon.  He merely traversed a great physical
distance.  In fact he never even left the earth, the moon and all the
physical spheres being merely extensions of the earth separated from the
main mass by vast areas of low density.  It would be the gravest of
mistakes to mistake these physical areas of low density for the abyss.
The true blockade to real interstellar travel, the crossing of the
abyss, is the mind.  So therefore we must go beyond the mind by means
of the mind and it is for this purpose that I have founded Schismatrix,
an organization dedicated to the perfection of and the destruction of
the human mind.

     Schismatrix is, of course, a non-existent organizaton having no
leader, no charter, no members.  It is just a conception of the
solidarity existing amongst those who, like myself, have diverged from
every established group structure they have ever encountered.  Anyone
who ever thinks this thought by the mere act of thinking it becomes an
"honorary head" of the Schismatrix.  By the act of declaring oneself to
be a schismatic one establishes organization and is therefore
excommunicated. Thus it has no members.  I, just seconds ago, in
publicly declaring myself a member of the schismatrix was
excommunicated.  Therefore I am a renegade member.  The organization now
consists solely of myself until further members choose to excommunicate
themselves and join ranks with me.

     And that brings me to the reason I am speaking here today.  I am
the worlds first Psychonaut, a being dedicated to the exploration and
exploitation of the chaosphere, a place within ourselves where something
has the capacity to come forth from nothing.  I  hereby beseech all
non-members (those who are actually members) of the Schismatrix to
excommunicate themselves and join with me in my cause: the liberation of
mankind from all sources of dogma, tradition, and reason.  And I will
end my speech here to day with quotes from two very prominent and very
dead non-members of the Schismatrix.  Men who were devoted to the same
cause as myself in a time when this voluntary excommunication was even
more of a neccessity.

     'Enough of Because.  Be he damned for a Dog.'

     'Nothing is True.  Everything is Permitted.'

     'If the shoe fits steal it.'

     It is upon these three great principles, these true non-truths that
the Schismatrix party is built upon.  This is the only dogma... the
Non-Dogma."


     And so the movement swept across the nation, the world, and finally
the universe and the At-one-ment day came and the All was made safe for
Chaos  /   Anarchy / Consciousness / Peace / Bliss...

Constantine through which we manifested. (actually we just popped out of
his asshole one day and he looked down and typed us up and here we are
right now...)
