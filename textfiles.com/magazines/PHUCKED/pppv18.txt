                        (If Chaucer were a Rasta...)
                                
                                Feb. 14/91

                                    by

                      J O H N   C O N S T A N T I N E



     While on a solitary hiking excursion through the

forests of Jamaica I met a rastafarian recluse with an

amazing tale.  A couple days ago I had arrived in Jamaica

ready to continue the ethnobotanical studies I had begun at

school in the U.S.A.  I had left the small village, where I

was staying, at dawn.  It was now approximately 3:00 P.M.,

judging by the suns position.  The air was hot, steamy, and

drawing breath was like sucking on a steampipe.  The hike

had been mostly over flat land but now I was approaching a

steep hill covered with dense vegetation.


     The nearer I got to the hill, the tougher the going

got.  After reaching the hills foot I decided to break camp

for the day, planning to resume my travels in the morning.

After about one half hours rest I noticed an irregular

stream of smoke rising from a rocky outcropping atop the

hill.  It rose in a strange sort of puffing pattern, like

indian smoke signals.  The bush was far too thick for me to

make out the source at this distance but I assumed it was

some kind of small cooking fire, probably outside a crazy

old hermit's hut.


     The brief rest and my aroused curiosity were enough to

give me a second wind.  So I started trudging slowly uphill.

As I neared the outcropping a familiar smell reached my

nostrils, lighting a fire beneath my feet.  Soon I could

make out the smokes source.  On a rocky platform painted

with neon rastafarian symbols sat a cross legged native,

face obscured by dreadlocks the color and texture of steel

wool.  He was smoking a hookah about three or four times the

size of my head.  An evolutionary step above the caterpillar

in 'Alice In Wonderland' he blew smoke letters, not just

plain O's, but a whole alphabet plus a library of

rastafarian symbols unrecognizable to me.  In fact, as I was

to learn later, he could blow whole motion pictures, not

just black and white but in color, with subtitles!


     "Jah love, brotha", he blew, raising his right hand in

silent greeting.


     Being an ethnobotanist, with a keen interest in

psychoactive plants, I had to know exactly what he was

smoking.  "Howdy.  What's in the bowl, friend?"


     "Nuthin but da best, mon.  It's da last o I stash.  I

would be honored if ya will smoke wit I, mon.", the letters

drifted slowly downwind.


     "Be glad to please you.", I said lowering my mouth

towards the hookah.


     The rastafarian symbols, particularly the towers of

Babylon, took on a special significance as I happily

exhaled, passing the hookah back to it's owner.


     "So what ya come up here for, mon?  Looking for da holy

man at the mountaintop?  Not I, mon.  I just a burnt ole

man."


     "Actually, I'm interested in plants... psychedelic

plants.  I'm searching for the perfect drug."


     "If Jah made better than this, mon, I know he be smokin

it hisself right now."


     "... Well, mon, there may be better."


     After saying this to me, or rather puffing it, he took

a long pull on the hookah after which he began projecting a

moving smoke movie... in color!  Against the still blue sky,

the performance was amazingly clear.

     This rasta had obviously left his rock not too long ago

because, in the style of 1990's movies, his came complete

with previews and even a Coca-Cola commercial before the

main event.


     A young boy is sleeping, dreaming of Coca-Cola.  He is

driving down an unmarked highway paved with rusting Coke

cans, when suddenly the road begins peeling from the ground,

angling up into a black void.  After a long drive during

which he begins to panic a red blotch far down the road

comes into sight.  Soon it is recognizable, a Coke machine.

The boy gets out and touches it.  The machine collapses into

a paper coupon for a free case which the boy folds up, puts

in his back pocket, and later redeems.


     The two previews were incomprehensible.  The old man

was probably projecting his hallucinations, so I'll get

right to the movie which was a rastafied version of

Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale.


***


     Dark thunderclouds gathered over a small town on an

unnamed island.  The first droplets of cold rain were

beginning to fall, wetting the occupants of the leaky tavern

below.  The smoky air swirled as the rasta zoomed in on the

back corner table.  Three beings sat there drinking

recklessly and smoking like chimneys, a younger version of

the rasta, whose name I later found out was Aerol, a yellow

and red striped snake, and a ganja farmer named Maelcum.

Following the snakes advice both men had renounced

meditation and religion.  They now sought enlightenment in

ganja and other psychedelics for the snake had told them,

"Zion is a state of mind."


     Long into the night the snake filled their minds with

heinous lies and misinterpretations of the truth.  At 2:45

A.M. a messenger burst in bearing sad news for Aerol.  His

brother had just been brutally murdered by the islands

scourge, Death.


     "Death, my friends...", the snake hissed, "can take one

south to Babylon or up to Zion.  I say we find this Death

and Zion."


     The two friends, enraged at the fate of Aerol's

brother, quickly agreed.  Despite the protests of their

friends the two could not be dissuaded from this plan.

After stopping briefly at Aerol's home for weapons they set

out into the now pouring rain.  The snake slithered swiftly

behind, giving directions.


     Here the old rasta paused a moment to catch his breath

and to comment on what a fool he had been.  Then, in a puff

of smoke, he continued.


     The trio had come to a three pronged fork in the road.

From down the middle road an old man, withered horribly by

age, approached.


     "Greetings friend!  What news have you of a specter

named Death?  He is said to be roaming this island.  Indeed

he has just slain my brother."


     "You are lucky", the old man slowly muttered, "to be

speaking with me at this time for I have just seen Death.

Simply take the wrong fork in this road and you cannot miss

him."


     At this Aerol replied, "And which road, old sir, is the

wrong road?"


     "With that wretched guide you cannot follow any road

but the wrong."  With that he spat hatefully at the coiled

serpent.  In response the snake struck out, sinking it's

long fangs into the old mans groin.


     "Come, we have lingered to long.", the snake commanded.


     With the snake now in the lead the two young men

marched down the wrong road. (The old rasta had it labeled

with big puffy red cloud-like lettering.)  Soon they came to

a greenhouse containing a small forest of hydroponic ganja,

the most powerful variety ever known to mankind, a highly

addictive hybrid.


     "Zion!", the two men exclaimed and the snake nodded in

silent agreement.


     "This was not here before Maelcum.  We must harvest,

sell, and smoke before it is discovered."


     "Certainly.", replied the snake, "Aerol and I must

stand guard while you bring supplies.  Hurry!  We must

harvest before..."


     An strange glance passed between the friends and

without exchange of words they decided to kill the snake as

it was no longer needed.  Before it could finish speaking

the deed was done.


     "Maelcum, get supplies now.  Hurry!"


     "Be back real soon Aerol."


     As Maelcum's figure faded away into the nights

blackness Aerol began planning his death.


***


     After sneaking back into town Maelcum went straight to

a weapons shop.  For a small amount he purchased a rusting

dagger with a comfortable grip.  It would be perfect for the

job.  After a stop at the only market in town open at this

hour he prepared a final meal for his former friend then

gathered enough gardening gear for one man.

     

***


     Back at the greenhouse Aerol stood quietly behind the

door, a straight razor open in his hand.


     "Aerol, mon, lets eat...".  With a sickly wet sound the

razor ripped Maelcum's throat wide open.


     Grinning widely, knowing he need never work another day

in his life, Aerol plucked a sticky bud and swallowed it.


     One hour later, as it took effect, he muttered sadly,

"I am in Babylon...  Jah save me!"


***


     As the massive hookahs contents slowly burned out the

old rasta puffed out dying words, "You are following the

wrong road, mon, turn back and meet I in Zion... Jah be with

you."
