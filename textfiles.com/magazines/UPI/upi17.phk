    Hello, ...  Hello?  yes we are still around, before anything else I would
like to apologize for the incredible time it took us to produce this issue.  As
a result of the tremendous time between issue number six, and this issue, some
of the articles in the UPi Underground Newsline may presently be quite ancient.
We have no real excuse for this except that we had too many late night
conferences with all our friends in australia.  Right Anthony?

    However, let me now bring you up to date on what has been happening with
the group.  The Darkman, formerly NukE prezident applied to UPi the day of his
retirement from nuke, he was accepted into the group.  You will also see some
other new names in the UPi members list.

    UPi magazine can now also be downloaded off five different anonymous FTP
sites.  When you venture further down the page you will come accross these
addresses.

    The article from Black Flag on how to build the frequency modulator that
was previously promised to be in this issue, will regretfully not be appearing.
Black Flag apparrently did build a working modulator however once he was
finished he never wrote the article!

                     Mad Matt's Introduction To Explosives!


(Editor's Note: The author of this articel wishes to stay anonymous.)

Primary and High Explosives:

Explosives are substances which go through rapid decomposition, and
simultaneous release of energy, with some upon the application of heat
but usually upon the application of a shockwave, (a sudden localized
increase in mechanical pressure).  Many High Explosives if ignited by
flame will just burn, and a couple are not flammable at all.  A stick
of dynamite, if lit by a match will merely burn, but if placed on a
metal anvil and struck with a hammer or blasted with a blasting cap,
it will explode.  The reaction is transmitted within the explosive,
self-propagated by the pressure shockwave, not by flame.  Explosives
will detonate without any confinement, but are usually put into some
sort of container to hold them in place for the shockwave, otherwise
the first part of the explosion would just blow away the remainder of
the explosive like dust in a wind storm, rather than detonating it.
Other substances may be added to the explosive to increase or decrease
its sensitivity to detonation, or to enhance its power.

Detonating Cord, also called Fuze, (with a Z,) is a long tube (that
looks like heavy wire,) that contains a Primary or High Explosive.
It is used to transmit an explosive shockwave from the point of its
detonation to the major explosive it in turn is to detonate.  This
is in contrast to Fuse, (with an S,) which is used to transmit flame.
Detonating Cord is used professionally with explosives because of its
much higher reliability in comparison with Fuse.  Detonating Cord may
occasionally be used to directly detonate a mass of High Explosive,
though it is usually used to detonate a Blasting Cap of Primary
Explosive with then detonates the High Explosive.

Primary Explosive, (also known as Initiating Explosives,) are especially
sensitive to shock, heat, flame and friction.  Being so sensitive, they
are extremely dangerous.  They are sometimes more powerful than the
High Explosives, and are typically more expensive to manufacture in
quantity.  Blasting Caps are mainly composed of Primary Explosives.
Primary Explosives are used to convert the flame of a fuse or squib,
or the shockwave of Detonating Cord into a very powerful shockwave to
explode a mass of High Explosive.

High Explosives are chemical compounds or mixtures similar in some ways
to the Primary Explosives, but they are very much less sensitive to
detonation.  In small quantities most will just gently burn.  For
reliable detonation they should be exploded by a Primary Explosive
(Blasting Cap).  They are very much safer to handle, (from an
explosion standpoint,) than the Primaries, and are usually much less
expensive to manufacture in quantity.  From a view to safety, High
Explosives should make up the vast majority of any (but the smallest)
explosive device you may decide to experiment with.


Primary Explosives

HMTD (Hexamethylenetriperoxidediamine)
Materials Needed:
2 Containers (the smaller one should be glass)
Hydrogen Peroxide Solution (3% or stronger -6% to 15% are best)
Citric Acid
Hexamethylenetetramine (see chemical synthesis section)

Method:
-Place a beaker or glass jar containing 60 ml (2 fluid ounces) of
 6% Hydrogen Peroxide solution (twice as much if it is 3%) into a
 larger jar, containing crushed ice and a little water to cool the inner
 jar
-Add 2 teaspoons (4 g) of Hexamethylenetetramine (Hexamine), and
 stir until dissolved
-Add 3 teaspoons (6 g) of Citric Acid and stir until dissolved.
-Do not add any more ice to the outside container.  Allow the ice to melt.
-Let the mixture sit for 24 hours and a white precipitate will have
 formed on the bottom of the jar.  Pour this mixture through a filter
 paper and the white material will be left on the paper.  Pour water
 through the filter to wash this white material.  Throw away the liquid.
 Dry the white powder which is HMDT, Primary Explosive.

This material will explode from a sharp blow or if quickly heated
above 200xC (392xF).  If heated over 70xC (158xF) for periods of time
or if boiled in water it will harmlessly decompose.  It is very
flammable.  HMTD is somewhat corrosive and is toxic.  It is insoluble
in water or alcohol.


DDNP
DDNP, diazodinitrophenol, is a primary explosive.  It is extensively
used in commercial blasting caps that are initiated by black powder
safety fuse.  It is superior to mercury fulminate in stability but is
not as stable as lead azide.  DDNP is desensitized by immersion in water.
In Blasting Caps it can be used with a booster explosive such as RDX
or Picric Acid (see the High Explosives section)
Materials Needed:
Picric Acid (see the High Explosives section)
Sulfur
Lye (Sodium Hydroxide)
Sulfuric Acid, diluted
Potassium Nitrite
Water
2 Pyrex beakers
Stirring Rod (glass or wood)

Method:
-In one of the beakers, mix 0.5 g of lye with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of
 warm water.
 Dissolve 1 teaspoon (3.0 g) of Picric Acid in the water-lye solution.
-Place 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) of water in the other beaker.  Add
 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) of sulfur and 1/3 teaspoon (2.5 g) of lye to
 the water.
 Boil this second solution over heat until the colour turns dark red.
 Remove from the heat and allow this solution to cool.
-In three portions, add this sulfur-lye solution to the Picric Acid-
 Lye solution; stir while pouring.  Allow the new mixture to cool.
-Filter the mixture through a paper towel into a container.  Small red
 particles will collect on the paper.  Discard the liquid
-Dissolve the red particles in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of boiling water.
 Remove and filter the mixture through a paper towel (or filter paper)
 but this time discard the particles left on the paper and save the
 liquid.
-Using an glass eyedropper, slowly add the sulfuric acid to the filtered
 solution until it turns orange-brown.  Add 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) more
 of sulfuric acid to the solution.  Allow the solution to cool to
 room temperature.
-In a separate container, dissolve 1/4 teaspoon (1.8 g) of Potassium
 Nitrite, in 1/3 cup (80 ml) of water.  Add this solution, while
 stirring, to the orange-brown solution.  Allow the mixture to stand
 for 10 minutes.  The mixture will turn light brown.
[CAUTION: AT THIS POINT THE MIXTURE IS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE.  KEEP IT
AWAY FROM FLAME.]
-Filter the mixture through a paper towel or filter paper.  Wash the
 particles left on the paper with 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of water.
-Allow the particles to dry (approximately 16 hours)
[CAUTION: EXPLOSIVE IS SHOCK AND FLAME SENSITIVE.  STORE THE
EXPLOSIVE IN A CAPPED CONTAINER.]


Lead Picrate
Material Needed:
Picric Acid (See the High Explosives preparation section)
Litharge (See the chemical synthesis section)
Methyl Hydrate (Methanol)
Method:
-Weigh out typically 2 g of Picric Acid and 2 g of Lead Monoxide
-Add the Picric Acid to 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of methanol in a container
 and stir
-Add the lead monoxide
-Continue stirring and allow the methanol to evaporate.
 NOTE: The mixture will suddenly thicken
-Carefully break up this mixture and stir occasionally until a powder
 is formed (a few lumps will remain).
-Remove and spread out to air dry

Lead Picrate is easily detonated by shock, spark or heat.


Tetramminecopper (II) Chlorate
Materials Needed:
Sodium Chlorate (see chemical synthesis section)
Copper Sulfate
Ammonium Hydroxide (Household ammonia)
Alcohol (Ethanol/Ethyl Alcohol 93% or better purity)
Method:
-Measure 1/3 teaspoons (2.5 g) of Sodium Chlorate in a wide mouth bottle
 and ass 10 teaspoons of the alcohol
- Add 1 teaspoon (4 g) of Coper Sulfate and stir the mixture just under
 the boiling point for 30 minutes (heat can be supplied by a pan of hot
 water).  The mixture will change colour.  CAUTION:  KEEP THE SOLUTION
 AWAY FROM FLAME
-Keep the volume of the solution constant by adding additional alcohol
 about every 10 minutes.  Remove solution and let cool.  Filter through
 folded paper towels or filter paper into another wide mouth bottle or
 beaker.  Keep the liquid.
-Add 1 cup (250 ml) of ammonia to a narrow mouth bottle, (pop bottle,
 or a flask).  Place tubing so that it extends about 4 cm inside the
 bottle, then seal the tubing to the bottle with wax (clay, gum, etc).
-Place the other end of the tubing into the beaker (or wide mouthed
 bottle from the earlier step.  Heat the sealed bottle containing the
 ammonia in a pan of hot water (not boiling) for about 10 minutes.
-Bubble ammonia gas through the first solution (in the beaker) until
 the colour of the solution changes from a light green to a dark blue
 (approximately 10 minutes) and continue bubbling for another 10 minutes.
CAUTION: AT THIS POINT THE SOLUTION CONTAINS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE.
KEEP IT AWAY FROM FLAME.
-Reduce the volume of the solution to about 1/3 of its original volume
 by evaporating it in the air or a stream of air.  You may wish to
 speed up the evaporation by pouring the solution into a flat glass
 casserole pan.
-Filter the solution through a paper coffee filter and wash the crystals
 that remain in the paper with 1 teaspoon of alcohol and set the
 crystals aside to dry (approximately 16 hours)
CAUTION: THIS EXPLOSIVE IS SHOCK AND FLAME SENSITIVE.  STORE IN A
CAPPED CONTAINER.


HIGH EXPLOSIVES:


PICRIC ACID
Materials Needed:
Aspirin (20 tablets, preferably the no-name A.S.A. tablets)
Alcohol (Ethanol/Ethyl Alcohol 93% pure or better)
Concentrated Sulphuric Acid
Potassium Nitrate (Saltpetre)
Method:
-Crush 20 tablets of aspirin in a glass container and work into a
 paste with a teaspoon or water.
-Add approximately 1/3 to 1/2 cup (100 ml) of alcohol with stirring
 and filter through filter paper into another glass container
-Discard the solid left on the paper and pour the liquid from the
 container into a flat dish or glass casserole pan.  Let the alcohol
 and water evaporate, leaving a white powder.
-Take some sulfuric acid and boil it in a beaker or heat resistant
 Pyrex container until the fumes change to white fumes and immediately
 remove the heat at this point.  This boils off the water leaving you
 with Concentrated Sulfuric Acid.
-Add the white powder to 1/3 cup (80 ml) of concentrated Sulfuric Acid
 in a glass jar
-Heat the jar in a simmering hot water bath for 15 minutes and remove.
-Stir; the solution will gradually turn to a yellow-orange colour.
-Add 3 level teaspoons (15 g) of Potassium Nitrate in three portions
 with vigorous stirring.  The solution will turn red, and then back to
a yellow-orange colour.
-Allow the solution to cool to room temperature while stirring
 occasionally.
-Slowly pour the solution, while stirring, into 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) of
 cold water and allow to sit for a few minutes.
-Filter the solution through filter paper into a glass container.
 Light Yellow particles will collect on the paper.  This is Picric Acid.
 It might take considerable time to filter.
-Let the filter paper and the Picric acid dry.  It may take 16 hours
 or more, (or you can keep it at 70-90xC/160-200xF for two hours).
 The yield should be about 4 grams of Picric Acid.  Picric acid has
 about the same power as TNT.


RDX (Cyclonite)
Materials Needed:
Concentrated Nitric Acid (90 to 100% concentration)
Hexamethylenetetramine (see the Chemical Synthesis section)
a 1000 ml (1 Litre, 5 cup) beaker or glass coffee pot
an ice water bath (large enough to hold the beaker listed above)
a hot water bath  (large enough to hold the beaker listed above)
Method:
-Prepare the large ice water bath.  1/2 cup (125 ml) of Concentrated
 Nitric Acid are cooled, if necessary, to 20xC (68xF) in the beaker or
 glass coffee pot.  1 1/2 ounces (40 g) of Hexamethylenetetramine are
 slowly added over 15 minutes, while stirring and carefully watching
 the temperature.  You will soak the beaker in the ice water bath to
 keep the temperature of the Nitric Acid between 20xC and 30xC
 (68xF to 86xF).  You will need a glass thermometer to keep track of
 the temperature.  The glass thermometer may also be used to stir the
 solution.  When all of the Hexamine has been dissolved, place your
 beaker in the hot water bath, to heat up the Nitric Acid to 55xC
 (131xF).  Let this hot water bath and beaker of chemicals naturally
 cool to within 10xC (18xF) of room temperature.  Add 2 to 3 cups
 (500 to 750 ml) of cold water to the beaker of chemicals.  White
 particles will begin to appear in the solution.  Filter off the
 liquid and wash the white powder several times with cold water.
 (If you have Acid/Base Indicator Paper, continue washing the RDX until
 the water registers a neutral pH of about 7).  Discard the liquid.
 This white powder is RDX High Explosive.

RDX will detonate from very strong impact.  It will not detonate, even
if heated to 360xC (680xF).  It is very poisonous.  It is not
soluble in water but 1 part RDX will dissolve in 10 parts Acetone.
RDX is 1+ times as powerful as TNT.


Plastic Explosive made from RDX
Method:
Thoroughly mix 10 parts by weight of motor oil to 90 parts dry RDX, to
make a variation of C-4 (Military) Plastic Explosive.


          Chemical Synthesis and Supplies

Alcohol (Ethanol, Ethyl Alcohol): is available in 93% concentration
     from all Pharma Plus Drug stores  (make sure you are getting the
     ethyl alcohol and NOT the isopropyl alcohol which is usually a
     70% concentration.  It is sometimes labelled as rubbing alcohol
     but make sure you are getting the correct type of alcohol.)

Ammonia (Household Ammonia, Ammonia Water, Ammonium Hydroxide):
     is available at any grocery store

Citric Acid: a white powder used in food preservation, available from
     drug stores and some food stores

Copper Sulfate: Is available from school chemistry labs, hobby or
     science shops for plating items with copper, and at some farm and
     garden suppliers as an anti-fungicide.

Formaldehyde: Farm and Gardening Suppliers as an anti-fungicide for seeds

Hexamethylemetetramine (Hexamine): is an easily produced substance
     used in the manufacture of HMTD (primary explosive) and RDX
     (high explosive).  This should be manufactured outside because of
     the smell.  Add 1 volume of Formaldehyde (37% solution typically,)
     to 4 volumes of Household Ammonia.  Mix thoroughly and let this
     smelly pair evaporate.  You might want to do this in a flat
     container (like a glass casserole pan) to speed things up.  You
     may also wish to put this container into a hot water bath to speed
     things up further.  After several days of evaporation, you will be
    left with a fairly dry powder, which is Hexamethylenetetramine.

Hydrogen Peroxide (Hair Bleach): A clear liquid, 3 to 6% solutions are
    available from drug stores, up to 15% concentrations are available
     from beauty supply shops.

Lead Monoxide (Litharge): Is used in the manufacture of Lead Picrate
     primary explosive.  To make this material see Potassium Nitrite.

Lye (Sodium Hydroxide): Is available at most hardware stores

Methyl Hydrate (Wood Alcohol, Methanol, Methyl Alcohol): Available at
     Hardware stores (it is poisonous, DO NOT DRINK IT)

Nitric Acid: A Clear or Yellowish liquid, extremely corrosive, available
     from school chemistry labs, (can easily be stolen from the
     University of Toronto Chemistry building, Wallberg Building,
     184 College Street, the basement labs and supply rooms are your
     best bet,) or you can manufacture as follows:
     Concentrated (95 to 100%) Nitric Acid may be produced from
     Concentrated Sulfuric Acid and Potassium Nitrate (Saltpetre).
     Add 100 g. (about 1+ volumes) of Potassium Nitrate to 35 ml
     (or 1 volume) of Concentrated Sulfuric Acid.  If this mixture is
     gently heated it will boil off the Nitric Acid as fumes which can
     be condensed back into Concentrated Nitric Acid.  Your final volume
     of Concentrated Nitric Acid should be about the same as the original
     volume of Concentrated Sulfuric Acid.  Beware: Nitric Acid and its
     fumes are toxic and extremely corrosive.  They will not affect
     Glass or Teflon but will eat through most other materials, including
     skin.  Try to do these procedures out-of-doors.  Many chemistry
     texts books give further information on the equipment needed to
     distil Nitric Acid.

Potassium Nitrate (Saltpetre): Is available at most drug stores

Potassium Nitrite:  Used in the manufacture of DDNP primary explosive
     This can be manufactured (along with litharge/lead
     monoxide at the same time as needed for lead picrate) as follows:
     Materials needed:
     Lead metal (available as lead shot for rifle shot refills, or
                 in hobby shops for stained glass work)
     Potassium Nitrate (Saltpetre)
     Methyl Hydrate
     Iron Pipe
     Method:
     -Mix 3 parts by weight of Lead with 1 part by weight Potassium
      Nitrate.  Place the mixture in the iron pipe and heat in a hot
      bed of coals or by a blow torch for an hour
     -remove the container and allow to cool.  Chip out the yellow solid
      with a screwdriver, put into a jar and add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of
      Methyl Hydrate, giving an orange-brown creamy colour.
     -Heat the container with the mixture in a hot water bath until it
      reacts giving a darker colour.
     -Filter the mixture through filter paper
     -The solid left on the paper is Lead Monoxide (Litharge).  Take
      the paper and place it over a different (and empty) glass container
      wash it through the paper twice, using 1/2 cup (120 ml) of hot
      water each time, then air dry this Lead monoxide before using it
      to prepare Lead Picrate.
     -Place the jar with the original liquid (not the washing water)
      in a hot water bath until the Methyl Hydrate has evaporated.
      The remaining snowy white sludge is water and Potassium Nitrite.
      Keep this in a closed container as it has a tendency to absorb
      additional moisture from the air.  Use this material in the
      manufacture of DDNP.

Sodium Chlorate:  An oxidizer for incendiaries, rocket propellants,
     and in the manufacture of Tetramminecopper Chlorate explosive.
     It can be obtained from school or manufactured as follows:
     Materials Needed:
     Two Carbon Rods
     Salt Water
     Sulfuric Acid (Diluted)
     12 volt car battery charger (or a car battery while engine is running)
     Method:
     -Mix 1/2 cup of salt with 3 cups (3 litres) of water in a glass
      container.
     -Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously
      for 5 minutes.
     -Connect the two carbon rods using heavy wires to the 12 volt
      power source.  Make sure the two rods stay 4 to 5 cm (1+ to 2
      inches) apart at all times.  DO NOT ALLOW THE RODS TO SHORT OUT!
     -Submerge 5 to 15cm (2 to 6 inches) of length on the rods into the
      solution.  Do not allow the copper wires to touch the solution.
     -Apply power for two hours then stop for two hours, then repeat
      for two days.
     -Filter this solution through filter paper and throw out the
      solid material captured in the filter paper.
     -Take the solution and place it in a flat pan and allow the water
      to evaporate.  (Placing the pan in a hot water bath can dramatically
      speed up the evaporation.)  The powder that remains is Sodium
      Nitrate.

Sodium Nitrite:  Can be used instead of Potassium Nitrite in the
     manufacture of DDNP primary explosive.  It can be manufactured by
     heating Sodium Nitrate in a pyrex test tube or beaker over a flame
     for 10 to 15 minutes.  It will give off oxygen, and Sodium Nitrite
     will remain.  (Do not use this method for Potassium Nitrate as it
     will NOT give you Potassium Nitrite, but instead Potassium oxide.)

Sulfuric Acid:  can be bought from Jeweller, Chemical or Metal Plating
     Suppliers and is usually 98 to 100% pure (Concentrated).  Car
     Battery Acid is available from Automotive Supply Shops (but not
     Canadian Tire,) and is only 40% Sulfuric acid and 60% water.
     Gently boil this in a Pyrex glass container, such as a beaker or
     a glass pyrex coffee pot, until the temperature rises above 120xC
     (248xF) and/or white fumes start to be given off.  Let it cool
     and store it in its original glass container.  This is now
     Concentrated Sulfuric Acid and is 98 to 100% pure.

Filter Paper:  You can get real filter paper from school, or use
     Paper Coffee filters available at any grocery store.  You may
     also use a few layers of paper towelling but this usually doesn't
     filter very well.

     UPi is a very serious H/P group but once in a while one needs
a good laugh.  Many of the satirical text files have been utter
bullshit and just for a laugh.  But I have come up with a few ideas
of things you can do to aggravate your neighbourhood geeks, ex-
girlfriends, etc.  Most of these I have tried and all of them are
realistic.  This file is written for those who are not experienced
in certain types of phreaking such as canning therefor if you can't
figure this stuff out don't even bother reading UPi again.  Of
course this is just for information purposes and I do not support
you doing this stuff in any shape, way or form.

Phone Bills
------------
------------------------------------------------------------
This would be best done when the parents are on vacation,
or late at night to reduce being caught
------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1

     Make a beige box.  For those illiterates out there a beige box
is just a handset basically.  You can either steal one from a Bell
van or just go to a Biway and buy the cheapest phone you can find
that has a dialer on the handset (where you speak into).  With that
cheap phone cut off the wires connecting the handset to the rest of
the phone and connect alligator clips to the end (Any further
information can be found in countless Beige Box text files on a
H/P/A/C/V board near you).  One thing you might want to look for is
a phone that lights up the dialer pad to a certain degree (reduces
the need for a flashlight).  There is one alternative.  You can buy
at Radio Shack a thing that emits DTMF through it.  I bought a
watch that did the same thing.  This mean you can use any type of
handset even without a dialer but hanging up will be made more
difficult.  You will have to disconnect the alligator clips or make
a dift box.  Anyways as I said before you can find more on beige
boxing elsewhere.

Step 2

     Do a quick look over the victims house (exterior) during the
day and locate his bell box (Make sure you have indeed found the
bell box and not his electric meter or something).  Now go back
home and return at nightfall.  Now move over to the box and hit it
upwards (like hit the bottom of it on the edges).  Now it will lift
up and you will see a minimum of 2 wires (if this guy actually has
a damn phone!).  So you will have to fool around with the negative
and positive clips on the wire but soon you will get either a dial
tone or someone speaking.  If someone is speaking just listen in
(But if the person starts wandering where the noises of the cars
are coming from hangup if you want to play it safe).  If you get a
dial tone continue to step 3.


Step 3

     Now the fun starts.  If you want to be bland call up one of
your LD friends(preferably in Australia or Europe) and just talk.
This will give the guy a might big phone bill but with a certain
degree of persuasion they will be able to get bell to drop the
bill.  Plus from recent news Bell has figured out a way to match
numbers and shit so if you thing your own line might be under
surveillance it isn't a good idea to call everyone you do on your
own line.  So fuck that and go onto step 4.

Step 4

     The best way to get there parents after them is by calling up
Gay/Lesbian lines (1-800-Not-STR8 or whatever they are).  Imagine
there parents faces <grin>.  It sure will take them a hell of
persuasion.  Of course you don't want to listen to this shit
(Unless you are a flaming homosexual) so just keep the line open
all night (if you are smart you can figure it out (and DON'T leave
your handset).


Step 5

     Ordering features to ones phone has always been an interesting
and fun thing to do.  I recently got a book in the mail that showed
all of the features that were offered.  There are presently 10 or
11 features offered by Mother Bell and if you ordered all of them
it would end up being anywhere from 30$-45$ a month (so if they
are on holiday or something it will rack up).  But that isn't the
purpose of it since it is much easier to create a huge phone bill
by starting up a conference (In Canada call the operator then ask
for the tele-conference operator).  The reason for this is to
totally fuck them up.  In general it will take a few days for Bell
to set it up if that makes a difference to you.  (Oh BTW don't call
the operator to get services.  I believe you must call Customer
Service (look on your own phone bill on in the phone book for the
number in your area)).  After all is set up they won't be able to
figure out what button does what on there phone any more.  And  if
possible find out what features they have already (generally easy
from your handset).




     There are many ways to use your beige box to screw people up
but I figure chances are if you don't have one already you won't
make one so the rest of the file is dedicated to those who don't
know a thing about anything.

Legal Trouble
--------------------

     Legal trouble is always the best way to screw your
neighbourhood geek.

Step 1

     Go find yourself a credit card number (It isn't difficult if
you leave close to a business/commercial district).  If you can't
figure out how to get a hold of a number read a text file on
Trashing.

Step 2

     This is quite an awkward approach to carding but order to the
guys house tonnes of stuff.  Like everything the is possible to
card.  The more you card to his house the better.  The best part
about this is if the guy keeps the shit and gets nailed he can't
say he didn't do it because he has the stuff in his house!  And if
the guy doesn't get nailed you can always steel it from him later.


Step 3

     Back to the beige box.  Use it to call up
RCMP/FBI/CIA/SCOTLAND YARD/RCMP whatever.  Any legal organization.
Then use your imagination.  These numbers are a little harder to
get a hold of but if all else fails there is always the local
police.  There are two things to watch for.  Don't do any false
calls.  That will require a large amount of police/firemen.  By
doing this you might end up killing people who actually need it.
But if you like killing innocent people go ahead.  And the second
thing is to make sure you get the hell out of there quickly.  It
would be a real pain if the cops come and you are seen on the side
of the house with a phone in your hand.  If you are a little horny
you can always call up the operator and have a chat with her
<grin>.

 Step 4

     There is another way to get back at someone that wouldn't
necessary bring them legal trouble but I suppose it could if you
did it properly.  What one does is order food to someone's house.
I mean not a little but a lot.  Like 3 pizza's from one place.
Chinese from another, etc.  The best way to do this is just call
from a Pay Phone (Make sure that it will except incoming calls
because some of the newer ones don't).  Give them the Pay Phone
number as call back.  Now stick around for a few minutes incase
they need to call back for verification (Don't stay for more the 5
minutes).  Now go to your victim's house (The best person to do
this to is the person across the street to your house since you can
sit in the comfort of your living home to watch).  This is one of
the most humorous things I have done so far so if you are a little
risk taker go for it.  Otherwise continue to live you boring life.





Scaring the shit out of people
-------------------------------------------

     Anyone can do a normal prank/threading call as anyone in a UPi
run conference will have found out.  The real trick is to scare the
shit out of them.  One way to do this is to connect your beige box
(I think I should have dedicated this file to 101 things you can do
with your beige box) to your enemy's phone line and while they are
on the line just break into it and either threaten them (say you
are in the house or something) or get a tape recording of some
tonnes and make yourself seem like the operator and tell them you
have an urgent phone call on the line.  Now pass the handset to you
friend and get him to act like a doctor and bullshit about there
parents being killed in a car crash or something <Haha.  Imagine
their faces>.  Now of course they will believe who you say you are
if you interrupt there call because 99% of the people out there
don't even know they have an exterior telephone box.

Ofcourse having a friend with you while doing all of this adds to
the humour/excitement.  However if you are a loner and need
something to do on a Friday night there you go.  I gave you
something that will keep you busy for a few weekends.

Vandalism
----------

There are many ways to vandalize someones property.  But if you
want to mix both vandalism with some pyrotechnics then here is
something for you.  I found this out by accident basically (Just
felt like sticking some extra things into a bomb.  Anyways included
is a plan of the suggested layout for the bomb.  I have found the
best thing to use is a piece of PVC pipe (You can vary the length
depending on the effect you want).  Drill a hole the size of your
fuse around the centre of the pipe).  On one end stick a PVC cap
and stuff some tissue paper (or newspaper which ever is easier to
obtain).  You only need a little bit of this and it is just to
absorb a bit of the pressure and to prevent the powder from going
where you don't want it to.  For the powder you can use whatever
you want.  If you can't get ahold of anything one easy method of
obtaining explosive powder is hardware stores sell shells for nail
guns.  There are many kinds depending on the force that one would
want to drive the nail in (and depending on the material you stick
it in).  So if you are going use this method experiment with the
burning rates,etc.  The best is to stick the fastest burning near
the wick if you want it to explode quickly).  Anyways the problem
with this method is that they are EXPENSIVE.  Is you buy the ones
in the shell just compress one end (the one that opens) slightly
and the pry it open.  This is a VERY stupid thing to do because
enough friction can occur for it to ignite.  So be careful if you
do it.  There are also ones that come in strips and have little
round tablets of gunpowder. If you get this type you will have to
crush them. Stick some time a fuse in a hole that you made in the
centre of the tube (Atleast one inch in).  Once you fill the tube
up with fuel oxidizer use a pencil or something of that nature to
pack it.  Now fill the other end with blue chalk (This is used in
chalk lines for construction and can be bought at a hardware store
in 2 colours <atleast last time I checked> Blue and Red) If you
combine the colours somehow i am sure you can do something
interesting but I have yet to try 2 colours.  Anyways squirt some
of this powder on the other end and pack it once again.  Now close
this end up with some tape (Any type will be fine.  Once again
experiment since it will change the type of explosion you get)

Here is what the finished product will look like







Plastic Cap
                                       Tape
3               33                   /

--An introduction to the Trace Utility of the Virtual Memory Operating System--
                                                                by Opticon

...now why an "introduction" to a utility which is available on every VMS?

        Simply because you can use it ONLY if you  have already system access..
So I assume that it won't be on every hacker's capability to do so.  Of course
any "intruder" can spend sometime on the System Manuals or use the on-line help
but getting the manuals is really difficult for most people and, on the other
hand, using help for a matter like that is not the best and most secure way to
do it.  Furthermore I have found A LOT of people not knowning even it's
excistence.

        Please allow me here to copy someone elses words;

"             HOW TO BUILD AND USE A MAGENTA BOX.

              Designed and Written by Street Fighter.

        First of all I named this the Magenta Box because all of the
        fags that made boxes, whose only purpose is adding a hold
        button to your phone, used all of the fucking colors.  I can
        afford a fucking piece of shit Radio Shack 2-line phone with
        hold.  A box's purpose is to fuck with the Telco., not to add
        a fucking hold button to your phone.  Anyway I will get on with
        this....                                                        "

Thank you Street Fighter ('thow i dont know u personally).

        Trace is an awesome utility which can really allow you to inflitrate
the system you are already in (with system account) and let you hack even more
cluster (...and not only) systems (ANY kind of system.  And that includes UNIX
or whatever you like, which are linked to your host using PSDN, ethernet,
TCPIP..)
        The only trouble you will probably come out with, is a "clever"
(...hehehe...) sysop or manager who has not "forget" the existence of "trace"
and who uses it too.  In that case an action of his/her's which looks like that
may "raise some eyebrows" ;

NETTRACE> SHOW TRACE
%NETTRACE-I-CONNECTING, connecting to trace collector...
Tracing on node MALATESTA on  4-AUG-1992 00:31:07
Collector            Collecting to                    Tracepoints
BAKUNIN$NETTRACE     DUA3:[USERS.BAKUNIN]X25.DAT      X25L3LINE.
%NETTRACE-I-SHOW_DONE, SHOW command complete - press RETURN to continue
NETTRACE>

Warning: If you are NOT an an-archist (?! HOW STRANGE! WHY AND HOW A NON
ANARCHIST READS THAT?) dont worry about the username and the nodename.  But if
you are (and that's what i'm expecting) and nothing comes to your mind when
reading those names, then you'd better GO AND READ SOME THEORY AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE!

(back to our subject)
He/she can even use trace for checking all the in-coming calls and see your
actions...And dont forget that there are simple ways (like finger, show
process /id=xxx or external programs like WATCH) for checking users processes.
If u dont know already how and what to do with it, it  wont be just bad luck
if someone notices you phuckin' up with things you shouldnt even know about.

There are three flags for Trace.

1) Trace /psi
   Allows you to monitor the flow of PACKETS -and thats IMPORTAND! I repeat:
   PACKETS,TO and OUT of your VAX's Packet Switching Interface.
2) Trace /router
   In that case you monitor the flow of data on your DEC router or X.25 router.
3) Trace /VOTS
   ...which invokes the vots trace utility.

   If you do not specify anything of the above u can run trace
   and enter commands at the NETTRACE> prompt.

   Now...A very good thing to start up with is this;

NETTRACE>start /live/data=ascii/width=132 tracepoint
(132 columns are REQUIRED if u want to see the flow of information without
loosing anything)

   Where "tracepoint" u must put one of these, depending on what you want
to monitor (taken directly from the on-line help utility);

    tracepoint

         You may specify one or more tracepoints, separated by commas.

            Tracepoints have the following formats:

                [node::]ETHERNET
                [node::]DDCMP.line-id
                [node::]NSP
                [node::]ROU_ETHERNET
                [node::]ROU_SYNC.circuit_name
                [node::]X25L2.dev-c-u
                [node::]X25L3LINE.dev-c-u
                [node::]X25L3CHANNEL.circuit_name
                [node::]X25GAP.channel
                X25GATEWAY.network.LC-n
                [node::]LLC2LINE.dev-c-u
                [node::]LLC2CHANNEL.channel

                TRANSPORT
                INTERNET
                MAC

         If you specify more than one tracepoint, they must all  be  on  the
         same node.

         Note that you need not specify the tracepoint name  in  full.   The
         second  part  of  the  tracepoint  name may be shortened or omitted
         altogether.  For example X25L3LINE.KMX will trace all KMX lines  at
         level 3.

         The default tracepoint is X25L2, which  traces  all  PSI  lines  at
         level 2.

That may already have been what most people would like to do.  I have rarely
used other tracepoints than the X25L3LINE one.
Continuing i give what help says about the tracepoints in specific.

      ETHERNET   DDCMP      NSP        ROU_ETHERNET          ROU_SYNC   X25L2
      X25L3LINE  X25L3CHANNEL          X25GAP     X25GATEWAY LLC2LINE
      LLC2CHANNEL           TRANSPORT  INTERNET   MAC

      ETHERNET


           This starts tracing the Ethernet line.  There are  no  options  for
           use with this tracepoint and only one channel can be traced.

      DDCMP


           DDCMP.line-id

           This starts tracing the synchronous lines on line line-id.  If  the
           line name is not specified, all currently defined lines are traced.

      NSP


           This starts tracing the NSP logical links.  There  are  no  options
           for use with this tracepoint.

      ROU_ETHERNET


           This starts the tracing of routing on the Ethernet circuit.   There
           are  no  options  for use with this tracepoint and only one channel
           can be traced.

      ROU_SYNC


           ROU_SYNC.circuit_name

           This starts the tracing of routing on the synchronous circuits.  If
           the  circuit  name is not specified, all currently defined circuits
           are traced.

      X25L2


           X25L2.dev-c-u

           This starts tracing at level 2 (Frame level) on line  dev-c-u.
           Both  level  2  and  level 3 headers will be captured (but see
           START /CAPTURE_SIZE).

      X25L3LINE


           X25L3LINE.dev-c-u

           This starts tracing at level 3 (Packet Level) on line dev-c-u.

           X25L3CHANNEL.circuit_name

           This starts tracing at level 3 (Packet  Level)  on  the  named
           virtual circuit.

        circuit_name


             The format of circuit_name depends  on  the  type  of  circuit
             being traced.

              .  For PVCs, circuit_name is the name of the PVC.

              .  For outgoing SVCs, circuit_name is the  NW:   device  unit
                 number (for example, NWA23).

              .  For  incoming  SVCs,   circuit_name   takes   the   format
                 dev-c-u_lcn_nn, where:

                 dev-c-u is the name of the line on which the call arrived,
                 lcn is the logical channel number of this virtual  circuit
                 (in hexadecimal),
                 nn is a 2-digit sequence number.

      X25GAP


           X25GAP.channel

           This starts tracing the Gateway Access Protocol (GAP).

           To trace on an Access  system  specify  channel  in  the  form
           HOSTnnn.

           To trace on a Multi-host machine specify channel in  the  form
           GATEWAYnnn.

           As with all tracepoints, the channel name can be shortened  or
           omitted altogether.

      X25GATEWAY


           X25GATEWAY.network.LC-n

           This starts tracing on an X.25 Gateway.  See  the  VAX  P.S.I.
           Problem Solving Guide for full details.

      LLC2LINE


           LLC2LINE.dev-c-u

           This starts tracing at the Medium Access Control (IEEE  802.3)
           level  for  the LLC 2 (IEEE 802.2) line dev-c-u.  Both the MAC
           and LLC 2 frame information will be captured.

      LLC2CHANNEL


           LLC2CHANNEL.channel

           This starts tracing at the  LLC2  (IEEE  802.2)  frame  level.
           Both  LLC  2  (IEEE  802.2)  frame  level  and L3 packet level
           information will be captured.

           TRANSPORT

           This starts tracing at the OSI Transport (ISO 8073)* level.

      INTERNET


           INTERNET

           This starts tracing at the OSI Internet (ISO 8473)* level.

*ISO Networks (just for an example and for informational purposes only)

                There are two parameters provided for use with an IS 8208
        PSDN. (IS 8208 is the International Standards Organization's
        definition of the CCITT X.25 recommendations.)
                The two parameters are interface and interupt timer.Interface
        specifies if the PSI acts like a DTE, a DCE or BOTH.  Interupt timer
        specifies how long an interupt may remain without confirmation.
        It is specified in seconds.  If it gets no answer within this time
        the circuit resets.

      MAC


           MAC

           This starts tracing at the OSI  Medium  Access  Control  (IEEE
           802.3) level.

If you  "start /live..." trace wont keep any records.Start /output=filename
will record everything in a data file which then you can read by invoking the
NETTRACE>analyze filename </data=ascii/width=132..and all that shit optionally>
What WE wont to do is start a tracepoint, log-out of the system, come after
sometime and analyze it.  What you can see in there includes usernames,
passwords, confidential information you would like to hack but never had an
idea where the users has them,things you wouldn't like your mom to hear etc
etc.  The limitations are not many.  If the system your in has a lot of users
logging in from several sources or using it for a gateway, then you gonna get
REALLY interresting stuff, even privileged accounts from other systems.

        More things you can do with trace include;

o ANALYZE (a datafile)
o ATTACH  (to a process)
o BACK    (retypes the last screen of ANALYZED -and only- data)
o CLEAR   (clears the screen.Also as ctrl-L)
o DEFINE  (define/key keyname string)
o DELETE  (delete/key keyname)
o EXIT    (...obvious...Also as ctrl-Z)
o NEXT    (next screen of analyzed data)
o REFRESH (refresh screen .Also as ctrl-W)
o SHOW    (many things...try "show key /all" , "show tracepoint" etc)
o SPAWN   (to a proccess)
o START
o STOP    (stop a tracepoint ie NETTRACE>stop bakunin$nettrace)

These are the default keys;

Sigh! And this the end!

Flames to:
o All the lamers worldwide who call themselves blue boxers only because
their dad is rich enough to buy them a phucking sound card and claim that
they dont make a Digital to Analog converter because "the quality is not as
good"
o To all the "anarchists" who dont seem to KNOW (they never read books) that
anarchy is AGAINST racesism, the powerfull and the rich, the laws, the states
and generally against ANY kind of exploitation.
o And a last flame to digital underground dudes who "would like to find some
time and write a book with their adventures" to increase their popularity and
make some money.

 Summer Thrashing Volume 1
 ______________________________

 Author : Silicon Phreaker

 ______________________________

 Ok. This took me a long time to write because of the fact that I have tried
 everything in this file, and that I got into a fight (relating to a stunt
 described below) and got my wrist metal plated & screwed down. So take all
 this as a sequel to my other files. Remember: If you get arrested, decked,
 buttfucked in jail, I'm not responsible for anything. I wasn't there when
 you did it. So, on let's carry on with the file, and remember : You only
 live once, and we're not coming back ! PARTY !!!!

 ______________________________

 Party Kick Start
 ______________________________

 Ok... You arrived... If the party is Semi-Formal, you're probably dressed
 up like a pogo... Tie, Vests and shit like that... And mostly everybody looks
 like you... Time to fix that up a bit... You may shoot people off with your
 paintgun, which would get you into trouble... If it's an outside party, get
 a few friends to make a Drive-By shooting, with paintguns.

 Spike the punch with the vodka... Put it in a Plastic Bad, drop the bag in
 the punch bowl, and pierce it with a fork... The vodka will slowly disolve
 in the punch, makin' it stronger as it get sipped away.

 The party has already started to be more liveable ? Cool... Peoples are
 drunk like shit ? Lot Cooler that way... They puke ? MARVELOUS!! Here comes
 the time for the use of the firecrackers... Locate a big green spill of
 puke, jam a firecracker in it, light it off and run...

 Move on to the most occupied place of the house... The bathroom... Steal
 some ketchup envelopes, and fold them in two, place them carefully under the
 toilet lid... As soon as someone sits on it to have a dump, he'll get
 ketchup splashing in his pants.

 Put some mineral water on the seats... Will show up like the dude has pissed
 in his pants...

 Fill a dead rat with black powder, put a firecracker in his mouth, put it
 on the buffet table, and light it... One "Rat Flambe" on the way...

 Ok... Now you're pissed... Fine... Get a camera and hide it somewhere in
 the bedroom, from where you can see the bed pretty good. I bet you can
 see what I want you to do right ?

 Next time that two dweebs will want to fuck in the room, you will be able
 to look at it on tape afterwhile. You might want to send a tape to the
 PO's parent. For them to see what their bedroom was used for.

 Fire Up the swimming pool... Use some gas, drop it very carefully in the
 pool and light it up... Guaranteed pleasure... Make sure that someone is
 in the pool at the moment you do it...

 Hang the cat, dog or whatever animals which will be found inside the house.

 Steal the stereo system...

 Spill ketchup off everybody that's smaller then you...

 The party should be a total waste by now... So go to the owner and thank him
 for the radical night you had... Say you hope he invites you to his next
 party... And then, paintball him...

 ______________________________

 Outside Tricks
 ______________________________

 Now that you can thrash any party, let's move on to heavier shit. Your beloved
 neighborhood. Or someone else's ...

 - Car Bashing

 You want to get at someone ? Does he have a car ? Yes ? GOOD ! What better
 way to let him know you hate him then bash his car ? Raping his girl is cool
 too but a bit out of it. So lets stick to killing the car.

 Use a jack and lift the car off ground. Put cement block underneath it to
 hold it, and take the bolt off his tire, then steal them. You can even make
 some spending money by selling them if they're magnesium wheel. (BTW : Looking
 for (4) Dodge Caravan WHITE mag. Paying 400$ CDN for them.)

 Take a screwdriver and make a tiny hole in his gas tank, then, put a piece of
 Silly-Putty in the hole. Gas will eat it's way through the putty and he'll
 choke up on the highway.

 Ram a broomstick up the exhaust pipe. If it jams, use a hammer.

 Get inside the car, and open the hood. Now the real fun begins.

 You can steal the battery, or can do some cool stuff as :

 - Invert the flasher's so that Left = Right and Right = Left. Guaranteed
   accident.
 - Connect the High Intensity Beams to the horn. Nice Effects on a country
   road.
 - Shortcut the battery, and GET THE HELL OUTTA' THERE.
 - Put chewing gum in the fuel injectors.
 - Put some ethylic alcohol in the radiator.
 - Put some indian ink in the windshield washer tank.
 - Connect wipers to horn.
 - Disconnect wipers, and bypass the windshield washer pump's wire to be on
   permanently.
 - Mix sparkplugs wire within each other. On Some car, it'll completely de-
   phase it.

 Inside the car you can pull some nice tricks too.

 - Replace the dome light with a flashing light ($1.99 / RadioShack) and
   arrange it so it's always on. Real pain in the butt.
 - Arrange the radio so the volume is ALWAYS to the max level. And screw the
   bass so it's only going to pour tweeters in his poor motherfucking ears.
 - Pour some REALLY stinking substance in the A/C and Heater outputs.
   hopefully he'll be splashed with it when he turns it on, and it's gonna
   smell for ages in his car.
 - Smoke a bud in his car, and hide some marijuana in the glove compartment.
   When he'll get arrested for his car plate, he's in deep trouble.

 ____________________________________________________________________________

 Ok, well. That is about it for this time. I wrote this for the deadline, and
 it's the best that I could think of. Anyway. It's better then some of my
 old article, which was a tad bit outdated. Have fun, party, smoke pot and
 don't get caught.

      Fireworks:
           The largest firework ever produced was Universe I exploded for the
      Lake Toya Festival, Hokkaido, Japan on August 28, 1983.  The 928-lb shell
      was 42.5 inches in diameter and burst to a diameter of 2,830 ft, with a
      5-color display.


      Worst Accidents & Disasters In The World:
           Fireworks: More than 800 people died at Dauphine's wedding, Seine,
      Paris, May 16, 1770.


      Greatest Explosion:
           The greatest explosion (possibly since Santorini in the Aegean Sea
      c. 1470 BC) occurred c. 10:00 a.m. (local time), or 3:00 am G.M.T., on
      August 27, 1883 with an eruption of Krakatoa, an island (then 18 sq mi)
      in the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java, in Indonesia.  A total of
      163 villages were wiped out, and 36,380 people killed by the wave it
      caused.  Rocks were thrown 34 miles high, and dust fell 10 days later at
      a distance of 3,313 miles.  The explosion was recorded 4 hours later on
      the island of Rodrigues, 2,968 miles away, as "the roar of heavy guns"
      and was heard over 1/13th part of the surface of the globe.  This
      explosion has been estimated to have had about 26 times the power of the
      greatest H-bomb test detonation, but was still only a fifth of the size
      of the Santorini cataclysm.


      Largest "Conventional" Explosion:
          The largest use of conventional explosive was for the demolition of
      the fortifications and U-Boat pens at Heligoland on April 18, 1947.  A
      net charge of 4,253 tons was detonated by Commissioned Gunner E.C.
      Jellis of the Royal Navy team headed by Lt F.T. Woosnam aboard HMS Lasso
      lying 9 miles out to sea.

         In order to write a text file that will deal with pyrotechnics, it is
      first necessary to make distinctions between certain words.  While a
      firework can be considered an explosive, in this file we will separate
      the two words.  When the term explosive is used, it is referring to any
      substance which can decompose suddenly and produce large amounts of
      gaseous products and thermal energy (heat).  While in retrospect, a
      firework will be known as any device containing explosives and other
      combustible material that, when ignited, produce light or loud noise.
      When the term incendiary is used it is referring to both explosives and
      fireworks.
         To produce an incendiary device, it is necessary to take proper
      precautions.  The incendiary will not be much fun if you lose your
      limbs preparing it.  Therefore, I am including a vast safety section.  Do
      not skip this section, as it could very well save your life.
         This text file has been created by Genghis Khan.  However, Fireball
      has given much information, and credit should be given equally to both
      parties.  Fireball will soon be in the underground...
         On another note, this text file is the result of knowledge obtained
      from periodicals, books, and other reference material.  There is a
      bibliography at the end.  The material that is following is not
      plagiarized.  All credit is given in full at the conclusion of this file.

                                     Safety
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

           The most important part of pyrotechnics and explosives is safety.
      The safety  procedures for all explosives are nothing more than common
      sense and reasoning.   Yes, smokeless powder is stable, but if you put it
      in the oven, it will explode.   That may  sound  stupid,  but a 14-year-
      old in Ohio did it and killed himself.   Plastique is a very stable
      explosive compound,  but  it  needs  to  be  softened before use.  Some
      guy in New Jersey softened  his  plastique  with  a hammer, and he is no
      more.   TNT can be burned and it will not explode (most of the time)
      where gunpowder will ignite with the smallest spark.  Moral: Each
      explosive has it's own characteristics.  Make sure that you know of all
      the properties before the incendiary is produced.  Read the following and
      take it into consideration.
         Explosives are intended to cause damage  to something.   Whether it be
      in a war zone, destroying  bridges,  and enemy  fortifications,  or in
      common everyday use, in mining, ditch digging, and more.  Remember this
      when you are making it.  If the explosive can destroy a bridge or enemy
      fortifications, you better believe it will destroy you.
         Always be paranoid.   Being  paranoid is  only going to save you.  If
      you think everything over  and watch  your back, everything will be fine.
      However, if you  decide that  no one  cares  about what you are doing,
      and that you know it all,  you  will  either  hurt  yourself or someone
      else, or get busted.
         Keep away all sources of ignition.   This means no cigarettes, no
      electricity, or other things that may be capable of igniting a fuse or
      mixture.  By saying no electricity,  I  am talking about stray voltage or
      static electricity.  That doesn't mean shut off your power.  Generally,
      electricity is not a problem... so don't worry about it too much.
         Use common sense.  It is a  proven fact  that men  who are alert, who
      think out a situation, and who take correct precautions have fewer
      accidents than the careless  and  indifferent.  It  is important  that
      work be planned and that instructions be  followed to  the letter; all
      work should be done in a neat and orderly manner.   In the manufacture of
      incendiaries, equipment must be kept clean and such energy concentrations
      as sparks, friction, impact, hot objects, flame, chemical reactions, and
      excessive pressure should be avoided.  Don't be erratic.  Do not use or
      create explosives or pyrotechnics while drunk, falling asleep,  angry,
      or any  other strange mood that may hinder your ability to think.
         Try to make all  explosives outside in a secluded area.  Never, I
      repeat, NEVER try  to  make  explosives  in  your  house, unless it is
      somewhere where  no one  goes,  or  no  ones  cares  about.  Sometimes a
      garage may work well, but in the case that something would go off, your
      oxygen could be depleted quickly depending on what you are making.  Try
      to find a place on your property, or in a wooded area that is near a
      residential area (in case of an emergency) but out of the sight of nosy
      neighbors, pigs,  and other curious people.  If you are making explosives
      in a wooded area, don't be an idiot and burn the forest down.
         Always have an idea how you will put something out if it happens to go
      off.  Water is not always the best fire extinguisher.  On a hot explosion
      or  fire, the water will vaporize leaving oxygen and hydrogen, which will
      only add to the fire's wrath.   Wet sand or a fire blanket will work, but
      if possible, use a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher.
         Know first aid.  If something goes off in your hands, be prepared to
      treat it quickly.   You can  buy  burn  creams  and  other  medical
      supplies for treating  burns  and  abrasions.   Use  extra  care when
      packing an explosive with shrapnel.
         Locate a unique  and  secure  place  for  storing  chemicals  and
      explosives.  You will want to choose a place close  enough  for you to
      watch, but not close enough, or important enough of  place,  to  be  a
      hazard.  Take extra precaution in securing the area so that if someone
      was around they could not tamper with anything.
         Do not store blasting caps,  electrical  caps,  detonators, or primers
      in the same containers with any other form of high or low explosives.  If
      one thing goes off, you will be looking at a chain-reaction.
         Do not store fuses or fuse lighters  in a  wet or  damp place, or near
      the  storage  of  flammables  such  as  oil,  gasoline,  cleaning
      solvents  or  paints.   Fuses should also be kept away from radiators,
      steam pipes,  stoves,  or any  other source  of heat, because the very
      nature of  non-electrical fuses  is such that  any one of these things
      could start a large fire.
         Metals should  be kept absolutely  away from  explosives, meaning that
      metal tools should not  be stored  in  the  same  container  with
      explosives.  These metals will kill if the explosives would go off.
         Spontaneous combustion is a  real problem when storing explosives.
      For this reason, do not allow leaves, grasses, brush, or any debris to
      collect or accumulate around the explosives storage area.
         Certain types  of  explosives require  certain  types  of  storage,
      including temperature regulation and other controls.  Be sure that you
      understand all aspects  of the  compound's  nature before  handling or
      storing it.

                         Characteristics of Explosives
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

         Most explosives are nitrogen compounds which may be set off by:
                              1. ignition;
                              2. slight shock; and
                              3: severe shock.

         Explosives are either solid or liquid, either mixtures or single
      compounds, and act by explosive chemical reaction, liberating at high
      speed, heat and gas, which causes tremendous pressure.  According to
      speed of reaction they are classed as:
                 1. Low explosives, Propellant explosives or Propellants
                      (as gunpowder, flash powder, and smokeless powders)
                 2. High explosives or Disruptives
                      (as dynamite, amatol, picric acid, tetryl, and TNT).
         Permissible or Permitted explosives are those passed by public
      authority for use under prescribed conditions, especially those permitted
      for blasting in mines (sometimes called safety explosives).

                      The chief classes of explosives are:

      (1) Mixtures of combustible but nonexplosive material with an oxidizing
          agent, especially a nitrate, a chlorate, or a perchlorate (ordinary
          gunpowder, blasting powder, etc.).
      (2) Organic nitrates, as nitroglycerine or guncotton; also, mixtures
          containing these, as dynamite.  The smokeless powders contain
          cellulose nitrate as the sole or chief ingredient.
      (3) Nitro substitution products or mixtures containing these, as TNT and
          lyddite.
      (4) Fulminating powders, as mercury fulminate and lead azide, used as
          detonators.

      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

      Low Explosives - Low explosives generally fit into class one or two of
      the above table.  They are commonly used as propellants in fireworks
      (such as bottle rockets).  If detonated in the air it will simply burn or
      deflagrate.  In order for any low explosive to have the ability to
      produce a blast wave (or shock wave in water) it is necessary to contain
      the explosive.  This containment can be as simple as a cardboard
      container (such as firecrackers), to metal pipes (as pipe bombs).  The
      stronger the container which holds the explosive, the larger the blast
      wave should be.  In addition, say for instance, you create a pipe bomb
      with one quarter of the pipe filled with gunpowder.  It will take a short
      period of time before this pipe fills with enough gas for it to explode.
      Generally low explosives are "fun" to play with, but, if used correctly,
      can be as powerful as some high explosives.

      =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

      High Explosives - High explosives fit into categories 2, 3, and 4 in the
      above table.  Some high explosives can be detonated with a fuse, but it
      is more reliable to use a blasting cap.  A blasting cap is simply a small
      explosive that is detonated to start the larger explosive on it's way.
      These generally contain mercury fulminate.
         If high explosives are to be used in a container, such as a pipe, use
      extreme caution.  The explosion will be tremendous.  Overall, if high
      explosives are to be used, make them in small quantities.  Follow
      directions EXACTLY when making high explosives, and whatever you do, do
      not take short cuts.  Even if you don't get hurt from an explosive, many
      are powerful enough to seriously hurt your hearing.

         Black Powder aka Gunpowder - Low Explosive - Deflagrating - Class I
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

         One of the oldest pyrotechnic compositions, black powder, serves as
      both the propellant and explosive charge in modern firework shells.  The
      Chinese developed black powder (the original gunpowder) more than 1,000
      years ago for use in crude missiles and firecrackers.  Awareness of black
      powdered traveled west during the Middle Ages.  The English monk Roger
      Bacon disclosed a formula for the explosive mixture in 1242 as part of
      his defense against accusations of witchcraft.  He considered it such a
      dangerous material that he wrote about it in code.  As the formula became
      more widely known, black powder revolutionized quarrying and
      construction.  Weapons such as muskets and cannons, developed during the
      14th century, exploited black powder as a propellant.
         The basic formula for black powder has persisted essentially unchanged
      throughout the centuries: an intimate blend of potassium nitrate (commonly
      known as saltpeter), charcoal and sulfur in a 75:13:12 ratio by WEIGHT.
      It may in fact be the only chemical product that is produced today using
      the same ingredients, the same proportions and the same manufacturing
      process as were used in the time of Columbus.  This constancy reflects
      the fact that black powder is a nearly ideal pyrotechnic substance.  It
      consists of abundant, inexpensive chemicals that are relatively nontoxic
      and environmentally safe.  The mixture is so stable that it can be stored
      for decades without deteriorating, if kept dry.  Black powder is easily
      ignited by means of a moderate jolt of energy, such as a spark or a small
      burning fuse.
         The ideal black powder burns very quickly. You may find that black
      powder in the 75:13:12 ratio may burn rather slowly.  If this is the
      case, simply add more sulfur.  Record the amounts of sulfur you put in,
      and continue to experiment with different amounts of sulfur until you
      have created your own perfect blend.  The sulfur burns very hot and acts
      as sort of a catalyst.  Because of it's extreme high temperature it makes
      the rest of the mixture burn much faster.
         While black powder is nice and dandy, it is more a firework.  In order
      for it to have "explosive" power it must be in a container.  Under
      pressure black powder can be very destructive.  If put into a pipe and
      sealed it will explode with tremendous force.  A CO2 cartridge works fine
      as well.
              The equation for black powder is:

                          2KNO  + 3C + S -> K S + 3CO  + N
                              3              2       2    2

                           202  + 36 + 32 = 270

                202/270 = 75% KNO3;   36/270 = 13% C;   32/270 = 12% S



         Black powder can be made by simply adding the potassium nitrate,
      sulfur, and charcoal together, or by the process described below.  Either
      works equally well.


                            Improvised Black Powder

         Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner.  It may
                       be used as blasting or gun powder


                               Material Required:

         Nitroglycerine - Dynamite - High Explosive - Detonating - Class 2
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD


         Nitroglycerin (also nitroglycerine) is made by treating glycerol
      (glycerin) with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids.  It is a dense,
      oily liquid that is extremely sensitive to shock.  The slightest jarring
      may be sufficient to cause it to decompose with enormous force.
         Dynamite is a solid mixture made by absorbing nitroglycerin in wood
      flour mixed with sodium nitrate.  The dynamite is usually encased in
      cardboard cylinders to form "sticks." In this way the hazardous property
      of nitroglycerin is lessened, while its usefulness is retained.
               The chemical equation for making nitroglycerin is:

                     C H (OH)  + 3HNO  -> C H (NO )  + 3H O
                      3 5    3       3     3 5   3 3     2

         At this point a measure of sulfuric acid is added which absorbs the
      water and makes the reaction go much quicker.  This is more fully
      explained in the section about sulfuric acid.

       Nitroglycerine has a specific gravity at 15 degrees Celsius of 1.5931.

         Nitroglycerine is such an effective explosive because of the positive
      oxygen balance during detonation.  This means that more than enough
      oxygen molecules are available to oxidize the carbon and hydrogen while
      the nitrogen is being liberated.  Also because of the high nitrogen
      concentration. (18.5%)

          One pound of nitroglycerine produces 156.7 cubic feet of gas.
                  The blast wave moves at 7700 meters/second.

         Nitroglycerine is extremely sensitive to shock and rapid heating; it
      begins to decompose between 50-60 degrees Celsius, becomes volatile at
      120 degrees C and explodes at 218 degrees Celsius.  A serious problem in
      the use of nitroglycerine as an explosive is its relatively high freezing
      temperature (13.2 degrees Celsius, 56 degrees F)
         A major problem with the manufacture of nitroglycerine is that the
      nitration produces a good deal of heat, and if the mixture is not kept
      cool, the temperature of the nitroglycerine could rise to extreme
      instability.  Nitroglycerine, to be somewhat safe, should not go above 10
      degrees C or 50 degrees F.
         Nitroglycerine is a VERY TREACHEROUS explosive.  I highly recommend
      against making it.  If you do decide to make it you do not value your
      life very much.  If you make it make it in SMALL AMOUNTS!  I recommend a
      blast shield of some sort.  Be cautious on what you use.  If the
      nitroglycerine is powerful enough it will make the blast shield into a
      sort of shrapnel.

         Fill the bowl with ice and COLD water.  Put the beaker in the water.
      Make sure the beaker doesn't float around.  You may have to hold the
      beaker.  Put the thermometer in the ice water and read the temperature.
      Make sure it is well under 25 degrees Celsius.  If it is not, then
      continue to add more ice until it is between 10-25 degrees.  Wipe off the
      thermometer.

                      ALL PROPORTIONS ARE FOR 100% PURITY

      1. Put 3 parts Sulfuric Acid in beaker.
      2. Add 1 part Nitric Acid.
      3. With the pipette drop 1 drop of glycerin into the beaker.
         (ADD ONLY 1 DROP! See 3a below)
      4. GENTLY stir the solution with the glass rod.
      5. While stirring, insert the thermometer in the solution.  Read the
         temperature.  If the temperature is 50 degrees or more than the
         nitroglycerine is unstable and could detonate at any time.  If the
         temperature is 40 degrees and is starting to rise, dump the solution
         in the water.  Watch the temperature closely and if it gets to 30-35
         degrees Celsius start adding ice.
      6. Continue to stir for about 2 minutes or until you feel the glycerin
         has been exposed to most of the nitric acid.  The longer you wait the
         better.  If you don't give it enough time, and continue to add
         glycerin the mixture will become volatile and could detonate at any
         moment.
      7. After you feel the first drop has had enough time, add another.  Keep
         your eye on the temperature and be ready to dump the solution if
         temperatures become hazardous.
      8. Once you have made enough nitroglycerine to please you, use it soon.
         DO NOT STORE IT!  If you want to store it for a short period of time,
         then add sodium nitrate to it.  About 2 parts sodium nitrate to 1 part
         nitroglycerine.  Under no means should you store the finished
         nitroglycerine in your house, or anywhere for that matter.  If
         circumstances were to occur which would inform the police or bomb
         squad that you have nitroglycerine in your house, the nitroglycerine
         could be detonated inside your house, along with an area wide
         evacuation.  Don't fuck up your life...

         Nitroglycerin is not something to play with.  Many other explosives
      can be made that are more stable and can be just as exciting.  You may
      not feel cautious now, but wait till you are the one who has to stir.

      Nitrocellulose/Smokeless Powder - Low Explosive - Deflagrating - Class I
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

         Smokeless powder, or Nitrocellulose, is made by treating cellulose
      with nitric and sulfuric acids.  It differs from Nitrocellulose plastics
      in that the cellulose is more thoroughly nitrated.  It is a low explosive
      and must be confined when detonated.
         When smokeless powder burns, the colorless products, carbon dioxide,
      carbon monoxide, water vapor, and nitrogen, are formed.  Hence the name
      "smokeless" powder.
         I have never made nitrocellulose.  However, the reaction should be
      quite similar to that of nitroglycerin.  The sulfuric acid, H2SO4,  is
      used to absorb the water vapor formed, which would dilute the reactants
      and slow the reaction.  The nitric acid, HNO3, nitrates the cellulose,
      (C6H10O5)n.
         So if you are to try to make smokeless powder, read the section on
      nitroglycerin and instead of using glycerin, use cellulose.

             Shell Fillers - Detonators - High Explosives - Class 4
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

          The explosive used inside an artillery shell must be able to stand
      the shock of the propellant which starts it on its course.  It must also
      be capable of exploding with great force when it reaches its target.
      Explosives of this type, requiring severe shock to set them off, are
      called shell-fillers.  Trinitrotoluene (try-ny-troh-tol-you-een), usually
      abbreviated TNT, is the most commonly used shell filler for military
      purposes.  Picric acid is also used as a shell filler.
          Detonators are extremely sensitive explosives which are set off by
      shock and which decompose with almost incredible rapidity.  They are used
      in small amounts in cartridges and shells to start the main explosion.
      Mercury fulminate is a well-known detonator.  It is a very treacherous
      explosive that may be set off by heat, friction, or shock.  Lead azide is
      a detonator that is used in car airbags.  Upon impact, this detonator
      decomposes rapidly and gives off an immense amount of gas.

                               Thermite - Class I
      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

          A mixture of coarsely powdered aluminum and iron oxide will react if
      it is raised to a high enough temperature to start the chemical change.
      A tremendous amount of heat is set free when the reaction occurs.  Such a
      reaction between aluminum and the oxide of a less active metal is called
      the Thermite Reaction.
          390 kilocalories of heat are set free during the formation of one
      mole of aluminum oxide.  The heat of formation of ferric oxide is 191
      kilocalories.  When the Thermite reaction occurs, an amount of heat equal
      to the difference between these values is set free for each mole of
      aluminum oxide formed.
                                 The equation is:

                  2 Al + Fe O  -> Al O  + 2Fe + 199 Kilocalories
                           2 3      2 3

          The liberation of such a large amount of heat so suddenly produces a
      very high temperature.  The temperature of the Thermite reaction is
      estimated at 3500 degrees C.  Reactions of this type are sometimes called
      aluminothermy or aluminothermics.

         Nitric Acid - HNO3
         Molecular Weight - 63.01
         Density - 1.5027
         Melting Point - -42 degrees Celsius
         Boiling Point -  83 degrees Celsius
         Solubility, in grams per 100 cc

                                                  alcohol; soluble in ether


          Pure HNO3 is a colorless liquid, about 1.5 times as dense as water.
      It fumes in moist air and boils at 83 degrees Celsius.  The 100% HNO3 is
      unstable, and for that reason, the concentrated nitric acid of commerce
      is a 68% solution (42 degrees Baume') of HNO3 in water.  Such a solution
      boils at 120 degrees Celsius.  A more dilute solution boils at a lower
      temperature, losing water and becoming more concentrated.

                        Chemical Properties of Nitric Acid

      1. Stability.  Nitric acid is not very stable.  When boiled, or even when
         exposed to sunlight, it decomposes to some extent.  Water and nitrogen
         dioxide, NO2, are two products of its decomposition.  The deep yellow
         color of laboratory bottles of nitric acid is caused by small amounts
         of dissolved nitrogen dioxide which are formed when the acid is
         exposed to light.  In water solution the acid is more stable.  Fuming
         red nitric acid, a very corrosive liquid, has a red color due to
         considerable amounts of dissolved nitrogen dioxide.  It fumes in moist
         air and burns the skin painfully.

      2. Acid properties.  When dilute, nitric acid has the usual properties of
         acids.  It reacts with metals and the oxides of metals.  It reacts
         with hydroxides, forming salts known as nitrates.
            Nitric acid stains the skin yellow, forming xanthoproteic (zan-
         thoh-proh-tee-ick) acid.  It produces the same effect with any
         protein, and for that reason is used as a test for proteins.  A drop
         of nitric acid added to a slice of hard-boiled egg white will show the
         test perfectly.  The color deepens to a bright-orange when ammonia-
         water solution is added.
            Nitric acid may be prepared in the laboratory by the action of
         sulfuric acid on sodium nitrate.

      DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

         Sulfuric Acid - H2SO4
         Molecular Weight - 98.08
         Density - 1.841
         Melting Point - 10.36 degrees Celsuis
         Boiling Point - 338 degrees Celsius

          Infinity;           Infinity            Decomposes in Alcohol
          Evolves heat


          Concentrated sulfuric acid is a dense, oily liquid which is sometimes
      called oil of vitriol.  The concentrated acid, which contains about 2%
      water, has a specific gravity of about 1.84 and a boiling point of 338
      degrees Celsuis.  Pure sulfuric acid is colorless, but commercial acid
      may have a yellow color, or it may be brown or almost black because of
      the presence of impurities, especially organic matter.
          When sulfuric acid is added to water (you must never add water to
      sulfuric acid) a great deal of heat is evolved because of the formation
      of the hydrates H2SO4 . H2O and H2SO4 . 2H2O.

                      Sulfuric Acid's dehydrating properties

      The strong affinity of sulfuric acid for water makes it an excellent
      dehydrating agent.  Gases may be dried by bubbling them through
      concentrated sulfuric acid.  Lumps of pumice stone soaked in sulfuric
      acid may be used in the lower part of a desiccator.  In fact, sulfuric
      acid is such an active dehydrating agent that it will take hydrogen and
      oxygen, in the proportion needed to form water, from such substances as
      sugar, C12H22O11, or cellulose, (C6H10O5)n, leaving the carbon
      uncombined.

              C12H22O11 + 11 H2SO4 -> 12 C + 11 H2SO4 . H2O

      In the same manner, concentrated sulfuric acid chars wood, paper, cotton,
      starch, and other organic compounds.
         In making some products commercially, water is formed as a by-
      product.  Let us illustrate this with the reaction for making
      nitroglycerine, C3H5(NO3)3

                    C3H5(OH3) + 3 HNO3 -> C3H5(NO3)3 + 3 H2O

         In the manufacture of this explosive, concentrated nitric acid is
      used.  Since the nitric acid is reacting with a non-electrolyte, the
      reaction is slow.  To prevent dilution of the acid, which cause the
      reaction to proceed more slowly, sulfuric acid is always mixed with the
      nitric acid.  The sulfuric acid acts as a dehydrating agent.  It absorbs
      the water as fast as it is formed and greatly speeds the rate of the
      reaction.  This same principle takes place in nitrocellulose or smokeless
      powder.
         Dilute sulfuric acid may be obtained from some car batteries.  Due to
      sulfuric acids high boiling point, it can be boiled to concentration
      without the use of a retort or other glassware.  The boiling point will
      continue to drop the more dilute the acid is, until reaching 0% sulfuric
      acid, 100 degrees Celsuis, and retrospectively, 640.4 degrees F (338
      degrees C) with 100% purity.

         The information I have just gave you is useless without a source to

         Columbus, Ohio 43223

         Specializes in high quality reagent grade chemicals.  Leading producer
         of Perchlorate chemicals in the country.  GFS has a reputation for the
         quality of their goods, but they are quite expensive.  Generally, for
         the pyrotechnic device, you do not need reagent quality chemicals.
         However, GFS sells some of those...hard to find chemicals like
         Cyanuric Acid, C3H3N3O3, (2,4,6-Trihydroxy-1,3,5-triazine), a
         convenient lab source for Hydrogen Cyanide gas, HCN.

         Look around in your library for chemical supply houses.  Ones that pop
      into my head are Fisher Scientific, Nasco, and a load of others.  Compare
      prices.  And buy from the cheapest.
         Perhaps the best source for chemicals is from a local company.  Look
      in your business white pages under chemicals and see if there is anything
      there.  Then look in the yellow pages for chemicals.  In big cities there
      are generally a few supply houses.
         From here on, I am going to tell a story of Fireball and my adventures
      with Pyrotechnica.  I have a friend who has a Masters degree in Biology
      and a Bachelors degree in Chemistry.  If you have any friends who are
      scientists, ask them where to get chemicals.  Tell them you are doing a
      science experiment or that you are in a band or have been asked by a band
      to do stage effects.  My friend directed me to a local chemical supply
      company, that he said would have all the chemicals I would need.  I was
      really happy.  So I called up this place, and told them a few chemicals
      that I needed.  The man replied that he really didn't have any chemicals,
      and that mainly he sells pH indicators and other materials for industrial
      uses.  Well, I knew that my friend wouldn't lie to me, so I told Fireball
      and we went down to the place.  The signs were weathered, and it was
      someplace you wouldn't leave you door unlocked.  There was a computer
      printout above the door that said the company's name.  We finally found
      our way to it, and it was one room, about 20' by 50' and junked up
      immensely.  We almost turned around and left.  But we decided to check it
      out anyways.
         Once inside we told the old man that we needed chemicals and he
      immediately remembered the phone call and said that he didn't have any
      chemicals.  Yeah right.  I think it was more like he didn't think he had
      many chemicals, but he had to have AT LEAST 150 different chemicals and a
      bunch of assorted glassware and other products.  There were 2.5kg bottles
      of potassium nitrate, KNO3, which he said he didn't have.  Powdered zinc,
      about 300 mesh, which we bought for $12.00.  Powdered iron, which we
      bought for $1.50.  Potassium nitrate, technical grade, 95%, $1.50 a
      pound.  We bought all he had...2 lbs.  Potassium Permanganate, KMnO4, we
      bought a little bit, but it was expensive.  We also bought 500g of
      Lampblack carbon (charcoal).  500 g of it is a lot!  And it was only
      $1.50.  We also purchased a flask, a beaker, a graduated cylinder, some
      filter paper, an alcohol burner, and some other things I can't remember.
      We also got our first bottle of nitric acid there, 42 degrees Baume, 68%
      concentration.  Moral: Don't judge a book by it's cover.

         I wrote this text file in PFS: Professional Write.  I only have 640k
      memory installed, and this is about as long as I can make one text file.
      So, look for my future text files.  I'll be going straight from this one
      to a new one, with a complete analysis of Ammonia Tri-iodide, NH3NI3,
      physical constants of many pyrotechnics substances, a bit about the BATF,
      and other law enforcement agencies, purification of KNO3, formulae for
      colors, Mercuric Fulminate, and much, much more.

                     Volume Two, Issue Seven, File 8 of 19

                 The Hacker's Code Of Ethics... By The DarkMan

As one of the people on an Alliance once said, " We (the hackers) may
be considered unethical to some people, but as a small and growing
community, we have our own code of ethics." When he pointed this out,
which I may say was greeted with much enthusiasm on the Alliance, I
got the idea of releasing this file on exactly that: The Hacker's Code
Of Ethics.

We live in the age of computers. Everything is controlled by massive
mainframes; Our water distribution system, rail-road control, airline
control, electricity control, telephone companies, etc, etc, etc...
Imagine the fun someone can have in one of those systems!!! Just the
fact of getting in them can sometimes be a major accomplishment. But
my point is, what people do once they are in...

The one thing I hate, is the way some self-appointed hackers find
there way into a system, and ruin the name of the rest of us by
destroying everything they can find. Now that is pathetic. First of
all, as I said, it ruins the name of the rest of us. The word "Hacker"
has forever been tarnished because of those people. All you have to
do is mention "Hacker!" to the computer manager of a company, and
he'll keel over in an epileptic fit! Let me tell you what my fun is.
This idea I got from my good friend Matrix, in the 207 NPA. What I do,
is get in the system first of all... That's when the fun starts... I
take care of all the security features, hiding my passage, and then
leave the SysAdmin a little message, something like this:

" Dear System Administrator. I find that the security of your system
  is somewhat neglected, which could bring a serious downfall of your
  data should one of my more destructive "brothers" find there way
  here. You should change or emphasize the importance of security in
  your office. I will call back in exactly one week to check out the
  changes.


                                 Signed, The Happy Hacker  :) "

I've pulled this trick off a few times, and it worked... But of course,
by then, I had alreay created a few superuser accounts, so I had no
trouble getting back in... I would just like to see the face ONCE of a
system administrator that reads that message!!!

My next point, is the attitude some hackers have towards each other.
We are of a dying race. There are not many of us left that actually
know what we are doing and most importantly why we do what we do.
The importance of sticking together and protecting one another should
not even be brought up. We should know it. But no... There will always
be some asshole considering himself a hacker that will pull another
hacker's CN/A... The one thing a hacker cherishes beyond all is his
need for privacy... If one of us does not what to be hassled, bothered
or otherwise harassed, it is his own right! We do not have the right
nor is it to our advantage to betray that right. It will only
aggravate that person, and make him aggressive towards the rest of
us...

Also, some hackers have this massive ego problem... I must name one
here, for that problem, and he is Corporal Punishment... I have had
numerous run-ins with this guy. He seems to think he is a God,
constantly running everyone into the ground. He even went as far as
saying "PHRACK sucks!" But he isn't the only one with that problem...
Some feel that if they put others down, they will elevate to a higher
level. Sorry to burst you bubble guys, but your only viewed as
massive ego-maniacs that deserve nothing less than being run down
yourselves...

One other thing some "hackers" have loads of fun with, is pulling
other hackers CBI Information, and posting it public. Now that is one
of the most pathetic attempts at getting even I have ever seen. And
what's worse, if the hacker in question is a minor, then the person
wanting to pull the CBI will try and get the PARENTS credit info! The
parents, who have absolutly nothing to do with this, will either: Turn
in they're own child ( which has happened in many cases ), take away
the entire computer set-up, or try a kamikaze attack on the whole
computer underground ( if they're really frustrated ).

The last thing I will mention, will be hackers turning in other hackers
to federal crime agencies, or to the PhoneCorp security offices, or
any other type of company that deals with computer related phraud.
This activity, refered to as Narcing, is getting to be to popular for
a hackers good... You may be saying, " Come on, no hacker in they're
right mind would turn another on in ". And your right... It's once again
those self proclaimed hackers, or the ones who think they are who will
do this to get "Even"... Listen to this...

Those who are familiar with the current events in our community will
have heard of this little story. This 15 year old "hacker" uses Leech
Z-modem every where he goes, then get's caught, and then leaves that
BBS never to call back again. This other "hacker" who unfortunatly for
him, used to be a respected person in the H/P community, decides to
get even in an affair that never did concern him. He pulls the 15 year
olds parent's CBI information, and posts it public. The 15 year old
gets pissed off, so calls Patricia Sisson, of SprintNet security, whom
the CBI puller had already had problems with. Thus, a Narc attack...
Well, fortunatly for him, the CBI puller managed to lie and worm and
wiggle himself out of trouble once more, but lost all the respect he
had accumulated because of the CBI pulling... Like I said, I named not
anyone, but people who keep in contact with the news know who it is...

And one more thing I'd like to clear up... I'm sure some of you people
have had trouble logging into some local wares boards, or something
like that, because of the fact that your a hacker... The thing that
goes through that SysOp's mind, is that your comming here to crash
his system. Thus, once again, the "Destructive Computer User"
Stereotype... A board crasher is no more a "hacker" than my
grandmother is.

We, of a dying comumunity, have an obligation towards those who follow
in our footsteps. We must show them how a hacker acts, how a hacker
goes about his activities, what a hacker is supposed to be! We must
not try to kill each other off by reporting each other to the law, or
by destroying our private life. We must stick together in times when
doing what we do becomes difficult...  We must also prove to the
media, who seem to have the idea that all computer owners are
hackers, and that hackers are all teenage under-achievers, that a

    Ok guys I saw this article in Popular Electronics in September 1992
originally published by Anthony J Caristi.  This looks like a neat little
circuit that relates to electronics and telephones.  So I decided to type it up
for the magazine.  Well here it is, enjoy it and if you have any questions on
it please e-mail me either on The Cathedral or on my Internet E-Mail address.
Oh yeah by the way this article is re-published without permission.  (Like I
would really get waste my time to get permission anyways.)

    Safeguard you home or office with a security system that calls when there
is a problem.

    Imagine having an electronic device that would guard your home or office
while you're away, and automatically alert you by phone if there is a break-in
or some other problem requiring your immediate attention.  Well, imagine no
longer; for Teleguard, which we'll show you how to build, will do just that.
Teleguard accomplishes that task by monitoring an open-loop or closed-loop
sensor switch located in the protected area.  When the sensor detects a problem
- such as a break-in, fire, heating-system failure, flood, etc. - Teleguard
dials whatever telephone number has been programmed into its memory.  When the
phone is taken off hook, Teleguard emits an unusual tone to alert the party on
the receiving end that something is amiss.

    The circuit is not hampered by busy signals when a call is placed; it
automatically redials the number again and again (about once a minute) until it
get through.  In addition, Teleguard can also automatically dial a number in
the event of a medical emergency; for instance, where a mobility-impaired
person is unable to dial the telephone.  That can be accomplished by adding a
"panic" switch to the circuit.

    Programming the telephone number to be called is quick and easy, and the
pre-programmed telephone number remains in the circuit's memory as long as it
is connected to the telephone line.  In spite of its ability to retain its
programming, the number to be called can easily be changed whenever desired.
Another feature of Teleguard is that it does not require an internal power
supply; but instead derives its operating power directly from the telephone
line.  And the circuit, although telephone-line powered, won't interfere with
normal telephone use, so it can be left activated at all times.  Imagine the
secure feeling you will have with Teleguard at you service!

About The Circuit

    A schematic diagram of the Teleguard circuit is shown.  At the heart of the
circuit is an MC145412 pulse/tone repertory dialer (U5), which has a built-in,
last-number-redial function.  Integrated circuit U5, which generates dual-tone
multi-frequency (DTMF) signals, is controlled by a common 3 x 4 matrix-type
keypad.  When ever a telephone number is keyed in, U5 retains that number in
memory as long as power is uninterrupted.

    The circuit is connected to the telephone line through a fullwave-bridge
rectifier, composed of D1-D4, making the circuit insensitive to telephone-line
polarity.  The output of the bridge rectifier is applied to R7, D5, and C3,
which form a network that supplies power to the rest of the circuit as well as
providing a memory-retention voltage to U5, ensuring that it will retain the
programmed telephone number.  That voltage is also used to maintain the logic
levels of U2, U3, and U4 when the circuit is in the standby mode.

    Sensor switch SEN1 is an open-loop sensor switch that is used to monitor
the protected area.  The sensor switch is selected to suit your application.
When the circuit is in the standby mode (has not been triggered), the output of
U2-d is low.  That low travels along two paths.  In one path, that low is
applied to U1 (a 555 oscillator/timer) at pin 4, keeping it off, and to pin 1
of U4-a.  The output of U4-a is applied to pin 12 of U5.

    In the other path, the low output of U2-d is inverted by U2-b and applied
to pin 15 of U3 (a 4017 decade counter/divider with decoded outputs), causing
U3's 0 output at pin 3 to go high.  Because there is nothing connected to that
output, it has no affect on the circuit.

    When SEN1 is closed (by an intruder entering a protected area, for
example), pins 12 and 13 of U2-d are pulled low, forcing its output to go high,
enabling U1, while pin 12 of U5 goes low, placing U5 in the off-hook condition.
At the same time, the output of U2-c is driven high.  That high is applied to
Q2, causing it to conduct.  With Q2 conducting, Q1 is forward biased, causing
it to conduct too.  That causes LED1 to light, providing a visual indication
that Teleguard has seized the telephone line.

    As U1 oscillates, U3 begins to count upward, and continues to count
(repeating its 0-9 count) as long as SEN1 remains closed.  The logic levels
generated by U1 at pin 3 and U3 pins 4 and 7 pass through U4 (a-d), producing
two output pulse trains; the on-hook/off-hook pulse train that is applied to
pin 12 of U5, followed by a redial pulse train that is applied pin 2.  The
redial pulse occurs about a second after U5 goes off hook, to allow time for
the telephone network to respond to Teleguard's connection and establish a dial
tone.

    When pin 4 of U4-b goes high, Q3 and Q4 are forward biased, pulling pins 2
and 16 of U5 low.  That's the redial logic required for U5 to output its stored
telephone number.  The circuit then remains dormant until the next
on-hook/off-hook pulse is applied to pin 12 of U5.  The cycle repeats (dialing
the stored number) about once a minute.  During the time between dialing, the
called party has time to answer the telephone.  Whether or not the call is
answered, Teleguard will continue to redial the number about once a minute as
long as SEN1 remains closed.  That ensures that the call will eventually get
through should the called number be busy, or if no one is immediately available
to answer the call.

    Integrated circuit U6 (another 555 oscillator/timer), configured as an
astable multivibrator operating at about 1 kHz is active only when Teleguard
has made connection to the telephone line.  The output of U6 is capacitively
coupled to the phone line, alerting the called party that Teleguard has made
its emergency call.

    Switch S1 is used to initialize the circuit with the preprogrammed
emergency telephone number.  When S1 is placed in the setup position, pin 12 of
U5 is pulled low.  That forces U5 to go off hook, and activates Q1 to seize the
telephone line.  The desired telephone number (including a "1" and area code if
necessary) is then manually entered via the keypad.  After entering the number,
S1 is set to the arm position to deactivate the circuit while retaining the
preprogrammed telephone number.

Construction

    The majority of Teleguard was assembled on a printed circuit board,
measuring 2 by 4 7/16 inches, with the remainder of the circuit (the keypad and
two switches) connected to the circuit board through lengths of insulated wire.

    Once you've gathered the parts listed in the Parts List and prepared your
circuit board, construction can begin.  When assembling the circuit, it is
recommended that sockets be provided for all of IC's.  Begin assembling the
circuit by installing sockets where IC's are indicated.  Do not install any
IC's until instructed to do so.  Once the sockets are in place, install the
jumper connections.  Be careful during this operation; one misconnected jumper
can render your circuit inoperative.

    After that, install the passive components (resistors, capacitors, etc.)
followed by the active components (transistors and diodes), making sure that
all polarized components (diodes, transistors, and electrolytic capacitors) are
properly oriented.  If a polarized component is installed backwards, the
circuit will be inoperative and could possibly self-destruct, taking several
other components along with it.

    Once all of the on-board components have been installed, connect a length
of quad telephone line cord to the circuit board.  For the line cord, you can
use either a commercially available modular plug-to-plug telephone cord, or
make your own.  If you make your own you'll have to connect a modular plug to
one end of the cord.  If the commercial unit is used, cut it in half and strip
the insulation from the free end of one piece.  Then carefully tin the red and
green wires of the cord and solder them to the points indicated.

     Next connect the keypad - a standard telephone 3-by-4 matrix type - to the
board.  The keypad can be salvaged from one of the many low-cost telephones
that are available, or it can be purchased from one of the mail-order houses.
In any event, the keypad has 4 row connections (identified as R1, R2, R3, and
R4) and 3 column terminals (identified as C1, C2, and C3).  Simply connect the
row and column terminals of the keypad to like terminals on the circuit board;
C1 to C1, R1 to R1, and so on.

    After connecting that task, check the wiring very carefully, especially
between the keypad the circuit board.  An error in wiring the keypad to the
circuit will cause misdialed numbers!  While you are at it, inspect the circuit
carefully for the proper placement of all parts, cold solder joints (which
appear as dull blobs of solder), and shorted or opened circuits.  It is far
easier to correct a problem at this stage of the game than to attempt to locate
and correct a problem later.

    The circuit can be housed in any enclosure of suitable size.  The keypad,
S1, and LED1 should be mounted to the side of the enclosure for easy
accessibility.  Prepare the enclosure to accept the off-board components, but
do not mount the circuit in its enclosure yet.  You must first fins out if the
circuit is functioning properly.

Test Setup

    The operation of the circuit can be tested by connecting Teleguard to
telephone line, or using a well-filtered 40 to 50-volt DC power supply to
simulate the power that would otherwise be devired from the telephone line.
The power supply is simply connected to your Teleguard with a 1k, 2-watt
resistor connected in series with the positive output of the DC supply.  The
positive output of the power supply (with its series resistor) is then
connected to the L1 terminal of the Teleguard circuit board.  The negative
power supply output is then connected to the L2 terminal.  If the telephone
line is used for test purposes, a resistor is unnecessary, and polarity is not
important; simply connect the projects modular plug to the telephone line.

    A digital voltimeter or VOM with an input impedance at of least 10 megaohms
with be needed to measure voltage levels within the circuit.  A telephone and
modular duplex adapter - which allows both Teleguard and the telephone to be
plugged into the telephone line simultaneously - are also required for testing.
The adapter allows the telephone to be used to verify that U5 generates a DTMF
signal in response to each number keyed via Teleguard's keypad.

    At this point, all IC sockets should be empty; if not, remove all IC's from
the board.  Set S1 to the arm position and connect the project to the DC supply
or telephone line.  The LED should be unlit.  Allow a minute or so for C3 to
charge, then measure the voltage across that unit.  You should get a reading of
about 5 to 6-volts DC.  If your reading is somewhere out in left field find and
correct the problem before proceeding.

    If the voltage is within specifications, disconnect power and discharge 3.
Then inset all IC's into their respective sockets.  being very careful to
properly orient and seat them in their sockets.  Set S1 to the arm position.
Apply power to the circuit, again allowing a minute or so for C3 to charge.
Set S1 to the setup position; LED1 should light.  Do not proceed with the final
test if LED does not light when S1 is placed in the setup position.

    Continue the checkout by double-checking the orientation of LED1, Q1, Q2,
D6, D7, and C5.  Measure the voltage across C3, making sure that the voltage
across it is at least 5-volts.  Set S1 to arm position for a minute or so.
Flip S1 to the setup position and press each key of the keypad (one at a time)
while examining the waveforms generated at pin 18 of U5 using an oscilloscope.
Each time a key is depressed, a DTMF signal (about 1 volt peak-to-peak) should
be generated.

    Next test Teleguard's programmability and operation under program control.
Program the circuit by momentarily setting S1 to the arm position, and then
return it to setup.  Key in any telephone number using the keypad.  Then set S1
to the arm position, simulate a problem situation by shorting pins 12 and 13 of
U2 to ground.  Maintain the short while monitoring the oscilloscope.  A few
seconds after pins 12 and 13 are grounded, a series of DTMF bursts should
appear at pin 18 of U5 in rapid succession.

    Allow the circuit to remain dormant for about a minute.  The series of DTMF
bursts should reappear.  The cycle should repeat about once a minute as long as
pins 12 and 13 of u2-d remain grounded.  If Teleguard preforms as described,
proceed to the final phase of testing; otherwise troubleshoot the circuit to
locate and repair the fault.

    If U5 fails to generate DTMF signals in response to the keypad entry,
carefully check the wiring between U5 and the keypad.  Closure of any keypad
switch must short one row to one column wire in accordance with the keypad
matrix.  If in doubt, disconnect power to the circuit, remove U5 from its
socket, and use an ohmmeter to verify that each keypad button shorts the
correct terminals of U5.

    If the keypad has been properly connected, verify that U5's crystal
oscillator is functioning properly by holding down any key while examining the
waveform at pins 8 and 9 of U5.  You should get a 2 or 3-volt peak-to-peak,
3.58-MHz waveform only when a keypad key is depressed.  If no oscillation is
present, verify the presence of 5-volts at pin 1 (the supply input) of U5.  Try
a new IC and crystal if possible.

Final Test

    Temporarily remove U6 from its socket to disable the 1-kHz oscillator.
Using the duplex adapter, connect both Teleguard and a telephone to the
telephone line.  Leave the handset on hook, set S1 to arm, and allow a minute
for C3 to charge.  The LED should be unlit.  Set S1 to setup; LED1 should
light, indicating connection to the telephone line.

    Pick up the telephone handset and listen as you key in a number via the
project's keypad; DTMF tones should be heard in the handset in response to the
keystrokes.

    Place the telephone handset on hook, momentarily place S1 in the arm
position, and then switch it back to setup.  Then, with the telephone handset
on hook, key in (via the Teleguard keypad) any key telephone number.  If
possible key in the telephone number of an associate who can then verify that
the circuit is operating properly.  Once Teleguard has dialed out, you can then
use the telephone to engage in normal conversation.  If that checks out, remove
power from the circuit and reinstall U6 in its socket.  Apply power to the
circuit and reprogram Teleguard, as before, by switching S1 from arm to setup,
keying in the desired telephone number, and then switching back to arm.

    The automatic redial function can be checked by shorting pins 12 and 13 of
U2-d to ground to simulate an emergency condition.  After a few seconds, the
programmed number will be dialed.  That can be verified by listening to the
earpiece of the telephone handset.  If an associate answers the call, he or she
should hear the 1-kHz tone.

    If no DTMF signal is generated by the circuit, review the troubleshooting
procedure to locate and repair the fault.  If the automatic-redial feature is
not functioning, carefully check U1 to U4, Q3, Q4, and their associated
components.  if the 1-kHz is absent, check U6 and its associated components.


Using Teleguard

    Teleguard may be connected to any available telephone jack.  A pair of wires
must be run from the circuit to the sensor(s) at the protected door, window,
etc.  If you will be using the circuit to detect fire, flooding, or other
emergencies, use appropriate sensors in your sensor loop.  For normally open
sensor loops, multiple sensors can be connected in parallel and tied to the
circuit to allow detection of a breach at any number of entry points.

    If normally closed sensor switches are used, multiple sensors can be series
connected to the circuit through an inverter to monitor several different
areas.  It is important that no part of the sensor loop be allowed to make
contact with ground though pipes, electrical appliances, etc.  The sensor-loop
ground is derived from Teleguard's circuit board, so use insulated wire to
connect the sensor loop to the board.

    A phone is not required for use with Teleguard.  The circuit can be left
connected to the telephone, without having any adverse affects on the normal
operation of the phone system.  Note that anytime the unit is disconnected from
the line, the number programmed into U5 will be lost.

Programming Teleguard

    With the sensor loop in the safe or dormant condition - normally open
sensor switches open or normally closed sensor switched closed - and connected
to the circuit, set S1 to the arm position and connect Teleguard to the
telephone line.  Allow about 1 minute charging time.  Place S1 to the setup
position.  The LED should light, indicating connection to the telephone company
central office.  Key in the desired telephone number (including a 1 and area
code if necessary).

    After keying the number, immediately set S1 to the arm position.  The LED
should go out.  This completes the setup procedure and among of the circuit.
To change the telephone number at any time, simply repeat the programming
sequence.

    If a sensor is triggered after the circuit is armed, Teleguard will
immediately go off-hook and call the programmed number.  It will continue to do
so, about once a minute, until the protective circuit is restored.  When the
call is answered, the 1-kHz tone will be heard in the handset at the receiving
end, alerting the called party to a problem condition at the protected area.
Of course, be sure to alert others who may pick up the phone about the special
tone should Teleguard call.

Research Experiment #1     Screw U All
                           -----------

Purpose : How many systems one can infect while creating havoc in the BBS
          local bbs community (WWIV BBS's)

Hypothsis : The above will happen....

Materials :
         1: Computer
         2: Phone line & modem
         3: A good collection of virues and utilities
         4: A shity local WWIV net
         5: An ounce of sense (No pun intened!)

Expirment #1:
     Log onto your local lame WWIV BBS and check out the network getting the
numbers to the other bbs that are on the same beg for popularity list. Log
onto the other bbs also using some far out cool name like (coff coff Gravity's
Rainbow).  Leave for validation a LD number most of the time 14 year old kids
can't call to validate and they think it is koolaid, ummm no I mean K-Rad
awesome have a LD user they can't brag about.. After getting access to the
k-rad tranfers section start upload virues that have been Encrypted. May I
suggest No-where mans utilities (tm NukE). Name the virues under K-Rad
utilities that every lame WWIV sysop wants, I.E. Registration to WWIV, be
creative, ususally they will run them. This expirment usually pisses off
users also.

Expirment #2:
   * When you finally figure out what the sysops bbsing hours, which by the
way is 24 hourz a day cuz they have no life,  log onto the BBS and upload
"Coff Coff" to directory "gag gag" and hit "ack spu" .....now your in DOS.
Look at the results at the end of this expirment list *

Expirment #3:
     Upload under the sysop account a good virus that is not detectable by the
current version of scan (Use should had fuck with that too!).  Drop to DOS and
run the virus. The sysop won't pick it up for awhile, then watch him bitch on
the local elite WWIV sysop net. (Hey guys I have seen it ALL! "We must stop
him!")  Maybe if you are lucky other sysops will donwload stuff from each
other and spread diffent viruses to each. For an example upload a good virus
like Devils Dance to one sysop and maybe something like Dark Avenger to
another and see if they can reinfect each other like homos!

Observation:
     All the sysops in these expirment did all the ABOVE!

Conclusion:
     The first time local lammer can be hit always. They do seem to get a
little bit smart as time goes on.  If you are a good decker (hacker) then you
will always be one step infront of them with tricks.

Study Question:

1) Should one run WWIV? NOT!

2) Should one crash a WWIV BBS if one sees one? ALL THE FUKN TIME!

7) What is GRIM REAPERS voice line? 804-741-0005

8) How many viruses has GR upload to area BBS's? 7!

9) What were the names of the viruses upload to area BBS's? Dir-2, Devils
   Dance, Dark Avenger, 1701 Mutantion Engine, 666-B, RNA, 1605 TSR

10) What were the names of trojan uploaded to area BBS's?  Gulf 1991, Nice
    Girl, Ansi Pic's, Duploscan

11) What different handles did GR use to upload all this shit as?  Sam Moore,
    Cold Steal, Lifeguard, The Lord High Warlock, The Ultimate One, Trey
    Meadows, Anarchy, Mr. Athletic, Biniaca, The Dark Night.

                            From Whom The Bells Toll

                            By The Lost Avenger/UPi

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    Well guys I originally saw this article in the Forbes Magazine, August 3,
1992 edition.  (Thanks go to Digital Justice for telling me about this
article).  Anyways I read through it and thought it was a total scream.  Some
of the things they said in it are so crazy I couldn't believe my eyes.  Take a
look for yourself and see what you think about it.  This article pissed me off
so much I think people should write this author of this article at Forbes
Magazine and let him know how stupid the article really is.  Anyways if you
want to write Forbes Magazine here is the address: Forbes Incorporated, 60
Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York 10011.  Oh yeah by the way this article
is originally written by William G. Flanagan & Brigid McMenamin.  This article
was reproduced without permission (like you really give a flying fuck).

    "There are two kinds of (phone) customers: those who have been victims of
tool fraud, and those who will be."

                        -James Snyder, Secret Service Lawyer Turned MCI Lawyer.

    It's every executive's nightmare; One day you call your office and the
phones don't work.

    In October it happened to Mario Ceste, president of Interplex Electronics,
Inc. in New Haven.  Interplex, like many companies today, lives by its 800
number, used by customers to make inquiries and place orders.

    Ceste was away in Dallas and called his home office on the 800 line.  He
got repeated busy signals.  This was serious.  Ceste called on another line to
find out what was wrong.  (TLA: Must be a cheap company, sounds like they only
have one 800 line.)

    But the folks in sales insisted nobody was on the 800 line.  At first
neither AT&T nor the local company, Southern New England Telephone, could find
anything wrong.  Finally, a SNET repairman monitored the 800 line and heard
people speaking Spanish and talking to faraway places.

    Interplex had been hacked.  (TLA: No fucking kidding!)

    By the time the problem was fixed, the $6 million (revenues) company was
struck with over $2,000 in bogus 800 calls and another $15,000 in long distance
charges.  (TLA: Serves these idiots right.)  Worse, Ceste figures at least 100
customers couldn't reach the company with their orders.  (TLA: Ah, poor baby.)
He can't quantify how much business he lost.

    Interplex is hardly unique.  The list of phone fraud victims includes
giants customers like American Express, IBM, Procter & Gamble and large
government agencies, right down to mom-and-pop businesses.  Here are just a few
recent victims;  Avnet, Inc. (over $500,000), the Drug Enforcement Agency
(reportably $2 million) and the U.N. ($1 million).  And NASA confirms that it
also fell victim to a toll fraud - outside estimates put the cost as high as
$12 million - before it wised up to what was happening to taxpayers' money.

    What about recent reports that telephone toll fraud is now under control?
The reports are at best premature.  (TLA: You can say that again.)
Telecommunications technologies are changing rapidly; every innovation creates
new opportunities for the fraudsters.  As Alfred C. Sikes, chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, said recently; "Without active work by all
participants, the (toll fraud) problem can and will get worse as fraud migrates
from one technology to another."

    Who are the culprits?  Organized crime and drug dealers are the bug league
telecrocks.  (TLA: Not!  These guys don't know the computer underground that
well I guess.  Oh well back to the article.)  They cannot risk having their
phone calls tapped or traced, so they use other people's numbers.  Preferably
numbers stolen from a major corporation or huge government agency, where it
will take a while for the fraud to be noticed.

    The Drug Enforcement Agency still blushes over the fact that telecrooks got
hold of its remote access number in Houston in 1989 and used it for almost 18
months.  According to Toll Fraud and Telabuse, a study of the problem by John
J. Haugh and others, the crooks rang up about $2 million in bogus charges, and
a lot of those calls were made to drug exporting countries.  The tab was paid
by taxpayers.

    How does this pervasive and spreading racket work.

    Professional criminals swipe numbers in a variety of way.  They bribe or
intimidate telephone company employees or company insiders familiar with the
phone system.  In 1991 a Sprint supervisor in New York pleaded guiltily to
selling up to 50 access codes a day to supplement his salary.

    The lucre is certainly tempting: The street price for a hot credit card
number is $50 to $100.  These numbers are good for only a day or so, before
telephone company computers block additional calls.  (TLA: Credit cards well
don't they mean calling cards?  The regular ones can last for only a couple
days but it depends on how virgin the card is.  The less people who have the
card the longer it will last.  But on the other hand the corporate cards can
last anywhere from 2-3 months and maybe even longer but then again it depends
on how many people have the card.)

    But the big money is in remote access number, which could have a shelf life
of a month or more before shut down.  Access codes can sell for as much as
$10,000.

    Criminals also get numbers from "dumpsters divers," who root around in
company garbage for buried treasure - such as 800 numbers and access codes.

    Organized crime is into technology, too, and pays technocrooks up to
$10,000 per week to crack telephone systems with their computers, to pluck
cellular telephone numbers from the airwaves or to alter the chips in cellular
phones to charge illicit calls to unsuspecting customers.  It's estimated that
as many as one-third of all cellular phone calls place in the New York City
area are fraudulent.

    Hackers will even sneak into voice-mail systems, where they can operate
undetected for months and be as hard to get rid of as cockroaches.  Meanwhile,
fraud bills mount.

    At pay phones in cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, you often
see lines of immigrants at streetside pay phones.  Is there a shortage of
phones in these neighborhoods?  No.  The folks are queuing up to fork over $10
to $30 to call-sell operators, who will punch in a stolen access code or credit
card number, (TLA: Calling card?) then dial the customer's overseas party.  For
the immigrants it's cut-rate telephoning, for the sellers of the numbers an
illegal but lucrative business.

    In New York, a call-sell operator can rake in $1,000 a day.  "There are
neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx where the call-sell operator is the
local phone company," notes John Haugh, a telecommunications lawyer and
consultant based in Portland, Ore.  Some immigrants know of no other way to
call home.

    Perhaps the most daring call-sell operation on record was the so-called
Coconut Connection case in 1988.  Based in Honolulu, the operators sold long
distance service at a discount to businesses and individuals throughout the
US.  The thieves claimed they were merely reselling "excess" long distance
service purchased from other companies.  The crooks sent out new access codes
to their customers every few days.  Unbeknownst to the customers, these numbers
were stolen.  (TLA: Yawn!)  The Secret Service finally shut the operations
down, arresting 20 people and seizing 12 computer systems and 3,500 stolen
access codes.  That operation alone accounted for $125 million in fraudulent
call annually.

    Petty thieves get in the act, too.  "Shoulder surfers" hang around bus,
train and airline terminals in major cities and spy on people making long
distance calls with credit cards or remote access numbers.  With the help of
binoculars or video cameras, or just good eyesight, they snatch the numbers and
rapidly pass them along to call-sell operators or other crooks.

    There are now so many shoulder surfers and call-sell operators plying their
trade in New York City bus and train stations that AT&T, Sprint, MCI and New
York Telephone have blocked international calls from pay phones in the Port
Authority Bus Terminal and from pay phones in other parts of the city where
call-selling is commonplace.  (TLA: Well up here in this part of Canada you can
any international calls from any payphone no matter where you are.  I am not
sure how much of Canada has this restriction but I know this is true in Ontario
and Quebec.)

    Shoulder surfing and call-selling are popular underworld pastimes not only
because they are lucrative but also because apprehension is rare.  Local
police, the FBI and the Secret Service - which have jurisdiction over long
distance telephone fraud - have other things to so.  And under existing laws
conviction is very difficult, anyways.  The few perpetrators who are caught
red-handed in expensive, time-consuming stings usually pay small fines and
walk.

    But criminals, drug dealers and terrorists, who couldn't communicate
without it, aren't the only ones committing telephone fraud.  Computer hackers
make their their bones - and get their sick jollies - doing it.  They can do
even more damage than professional telecrooks.  (TLA: What a fucking joke.
Yeah right I get my fucking jollies committing telephone fraud.  I do it cause
the fucking cost of calling long distance is so god damn expensive.  If the
price of long distance calling where much cheaper I sincerely believe their
wouldn't be any telephone fraud committed.)

    Witness the horror show experience by International Data group, Inc., a
$770 million (revenues) publisher and trade show operator.  (Among its titles
are Network World, PC World, GamePro and Computer World.)  Once day in
September 1990 virtually all 200 employees at IDG's Peterborough, NH office
found that their voice mailboxes had been rifled.  Their normal greeting had
been replaced with funny voices or gibberish, and their messages had been
erased and replaced with vulgar messages and even bomb threats.  (TLA: Sounds
like what I did to Logitech Mouse down in Southern California.)  It took almost
a full day to straighten out the mess.  But it kept on happening for weeks.
Some days IDG couldn't even use its voice mail at all.  It estimates it lost
$2.4 million in business.

    "It was an absolute nightmare," says Jane Creighton, corporate director of
telecommunications at IDG.  The culprits turned out to be a pair of teenage
boys from New York's Staten Island, miffed at IDG because a poster they'd
ordered through GamePro magazine had never arrived.  They got slaps on the
wrist from authorities.

    If your company has a plain vanilla PBX system, there are untold numbers of
telecrooks out there who can easily crack your system.  How?  Most PBX systems
offer direct inwards systems access (DISA), which enables travelling employees
to call the home office, punch in a code and make long distance calls cheaper
than with a credit card.  Once you know the code, you can use the business
telephones as if you were sitting in one of the company's executive offices.

    To figure out the codes, telecrooks use autodialers, widely available for
$29.  (TLA: Bullshit, you can get a autodialer from any underground BBS for
virtually free and there are so many different ones to choose from.  These
people who wrote the article haven't a clue on what they are talking about.)
Says Bob Fox, assistant vice president of corporate security for Sprint, "If
your company has a remote access feature in your PBX, it is almost certain that
someone, somewhere, at some time, will try to steal your service."  Most PBX
victims say they didn't even know they had remote access capability and had
never used it themselves - until it was used to defraud them.  That's what Salt
Lake City-based Christensen Boyles Corp. days happened when the company was hit
with $212,000 in toll fraud in 1991.

    Now the crooks are migrating into other area, learning how to swipe long
distance service through automatic attendants and call diverters and also how
to create mayhem via voice-mail systems.  It's child's play for the
computer-savvy.  (TLA: Yup, I know the feeling of screwing a company over
good.)

    The tab for all this fraud is horrendous - nearly $4 billion a year and
building.  AT&T, in its most recent annual report to the FCC, listed $1 billion
in uncollectible charges, a substantial amount the result of fraud.

    Individuals, as distinct from businesses, are liable for only $50 worth of
charges for illicit calling card calls, even if thousands of dollars' worth of
calls are stolen.  But businesses aren't so protected unless they are using
calling cars.  Business customers who are defrauded through their own switching
equipment, such as the commonplace PBX systems, are held accountable for the
calls.

    Once, before deregulation, AT&T then the only major long distance carrier,
could simply eat fraud charges and then include them in its rate base - every
customer simply paid a bit fraud charges and then include them in its rate base
- every customer simply paid a bit more for service.  Now business customers
are expected to pay.  Average fraud bill: $90,000 per hit, according to
consultant Haugh.

    Local phone companies wash their hands of the problem completely.  "If an
armored car is robbed on the highway, you can't hold the highway department
responsible," argues a Bell-South spokesman.

    So far, the courts and the Common Carrier Bureau of the Federal
Communications Commission have backed the carriers in refusing to absorb the
losses.

    How vulnerable is your own system?  In all likelihood, very.  "Most users
aren't even aware of toll fraud, but the sad truth is that it's virtually
certain that every large user either has been hit or will be hit sometime in
the future," notes Haugh.

    "No system is 100% hacker-proof," warns Sprint's Fox.  "Managers who think
otherwise are frequently taught a costly lesson."

    When business customers get hit with the charges for fraudulent use of
their PBX systems, they often balk at paying the bill.  That usually means
arguing with AT&T, which has about 63% of the long distance business in the US
and, according to Haugh, bills about 80% of the PBX fraud.

    In some cases AT&T will offer some sort of compromise to ripped-off
customers.  But it continues to insist that the customer, not AT&T, is
responsible.  "The truth remains that the customer is the only one who can
detect and eliminate all fraud, because the customer alone knows what calls are
authorized or unauthorized," notes Richard F. Hope, senior attorney for AT&T.

    Right now all eyes are on a lawsuit brought by Mitsubishi against AT&T.
Mitsubishi, which got hit with a bogus $430,000 bill in 1990, not only refused
to pay the bill but also sued AT&T for $10 million, on the grounds that AT&T
knew its PBX system was vulnerable to fraud but had failed to warn the customer
or to move quickly once that fraud surfaced.  If Mitsubishi wins, other victims
of PBX fraud will doubtless hop on the bandwagon.

    In May Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) introduced a bill that would
forbid long distance carriers to charge state and local governments for toll
fraud unless users were negligent in the operation of their phone equipment.

    AT&T has finally steeped up security and has begun warning customers of the
growing severity of the problem, in stern language: "Hackers.  Phone phreaks.
Petty criminals.  Whatever you call them, they can cost your company big
dollars in unauthorized long distance charges - and worse, in disruption of
business operations," a recent AT&T brochure that preventing PBX fraud is the
customers' problem.

    What about the other major carriers?  Sprint has taken fraud seriously and
has been able to slash its customers' PBX fraud charges by monitoring their
systems more closely.  MCI, too, is stepping up such efforts.

    Their problems are not as acute as AT&T's, of course.  Unlike AT&T, they
don't sell equipment and have fewer customers to monitor.  Further, as new kids
on the block reluctant to upset customers, they are more flexible about
payment for fraudulent calls.  So far Sprint has not sued to collect, and MCI
offers customers a flat 30% off the cost of fraud calls for a first-time event.
But the best strategy for long distance business customers, of course, is to
make their own systems harder to crack.

    To make your system less vulnerable to PBX fraud:

    o    Restrict long distance and international calling.  (Especially if you
         seldom or never call the Caribbean or drug-exporting countries such as
         Pakistan and Colombia, for example.)

    o    When installing or upgrading your PBX system, always ask the installer
         about its vulnerabilities and how to configure the system to best
         protect yourself.  Don't accept risky features like Remote Access or
         External Call Forwarding unless you really need them.  If you do,
         restrict or prohibit their use after hours and on weekends, when
         hackers attack and call-sell operators and telecrooks cash in on
         purloined numbers.

    o    Don't rely on default passwords or default access numbers.  Hackers
         know them.  (TLA: No shit!)  Use long, random numbers and change them
         often.

    o    Explore ways to protect your remote maintenance port.  Remote
         maintenance lets the serviceman monitor and fix your phone system
         without a trip to your office.  But it also lets crooks disable and
         even take over your entire phone system.  MCI special counsel James
         Snyder says this is "the number one problem facing business today."
         One possibility: Use a callback modem.

    o    Monitor call detail records, and consider adding software that catches
         signs of hacking and alerts the systems operator right away.  A few
         examples: Teltrol Systems' Fraud Finder, Phone Plus' Ultimate Fraud
         Detection Module and Moscom Corp.'s HackerTracker.

    o    Read up on the subject.  Two good sources: Toll Fraud and Telabuse, by
         John J. Haugh and others, $270 (call 1-800-435-7878); Voice Processing
         System Security, by Tom Fermazin and Marc Robins, $295 (call
         212-614-9842).

    o    Consider telefraud insurance, just introduced by Sprint and about to
be introduced by AT&T.  It's expensive and limited, and doesn't cover you
against business losses if hackers paralyze your system.  Only the bogus phone
charges are covered.  But it can save you from horrendous fraud charges.
Sprint's plan limits your fraud liability to $25,000, provided your beef up
your security.  Cost?  for a typical company with ten PBX locations, $1,000 to
sign up and $1,000 a month after that.  So far, roughly 40 major companies have
inquired about the plan.

    AT&T recently responded with two similar plans.  The first one limits your
liability to $12,500 if you catch the fraud, $25,000 is AT&T catches it.  A
typical company with ten PBX locations would pay a $1,200 sign-up fee and
$1,200 a month.  If your company agrees to taken even tighter security
measures, AT&T will relieve it of all liability for toll fraud.  For that
protection, the cost is a $2,250 sign-up free and $3,000 a month for a typical
customer.

    But make no mistake about it: As the crooks become more expert in the
rapidly changing telecommunications technologies, telephone toll fraud will get
worse before it gets better.

For sale: phone-phreaking tools

    From his remote outpost in Alamogordo, NM, John Williams makes a nice
living telling hackers how to rip off phone and computer systems.

    Williams says he brings in about $200,000 a year in publishing books on
everything from credit card scams and cracking automated teller machines to
electronic shoplifting, cellular phone phreaking and voice mailbox hacking,
each costing $29 to $39, and each complete with precise instructions.  he even
sells Robofones, which save hackers from doing a lot of dialing while they
steal access codes.

    Isn't what he does illegal?  Perhaps it should be, but it isn't  Wrapping
himself in the First Amendment, Williams is a member in good standing of the
Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce and the New Mexico Better Business Bureau.  He
thumbs his nose at companies and authorities that would like to make him stop
selling such secrets.

    "We don't promote fraud," he insists.  "It's all sold for educational
purposes only.  If we didn't publish the information, it would still be out
there."

    But last year Williams got a visit from the Secret Service, which was
following up on a telephone fraud case in which one of his publications figured
prominently.

    In Gainesville, Fla., in November 1990, two young men were locked up by
police for hacking into voice-mail systems and then making calls to 900
numbers.  One of the pair, known as the Shark, then 20, confessed to the crime
but said he was on assignment for Williams' Consumertronics publication.  The
culprits could have been given five years on the fraud charge alone.  But the
victims didn't want any publicity, so the state them do 50 hours of community
service instead.

    The Secret Service went to talk to Williams.  Williams assured agent James
Pollard that he'd never told the Shark to do anything illegal.  nevertheless,
says Williams, the agent implied that Williams and members of his gamily who
work for him might be prosecuted for publishing voice-mail access codes.

    In the end, no charges were filed against Williams, who admits he has a
thing against big business, especially the phone companies.  "For decades, they
financed right-wing regimes in Latin America," he rants.

    It's a crazy world, that of the telephone toll fraudsters.

                                The Hacker Hood

                            By The Lost Avenger/UPi

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    Well guys it look's like Forbes Magazine has published another article
about hacking & phreaking just recently.  (Not sure exactly what the date that
this article published on.  But really I don't give a fuck and I don't think
you would either).  I read through it and it was just lame as the last article
that was published, which made me decide to re-type it out for the magazine.
So here it is.  Take a look at it and check it out for yourself and decide
for yourself if these two articles are really that lame.  And once again this
article was re-typed with permission.  (Yeah, like I would really waste my tim
in getting permission).  Special thanks go out to Major Thrill for telling me
about this article.  Without him this article would have never been published.

    Computer crimes committed by a new generation of hacker hoods might cost
anywhere from $500 million to $5 billion a year.  (TLA: Really now?  No
fucking kidding.)  Whatever the number, it's clear that a computer crime wave
is reaching epidemic proportions.

    "The playground bullies are learning how to type"
     By William G. Flanagan and Brigid McMenamin

    Leonard Rose, a 33-year-old computer consultant and father of two, is also
a felon.  He recently completed 8 1/2 months in a federal prison camp in North
Carolina, plus 2 months in a halfway house.  His crime?  Passing along by
computer some software code filched from Bell Labs by an AT&T employee.  Rose,
who now lives in California, says he is still dazed by the harsh punishment he
recieved.  "The Secret Service," he says, "made an example of me."

    Maybe so.  But if so, why are the cops suddenly cracking down on the
hackers?  Answer: because serious computer crime is beginning to reack epidemic
proportions.  (TLA: It took them this long to find that out?)  The authorities
are struggling to contain the crimes, or at least slow their rapid growth.

    Rose agrees the hacker world is rapidly changing for the worse.  "You're
getting a different sort of person now," he says of the hacker community.
"You're seeing more and more criminals using computers."

    One well-known veteran hacker, who goes by the name Cheshire Catalyst, puts
it more bluntly: "The playground bullies are coming infoors and learning how to
type."

    Rose and the Cheshire Catalyst are talking about a new breed of computer
hackers, These aren't just thrill-seeking, boastful kids, but serious (if
boastful) cybercrooks.  They use computers and telecommunications links partly
for stunt hacking itself a potentially dangerous and costly game but also to
steal valuable information, software, phone service, credit card numbers and
cash.  And they pass along and even sell their services and techniques to
others including organized crime.

    Hacker hoods often extaggerate their escapades, but there is no doubt that
their crimes are extensive and becoming more so at an alarming rate.  Says
Bruce Sterling, a notet cyberpunk novelist and author of the nonfiction *The
Hacker Crackdown* (Bantam Books, 1992, $23): "Computer intrusion, as a
nonprofit act of intellectual exploration and mastery, is in slow decline, at
least in the United States; but electronic fraud, especially telecommunications
crime is growing by leaps and bounds."

    Who are these hacker hoods and what do they do for a living?  Take the 19
year-old kid who calls himself Kimble he is a very real person, but for reasons
that will become clear, he asks us to mask his identity.

    Based in Germany, Kimble is the leader of an international hacker group
called Dope.  He is also one of the most celebrated hackers in his country.  He
has appeared on German TV (in disguise) and is featured in the December issue
of the German magazine *Capital*.

    From his computer terminal, Kimble spends part of each day cracking PBX
systems in the U.S., a lucrative form of computer crime.  PBXs are the phone
systems businesses own or lease.  Hackers break into them to steal access
numbers, which they then resell (TLA: Or trade?) to other hackers and,
increasingly, to criminals who use the numbers to transact their business.

    Kimble, using a special program he has written, claims he can swipe six
access codes a day.  He says he escapes prosecution in Germany because the
antihacking laws are more lax than in the U.S.  "Every PBX is an open door for
me," he brags, claming he has a total of 500 valid PBX codes.  At Kimble's
going price of $200 a number, that's quite an inventory, especially since
numbers can be sold to more than one customer.

    Kimble works the legal side of the street, too.  For example, he sometimes
works for German banks, helping them to secure their systems against invasions.
This might not be such a hot idea for the banks.  "Would you hire a former
burglar to install your burglar alarm?" asks Robert Kaine, president of
Intrusion Detection, a New Your-based computer security consulting firm.  (TLA:
Well wouln't the former burglar know the ins and outs of bank security)

    Kimble has also devised an encrypted telephone that he says cannot be
tapped.  In just three months he says he has sold 100.

    Other hacker hoods Forbes spoke to in Europe say they steal access numbers
and resell them for up to $500 to the Turkish mafia.  A solid market.  Like all
organized crime groups, they need a constant supply of fresh, untraceable and
untappable telephone numbers to conduct drug and other illicit business.

    Some crooked hackers will do a lot worse for hire.  For example, one is
reported to have stolen an East German Stasi secret bomb recipe in 1989 and
sold it to the Turkish mafia.  Another boasted to Forbes that he broke into a
London police computer and, for $50,000 in Deutsche Marks, delivered its access
codes to a young English criminal.

    According to one knowledgeable source, another hacker brags that he
recently found a way to get into Citibank's computers.  For three months he
says he quietly skimmed off a penny or so from each account.  Once he had
$200,000, he quit.  Citibank says it has no evidence of this incident and we
cannot confirm the hacker's story.  But, says computer crime expert Donn Parker
of consultants SRI International: "Such a 'salami attack' is definately
possible, especially for an insider."  (TLA: Nice way to make easy cash!)

    The tales get wilder.  According to another hacker hood who insists on
anonymity, during the Gulf War an oil company hired one of his friends to
invade a Pentagon computer and retrieve information from a spy satellite.  How
much was he paid?  "Millions," he says.

    No one knows for sure just how much computer crime costs individuals,
corporations and the government.  When burned, most victims, especially
businesses stay mum for fear of looking stupid or inviting copycats.  According
to *Law and Order* magazine, only an estimated 11% of all computer crimes are
reported.

    Still, the FBI estimates annual losses from computer-related crime range
from $500 million to $5 billion.

    The FBI is getting more and more evidence that the computer crime wave is
building every day.  Computer network intrusions one way of measuring attempted
cracking of computer systems have risen rapidly.  According to USA Research,
which specializes in analyzing technology companies, hacker attacks on U.S.
workplace computers increased from 339,000 in 1989 to 684,000 in 1991.  It's
estimated that by 1993, 60% of the personal computers in the U.S. will be
networked, and therefore vunerable to intrusion.

    While companies dislike talking about being ripped off by hackers, details
sometimes leak out.  In 1988, for instance, seven men were indicted in U.S.
Federal court in Chicago for using phony computer-generated transactions to
steal $70 million from the accounts of Merril Lynch, United Airlines and
Brown-Forman at First National bank of Chicago.  Two plead guilty; the other
five were tried and convicted on all counts.

    According to generally reliable press reports, here are some ways comouter
criminals ply their trade:

    o    In 1987 Volkswagen said it had been hit with computer-based foreign-
         exchange fraud that could cost nearly $260 million.

    o    A scheme to electronically transfer $54 million in Swiss francs out of
         the London branch of the Union Bank of Switzerland without
         authorization was reported in 1988.  It was foiled when a chance
         system failure prompted a manual check of payment instructions.

    o    Also in 1988, over a three-day period, nearly $350,000 was stolen from
         customer accounts at Security Pacific National Bank, possibly by
         automated teller machine thieves armed with a pass key card.

    o    In 1989 IRS agents arrested a Boston bookkeeper for electronically
         filing $325,000 worth of phony claims for tax refunds.

    o    In 1990 it was reported that a Malaysin bank executive cracked his
         employer's security system and allegedly looted customer accounts of
         $1.5 million.

    o    Last year members of a ring of travel agents in California got two to
         four years in prison for using a computer reservation terminal to
         cheat American Airlines of $1.3 million worth of frequent flier
         tickets.

    U.S. prosecutors say that members of a New York hacker group called MOD,
sometimes known as Masters of Deception, took money for showing 21-year-old
Morton Rosenfield how to get into the computers of TRW Information Services and
Trans Union Corp.  Caught with 176 credit reports, Rosenfeld admitted selling
them to private investigators and others.  In October he was sentance to eight
months in prison.

    The newest form of cybercrime is extortion by computer give me money or
I'll crash your system.  "There is no doubt in my mind that things like that
are happening," says Chuck Owens, chief of the FBI's economic crime unit.  But
Owens won't talk about ongoing cases.

    Many hackers are young, white, male computer jocks.  They include genuinely
curious kids who resent being denied access to the knowledge-rick computer
networks that ring the globe, just because they can't affored the telephone
access charges.  (To satisfy their needs in a legitimate way, two smart New
York young hackers, Bruce Fancher and Patrick Kroupa, this year started a
widely praised new bulletin board called MindVox-modem: 212 988 5030.  It's
cheap and allows computer users to chat, as well as gain access to several
international computer networks, among other things.)

    Then there are the stunt hackers.  Basically these are small-time hoods who
crash and occasionally trash supposedly secure computer networks for the sheer
fun of it.  They swap and sell stolen software over pirate bulletin boards.
One of these hackers send Forbes an unsolicited copy of MS-DOS 6.0.  (TLA: Oh
whoopie do!)  Microsoft Corp.'s newest operating system, which isn't even
scheduled to be on the market until next year.  (TLA: But has been ou in the
pirate scene for ages.)  It worked fine.  (We first had it tested for viruses
with Cyberlock Data Intelligence, Inc.  In Philadelphia, an electronicdata
security firm with a sophisticated new hardware-based system that's used to
detect viruses.)

    The more malicious stunt hackers like to invade company voice mail systems
and fool around with so-called Trojan horses, which can steal passwords and
cause other mischief, as well as viruses and other computer generate smoke
bombs, just to aise hell.

    This kind of hacking around can wreak tremendous damage.  Remember Robert
Tappan Morris.  In 1988 Morris, then a 22-year-old Cornell University grad
student, designed a worm computer program that could travel all over computer
networks and reproduce itself indefinately.  Morris says he meant no harm.
But in November 1988 Morris released the worm on the giant Internet computer
network and jammed an estimated 6,000 computers tied into Internet, including
those of several universities, NASA and the Air Force, before it was stopped.
Damages were estimaged as high as $185 million.

    That event was something of a watershed for the law enforcement people.  In
1990 Morris was one of the first hackers to be convicted of violating the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.  He could have been sentanced to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  Instead, Morrise got just three years'
probation, a $10,000 fine, 400 hours of community service and had to pay his
probation costs.  Today he'd probably be thrown in the slammer.

    After the curious kids and the stund hackers, a third element in the hacker
underworlds is made up of members of organized crime, hard-core cybercrooks,
extortionists, shady private-investigators, credit card cheats, disgruntled
ex-employees of banks, telephone, and other companies, and various computer-
savvy miscreants.  These are computer thugs who hack for serious dollars, or
who buy other crooked hackers' services and wares.  (TLA: Oh no warez d00ds.)

    One of the peculiarities of hackers is that many cannot keep their mouthes
shut about their illegal exploits.  They bost on their underground bulletin
boards and in their publications about all the nasty things they can, and
occasionally do, pull off.  They brag to the press and even to the authorities.
Witness Germany's Kimble and many of the other hacker hoods who talked to
Forbes for this article.

    Over their own underground bulletin boards, hackers have brazenly broadcast
all kinds of gossip, software and trophy files brought back like scalps from
intrusions into other people's computers.  The most famous example is the 911
file purloined from BellSouth, which prosecutors said had key information about
the vital 911 emergency telephone network.  The file turned out to be far less
valuable than alleged.  Nonetheless, its theft and, later, its mere possession
got a whole raft of hackers including a group called the Legion of Doom in big
trouble.  Over the past three years, several of them have neem busted and their
computer equiptment seized.  A few drew stiff jail terms.

    The hackers even have their own above-ground magazines.  One, *2600, the
Hacker Quarterly*, is sold on newsstands.  In the current issue, there is an
article on how to crack COCOTS, customer-owned coin-operated telephones, and
get free long distance service.  While the publisher of *2600* advises readers
not to try such schemes, the easy-to-follow instructions are right there, in
black and white.

    The publisher of *2600*, Eric Corley (alias Emmanuel Goldstein), claims
that he is protected by the First Ammendment.  But readers who follow some of
the instructions printed in *2600* magazine may find themselves in deep trouble
with law enforcement.  Notes senior investigator Donald Delaney, a well-known
hacker tracker with the New York State Police: "He [Corley] hands copies out
for free of charge to kids.  Then they get arrested."

    An even bolder magazine, *Hack-Tic*, is published by Rop Gonggrijp in
Amsterdam, a hacking hot-bed thanks in part to liberal Dutch laws.  *Hack-Tic*
is something like *2600*, bus with even more do-it-yourself hacking
information.

    The hacker hoods stage their own well-publisized meetings and conventions,
which are closely watched by the authorities.  On the first Friday of every
month, for example, at six cities in the U.S., *2600* magazine convenes
meetings where hackers can, in the words of the magazine itself, "Come by, drop
off articles, ask questions, find the undercover agents."

    Forbes dropped by *2600*'s Nov. 6 meeting in New York.  It was held in the
lobby of the Citicorp Center on Lexington Avenue, a sort of mini urban mall,
with lots of pay phones-phones are to hackers what blood vessels are to
Dracula.

    On this particular Friday the two or three dozen attendees consist mainly
of teenage boys and young men wearing jeans and T shirts and zip-up jackets.
Most are white, though there are some blacks and Asians.  Most of these young
people pretty much resemble the kids next door or the kids under your own
roof.  A few look furtive, almost desperate.  (TLA: Yeah ok whatever you say.)

    Moving easily among the kids are a few veteran hackers and, watching them,
some well-known hacker trackers, sometimes even New York State Police's Don
Delaney.  He might lurk on one of the upper levels of the Citicorp Center or
stroll past the pay phones looking for a suspect wanted in New York.  Don't the
suspects stay away?  Not necessarily.  At one meeting Delaney walked right past
three young men he had arrested, and not one of them even noticed him.
"They're in their own world," he explains.

    On the edge of the crown stands a slight, intense young man wearing an
earring and a neatly folded blue bandana around his head.  Twenty-year-old
Phiber Optik, as he calls himself, is currently under federal indictment in New
York, charged with sudry computer crimes.  According to federal authorities, he
and other members of the hacker group called MOD sold access to credit
reporting services and destroied via computer a television station's
educational service, among other things.  Phiber Optik claims that he's
innocent.

    As the group grows, *2600* publisher Corley makes a dramatic enterance.  He
looks as if he's in his mid-30s and wears 1960s-style long black hair.  A baby-
faced assistant stands at his side, selling T shirts and back issues of *2600*
magazine.

    Now and then Corley darts to the pay phones to take phone calls from other
hacker meetings around the world.  After taking one call he turns around with a
worried look.  He has just heard that the *2600* meeting at a mall in
Arlington, Va. was busted by mall security and the Secret Service.
Authorities there demanded the names of the two dozen or so attendees,
confiscated their bags containing printouts and computer books, and booted them
out of the mall.

    The group in Arlington was lucky compared with what happened to some
hackers attending "PumpCon," a hacker convention held at the Courtyard by
Marriott in Greenburgh, N.Y., over the recent Halloween weekend.  Responding to
a noise complaint, the police arrived, then got a search warrant and raided the
hackers' rooms.  The cops confiscated computer equiptment and arrested four
conventioneers for computer crimes.  Three were held in lieu of $1,000 bail.
No bail was set for the fourth, a 22-year-old wanted for computer fraud and
probation violation in Arizona.

    Around the country, computer users of every stripe are growing concerned
that law enforcement officials, in their zeal to nail bigtime cybercrooks and
computer terrorists, may be abusing the rights of other computer users.  In
come cases, users have been raided, had their equiptment confiscated, yet years
later still have not been charged with any wrong doing nor had their equiptment
returned.

    In 1990 Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapoe and Grateful Dead lyricist
John Perry Barlow, with help from Apple Computer co-founder Stephen Wozniak and
John Gilmore, formerly of Sun Microsystems, started a nonprofit group called
the Electronic Fronteir Foundation (EFF).  Its aim is to defend the
constitutional rights of all computer users.

    But if you know someone who likes to hack around, pass along this advice to
her or him: While it is a common myth among hackers that the authorities will
let them go if they reveal how they accomplished their mischief, the days of
such benign treatment have dissappeared as the computer crime wave has built.

    "If it's a crime, it's a crime," warns the New Your State Police's Don
Delaney, "The laws are for a good reason".  (TLA: Ho hum...)  For the most
part, law enforcement is just reacting to the complaints from victims.

                     Volume Two, Issue Seven, File 13 of 19


                **********  PUMPCON  BUSTED!!!  ***********
                                10/31/92
                    written by someone who was there
                     who wishes to remain anonymous

NOTICE:  The word "Hacker" is used frequently throughout this file -
         it is to be interpreted as "a computer literate person", and
         NOT as "someone who engages in illegal activities using a
         computer".

Friday, October 30, Pumpcon began, at the Courtyard of the Marriott,
in Greenburgh, NY.  All in all, about 30 hackers showed up, and had a
great time.  At least until the evening of Oct. 31st, when 8-10
members of the Greenburgh police force showed up and raided the Con.
At the time of the raid, there were between 20 and 25 hackers in the
hotel.  3 of the 4 rooms rented by Con attendees were raided.  All the
occupants of these rooms were taken to a conference room, and then
another hotel room (255) where they were held approximately 6-8 hours
for questioning.

The police all came in unmarked police cars, and parked on all 4 sides
of the hotel.  No one noticed they were there, until they were
standing in the hall where all 4 rooms were located.  The officers
stood in the hall outside the doors, but did not enter the rooms right
away.  They waited about five minutes, for some unknown reason, which
was just enough time for them to be noticed by the hackers in at least
one of the rooms.  Unfortunately, there was no way the hackers in one
room could warn the other rooms - the fone lines were busy, and the
cops in the hall kinda left the "walk down and tell 'em in person"
option out.

The police produced copies of a search warrant to search rooms 246,
233, and 237.  Room 246 was the one where everyone was hanging out; it
was pretty much THE room.  It was where the computers were located,
and where most of the Con attendees were 99% of the time.  The other
two rooms were rented by attendees of the con, and were simply used
for sleeping quarters.

Before too long, the police entered the rooms, and began rounding up
people.  My recollection of this time period is a bit faint, and I
don't remember all the minute details.  All I know is that we all
ended up in a conference room, and then room 255.

A few hackers who had been out driving around during the time of the
bust returned a few hours later, and when they were seen by police,
they were immediately taken to 255 and questioned.  (They were walking
down the hall, when a cop appeared, and told them to step into a room)
The cops asked them if they were hackers, and when they didn't answer,
one police officer reached into the coat pocket of one of the people,
and produced an auto dialer.  This in itself was enough to send the
three to room 255, where the rest of the hackers were being held for
questioning.  My question to you - isn't that just a bit illegal?
Bodily search without probable cause OR a warrant?  Ooops - I'm
forgetting - we're HACKERS!  We're ALL BAD!  We're ALWAYS breaking the
law.  We don't have RIGHTS!

Room 255 was packed.  No one was allowed to smoke, and everyone was
nervous as hell.  One by one people were called to be interviewed,
with some interviews lasting 5 minutes, others lasting 30 or 45
minutes.  Some people were sleeping, others were conversing, and still
others were shaking, and looked like they were about to puke at any
second.  Even though the situation was quite serious, a few joked
around, saying things like "So guys, I guess PumpCon '93 won't be held
here, eh?".

No one knew who was going to be arrested, or when they would be
released.  The 2 cops in the room with them were actually pretty cool,
and answered any questions they could to the best of their knowledge.
They weren't the guys in charge of the investigation; they were simply
there to make sure we didn't leave.  Of course, as friendly as they
seemed, they were still cops...

All the people who were detained were held until between 5:45 and
6:30 am.  Four hackers were arrested, 1 because 2 of the rooms were
registered in his name, a second because he signed for the rooms, and
the others for previous crimes, apparently.  No one knows as of yet.
As of this message, no news on what will become of those arrested is
known.  They have not yet been arraigned.  The other hackers were all
searched, questioned, and then released pending further investigation.
Those under the age of 18 had their parents notified.

To my knowledge, there were no federal investigators there at the time
of the bust.  However, people kept mentioning the FBI and the Secret
Service, and it is very possible that they will be called in to
investigate.  Actually, it's more than just possible, it's almost
guaranteed.  The police said that although most of those detained were
released, there will most likely be more arrests in the near future,
as more is learned about the alleged illegal doings.

3 computers (2 Amigas, and 1 AT&T dumb term) were confiscated, along
with anything which looked like it could have been involved in phone
fraud.  For some odd reason, although Auto Dialers were listed on the
search warrant, not all of them were confiscated.  I actually don't
know if ANY were, I do know that not ALL were. ;)

In one of the rooms, there were about 2 dozen computer magazines which
were apparently confiscated, although the warrant did not specify that
magazines could be taken.  But, when you're busting HACKERS, I suppose
you can take what you want.  After all, hackers are evil geniuses, and
don't have the same rights as NORMAL criminals do.

As of yet, the actual charges against the hackers are not known.   The
raid apparently stemmed because the hackers were ALLEGEDLY using
stolen calling card numbers and/or access codes to obtain free phone
calls.  One of these card numbers or codes was rumored to have
tripped a flag at AT&T, which alerted security personnel that something
was possibly wrong.

This assumption about the calling card fraud is made because the
police confiscated any calling card found during their searches, and
some of the questions they asked the detained centered entirely around
calling card theft and use.  A few other questions asked me were "Do
you know what computer systems were accessed?", "Do you refer to each
other with handles?", "Who was primarily responsible for this
meeting?", and "Where did you hear about this meeting?"

My interview lasted only about 10 minutes, and it started at about
5:50 am.  Everyone was dead tired, and the cops wanted to get
everything over with as fast as possible so they could get some sleep.
After the interviews were over, everyone left, to wait and see what
the next few days will bring.

I am releasing this file now, to prevent any rumors from starting, and
to try to make the outside world aware of what happened during
PumpCon.  I have left out any specific incidences and references to
specific people as a precaution, since the investigation is only
beginning.  We were hoping to write a file of all the attendees of
PumpCon, to share with the world the names of those who were there.
However, as you can obviously see, that would be highly stupid.  For
anyone who WAS there who is reading this, rest assured that the
running list of names which was kept made a very tasteless dinner for
the one who had it in his pocket.

Oh, BTW, one of the cops who was apparently in charge made a comment
to me... he said "You can post a message on the boards telling your
friends to stay out of Greenburgh".  Well boys, you heard him -
PumpCon '93 will be held in Greenburgh, at the Courtyard Marriott....

                            *--------------*

The following is a word for word copy of the search warrant issued to
each person who was detained and questioned.  No spelling errors were
corrected, but I probably made a few when I typed this in.  Oh well.

          How To Social Engineer Pizza Pizza For CNA  By Major Thrill
         -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  I am writing this file for numerous reasons, one being that 416
  is dead of any new information. Two because one day this may come
  in handy when you for some reason MUST do a CNA and can't get the
  address out of the regular CNA numbers. Let me explain why we can use
  Pizza Pizza for this purpose. There is a 95 per cent chance that the
  number you are trying to check has ordered pizza from Pizza Pizza.
  (If they haven't, then maybe they couldn't remember the phone number.)
  Pizza Pizza keeps track of who orders pizza by using a computer program.
  Now, when you call Pizza Pizza to order a pizza, the ask for your phone
  number. This phone number then is matched with your home address, which
  is usually there if you have ordered pizza from them before. This method
  is used by them to prevent prank pizza orders, and undoubtably to speed
  up the process and get your pizza there in 30 minutes or whatever the
  guarantee is. Now the question you are asking is, how do I get my hot
  little hands on that info for a number? Simple. You are dealing with
  bored feebs. The trick is to amuse their small minds enough to casually
  slide in a request for CNA. Here is a typical scenerio of what we have
  experimented with and have found to work.


  1. First, set up a 3-way of all your phriends, (try to get about 5 on as
     a minimum.)  Conferance works even better, but this will do.

  2. Call Pizza Pizza, (use a divertor if you are paranoid.) and hopefully
     you will get a female on who is extremely bored.

  3. This gets even funnier, but it works. Now talk very loudly in an English
     accent and say "Hullo, Your're on conferance!" "Who's this?"

  4. The trick is to get them thinking they are talking to people all over the
     world. (One I used 3 different types of accents with one other person on
     the line) This usually excites them, because it is no longer monotonous
     answering the phone. Now here is where you get them talking, be upbeat
     and entertain them a bit, all the while being courteous to them and
     including them in the conversation. Now if you are lucky, they will
     be enjoying the change of pace as opposed to answering telephones
     and asking if you want pepsi with your order.

   5. Now, if all is going well, you should ask them about their computer
      (tell em your phone phreaks or hackers in the beginning.) system and
      is it really true they can tell what address your phone number is at.

   6. This can go two ways, they will either oblidge you, or think they are
      working at the fucking pentagon. Now, if they tell you about it,
      casually bring up a number you'd like to check.

   7.  Hopefully at this point you will have got what you called for in the
       first place. I even had one of them tell me how many pizza's the
       person ordered. But in any case do not just hang up on them after
       you get the number. Get their name again if you forgot it, and ask
       them if it would be okay to call them again. There, you got yourself
       an in at Pizza Pizza. Don't treat them rudely and NEVER burn your
       bridges.



 Don't be afraid to try other methods of social engineering with these
 people, or anyone for that matter. Social engineering saves alot of time
 and trouble on your part. I suggest using a payphone when social engineering
 for more tough-to-get info or a divertor or PBX.
 BTW-At last check the regular CNA offices no longer give out address.
 As well I understand that 241 Pizza has also implemented this computer
 system. Hope you enjoyed this textfile.

         The United Phreaker's Incorporated Underground Newsline Part 1

                       By Arch Bishop & The Lost Avenger


                U.S. Phone Companies Face Built-In Privacy Hole
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 [ Courtesy of 2600 Magazine Winter 1991-1992 ]

    Phone companies across the nation are cracking down on hacker explorations
in the world of Busy Line Verification (BLV).  By exploiting a weakness, it's
possible to remotely listen in on phone conversations at a selected telephone
number.  While the phone companies can do this any time they want, this
recently discovered self-serve monitoring feature has created a telco crisis of
sorts.

    According to an internal Bellcore memo from 1991 and Bell Operating Company
documents, a "significant and sophisticated vulnerability" exists that could
affect the security and privacy of BLV.  In addition, networks using a DMS-TOPS
architecture are affected.

    According to this and other documents circulating within the Bell Operating
Companies, an intruder who gains access to an OA&M port in an office that has a
BLV trunk group and who is able to bypass port security and get "access to the
switch at a craft shell level" would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

    The intruder can listen in on phone calls by following these four steps:

    1.   Query the switch to determine the Routing Class Code assigned to
         the BLV trunk group.

    2.   Find a vacant telephone number served by that switch.

    3.   Via recent change, assign the Routing Class Code of the BLV trunks
         to the Chart Column value of the DN (directory number) of the vacant
         telephone number.

    4.   Add call forwarding to the vacant telephone number (Remote Call
         Forwarding would allow remote definition of the target telephone
         number while Call Forwarding Fixed would only allow the specification
         of one target per recent change message or vacant line)."

    By calling the vacant phone number, the intruder would get routed to the
BLV trunk group and would then be connected on a "no-test vertical" to the
target phone line in a bridged connection.

    According to one of the documents, there is no proof that the hacker
community knows about the vulnerability.  The authors did express great concern
over the publication of an article entitled "Central Office Operations - The
End Office Environment" which appeared in the electronic newsletter Legion of
Doom/Hackers Technical Journal.  In this article, reference is made to the "No
Test Trunk."

    The article says, "All of these testing systems have one thing in common:
they access the line through a No Test Trunk.  This is a switch which can drop
in on a specific path or line and connect it to the testing device.  It depends
on the device connected to the trunk, but there is usually a noticeable click
heard on the tested line when the No Test Trunk drops in.  Also, the testing
devices I have mentioned here will seize the line, busying it out.  This will
present problems when trying to monitor calls, as you would have to drop in
during the call.  The No Test Trunk is also the method in which operator
consoles perform verifications and interrupts."

    In order to track down people who might be abusing this security hole,
phone companies across the nation are being advised to perform the following
four steps:

    1.   Refer to Chart Columns (or equivalent feature tables) and validate
         their integrity by checking against the corresponding office records.

    2.   Execute an appropriate command to extract the directory numbers to
         which features such as BLV and Call Forwarding have been assigned.

    3.   Extract the information on the directory number(s) from where the
         codes relating to BLV and Call Forwarding were assigned to vacant
         directory numbers.

    4.   Take appropriate action including on-line evidence gathering, if
         warranted."

    Since there are different vendors (OSPS from AT&T, TOPS from NTI, etc.) as
well as different phone companies, each with their own architecture, the
problem cannot go away overnight.

    And even if hackers are denied access to this "feature", BLV networks will
still have the capability of being used to monitor phone lines.  Who will be
monitored and who will be listening are two forever unanswered questions.

    San Jose Calif-(AP)  A 28-year old computer whiz who reportedly once tested
Departement of Defense computer security proceedures has become the first
alleged computer hacker to be charged with espionage.

    The government says that Kevin Lee Poulson stole classified military
secrets should go to prison.  But his lawyer calls him,"an intellectually
curious computer nerd.".

    Poulsen of Menlo Park,Calif., worked in the mid-1980's as a consultant
testiing pentegon computer security.  Because of prosecution delays, he was
held without bail in a San Jose jail for 20 months before being charged this
week.

    His attorney, Paul Metzer, said Thursday that Poulson did not knowingly
possess classified information.  The military information had been declassified
by the time prosocuters by the time Poulson obtained it, Meltzer said.

    Poulson was arrested in 1988 on lesser, but related, hacking charges.  He
disappeared before he was indicted and was re-arrested in Los Angeles is April
1991.  Under an amended indictment, he was charged will illegal possession of
classified documents.

    The CRTC has ordered Bell and other telephone companies under its
jurisdiction to offer free per-call blocking with Call Management Service
(CMS).

    The companies have been asked to file proposed tariffs by June 1.

    Implementation dates have not yet been determined.

    The CRTC's May 4th decision refines the orginal decision made in 1990 that
allowed CMS to be offered with a $0.75 operator-assisted blocking option.

    Bell and other companies under the CRTC's jurisdiction, have until June 1
to file trafiffs and an action plan for the following:

    o    Automated free per-call blocking to customers who request it in all
         CMS area served by DMS technology (customers will have to dial a code
         before placing a call)

    o    Free per-line blocking in those CMS areas served by old technology
         (until they switch to DMS technology)

    o    Free pre-line blocking for shelters of victims for domestic violence,
         (Please note that shelters are already exempt from the $0.75 charge).
         This decision simply eliminates the intermediary when placing the
         free call

    o    Call Trace "on demand".  This would allow customers request their line
         be enabled with the service.  (Call Trace is a monthly subsciption
         service.  If it were offered on demand, customers would pay for the
         service only when they used it.  A fee for Call Trace "on demand" will
         be proposed in the trafiff filing of June 1.

    Bell is presently assessing the implications of the CRTC's decision.


         AT&T Begins Direct-Dial Service To 15 Former Soviet Republics,
                   With More Circuits Than Any Other Company
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Businesswire May 19, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AT&T Tuesday began direct-dial service to all 11
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, previously republics of the
Soviet Union, and to the states of Georgia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

    This will make it easy and economical for Americans - consumers and
business people alike - to reach the largest land-mass in the world, which
spans 11 time zones.

    With more than 400 circuits, AT&T has by far the largest direct-dialing
capacity of any long-distance carrier now serving the region.  Americans can
make direct-dialed calls to all of the more than 2000 cities in this vast area.

    Callers who wish to reach the 15 states served by AT&T direct-dial
long-distance service should dial 011, then 7, then a city or region code, and
the local number.  Rates can be as low as $1.55 per minute, depending on the
time of day a call is made.

    AT&T provides service through a combination of cable, Intelsat, and
Intersputnik satellites, and other countries' facilities.  This diversity of
call-routing helps ensure reliability of long-distance calling, AT&T said.

    The 11 members of the Commonwealth of Independent States are: Russia;
Ukraine; Byelorussia; Moldova; Uzbekistan; Kazakhstan; Kyrgystan; Tajikistan;
Turkmenistan; Azerbaijan; and Armenia.

    AT&T was the first long-distance company to provide direct-dial service to
frequently called areas in the old Soviet Union.  The company began direct-dial
service to Moscow in 1984 and Armenia in 1991.  In addition, AT&T became, in
1991, the only provider of direct-dial service to Sovintel, which operates a
network linking hotels and business centers in Moscow.

  Provision of direct-dial service is the latest example of AT&T's nearly
50-year commitment to this region.  The company installed its first circuits
to the Soviet Union in 1943.

    Between 1978 and 1985, the year Mikhail Gorbachev took office, AT&T
long-distance traffic between the United States and the Soviet Union increased
280 percent.  Between 1985 and 1991, the increase was nearly a thousand
percent.

    In addition, AT&T has formed important alliances to help bring the region's
communications infrastructure into the 21st century.  These include a joint
venture in Ukraine that will build, operate, and own a long-distance network
there, and a joint venture with Dalnya Sviaz (DALS), the Russian
telecommunications company, to market, sell and service telecommunications
equipment.

    Other initiatives include an agreement with the Moscow Local Telephone
Network to distribute AT&T's Spirit (r) small business communications system in
Moscow, and one to provide the Kazakhstan Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications with ATT's 5ESS switches during the next 10 years to help
the state increase the size of its telecommunications network.

    AT&T provides long-distance service to more than 250 countries worldwide,
with direct-dialing to more than 190.

                AT&T Network Systems Unveils 5ESS(a)-2000 Switch
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Businesswire June 09, 1992 ]

    CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AT&T Network Systems Tuesday announced plans for
the next generation digital switching platform that will continue the evolution
of the highly successful 5ESS central office switch.

    As the heart of AT&T's Service Net-2000 family of products, the 5ESS-2000
platform will enable telephone companies to upgrade network infrastructure and
develop the advanced services they want to offer in the 90s, while taking full
advantage of existing network equipment.

    Plans for the 5ESS-2000 Switch include a new SONET-compatible switching
module that can grow to 30 times the network capacity of today's technology,
and software that will continue to improve the reliability and cost performance
of the 5ESS Switch.

    ``Distributed intelligence has always been the hallmark of the 5ESS
Switch,'' said Joseph S.  Colson Jr., AT&T Network Systems vice president -
Switching Systems, U.S.  ``In 10 years of rapid, real-world change, this design
has proven its value time and again, by allowing us to transform the 5ESS
Switch and to keep pace with customers' changing requirements,'' he said.

    ``And in the process, we have continuously improved its quality and
reliability.''

    Any existing 5ESS Switch can be upgraded to the 5ESS-2000 platform with the
simple software and hardware additions normally associated with growth and
retrofits.  ``Customers can make the changeover incrementally, when they're
ready,'' said Colson.

    ``The concept behind the 5ESS-2000 Switch is to ensure that our customers
get the competitive edge and operational efficiencies they need to keep their
business healthy,'' said Colson.

    Highlighting the evolution to the 5ESS-2000 platform will be a new
switching module, the SM-2000, with a growable switching fabric up to 30 times
the capacity of current technology.  The SM-2000 processor will handle well
over 10 times the number of calls as today's module.

    The SM-2000 will not immediately replace switching modules already in
service.  Instead, the SM-2000 works alongside existing modules within a single
5ESS Switch.  AT&T will continue to fully support all 5ESS switching modules.

    ``We plan for today's switching modules to continue to serve as reliable
network workhorses in the 5ESS-2000 platform for years to come,'' said Colson.

    ``That's just one example of how our Service Net-2000 evolution protects a
customer's investment while enabling growth.''

    The SM-2000 will feature a SONET-compatible trunk interface, the Digital
Networking Unit - SONET, initially with an STS-le interface.  The DNU-S,
coupled with the SM-2000 switching fabric, will provide a platform for a
variety of creative network options for telephone companies looking at new
services at wideband speeds.

    AT&T plans to begin deploying the SM-2000 switching module in 1994.

    AT&T also announced plans to introduce 5E9 Software for the 5ESS Switch,
which will begin the transition to the 5ESS-2000 platform.

    ``With the 5E9(1) software, the 5ESS Switch will handle wideband data
switching on the ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI) with fractional DS1
capabilities,'' said Colson.  ``Telephone customers will be able to order any
number of DS0 channels to take advantage of Nx64Kbps applications -- especially
video -- as they emerge.''

    The 5E9(1) release, which is scheduled for first office application in late
1993, will include the capabilities of National ISDN-2, as previously
announced.

    Other features to be added to the 5ESS Switch through 5E9(1) Software
include support for the Bellcore-specified National Intelligent Network-1 (IN1)
standards, expanded Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) capabilities and more
economical operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning (OA&MP).

    In 1994, AT&T plans to deliver 5E9(2), which will further enhance the
5ESS-2000 platform.  The 5E9(2) software will offer customers a new, optional
inter-processor message fabric for SM-2000s, the Quad Link Packet Switch
(QLPS).  This improvement to the 5ESS Switch architecture will enable the
switch to increase its capacity to 1 million ``POTS'' calls.

    ``The most exciting news about QLPS is the high capacity message network it
will enable telephone companies to implement,'' said Colson.  ``The QLPS
message network will be able to grow right along with the increasingly
message-oriented services telephone companies will be developing for advanced
intelligent networking.''

    This spring marked the 10th anniversary of the installation of the first
5ESS Switch, which was placed in service in Seneca, Ill., on March 25, 1982.

    Since then, 5ESS Switches have been delivered to over 2,000 host sites
around the world and serve over 47 million subscriber lines.  5ESS Switches
operate applications ranging from local/toll switching to international
gateways, and private network hubs to operator services systems and ACDs.

    ``Our first decade of real-world applications has proven the 5ESS Switch's
consistent superiority as the best platform for changing technology and
customer needs,'' said Colson.

    ``Ten years ago, services such as voice and data, switched and
non-switched, public and private were seen as unalterably separate in the
digital public switching arena,'' he said.  ``Today, our 5ESS Switch
architecture, through the focus of Service Net-2000, is leading the way towards
the increasing bandwidth and call capacity that will facilitate the integration
of formerly separate services into the same network.

    ``In another decade, we'll be looking at the migration of intelligence from
within the switching architecture to various locations within the network,
based on customer needs,'' said Colson.  ``And we fully expect the 5ESS Switch
to still be operating at the ce nter of it all.''

      NCR Installs Automated Teller Machines Aboard U.S. 100th Naval Ship
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Businesswire June 03, 1992 ]

    WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 3, 1992--NCR Corporation announced today
that it has installed NCR automated teller machines (ATM) aboard 100 U.S.
naval ships as part of a multi-year program called ``ATMs At Sea.'' The most
recent addition to the naval fleet, the U.S.S.  George Washington aircraft
carrier based in Norfolk, Va., will be equipped with 8 NCR ATMs.

    The company was selected over several others when the Navy requested
prototypes for a pilot test in 1985.  Lowered by huge cranes through torpedo
loading hatches, the ATMs are installed with special shock mounts and brackets
to protect the computer equipment from the pitch and roll of the ship.

    Through standard ATM cards and personal identification numbers, the system
allows crew members to withdraw money from their paychecks, which are
automatically deposited twice each month.

    ``The program represents a complete departure from the Navy's previous
payroll disbursement plan,'' said Roger Lintern, vice president of NCR's
Federal Systems Division.  ``Sailors now have the ability to withdraw a portion
of a paycheck without standing in lines for hours.''

    Unlike common ATM machines, the on-board models will not be linked to banks
or credit unions and will be used only to disburse pay.  However, the Navy is
considering adding a split-pay option, which would allow sailors to have part
of their check directly deposited into a bank account and part of it
transferred to the ship's ATM.

    The installation also signifies an extension of the $13.5 million contract
awarded by the U.S.  Navy in 1988.  The original agreement called for
installation of ATMs aboard 118 ships, but was recently extended to 148 due to
the popularity of the units.

    ``As the program matured, the Navy began realizing the benefits of the ATMs
in terms of security.  And it requires very little time to maintain the system,
allowing crew members to concentrate on other duties,'' said Lintern.

    Each ship is equipped with from 2 to 8 NCR 5070 Interior ATMs, an NCR TOWER
32/400 and peripherals.  ``This self-contained system is accessible 24 hours a
day and helps the Navy increase productivity and improve customer service while
controlling costs,'' said Lintern.

    NCR is initially installing the technology on larger ships, such as
aircraft carriers, or those with 250 or more sailors.  NCR systems analysts
continue to perform all training and installation services necessary to use and
maintain the system.

    NCR, the Networked Computing Resource of AT&T, develops, markets, supports
and services enterprise-wide information systems for worldwide markets.

                [ Courtesy of Daily Telegraph October 2, 1992 ]

    A computer specialist who threatened to put a virus in a program of a
client company in an argument over a phone bill was fined 500 pounds and
ordered to pay 500 pounds costs yesterday.  A jury at Newcastle upon Type Crown
Court took more than six hours to reach a 10-2 majority verdict in the case of
Dr.Roy Booth, who had denied blackmail.

    The computer studies lecturer from Fieldhouse Road, Gateshead, Tyne and
Wear [in NE England], said after the hearing that his job at Newcestle
University was now in jeopardy.  Dr.  Booth had threatened to insert a virus
into a computer game of Imec, a firm for which he had worked, when it refused
to pay a 400 pound telephone bill he ran up while on a one week stay in
America.

    Instead it was deducted from his fee.  The lecturer said he had expected to
be paid 900 pounds.  The firm agreed to pay him 450 pounds which, with the
telephone bill deducted, left him with just 50 pounds.

    He said he had threatened to insert a computer virus in an attempt to
"shake up" the company and encourage it to pay him in full.  He had no
intention of damaging to the program.  Judge Michael Cartlidge, sentencing him
accepted that the lecturer was only trying to get back money which he felt was
due to him.  But, he added: "You employed illegal methods to do it and you
should be thoroughly ashamed of what you did."

long-distance calls out of state and to points east of Rialto.  Customers were
also unable to receive calls from out of state or east of Rialto.

    Although the incident immediately impacted the Palm Springs, Calif.  area,
GTE received subsequent trouble reports about MCI long- distance service from
customers in the Inland Empire.  The event did not affect local calling.

    The company said the cable cut occurred when an unidentified person
accidentally cut a major MCI fiber-optic cable, reportedly near Rialto.

    A spokesman for GTE said service was restored at about 5:15 p.m.
yesterday.


              Cincinnati Bell Telephone To Offer Caller ID Service
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                [ Courtesy of Erie Daily Times, August 7, 1992 ]

    COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. apparently will be the
first telephone company in Ohio to offer Caller ID service, which allows
customers to view the numbers of calling parties.

    The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved Cincinnati Bell's
application Thursday.

    The commission also granted the company's request to offer several related
service, including a costfree option that allows a caller to prevent his or her
telephone number from being displayed to the called party.

    Caller ID would cost $6.40 a month for a residential customer while
businesses would have to pay $8.50.

    Craig Glazer, PUCO chairman, said the decision includes a stipulation that
telemarketing firms, often criticized for slaes solicitations at late or
inconvenient hours, may not shield their numbers.

    "The commission took special steps to protect customers from telemarkets by
denying them blocking services," he said.

    The decision also protects the privacy needs of police, domestic violence
centers and other that have strategic, safety or other legitimate reasons for
not wanting numbers disclosed.

    Various police and domestic violations, along with the Ohio Office od the
Consumers' Counsel opposed Caller ID initially.  At the time, the plan had no
provision for call blocking.

    Beth Gianforcaro, spokeswoman for OCC, said the package approved for
CIncinnati Bell addresses that concern.

    "It appears they recognized the consumer protection we wanted," she said.

    Thursday's decision requires Cincinnati Bell to educate its customers
regarding the privacy options at least 60 days before offering the new services
to regular customers and 90 days before offering them to subscribers with
unlisted numbers.

    The commission also required the company to provide quarterly reports to
the PUCO for a year for an evaluation of the new services in terms of
effectivesness and benefits to the public.

    Other services authorized by the decision include call blocking.  It allows
the customer to divert calls from up to six numbers, placed on a screening
list, to a recorded announcement.


                    Bell Canada's Internal Networking Centre
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               [ Courtesy of Graduate Computer World Fall, 1992 ]

    The network is controlled and managed by two command centres - once in
Toronto, Ontario, and one in Dorval, Quebec.  Each command centre manages the
various locations and internal communications within its respective province.

    "In total, there are 30,000 people who have some kind of connectivity to
the network," said Louise Roberge, Bell's director of network operations.

    Roberge says the network has evolved significantly from the says when it
was primarily terminals accessing mainframes.

    "The first step in the evolution was putting all the controllers on a MUX
(multiplexer) and linking our major sites to the data centre," said Ritch
Lodge, a technical manager at Bell.

    "Like many large companies, we use a private T1 (dedicated to Bell Canada's
data communication) megaroute facilities.  Once you have a certain amount of
traffic it pays to have dedicated facilites," says Lodge.

    He cautions that a distinction has to be made between public facilities
and dedicated (private) facilites such as Bell's internal network.

    "It's kind of an internal affair." Lodge continues.  "We in data operations
have to ask phone operations to install a dedicated T1 for our own internal
use.  So in a way, we become our own client when we get a T1 link between
Montreal and Toronto, or even between here and downtown."

    The T1 (1.544 Mbps) network allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms
of growth, says Lodge.

    "A link might not be busy right now, but when you add components that we're
planning to add, the flow of traffic will increase significantly.  For example,
there isn't much traffic between here and Barrie right now, but we're putting
in Huntsville, which is going to go through Barrie to get to Huntsville," he
said.

    "We build highways between systems," adds Roberge.  "We're building the
highways and keeping the highways clean and humming.  And when they get
congested, we add to them; we widen them or whatever.

    Bell's internal network consists of two different backbone networks.  The
first is token-ring/SNA which, according to Lodge, is in the mainframe world of
Big Blue and Amdahl.  This network supports large corporate applications such
as big orders, and electronic mail (there are at least 20,000 employees using
Bell's internal electronic office services).

    The company's other network technology is Ethernet which functions
primarily for operational support systems (OSS).  These are systems that help
the internal functions of Bell Canada run smoothly.  For example, Bell has a
system, called the Mechanized Frame Administration System, which tells its
technicians exactly where to run cable pairs.  Interoperability between these
networks is provided by routers which allows hosts on either technology to
communicate using common protocols such as OSI or TCP/IP.

    "Each of these systems, or individual applications, on the Ethernet runs on
a dedicated minicomputer base such as the VAX 8000 and 9000," Lodge said.  "We
distribute the minicomputers a little bit closer to the client community using
those hosts.  They're administered by their own client groups, however.  THe
people who are managing those systems are our clients."

    With such a large network, it's not suprising that the company has a large
group to make sure the internal networks keep humming smoothly.  The Bell
network operations group is about 160 strong and falls under the auspices of
systems operations.  In addition to network operations, this group also
consists of computer operations and client services.

    The computer operations group has been pared down significantly in recnet
years, according to Lodge.

    "We've done a lot of what we call automated operations (auto ops), which
means we use systems to run systems," he explains.  "So a problem will be not
detected by an operator, but by auto ops.  It will detect a problem and even
try to take some corrective action.  Only as a final recourse will you need
human intervention.  It will monitor things like memory utilization - any
hardware problems."

    There is also a section called Help Desk, which can be used by anyone who
encounters problems when trying to use the internal network to access the
mainframes in the data centre or any OSS.  Once they determine the nature of
the problem, the Help Desk staff can fix it through software commands or, if
need be, by dispatching someone to fix it.

    "If the Help Desk can't help, a trouble ticket will be logged which is then
channeled to technical groups for action.

    "We have pro-active trouble monitoring," Lodge says.  "They'll see the link
between Ottawa and Toronto go down and be able to tell before a client calls
and says, "I just lost the connection to my computer."  They'll be able to tell
the client: "We've lost the T1 and we're working on it."

    "It's the network that's the problem we can help with.  This is providing
you with a pipe.  Once you get in on this side, we want you to get to the far
side with the right data.  If you're not getting to the far side, we use these
tools to find out why not.  Is it the T1 that's bad?  Is it the concentrator?
Is it the bridge or end node that's bad?  It's just standard troubleshooting
techniques -- following the trouble from point A to point B."


               Federal Agents Raid Dorm, Seize Computer Equipment
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              [ Courtesy of Houston Chronicle December 17, 1992 ]

    The Secret Service has raided a dorm room at Texas Tech University, seizing
the computers of two Houston-area students who allegedly used an international
computer network to steal computer software.

    Agents refused to release the names of the two area men and a third from
Austin, who were not arrested in the late-morning raid Monday at the university
in Lubbock.  Their cases will be presented to a grand jury in January.

    They are expected to be charged with computer crime, interstate transport
of stolen property and copyright infringement.

    "The university detected it," said Resident Agent R.  David Freriks of the
Secret Service office in Dallas, which handled the case.  He said that Texas
Tech computer system operators contacted the Secret Service when personal
credit information was found mixed with the software mysteriously filling up
their fixed-disk data storage devices.

    The raid is the first to fall under a much broader felony definition of
computer software piracy that could affect many Americans.  This October
revision to the copyright law was hotly debated by computer experts, who
contended that it sets the felony threshold far too low.

    Agents allege that the three used a chat system hosted on the Internet
computer network, which connects up to 15 million people in more than 40
nations, to make contacts with whom they could trade pirated software.  The
software was transferred over the network, into Texas Tech's computers, and
eventually into their personal computers.  The Secret Service seized those
three personal computers and associated peripherals which an agent valued at
roughly $5,000.

    The software Publishers Association, a software industry group chartered to
fight piracy, contends that the industry lost $1.2 billion in sales in 1991 to
pirates.

    Although these figures are widely questioned for their accuracy, piracy is
widespread among Houston's 450-plus computer bulletin boards, and even more so
on the global Internet.

    "There are a lot of underground sites on the Internet run by university
system administrators, and they have tons of pirated software available to
download -- gigabytes of software," said Scott Chasin, a former computer hacker
who is now a computer security consultant.  "There's no way that one agency or
authority can go through and try to sweep all the bad software off the
Internet, because the Internet's too big."

    The mission of the Secret Service does not normally include the pursuit of
software piracy, but rather the use of "electronic access devices" such as
passwords in the commission of a crime.  This gives the service purview over
many computer and telecommunications crimes, which often go hand-in-hand, with
occasional bleedover into other areas.

    Freriks said that the investigation falls under a revision of the copyright
laws that allows felony charges to be brought against anyone who trades more
than 10 pieces of copyrighted software -- a threshold that would cover many
millions of Americans who may trade copies of computer programs with their
friends.

    "The ink is barely dry on the amendment, and you've already got law
enforcement in there, guns blazing, because somebody's got a dozen copies of
stolen software," said Marc Rotenberg, director of Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, in Washington, D.C.  "That was a bad provision when it
was passed, and was considered bad for precisely this reason, giving a
justification for over-reaching by law enforcement."

    Freriks noted that the raid also involved one of the first uses of an
expanded right to use forfeiture against computer crime, although he was unable
to state from where this authority evolved after a civil rights lawyer
questioned his assertion that it was contained in the copyright law revision.

    "One of our complaints has always been that you catch 'em, slap 'em on the
wrist, and then hand back the smoking gun," he said.  "Now all that equipment
belongs to the government."

    AT&T is giving businesses a new way to fight telephone fraud and abuse.
The long-distance carrier is offering a calling card that allows corporate
customers to preselect specific phone numbers, area codes, or countries that
can be called by the card's user.  Non-designated calling areas cannot be
accessed.  The card, which allows managers to designate up to 50 possible
calling combinations, will be available for free this year.  Beginning next
year, AT&T will charge a service fee for the card.

 The US Attorney's Office in Sacramento, California has announced an
 indictment against a Fresno department store for using a 'special
 computer program' to alter its financial records. The store,
 Gottschalks, has pled guilty to three criminal counts and has agreed
 to pay 1.5 million dollars in fines for taking illegal tax deductions
 and violating securities exchange laws. The store reportedly
 developed the program to overstate sales, supposedly by nearly half a
 million dollars in one quarter, allowing it to claim a profit when it
 was really operating at a loss.


                      Telcoms Ruling Sparks Legal Protest
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The June 12 ruling of the Canadian Radio-telecision and Telecommunications
Commission (the CRTC) opening up the long-distance telephone service market has
touched off a flurry of action.

    Bell Canada and its allies have begun fighting the decision, Telecom
Decision CRTC 92-12.

    Stentor Telecom Policy Inc., the national government relations arm of
Canada's major telephone companies (telcos), is considering a petition to the
Federal Cabinet.

    Meanwhile, Bell Canada has filed an application with the Federal Court of
Appeal for leave to appeal the CRTC decision.

    And it has called for a freeze on parts of the decision.

    "While the Court can rule on the proper legal principles to be applied,
Cabinet could take into account broader policy implications such as the harm
caused to Canada's competitiveness by the impositiion of substantial additional
costs," Bell Canada said in a press release.

    At press time, there were reports that another respondent in the hearings
leading to the decision, British Columbia Telephone Co (BC Tel), planned to
file a similar application to the Federal Court.

    Canada's largest union of telephone employees, the Communications and
Electrical Workers Of Canada, has also announced plans to file an appeal with
the Federal Cabinet against the decision.

    Its president, Fred Pomeroy, has blasted the CRTC ruling as "ireesponsible
in the extreme."

    The union also plans to approach the Telecommunications Workers Union,
which represents employees at BC Tel., and the Atlantic Communications Workers
Union in Nova Scotia for their support.

    These actions are the latest moves by the telcos to prevent the opening up
of the long-distance telephone market.

    In the nearly one year that the CRTC was deliberating the evidence
presented to it on this issue, the telcos had stepped up their battle.

    They has announced rate cuts frequently - to the point where CRTC Chairman
Keith Spicer said, in announcing the ruling, that the mere threat of
competition had forced the telcos to reduce their rates.

    At the end of April, Bell Canada chairman and CEO Jean Monty warned
employees that a decision unfavourable to Bell Could lead to layoffs such as
those which the US telephone companies suffered after the 1984 court-ordered
breakup of AT&T.

    And Raymond Sy Cyr, chairman of Bell Canada's parent company, Montreal,
Quebec based BCE Inc., warned that competition in long-distance phone service
could lead to the doubling of local residential rates, to $25 a month.

    According to him, Bell Canada loses $1.6 billion a year on local services
but this is offset by revenues from long-distance calls.

    "For every $100 miilion (of long-distance revenue), we make $66 million
profit," he was quoted as saying to the press.  "If we eventually lost $1
billion a year to Unitel, the (local) rates would have to go up by $666
million.  "Prior to that, executives from several telephone companies (telcos)
had publicly blamed the CRTC for unduly restricitng them and for delaying
long-sought price cuts.

    But the fur really began to fly after June 12.

    Prior to announcing its decision to appeal the decision, Bell Canada began
taking out a series of advertisements in the media slamming the decision but
saying it agrees to competition.

    "Competition in long distance should favour consumers.  Not competitors",
says it ads, which also claim that Bell is being hard done by because it has to
bear most of the costs for modifying its network to allow competitors access.

    Unitel's response, which has tickled some users pink, has been a series of
ads showing a baby in a bonnet wailing and pointing to another playing with a
telephone.  The headline reads, "It's tough when you've been an only child for
all these years."

    Both sides are taking this latest battle seriously, preparing their cases.

    Bell would do well to remember, however, that the hearings saw what
amounted to a nation-wide user revolt, with both business and residential users
testifying in drives about the benefits of competition in the long-distance
phone market.


                   Unbreakable Network Security From Canadian Firm
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                [ Courtesy of Network World July/August, 1992 ]

    An inexpensive hardware product claimed to provide unbeatable computer
network communications security has been announced by Belleville, Ont. - based
Quince Network Confidentiality Equipment Inc.

    This is SecurCom, a device which encypts and decrypts traffic to and from a
computer.

    It plugs into your computer's network port, and does not require changes to
you software or hardware.

    SecurCom's coding system is based on the principle of the "one time" pad.

    Here is how this works: the sender and receiver of a message each has the
electronic equivalent of a writing pad.

    On each sheet of this pad are four billion numbers printed at random, each
consisting of several digits to a particular order.  These numbers are the
keys.

    The keys are used to encode and decode your transmission.

    Once a page has been used, it is tron off and discarded.  Or, in electronic
terms, wiped.

    The pages are generated every seven seconds by SecurCom.

    The keys are taken from a universe of 18.5 thousand billion stored on a
chipset built around a digital gate array and analog ASICS (application
specific integrated circuits).

    Each of these 18.5 thousand billion keys is equally probable.  What this
means is that each of them has an equal chance of being selected.

    This ensures that the selection of the four billion keys is fully random.
Statistically, the same key can reappear every 1,000 years with a probability
of one in four billion.

    This security is of a very high level; the catch is that both the sender
and receiver must use the same page.

    SecurCom solves this problem by ensuring that, every seven seconds, a new
key is simultaneously adopted by all the SecurCom systems on the network.
Computers joining the network have these seven seconds to synchronize to the
correct encryption key.

    Synchronization involves the transmission of synchronizing data, which
allows all the SecurComs on the network to calculate the correct key being used
at the time.

    "It does not involve transmitting the key on the network," said Gregg A
MacNaughton, marketing product manager at Quince.

    "If someone were to access the network, they would not be able to see the
key."

    The domain concept is used - users in a particular department can build a
domain of their own consisting of computers in that department.  SecurCom lets
corporations build multiple domains.

    Internal communications between computers in each domain are fully free,
but communications with the outside can only be made through a defined
intercommunications guard device.

    The guard device, a modified SecurCom device, allows or disallows
communications between different domains based on various criteria set by the
security manager, such as the address of a  PC, on the network.

    THe use of the domain concept helps limit the spread of a computer virus on
a network because the infection will be contained within the afected domain.

    "If data on an infected application is encryted, it can only be received by
a computer which can accept that encrypted information," MacNaughton said.

    "So a virus on a non-encrypted form will not be able to pass through a
domain."

    He added that this makes eradication of a virus easier.  "Instead of having
to look at the whole network, you just have to find out which computers are in
the infected domain and which ones can communicate with that domain."

    Other features of SecurCom:

    o    You can run protected and unprotected PCs on the same network;

    o    Fault tolerance - a failed device does not send messages unencrypted;

    o    Encryption is automatic and cannot be bypassed;

    o    Tamper-resistance circuitry is used;

    o    Encrypts at full LAN bandwidth;

    o    Claimed to have no impact on performanace under normal operating
         conditions;

    o    Software, hardware and protocol independent; and

    o    Initiated on power-up.

    Alpha testing of the SecurCom device has been completed, and beta testing
will begin this month (July).

    Beta test sites will be key banks in the UK, US and Switzerland.

    The first SecurCom devices, for Ethernet local area networks (LANs), will
be available in Q4; Token-Rink versions will be rolled out in Q1, 1993, and an
intercommunications guard, which is the modified SecurCom, will be out by the
end of this year.

    The Ethernet products will be listed at less than $750 retail, MacNaughton
said.

    NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 MAR 11 (NB) -- AT&T will take-on the
TeleConnect joint venture and British Telecom's Synovus group as a manager of
international computer networks.  J.P.  Morgan, the New York investment bank
founded in the 19th century, will be among its first customers.

    Under the three-year Morgan contract, AT&T will install and manage a
high-speed network that connects the bank's existing local computer networks on
four continents.  The value of the contract is about $8 million, AT&T said.
Many of the services are being provided by Istel, a British company owned by
AT&T.  AT&T acknowledged that British Telecom signed a deal in January to
manage another of Morgan's networks.

    AT&T said its managed network services in Europe offer data networking
capability and include value-added services such as network design,
provisioning, consolidated billing and network management.

    The services can link different communications standards and regulations,
equipment and systems from more than one vendor.  The services also offer
multiple-vendor billing, and also address cultural, language and time-zone
problems.  They are based on enhanced versions of AT&T's Accunet data service,
now available between 7 Western European countries and due to be expanded
elsewhere in Europe, as well as AT&T's Accumaster Management Services.  AT&T
said it will also set up a global network management center in the Netherlands
by the end of 1992.

                    [ Courtesy of Newsbytes July 22, 1992 ]

    ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1992 JULY 22 (NB) -- Proving it is possible to
make good profits with a regulated utility, BellSouth reported that its
earnings rose 25 percent for the quarter ending in June, the best performance
among the regional Bell companies.

    The company posted profits of $458.5 million, up from $365.3 million a year
ago, and Chairman John L.  Clendenin gave credit to a strong performance in its
basic telephone network.  The Southeastern economy has grown faster than the
rest of the country, but BellSouth remains under rate-of-return regulation in
most states, and has only now begun pressing hard for price caps.  The
company's cellular phone business also showed gains.
    Elsewhere GTE, whose local networks are larger than any of the regional
Bells, but more dispersed around the country, said its quarterly earnings rose
13.2 percent, to $446 million, for the quarter.  This came despite what
Chairman Charles Lee called a "soft economy." GTE is now the second-largest
cellular operator in the US.

    US West, which serves the mountain states, saw a profit rise of just 12
percent, to $309.5 million.  The states it serves have been hurt by the
nationwide recession, which has depressed prices of basic commodities.  The
company's revenues were flat compared to a year ago, but Chairman Richard
McCormick called the performance "a solid quarter."

    In other news involving US West, the company extended its Minitel services
through a deal with Tribune Publishing of Idaho.  That company will offer
electronic access to its four western Washington newspapers over US West's
Community Link service in Seattle.  US West called this deal the first between
a newspaper vendor and a regional Bell company, but in fact BellSouth and the
Atlanta Newspapers also had a brief joint-venture, from which the newspaper
broke away.  The company's press statement noted that Community Link in Seattle
is still in the test-market stage.


             British Telecom Helps Banks Combat Plastic Card Fraud
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    [ Courtesy of Newsbytes July 22, 1992 ]

    LONDON, ENGLAND, 1992 JUL 22 (NB) -- Barclays and Natwest Bank, two of the
UK's "Big Five" banks, have teamed up with British Telecom (BT) to cut the cost
of plastic card fraud, which last year cost the banks a total of UKP 65
million.

    With immediate effect, BT has cut pricing on its Global Network Services
(GNS) Cardway technology, an online system that allow plastic card transactions
to be validated in real time.  Cardway units using the new charging system
should be in use during the fall of this year.

    GNS Cardway works with an electronic funds transfer at point of sale
(EFTPOS) unit sitting in the retailer's premises in place of the usual offline
computer EFTPOS terminal.  Every time a transaction is processed through the
terminal, a call is placed over a quick-connect toll-free telephone line and
the transaction given the go/no-go signal.

    The introduction of a new charging system for GNS Cardway, especially the
use of a toll-free phone number, allows BT to set a flat-rate charging system
for the service, without the unknown costs associated with a per-transaction
phone call system.  BT expects a lot of merchants will take the new GNS Cardway
option through their bank -- the telecom giant is planning to install around
40,000 terminals next year alone.

    Announcing the low-cost GNS Cardway scheme, Peter Cook, BT GNS' product and
marketing manager, said that the Cardway link will ensure a faster turnaround
of data, which will benefit both retailers and their customers.

    "It will, of course, help reduce the incidence of fraud and its resulting
costs which are inevitably passed on to the shopping public," he said.

                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes November 3, 1992 ]

    GREENBURGH, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 NOV 3 (NB) -- The Greenburgh, New York
Police Department has announced the arrest of three individuals, Randy P.
Sigman, 40; Ronald G.  Pinz, Jr, 21; and Byron J.  Woodard, 18 for the alleged
crimes of Unauthorized Use Of A computer and Attempted Computer Trespass, both
misdemeanors.  Also arrested was Jason A.  Britain, 22 in satisfaction of a
State of Arizona Fugitive From Justice warrant.

    The arrests took place in the midst of an "OctoberCon" or "PumpCon" party
billed as a "hacker get-together" at the Marriott Courtyard Hotel in
Greenburgh.  .  The arrests were made at approximately 4:00 AM on Sunday
morning, November 1st.  The three defendants arrested for computer crimes were
granted $1,000 bail and will be arraigned on Friday, November 6th.

    Newsbytes sources said that the get together, which had attracted up to
sixty people, had dwindled to approximately twenty-five when, at 10:00 Saturday
night, the police, in response to noise complaints arrived and allegedly found
computers in use accessing systems over telephone lines.  The police held the
twenty-five for questioning and called in Westchester County Assistant District
Attorney Kenneth Citarella, a prosecutor versed in computer crime, for
assistance.  During the questioning period, the information on Britain as a
fugitive from Arizona was obtained and at 4:00 the three alleged criminal
trespassers and Britain were charged.

    Both Lt.  DeCarlo of the Greenburgh police and Citarella told Newsbytes
that the investigation is continuing and that no further information is
available at this time.

               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                  [ Courtesy of Newsbytes November 11, 1992 ]

    WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 NOV 11 (NB) -- In the on-going investigation
of possible Secret Service involvement in the Friday, November 6th ejection of
attendees at a "2600 meeting" from the premises of the Pentagon City Mall,
diametrically opposed statements have come from the same source.

    Al Johnson, chief of security for the Pentagon City Mall told Newsbytes on
Monday, November 9th "No one said that we were acting on behalf of the Secret
Service.  We were merely enforcing our regulations.  While the group was not
disruptive, it had pulled tables together and was having a meeting in our food
court area.  The food court is for people eating and is not for meetings.  We
therefore asked the people to leave."

    On the same day, Johnson was quoted was quoted in a Communications Daily
article by Brock Meeks as saying "As far as I'm concerned, we're out of this.
The Secret Service, the FBI, they're the ones that ramrodded this whole thing."

    Newsbytes contacted Meeks to discuss the discrepancies in the stories and
were informed that the conversation with Johnson had been taped and was
available for review.  The Newsbytes reporter listened to the tape (and
reviewed a transcript).  On the tape, Johnson was clearly heard to make the
statement quoted by Meeks.

    He also said "maybe you outta call the Secret Service, they're handling
this whole thing.  We, we were just here", and, in response to a Meeks question
about a Secret Service contact, "Ah..  you know, I don't have a contact person.
These people were working on their own, undercover, we never got any names, but
they definitely, we saw identification, they were here."

    Newsbytes contacted Johnson again on the morning of Wednesday, November 11
and asked him once again whether there was any Secret Service involvement in
the action.  Johnson said "No, I told you that they were not involved." When it
was mentioned that there was a story in Communications Daily, quoting him to
the contrary, Johnson said "I never told Meeks that.  There was no Secret
Service involvement"

    Informed of the possible existence of a tape quoting him to the contrary.
Johnson said "Meeks taped me?  He can't do that.  I'll show him that I'm not
fooling around.  I'll have him arrested."

    Johnson also said "He asked me if the Secret Service was involved; I just
told him that, if he thought they were, he should call them and ask them."

    Then Johnson again told Newsbytes that the incident was "just a mall
problem. There were too many people congregating."

    [NOTE: Newsbytes stands by its accurate reporting of Johnson's statements.
It also affirms that the story by Meeks accurately reflects the material taped
during his interview]

    In a related matter, Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of
Computer Professionals For Social Responsibility (CPSR) has announced that CPSR
has filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the Secret Service
asking for information concerning Secret Service involvement in the incident.

    Rotenberg told Newsbytes that the Secret Service has 10 days to respond to
the request.  He also said that CPSR "is exploring other legal options in this
matter."

    The Secret Service, in earlier conversations with Newsbytes, has denied
that the mall security was working on its behalf.

    In the incident itself, a group attending the informal meeting was
disbanded and, according to attendees, had property confiscated.  They also
contend that security guards took film from someone photographing the
confiscation as well as a list that someone was making of the guard's names.
In his November 9th conversation with Newsbytes, Johnson denied that security
personnel took away any film or lists and further said "We did not confiscate
any material.  The group refused to own up to who owned material on the tables
and in the vicinity so we collected it as lost material.  If it turns out that
anything did belong to any of those people, they are welcome to come in and,
after making proper identification, take the material."

    2600 meetings are promoted by 2600 Magazine: The Hacker Quarterly and are
held on the evening of the first Friday of each month in public places and
malls in New York City, Washington, Philadelphia, Cambridge, St.  Louis,
Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  They are regularly attended by a
variety of persons interested in telecommunications and so-called "hacker
issues".

                Confusion About Secret Service Role D.C. "Raid"
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes November 7, 1992 ]

    WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 NOV 7 (NB) -- In the aftermath of an action
on Friday, November 6th by members of the Pentagon City Mall Police and police
from Arlington County, VA in which those attending a 2600 meeting at the mall
were ordered from the premises, conflicting stories continue to appear.

    Attendees at the meeting have contended to Newsbytes that members of the
mall police told them that they were "acting on behalf of the Secret Service.".
They also maintain that the mall police confiscated material from knapsacks and
took film from someone attempting to photograph the action and a list of the
names of security officers that one attendee was attempting to compile.

    Al Johnson, chief of security for the mall, denied these allegations to
Newsbytes, saying "No one said that we were acting on behalf of the Secret
Service.  We were merely enforcing our regulations.  While the group was not
disruptive, it had pulled tables together and was having a meeting in our food
court area.  The food court is for people eating and is not for meetings.  We
therefore asked the people to leave."

    Johnson denied that security personnel took away any film or lists and
further said "We did not confiscate any material.  The group refused to own up
to who owned material on the tables and in the vicinity so we collected it as
lost material.  If it turns out that anything did belong to any of those
people, they are welcome to come in and, after making proper identification,
take the material."

    In a conversation early on November 9th, Robert Rasor, Secret Service
agent-in-charge of computer crime investigations, told Newsbytes that having
mall security forces represent the Secret Service is not something that was
done and, that to his knowledge, the Secret Service had no involvement with any
Pentagon City mall actions on the previous Friday.

A Newsbytes call to the Arlington County police was returned by a
Detective Nuneville who said that her instructions were to refer all
questions concerning the matter to agent David Adams of the Secret
Service. She told Newsbytes that Adams would be providing all
information concerning the involvement of both the Arlington Police
and the Secret Service in the incident.

    Adams told Newsbytes "The mall police were not acting as agents for the
Secret Service.  Beyond that, I can not confirm or deny that there is an
ongoing investigation."

    Adams also told Newsbytes that "While I cannot speak for the Arlington
police, I understand that their involvement was due to an incident unrelated to
the investigation."

    Marc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR), told Newsbytes "CPSR has reason to believe
that the detention of people at the Pentagon City Mall last Friday was
undertaken at the behest of the Secret Service, which is a federal agency.  If
that is the case, then there was an illegal search of people at the mall.
There was no warrant and no indication of probable illegal activity.  This
raises constitutional issues.  We have undertaken the filing of a Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) request to determine the scope, involvement and purpose
of the Secret Service in this action."

    2600 meetings are held on the evening of the first Friday of each month in
public places and malls in New York City, Washington, Philadelphia, Cambridge,
St.  Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  They are promoted by 2600
Magazine: The Hacker Quarterly and are attended by a variety of persons
interested in telecommunications and so-called "hacker issues".  The New York
meeting, the oldest of its kind, is regularly attended by Eric Corley a/k/a
Emmanuel Goldstein, editor and publisher of 2600, hackers, journalists,
corporate communications professionals and other interested parties.  It is
known to have been the subject of surveillance at various times by law
enforcement agencies conducting investigations into allegations of computer
crime.

    Corley told Newsbytes "While I'm sure that meetings have been observed by
law enforcement agencies, this is the only time that we have been harassed.
It's definitely a freedom of speech issue." Corley also that he plans to be at
the December meeting in Washington "to insure that it doesn't happen again."


          DELPHI Online Service Announces Full Access to the Internet
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              [ Courtesy of Newsbytes December 9, 1992 ]

    Cambridge MA, December 9, 1992 -- DELPHI, an international online service,
today announced full access to the Internet including real-time electronic
mail, file transfers with "FTP," and remote log-ins to other Internet hosts
using "Telnet." With this announcement, DELPHI becomes the only leading
consumer online service to offer such a wide variety of Internet features.

    Russell Williams, DELPHI's general manager, explains the significance of
this announcement.  "Prior to now, anyone interested in accessing the Internet
had a very limited number of options.  In most cases you had to be connected
directly through your company or school.  DELPHI is now an important low-cost
access option available to home computer users.  Anyone can connect to DELPHI
with a local call from over 600 cities and towns throughout the US and in many
other countries."

    The Internet is considered the world's largest computer network.  It is
comprised of thousands of companies, colleges, schools, government agencies,
and other organizations.  There are currently an estimated 4 million users.
"This incredible collection of resources will mean better and more specialized
services for all users" adds Mr.  Williams.  "For example, users can take
electronic courses conducted by leading universities, access databases and
reports from government agencies, and get product information and support
directly from companies.  There are also mailing lists and discussion groups
for almost every special interest imaginable.  Electronic mail can be used to
send private messages to anyone on the Internet and even many commercial
networks like Compuserve and MCI Mail."

    DELPHI's connection to the Internet works both ways: In addition to
offering access out to other networks, DELPHI provides value-added services to
people already on the Internet.  Any user of the Internet can access DELPHI to
use services such as Grolier's Academic American Encyclopedia, the Dictionary
of Cultural Literacy, Reuters and UPI newswires, stock quotes, computer
support, travel reservations, special interest groups, real-time conferencing,
downloadable programs, and multi-player games.  All these services can be
reached through the Internet simply by joining DELPHI and then telnetting to
the address "delphi.com" via the commercial Internet.

    In order to help new users with questions related to the Internet, DELPHI
has an area online to provide support.  The Internet Special Interest Group
(SIG) includes an active message forum where members and staff can exchange
useful information.  Comprehensive guide books, downloadable software, and
information files are also available.

    DELPHI has two membership plans: the 10/4 Plan is $10 per month and
includes the first 4 hours of use; additional use is $4 per hour.  The 20/20
Advantage Plan is $20 per month, includes 20 hours of use, and is only $1.80
per hour for additional time.  The Internet service option is an extra $3 per
month and includes a generous transfer allocation of 10 megabytes (the
equivalent of about 3,000 type-written pages).  Access during business hours
via Sprintnet or Tymnet carries a surcharge.

    Through a special trial membership offer, anyone interested in learning
more about DELPHI and the Internet can receive 5 hours of access for free.  To
join, dial by modem, 1-800-365-4636 (current Internet users should telnet to
"delphi.com" instead).  After connecting, press return once or twice.  At the
Username prompt, enter JOINDELPHI and at the password prompt, type INTERNETSIG.
DELPHI Member Service Representatives can also be reached by voice at
1-800-695-4005.

                Further Disclosures In 911/"Legion of Doom Case"
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes October 20, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 OCT 20(NB) -- In a discussion with
Newsbytes, Sgt.  Kurt Leonard of the Chesterfield County, Virginia Police
Department disclosed further information concerning the on-going investigation
of alleged 911 disruption throughout the eastern seaboard of the United States
by individuals purporting to be members of the hacker group "The Legion of
Doom" (LOD).

    Leonard identified the individual arrested in Newark, New Jersey,
previously referred to only as "Maverick", as Scott Maverick, 23.  Maverick has
been charged with terroristic threats, obstruction of a government function,
and illegal access to a computer.  He is presently out on bail.

    Leonard said that David Pluchino, 22 was charged to the same counts as
Maverick and an additional count of the possession of burglar tools.  Leonard
said that Pluchino, the subject of a 1990 Secret Service "search and seizure"
action under the still on-going "Operation SunDevil" investigation" possessed
information linking him with members of the Legion of Doom.

    The Legion of Doom connection has become the subject of controversy within
the online community.  Although Maverick has been quoted as saying that he is a
member of the group and that that the group's intent was "to attempt to
penetrate the 911 computer systems and inflect them with viruses to cause
havoc", members of the group have disavowed and connection with those arrested.
"Lex Luthor", one of the original members of the group told Newsbytes when the
initial report of the arrests became public "As far as I am concerned the LOD
has been dead for a couple of years never to be revived.  Maverick was never in
LOD.  There have been 2 lists of members (one in phrack and another in the lod
tj) and those lists ar the final word on membership.  We obviously cannot
prevent copy-cats from saying they are in lod.  When there was an LOD, our
goals were to explore and leave systems as we found them.  The goals were to
expose security flaws so they could be fixed before REAL criminals and vandals
such as this Maverick character could do damage.  If this Maverick character
did indeed disrupt E911 service he should be not only be charged with computer
trespassing but also attempted murder.  911 is serious business."

    Lex Luthor's comments, made before the names of the arrested were released,
were echoed by Chris Goggans, a/k/a "Erik Bloodaxe, and Mark Abene, a/k/a
Phiber Optik, both ex-LOD members and by Craig Neidorf who chronicled the
membership of LOD in his electronic publication Phrack.

    When the names of the arrested became public, Newsbytes again contacted Lex
Luthor to see if the names were familiar.  Luthor replied "Can't add anything,
I never heard of them."

    Phiber Optik, a New York resident told Newsbytes that he remembered
Pluchino as a person that ran a computer "chat" system called "Interchat" based
in New Jersey.  Phiber added "They never were LOD members and Pluchino was not
known as a computer hacker.  It sounds as though they were LOD wanabees who are
now, by going to jail, going to get the attention they desire."

    A law enforcement official, familiar with the SunDevil investigation of
Pluchino, agreed with Phiber, saying "there was no indication of any connection
with the Legion of Doom." The official, speaking under the condition of
anonymity, also told Newsbytes that the SunDevil investigation of Pluchino is
still proceeding and, as such, cannot be commented on.

    Leonard also told Newsbytes that the investigation has been a joint effort
of New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia police departments and said that, in
conjunction with the October 9th 2:00 AM arrests of Pluchino and Maverick, a
simultaneous "search and seizure" operation was carried out at the Hanover,
Maryland home of Zohar Shif, a/k/a "Zeke", a 23 year-old who had also been the
subject of a SunDevil search and seizure.

    Leonard also said that, in addition to computers taken from Pluchino,
material was found "establishing a link to the Legion of Doom." Told of the
comments by LOD members that the group did not exist anymore, Leonard said
"While the original members may have gone on to other things, these people say
they are the LOD and some of them have direct connection to LOD members and
have LOD materials."

    Asked by Newsbytes to comment on Leonard's comments, Phiber Optik said "The
material he's referring to is probably text files that have been floating
around BBS's for years, Just because someone has downloaded the files certainly
doesn't mean that they are or ever were connected with LOD."


  Group of "Computer Hackers" Indicted; First Use of Wiretaps in Such a Case
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     [Courtesy of Newsbytes July 8, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, July 8 /U.S.  Newswire/ -- A group of five "computer hackers" has
been indicted on charges of computer tampering, computer fraud, wire fraud,
illegal wiretapping, and conspiracy, by a federal grand jury in Manhattan,
resulting from the first investigative use of court-authorized wiretaps to
obtain conversations and data transmissions of computer hackers.

    A computer hacker is someone who uses a computer or a telephone to obtain
unauthorized access to other computers.

    The indictment, which was filed today, alleges that Julio Fernandez, a/k/a
"Outlaw," John Lee, a/k/a "Corrupt," Mark Abene, a/k/a "Phiber Optik," Elias
Ladopoulos, a/k/a "Acid Phreak," and Paul Stira, a/k/a "Scorpion," infiltrated
a wide variety of computer systems, including systems operated by telephone
companies, credit reporting services, and educational institutions.

    According to Otto G.  Obermaier, United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, James E.  Heavey, special agent in charge, New York Field
Division, United States Secret Service, William Y.  Doran, special agent in
charge, Criminal Division, New York Field Division, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and Scott Charney, chief of the Computer Crime Unit of the
Department of Justice, the indictment charges that the defendants were part of
a closely knit group of computer hackers self-styled "MOD," an acronym used
variously for "Masters of Disaster" and "Masters of Deception" among other
things.

    The indictment alleges that the defendants broke into computers "to enhance
their image and prestige among other computer hackers; to harass and intimidate
rival hackers and other people they did not like; to obtain telephone, credit,
information and other services without paying for them; and to obtain
passwords, account numbers and other things of value which they could sell to
others."

    The defendants are also alleged to have used unauthorized passwords and
billing codes to make long distance telephone calls and to be able to
communicate with other computers for free.

    Some of the computers that the defendants allegedly broke into were
telephone switching computers operated by Southwestern Bell, New York
Telephone, Pacific Bell, U.S.  West and Martin Marietta Electronics Information
and Missile Group.  According to the indictment, such switching computers each
control telephone service for tens of thousands of telephone lines.

    In some instances, the defendants allegedly tampered with the computers by
adding and altering calling features.  In some cases, the defendants allegedly
call forwarded local numbers to long distance numbers and thereby obtained long
distance services for the price of a local call.

    Southwestern Bell is alleged to have incurred losses of approximately $
370,000 in 1991 as a result of computer tampering by defendants Fernandez, Lee,
and Abene.

    The indictment also alleges that the defendants gained access to computers
operated by BT North America, a company that operates the Tymnet data transfer
ne twork.  The defendants were allegedly able to use their access to Tymnet
computers to intercept data communications while being transmitted through the
network, including computer passwords of Tymnet employees.  On one occasion,
Fernandez and Lee allegedly intercepted data communications on a network
operated by the Bank of America.

    The charges also allege that the defendants gained access to credit and
information services including TRW, Trans Union and Information America.

    The defendants allegedly were able to obtain personal information on people
including credit reports, telephone numbers, addresses, neighbor listings and
social security numbers by virtue of their access to these services.

    On one occasion Lee and another member of the group are alleged to have
discussed obtaining information from another hacker that would allow them to
alter credit reports on TRW.  As quoted in the indictment, Lee said that the
information he wanted would permit them "to destroy people's lives...  or make
them look like saints."

    The indictment further charges that in November 1991, Fernandez and Lee
sold information to Morton Rosenfeld concerning how to access credit services.
The indictment further alleges that Fernandez later provided Rosenfeld's
associates with a TRW account number and password that Rosenfeld and his
associates used to obtain approximately 176 TRW credit reports on various
individuals.  (In a separate but related court action, Rosenfeld pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to use and traffic in account numbers of TRW.  See below).

    According to Stephen Fishbein, the assistant United States attorney in
charge of the prosecution, the indictment also alleges that members of MOD
wiped out almost all of the information contained within the Learning Link
computer operated by the Educational Broadcasting Corp.  (WNET Channel 13) in
New York City.

    The Learning Link computer provided educational and instructional
information to hundreds of schools and teachers in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.

    Specifically, the indictment charges that on Nov.  28, 1989, the
information on the Learning Link was destroyed and a message was left on the
computer that said: "Happy Thanksgiving you turkeys, from all of us at MOD" and
which was signed with the aliases "Acid Phreak," "Phiber Optik," and
"Scorpion."

    During an NBC News broadcast on Nov.  14, 1990, two computer hackers
identified only by the aliases "Acid Phreak" and "Phiber Optik" took
responsibility for sending the "Happy Thanksgiving" message.

    Obermaier stated that the charges filed today resulted from a joint
investigation by the United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

    "This is the first federal investigation ever to use court-authorized
wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of computer hackers,"
said Obermaier.

    He praised both the Secret Service and the FBI for their extensive efforts
in this case.  Obermaier also thanked the Department of Justice Computer Crime
Unit for their important assistance in the investigation.  Additionally,
Obermaier thanked the companies and institutions whose computer systems were
affected by the defendants' activities, all of whom cooperated fully in the
investigation.

    Fernandez, age 18, resides at 3448 Steenwick Ave., Bronx, New York.  Lee
(also known as John Farrington), age 21, resides at 64A Kosciusco St.
Brooklyn, New York.  Abene, age 20, resides at 94-42 Alstyne Ave., Queens, New
York.  Elias Ladopoulos, age 22, resides at 85-21 159th St., Queens, New York.
Paul Stira, age 22 , resides at 114-90 227th St., Queens, New York.  The
defendants' arraignment has been scheduled for July 16, at 10 a.m.  in
Manhattan federal court.

    The charges contained in the indictment are accusations only and the
defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Fishbein
stated that if convicted, each of the defendants may be sentenced to a maximum
of five years imprisonment on the conspiracy count.  Each of the additional
counts also carries a maximum of five years imprisonment, except for the count
charging Fernandez with possession of access devices, which carries a maximum
of ten years imprisonment.  Additionally, each of the counts carries a maximum
fine of the greater of $ 250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss incurred.

    In separate but related court actions, it was announced that Rosenfeld and
Alfredo De La Fe have each pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal District Court
to conspiracy to use and to traffic in unauthorized access devices in
connection with activities that also involved members of MOD.

    Rosenfeld pled guilty on June 24 before Shirley Wohl Kram, United States
District Judge.

    At his guilty plea, Rosenfeld admitted that he purchased account numbers
and passwords for TRW and other credit reporting services from computer hackers
and then used the information to obtain credit reports, credit card numbers,
social security numbers and other personal information which he sold to private
investigators.

    Rosenfeld added in his guilty plea that on or about Nov.  25, 1991, he
purchased information from persons named "Julio" and "John" concerning how to
obtain unauthorized access to credit services.

    Rosenfeld stated that he and his associates later obtained additional
information from "Julio" which they used to pull numerous credit reports.
According to the information to which Rosenfeld pleaded guilty, he had
approximately 176 TRW credit reports at his residence on Dec.  6, 1991.

    De La Fe pled guilty on June 19 before Kenneth Conboy, United States
District Judge.

    At his guilty plea, De La Fe stated that he used and sold telephone numbers
and codes for Private Branch Exchanges ("PBXs").

    According to the information to which De La Fe pleaded guilty, a PBX is a
privately operated computerized telephone system that routes calls, handles
billing, and in some cases permits persons calling into the PBX to obtain
outdial services by entering a code.

    De La Fe admitted that he sold PBX numbers belonging to Bugle Boy
Industries and others to a co-conspirator who used the numbers in a call sell
operation, in which the co-conspirator charged others to make long distance
telephone calls using the PBX numbers.

    De La Fe further admitted that he and his associates used the PBX numbers
to obtain free long distance services for themselves.  De La Fe said that one
of the people with whom he frequently made free long distance conference calls
was a person named John Farrington, who he also knew as "Corrupt."

    Rosenfeld, age 21, resides at 2161 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y.  Alfredo De
La Fe, age 18, resides at 17 West 90th St., N.Y.  Rosenfeld and De La Fe each
face maximum sentences of five years, imprisonment and maximum fines of the
greater of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss incurred.  Both defendants
have been released pending sentence on $20,000 appearance bonds.  Rosenfeld's
sentencing is scheduled for Sept.  9, before Shirley Wohl Kram.  De La Fe's
sentencing is scheduled for Aug.  31, before Conboy.

               Legion Of Doom Connection With 911 Attacks Denied
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes October 16, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 OCT 16(NB) -- Members of the well
publicized group of computer hackers, The Legion of Doom, have denied any
connection with the recent alleged tampering with US and Canadian 911 emergency
systems.  They have also told Newsbytes that the Legion Of Doom (LOD) group has
been defunct for a number of years.

    The recent publicized quote by an arrested 23 year old New Jersey man,
identified only as Maverick, that he was a member of the Legion of Doom and
that the group's intent was "to attempt to penetrate the 911 computer systems
and inflect them with viruses to cause havoc" has infuriated many of the
original group.

    "Lex Luthor", one of the founders of LOD, told Newsbytes "As far as I am
concerned the LOD has been dead for a couple of years never to be revived.
Maverick was never in LOD.  There have been 2 lists of members (one in phrack
and another in the lod tj) and those lists are the final word on membership.
There has been no revival of lod by me nor other ex- members.  We obviously
cannot prevent copy-cats from saying they are in lod.  When there was an LOD,
our goals were to explore and leave systems as we found them.  The goals were
to expose security flaws so they could be fixed before REAL criminals and
vandals such as this Maverick character could do damage.  If this Maverick
character did indeed disrupt E911 service he should be not only be charged with
computer trespassing but also attempted murder.  911 is serious business."

    Lex continued "I am obviously not affiliated with any type of illegal
activities whatever especially those concerning computer systems.  However, I
do try to keep up with what's going on and have 2 articles on computer security
being prepared to be published.  I won't say where or what name I am using
because if the editors know an ex-hacker is trying to help society and help
secure computer systems they probably would not accept the article."

    Captain James Bourque of the Chesterfield County, Virginia police and the
person who had quoted Maverick to the press, told Newsbytes that Lex's comments
were probably correct.  He said "I don't think that there is a connection with
the original group.  I think that this group sort of took on the Legion of Doom
Name and the causes that they think the Legion of Doom might have been involved
in."

    Bourque also said "This group tried to publicize their activities by
calling the local ABC station here as well as ABC in New York.  It was not
unusual for four or five of these individuals to set up a telephone conference
and then to try to bring down our local 911 system here by monopolizing the
system -- it never worked but they continued to try."

    Bourgue told Newsbytes that the continuing investigation is being carried
out by local law enforcement agencies and that an investigator from his
organization was in Newark reviewing the evidence against Maverick.  He said
"It's possible that the Secret Service will become involved after the
presidential election is over.  They are very busy now."

Mike Godwin , in-house counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
(EFF), an organization that has been involved in a number of cases
involving admitted LOD members, commented to Newsbytes "I don't
believe for a minute that this has anything to do with the real Legion
of Doom."

    Phiber Optic, another ex-LOD member, told Newsbytes that he was disturbed
that the media accepted the designation of Maverick as LOD, saying "If he said
that he was a Martian, would they have put in the paper that he was a Martian?"

    Phiber had previously posted a comment on the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link
(WELL) on the LOD announcement and it is reprinted with his permission:

    1)  Kids prank 911.
    2)  Kids get caught for being jackasses.
    3)  One kid just happens to have a computer.
    4)  Now it's suddenly a 'hacker crime'.
    5)  Kid foolishly decides he's in the 'Legion of Doom' when he's
        questioned, because he probably always wanted to be (his heroes!).
    6)  Media pukes on itself.  ("This is a HEADLINE!!!")
        There.  Can we all grow up and move along now?

    Emmanuel Goldstein, publisher of 2600 Magazine: The Hacker Quarterly, also
took issued with the designation of those arrested in New Jersey and Canada as
"hackers", telling Newsbytes "No where have I seen any indication that these
people were inside of a telephone company computer.  They were allegedly making
vocal calls to the 911 services and trying to disrupt them.  You certainly
don't have to be a genius to do that.  Let's not demean hackers by associating
them with the kind of behavior that is alleged."

    NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 OCT 12(NB) -- United Press International
and the Toronto Sun have reported arrests related to alleged "hacker" attacks
on 911 systems.  The law enforcement personnel quoted in the stories were not
available for comment due to the observance of Columbus Day and the Canadian
Thanksgiving, respectively.

    The UPI story reports the arrest of a 23 year-old Newark, New Jersey
individual, identified only as "Maverick" for allegedly attempting to cause
havoc through the disruption of 911 service.  The story also said that arrests
were expected to be forthcoming in two Maryland locations.

    The Toronto story, written by Kevin Hann, described the arrest of a 15 year
old high school student accused of misdirecting emergency services crews and
reporting false medical emergencies.  He, according to quotes attributed to
Toronto police officials, used a home computer to route calls through the
United States back to Toronto in an attempt to confuse security systems.

    The New Jersey man arrested was said to be part of a loose network of
computer "hackers" known as the Legion of Doom (LOD) which, according to the
story, engages in telephone fraud by using corporate Private Branch Exchanges
(PBX) systems to illegally place their calls It was alleged that the group made
caused over $100,000 of charges to be incurred by a Minnesota company within a
single month.

    The name Legion of Doom has been used repeatedly in recent years by both
law enforcement personnel and others in the last few years.  Robert Riggs, Adam
Grant and Franklin Darden, convicted in 1990 for intrusion in to BellSouth's
computer systems were identified by law enforcement officials as members of the
Legion of Doom as was Len Rose, sentenced in 1991 for "receiving
misappropriated UNIX source code."

    Additionally, other persons have identified themselves as members or
ex-members of the Legion of Doom.  In June 1991, Chris Goggans, Scott Chasin
and Ken Shulman, announcing the formation of ComSec, a computer security firm,
identified themselves as former LOD-ers "Erik Bloodaxe", "Doc Holiday", and
"Malefactor" (the firm has since gone out of business).  In January 1992,
announcing the commercial bulletin board system Phantom Access, the system
owners, Patrick Kroupa and Bruce Fancher, described themselves as "two former
East-Coast Legion of Doom members" ("Lord Digital" and "Dead Lord").

    Fancher told Newsbytes "The Legion of Doom is not and never was an
organization with criminal intent.  Any criminal activity that might have
happened was the result of inadvertent actions while exploring.  I never head
of Maverick and doubt that he was a member of the group known as the Legion of
Doom.  I also doubt that anyone that I knew in the group would have considered
malicious acts involving 911 systems."

                      New York Computer Crime Indictments
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     [ Courtesy of Newsbytes July 9, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, N.Y., U.S.A., 1992 JULY 9 (NB) -- Otto G.  Obermaier, United
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, has announced the
indictment of five "computer hackers" on charges of computer tampering,
computer fraud, wire fraud, illegal wiretapping and conspiracy.  The
announcement was made at a press conference at 2:00 PM on Wednesday, July 8th
at the Federal Court hose in Manhattan

    Named in the indictment were Julio Fernandez, 18, known as the "Outlaw";
John Lee, 21, a/k/a "Corrupt"; Mark Abene, 20, a/k/a "Phiber Optik"; Elias
Ladopoulos, 22, a/k/a "Acid Phreak"; and "Paul Stira, 22, a/k/a "Scorpion".  In
addition to alleged specific illegal acts involving computers, the five
individuals were also charged with conspiracy.

    According to the indictment, the five were members of a group known as MOD
(standing for either "Masters of Disaster" or "Masters of Deception") and the
goal of the conspiracy was "that the members of MOD would gain access to and
control of computer systems in order to enhance their image and prestige among
other computer hackers; to harass and intimidate rival hackers and people they
did not like; to obtain telephone, credit, information, and other services
without paying for them; and to obtain.  passwords, account numbers and other
things of value which they could sell to others."

    The indictment defines computer hacker as "someone who uses a computer or a
telephone to obtain unauthorized access to other computers."

    Obermaier stated that this investigation was "the first investigative use
of court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of
computer hackers." He said that this procedure was essential to the
investigation and that "It demonstrates, I think, the federal government's
ability to deal with criminal conduct as it moves into new technological
areas." He added that the interception of data was possible only because the
material was in analog form and added "Most of the new technology is in digital
form and there is a pending statute in the Congress which seeks the support of
telecommunications companies to allow the federal government, under court
authorization, to intercept digital transmission.  Many of you may have read
the newspaper about the laser transmission which go through fiber optics as
ernment needs the help of Congress and, indeed, the telecommunications
companies to able to intercept digital While all of those indicted were charged
with some type of unlawful access to one or more of computer systems belonging
to the following: Southwestern Bell, BT North America, New York Telephone, ITT,
Information America, TRW, Trans Union, Pacific Bell, the University of
Washington, New York University, U.S.  West, Learning Link, Tymnet and Martin
Marietta Electronics Information and Missile Group, Fernandez and Lee were also
charged with selling illegally obtained credit information to a person that
later re-sold the information to private detectives.

    Assistant United States Attorney Stephen Fishbein announced that Morton
Rosenfeld has been indicted and pled guilty to purchasing credit information
and access codes from persons named "Julio" and "John".  Fishbein said that
Rosenfeld, at the time of his arrest on December 6, 1991, has approximately 176
TRW credit reports in his possession.  Rosenfeld, 21, pled guilty on June 24,
1992 and is scheduled to be sentenced on September 9th.  He faces a maximum of
five years imprisonment and a fine of the greater of $250,000 or twice the
gross gain or loss incurred.

    Fishbein also announced the outcome of a "separate but related court
action, Alfredo De La Fe, 18, pled guilty on June 19, 1992 to the use and sale
of telephone numbers and codes for Private Branch Exchanges (PBX's).  De La Fe
said that he had sold PBX numbers belonging to Bugle Boy Industries to a
co-conspirator who used the numbers in a call-selling operation.  He also said
that he and a person that he knew as "Corrupt" had made illegal long difference
conference calls.  De La Fe faces the same maximum penalty as Rosenfeld and is
scheduled for sentencing on August 31st.

    Among the charges against the five charged as conspirators is the
allegation that Fernandez, Lee, Abene and "others whom they aided and abetted"
performed various computer activities "that caused losses to Southwestern Bell
of approximately $370,000.  When asked by Newsbytes how the losses were
calculated, Fishbein said that there was no breakdown beyond that stated in the
indictment -- "expenses to locate and replace computer programs and other
information that had been modified or otherwise corrupted, expenses to
determine the source of the unauthorized intrusions, and expenses for new
computers and security devices that were necessary to prevent continued
unauthorized access by the defendants and others whom they aided and abetted."

    In answer to a Newsbytes question concerning the appropriateness of making
an intruder into a computer system totally responsible for the cost of adding
security features "which possibly should have been there to begin with",
Obermaier said "That theory would make the burglar the safety expert since one
can't have people going around fooling around with other people's relatively
private information and then claiming that I'm doing it for their good."

    Paul Tough of Harper's Magazine followed up on the same topic by saying "In
the Craig Neidorf case a regional telephone company claimed that a document was
worth over $100,000.  When it was found to be worth only $12, the case was
thrown out.  In view of that, are you concerned that they (Southwestern Bell)
may have overreported?  In response, Obermaier "No, we are not concerned.  It's
a matter of proof and, if the accused stand trial and have a similar experience
to as happened the case you cite, not in this district, then the results
predictably will be the same." Fishbein said that the conspiracy change carries
a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment while each of the other counts
(there are 10 additional counts) carries a maximum of five years imprisonment
and a fine of the greater of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss incurred.
A single exception is a count charging Fernandez with possessing fifteen or
more unauthorized access devices.  That count carries a maximum penalty of ten
years imprisonment.

    In response to a statement by Alex Michelini of the New York Daily News
that "What you've outlined, basically, except for the sales of credit
information, this sounds like a big prank, most of it", Obermaier said "Really,
Well, I suppose, if you can characterize that as a prank but it's really a
federal crime allowing people without authorization to rummage through the data
of other people to which they do not have access and, as I point out to you
again, the burglar cannot be your safety expert.  He may be inside and laugh at
you when you come home and say that your lock is not particularly good but I
think you, if you were affected by that contact, would be somewhat miffed"

    Obermaier also said that "The message that ought to be delivered with this
indictment is that such conduct will not be tolerated, irrespective of tensible
purpose."

    Obermaier also said that "The message that ought to be delivered with this
indictment is that such conduct will not be tolerated, irrespective of the ag
of the particular accused or their ostensible purpose."

    Others participating in the news conference were Raymond Shaddick, United
States Secret Service assistant director - Office of Investigations; William Y.
Doran, FBI special agent in charge, New York criminal division; Scott Charney,
United States Dept.  of Justice chief of computer crime unit.  All stressed the
cooperation that had gone on between the various law enforcement agencies
during the investigation.

    Charney told Newsbytes that, in spite of the fact that the search warrants
executed on Stira and Ladopoulos preceded those executed on Lee and Fernandez
by almost two years and that the last specific allegation against Stira
proceeds the first against Lee by 16 months and the first against Fernandez by
21 months, there is evidence that links them together in the conspiracy.
Charney also told Newsbytes that the counts against Abene were not related to a
misdemeanor conviction in early 1991 for which he served community service.
Those indicted have been asked to present themselves at New York Service
Services headquarters at 9:00 AM on July 8th for fingerprinting.  Arraignment
for the indicted is scheduled for Thursday, July 16th.

    Abene told Newsbytes that while he couldn't comment on anything related to
the indictment until he obtained legal counsel, "I've been participating i
conferences with law enforcement personnel and guest lecturing to college
classes for the last year and a half.  In every case, I have said how those
responsible for information about us have the responsibility to protect that
data.  I have also tried to explain the great difference between a true hacker
and a person who uses computers for criminal profit.  I hope that I have
increased understanding with these efforts."

                 [ Courtesy of Newsbytes Week July 17, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, N.Y., U.S.A., 1992 JULY 17 (NB) --At an arraignment in New York
Federal Court on Thursday, July 16th, the five New York "hackers", recently
indicted on charges relating to alleged computer intrusion, all entered pleas
of not guilty and were released after each signed a personal recognizance (PRB)
bond of $15,000 to guarantee continued appearances in court.

    The accused, Mark Abene also known as"Phiber Optik"; Julio Fernandez a/k/a
"Outlaw"; Elias Ladopoulos a/k/a "Acid Phreak"; John Lee a/k/a "Corrupt"; and
Paul Stira a/k/a "Scorpion", were indicted on July 8th on 11 counts alleging
various computer and communications related crimes --although all five were
indicted together, each in not named in all eleven counts and the maximum
penalties possible under the charges vary from 5 years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine (Stira) to 40 years imprisonment and a $2 million fine (Lee).

    As part of the arraignment process, United States District Judge Richard
Owen was assigned as the case's presiding judge and a pre-trial meeting between
the judge and the parties involved.

    Charles Ross, attorney for John Lee, told Newsbytes "John Lee entered a not
guilty plea and we intend to energetically and aggressively defend against the
charges made against him."

    Ross also explained the procedures that will be in effect in the case,
saying "We will meet with the judge and he will set a schedule for discovery
and the filing of motions.  The defense will have to review the evidence that
the government has amassed before it can file intelligent motions and the first
meeting is simply a scheduling one."

    Marjorie Peerce, attorney for Stira, told Newsbytes "Mr.  Stira has pleaded
not guilty and will continue to plead not guilty.  I am sorry to see the
government indict a 22 year old college student for acts that he allegedly
committed as a 19 year old."

    The terms of the PRB signed by the accused require them to remain within
the continental United States.  In requesting the bond arrangement, Assistant
United States Attorney Stephen Fishbein referred to the allegations as serious
and requested the $15,000 bond with the stipulation that the accused have their
bonds co-signed by parents.  Abene, Fernandez and Lee, through their attorneys,
agreed to the bond as stipulated while the attorneys for Ladopoulos and Stira
requested no bail or bond for their clients, citing the fact that their clients
have been available, when requested by authorities, for over a year.  After
consideration by the judge, the same $15,000 bond was set for Ladopoulos and
Stira but no co-signature was required.


       New York Police Responds To Blockage Of International Phone Calls
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                  [ Courtesy of Newsbytes Week June 18, 1992 ]

    WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 JUN 18 (NB) -- New York State Police Special
Investigator Donald Delaney, in a conversation with Newsbytes, strongly
supported the move by New York Telephone Company, blocking calls to foreign
countries from pay phones in New York City's Times Square, Port Authority Bus
Terminal and other midtown locations with a history of high credit card calling
fraud, as reported elsewhere by Newsbytes.

    Delaney said: "I think that it is about time that such action was taken.
Telephone fraud in New York City is out of control and that is why that New
York Telephone took the action"

    Delaney continued: "I think that this should be just the beginning.  It is
not only in midtown Manhattan that we find this fraud.  From one end of
Broadway to another, there is heavy incidence of fraudulent calls through pay
phones.  You will also find neighborhoods that have high incidence of the same
type of crime.  I would like to see the same type of blockage on all pay
phones." The Port Authority Bus Terminal has long been identified as a major
scene of telecommunications fraud encompassing not only call selling by the
collection of valid credit card numbers from unsuspecting users so that numbers
may, in turn, be used for fraudulent calls.  The numbers are generally taken
through "shoulder-surfing", a term for simply looking over the shoulder of an
unsuspecting caller and recording the keystrokes made while entering the credit
card number.

    According to Delaney, shoulder-surfing in the Port Authority takes in a
whole new dimension with people using binoculars and telescopes from positions
in Port Authority's balcony to see the numbers and voice-activated tape
recorder to record them.

             New York State Police Decriminalize the word "Hacker"
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes October 21, 1992 ]

    ALBANY, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 OCT 21(NB) -- Senior investigator Ron
Stevens of the New York State Police Computer Unit has told Newsbytes that it
will be the practice of his unit to avoid the use of the term "hacker" in
describing those alleged to have committed computer crimes.

    Stevens told Newsbytes "We use the term computer criminal to describe those
who break the law using computers.  While the lay person may have come to
understand the meaning of hacker as a computer criminal, the term isn't
accurate.  The people in the early days of the computer industry considered
themselves hackers and they made the computer what it is today.  There are
those today who consider themselves hackers and do not commit illegal acts."

    Stevens had made similar comments in a recent conversation with Albany BBS
operator Marty Winter.  Winter told Newsbytes ""Hacker" is, unfortunately an
example of the media taking what used to be an honorable term, and using it to
describe an activity because they (the media) are too damned lazy or stupid to
come up with something else.  Who knows, maybe one day "computer delinquent"
WILL be used, but I sure ain't gonna hold my breath.

    Stevens, together with investigator Dick Lynch and senior investigator
Donald Delaney, attended the March 1993 Computers, Freedom and Privacy
Conference (CFP-2) in Washington, DC and met such industry figures as Glenn
Tenney, congressional candidate and chairman of the WELL's annual "Hacker
Conference"; Craig Neidorf, founding editor and publisher of Phrack; Steven
Levy, author of "Hackers" and the recently published "Artificial Life"; Bruce
Sterling, author of the recently published "The Hacker Crackdown"; Emmanuel
Goldstein, editor and publisher of 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and a number of
well-known "hackers".  Stevens said "When I came home, I read as much of the
literature about the subject that I could and came to the conclusion that a
hacker is not necessarily a computer criminal."

    The use of the term "hacker' to describe those alleged to have committed
computer crimes has long been an irritant to many in the on-line community.
When the the July 8th federal indictment of 5 New York City individuals
contained the definition of computer hacker as "someone who uses a computer or
a telephone to obtain unauthorized access to other computers.", there was an
outcry on such electronic conferencing system as the WELL (Whole Earth
'Lectronic Link).  Many of the same people reacted quite favorably to the
Stevens statement when it was posted on the WELL.

        New York Telephone Cuts International Service At Some Pay Phones
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                  [ Courtesy of Newsbytes Week June 18, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 JUN 18 (NB) -- As part of its effort to
fight phone fraud with stolen calling card numbers, New York Telephone is
blocking international calls from most of its public phones inside the Port
Authority Bus Terminal and at surrounding sidewalk locations.  The company said
it would also target other high-fraud areas throughout New York City.

    New York Telephone will rely on technology developed by Mars Electronics
International, based in Pennsylvania, which blocks international calls
attempted through any long distance carrier or private business phone system.
New York Telephone said it would implement the program at selected public
phones so as not to inconvenience legitimate callers.

    This is the second time that phone companies have limited service at pay
phones as an anti-crime move.  A few years ago, some phones were switched from
touchtone to rotary dial service, to keep people using them from reaching
beepers allegedly used by drug dealers.

    Now the problem is "sidewalk surfing," where thieves listen to callers
giving their card numbers to operators, or peer over their shoulders when they
take out calling cards.  The numbers are then taken to a pay phone, where
services using them are sold to all comers.  Frequently, the services are sold
to drug dealers, who can then make untraceable calls to their overseas
contacts.  Some observers claim that the numbers are also used by illegal
immigrants calling their families back home.

    Telephone fraud is estimated at more than $1 billion a year nationwide.
New York Telephone operates more than 57,000 public phones in New York City.

                  Reports Of "Raid" On 2600 Washington Meeting
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes November 7, 1992 ]

    WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 NOV 7 (NB) -- Eric Corley, a/k/a "Emmanuel
Goldstein", editor and publisher of 2600 Magazine: The Hacker Quarterly has
told Newsbytes that the Friday, November November 6th 2600 meeting held in the
Pentagon City Mall, outside of Washington, DC.  was disrupted by threats of
arrest by mall security officers and Arlington, VA police.

    2600 Magazine promotes monthly meetings of hackers, press and other
interested parties throughout the country.  The meetings are held in public
locations on the first Friday evening of the month and the groups often contact
each other by telephone during the meetings.  Corley told Newsbytes that
meetings were held that evening in New York, Washington, Philadelphia,
Cambridge, St.  Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Corley said
"While I am sure that meetings have been observed by law enforcement agencies,
this is the only time that we have been harassed.  It is definitely a freedom
of speech issue."

    According to Craig Neidorf, who was present at the meeting handing out
applications for Computer Professionals For Social Responsibility (CPSR), "I
saw the security officers focusing on us.  Then they started to come toward us
from a number of directions under what seemed to be the direction of a person
with a walkie-talkie on a balcony.  When they approached, I left the group and
observed the security personnel encircling the group of about 30 gatherers.
The group was mainly composed of high school and college students.  The guards
demanded to search the knapsacks and bags of the gatherers.  They confiscated
material, including CPSR applications, a copy of Mondo 2000 (a magazine) and
other material.  They also confiscated film from a person trying to take
pictures of the guards and, when a hacker called "HackRat" attempted to copy
down the names of the guards, they took his pencil and paper."

    Neidorf continued, "I left to go outside and rejoined the group when they
were ejected from the mall.  The guards continued challenging the group and
told them that they would be arrested if they returned.  When one of the people
began to take pictures of the guards, the apparent supervisor became excited
and threatening but did not confiscate the film."

    Neidorf also said "I think that the raid was planned.  They hit right about
6:00 and they identified our group as "hackers" and said that they knew that
this group met every month."

    Neidorf's story was supported by a Washington "hacker" called "Inhuman",
who told Newsbytes "I arrived at the meeting late and saw the group being
detained by the guards.  I walked along with the group as they were being
ushered out and when I asked a person who seemed to be in authority his name,
he pointed at a badge with his name written in script on it.  I couldn't make
out the name and, when I mentioned that to the person, he said 'If you can't
read it, too bad.' I did read his name, 'C.  Thomas', from another badge."

    Inhuman also told Newsbytes that, while he did not hear it said, he was
told by a number of people that the guards said that they were 'acting on
behalf of the Secret Service.  "I was also told that there were two police
officers there from the Arlington County Police present but I did not see
them."

    Another attendee, Doug Luce posted an account of his on an NY BBS and gave
Newsbytes permission to quote Luce wrote "I also got to the DC meeting very
late; 7:45 or so.  It seemed like a coordinated harassment episode, not geared
toward busting anyone, but designed to get people riled up, and maybe not come
back to the mall.  A couple of the things I overheard: someone had brought a
keyboard to sell, and the cops had harassed him about it, saying 'You aren't
selling anything in my mall without a vendors permit!' Blaize (another
attendee) says that maybe his handcuffing Hack Rat might have set the cops off;
or maybe it was the Whisper 2000 that the cops were convinced was a stun gun.
The word is that there was stuff taken and not given back, wires and soldering
tools.  There is also the rumor that the cops were going through everyone's
bags and belongings, and that some people were detained.  While the thrust of
the effort seemed to be mall security, there are conflicting reports about
supporting personnel.  Some people said that the SS (Secret Service) might have
been there, others thought the FBI or plainclothes city officers were assisting
(or coordinating).  Supposedly, several of them had removed their name tags
before moving in."

    Luce's reference to possible Secret Service involvement was supported by a
19 year-old college student known as the "Lithium Bandit", who told Newsbytes
"I got to the mall about 6:15 and saw the group being detained by approximately
5 Arlington County police and 5 security guards.  When I walked over to see
what was going on, a security guard asked me for an ID and I refused to show it
saying that I was about to leave.  The guard said that I couldn't leave and
told me that I had to see a police officer.  When I did, the officer demanded
ID and, when I once again refused, informed me that I could be detained for up
to 10 hours for refusing to produce identification.  I gave in and produced my
school ID which the police gave to the security people who copied down my name
and social security number."

    Lithium Bandit continued "When I asked the police what was behind this
action, I was told that they couldn't answer but that "the Secret Service is
involved and we are within our rights doing this.  I and some others later went
to the Arlington police station to attempt to get more information.  I was told
only that there was a report of the use of a stolen credit card and 2 officers
sent to investigate -- they later admitted that it was 5.  While I was
detained, I heard no mention of a credit card and there was no one arrested."

    Marc Rotenberg, director of CPSR's Washington office, told Newsbytes "I
have really no details on the incident yet but I am very concerned about the
reports and confiscation of CPSR applications, if true, is outrageous.  I will
find out more facts on Monday.

    Newsbytes was told by the Pentagon City Mall office that any information
concerning the action would have to come from the director of security, Al
Johnson, who will not be available until Monday.  The Arlington Country Police
referred Newsbytes to a "press briefing recording" which had not been updated
since the morning before the incident.

    Corley told Newsbytes "there have been no reports of misbehavior by any of
these people.  They were obviously singled out because they were hackers.  It's
as if they were being singled out as an ethnic group.  I admire the way the
group responded -- in a courteous fashion but it is inexcusable that it
happened.  I will be at the next Washington meeting to insure that it doesn't
happen again."

    The manager of one of New York state's largest malls provided background
information to Newsbytes on the rights of malls to police those on mall
property, saying "The primary purpose of a mall is to sell.  The interior of
the mall is private property and is subject to the regulations of the mall.
The only requirement is that the regulations be enforced in an even-handed
manner.  I do not allow political activities in my mall so I could not make an
exception for Democrats.  We do allow community groups to meet but they must
request space at least two weeks before the meeting and must have proper
insurance.  Our regulations also say that groups of more than 4 may not
congregate in the mall.  We would ask groups larger than that to disperse.  We
would also ask for identification from those who violate our regulations so
that we may bar them from the mall for a period of 6 months."

    She added "Some people feel that mall atriums and food courts are public
space.  They are not and the industry is united on this.  If the malls were to
receive tax benefits for the common space and public service in snow removal
and the like, it could possibly be a public area but malls are taxed on the
entire space and are totally private property, subject to their own
regulations.  If a group of 20 or more congregated in my mall, they would be
asked to leave."


                    Trial Date Set In New York "Hacker" Case
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy of Newsbytes October 6, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, N.Y., U.S.A., 1992 Oct.  6 (NB) -- At a conference held in United
States Federal Court, Southern District, Judge Richard Owen set April 12, 1993
as the date of the trial of five New York City "hackers" indicted on Wednesday,
July 8th for various alleged telecommunications illegalities (in the initial
indictment, the word "hacker" was defined as "someone who uses a computer or a
telephone to obtain unauthorized access to other computers.").

    The accused, Mark Abene, also known as "Phiber Optik"; Julio Fernandez
a/k/a "Outlaw"; Elias Lapodolous a/k/a "Acid Phreak"; John Lee a/k/a "Corrupt";
and Paul Stiva a/k/a "Scorpion", were charged at the original indictment with
being part of a conspiracy intended to allow "the members of MOD (the name of
the group) would gain access to and control of computer systems in order to
enhance their image and prestige among other computer hackers; to harass and
intimidate rival hackers and people they did not like; to obtain telephone,
credit, information, and other services without paying for them; and to obtain.
passwords, account numbers and other things of value which they could sell to
others." Additionally,individuals of the group were charged with specific
crimes including the illegal accessing of computers belonging to Southwestern
Bell.

    Since the indictment, attorneys for the defendants have been reviewing
evidence obtained by the Secret Service and the FBI through court-authorized
wiretapping that is purported to substantiate the allegations.  At the most
recent court appearance, the attorneys requested an extended period of time for
the discovery process because they had only recently been furnished diskettes
containing information obtained through the inception of computer
communications and, according to a defense attorney, the material "runs
somewhere between 20 and 50 megabytes."

    When asked by Judge Owen for a definition of a megabyte, United States
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Fishbein informed him that a megabyte is a
million bytes and that a "byte is a piece of information." Owen then asked if
Fishbein was really going to present all that information to a jury, saying
"That would really byte the jury." Fishbein said that only that portion of the
material that actually showed the existence of illegal activity would have to
be shown but that the defense attorneys might wish to examine all of the
intercepted material.

    Owen then scheduled January 3rd as the date for filing of defense motions,
a date in February for government response and April 12th as the actual trial
date.

    Marjorie Peerce, attorney for Paul Stira, told Newsbytes "I can't comment
on the details of the case but Mr.  Stira looks forward to the date he can tell
his story in court."

            Computer Criminals Are After Your Credit-Card Numbers --
                          To Steal With, Sell And Swap
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 [ Courtesy of New York Newsday May 26, 1992 ]

    THE KID, from Springfield Gardens, Queens, was a carder, of course.

    He was doing what carders do: trying to talk a salesman into overnight -
expressing him a $4,000 computer system -- and using a stolen credit-card
number for payment.

    The salesman was playing right along on the phone; he had also notified a
co-worker to alert the New York State Police, said William Murphy, a customer
service manager at Creative Computers, who described the event as it was
unfolding on a recent Tuesday morning.  Murphy said that on a typical day, as
many as a dozen times, carders would call and try to buy everything from modems
to whole computer systems.

    Murphy said that these days, the security people at Creative Computers are
able to stop virtually all of them, either by not delivering the goods, or by
delivering them UPS -- that's United Police Service.

    He sighed:  "It's amazing that they even try."

    But try they do.  And at other places, they're successful.  Where once
hacking into a credit bureau was a kind of rite of passage for computer
intruders, who generally did little more than look up credit histories on
people like Mike Dukakis, now computer criminals are mining national credit
bureaus and mail-order houses, coming away with credit-card numbers to sell,
swap or use for mail-order purchases.

    Underground electronic bulletin board systems help spread not only the
passwords, but the techniques used to tap into different systems.  In San Diego
on April 30, for instance, police raided a bulletin board called Scantronics,
which offered among other things, step-by-step manuals on how to hack into
Equifax Credit Information Services and TRW Information Services, the largest
credit bureaus in the nation, the San Diego Tribune reported.

    "The potential for fraud is enormous, it's almost limitless," said Joel
Lisker, Mastercard International's vice president of security and risk
management, who noted that computer intruders accessed "thousands" of
credit-card account numbers in another recent case.

    MASTERCARD is putting together a task force of its bank members to address
the problem, and is considering inviting hackers in to learn what they can do
to tighten up computer access to credit bureaus, he said.

    Mastercard estimates it lost $57 million to counterfeit scams last year;
Lisker said it is impossible to say how much carders contributed.  But based on
the volume of arrests lately, he figures carding has become a big problem.

    "It's kind of like a farmer that sees a rat," Lisker said.  "If he sees
one, he knows he has several.  And if he sees several he knows he has a major
infestation.  This is a major infestation."

    "It's clearly something we should be concerned about," agreed Scott
Charney, chief of the U.S.  Justice Department's new Computer Crime Unit.
Charney said that roughly 20 percent of the unit's current caseload involves
credit-card fraud, a number that, if nothing else, colors the notion that all
hackers are misunderstood kids, innocently exploring the world of computer
networks.

    "Whether such noble hackers exist, the fact of the matter is we're seeing
people out there whose motives are not that pure," he said.

    On May 11, New York State Police arrested three teenagers in Springfield
Gardens when one of them went to pick up what he hoped was an Amiga 3000
computer system from Creative Computers, at a local UPS depot.

    "What he wanted was a computer, monitor and modem.  What he got was
arrested," said John Kearey, a state police investigator who frequently handles
computer and telecommunications crimes.  Police posed as UPS personnel and
arrested the youth, who led them to his accomplices.

    Kearey said the teens said they got the stolen credit-card number from a
"hacker who they met on a bridge, they couldn't remember his name" -- an
interesting coincidence because the account number was for a next-door neighbor
of one of the youths.  Police suspect that the teens, who claimed to belong to
a small hacking group called the MOB (for Men of Business) either hacked into a
credit bureau for the number, got someone else to do it, or went the low-tech
route -- "dumpster diving" for used carbon copies of credit receipts.

    Indeed, most credit-card fraud has nothing to do with computer abusers.
Boiler-room operations, in which fast-talking con men get cardholders to
divulge their account numbers and expiration dates in exchange for the promise
of greatly discounted vacations or other too-good-to-be-true deals, are far and
away the most common scams, said Gregory Holmes, a spokesman for Visa.

    But carders have an advantage over traditional credit-card cheats: By using
their PCs to invade credit bureaus, they can find credit-card numbers for
virtually anyone.  This is useful to carders who pick specific credit-card
numbers based on location -- a neighbor is out of town for a week, which means
all you have to do is get his account number, stake out his porch and sign for
the package when the mail comes.  Another advantage is address and ZIP code
verifications, once a routine way of double-checking a card's validity, are no
longer useful because carders can get that information from an account record.

    "It's tough," Holmes said.  "Where it becomes a major problem is following
the activity of actually getting the credit-card number; it's sent out on the
black market to a vast group of people" generally over bulletin boards.  From
there, a large number of purchases can be racked up in a short period of time,
well before the cardholder is aware of the situation.  While the cardholder is
not liable, the victims usually are businesses like Creative Computers, or the
credit-card company.

    Murphy said his company used to get burned, although he would not divulge
the extent of its losses.  "It happened until we got wise enough to their
ways," he said.

    Now, with arrangements among various law enforcement agencies, telephone
companies and mail carriers, as well as a combination of call-tracing routines
and other verification methods, carders "rarely" succeed, he said.  Also, a
dozen employees work on credit-card verification now, he said.  "I feel sorry
for the companies that don't have the resources to devote departments to filter
these out.  They're the ones that are getting hit hard."

    In New York, federal, state and local police have been actively
investigating carder cases.  Computers were seized and search warrants served
on a number of locations in December, as part of an ongoing federal
investigation into carding.  City police arrested two youths in Queens in April
after attempting to card a $1,500 computer system from Creative Computers.
They were arrested when they tried to accept delivery.

    "It's a legitimate way to make money.  I know people who say they do it,"
claimed a 16-year-old Long Island hacker who uses the name JJ Flash.

    While he says he eschews carding in favor of more traditional,
non-malicious hacking, JJ Flash said using a computer to break into a credit
bureau is as easy as following a recipe.  He gave a keystroke-by-keystroke
description of how it's done, a fairly simple routine that involved disguising
the carder's calling location by looping through a series of packet networks
and a Canadian bank's data network, before accessing the credit bureau
computer.  Once connected to the credit bureau computer, JJ Flash said a
password was needed -- no problem, if you know what underground bulletin boards
to check.

    "It's really easy to do.  I learned to do it in about thirty seconds.  If
you put enough time and energy into protecting yourself, you'll never get
caught," he said.  For instance, an expert carder knows how to check his own
phone line to see if the telephone company is monitoring it, he claimed.  By
changing the location of a delivery at the last minute, he said carders have
evaded capture.

    J J FLASH said that while most carders buy computers and equipment for
themselves, many buy televisions, videocassette recorders and other goods that
are easy to sell.  "You can usually line up a buyer before its done," he said.
"If you have a $600 TV and you're selling it for $200, you will find a buyer."

    He said that while TRW has tightened up security during the past year,
Equifax was still an easy target.

    But John Ford, an Equifax spokesman, said he believes that hackers greatly
exaggerate their exploits.  He said that in the recent San Diego case, only 12
records were accessed.  "It seems to me the notion that anybody who has a PC
and a modem can sit down and break in to a system is patently untrue," he said.
"We don't have any evidence that suggests this is a frequent daily occurrence."

    Regardless, Ford said his company is taking additional steps to minimize
the risk of intrusion.  "If one is successful in breaking into the system, then
we are instituting some procedures that would render the information that the
hacker receives virtually useless."

    Also, by frequently altering customers' passwords, truncating account
information so that entire credit-card numbers were not displayed, and possibly
encrypting other information, the system will become more secure.

    "We take very seriously our responsibility to be the stewards of consumer
information," Ford said.

    But others say that the credit bureaus aren't doing enough.  Craig Neidorf,
publisher of Phrack, an underground electronic publication "geared to computer
and telecommunications enthusiasts," said that hacking into credit bureaus has
been going on, and has been easy to do "as long as I've been around." Neidorf
said that although he doesn't do it, associates tell him that hacking into
credit bureau's is "child's play" -- something the credit bureaus have been
careless about.

    "For them not to take some basic security steps to my mind makes them
negligent," Neidorf said.  "Sure you can go ahead and have the kids arrested
and yell at them, but why isn't Equifax or any of the other credit bureaus not
stopping the crime from happening in the first place?  It's obvious to me that
whatever they're doing probably isn't enough."


A Recent History Of Carding

    September 6, 1991: An 18-year-old American emigre, living in Israel, was
arrested there for entering military, bank and credit bureau computers.  Police
said he distributed credit-card numbers to hackers in Canada and the United
States who used them to make unknown amounts of cash withdrawals.

    January 13, 1992: Four university students in San Luis Obispo, California,
were arrested after charging $250,000 in merchandise to Mastercard and Visa
accounts.  The computer intruders got access to some 1,600 credit-card
accounts, and used the numbers to buy, among other things: Four pairs of $130
sneakers; a $3,500 stereo; two gas barbecues and a $3,000 day at Disneyland.

    February 13, 1992: Two teenagers were arrested when one of them went to
pick up two computer systems in Bellevue, Wash., using stolen credit-card
numbers.  One told police that another associate had hacked into the computer
system of a mail-order house and circulated a list of 14,000 credit-card
numbers through a bulletin board.

    April 17, 1992: Acting on a tip from San Diego police, two teenagers in
Ohio were arrested in connection with an investigation into a nationwide
computer hacking scheme involving credit-card fraud.  Police allege "as many as
a thousand hackers" have been sharing information for four years on how to use
their computers to tap into credit bureau databases.  Equifax, a credit bureau
that was penetrated, admits that a dozen records were accessed.


            $16,000 Fine For False Distress And Unlicensed Operation
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The Commission notified Richard E. Mattice, of Zion, IL., that he is
apparently liable for a monetary forefeiture of $!6,000 for transmitting flase
distress signals using an unlicensed station.

    On June 7, 1991, Lake County Marine Units 676 and 675 (Lake County
Sheriff's Office) and Coast Guard Station Kenosha (Wisconsin) vessel CG 41325
responded to a "MAYDAY" on Marine Channel 16 by a vessel reporting taking on
water on Lake Michigan near North Point Harbour.  Lake County Marine Unit 676
("Unit 676") identified the source of the transmissions, through radio
direction finding, to be the vessel "It'l Do."  As Unit 676 approached the
vessel the "It'l Do." got under way.  Unit 676 followed and stopped the vessel.
Unit 675 and CG 41325 also intercepted the vessel.  The "It'l Do." was escorted
to Lake Point by Unit 676 and the Coast Guard where it was boarded by both the
Lake County Sheriff's Office and The Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard interrogated
Richard E. Mattice and determined that he was the operator who transmitted the
"MAYDAY."  The Coast Guard determined that there had been no distress
situation.  As there was evidence of alchohol consumption by Mattice, he was
given a field sobriety test, which he passed.  The Coast Guard also determined
at inspection that the station was not licensed.

                     CB Station Shut Down; Equipment Seized
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               [ Courtesy of Popular Communications August, 1992]

    US Marshals, with the assistance of engineers from the Federal
Communications Commission's Philadelphia Office, confiscated the radio
equipment of CB operators Gary Bond (aka Gary Finkelstein)at his home in
Wilmington, Delaware.  The seized equipment included linear amplifiers capable
of boosting transmitter power to 2,000 watts whichi is far above the legal 4
watt limit.  The use, sale of manufacture of linear amplifiers or other devices
that boost CB radio power is illegal.  THese devices can cause severe
interference to licensed radio services.

    The FCC had recieved a petition, signed by area residents, which stated
that CB radio transmissions could be heard on theeir televisions sets and
telephones.  Based upon that information, the Commission's Philadelphia Office
opened an invesitgation centered around the unauthorized use of linear
amplifier equipment.  Staff from that office performed on-scene monitoring in
the Wilmington area.  From the monitored transmissions, FCC investigators
determined that Mr. Bond was operating illegal equipment.

    The seizure took place under federal civil forfeiture proceedings initiated
by the US Attorney for the District Of Deleware.  Carolyn Greene, Assistant US
Attorney, is handling the case for the government.  Further administrative
sanctions are pending against Mr. Bond with the FCC.  The Commission will
continue to enforce its CB rules by prosecuting violators.


                   Fined For Operating An Unlicensed Station
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               [ Courtesy of Popular Communications August, 1992]

    The Commission notified David Plourde of Lewiston, Maine, of an apparent
liability for a forfeiture of $10,000 for operating an unlicensed station.

    Onn October 9, 1991, Plourde operated a CB Radio Station on 27.215 Mhz
using a non-type-accepted transmitter and a linear amplifier.  Use of
non-type-accepted transmitting apparatus voided Plourde's authorization to
operate a CB station.

    Plourde has been the subject of complaints of 12 persons in four cases
handled by the Field Operations Bureau since moving to his present address.
There is a history of complaints converning Plourde's CB operation at his
previous address.  Plourde has not been cooperative in addressing these
complaints.

    The base forfeiture for this type of violation is $8,000.  However,
pursuant to the Policy Statement, Standards for Assessing Forfeitures, it is
appropriate to increase the amount of forfeiture when the conduct is
intentional.  In light of the history of complaints, it appears that Plourde's
violation was intentional.  The Commisson, therefore, increases the amount to
$10,000.

    US Marshalls, with the assistance of staff from the FCC's New York Office,
seized radio equipment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, NY.  The equipment
was used to operatr an unlicensed radio station on 1260 kHz.  The Seizure of
"Radio Guinan" took place under Federal civil forfeiture provisions initiated
by Assistance US Attorney, Christopher Lehmann, Of Brooklyn, NY.

    Engineers from the FC's New York Office located the station using mobile
radio direction finding equipment.  The pirate station was managed by Jean
Lucien Borges of the Guinan Community Information Center and was the subject of
a previous FCC invesitgation November, 1991.  This investigation was initiated
by complaints from radio stations WADO and WFME.  The station was inspected by
FCC engineers and was subsequently issued a written warning.  The FCC referred
the case to the US Attorney, Civil Division, after the station ignored the
warning and went back on the air.

    Unlicensed radio operation is a violation of Section 301 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  Penalties for unlicensed operation
included include fines of up to $100,000 and/or one year in prison.  The US
Department of Justice is proceeding with civil action against the equipment.
Christopher Lehmann, Assistant US Attorney, is a handling the case.

    "We hope that this action sends a message to future would-be pirate radio
operators.  Unlicensed radio operators cannot disregard Federal Authority,"
said Alexander Zimmy, Engineer-in-Charge of the New York Office.

    US Marshals, with the assistance of agents from the Federal Communications
Commission's San Francisco Office, confiscated illegal radio equipment from the
Yak Yak Shack in Corning, California.

    Twenty-seven pieces of illegal radio equpment were seized.  These included
twenty CB linear amplifiers (capable of operating at power levels in excess of
the limits set by the FCC Rules) and seven CB transceivers modified to operate
on unauthorized frequencies.  The use of such equipment can cause harmful
interference to communications of safety-of-life (such as law enforcement,
aviation, or marine), as well as to lawful CB users and home electronic
entertainment equipment.

    The marketing, manufacture, and use of illegal radio equipment violates
Section 302(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  Violators face
potential criminal penalties of up to $100,000 in fines and/or up to one year
in prison.


       Ordered To Pay $750 For Transmitting On An Unauthroized Frequency
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               [ Courtesy of Popular Communications August, 1992]

    The Commission ordered Gerald A Kawalec Of Fulton, TX, to pay a forteiture
of $750 for unlicensed radio transmissions on a frequency assigned to the fixed
aviation and international fixed public radio communications services.

    In his request for review, Kawalec stated that he was not aware that the
frequency was not available for marine use.  He was told to use this frequency
by other radio operators or remembered an incorrect frequency, he stated, his
radio should not have been able to transmit on this frequency.

    The FCC noted Kawalec was knowledgeable regarding radio transmitters, used
the frequency at prearranged times to communicate with freind, used the
frequency for  the stated reason that it had clear reception, and used the
frequency over a period of time.  A person using a radio is respnsible for
transmitting only on frequencies for which he is licensed, and misunderstanding
or unfamiliarity regarding an FCC rule of license requirement does not exucse
a violation.

    By Letter Of January 30, 1991, Kawalec indicated that he could not afford
to pay the monetary forfeiture.  The Field Operations Bureau requested
documentation to support Kawalec's claim of inability to pay.  In a letter to
Kawalec, the Bureau stated "If you do not submit this evidence, the FCC will
resume its review of your monetary forfeiture penalty assuming that you do not
wish to maintain your claim of inability to pay."  No documentation was
provided.

    A Clark, NJ Pirate Radio station was shut down, and its equipment was
seized by the US Government, the FCC said.  The seizure of "RADIO KAOS" took
place under Federal civil forfeiture provisions initiated by the US Attorney,
Micheal Chertoff, of Newark, NJ.

    US Marshals, with the assistance of FCC invesitgators from New York and
Philadelphia and offices of the Clark Police Department, conducted the seizure.
The station was located by an FCC engineer from Philadelphia, using mobile
radio direction finding equipment.

    The unlicensed station operated on 7420 and 7415 kHz from a single family
residence.  The pirate station called itself "RADIO KAOS" and played rock and
roll music.

    The operator of the station was also the subject of a previous FCC
invesitgation concerning complaints of interference to home electronic
entertainment equipment submitted by local residents to the FCC New York
Office.

    Unlicensed radio operation is a violation of Section 301 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Penalties for unlicensed radio
operators include finces of up to $100,000 and/or one year in prison.  The US
Department of Justice is proceeding with civil action against the equipment and
unlicensed radio operator.  Peter Gaeta, Assistant US Attorney, Civil Division,
is handling the case for the Government.

Dobosz, customer assistance manager for AT&T Universal Card Services Corp.

    Dobosz cited several reasons for selecting Voicelink over its competitors,
including productivity, service and support, future product research and
development, financial stability and the quality of Digital Systems' personnel.

    AT&T now ranks among the top three bank credit-card programs.  Its
Universal Card generated $13.2 billion in transaction volume in 1991, with $3.2
billion of that incurring interest charges.  A relatively new card, the
Universal Card has a 1.7-percent delinquency rate, compared to 4 percent to 5
percent for other issuers.

    "Increased delinquencies and fraud are the primary reasons behind higher
interest charges," said Dobosz.  "If we can keep these rates down, we can keep
our interest charges to customers down."

    KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Sprint (NYSE: FON) today announced
a new 800 calling option and other significant enhancements to the Sprint
Clarity business communications offering announced in January.  The latest
options, available June 3, offer Sprint customers greater choice, flexibility
and functionality that may be easily tailored to their individual requirements.

    Through these enhancements to the Clarity platform, Sprint will be the
first to offer a fully integrated communications solution to the small to
middle business market -- customers who spend between $100 and $75,000 per
month on combined outbound and 800 services.

    The new Sprint Clarity options, part of an ongoing commitment to further
enhance the product, include:

    --   Sprint Clarity 800 -- Feature-rich 800 calling option combines 800 and
         outbound services for greater volume discounts.

    --   Targeted Calling Options -- Lets customers tailor service in one
         integrated package versus competitors' multiple products or pricing
         programs.

    --   Clarity Maximum Value Plan (MVP) -- Rewards customers with greater
         discounts in return for a one, two or three-year commitment to Sprint.

    Sprint Clarity is an adaptable integrated solution that includes
customer-defined invoicing and reporting, a variety of standard and enhanced
call management tools and multiple access options.  It also offers a variety of
fax options, conferencing options, and a PC-based, menu-driven software product
for generation of management reports and invoices.

    Sprint Clarity surpasses any other communications offering for the small
and medium business owner today by providing the industry's first feature rich,
fully integrated offering that combines all of a customer's switched and
dedicated outbound, 800, card, cellular and international usage from all
customer locations and applies this combined usage for greater volume
discounts.

    Sprint Clarity enables customers to leverage their total purchasing power
to provide a business advantage not available through Sprint's competitors.
Sprint Clarity's "customer defined invoicing" enables customers to get invoice
and reporting information for all locations and calling options, including 800,
on one invoice, or individual site-by-site invoices, or any other way the
customer prefers.

    Sprint Clarity customers may custom design their 800 and outbound service
through a menu of advanced features for 800 call routing and call control
services.

    "Sprint Clarity 800 positions Sprint for 800 number portability (in March
1993) when customers may move their 800 service to Sprint without changing
their 800 number," said Gerry Euston, vice president of Sprint's Business
Product Marketing.

    Targeted Calling Options enable Sprint customers to tailor their service
based on specific intrastate, interstate and international calling patterns for
each location.  Options include In-state, Worldwide, Europe, Pacific, North
America and South/Central America.  This Clarity enhancement allows Sprint
customers to modify service quickly and easily as calling patterns change,
ensuring the best value for their telecommunications expenditure and
eliminating uncertainty of selecting the best product.

    Clarity MVP rewards business customers who sign up with Sprint for one, two
or three years with larger discounts on all their long distance calling
including 800, card, cellular and international usage.  One contract covers all
services.

    "No one offers choice without confusion quite like Clarity," said Euston.
"Sprint will design the optimal access arrangement and calling options for each
customer.  Customers simply select the desired billing arrangement and features
for each of their locations from the Clarity Options Menu.  Sprint does the
rest.  Customers may add to or modify their current selection at any time."

    Sprint is a diversified international telecommunications company with $8.8
billion in annual revenues and the United States' only nationwide all-digital,
fiber-optic network.  Its divisions provide global long distance voice, data
and video products and services, and local telephone services to more than 4
million subscriber lines in 17 states.

      States, Phone Carriers Adopt Procedures To Address 900-Number Fraud
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     [ Courtesy of PR Newswire June 20, 1992 ]

    HARRISBURG, Pa., May 20 /PRNewswire/ -- More than 30 states, including
Pennsylvania, and the nation's three major long-distance phone carriers have
adopted formal voluntary procedures to help eliminate consumer fraud schemes
that utilize 900-number services, Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr.  said
today.

    Preate said the procedures are similar to those his office has been using
on an informal basis with the carriers for more than a year.

    "The procedures announced today spell out the steps to be taken by AT&T,
MCI and Sprint when they receive complaints from participating states about
potentially fraudulent 900-number promotions," the attorney general said.

    "Here in Pennsylvania, my Public Protection Division and the Office of
Consumer Advocate have been using similar procedures for some time to deal with
businesses that attempt to rip off consumers through deceptive 900-number
schemes.

    "I'm pleased that these procedures have been formally adopted by more than
30 states because they provide a method for attorneys general and the carriers
to effectively address unlawful practices and preserve funds for potential
consumer restitution."

    Businesses nationwide offer a wide range of pay-per-call services -- such
as sports scores, vacation deals and contests -- through 900 numbers.  The
calls generally are carried by long-distance companies that do the billing
under contract with the service provider.

    "Thousands of consumers have been victimized by 900 numbers that provide
fraudulent or worthless services or that fail to adequately inform callers of
the cost of the 900-number call," Preate said.

    The attorney general served on a national task force which concluded last
year that 900-number services "have emerged as one of the most significant
vehicles for consumer fraud in recent history."

    Preate said he has called for comprehensive federal legislation to regulate
900-number service and noted that he created a 900-Number Task Force in
Pennsylvania to investigate and deal with complaints about pay- per-call
services.

    "We've had considerable success in working with the carriers to shut down
deceptive 900-number solicitations," the attorney general said.  He noted that
at his urging, AT&T, MCI and Sprint all agreed last October to block illegal
900-number services that claim to help consumers find jobs.

    Such services are illegal, Preate said, because they charge consumers a fee
prior to the caller actually securing employment -- a violation of the state's
Employment Agency Law.

    "I still believe legislation is needed to eliminate fraud in the booming
900-number industry, but the voluntary procedures formally adopted today are a
step in the right direction," Preate said.

    When an attorney general contacts a carrier about a 900-number promotion
carried on its lines, the procedures provide that the carrier will:

    --   Review and investigate the 900 promotion.

    --   Consider exercising it right to terminate billing and collection
         services.

    --   Consider withholding funds that are due to the service provider to the
         extent allowed under its contract with the provider.

    --   Upon formal legal request, provide detailed information about calls to
         the 900 promotion in question.

    In addition, the carriers will continue reasonable efforts to review
scripts and advertisements of 900 numbers operated through their lines.

    Formal adoption of the voluntary procedures was announced today in
Washington by Tennessee Attorney General Charles W.  Burson, chairman of the
National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) Consumer Protection Committee,
and New Jersey Attorney General Robert J.  Del Tufo, chairman of NAAG's 900
Number Subcommittee.

            Suspect Arrested In Ring That's Disrupting 911 Services
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            [ Courtesy of Richmond Times Dispatch October 10, 1992 ]

    A loose network of computer hackers bent on disrupting emergency 911
services in several parts of the nation - including Chesterfield County - was
penetrated early yesterday.  A Newark, NJ man arrested, Chesterfield police
said.  The hackers call themselves the Legion of Doom, said Capt James P
Bourque, commander of investigations for county police.  For the past three
mounths the group has been tying up some 911 lines in Chesterfield - usually
late on weekend nights, he said.

    Bourque said the arrested suspect a 23 year old man with several alaises
and the last name of Maverick told authorities that the mission of the group is
"to attempt to penetrate 911 computer systems and infect them with virues to
cause havoc." "obviously," Bourque said, "there's a real potential for
disastrous consequences."

    A team of investigators and prosecutors from Chesterfield, New Jersey and
Maryland - in concert with investigators from American Telephone & Telegraph
Co.  and Chesapeake and Potamac Telephone Company of Virgina - traced some of
the hackers and the net closed on three resideneces in two states at 2:am
yesterday, Bourque said.

    Maverick was the only one arrested but other arrests are likely in two
Maryland locations.  Bourque said.  Maverick faces several charges, including
fraud, he added.  Also during the Newark arrest, authorities seized "Computers,
200 pieces of software and three computer devices which being used to penetrate
phone systems belonging to large businessess across the nation."

    He said the investigation is just the beginning.  "Quite honestly, I think
it's only the tip of the iceberg."

    He said the hackers first penetrated the phone lines of large companys or
pay phones, then use those connections to call 911 lines.  To complicate
matters, the hackers usually make confrence calls to other 911 services in
other cities, tying up communication in several locations at the same time.

    "One time we were linked up with Toronto and Los Angeles jurisdictions."
Bourque explained, "And none of use could disconnect."

    Bourque said there would some $100,000 worth of phone calls" generated by
the hackers, Bourque said.

    "I'm sure there are a multitude of other jurisdictions across the country
having the same problems," Said Bourque.

    People Identifying themselves as members of the Legion of Doom have called
WRIC-TV in Richmond and ABC in New York in attempt to get publicity Borque
said.

    So far, he said , Chesterfield 911 phone system hasn't been billed for any
long-distance confrences calls.

    "We have safe guards built into the system to prevent that, and so far, he
added, the calls haven;t tied up enough lines to underminded public safety.

    But he conceded that investigators are up against some "very computer
literate" criminals.

    Maverick, for example, formaly worked for a computer firm, Bourque said.
"Another employee is a former telephone [company] employee."

    Bourque said the lead investigator on the case for Chesterfield - Detective
Duncan Beasly - decribed how difficult it has been to sort out the mess.

    "It's sort of like working a crime that you didn't know what (criminal)
code it comes under.

    Italian thieves have managed to pull off the world's most ingenious cash
card fraud.  A perfect replica of a bank cash dispenser was glued on top of the
real thing and swallowed cards inserted by unsuspecting customers when they
tried to withdraw money.

    Police say that the thieves collected 104 cards before staff at the bank,
in Busto Arsizio, near Milan, were alerted.

    Normally a stolen bank card is useless without the owner's Personal
Identification Number.  But the thieves programmed their fake machine to
request the customers' PIN numbers before telling them the card had been
accidentally demagnetized and was being retained.

    After collecting the cards, the thieves then spent the night withdrawing
money from genuine cash dispensers.

    A police spokesman said: "The thieves have been having a spree, withdrawing
money with the credit cards and the right PIN numbers.  They were obviously
electronics experts."


                         Virus Consumes Clerks At Sears

                [ Courtesy of Risks Forum Digest July 8, 1992 ]

    My mother-in-law is a sales clerk at a Sears store in Everett Washington.
I saw 25 new CompuAdd point-of-sale terminals in the back room.  They're super
techie, with a small CRT, ASCII keyboard, fancy strip printer, and mag card
stripe reader.  They were supposed to be installed months ago, but apparently
they have a dose of the Michaelangelo virus.

    "Michaelangelo?  On a terminal?  Are you sure?" I asked.  Needless to say,
the answer was not too specific.  She said it might also have been on a PC that
configures the terminals, rather than the terminals themselves.  Doesn't
Michaelangelo only strike on one day of the year?  All she knew was that they
were "full of viruses" and could not be installed.

    Sears has its share of troubles these days, and apparently it is running so
lean and mean that there is no one in the store with enough computer smarts to
get things cleared up in the intervening months.  So there they sit,
depreciating.  But they'll *sell* you a computer...If you dare...bwah ha ha!

    And you thought people who knew what viruses are were scared...


             World's First Voting By Phone: June 20 In Nova Scotia
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                [ Courtesy of Risks Forum Digest July 8, 1992 ]

    After an initial failure on June 6, the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia held a
primary June 20 to elect its next leader: 94% of the 7416 delegates voted, all
with touch-tone phones.  Typical turnout for Canadian elections is 60-70%.

    The Liberals were issued Personal Identification Numbers by mail.  For each
of 2 ballots, voters called one of five 900 numbers corresponding to their
choice of leader, and then keyed in their "PIN number".  The computer then
checked their number off so they couldn't vote again.  John Savage won on the
second ballot with almost 53% of the vote.

    The service was provided by Maritime Telephone & Telegraph and cost each
voter 50 cents.  The eight-digit PIN numbers enabled one to vote from any
billable touch-tone phone: if you did't have touch- tone, you'd borrow your
neighbor's.  Absentee voting was as simple as picking up the phone, wherever
you were.

    With this success, the Canadian government is considering a national
referendum by phone on the results of their Constitutional Convention, within 6
months.

    The Federal Voter Assistance Program of the Pentagon is now considering
voting by phone for servicemen, who had voting by fax from the Persian Gulf.
But a $300 fax machine is overkill when a $10 touch-tone phone will do.  The
Program called the Voting by Phone Foundation of Boulder for their initial
information.

    The Voting by Phone Foundation is now in a petition drive to put a charter
amendment on November's Boulder City ballot.  If passed Boulder would become
the first city in the U.S.  to offer the option of phone voting.  Please call
[Evan at] (303)444-3596 to help.

    The Foundation is holding a demonstration of voting by phone from now until
the Noveber 3rd election.  Anyone may call (303)444-3596, 24 hours a day.  If
you are registered to vote in Boulder, you will be asked to enter your last
name and birth date for identification.  This limits you to one vote, although
not as effectively as the random PIN number to be used for real elections.  A
different question will be asked every 2 weeks, and presidential [...  rest
truncated by Evan's mailer?]

    A computer hacker apparently in the New York area broke the code into one
of the Cincinnati, Ohio, phone trunk lines, building up a $65,000 phone bill.
Cincinnati city officials say the unknown invader racked up the charges last
winter and spring by placing calls around the world.

    David Chapman, the city's assistant superintendent for telecommunica-tions,
said that investigators think the tap originated in the New York-New Jersey
area, but they have no suspects and the investigation is considered closed.

    Chapman added, "Apparently these people were pretty darn slick, but talking
to the Secret Service, we were small potatoes.  I understand there have been
some major companies hit."



           Time Magazine Computer Analyst Arrested for Alleged Fraud

                      [ Courtesy of STReport Issue 8.29 ]

    A computer analyst, Thomas Ferguson, 44, who worked at Time magazine's
Tampa, Fla., customer service headquarters has been arrested after allegations
he sold thousands of subscribers' credit card numbers for $1 apiece.  Ferguson
has been with the magazine for 18 months, faces four counts of trafficking in
credit cards, authorities said.

    Police found computer disks containing the credit card numbers of about
80,000 subscribers at Ferguson's Clearwater, Fla., home.  Authorities said they
met Ferguson four times to buy about 3,000 credit card numbers since being
tipped off to the scheme in June.

    Time executives say that all credit card customers should examine their
credit card bills closely.  If unauthorized purchases show up, they should call
the financial institution that issued the card.


             Canadian Regulators Approve Long-Distance Competition
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                 [ Courtesy of The Computer Paper August 1992 ]

    OTTAWA, Ontario, Jun 15 (NB) - Canada's federal telecommunications
regulators have ended a century-old monopoly on long-distance telephone service
across most of the country, approving two applications to offer long-distance
service in competition with established telephone companies.

    Within about a year, telephone subscribes in seven of Canada's 10 provinces
will have at least one will have at least one alternative to the provincial and
regional phone phone companies that until now have controlled all long-distance
traffic.  Competition in at least one of the remaining three provinces is
probably not far behind.

    Major telecommunications users are pleased.  "We're delightfully
surprised," said George Horhota, president of the Canada Business
Telecommunications Alliance (CBTA), a group of major companies using
telecommications services.  "No, that's proably too mild - I guess we're really
ecstatic."

    Others are not so sure.  Philippa Lawson of the Public Interest Advocacy
Centre in Ottawa expressed concern that while the CRTC said it did not expect
the ruling to result in an increase in local rates, it did not other
guarantees.

    The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)
approved an application by Unitel, a Toronto-based provider of data
communications services, to compete with telephone companies in British
Columbia, Ontario, QUebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia,
and Newfoundland.

    When Unitel filed its application in May, 1990, telephone companies in
ALberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba were provincially regulated and thus not
subject to CRTC jurisdiction.  Since then, Alberta has come under federal
regulation, and a Unitel spokesman said the company plans to apply almost at
once to have its mandate extended to that province.

    The CRTC also approved a second application from Lightel, a Toronto
reseller of communications service, and BC Rail Telecommunications of
Vancouver.  This partnership wants to offer competitive long-distance service
in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec - Canada'a three most populus
provinces.

    In granting these two applications, the regulators also sent strong signals
that their vision for long-distance competition in Canada follows the American
model, with a market open to an unlimited number of players, rather than the
present British model, where only two companies operate.

    In the CRTC statement announcing the decision, Louis (Bud) Sherman, who
chaired the hearings, said the regulators had decided that a "policy of open
entry would be the best way to stimulate the benefits of competition.
Conqequently, we will be favorably disposed to future applications filed under
similar circumstances to provide long-distance service if applicants abide by
the terms and conditions established in this decision."

    Horhota praised this aspect of the decision in particular, saying an
open-ended market is needed to encourage all competitors to provide the best
possible service.  "The worst thing that could have happened was that they
authorized a duopoly," he said.  "We don't want just market sharing."

    The CRTC also liberalized the rules governing the resale and sharing of
telecommuications services allowing resellers to offer Wide-Area Telephone
Service (WATS) in all federally regulated provinces and extended the rules that
have governed other federal jurisdictions to Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward Island, and New Brunswick (which came under federal regulation more
recently).

    Peter Janecek, a spokeman for Unitel, said his company will be able to
offer long-distance services to business customers on a limited basis almost
immediately.  The company plans to begin a general rollout of service in about
a year, he said, and within a year from that time hopes to make long-distance
service available to about 65 percent of the people in the provinces it will
serve.  By the end of the second year of service, he added, about 85 percent of
telephone subscribers in the affected provinces should have access to Unitel
service.

    At first, those who want to use competitive services will have to dial
extra digits to tell the telephone systems to route their calls over the Unitel
or BC Rail/Lightel network.  Within a couple of years, Janecek said, telephone
switched will be modified so that subscribers can choose any long-distance
provider and have their calls routed to that network automatically, as happens
now in the United States.

    Lawson questioned the benefits of the decision for residential customers
and those in rural areas.  Most residential customers don't use long-distance
service enough to make a change of service providers worthwhile, she said.  She
added that all competitors will probably concentrate on winning as much as
possible of the long-hual traffic between major urban centres, meaning new
services and discount offerings are unlikely to be made available to those in
smaller towns and rural areas.

    Bell Canada, the largest Canadian phone company with service in Ontario and
Quebec, responded to the announcement with complaints that the rules gave an
unfair advantage to its new competitors.  While the decision requires Unitel
and BC Rail/Lightel to make payments to the regional phone companies to support
local service, Bell said, it does not make them pay their fair share.

    However, a position statement from the office of Bell Canada Chairman and
Chief Executive Jean Monty indicated Bell has no plans to contest the decision.
"I feel like a card player who's been dealt a hand of cards," Monty said in the
statement.  "Now let's play."

    Bell Canada did not respond to a request for further comment by Newsbytes'
deadline.

            King County DA Goes After Alleged Canadian Virus Author
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                [ Courtesy of The Computer Paper October 1992 ]

    SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (NB) - Alleged computer virus author Richard Brandow is
one of four people against whom the King County, Washington district
attorney's office has filed charges.  Brandow is reportedly a former Canadian
computer-magazine publisher who know writes for the television series "Star
Trek" but who is accused of writing a Macintosh virus which infected software
disks distributed by commercial software company Aldus.  The infection of the
Aldus software disks occurred in 1988 and Brandow is charged with malicious
mischief as the alleged author of the virus software program that infected the
disks.

    While the Associated Press reported Brandow received an award from the
Canadian Software Association, who said his virus encouraged people to stop
making pirated copies of software and buy it instead, Aldus doesn't seem to
appreciate Brandow's reported efforts.  Aldus filed a complaint with the King
County DA's office four years ago when the infection occurred.  The company said it had to recall five to seven thousand copies of its FreeHand software,
which cost it $7,800, but more importantly it incurred intangible losses in its
reputation.

    Mark Cantor, former president of Macromind, was allegedly the direct source
of the Aldus infection, King County Assistant Prosecutor, Ivan Orton, told
Newsbytes.  When asked what the DA's office could do if Brandow refuses to show
up for a hearing to be held next Friday, Orton said the next step is to request
a warrant for his arrest and contact the state department to see if the U.S.
agreement with Canada allows extradition for malicious mischief.  If not,
Brandow's information will be place into the National Crime Information
computer network and if he enters the U.S. and is apprehended he can be held
and delivered to Washington, Oroton said.  Orton said Brandow seems to be quite
vocal and he is welcome to use the trial as a stage from which to speak.
However, the downside is if the audience in a trial disagrees with you, you can
go to jail, Orton quipped.

    When asked why wait four years, Orton said the King County prosecutors
office has filed criminal charges against four individuals in four separate
cases, three of which involve employers and employees.  The hope here was to
take the emphasis off computer viruses and place it on computer crime, where it
belongs, Orton added.  The other three cases include an ex-employee who
allegedly place a date bomb in his employer's computer system; a government
employee who allegedly got into area of the Washington State computer system
where he could have issued checks and fixed traffic tickets; and an employee of
Asymmetrix who after being terminated, allegedly copied the engine for some
multimedia software under development and tried to start her own software
company.

videoconferencing market with Vist Cideo, a desktop videoconferencing product
for Apple Macintosh and DOS machines.  Northern also unveiled Visit Voice,
call-management software that it will offer as part of Visit Video as well as
separately.

    Visit Video will permit two-way desktop videoconferencing over
56-kilobit-per-second lines linking Apple Macintosh computers and/or IBM and
compatible PCs running the DOS operating systems and Microsoft Windows 3.0 or
later.

    For the future, Northern is promising a version of Visit Video for IBm's
OS/2 operating system and support for color videoconferences.  Multipoint
conferncing is also "a future possibility," company spokeswoman MaryLynn
Hillier told Newsbytes.

    Vist Video will let participants in a videoconference see each other on
their computer screens.  FUll screen-sharing and file-reansfer capabilities
will be added early 1993, Northern said.

    The software conforms to Intergrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
standards, expected to be implemented across North America later this year,
Northern said.  It also works with private branch exchanges and switching
equipment from Northern Telecom and other vendors.

    The Macintosh version of Visit Video is available now to a limited extent,
Hillier said.  The DOS version is due to be available in September.  The
complete package, including software, video board, and cabling, will cost
C$3,750.

    Visit Vioce, a call-management tool that lets users dial, set up
directories, log phone calls, and track usage, will be available separately for
less that $300, Hillier said.

    QUEBEC CITY, QUEBEC (NB) - Centre d'ordinateurs Microbec, a chain of four
computer stores, has been handed the largest software-copyright fine in the
province's history.  The company was fined C$63,000 for selling computers
loaded with illegal copies of the MS-DOS operating system.

    The fine is not the worst of it for Microbec.  When the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police raided the company last October, they seized about 140 computers
carrying the illegal software as evidence.  Since the company was convicted,
the seized hardware will not be returned, said Allan Reynolds, manager of the
Canadian Alliance Against Software Theft (CAAST), a Toronto-based group of
major software vendors set up to fight software piracy.  Reynolds said the
value of the seized computers is "more than double the fine amount in terms
of revenue value."

    It could have been worse, though: the Copyright Act allows for fines of as
much as $1 million or imprisonment for up to five years in cases of this type.
Charges against the mangers of three Microbec stores have been dropped, and
charges against the company's owner, Guy Painchaud, will be dropped as long as
the fine is paid by January 18, 1995, CAAST said.

    CAAST's members are Autodesk Canada, Borland Canada, Lotus Development
Canada, Microsoft Canada, Novell Canada, and Quarterdeck Canada.  Reynolds said
the group hopes to announce the signing of another major software vendor in the
next couple of months.

    Phone box cheats known as "bottom-end ticklers" are ripping off thousands
of punds from BT.  They use a six-inch wire with a hook on the end - similar to
a metal coathangar - to dial the world for free.

    One of the fiddlers, a man called Abdul who lives in Birmingham, boasted
yesterday: "I ring my family back home in the Middle East nearly every day.
All my friends do it to make free call, too.

    "I don't know anybody who actually pays for phone calls any more.  "This
must be costing BT tens of thousands a year."


              Angry Callers Help Convict Man Behind Beeper Scheme
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              [ Courtesy of The Milwaukee Mirror August 16, 1992 ]

    NEW YORK, N.Y.  - A Manhattan man has been convicted of leaving messages on
thousands of beepers for a telephone number that cost $55 to call.  While the
defendant, Michael Brown, 23, never made a dime, prosecutors said he stood to
make millions before he was caught last year.  They said he tried to defraud
thousand of potential victims.

    US Atty.  Otto Obermaier said Brown hooked up two computers in his
apartment and then attached them to two telephone lines.  On one line, the
computer placed more than 4,000 calls a day to pagers that people carry with
them.  A message said that a return call for telephone-based informational
services should be made to a special 540 number on Brown's second line tied to
the second computer.

    What the unsuspecting people who returned the calls were not advised is
that it would cost them $55 a call, in violation of a New York State Public
Service Commission regulation requiring operators of toll numbers to advise
incoming callers of the cost so they can hang up before being charged.  But
Brown devised a scheme in which the computer kept callers on the line for at
least 20 seconds, the time required so they could be billed for $55 by the
telephone company.

    In a six-day period in February 1991, the first computer spewed out a total
of 26,000 calls.  But the fraud did not last long because irate subscribers
inundated New York Telephone with complaints of the $55 charge.  By the time
the company notified federal prosecutors and disconnected Brown's two lines, he
had billed a total of $198,000.  But prosecutors said that he never collected a
dime, and that New York Telephone made no efforts to collect the bills.  After
his conviction last week, Brown faces up to five years in prison and a fine of
$250,000 when he is sentenced on Oct.  28.  He is free on $30,000 bail.


            The '087' service is like the 900 service in the USA --
                    mainly sleezy numbers for lonely people
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                [ Courtesy of The Pretoria News July 23, 1992 ]

    One of beleagured Telkom's main problems appears to be a lack of the high
technology needed to support the controversial 087 service,.  Consumers, faced
with ever increasing phone bills, continue to demand detailed billing in order
to establish exact charges on their bills.  The discontinuation of a
subscriber's telephone service due to non-payment of the 087 charges is also a
bone of contention.

    There is legislation in the US preventing telephone companies from
disconnecting a customer's basic telephone service for failure to pay 087
service charges.  However, South African consumers are not so lucky.  Telkom,
at this stage, lacks the ability to separate 087 calls and other telephone
charges.

    This means if a consumer disputes charges on a telephone bill, he does not
have the option of paying only for normal telephone calls without losing his
telephone line.

    Neither do comsumers have the right to dispute charges for 087 calls and to
have these charges removed from the telephone bill.  Telkom also pays 087
service providers before collecting from the consumers, so Telkom carries all
bad debt arising if consumers fail to pay high telehone bills.

    Testimony in a Senate Committee hearing in the US last year again indicated
there was almost universal support for the requirement that consumers have the
right to block 087 services (in the USA = 900).  This service is provided free
of charge at least once on request.  South Africans will soon be able to block
087 calls on their service -- but at a price.  It will cost people on an
electro-mechanical exchange R20 (about $8) to block the service.  A Telkom
spokesman said the older electro-mechanical exchanges were not capable of
recording details of calls made.  Furthermore, the computer network needed for
detailed billing was not available.


                        New Ads Heat up AT&T-MCI Rivalry
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               [ Courtesy of The Washington Times July 21, 1992 ]

    AT&T and MCI's war of words is getting personal.

    The newest TV commercials for AT&T's long distance rates attack the ethics
behind MCI's recent spots promoting a new international calling plan.

    American Telephone & Telegraph Co.  says MCI used unfair comparisons to
claim savings of 45 percent or more off AT&T's rates.  MCI Communications Corp
matched its "Around the World" discount rates against AT&T's basic rates,
rather than its cheaper "Reach Out World" discount plan for international
calls.

    "Blatantly deceptive," said AT&T spokesman Jim McGann on behalf of the
nation's biggest long-distance company.

    "Fair," countered Debra Shriver of Washington-based MCI, the No.  2
carrier.

    Most AT&T customers make their international calls on the company's basic
plan, not "Reach Out World," Ms.  Shriver insisted.  Besides, she said, most of
AT&T's advertised discounts compare with AT&T's basic rates.

    "If they've been comparing their own rates to [basic] dial-1 rates, why
can't we do it?" she said.

    "How can that be fair?" Mr.  McGann said of the MCI ads.  "You've got to
compare comparable plan to comparable plan.  If someone makes a lot of
international calls, it would make sense for them to sign up for 'Reach Out
World'.

    For example, an MCI spot claims a call to France on its new plan would save
57 percent against AT&T's basic rate.  Part of that savings comes from
designating one foreign number as part of MCI's "Friends & Family" plan.

    For any other numbers in France, AT&T says, the savings against its
international discount plan would be 1.6 percent.

    Stoking the fires, Mr.  McGann called reporters yesterday about his
company's ads, which first aired over the weekend.  AT&T also provided
videotapes and transcripts.

    AT&T and MCI have never hidden their mutual dislike.  MCI helped hasten the
breakup of the telephone monopoly with antitrust lawsuits in the 1970s.  And in
1989 the two companies sued each other with claims of unfair advertising.  They
settled out of court.

    MCI has always compared its rates with AT&T's, even erecting electronic
toteboards to show the supposed savings MCI's customers have enjoyed over AT&T
users.  The latter's commercials have jabbed at MCI's popular "Friends &
Family" plan, in which MCI callers get extra savings if they sign up other
customers.  Sprint, No.  3 in the long-distance market, has taken on both
rivals.

    But the new AT&T ads aim squarely at MCI's credibility.

    "Do you judge a company's ethics by their advertising?" an off-camera voice
asks a man in an antique restoration shop in one spot.  Answering more
questions, the man says the MCI ads promise 50 percent savings through "Friends
Around the World" but says he did not realize the savings wer off AT&T's basic
rate.

    Why doesn't the MCI advertising compare discount plans?  "I think the
answer is obvious," the man replies.

    In another commercial, a woman says the advertising would change her
opinion about the advertiser.

    Ms.  Shriver said MCI stands by its ads and has no plans to change them or
lob an attack back at AT&T.


              Sprint Announces A Commercial Data Internet Service
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               [ Courtesy of The Washington Times July 21, 1992 ]

    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 1992 -- Sprint today announced commercial
availability of SprintLink(sm), the first commercial Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-based data transmission service offered by
a national long distance carrier.  SprintLink is a router-based network
supporting the TCP/IP protocol suite for data communications.

    SprintLink is part of the company's expanding service to the business,
scientific and research communities.  It complements Sprint's frame relay and
SprintNet(R) (X.25) services for computer and local area network (LAN)
interconnection.  SprintLink also provides access to the Internet, a group of
about 8,000 interconnected data networks in more than 80 countries serving
government, academic and research organizations.

    "SprintLink demonstrates the benefits of technological collaboration
between government and industry," said Chris Rooney, president, Government
Systems Division.  "The extension of this new service will generate commercial
applications and will help American business and government be more productive
and creative."

    SprintLink grew from Sprint's expertise in TCP/IP and international
networking.  In early 1991, Sprint began providing and managing a network to
link the National Science Foundation's U.S.  computer communications network
(NSFnet) with the French scientific and research network, INRIA, at
Sophia-Antipoles in southern France, and the Scandinavian scientific and
research network, NORDUNet, in Stockholm.

    Sprint has since added to its NSFnet interconnections links to Japan and
the United Kingdom.  Additional connections are currently planned to South
Africa and to numerous Latin American and Caribbean countries.

    In February, Sprint introduced SprintLink to government agencies.  Since
that introduction, SprintLink has attracted more than a half-dozen major
customers.

    During the next year, Sprint plans to add gateways to Sprint's X.25 public
data network, SprintNet, to allow SprintNet users to access SprintLink, both
nationally and internationally.  Sprint will also connect its frame relay
service to SprintLink thus allowing Sprint's frame relay customers access to
the global Internet and to enable management of routers connected to Sprint's
frame relay in an integrated manner.  Sprint plans to offer SprintLink on a
dial-up basis.

    SprintLink is accessible via dedicated lines from all of the company's
270-plus domestic points-of-presence.  Customers can access the service at
speeds ranging from 9.6 kbps to T1 (1.5 mbps).  Customers also can maximize use
of a T1 line by combining multiple voice and data services, including
SprintLink, on that line, a feature available only through Sprint.  SprintLink
is priced at a flat monthly rate according to port speed for each location.

    Sprint is a member of the board of directors of the Commercial Internet
Exchange (CIX) Association, a cooperative effort among public data internetwork
(PDI) service providers to promote the fair, open and competitive operations of
IP-based networking.  Other members include General Atomics, which operates
CERFnet; Performance Systems International, Inc., which operates PSINet; and
UUNET Technologies, Inc., which operates AlterNET.

    Sprint is a diversified international telecommunications company with $8.9
billion in annual revenues and the United States' only nationwide all-digital,
fiber-optic network.  Its divisions provide global long distance voice, data
and video products and services, and local telephone services to more than 4
million subscriber lines in 17 states.


                       Controversial Telemarketer Woos MP
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy Of Toronto Computes July, 1992]

    Bell Canada is trying to put the squeeze on a Toronto telemarketer who has
allied himself with a local Member of Parliament.

    Responding to a barrage of complaints from customers, Bell has asked the
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for rules
restricting those who conduct ad campaigns through massive telephone
autodialing.  Automatic dialing is controlled by a series of PCs linked to
hundreds of phone lines.

    The target of the complaints is Marvin Fine, an engineer who calls himself
the King of Auto-dialing.  Through his company DFD Telebroadcasting, Fine has
inundated the Toronto area with recorded messages--hundreds of thousands of
calls a day--promising high-paying jobs, credit cards for those with no credit
rating, books that teach you how to make money by watching TV and other unusual
offerings.  Fine earns $1 million a year from his various businesses.

    His auto-dialing blitz has prompted numerous complaints to members of
Parliament, the Better Business Bureau, Bell Canada, the CRTC and the Canadian
Direct Marketing Association.  Toronto Computes!  has learned that Bell made
the proposal to the CRTC largely because of complaints about Fine.  In June the
Globe and Mail quoted a Bell vice president that "an unnamed Toronto
telemarketer was a particular nuisance, prompting 'thousands' of calls." A
person who asked not to be identified confirmed that Fine is the unnamed
telemarketer.

    Last winter Fine's operations were characterized as a "con job" by noted
writer Pierre Berton in two columns in the Toronto Star.  Now Fine has extended
his operations to politics, donating his technology to help raise money and
support for Liberal Dennis Mills, MP for Broadview-Greenwood.  Mills is
promoting a flat-tax scheme similar to that of former California Governor Jerry
Brown, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

    Fine's activities may soon be severely curtailed if Bell gets the CRTC to
adopt its plan.  Bell wants to give any customer the right to join a "do not
call" list.  Bell would disconnect the lines of any telemarketer who persisted
in calling people on the list.  A decision from the CRTC is expected toward the
end of August.  In February Bell responded to customer complaints by
disconnecting more than 300 phone lines from Fine's offices.  However, some of
Fine's phone lines remained in operation just outside Metro Toronto.  As well,
he still has ten lines in North York spewing out faxes for his various
promotions.

    One fax reads, "100 drivers needed, earn up to $18.50 per hour, good
command of the English language not required." Anyone interested is asked to
call 1-416-976-2273.  The bottom corner of the fax reads, "$2.00 min./5 min.
minimum".

    The fax features an illustration with sketches of people resembling
sketches in an ad for Computer Fest (see accompanying article in box).

    The 976 exchange allows Fine to charge $10 to anyone phoning for
information.  The $10 is deducted from the caller's phone bill, of which Bell
remits about $9 to Fine, while Bell keeps the rest.  For the $10, the caller
gets to use a push-button phone to choose one of a menu of messages.  One
message tells you how to earn up to $18.50 an hour handing out pamphlets.  In
fact, said a source, those who hand out pamphlets seldom earn half that much.
Only those who can distribute pamphlets at a superhuman speed can earn $18.50
an hour, she said.

    Another message tells the caller about a book that can teach you how to get
a credit card, even if you're bankrupt or have a bad credit rating.

    The credit-card pamphlet costs an additional $10, and is a thin photocopied
document that looks hand-stapled.  The pamphlet, bearing the name Marvin Fine,
explains why some people can't get credit cards.  It advises those who are
unemployed to get a job or get a credit guarantee from someone who has a good
credit rating.  Another offering from Fine is a "Vista Gold Credit card"
(that's Vista, not Visa), a promotion savaged in the Toronto Star by Pierre
Berton.

    "It isn't a credit card at all, it's an invitation to order from a
catalogue full of merchandise.  It costs $10 to order the card, and another $40
to order the catalogue.  Marvin can't lose." MP not bothered

    The torrent of complaints and criticisms don't bother MP Dennis Mills.  "I
know that there's lot of stories out there about Marvin Fine but I'm not
involved in his business," he told Toronto Computes!  "Some of his work has
been closed down, sure, but there's lots of people that have been shut down."

    In an earlier interview Mills said he was happy to be the first politician
in Canada to use auto-dialing.

    Mills's recorded message on the flat-tax scheme is short and invites the
recipient to hang up if they don't want to listen to his ideas.  In a flat-tax
system, all taxpayers would pay the same rate, say 25 per cent, regardless of
income.

    The tax reform message goes out daily over 82 lines.  Mills had hoped to
place about 100,000 calls a day.  However, he's only been getting out about
30,000 to 60,000, but he said that's good.  "It means people are listening to
the whole message without hanging up."

    Mills was approached with the idea by Fine who sympathized with Mills's tax
reform crusade and offered his calling system for free.  "It would cost Dennis
$18,000 a month if he was paying for it," Fine said in an earlier interview.

    Mills said that Fine told him he could talk to a million people a week
through autodialing.

    "Can you imagine saying that to a politician?  Geez, if I can talk to 50
people at a town hall meeting, that's pretty good." Fine and his brother Ed
spent seven years and $1.5 million developing the system, called Power Calling,
which runs under DOS and contains about 200,000 lines of programming code.
According to a DFD spokesperson, if you don't want to receive recorded calls,
you can phone DFD and have your number removed from the company's database.

    But DFD does not adhere to a large do-not-call list compiled by the
Canadian Direct Marketing Association which represents 700 telemarketers in
Canada.  All members of the CDMA refrain from calling the 115,000 people who
have had their names entered on the list.  DFD is not a member of the CDMA
which is backing Bell's proposal to the CRTC.

    CDMA spokesperson Christina Sears said the CDMA is "very aware" of Fine
because it has had "a number of complaints about him.  We've had a number of
discussions with Bell Canada on exactly what to do about him."

    Sears said most telemarketers are honest.  "The vast majority of
telemarketing is above board, and people don't have a problem with it.  But one
or two operators cause all the problems for everybody and gives the industry a
bad name."

    She said 75 per cent of telemarketing is company-to-company or involves an
existing relationship, such as a bank calling a customer to remind them it's
RSP time.


                   Nova Scotia Tele-Voting Has Chaotic Debut
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy Of Toronto Computes July, 1992]

    After a few weeks of chaos, the Nova Scotia Liberal party elected a new
leader--by phone.  Using a 1-900 number, 7,000 Nova Scotia Liberals stayed at
home and chose Dartmouth mayor John Savage who won by 300 votes on the second
ballot.  All Nova Scotia Liberals were entitled to vote.

    During the first vote on June 6, the main computer crashed, forcing
embarrassed party leaders to suspend the tele-convention.  It's the first time
a political leader has been chosen by remote control.  Maritime Telegraph and
Telephone Company calls it "tele-democracy".

    Colin Latham, MT&T vice president of business services, says the first vote
failed because there were too many phone lines doing too much at once, and not
enough memory to handle the task.  When all 216 input ports roared at once, the
computer "crashed virtually instantaneously."

    In the successful run two weeks later, the phone ports were cut to 100,
prevnting overload.  As well, memory capacity was doubled.

    Tele-voting is not new, but it's never before been used for politics.  In
the past it's helped canvass the viewing public on a variety of opinions--which
b-movie to run on pay TV, whether Eric Lindros should be forced to play in
Quebec City or whether Sunday shopping will mark the end of civilization.
Televoting usually costs each participant a 50-cent surcharge on the phone
bill.  Tele-democracy phone-ins involve Personal Identification Numbers, or
PINs.  The voter calls in, listens to a message and when prompted, punches in
an eight-digit PIN.

    When the vote is registered by the computer, it deletes the PIN and the
voter rushes back to TV screen to see whether the electoral tide has turned.

    If Ontario political parties are eyeing the Nova Scotia experiment, they'll
have to wait.  Bell Canada doesn't have the capabilities for it, nor does it
have any plans to develop them in the near future, said Wendy Neuberg, an
associate director of product management with Bell.

    In Nova Scotia, the idea was hatched by a couple of Latham's employees who
had some ties with the Nova Scotia Liberal association.  They knew the party
convention was approaching and saw it as a chance to put the package together.
"We felt this was an exciting opportunity to go ahead with and promote the idea
of tele-democracy," Latham says.  "It's definitely a pioneering effort."

    Many futurists hail computers and the phone network as modern society's
ultimate method of democratic empowerment, a way to achieve Athenian democracy
on a massive scale.


             Long-Distance Competition Here to Stay, Regulator Says
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                   [ Courtesy Of Toronto Star July 14, 1992 ]

    Canada's major telephone companies must continue preparing for
long-distance competition even while they're fighting the move in the courts,
the industry's regulator says.

    Four telephone companies, including Bell Canada, had asked the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for more time to file
certain information with the federal agency.

    But the commission yesterday said no.

    "As far as the commission is concerned, its decision is in force until the
courts or federal cabinet say otherwise," said Bill Allen, CRTC
director-general of information.

    In a landmark ruling last month, the CRTC ended the telephone companies'
historic monopoly on the lucrative long-distance business in seven provinces by
granting two competitors the rights to enter the market.

    Contrary to the telephone companies' position, the move would reduce
long-distance rates without boosting local telephones bills, the commission
ruled.

    Five of the telephones companies affected have appealed to the Federal
Court of Canada to alter some of the terms and conditions for the competitors'
entry into the market.

    The dispute is over how much the competitors should pay the telephone
companies to subsidize the money-losing local service, and how much of the the
cost of interconnection should be borne by the big utilites.

    Along with Bell Canada, they include BC Tel, Maritime Tel, Island Tel and
Newfoundland Tel.

    As well, three unions representing telephone company employees have said
they will appeal the decision to the federal cabinet.

    The federal court is expected to rule next week whether to hear the appeal.
If granted, the appeal itself could take several months.

    In the meantime, the telephone companies argued, they should be spared the
effort and expense of provising the industry regulator with certain information
about the cost and method of linking up with their new competitors.

    Their main competitor, meanwhile, is forging ahead with its plans to offer
a long-distance alternative within 12 months.


                    Police Say They've Got Hackers' Numbers
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Hackers, take note.  Metro police and Ma Bell are going to get you.

    A yound North York computer freak accused of launching 10 false medical
alerts to 911 this summer may have learned - the hard way - that his telephone
tricks weren't beating the pros.

    Police arrived with a serach warrant at the home of the 15-year-old on
Monday, arrested him and carted away his computer.

    He's charged with 10 counts of conveying false messages, 24 counts of
mischief, and theft of telecommunications.

    Inspector Bill Holdridge, of 911 emergency services, said the false alarms
in July and August never posed any technical problem to his switch board but
resulted in wild goose chases for the police, fire and ambulance services.

    "Those resources weren't available for real alarms, which could have been a
serious problem," Holdridge said.

    The 911 service, quarted at 590 Javis St., gets about 7,000 calls a day, of
which 30 per cent warrant some kind of emergency response.

    Normally, a computerized tracing system takes only seconds to provide the
address and number of the telephone from which a calls through several US
networks before bringing them back to Toronto.

    Detective Willie Johnston said the boy's parents were stunned when police
arrived.  "They really didn't have a clue what was going on," said Johnston.

    The false emergencies reported were nowhere near the accused boy's home.
"Without condoning it, you could understand it if were sitting around the
corner watching the flashing lights," said Johnston.  "But they weere miles
away.  It defies logic."

    Neither Johnston nor Holdridge would explain how they and Bell security
finally traced the false alarms.

    A 15-year old computer hacker has been arrested for pulling computer pranks
that paralyzed Metro's emergency 911 service.

    Police with Metro's major crime unit investigated the origin of countless
phony calls placed to the 911 service in July from somewhere in west Metro.

    On one occasion the computer hacker managed to tie up the entire 911
service in Metro - making it unavailable for true emergencies.

    Bell Canada investigators helped police to trace the origin of the calls
and officers yesterday charged a North York boy, who cannot be named under the
Yound Offenders Act, with 24 counts of mischief and 10 counts of converying
false messages.

    OTTAWA (CP) - Unitel Communications Inc, says it world lose $588 million in
revenues if its entry into the long-distance telephone market is delayed by six
months.

    The company makes the claim in court documents filed in opposition to Bell
Canada's application for a stay of an order requiring Bell and five other phone
companies to provide interconnection to their public long-distance networks.

    The Federal Court of Appeal will hear arguments Tuesday and Wednesday on
whether to grant Bell's application.

    A stay would delay implementation of a June 12 ruling by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Communications Commission that ended
the phone companies' century-old, long-distance monopoly.

    Unitel needs access to phone companies' local networks to reach telephone
subscribers so it can provide competitive long-distance service.

    Unitel fears even a six-month delay in getting connected to local- networks
will leave it at a competitive disadvantage that will last for years.


             US Phone Furms Win Rights to Deliver Cable TV Signals

    WASHINGTON (Reuter) - In a move that could transform the television
industry, the Federal Communications Commission voted yesterday to allow
regional telephone companies to use their lines to bring cable TV into
consumers' homes.

    The decision, along with another vote allowing the phone companies to own a
portion of the programs they would deliver, is likely to provide powerful new
competition to existing cable operators, most of which hold effective
monopolies in the areas they serve.

    It also opens a huge business sector to the regional phone companies.

    In a separate action, the commission also took the first steps towards
setting rules for licensing of high definition television and personal
communications devices such as pocket telephones and wireless fax machines.

    Commission chairman Alfred Sikes said the potentially landmark votes
"constitute truly critical components . . . of what futurists have called a
'glittering communications mosaic.'"

    The commission voted 5 to 0 to allow phone companies to provide cable
service, and 3 to 2 to allow them to own as much as 5 per center of the
programming.


              AT&T Launches Program To Combat Long-Distance Theft
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            [ Courtesy Of United Press International May 13, 1992 ]

    Citing the mushrooming cost of long-distance telephone fraud, American
Telephone & Telegraph Co.  announced plans to combat theft of long-distance
telephone services from customers.

    AT&T's program, dubbed NetProtect, is an array of software, consulting,
customer education and monitoring services for businesses.  One program limits
customer liability to the first $25,000 of theft, while another ends customer
liability entirely under certain circumstances.

    By law, companies are liable for the cost of calls made on their systems,
authorized or not.

    Jerre Stead, president of AT&T's Business Communications unit, said, "The
program not only offers financial relief to victims of long-distance fraud.  It
also gives our customers new products and services specifically designed to
prevent and detect fraud."

    Long-distance calling fraud ranges from a few dollars to the undreds of
thousands of dollars for victims.  The Communications Fraud Control
Association, an industry group, estimates long- distance calling fraud costs
more than $1 billion a year, said Peggy Snyder, an association spokeswoman.

    NetProtect Basic Service, offered free with long-distance and domestic 800
service, consists of ongoing monitoring around the clock for unusual activity.

    The company will start this service this week.

    NetProtect Enhanced and Premium services offer more customized monitoring
and limit customer liability to $25,000 per incident or none at all, depending
on the program selected.

    Pricing and permission to provide the Enhanced and Premium services are
dependent on Federal Communication Commission approval.  AT&T expects to offer
these programs beginning August 1.

    Other offerings are a $1,995 computer software package called "Hacker
Tracker," consulting services and the AT&T Fraud Intervention Service, a swat
team of specialists who will detect and stop fraud while it is in progress.

    The company also will provide a Security Audit Service that will consult
with customers on possible security risks.  Pricing will be calculated on a
case-by-case basis, depending on complexity.

    The least expensive option for customers is AT&T's Security Handbook and
Training, a self-paced publication available for $65 which trains users on
security features for AT&T's PBX, or private branch exchanges, and voice mail
systems.

    Fraud occurs through PBX systems, which are used to direct the external
telephone calls of a business.

    Company employees use access codes and passwords to gain entry to their PBX
system.  A typical use, the industry fraud group's Snyder said, would be a
sales force on the road calling into their home offices for an open line to
call other customers nationally or worldwide.

    These access codes can be stolen and used to send international calls
through the company's network, billable to the company.

    Unauthorized access to PBXs occur when thieves use an automatic dialing
feature in home computers to dial hundreds of combinations of phone numbers
until they gain access to a company's PBX system.

    These thieves, also known as hackers, phone freaks or phrackers, then make
their own calls through the PBX system or sell the number to a third party to
make calls.

    Others use automatic dialing to break into PBX systems through voice mail
systems because such systems have remote access features.

    Calls from cellular phones also are at risk if they are remotely accessed
to a PBX.  Electronic mail systems for intracompany calls are not affected
because they don't require PBX systems.

    According to Bob Neresian of AT&T, most fraud involves long-distance calls
to certain South American and Asian countries, especially Columbia and
Pakistan.

    There is no profile of a typical company at risk for telephone fraud, said
Snyder.

    "Any company of any size with long-distance service is at risk," she said.
"Criminals don't care who the long distance provider is or how big the company
they're stealing from is."

    She said the industry recognized the dimensions of telephone theft in 1985,
when the Communications Fraud Control Association was formed in Washington D.C.
The group consists of providers of long-distance service, operator services,
private payphones, end-users of PBX systems, federal, state and local law
enforcement agencies and prosecutors.

    Janice Langley, a spokeswoman for US Sprint Corp.  in Kansas City, Mo.,
called AT&T's announcement similar to a program her company announced March 31.

    That service, SprintGuard Plus, is available to companies with a call
volume of $30,000 a month.  Sprint also offers basic monitoring program to
customers without charge.

    "We don't have minimum billing requirements for any of these services or
systems," responded AT&T's Neresian.  "All the carriers have seen the problem
and have been working on their own approaches," he said.

    Jim Collins, a spokesman for MCI Communications in Washington, said his
company had been conducting phone fraud workshops free of charge for customers
for four years.


   Group of "Computer Hackers" Indicted; First Use of Wiretaps in Such a Case
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            [ Courtesy Of United Press International July 8, 1992 ]

             212-791-1978, of the Office of the U.S. Attorney, Southern
             District of New York; or Betty Conkling of the U.S. Secret
             Service, 212-466-4400; or Joseph Valiquette Jr.  of the Federal
             Bureau of Investigation, 212-335-2715

    NEW YORK, July 8 /U.S.  Newswire/ -- A group of five "computer hackers" has
been indicted on charges of computer tampering, computer fraud, wire fraud,
illegal wiretapping, and conspiracy, by a federal grand jury in Manhattan,
resulting from the first investigative use of court-authorized wiretaps to
obtain conversations and data transmissions of computer hackers.

    A computer hacker is someone who uses a computer or a telephone to obtain
unauthorized access to other computers.

    The indictment, which was filed today, alleges that Julio Fernandez, a/k/a
"Outlaw," John Lee, a/k/a "Corrupt," Mark Abene, a/k/a "Phiber Optik," Elias
Ladopoulos, a/k/a "Acid Phreak," and Paul Stira, a/k/a "Scorpion," infiltrated
a wide variety of computer systems, including systems operated by telephone
companies, credit reporting services, and educational institutions.

    According to Otto G.  Obermaier, United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, James E.  Heavey, special agent in charge, New York Field
Division, United States Secret Service, William Y.  Doran, special agent in
charge, Criminal Division, New York Field Division, Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and Scott Charney, chief of the Computer Crime Unit of the
Department of Justice, the indictment charges that the defendants were part of
a closely knit group of computer hackers self-styled "MOD," an acronym used
variously for "Masters of Disaster" and "Masters of Deception" among other
things.  The indictment alleges that the defendants broke into computers "to
enhance their image and prestige among other computer hackers; to harass and
intimidate rival hackers and other people they did not like; to obtain
telephone, credit, information and other services without paying for them; and
to obtain passwords, account numbers and other things of value which they could
sell to others." The defendants are also alleged to have used unauthorized
passwords and billing codes to make long distance telephone calls and to be
able to communicate with other computers for free.

    Some of the computers that the defendants allegedly broke into were
telephone switching computers operated by Southwestern Bell, New York
Telephone, Pacific Bell, U.S.  West and Martin Marietta Electronics Information
and Missile Group.  According to the indictment, such switching computers each
control telephone service for tens of thousands of telephone lines.  In some
instances, the defendants allegedly tampered with the computers by adding and
altering calling features.  In some cases, the defendants allegedly call
forwarded local numbers to long distance numbers and thereby obtained long
distance services for the price of a local call.  Southwestern Bell is alleged
to have incurred losses of approximately $370,000 in 1991 as a result of
computer tampering by defendants Fernandez, Lee, and Abene.

    The indictment also alleges that the defendants gained access to computers
operated by BT North America, a company that operates the Tymnet data transfer
network.  The defendants were allegedly able to use their access to Tymnet
computers to intercept data communications while being transmitted through the
network, including computer passwords of Tymnet employees.  On one occasion,
Fernandez and Lee allegedly intercepted data communications on a network
operated by the Bank of America.

    The charges also allege that the defendants gained access to credit and
information services including TRW, Trans Union and Information America.  The
defendants allegedly were able to obtain personal information on people
including credit reports, telephone numbers, addresses, neighbor listings and
social security numbers by virtue of their access to these services.  On one
occasion Lee and another member of the group are alleged to have discussed
obtaining information from another hacker that would allow them to alter credit
reports on TRW.  As quoted in the indictment, Lee said that the information he
wanted would permit them "to destroy people's lives ...  or make them look like
saints."

    The indictment further charges that in November 1991, Fernandez and Lee
sold information to Morton Rosenfeld concerning how to access credit services.
The indictment further alleges that Fernandez later provided Rosenfeld's
associates with a TRW account number and password that Rosenfeld and his
associates used to obtain approximately 176 TRW credit reports on various
individuals.  (In a separate but related court action, Rosenfeld pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to use and traffic in account numbers of TRW.  See below).

    According to Stephen Fishbein, the assistant United States attorney in
charge of the prosecution, the indictment also alleges that members of MOD
wiped out almost all of the information contained within the Learning Link
computer operated by the Educational Broadcasting Corp.  (WNET Channel 13) in
New York City.  The Learning Link computer provided educational and
instructional information to hundreds of schools and teachers in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut.  Specifically, the indictment charges that on Nov.  28,
1989, the information on the Learning Link was destroyed and a message was left
on the computer that said: "Happy Thanksgiving you turkeys, from all of us at
MOD" and which was signed with the aliases "Acid Phreak," "Phiber Optik," and
"Scorpion." During an NBC News broadcast on Nov.  14, 1990, two computer
hackers identified only by the aliases "Acid Phreak" and "Phiber Optik" took
responsibility for sending the "Happy Thanksgiving" message.

    Obermaier stated that the charges filed today resulted from a joint
investigation by the United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.  "This is the first federal investigation ever to use
court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of
computer hackers," said Obermaier.  He praised both the Secret Service and the
FBI for their extensive efforts in this case.  Obermaier also thanked the
Department of Justice Computer Crime Unit for their important assistance in the
investigation.  Additionally, Obermaier thanked the companies and institutions
whose computer systems were affected by the defendants' activities, all of whom
cooperated fully in the investigation.

    Fernandez, age 18, resides at 3448 Steenwick Ave., Bronx, New York.  Lee
(also known as John Farrington), age 21, resides at 64A Kosciusco St.
Brooklyn, New York.  Abene, age 20, resides at 94-42 Alstyne Ave., Queens, New
York.  Elias Ladopoulos, age 22, resides at 85-21 159th St., Queens, New York.
Paul Stira, age 22, resides at 114-90 227th St., Queens, New York.  The
defendants' arraignment has been scheduled for July 16, at 10 a.m.  in
Manhattan federal court.

    The charges contained in the indictment are accusations only and the
defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Fishbein
stated that if convicted, each of the defendants may be sentenced to a maximum
of five years imprisonment on the conspiracy count.  Each of the additional
counts also carries a maximum of five years imprisonment, except for the count
charging Fernandez with possession of access devices, which carries a maximum
of ten years imprisonment.  Additionally, each of the counts carries a maximum
fine of the greater of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss incurred.

    In separate but related court actions, it was announced that Rosenfeld and
Alfredo De La Fe have each pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal District Court
to conspiracy to use and to traffic in unauthorized access devices in
connection with activities that also involved members of MOD.

    Rosenfeld pled guilty on June 24 before the Shirley Wohl Kram, United
States District Judge.  At his guilty plea, Rosenfeld admitted that he
purchased account numbers and passwords for TRW and other credit reporting
services from computer hackers and then used the information to obtain credit
reports, credit card numbers, social security numbers and other personal
information which he sold to private investigators.  Rosenfeld added in his
guilty plea that on or about Nov.  25, 1991, he purchased information from
persons named "Julio" and "John" concerning how to obtain unauthorized access
to credit services.  Rosenfeld stated that he and his associates later obtained
additional information from "Julio" which they used to pull numerous credit
reports.  According to the information to which Rosenfeld pleaded guilty, he
had approximately 176 TRW credit reports at his residence on Dec.  6, 1991.

    De La Fe pled guilty on June 19 before Kenneth Conboy, United States
Distt Judge.  At his guilty plea, De La Fe stated that he used and sold
telephone numbers and codes for Private Branch Exchanges ("PBXs").  According
to the information to which De La Fe pleaded guilty, a PBX is a privately
operated computerized telephone system that routes calls, handles billing, and
in some cases permits persons calling into the PBX to obtain outdial services
by entering a code.  De La Fe admitted that he sold PBX numbers belonging to
Bugle Boy Industries and others to a co-conspirator who used the numbers in a
call sell operation, in which the co-conspirator charged others to make long
distance telephone calls using the PBX numbers.  De La Fe further admitted that
he and his associates used the PBX numbers to obtain free long distance
services for themselves.  De La Fe said that one of the people with whom he
frequently made free long distance conference calls was a person named John
Farrington, who he also knew as "Corrupt."

    Rosenfeld, age 21, resides at 2161 Bedford Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y.  Alfredo De
La Fe, age 18, resides at 17 West 90th St., N.Y.  Rosenfeld and De La Fe each
face maximum sentences of five years, imprisonment and maximum fines of the
greater of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss incurred.  Both defendants
have been released pending sentence on $20,000 appearance bonds.  Rosenfeld's
sentencing is scheduled for Sept.  9, before Shirley Wohl Kram.  De La Fe's
sentencing is scheduled for Aug.  31, before Conboy.


                       Intruder Cracks Cincinnati Phones
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         [ Courtesy Of United Press International September 16, 1992 ]

    A computer intruder apparently in the New York area broke the code into one
of the Cincinnati, Ohio, phone trunk lines, building up a $65,000 phone bill.

    United Press International quotes Cincinnati city officials saying the
unknown invader racked up the charges last winter and spring by placing calls
around the world.

    "An investigation into the calls was wrapped up months ago," UPI says, "but
details on the case came to light only recently after a brief reference to the
probe appeared in memos to council members and was repeated in a report from
the city manager to staff managers."

    David Chapman, the city's assistant superintendent for telecommunications,
told the wire service investigators think the tap originated in the New
York-New Jersey area, but they have no suspects and the investigation is
considered closed.

    Chapman added, "Apparently these people were pretty darn slick, but talking
to the Secret Service, we were small potatoes.  I understand there have been
some major companies hit."


                        LA Teen Charged With Phone Fraud
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         [ Courtesy Of United Press International September 16, 1992 ]

    Kenner, La., police have arrested a 16-year-old computerist on charges he
used his system for the theft of more than $10,000 worth of long-distance phone
service.  If convicted on all three counts, he faces up to $22,000 in fines and
12 years in jail.

    United Press International says police did not make public the suspect's
name because he is a minor.

    Police Sgt. James Gallagher told the wire service authorities contend the
boy used a home computer to break into a long-distance phone company system and
charged calls to customers' private access codes.  The boy also is a suspect in
several other computer intrusions, "including one in which the Detroit free
Press newspaper's personal message codes in its voice mail box were rearranged
as a hoax," UPI said.

    Gallagher alleged the suspect, in addition to ringing up more than $10,000
in illegal phone calls in nine days, also posted the long-distance codes on
computer bulletin board systems so others could use them.

    UPI reports Kenner police were contacted Aug.  31 by LDDS Communications
Inc.  investigators who had detected irregularities in their computer system
that caused them to suspect that someone had wrongfully gained access to
long-distance codes.

    UPI reports that, according to Gallagher said, the boy "was found to have
used readily available software designed to gain access to such calling codes."


          Somebody Gets Access To Freeway Callbox Codes, Runs Up Bill
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          [ Courtesy of United Press International October 23, 1992 ]

    GARDEN GROVE, Calif.  (UPI) -- Somebody apparently got hold of the serial
number and telephone number of a Southern California freeway callbox, and used
them to rack up nearly $2,000 in phone bills.

    The Orange County Transportation Authority is trying to determine just how
the phone thief used the electronic serial number and telephone number of the
freeway emergency callbox to make 11,733 calls totaling 25,875 minutes, and who
will foot the bill.

    OCTA Executive Director Stan Oftelie said they got suspicious because calls
charged to the callboxes' supposedly secret numbers average fewer than 100 a
month.

    Oftelie said OCTA officials also are trying to determine how the freeway
box could be used for in-state and out-of-state calls since the boxes connect
directly to California Highway Patrol dispatch headquarters.

    "We're concerned about it," Oftelie said.  "They shouldn't be able to call
anywhere but Highway Patrol headquarters." OCTA said it has tightened security
measures, and is talking with GTE Cellular and L.A.  Cellular to determine who
will pay the bill.  The callbox is one of 1,100 solar cellular phone boxes in
the county.  Most average 10 to 100 calls per month from motorists in trouble.


                      Women Calls For Help, Lands In Jail
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Oxnard, CA resident Helene Golemon called 911 to report (twice) a loud
teenage street party in the wee hours.  Later, at 6:00am, an officer arrived
and arrested her on a (subsequently learned-to-be) erroneous misdemeanor
traffic warrant.

    Golemon expressed outrage at the 911 records check, and that the warrant
even existed at all.  "Those kids were out there drinking and driving drunk.
Nothing happened to them and I got arrested." After booking, including
fingerprints and mug shots, she was detained in a holding cell until her
husband posted $188 bond later that morning.

    Assistant police chief William Cady claimed that dispatchers often check
available records, even on a reporting person, to know as much as possible
about the people involved when responding to 911 calls.  "Procedurally, our
people did nothing wrong" he said.

    The arrest warrant, dated from an illegal left turn from May, 1988.
Golemon fought the ticket and lost, then attended state-sponsored driver's
education (a CA alternative to fines available for first-time offenders) in
August 1988.  The court has a copy of Golemon's driver education certificate on
file, and Linda Finn, deputy executive officer for Ventura County Superior and
Municipal Courts, couldn't explain why a warrant was later issued in 1989.
Golemon was never notified of the warrant.

    Goleman felt the incident was vindictive, because the dispatcher was
annoyed with her.  "When I tried to explain the continuing problems we're
having, she was very short with me," she said.  Golemon then asked for the
dispatchers name, and the dispatcher in turn demanded Golemon's full name.
After Golemon complied, the dispatcher only told Golemon her badge number.  The
dispatcher remains unidentified in the news report, and an Oxnard police
sergeant who reviewed the tape said the dispatcher was "absolutely
professional."

    The privacy and computer risk concerns here seems to me three fold.

    First, the police often act with inappropriate gravity on erroneous, and
apparently unverifiable, data.  Under what circumstances does a misdemeanor
warrant demand a 6:00am public arrest?  Certainly more time could have been
expended verifying the data, as an at-large illegal left-turner hardly
threatens public safety.

    Second, apparently innocuous -- even beneficial -- contacts with government
can result in record searches for unrelated information.  Not only may this
result in egregious seizures, as in this case, but such an atmosphere can only
stultify public/government relations.  Crime and corruption thrive in such an
environment.

    Third, although individuals have the right to know most information the
government retains on them (FOIA), that right becomes meaningless if the
government can, at any time, decided to integrate facts from disjoint data
bases and then act without notice on resulting conclusions.  One cannot submit
an FOI request on the union of multiple far-flung data sets!


          Staff Threatened, Files Ruined As Teen Computer Whiz Strikes
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              [ Courtesy of Winnipeg Free News November 26, 1992 ]

    A teen hacker uncovered a hole in a downtown software shop's computer
system and went on a rampage, destroying every file and threatening employees.

    "It's an ego thing.  'Boy look what i've accomplished,' " said Sgt.  Dennis
Loupin of the Winnipeg police fraud unit.  "He's very, very intelligent.  He's
got a tremendous future in the computer world."

    An 18 year-old, who can't be named because he's charged under the Young
Offender's Act, faces fraud charges.

    Police say a hacker discovered a "hole" - an opening that allows a user to
circumvent a computer system's passwords - in the bulletin board program at
Adventure Software Ltd., a Hargrave Street software shop.

    The computer whiz unlocked the program several times, at one point
destroying every file.

                                 Bulletin Board

    The hacking is believed to have been carried out with an IBM-style computer
from a home.

    Adventure Software offers a computer bulletin board where customers can
communicate, read about news products, or leave messages from their home
systems.  The system has about 400 users, police say.

    An Adventure Software employee, who asked not to be identified, said
threatening messages were left in the system, some suggesting that selling
software was immoral.  Some messages attacked a store employee.  The system was
out of operation at one point for 3 1/2 weeks, he said.

    But the employee said police are overstating the hacker's skills.  "It
doesn't take a genius to hear about a 'hole' in the program," said the man.

    The system was infiltrated four to six times, he said.

    "It's not crippling.  It's just extremely annoying, " the employee said.
By breaking into the system the computer bandit found home phone numbers and
addresses, he said.

    Police say they are also investigating the teen in connection with
break-ins at other systems across North America.

                                    Mischief

    "He's now going to have to face the consequences of something he thought
was just a challenge but it's more than that - it's a crime, " said Loupin.

    A Victor Street teenager was arrested Tuesday night and charged with using
a computer service to commit mischief, an offence that carries a maximum
10-year sentence.

    The teen is now 18, but police say he was 17 when the alleged crimes
occured.


                       Editorial: Bring Back the Operator
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     [ Courtesy of Newsbytes May 29, 1992 ]

    ATLANTA, GEORGIA, 1992 MAY 29 (NB) -- By Dana Blankenhorn.  For the last
few years, you and I have been descending into Voice Mail Hell.

    You know the drill.  You want to reach Person X in a real big hurry, so you
call their direct line.  You get their voice mail, and maybe (when they get
around to it) they call back.  By which time you have forgotten why you called.

    It's even worse when you're calling a company for information and don't
know exactly who you need to talk with.  The main number's recording simply
tells you to enter the 4-digit code of the person you want to talk with, or 0
for an operator.  After an interminable wait, you get someone in a back-room
somewhere who passes you to the wrong department, and their voice mail box.
After returning to the operator, you get the right department, and another
voice mail box.  When that person finally returns your call, they say, oh, you
need someone else, and you get yet another voice mail box.  This can go on for
weeks.  No fun if you're on a deadline.

    And it's going to get worse before it gets better.  AT&T is planning to
replace many of its operators with automated systems, and the regional Bell
companies are expected to follow suit.

    Oddly, the voice mail industry which started this mess didn't intend it.
Voice mail was created as an adjunct, or aid, to experienced operators and
secretaries.  The trouble was, corporate leaders saw this as a good excuse to
get rid of those valued people and we've all been suffering as a result.

    I learned this anew recently when, working on a book project, I hired
someone to come in and straighten up my files.  Not only did I get my files
organized, but I also got my mind straightened out, my messages taken, and
important calls made.  Every top executive has a secretary, or administrative
aide, whether they're running IBM or the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  I wonder how
many of them could keep their heads screwed-on without these people to take
care of them.

    Secretaries make sure their bosses return important calls.  Operators make
sure calls are directed to the right people, and that messages are received and
responded to.  Without such handlers, executives lose accounts.  And their
companies lose respect.

    Look, the telephone system is your company's front door.  What sense would
it make for a customer to walk into your shop's door, be led to a robot who
kicked them out, to dust themselves off and get the same treatment again and
again.  Eventually, they'll go to another shop where they're treated like a
human being, by human beings.

    And that's the lesson.  Technology should help people, not replace them.
Only when top management learns this lesson, and brings back those operators
(maybe with a nice raise) will we coming out of Voice Mail Hell.


                      Editorial: Keep the Bells Out of PCN
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    [ Courtesy of Newsbytes June 19, 1992 ]

    ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1992 JUN 19 (NB) -- By Dana Blankenhorn.  The
seven regional Bell companies have a problem.  Wall Street doesn't respect
them.  Their attempts to raise stock prices through unregulated adventures have
failed, mainly because the weight of their capital tilts toward plain old
telephone service.  POTS, as it's called, is a widows-and-orphans business.
The profits are reliable, but they're low.  This doesn't sit well with the
Bells' self-image.

    The main thing the Bells have done to counter this image is to take over
the cellular telephone market.  Originally, there were to be two licensees in
each city: one Bell, one non-Bell.  But the US government later allowed Bells
to buy "non-Bell" licensees outside their regions.  And they did.  Now you
usually have a "choice" for cellular service between two Bell companies.
That's no choice.  Prices remain high, true competition nil.

    The FCC has a problem with this.  Chairman Alfred Sikes claims competition
will solve all problems.  But there is no competition in the cellular business.
Prices and levels of service are nearly identical in every region.  His
solution is to quickly license microwave-based cellular networks, called
Personal Communications Networks or PCN.  PCN uses shorter wavelengths than
regular cellular systems, so antennae must be closer together, but lower- power
phones can be used which fit easily in your pocket.

    To solve their problem, the Bells want to permanently prevent the FCC from
solving its problem.  Bell Alantic, the Bell for the mid- Atlantic states, has
unveiled its "wireless vision" to financial analysts, a "strategic mandate" to
invest $400 million in tiny microcells and dominate this new market before it
gets started by tying the new demand to its existing cellular network.

    Ameritech, the Bell company for the Midwest, is conducting the first market
test of PCN phones and services in downtown Chicago.  US West, the Bell company
for the mountain states, wants a "pioneer preference" (it wants to be first in
line for a license) on PCN because its UK cable operations already handle the
wired link in PCN networks there.

    If Al Sikes is to ever solve his problem, he needs to put a stop to all
this right now.  As Bell Atlantic makes clear, the Bells already have
everything they need to compete in the PCN market, maybe even to dominate it,
using smaller cells on their existing frequencies.  If competitors are to
emerge, the Bells must be prevented from taking any PCN licenses, either inside
or outside their markets, now and forever.  They must also be prevented from
using discriminatory pricing to limit the new PCN carriers' access to the wired
networks, which will handle most of the calling distance in any event.

    If Sikes doesn't do this, all his talk about competition will come to
nothing.  The Bells will dominate all future wireless markets, just as they
dominate the wired world.  There will be no competition for consumers, only
monopoly profits for the Bells.  And ironically, the Bells' stock prices still
won't be helped, because the capital needs of their slow-growing wired business
will always dominate their balance sheets.

    What's ironic is there is a way for the Bells to solve their stock-price
problems.  They should consider what Pacific Telesis is considering, do what
AT&T did under Charles Brown a decade ago.  Split-up.  Separate in two, into
local phone companies under strict regulation, and unregulated businesses with
wireless, international, and information service arms.  Stop trying to have it
both ways, a guaranteed pool of profit on one hand which can be used to
dominate new markets on the other.  Stop this schizophrenic double-game of
being competitive businessmen when it suits you and monopolists when it suits
you.  Be one or the other.  Wall Street will love you for it.
