    Welcome to the first return issue of the UPi newsletter.  This file was
originally released for Spectrum Issue #1, and I decided that the public's
positive reaction to this file was so tremendous that it made me decide to
re-release the file again as the first Issue of the new UPi Newsletter.  Hope
you enjoy reading this file as I did writing it.

                                - Introduction -

    After reading through my large collection of g-files.  I have found that
there hasn't been a good text file for beginner about hacking the Datapac
network.  This guide will give a general insite on how to identity different
types of operating systems when you are hacking about Datapac, and on generally
basic information about Datapac.  I hope this will give you more knowledge
about the Datapac network to help get you started.  Hope you learn a lot about
Datapac and enjoy reading it at the same time.



                                  - Part III -

                      - The Ten Commandments of Hacking -

    These are the ten rules of hacking that I go by when I hack around on
systems.  These rules are important in order maintain from being caught or
discovered illegally hacking on a system.

I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible.)
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier.
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.
V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you
      don't know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people
      that will validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems
      that are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the
      government has infinitely more time and resources to track you down than
      a company who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local Telenet or Tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800...)
      You use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.
      You may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you
      when you meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to
      death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working
      except in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or
      something generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that.)
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a beginning hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.



                                  - Part IV -

             -  How To Find Different Types Of Systems On Datapac -

    I think in my own opinion the best way to find systems is by scanning them
out.  Getting them off a board or off a friend is not very safe as they may
already have been hacked to death.  Now you are probably wondering how you scan
for systems, well this is what you do.  First you select a four digit number
representing the area you want to scan, for example 4910 or something like
that.  What you do from there is when you connect to the Datapac network (See
Part V for more details on how to connect to Datapac) you type ".." and press
enter.  You should get some kind message such as "DATAPAC: XXXX XXXX" (with
XXXX XXXX the Datapac node number you are on).  Once you get that message you
will enter a four digit number (the prefix) that you have selected, but don't
press enter yet.  After that type in another four digit number (the suffix)
your have selected and press enter.  Datapac will give respond to that by
giving you a Network Message which is discussed later (see Part VII for the
Datapac Network Messages).  These messages will tell you if the system you are
trying to reach is out of service, up, busy, and so on.  If you have
successfully connected to a system and want to disconnect from if and go back
into Datapac type in the following string "<Control>-P Clear <Enter>".  To
continue scanning for more systems just keep on adding one to the last digit of
the number in the suffix that you entered before and press enter.  To keep on
scanning just continue this until whatever suits your needs, for example you ma
start scanning at 4910 0000 and could stop scanning at 4910 1000.



                                   - Part V -

                         - How To Connect To Datapac -

1)  Make sure your computer on.

2)  Load your terminal program.

3)  Call your local Datapac node.  (See Appendix A, B, And C for a Datapac
    node phone number closes to you.)

4)  Once connect type to Datapac type in "..<Enter>".  Datapac will respond to
    this with the following message:

    DATAPAC: XXXX XXXX

    The XXXX XXXX is the Datapac node number you are on.  If you didn't get
    that message listed above then see Appendix E for more details on
    troubleshooting.

5)  Enter your Network User Identifier (NUI) and press enter.  If you don't
    have one then skip this number and goto number 6.  (For more information on
    NUI's see Part VIII and Part IX).  Otherwise Datapac will respond with the
    following message:

    PASSWORD:
    XXXXXX

    If Datapac did not send that message then that means that NUI that you
    entered is not a valid one.  If you did get this message then enter the
    password assigned and press enter.  Datapac will respond with either one of
    the following messages:

    DATAPAC: network user identifier <Your NUI> active.

    Which means that the password entered is correct.

    DATAPAC: network user identifier error

    Which means that the password entered is not correct.

    Note - If you have the NUI on and want to turn it off then type in the
    following command:

    NUI Off<Enter>

    From there Datapac will send:

    DATAPAC: network user identifier not active

    Which means that you are no longer using the NUI.

6)  Enter the Network User Address (NUA) to access and press enter If it
    connects to the NUA that your specified, it will display this message:

    DATAPAC: Call connected to: XXXX XXXX

    The XXXX XXXX is the Datapac node you have connected to.  Otherwise it will
    display a different message.  (See Part VI for the other Datapac Network
    Messages)



                                  - Part VI -

             - Explanation Of Datapac's "Call Connected: Message" -

    When a Datapac call is established through the network, a call
connected message is received at the originating DTE.  All or some of the
following messages may be identified depending on the type of call, options
used for the call, and the type of destination.

Example:

[HUNTED] [BACKED UP] [BACKED UP & HUNTED]
[i LCN] [P/N PACKETSIZE: (128 OR 256)] [NUI (6 to 8 CHAR)CHARGING]
[CUG:(CUG#)] [REVERSE CHARGE]

MESSAGE                         EXPLANATION
-------                         -----------

Call connected to: XXXXXXXX     A virtual circuit has been established between
                                an originating DTE and a remote (receiving)
                                DTE.

Hunted                          The remote logical channel is part of a hunt
                                group.

Backed Up                       The call attempt to the remote DTE has failed.
                                The network has re-directed the call to another
                                predetermined DTE that has been optioned as
                                backup.

i                               The call has been placed to an international
                                address.

P                               Priority service.  Packet size: 128.

N                               Normal service.  Packet size: 128 or 256.

DNA                             Data Network Address of the originating DTE.

LCN                             Logical Channel Number of the recipient DTE.

NUI                             The call will be billed to the 6 to 8 character
                                Network User Identifier.

CUG                             The recipient DTE is part of a closed user
                                group.

Reverse Charge                  The recipient DTE has accepted the charge
                                associated with the established call.



                                  - Part VII -

                         - Datapac's Network Messages -

    There are thirty-three messages which may appear when you are accessing the
Datapac network.  All of these network-generated messages which are sent to a
terminal, are written as "Datapac: text".  The "text" will be one of the
following messages:

ADDRESS
    This is a Datapac herald message for an SVC terminal.  The "address"
displayed is your Datapac network address.  This message indicates that you are
connected to the Datapac network.  Proceed with the call request command.

{P,R} TERMINAL ADDRESS -- (DESTINATION ADDRESS LOGICAL CHANNEL)
    This is a Datapac herald message for a PVC terminal.  It indicates that you
are connected to the network (address and destination address)

CLOSED USER GROUP ERROR INVALID ADDRESS, MORE THAN 12 DATA CHARACTERS, or COMMA
REQUIRED BEFORE DATA CHARACTERS
    These messages indicate an error in the call request command--correct and
re-enter the command.

CALLED BY [P][R] or [N][I] ADDRESS (XXX)
    This message indicates that a host or terminal has called you.  Proceed
with sign-on.  (Note: P or N denotes grade of service.  R specifies the
charging option, if applicable.  I specifies that it is an international call.
(XXX) specifies the logical channel number if it is a national call, and
specifies the gateway id if it is an international call.

CALL CONNECTED
    This message indicates that the SVC connection between your terminal and
the destination has been established successfully.

RE-ENTER
    This message indicates that a transmission error has occurred in the
current input line.  Re-enter the line.  If the problem persists, report the
trouble to Telecom Canada.

INPUT DATA LOST
    This message indicates that a transmission error has occurred.  Since part
of your input line has already been transmitted to the destination, enter a
"line delete" character for your application and a carriage return (CR).  When
the destination replies, re-enter the line.

PARITY ERROR
    This message indicates that a parity error has occurred in the current
input line from a terminal which is operating in echo mode.  The character
which is in error is not echoed.  Re-enter the character and continue normal
input.  If the problem persists, report the trouble to Telecom Canada.

INPUT ERROR
    This message indicates that there is a network problem, due to overruns.
If the problem occurs often, contact Telecom Canada.

PVC DISCONNECTED - TEMPORARY NETWORK PROBLEM
    This message indicates that a network problem is preventing the requested
call from continuing.  Wait for the Datapac herald message, then continue.  If
the condition persists, contact Telecom Canada.

PVC DISCONNECTED - DESTINATION NOT RESPONDING
    This message indicates that either the access line to the destination, or
the destination itself is down.  Try again later.  If the condition persists,
contact the destination.

PVC DISCONNECTED - REMOTE REQUEST
    This message indicates that the destination has asked that the connection
be discontinued.

INVALID COMMAND
    This message indicates that there is a syntax error in the command.
Correct it and re-enter the command.

COMMAND NOT ALLOWED
    This message indicates that the command which was entered, although
syntactically correct, cannot be implemented either due to the NIM state, or
because it violates and/or conflicts with the service options selected --e.g.,
a call request command, when an SVC is already established.

CALL CLEARED -- DESTINATION BUSY
    This message indicates that the destination computer cannot accept another
call.  Try again later.

CALL CLEARED -- INCOMPATIBLE CALL OPTIONS
    This message indicates that the call request command includes facilities
which are not available at the destination or are incompatible with it.  Verify
and try the call again.  If the problem persists, contact the destination.

CALL CLEARED -- TEMPORARY NETWORK PROBLEM
    This message indicates that a network problem has occurred--try again
later. If the problem persists, report it to Telecom Canada.

CALL CLEARED -- DESTINATION NOT RESPONDING
    This message indicates that the destination is either not acknowledging
your request to connect or it is inoperable.  Try again later.  If the problem
persists, contact the destination.

CALL CLEARED -- ACCESS BARRED
    This message indicates that the network has blocked your call because of a
Closer User Group violation.  Verify the call establishment procedures with the
destination.

CALL CLEARED -- ADDRESS NOT IN SERVICE
    This message indicates that the network address in the call request command
identifies a non-existent destination-- i.e., the address is not yet (or is no
longer) assigned.  Verify the address and re-enter the call request command.
If the condition persists, contact the destination.

CALL CLEARED -- COLLECT CALL REFUSED
    This message indicates that the destination is not willing to accept the
charges for the connection (e.g., it does not accept calls from Datapac public
dial ports).  Verify the call establishment procedures and try the call
again.  If the condition persists, contact the destination.  (See Part VII and
Part VIII for more information.

CALL CLEARED -- LOCAL PROCEDURE ERROR
    This message indicates that a network protocol error has occurred.  Try the
call again.  If the condition persists, report the trouble to Telecom Canada.

CALL CLEARED -- REMOTE PROCEDURE ERROR
    This message indicates that a destination protocol error has occurred.  Try
the call again.  If the condition persists, contact the destination.

CALL CLEARED -- LOCAL DIRECTIVE
    This message indicates that a virtual circuit has been cleared in response
to a clear command from a terminal user.

CALL CLEARED -- REMOTE DIRECTIVE
    This message indicates that a virtual circuit has been cleared in response
to a clear request packet from the destination.

CALL CLEARED -- REMOTE REQUEST
    This message indicates that a virtual circuit has been cleared in response
to an invitation from the destination to clear the call.

RESET -- TEMPORARY NETWORK PROBLEM
    This message indicates that a network problem has occurred on the PVC
connection.  Wait for the Datapac herald message, then continue.  If the
condition persists, report the trouble to Telecom Canada.

RESET -- DESTINATION NOT RESPONDING
    This message indicates that the destination end of the PVC connection is
not responding-- i.e., either the access line to the destination, or the
destination itself, is down.  Try again later.  If the condition persists,
contact the destination.

RESET -- LOCAL PROCEDURE ERROR
    This message indicates that the PVC has been reset because of a network
protocol error.  Wait for the Datapac herald message, then continue.  If the
condition persists, report the trouble to 
RESET --    This message indicates that the PVC has been reset because of the
destination protocol error.  Wait for the Datapac herald message, then
continue.  If the condition persists, contact the destination.
    If the host computer is connected via the ITHI option, this message
indicates that data has been disregarded due to the host not reacting to flow
control conditions sent by the PAD.

RESET -- LOCAL DESTINATION
    This message is the network's response to a reset command from the terminal
user.  Continue.

RESET -- BY DESTINATION
    This message indicates that the destination has reset the virtual circuit.
Data may have been lost.  Continue.  If the condition persists; report it to
the destination.

RESET -- TEMPORARY NETWORK PROBLEM
    These messages indicate that the network has reset the switched virtual
circuit.  Data may have been lost.  Continue.  If the problem persists, report
it to Telecom Canada.

RESET -- LOCAL PROCEDURE ERROR
    These messages indicate that the network has reset the switched virtual
circuit.  Data may have been lost.  Continue.  If the problem persists, report
it to Telecom Canada.



                                 - Part VIII -
                                                                               
         The Network User Identifier (NUI) is a crewith the Datapac Network - s
calls.
    A NUI is a 6-8 character alphanumeric code which is entered during call
set-up to indicate an account to which Datapac calls may be billed.  Associated
with each NUI is a password which is used as a security check when establishing
a connection to the Datapac network.  The password is confidential, known only
to the user.

Purpose
    The purpose of a NUI is to allow a Datapac user to make use of the Datapac
network for data communications without the requirement of a dedicated Datapac
connection or the need for the destination to accept reverse charge calls.
Once the NUI/password pair has been correctly validated, the call is set up to
the requested destination and call usage billed to the NUI/Datapac account
number.

Use
    At call set-up time, the user specifies the NUI and password to the
network.  The password is used by the network to authenticate the use of the
NUI.  After the NUI/password pair has been correctly validated (process whereby
NUI/password is checked by NUI application), the user will be able to bill all
subsequent session usage to the specified NUI.



                                  - Part IX -

                              - Why Have A NUI? -

There are many useful applications for NUI.

- NUI, when provided to authorized users, can eliminate the need for host to
  accept reverse charge c calls to a host
  applicatiocking option.

- NUI permits subscribers of dedicated and priv  decide that they do not want u
  billed to the account associated with the specified NUI.

- NUI permits sender paid calls to domestic Datapac network addresses and to
  foreign networks.  Users can make international calls to overseas networks
  and charge the call usage to their NUI when using public dial ports.
  Offshore networks accessed via Teleglobe do not accept collect calls.  Users
  also have the capability of placing sender paid calls to Domestic Datapac
  addresses, Telenet, Tymnet, Autonet, ACUNET and DASNET in the United Sates.

- NUI is required to complete calls using Datapac indial/outdial ports (i.e.,
  devices at destination not connected to Datapac).

- NUI can be used to achieve benefits of departmental accounting.  The Datapac
  bill is itemized to indicate the charges related to each NUI.  This will
  assist in determining which department has generated usage and the associated
  charges.

    Datapac 3000 is synchronous, application independent service that allows
data terminals (DTE's) and data communicating equipment (DCE) to exchange data
in a packet-mode over a public or private packet switching network.

    The DTE/DCE interface connection, disconnection and transmission rules are
defined in a packet switching protocol called X.25 recommendation which is
developed and governed by the international telephone and telegraph consultativ
committee (CCITT).

    X.25 protocol is a bit oriented framing structure based on the high level
data link control (HDLC).  The CCITT recommendations for X.25 are divided into
three levels, namely:

The Physical Interface (Level 1);

The Frame Level Logical Interface  (Level 2);

The Packet Level Logical Interface (Level 3).

Level 1

Level 1- Specifies the use of four-wire, point-to-point synchronous circuit
         between the DTE and the network (DCE).  This circuit includes two
         modems or datasets (one connected to the DTE and the other connected
         to the network).

         Characteristics are:
                           - 4-wire point-to-point or dial via a V.22 bis modem
                           - Full duplex ;
                           - Via RS232 convention.

Level 2 - Defines the frame level link procedures used to synchronize
          transmission, initiate the "handshaking" necessary to establish the
          'R-U-There'/Yes-I-Am sequence, flow control mechanism and perform
          error checking of data exchange across the DTE/DCE interface (link).
          the DTE is usually located at the customer premises and is called
          host while the DCE is located in the network.  the procedures used to
          control the link are defined as commands and responses.

          Characteristics are:
                            - HDLC;
                            - Link access procedure balanced (LAPB)
                            - X.25(80) or X.25(84).

Level 3 - Defines the packet formats and control procedures required to
          establish a logical path (call request), exchange information (data
          packets) and for removing the logical path (clear request) between
          the DTE and DCR.

          Characteristics are:
                           - Logical Channels (LCN`s)
                           - Packet Size
                           - Window Size
                           - Throughput Class
                           - Etc

How It Works

    The customer's terminal (Host) is connected to a local modem which in turn,
is connected to a second modem (Remote) in the central office via by 4 wires
which in turn, is connected to a line processing module in the Datapac network.
This configuration is called the DTE/DCE link and can be assigned speeds of
1200 bps through 19200 bps.

    This DTE/DCE link is assigned a unique Datapac network address (DNA) and
other link parameters such as line speed, modem type, flow control and security
by Telecom Canada.

    When the electrical signals are in the correct state as specified in level
1, the Datapac line processing module continuously transmits a CCITT command
called SBMM (Set Asynchronous Balanced Node) to the customers's terminal (Host)
every three seconds.  If the host is ready, it responds to the sabm with a
CCITT response UA (Unnumbered Acknowledgement).  When this occurs, the link is
initialized (level 2 ready), the host and Datapac module exchange restarts or
restart/restart confirmation commands.  When this occurs, the DTE/DCE link
generates a transition to the next X.25 level, level 3.

    The DTE then signals the address it wishes to communicate with in a CCITT
defined call request format (8 digits ), 10 digits if using 9th and 10th digit
subaddressing on a Logical Channel (LCN) Datapac then routes the call request
to the appropriate destination (national or international) and awaits a CCITT
defined call accept packet.  If this occurs, the accept packet is transmitted
back to the originating host and both hosts may now exchange CCITT defined data
packets.  This is called a Switched Virtual Call (SVC); permanent virtual calls
(PVC's) are also offered.  At the end of the session, either host can terminate
the SVC by transmitting a CCITT defined clear request packet.  Up to 255 SVC's
may be supported simultaneously.

    Dial access service is also offered at 2400 bps with a maximum of eight
LCN's over the public telephone network

Benefits

   Datapac 3000 provides customers with a cost effective service derived from
packet switching technology and X.25 protocol.  Some benefits are:

Dedicated or Dial-in access

 - Simultaneous communication with many (up to 255) different
   locations - national and international;

 - Error free transmission;

 - System expansion flexibility;

Communication Universality

- Cost containment through reduced host port connections;

- 24 hours 7 days-a-week service

- Lower communication costs;

- Call parameter selection to suit particular applications.


                            Section B - Datapac 3101

    Datapac 3101 is a network access service which enables teletypewriter
compatible devices, such as time-sharing terminals, to access the Datapac
network.

    Low speed, asynchronous devices are supported through an Interactive
Terminal Interface (ITI) in a Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD), which allows
the devices to access the network over dial-up (DDD) or dedicated access lines.

    ITI, the end-to-end protocol for Datapac 3101 conforms to the CCITT
recommendations X.3, X.28 and X.29 and supports access to the Datapac network
for asynchronous, start-stop character mode terminals.

    X.3 specifies the operation of the pad.  It contains the specifications
for the twelve international parameters and their operation.  Additional
domestic parameters are also in place to meet Canadian market requirements.

    X.28 specifies the command language between the terminal and the pad.
It also specifies the conditions which define the command mode and
the data transfer mode.

    X.29 specifies the procedures to be followed by an X.25 DTE to
access and modify the parameters in the pad as well as the data
transfer procedure.

    The user needs no special hardware or software to interface a terminal to
the Datapac network.  A knowledge of the ITI procedures is the only requirement
at the terminal end.

    The Datapac 3101 service provides for terminal to host (user's computer)
and terminal to terminal communication.  The host access should conform with
the X.25 protocol, using the Datapac 3000 access service, and also support the
higher level protocol conventions of ITI.  host access may also be provided via
the Datapac 3101 service for some applications.  The Datapac 3101 service also
provides block mode and tape support.


                            Section C - Datapac 3201

    Network access service which enables various terminals that are buffered,
pollable and operate asynchronously to communicate with host computers through
the Datapac network.

Applications

    The Datapac 3201 service is typically used by the general merchandise and
specialty sectors of the retail industry in Canada.  It provides a cost
effective communication solution whenever there is a requirement for sending
small amounts of information to a host computer and obtaining a short response.
The primary applications are on-line compilation of sales data to help in
inventory control, and on-line credit verification to detect fraudulent credit
cards.  Other emerging applications involve trust companies, credit unions,
banks and service stations.

Access Arrangements

    Datapac 3201 provides support at the customers' terminal end (for example a
retail store) by means of a Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD) which is
located in a Telecom Canada member company central office.  The PAD polls the
various devices for information in an on-line real time environment.

    Devices may communicate to the pad via two options:
1) Shared multipoint multidrop access at 1200 bps, or
2) Dedicated access at 1200, 2400 bps.

Protocol support

    Communication between the PAD and the terminal conforms to the ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) X3.28-1976 ISO (International Standards
Organization) poll/select asynchronous protocol.  Telecom Canada undertakes to
test terminals which support this protocol, prior to connecting them to the
Datapac 3201 network.

    Communication between the customers host computer location and the Datapac
network is accomplished by the use of a X.25 (Datapac 3000) interface which
supports the Datapac 3201 host to PAD "Point-Of-Sale (POS) end to end protocol"
specification.

Communication Response Time

- Data Collection:  Average 1.7 to 2.3 seconds in the peak periods.

- Inquiry-Response (Credit Check):  Average 2.7 to 4.2 seconds in
  the peak periods.

Message Size

    A typical retail Datapac 3201 application uses short input and output
messages.  (For example an average of 50 characters).  One kilopacket (1,000
packets or 256,000 bytes) is equal to approximately 1,000 sales transactions or
500 credit authorizations.  Average transaction volume would be less than 5000
packets per day.

Optional Datapac Network Features:

Closed User Group (CUG):  Allows devices within one group to communicate
                          only with accredited devices of the same group,
                          resulting in a high degree of data security.
                          Additional options are available to limit call
                          attempts between closed user groups or within a
                          closed user group.
Reverse charge call:      Allows a user to charge a call to the destination
                          address
Reverse charge call       Reverse charged calls destined to a Datapac 3201
blocking:                 address will be blocked by the network.


                         Section D - Datapac 3303 (BSC)

    Datapac 3303 (BSC) provides polled BSC communications protocol support for
IBM 3270 information display systems or their emulators.

    Datapac 3303 (BSC) supports all the typical on-line inquiry response and
data entry applications normally accessed with these 3270 terminal clusters.

    Datapac 3303 (BSC) is a pad based service.  The 3270 controllers connect to
the network via PAD's (Packet Assemblers/Disassemblers).  PAD's perform
the host functions of communicating with the 3270 controllers in the binary
synchronous communications polling protocol, and in doing so, eliminate
cross-network polling.

    Datapac 3303 (BSC) connections are dedicated facilities (one per
controller) at speeds of 2400, 4800, or 9600 bps.  A virtual circuit is
maintained for each terminal across the network and out to the host at the
other end via a Datapac 3000 line.  Most Datapac 3303 (BSC) connections
dialogue with hosts that are running Telecom Canada's Datapac access software
(DAS) in their IBM 3720, 3705, 3725 or Amdahl look-alikes front ends.  DAS
supports X.25 connecting.  To the network via Datapac 3000.  It also supports
the end-to-end protocol transporting the 3270 data across the network.

Datapac 3303 (BSC) - Features

    Aside from lower communications costs, the main reasons for using Datapac
3303 (BSC) are:

- Ease of network reconfiguration, and
- Dynamic multiple terminal functionally.

Reconfiguration

    New on-line systems are economically feasible and equipment changes can be
easily accommodated without disrupting service or affecting the network.

functionally with Datapac 3303 (BSC)

- Terminals are now much more versatile than ever before.

- The capability exists to dynamically access multiple hosts and/or
  applications from the same destination (either manually, or via a user
  friendly mnemonic addressing scheme).  This means terminals behind the same
  controller can access different destinations at the same time, saving
  equipment and communications facilities costs.

- In conjunction with DAS (Datapac Access Software) in the host's front end,
  that 3270 terminal can also act as an ASCII asynchronous device and access
  such systems as Envoy/100 and iNet.

- In addition, each terminal now has the ability to appear as either a BSC
  device to a non-SNA host or an SDLC device to an SNA host in a matter of a
  few keystrokes.


                        Section E - Datapac 3303 (SDLC)

    There are currently 2 services under Datapac 3303 (SDLC).  They are

     1) Datapac 3303/SDLC
     2) Datapac 3303/SDLC Plus

    Both services allow IBM (and their emulators) devices to access the Datapac
network for the purpose of transmitting data using the SDLC link level protocol

Common Features

- Terminal pad based: The service provides the X.25 framing and de-framing for
  SDLC data stream as well as the packetization and de-packetization.

- Qllc end-to-end protocol.  The service conforms to IBM's Qllc specifications
  thus making it compatible with most host X.25 PAD software/hardware
  implementations.

- Physical unit type 2 accessibility:  services such as the IBM 3270, 3177,
  52xx, 36xx, 37xx, 47xx, ATM's, etc

- 2.4, 4.8, 9.6 kbps access speeds.

- Point to point & multipoint, on-net & off-net access

- Terminal or host initiated calling

- Normal or priority packet size option

- Closed User Group options

Datapac 3303/SDLC

- 1 vc per pu (controller)

- Switched and permanent virtual circuit support

- Applications:  Virtual private line emulation, centralized host processing
                 simple call set up, international (via Telenet/US) access,
                 token ring gateway support using the IBM 3174

Datapac 3303/SDLC Plus

- 1 vc per lu (end user terminal)

- Local command mode allows call set up and clearing from users terminal

- Automatic direct call, mnemonic DMA dialing methods of call set up

- Switched virtual circuit support

- Applications:  Disaster recovery, alternate host access using switching
                 capability from user terminal, Datapac options (packet size,
                 charging, CUG's) at user terminal level.


                            Section F - Datapac 3304

    Datapac 3304 offers batch terminal support.  it supports RJE (or Remote Job
Entry) batch work stations or communications terminals operating under binary
synchronous communications (BSC) protocols.

    Datapac 3304 allows users operating under IBM's Multileaving Interface
(MLI) protocol to access the Datapac network.  It also supports compatible
computers and terminals using this protocol.  Datapac 3304 supports the bulk
data transfer applications from these remote job entry (RJE) work stations
which typically use this multileaving protocol.

    Datapac 3304 devices access Datapac via PAD's at both the remote and the
host ends of the network.  This is known as 'transparent' service or
'pad-to-pad operation'.  Devices are connected to the Datapac 3304 pad via
dedicated lines at speeds of 2400, 4800, or 9600 bps.  As users grow and
implement new technology, the terminals emulating IBM's LMLI protocol are being
upgraded to X.25.

A typical user profile would include:

- A host with a spooling or queueing subsystem such as:

               - Hasp ii
               - Jes 2
               - Jes 3
               - Asp
               - Rscs

- Batch terminals such as:

               - IBM 3777 m2
               - Data 100

- Have low to medium volumes to transmit


                           Section  G - Datapac 3305

    Datapac 3305 also supports a variety of BSC RJE batch work stations such
as:

                    - IBM 2780
                    -     3780
                    -     2770
                    -     3770
                    -     3740

    It provides network access support for those customers using equipment
operating under IBM's point-to-point contention mode protocol and those
compatible computers and terminals using the same protocol.

    Datapac 3305 supports the bulk data transfer (batch transmissions)
applications that occur between terminals, hosts, and a variety of other
devices such as communicating word processors.

    Datapac 3305 provides savings for those customers running low to medium
volume applications.

    Datapac 3305 is a pad based service.  The RJE (Remote Job-Entry) work
stations access the network via PAD's while the host computer may also use the
Datapac 3305 PAS or connect via an X.25 link on Datapac 3000.

    Datapac 3305 supports three modes of access:

     - Dedi     - Public dial at 2400 bps

    It should be                 Section H - Datapac Access Software (DAS)

   IBM host computer environments.  Datapac access software (DAS) resides in
customer-provided IBM hardware; the communications controller or front end
processor such as the IBM 3725 or IBM 3705, and co-exists with its compatible
IBM software such as NCP (Network Control Program), EP (Emulation Program) or
PEP (Partitioned Emulation Program).  Datapac access software (DAS)
compatibility also extends to IBM look-alike hardware manufacturers such as
Amdahl.

    DAS-installed host computer environments have access to their Datapac-bound
devices, such as those connected via Datapac 3101, Datapac 3303 (DSI/DSP),
Datapac 3303 (Qllc)*, and Datapac 3305, as well as those devices which are
connected via conventional communications facillities, such as private line or
dial-up.

    DAS can also provide SNA conversion for non-SNA devices, such as conversion
from 3270 BSC-3 (Datapac 3303 DSI/DSP) to physical unit type 2 (SNA 3270 SDLC
representation), and ASCII/asynchronous (Datapac 3101) to physical unit type 1
(SNA ASCII SDLC representation).  These SNA conversion features allow the
customer to convert his host environment to SNA without modifying or replacing
his existing terminal/device population.  DAS also provides an extended
conversion feature for 3270 devices that modifies the incoming data (3270) to
an ASCII/asynchronous datastream and re-routes the traffic into the Datapac
n    Other DAS features include multiple host sup

incounter when scanning around for systems.


                              Section A - Hp-x000

    The Hp-x000 machines are made by Hewett-Packard and runs the MPS Operating
System.  This system can be identified by the ":" prompt.  I have found that
the login sequence for these systems can be very tricky.  To login to these
systems you must type the login in the following way

:Hello (Job Id),(Username)(User Password).(Account name),(Group Name)(Group
    Password)

Job Id       :  This is used to allow users to distinguish terminal sessions
                that are being run on the same group name. It consists of 1
                letter followed by up to 7 characters (not ','). My favorite
                ones to use are MANAGER, OPERATOR, and some nasty ones when
                I get frustrated or bored. The first time hacker may not wish
                to use these as they draw unwanted attention if they are not
                used in the right ways.

User Name    :  The user name consists of up to 8 letters, eg. Gebhardt

Group Name   :  The group name consists of up to 8 letters and is often times
                the same as the account name, but not always.

Account Name :  The account name consists of 1 letter followed by up to
                7 letters or digits.

Password     :  The passwords are from 1 to 8 printing and/or non-printing
                (Control) characters. As with the 2000, the following
                characters will never be found in any passwords so don't
                bother: Line Delete (^X), Null (^@), Return (^M), Linefeed
                (^J), X-Off (^S), X-On (^Q), Underscore (_).

    You can recognize these types of systems by the "." prompt.  The good
thing about this Operating System is you can get a listing of accounts and
processing names that are currently being used on-line.  To do this you type in
that following "systat" at the "." prompt.  This Operating Systems allows you
to let you have unlimited tries at the account and does not keep track of bad
login attempts.

    Unix in my own opinion is one of the most widely used Operating Systems.
To identify if you connected to a Unix systems it will show a "login:" prompt.
This system will give you unlimited login attempts and usually does no log bad
user login attempts.  This system also does not tell you if you entered a
valid account name or not.  If you enter a bad account name or bad password or
both it will send you this message "Login incorrect"

the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system.  VMS is characterized by the
"Username:" prompt.  It will not tell you if you've enters and informs the owne
time s/he logs in how many bad login attempts were made on the account.  It is
one of the most secure operating systems around from the outside, but once
you're in there are many things that you can do to bypass system security.
This system also does not tell you if you have entered a correct login or
password or even both.  If either one or both of those are wrong the system
will respond and give you a "User Authorization Failure" message.

              Logoff

    But this may vary from system to system.  To login you have to type in
"login <username>.  But there are Vm/370 systems wh(Note: Try doing a "systat" 
is a Vm/370 it will give you a error message, which from there you can login by
typing in "login <username>".

    These are some of the error messages you may encounter when trying to login
to this Operating System.

                      other other important options about and for the user.

                              - Trouble Shooting -

   You want to hack a system on Datapac.  So you decided to call and it
connects onto the NUA you want, but you find you are having troubles getting
the system to recognize your input.  So here are some answers to some common
problems people find when connecting to systems.

The screen remains blank
  A physical link has failed - check the cables between computer, modem and
   phone line.
  The remote modem needs waking up - send a <CR> or  failing that, a ENQ
   <Ctrl> E, character
  The remote modem is operating at a different speed.  Some modems can be
   broght up to speed by hitting successive <CR>'s; they usually begin at 110
   Bps and then go to 300, and so on up the ladder.
  The remote is not working at V21 standards, either because it is different
   CCITT standard.  Since different standards tend to have different wake-up
   tones which are easily recognized with practice, you may be able to spot
   what is happening.  If you are  calling a North American service you should
   assume Bell tones.
  Both your modem and that of the remote service are in answer or in originate
   and so cannot speak to each other.  Always assume you are in the originate
   mode.

The screen fills with random characters
  Data format different from your defaults - check 7 or 8 bit characters,
   even/odd parity, stop and start bits.
  Mismatch of characters owing to misdefined protocol - check start/stop, try
   alternatively EOB/ACK and XON/XOFF.
  Remote computer operating at a different speed from you - try in order, 110,
   300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400.
  Poor physical connection - if using an acoustic coupler check location of
   handset, if not, listen on line to see if it is noisy or crossed.
  The remote service is not using ASCII/International Alphabet No 5.

Every character appears twice
  You are actually in half-duplex mode and the remote computer as well as your
   own are both sending characters to your screen - switch to full-duplex/echo
   off.

All information appears on only one line, which is constantly overwritten
  The remote service is not sending carriage returns - if your terminal
   software has the facility, enable it to induce carriage returns when each
   display line is filled.  many online services and public dial-up ports let
   you configure the remote port to send carriage returns and vary line length.
   Your software may have a facility to show control characters, in which case
   you will see <Ctrl>-K is the remote service is sending carriage returns.

Most of the display makes sense, but every so often it becomes garbled
  You have intermittent line noise - check if you can command line the remote
   computer to send the same stream again and see if you get the garbling.
  The remote service is sending graphics instructions which your computer and
   software can't resolve.

The display contains recognized characters in definite groupings, but otherwise
makes no sense
  The data is intended for an intelligent terminal which will combine the
   transmitted data with a local program so that it makes sense.
  The data is intended for batch processing.
  The data is encrypted.

Data seems to come from the remote computer in jerky bursts rather than as a
smooth stream
  If you are using PSS or a similar packet-switched service and it is near
   peak business hours either in your time zone or in that of the host you are
   accessing, the effect is due to heavy packet traffic.  There is nothing you
   can do - do not send extra commands to speed up things as those commands
   will arrive at the host eventually and cause unexpected results.
  The host is pausing for a EOB/ACK or XON/XOFF message - check your protocol
   setting - try sending <Ctrl>-Q or <Ctrl>-F

Most of the time everything works smoothly, but I can't get past certain
prompts
  The remote service is looking for characters your computer doesn't normally
   generate - check your terminal software and see if there is a way of sending
   them.

                                  - Glossary -

   The following is a list of acronyms and terms which are often referred to in
this document and others dealing with this subject.

ACP - Adapter/Concentrator of Packets.

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange alternate name for
    International Telegraph Alphabet No 5 - 7 bit code to symbolize common
    characters and comms instructions, usually transmitted as 8 bit code to
    include a parity bit.

Asynchronous - Description of communications which rely on start and stop bits
    synchronize originator and receiver of data = hence asynchronous protocols,
    channels, modems, terminals, etc.

Call Accept - In packet switching, the packet that confirm    willing to procee

Call Redirection     redirected from original address to another, address.

Call Request - In packet switching, packet sent to initiate a datacall.

Closed User Group - A type of high security NUI in use on several PSNs
    throughout the world.  CUG users can access optional parameters and NUAs
    blocked out by security.

CUG - Closed User Group.

Data Circuit Terminating Equipment - Officalese for modems.

Data Country Code - The first three digits in the four digits of any given
    DNIC.

Data Network Identifier Code - The four digits which come before the area
    code/address/port address of any given NUA.  The DNIC shows which PSN any
    given host is based upon.  The DNIC can also be broken down into two parts,
    the DCC and the NC.  For more information, see part VIII.

Data Terminal Equipment - Officalese for computers.

DCC - Data Country Code.

DCE - Data circuit terminating equipment.

Destination Paid Call - A collect call to a NUA which accepts collect charges.

DNIC - Data Network Identifier Code.

DTE - Data Terminal Equipment.

DTE Address - The five digits following the area code of the host on any given
    NUA.  For example, the NUA 234112345678 has a DTE address of 45678.

Gateway - A host on a given PSN which is connected both the the originating PSN
    and one or more different or same PSN's.  Gateways also allow one user on
    one PSN the ability to move to another PSN and operate on the second as if
    the first was not interfering.

Host - Any system accessible by NUA on the PSN.

Hunt/Confirm Sequence - String of characters sent to the SprintNet POTS
    dialin/port which allows SprintNet to determine the speed and data type to
    translate to on its PAD.

ITI Parameters - Online PAD parameters (X.3 or ITI) which allow the user to
    modify existing physical measurements of packet length and otherwise.

LAN - Local Area Network.

Local Area Network - A data network which operates within the confines of an
    office building or other physical structure where several computers are
    linked together into a network in order to share data, hardware, resources,
    etc.  These may or may not own a host address on any data network, and if
    so, may be accessed via NUA; otherwise direct dialin is the only
    alternative.

NC - Network Code.

NCP - Nodes of Communication of Packets.

Network Code - The fourth digit of any given PSN's DNIC.

Network Protocol - The hardware protocol which allows the host systems to
    communicate efficiently with the PSN it is connected to.  Generally,
    synchronous protocols (X.??) are used within the network and asynchronous
    protocols (V.??) are used to access the network, but asynchronous protocols
    within the network and/or synchronous dialin points are not unheard of.
    The standard protocol for packet transfer today is the X.25 synchronous
    data protocol.  For detailed information, please see part V and Appendix F.

Network User Address - The address of any given host system on any PSN.  This
    address is thought of as a "phone number" which is dialed to access the
    desired host.

Network User Identifier - The ID and password which allow the user which has
    logged onto the PSN's PAD to originate calls to host systems which do not
    accept collect calls.  it is often thought of as a "k0de" or a calling card
    which will be billed for at the end of every month.

NUA - Network User Address.

NUI - Network User Identifier.

Outdial - Any system which allows local, national, or international dialing
    from the host system.  PC-Pursuit can be defined as a local outdial system.
    Most outdials operate using the Hayes AT command set and others may be menu
    oriented.

Packet Assembler/Disassembler - The device/host which translates the actual
    input/output between the host and the user.  The PAD often translates
    between baud rates, parities, data bits, stop bits, hardware protocols, and
    other hardware dependant data which reduces the hassle of continual
    modification of terminal and hardware parameters local to the originating
    terminal.

Packet Switched Exchange - Enables packet switching in a network.

Packet Switched Network - A network based upon the principle of packet
    switching, which is the input/output of packets to and from the PAD which
    translates input and output between the user and the host.  For detailed
    information, please see part IV.

Packet Switched System - Another name for the PSN.

Packet Switch Stream - The PSN used by British Telecom.

PAD Delay - The extra time that is used to translate incoming and outgoing
    packets of data which is composed of a continuous stream of clear-to-send
    and ready-to-send signals.  PAD delay can vary depending on the type of
    network protocol and network/port speed is being used.

PAD - Packet Assembler/Disassembler (technical), Public Access Device (customer
    service description).

PDN - Public Data Network or Private Data Network.

Port Address - The two optional digits at the end of any given NUA which allow
    the PAD/PSN to access a given port.  For example, 031102129922255 would
    reach the NUA 311021299222.55, .55 being the port address.

Private Data Network - Any network (LAN/WAN/PSN) which is owned and operated by
    a private company.  Private networks are usually smaller than public
    networks and may host a myriad of features such as gateways to other
    public/private networks, servers, or outdials.

PSE - Packet Switch Exchange.

PSN - Packet Switched Network.

PSS - Packet Switch Stream or Packet Switched System.

PTSN - Public Switched Telephone Network.

Public Data Network - Another name for the PSN.

Public Switched Telephone Network - The voice grade telephone network dialed
    from a phone.  Contrast with leased lines, digital networks, conditioned
    lines.

Server - A type of network which is connected to a host system which can be
    reached either via NUA or direct dial which provides the "brain" for a LAN
    or WAN.

V.?? - Asynchronous network protocol.

WAN - Wide Area Network.

Wide Area Network - A data network which operates on a continuous link basis as
    opposed to the packet switched basis.  These do not operate on the X.25
    protocol and may only be accessed via direct-dial or a host on a PSN which
    is linked with the WAN.

X.?? - Generally symbolizes some type of synchronous network protocol.
