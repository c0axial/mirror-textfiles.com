The following is some information on an illegal activity, carding. UPi or 
Shadow Knight is not responsible for what happens to you if you try it. We 
do not intend for the reader to use any information contained herein. This 
file is strictly for informational purposes. 
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
    First off, there are many types of credit cards. But the main ones we will 
be discussing are American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa. These 
four are the largest and most widely used types. My personal favorite is the 
Discover card, since the company is a real loser. It is best for the beginner 
to start out with Discover, then move to American Express, then to Mastercard, 
and finally Visa. 
 
    The first thing you have to do is to find a credit card number (we will 
be refering to them as CCNs). There are several different ways of going about 
this, which will be discussed later in this file. The way you can tell the 
cards apart are the first digit of the CCN. 
 
                 Digit               Type of Card 
                -------              ------------ 
                   3               American Express 
                   4                     Visa 
                   5                   Mastercard 
                   6                    Discover 
 
 
    Now that you know the first digit of the card you want you need the 
different CCN formats. They are listed below. 
 
American Express 
 
3xxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx 
 
Visa 
 
4xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx 
 
or 
 
4xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx 
 
Citibank Visa, which is by far the most popular is 
 
4128-xxx-xxx-xxx 
 
Mastercard 
 
5xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx 
 
The type of Mastercard I use is Citibank which is 
 
5424-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx 
 
Discover 
 
6xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx 
 
 
    There are a number of ways through which you can get CCNs. They are listed 
below in order of easiest method to hardest method. 
 
  1) Go for a little swim. That is, in a big dumpster. This is called trashing. 
Go in back of department store or anywhere that accepts credit cards and jump 
in. But make sure it's not at a mall, or someone might see you and contact the 
police. When you've found the perfect dumpster, just dive right in. Just look 
around for carbons. You know, the things that the salesperson throws away after 
a credit card purchase. If anyone sees you, just pretend you're a bum. Or if 
that won't work, pretend you're looking for your baseball that flew in. 
Once you find these, (and making sure you don't rip them) put them in your cap, 
or somewhere where they won't fall out, and just calmly go home. Now comes the 
easy part. You just copy down everything important. The CCN, Expiration date, 
and Name. Then you rip it up into shreds and burn them. Now there is no way 
you can get caught unless you're a REAL idiot. 
 
   2) If you have a friend (it's better if it's a fellow pirate) that works in 
a store which performs credit card transactions, you might save yourself the 
trouble of trashing and ask him if he doesn't mind slipping some carbons into a 
bag after they ring up a sale. If he won't, bribe by saying you'll get him 
something too.

        (1) The Account Number. This is the most important thing on a Credit 
        Card. 
 
        (2) The Expiration date for Visa or Mastercard 
 
        (3) The Expiration date for Visa or Mastercard 
 
        (4) The Expiration date for American Express 
 
        (5) The Card Holder's name. The name is not very important but it is 
        good to have. 
 
  3) If are really advanced, you can use a credit card formula, several do 
exist. If you're good at math and patterns, you should be able to figure out at 
least one formula. 
 
    Once you have a newly formulated or newly found Credit Card, you have to 
first check to see if it is still valid before you try to use it. The easiest 
way I know of, is 1-800-554-2265. But after you enter something you must enter 
a pound. Just look at the example if you're confused. You must first, of 
course, dial 1-800-554-2265. Then it should say "Enter type". 
 
                         Number            Card Type 
                         ------            --------- 
                          10#              Mastercard 
                          20#              Visa 
                          30#              American Express 
 
    Then it will ask you for "Bank identification". Just enter 1067#. 
Now it will request a Merchant Number. Enter either 24# or 52#. Either one 
should work. 
 
    Now it will ask you for the card number. Enter it in with a # sign following 
it. Then it will ask for the expiration date. Enter it with a # sign following 
it. And last, but not least, it will ask for the amount. This is a little 
trickier. Look at the examples. If you still don't understand it, then you're 
dumb, and you shouldn't be trying to card. 
 
For $100.25 you enter 100*25#. For $1,532.67 you enter 1532*67#. Got it? Good. 
 
    Now the moment of truth comes. In the next few seconds the computer will say 
Approved or Declined. Yes or No. Light or Dark. If it's approved, pat yourself 
on the back. If not, too bad. Go look for another one. 
 
 
* SPECIAL NOTE * 
 
    In Canada dial 416-785-3222 for Visa credit checks or dial 1-800-268-2439 
for Mastercard credit checks. 
 
    For a Visa credit check in Canada, you first dial the authorization center 
and a operator will answer.  Then you will be ask for the card number, amount 
of purchase, merchant # and expiry date. If the card is good then she'll tell 
you the authorization number.  If the card is invalid then she'll say that the 
number was invalid. 
 
    For a Mastercard credit check in Canada, you first dial the authorization 
center and a automated computer will answer. It will ask you if you want it 
in French or English, so if you want English punch in 1, or if you want 
French punch in 2.  Next it will ask you for the "Credit Card Number".  Just 
punch in the Mastercard number and the press the # sign following the number. 
Next it will ask you for the "Amount In Dollars Only", so press in the amount 
and then the # sign following it.  Next it will ask for a "Merchant #", this 
can be skipped by just pressing the # sign.  After that it will ask for a 
"Expiry Number". Punch the expiry number in and press a # sign following it, 
if you made a mistake punching in the amount, then from here you press 2 and 
change the amount of the purachse.  After all that it will come back and if 
it's valid, it will tell you an authorization number, otherwise it will say 
that the number was invalid. If the amount is too high, then it will tell you 
to hold on for an operator. And then the operator will verify the card for you. 
 
*************************************************************************** 
ONE NOTE: IF A CARD HAS $5000 AND YOU VERIFY IT FOR $3000 DOLLARS, YOU CAN 
ONLY VERIFY IT FOR $2000 MORE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS IF THE CARD HAS $3000 
AND YOU VERIFY IT FOR $1250, THE CARD CAN BE VERIFIED $1750 MORE BEFORE IT 
WILL SAY DECLINED. 
**************************************************************************** 
 
    Now for the hardest part of all, purchasing merchandise with your newly 
verified CCN. You will probably want some computer equipment, knowing that 
that's what most people want. And be sure to read this entire file before 
attempting to card something. If you don't, you might get caught and spend ten 
years in jail and never be able to get another decent job again, just because 
you didn't listen to me and read this entire file. 
 
    Now that I have your attention, we must lay down some rules for ordering 
merchandise to insure your safety. 
 
1) Always go to a pay phone. 
2) Never give out your real name. 
3) Or your address and telephone number. 
4) Plan out the drop site and the fake number. I use the busiest PD board there 
   is. 
5) Sound calm. Remember, they can't do anything to you. 
6) If they get suspicious, just keep sticking to the same story. A consistent 
   lie is better than a inconsistent truth. 
 
    Where should I ask them to ship it to? This is a common question. The best 
place to have the merchandise shipped to is an abandoned house. The sites 
where you want them shipped are called drop sites. Jot down this address. 
 
    Now that we have set those rules, we now have to call a store. Make sure it 
is a small store, for they don't have the card checking techniques the bigger 
ones do. Now when they ask you your name and stuff like that, just give them 
the fake ones, without hesitation!! If you hesitate then they might get 
suspicious. Even spell it out for them. And try to be friendly. Don't sound 
nervous or anything. Now if they are online to credit bureaus suck as CBI or 
TRW then make up an excuse, like have your friend threaten you in the 
background (or something). If they are online with CBI or TRW they can verify 
everything in just a couple of minutes. Now if they aren't then you're in luck. 
Now when they ask for a number, give them the number you have ready. Bullshit 
your way through. If they aren't online, they can't verify really anything but 
that the CCN is valid and there is enough credit to pay for the merchandise. 
 
    I wouldn't suggest making a business out of this, either. Sure, if you 
want to get a few dollars for things you order (and that you don't want 
anymore) sell it and keep the money. It wouldn't be all that great to go to 
jail for ten years and never get another decent job in your whole entire 
stinking life, just because someone you don't even know, wanted a bigger hard 
drive for $100? Yeah, you know I have a good point there. Well, the truth is 
that the only people that should really even make deals are the people with 
lots of experience. 
 
    And now how to card Travelers Checks. These are alot easier than what I 
just talked about. All you gotta do is call 1-800-777-7337 and use an American 
Express card and ship it to your drop site. Now just go to another country 
and spend away. Have fun. 
 
    Now for the most dangerous way of carding, by far. In person carding. 
But you get the stuff really quick. Now you need a fake name again. This time 
you need two. Your dad and a son. Lets say your name is Robert Armstrong. 
Look at the example. 
 
"Hello, Computers for less, how may I help you?" 
 
"Yes, this is Robert Armstrong calling from California (or somewhere across 
the country). My son, Mike, needs an Apple II. It says here in your ad that 
you sell them for such and such. I would like to place an order for one." 
 
"OK. And how will you be paying for this?" 
 
"Visa." 
 
"OK. Number?" 
 
"4xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx." 
 
"OK, thank you. Now how do you want this shipped?" 
 
"Well, since my son is going to college right next to you, I thought I could 
send him to go pick it up." 
 
"Oh, OK. Sure. Do you want us to call your son to notify him?" 
 
"No, that's ok. He's supposed to call in a couple of minutes. He always calls 
me at 5:00PM every Friday. I can't wait to hear what he says when he hears what 
I got him. When can he go pick it up?" 
 
"Anytime." 
 
"Ok, thank you. 
 
"Thank you for ordering from Computers for Less." 
 
<CLICK> 
 
    Now comes the most dangerous part. Go to the store, park your car where none 
of the employees can see it. Now go in and state your fake name and what you 
are there to pick up. In Mike's case... 
 
"Hello. I'm here to pick up an Apple II my dad bought for me." 
 
"OK, sure. Mike Armstrong?" 
 
"Yes, that's me." 
 
"Ok, wait. We'll bring it up right now." 
 
"Thank you." 
 
"Well, here you are." 
 
<TAKE> 
 
"OK, Thank you." 
 
"No problem. Thank you for ordering from Computers for Less." 
 
    Now just walk over to your car and drive off. I wouldn't really recommend 
this method, but if you're desperate, try it. 
 
    Now if they get suspisious, don't get nervous. Just start complaining. Say 
like "My dad paid good money for this system and now you won't give it to me?" 
If they still won't give it to you, then say, "Ok, I'll come tommorrow. But if 
it isn't ready tommorow I'm going to tell my dad to get a refund." Then walk 
out really pissed looking and never go back. They were probably setting up a 
trap for you. Better safe than sorry. 
 
    Now I'll explain what happens to the unlucky guy. The guy's CCN you used of 
course. Now let's pretend this unfortunate soul's name is John Doe. At the 
end of the month, John Doe gets his Visa bill from the bank's credit card 
department. Among the things on his bill he notices a VGA card and monitor. 
John Doe then calls his bank and starts cussing them out and asking where the 
fuck did they get the VGA card and monitor from. Then the bank should send him 
a xerox copy of the original reciept, showing when it was bought and where it 
was sent to, and the second is an affidiate. This is a formal document 
saying that you did not make the purchase, you do not know who did, and did 
not authorize this purchase. It must be signed by him and then brought to the 
bank and signed by a notary public and have the bank's stamp on it. From there 
the bank can either go to their insurance agent or Visa, depending on who they 
have a deal with, and be paid for the carded stuff. Then John Doe must cut his 
cards in half and send them to the bank. After he has done that, he is 
re-issued new cards with a new CCN. 
 
    That's about it. I hope I've covered everything. If I haven't just E-mail me 
somewhere and tell me.
