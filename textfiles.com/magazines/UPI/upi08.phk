                   Bell Proposes Some Cuts In Long-Distance Rates 
                               By: Carolyn Adolph 
 
   Bell Canada announced plans to cut long-distance rates by an average of 
15 per cent yesterday, (March 22/90), saying new equipment had lowered its 
costs and improved its productivity. 
   Bell said it hoped to put the new rates into effect this fall, after 
winning approval from the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commision. (CRTC). 
   But the proposal won't be ready for at least two months, and the regu- 
lator has said the rate changes won't be approved outright. 
   "We have to hold public hearings," said CRTC offical Pierre Pontbriand. 
"The public must have a chance to comment on the best way to have these 
reductions." 
   The proposed changes would apply to calls made from Bell teritory in 
Ontario, Quebec and the Northwest Territories to provinces in the rest 
of Canada. Calls made to the U.S. and on many of Bell's specialized ser- 
vices will also recieve rate reductions. Rates for other countries are 
not affected. (Too bad for you non-phreakers calling the UPi node in 
Holland... oh well. -Tomcat). 
   But the cuts would not apply to calls to points within Bell teritory, 
from Montreal to Toronto, for example, Bell official Sylvie Bastien said 
those rates had already declined by 27 per cent since 1987 and were lower 
then rates for calls to other parts of the country. 
   Under the rate-reduction scheme for example, the price of a five-minute 
call made between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. from Montreal to Vancouver would drop 
to $2.40 from $2.85, a 15.8-per-cent decline. 
   The cost of calling the U.S. will be reduced by an average of 6 per- 
cent. For example, a five-minute call from Montreal to Los Angeles will 
cost $2.80, down 11.1 per cent from the present rate of $3.15. 
   Bell said it will also propose reductions for business services such 
as WATS and 800 services and the Between Friends residential service. 
   The telephone company said it can afford to reduce its long-distance 
rates because its new network equipment costs less to operate than the 
old equipment. Lowering rates would also keep it out of trouble with the 
CRTC, which forces the monopoly to limit rate of return to between 12.25 
and 13.25 per cent of revenues. 
   At a news conference, Bell president Jean Monty denied that the rate 
reductions were a bid to improve customer relations ahead of a bid by 
cable-TV mogul Ted Rogers to compete with Bell on long-distance service.
