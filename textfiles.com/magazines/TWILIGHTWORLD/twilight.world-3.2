                A Tale From The Tavern At The Edge Of Nowhere

 It had to happen.  Victor and Brian came back.  I tried all night,  but  was 
unable  to get their story out of them.  Luckily,  Richard Thrum  decided  to 
break his silence and talk to Victor.  They didn't need the psionic device to 
talk  to each other.  After all,  Victor was a ghost and Richard was  an,  er 
whatever!  What would you call him? A disembodied intelligence trapped inside 
a superconductor that had once been his own head? Surely there must be a buzz 
word for someone like him?
 I was on late shift the night Victor Torus and Brian Jones came back. It was 
about  nine in the evening when they came in.  By midnight Brian was  blasted 
out  of his brain by the vodka and cider he had been rushing  all  night.  He 
staggered  off  to  the  'coffins' to sleep it  off  leaving  Victor  on  his 
lonesome. The Tavern was practically empty by this time. I hoped Victor would 
feel like talking to me now that Brian was out of the way.  He and Brian  had 
been  trying  to  avoid me all night.  Perhaps they were trying  to  avoid  a 
confrontation with me.  The last time they had been in, Brian had stolen some 
of the text from my journal. In reality, I had more things to care about than 
the theft of some disjointed ramblings. I was angry at the time, but that was 
now so much water under the bridge.  Mind you,  that was weeks ago by my time 
scale. It might have only been days by theirs.
 Anyway,  things  got quiet so I tried to engage the ghost  in  conversation. 
Things must have seemed odd to the few customers who still hung  about.  They 
couldn't  see or hear Victor at all.  I could because of the  psionic  device 
that  hung about my neck.  I suppose that I could have 'thought' the  psionic 
field bigger,  but it just didn't occur to me at the time.  I had been  given 
the  device by Alburt Greshin when he left Richard's head for  safe  keeping. 
The device was the only way to talk to him - or so I thought until now.
 Unfortunately  for me,  he hadn't felt like talking in the two months or  so 
that he'd been here. Recently, I had begun to doubt the validity of the story 
I  had heard about the silvery looking head that still rested on  the  shelf, 
above the mirror,  at the back of the bar.  Right on cue,  Richard decided to 
break his silence.
 "Stop tormenting the guy and tell him your story!"
 "Huh!" I mumbled.  Victor looked surprised too.  The cheerful deep voice had 
come out of thin air.
 "It's me! The man in the mirror."
 "What?" I said.
 "It's the guy in the head," Victor exclaimed.  "Brian told me all about him! 
He read his tale in your journal."
 The  man in the mirror!  How apt!  I hadn't looked at it like  that  before! 
Richard's head was not just silvery in appearance, but was in fact mirrored.
 "Richard?"
 "Yes!" he sniggered.
 "'Bout time you put in an appearance," I said.
 "I was meditating."
 "For two months?"
 "Yeah, for two months. Whatever. I've got eternity in here with me. Time can 
pass like the flash of a spark.  It's irritating talking to so-called  normal 
people like you. By my time scale we've been talking for nearly half an hour. 
By yours its probably not even been a minute.  I don't bother talking to  the 
likes of you unless I have to."
 "Charming!" I exclaimed.
 "Don't be ignorant! Would you enjoy a conversation if an hour of talk seemed 
liked  days?  Days of talk so slow that you could write a  paragraph  between 
each of the other party's words? Eh?"
 "Sorry," I apologised, "Why have you joined us this time?"
 "To  talk to the dead guy.  I've never met a real live dead guy  before,  so 
shut up and let us talk! You, what's your name?"
 "Victor Torus."
 "Tell me your story and hurry up."
 "I don't wish to talk to anybody about it at the moment."
 "Stop pussy-footing about!  You've heard my story.  It's only fair that  you 
tell yours. I need to know. Hurry up!"
 "No," Victor said, and meant it.
 "Oh hurry up!  If you tell me your story, I'll show you how to interact with 
reality."
 A handful of zed nuts rose smoothly out of a nearby dish. The nuts separated 
and began to circle the ghost at high speed.
 "Can you do that?" said Richard.
 Victor  was lost for words.  So was I.  Then there was the noise of  someone 
being slapped.  Victor's head jerked to the side. His white face was starting 
to go red where the invisible blow had struck.
 "Or that? Don't you wish you could touch things?"
 Victor's mouth hung open in astonishment. He gulped at the air like a fish.
 "Do you want to be able to do that?" Richard repeated.
 "Y...yeah!" Victor spluttered.
 "Good!  Then we've established a point from which to negotiate. Tell me your 
story and I'll show you how to enjoy the rest of your death."
 And  so  it was that Victor and Richard began to talk in  earnest  whilst  I 
listened  in  silence.  As  Victor's  story unfolded,  I  began  to  feel  an 
increasing sense of horror and disgust.  The horror was not directed  towards 
Victor.  He  was a very unusual innocent bystander.  The horror was  directed 
towards a monster whose life Victor was forced to share for a while.  A  very 
human monster. A monster by the name of Philip King.

                                    *****

 Life  began for me,  in Scotland,  sometime around the first few  months  of 
1982.  I  say 'began' because I wasn't born in the conventional sense of  the 
word.  I  didn't  know the place in which my self-awareness  occurred  and  I 
didn't know the year.  I've since worked them out for myself. Brian Jones and 
I came from Scotland in 1992.  There's a naturally occurring doorway in  time 
near Loch Ness that leads straight to the Edge of Nowhere. Brian found it the 
first time by accident. Since I am haunting him - after all, he did kill me - 
I followed. The year 1992 is my point of reference. The events that I'm about 
to  relate happened approximately 10 years previous,  so the year 1982  seems 
about right.
 Obviously,  I wasn't aware of events occurring before that time. I picked up 
some  clues  from the memories of my host,  but most of  the  background  was 
filled in much later by Brian Jones.
 Philip  King  and Brian Jones were the best of friends  since  kindergarten. 
They  were  both science fiction writers.  Brian was quite  good,  but  never 
attempted to publish anything.  It was a hobby that he enjoyed. He wrote very 
slowly. Savouring plots. Using them only as mental jigsaws. Never feeling the 
need to progress into the so-called big time.
 Philip  was quite the reverse.  He was a rotten writer.  He wrote  fast  and 
often. He was obsessed with getting published. By the time he was nineteen he 
had  written ten really bad novels and nearly a hundred  short  stories.  His 
latest  work was a play for television called "The Last Night Of  The  Mobile 
Riot  Club."  The play was about CB radio which had just  been  legalised  in 
Britain  the year before.  Years later - after all the nastiness - I had  the 
chance  to read the manuscript.  It was bloody good stuff!  It was the  first 
time that Philip had drawn from life.
 If  the problem that he had for most of his life hadn't come to a  head  and 
manifested  itself so brutally in 1982,  he might have hit his goal and  sold 
the play.  His problem was simple. He was mad. Had been for most of his life. 
I  have  been unable to trace the starting point to his  problem.  He  was  a 
paranoid  schizophrenic who believed he was the most insignificant  being  on 
the  planet.  His constant failure to get anything published reinforced  this 
warped  self  image.  He  took  every failure as further  proof  of  his  own 
unworthiness to live.
 In  1982  he finally realised that he was mentally ill and  decided  to  get 
help.  He  used the time honoured gambits of telling his G.P.  that he had  a 
friend with a problem and could he advise him.  The Doctor could only  advise 
that  his  friend would have to admit the problem to his  own  G.P.  so  that 
therapy could be arranged. Philip admitted nothing and never talked about the 
matter again. He would handle it himself. He wrote his worries down on a list 
and looked at them for a long time.  By his way of thinking, all he had to do 
was prove to himself that he mattered to somebody and he would be cured. Part 
of his illness was an obsession with violence. He didn't use violence against 
anyone.  It was all imagined and directed towards himself.  Everyone he met - 
even Brian Jones - was the enemy.  They all wanted to hurt him - perhaps kill 
him.  Philip decided that if he channelled this violence outwards,  away from 
himself,  he would have progressed in the right direction for a cure.  He had 
tried to get fame through his writing and failed. Now he deliberately set out 
on the self-destructive path of infamy. He looked at it all quite differently 
of course. He just wanted to be loved.
 It was about then that I entered his life.
 My first memories are decidedly odd, disjointed and frightening. It was like 
scenes  from  a badly made film that had been spliced together in  the  wrong 
order and played at varying speeds.  When my birth intersected that moment in 
Philip's life,  our first shared emotions were of total confusion and terror. 
The confusion came from me. The terror came from Philip. He was in the King's 
living room at the time and he was choking to death.  He was choking to death 
on sweet and sour pork.  The key word is 'pork.' Remember it.  It might be of 
significance when I later tell you what manner of being I am.
 Here  is what was happening at that point in time as related to me by  Brian 
Jones many months later.
 "Bloody some walk that," Philip was saying,  "Remember the  Graveyard?  When 
the dawn came up?  All that mist and drizzle? The green damp gravestones? All 
very spooky."
 "That's right," agreed Brian,  "Near the golf course. I wanted to wait there 
at  the bus stop,  but you were spooked and insisted that we walk on  to  the 
next  bus stop." He gave a laugh and took a large gulp at his pint  of  cider 
which he was having with his dinner.
 Philip  put a tape into the video machine and pressed the play  button.  The 
screen was filled with the hiss of white noise.  "Takes a while for the first 
song to come on," he explained. "Wasn't spooked," he continued, "Just soaking 
wet  and freezing cold.  It was better to keep warm by walking than  standing 
for half an hour waiting for a bus that would probably be late."
 "Rubbish! You were spooked. First class brown trousers scared!"
 He  never answered this goading,  just stuck a whole ball of pork  into  his 
mouth and with much difficulty tried to chew it.
 "Careful, you'll choke your self!"
 Just  then  the video sprang into life and a song by an  English  punk  band 
called  the Jam came on.  They were singing about the things that people  did 
for entertainment.
 "Hey, I like this one!" said Brian as he used the remote control to turn the 
volume up.
 "Spooked?" Philip mumbled quietly.
 "What?" He turned the sound down again.
 Philip  didn't repeat himself.  His face had gone a funny  colour.  Sort  of 
grey.  His mouth was full of pork and hung open.  With glazed eyes he  stared 
into space.  Brian had seen Philip this way once before.  They had done a lot 
of  dope together a few years ago.  Once Phil had dropped some Black  Bombers 
and  a  few  Mandy's  on  top of some  good  quality  LSD.  Rather  a  stupid 
combination really!  Brian wouldn't touch the acid.  It scared him.  Phil had 
freaked out on the stuff.  He had looked then, much as he looked now. Neither 
of the pair had done dope for years.
 "Could  this  be what is know as an acid  flashback?"  Brian  thought.  "You 
okay?" he asked.
 "Spooked?"
 The family dog, Bristlehound - who had been asleep in front of the fireplace 
- woke up and wandered over to see what was happening.
 "Spooked?" He mumbled again.  This time, bits of half chewed meat dripped on 
ropes of saliva from his open mouth. The dog snapped them up hungrily.
 He coughed and then coughed again. Most of the pork fell from his mouth with 
a splat onto the smoked glass of the coffee table.  In a flash,  Bristlehound 
was  on  the table devouring the mess.  Philip collapsed onto the  floor  and 
started choking in earnest. The dog thinking he was playing, jumped back onto 
the floor and started barking.
 "No! You idiot! I warned you!" panicked Brian.
 He stopped coughing and managed to get to his feet again.  His face had gone 
bright red and the muscles in his throat were twisting spasmodically. After a 
few shaky steps he fell down again.  His right hand - now like a claw - raked 
through  Brian's dinner leaving lines of blood across the top of  the  table. 
Little  red  magnifying  lenses of blood splattering  across  the  television 
screen.  Look  again Brian?  It wasn't blood.  It was the red sweet and  sour 
sauce.
 As if in slow motion,  Phil's body hit the glass table top and it shattered. 
Now there was real blood. Amazingly, it didn't come from Philip. It came from 
the side of Brian's face as a small spear of glass struck his left cheek.
 Philip  started to cough again and the dog began to lick his face.  By  now, 
his  face was almost purple.  Brian panicked and slapped the dog hard on  the 
side of the face.  With a loud yelp, Bristlehound leapt away and ran from the 
room. Brian grabbed Philip by the shoulders and shook him violently.
 "Don't die in the living room!"
 What to do? What to do?
 "Don't bloody die you swine!" He turned him onto his side and began to pound 
on his back.  A final piece of meat flew from Philip's mouth and stuck to the 
wall with a meaty slap.
 He  gave a last cough and then beamed an evil grin.  Something  shaped  from 
pure badness lay behind that grin.  Something so corrupt and warped that  you 
wouldn't believe in it even as it was killing you.  He gave a gurgling,  wet, 
painful laugh.
 "Gonnie  kill them all!" The voice wasn't his.  It belonged to  somebody  or 
something  whose vocal cords were so rotten that they had to bellow  hard  to 
form  even  the  simplest of words.  Brian's blood ran  cold  and  he  almost 
fainted.
 "Gonnie cut them!  Gonnie split them! Gonnie eat them all up. Gonnie do them 
good!  Gonnie do them rude!" He began to laugh louder and louder until  Brian 
had difficulty making out any words.  Over and over again.  "Kill them! Spill 
them! Slit them! Dead them!"
 "Oh my God!" Brian gasped.
 Philip  suddenly  shut up.  His eyes bulged as he seemed to consider  for  a 
moment.  Then he spoke in that dead voice again.  This time it was just three 
word spoken with a period between each.
 "Not. My. God."
 "This can't be happening!" thought Brian.
 Philip  began to shout about killing them again.  He ran the words  together 
forever faster and louder until the words became a continuous  throat-ripping 
screech.
 "Stop it! Brian screamed.
 And he did.
 Phil's face changed - became relaxed and surprised looking.
 "Wh...what happened?" he whispered, "My throat hurts?" He sat up.
 "Stay  still," Brian said shakily,"You've had some kind of a  choking  fit!" 
His mouth was dry and he was visibly trembling.
 "I'm okay. A bit shaky, but okay - 'cept for my throat," said Phil fingering 
his  Adam's  apple,  "Which  is more than I can say for  you.  Your  face  is 
bleeding. Your as pale as hell and shaking."
 "Yeah?"  He  wiped  the  side of his face and looked at  the  blood  on  his 
fingers.  There wasn't much. "I'm not surprised I'm shaking. You gave me some 
scare."  He gave a watery smile and turned the television  off.  Bristlehound 
entered the room slowly and gave a small whimper.
 "Aw,  come here old girl!  Sorry!" Brian rubbed the old dog behind the ears. 
She  forgave him and gave his nose a lick.  She waddled over and gave  Phil's 
face more of the same treatment.
 "What did you do to her?" said Phil.
 "I panicked. She was licking your face and I slapped her."
 "Why did you do that?"
 "Like I said,  I was panicking.  Didn't know what to do.  I though you  were 
dying."
 "If I was that bad, why didn't you do C.P.R. or that thingamy manoeuvre?"
 "It just didn't occur to me," Brian shrugged.
 Shortly afterwards, Brian went home. I later discovered that he was so upset 
by  what had happened that he went straight to the toilet and  was  violently 
sick.
 When he left,  Philip went upstairs and filled in his diary.  As he wrote of 
his choking fit, he laughed. I just watched.

  24/October/1982 (Tuesday) Me and B went to the dole.    It was shut. Forgot 
  that it was being moved yesterday.  Checked the letter they sent weeks ago.   
  Not only had it moved,  but my signing date is now a Thursday. Bah! Got the 
  CB antenna fixed up yesterday. Its a 5/8 wave with a heliptical (don't know 
  how you spell it) ground plane.  B was suppose to help,  but the lazy swine 
  didn't  turn up.  I managed okay by myself,  but my dad wasn't  pleased.  I 
  hadn't  told him that the antenna was over 20 feet tall and would be  stuck 
  on a 22 foot scaffolding pole.  Tough!  The screenplay I'm writing is going 
  well.  Did  ten  pages of dialogue last night.  Had a bit of a  nasty  turn 
  today,  but I turned it to my advantage and scared the daylights out of  B. 
  It was a bad choking fit.  At the end of it,  I put on a voice and  started 
  shouting rubbish about killing folk.  B drank it in like the moron he truly 
  is. I had trouble keeping my face straight. I should be an actor instead of 
  a writer. I've started dreaming about light bulbs again. Wonder what it all 
  means?

 And those were my first memories.  I wasn't scared because I had nothing  to 
compare those events to.  In fact, the only memories that I had were those of 
the host and I had yet to learn how to access them.  Back then,  in my  first 
few  days  of  life,  I lay timidly at the back of  Philip  King's  mind  and 
contemplated the Universe.  Who was I?  How was it that I could understand so 
much without ever having been taught anything?  Without ever having learned a 
language, I should have been thinking in abstract instinctive picture form. I 
was  not  doing this.  I had a mastery of the English language that  was  far 
superior to the host's? What  did I mean by 'host'? Where did I come from and 
what was I doing here?  Again,  who was I?  What was I? I would be only a few 
months  until I had the answer to that last question.  The others were  never 
answered.
 When I learned how to access Philip's mind,  I became very  frightened.  The 
mind of a mad man is not a nice place in which to live.  Perhaps I could  re-
shape this dark tortured place?  Prune the memories?  Mould them into clearer 
cleaner shapes? It would be dangerous, but I could see a way. It would take a 
while to research my plan,  but a way did exist.  Unfortunately,  a few  days 
later, events forced my hand before I was ready.
 It  was a Saturday.  It was a cold winter night.  We were at a fund  raising 
dance  organised by the local C.B radio club.  It was held in the  Burlington 
Soccer  Clubhouse.  The soccer clubhouse was pretty normal for  any  Scottish 
club  except for its unusual name.  Nobody in Burlington would be  seen  dead 
calling  it  by its proper name.  An American business man had put a  lot  of 
money  into the club and insisted that the official name was  the  Burlington 
Soccer Club. To all in Burlington it was always known as the Football Club.
 "You want a drink?" asked Brian Jones.
 "Cider. Thanks," replied Philip King.
 Brian  wandered  off to the bar.  Philip took a pack of  cigarettes  from  a 
pocket in his coat which was slung over the back of a chair.  Removed one and 
tried to put the pack into his right front trouser pocket. There wasn't room, 
so he put them in the left hand pocket.  There wasn't room in the right  hand 
pocket because it contained a large retractable modelling knife.
 He  lit the Marlboro,  inhaled it deeply and looked the place over.  To  the 
right of the table was a small dance floor behind which was the D.J's  booth. 
To the left was the main body of tables and chairs.  At the far left was  the 
bar and grill.  The lighting was dim and the place was dusty.  In places, the 
wallpaper  was patchy with damp.  Even although October was  nearly  over,  a 
nearby  poster still advertised last year's Christmas panto.  The  music  was 
quiet. Although there looked to have been forty or fifty people there, no one 
was dancing.  It was still early.  Just turned eight.  Things would liven  up 
later.
 Brian came back.  He had a pint of cider for Phil and a beer for himself. He 
had  also bought a double vodka each.  He complained about feeling very  cold 
after the two mile walk.  He had on a dress jacket with a thin shirt,  a  tie 
and training shoes. Everybody else had been wearing parkas or overcoats.
 "Get that into ya," said Brian.
 "Thanks," said Phil and threw the vodka back in one swallow.
 "Don't mention it! The next round is going to be triples and you're buying," 
said Brian.
 "Right,"  Philip croaked,  "That stuff is rough!  You can feel it doing  you 
harm as it goes down. What is it? It's great!"
 "Don't know. No label on the bottle. Just some cheap crap."
 "They could get done for that."
 "Shur'up moaning. You seen Sharon anywhere?"
 "Nope. She'll not turn up."
 "Who's  that  over there then?" he waved at a girl coming in and  she  waved 
back. She was overweight, had on high heels and a denim mini skirt. There was 
no  warm coat for her either.  Brian and Sharon were peas from the same  pod. 
Sharon was a server in the chip shop in the shopping centre.  She always gave 
Brian  extra  chips.  When she had mentioned months ago that she  had  a  C.B 
radio,  Brian  had went out and bought a legal 40 channel Amstrad rig  and  a 
slightly illegal DV-27 antenna just so that he could talk to her.  Philip had 
bought a silver rod and a Nato 2000 rig which was legal to own,  but  illegal 
to use - if the chips were switched - anywhere in the world.  This was  Brian 
and Sharon's second date.
 "Eyeball  the  Nowhere Man!" shouted a deep voice belonging to a  short  guy 
with a black beard. He left the bar and headed for our table.
 "Right back at ya, Werewolf," shouted Philip.
 "Who's your buddy?"
 "This is the Slob," Philip gesticulated towards Brian.
 "Right!  I was talking to you last night wasn't I?  You're the one with  the 
Amstrad squawk box aren't you?"
 "Yeah. Excuse me a minute," said Brian as the went over to see Sharon."
 "Right! Is Golden Girl his seat cover?"
 "Not yet," said Philip.  'Seat cover' was C.B slang for  girlfriend.  Golden 
Girl was Sharon's C.B handle.
 "Cancer stick?" said the Werewolf offering Philip a cigarette.
 "Thanks," he said, taking a tube of tobacco, "Think I'm turning into a chain 
smoker. I've just put one out."
 "How is the Nato doing? Been down to the crypt yet?"
 "Couple of times.  Just listening mostly.  Talked to a guy down there called 
Mike. Can't remember his handle. Think it was a Ham Jumbo he was using."
 "Right! That'll be big Mike Miller. Handle's Judge Dredd."
 "That was him."
 "He's  only been on the box for about a month.  By Christ,  has he got  some 
good equipment."
 From  there  on in the conversation got even more boring.  Names  like  K40, 
Realistic, and Stalker Nine were thrown about as if they were important. When 
they  started  going on about SWRing in a tinfoil dipole  and  talking  about 
ground planes, I decided to go to sleep for a while.
 When  I woke up,  the music was loud and lights were flashing.  Someone  was 
going on about how his dog had ate concentrated washing powder meant for dish 
washers and had died.
 "How did it get at it?"
 "A bag had burst at work and the boss said it would get rid of the weeds I'd 
been moaning about. So, I took it home and dumped it on the weeds. Stupid dog 
ate it. Probably its idea of a joke."
 "Must have burnt its insides."
 "Right."
 Philip wasn't listening to the conversation.  He was drunk and he was angry. 
The anger was directed towards two young women he was staring at on the dance 
floor.
 Near the disco lights the two young women were dancing by  themselves.  They 
seemed - to Philip - to be about eighteen years old, but he wasn't sure. They 
wore identical,  but differently coloured,  clothes. One was dressed in blue, 
the  other in red.  Both were blondes and wore yellow ribbons in their  short 
hair.  They were dressed in flat shoes,  fishnet stockings, short thin cotton 
skirts and tight fluffy jumpers. Each time the disco lights in the background 
flashed, their skirts went transparent.
 "I've  always had a thing for women in tight fluffy jumpers.  Have you  ever 
thought about getting one Sharon?" said Brian.
 "You!" Sharon slapped Brian's arm good-naturedly.
 I  searched Philip's memory of the events that had occurred whilst I'd  been 
asleep.  Nothing interesting there, but I got the names of the new people who 
had joined us at the table.
 "Dirty bitches!" mumbled Philip.
 "You're  the  dirty one Phil," declared a redhead named Sara.  She  was  the 
Werewolf's wife. Her handle was Lady Love.
 "Com'on. Let's dance!" Sharon said and dragged Brian onto the dance floor.
 "Nice  legs,  huh?"  said Ronnie drunkenly gesturing towards the  two  young 
women. Ronnie was the Werewolf's real name. Sara gave him a dirty look.
 "Yeah," Philip agreed,  hiding his anger.  He knew that the young women were 
deliberately  taunting  him.  He didn't have a girlfriend and they  knew  it. 
Somehow they had found out that he was a virgin and were tormenting  him.  He 
knew  that  they  were laughing at  him.  They  had  deliberately  positioned 
themselves  so that he - and only he - could see the curves of  their  thighs 
and their white panties as the bright lights pulsed through the thin  skirts. 
The  fact that most of the male eyes in the room were also watching the  same 
sight never occurred to Philip.
 He looked at his watch.  11.00 pm.  It was time. Time for what? I could read 
his  memories,  but  it was often difficult to read his  conscious  thoughts. 
Maybe it was because I'd just woken up.
 "Nature calls," he said to no one in particular.
 The  toilets were in a separate part of the building near the  ground  floor 
fire exit. There was no one to see him go out of the fire exit. He jammed the 
lock open by forcing a dead match into the bolt housing and carefully  closed 
the door behind him. He waited. For what?
 I looked in his memories and saw that six months ago,  he had waited in this 
same  dark  car  park for someone to hurt.  It was over  an  hour  before  he 
chickened out and went home.  Perhaps he was going to go through with it this 
time?
 After  a few minutes a guy left by himself from a side entrance a few  yards 
away.  Philip made as if to follow him,  but a commotion at the main entrance 
made him fade back into the shadows.
 "It's the luckiest night of your life, pal," he whispered.
 The  commotion was caused by the same two women who had been tormenting  him 
on the dance floor. They were arguing heatedly about something. Neither of us 
could make out what they were saying.
 "All right! I'll walk!" shouted the young woman in red.
 "Well you can do it without your COAT!" screamed the young woman in blue.
 "Keep it! I wouldn't go near your car if you payed me!" she screamed back.
 "It wouldn't be the first time someone payed you!"
 "Bitch!"
 The  young  woman  in blue hurried to her car and the  young  woman  in  red 
hurried  off into the darkness.  It started to snow.  Standing there  in  the 
darkness, Philip smiled and licked a large dry snowflake from his lips.
 "Bloody  TYPICAL!" screamed the young woman in red's voice from out  of  the 
darkness. "Snow! In October?"
 "Perfect," smiled Philip.
 He  ran around the back of the Burlington Soccer Club building and  followed 
the  young woman at a distance.  She was mumbling to herself and  swearing  a 
lot. At a crossroads of paths, she paused and then headed for the park.
 "Even  better," he whispered,  "Nobody but a fool goes through the  park  at 
night."
 When she got near the underpass that ran under the main road,  Philip ran up 
a side ally and crossed the deserted road. He ran down the only path into the 
heavily wooded park.  The trees were too bare here.  He needed the shelter of 
the fir trees just a dozen yards away.  It was pitch black,  he skidded in  a 
pile  of  broken glass from one of the vandalized lights and  fell  over.  He 
didn't cut himself. He was only winded. Picking up a heavy chunk of wood from 
a nearby vandalised park bench, he hurried into the fir trees and waited.
 Less  than a minute later the young woman neared his hiding place.  She  had 
stopped mumbling to her self and was shivering already. He was also shivering 
for he hadn't brought his coat. There was enough light for Philip to see that 
she looked frightened.  She was probably wishing that she had not decided  to 
take a short cut through the park. And then, she was gone.
 Philip  hurried after her.  She did not hear his soft footfalls behind  her. 
The makeshift club was silent as it was raised. As it arced forwards, it made 
a  tiny  wind-like sound.  She didn't hear it.  It was  too  late  anyway.  I 
screamed a warning.  No one except Philip heard me. The wood split. Her skull 
did too.  Philip caught her as she fell and dragged her a few yards into  the 
woods.
 The snow stopped falling and the moon came out from behind a cloud. He stood 
over her warm body and drank in the sight. I had to watch too. I hadn't known 
her in life,  but in moonlit death she looked so innocent. She was beautiful. 
She didn't deserve to die in such an ugly way. No one did. She deserved to be 
loved for she was lovable. In that still silent moment, I loved her. I wanted 
to  cuddle her and tell her everything would be all right.  I wanted  to  rip 
away these last few minutes of time and make her live again.  I could not  do 
these things.  I am no time ripper and I have no body to cuddle with. Neither 
did she.
 Philip smiled. The adrenaline and testosterone buzzing through his body felt 
wonderful.  He felt like a God.  I saw a misty figure rise up from her  body. 
The God didn't. I cried and he heard.
 "Decided to make yourself know?" he said in his mind.
 "You killed her." There was nothing else to say.
 "I didn't think you would be back," he said.
 "Back?"
 "I've always hoped that I would meet you in the real world Victor.  And here 
you are."
 Then I had it.  I had been tinkering with his memories. For years Philip had 
been using the Silva Technique of meditation to explore his mind.  In it, the 
person  uses  various relaxation techniques and mind exercises  to  condition 
their own mind.  The participant imagines a place which becomes the  'office' 
of their mind. In this office, they imagine a 'helper'. Philip's helper was a 
character  from  a book he had written called,  The Man In The  White  Boiler 
Suit. The Man In The White Boiler Suit's name was Victor Torus. I had adopted 
the  persona  of  this  character and  inserted  characteristics  of  my  own 
developing personality into the memories of Philip's meditation  sessions.  I 
figured  that  this would make it easy for me to slip 'live'  into  his  next 
session.  Philip often took Victor Torus's advice. I had intended to do a bit 
more tinkering with his memories,  but now my hand had been forced. I was too 
upset to think clearly, but I had to play things by ear now.
 "You have to turn yourself in," I said.
 "Of course I will. Eventually," he said.
 He  unzipped  the dead woman's skirt at the side and struggled it  down  her 
legs. What was he doing? Then I realised...
 "DON'T!" I cried, "Please don't!"
 "Don't  worry," he laughed in his mind,  "I'm not a rapist I just  want  the 
skirt to wrap the souvenir in."
 "What souvenir?"
 "I need to leave a sign so that the cops will know its me when I do the next 
one."
 "Next one?"
 "Yeah.  Nine or ten should be enough. Then we'll turn ourselves in. We'll be 
more  famous than Nielsen or Sutcliff.  Just to prove we're not  sexist,  the 
next one can be a guy. What do you think?"
 "You're insane!"
 "Obviously," he said,  "Who else but a madman could have a conversation with 
a fictional character he'd invented?"
 I was too thunder struck to reply. How could he be contemplating such things 
without me seeing them in his mind? Are human beings that impetuous?
 "Suit  yourself,"  he  shrugged and removed the  modelling  knife  from  his 
pocket.
 It is impossible to remove a human jaw bone with just a modelling knife.  He 
also  used a large stone as a leaver.  The cloth of the skirt  prevented  his 
hands being covered in blood.  I will not speak further on this matter for  I 
am still deeply revolted by it. On that cold painful night, so long ago - the 
night  of the first murder - I was so shocked by these  actions,  I  fainted. 
Thank  you God!  I didn't come round until Philip had long finished his  dark 
deeds and was fast asleep in his bed.
 I cried for a long time.
 I searched Philip's memories for my missing hours.  It looked to me as if he 
had got away with it.  He had wrapped the young woman's jawbone in the skirt. 
He  managed to fish a polythene bag out from one of the parks  few  remaining 
garbage cans.  Putting his memento in the bag,  he hurried back to the dance. 
Removing  the  match stick from the fire exit lock,  he closed the  door  and 
slipped into the toilets.  Nobody saw him.  He went into a cubicle and locked 
it behind him. For a few minutes he sat there smiling.
 "You in there Phil?" someone hammered on the door. It was Brian Jones.
 "Yeah."
 "You okay? You've been gone ages!"
 "I've had too much to drink. Been a bit sick," he lied.
 He  opened the door and came out clutching the polythene bag.  Brian  didn't 
notice it. He was too concerned for his friend's welfare.
 "Christ! What happen to you? You're a mess!"
 "The  hair  kind  of suffers when your head's down  the  bowl,"  he  grinned 
weakly.
 "Tidy yourself up and I'll get you a coke. You'll soon feel better."
 "No. I'm going home. Feel really bad."
 "Give me five minutes and I'll walk you up the road."
 "No.  I'll go my self.  I've enough money for a taxi.  I don't want to spoil 
your chances of getting off with Sharon," he laughed.
 "Yeah. Great ain't she?"
 "Could you phone me a taxi?"
 "Sure. What's in the bag?"
 "Some  of my money fell out of my pocket when I was throwing up.  I  thought 
I'd finished being sick,  so I stood up and was promptly sick again. All over 
the money," he lied easily.
 "That's gross."
 "I felt too bad to wash the money here. I wrapped it in paper towels. Fix it 
when I get home."
 "I'll rinse it for you."
 "I was sick again. This time into the bag."
 "Yuk!  I'll  give  you  a fiver for the taxi.  You can sort  the  money  out 
tomorrow."
 "Thanks. Tell you what, I'll phone for a taxi myself whilst you get my coat. 
Could you put the bag in one of the pockets?"
 "Sure."
 He took the offered bag carefully with a look of disgust.  There was no  way 
he was going to look inside it.  Philip went and phoned a taxi then waited in 
the car park.  Brian came out with his coat and gave him the five pound note. 
It was raining hard.  There was no sign that it had ever been snowing. Philip 
quickly struggled into his coat.
 "You must have been really sick.  I felt the bag squelch as I put it in  the 
pocket."
 "I'll be alright after a good night's sleep.  Sorry to spoil your night out, 
man."
 "You haven't. The best is yet to come," Brian smiled.
 "Feeling lucky?"
 "Put  it this way - earlier on - I visited that funny bubble gum machine  in 
the  gents.  When you see me tomorrow I'll be smiling a lot," just  then  the 
taxi arrived, "See ya!"
 "Bye."
 Philip got into the taxi and told the driver his destination.
 "Felt the bag squelch!" he sniggered.
 "What?" said the driver.
 "Nothing. Laughing at a joke I just heard."
 "How'd it go?"
 "You wouldn't find it funny!"
 Philip King laughed all the way home.
 When he got there,  the house was in darkness.  His parents and the dog were 
spending  the weekend at the family caravan in Ayr.  He stripped his  clothes 
off  and put them in the front loader along with the dead woman's  skirt.  He 
placed the young woman's jawbone on top of the washing machine and looked  at 
it for a while.  There was a lot of meat still attached to  it.  Bristlehound 
would have loved that. It struck him how ugly the thing was and decided to do 
something about it.  He ran the hot tap until the water was warm and filled a 
small pot. He put the ugliness in the pot and put it on the stove to boil.
 Still  naked,  he took the modelling knife to bits and carefully washed  the 
pieces.  He dried the parts and re-assembled them with a new blade. He looked 
at the old blade for a while.  It was chipped and slightly rusty. It was long 
and  scored  with lines where it was suppose to be snapped off  and  extruded 
from the knife handle as needed.  Wrapping the old blade in a towel, he broke 
it  into  several pieces and put them into an empty beer  can.  The  can  was 
squashed and put in with the rest of the household garbage.
 Starting to feel the cold,  he went a put on some pants and a  shirt.  Still 
cold, he put on his bathrobe.
 He  went into the living room and turned on the hi-fi and played  the  album 
"Bat  out of Hell" very loud.  He danced through the album and then  replayed 
it.  Halfway through the second play of the last song,  he turned it off  and 
went back into the kitchen.
 The clothes had been cleaned and spun dry.  The bone had been nearly  boiled 
clean. He had assumed that the teeth would have fallen out as the meat boiled 
away.  They hadn't.  Taking some time to pick the remaining meat from it,  he 
polished  the bone with a dish towel and then wrapped it in the dead  woman's 
skirt.
 The  water in the pot was dark and greasy.  He started to pore it  down  the 
sink  and then stopped to consider.  It seemed a shame to waste such  a  rich 
liquid.  What else could be done with it? He realised the answer and began to 
laugh. Checking the cupboards, everything he needed was there, lentils, stock 
cubes (not that he'd need many), onions, carrots, potatoes and all the herbs. 
It had been years since he had made some home-made soup.  When it was  ready, 
he  turned off the stove and left the soup to cool.  Then he went to bed  and 
slept like an angel.
 Next  day,  he poured the cold soup into freezer bags and hung them  in  the 
freezer to harden.
 Philip  was in such a good mood that day that he decided to play music  over 
the  main contact channel of his C.B radio all day.  I tried to talk to  him, 
but he didn't seem to hear me.
 Brian  Jones came to visit that afternoon.  Philip never asked about  Sharon 
and Brian didn't volunteer the information. He wasn't smiling, so he couldn't 
have got lucky. He stayed late, so Philip cooked him some dinner. Not that he 
went  to any trouble preparing the food.  Just put a portion of  frozen  soup 
into a bowl and heated it in the microwave.
 "This is bloody great," said Brian, "What's in it?"
 "Mostly lentils," he smiled, "And a secret ingredient."
 "What's the secret ingredient?"
 "Not telling. It's a secret."
 Later that night,  his parents arrived back from the caravan.  They  enjoyed 
the soup too - Bristlehound truly loved it.
 It was two days before some kids found the body.  The news stories said that 
it had been extremely mutilated.  No details were given.  Within a few  days, 
the word on the street was that the woman's head was missing.  Other  rumours 
were a bit more horrible.  All agreed that part of the body was missing.  One 
of  the  rumours was that the victim's lower jaw  was  missing.  Most  people 
discounted that one. Obviously, someone on the investigating team had talked.
 After  the  second murder - over a month later - the general belief  on  the 
streets was that it was indeed the jaw that was missing from the bodies.  The 
popular  press  picked  up  this rumour and hinted  at  a  nickname  for  the 
murderer.  Three  weeks later - the day after the third murder - one  of  the 
daily tabloids gave the murderer a name. The name stuck.

 Every  idiot,  on  the  Burlington Citizen Band radio  circuit  who  enjoyed 
annoying  other  users,  started  calling using  croaky  voices  and  calling 
themselves the Jawman. Philip King was one of them. He wasn't totally stupid, 
he  never gave anything away.  Just behaved like dozens of other  nondescript 
'muppets'.
 "I'm gonnie get you!" says croaky deep put-on radio voice.
 "Who's  that?  Come in on the side," says nice lovable  respectable  Citizen 
Band radio user.
 "The Jawman," croaked deep put-on radio voice.
 "Not  another one!  Go and do a ten-two thousand on yerself pal," says  nice 
lovable respectable Citizen Band radio user.
 "Okay. I'll do it right now."
 Followed by lots of deep breathing,  gasping,  breaking wind, swearing and - 
perhaps - the occasional burst of someone blowing down a straw into a cup  of 
water. Nice lovable respectable Citizen Band radio user turns off in disgust. 
Jawman,  number hundred and one,  laughs and goes off to find someone else to 
annoy.
 Shortly  after  the  third  murder,  Philip  decided  to  catch  up  on  his 
meditation.  It  took  him a while to relax properly for he was well  out  of 
practice.  He  had stopped meditating because he had been feeling too ill  to 
concentrate properly since the first murder.  Although he was eating no  more 
than usual, he appeared to be putting on weight. Maybe it was the drink?
 I slipped into his vision without any difficulty.  The way he was going,  he 
wouldn't get caught murdering anyone for a long time.  My first priority  was 
to  delay the next murder for as long as possible.  The day after  that  last 
murder,  I adjusted his memories of the event so that he thought he had  been 
seen in the act.
 "We got that one real good," he said from his meditation.
 "Yeah, I know. I was watching," I said.
 "Don't  be modest.  You helped guide my hands.  I was shaking  too  much.  I 
couldn't have done that one my self."
 "Well, perhaps I helped a bit," I lied.
 "Serves him right for being a homo," he sniggered.
 "How could you tell? He seemed okay to me."
 "It  was obvious.  His clothes were too tight and he was too  good  looking. 
Most homos are macho and good looking. Thought everyone knew that? How about, 
we get a black dude next time? Just to prove we're not racist?"
 "Sounds good to me, but I think we should wait a while."
 "Why?"
 "I think someone saw us."
 "Yeah,  I  thought that to.  It was weird that one.  Almost as if it  was  a 
dream?  Someone  watching from behind a tree or a bush  or  something?  Can't 
think why I didn't do anything about it at the time?
 "Perhaps we should give ourselves up?"
 "Na,  we need to get lots more first.  But you're right.  Let's play it safe 
and give it a rest for a few months.  Maybe even a year.  That way it'll have 
much more impact.  They'll think the Jawman has gone.  It'll be so great!  We 
could wait at least six months and then send a deliberately misleading letter 
to  the papers telling them that we've moved to another town.  We could  even 
give a date and time for the next one."
 "Sounds good."
 "And the best bit is,  if we do the letter properly,  they will think its  a 
hoax  and  do  nothing.  Imagine their faces when a black dude  turns  up  in 
Burlington with its jaw missing," he started to laugh again,  "I can't  wait. 
Let's do it this weekend."
 "NO..."  I panicked,  "...up until now the only clue was the fact that  they 
got done on a weekend.  Even the times were different.  They think we used  a 
scalpel.  The idiots are looking for a medical student.  If that witness goes 
to the cops we're sunk!"
 "It was too dark for them to see us.  Anyway, it will be in the papers if he 
goes to the cops," he said uncertain.
 "Don't bank on it.  If he described us, the beat cops'll pull us in the next 
time  we're out at night on a weekend.  It's routine.  They won't be able  to 
finger us, but we'll be in deep dodo when they find the knife."
 "I always change the blade.  There's no traces on it.  In fact,  this time I 
travelled to Glasgow and bought a whole new knife."
 "I know. I was with you Mr Jawman," I mocked him. He didn't notice.
 "If we're caught out at night with the knife,  I'll say that its for my  own 
protection. Say that I'm scared of the Jawman getting me."
 I  didn't admit it to him,  but he was right.  Without a description of  the 
murderer,  that story might work.  Half the good citizens of Burlington  were 
probably carrying something when they went out at night.
 "I still think we should wait a while before the next one."
 "Oh, all right. We'll wait at least six months," he reluctantly promised.
 Two  weeks went by and his parents told him that they would be spending  the 
weekend at the caravan. Philip began to think about breaking his promise.
 "Could you make some of that lovely soup whilst we're away?  The heating  in 
the caravan is still okay at this time of year,  but the car is  freezing.  A 
good  bowl of hot soup would go down a treat on Sunday night," said  Philip's 
Mother.
 "Sure Mom," said the loving son.
 "Probably be the last trip to the caravan this year.  The weather is getting 
far too cold. The snow will be here soon."
 Later,  when his parents had gone,  Philip laid his 'collection' out on  his 
bed. There was little chance of it being discovered for it was hidden under a 
screwed  down floor board in his bedroom.  There was a red  skirt,  a  ripped 
white shirt and a denim jacket. All were washed and ironed. His favourite was 
the red skirt.  Sometimes he wore it and looked at himself in the mirror. The 
last  time that he did that,  he tied the polished jawbones together  with  a 
length of silver plated chain and wore them about his neck.  He looked at his 
reflection  in the mirror and felt sad.  The sight of the makeshift  necklace 
and the skirt beside his large belly looked pathetic. I think he knew it. Now 
there's a thought?  Why was his stomach so swollen when he was not eating and 
drinking  any  more than usual?  I didn't think he would  wear  the  jawbones 
again.
 That night - as he looked at his 'collection' - he laid the jawbones on  top 
of the red skirt.  He was careful to lay them down in the correct manner  for 
he had noticed the similarity between them and horseshoes. If a horseshoe was 
stored  with  its U shape pointing down then the owner would have  bad  luck. 
Perhaps  it  was  the same with jawbones?  Maybe they had to  be  stored  the 
correct way up in order to gather the luck?
 It  was  whilst  gazing at his 'collection' that he decided  that  he  would 
deliberately  break his promise to me.  After all - he reasoned - who  but  a 
madman would keep a promise made to a fictional character?
 At around ten that night,  he put his 'collection' back in its hiding  place 
and screwed the board down. Then, he took his knife and a screwdriver, put on 
a thick coat and went for a walk. I didn't know it then, but matters had been 
taken out of my hands again.  This time the horrible events, which were about 
to unfold,  were to bring good luck. This luck wasn't for Philip. Neither was 
it  for  me.  This luck was for the good (and bad) folk  of  Burlington.  The 
Jawman's horseshoe luck had finally run out.
 Unknown  to me at that time,  two days previously some of the  nice  lovable 
respectable  Citizen  Band radio users of Burlington had taken  matters  into 
their  own  hands.  They  were tired of this outbreak of  'Jawmen'  who  were 
spoiling their hobby and decided to do something about it.
 Brian,  Ronnie,  Kev,  Stevie and Jimmy - alias the Slob,  Werewolf, Bandit, 
Kingfisher  and Sonny Jim - were cruising in Ronnie's old van which they  had 
christened  the  'Blues  Mobile' after the car in the  film.  They  were  all 
slightly  drunk  otherwise the idea that Ronnie was about to have  would  not 
have  been  considered.  They  were earwigging the  C.B  channels  when  they 
recognised  the voice of a 'Jawman' who was being particularly disgusting  to 
Golden Girl. This Jawman was in fact Reggie Stone, also known as Lager Man.
 When  Lager Man had finished hassling Golden Girl,  Ronnie went down to  the 
breaking channel and shouted for Lager Man.
 "You got me Ronnie," he answered almost immediately in his normal voice.
 "Me and the guys are cruisin'. Got some beer. The Bandits here too. He knows 
where you stay. Fancy an eyeball?"
 "Ten-Four on that one. See ya soon Werewolf.
 Before  they  picked  Reggie up,  they formed a plan  to  scare  the  living 
daylights  out  of  him.  They  would take him up  to  the  ordinance  survey 
triangulation  point  by  the water tower on the edge  of  town.  Beside  the 
concrete triangulation marker was a large rough stone set in the frozen  mud. 
According  to Stevie,  it had a three foot tall metal fence around it  and  a 
small plaque declaring it to be a Roman altar. What it had been used for none 
of the five knew, but it had a worn groove on top which looked as if it might 
have  been used to sacrifice animals or people on.  Did the Romans go in  for 
that sort of thing?  None of the five knew,  in fact Stevie wasn't even  sure 
that it was a Roman altar.  It was more probably Celtic.  They would have  to 
read the plaque to check.
 The plan was simple.  They would hold a kangaroo court and declare Reggie to 
be  the real Jawman and sentence him to death by decapitation.  Ronnie was  a 
marshal arts nut who kept an imitation samurai sword in the back of the  van. 
He would show Reggie the sword.  The other four would hold him face down over 
the alter.  They would have a pretend argument in which they would decide  to 
let Reggie go.  Then Ronnie would slap the back of Reggie's neck hard with  a 
plastic  ruler which was wet with engine oil.  They would all laugh like  mad 
and take Reggie to the nearest pub to help him get over his ordeal.
 In  practice,  the warped plan worked pretty well as  planned.  Reggie  peed 
himself with fright and then blackened Ronnie's eye.  The rest of them  found 
this hilarious and laughed themselves silly. Reggie didn't go to the pub with 
them.  He had to go home and change his trousers.  I,  of course, didn't find 
out about all this until much later.
 Tonight was Philip's turn.
 They  spotted him as he crossed the main road.  On the spur of  the  moment, 
they decided that he would be the victim of tonight's court. Brian wasn't too 
happy about this, but he agreed to go along with it anyway.
 "Eyeball the Nowhere Man," shouted Brian.
 "Back at ya Slob," replied Phil.
 The  van  drew up along side him.  The white noise from the  C.B  radio  was 
uncomfortably loud.
 "Where you off to?" asked Brian.  He was riding in the shotgun seat.  Stevie 
was squeezed between Ronnie and Brian. The other two were in the back.
 "Need cigarettes," he said.
 "Hop in," said Ronnie, "We'll give you a lift."
 "'Kay," he opened the side door and got in, "What happened to your eye?"
 "It's a long story," he smiled.
 "Beer?" asked Jimmy with a belch.
 "Ta," he took the offered beer and the battered old van,  known as the Blues 
Mobile, started off.
 "So what's going down,  good buddies?" he said and took a long slug from the 
can.
 "Just  cruisin'  and breaking the airwaves," so saying,  Stevie  turned  the 
Midland 40 channeler off. The silence was deafening.
 "Done any good wind ups lately?" said Kev, miming winding a clock.
 "Na!" He shook his head.
 "Rubbish!  I  heard you last night noising up Silver Lady with  your  Jawman 
voice," said Kev.
 "Wasn't me," he lied.
 "Sure it was."
 "Let's have a vote on it," said Ronnie, "Brian?"
 "It was him," said Brian.
 "Traitor," said Phil.
 "Yes," Brian smirked.
 "Stevie?" said Ronnie.
 "Him."
 "Kev?"
 "Aye."
 "Jimmy?"
 "Yup."
 "Ronnie?"  said Ronnie pointing to himself.  "It was him," he answered in  a 
Jawman voice, "He did it," then in his own voice, "Phil?"
 "What?"
 "What's your vote?"
 "It was me," Phil said in a Jawman voice.
 "The aye's have it," said Ronnie.
 "You rotten swine. Talking dirty to that nice old lady," said Kev.
 "That 'nice old lady' isn't yet forty and is one of the biggest bucketmouths 
on the airwaves!"
 "Doesn't mean you've got to bucketmouth," said Jimmy.
 "Ah,  shut  up.  You've done it before!  You've all done it at one  time  or 
another," he complained and added, "There's the garage. Let me out here."
 "You  won't need your cigarettes," said Ronnie as the van sped by  the  well 
lit garage store. "We've got something to show you."
 "What?"
 "You ever seen the Roman sacrificial altar near the water tower," said Kev.
 "Yeah. It's crap!"
 "You're going to be looking at it real close. Real soon. Cause we don't like 
mike keyers who call themselves the Jawman.  Especially, ones that really are 
the Jawman!  You're going to get a taste of your own medicine and no one  but 
us will ever know!" said Kev.
 "Look  on  the bright side Kev,  if anyone ever finds out that we  done  the 
Jawman in, we'll probably get a bloody medal!" said Jimmy.
 "Two medals," said Brian.
 "Three medals," said Stevie.
 "We'll be heroes!" said Ronnie.
 This was the same lines that they had used on Reggie a few nights before. He 
hadn't  been  worried at that point,  but Philip went pale and  struggled  to 
control a sudden surge of panic that threatened to engulf him.
 "You're NUTS!" he said.
 "Yes..." said Kev,  "...and we're going to NUT you!" He grinned insanely and 
they all did Jawman laughs and moans.
 Just then,  the van stopped near the field where the altar was. They all got 
out.  Kev  gripped one of Philip's arms.  Jimmy held the  other.  Philip  was 
distantly reminded of the only time he had been arrested. He was 14 years old 
at  the time.  Brian and himself had taken a short cut through the  partially 
built  shopping centre extension and had ran into some cops.  They  had  been 
lifted  for trespassing.  "Don't worry..." Brian whispered to Philip  in  the 
back  of  the  paddy  wagon,  "...in Scotland you  can't  be  prosecuted  for 
trespass. They'll question us and then let us go." Brian had been right.
 Ronnie  and  Kev  told Philip about their evidence that proved  he  was  the 
Jawman.  It was,  of course, made up on the spur of the moment. Philip wasn't 
listening. He was in shock. He really believed that he'd been found out.
 Four of them took him over to the altar. The fence was broken and the frozen 
mud cracked and flowed beneath their boots. Ronnie got the sword from the van 
and showed it to Philip.  Like the rest of them,  he mistook Phil's  apparent 
calmness  as willingness to humour the game.  Phil obviously  didn't  believe 
them  and was playing along.  Maybe Reggie Stone had talked?  It was time  to 
spice things up a bit.
 "Time to die Nowhere Man. Ever had your head cut off before?" said Ronnie.
 Philip said nothing.
 "Didn't think so. Right lads, hold him down."
 They  pulled  him down,  two guys on each arm,  till the soft flesh  of  his 
throat rubbed against the cold grainy stone.  Ronnie rested the blunt edge of 
the sword against the back of Phil's neck.  Reggie Stone had been  struggling 
and shouting by this point.
 "Cold steel. Eh?" said Ronnie.
 "Is there any last words?" said Kev.
 "Victor Torus made me do it," he said calmly.
 "No I didn't!" I said, but no one heard.
 "Who the hell's Victor Torus?" said Kev.
 "The Man In The White Boiler Suit," he said softly.
 They  had  all heard of that character.  Philip's writing was  something  he 
bored  all  the  other C.B radio users to death  with.  He  sometimes  called 
himself The Man In The White Boiler Suit on the C.B. They all laughed.
 "Maybe we got the wrong guy? What do you think guys?" said Ronnie.
 "I think I'm freezing my butt off!" said Brian.
 "Hold on a minute 'till I think." Ronnie quietly pushed the tip of the sword 
into the ground and left it sticking there.  He went back to the van and  got 
the plastic ruler.  Previously,  he'd covered the ruler with some oil  simply 
because there was nothing else to hand that would help to make the  necessary 
wet smack as the ruler struck the back of Reggie's neck. Tonight's events had 
been  more  contrived.  He  had brought a bottle  of  tomato  ketchup.  "It's 
amazing," thought Ronnie,  "how much ketchup you can get on a ruler!" He went 
back to the cold group gathered at the alter.
 "I've decided to do it,"
 He bent down to Philip's right ear and had another go at scaring him.
 "I've heard that decapitation is painless and instant. However, I think that 
it  might take two or three seconds before you die.  Just in case I'm  right, 
close  your eyes cause if your head turns over as it falls you might  end  up 
looking down your own neck.  Nasty!  You wouldn't want to see that. You might 
get blood in your eyes!"
 "Gross!" said Kev.
 "Yuk!" said the rest of them.
 Ronnie carefully raised the ruler behind Philip's head.
 "DIE!" he shouted.
 Philip was paralysed with fear. His bowels loosened. Adrenaline spurted into 
blood vessels.  Brain endorphines surged through synapses.  Something in  his 
stomach moved and headed for his throat. Something?
 Ronnie  flipped the ruler up,  turned it over and brought it  down.  Inertia 
from  the pushing ruler kept the tomato ketchup from falling to  the  ground. 
The wet plastic struck his neck painfully...
 ...WE SCREAMED!
 They let his arms go and he fell to the mud clutching his stomach. The thing 
in there writhed.  I shared the pain.  It felt like dying and being reborn at 
the same time. It was the endorphines. Their heroin-like effect was splitting 
our mind.  Driving us apart!  The mind's own drug combined with the terror to 
do  something  which in retrospect - like so many other things in my  life  - 
should  have been impossible.  I was being expelled from the host.  I was  no 
longer part of Philip King.  Yet a supernatural link remained.  I could still 
see through his eyes.  Feel his pain. And that pain was truly obscene. It was 
so pure, it was exquisite!
 The  thing  flowed up Philip's throat,  out of his mouth and into  the  cold 
liquid mud.  It was over a meter long. Its thin pale warm wet body steamed in 
the cold night air.  It writhed in torment with us.  Its coiling body  struck 
Philip  in  the  face.  He  screamed by himself and begun  to  choke  on  the 
following  vomit.  Is this how it ends?  The same way it begun?  Has  my  un-
natural life went full circle?
 The rest of them had been watching in stunned silence.  The wriggling  thing 
rolled in the mud and moved closer to Brian.  He flinched.  For a  second,  I 
thought that he might run - I thought they all would. Brian picked up a heavy 
rock and held it up high.  The eel-like thing paused in its terror.  One  end 
turned like a head towards Brian. There was no face. No eyes. No mouth. If it 
could have talked,  I somehow knew it would have pleaded for help.  What  was 
it?  What was going on? And then I knew. Brian started to bring the rock down 
on the thing's head...
 "NO!  IT'S  ME!" I screamed.  Everyone heard.  Things went black.  The  pain 
stopped. I was dead.

                                    *****

 At that point,  the ghost of Victor Torus started to cry.  The ghostly tears 
flowed like water. I guess he had a lot of crying to do. Since it hadn't been 
my conversation to begin with,  I felt I had outstayed my welcome.  I slipped 
away to my rooms and went to bed.
 Next  day,  I was surprised to find Victor still in the  Tavern.  The  ghost 
seemed in good spirits (groan).
 "Hello Victor," I said.
 "Hi,  my  dearest Tony," he said enthusiastically.  He hugged me and gave  a 
smacker on the cheek.
 "You can touch me?"
 "Yeah, Richard kept his word. Great isn't it?"
 "It's brilliant Victor," I smiled. And it was.
 "Don't call me Victor.  From now on call me Sheila.  Sheila Stevens.  That's 
the name I've picked for myself. I was never Victor Torus. He was always just 
a character from one of Philip King's stories."
 "But that's a girl's name?" Where had I heard that name Before?
 "But,  I am female!  Well sort of!  My kind are hermaphrodites.  I've  spent 
years analyzing my personality type. I'm definitely female. What you see here 
is  a  projection of what Philip King imagined me to look  like.  When  Brian 
killed  me,  I  had  no self-image other than the one Philip  had  given  me. 
Shortly after my death I realised that I was female,  but didn't know how  to 
change my appearance."
 "But you still look like Victor Torus?" I said.
 "Self-image  is an unconscious act.  Richard has shown me how to change  it, 
but it will take a few weeks to happen.  I can't do it consciously,  just use 
Richard's  techniques  to allow my subconscious mind to reshape  my  physical 
form."
 "What's your real self-image like?"
 "I don't know. Can you describe yours? I'm sure it's female and I still feel 
young.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Would it matter if the Tavern is haunted by an ugly 
old woman?"
 "Thought you were haunting Brian Jones?"
 "I can haunt who I want to now.  Until I came here,  he was the only  person 
who  could  see me.  That was the only reason I stayed  with  him.  Death  is 
monotonous when you've only one person to talk to.  Now I can make anyone see 
me and I can touch them. If I can concentrate hard enough, I can be solid for 
short periods of time."
 Victor Torus was what a woman would call good looking and a polite guy would 
call effeminate.  Wonder what Sheila Stevens would look like?  Imagine  being 
haunted  by the ghost of a beautiful young woman!  A woman who  would  always 
look young! A ghost who could solidify so that you could touch her. Would sex 
be possible?
 "Watch it buster! I heard that thought!" said Sheila sternly.
 "Sorry?"  I  mumbled and felt my face go red.  It was the  psionic  device's 
fault.  I  had let a thought or two slip out.  Alburt Greshin had  warned  me 
about  that possibility ages ago.  I thought the field off and  Sheila  faded 
away. I thought it on again and the ghost popped back.
 "Thought you didn't need the device any more," I asked.
 "I  don't,  but its quite difficult to make myself visible.  I'm using  that 
thing until I get some practice in. Could you leave it turned on?"
 "Sure.  If you can fill out the rest of your story for me. I missed the end. 
You were very upset. I felt I was intruding."
 "You  were."  He - she,  I corrected myself - fluttered  her  eyelashes  and 
smiled.  I  felt very uncomfortable.  Now that I thought about  it,  Sheila's 
chest was rather protruding for what I'd taken to be a man's body.  In  fact, 
when you realised that the person inside the body was female, the body didn't 
look at all masculine. The face I'd taken as effeminate was kind of nice.
 "Why, thank you Tony!"
 The device had done it again!
 I changed the subject.
 "What happened after you died?"
 "Oh, there's nothing much left to tell. The shock of separation was too much 
for Philip.  His mind was destroyed.  He became a vegetable and was put in  a 
special  hospital.  Nobody ever discovered his 'collection' hidden under  the 
floorboards of his room.  It must still be there.  Brian and the others  were 
the  only  ones to get into trouble.  They got their pictures  in  the  local 
newspaper with 'PRANK GOES WRONG' headline.  That was when Brian first grew a 
beard.  He didn't need glasses then,  but he started to wear shades. It was a 
disguise."
 "One thing still puzzles me?" I said,  "If all this happened over ten  years 
ago, why does Brian still look twenty years old?"
 "Just the worry.  He went through hell after Philip's mind was destroyed. My 
appearance couldn't have helped much.  If you ever see someone who looks  ten 
years younger than they should,  that person has either suffered or has  just 
always been a miserable sod. Perhaps that's Gods way of compensating."
 "I know what you mean. Do go on."
 "I hung about in a sort of limbo for a few weeks.  I gradually realised that 
I was still existing and took on the form of Victor Torus.  I wandered  about 
Burlington  for a few days,  before it occurred to me to look for  someone  I 
knew.  I was surprised when Brian Jones could see me.  No one else  could.  I 
scared him pretty bad at first.  When he calmed down enough to talk to me, he 
told me what a ghost was.  I told him my story much as I told it last  night, 
though I left the bit out about the soup."
 "That was kind," I said.
 "In  fact,  my story is kinda the reason we returned here.  Brian wanted  to 
tell it to you to make up for 'borrowing' those bits from your journal."
 "Stealing," I corrected.
 "Whatever.  Anyway,  he  chickened out,  but you still got your  tale.  I've 
probably told it better than Brian ever could. He left early this morning for 
his own time. He left this!"
 Sheila  lent  down underneath a nearby table and pulled out  a  half  gallon 
pickle jar. She put it on the bar.
 "What is it?" I asked picking it up.
 "A pickle jar full of alcohol," she said.
 "I mean what's the thing inside it? You ninny!"
 "Guess!"
 "Part of a rolled up fire hose?"
 "Don't be silly!"
 The  thing moved suddenly.  I dropped the jar with a yell.  It was  made  of 
plastic and didn't break. Sheila laughed.
 "Don't worry,  it's dead alright.  I reached out with my mind and gave it  a 
twitch just then."
 "What on Earth is it?" I picked the jar up again.
 "It's my body. Didn't you hear the end of the tale?"
 "No. I told you, I sneaked away near the end," I said.
 "Sorry. So you did!"
 And that was when Sheila Stevens finally told me what was in the jar.
 I  put  it  on  the shelf at the back of the bar  next  to  Richard  Thrum's 
mirrored head.  When I'd put it there,  months ago,  I'd hoped Richard's head 
would  have been an ice breaker for customers.  It hadn't been.  Most  people 
thought it was an ornament and ignored it.
 There was no way they could ignore the contents of that jar.  Even  although 
the head was bashed in,  maybe a medical man would recognise the contents.  I 
doubt that anyone else would recognise a 'pork' tapeworm when they saw one.

= MAGIC POCKETS =============================================================
 by Richard Karsmakers


 "No! Please! Loucynda! Don't!"
 Cronos Warchild,  mercenary annex hired gun, heard the muffled echoes of his 
own  voice reflect off the fungi-stained walls.  Dazed,  he sat  upright  and 
shook his head.
 Ever since puberty,  he had been having these dreams. 'Wet dreams' he called 
them, because they usually ended with him waking up, soaked in sweat.
 He  shook his head again,  trying to get rid of the image of  Loucynda,  his 
betrothed, on the insides of his eyelids.
 Warchild had for quite a while now not been able to cope with females -  nor 
with  the activities most other men in the universe tended to wish to  employ 
with them.
 All this had started when a girl had kicked him in his vital parts at one of 
the  few  moments  during a day when his  multi-absorb  groin  protector  was 
switched  off.  He  still  felt the pain sometimes.  He  still  had  horribly 
realistic flashbacks,  sometimes in the middle of day - or in the middle of a 
public place.  Flashbacks that would make him go through all of it again; the 
intense  agony as if he was being gnawed upon by a Zarctonic Megaleech -  and 
the  casual,  satisfied  grin  on the girl's face.  The  blackness  that  had 
followed.
 "No! Please! Mel! Don't!"
 He  found himself looking at the square face of a man of which the  rest  of 
his  body was as squarely built as that face.  Long black sideburns clung  to 
it. It looked confused - to say the least.
 Here he was.  Cronos Warchild,  the man that could scare the shit out of any 
living being, the man that had more enemies in the world than you could shake 
machine guns at.
 He had been beaten by a girl.  He was now frightened of the mere prospect of 
doing anything with females other than killing or ignoring them.
 He  launched  his fist angrily at the square face with the  long  sideburns, 
shattering the mirror.

 He  went downstairs,  eyeing the owner of the motel with a lethal look  when 
the poor man brought up the subject of payment.
 Not  long  after  he had exited the establishment - if indeed  it  had  been 
anything established - he had noticed someone following him.
 At first,  the person following him seemed to go through considerable length 
to  avoid being spotted.  The figure hid behind garbage cans and lamp  posts, 
ceased walking when Cronos did.
 Maybe this day was not going to be as bad as he had thought at first.
 As Warchild progressed through the early morning streets of  town,  however, 
his tail seemed to grow less and less concerned with the possibility of being 
discovered.  This  disconcerted the mercenary annex hired gun somewhat -  the 
thought that the person was perhaps not afraid at all of being seen following 
the most notorious killer machine in the universe *was* rather unusual.
 However,  this thought did not bother Cronos' brain cell all too much - for, 
indeed, he was trained to fight and not to think.
 As Warchild turned around a corner he quickly turned around.  The person, in 
case he would still be following, would not expect to be awaited.
 Nobody came.
 For a short while after he had stopped around that corner,  ready to strike, 
footsteps that weren't his had echoed through the silence of morning rising.
 They had seemed to come nearer, and then suddenly they had stopped.
 He looked back around the corner to see what had happened.
 He gazed straight into a pair of viciously cool shades,  worn by a  juvinile 
in  viciously cool clothes,  wearing viciously cool sneakers and  an  equally 
cool cap.
 "Hi dad!" the juvinile exclaimed.
 Warchild could not honour this with a reply.
 "Dad? Dad?"
 For the moment, Cronos heard no more. He had fainted.

 It  had  been  a  long  time ago.  As a matter  of  fact,  it  had  been  so 
stupefyingly  long ago that Warchild even subconsciously seemed to have  lost 
all recollections of the event.
 Now  the  recollection came back like rocks being hurled at  him  by  people 
yelling "Blasphemy! Blasphemy!"
 She had been called Penelope Sunflower - a name quite ill fitting to a woman 
of her size and character.  She had been a woman whose subtleness would  make 
Caterpillar destruction machines seem devices made solely for the grooming of 
flowers.  Her smile had made rabid pitbulls seem friendly,  her kiss had made 
unanaesthetised  castration  seem  alluring,  her singing  had  made  nuclear 
explosions  seem  the  united voices of one or two young  virgins  singing  a 
biblical  hymn.  The folds of her voluptuous flesh could have hidden a  small 
army's weaponry with a year's supply of ammo.  Her weight would not have been 
considered  credible  enough  for inclusion in the Univeral  Edition  of  the 
Guiness Book of Records - and that's *without* her wearing make-up! Her many, 
many  gallons of blood had to be pumped through her vast body by means of  an 
enormous device that still burnt coal,  discreetly hidden in one of the  many 
folds  of  her  flesh.  Her erogenous zones could only  be  stimulated  by  a 
thousand  dwarves carrying road drills that would crawl into her  very  pores 
and bash the nerves' synapses.  Her snoring had been easy to confuse with the 
mating  call  of  the Zanzobarian Tera-Whale and had  virtually  led  to  the 
extinction of this remarkable species of mammal. When she had died,  the only 
place  where  she  was allowed to be buried had been the  Platonic  Ocean  on 
Bulbobkov Gamma - and environmentalists had protested.
 Yet,  in her own peculiar way,  she had loved Cronos.  And,  in his possibly 
even  more  peculiar way,  Cronos Warchild had loved her.  When he  had  been 
around  Penelope  Sunflower,  he found that words failed  him,  that  violent 
feelings  of  love surged through his veins,  and that his steel  nerves  and 
concrete muscles turned all soft.  He also got a strangely tingling sensation 
all over.
 They had only met briefly,  much in the way ships would meet on the ocean of 
life  -  provided  that we're talking about a rather  sturdily  built  battle 
cruiser and the biggest of mammoth tankers here.
 It had been a classic case of 'love at first sight'.  Cronos only needed  to 
see  her  many  folds  of flesh move in  an  unconsciously  seducing  way  to 
instantly lose all remains of sense he had ever possessed. She, for her part, 
needed only to lay eyes on his bulging muscles and square face and she,  too, 
lost all what may once have been sense.
 Their bodies had clashed violently,  excitingly.  Apart from "Will you still 
respect me tomorrow?" and "Yes,  of course!", their love and devotion had not 
been  of  many  words - yet it had  destroyed  cities,  ruptured  continents, 
drained oceans and shuddered the heavens.
 Cronos had slept for a week.  She had smoked an industry quality  cigar.  He 
had slept for another week.
 When he had finally woken up,  she was just having her coal restocked at the 
local mine. He had written her a letter in which he had told her he could not 
possibly  stay with her any longer.  He didn't consider himself a family  man 
and, more importantly, he did not want Penelope Sunflower to be a mercenary's 
spouse. She deserved better. A prince or an emperor - or a paperboy, for that 
matter. He emphasized that he really, utterly and devoutly loved her but that 
nonetheless her future would not be a happy one if she were to stay with him.
 He had left Penelope Sunflower,  the greatest love of his life.  For  months 
after,  he  had  not  been  able  to cross  a  bridge  without  stopping  and 
thoughtfully gazing in the distance,  talking to himself full of remorse with 
his  hands  on the railing.  He had not been able to look  at  happy  couples 
without a sullen growing ache in his heart.
 Penelope  Sunflower  had not even got to reading the  heart-rending  letter. 
When she had heard that the local coal stock had switched to gas, she had got 
a stroke that had killed off her last remaining brain cells. Her last cry had 
torn  the skies asunder,  causing global atmospherical changes on her  planet 
and its two moons.  Her last few tears had flooded a medium-sized metropolis. 
Her last sigh had wrecked a building.
 Medical assistance had arrived too late,  mainly due to sudden heavy weather 
and a mysterious flood. Penelope Sunflower, the only woman ever to get Cronos 
Warchild engaged in acts of human reproduction, had been no more.
 Scientists had,  however,  been able to dig from her womb a foetus two weeks 
old. With the latest in medical equipment they had assured its survival.

 "No! Please! Penelope! Don't!"
 Warchild was sweating in a rather somewhat too profuse way.  Another one  of 
those 'wet dreams' of his.
 "Dad?"
 He  opened  his eyes,  gazing straight into a pair of shades,  topped  by  a 
viciously cool baseball cap.  On the bright green jacket of the youth who was 
wearing these items he could see the initials "BK".  Closest to his head were 
a pair of viciously cool sneakers.
 While  he  had  had his eyes closed,  he had hoped for it all to  be  but  a 
nightmare.  He  had  hoped that he would open his eyes to  the  fungi-stained 
ceiling supported by four fungi-stained walls in the cheapest of all motels.
 Alas. It wasn't. Not even slightly.
 "Hi,"  the  youth  said  as if trying to ascertain  Cronos  that  he  wasn't 
dreaming, "I am Cronos Warchild Jr., son of the late Penelope Sunflower - may 
she rest in peace forever in the Platonic Ocean on Bulbobkov Gamma."
 The boy seemed to have trouble swallowing something.
 Cronos' lower jaw lowered itself abruptly and unconsciously.
 "I  am  the coolest person this side of Klaxos 9," the  juvinile  proceeded, 
"and therefore you may call me the Bitmap Kid."

= REVENGE OF THE MUTANT CAMELS ==============================================
 by Richard Karsmakers

 This piece was written after having seen "Watership Down".  I also threw  in 
the "Men In Suits" concept. It starts, like all too many of my writings, with 
a sunset.


 It  was  misty.  The mist transformed the sunset to a  rare  experience,  an 
occasion that would have enriched the lives of anyone who would have bothered 
to behold it.
 Alas,  there was noone but one lonely rabbit to look at it.  Its eyes glowed 
as  if it felt everything the sunset portended within the very depth  of  its 
soul.
 It startled and glanced back quickly when it heard the rustle of leaves  and 
branches behind it,  and poised for a jump that could save its life in case a 
ferret,  weasel or fox turned out to have stolen up through the  undergrowth. 
Luckily it was but the wind.
 The evening was gaining. The air grew chiller.
 It hopped back in a hole that was almost invisible; a patch of black in deep 
darkness. It vanished in it, its fluffy white tail last.

 "Why were you outside that long?"
 The  voice belonged to an older rabbit,  a female.  It conveyed  worry,  not 
scolding.
 "I  had  a  strange feeling,  mum," the younger  rabbit  answered  while  it 
continued further into the hole towards his mother,  "a strange feeling  that 
tells me the people of the nearby farm have our kind imprisoned in cages."
 Whitesocks had always been different from all the other rabbits.  Where  the 
others had been interested primarily in gaining food and the discovery of new 
holes,  Whitesocks  had always roamed around through the  meadows,  seemingly 
uninterested in earthly rabbit's matters.
 "I see," mother rabbit answered thoughtfully.
 "Shouldn't  we tell our leader,  Winston?" Whitesocks  wondered.  His  large 
black eyes looked at his mother admiringly.
 She was silent for a while,  then nodded her head slowly,  folding back  her 
beautifully long ears.
 "Yes," she said, "we should."
 The both of them wandered off through the vast maze of tunnels under the Big 
Oak on Table Hill; in search for Winston, chief of the Glwad.

 The  smell of cigar smoke was prevalent.  It made Whitesocks' eyes  water  a 
bit, made a cough gather in his lungs.
 "What  are you crying for,  son?" the deep,  warm voice of the chief  rabbit 
asked,  booming  majestically off the soft sand walls.  It sounded  powerful, 
authorative, yet not threatening in any way.
 Whitesocks looked up at his mother,  afraid to reply.  She put a  protecting 
paw around him.
 "There's no need to be afraid,  son," the voice boomed again, but now softer 
and more soothing than before,  "I am not going to eat you.  Just tell me why 
you and your mother want to see me."
 Whitesocks gathered courage.
 "I...well...sir...Mr Winston...er...I..."
 A warm,  gently laugh arouse from the chief rabbit's throat.  It was a laugh 
that could melt hearts,  build bridges and break ice.  At once,  it was as if 
palpable  love  and  goodness flowed from the chief's being  into  the  other 
rabbits that were present.
 Whitesocks  cleared his throat and explained all about the strange  feelings 
he  had  had;  the visions of helpless rabbits,  imprisoned,  waiting  to  be 
slaughtered and eaten on some or other festive occasion.
 When the young rabbit had finished its tale, Winston nodded.

 There was no moon. The sky was dark, and even blacker clouds of smoke seemed 
to fall down towards the earth with the rain.  The sound of undergrowth being 
pushed  aside indicated movement.  Dark,  shadowed silhouettes moved  quickly 
through the grass,  whispering.  They were heading for the farmhouse that lay 
on the horizon like a giant, immobile animal.
 As they came closer to the threatening farmhouse that loomed up above  them, 
their whispers became even softer.
 "They're  probably in the barn," a voice whispered slightly louder than  the 
others, "I think I hear them."
 The barn door was ajar,  but only just so.  Some sturdy rabbits had to press 
it open wider so that all of them could enter.
 Inside it was dark,  too. From a far corner, the restless soft neighing of a 
horse  could be heard.  Straight ahead of them they could faintly  see  steel 
grating.  Behind the steel grating they could hear the breathing of  rabbits. 
They seemed to be asleep.
 It was Whitesocks who ventured closer to the grating.  As his eyes grew used 
to the darkness inside,  he saw that the grating made up the door of a  large 
cage, all other sides of which were made of wood. The hinges were at the top, 
looking  quite  solid but sufficiently rusty.  The cage was  located  on  the 
ground,  so he could vaguely see the shape of five or six rabbits inside. The 
imprisoned rabbits were a lot fatter than them.
 Whitesocks went even closer,  up to the point when he could almost touch the 
grating with his paw.
 At that moment one of the rabbits in the cage woke up. An eye opened, but it 
was  not an ordinary eye;  it was almost fluorescent blue with a  deep  black 
centre. It glanced around, almost threateningly.
 "What are you doing?" the eye asked.
 Whitesocks jumped back; the other rabbits all looked.
 "Good," a heavy,  resonating voice exclaimed,  "they are awake.  They may be 
able to help."
 The rabbit inside the cage now awoke the others.  All of them came  forward, 
into the faltering light, looking outside through the grating.
 They were all quite fat,  and they all had those odd,  blue eyes that seemed 
luminescent.  What was even more peculiar was that the rabbits wore pieces of 
cloth  tied around their necks.  On their backs hung another piece of  cloth, 
that also revealed their front paws with only the claws sticking out.
 "What are you doing?" one of the caged rabbits insisted.
 Whitesocks went closer again, his eyes glaring with a sense of purpose, with 
joy.
 "We are going to get you out," the young rabbit enthused, "you can come with 
us and live under the Big Oak on Table Hill!"
 "Indeed,"  a warm,  heavy voice said,  "you can come with us and be  welcome 
among the Glwad."
 The  rabbit  with  the most fluorescent eyes reared on  its  hind  paws  and 
adjusted the piece of cloth around his neck. It regarded Whitesocks intently, 
then  turned  around and spoke to its fellow rabbits in  a  whispered  voice. 
After seconds it turned around again.
 "We will come with you to your place," it said.
 It  looked around as if expecting the free rabbits to applaude.  It  cleared 
its throat.
 "Well," it said,  its eyes scanning the gathering through the grating, "what 
are you waiting for?"
 "What are we waiting for indeed," the leader of the Glwad now said, "we must 
get them out, save them from the butcher's knife!"
 Every rabbit now went to a designated location,  as if all of this had  been 
rehearsed  many  times.  Two eager rabbits climbed the cage  and  started  to 
loosen the hinges.  A couple went to stand guard at the barn door;  the  rest 
stood around and watched, expecting anything.
 With  a clash the cage door fell down,  nearly crushing  inquisitive  little 
Whitesocks who managed to leap aside just in time.
 A light flashed on outside. The horse neighed again, but louder.
 "Quick," one of the rabbits at the barn door exclaimed,  "I think we may get 
company."
 The caged rabbits now came out.  They took their time,  habitually adjusting 
the pieces of cloth around their necks,  or trying to remove dust from  their 
coats  of  cloth.  Their furs were pitch black and their eyes all  similar  - 
threatening blue.
 "My God," Whitesocks' mother uttered, "they almost look like *people*."
 The  leader of the black rabbits lashed a look at her,  his light blue  eyes 
almost  incandescent  with hot anger.  Then he seemed to  regain  his  sense. 
Ignoring her, he walked up to Winston with the other black rabbits following.
 "I  am Aznagtoth," the black rabbit said,  looking the  large,  wise  rabbit 
straight in the eyes, "Take us out of here. They will have heard the noise of 
the cage door falling down. They've got *dogs*."
 Winston signalled all the Glwad to get outside.  The coast was still  clear. 
The rain had ceased but the yard was muddy, preventing fast movement.
 "Go," Winston intoned, "go now."
 While waiting at the barn door, he checked to see every of the Glwad and the 
black rabbits make it to the corn field.  When they had all made it there, he 
began to cross the yard himself.
 At  that moment a door in the farm house opened.  Light gushed out into  the 
courtyard.  In  it stood the silhouette of a man with a double-barreled  shot 
gun.
 "It's  rabbits,  love," the silhouette seemed to call to someone inside  the 
house. A muffled voice shouted back something about dinner.
 "Go!" Winston cried to the others that waited at the edge of the corn  field 
while he remained in the middle of the yard, "Go! Now!"
 "It's surely a nice fat one," the silhouette now mused,  more to itself than 
to anyone else.
 It aimed the gun.
 The  leader of the Glwad had to trust his instincts.  The right leap at  the 
right moment.  He had done it often when he was younger. But the right moment 
came too fast.  He was getting older.  Older and wiser - but fatter and  less 
agile, too.
 There was a short flash of light that reflected for an instant off the  eyes 
of the other rabbits that watched, aghast. The flash was immediately followed 
by a short burst of thunder.
 Winston seemed to leap,  but it was no leap;  it was the impact of lead that 
hurled his lifeless body a metre or two across the yard.  Blood coloured  the 
cobbles, mixed with the mud.
 "Come on," Aznagtoth said,  his eyes cold and calculating,  "you heard  him. 
Run. To Oak Hill!"
 Whitesocks swallowed something.  There lay Winston, leader of the Glwad. Red 
stains on his fur, his eyes staring glazedly into nothingness.
 His mother pulled him behind her as they all ran off through the corn fields 
to Oak Hill.

 The  scent  of death hung in the tunnel complex under the Big Oak  on  Table 
Hill;  the  scent of death and fear.  Huddled forms scurried off  in  several 
directions.  None lingered,  none talked.  The tunnel walls were covered with 
fungi and all kinds of other rotting substances.  There was a perpetual  mist 
drifting through the complex. There was an uncanny silence.
 Life had changed a lot since the black rabbits had been rescued, a year ago. 
They had taken over as leaders of the Glwad, reigning with the instruments of 
fear,  terror and hatred.  Strong Glwad rabbits, forming the Glwad Guard, got 
food  in  exchange  for suppressing the others - old friends  and  their  own 
families.  The Glwad name that had once been revered and honoured now  tasted 
bitter, carrying with it the thoughts of oppression and poverty.
 "This  must  stop,"  a voice whispered.  Through  the  perpetual  mist  came 
Whitesocks, who had just spoken. He looked beaten. Older. Determined. Next to 
him limped another rabbit.  Both of them looked weak and frail,  with only  a 
small flame of courage and hope flickering in their black eyes.
 "Of course it must," the other rabbit replied in a hushed voice,  "but  what 
is there to do?  If we but speak up Aznagtoth will have the Glwad Guard  will 
strike us down - or worse."
 Whitesocks nodded.  He knew the other rabbit was right.  But he *had* to  do 
something. *Something* had to be done.
 "Hush," he whispered as he heard the sound of feet nearing.
 From the mist arose Whitesocks' mother.  She limped, too, and looked beaten. 
>From her mouth came ragged breathing.
  "Mother!"  Whitesocks cried,  "what have they done to you?" He  put  a  paw 
around her in an effort to comfort. She sobbed, shaking. He got no answer.
 Instead,  more steps sounded.  Fast steps,  hurrying.  Out of the mist arose 
another  rabbit.  It  was a member of the Glwad Guard,  a  magnificent  brown 
rabbit.  It  wore  the  uniform of the Guard - a cloth around  its  neck  and 
another  piece of cloth covering its back and front paws with only the  claws 
sticking out.
 "What  are you doing here?" it bellowed,  "You know that gatherings of  more 
than two are strictly forbidden!"
 "Yes...sir," stuttered Whitesocks' mother softly between breaths, "but..."
 The Guard struck her down hard,  his claws leaving three parallel trails  of 
blood  across her cheek and shoulder.  She fell against a fungi-stained  wall 
and remained lying there, motionless.
 The defiant little flame in Whitesocks' eyes flared up to a fire of fury. He 
leapt at the Guard,  attempting to strike him blind or otherwise hurting him. 
His momentum hurled them both against the ground, tearing apart the mist. The 
Guard's head collided with a rather sturdy piece of root that protruded  from 
the  floor.  A  sickening crack burst open his skull.  Red  and  grey  flowed 
abundantly, soiling the tunnel.
 "You...you  killed  a  guard,"  the  other  rabbit  cried,  astonished,  but 
Whitesocks didn't hear. He went to his mother.
 "Mum," he whispered hoarsely in her ear, "mum!"
 When he looked at her more closely he saw that her chest didn't move up  and 
down any more.  She had stopped breathing.  He tried to listen to the beating 
of her heart but heard none.
 He  swallowed.  He saw the glazed eyes of Winston again for a brief  moment, 
exactly  like  they so often stared at him from  recurring  nightmares,  then 
looked  once again into the glazed eyes of his mother.  He sat for a  moment, 
then erected himself.
 "It will have to stop," he proclaimed.
 He disappeared in the lingering mist again. The other rabbit followed.

 It promised to be a beautiful day.  The pre-dawn glimmer of dew covered  the 
meadows,  the sky was filled with early birds that danced through the air and 
sang their songs of joy.  A magnificent black rabbit sat under the Big Oak on 
Table  Hill,  near a rabbit hole entrance it was guarding.  It looked at  the 
first fragile rays of the sun rising above the horizon, but it felt no warmth 
or happiness at the sight.
 The rabbit wore the Glwad Guard uniform with style,  radiating authority. It 
was probably an officer of sorts.  too bad there was nobody to see it but the 
blind sun that rose slowly.  The Guard habitually adjusted the piece of cloth 
around his neck.
 A small black spot in the sky grew larger.
 The  rabbit  looked around,  bored.  He hated these  early  morning  shifts. 
Especially  since  so many of his kind seemed to have  disappeared  on  them. 
Something out there,  something unknown to the black rabbits or to the  other 
Glwad Guards under their influence.
 Some  kind  of  instinct  seemed to struggle inside  the  rabbit  -  but  it 
suppressed the feeling of danger this instinct brought.  No creature was more 
superior  than  the black rabbits and those who worked  together  with  them. 
None,  that is,  except maybe for the humans. But these were far away enough. 
There was nothing to be afraid of.  Fear was something for the lesser  Glwad, 
the  kind they got food for to keep down.  Who needed instincts when you  got 
slaves  to  get you the food you want,  to get rich amounts  of  berries  and 
stores filled with grain and corn?
 The small black speck took on the form of a small bird.
 The magnificent rabbit in a suit adjusted its tie again.  It mused about how 
great  it was to be superior.  To get what you want without  any  danger.  To 
suppress  the  lesser rabbits.  To be able to wear the uniform of  the  Glwad 
Guard.
 The small bird became bigger.
 Nature  itself was at the feet of the Glwad Guard.  They could  do  whatever 
they  wanted.  Nobody  could stop them.  They did not need  their  instincts. 
Aznagtoth had said so.  Aznagtoth was right. Aznagtoth was always right. They 
would rule supreme forever.

 The hawk struck swiftly, accurately and deadly.
 All that remained of the magnificent black rabbit were some pieces of cloth, 
lying amidst a couple of feathers. Thus nature prevailed once more.
