 Never  had I thought it would be so easy to get  recognition.  Originally  I 
sent out "Twilight Zone" Volume 1 Issue 1 to about half a dozen people,  most 
of them just friends that I happened to know the email address of, and a mere 
couple of days after that I already got subscription requests of people I had 
never heard of before. It surely seems that there are enough people out there 
(yes,  you!)  who  like  to read fiction,  which is definitely  the  kind  of 
motivation  I need to keep on doing something the likes of  "Twilight  Zone". 
Thank  you,  therefore,  for your support and your willingness to  want  this 
second issue bad enough to subscribe to it.
 Er...someone interested in doing sortof a graphics-like "Twilight Zone" logo 
using ASCII <128? I'd be much obliged.

 Hope you'll like this issue. Lots of fun reading,



 Richard Karsmakers

                A Tale From The Tavern On The Edge Of Nowhere.


 The  Abcronxuddlern  grinned with needle tipped poisoned teeth.  A  drop  of 
milky  poison was licked from its thin lips with much relish.  It extended  a 
massive hand on the end of one of its almost skeletal arms, towards me.
 With  a noise like a switchblade opening,  a stumpy,  black splintered  claw 
sprang out from its index finger.
 "Here, allow me!" It growled.
 A  year  ago,  I would have fainted dead away with fright,  but now  I  just 
smiled  and handed over the green crystal bottle.  With a pop of  gases,  the 
Abcronxuddlern  levered off the stainless steel cap from the beer bottle  and 
handed it back.
 "Thanks," I said.
 "No  problem."  Its claw never made a sound when it sprang back  in  to  its 
fleshy home.  Someone told me that the 'Crons don't need to make a noise when 
their claws spring out. When they are feeling comfortable, the claws slip out 
in a noisy manner. When they are feeling aggressive, the claws slip out quite 
a bit slower, in total silence.
 The  worse thing to watch for in a 'Cron is when they lose control of  their 
claws.  When  they  start to slip silently in and out in a  seemingly  absent 
minded fashion,  you are in trouble.  That's a sign that violence is not  far 
away.
 To make matters even more confusing,  they seem tense when they are  feeling 
relaxed.  If  they  look relaxed,  then something is bothering them  and  you 
better watch out.
 This Abcronxuddlern was so happy and comfortable that an Earthman,  who  I'd 
just  noticed  sitting on a stool at the other end of the almost  empty  bar, 
mistook  its  body language for aggression and drew a large  gun.  "Put  that 
away,  bud!"  I  laughed  at  his  nervousness.  "There's  a  beam  nullifier 
operating! Directed energy weapons don't work in here."
 "This isn't a beamer.  It's chemical," He said.  His voice was high pitched, 
almost feminine, and nasal with it. He sounded like that woman on the Channel 
18 Newszine, but with a cold.
 His  clothes looked as if they belonged in the 1990's but his manner  seemed 
out of another century.  He had an air of sadness and femininity that  seemed 
to be very out of place with his bad skin and mousey features.
 "Even more reason to put it away then. There's a selective friction field in 
operation as well.  You'll blow your hand off if you try to use it." This bit 
was a lie.
 No  matter  what you may have heard about friction fields,  they  are  total 
garbage.  If one was operating,  I'd need to spoon out the drinks with an ice 
cream scoop. Folks would choke trying to drink their favourite tipple.
 It  had been very quiet in the Tavern today.  The rest of the bar staff  was 
around  the  back,  pretending  to be tiding out the stores  -  but  actually 
sitting with their feet up gossiping.
 Thursdays were usually quiet.  At least,  I think it was Thursday. Sometimes 
it's  difficult to keep track of time when you work in a bar at the  edge  of 
space and time.
 "Are you male or female?" Growled the 'Cron good-naturedly.
 "Why?" The Earthman started to put the gun back under his coat.
 "Tell it, Tony." It gave a long throaty grow and wandered off towards one of 
the dark sleeping booths in the far left hand corner.
 "It was laughing at you.  Abcronxuddlern's are hermaphrodites!  They've  got 
both sets of organs under that black fur.  They choose their sexual roles  by 
combat.  The  loser  assumes the role of female.  Their society is  built  on 
consenting rape!"
 "There's no such thing!" The Earthman gave a disgusted look and crossed  his 
legs.
 "It  was implying that you'd already lost a fight.  Haven't you ever met  an 
alien before?"
 "No."
 "From Earth?  I'm of Earth decent, but I was born in orbit. I'm an L5 Trojan 
baby." This seemed to puzzle him. He didn't answer.
 I  took  a long suck from my bottle of beer and wondered for  the  umpteenth 
time where all the bottle openers had gone.
 "What's  your poison?" I asked,  wiping froth from my lips with the back  of 
one hairy scarred hand.
 "You stock beer? I really need one." I got the impression that he was deeply 
distressed about something.
 "Do  we stock beer!  Only over four hundred and twenty  varieties.  From  23 
different planets and 16 major time zones.
 "Time zones? You mean, I'm not the only time traveller that's been in here?"
 "Oh,  no.  Not by a long chalk.  We get them now and then.  One in last week 
from 2039.  Think he was called John Brendan.  He claims to have been a  good 
friend of mine in one of the alternates. Says that I died when I was 21 in an 
accident  with a parabolic asteroid smelter.  I looked identical to the  Tony 
Wheelbough from his Universe except that that Tony had a middle name and I've 
none. Creepy, huh? When you from?"
 "Been  living  in the 1980s for about the last six  years.  Originally  from 
1901. Scotland."
 "Bloody hell!  We've never had a record breaker in here before.  This  calls 
for a drink on the house. Time travel's only existed officially since 1995."
 "So I gather." He gave a deep sigh.
 I fumbled under the bar and triggered the auto-chooser.  It was a  partially 
organic  computer that used comparative subliminal telepathy to deduce  which 
drink the customer would get the most pleasure from. It was hardly ever used. 
Most customers didn't like being told what they wanted.
 "Can you prove you're from 1901."
 "No and I don't want to.  Just want to forget about everything.  Time travel 
has ruined my life."
 "You're in the right place to get things off your chest."
 I  took  the  bottle that had appeared in the hopper  of  the  auto-chooser, 
brushed the thick dusk off the label and poured him out a large measure  into 
a heavy, transparent plastic cup.
 "This isn't beer?"
 "What do you want for nothing? Drink it."
 He gave a shrug and poured the whole measure into himself without stopping.
 "Oh,  boy  is  that good.  You can feel it doing the harm as it  goes  down! 
Scotch?"
 I poured him another large one and then showed him the label.
 "Thought so. Glen Lowtil 1850? Never heard of it, but what a year!"
 "Think it comes from Alternative Universe 4.  It's very rare.  We don't  get 
much trade with the Alternates. Too much power expenditure to open a Vinculum 
for long."
 He downed the second glass in another long swallow.
 "Slow  down  a bit there!  What grieves you?" I put the bottle down  and  he 
helped  himself to another.  I was relieved when he didn't drink it  straight 
down.  Just  cradled it in his small delicate hands and gazed sadly into  the 
golden liquid.
 "Huh! What doesn't?" He spoke quietly and gave a deep sigh.
 "Woman trouble?" I said.
 "Isn't it always?" He took another mouthful. For a second, I thought that he 
was going to cry.
 "Who's the dame?" I asked. It had been a quiet day. If I could encourage him 
to talk, maybe I could kill an hour.
 "Me."
 I know what you're thinking,  I must have picked him up wrong. You're right. 
That's what I did think for about 5 seconds,  then I remembered that he was a 
time traveller.
 Ever since creatures first thought up the idea of time travel,  they've been 
writing  fiction  about time travellers who fall in love with  one  of  their 
Great Grandparents or their future descendents.  In fiction,  this is  always 
shown to be dangerous.  The writers always assume that such actions would  be 
harmful to the space/time continuum.
 They always give very complex reasoning as to why this would be bad for  the 
space/time continuum.  But, as any time traveller would tell you if they were 
allowed to, this is utter rubbish! Time cannot change. Every eventuality that 
is possible is happening somewhere right now. A myriad of alternate universes 
exists like a tapestry of tangled, not quite infinite, spaghetti.
 I realise that the phrase,  *not quite infinite*,  is like saying, *slightly 
pregnant*, but it's the nearest to an accurate description that I can manage.
 Time  travellers  can't change time.  Their current actions make  them  jump 
uncontrollably  between alternate realities,  so that it looks to  them  that 
history has changed.
 Say that you did the  old,  going-back-in-time-and-killing-your-Grandfather-
before-your-own-birth routine.  When you got back to your own time,  it would 
appear that history had been changed. You'd be wrong.
 History  would  always have been that way.  You'd just be  in  an  alternate 
universe  where  your Grandfather had been killed by a  time  traveller  from 
another alternative universe. Your original reality would still be there.
 Knowing  this  means that you could get back in your time machine  and  jump 
back  into  the reality where your Grandfather didn't  get  killed,  to  find 
nothing had changed.
 Unfortunately,  for time travellers,  reality jumping is an inexact science. 
They  often slip sideways in time and never notice it for  weeks;  until  the 
differences  show up and then it becomes really difficult to find  their  way 
back  to  their original reality.  Everything will look the same  until  they 
realize  that,  say,  their  favourite  colour was once  red  and  now  their 
possessions show a predominance of blue. At other times the changes may be so 
subtle that they never notice at all.  This sort of thing happens to them all 
the time.
 Time travellers are crazy mixed up people.
 The  only  reality jumping that is totally safe is the mini  secured  inter-
dimensional  vinculum.  To  you  and me,  that means  a  black  hole.  Nearly 
impossible to find, there are only a few in the known universes, and they are 
ridiculously expensive to open.
 "Safe"  is not exactly the sort of word one would be tempted to bandy  about 
in the vicinity of an gravitational force of interplanetary strength which is 
the size of a squashed melon.
 The word "safe",  when connected to black holes,  means less than one chance 
in a ten of being squashed to the size of an atomic nucleus.  That brings the 
odds of completing a two way journey down to one in five.
 Not  bad  odds  if you're getting paid a  million  credits  per  jump.  It's 
rumoured that the owner of the Tavern made the jump 12 times before  quitting 
and investing the money in the business.  It's also rumoured that the man who 
took  the next jump that he was thinking of going on,  the 13th  jump,  never 
came back.
 Personally,  a million credits isn't enough.  What does that buy these days? 
Maybe a really nice car or a third hand time machine?
 Not even enough creds to buy your own house.
 I could understand someone being tempted to do the trip once or  twice,  but 
12 TIMES! Time travellers are not the only crazy people about!
 Enough of this banter.  I've digressed enough for the time being.  It's time 
to get back to the main story.
 "The woman who's mucked up your life is you?"
 "Yes."
 "Well  I've time to kill.  Tell me your story." I joined him on his side  of 
the bar, opened an extra large bag of Dodo flavoured crisps and pulled over a 
stool.
 "Time  to kill.  How appropriate." So saying,  he took another  mouthful  of 
Scotch and began to talk.

 "It was 1985. I had been making a living for sometime as a gambler.
 Nothing big, you understand. Not the football pools or anything like that.
 Just small bets spread throughout two dozen betting shops. I'd jump forwards 
a week,  buy a paper with the racing results,  jump back and put the bets on. 
Now  and  then  I'd  lose sizeable bets deliberately  so  no  one  would  get 
suspicious.
 I'm led to believe that the time police monitor all famous gamblers,  so I'd 
get  different  trustees  most times to put on each bet for  a  part  of  the 
winnings.
 I  had to be very careful.  All it would take was one mention of my  amazing 
luck  in  a newspaper and the time police would be down on me like a  ton  of 
bricks.
 That never happened. Never get greedy, that's the secret.
 Life  was  as  perfect as it could be.  Good food,  everything  I  wanted  - 
including enough money to pursue my scientific interests. The only thing that 
was missing was the love of a good woman. That was not really missing because 
I didn't need anyone else in my life.
 Or so I thought.
 It was a Saturday when she walked into my life. It was the Grand National. I 
had  just  personally  put a hundred and fifty pounds on  the  nose  of  Last 
Suspect. With a name like that, I would have bet on it anyway. On the way out 
of the betting office, I bumped into her.
 "Sorry!" I started.
 "Oh,  there you are. Thought I'd gotten the wrong place." Her voice was high 
pitched but rough,  as if she had a sore throat.  I started to tell her  that 
she must have mistaken me for someone else when I was bewitched by her smile.
 It was a case of love at first sight.  She was not what you'd call a  looker 
but to me she was an angel.
 A love so strong out of the blue like that was frightening. Bam! It was like 
a firework exploding inside me.  A wibbly wobbly feeling under the ribs and a 
coldness  of  the  skin as blood drained suddenly  from  the  extremities.  A 
fluttering pain in the stomach. A lightness in the head.
 From the beginning, everything was strange about her. I felt as if I'd known 
her all my life. Her plain curveless body excited me with an intensity that I 
would  previously  have  found  impossible to  believe  could  exist  in  our 
ephemeral sphere of existence.
 Her  legs incased in sheer black nylon were lumpy and too  muscly.  A  small 
swell of a bosom and a manly square jaw. Her short, dark hair was sexless and 
her  skin had that roughness that only those who have had a lifetime  out  of 
doors can acquire.
 There  was  a vigour and strength about her that emanated from  her  totally 
feminine smile. When she smiled, she smiled not only with her entire body but 
with her soul. A soul that reached out of the one part of her body that could 
be  conventionally called sensual.  Her eyes.  Blue flecked,  grey  pools  of 
tangible eroticism.
 I fell into those pools and came out of the other side a weaker man full  of 
an  arousal  that must surely have been sent straight with  a  blessing  from 
Satan's dark loins.
 Why  I  felt this way about this stranger froze me to the very  core  of  my 
marrow  with terror.  Yet,  there was a bitter sweetness to the  terror  that 
complemented the very fabric of this sudden and total devotion.
 One thing only softened the fear. Her reaction to me was the same as mine to 
her.  Hot and passionate,  our bodies came together like lovers that had been 
long parted. We kissed long and hard before coming down to earth with a sharp 
jolt.
 "Eer,  you's should be ashamed. Behaving like that in public. Yide think you 
were teenagers!"
 It  was an old woman clutching a betting slip.  She pushed past us  and  out 
into the quite coolness of the street.  Laughingly, we followed hand in hand, 
soul in soul, behind her.
 That  week became an awakening dream that hurt to remember.  A  single  long 
explosion  of  primitive  orgasm.  An intercourse  of  souls.  Two  sweating, 
straining,  intertwined creatures of pure sexual instinct.  A single organism 
agape in its obsession.  Needing.  Demanding.  Burning.  Eating.  Hurting.  A 
passion of infinite depth. A fiery universe of lust.
 And then, with a strange suddenness, the madness was over.
 The talking began.
 As the story unfolded,  the intensive fear came back. It deepened and slowly 
turned into disgust and hate.
 She was also a time traveller.  More precisely,  we were both the same  time 
traveller. She was me. I was her. We were one and the same person.
 I had been born with the XX chromosomes of a woman.  The hormones of my body 
were  all wrong.  I never grew facial hair and my voice  never  broke.  These 
things never bothered me. I was a man who never cared for body things.
 Some time in the future, in a far off century, a drug was created that would 
develop  the  sexual body of an individual to the pattern  contained  in  the 
genetic structure of the chromosomes.
 No more would there be unhappy macho women with muscles and a moustache.  No 
more men with smooth,  shapely legs and feminine graces.  The individual  was 
free  to  develop  their  real self in a physical way  that  had  never  been 
possible before.  A lot of sad people had been freed.  I was not one of those 
sad people. I was from a century that knew little about chromosomes. She only 
came looking for me to warn me.
 Sometime in the near future, I would commit the unforgivable crime of murder 
and go on the run through time.  Taking the chromosome corrector was just  an 
extreme method of disguising myself from the time police.  Time is a one  way 
street, but crime is still crime. Murder is still murder.
 She  came back for me with the impossible idea of changing time so that  the 
murder would never happen.
 It was unfortunate,  but inevitable,  that we would fall in love.  Mankind's 
animal  herd instincts make us search for those most like us to  breed  with. 
Who  is  more instinctively and hormonal suitable than  a  sexually  opposite 
exact copy of one's self?
 Exact fitting chemical pheromones provide the strongest of aphrodisiacs.  An 
instinctively  perfect understanding of each others body language and  sexual 
desires are a time bomb. Animal lust can be the only outcome.
 I felt so angry. So dirty.
 In the society in which I was brought up,  the worse thing that one could do 
was to be caught touching one's self in a sexual way. I had sex with a female 
version  of  myself.  What  had occurred  was  an  incestuous,  masturbatory, 
homosexual  act of obscenity!  It was a crime of morality that could  not  be 
forgiven.
 How could *she* do such a thing to me?
 The  truth brought me to the edge of madness and over into the red cloud  of 
rage.
 When the mists of hate had cleared, I was standing over her body holding the 
handle of my old revolver.  Blue sulphurous smoke drifted from the barrel and 
my  ears  rang with the deafening silence that followed  the  penetration  of 
another human being by two killing projectiles.
 Two  almost black holes in her side leaked her life away into scarlet  pools 
of betrayal and waste.  There was movement in those sexual eyes.  A  question 
unanswerable.
 Why?
 Then nothing.  That fragile spark, that we call life, was gone for good. She 
didn't live there any more. Oh, my God! What had I done? I had killed her!
 I had killed my self?
 With  my  gun  still smoking,  I ran from that  place.  Must  go  into  time 
and...what?
 I  set  the time machine adrift without any coordinates and drifted  into  a 
morbid  flux  of despair.  A long time later,  I became aware that  the  time 
machine had stopped.
 I  got  out  and found my self outside of what appeared  to  be  a  drinking 
establishment and wandered inside."

 He finished the tale, took a long slug from the bottle and suddenly began to 
sob uncontrollably.  He slumped across the bar.  The bottle was knocked over. 
Most of the remains spilled out before I snatched it up.
 "What am I to do? What am I to do?" He said quietly over and over again.
 He  was  lucky  to be alive.  Every so often,  a  time  machine  with  unset 
coordinates  turns  up here at the edge of time  and  space.  Sometimes,  the 
occupants are dead from starvation or dehydration.  Some,  the luckier  ones, 
end up in here in the Tavern.
 "Have another drink," I said, putting the bottle back down beside him.
 I  went  into the back room and called the time pigs.  Like  the  man  said, 
murder  is still murder.  When I got back he was just finishing of the  final 
remains of the bottle.
 "The worst of it is,  I can't stop it.  Its going to happen again. This time 
I'll be the one who gets killed.  And then It'll happen again,  and again and 
again! Round and round in time until the killing time comes around again!"
 He took a pocket watch out of a coat pocket and put it on the bar.
 "Here.  Payment for the drink. I must go back and try and stop it before the 
cycle gets properly started."
 He  left in a hurry.  I didn't try to stop him.  Video cameras by the  doors 
take pictures of everybody who comes in or out.  The time pigs would get  him 
unless he did something drastic,  like disguising himself by changing his sex 
or hiding out close to the scene of the crime.
 I had a look at the watch.
 Huh!
 Just as I expected. Crappy Victorian junk! I threw it straight in the bin. I 
wouldn't see him again, at least, not in this reality.
 Like I said, time travellers are crazy mixed up people!
 Just then,  one of the far doors was kicked open and a noisy group of bright 
green feathered Arcturan army conscripts breezed nosily into the Tavern. They 
would be itching to spend their monthly pay checks.  There would be many more 
arriving after that lot.
 It was time to call up some more bar staff.
 "Good day gents! What's your poison?"

                            by Richard Karsmakers

 Note: A  rather complex and certainly experimental thing written as part  of 
the ST NEWS magazine software review of Logotron's "Star Ray".
 A part of its original introduction has been left almost intact, which might 
serve to help you a bit.  The actual thing contains three stories that end up 
as one. Well, sortof.

 A  very cold and hard autumn wind is blowing outside.  Gusts of  rain  smash 
into the window panes and make me feel even more lonely and melancholic  than 
I feel (if you know what I mean).  It's dangerous to go outside now;  only in 
last Saturday's papers could be read that the rain had the pH of vinegar...
 Sweet  thoughts about Miranda - the lady of my heart - are floating  through 
my  brain,  together with the fondest wish to be with her  now,  keeping  one 
another  warm while listening to the violent weather outside.  If  only  that 
could be true...
 Tomorrow,  I  will  have  to perform a heavy zoology test  -  which  I  will 
probably  not make successfully since I haven't done anything for it so  far. 
As usual,  at times like these,  I get sudden enormous amounts of inspiration 
and then I just *have* to write. Whether it's any good for my academic future 
or  not.  You  shouldn't feel too guilty now (I already doubted  you  would), 
since  I  couldn't  think of anything else but Miranda  anyway.  She  is  now 
present  in every cell of my brain - even the whole rest of  my  body.  She's 
gorgeous,  sensual and adorable,  nice,  understanding and lots more that  is 
none of your business. She's THE girl for me.
 Isn't it strange? It is as though, outside, the clouds are gathering to form 
a large circle in the skies.  A circle out of which purple light appears.  It 
is raining more viciously by the minute.

 But listen to me now, again talking like a raving mad about girls, girls and 
nothing  but girls.  This here is no medium created for the sole  purpose  of 
spilling  forth my oral diarrhoea,  is it?  So I will now continue with  that 
what we are all here for, somethint called "Star Ray".
 I'm  just wondering what the plot of this will have to be.  I can't seem  to 
come up with a decent one.

                                    *****

               The Growing Pains of Cronos Warchild (Part II)

          (For those of you that hadn't guessed it already: This is
                     where the whole thing really starts)

 Location: Kryptium,  a  small and remote planet somewhere in  the  Universe. 
           Further details not present in database.
 Atmosphere: Almost entirely carbon monoxyde and sulphuric acids.  High water 
             concentration indicates large seas covering its surface.
 Lifeforms: Only minuscule creatures still alive in the seas.
 Remark: Formerly inhabited by humans. Now automatic production plant.

 "What the hell are we here for?!" murmured Cronos Warchild,  mercenary annex 
hired  gun,  when  he checked the readout on his  machine's  plasma  computer 
screen.
 His fist smashed against the control panel,  causing his craft to make  some 
rather unusual movements through the damp and quite dangerously acid sky.
 Had  he known that a computer freak had once been down  there,  hundreds  of 
years  ago,  being  sad and lonely and staring outside to the gusts  of  rain 
smashing against the window pane, Warchild might have felt a bit comforted.
 Then again, he might have not at all.
 He  murmured  a bit more,  turned some knobs on the panel  and  pushed  some 
buttons. The sterile readout screen vanished, to be replaced by the even more 
sterile face of the Home Base Android.
 "Good...." (the Android check its watch) "...evening,  sir.  What might I do 
to make your day a better one?"

 At  a  location  quite  near to Warchild's,  only way  back  in  the  fourth 
dimension, a lonely computer programmer sat in his room. He was also watching 
the  night  sky solemnly,  listening to gusts of rain  smashing  against  the 
window  pane.  Yet  this man was completely unaware of any such  problems  as 
those  that  occurred  with  Warchild - nor for  those  that  occurred  at  a 
relatively  minute  distance eastward that mainly involved  a  stunning  girl 
whose name shall not again be mentioned here as well as the writing of a good 
sort of story with a decent kind of plot.
 He  was playing with his moustache,  much in the way his father  had  always 
told him not to,  when,  suddenly,  he bent forward and typed some code in an 
assembler  program.  To  an  outsider  it might have  appeared  like  he  was 
momentarily  freakin' out.  He looked at the lines,  assembled the  code  and 
executed the program.

 "S(censored)t!"  (Warchild  just uttered an,  unfortunately  commonly  used, 
synonym for an animal's excrements)
 "Pardon me?" the Android on the other end of the line stammered.  "The  word 
you  just utilized is on the list of banned words,  as specified  during  the 
Gore Convention,  July 1994,  and I am therefore  authorized,  yes,  actually 
*obliged*,  to ban YOU from this intercontinental support network.  Thank you 
for  having us attempt to make your day a better one.  Don't bother to do  so 
again.  I  wish you a good..." (the Android checked its watch and  shook  his 
head at his own lack of memory) "...evening.  Have fun being left on your own 
accord."
 BLEEP.
 The  screen  went black again,  and after a picosecond  pause  the  planet's 
status readout reappeared on the screen.
 Warchild's   only  reaction  to  this  fact  was  the  utilization  of   an, 
unfortunately also quite commonly used, synonym for the process through which 
most higher organic lifeforms (especially those with a backbone that live  on 
dry land) try, and indeed often succeed, to multiply themselves.
 Had  the  Android  not immediately disconnected  the  line,  Warchild  would 
probably  have tried one of his Kill-O-Gadgets on him,  electrocuting him  at 
distance, or something likewise.
 But the Android had, so Cronos couldn't.

 An extremely violent gust of rain smashed against the computer  programmer's 
window  again.  He looked up from the keyboard,  realizing that  the  weather 
wasn't particularly improving.
 The phone rang.  He took the receiver without hesitation;  this new game  of 
his  wasn't  coming anywhere,  anyway.  No good  plot.  Answering  the  phone 
wouldn't  hurt  whatever fragment of inspiration that might or might  not  be 
lingering somewhere deep within him.
 "Hello? Steve here."
 "Yeah.  Herbert here," the voice on the other end said, "is that new game of 
yours  coming anywhere,  anyway?  Remember that the deadline's not  far  off, 
please, Steve!"
 "But, er...Herbert, listen, I've got this...."
 "No time to chat now, Steve. Must be goin'! Be hearin' ya!"
 Before the line went dead, the programmer imagined hearing a sound as if two 
connected  plungers were taken apart.  There was also,  so  it  seemed,  some 
sighing and moaning.

 Warchild's trigger finger was getting itchy.  Something BAD had better  turn 
up  soon  so that he could get rid of his frustrations.  On  second  thought, 
something GOOD might also suffice.
 He lowered his craft so that he was now below the thin layers of purple mist 
that  normally  kept  the  planet's  surface  from  sight.  Relatively  small 
production  platforms  could  be seen  on  the  planet's  surface,  regularly 
distributed.
 His lasers spoke. One platform was blasted into thousands of tiny fragments. 
A smile appeared on Cronos' lips. He liked senseless violence.
 If  he would have looked in his rear view mirror,  Warchild would have  seen 
the purple mists transforming into a disc-shaped appearance,  that seemed  to 
draw matter to its centre.
 A message appeared on the on-board computer screen.

 Steve,  the computer programmer, was sitting back in his chair, relaxed. Or, 
rather,  *seemingly* relaxed.  His mind was working overtime. He simply *had* 
to come up with a decent plot, or concept, or whatever, or he could kiss this 
Logotron job goodbye.  Permanently.  He was not even disturbed by the  clouds 
outside, that now seemed to regroup themselves around a centre out of which a 
soft, purple light came.
 He  closed  his  eyes  and thought deep,  completely  unaware  of  what  was 
happening outside now.  If Steve had been an Android, his current state would 
be reffered to as Total Sensory Perception Shutdown.

 A name suddenly popped up in Warchild's mind. A name that he had never heard 
before.  Together with that name, a vision came. A vision of a girl of utmost 
gorgeousness,  niceness,  sensuality,  adorability,  well...everything a  guy 
could possibly want.  For a moment,  her fawnen eyes met his.  Although  this 
never happened in his particular plane of reality, it was as if Cronos' heart 
suddenly melted. As if, unlikely though this sounded, a crust fell off.
 By  then  he had already been sucked in by the tornado of purple  mist  that 
had been gaining behind him.

 ZAP.
 Silence, only if it was for a microsecond.
 BAM! (A very loud 'bam', by the way)
 "Miranda?" the programmer suddenly wondered as he opened his eyes again.  He 
must have been dreaming, as he now saw a gorgeous, nice, sensual and adorable 
girl  walking over the surface of a planet he had never laid eyes  on  before 
now.  A small craft was hanging in the air, having just wiped out what seemed 
like  a small production platform on the surface.  It was now no more than  a 
shapeless heap of garbage.
 Everything  seemed covered by purple light now,  something that  even  Steve 
found extremely weird (him being a game programmer, that should say something 
about the weirdness of it all).  And where,  for heaven's sake, did this girl 
fit in?

 Warchild spotted an alien spacecraft, soaring closer and closer to the girl. 
Who  was  that strange chap down there,  the one with the moustache  and  the 
baldening head?
 No  matter  what,  the  alien craft had to  be  zapped  utterly.  Evaporized 
exceedingly.
 ZAP.
 EVAPORIZE!

 Steve sat stunned in his room,  his eyes wide open.  The window had  broken, 
the  rain was staining the carpet dark wet.  He stood up and looked  outside, 
only to see more rain.  He thought he saw a small purple cloud disappear into 
nothingness in the distance. He felt the rain on his eyes. It burnt a bit.
 "Damn it! Feels like vinegar!" he cursed.
 Then,  his face brightened up.  He had just envisioned a great plot.  In his 
new game,  the player would have to guard the priceless energy cells of a new 
and  mysterious planet,  somewhere in an obscure corner of  the  Universe.  A 
modern-day version of the good ol' arcade game "Defender". He decided to call 
the planet...er...Kryptium would do nicely.
 He  felt  a definite urge to introduce a gorgeous girl into  the  plot  but, 
remembering all the quarrels he had had with his wife during his married life 
(including the three major ones,  the ones other people refer to as  'kids'), 
he decided not to do so.
 He dialled a number on his phone.
 At the other end,  a click could be heard,  some sighing and groaning  after 
that, and then a tired: "Herbert here..."

 Warchild looked around. Not even the battered remains of the alien spaceship 
were  there  to  be seen.  The mysterious  chap  and,  what  was  worse,  the 
mindstaggeringly exquisite girl had disappeared, too.
 His  presence here was useless,  after all.  He decided to go back and  kick 
some  ass.  His physician first,  for he seemed to have life-sized  daydreams 
recently,  and his analyst next. Last, but surely not least, he would try out 
one of his Kill-O-Gadgets on the guy that sent him here. The Behead-O-Axe? Or 
perhaps his Blood-O-Sucker? He would see.
 Where had all that purple mist gone?
 As he left Kryptium's unhealthy atmosphere,  he casually glanced at his rear 
view  mirror.  He  adjusted  it  so that it no  longer  reflected  the  alien 
spacecraft  that  suddenly  popped up  from  all  directions,  which  started 
destroying  the  planet's production platforms.  Instead he now saw  his  own 
hair. He combed it.
 He smiled to himself.  Er...on second thought,  he'd better hop over to  his 
dentist instead of his analyst. Quite some work to be done there.
 Was it not yet too late to get involved with females?

 Way back in the fourth dimension,  and at a relatively minute distance  east 
of our computer programmer, a computer freak looked outside and noted that it 
had stopped raining. He had almost forgotten all his worries with regard to a 
certain girl as he looked at a small purple spot in the night sky, high above 
him.
 It vanished.
 "I  think I've got a nice plot for my introductory novelette",  he  thought, 
"But let's hope the readers won't find it a bit too complicated..."
 He got up from his chair,  now putting aside all thoughts about the lady  of 
his heart. He turned on his computer system and started typing.
 "The Growing Pains of Cronos Warchild (Part II)" he spoke aloud, as he typed 
the sentence on his keyboard.

                               RICK DANGEROUS
                            by Richard Karsmakers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

           Inspired by the Stavromula Beta thing in Douglas Adams
                    (And with a touch of Terry Pratchett)


 The  jungle  was dense and even slightly foggy.  The cries of  exotic  birds 
littered the brainwaves of Sir Richard 'Rick' Jones.  He wiped some sweat off 
his brow, preventing it from dripping in his eyes and obscuring his sight.
 A rather exotic (though rather precarious) gnat had the somewhat  irritating 
tendency of flying around his head. With a carefully aimed prod of his stick, 
he  ricocheted the little invertebrate into the lurking womb of some kind  of 
carnivore plant.
 "Oh no. Shit." the gnat thought to itself.
 The  plant  didn't take long to react.  It quickly closed its  womb  into  a 
little  prison out of which no living beings smaller than a mouse would  ever 
be able to escape.
 The  unfortunate  gnat made a sound like that of an air  particle  colliding 
with another, and ceased to exist.

 Sir Jones looked around him with a rather pleased look in his eyes.
 Something caught the attention of that rather pleased look.  It was a  small 
plant, struggling to get up through the dense, damp jungle soil.
 "Interesting,"  Sir Jones muttered to himself,  and bent down to examine  it 
more closely.
 As  he did so,  he saw something shining underneath that  particular  little 
plant  that was still,  almost visibly,  struggling to get up and behold  the 
warm rays of the afternoon sun.
 An eager look replaced the pleased one.
 "Oh no. Shit." the little plant thought to itself.
 Guessing  that  there might be some kind of archaeological  treasure  hidden 
under  the  little  greenie,  Sir  Jones tore away  the  little  sapling  and 
uncovered a small thing with some shining parts on it - as well as a piece of 
skin-coloured plastic that seemed to have been shaped like the inner part  of 
an ear.
 A hearing aid.
 The  sprout  made a sound like a drop of water falling  on  an  immeasurably 
large  piece  of desert sand.  After having done that,  it simply  ceased  to 
exist.

 Now what was Sir Jones to do with a hearing aid?
 Nothing, you may think. And that, by some extraordinary coincidence, was Sir 
Jones' thought too.
 So  he  tossed it away with an air of nonchalance,  thereby killing  a  tiny 
little  bug  that was eating off the remains of what used to be a  fresh  and 
young  sapling  struggling to get through the dense and damp jungle  soil  to 
have a look at what the warm sun rays would be like.
 Just before the tiny little bug saw the hearing aid on collision course,  it 
felt a strange kind of nausea.
 "Oh no. Shit." the tiny little bug said to itself.
 The  hearing  aid,  no  bigger than a man's inner  ear,  was  of  formidable 
dimensions in comparison to the tiny little bug.
 It had no chance and died quite instantaneously.
 It didn't even make a sound.

 "HA! There it is!" Sir Jones cried triumphantly.
 He saw the jungle growing less dense before him,  and a large cave could  be 
seen beyond the branches that hung there, partly obscuring it.
 Finally,  he had reached the goal of this journey: The uncharted caves where 
Incas had one day dwelled.  A place,  so he had heard,  of immense wealth and 
immeasurable treasures.  "Stacks and stacks of 'em," his museum director  had 
quoted before he sent Rick off on this archaeological treasure hunt.
 He carefully pushed aside the branches, and brushed the spider webs from his 
forehead (also making sure that the sweat kept on not dripping in his eyes).
 A gasp of breath came from him when he now saw the cave entrance in all  its 
full glory before him. It was several times a high as him, and perhaps just a 
tiny fraction less so in width. Around this arch, there were texts written in 
all  kinds of strange dialects of equally strange and possibly  very  obscure 
tongues.  "Hakkitakkiwegballezakki!" he decyphered aloud, as well as "Wie dit 
leest is gek",  "Scott me up Beamie,  A.L." and "Durex is the best...you know 
what to do with the rest!"
 There was a faint ring in his mind that told him the latter one was  perhaps 
not genuinely authentic.
 Then he saw something that was even more important.
 There  was a door in the arch.  It was made of thick stone and  didn't  look 
like it would open easily.
 "Oh no. Shit." Sir Jones muttered to himself.
 "Hey chap!  That's my line!" a little,  happily flying butterfly said before 
this  momentary distraction caused it to fly equally happily into  that  very 
same, thick, stone door and to cease to exist.

 Sir  Jones  scraped the dead butterfly remains off the  door  and  carefully 
scanned as much of the door as he could, by touching every inch of it, and at 
times knocking and listening to the lack of echo.
 The  sun was already setting,  and Sir Jones realized he had to set up  some 
kind of camp quickly if he didn't get in before soon.
 It was at times like this,  when the melancholy of a setting sun struck  his 
being, that he started wondering about certain things of nature. For example, 
why  the  sun was there during the day and not at night -  during  which  its 
light would certainly have come in handy.
 And that just among many other things.
 He  discarded these thoughts rapidly as he noticed that the door  seemed  to 
open when he touched some kind of oval that was vaguely visible in the door.
 He stepped aside.
 The scent of centuries of death,  damp stone and urine struck him like a ton 
of bricks.
 He staggered for some seconds, then regained his composure and walked in.
 He  did this while carefully prodding with his stick in all  directions.  He 
kept his revolver handy as well - just in case.
 It  was  at the moment that he totally unexpectedly  bumped  into  something 
utterly  huge  when  he remembered that he had forgotten  to  take  with  him 
something like a torch.  So everything was now pitch dark around him -  which 
was  only logical,  for even the Inca torches that hung silently on the  cave 
walls, probably having been left lit many centuries ago, had by now ceased to 
cast off their eerie, dancing light.
 He tore a piece off his trousers, wound it around his stick and lit it.
 The bright light sufficed to show him that he had bumped into a leg.
 A leg of formidable dimensions.
 Attached to the top of that leg was what seemed to be like a giant.  A giant 
of  gigantic  giantish  proportions,  even (quite big as far  as  giants  go, 
actually).
 The  giant looked down at the pathetic little human with a pleased  look  in 
its eyes, and gave forth a wicked laugh.
 "REVENGE." it said.
 Something  inside  Sir Richard 'Rick' Jones made him assume that he  was  in 
some shit of the deepest conceivable kind.
 "FINALLY,  THE TIME HAS ARRIVED." the giant of gigantic giantish proportions 
further proclaimed.
 Yes.  Something now even told Sir Jones that he was absolutely right in  his 
aforementioned assumption.
 "AFTER DEATH UPON DEATH,  I AM NOW DECIDEDLY IN THE DISPOSITION THAT  ALLOWS 
FOR SOME INDUSTRIOUS RETALIATION." the giant related.
 Sir Jones was beginning to wonder about what life after death would be  like 
- and if there indeed *was* any. He also wondered what 'retaliation' was.
 The giant was now obviously all set and prepared to execute the  retaliatory 
actions  it  had announced in one of its earlier statements.  It  lifted  its 
enormous  foot (the one at the lower end of the enormous leg into  which  Sir 
Jones  had  bumped) and carefully aimed at putting it back at  precisely  the 
piece   of   floor  that  was  currently  being  occupied  by   the   zealous 
archaeologist.
 All Sir Jones could do was grab his revolver and aim it at that foot.
 He shot.
 And he shot again.
 There  was  no deafening cry (or not even anything remotely similar)  to  be 
heard, but the foot halted in mid air.
 A chuckle could be heard. Well....it was more like the onset of thunder, but 
relative  to  gigantically  giantish proportions it  was  probably  indeed  a 
chuckle.
 Sir Jones shot again.
 The chuckle (or onset of thunder,  whatever relation you prefer) transferred 
in some laughing quite unheard before by any mortal. It actually sounded like 
a whole host of Thunder God football hooligans were clashing their clouds and 
throwing hammers around.
 "NO. NO. PLEASE DON'T DO THAT. PLEASE DON'T."
 The  giant had difficulty pronouncing the words in between its violent  fits 
of  hard-core laughter.  Obviously,  the bullets were doing something to  its 
foot that caused it to laugh its head right off.
 If it would continue like that, it *would*...

 Just  before a loud 'pop' preceded the falling of a giant rounded object  on 
the floor (causing the giant to cease to exist), it sighed sadly:
 "OH NO. SHIT."
 The  way was now free for Sir Richard "Rick" Jones to proceed deep into  the 
innards  of the temple - his torch shedding light on the dangerous  halls  he 
was about to enter.
 A little exotic (and,  indeed, precarious) gnat flew with him into the dark, 
unknown halls.
 It  had the nasty (and,  indeed,  irritating) tendency of constantly  flying 
around the archaeologist's head.

                               THE WILD LIVER
                             by Bryan Kennerley
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


 It was early morning in the local High Street,  as it was everywhere else in 
the  neighbourhood,  and  the roads were deserted except for the odd  van  or 
truck,  speeding around the empty streets on their way to deliver their loads 
before the emptiness was spoiled by the daily rush of traffic, at what passed 
for a rush hour in this town whose name,  if I told you it, would probably be 
forgotten before this tale is through.
 The story begins with one truck in particular,  not an exceptionally unusual 
truck  but one whose contents were,  comparitively  speaking,  slightly  less 
ordinary.  The  lorry  was,  as  most are,  filthy.  The dirt  of  aeons  had 
apparently gathered on the sides and tail of it in the days that it had  been 
since  the last cleaning,  and primitive life was starting to evolve.  It  is 
doubtful that the truck had any thoughts on the matter, but if it had then it 
would  probably agree whole-heartedly with the legend emblazened on its  tail 
gate  by some youth's wandering fingers,  "Clean me".  The youth in  question 
obviously  had  other  things on his mind when the opportunity  for  wit  had 
glanced its way through his rather tedious life.
 The  vehicle in question was of the refrigerated variety and bore a load  of 
various meats for all the butcher's shops in the area.  It is fortunate  that 
the article in question was unloaded at the first stop,  at least for you the 
reader,  because the whole journey was rather uninteresting and was otherwise 
the  kind of thing that happens every day in unremarkable towns all over  the 
country.  The  axles  groaned as the vehicle mounted the pavement  as  if  to 
announce the fact that the driver was well aware that the town was empty, and 
that  if he had flattened an innocent pedestrian then it was their own  fault 
for  being  up so early anyway.  That's the kind of driver he was and  as  it 
happened that was precisely why he did it.
 The gang of lifters jumped out of the cab,  donning their gloves as they had 
done  so many times before and began the process of moving so  many  hundred-
weight  of meat and offal in as short a time as possible.  This they  managed 
without  any major problems although one of them had somehow managed  to  cut 
his finger whilst carrying a crate of offal. "Strange", he thought because he 
was sure that he was wearing his gloves.....
 The lorry drove on,  leaving the butcher's shop to await the arrival of  the 
shoppers on which its life,  such that it was,  depended.  The sun rose, cars 
came  and  went and slowly people that got up at a sensible hour of  the  day 
began to drift in and out of shops. Those that got up at a less sensible hour 
slowly  staggered  in  and out more than drifted but in  and  out  they  went 
nonetheless.  At  first all seemed well,  the occasional  pork  rib,  chicken 
breast  and  even  some tongue was purveyed  to  customers  with  appropriate 
degrees  of  daring.  But then,  an oldish  lady,  of  indistinguishable  age 
somewhere  between  70 and 103,  pottered into the shop and  asked  for  some 
liver.
 "Certainly madam," said the butcher, "Is this piece big enough?"
 "Yes,  that'll  be fine," came the wavering reply.  The butcher  placed  the 
liver in question onto the scales but when he announced the price to the  old 
lady  she muttered forth,  "Oh dear,  the prices have gone up  again  haven't 
they?"
 "Yes,  I'm afraid so luv,  there's been some trouble with the lorry  drivers 
goin'  on  strike.  Apparently a pedestrian was run over during  one  of  the 
deliveries - of course the union didn't agree with sacking the  driver,  they 
said it wasn't his fault. I'll cut a bit off for yer shall I?"
 "Yes,  if you would," came the innocent reply. The butcher turned around and 
selected  his favourite knife from the rack behind him - is was this kind  of 
thing that made being a butcher worthwhile.  It gleamed an unnatural gleam in 
the  light  from the single "Fly-o-zap" lamp on the wall.  It  was  making  a 
strange buzzing noise that he hadn't heard it make before - he made a  mental 
note to fix it later.  He turned back to the counter but just as he was about 
to  slice through the meat he was mildly surprised to find that it leapt  off 
the  scales and ran off into the corner of the store.  It wasn't  the  actual 
event  that threw him of balance,  more the crushing disappointment  that  he 
wasn't  going  to have to slice through blood red flesh after  all.  He  knew 
instantly that it was going to be one of those days.
 "I bet it's a Wednesday," he said to himself.  As it happened it was in fact 
a Tuesday but it is perhaps comforting to know that when Wednesday did indeed 
arrive  the butcher contracted food poisoning from one of his own meat  pies, 
and as a result was closed down by the Health and Safety department.
 "Well,  how about this piece then luv," he said pointing vaguely to the vast 
array  of liver which he proudly arranged each morning so as to maximise  the 
vagueness of his pointing.

 The  liver  wasn't stupid,  at least it didn't think it  was.  It  had  just 
managed to grasp the principle "I think therefore I am liver" when some great 
creature  had  come  along  with a pointy sharp thing  and  it  had  had  the 
overwhelming  feeling that it did not want to be friends.  So here it was  on 
the floor,  covered in a fine layer of dust. It was quite fond of its colour, 
kind of greyish but with a definate tint of deep red throughout its form.  It 
glanced back up at the wall, for although it had no eyes or other immediately 
obvious sensory apparatus,  no-one had told it so. The blue light of the fly-
o-zap seemed to beckon it somehow and for a moment it became entranced by the 
dull  gleam.  The liver couldn't help feeling somehow attached to the  object 
responsible  for that dull buzz and strange sensation that had made its  body 
tingle  when it had been placed onto the scales.  It was at this moment  that 
the  butcher grew tired of the incessant buzzing behind him and  thumped  the 
thing on the wall.  It flickered for a moment and then went out.  The buzzing 
had stopped and the butcher was satisfied that this act of mindless  violence 
had been a job well done.
 OK,  what next?  The liver wasn't without instinct, after all it had managed 
to  flee the butcher's knife without too much difficulty,  so it  decided  to 
explore.  Moving  was a little difficult,  lacking in the limb department  as 
livers so often are nowadays.  Its movement couldn't be described as  walking 
as such,  but instead it moved in a kind of strained wriggling,  like a  worm 
but with the added ability to raise itself up slightly on what it had decided 
was  its  hindquarters.  It slowly pushed itself along into the back  of  the 
store, leaving a trail of drying blood behind it.
 It was getting pretty confident now and moved with a grace that only a liver 
could  possess.  Outside the liver had its first experience of  sunlight.  It 
vaguely remembered being surrounded by a dull red glow but that now seemed to 
be ages ago,  almost in another life.  The light beamed down into the  alley, 
down  onto the liver's back and seemed to give new energy and vigour  to  the 
organ.  If a liver could dance then that would be a fair description of  what 
it  did  as it travelled down that alley,  indeed it would be  quite  a  good 
description as its movement closely resembled one of the recent dance  trends 
in one particularly tacky night club in the area. Of course the liver did not 
know this and neither did the people who had started this dance trend,  which 
is rather a shame really.
 Suddenly  the  liver heard voices coming from just  around  the  corner.  It 
pricked  up two nodules on its front end which had probably been arteries  in 
its previous existance.  The voices were getting louder which,  it  reasoned, 
meant that they must be getting closer. It decided to play dead.
 A gang of 3 or 4 youths careered down the alley making counting their actual 
number rather difficult.  They had obviously been drinking and moved somewhat 
less graciously than the liver had done.  One of them had an extremely  dirty 
finger.
 "Hey, wassaden!" offered one.
 "Dunno....wasswaden?!" offered another.
 "Datodair, i' looks lika, o i dunno. Hey Gav, wassaden!"
 "It's  a liver isn't it chaps?" replied Gavin,  the intelligent one  of  the 
group which doesn't say much for their collective IQ.
 "Sa  footy  innit?" said the first and kicked it at Gavin.  If  there's  one 
thing  he hated it was a smart-arse.  It missed but Gavin tried to return  it 
and  quite a game started up.  Well,  quite a short game started  up  because 
after  a few kicks up the backside the liver had decided football wasn't  its 
favourite  sport and proceeded to scramble off down the alley as  quickly  as 
its rear haunches could propel it.
 "Hey, wessaballgone?!" - the chase was on.
 It  wasn't a particularly fast chase,  the liver kept its lead ahead of  the 
tailing  bunch,  more  because  of  their falling  over  themselves  and  the 
occasional   molecule  of  air  than  its  outstanding   sprinting   ability. 
Unfortunately the liver hadn't had any experience of finding its way  through 
back alleys and it didn't take long for it to run into a dead end. One of the 
youths  who  clearly  fancied himself as the leader  of  their  clan  stepped 
forward.
 "Yer a norty little footy intcha?!" he mumbled in what obviously passed  for 
his most authoritative voice.  The liver was scared.  It most definately  did 
not like being stuck in a corner and threatened by a mumbling moron. Not many 
people know how dangerous a liver can be when threatened and this goes doubly 
so  for this particular mumbling moron,  so it came as a great surprise  when 
his  "little footy" raised itself onto its hind quarters and leapt  into  the 
air towards him.
 The  pounce  was carefully calculated and aimed and hit home  right  on  the 
youth's throat where the creature stayed, fixed more firmly than by any glue, 
and sucked.  A searing,  agonizing pain burnt through the youth's upper chest 
and neck as the blood was absorbed through the very pores of his  flesh.  For 
the  liver had no teeth to bite through the flesh nor claws to rip  open  the 
veins so all it could do was to suck, more powerful than any leech. Of course 
the  victim screamed to his 'pals' to get the footy off him but by  the  time 
they had realised that it wasn't another drunken game,  thought for a  while, 
gawped  at Gavin after he had calmly informed them that this was  'jolly  odd 
behaviour for a liver', and looked with great curiosity at the strange colour 
that their 'pal' was turning,  it was rather too late for them to do anything 
about it.  He slumped lifeless to the floor, his hands still clutching at his 
throat as a reminder of his last efforts to remove the thing that had drained 
his very life-sap from his body.
 Two  of  the remaining three turned and ran which  given  the  circumstances 
seemed to be the best immediate course of action.  The other youth just stood 
there,  open mouthed at the scene of horror that he had just  witnessed.  His 
friend lay there,  his flesh an unnatural shade of pale several tones lighter 
even  than corpses are usually imagined to be.  The liver was just  finishing 
its meal, draining the last traces of colour from the empty husk lying on the 
floor.  It  was now several times larger than it had been and  had  obviously 
enjoyed the nourishment it had discovered inside its aggressor.  It was aware 
of  being  watched  and slowly turned around to face  the  remaining  stooge. 
Perhaps  it was just his imagination but before he turned and ran  after  his 
friends he could have sworn that the liver snarled at him.
 It was quite pleased with how things had turned out.  Not only had it fought 
off  its attackers but it had also had a pumping hearty meal.  It felt  quite 
strange now,  partly because it was unaccustomed to its new, bloated size but 
also  because  the source of its food had been slightly more  than  a  little 
drunk.  The liver wobbled off into a storage shed it had found to digest  its 
meal  and,  unbeknown to it at the time,  become the first liver to  discover 
what the word 'hangover' meant.

 Several hours passed before the liver became aware of its surroundings  once 
more.  A figure was moving around inside the shed with it.  It backed further 
into the shadows so it could observe the figure unseen.
 The  tramp shuffled around,  looking for a clear spot in which to spend  the 
night.  Having  found what passed for a clear patch he crouched down  into  a 
sitting  position and took yet another swig of whatever was contained in  the 
brown paper bag he held in his left hand. He thought he heard movement in the 
opposite corner of the shed but he had got used to rats in this neighbourhood 
and  anyway,  he  had learnt that they didn't think much  of  his  particular 
flavour.  Unfortunately he hadn't learnt that livers hadn't got such delicate 
palates. The sound of breaking glass rang out as the bag fell to the floor.

 Early the next morning the refuse collectors began their daily rounds.  They 
were  used to unusual trash of all sorts but they were not prepared  for  the 
discovery  of  a  blood-drained corpse lying amongst  the  piles  of  rotting 
vegetable  matter,  empty food packets and assorted dregs so it  wasn't  long 
before the area was sealed off by the police.  Various indeciperable messages 
were  shouted  to  the general public  through  mega-phones  which  obviously 
conveyed  a  sub-conscious message telling everybody to  gather  together  in 
groups and murmur a lot because this is the only noticeable effect that  they 
seemed to have. It wasn't long before the tramp's paled body was also removed 
from  that alley,  covered by a regulation police corpse-covering blanket  of 
course.
 There  was a reporter around the place somewhere but everybody  ignored  him 
and  so will I.  The police officers didn't seem too sure about what  exactly 
they were supposed to be doing so most of their time was spent pretending  to 
talk  into  their  walkie-talkies,  pacing around  authoritatively  and  look 
worried  as  they  had been taught to do in their  training,  and  of  course 
repeatedly  shout  to the crowd to stay back and to move along as  there  was 
nothing  to  see.  Apart from the dozens of police,  the ambulance  (just  in 
case),  the  official  police 'Keep Clear' signs and barriers and  the  liver 
which had grown to the size of a small to medium sized dog and crawled  under 
the chief superintendant's car, this wasn't too far from the truth. Of course 
nobody saw the liver,  at least nobody saw the liver and thought it important 
enough to say anything about.
 This was one seriously hungover liver.  Whilst people are said to have had a 
skin full when they are drunk, it would be an understatement to say that this 
organ had had a liver full. Both its victims had been intoxicated at the time 
it had taken a dislike to them and now it decided it had taken even more of a 
dislike to them.  At least it was quiet where it was now,  no people marching 
around over its head, poking and prodding amongst its makeshift bed for clues 
as  to what had happened the night before this morning after.  All it  wanted 
was to be left alone. Some chance.
 To  say  that the police were bemused would be  the  biggest  understatement 
since someone said that Atilla the Hun had a personality problem.  The  first 
rumour to go around was that the victims had been attacked by some wild  dogs 
but when it was pointed out that the skin had not been broken the theory  had 
changed to them being attacked by wild dogs that had lost all their teeth and 
so had gummed the unfortunates to death.  Funnily enough,  a headline to this 
effect  appeared  on  the  front page of  only  one  newspaper.  The  coroner 
recognised the markings on the bodies as resembling those left by a leech but 
when  asked how big leeches grew in this area of town he merely  gesticulated 
as vaguely as possible.  Surprisingly enough,  'Wanted' posters of a 15  inch 
leech  did not go up in too much of a hurry.  It is doubtful that they  would 
have  helped much recognitively anyway because by now the liver had grown  to 
almost 2 foot in length.

 Later  that day,  when most of the police had left and the Chief  Super  was 
left loitering around looking bemused at the total lack of clues the team had 
collected  for  him from various angles,  the liver was recovering  from  its 
sufferings.  Feeling  a  little peckish it raised its  head  and  immediately 
lowered it again when it came into sudden contact with the hard metal of  the 
car.  Naturally,  it tried to eat it.  Some strange tasting fluid came out of 
the car but the liver felt it was lacking something.
 When  the Chief tried to start his car,  the same thought crossed  his  mind 
too.  He knew nothing about cars but like most people was not willing to  let 
on about this so he got out of the car, raised the bonnet, shook his head and 
let  forth  several  tuts,  tsks and various  unhappy  noises.  He  had  seen 
mechanics do this whenever he had had the car serviced so he thought he  must 
look pretty darn knowledgeable to anyone watching.
 Eventually he tired of this game and it was at this point that he noticed  a 
pool of redness slowing growing out from underneath his car. He was sure that 
petrol wasn't red so he hazarded a careful look and saw a reddish brown  blob 
filling most of the space under the car and moving gently,  as if  breathing. 
Now  he was sure that it wasn't there when he had parked because he was  sure 
that he'd have noticed driving over such a thing.  In no time the area was  a 
hive of activity again but this time one or two of the cops were armed.
 They waited,  and looked at the car as if expecting whatever was  underneath 
it  to  do something.  One thing was for sure and that was that if it  was  a 
toothless  wild dog then it was almost certainly skinless as well judging  by 
the color of...well, 'it'.
 The liver awoke from its post-hangover doze to realise that there were a lot 
of eyes looking at him.  This didn't worry it too much, but what did worry it 
was that the eyes were attached to men holding metallic objects which gave it 
the same feeling of extreme danger as the knife had done the day before.
 The  Chief was getting a little bored with just sitting around  waiting  for 
something  to  happen.  Heck,  that was his car in there and he  hadn't  even 
finished paying for it yet. He barked an order for someone to go and prod the 
thing with a stick or something stick-shaped. After the regulation wise-crack 
had passed through the ranks, a sticks-person was nominated and dispatched by 
a shove in the direction of the car.
 The liver felt something prodding its rear end.  At first it tried to ignore 
it but after a couple more pokes,  it decided it was rather painful and tried 
to  think  of something to do about it.  It gathered its  bulk  together  and 
started to move forwards, away from the source of the discomfort.
 "What is that thing?!" called policeman number one.
 "Beats me," called policeman number two.
 "My car!" called the Chief.
 The car was now travelling along the road,  its wheels raised several inches 
off the ground.  The liver was tiring already with the great load on his back 
so,  much  to the Chief's disappointement it gave a sharp muscular  push  and 
sent the car flying across the street, landing on its roof.
 It  turned  to  face  the shouts that were now  aimed  straight  at  it  and 
discovered that wasn't all that was now aimed straight at it.  It  cautiously 
looked around for a way out of this newest predicament. It seemed that it was 
surrounded but those on its left seemed rather ill at ease. With a grace that 
defied  its  current  size and shape,  it pounced  without  warning  in  that 
direction  and  wiped out 2 officers in one go.  There was no  time  to  feed 
properly, but it had enough time to kill since its power had grown along with 
its size.  The bodies were hardly recognisable as human.  Shots rang out. The 
liver was hit once and then again,  and again.  It reared up in  pain,  blood 
gushing from the wounds torn in its flesh and painting the street with  gore. 
Energized by the pain it bounded into the alley once more.
 The  armed police advanced slowly after it but it was dark in the alley  now 
that  the  sun had passed over behind the buildings on the  west  side.  They 
could  no  longer see their prey.  Flashlights were brought out  and  a  slow 
search  of the alley began but there was no sign of the  liver  anywhere.  At 
least,  no-one reported seeing it but several did,  for an instant at  least. 
The liver had learnt that its pursuers did not look up,  and quickly took  to 
searching the dark corners of the alley so it wasn't too difficult to make  a 
quick kill by hiding above the line of sight.
 But  slowly the liver was moving further and further down the alley  and  it 
soon ran out of places to hide.  The line of guns kept what was thought to be 
a  safe distance away from the organ although no-one had actually  recognised 
that this is what it was.  The flashlights spotted it,  crouched as compactly 
as  its  new  bulk would allow it,  in the same corner it  had  been  trapped 
before.  It  was  a pathetic sight indeed and the order to kill  was  delayed 
while the onlookers tried to ascertain what exactly it was they were  facing. 
The  guns lowered their aim but were immediately instructed to point back  at 
the 'thing' for safety's sake.
 The  liver was more scared than it had ever been in its all-too-short  life. 
It was bleeding heavily,  albeit not its own blood. It was heavily wounded by 
the shots that had been fired and was trapped in a corner once  more,  hardly 
an ideal position for a liver who just wanted to see the world. It heaved its 
bulk forward to stretch out its torn body. Every movement sent a searing pain 
through its entire form but the sensation of danger seemed to fade. A feeling 
of  intense  anger  welled up inside it as it turned once more  to  face  the 
aggressors  before  it.  It  shifted its weight slowly  back  onto  its  rear 
haunches  once  more  - the pain seemed to be fading now  and  a  numb,  warm 
sensation seemed to be spreading. Without any warning, the liver let forth on 
a last desperate bid to escape those who refused to leave it alone.  It leapt 
towards the brightly lit line of people several yards before it.  Shots  rang 
out.  The liver was forced backwards by the impact of the bullets but it  was 
beyond pain now.  As it hit the ground it bounded forward once more,  digging 
deep  into its remaining energy,  but as shots rang out once more  the  liver 
fell in a motionless heap inches from the feet of the marksmen.

 Only theories were ever proposed as to what the creature was,  although many 
of  those who studied the remains had remarked on the uncanny resemblance  to 
an internal organ of some kind,  vastly enlarged, although this was obviously 
impossible.  The  actuality of what it had been had died along with it  since 
no-one  could find any evidence that what was left had ever been  alive.  The 
liver was no more, it had ceased to be.

                                 OBLITERATOR
                            by Richard Karsmakers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

              Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's "Book of Lost Tales"


 Darkness was already spreading across the country when Eriol raised his eyes 
upon a small inn,  still at a couple of minutes' walk distance from  him.  He 
sighed  deeply,  for he had travelled long and his feet were aching - and  so 
was his stomach as he had been eating rather little lately.  Behind the small 
windows  of that shelter for the night he saw the flickering  of  candles.  A 
strange feeling tainted his heart as he slowly came near. He closely examined 
the  fair surroundings of this place;  he saw the high elms and oaks  on  the 
hill  to the west,  and witnessed the sun laying itself to rest behind  these 
immense trees - until dawn,  when it would proudly rise once  more.  Coloured 
orange  and  red as the sun set,  the exterior gave him the impression  of  a 
faerytale. Again he sighed deeply, and went down to the front door.

 He  read the sign hanging outside the doorpost.  'Cottage of Lost  Play'  he 
spoke aloud.  Where had he learned that before?  He was about to knock on the 
heavy  wooden door,  garmented with skillfully manufactured metal  ornaments, 
when  the door opened and the face of an old man - probably the inn-keeper  - 
appeared.  He  looked  old,  though not as old as  Eriol  himself,  his  hair 
correspondingly grey, but his eyes seemed aglow with youth. Eriol looked over 
the man's shoulder and saw various folk sitting around a cosy fire,  laughing 
and chatting merrily.
 The old man said nothing but his eyes smiled. He made way for Eriol to enter 
the  candle-lit room.  When the old man closed the door,  it seemed like  all 
fatigue  dropped off Eriol,  he who was amongst his kindred called the  Tale-
teller of Old.  An inner voice told him this was one of the kindest places he 
had  ever  been to - and this seemed most rightly so.
 His  gaze swept around and carefully noted everything in the room.  The  bar 
seemed  made of the same material as the sturdily built door,  probably  very 
old and inherited from times and places before the history of modern man. The 
people present spoke in different tongues,  yet they all seemed to be able to 
understand  the  otheres perfectly.  Some small tables were  present  on  the 
eastern  wall,  under a window where he saw the two moons of  Mandos  rising, 
star glittering.

 "Sit down,  please," said the old man, "I am Orom, keeper of the 'Cottage if 
Lost  Play' inn." Orom's eyes seemed now not merely to glow with  youth,  but 
with  friendliness also.  He offered Eriol a cup of heavenly scenting  juice, 
which  the  Tale-teller  of Old did not refuse as his  throat  was  very  dry 
indeed.
 Apart from some a vague kind of dizziness after drinking this  fluid,  Eriol 
suddenly  noticed that he could now understand what the other people  present 
were  talking  about.  After  having seen the look  of  surprise  on  Eriol's 
features,  the  inn-keeper  called for a silence.  Everybody looked  at  him, 
instantly keeping silent.
 "This,  my  dear folk," pronounced Orom,  an inexplicable pride warming  his 
voice,  "is Eriol, the Last Tale-teller of Old. Finally, fate has brought him 
here - though probably together with some good luck!" He added this last part 
with a bit of a blasphemous smile, glancing fleetingly at the ceiling.
 Eriol  wasn't concerned about the fact that the old man seemed to  know  him, 
and  was soon talking intensely with the gathered people.  The others  turned 
out  to be Tale-tellers themselves,  gathered from all directions - the  dark 
countries  of  the Swamps of Threat,  the bright lands where the  Empress  of 
Everything  ruled,  hunters  from the Plains of Mysticism and folk  from  the 
ancient tribe now living on the Forgotten Isles over the Great  Waters.  They 
had  all  been directed to Orom's inn as if by a kind  of  mysterious  force. 
Perhaps it was fate.
 Nobody  knew anything about Eriol's past,  nor from the past of anyone  else 
present  for  that matter - except perhaps for vague recollections  of  their 
own.  Orom was the obvious exception. Everybody had known him as long as time 
itself,  he  had always been part of the Cottage and the unique  ambience  it 
harboured.
 "Let  him who came in the latest be the first to speak forth his Tales!"  so 
proclaimed  Orom,  who had now lit a pipe and made himself comfortable  in  a 
lowering of the floor near the hearth. The others quietly sat down near Orom, 
waiting for Eriol to start his tale.
 It went thus.

 "Many years ago,  when the planet was still fair and no Swamps of Threat nor 
any  other dark countries existed (while saying this,  he carefully  observed 
one  of the aforementioned Tale-tellers,  who just sat and  kept  listening), 
mankind  lived  happy and prosperous.  There were no wars to  be  fought,  no 
battles  to be won,  and 'tis now known that people then were foolish  enough 
not  to  bear in mind that but a small interference in the balance  of  power 
would  cause  global  warfare.   However,   nobody  had  expected  that  this 
interference  would come from planets formerly unknown,  even from  creatures 
not earlier seen by man's eyes..."
 He   glanced  around  the  illustrious  group  of  men  listening  to   him, 
occasionally sipping their drinks. They now looked at him with incredulity in 
their deep eyes.  Never before had they heard of life amongst the stars other 
than their own.  Normally, Eriol would not have been listened to any further, 
as there was one unspoken rule between the Tale-tellers of old:  True stories 
only.  But  somehow,  because of reasons seemingly not known to any of  them, 
they kept listening. Eriol's presence and voice filled everybody's minds with 
a  sense  of  truth.  Only  Orom seemed to  know  why,  as  he  smiled  self-
sufficiently, inhaling deeply.
 "It was spring," Eriol continued,  "and the trees were full of boughs  ready 
to show their newly created leaves to the bright light of the sun,  the birds 
sang  songs  of love and mother nature nursed the newly born  with  care  and 
warmth.
 The  whole planet was paradise for the harmless,  the innocent,  the  naive, 
even the powerless. There was no exorbitant richness nor poverty, nor did any 
of the bad virtues of mankind prevail.  Every day, the sun would rise and set 
and  yet another day of joy and merriment would have  passed.  Every  morning 
there  would  be  shady layers of soft mist  and  honeydew  over  heatherclad 
meadows.
 Alas!  This joy was not to be for long,  as a dark shape obscured the sun on 
one of those merry days,  frightening the people and animals dwelling  there. 
As  no harm was forethought by this peaceful people,  it was no  problem  for 
these extraterrestrials to enslave them all,  slaughter their cattle and turn 
the once fair country in a desolate plain where only rough grass would  grwon 
henceforth. Dark clouds gathered above the lands, clouds that would grow more 
immense by the day.  Dark clouds that mankind had not seen since the  Ancient 
Wars of Old.
 It  was  merely  a few days after the brutal and  unprovoked  act  of  alien 
aggression  that  the Federation Council heard of it.  It was them  who  sent 
Drak, the last of the Obliterators, to fight the battle nobody had wanted, to 
claim the victory nobody had sought.  Drak was the sole survivor of an  elite 
team of warriors that had fought many a battle,  and survived.  Drak  carried 
with  him the hopes of all the population with him as he entered the  hostile 
territory, now known as the Lands of Enslavement..."

 Eriol now took a draught of his beer,  and went on: "Drak met no resistance. 
He was disgusted by the foul creatures now living there and didn't even  dare 
to  prey  upon them for fear of being poisoned,  but there were  no  apparent 
invaders in the dark lands anymore.  Nor were there people,  for that matter. 
Drak  felt an evil presence,  however,  and felt worse than he had ever  felt 
before  when fighting for whoever paid the most - like he had done so  often. 
The  black  mists  around  him  seemed to grow  heavier  and  heavier  as  he 
penetrated deep into the Lands of Enslavement.  After many an hour of walking 
he noticed light just ahead of him.  As he came closer,  he clearly  realized 
that what he saw was a tall tree with fresh green leaves, bathing in light of 
the sun that shone from high above.  It was like metal chains falling off his 
heart when he saw this sight of beauty in the middle of darkness.
 But  he had not yet fully entered the circle of light when he felt  a  queer 
sensation  running through his veins.  He felt giddy for a moment,  and  next 
thing  he  knew he was in surroundings completely different from all  he  had 
ever  seen before.  It was more frightening than the submarine empire of  the 
Sorcerer  of  Death,  technically  more highstanding  that  the  dungeons  of 
Zerostein  the Professor of Retrogation and it felt more evil than  the  very 
depths  of Hell!  By a means not known to Drak or to mankind,  his  molecular 
structure had been moved from the planet's surface to the heart of the  Alien 
battleship.  It was as if sorcery and wizardry prevailed here,  and Drak felt 
uncomfortable right into his bones..."
 Eriol again looked around the men that sat listening in silence,  their eyes 
filled with wonder.  He emptied his mug. There was a deafening silence in the 
room. The fire had gone out and the coals were only glowing now. The faces of 
the men looked grim with the dark red glow on their faces,  some covered with 
heavy beards.

 The  hunter from the Plains of Mysticism,  known as Valor the Impetuous  One 
amongst his kin, was the first to break the silence. "What did happen? Was it 
the Gods' will for Drak to survive?  Please do tell more!" While saying this, 
he signalled Orom to fill Eriol's mug to its rim.
 A look of sadness settled itself on Eriol's face.  "The rest of the story is 
too  sad  to tell.  If have not come here to tell tales that will  make  your 
hearts feel weary.  I would rather tell faery tales of happiness but alas!  I 
know them no more."
 After having said that,  Eriol erected himself,  putting down the mug. For a 
moment it looked as if he was going to reveal the end of his tale after  all, 
but he merely sighed from deep within his torso,  turned around and left  the 
'Cottage of Lost Play' inn. The sound of crickets entered the inn for a brief 
moment,  after  which  the door was closed again,  sealing it  off  from  the 
outside world once more.

 The man from the Swamps of Darkness cleared his throat and,  to Orom,  said, 
"Who is this man? Who is Eriol, Tale-teller of Old?"
 Orom remained silent for a while. "Eriol," he added, "is the only descendant 
of the last of the Obliterators. Drak's son."
 The men fell silent.

 Under the light of the two moons of Mandos, both equally pale, Eriol walked, 
sad and lonely.  On his way to the next inn to tell his Tale of old, the tale 
of the destruction of his home planet...earth.

                                 THE PROPHET
                            by Richard Karsmakers

                  Inspired by Queen - "The Prophet's Song"


 When he closed his eyes he saw a moonlit stair.  It just stood there, amidst 
of triviality. It seemed to be the only object of importance, the only object 
his eyes seemed willing to register.
 It stood in a mysterious way,  not supported by anything except nothingness. 
It led up,  up. Far up to beyond his sight. Yet atop the stairs he thought he 
saw light.
 The  sound of wind gathered in his ears - a storm was building up  somewhere 
beyond his vision, beyond the stairs.
 Then,  from  the  light,  a  man descended the  stairs.  When  he  had  come 
sufficiently closer,  it could be seen that he was old,  battered, worn, clad 
in  a tattered robe.  He came down slowly,  as if he had all the time in  the 
world - indeed, as if the very world and all time and space on it were his in 
the first place.
 The young man felt an urge to flee, but a power held him in place - as if in 
a  dream  where  you  want to run but you can't.  Your  feet  move  but  your 
surroundings don't. Nowhere to go to.
 The old man seemed to see him now.  From somewhere,  as if summoned by  him, 
clouds  had  come.  The clouds lingered like fog,  but instead  of  revealing 
everything,  peculiarly enough,  they seemed to bundle the young man's vision 
on the stairs and the old man. It all seemed very unreal.
 The old man's gaze did not leave the other's,  did not waver from its  tired 
concentration  as he went down to the very bottom.  His eyes were  intent  on 
something noone could fathom, strangely unfocused.
 He spread his hands on the multitude,  as if trying to cast a spell of which 
the words were forgotten, the chants no longer remembered.
 The young man felt as if he was falling downward,  a giddy feeling that  was 
completely  out  of place.  Something in the old man's  face  and  expression 
brought him back. He regained his senses.
 Then the old man was suddenly close to him.  The young man had not heard the 
whispered shuffle of the old man's feet on the floor,  nor the soft sounds of 
the flowing of his robes.
 "Beware  the  storm  that gathers here," the old man  said.  His  voice  was 
scarred  by age but the underlying power was enormous.  He seemed like a  man 
void of purpose,  whose love of life and the world had gone stale. A desolate 
man.  The ice cold hearts of bare charity seemed to tear mutely from the tips 
of his fingers. He slowly lowered his hands.
 "I  see no day," he said,  much of the power in his voice suddenly  lacking, 
"so grey is the face of every mortal."
 The  word 'mortal' seemed to echoe through the young man's mind as  the  old 
man  heaved his eyes skyward,  sighing profoundly.  Then the lash of the  old 
man's cold, penetrating glance caught him once more - merciless, compelling.
 "Listen  to the warning," the old man said,  his voice heavy with  doom  and 
some  ancient  sense of regained purpose,  "for soon the cold of  night  will 
fall."
 Only then the young man seemed to become aware of the coldness around  them. 
Only then did the see his own breath form small clouds in front of his face - 
the  old man had none.  The mists had intensified,  and so had the  cold.  He 
looked  around him for something to concentrate on.  Once more he  felt  like 
falling,  flailing down towards the earth,  helpless,  inescapable. The mists 
turned  black,  the  impenetrable black of  death,  doom,  lack  of  purpose, 
desaster, cold night. He shivered.
 The moon had vanished.
 The scenery changed.  It seemed to melt but it was a process unlike  melting 
altogether.  He wavered,  he had difficulty remaining on his feet, had to use 
his arms to keep his balance.
 Then  he stood eye in eye with the bone white haze called  death.  A  scythe 
glimmered unearthly in the darkness. Death's eyes were hollow, like screaming 
mouths to deaf gods.  His teeth seemed to smile,  but it could also have been 
but a grin of anticipation.  Under his bony feet lay a crushed white dove and 
green boughs - freshly cut but dying.  He stretched one bony hand, and at its 
end the young man now saw the vision.  The gaze of death had not been on him, 
but on a dream-like vision of people fleeing,  kings of beasts hurling  agony 
upon mankind,  estranged sons wandering 'round. Wretches running, beyond help 
or hope. A baby, the reaper's hands just releasing the tight, choking grip on 
the little creature's neck that had snapped.  The earth under their very feet 
broke in two.  The dead fell in a chasm unlike any one can  imagine,  beasts, 
kings, mothers, sons. The abyss was bottomless, eager to receive. It showed a 
dow'ry of death,  sadness,  mystery, and more death. There was rain. Not just 
*any*  rain,  but a torrent that seemed alive,  intelligent - a torrent  that 
seemed to be evil incarnated.  Or maybe *good* incarnated in a fight  against 
evil - it was impossible to tell from the vision.
 It was impossibly real, almost as if he was standing there. Life was nothing 
but some abstract thought, death a palpable reality.
 A strange laughter filled his ears,  echoeing, vast, filling his being. Many 
colours seemed to fly by.  Blue, pink, yellow. Then white. Black. The colours 
turned around,  flipped, transformed to beings that seemed human, then melted 
into a bleak lack of features.
 Death.  Running.  Genocide.  The utter purging.  He felt it was a vision  of 
thruth, a glimpse into the future. A vision of death to be, the fires of hell 
taking  mankind.  Mankind  who  heeded him not would be  made  by  all  their 
treasure.  The  bone  white haze would get to those who would  not  mark  his 
words,  the people who would call him mad,  deranged,  taken by lunacy. Those 
who dared laugh at the Madman, those who feared him.
 For one last moment, the old man reappeared in the vision.
 "Listen  to the Madman!" the ragged figure cried,  once again spreading  out 
his hands as if summoning the heavens.  Then everything faded away, the mists 
seemed to conquer the entire image until everything was all but a blur.

 When Noah opened his eyes,  it had started to rain.  The sound was strangely 
comforting to him. His heart felt heavy but he knew what to do. At last.
 He hoped his wife would like the idea.

 Written November 25th 1991 (the day Freddy Mercury died). Not rehashed.

                                 DESCRIPTION


 "Twilight Zone" is an all-format on-line magazine aimed at everybody who  is 
interested in any sort of fiction - although it usually tends to  concentrate 
on fantasy fiction and absurd humour of the respective genres to which J.R.R. 
Tolkien and Douglas Adams belong.
 Its  source  is  an Atari ST disk magazine by the name of  "ST  NEWS"  which 
publishes  computer-related  articles as well  as  fiction.  "Twilight  Zone" 
principally consists of the best fiction featured in "ST NEWS" so  far,  with 
possible additions submitted by dedicated "Twilight Zone" readers.
 "Twilight  Zone"  is limited in size to a maximum of 99,999  bytes  as  some 
email systems simply refuse files of 100,000 bytes and larger.


                                     AIM


 We  have  no particular aim,  but "Twilight Zone" would like to be  a  fresh 
breath to all you people out there that get on-line texts hurled at them that 
seem  only to talk about "Star Trek" and that kind of thing.  We try  not  to 
conform to any preset rules, which might indeed cause some of our stuff to be 
considered   'rude'  or  perhaps  totally  disgusting  (or   worse,   plainly 
uninteresting).


                             SUBMITTING ARTICLES


 "Twilight  Zone"  is  a daughter magazine of "ST  NEWS",  which  means  that 
most  of  the fiction appearing in "Twilight Zone" will have  been  published 
previously  in  "ST  NEWS",  and that submissions to this  magazine  will  be 
published in "ST NEWS" as well.
 If you've written some good fiction and you wouldn't mind it being published 
world-wide,  you can mail it to us either electronically or by standard mail. 
At all times do we reserve the right not to publish submissions. Do note that 
submissions  on disk will have to use the MS-DOS disk format (which  is  also 
compatible with the Atari ST/TT/Falcon) on 3.5" Double Density floppy  disks. 
Provided  sufficient  International  Reply Coupons have  been  supplied  (see 
below),  you will get your disk back with the issue of "Twilight Zone" on  it 
that features your fiction.  Electronic submittees will automatically get  an 
electronic subscription.
 At all times, please submit straight ASCII texts without any special control 
codes whatsoever,  nor right justify! Avoid using characters above ASCII code 
128  because these may vary considerably on different computer  systems.  Use 
*asterisks* to replace italics if needed, please.


                                  COPYRIGHT


 Unless  specified along with the individual stories,  all bits in  "Twilight 
Zone"  are copyrighted by the individual authors but may be spread wholly  or 
separately  to  any  place - and indeed into any other  magazine  -  provided 
credit  is given both to the original author and "Twilight Zone"  and/or  "ST 
NEWS".
 If  you don't follow these rules,  there is nobody who is going to tell  you 
off  or sue you or anything - we only think you're a bit of a tosser  if  you 
don't, and you may expect your name on a black list of sorts!


                           CORRESPONDENCE ADDRESS


 All  correspondence and submissions should be sent to one of  the  following 
addresses.  If you need a reply to a letter,  supply one International  Reply 
Coupon (available at your post office), or two if you live outside Europe. If 
you  want your disk(s) returned,  add 2 International Reply Coupons per  disk 
(and  one  extra if you live outside Europe).  Correspondence  failing  these 
guidelines will be read (and perused) but not replied to.
 The addresses (both valid at least up to summer 1995):

                                SUBSCRIPTIONS


 Subscriptions (only electronic subscriptions available!) can be requested by 
sending  me some email (at the address mentioned above).  For now (and  until 
well  into the forseeable future) "Twilight Zone" will only be  available  in 
ASCII format.
 Subscription  terminations  should also be directed to the  mentioned  email 
address.
 About  one  to two weeks prior to the current issue being sent  out  to  all 
subscribers  you will get a small message to check if your email  address  is 
still valid.  When this message gets bounced more than once your subscription 
automatically expires.


                                 PHILANTROPY


 If you like "Twilight Zone", a spontaneous burst of philantropy aimed at the 
postal  address mentioned above would be very much appreciated!  Please  send 
cash only;  any regular currency will do. Apart from keeping "Twilight  Zone" 
happily afloat, it will also help me to keep my head above water as a student 
of English at Utrecht University.  If donations reach sufficient height  they 
may  secure  the  existence of "Twilight Zone" after  my  studies  have  been 
concluded.
 Thanks!


                                 DISCLAIMER


 The  editor wishes to notify that all authors are responsible for the  views 
they  express,  which  may  not  at all coincide  with  his  own  views.  The 
individual  authors  are  also  the  ones  you  should  sue  when   copyright 
infringements have occurred!


                                   ST NEWS


 In case you have an Atari ST/TT/Falcon,  you would do well to check out  "ST 
NEWS",  the  "Twilight Zone" mother magazine.  The most recent issue  can  be 
obtained  by sending one disk plus two International Reply Coupons (three  if 
you  live outside Europe) to the snailmail correspondence  address  mentioned 
above. "ST NEWS" will *not* be available electronically!
 "ST NEWS" should run on any TOS version, needs a double-sided disk drive and 
prefers one meg - or more - of memory (though half a meg should be  supported 
too).
