        Lenin Mystery:

        One of Moscow's mysteries during the Soviet era was, why the
        caretakers of Linin's tomb - the national monument to the found-
        ing father of communism - closed the monument to the public for 
        months at a time every couple of years.  Now, as the secrets of 
        the old regime continue to ooze out, comes an answer: Lenin's
        body is kept in tip top shape! Every couple years it recieves
        new embalming fluid and a month long chemical bath, that keep
        the body like a fresh corpse, this has been happening since his 
        death in 1924...  what a bunch of fucking wierdos.
