September 1990                                                    

                                                                  
                       POLICE PRACTICES:                                  
     PENNSYLVANIA'S INTERDEPARTMENTAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM           
                                            
                     
     No one can argue the benefits that effective  
communications systems provide to law enforcement.  Even 60 years 
ago, Detroit, Michigan, Police Commissioner Rutledge, while 
addressing the International Association of Chiefs of Police at 
its 1929 convention, noted:  ``Snaring criminals in a radio 
network, woven by broadcasting to radio-equipped cars, has become 
a matter of seconds...With the use of radio communication between 
Headquarters and the patrol cars, we are catching criminals red 
handed...Instead of trailing behind in the dust of the criminal, 
we are as nearly abreast of him as it is humanly possible to 
be.'' (1)                                                            

     Yet, with all the emphasis being placed on electronic 
systems and the technological advancements that have occurred 
since Commissioner Rutledge's speech, the extent of communication 
among law enforcement agencies to share information lags behind 
capabilities.  Unfortunately, jurisdictional boundaries control 
interagency communication and cooperation.                        

     However, this is no longer the case in the State of 
Pennsylvania, which supports a statewide police emergency radio 
frequency.  Using a multi-channel radio programmed with each 
frequency used in a specific location, officers can monitor 
operational radio transmissions and then initiate an immediate 
response, while being able to communicate directly with the 
agency having jurisdictional responsibility for the           
incident.                                                   

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION                               

     To begin, the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) purchased a 
32-128 channel programmable mobile radio with the intent of
expanding its own radio frequency resources.  Then, each
communications specialist within the 15 troop areas statewide
contacted all governmental agencies within their individual
areas to request permission to program the PSP radio with the
frequency of those agencies.  Once an agency granted permission
to use its frequency, the communications specialist advised the
PSP Communications Division of the appropriate frequency
designation, the P.L. squelch code, if any, and a written
authorization of the license holder to allow use of the
frequency.

     PSP communications specialists received an overwhelming 
response to their initial inquiries.  Over 300 police 
organizations within and surrounding Pennsylvania authorized the 
use of more than 500 police frequencies for interdepartmental 
communications.  Even States adjoining Pennsylvania gave 
permission for their statewide emergency frequencies to be 
accessed on the PSP radio system.  L.E.E.R.N. (Law Enforcement 
Emergency Radio Network) of Ohio, S.W.E.N. (Statewide Emergency 
Network) of Delaware, and the New York Felony Channel are now 
available to Pennsylvania State Police troopers working near 
these State borders.                                              

     Obviously, it was not feasible, or necessary, for each troop 
to access all 500 frequencies.  Therefore, commanders of local 
troops relied on their communications specialists to decide what  
frequencies would be included in their radio systems.  The 
frequencies added by individual troops depended on local and/or 
regional needs.  Many troops consolidated all their desired 
channel requests into a single troopwide radio program.  
However, commanders were not restricted in any way concerning 
their ability to communicate with other agencies.  Some troops 
have as many as three different programs established for the 
respective stations that comprise their troop.  In addition, 
along with local law enforcement agencies, some troops 
incorporated the National Weather Service Channel, the frequency 
for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, the 
Pennsylvania Turnpike repeaters frequencies, and the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Resources Forestry repeater channels.  

OPERATION                                                        

     Currently, the Pennsylvania State Police Communications 
Division is responsibile for managing 52 authorized radio 
programs used throughout the Commonwealth by troopers.  No longer 
must troopers wait for information to be relayed through another 
agency's dispatcher to a PSP dispatcher and then to them.  Now, 
they simply monitor the original conversation and converse      
directly with the dispatcher of the agency having jurisdictional 
responsibility.                                                   

     From the first day of operation, the interdepartmental 
communications system has aided in solving crimes, recovering 
property, and saving lives.  For example, PSP troopers working 
the midnight shift in the Harrisburg area monitored the radio 
frequency of a nearby township police department.  After 
obtaining a description of the car and occupants, the troopers 
positioned themselves near a burglary location.  Within 10 
minutes, they stopped the car, held the occupants for the 
responding officers from the township department, and recovered 
$10,000 of stolen property.  All this occurred before the 
township dispatcher contacted the PSP dispatcher by telephone.    

     In another instance, a DuBois trooper monitoring the county 
frequency overheard an ambulance driver enroute to a hospital 
radio discussing traffic congestion.  The trooper conversed 
directly with the ambulance driver to identify the problem, and 
then went to the source of the congestion to clear a path for the 
ambulance.  The patient, who was in critical condition, survived.  

CONCLUSION                                                        

     Communications is the life-blood of organizations, 
especially law enforcement organizations.  Communications binds 
together individual entities within departments so that all 
their activities can be directed toward common departmental 
goals.  This team effort produces organizational unity.           

     Team efforts can be expanded statewide.  With a direct 
interagency radio communications system, all participating 
Pennsylvania law enforcement agencies operate within a team 
concept.  As a result, any barriers that existed between State 
and local law enforcement are coming down.  After many years of 
coexisting, police agencies in Pennsylvania are finally talking.
