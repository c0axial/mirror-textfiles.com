June 1991                                                         

                                                                  
                      POLICE PRACTICES:                                     
                   ALTERNATE FUEL PROGRAM                                

                                                                  
     During the late 1970s, as the price of gasoline escalated
and gas lines formed, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Department
searched for an alternate fuel source to use in the department's
fleet.  Among other considerations, it was important to find a
fuel that was clean burning.  Because each car in the
department's fleet logged over 86,000 miles per year, the cost
of repairs and rebuilding was significant, and officials hoped a
cleaner burning fuel would reduce these costs.

     After considering all the alternatives, department officials 
chose to convert its fleet to liquid propane gas use, because it 
met the following criteria:                                       

     *  It is readily available.                                     

     *  It produces yearly savings on fuel costs.                    

     *  It burns cleaner, causing fewer cases of engine failure
        and need for replacement parts.

     *  It is not affected by fluctuating oil prices or
        worldwide supply.

THE CONVERSION                                                    

     When officials purchase a new car for the departments
fleet, mechanics assigned to the in-house fleet garage remove
the carburetor, the air cleaner, and the fuel pump and fuel
line.  (These parts are placed in storage until the department
is ready to sell the car, at which time the original equipment
is replaced.)   Mechanics then put a new liquid propane gas
carburetor and air cleaning device on the car, as well as a fuel
lock off and converter.  Last, they place a propane gas tank in
the trunk of the car and make all the necessary connections.

     The initial cost to convert a car, using new equipment, is
approximately $1,000, plus the cost of the mechanics labor.
However, since some of the parts, such as the liquid propane gas
tanks (which cost approximately $415) can be transferred to
other cars, the cost of converting any replacement cars is less.

REFUELING                                                         

     Department officials solicit bids each year from the 
distributors of propane gas, and the lowest bid is accepted.
However, any distributor considered must also agree to be on
24-hour call and must agree to provide supply trucks to respond
to department cars that run out of fuel while on patrol during
major catastrophes, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.

     The first vendor to supply the department with propane gas
gave a 20-minute lesson on how to refuel safely, with an
emphasis on how to bleed the valves on the car tanks.  Now,
experienced officers teach this simple technique and safety
procedures to new officers.

     Officers refuel their vehicles at large propane gas storage
tanks that are located at three refueling sites around the
county.  Should officers accidently drive off with the storage
tank hose still connected to their tank, there are automatic
shut-off valves on both the storage tanks and the tanks of the
cars to prevent the escape of gas.

     Refueling department cars that are used on road trips may
present more of a problem because liquid propane gas is not
available at all service stations.  However, recently, officers
drove a department vehicle on a 2,000-mile road trip, and they
experienced no difficulty in finding fuel.  Many service
stations and campgrounds sell liquid propane gas.  There is also
a directory available from the National Liquid Propane Gas
Association that lists, by State, many sources of liquid propane
gas.

RESULTS                                                           

     During the past 11 years, over 200 vehicles used by the 
department have operated on liquid propane gas, including 
unmarked units used by the civil, warrants, and administrative 
sections.  Overall maintenance costs are considerably less than 
they would be if gasoline were used in the units.  The department 
saves approximately $1,000 per year on the fuel costs of each 
vehicle, and the longevity of the engine has been increased.      

     Some departments replace patrol cars at 80,000 miles or 
less, but by using liquid propane gas, which does not leave 
carbon deposits in the engine, most vehicles will not need to be 
replaced until they register approximately 160,000 miles.  In a 
department such as the Sarasota County Sheriffs Department, which 
has a one person, one patrol car concept, converting to an 
alternate fuel has resulted in a great savings.                 

CONCLUSION                                                        

     In this time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs, 
every department should look for cost-saving programs.  For 
departments that have large fleets of department vehicles, using 
an alternate fuel, such as liquid propane gas, may be a viable 
way to save money.  When this reduction in costs is combined with 
the increased engine longevity found in vehicles using liquid 
propane gas, the substantial savings realized may allow 
departments to pursue other important programs they have 
previously been unable to afford.
