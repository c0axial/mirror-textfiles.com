       Latent Shoeprint Analysis

               For decades, latent impressions have provided investigators,
       identification technicians and criminalists invaluable clues to
       establish the identity of individuals. Yet, another type of print
       impressions that could be just as valuable has been overlooked.
       Latent shoe impressions exist in almost all interior crime scenes
       but they are often ignored by investigators or destroyed by initial
       responders before these impressions may be processed.
               Latent shoe impressions are the reproduction of the shoe sole
       or tread through grease, oil or other foreign substance transferred
       to an object it has touched or come into contact with. While these
       prints can not be seen by the naked eye, they may be revealed by
       using standard fingerprint powders. Most casual shoes have rubber
       soles which are a petroleum product that secretes an oil base and
       impressions may revealed using an iodine fuming gun. Although crime
       scene investigators routinely search for visible shoe impressions
       in exterior crime scenes, they often overlook the existence of
       latent shoe impressions.
               Like fingerprints, latent shoe impressions can be used to
       place an individual at a crime scene. Although each shoe
       manufacturer produces hundreds of various styles of footwear with
       the same tread design, these identical prints quickly become unique
       through the owner's use. Wear will vary depending on individual
       walking styles and contact with different surfaces. Any scratch,
       nick, or cut will result in points of comparison, making the shoe
       "one of a kind".
               As previously mentioned, most casual shoes have rubberized
       soles, when exposed to light amounts of moisture, react in a way
       similar to a finger leaving its impression on a surface. Vinyl,
       linoleum, glass, smooth tile and doors, and painted floors provide
       the best surfaces for recovery of latent shoe impressions.
               Many of the same factors that are involved in lifting latent
       finger and palm impressions made by friction skin are to be
       considered in recovering latent shoe impressions i.e, the surface
       must be smooth enough to reveal the characteristics of the soles
       and temperature and weather conditions must be conducive to the
       preservation of the impression. Like latent impressions, latent
       shoe impressions are fragile and can be damaged if further contact
       is made after the print is placed. They can be easily altered or
       destroyed by the first responders and curious bystanders so it is
       very important to carefully secure the crime scene if recovery of
       the impression is to be successful.               Latent shoe impressions have not been widely used on crime
       scene investigations. Although recovery of the impressions depends
       on several unpredictable variables, they may yield valuable
       information and, therefore, should be considered a viable option
       for investigators.

               This author (Mr. Hilderbrand) has verified the finding of Mr.
       Pierce through tests and experiments using various powders,
       chemical enhancement and other techniques including lasers. Using
       these techniques, he has developed and recovered many latent shoe
       sole impressions.

An Alternative Method Of Fixing 
Iodine Developed Latent Prints
                                                                            
       Submitted by Mark Hatcher

               Iodine fuming is a great tool in the development of latent
       prints on porous surfaces. One of its biggest drawbacks, however,
       is that the developed print will fade. There are several
       commercially available products that will allow fixing the
       developed print. An alternate method can be accomplished by using
       a steam iron to fix iodine prints without any of the drawbacks of
       commercial processes. 
       
               After completing the Iodine fuming process, apply a steam iron
       to the fumed print. The print will now be fixed and the color will
       have changed from a yellowish-brown to a bluish-purple. When a
       steam iron, and or, electricity is not available at a crime scene,
       the print can be fixed by immersing the article in water. Steam is
       the preferred method because dipping the article in the water may
       be destructive to ridge detail or other trace evidence. 
       
               There are many advantages in favor of using water (steam) for
       a fixing agent of Iodine fumed prints. These include cost, safety,
       and practicality. Water is inexpensive, readily available and
       posses no threat if inhaled or touched. In addition, fixing an
       iodine print with water limits an item to as few chemicals as
       possible. This will reduce the chances of destroying other types of
       forensic evidence, and fixing the iodine print using a steam iron
       does not preclude the use of ninhydrin or silver nitrate.

                               THE SOAP BOX


       The Arizona Identification Newsletter is under new management!
       After his long term as Editor, Mr. John Jolly has stepped down as
       editor and I have been appointed the editor until the AIC holds
       elections. This newsletter also begins one of the new features of
       the new Newsletter, the Soapbox. As is traditional, everyone is
       invited to get up on the Soapbox and speak their minds. If you have
       an evidence processing problem, an unusual case, someone who needs
       a public pat on the back or any other reason to sound off, this is
       the place. As Editor, I have the honor of inaugurating the column
       with an explanation of proposed editorial policies and submission
       procedures. I hope this will be the last column I need to write:
       the newsletter should be the product of the members and we need
       your contributions to make it work. 
               To make submission as painless as possible, your articles may
       find their way into the newsletter in a variety of ways:
       
               ๘ASCII file on a 5ฌ" MS-DOS compatible diskette. Preformatted
               diskettes will be supplied, on request, for the transfer. If
               your word processor does not save in this format, or you are
               not sure what an ASCII file is, send a copy of the file
               anyway! Don't worry about "special effects" like underlining
               and such; if submitted early enough, you will receive a copy
               of the edited version for approval.
       
               ๘If you have access to a computer with a modem, I will be
               maintaining a part time Electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS)
               for information transfer. Between 2pm and midnight, Tuesday
               through Friday, the BBS may be reached through 971-4677; baud
               rates up to 2400 bps are supported and the standard 8 data
               bits, No Parity and 1 stop bit is used. Through the modem, I
               can accept any ASCII document for inclusion into the
               newsletter. The BBS will also provide E-mail between members
               and other information will be on file for downloading.
       
               ๘Scottsdale PD will accept FAX transmissions of your articles
               if your agency has FAX capabilities. Send your articles
               addressed to Dwane Hilderbrand, Technical Investigations, at
               391-5097.
       
               ๘Typed submissions will always be welcome. Don't be concerned
               with line spacing or margins, but please be sure all technical
               terms are spelled properly.
       
               ๘Hand written articles are acceptable, but please take time to
               make them legible!        
               ๘As a rule, photographs do not reproduce well, but line
               drawings, diagrams and original artwork is welcome.
               Fingerprint patterns should be enlarged 2-3 times normal size
               and Polaroid copies are adequate. If a presentation chart is
               required, submit one Polaroid of the known and a second of the
               unknown; tray to fill the frame as much as possible. If your
               photographs show adequate detail, the reproduction should also
               be adequate. Black and white photographs are preferred in all
               cases.
       
               All of us have a knack for doing something better than anyone
       else. Here's your chance to pass that talent along and tell
       everyone what you do best and how well you do it. We all know
       someone who deserves recognition for doing a terrific job behind
       the scenes, but who somehow never gets recognized; here's a
       platform to recognize them.
               When submitting anything for publication, bear in mind that
       your article needs to be received by the first of the month that
       the newsletter will be published. As editor, I don't like to do too
       much editing: your article may be arranged to fit the space
       provided, but I will try not to change the words you submit.
       Provided you submit your article early enough, I will even send you
       a copy of how the article will appear, prior to publication. We are
       targeting newsletter to be published two weeks after the quarterly
       AIC meetings to try and keep the members as up to date as possible.

               The meeting was called to order by Mr. Zamora Sec-Treas at
       1:00pm and introduced Mr. Wertheim from Tucson DPS who gave an
       excellent presentation on Cult Crimes. For copies of hand-out
       materials, contact Mr. Wertheim at 746-4570. The minutes from the
       previous meeting held on March 23, 1990 were covered.
                                                           Agenda
        1) A.I.C Conference
        2) I.A.I Conference
        3) Recognizing individuals in our field
        4) Mr. Ed Wollert benefit
        5) Northland Pioneer College
       
        1)     Effective March 26, 1990, Mr. Wertheim resigned as chairman of
       the AIC Conference. Mr. Mitch Small volunteered as chairman. Mrs.
       Ann Quigley and Mr. Zamora will assist to coordinate the conference
       in October. They will get back to the membership as soon as
       possible.
       
        2)     The AIC is considering hosting the International Association
       for Identification's Annual Conference. Mrs. Patty Burkeholter from
       the Tucson Convention Bureau has given their full support to assist
       us in making this convention a successful one. It was determined by
       members present that we need to have commitments from not just a
       few members, but from most members. Mr. Wallace will ask Patty to
       give us a presentation on their services. He will try to arrange
       this for our meeting in June. NOTE: as of this newsletter we have
       received word from our members in Tucson and they are not able to
       support this conference.
        
       3)      Recognizing individuals- When I was first trained in this
       field I was told the job has no fame and glory. All we have is the
       satisfaction that we did the very best we could at the crime scene
       and when the comparisons are done. I feel that it is time to
       recognize those in our field that go that extra yard. I propose
       that we develop and form a committee to recognize those
       individuals. I'm open for suggestions in this matter and welcome
       all comments. I will try an put together some type of standards to
       fit our needs and bring these to the membership for approval.
       
        4)     Ed Wollert Benefit- Mr. Zamora is trying to put together a
       carport sale to benefit the Wollert family. This carport sale was
       held at Glenda Hardy's home and was supported primarily by Mesa PD
       members. Mrs. Wollert has sent the AIC a Thank You note in
       appreciation of our efforts.
       
        5) Northland Pioneer College- Mr. Pat Wertheim has agreed to
       coordinate, for the next four years, the "Crime Scene School" held
       at Northland Pioneer College. Mr. Wertheim stated that Mr. Wilson
       and students were very pleased of how this school was presented.
       Our sincere thanks to Mr. Wertheim for a job well done and to all
       those who assisted in this school. Mr. Wertheim is preparing for
       this years school and we ask all departments to again support us
       with this years program. Message: Mr. Clyde Tess would like you to
       notify the nominating committee or Mr. Hilderbrand (391-5278) if
       you are interested in becoming a board member or know of someone
       who would like to. 
               We would like to invite all members to our next meeting in
       June. We encourage anyone who has a topic they would like to
       present to the members to please contact Mr. Hilderbrand at 391-
       5278 Scottsdale Police Department. 
       
               With all business discussed, Mr. Jim Wallace made a motion to
       close the meeting and seconded by Mr. Clyde Tess (4:20 pm)

       10) Rudy Zamora                   Mesa PD
       
       The meeting was called to order at 1:00 pm.
               Rudy Zamora gave a practical demonstration of Crime Scene
       Processing with Red Wop in conjunction with the Luma Light. Len
       Cummings offered a variation to using straight Red Wop powder: mix
       about a tooth pick full of Red Wop with your standard container of
       Magna Powder. Tests conducted using the metal blade of a garden
       shovel showed sufficient fluorescence for detection of
       fingerprints.
               Mr. Zamora also reported that we have 40 paid members and an
       approximate balance of $4525 in the treasury.
               A point of order was raised concerning the need for Election
       of Officers as provided by our Bylaws. A special meeting of the AIC
       has been called for Saturday, July 21, at Mesa Police Department,
       1:00 pm to 4:00 pm for the express purpose of electing new
       officers. For directions and further information, contact Rudy
       Zamora at 644-2341 (Mesa) or Dwane Hilderbrand at 391-5278
       (Scottsdale). 
               It was reported that a Recognition Program is still in the
       research stages and it was pointed out that California and Canada
       have a program of recognizing members of their divisions
       independent of the IAI's program. It was suggested that as part of
       the Recognition Program the AIC could send the honoree to the IAI
       Annual Convention.
               There was a division of opinion between member on having non-
       AIC members teaching at AIC sponsored schools.
       
               New Business Raised
       
               Glenda Hardy proposed publication of the AIC Newsletter every
       other month to insure current topics are covered.
               Anyone interested in running for office at the upcoming
       elections should contact Dwane as soon as possible.
               Robert Tavernaro suggested a letter to be sent to the heads of
       Arizona law enforcement agencies thanking them for supporting the
       AIC will be drafted. It is hoped that this will encourage more
       agencies to allow their people to become involved with the AIC.
               Clyde Tess suggested that instead of the usual weekend
       conference, this years Annual Conference become a one day
       symposium.
               Dwane Hilderbrand asked for the members to put together a
       questionnaire to determine what people expect from the AIC so the
       AIC may better meet the needs of its members.
       
               It was not recorded what time the meeting was adjourned.
