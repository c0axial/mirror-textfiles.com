        'Federal  computer  system' have the meanings  given  in  section 
        20(d) of this Act."; and
             (3) by adding at the end thereof the following new  section: 
             "Sec.  23. This Act may be cited as the National  Bureau  of 
             Standards Act.".
        
        SEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO BROOKS ACT.
             Section  111(d) of the Federal Property  and  Administrative 
        Services  Act  of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 759(d)) is amended to  read  as 
        follows:
             "(d)(1)  The  Secretary of Commerce shall, on the  basis  of 






        standards  and  guidelines developed by the  National  Bureau  of 
        Standards  pursuant to section 20(a) (2) and (3) of the  National 
        Bureau  of  Standards Act, promulgate  standards  and  guidelines 
        pertaining  to  Federal computer systems, making  such  standards 
        compulsory  and  binding  to the extent to  which  the  Secretary 
        determines  necessary to improve the efficiency of  operation  or 
        security  and privacy of Federal computer systems. The  President 
        may  disapprove  or modify such standards and  guidelines  if  he 
        determines  such action to be in the public interest. The  Presi-
        dent's  authority  to  disapprove or modify  such  standards  and 
        guidelines  may not be delegated. Notice of such  disapproval  or 
        modification  shall  be submitted promptly to  the  Committee  on 
        Government  Operations  of the House of Representatives  and  the 
        Committee  on  Governmental Affairs of the Senate  and  shall  be 
        published promptly in the Federal Register. Upon receiving notice 
        of  such disapproval or modification, the Secretary  of  Commerce 
        shall immediately rescind or modify such standards or  guidelines 
        as directed by the President.
             "(2)  The head of a Federal agency may employ standards  for 
        the cost effective security and privacy of sensitive  information 
        in  a Federal computer system within or under the supervision  of 
        that agency that are more stringent than the standards promulgat-
        ed by the Secretary of Commerce, if such standards contain, at  a 
        minimum,  the provisions of those applicable standards made  com-
        pulsory and binding by the Secretary of Commerce.
             "(3)  The standards determined to be compulsory and  binding 
        may  be  waived by the Secretary of Commerce in  writing  upon  a 
        determination  that compliance would adversely affect the  accom-
        plishment  of  the mission of an operator of a  Federal  computer 
        system, or cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator 
        which is not offset by government-wide savings. The Secretary may 
        delegate to the head of one or more Federal agencies authority to 
        waive such standards to the extent to which the Secretary  deter-
        mines  such  action to be necessary and desirable  to  allow  for 
        timely  and effective implementation of Federal computer  systems 
        standards. The head of such agency may redelegate such  authority 
        only to a senior official designated pursuant to section  3506(b) 
        of  title 44, United States Code. Notice of each such waiver  and 
        delegation  shall  be transmitted promptly to  the  Committee  on 
        Government  Operations  of the House of Representatives  and  the 
        Committee  on  Governmental Affairs of the Senate  and  shall  be 
        published promptly in the Federal Register.
             "(4) The Administrator shall revise the Federal  information 
        resources management regulations (41 CFR ch. 201) to be  consist-
        ent  with the standards and guidelines promulgated by the  Secre-
        tary of Commerce under this subsection.
             "(5) As used in this subsection, the terms 'Federal computer 
        system'  and  'operator of a Federal computer  system'  have  the 
        meanings given in section 20(d) of the National Bureau of  Stand-
        ards Act.".

             nation that the alternative training program is at least  as
