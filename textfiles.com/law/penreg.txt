          PENREG is a data base management system designed to
     maintain and manipulate data obtained through the use of a
     Pen register or DNR (dialed number recorder).  Because
     PENREG was developed by law enforcement officials familiar
     with the operation and needs of DNRs and pen registers, PENREG
     can offer a multitude of helpful functions to investigators. 
     One of the more helpful features is the ability to maintain
     MULTIPLE pen registers during a single investigation.  The
     true wealth of this function is described in detail, later in
     this manual.  PENREG also offers multiple listing
     capabilities, easy editing, dBASE file compatibility, and the
     ability to download data directly from supported computerized
     pen registers, thus eliminating the necessity for
     keyboard data entry.  The author is willing to modify the
     software to accept data from most computerized pen registers,
     free of any additional charges.

     There are additional features that are just as valuable and
     all are mentioned in the body of this user's manual.

          PENREG is menu driven, and was designed with the novice
     computer user in mind.  The various functions available to
     the User are broken down and defined in this manual.

                               (PG 3)
     SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     ____________________________________________________________

     A minimum of 512K RAM, dual floppy disk drives (HARD DISK
     RECOMMENDED), an IBM compatible dot matrix, ink jet, or laser
     printer and DOS 3.0 or higher.   The PENREG 3.1 system will
     function on a single disk drive, but the disk space available for
     data is greatly limited, therefore running this system on a single
     drive computer is not recommended.

     INSTALLING PENREG 3.1
     ____________________________________________________________

     Included on your PENREG 3.1 disk, is a file named     
     "INSTALL.BAT".  To install the PENREG system on the target
     disk, simply type  INSTALL [drive: path] where "drive" is
     the letter designation of the disk drive, and "path" is the
     directory or sub-directory name.  You do not need to create
     the sub-directory.  INSTALL will create it for you.  For
     example, if you want to install PENREG 3.1 onto the C:
     drive, in a sub-directory that you want to call PENREG,  you
     would enter; 
     
     INSTALL C: \PENREG.                                         

     Be sure to separate the C: and the \PENREG so the INSTALL
     program will know what to call the sub-directory.  It is
     suggested that you install PENREG into a different directory
     for each case to be worked.  For example, if you are working
     two cases, you might call the first directory CASE1, and the
     second, CASE2.  Therefore, to install PENREG for CASE2, you
     would enter;  INSTALL C: \CASE2

     Be sure to copy the DOS file COMMAND.COM into the PENREG directory,
     or include these files in your PATH (SEE YOUR DOS MANUAL EXPLAINING
     PATH)

     *** Although PENREG 3.1 will work on a floppy based system,
     it is not recommended due to the size of the program files,
     and the reduction in access time.

     In order to copy the PENREG 3.1 disk, it is suggested that
     you use any version of the DOS DISKCOPY command.  Refer to
     your DOS manual for details.

     *** PENREG makes use of an external program to view text files. 
     You can use almost any text viewer or editor.  I have supplied
     BROWSE.COM from PC Magazine (Ziff Davis Publishing Company, a
     SHAREWARE file) for this purpose.  If you would like to replace
     BROWSE with an editor of your choice such as NE.COM (Norton
     Editor), LIST.COM, etc. simply rename your editor to BROWSE.  If
     your editor has an EXE extension, then include .EXE when renaming
     to browse.  If your editor has a COM extension, include .COM when
     renaming to BROWSE.  

          For example, if you have LIST.COM, rename it to BROWSE.COM. 
     If you have an editor called EDIT.EXE, rename it to BROWSE.EXE, and
     remove BROWSE.COM from the directory.  Be sure to include BROWSE in
     the PENREG directory for maximum performance.


                               (PG 4)

     INVOKING THE PROGRAM
     ____________________________________________________________
     To invoke PENREG 3.1 on a HARD DISK, you must first change
     directories so that you are in the directory containing
     PENREG 3.1 and your data.  For example; if your data and
     PENREG 3.1 are in a directory called \PENREG, you would
     enter CD\PENREG.  Once in the proper directory, simply type
     PEN and strike ENTER (or RETURN).  

     Also place COMMAND.COM AND MORE.COM IN THE PATH.


     CREATING A NEW SUBJECT FILE
     ____________________________________________________________

          Before you can add information to a data base, you must
     first create a data base and give it a meaningful name. 
     This data base is referred to as a "Subject File", and
     should be named after the suspect whose line is being
     monitored.  For example, if you are monitoring two suspect's
     telephone lines you would create two separate subject files.

     If the first suspect's name is JONES, and the second suspect
     is named SMITH, you should name the first subject file
     JONES, and the second SMITH.  This method of naming the
     files proves useful when examining the data at a later time.

          To create a new subject file, you would select this option
     from the main menu by selecting "File", then "Create".  Then you
     would see a message similar to the following;

     EXISTING SUBJECT FILES; 
     
     JOHNSON
     THOMPSON

     Enter new subject file name:> ____________

          This message indicates the names of existing subject
     files in the current investigation.  The list is provided to
     avoid creating another file with the same name.  PENREG will not
     overwrite an existing file with the same name.

          Simply enter the name you wish to give the new subject
     file.  If your new file name is less than eight characters in
     length you must then press ENTER or RETURN.  If the name
     is eight characters in length, the name will fill the
     delimited area and the new file name will be entered
     automatically.  If you decide not to create a new subject
     file, simply press ENTER or RETURN (in other words, enter a
     blank file name)  and you will return to the main menu.

          Standard DOS conventions govern the naming of files,
     therefore you may not use embedded blanks, and only certain
     special characters.  Refer to your DOS manual for details. 
     Do not add an extension to the file name since the ".PEN"
     extension is automatically added to make identifiable.

     DELETE / EDIT RECORDS
     ____________________________________________________________

          Select by choosing "Record", then "Edit" from the main menu.

          Once you have chosen the subject file that contains the
     records for deletion or editing, the first 12 records will
     be displayed on the screen.  In addition displayed along the
     very top of the screen will be a status line indicating the
     file in use, the current record number and the total records
     in the subject file.  The following is a description of
     working keys when using this function;
               
     Cursor keys (arrows) ......... move up or down one record 

     PgUp & PgDn keys.............. move up or down 12 records

     DELETE key.................... marks highlighted record
                                    for deletion

     ENTER or RETURN............... allows editing of the
                                    highlighted record

     SPACE BAR .................... allows you to jump to
                                    specific record within a
                                    file, as opposed to paging
                                    through a large file.

     F1  .......................... exits this function and asks
                                    the user if the marked
                                    records are to be removed
                                    from the file.

          When a record is marked for deletion, an asterisk will appear
     beside the record number.  The marked records are not physically
     removed from the file until the F1 key is pressed.  In this case,
     the records marked for deletion will be displayed and the user will
     be asked if he or she wants to delete the listed records.  If the
     user answers "Y"es to the prompt all listed records will be erased
     from the file.  If the user answers "N"o to the prompt all deletion
     marks will be removed and no records erased.
          When the users chooses to EDIT a record, the record
     must be highlighted and the user must strike ENTER or
     RETURN.  This will cause the area at the bottom of the
     screen to display the fields of the highlighted record.  To
     edit these fields simply type over the existing entries. 
     The edit is complete when the user strikes ENTER again, or
     when the last field is filled with characters.

          To return to the menu, strike the F1 key.


                               (PG 6)

     ERASE SUBJECT FILE
     ____________________________________________________________

          Select by choosing "File", then "Erase" from the main menu.

          As with the "Create" function, this selection also
     provides a list of the existing subject files then asks the
     user to enter the name of the subject file to be erased.  If
     there is a need to have the subject file available at a
     later time, it should be copied to a safe area prior to
     using this function to erase it.  When you have decided to
     erase the subject file, simply enter the name as it appears
     in the listing provided.


     ADD RECORDS TO FILE (From the keyboard)
     ____________________________________________________________

          Select by choosing "Record", then "Add" from the main menu.

          This function provides a record entry screen which
     allows the user to enter data obtained from a pen register. 
     The data entry screen offers full editing capabilities until
     the last field is entered.  Thus correcting a miskeyed entry
     is easily accomplished by using the cursor control keys to
     position the cursor at the point where corrections are
     necessary.

          The fields and their descriptions are as follows;

     CALL # ....... This field contains the sequential number of
                    the call monitored and is OPTIONAL.
     DATE ......... The date the phone was lifted OFF HOOK.  This
                    field must be entered in the standard MM/DD/YY
                    format.
     TIME OFF...... The time OFF HOOK should be entered here in
                    this format:  HH:MM:SS.
     TIME ON....... The time ON HOOK should be entered here in
                    the same format as TIME OFF.
     PHONE NUMBER.. The telephone number called is entered in
     this field.  Keep in mind that if you use hyphens or other
     special characters once, you must use them for every entry. 
     It is important to maintain consistency when  entering the
     phone numbers so that when you use the "Search for Common
     Numbers" function, all common numbers will be located.  This
     field is 50 characters in length and should be sufficient
     for international calls and use of long distance services
     such as MCI and US Sprint.

     REMARKS.......This field is provided for any remarks the
     user might add to give a particular call meaning, or to
     indicate whether AUDIO was on or off.  This field is also
     OPTIONAL.

     SUBSCRIBER....This field contains the name of the person
     subscribing to the phone number listed in the record.  The user
     identifies the number, and places the information in the SUBSCRIBER #s
     file, then runs a CROSS CHECK.  The CROSS CHECK will insert the
     subscriber's name into the blank subscriber fields where the phone
     number listed in that record, matches the phone number in the SUBSCRIBER
     file.


                               (PG 7)
         
     (CONTINUED)
          In the case of DATE and REMARKS, the F10 key will produce the
     same value that was entered into the last record, thus eliminating
     key strokes.



     IMPORT FROM V.I. PEN REGISTER

     ____________________________________________________________

          At the present time the only manufacturer of pen
     registers that offers compatibility with this software is
     "Voice Identification".  When selected this function prompts
     the user for the name of the file to be loaded (this will be
     the name of the subject file to receive the data from the
     pen register).  The user should enter the name of the file
     to which the pen register data is to be added.  After the
     file name has been entered, the user is prompted for the
     drive that contains the pen register data, ie.
     (Load_:NOTE.DO).  The user simply enters the letter
     designation of the disk drive (for example, if the data is
     on drive A: the user simply types "A"  without the quotes)
     where the pen register data is located and the computer does
     the rest.  If the filename is not NOTE.DO, and happens to be
     NOTE2.DO, or something similar, you would simply type over the
     existing filename.


     IMPORT FROM ASCII TEXT FILE
     ___________________________________________________________

          Select by choosing "Record", then "Import" from the main menu.

          PENREG 3.1 also allows data to be imported from an
     ASCII text file.  In order for the data to be compatible, it
     must be in the following order, format, and each field must
     be separated by commas.  If a field is left blank, a comma
     must still be present:

     CALL #   DATE   OFF HOOK   PHONE #    ON HOOK
     0001,01-01-1989,00:10:00,17185551212,00:30:00,,,,
      |
     This field is optional, all others must be present.  If Call #
     is omitted, place a comma in it's place as all fields are separated
     by commas.

          There is no need to enter duration time, as PENREG will
     calculate the duration of the call and place the total in a
     separate field.  When you name a text file it must have the
     .TXT extension so that PENREG 3.1 will know it is a TEXT
     file.


                               (PG 8)


     FREQUENCY PRINTOUT
     ____________________________________________________________

          Select by choosing "rePort", then "Frequency" from the main
     menu.

          This function is considered one of the more helpful
     features of PENREG.  When selected, this function offers
     three possible forms of output.  The first report offered is
     a list of ALL calls sorted numerically, and what subject
     files the phone number appears in.  The second report
     offered is a list of all subject files, and what phone
     numbers they dialed (numbers sorted numerically).  The third
     report is a combination of the first two.  This feature can
     be helpful for realizing common numbers, or times of high
     traffic.  All .PEN files are automatically considered by this
     function.


     LIST ENTRIES OF SUBJECT FILES
     ____________________________________________________________

          When the LIST function is selected, you will be presented
     with another menu.  The new menu will list the following
     choices;
                    1) List entire file
                    2) List by date range
                    3) List by day of week/time range
                    4) SUBSCRIBER numbers list

          Option #1 will list the contents of the entire file. 
     Prior to printing the report, you will be asked if you would
     like the report sorted, or as is.  If you have entered all
     calls in chronological order or have used the V.I. pen
     register, then print the report as is.  This saves
     considerable time when printing large files.  If the calls
     were entered out of sequence you should request a sorted
     report.  The sorted report is printed in chronological
     order.

          Option #2 asks for a date range.  This allows you to
     list all calls recorded between two dates.  The dates are
     inclusive of those entered.

          Option #3 has proven to be quite helpful in many
     investigations.  This option allows you to list calls on
     specific days of the week, and during specific hours.  For
     example, suppose you were interested in all calls made or
     received on Saturday mornings between the hours of 0800 and
     1100.  This option allows you to enter those parameters, and
     produce a listing of the calls meeting the parameters
     entered.

          Option #4 will list all SUBSCRIBER numbers in your SUBSCRIBER
     numbers file.


                               (PG 9)


     CALL TOTALS
     __________________________________________________________

          Select "rePorts", then "Call Totals" from the main menu.

          This function will provide the user with a list of the phone
     numbers dialed, and an indication of how many times each number was
     dialed.  Although this function is similar to the FREQUENCY REPORT,
     this one only works with one file chosen by the user.


     # BREAKDOWN
     __________________________________________________________

          Select "rePorts", the "Breakdown" from the main menu.

          Some Pen Registers will produce numerous long distance calls,
     and some calls will be placed through a common carrier such as
     Sprint or MCI and will include quite a few digits.  The BREAKDOWN
     function will produce a list of all numbers dialed, and break each
     number down into area code, exchange, number, and trailing digits. 
     In some cases, the PENREG 3.1 software will alert you that the call
     was placed through one of the common carriers.


     FRAUD ANALYSIS   
     __________________________________________________________

          This function was designed to aid in the investigation
     of telecommunications fraud in which common carriers such as
     MCI, US SPRINT, AMERICALL etc. are victimized.  From this
     function, the user may direct output to screen, printer or
     disk file.  The report generated will show a breakdown of
     calls made to a given carrier's access number, showing the
     billing code dialed, the terminating number dialed, date,
     time, and duration.
          For proper operation, the user must know the dialing
     format used by the carrier.  For example MCI uses a 5 digit
     billing code, does not require a '0' or '1' preceding the
     terminating area code, and requires that the numbers be dialed
     in this format; Access #, Billing Code, Terminating Number. 
     US SPRINT however, uses a 14 digit billing code, requires a
     '0' before the terminating area code, and uses this format;
     Access #, 0 + Terminating Number, Billing Code.
          Only calls made to the access number entered will appear
     on the report.  If there are several ring-over numbers such
     as 861-6440, 6441, 6442, etc. the user should enter only the
     first 6 digits of the access number.


                               (PG 10)


     SEARCH FOR COMMON NUMBERS
     ____________________________________________________________

          Select by choosing "Record", then "Search" from the main menu.

          This is another useful function which allows you to
     enter either a telephone number or a remark, and search for
     a match to the information entered.  When first selected,
     this option will ask if you wish to search the REMARKS field
     or the PHONE field.  The default is "P"hone.  Once you have
     selected the field to be searched, you are presented with a
     delimited field that appears blank.  Simply enter the string
     of characters you wish to find (ie; 5551212 or AUDIO ON,
     etc.) and strike ENTER or RETURN.  Then you must select "E"
     to print only exact matches, or "S" to print string matches.
     A string match will locate data that contains the string of
     characters entered.  For example, if you entered "5551212"
     and selected "S"tring match, you would find "5551212" as
     well as "13015551212".  Likewise for the remarks field.  If
     you entered "ON", and selected "S"tring match, all entries
     containing "ON" in the remarks field would be printed (ie;
     "AUDIO ON", "PHONE", "ONE RING", etc.).  Consequently, you
     can greatly reduce the number of entries printed by being
     more specific when you fill in the delimited blank field.


     SUBSCRIBER NUMBERS
     ________________________________________________________

          Select "Subsc.#s" from the main menu.

          SUBSCRIBER numbers are simply numbers that have already been
     identified as a result of the current, or an associated
     investigation.  By selecting "A" from the main menu, then
     #1, the user can add telephone numbers and subscriber's
     names to the SUBSCRIBER numbers file.  In the case of in-state
     numbers, the long distance prefix should be omitted
     ie;(1301) so that the cross check will provide a match
     whether the caller dialed the area code or not.

          Selection #2 in the SUBSC.#S SUB MENU will perform a
     cross check of any or all subject files.  During the cross
     check, all phone numbers in the subject file that appear in
     the SUBSCRIBER numbers file will be tagged with the subscriber's
     name.  When the "tagging" takes place, the SUBSCRIBER field is
     replaced with the subscriber's name.

          Selection #3 is the EDIT function.  This allows the user to
     locate a phone number in the SUBSCRIBER file, and edit the contents of
     the fields in that record.

          Selection #4 under the LISTS SUB MENU will provide a
     list of all phone numbers in a subject file that have not
     yet been identified.  This is helpful when determining which
     numbers to identify.

     COLOR SELECTION UTILITY 
     ____________________________________________________________

          In cases where the default screen display is
     inadequate, or simply to change the scenery, we have
     provided a color selection utility that allows you to change
     the colors of the displays.  To activate this utility you
     must first be viewing the main menu.  While viewing the main
     menu, strike "U" for Utilities, then select # 1.  This will
     provide you with a list of available colors and their
     associated codes.  Towards the lower portion of the screen,
     you will see the current selections, and below them, sample
     windows of the current displays.  To change colors, enter
     the codes associated with the desired colors.  When you are
     satisfied with the current selections, answer "Y"es to the
     "CORRECT?" prompt, this will save the changes.
