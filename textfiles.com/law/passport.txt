I got a passport as a state Citizen. Here's the way to do it:
a. as stated, show your SS# as all 0's. Where it says "country", enter
your state, e.g., California. Certain words have meanings of commercial
activity now under the redefining of common words by our beloved
leaders,
so cross out these words, and substitute the word that follows;
date of birth -> "nativity"
address -> "location"
For ID, they want SS#s, or military cards, Calif ID, etc. If you have
sent this stuff back, get birth certs, parents birth certs, school
diplomas, marriage certs.  It is good to bring a US citizen with you who
will state he has known you some years.
Use the brown form. Do NOT do as I did, namely mention that you are a
"state Citizen"....they froze up, called the manager, who stormed over
with a guard and asked me to leave!  Maybe they think we're gun toting
revollutionarires.
You will be asked for a zip code onthe form, so put one down, maybe
alter it to read  postal code. Otherwise the process stops there.
Finally, you get a lovely passport with the seals of the states on the
pages, not US eagles.
BTW, ask for a certified copy of your application, and don't forget to
take it. They photocopied one for me , and then kept it. You can always
get a copy from the Dept of State, you must send $10, and notarized
request stating why you want it, when you applied, etc.
You want this as proof that they accepted you with the statement that
your country is California, not DC, or U
USA.  Good Luck.
