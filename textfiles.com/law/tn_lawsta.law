SECTION 39-3-1402. Legislative findings. The general assembly 
finds and declares that:

    (1) Computer-related crime is a potential problem in business 
and government;

    (2) Computer-related crime occurs at great cost to the public 
since losses for each incident of computer crime tend to be far 
greater than the losses associated with each incident of other 
white collar crime;

    (3) The opportunities for computer-related crime in business 
and government through the introduction of fraudulent records into 
a computer system, the unauthorized use of computers,the 
alteration or destruction of computerized information or files, 
and the stealing of financial instruments, data, and other assets 
are great;

    (4) Computer-related crime has a direct affect on state 
commerce;    

    (5) While various forms of computer crime might possibly be 
the subject of criminal charges based on other provisions of 
law, it is appropriate and desirable that a statute be enacted 
which deals directly with computer crime.
