INTRODUCTION

The revolutionary development of modern weapons within a world divided 
by serious ideological differences has produced a crisis in human 
history. In order to overcome the danger of nuclear war now confronting 
mankind, the United States has introduced at the Sixteenth General 
Assembly of the United Nations a Program for General and Complete 
Disarmament in a Peaceful World.

This new program provides for the progressive reduction of the 
war-making capabilities of nations and the simultaneous strengthening of 
international institutions to settle disputes and maintain the peace. It 
sets forth a series of comprehensive measures which can and should be 
taken in order to bring about a world in which there will be freedom 
from war and security for all states. It is based on three principles 
deemed essential to the achievement of practical progress in the 
disarmament field:

First, there must be immediate disarmament action:

A strenuous and uninterrupted effort must be made toward the goal of 
general and complete disarmament; at the same time, it is important that 
specific measures be put into effect as soon as possible.

Second, all disarmament obligations must be subject to effective 
international controls:

The control organization must have the manpower, facilities, and 
effectiveness to assure that limitations or reductions take place as 
agreed.  It must also be able to certify to all states that retained 
forces and armaments do not exceed those permitted at any stage of the 
disarmament process.

Third, adequate peace-keeping machinery must be established:

There is an inseparable relationship between the scaling down of 
national armaments on the one hand and the building up of international 
peace-keeping machinery and institutions on the other. Nations are 
unlikely to shed their means of self-protection in the absence of 
alternative ways to safeguard their legitimate interests. This can only 
be achieved through the progressive strengthening of international 
institutions under the United Nations and by creating a United Nations 
Peace Force to enforce the peace as the disarmament process proceeds.

                          ---------

There follows a summary of the principal provisions of the United States 
Program for General and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World. The 
full text of the program is contained in an appendix to this pamphlet.

                            FREEDOM FROM WAR
 
                     THE UNITED STATES PROGRAM FOR
                      GENERAL AND COMPLETE DISARM-
                       AMENT IN A PEACEFUL WORLD


SUMMARY

DISARMAMENT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES
The over-all goal of the United States is a free, secure, and peaceful 
world of independent states adhering to common standards of justice and 
international conduct and subjecting the use of force to the rule of 
law; a world which has achieved general and complete disarmament under 
effective international control; and a world in which adjustment to 
change takes place in accordance with the principles of the United 
Nations.

In order to make possible the achievement of that goal, the program sets 
forth the following specific objectives toward which nations should 
direct their efforts:

The disbanding of all national armed forces and the prohibition of their 
reestablishment in any form whatsoever other than those required to 
preserve internal order and for contributions to a United Nations Peace 
Force;

The elimination from national arsenals of all armaments, including all 
weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delivery, other than 
those required for a United Nations Peace Force and for maintaining 
internal order;
 
The institution of effective means for the enforcement of international 
agreements, and for the maintenance of peace in accordance with the 
principles of the United Nations;

The establishment and effective operation of an International 
Disarmament Organization within the framework of the United Nations to 
insure compliance at all times with all disarmament obligations.

TASK OF NEGOTIATING STATES

The negotiating states are called upon to develop the program into a 
detailed plan for general and complete disarmament and to continue their 
efforts without interruption until the whole program has been achieved. 
To this end, they are to seek the widest possible area of agreement at 
the earliest possible date. At the same time, and without prejudice to 
progress on the disarmament program, they are to seek agreement on those 
immediate measures that would contribute to the common security of 
nations and that could facilitate and form port of the total program.

GOVERNING PRINCIPLES

The program sets forth a series of general principles to guide the 
negotiating states in their work. These make clear that:

As states relinquish their arms, the United Nations must be 
progressively strengthened in order to improve its capacity to assure 
international security and the peaceful settlement of disputes;

Disarmament must proceed as rapidly as possible, until it is completed, 
in stages containing balanced, phased, and safeguarded measures;

Each measure and stage should be carried out in an agreed period of 
time, with transition from one stage to the next to take place as soon 
as all measures in the preceding stage have been carried out and 
verified and as soon as necessary arrangements for verification of the 
next stage have been made;

Inspection and verification must establish both that nations carry out 
scheduled limitations or reductions and that they do not retain armed 
forces and armaments in excess of those permitted at any stage of the 
disarmament process; and

Disarmament must take place in a manner that will not affect adversely 
the security of any state.

DISARMAMENT STAGES

The program provides for progressive disarmament steps to take place in 
three stages and for the simultaneous strengthening of international 
institution.

                              FIRST STAGE

The first stage contains measures which would significantly reduce the 
capabilities of nations to wage aggressive war. Implementation of this 
stage would mean that:

The nuclear threat would be reduced:

All states would have adhered to a treaty effectively prohibiting the 
testing of nuclear weapons.

The production of fissionable materials for use in weapons would be 
stopped and quantities of such materials from past production would be 
converted to non-weapons uses.

States owning nuclear weapons would not relinquish control of such 
weapons to any nation not owning them and would not transmit to any such 
nation information or material necessary for their manufacture.

States not owning nuclear weapons would not manufacture them or attempt 
to obtain control of such weapons belonging to other states.

A Commission of Experts would be established to report on the 
feasibility and means for the verified reduction and eventual 
elimination of nuclear weapons stockpiles.

Strategic delivery vehicles would be reduced:

Strategic nuclear weapons delivery vehicles of specified categories and 
weapons designed to counter such vehicles would be reduced to agreed 
levels by equitable and balanced steps; their production would be 
discontinued or limited; their testing would be limited or halted.

Arms and armed forces would be reduced:

The armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union would be 
limited to 2.1 million men each (with appropriate levels not exceeding 
that amount for other militarily significant states); levels of 
armaments would be correspondingly reduced and their production would be 
limited.

An Experts Commission would be established to examine and report on the 
feasibility and means of accomplishing verifiable reduction and eventual 
elimination of all chemical, biological and radiological weapons.

Peaceful use of outer space would be promoted:

The placing in orbit or stationing in outer space of weapons of mass 
destruction would be prohibited.

States would give advance notification of space vehicle and military 
launchings.

U.N. peace-keeping powers would be strengthened:

Measures would be taken to develop and strengthen United Nations 
arrangements for arbitration, for the development of international law, 
and for the establishment in Stage II of a permanent U.N. Peace Force.

An International Disarmament Organization would be established for 
effective verification of the disarmament program:

Its functions would be expanded progressively as disarmament proceeds.

It would certify to all states that agreed reductions have taken place 
and that retained forces and armaments do not exceed permitted levels.

It would determine the transition from one stage to the next.

States would be committed to measures to reduce international tension 
and to protect against the chance of war by accident, miscalculation, or 
surprise attack:

States would be committed to refrain from the threat or use of any type 
of armed force contrary to the principles of the U.N. Charter and to 
refrain from indirect aggression and subversion against any country.

A U.N. peace observation group would be available to investigate any 
situation which might constitute a threat to or breach of the peace.

States would be committed to give advance notice of major military 
movements which might cause alarm, observation posts would be 
established to report on concentrations and movements of military forces.

                              SECOND STAGE

The second stage contains a series of measures which would bring within 
sight a world in which there would be freedom from war. Implementation 
of all measures in the second stage would mean:

Further substantial reductions in the armed forces, armaments, and 
military establishments of states, including strategic nuclear weapons 
delivery vehicles and countering weapons;

Further development of methods for the peaceful settlement of disputes 
under the United Nations;

Establishment of a permanent international peace force within the United 
Nations;

Depending on the findings of an Experts Commission, a halt in the 
production of chemical, bacteriological, and radiological weapons and a 
reduction of existing stocks or their conversion to peaceful uses;

On the basis of the findings of an Experts Commission, a reduction of 
stocks of nuclear weapons;

The dismantling or the conversion to peaceful uses of certain military 
bases and facilities wherever located; and

The strengthening and enlargement of the International Disarmament 
Organization to enable it to verify the steps taken in Stage II and to 
determine the transition to Stage III.

                              THIRD STAGE

During the third stage of the program, the states of the world, building 
on the experience and confidence gained in successfully implementing the 
measures of the first two stages, would take final steps toward the goal 
of a world in which:

States would retain only those forces, non-nuclear armaments, and 
establishments required for the purpose of maintaining internal order; 
they would also support and provide agreed manpower for a U.N. Peace 
Force.

The U.N. Peace Force, equipped with agreed types and quantities of 
armaments, would be fully functioning.

The peace keeping capabilities of the United nations would be 
sufficiently strong and the obligations of all states under such 
arrangements sufficiently far-reaching as to assure peace and the just 
settlement of differences in a disarmed world.

international conduct and subjecting the use of force to the rule of 
law; a world where adjustment to change takes place in accordance with 
the principles of the United Nations; a world where there shall be a 
permanent state of general and complete disarmament under effective 
international control and where the resources of nations shall be 
devoted of man's material, cultural, and spiritual advance;

Set forth as the objectives of a program of general and complete 
disarmament in a peaceful world:

arrangements that have been agreed to be necessary for the next stage 
have been instituted.

Agree upon the following outline program for achieving general and 
complete disarmament:

                                STAGE I

A. To Establish an International Disarmament Organization:

(a) An International Disarmament Organization (IDO) shall be established 
within the framework of the United Nations upon entry into force of the 
agreement. Its functions shall be expanded progressively as required for 
the effective verification of the disarmament program.


(b) The IDO shall have: (1) a General Conference of all the parties; (2) 
a Commission consisting of representatives of all the major powers as 
permanent members as permanent members and certain other states on a 
rotating basis; and (3) an Administrator who will administer the 
Organization subject to the direction of the Commission and who will 
have the authority, staff, and finances adequate to assure effective 
impartial implementation of the functions of the Organization.

(c) The IDO shall: (1) ensure compliance with the obligations undertaken 
by verifying the execution of measures agreed upon; (2) assist the 
states in developing the details of agreed further verification and 
disarmament measures; (3) provide for the establishment of such bodies 
as may be necessary for working out the details of further measures 
provided for in the program and for such other expert study groups as 
may be required to give continuous study to the problems of disarmament; 
(4) receive reports on the progress of disarmament and verification 
arrangements and determine the transition from one stage to the next.

B. To Reduce Armed Forces and Armaments:

(a) Force levels shall be limited to 2.1 million each for the U.S. and 
U.S.S.R. and to appropriate levels not exceeding 2.1 million each for 
all other militarily significant states. Reductions to the agreed levels 
will proceed by equitable, proportionate, and verified steps.

(b) Levels of armaments of prescribed types shall be reduced by 
equitable and balanced steps. The reductions shall be accomplished by 
transfers of armaments to depots supervised by the IDO. When, at 
specified periods during the Stage I reduction process, the states party 
to the agreement have agreed that the armaments and armed forces are at 
prescribed levels, the armaments in depots shall be destroyed or 
converted to peaceful uses.

(c) The production of agreed types of armaments shall be limited.

(d) A Chemical, Biological, Radiological (CBR) Experts Commission shall 
be established within the IDO for the purpose of examining and reporting 
on the feasibility and means for accomplishing the verifiable reduction 
and eventual elimination of CBR weapons stockpiles and the halting of 
their production.

C. To Contain and Reduce the Nuclear Threat:

(a) States that have not acceded to a treaty effectively prohibiting the 
testing of nuclear weapons shall do so.

(b) The production of fissionable materials for use in weapons shall be 
stopped.

(c) Upon the cessation of production of fissionable materials for use in 
weapons, agreed initial quantities of fissionable materials from past 
production shall be transferred to non-weapons purposes.

(d) Any fissionable materials transferred between countries for peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy shall be subject to appropriate safeguards to be 
developed in agreement with the IAEA.


(e) States owning nuclear weapons shall not relinquish control of such 
weapons to any nation not owning them and shall not transmit to any such 
nation information or material necessary for their manufacture. States 
not owning nuclear weapons shall not manufacture such weapons, attempt 
to obtain control of such weapons belonging to other states, or seek or 
receive information or materials necessary for their manufacture.

(f) A Nuclear Experts Commission consisting of representatives of the 
nuclear states shall be established within the IDO for the purpose of 
examining and reporting on the feasibility and means for accomplishing 
the verified reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons 
stockpiles.

D. To Reduce Strategic Nuclear Weapons Delivery Vehicles:

(a) Strategic nuclear weapons delivery vehicles in specified categories 
and agreed types of weapons designed to counter such vehicles shall be 
reduced to agreed levels by equitable and balanced steps. The reduction 
shall be accomplished in each step by transfer to depots supervised by 
the IDO of vehicles that are in excess of levels agreed upon for each 
step. At specified periods during the Stage I reduction process, the 
vehicles that have been placed under supervision of the IDO shall be 
destroyed or converted to peaceful uses.

(b) Production of agreed categories of strategic nuclear weapons 
delivery vehicles and agreed types of weapons designed to counter such 
vehicles shall be discontinued or limited.

(c) Testing of agreed categories of strategic nuclear weapons delivery 
vehicles and agreed types of weapons designed to counter such vehicles 
shall be limited or halted.

E. To Promote the Peaceful Use of Outer Space:

(a) The placing into orbit or stationing in outer space of weapons 
capable of producing mass destruction shall be prohibited.

(b) States shall give advance notification to participating states and 
to the IDO of launchings of space vehicles and missiles, together with 
the track of the vehicle.

F. To reduce the Risks of War by Accident, Miscalculation, and Surprise  
   Attack:

(a) States shall give advance notification to the participating states 
and to the IDO of major military movements and maneuvers, on a scale as 
may be agreed, which might give rise to misinterpretation or cause alarm 
and induce countermeasures. The notification shall include the 
geographic areas to be used and the nature, scale and time span of the 
event.

(b) There shall be established observation posts at such locations as 
major ports, railway centers, motor highways, and air bases to report on 
concentrations and movements of military forces.

(c) There shall also be established such additional inspection 
arrangements to reduce the danger of surprise attack as may be agreed.


(d) An international commission shall be established immediately within 
the IDO to examine and make recommendations of the possibility of 
further measures to reduce the risks of nuclear war by accident, 
miscalculation, or failure of communication.

G. To Keep the Peace:

(a) States shall reaffirm their obligations under the U.N. Charter to 
refrain from the threat or use of any type of armed force - including 
nuclear, conventional, or CBR - contrary to the principles of the U.N. 
Charter.

(b) States shall agree to refrain from indirect aggression and 
subversion against any country.

(c) States shall use all appropriate processes for the peaceful 
settlement of disputes and shall seek within the United Nations further 
arrangements for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and 
for the codification and progressive development of international law.

(d) States shall develop arrangements in Stage I for the establishment 
in Stage II of a U.N. Peace Force.

(e) A U.N. peace observation group shall be staffed with a standing 
cadre of observers who could be despatched to investigate any situation 
which might constitute a threat to or breach of the peace.

                               STAGE III

A. International Disarmament Organization:

The powers and responsibilities of the IDO shall be progressively 
enlarged in order to give it the capabilities to verify the measures 
undertaken in Stage II.

B. To Further Reduce Armed Forces and Armaments:

(a) Levels of forces for the U.S., U.S.S.R., and other militarily 
significant states shall be further reduced by substantial amounts to 
agreed levels in equitable and balanced steps.

(b) Levels of armaments of prescribed types shall be further reduced by 
equitable and balanced steps. The reduction shall be accomplished by 
transfers of armaments to depots supervised by the IDO. When, at 
specified periods during the Stage II reduction process, the parties 
have agreed that the armaments and armed forces are at prescribed 
levels, the armaments in depots shall be destroyed or converted to 
peaceful uses.

(c) There shall be further agreed restrictions on the production of 
armaments.

(d) Agreed military bases and facilities wherever they are located shall 
be dismantled or converted to peaceful uses.

(e) Depending upon the findings of the Experts Commission on CBR 
weapons, the production of CBR weapons shall be halted, existing stocks 
progressively reduced, and the resulting excess quantities destroyed or 
converted to peaceful uses.

C. To Further Reduce the Nuclear Threat:

Stocks of nuclear weapons shall be progressively reduced to the minimum 
levels which can be agreed upon as a result of the findings of the 
nuclear Experts Commission; the resulting excess of fissionable material 
shall be transferred to peaceful purposes.

D. To Further Reduce Strategic Nuclear Weapons Delivery Vehicles:

Further reductions in the stocks of strategic nuclear weapons delivery 
vehicles and agreed types of weapons designed to counter such vehicles 
shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure outlined in Stage 
I.

E. To Keep the Peace:

During Stage II, states shall develop further the peace-keeping 
processes of the united Nations, to the end that the United Nations can 
effectively in Stage III deter or suppress any threat or use of force in 
violation of the purposes and principles of the united Nations:

(a) States shall agree upon strengthening the structure, authority, and 
operation of the united Nations so as to assure that the United Nations 
will be able effectively to protect states against threats to or 
breaches of the peace.

(b) The U.N. Peace Force shall be established and progressively 
strengthened.

(c) States shall also agree upon further improvements and developments 
in rules of international conduct and in processes for peaceful 
settlement of disputes and differences.

                               STAGE III

By the time Stage II has been completed, the confidence produced through 
a verified disarmament program, the acceptance of rules of peaceful 
international behavior, and the development of strengthened 
international peace-keeping processes within the framework of the U.N. 
should have reached a point where the states of the world can move 
forward to Stage III. In Stage III progressive controlled disarmament 
and continuously developing principles and procedures of international 
law would proceed to a point where no state would have the military 
power to challenge the progressively strengthened U.N. Peace Force 
(emphasis added) and all international disputes would be settled 
according to the agreed principles of international conduct.


The progressive steps to be taken during the final phase of the 
disarmament program would be directed toward the attainment of a world 
in which:

(a) States would retain only those forces, non-nuclear armaments, and 
establishments required for the purpose of maintaining internal order; 
they would also support and provide agreed manpower for a U.N. Peace 
Force.

(b) The U.N. Peace Force, equipped with agreed types and quantities of 
armaments, would be fully functioning.

(c) The manufacture of armaments would be prohibited except for those of 
agreed types and quantities to be used by the U.N. Peace Force and those 
required to maintain internal order. All other armaments would be 
destroyed or converted to peaceful purposes.

(d) The peace-keeping capabilities of the United Nations would be 
sufficiently strong and the obligations of all states under such 
arrangements sufficiently far-reaching as to assure peace and the just 
settlement of differences in a disarmed world.

                      The end of Publication 7277.

No. 383                                                    April 1991


                        WHOSE SIDE ARE THEY ON?
                                   by
                            John F. McManus


In the interest of peace, many Americans have been persuaded to support 
disarmament programs and to create as a substitute for each nation's 
military a United Nations Peace Force. Most feel certain that their own 
rights and the independence of their nation would in no way be placed in 
jeopardy. But there is a vital question few seem willing or able to ask: 
Who would be left to restrain the all-powerful United Nations?

For his Secretaries of State and Defense, President John F. Kennedy 
selected Dean Rusk and Robert S. McNamara. Each was a member of the New 
York-based Council on Foreign Relations, a private organization formed 
in 1921 for the purpose of bringing about a one-world government.

Only nine months into his administration - on September 25, 1961, to be 
precise - Mr. Kennedy travelled to UN headquarters in New York to 
present a proposal entitled Freedom From War: The United States Program 
For General and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World. The work of 
the Rusk-led State Department, with the willing acquiescence of the 
McNamara-led Defense Department, the proposal was published as 
"Department of State Publication 7277."

In his remarks before the UN, President Kennedy asked for a commitment 
from all nations "not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance 
together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete 
disarmament has been achieved." He did not get any such commitment, yet 
the United States embarked on the Kennedy-launched program.

Freedom From War (or "7277," as it is frequently called) proposes three 
stages of disarmament ending with the transfer of the armed forces of 
our nation to the United Nations. As Senator Joseph Clark of 
Pennsylvania approvingly reminded his colleagues in a Senate speech on 
March 1, 1962, this program is "the fixed, determined and approved 
policy of the government of the United States."

A reading of the document itself confirms that disarmament "would 
proceed to a point  where no state would have the military power to 
challenge the progressively strengthened U.N. Peace Force...." In other 
words, the only significant military power left in the world would be 
the United Nations.


The provisions of the treacherous proposal would actually leave our 
nation defenseless before the UN, and before any other nation that 
didn't similarly disarm. And it would place the UN's superior military 
power in the hands of the UN's Undersecretary for Political and Security 
Council Affairs, the overseer of all UN military activity. This post, by 
virtue of a secret agreement concluded at the founding of the UN (an 
arrangement later confirmed by an astonished former UN Secretary General 
named Trygve Lie), has always been held by a communist. The man who 
holds it today, is Vasiliy S. Safronchuk of the Soviet Union. Unless our 
leaders are stopped, they will succeed in turning over our military 
forces to the United Nations where they will be controlled by a 
communist.

Subverting Our Sovereignty
            
Are our leaders really implementing this plan?  Yes, they are! The 
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is part of it; the treaty banning the use of 
outer space for nuclear weapons is part of it; the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty is part of it; and so is the Intermediate 
Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, signed by President Reagan and Soviet 
leader Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1988.

When Freedom From War was first made public, many startled Americans 
tried to obtain a copy. It was quickly declared "out of print" by 
federal authorities. Then, it was superseded in April 1962 by a "more 
precise" statement of the U.S. disarmament policy in a document entitled 
Blueprint For the Peace Race: Outline of Basic Provisions of a Treaty on 
General and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World.


Presented formally to an 18-nation UN Committee on Disarmament meeting 
in Geneva, the foreword to the Blueprint states that it doesn't cancel 
the plans given in Freedom From War. It merely "elaborates and extends 
the proposals of September 25," the date that Freedom From War was 
unveiled at UN headquarters by President Kennedy. In complete accord 
with Freedom From War, the Blueprint spells out its overall goal in the 
third of its three stages: "The Parties to the Treaty would 
progressively strengthen the United Nations Peace Force established in 
Stage II until it had sufficient armed forces and armaments so that no 
state could challenge it."

When questioned about the commitment of the United States to the 
Blueprint, A. Richard Richstein, General Council of the U.S. Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency, stated in a May 11, 1982 letter that 
"the United States has never formally withdrawn this proposal." In 
January 1991, William Nary, the official; historian of the Arms Control 
and Disarmament Agency, confirmed again that "the proposal has not been 
withdrawn." Mr. Nary also confirmed that "certain features of it have 
been incorporated into subsequent disarmament agreements."

In summary, the plan to disarm the United States in favor of an 
all-powerful United Nations Peace Force is unfolding. It calls for 
relinquishing virtually all of our nation's military forces to a UN 
command whose leader, by agreement between the U.S. and the USSR during 
the founding sessions leading to the creation of the UN, will always be 
a communist. In the end, "no state could challenge" the communist-led 
military power of the United Nations.

This supposed "disarmament" program, therefore, is not as much about 
weapons elimination as it is about weapons distribution and control. If 
the program succeeds, only the UN and those nations skirting UN weapons 
prohibitions will be armed. It is remarkably similar to the drive that 
would outlaw private ownership of firearms. (emphasis added) If that 
drive should ever succeed, only the government and those who are outlaws 
would possess guns. Law-abiding citizens would be at their mercy in the 
latter case; law-abiding nations would be at the mercy of the UN and 
outlaw nations in the other.

Background To This Situation

How did we get into such a situation? Who are the individuals promoting 
such a suicidal proposal? Why is Congress going along instead of 
repudiating this dangerous program? How do we get out of it before it's 
too late?

At the founding of the United Nations in 1945, the delegation from the 
United States included a young State Department official named Alger 
Hiss. Widely acclaimed for both his ability and his enthusiasm for the 
world organization, he rose to become the acting secretary general of 
the founding UN conference. As a member of the steering and executive 
committees of the conference, he played a major role in drafting the UN 
Charter. He also helped to staff the U.S. delegation and was chosen by 
his peers for the prestigious task of personally transporting the 
Charter to the President and to the Senate for ratification.


Alger Hiss, however, was later found to have been a secret communist, 
more loyal to a foreign power than to the nation of his birth. A 1950 
State department document named 15 other key U.S. government officials 
who were responsible for planning the creation of the UN. They, too, 
were subsequently named as secret communists by official agencies.

            ************************************************

Five years after the 1945 founding of the United nations, official 
records released by the State Department# identified the individuals 
listed below as key U.S. contributors to the planning for the world 
organization. Each of the 16 was subsequently identified in sworn 
testimony before U.S. government agencies as a secret communist.

# Postwar Foreign Policy Preparation, 1939-1945, U.S. State Department

            ************************************************

Not only was the U.S. represented by a sizable number of communists, our 
nation's delegation also contained 43 individuals who were then or soon 
would be members of America's leading Establishment organization, the 
privately-run Council on Foreign Relations. Alger Hiss himself was both 
a communist and a CFR member as was another U.S. member of the UN 
planning team, Lauchlin Currie. As communists, and as CFR members, they 
worked diligently to bring the world government into existence, and they 
labored just as hard to have the United States a part of it.

There were, of course, delegations from the USSR and the other founding 
nations. These were made up of communists, socialists, one-worlders, and 
easily manipulated starry-eyed dreamers. All were committed to world 
government at the expense of national sovereignty. All wanted the United 
Nations to be supreme. There was to be no more war as soon as the United 
Nations was given sufficient power, especially unchallenged military 
power, to keep the peace.

For the past 45 years, intense pro-UN propaganda has convinced many 
Americans (and many others as well) that the words "peace" and "United 
Nations" are virtually interchangeable. Anyone who opposes the UN risks 
being labelled a warmonger. Those who support the UN customarily find 
themselves showered with accolades.

Peace is so universally desired that almost anything seems reasonable to 
achieve it. Proposals to empower the UN with the world's dominant 
military capability have received widespread support. At first glance, 
the idea may seem to have some merit. A world police force formed to 
keep the peace. Wouldn't it be wonderful!

Suppose, however, that the unchallengeable power of the United Nations 
fill into the wrong hands? Suppose it ended up at the disposal of Alger 
Hiss and his comrades? Couldn't it be used to impose a tyranny on the 
rest of mankind? Wouldn't any would-be tyrant gravitate to the 
organization?

Even if the UN wire not run by communists, socialists, and one-worlders 
who despise nationhood, wouldn't the awesome power we are talking about 
be sufficient to corrupt anyone? Who would be able to bridle any UN 
leaders who had been given greater power than anyone else on earth?

Don't Discard Americanism

It can't be said too often that America is unique. Our nation began with 
the thunderous assertion in the Declaration of Independence that 
"men...are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." 
According to the founding premise of this nation, rights come from God, 
not from government. And the declaration then declared that governments 
are formed solely "to secure those rights." That's all! Secure God-given 
rights, not provide for wants, redistribute the wealth, or make 
dependent serfs out of the people.

With the marvelous foundation laid in the Declaration, the men who 
formed this unique and wonderful nation the wrote a Constitution whose 
sole purpose was to govern the government, not the people. America was 
expected to be a nation where the government was limited by law and the 
people were limited by freely accepted moral codes such as those found 
in the Ten Commandments.

Nothing like America had ever existed in all history. And did this 
nation prosper! Millions left the old world to come here penniless - not 
to be cared for but to enjoy freedom and opportunity. America became the 
hope of the world - even for these who were not fortunate enough to live 
within our borders.

The United Nations, on the other hand, has no place for God. If rights 
don't come from God, the presumption is that they are granted by 
government. The UN actually fosters such a presumption, as can be 
discovered in its International Covenants on Human Rights.

What must be understood is that a government that presumes to grant 
fundamental rights - which is what the UN does - is a government that 
can suspend them at will. If the "self evident " truths in the 
Declaration of Independence are canceled or forgotten in favor of the 
UN's ways, all rights given us by our Creator will exist only at the 
extremely dubious pleasure of the United Nations.

The reality here is that the UN turns the entire American system on its 
head. To consider submitting our nation to the dictates of the 
anti-American, pro-communist and Godless United Nations is suicidal. 
Yet, this is exactly what our leaders have been working towards for 
several decades. Sad to say, it is perfectly obvious that this is 
precisely what President Bush is talking about when he repeatedly 
expresses his desire to create a "new world order."


Unfortunately, the desire for peace has clouded the vision of many 
otherwise clear-thinking Americans. Many have been persuaded to think 
only of the concept of "peace," but not what kind of peace. No one 
should ever forget that there is the peace of the grave, the peace of 
submission, and the communist peace that consists of no opposition to 
communism. Peace with justice, the goal of anyone possessing good will, 
is as likely under United Nations domination as is the chance that water 
will flow uphill.

Whenever thoughts such as these are brought to the attention of sensible 
Americans, enthusiasm for UN-style peace diminishes rapidly. "Let's keep 
our independence!" is a common response. "Why should we trust others to 
look after our well-being?" is another. But too few are aware of the 
dangers inherent in an all-powerful world government. And too few, 
therefore, have been guarding against transferring U.S. military forces 
and U.S. sovereignty to the United Nations.

The "New World Order"

In an exclusive interview published in the December 31, 1990/January 7, 
1991 issue of U.S. News and World Report, President Bush called for "a 
reinvigorated United Nations" that he hoped would bring about the "new 
world order." What should be reinvigorated instead are the U.S. 
Declaration of Independence and Constitution.

During a January 9, 1991 press conference, Mr. Bush said that the crisis 
in the Middle East "has to do with a new world order [that] is only 
going to be enhanced if this newly activated peacekeeping function of 
the United Nations proves to be effective." Obviously, he considers our 
forces in the Middle East to have been under the UN's peacekeeping 
jurisdiction. And isn't it curious that this supposed "peace" 
organization's authority was used in starting the war in the Middle East?

Then, in his January 19, 1991 speech to the nation, the President again 
touted the "new world order," describing it as "an order in which a 
credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the 
promise and vision of the UN's founders." He didn't remind anyone that 
the UN's founders were communists, socialists, one-worlders, and 
starry-eyed dreamers who would happily tear down the unique foundations 
of the United States and replace them with the UN Charter.

What To Do To Save America

Answers to some of the questions we have already raised, and to others 
that anyone reading this pamphlet must have, begin with an understanding 
of the grip on America held by the Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. 
Bush, a member of the CFR's Board of Directors as recently as 1979, can 
point to more than 350 CFR members currently serving as U.S. Government 
officials. A similar CFR dominance prevailed during the Reagan years and 
in several previous administrations.

Current U.S. Officials holding membership in the CFR include Secretary 
of Defense Cheney, National Security Advisor Scowcroft, Joint Chiefs 
Chairman Powell, CIA Director Webster, and Deputy Secretary of State 
Eagleburger. Don't expect any to block further entanglement of the 
United States in the UN.

There are also 16 U.S. senators and a like number of U.S. 
representatives who hold membership in this organization. Don't expect 
them to protect our nation from UN domination.

Realize too, that practically nationally important organ of the news 
media is led by a CFR member. Any senator or representative who wishes 
to receive favor from the media goes along with subverting America to 
internationalist goals. Any senator or representative who tries to keep 
our nation independent runs the risk of having the media make him seem 
like a lunatic.

The great majority of the American people who value their freedom and 
their nation's independence have to become informed and alarmed about 
the path down which we are being taken. There will be no change without 
a rising tide of indignation. And there will be no rising tide of 
indignation until the frightening details about the ongoing subversion 
of this nation have been placed in the hands of many more Americans.

Happily, there are reliable sources of information both about President 
George Bush's commitment to his "new world order" and about the Council 
on Foreign Relations itself. We highly recommend two books:

1. The Establishment's Man, by James J. Drummey, a tastefully written 
yet devastating expose' of the political career of George Bush;

2. The Shadows of Power, by James Perloff, a history of the Council on 
Foreign Relations taken from its own papers and publications.

The enemy is within the gates of our great land. Those who would deliver 
out nation to a UN-controlled "new world order" have achieved great 
power and influence. Whether they are stopped in time is up to 
individuals who will read a pamphlet like this one, books like those 
recommended above, and a great deal more information that is available 
to anyone. Once informed, an American worthy of the name will work with 
others to throw the rascals out of office, and, in the words of George 
Washington, "put none but Americans" in charge of guarding this nation.
