                     Disorder in the Court!


 
     Most language is spoken language, and most words once
they are uttered, vanish forever into the air.  But such is
not the case with language spoken during courtroom trials,
for there exists an army of court reporters whose job it is
to take down and preserve every statement made during the
proceedings. 

     Court is now in session, and here are my favorite
transcripts, all recorded by America's keepers of the word: 
 


     Q:   What is your brother-in-law's name? 
     A:   Borofkin. 
     Q:   What is his first name? 
     A:   I can't remember. 
     Q:   He's been your brother-in-law for 45 years, and   
          you can't remember his first name? 
     A:   No.  I tell you I'm too excited.  (Rising from the
          witness chair and pointing to Mr. Borofkin).      
          Nathan, for God's sake, tell them your first name!


     Q:   Did you stay all night with this man in New York? 
     A:   I refuse to answer that question. 
     Q:   Did you stay all night with this man in Chicago? 
     A:   I refuse to answer that question. 
     Q:   Did you ever stay all night with this man in      
          Miami? 
     A:   No. 


 
     Q:   James stood back and shot Tommy Lee? 
     A:   Yes. 
     Q:   And then Tommy Lee pulled out his gun and shot    
          James in the fracas? 
     A:   (After a hesitation)  No sir, just above it. 
 


     Q:   Doctor, did you say he was shot in the woods? 
     A:   No, I said he was shot in the lumber region. 

  



 
     Q:   Now, Mrs. Johnson, how was your first marriage 
          terminated? 
     A:   By death. 
     Q:   And, by whose death was it terminated? 
 


     Q:   What is your name? 
     A:   Ernestine Mc Dowell. 
     Q:   What is your marital status? 
     A:   Fair. 


 
     Q:   Are you married? 
     A:   No, I'm divorced. 
     Q:   What did your husband do before you divorced him? 
     A:   A lot of things that I didn't know about. 


 
     Q:   And who is this person you are speaking of? 
     A:   My ex-widow said it. 


 
     Q:   How did you happen to go to Dr. Cheney? 
     A:   Well, a gal down by the road had had several of   
          her children by Dr. Cheney and said he was really 
          good. 


 
     Q:   Do you know how far pregnant you are right now? 
     A:   I will be three months November 8th. 
     Q:   Apparently then, the date of conception was August
          8th?
     A:   Yes. 
     Q:   What were you and your husband doing at that time?

 

     Q:   Mrs. Smith, you do believe that you are          
          emotionally unstable? 
     A:   I used to be. 
     Q:   How many times have you committed suicide? 
     A:   Four times. 



  
     Q:   Did he pick the dog up by the ears? 
     A:   No. 
     Q:   What was he doing with the dog's ears? 
     A:   Picking them up in the air. 
     Q:   Where was the dog at the time? 
     A:   Attached to the ear


 
     Q:   Doctor, how many autopsies have you performed on  
          dead people? 
     A:   All my autopsies have been on dead people. 
 


     Q:   Were you acquainted with the decedent? 
     A:   Yes, sir. 
     Q:   Before or after he died? 


 
     Q:   Officer, what led you to believe the defendant was
          under the influence? 
     A:   Because he was argumentary, and he couldn't      
          pronunciate his words. 
 


     Q:   What happened then? 
     A:   He told me, he says, "I have to kill you because  
          you can identify me." 
     Q:   Did he kill you? 
     A:   No. 


 
     Q:   Mrs. Jones, is your appearance this morning       
          pursuant to a deposition notice which I sent to   
          your attorney? 
     A:   No.  This is how I dress when I go to work. 
 


     Q:   Have you ever been arrested? 
     A:   Yes. 
     Q:   What for? 
     A:   Aggravating a female. 

 
 
     Q:   You say you're innocent, yet five people swore    
          they saw you steal a watch. 
     A:   Your Honor, I can produce 500 people who didn't   
          see me steal it. 

 

     Judge:  Well, gentlemen of the jury, are you           
             unanimous? 
     Foreman:  Yes, your Honor, we're all alike --          
               temporarily insane. 


 
     THE COURT:  Now, as we begin, I must ask you to        
                 banish all present information and         
                 prejudice from  your mind if you have      
                 any. 

 
     Q:   When he went, had you gone and had she, if she    
          wanted  to and were able, for the time being      
          excluding all the restraints on her not to go     
          also, would he have brought you, meaning you and  
          she, with him to the station? 
     A:   MR. BROOKS.  Objection.  That question should be  
          taken out and shot. 
 


     Q:   At the time you first saw Dr. McCarty, had you    
          ever seen him prior to that time? 


 
     JUDGE:  I rarely do so, but for whatever purpose it    
             may serve, I will indicate for the record      
             that I approached this case with a completely  
             open mind.  


     Q:   Did the lady standing the driveway subsequently 
          identify herself to you? 
     A:   Yes, she did. 
     Q:   Who did she say she was? 
     A:   She said she was the owner of the dog's wife. 




     Q:   I understand you're Bernie Davis's mother. 
     A:   Yes. 
     Q:   How long have you known him? 


 
     Q:   Now, I'm going to show you what has been marked as
          State's Exhibit No. 2 and ask if you recognize the
          picture? 
     A:   John Fletecher. 
     Q:   That's you? 
     A:   Yes, sir. 
     Q:   And you were present when the picture was taken,  
          right?


 
     Q:   As a officer of the Dodge City Police Department,
          did you stop an automobile bearing Kansas license
          plates SCR446? 
     A:   Yes, sir.
     Q:   Was the vehicle occupied at the time? 


 
     Q:   Please state the location of your right foot 
          immediately prior to impact. 
     A:   Immediately before the impact, my right foot was 
          located at the immediate end of my right leg. 


 
     Q:   Have you ever beaten your wife? 
     A:   No.  I might slap her around a little, but I never
          beat her.  



     Q:   Just what did you do to prevent the accident? 
     A:   I closed my eyes and screamed as loud as I could. 


 
     Q:   What can you tell us about the truthfulness and 
          veracity of this defendant? 
     A:   Oh, she'll tell you the truth.  She said she was  
          going to kill the son of a gun -- and she did.


 


     Q:   And another reason that you didn't want to go out
          there was because you feared for your life? 
     A:   Yes, I did. 
     Q:   Why? 
     A:   That's a rowdy neighborhood, and there are very,  
          very bad persons that will do bodily harm and     
          seriously kill someone. 
 


     Q:   Where were you on the bike at the time? 
     A:   On the seat. 
     Q:   I meant where is the street.



 
Before we recess, let's listen in on one last exchange
involving a child: 
 


     Q:   And lastly, Gary, all your responses must be oral,
          O.K.? 
     A:   Oral. 
     Q:   How old are you? 
     A:   Oral.
