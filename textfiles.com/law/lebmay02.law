                   G.R.A.M.P.A. COPS

     The School Resource Officer (SRO) Program is a valuable drug 
deterrence and safety program acclaimed by school teachers, 
administrators, school children, and parent associations.  
Unfortunately, limited financial resources in most jurisdictions 
prohibit administrators from staffing these programs adequately.  
Most chiefs and sheriffs feel compelled to assign personnel for 
``street'' patrol rather than for administrative and support 
positions, which are the categories under which most school 
resource officers fall.                                           

     In an effort to expand the services of the School Resource 
Officer Program, yet live within the proposed budgetary 
constraints, the Fort Myers, Florida, Police Department took an 
introspective review of its 10-year program.  It determined that 
the most essential component to the program's success was a 
patient, understanding officer who enjoyed being with children. 
This officer also needed sufficient job knowledge to provide a 
valuable learning experience to children of all ages and had to 
be totally committed to both law enforcement and education.       

     While there were many officers who met the criteria, they 
were already assigned to critical positions within the 
department.  Basically, the most qualified people for the job 
were the least affordable.  This lead the department to turn to a 
readily available external resource, which  resulted in the  
establishment of the  G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop Program.                 

WHO ARE G.R.A.M.P.A. COPS?                                        

     As the name of the program implies, G.R.A.M.P.A. (Getting 
Retirees Actively Motivated to Policing Again) Cops are retired 
law enforcement officers who, for one reason or another, want to 
get involved in policing again.  To tap this valuable resource, 
the department recruited retired police officers to work in 
schools, along with school resource officers, to carry the drug 
prevention message to youths.                                     

     Essentially, police retirees are no different from those who 
retire from the public sector.  Some cherish their free time and 
enjoy their retirement, while others are bored and miss the 
day-to-day camaraderie of their fellow officers.                  

     Under the G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop Program, retired police officers 
are certified as auxiliary officers, trained in the school 
resource function, and assigned to local schools.  The primary 
mission of all G.R.A.M.P.A. Cops is to promote drug abuse 
prevention in all city schools through education and counseling. 
In Fort Myers, G.R.A.M.P.A. Cops deliver educational programs to 
youths through standardized programs that have been  developed  
and approved by the police department.  But, they still can be 
called upon to assist school resource officers in other programs 
like bicycle safety or child molestation prevention.      

RECRUITING
                                                        
     Through contact with the community, the department 
identified nearly 1,000 senior citizens with varying degrees of 
law enforcement experience who lived within the Fort Myers area. 
Some of these law enforcement retirees even organized as a civic 
group so that they could hold monthly meetings to fraternize with 
fellow officers and to reminisce on their law enforcement 
careers.                                                          

     Advertising for applicants for the G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop Program 
through the printed and electronic media was also used to 
attract applicants.  It also provided much-needed recognition to 
the School Resource Officer Program.                        

OFFICER SELECTION CRITERIA                                        

     In order to qualify for the G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop Program, all 
applicants must:                                                  

     *  Have a minimum of 5 years' sworn law enforcement 
        experience  

     *  Be at least 40 years of age at the date of hire              

     *  Be in good physical condition as determined by the 
        departmental physician                                            

     *  Meet the basic requirements for admittance into the 
        Florida Criminal Justice Standards and Training 
        Commission Basic Recruit School for reserve and 
        auxiliary officers                         

     *  Have a Florida driver's license and a good driving record   

     *  Submit letters of recommendation from three superior  
        officers from their former department who have knowledge
        of their work performance and character        

     *  Successfully pass a thorough background investigation, 
        which will include a polygraph                                 
 
     *  Be screened by a police oral board which will be comprised 
        of Fort Myers Police supervisory personnel and school 
        resource officers representing various law enforcement 
        agencies throughout the county.  (Final appointment will 
        be by the chief of police at the recommendations of the 
        public information officer who is the supervisor of the 
        School Resource Officer Program)                           

     *  Submit dual applications to the City of Fort Myers and 
        the Fort Myers Police Department                                      

     *  Realize that they are not subject to civil service 
        protection                                                

TRAINING                                                          

     Because G.R.A.M.P.A. Cops are police retirees, most have a 
minimum of 20 years of law enforcement experience.  Thus, formal 
training is not usually necessary.  However, to ensure the 
continuity and integrity of the program, accepted applicants 
attend a 2-week training session at the police academy.  There, 
they become familiar with the school resource officer function, 
policies of the school board, and current programs.  Two days are 
dedicated to drugs and the prevention of drug abuse, how to 
recognize abusers, and steps to be taken to refer abusers to 
treatment programs.                                               

     During the training, the duties, responsibilities, and 
community role of the reserve officer are outlined, because 
G.R.A.M.P.A. Cops become certified as reserve officers at the end 
of their training.  This makes them eligible to participate in 
ride-along programs and crowd control at parades and sporting 
events.  Also, administrative staff members and supervisors  
lecture on departmental policies, rules, regulations, and general 
and special orders.                                               

     After graduating from the academy, G.R.A.M.P.A. Cops 
accompany experienced school resource officers for 1 week before 
assuming their regular assignments.                       

FINANCIAL BENEFITS                                                

     Aside from the obvious benefit of having experienced and 
qualified retirees interacting positively with the area's youth, 
G.R.A.M.P.A. Cops save the taxpayers money.  In fact, the cost of 
manning the School Resource Officer Program with G.R.A.M.P.A. 
Cops instead of new, inexperienced police officers is half as 
expensive.  (See Table A.)

     But, perhaps the greatest feature of the G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop 
Program is its ``easy financing.''  Not only is this program the 
most cost-effective means of providing children with drug abuse 
prevention counseling, but it is also eligible for funding under 
Florida Statute 932.704.  Under the provisions of this statute, 
any department that has an aggressive policy in terms of seizing 
and selling contraband, vessels, motor vehicles, aircraft, and 
other personal property can finance their G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop 
Program with forfeited funds.                           

CONCLUSION                                                       

     Without a doubt, the Fort Myers Police Department's 
G.R.A.M.P.A. Cop Program has greatly benefited the community.  It 
has enabled experienced, seasoned officers to reenter the 
profession and has decreased operating costs to the department. 
It also allows the department to double the number of active 
school resource officers within its current budget or to 
significantly reduce the personnel costs of its respective SRO 
program.                                                          

     Police departments cannot afford to overlook or misuse 
valuable resources that are readily available to them.  By 
employing retired law enforcement officers as auxiliary officers 
in service functions, a department not only gains a wealth of 
knowledge, ability, and expertise but also dedicated individuals 
who can contribute to the safety and well-being of the community.
