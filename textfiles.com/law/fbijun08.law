     How many times has the lack of funding cut short an 
undercover operation for local law enforcement?  ``Too often'' is 
unfortunately the answer.  Most law enforcement budgets can 
barely pay reactive costs, let alone proactive ones.  However, in 
Weber County, Utah, a funding source has been found that has 
reaped substantial benefits for both the police department and 
the community.  That funding source is B.L.O.C.--Business Leaders 
Against Organized Crime.                                          

     B.L.O.C. is a private corporation formed of businessmen and 
community leaders with the goal of promoting a safer, crime-free 
community.  Organized in June 1987, its original mission was to 
provide additional funding and equipment to assist local law 
enforcement in completing on-going undercover ``sting'' 
operations.  However, B.L.O.C. also offers assistance for 
operations targeted against drug interdictions, property crimes 
and white-collar crimes, as well as for specialized training of 
police officers.                                      

ORGANIZATION                                                      

     Law enforcement professionals defined specific goals, 
policies and procedures when organizing B.L.O.C.  A good 
reputation in the community and a sincere commitment to eliminate 
the criminal elements were essential criteria for a business to 
be admitted into B.L.O.C.  Also, B.L.O.C. was  structured as a 
corporation, with ``articles of incorporation,'' to provide a 
protective shield for the corporation's officers.                 

     The corporation's board of directors consists of a 
president, first vice president, second vice president, and 
corporate accountant, each with respective duties and 
responsibilities.  The current president is a former police 
officer who has an understanding of both law enforcement and 
business community needs.  As direct liaison between the police 
department and the corporate membership, the president receives 
all the basic information regarding each operation (type of 
offense, necessary property or finances to conclude a successful 
operation, possible length of operation, etc.) and then 
approaches the membership for approval to disburse funds or 
equipment.  At no time, however, is any confidential information 
about the operation relayed to the president by the law 
enforcement agency requesting assistance.                         

     The first vice president is usually an elected public 
official.  This person acts as a direct liaison with the 
corporation's accountant and is responsible for the annual audit 
of the program, which reports all findings to the board of  
directors.  The first vice president also cosigns with the  
president and second vice president all disbursements to law 
enforcement for individual operations and projects.               

     The second vice president is generally a private citizen who 
is publicly recognized for community service and civic 
responsibility.  This person maintains membership records, 
enlists new members, and cosigns all payouts to law enforcement.  

     The corporation's accountant is an accredited CPA with over 
10 years of major account experience.  The accountant maintains 
records of all financial transactions and completes all the 
necessary tax forms.                                              

     From the beginning, B.L.O.C. was incorporated as a nonprofit 
organization, which allowed member businesses to deduct their 
donations, thereby adding a degree of credibility to the 
organization.  The local IRS service center furnished the 
required forms and guidelines to make application for the tax 
exempt status.  However, some jurisdictions could employ a local 
attorney with the necessary expertise or a district attorney with 
extensive civil law experience to process the tax-exempt 
application.                                                      

FINANCING                                                        

     Money to fund the operation is collected through yearly 
dues, approximately $100 per year, although some of the larger 
businesses voluntarily contribute larger amounts.  By keeping the 
annual fee to a minimum, busineses are more willing to join in 
the effort.  The funds are invested in high-yield interest 
accounts, and the interest is used to finance projects or as 
``buy'' money.  The initial investment is kept intact to provide 
for a continuous source of funding; only the interest is spent.  
If the interest is expended, the corporation requests additional 
funds from the membership, as needed.                             

     Of course, there is always the possibility the program will 
be dissolved.  If this does occur, the remaining finances will be 
used to purchase equipment for area law enforcement agencies.     

     One major concern for potential members was the issue of 
liability to officers or members of the corporation.  However, 
members are assured that because they have no control over how a 
police operation is conducted, they have no responsibility, and 
this is conveyed to both the police and the corporation's 
membership.                                              

OPERATIONS
                                                        
     Affording contributors an opportunity to designate how  
funds are used is one of B.L.O.C.'s major strengths.  However, 
most donations are pooled and spent at the discretion of the 
board of directors.  Members are advised that the monies are 
directly used to fight organized criminal activities (but not for 
officers' salaries) or to provide specialized training to law 
enforcement personnel.                                            

     To request assistance, the commanding officer of an 
undercover operation contacts the president.  In the majority of 
cases, the request is usually for extra finances.  But requests 
have also been made for equipment, vehicles, safe house 
locations, or other services that the corporation's membership 
can provide.  There is no limit to the amount or types of lawful 
donations that the membership can provide.                        

     Another important facet of B.L.O.C. is the recognition given 
to local law enforcement officers at an annual banquet for 
exceptional deeds and accomplishments.  Many city, county, State, 
and Federal officials attend the awards banquet to honor officers 
for their outstanding work.  The extensive media coverage 
provided these events also garners community support for 
B.L.O.C. and law enforcement.                                     

ACCOMPLISHMENTS                                        

     B.L.O.C. is paying big dividends for law enforcement and the 
community.  Because of B.L.O.C., many undercover operations that 
would have ceased have been allowed to continue, thereby 
permitting major organized crime figures to be identified and 
charged.  Over the past 2 years, B.L.O.C. assisted Weber County 
police agencies with undercover operations resulting in over 80 
felony arrests, the recovery of over $80,000 in property, and 
seizures of over $100,000 worth of illegal drugs.  In Weber 
County, B.L.O.C. demonstrates that law enforcement and the 
private sector can work together to combat the criminal elements 
that plague their community.
