July 1990                                                         
 
                                                                  
                       POLICE PRACTICES:
                        BOMB DOG TEAMS 
                        
                                                                  
     There are times when police departments may require the 
services of an explosives detection dog team.  When such an 
emergency occurs, the U.S. Air Force Security Police can respond 
to such requests with military dog teams.  However, there is one 
condition that accompanies each response--the Air Force cannot 
be held liable for any damages or consequences arising from the 
search.                                                           

     Most Air Force security police squadrons have bomb dog 
teams, which consist of an experienced handler, a highly trained 
explosives detection dog, and a spotter who assists the handler 
and acts as backup.  Each team is proficient in detecting 
several common types of explosives and can provide detection 
capability for bomb threats, suspicious packages, airport 
security breaches, and terrorist incidents.                   

Team Response                                                     

     During the past 2 years, explosives detection dog teams from 
the 63d Security Police Squadron (63d SPS) at Norton Air Force 
Base in California assisted Federal and local authorities in over 
20 incidents.  The teams responded to bomb threats at local 
government buildings and shopping centers and cleared VIP 
platforms and routes for such dignitaries as former President 
Reagan, the Duchess of York, and the President of Colombia.       

     After receiving a call for assistance from the California 
Highway Patrol, an explosives detection dog team searched a 
vehicle used by an arrested grenade-tossing driver who terrorized 
several miles of California freeway.  In another incident, a 63d 
SPS team conducted a baggage and commercial airliner search when 
notified by airport police that the carrier received several bomb 
threats on an inbound aircraft.                                  

To Request Assistance                                             

     Civilian police agencies should coordinate requests for 
assistance with local Air Force Security Police.  The law 
enforcement desk sergeant is the designated point of contact for 
bomb dog requests.  The sergeant, in turn, obtains permission 
from the chief of security police and the base commander to 
dispatch the dog team off base.  The base commander is advised of 
the nature of the request and any impact it would have on base 
operations.  Unless the team is conducting a search on base, or 
there is an impending military mission, the request is honored 
within a matter of minutes.  Military necessity governs the 
priority of the dispatch.                                         

     For example, on February 19, 1990, the 63d SPS received a 
request for assistance from the San Bernandino Sheriff's Office.  
There was the possibility that three explosive devices had been 
planted in the county courthouse.  Within 3 minutes, the law 
enforcement desk officer received permission to dispatch the 
team.  Thirteen minutes later, the team was on its way to the 
courthouse.  With this particular incident, a team was on duty 
and available for immediate dispatch.  When a team is off duty, 
the handler maintains contact with the law enforcement desk 
officer by informing the desk officer of location and telephone 
number at all times.  This is to ensure the handler is in 
constant contact with the law enforcement desk in the event of an 
emergency.  When off duty, team response time is less than 1 
hour.                                                             

On the Scene                                                      

     Once the team arrives on site, it reports directly to the 
commanding law enforcement officer for a final situation report.  
The handler then briefs the commanding officer on the search 
pattern, the method to be used for alerting and marking the 
device, and any other information that may be pertinent to the 
search.  If the dog alerts to an explosive device, the handler 
marks the area or item where the explosive device can be found.  
The explosives detection dog team does not deactivate the 
device.  That responsibility rests with law enforcement bomb 
disposal experts.  The length of the search, which may take up to 
several hours, depends on the area or the item being searched.  
After completing a search, or in the event an explosive device is 
located, the handler then debriefs  the on-scene law enforcement  
commander.                                                    

Conclusion                                                        

     Air Force explosives detection dog teams constitute a 
valuable resource that is available to law enforcement agencies.  
Use of this service can counter potentially dangerous situations 
that threaten the safety and well-being of citizens in any 
community.
