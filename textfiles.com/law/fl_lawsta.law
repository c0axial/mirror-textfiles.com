declares that:

    (1) Computer-related crime is a growing problem in government 
as well as in the private sector.

    (2) Computer-related crime occurs at great cost to the public 
since losses for each incident of computer crime tend to be far 
greater than the losses associated with each incident of other 
white collar crime.

financial institutions, government programs, government records 
and other business enterprises through the introduction of

information or files, and the stealing of financial instruments, 
data, and other assets are great.

    (4)  While various forms of computer crime might possibly be 
the subject of criminal charges based on other provisions of 
law, it is appropriate and desirable that a supplemental and 
additional statute be provided which proscribes various forms of 
computer abuse.
