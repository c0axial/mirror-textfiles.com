     Substance abuse among police officers is not new.  Alcohol 
abuse has long been recognized as a problem in police work.  In 
fact, a study conducted in 1984 by the National Institute of 
Occupational Safety and Health revealed that 23 percent of 
officer respondents had serious drinking problems. (1)               

     Intensifying this problem is the increased use of illegal
drugs by police officers.  In recent years, drug abuse in law
enforcement has garnered a great deal of attention. (2)
Numerous individual cases of police officers using or dealing
drugs have received nationwide publicity, and police officers in
various ranks and assignments have been involved.  However, one
area of substance abuse that has been ignored, for the most
part, is police officer use of steroids.

     Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious
problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the
country.  The adverse health conditions, both physical and
psychological, that such abuse carries need to be dealt with in
an informed manner.  Because steroid use was originally tied to
athletics and fitness conditioning, the abuse of these drugs can
be overlooked by the law enforcement profession, which has
always maintained physical fitness as a top priority.  By
becoming educated about the consequences of steroid abuse,
police managers should be better able to prevent the damage
steroids can inflict on their officers.

BACKGROUND

     The use of anabolic steroids by amateur and professional
athletes to increase performance is well-documented. (3)  But,
when it was determined that more than one-half of the track and
field competitors used steroids to prepare for the 1972 Olympic
Games, the International Olympic Committee took steps to ban the
use of anabolic drugs in Olympic competition. (4) Now, the top
six performers in each Olympic event are tested for
non-therapeutic drugs of all types.  However, despite such
developments, steroid use by athletes at all levels is still
widespread.

     Unfortunately, it is becoming more apparent that the law
enforcement community is not exempt from this form of drug
abuse.  For example, in 1989, while the U.S. Bureau of Customs
was investigating the smuggling of anabolic steroids into this
country, their investigation led to certain health clubs in
North Carolina, where  State patrol officers were illegally
using anabolic steroids. (5)  The North Carolina State Patrol
joined the investigation, and subsequently three troopers were
terminated.

     In another case, a physical training sergeant in the Miami
Beach, Florida, Police Department noticed that one of his
charges was "bulking up" too fast.  This female officer also
displayed street behavior that led a department supervisor to
recommend that she be assigned to administrative duties at the
station.  It was subsequently established that she had been
using anabolic steroids.  And, in New York, officers have been
convicted of selling anabolic steroids. (6)

PHYSICAL HEALTH RISKS                                             

     While there are recognized medical uses of anabolic
steroids that are appropriate only under qualified medical
supervision, the abuse of anabolic steroids impacts adversely on
an individual's health.  These risks are even greater when
anabolic steroids are taken under the direction of non-health
professionals or when individuals begin self-dosing.  This is
because the typical usage under these and related circumstances
is 10 to 100 times greater than a proper medical dosage. (7)

     Steroids manufactured outside the United States pose even
greater risks.  Not only are these preparations illegal, but it
is difficult to estimate their dosage equivalency. (8)
Conditions like this virtually ensure dosages will be well
beyond those recognized as medically appropriate.

PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS                                             

     Unknown, or less well-known, to anabolic steroid abusers
are certain detrimental emotional and psychological symptoms.
Indeed, it is maintained that "aggressive behavior is almost
universal among anabolic steroid users." (9)  There are
documented case histories of severe depression, visual and
auditory hallucinations, sleep disorders, thoughts of suicide,
outbursts of anger, anorexia, psychomotor retardation, and
irritability.  (10)

     There have also been significant instances of unusual
and/or violent police behavior associated with anabolic steroid
use, which have the potential to cause serious public relations
and other problems for police administrators.  For example, the
CBS news program "60 Minutes" aired a segment detailing episodes
of police violent behavior and abuse of citizens that were
attributed to steroid use.  The segment highlighted a particular
incident where an off-duty police officer got into an argument
with a female employee at a business establishment and later
returned to abduct her.  He subsequently shot her and threw her
from his vehicle.  The investigation that followed revealed no
propensities toward this type of behavior.  However, the officer
had been using anabolic steroids, and his testosterone level was
50 times higher than normal. (11)

DEPENDENCE ON STEROIDS                                            

     Although steroids are not physically addicting, abusers can
develop a psychological dependence on the drug.  After initial
success with the drug, subjects become psychologically dependent
on their improved physique, increased strength, or sexual appeal
and continue to use steroids. Exercise becomes easier with
steroids, and pain or a lack of strength develops when the drugs
are not used.  This process may continue until the subject is
faced with some difficulty as a result of the drug dependency.
Cessation of usage will come only when the subject becomes
disinterested or is confronted with the various problems
stemming from abuse of the drug.

THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT                                             

     As the harmful physical and psychological effects of
steroid abuse became known, there emerged a need for legal
regulation of the drugs.  It is the responsibility of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) to enforce the Controlled
Substances Act (CSA), which is intended to minimize the quantity
of drugs available for illegal use.  The CSA places substances
into one of five schedules based on such factors as potential
for abuse and whether there is a recognized medical use of the
substance.  Historically, most over-the-counter (OTC) and
prescription drugs, including anabolic steroids, have not fallen
within one of the CSA schedules, and responsibility for
enforcement efforts relating to them has rested with the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and State agencies.

     The FDA determines whether a substance falls within the OTC
or prescription category; each State then has the legal power to
determine who can legally prescribe and dispense OTC and
prescription substances.  Signed into law on November 18, 1988,
the Federal Anti-Drug Act of 1988--also referred to as the
Omnibus Drug Abuse Initiative--placed a special category of
anabolic steroids within the prescription class, and all
violations involving the sale or possession with intent to
distribute anabolic steroids became felonies. (12)

     However, even before the passage of the Anti-Drug Act, it
was illegal to possess anabolic steroids without a prescription
in all 50 States. (13)  Thus, any officer in this country using
anabolic steroids without a prescription has committed an
illegal act. (14)  By November 1, 1989, at least 28 bills
focusing on anabolic steroids had been introduced in State
legislatures. (15) In general, these proposed laws would make
prosecution of anabolic steroid-related crimes easier and would
call for more severe penalties.

     More recently, Congress passed the Anabolic Steroids
Control Act of 1990. (16)  This act, which placed anabolic
steroids into the CSA's Schedule III, gave enforcement power to
DEA and created stiffer penalties.  For example, simple illegal
possession of anabolic steroids without any Federal or State
drug conviction is punishable by 1 year in prison and/or a fine
of $1,000 to $5,000.  If there is an existing drug conviction,
illegal possession will result in not less than 15 days and no
more than 2 years and/or a fine of no less than $2,500, but not
to exceed $10,000.

ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNS

     As health, behavioral, and other problems have been linked
to steroid abuse, police departments have been faced with a need
for awareness, education, and departmental policies concerning
steroid use among their officers.  In the fall of 1989, during
personal interviews of administrators at 30 police departments
across the country, concerns about steroid abuse were expressed.
Members of internal affairs and public information offices were
interviewed, as were staff psychologists and command position
officers.

     Initially, with few exceptions, the responses were that
steroid abuse had never been a problem in the department.  Yet,
those who claimed that anabolic steroid use in the department
was not a problem often later admitted that some officers had
become muscular very quickly.  The interviews revealed that
steroid use was indeed overlooked and that the abuse of these
drugs was beginning to manifest itself.

     Unfortunately, police administrators are not yet fully
aware of the seriousness of steroid abuse and often fail to
recognize this problem among their officers.  Current
information about police officer use of anabolic steroids is
fragmented and impressionistic.

     In addition, general drug tests do not detect the presence
of anabolic steroids; a separate test is required.  This,
combined with the difficulties in implementing drug testing
programs and the costs involved, make it questionable as to the
extent of organizational attention that will be given to police
officer use of steroids in the near future.

RESPONSE TO ANABOLIC STEROIDS                                     

     Though departments may find steroid abuse issues difficult
to deal with now, they must become aware that developments in
the legal environment (17) signal strong social apprehension
about the use of anabolic steroids.  Administrators should share
this concern, given the consequences that may result from police
anabolic steroid abuse.  Increased citizen complaints against
officers, unprovoked off-and on-duty violence, a negative impact
on abusers bodies, increased damage to police-community
relations, officer involvement in illegal activity, civil
litigation, and adverse media coverage are problems that may
likely arise from officer abuse of steroids.

     The first step toward confronting steroid abuse must be a
desire on the police department's part to know more about police
anabolic steroid use.  The reasons why officers become involved
in taking steroids and to what extent they use them is unclear.
Is it a matter of ignorance or lack of information that officers
simply don't know the risks they are taking?  Is it because they
believe that not only are they "out-gunned," but also
"out-muscled" by criminals?  Does it have little to do with work
and more to do with a narcissistic involvement with one's own
body?  These questions and many others must be addressed as
departments cope with steroid issues.

MEASURES TO TAKE                                                  

     Most police departments do not have a blanket policy of
anabolic steroid screening for recruits.  Also, the extent of
anabolic steroid use by police officers is presently unclear.
However, departments should begin to train supervisors,
background investigators, and internal affairs personnel on how
to identify the physical and behavioral signs associated with
anabolic steroid abuse.

     In addition to the physical and psychological symptoms
previously noted, other possible indicators to begin looking for
are sleep disorders, marked increases in irritability,
depression, unusual nervous tension, trouble in concentrating on
cognitive tasks, increased officer-to-officer conflicts, and
complaints from the officer about the department, its policies
and procedures, or working conditions.  If members of police
departments are made aware of these symptoms, they will be more
readily equipped to confront a possible abuse situation.

CONCLUSION                                                        

     There are sufficient independent indicators to warrant
attention from police administrators about officer use of
anabolic steroids.  The risks to officers' physical and mental
health are real and significant, and officer anabolic steroid
abuse places the public they are sworn to protect at risk.
Because of such abuse, police families are exposed to additional
stresses, potential liabilities may be created, and important
interdepartmental relationships can become endangered.

     It is a time for thoughtful, measured assessment and
prudent action concerning all of the harmful effects steroid
abuse creates.  Departments must become aware of this very real
problem, educate their officers about steroids, and design
effective policies concerning steroid abuse.
