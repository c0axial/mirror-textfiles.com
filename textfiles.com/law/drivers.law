      SURVEY RESULTS:  DRIVER LICENSE SUSPENSION PROGRAMS

                                                                 
     Editor's note:  As used here, administrative driver license 
     suspension programs are those wherein an offender's license
     is suspended on the basis of an administrative finding that
     the person drove a motor vehicle while having an alcohol
     concentration at or above the lawful limit.  

     A recent survey of State police, licensing officials, court
administrators, and local police chiefs in 22 States with driver
license suspension programs in place reveals widespread support
for this procedure.  The survey was intended to update and
expand the results of a 1986 survey conducted by the
International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), which also
reflected overwhelming support for suspension programs by both
State and local police managers.

     A total of 132 questionnaires were distributed.  In
addition to one being sent to each State police superintendent,
driver licensing agency, and court administrator in each of the
22 States employing a license suspension program (at the time
of the survey), three local police chiefs in each of the
participating States were also solicited for their views.  Only
States having a program in place for at least 12 months were
surveyed.

     The survey form consisted of only four questions and was
designed to allow the respondents latitude in answering.  The
questions elicited detailed responses and were intended to gauge
the level of support for suspension programs by each agency.

RESULTS

     Fifteen responses were received from State Police, 19 from
driver licensing officials, 10 from State court administrators,
and 44 from local police chiefs, for a return rate of 64
percent.  The three functions surveyed (police, licensing, and
courts) gave strong approval to the suspension concept.  In
fact, from the 88 questionnaires returned, only two negative
responses were given.  These were by local chiefs who expressed
concern about the cost to police departments for providing
testimony at an administrative hearing and then again at trial
in criminal court.

     Since prompt licensing sanctions are generally believed to
encourage guilty pleas, and therefore, reduce court backlogs,
responses from court administrators were of special interest.
Seven of the 10 court administrators who responded noted that
the procedures provide a quick and certain response to a serious
traffic offense, remove a major burden from the courts, and
provide a uniform policy for driver license suspension or
revocation.  The responding court officials also stated that the
program appears to be working well in each of their own States.

     All responses from State licensing officials and State
police superintendents were favorable and revealed strong
support for the suspension programs employed in their respective
States.  Except for the two negative comments noted above, the
response from local police chiefs was also overwhelmingly
favorable.
