This proves that you reading this are probably a motorist
traveling and not a driver driving. But your schools, 
parents, and friends all told you that driving is a 
privelege and not a right. But what is a driver ?????
A person who receives financial compensation from
transporting the public is a driver according to
law researchers. If you just travel about in your car
you probably are not a driver. If you are not a driver
then you have a constitutional right to travel about
in your car without being required to have a driver's
License, register your car or buy auto insurance !!!!

*
     The accused, Smart Brave Lady, hereby gives Notice of
her  continued special appearance before this tribunal, as 
it is in  want of subject matter jurisdiction and
jurisdiction of the  person of the accused.  The lack of 
jurisdiction arises under the  doctrine of primary 
jurisdiction and the plaintiff has made  finding of facts, 
upon which this Court must take judicial notice  to 
convict, without affording an opportunity to be heard and 
the  plaintiff has otherwise failed to exhaust its 
administrative  remedies.
*    Accordingly this Court should discharge the offenses
brought  against the accused, or issue a stay in
proceedings pending the  outcome of a proper hearing
in the agency or issue an order to  show cause to the
plantiff why these offenses should not be  discharged
or the proceedings stayed pending proper agency  action.
*    This Notice of Special Appearance is supported by 
the  attached statement of facts and points of authority.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 5th day of July, 1989
