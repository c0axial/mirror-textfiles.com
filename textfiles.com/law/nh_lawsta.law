/* If you are running a BBS and you want to limit access to only 
those who give their real names, and the system is a no-charge 
BBS, then you would have to make that clear on sign on. Please 
see the source code library for ASCII code for such a sign on. */

the offense shall be deemed to have been committed in the town in 
which the act occurred or in which the computer system or part 
thereof involved in the violation was located.

/*"Venue" is the law of where a case will be heard. Venue is easy 
in an armed robbery of a liquor store, since you know where the 
crime took place, and ordinarily, crimes are tried in the area 
where they took place. But in computer crime, it is very hard to 
figure out where the crime took place. The venue provision of New 
Hampshire basically says that it can be tried wherever you can 
catch the baddie. */

     II. In any prosecution for a violation of RSA 638:17 based 
upon more than one act in violation thereof, the offense shall be

involved in a violation was located.

     III. If any act performed in furtherance of the offenses 
prohibited by RSA 638:17 occurs in this state or if any computer 
system or part thereof accessed in violation of RSA 638:17 is 
located in this state, the offense shall be deemed to have 
occurred in this state.
