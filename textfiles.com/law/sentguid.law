Re:     Proposed Amendent #59 to the Sentencing Guidelines for 
        United States Courts, which creates a new guideline applicable 
        to violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1988 (18 
        U.S.C.   1030)


Dear Commissioners:

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) writes to state our opposition 
to the new proposed sentencing guideline applicable to violations of the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1988, 18 U.S.C.   1030 (CFAA).  We 
believe that, while the proposed guideline promotes the Justice 
Department's interest in punishing those who engage in computer fraud 
and abuse, the guideline is much too harsh for first time offenders and 
those who perpetrate offenses under the statute without malice 
aforethought.  In addition, promulgation of a sentencing guideline at 
the present time is premature, as there have been very few published 
opinions where judges have issued sentences for violations of the CFAA.  
Finally, in this developing area of the law, judges should be permitted 
to craft sentences that are just in relation to the facts of the 
specific cases before them.



The Proposed Guideline Is Too Harsh.

The proposed CFAA sentencing guideline, with a base offense level of six 
and innumerable enhancements, would impose strict felony liability for 
harms that computer users cause through sheer inadvertence.  This 
guideline would require imprisonment for first time offenders who caused 
no real harm and meant none.  EFF is opposed to computer trespass and 
theft, and we do not condone any unauthorized tampering with computers -
- indeed, EFF's unequivocal belief is that the security of private 
computer systems and networks is both desirable and necessary to the 
maintenance of a free society.  However, it is entirely contrary to our 
notions of justice to brand a computer user who did not intend to do 
harm as a felon.  Under the proposed guideline, even a user who 
painstakingly attempts to avoid causing harm, but who causes harm 
nonetheless, will almost assuredly be required to serve some time in 
prison.

The proposed guideline, where the sentencing judge is given no 
discretion for crafting a just sentence based on the facts of the case, 
is too harsh on less culpable defendants, particularly first time 
offenders.  As the Supreme Court has stated, the notion that a culpable 
mind is a necessary component of criminal guilt is "as universal and 
persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human 
will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to 
choose between good and evil."  Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 
246, 250 (1952).  In the words of another court, "[u]sually the stigma 
of criminal conviction is not visited upon citizens who are not morally 
to blame because they did not know they were doing wrong."  United 
States v. Marvin, 687 F.2d 1221, 1226 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 
U.S. 1081 (1983).


There Is Not Yet Enough Caselaw to Warrant a Guideline.

The Sentencing Commission itself has recognized the importance of 
drafting guidelines based on a large number of reported decisions.  In 
the introduction to the Sentencing Commission's Guidelines Manual, the 
Commission states:

The Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with 
considerable caution.  It examined the many hundreds of criminal 
statutes in the United States Code.  It began with those that were the 
basis for a significant number of prosecutions and sought to place them 
in a rational order.  It developed additional distinctions relevant to 
the application of these provisions, and it applied sentencing ranges to 
each resulting category.  In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines 
sentencing practice as revealed by its own statistical analyses based on 
summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented 
pre-sentence reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.

United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Chap. 1, Part A 
(1991).

At the present time, there are only five reported decisions that mention 
the court's sentencing for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse 
Act.  See, United States v. Lewis, 872 F.2d 1030 (6th Cir. 1989); United 
States v. Morris, 928 F.2d 504 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 
72 (1991); United States v. Carron, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 4838 (9th Cir. 
1991); United States v. Rice, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 9562 (1992); and 
United States v. DeMonte, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 11392 (6th Cir. 1992).  
New communications technologies, in their earliest infancy, are becoming 
the subject of precedent-setting litigation.  Overly strict sentences 
imposed for computer-related fraud and abuse may have the effect of 
chilling these technologies even as they develop.  Five decisions are 
not enough on which to base a guideline to be used in such an important 
and growing area of the law.

The Commission itself has recognized that certain areas of federal 
criminal law and procedure are so new that policy statements, rather 
than inflexible guidelines, are preferable.  See, e.g., United States 
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, Chap. 7, Part A (1990) 
(stating the Commission's choice to promulgate policy statements, rather 
than guidelines, for revocation of probation and supervised release 
"until federal judges, probation officers, practitioners, and others 
have the opportunity to evaluate and comment. . . .").  A flexible 
policy statement, rather than a specific sentencing guideline, is a more 
appropriate way to handle sentencing under the Computer Fraud and Abuse 
Act until there has been enough litigation on which to base a guideline.


Judges Must Be Permitted to Craft Their Own Sentences for Cases 
Involving Special Circumstances.

Individual sentencing decisions are best left to the discretion of the 
sentencing judge, who presumably is most familiar with the facts unique 
to each case.  To promulgate an inflexible sentencing guideline, which 
would cover all crimes that could conceivably be prosecuted under the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, is premature at this time.

As discussed above, there have only been five reported decisions where 
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has been applied.  In three of these 
reported CFAA cases, the judges involved used their discretion and 
fashioned unique sentences for the defendants based on the special facts 
of the case.  See, Morris, 928 F.2d at 506 (where the judge placed 
Defendant Morris on probation for three years to perform 400 hours of 
community service, ordered him to pay fines of $10,050, and ordered him 
to pay for the cost of his supervision at a rate of $91 a month); Carron 
at 3 (where the judge found that Defendant Carron's criminal history 
justified a sentence of 12 months incarceration followed by 12 months of 
supervised release and restitution to the two injured credit card 
companies); and DeMonte at 4 (where the trial court judge held that 
Defendant DeMonte's "extraordinary and unusual level of cooperation" 
warranted a sentence of three years probation with no incarceration).  
Judges must be permitted to continue fashioning sentences that are just, 
based on the facts of a specific case.

Computer communications are still in their infancy.  Legal precedents, 
particularly the application of a sentencing guideline to violations of 
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, can radically affect the course of the 
computer technology's future, and with it the fate of an important tool 
for the exchange of ideas in a democratic society.  When the law limits 
or inhibits the use of new technologies, a grave injustice is being 
perpetrated.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation respectfully asks the 
Commission to hold off promulgating a sentencing guideline for the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act until there are enough prosecutions on 
which to base a guideline.



Thank you in advance for your thoughtful consideration of our concerns.  
We would be pleased to provide the Commission with any further 
information that may be needed.

Sincerely yours,



Shari Steele
Staff Attorney
