electronic communications system for one hundred and eighty days 
or less, only pursuant to a warrant issued under the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent State warrant.  A 
governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of 
electronic communications services of the contents of an 
electronic communication that has been in electronic storage in 
an electronic communications system for more than one hundred and 
eighty days by the means available under subsection (b) of this 
section.

/* The following sections directly relate to BBS systems. */

(b) CONTENTS OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS IN A REMOTE COMPUTING 
SERVICE.--

(1 A governmental entity may require a provider of remote 
computing service to disclose the contents of any electronic 
communication to which this paragraph is made applicable by 
paragraph (2) of this subsection--

(A) without required notice to the subscriber or customer, if the 
governmental entity obtains a warrant issued under the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent State warrant; or

(B) with prior notice from the governmental entity to the 
subscriber or customer if the governmental entity--

(i) uses an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or 
State statute or a Federal or State grand jury subpoena; or

(ii) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection 
(d) of this section;

except that delayed notice may be given pursuant to section 2705 
of this title.

(2) Paragraph (1) is applicable with respect to any electronic 
communication that is held or maintained on that service--

(A) on behalf of, and received by means of electronic 
transmission from (or created by means of computer processing of 
communications received by means of electronic transmission 
from), a subscriber or customer of such remote computing service; 
and

(B) solely for the purpose of providing storage or computer 
processing services to such subscriber or customer, if the 
provider is not authorized to access the contents of any such 
communications for purposes of providing any services other than 
storage or computer processing.

(c) RECORDS CONCERNING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SERVICE OR REMOTE 
COMPUTING SERVICE.--

(1) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a provider of 
electronic communication service or remote computing service may 
disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber 
to or customer of such service (not including the contents of 
communications covered by subsection (a) or (b) of this section) 
to any person other than a governmental entity.

(B) A provider of electronic communication service or remote 
computing service shall disclose a record or other information 
pertaining to a subscriber to or customer of such service (not 
including the contents of communications covered by subsection 
(a) or (b) of this section) to a governmental entity only when 
the governmental entity--

(i) uses an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or 
State statute, or a Federal or State grand jury subpoena;

(ii) obtains a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure or equivalent State warrant;

(iii) obtains a court order for such disclosure under subsection 
(d) of this section; or

(iv) has the consent of the subscriber or customer to such 
disclosure.

under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall issue only if 
the governmental entity shows that there is reason to believe the 
contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or 
other information sought, are relevant to a legitimate law 
enforcement inquiry.  In the case of a State governmental 
authority, such a court order shall not issue if prohibited by 
the law of such State.  A court issuing an order pursuant to this 
section, on a motion made promptly by the service provider, may 
quash or modify such order, if the information or records 
requested are unusually voluminous in nature or compliance with 
such order otherwise would cause an undue burden on such 
provider.

(e) NO CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST A PROVIDER DISCLOSING INFORMATION 
UNDER THIS CHAPTER.-- No cause of action shall lie in any court 
against any provider of wire or electronic communication service, 
its officers, employees, agents, or other specified persons for

certification under this chapter.


2704. Backup preservation

(a) BACKUP PRESERVATION.--

include in its subpoena or court order a requirement that the 
service provider to whom the request is directed create a backup 
copy of the contents of the electronic communications sought in 
order to preserve those communications.  Without notifying the 
subscriber or customer of such subpoena or court order, such 
service provider shall create such backup copy as soon as 
practicable consistent with its regular business practices and 
shall confirm to the governmental entity that such backup copy 
has been made.  Such backup copy shall be created within two 
business days after receipt by the service provider of the 
subpoena or court order.

(2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall be made by the 
governmental entity within three days after receipt of such 
confirmation, unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 
2705(a).

(3) The service provider shall not destroy such backup copy until 
the later of--

(A) the delivery of the information; or

(B) the resolution of any proceedings (including appeals of any 
proceeding) concerning the government's subpoena or court order.

(4) The service provider shall release such backup copy to the 
requesting governmental entity no sooner than fourteen days after 
the governmental entity's notice to the subscriber or customer if 
such service provider--

(A) has not received notice from the subscriber or customer that 
the subscriber or customer has challenged the governmental 
entity's request; and

(B) has not initiated proceedings to challenge the request of the 
governmental entity.

(5) A governmental entity may seek to require the creation of a 
backup copy under subsection (a)(1) of this section if in its 
sole discretion such entity determines that there is reason to 
believe that notification under section 2703 of this title of the 
existence of the subpoena or court order may result in 
destruction of or tampering with evidence.  This determination is 
not subject to challenge by the subscriber or customer or service 
provider.

(b) CUSTOMER CHALLENGES.--

(1) Within fourteen days after notice by the governmental entity 
to the subscriber or customer under subsection (a)(2) of this 
section, such subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash 
such subpoena or vacate such court order, with copies served upon 
the governmental entity and with written notice of such challenge 
to the service provider.  A motion to vacate a court order shall 
be filed in the court which issued such order.  A motion to quash 
a subpoena shall be filed in the appropriate Unites States 
district court or State court.  Such motion or application shall 
contain an affidavit or sworn statement--

(A) stating that the applicant is a customer or subscriber to the 
service from which the contents of electronic communications 
maintained for him have been sought; and

(B) stating the applicant's reasons for believing that the 
records sought are not relevant to a legitimate law enforcement 
inquiry or that there has not been substantial compliance with 
the provisions of this chapter in some other respect.

(2) Service shall be made under this section upon a governmental 
entity by delivering or mailing by registered or certified mail a 
copy of the papers to the person, office, or department specified 
in the notice which the customer has received pursuant to this 
chapter.  For the purposes of this section, the term "delivery" 
has the meaning given that term in the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.

(3) If the court finds that the customer has complied with 
paragraphs (1) an (2) of this subsection, the court shall order 
the governmental entity to file a sworn response, which may be 
filed in camera if the governmental entity includes in its 
response the reasons which make in camera review appropriate.  If 
the court is unable to determine the motion or application on the 
basis of the parties' initial allegations and response, the court 
may conduct such additional proceedings as it deems appropriate.  
All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion or 
application decided as soon as practicable after the filing of 
the governmental entity's response.

(4) If the court finds that the applicant is not the subscriber 
or customer for whom the communications sought by the 
governmental entity are maintained, or that there is a reason to 
believe that the law enforcement inquiry is legitimate and that 
the communications sought are relevant to that inquiry, it shall 
deny the motion or application and order such process enforced.  
If the court finds that the applicant is the subscriber or 
customer for whom the communications sought by the governmental 
entity are maintained, and that there is not a reason to believe 
that the communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law 
enforcement inquiry, or that there has not been substantial 
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, it shall order 
the process quashed.

(5) A court order denying a motion or application under this 
section shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutory 
appeal may be taken therefrom by the customer.

there is reason to believe that notification of the existence of 
the court order may have an adverse result described in paragraph 
(2) of this subsection; or

(B) where an administrative subpoena authorized by a Federal or 
State statute or a Federal or State grand jury subpoena is 
obtained, delay the notification required under section 2703(b) 
of this title for a period not to exceed ninety days upon the 
execution of a written certification of a supervisory official 
that there is reason to believe that notification of the 
existence of the subpoena may have an adverse result described in

only in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.

(5) Upon expiration of the period of delay of notification under 
paragraph (1) or (4) of this subsection, the governmental entity 
shall serve upon, or deliver by registered or first- class mail 
to, the customer or subscriber a copy of the process or request 
together with notice that--

(A) states with reasonable specificity the nature of the law 
enforcement inquiry; and

(B) informs such customer or subscriber--

governmental entity acting under section 2703, when it is not 
required to notify the subscriber or customer under section

pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, may apply to a court 
for an order commanding a provider of electronic communications 
service or remote computing service to whom a warrant, subpoena, 
or court order is directed, for such period as the court deems 
appropriate, not to notify any other person of the existence of 
the warrant, subpoena, or court order.  The court shall enter 
such an order if it determines that there is reason to believe 
that notification of the existence of the warrant, subpoena, or 
court order will results in--

(1) endangering the life or physical safety of an individual;

(2) flight from prosecution;

which a criminal prosecution relating to such information would 
be brought, if no court order was issued for production of the 
information).
