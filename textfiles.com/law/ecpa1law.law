2510.  Definitions

     As used in this chapter --

(1)  "wire communication" means any aural transfer made in whole 
or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of 
communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like 
connection between the point of origin and the point of reception 
(including the use of such connection in a switching station) 
furnished or operated by any person engaged in providing or 
operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or 
foreign communications or communications affecting interstate or 
foreign commerce and such term includes any electronic storage of 
such communication, but such term does not include the radio 
portion of a cordless telephone communication that is transmitted 
between the cordless telephone handset and the base unit;

/* Whenever the term "wire communication" is used, it will 
include communications on a BBS that is connected with the 
telephone system. Arguably interconnection of a private LAN 
would also meet this definitions since the communications of 
anyone in business will include an affect on interstate commerce. 
*/

(2)  "oral communication" means any oral communication uttered by 
a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is  
not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such 
expectation,  but such term does not include any  electronic 
communication;

(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter  
any person who--

(a) intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures  
any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, 
oral, or electronic communication;

(b) intentionally uses, endeavors to use, or procures any other 
person to use or endeavor to use any electronic, mechanical, or 
other device to intercept any oral communication when --

(i) such device is affixed to, or otherwise transmits a signal 
through, a wire, cable, or other like connection used in wire 
communication; or

(ii) such device transmits communications by radio, or interferes 
with the transmission of such communication; or

(iii) such person knows, or has reason to know, that such device 
or any component thereof has been sent through the mail or  
transported in interstate or foreign commerce; or

(iv) such use or endeavor to use (A) takes place on the premises   
of any business or other commercial establishment the operations 
of which affect interstate or foreign commerce; or (B) obtains or  
is for the purpose of obtaining information relating to the 
operations of any business or other commercial establishment the 
operations of which affect interstate or foreign commerce; or

(v) such person acts in the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of 
the United States;

(c) intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any 
other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic 
communication, knowing or have reason to know that the 
information was obtained through the interception of a wire, 
oral, or electronic  communication in violation of this 
subsection; or

/* This section creates civil as well as criminal liability for 
attempting to disclose or disclosing electronic communications. 
Accordingly, these sections are a significant constraint on BBS 
systems. Many systems include an ECPA disclaimer which states 
something to the effect that "there aren't any private 
communications" on this system. 

(d) intentionally uses, or endeavors to use, the contents of any 
wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason 
to know that the information was obtained through the 
interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in 
violation of this subsection;

shall be punished as provided in subsection (4) or shall be 
subject to suit as provided in subsection (5).

(2)(a)(i) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an 
operator of a switchboard, or an officer, employee, or agent of a 
provider of wire or electronic communication service, whose 
facilities are used in the transmission of a wire communication, 
to intercept, disclose, or use that communication in the normal  
course of his employment while engaged in any activity which is  
a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the  
protection of the rights or property of the provider of that 
service, except that a provider of wire communication service to 
the public shall not utilize service observing or random 
monitoring except for mechanical or service quality control 
checks.

/* This section provides only a very limited exception to the 
general rule that communications may not be "intercepted." Since 
a BBS system which is not restricted to employees (therefore open 
to the public) can not intercept communications unless necessary 
to protect property rights, or for service quality control. */

(ii) Notwithstanding any other law, providers of wire or 
electronic communication  service, their officers, employees,  
and agents, landlords, custodians, or other persons, are 
authorized to provide information facilities, or technical  
assistance to persons authorized by law to intercept wire,   
oral, or electronic communications or to conduct electronic 
surveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, if such provider, its 
officers, employees, or agents, landlord, custodian, or other 
specified person, has been provided with --

(A) a court order directing such assistance signed by the 
authorizing judge, or

(B) a certification in writing by a person specified in section 
2518(7) of this title or the Attorney General of the United 
States that no warrant or court order is required by law, that 
all statutory requirements have been met, and that the specified 
assistance is required.

setting forth the period of time during which the provision of 
the information, facilities, or technical assistance is   
authorized and specifying the information, facilities,  or  
technical assistance required.  No provider of wire or   
electronic communication service, officer, employee, or agent 
thereof, or landlord, custodian, or other specified person shall 
disclose the existence of any interception or surveillance or the 
device used to accomplish the interception or surveillance with 
respect to which the person has been furnished a court order or 
certification under this chapter, except as may otherwise  be  
required by legal process and then only after prior notification 
to the Attorney General or to the principal prosecuting attorney 
of a State or any political subdivision of a State, as may be 
appropriate. Any such disclosure, shall render such person  
liable for the civil damages provided for in section 2520.  No  
cause of action shall lie in any court against any provider  of  
wire or electronic communication service, its officers,  
employees, or agents, landlord, custodian, or other specified 
person for providing information, facilities, or assistance in 
accordance with the terms of an order or certification under this 
subparagraph.

(b) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an officer, 
employee, or agent of the Federal Communications Commission, in  
the normal course of his employment and in discharge of the  
monitoring responsibilities exercised by the Commission in the 
enforcement of chapter 5 of title 47 of the United States Code,   
to intercept a wire or electronic communication, or  oral 
communication transmitted by radio, or to disclose or use the 
information thereby obtained.

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person 
acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or 
electronic communication, where such person is a party to the 
communication or one of the parties to the communication has 
given prior consent to such interception.

/* Although state laws can vary, under federal law a party can 
record a telephone or other conversation. However, a 
communications provider like a BBS is not a party to the message. 
*/

(d) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not 
acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or 
electronic communication where such person is a party to the 
communication or where one of the parties to the communication  
has given prior consent to such interception unless such 
communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any 
criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws 
of the United States or of any State.

/* This section is relied upon by many BBS operators to avoid 
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title or section 
705 or 706 of the Communications Act of 1934, it shall not be 
unlawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the United States  
in the normal course of his official duty to conduct electronic  
surveillance,  as defined in section 101 of  the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as authorized by that Act.

          (f)  Nothing contained in this chapter or chapter 121, or section 
               705  of the Communications Act of 1934,  shall be deemed  to 
               affect  the acquisition by the United States  Government  of 
               foreign   intelligence  information  from  international  or 
               foreign communications,  or foreign intelligence  activities 
               conducted  in  accordance with otherwise applicable  Federal 
               law  involving a foreign electronic  communications  system, 
               utilizing  a  means  other than electronic  surveillance  as 
               defined   in  section  101  of  the   Foreign   Intelligence 
               Surveillance Act of 1978, and procedures in this chapter and 
               the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall  be 
               the  exclusive  means by which electronic  surveillance,  as 
               defined in section 101 of such Act,  and the interception of 
               domestic wire and oral communications may be conducted.

          (g)  It  shall not be unlawful under this chapter or chapter  121 
               of this title for any person --

               (i)  to intercept or access an electronic communication made 
                    through  an  electronic communication  system  that  is 
                    configured  so  that such electronic  communication  is 
                    readily accessible to the general public;

               (ii) to   intercept   any  radio  communication   which   is 
                    transmitted --

                    (I)  by  any station for the use of the general public, 
                         or that relates to ships,  aircraft,  vehicles, or 
                         persons in distress;

                    (II) by  any  governmental,   law  enforcement,   civil 
                         defense,  private  land mobile,  or public  safety 
                         communications system,  including police and fire, 
                         readily accessible to the general public;

                    (III) by a station operating on an authorized frequency 
                         within   the  bands  allocated  to  the   amateur, 
                         citizens band,  or general mobile radio  services; 
                         or

                    (IV) by   any  marine  or  aeronautical  communications 
                         system;

               (iii) to engage in any conduct which --

                    (I)  is prohibited by section 633 of the Communications 
                         Act of 1934; or

                    (II) is excepted from the application of section 705(a) 
                         of  the  Communications  Act of  1934  by  section 
                         705(b) of that Act;

               (iv) to  intercept any wire or electronic communication  the 
                    transmission  of which is causing harmful  interference 
                    to   any   lawfully  operating  station   or   consumer 
                    electronic  equipment,   to  the  extent  necessary  to 
                    identify the source of such interference; or

               (v)  for other users of the same frequency to intercept  any 
                    radio communication made through a system that utilizes 
                    frequencies  monitored  by individuals engaged  in  the 
                    provision   or  the  use  of  such  system,   if   such 
                    communication is not scrambled or encrypted.

          (h)  It shall not be unlawful under this chapter --

               (i)  to  use  a pen register or a trap and trace device  (as 
                    those terms are defined for the purposes of chapter 206 
                    (relating to pen registers and trap and trace  devices) 
                    of this title); or

               (ii) for  a provider of electronic communication service  to 
                    record the fact that a wire or electronic communication 
                    was  initiated  or completed in order to  protect  such 
                    provider,  another  provider furnishing service  toward 
                    the completion of the wire or electronic communication, 
                    or a user of that service, from fraudulent, unlawful or

               or  entity,  or an agent thereof) while in  transmission  on 
               that service to any person or entity other than an addressee 
               or  intended recipient of such communication or an agent  of 
               such addressee or intended recipient.

          (b)  A   person  or  entity  providing  electronic  communication 
               service  to the public may divulge the contents of any  such

                    provider  and which appear to pertain to the commission 
                    of  a  crime,  if  such divulgence is  made  to  a  law 
                    enforcement agency.

               more than five years, or both.

          (b)  If  the  offense is a first offense under paragraph  (a)  of 
               this subsection and is not for a tortious or illegal purpose 
               or  for purposes of direct or indirect commercial  advantage 
               or  private  commercial gain,  and the  wire  or  electronic

                    telephone  communication,  a public land  mobile  radio 
                    service    communication    or   a    paging    service 
                    communication,  the  offender  shall be fined not  more 
                    than $500.

          (c)  Conduct  otherwise  an offense under  this  subsection  that
