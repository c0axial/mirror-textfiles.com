/* R FRINGE COMMENTARY- Here's the Maryland Computer Crimes Law, 
with comments; Article 27, Section 146, Code of Maryland, "Crimes 
and Punishments */

    (a) Definitions- In this section the following words have the 
meanings indicated.

    (1)(i) "Computer" means an electronic, magnetic, optical, 
organic, or other data processing device or system that performs 
logical, arithmetic, memory or storage functions.

/* The reference to organic is very interesting. I guess when 
someone clones a brain (hopefully one much better than mine) then 
it is protected as well. */
 
     (ii) "Computer" includes any property, data storage 
facility, or communications facility that is directly related to 
or operated in conjunction with that device or system.

    (iii) "Computer" does not include an automated typewriter or 
typesetter, a portable calculator, or any computer that:

  1. Is designed, manufactured, and used exclusively for routine 
personal, family or household purposes; and

  2. Is not used to access, communicated with, or manipulate any 
other computer.

/* Curious. Why shouldn't your video game system have just as 
much protection as a mainframe used for credit card transaction 
processing? In any event, all of you with modems are within the 
protection provided by this law. */

    (2) "Computer control language" means any ordered statements 
that direct a computer to perform specific functions.

/* Yikes. Since my programming is so good, and I never know what 
my code will cause the computer to do, so I guess my code isn't a 
computer control language since it causes the computer to lock up 
or to perform random functions. */ 

/* The preceding comment was a joke. */

/*Just wanted to be sure that you knew that it was a joke. */

information, knowledge,, facts, concepts or instructions that:
