     One of the most frequently asked questions by police 
administrators is, ``How can we hire qualified, experienced 
personnel?''  The answer to this question may come in the form of 
lateral entry.  In fact, one of the keys to successful recruiting 
in the future will be the practice of a full-scale lateral entry 
program. (1)
                                                         
     Basically, lateral entry is the ability of a police officer 
in one geographic location to enter employment in another area. 
The officer's pay at the new department is based on experience, 
job knowledge, and the ability to do the job. (2)
                    
     The concept of lateral entry is not new.  It has existed for 
some 25 to 30 years.  Unfortunately, however, police departments 
overlook the advantages of lateral entry, even though its 
potential to improve a department's recruiting efforts and 
professionalism is evident.  This article discusses several of 
the benefits of lateral entry and some of the obstacles to 
implementing such programs within police departments.        

ADVANTAGES OF LATERAL ENTRY                                       

     For most law enforcement departments, there are four areas 
that benefit the most by lateral entry:                           

    *  Recruiting                                                   
    *  Individual mobility                                          
    *  Training and cost effectiveness and                          
    *  Competition and educational growth.                          

Even though most departments will benefit from lateral entry 
programs, some departments may not experience advantages relating 
to all four of these areas.                                   

Enhanced Recruitment                                              

     The recruitment of qualified personnel becomes more 
difficult as time passes.  In the past, all that was necessary 
was a pool of applicants.  Today, this is no longer the case. In 
fact, in many police agencies, position vacancies outnumber the 
applicants.                                                       

     However, when initiated and administered properly, lateral 
entry could open up a new source of qualified applicants to help 
meet future recruiting needs. (3)  Lateral entry programs attract 
innovative, administrative, professional and technical 
personnel, especially for the small department. (4)  For example, 
many former police officers have left law enforcement because of 
inflexibilities, such as the lack of mobility and promotional 
opportunity.  Yet, these officers would be desirable candidates 
in many police departments, if they were available for 
employment.  Lateral entry is a way to gain access to such an 
untapped resource.                                         

Individual Mobility                                               

     Another benefit of lateral entry pertains to police officers 
who are currently employed in law enforcement, but would like to 
relocate. (5)  Typically, officers desire relocation in order to 
move from a smaller department to a larger department, for more 
promotional potential, more job responsibilities or enrichment, 
or because of spouse relocation.  All of these are valid reasons 
for mobility and should in no way detract from the individual 
seeking lateral entry.                                            

     Today, with community and corporate growth, mobility is 
becoming even more of a concern.  One reason for this is the 
changing role of women. (6)  Women also are thinking "careers." 
In fact, dual-career couples have become the rule rather than 
the exception in American society. (7)                               

     Dual-career couples create problems for law enforcement.  
Now, a police officer with a family must consider the spouse's
career opportunities in the decisionmaking process.  In many
cases, a spouse may have more advancement and earning potential
than the law enforcement officer, and relocation may be
necessary in order to advance within the organization.  Often
times, husbands or wives are giving up or changing professions
so that their spouses can pursue their careers. (8)

     In addition, officers may look toward mobility for other 
reasons, such as caring for ill relatives or wanting a change in 
climate.  In today's law enforcement community, a police officer 
who is fully qualified and capable of performing the job should 
have the option of lateral relocation without fear of losing rank 
and/or pay.                                                

Training and Cost Effectiveness                                   

     Police officer training is both time consuming and 
expensive.  It is not only costly from the view point of salary, 
benefits, and uniforms but also because of down-time prior to 
achieving patrol officer status.  For this reason, lateral entry 
police officers provide substantial savings to police 
departments.  In cases where the lateral entry applicant comes 
from within the State, the savings could be even greater.  For 
example, in most States, individuals must meet certain basic 
minimum standards and must complete a prescribed training program 
in order to be employed anywhere in the State. (9)  This is usually 
a one-time process and permits a certified officer to transfer. 
Adapting police standards and training legislation is a good 
first step toward lateral entry. (10)
                                
     In many areas, the Field Training Officer (FTO) Program is 
the second step in the training process.  This is an important 
phase and should be required of every new officer, even the 
lateral entry officer.  However, even if the FTO phase of the 
training is included, the lateral entry candidate still saves 
police departments both time and money.                           

     For example, in 1985, the Cobb County, Georgia, Police 
Department estimated that each new police officer costs the 
department between $18,000 to $20,000 before that officer can 
work a shift without direct supervision.  Lateral entry 
candidates save a large portion of this cost.  These savings 
could be better used to pay the increased salaries of lateral 
entry employees.                                                  

     When considering the variables of cost and time, it is easy 
to see that the savings realized from the lateral entry candidate 
can be spent on higher salaries.  What the police administrator 
really gets from lateral entry is an experienced officer who is 
assimilated into the department faster.  In today's fast moving 
world, this is very much desired.                                 

Competition and Educational Growth                                

     Support for lateral entry also comes from the Nation's 
leadership.  In 1967, the President's Commission on Law 
Enforcement in its Task Force Report:  Police stated:             

     ``To improve police services, competition for all advanced 
     positions should be opened to all qualified persons from
     both within and outside of the department.  This would 
     enable a department to obtain the best available talent 
     for positions of leadership.  If candidates from within 
     an agency are unable to meet the competition from other 
     applicants, it should be recognized that the influx of
     more highly qualified personnel would greatly improve the 
     quality of the services.'' (11)            

     The commission's recommendations and farsightedness were 
optimistic that lateral entry is one of the keys to the 
competitive spirit needed to enhance the police profession.  
This prescription for the success of the police field is as 
valid today as it was in 1967.  Lateral entry is essential to the 
professionalization of the police function.  It also disturbs the 
status quo and avoids the we've-always-done-it-this-way 
approach. (12)                                                       

     In addition, lateral entry affects positively the 
educational processes of the upwardly mobile department members. 
It helps provide fresh points of view because people with 
different experiences and insights introduce variety, change and 
innovative ideas. (13)  Many officers are finding out, or will find 
out, that in order to keep up with the competition, they must 
refine skills already developed.  Lateral entry also bolsters 
management and technical strength, as well as increases 
competition and productivity, by providing new talent and 
ability. (14)  It also provides management with a better yardstick 
for evaluating executive performance and forces management to 
compare the present group with outsiders. (15)  And, once police 
departments start using lateral entry, law enforcement executives 
will no longer have to accept marginal employees.  Lateral entry 
could also help to merge effective policing concepts from various 
police departments, thereby raising the levels of education and 
training in participating departments.  This creates a better 
understanding of law enforcement affairs. (16)                 

OBSTACLES TO LATERAL ENTRY                                        

     Despite the obvious benefits, obstacles to lateral entry 
still exist. (17)  Police personnel at the patrol level and upper 
management seem to have the least resistance.  And, as expected, 
the more established the department, the more restrictions there 
seem to be to the lateral entry concept.                   

Department Personnel

     Mid-level police administrators present the biggest 
obstacle.  At one time, police officials believed that lateral 
recruiting was the equivalent of "raiding," and police chiefs 
even had pacts that they would not hire each other's 
personnel. (18)  However, the resistance and obstacles to full 
implementation of lateral entry are not limited to department 
personnel.  Roadblocks can arise in the form of civil service, 
retirement plans, maximum age limitations, and legislative 
restrictions.                                             

Resistance to Change                                              

     Change in law enforcement comes slowly, and this is the case 
with lateral entry.  In fact, some believe that it will never 
reach the level that the President's Commission on Law 
Enforcement envisioned in 1967.  To achieve this goal, all of the 
obstacles to lateral entry must be addressed individually and 
systematically.  Many departments have already dealt with some of 
the obstacles.  Obviously, eliminating the obstacles is not easy, 
but the result to law enforcement will be well worth the effort.  

CONCLUSION                                                        

     Acceptance of lateral entry will continue to be a long, 
uphill battle.  However, it is imperative that those in law 
enforcement who support lateral entry, both academically and 
professionally, continue to chip away at the resistance until it 
is universally accepted.  The future of police improvement in all 
jurisdictions will be handicapped if there are not forthcoming 
changes in the acceptance of lateral entry. (19)                     

     Some believe that the key to the success of lateral entry is 
at the State and Federal level.  In a real sense, this is true 
because through legislative reform and financial encouragements, 
the State and Federal Governments can do much to implement 
lateral entry.  Some advancements in this area have been made, 
such as legislative reforms that contribute to the cause of 
lateral entry and the statewide training requirements that are 
recognized anywhere in a given State.  But, the battle for 
lateral entry is not going to be won at the State and national 
levels.  It will be won one police department at a time, and one 
geographic area at a time.
