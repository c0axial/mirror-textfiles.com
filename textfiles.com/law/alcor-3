_MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES_        
 
_INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS_      
 
     Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief based on the purported  
acts of the named defendants herein in executing a facially valid search  
warrant.  The assert that in executing the search warrant, defendants  
violated the provisions of the ECPA.  More specifically, plaintiffs  
allege that at some unspecified date prior to January 12, 1988,  
defendants procured from the Riverside County Superior Court a search  
warrant which authorized, in general, a search of the facilities of  
Alcor.  Plaintiffs assert, however, that the search warrant did not  
purport to reach, nor was it intended to reach any of plaintiffs E_Mail.   
Complaint [paragraph] 5. 

[footnote--Plaintiffs assert that E-Mail was the facilitation, sending  
and receipt of electronic mail via computerized modems.  Complaint, para 
4]  
 
Plaintiffs assert that pursuant to the search warrant, on January 12,  
1988, defendants searched Alcor's premises and removed a variety of items  
including the electronic media containing plaintiffs E-Mail.  Complaint  
[paragraph] 6.  Plaintiffs conclude by alleging that notwithstanding that  
defendants and each of the were informed that they had taken, along with  
materials described the warrant, E-Mail belonging to plaintiffs, that  
defendants herein knowingly and willfully (a) continued to access the  
electronic and magnetic media containing plaintiffs' E-Mail and (b) 
continued to deny access to plaintiffs to such E_Mail for many months  
although a demand was made for the return of said E-Mail.  Plaintiffs  
thus concluded that defendant's wrongful access and retention of  
plaintiffs' E-Mail was intentional within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.  
Section 2707, Complaint, paragraph 12.  
                                   
     Notwithstanding the allegations of plaintiffs' Complaint, it can be  
readily determined from a review of the search warrant attach thereto  
(see Attachment A) that defendants did not violate or exceed the specific  
terms of the search warrant order obtained by them prior to its execution  
at Alcor's premises.  This court should therefore determine that, as a  
matter of law, there has been no violation of the ECPA, and plaintiffs  
have failed to state a claim for relief, thus requiring a dismissal of  
the complaint as to all defendants.  Even if it were otherwise, the named  
defendants are entitled to dismissal on the basis of their good-faith  
reliance on a facially valid Riverside County Superior Court search  
warrant and thus, their good-faith reliance on that search warrant is a  
complete defense as to the instant action, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section  
2707(d)(1).  
 
[page 7] 
 
_LEGAL DISCUSSION_ 
 
THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS TO ALL NAMED DEFENDANTS 
BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM FOR RELIEF UNDER 
THE ECPA 
 
     Plaintiffs seek to pursue the instant civil action based on a  
purported violation of the ECPA of 1986.  Specifically, plaintiffs seek  
to pursue an action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 2707 which provides  
that a provider of electronic communication service, subscriber or  
customer of any such service aggrieved by any purported violation of this  
section my recover from any person or entity who knowingly or  
intentionally violates the Act.  Thus, plaintiffs assert that defendants  
knowingly and wilfully accessed electronic and magnetic media containing  
their E-Mail and continued to deny access to plaintiffs of such E-Mail  
even after a demand for return of said E-Mail had been made and that such  
seizure was not authorized by the specific terms of a Riverside County  
Superior Court search warrant which authorized, in general, a search of  
the facilities of Alcor Life Extension Foundation, which maintained  
facilities at its place of business to facilitate the sending and  
receiving of electronic mail via computerized modems and which electronic  
mail facility was utilized by plaintiffs in this case.  
 
     We note preliminarily that while plaintiffs seek to assert a  
violation of the ECPA they make no claim that defendants violated their  
Fourth Amendment rights to be free from illegal searches and seizures, in  
executing the search warrant in question.  Rather their claim is strictly  
based on a non-constitutional violation of their rights under the Act,  
based on their allegation that the search warrant did not purport to  
reach, nor was it intended to reach, any of their E-Mail.  
 
     Defendants submit that while plaintiffs are not required to allege 
any Fourth Amendment violation of rights in order to proceed with their  
ECPA cause of action, their failure to assert a Fourth Amendment  
violation is significant.  Here, the failure to make an allegation of  
Fourth Amendment violation is critical since it would appear that if the  
search warrant was facially valid and if defendants could not be said to  
have violated any of plaintiffs' Fourth amendment Rights, then this court  
should according find that no violation of the ECPA occurred.  It is  
submitted that the ultimate review of the search warrant, in terms of  
facial validity should be the same whether this court be guided by Fourth 
Amendment principles or the specific terms of the Act.  
 
     Turning to the search warrant which is included as attachment A to  
the complaint, it appears that it provided for a search of the premises  
at 12337 [wrong address] Doherty St. in the City and County of Riverside,  
apparently the address of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.  According  
to the search warrant authorization, a search was authorized by a judge  
of the Riverside Superior court for property and other items potentially  
used to commit a felony, property possessed with intent to commit a  
public offense and/or property tending to show that a felony had been  
committed.  The search warrant specifically authorized the search and  
potential seizure of                      

" 1.  All electronic storage devices capable of storing electronic data,  
including magnetic tapes, disc, (floppy or hard), and the complete 
hardware necessary to retrieve electronic data including CPU (Central  
Processing Unit), CRT (viewing screen), disk or tape drive(s), printer, 
software and service manuals for operation of the said computer, together 
with all hand written notes or printed material describing the operation 
of the computers.  (See Exhibit A - Search Warrant No. 1, property to be 
seized #1). 
  
  2. Human body parts identifiable as belonging to the deceased, Dora 
Kent;

  3. Narcotics, controlled substances and other drugs subject to 
regulation by the Drug Enforcement Administration."
                                                   
     From a reivew of the contents of the search warrant, and contrary to 
plantiffs' allegations in the complaint, it would appear that the 
purported seizure of electronic E-Mail was specifically authorized by 
paragraph 1 of the search warrant set out above.  That paragraph 
specifically permittted the seizure of all electronic storage devices 
capable of storing electronic data including magnetic tapes, discs and 
hardware necessary to retrieve electronic data.  As previously noted, 
since electronic mail is a type of communication which is typed into a  
computer terminals and potentially then stored in that computer system,  
the language of the warrant clearly should be found to cover the seizure  
that took place in this case.  

     Defendants have found no authority suggesting that a search warrant  
as specific as that found in the instant case, violates the requirements  
of particularly which would subject the warrant to a finding of  
invalidity.  Under California law, it is well settled that "The  
requirement of particularly is designed to prevent general exploratory  
searches which unreasonably interfere with a person's right to privacy. .  
. . [T]his requirement is held to be satisfied if the warrant imposes a  
meaningful restriction upon the objects to be seized."  _Burrows v.  
Superior Court_, 13 Cal.3d 283, 249 (1974).  As the California Supreme  
Court has observed in another instance, "nothing should be left to the  
discretion of the officer."  _People v. Dumas_, 9 Cal.3d 871, 880 (1973).   
As noted by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, while precise description  
of the items to be seized in accordance with a search warrant is not  
always possible, some specificity is required.  _U.S. v. McLaughlin_, 851  
F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir. 1988).  As required by the _McLaughlin_ case and  
the California authority previously cited, the search warrant  
specifically described the property to be seized and the specification  
imposed a meaningful restriction upon what objects would be taken by the  
police during the execution of the search.  Thus, since it would appear  
that the search warrant satisfied the particularity requirement of both  
state and federal law, no violation of plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights  
could be said to have occurred and, indeed, as noted above, no such  
allegation of violation of the constitutional rights is alleged.   
Assuming that the search warrant satisfies Fourth Amendment standards,  
there can be no legitimate polity reason asserted by plaintiffs which  
would permit this court to find that the search warrant did not comply  
with the specific terms of the ECPA.  In sum, since the specific terms of  
the search warrant may be found to have authorized the seizure of 
plaintiffs' E-Mail, this court should find that no proper claim for  
relief has been stated by the plaintiffs and the complaint should be 
ordered dismissed.  
                    
                      II
 
_EVEN IF THIS COURT WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE 
SEARCH WARRANT WAS TECHNICALLY DEFICIENT 
STILL DEFENDANTS ARE PROTECTED FROM SUIT BY 
DOCTRINE OF GOOD-FAITH RELIANCE  THUS, THE  
COMPLAINT SHOULD BE ORDERED DISMISSED ON THIS 
ADDITIONAL GROUND._ 
 
     Even if this Court were to find that a technical violation of the  
ECPA had occurred due to the seizure of plaintiffs' E-Mail in the instant  
case, defendants nevertheless would be entitled to dismissal of the  
action pursuant to the provision of 18 U.S.C. section 2707(d)(1) which  
provides a complete defense for good-faith reliance on a facially valid 
court warrant or order.  

[The cited section refers to warrants *for* email, and plaintiffs 
arguement is that deffendants had no such warrant.] 

    In the instant case, as explained in section I of this memorandum,  
defendants were in fact engaged in the execution of a facially valid  
search warrant.  Thus, under the circumstances, their conduct should be  
found to fall within the rule of good-faith reliance.  
 
    It should be noted that there are as yet no decisions interpreting  
the good-faith defense provided by the provisions of section 2707.   
However there is a significant body of case law regarding the doctrine of  
qualified immunity.  Thus, the doctrine of qualified immunity has been  
recognized to shield government employees from civil right suits and is  
available in that context unless the officials "knew or reasonably should  
have know that [his or her] action . . . would violate . . .  
constitutional right . . . . " _Harlow v. Fitzgerald_, 457 U.S. 800, 815  
(1982),  emphasis omitted.  In civil rights cases qualified immunity is  
available as a defense in three circumstances: (1)  If it is unclear at  
the time of the challenged acts that plaintiff had a constitutionally  
protected interest; (2) even if plaintiff has a constitutionally  
protected interest, it was unclear at the time whether an exception would  
be permitted; and (3) even if plaintiffs's rights were clearly  
delineated, qualified immunity is still available if was objectively  
reasonable for  defendant to feel that their acts did not violate  
plaintiff's constitutional rights.  _Robision v. Via_, 821 F.2d 913,  
920-921 (2d Cir. 1978); _Tomer v. Gates_, 811 f.2d 1240, 1242 (9th Cir.  
1987).  Further, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule has  
been found to be inapplicable only when a warrant is "so facially  
overbroad as to preclude reasonable reliance by the executing officers,"  
_U.S. v. Michaelian_, 803 F.2d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir. 1986), or when the 
officers do not act in good faith _U.S. v. Spilotro_, 800 f.2d 959,. 968 
(9th Cir. 1986)  
    
     In the instant case, defendants were entitled to good-faith immunity  
for a number of reasons.  First, as explained in the prior section of  
this memorandum, the search warrant was not so facially overbroad as to  
preclude reasonable reliance on its terms by the defendants herein.   
Moreover, it was not "clearly established" at the time of the events in  
this case that the seizure would somehow be found to be in violation of  
either the Forth Amendment or the specific terms of the ECPA of 1986.   
Defendants did not have the benefit of established precedent with respect  
to the doctrine of good-faith immunity as it applied to the specific  
terms of the federal Act.  Finally, in light of the specific language in 
the search warrant, this court should determine that it was objectively  
reasonable for defendants to conclude that seizure of the E-Mail was  
specifically authorized.  Here, there could have been at most no more  
than a technical violation in the execution of the search warrant and no  
prior precedent interpreting the specific terms of the statute.  These  
are precisely the circumstance in the good-faith immunity should be found  
to shield defendants form civil liability.  For this reason, too, the 
complaint should be dismissed.  
                                                            
[There is certainly an interesting Catch 22 in this reasoning.  The 
condition of having no precidents is being used as a reason to dismiss 
the case.  If all cases are dismissed on this basis, no precedent will 
ever be set!] 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
     For the forgoing reasons, defendants respectfully submit that this  
court should grant their motion to dismiss plaintiffs' action for  
violation of the ECPA since they have failed to plead an appropriate  
federal claim under this statue.  In the alternative, this court should  
find that the named defendants herein are entitled to good-faith immunity  
under the statue and, thus, the complaint should be dismissed for this 
reason as well.
