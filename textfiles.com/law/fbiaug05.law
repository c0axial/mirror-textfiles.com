               A NEW APPROACH TO FTO TRAINING

     Captain, High Point Police Department, North Carolina              
                                                           
                                                                  
     Prior to February 1989, the High Point, North Carolina, 
Police Department was using a traditional field training officer 
(FTO) program to supplement its academy training.  This program 
had been in place since the 1970s; however, despite a highly 
structured format, new recruits graduating from the program 
reflected inconsistent work habits and attitudes.  In addition, 
liability problems arose, as did concern for proper 
documentation, fairness, and doubts about the abilities of the 
FTOs themselves.                                           
       
     A close analysis determined that the central problem was a 
lack of consistency in the training methods used by field 
training officers.  Recruits leaving the regimented environment 
of the academy were being assigned to several ``mini-FTO'' 
programs throughout the Patrol Bureau, depending upon vacancies. 
Each of these units, though accountable to a central training 
authority, had its own definition as to proper FTO training 
methods.                                                          

     After considering many viable options, the department 
decided not to alter the FTO concept, but to continue its use 
with a new, highly centralized field training team.  This team 
would consolidate all FTO training  into  one unified approach to 
improve its management.  After its first year, the program's 
impact has been positive.  Such a team method is apparently 
unique from most traditional FTO systems and may not be 
applicable to all departments.                         

Traditional Field Training                                        

     Field training is a process by which officers receive formal 
instruction on the job.  Although all officers receive a thorough 
introduction to law enforcement subjects during basic training, 
they  cannot be expected to assume the full responsibilities of 
experienced police officers immediately following graduation from 
the academy.  Therefore, additional training is given to officers 
in the field where they can learn from others who have already 
gained practical police experience.                               

     In a typical FTO program, new recruits are assigned directly 
from the academy to ride with an FTO, usually a veteran officer 
who has volunteered for the position and who has received special 
training.  During a specified 3- to 6-month period, several FTOs 
train and document the skills and abilities of each recruit.  At 
the end of this time period, a formal review board decides 
whether to release the officer to work alone, return for more 
training or be terminated.                                     

High Point's Former FTO Program                                   

     All new recruits with the High Point Police Department must 
receive 694 hours of basic law enforcement training from 
in-house, State-certified instructors.  The new officers were 
then assigned to a 12- week FTO program, during which time they 
had three different FTO instructors.  Lateral entry officers also 
completed this process.                                           

     The department provided all FTOs with an FTO Recruit Officer 
Training Guide and required each FTO to submit a daily report and 
a weekly report.  The FTO also interviewed the recruits weekly to 
keep them fully aware of their progress.  A departmental training 
supervisor coordinated the staff and maintained all records of 
FTO training.                                                     

     During the 12 weeks, recruits were also assigned to other 
areas of the department, such as records, communications, and 
traffic to gain insight and hands-on experience.  For the final 3 
weeks, they accompanied the FTOs on their duties, serving as a 
plainclothes observer.  The process concluded with the recruit 
appearing before a formal review board.                      

Problems Encountered                                              

     Even though all FTOs used the same guidelines, procedures 
and report forms, newly assigned officers showed alarming 
inconsistencies.  From officer to officer, there were varying 
levels of 1) how well each could perform certain tasks and follow 
proper procedures; 2) how thoroughly each knew the various areas 
of the city; and 3) how thoroughly each had been taught by their 
FTOs.  Some FTOs rated more fairly than others, and some let poor 
performance slide.  Also, the police attorney voiced concerns 
that the department could be held liable for officers not 
receiving proper, standardized, on-the-job training after 
completing the basic academy course.                              

     The root of these problems appeared to be the organizational 
structure of the FTO program.  There was no quality control or 
command structure to assure uniformity.  The inconsistency 
resulted from having field training conducted by several 
different teams.  Although the departmental training supervisor 
was technically responsible for the program, team commanders 
established the guidelines for their respective teams. Selection 
and training of FTOs were not uniform, and standards varied from 
team to team.  In addition, many of the high standards 
established during the basic training were soon lost as the 
recruit was told ``how it is on this team.''                    

High Point's New FTO Program                                      

     In early 1989, a newly designed system consolidated all the 
field training teams into one.  The FTOs were assigned to the 
team based upon their ability to train new officers.  One 
commander and two supervisors were selected after special 
consideration for their experience, proven abilities and the 
examples they would set.  In High Point, patrol teams that do not 
serve a field training function consist of 1 commander, 2 
supervisors, and 13 officers.  However, the field training team 
consists of one commander, two supervisors, and nine FTOs.  The 
four remaining slots for officers are filled in peak periods by 
off-duty volunteers from other teams.                             

     When there are no recruits to train, the FTO team performs 
regular patrol functions.  The entire team also receives 
instruction in trainee evaluations and uniformity of departmental 
tasks, so that each trainee acquires the same information and 
instruction, creating a uniformly trained officer.  After 
completion of the FTO program, the new officers are assigned to 
one of the four regular patrol teams.  They then serve as 
functioning police officers, able to assume their duties and work 
alone.                                                         

The Impact                                                        

     The new program has corrected the deficiencies that were 
evident in the previous FTO system.  The FTO program is now 
tailored specifically to the department's requirements rather 
than to individual team practices.  Centralized recruit training 
enables closer liaison between the FTO team and the training 
division.  Now, uniform standards govern the FTO experience for 
all recruits.  In essence, each has the same opportunity to 
succeed.                                                          

     It is expected that this new program will continue to 
provide well-trained officers performing in a uniform manner, 
thereby minimizing departmental liability.  Individual and 
collective training deficiencies should also be more easily 
spotted and addressed.  Recruits will also be assured of exposure 
to all areas of the city and will, therefore, be available for 
patrol in any location.  Recruits themselves will have a more 
receptive learning environment because they will remain together 
for a longer period of time after the academy phase.  Thus, the 
retention period for new recruits should also be lengthened.      

The First 12 Months                                               

     During the first year of operation, 20 recruits completed 
the program  18 successfully finished, and two were dismissed. 
However, one negative aspect of the new FTO program became 
apparent, and that was the effect the program had on FTOs.  After 
training recruits for two straight sessions, the FTOs are 
approaching burnout.  And, finding officers to replace them has 
been difficult.  For the most part, top veteran officers are 
reluctant to volunteer for the FTO position because they believe 
they will be repeatedly assigned to the FTO team.  Therefore, to 
put a more positive spin on the FTO program, the department 
authorized special incentives.  FTOs receive a 5-percent pay 
increase while training new recruits, special ``off'' days after 
each assignment, and a special FTO ribbon to be worn on their 
uniform in recognition for their efforts.                  

Conclusion                                                        

     The High Point field training team approach has been very 
successful, despite its minor problems, and has proven itself to 
be a favorable setting for the FTO process.  It strengthens 
management and control of the program and further enhances what 
is a proven and important field training tool.
