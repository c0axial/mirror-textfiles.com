                CAMPUS POLICE:  A DIFFERENT VIEW

               Arlington Campus Police Department
                            
                                                                  
     The many campus police departments around the country are
made up of sworn officers with extensive basic and field
training.  They must meet the same requirements as other sworn
officers in the State, and they must continue to meet the
standards set forth by the governing law enforcement agency of
their particular State (in Texas, that agency is the Texas
Commission on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and
Education--TCLEOSE).

     Campus police officers deal with the same kinds of crimes
that affect the community outside the campus' boundaries,
including rape, robbery, and assault.  And, as in municipal,
county, or State law enforcement agencies, campus police
departments interact with the public on a daily basis, 52 weeks
a year, 7 days a week.  Still, campus police officers are
generally viewed in a different light than other officers.  Why
is this so?

     Primarily, the prevailing attitude is that "campus cops"
are little more than security guards, concerned more with
issuing parking citations than guarding against crime.  This
perception is not only unfair but it also does not reflect the
increased attention to crime control necessitated by sharply
rising crime rates on college campuses.  While campus police
departments confront serious criminal activity, and have primary
responsibility for the safety of large populations, campus
officers are often denied the respect afforded other officers,
both within and outside the law enforcement community.

CAMPUS POLICING                                                   

     Many campus communities are as large or larger than
municipal communities.  Most sprawl over several acres with
academic buildings miles apart.  In fact, a large college campus
is very much like a city in itself, requiring a law enforcement
presence far beyond the security guard stereotype.

     Like most campus departments, the University of Texas
Police Department has an Operation, Administration, Service, and
Investigation Bureau.  Traditional police services, such as
parking and traffic enforcement, fall within these categories.
In addition, other services are also provided, including shuttle
service for handicapped students and night escorts for students
working late on campus.

     Officers are called on to handle domestic disputes and
gang-related activities.  They work traffic accidents, often
involving injury, and they provide assistance to anyone working,
visiting, or residing on campus.

     In place of reserve officers, the department recruits
guards and public safety officers to assist with many
non-criminal situations that arise on campus.  These young men
and women are usually students considering a future in law
enforcement after college.

     Inservice training is an important part of any law
enforcement agency's agenda, and campus police departments are
no different.  In order to provide daily access to training
material, the University of Texas subscribes to the Law
Enforcement Television Network (LETN)--the national satellite
television network specifically developed for law enforcement
agencies to use in training their officers.

     In addition, like most municipal departments, the
University of Texas Police Department has a crime prevention
officer, a research and planning coordinator, and a training
coordinator.  We continually strive to improve our department
and further our ability to maintain a safe and peaceful learning
atmosphere.

CONCLUSION

     The modern college campus is not immune to criminal
activity.  In fact, serious crime problems affect many campuses
across the country.  Campus police departments are charged with
protecting students, visitors, and faculty in an increasingly
unsettled and violent environment.  Still, although campus
police officers must deal with crimes of almost every type,
there is a reluctance to accept them as "real officers."  In
fact, one candidate for a position with our department recently
admitted that he wanted to come to our department first before
he "went out into the real world."

     It is becoming increasingly evident that with regard to
crime, college campuses do possess all the elements of the real
world.  Those responsible for ensuring the safety of those on
campus, then, should be afforded the same respect given to any
law enforcement officer.
