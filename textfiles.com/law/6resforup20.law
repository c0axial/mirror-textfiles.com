                   MCGRUFF ROBOT TEACHES KIDS                    
       (RESULTS OF A SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI, PILOT PROGRAM)                  

                                                                  
     Once considered a science fiction fantasy, robots are now
becoming an integral part of the instructional curriculum in
some schools.  A growing body of knowledge suggests that
children learn more readily when they are allowed to manipulate
concrete objects before moving to abstract concepts. (1)  The
use of robots is well-suited for engaging children with a
tangible object that reinforces positive concepts and ideas.

     Three elementary schools in Springfield, Missouri, were
chosen as sites for an innovative program that includes a
robotic version of McGruff, the crime dog.  In the program,
McGruff, assisted by a police officer, delivers safety messages
to children and interacts with them in order to convey a
positive safety theme.  The results, gauged by a survey
conducted in three of the participating schools, have proved the
program's effectiveness.

THE ROBOT

     The McGruff robot is approximately 4 feet tall and weighs
60 pounds.  Every effort has been madf''fe to give the robot human
traits.  The computerized interior is hidden by clothing, the
arms move up and down, the head rotates, the eyelids open and
shut, and the mouth can be manipulated by remote control to
indicate various facial expressions and to give the appearance
of speech.  The actual voice is that of the operator, via a
two-way wireless system that allows the robot to appear to
listen and respond to questions and comments from the audience.
Speakers are mounted on the robot's legs.  In addition to the
remote voice, a cassette player is also mounted in the robot so
that various safety jingles and other messages can be played.

THE SURVEY

     Two hundred and ninety-one elementary students who
participated in the McGruff Program at three elementary schools
were surveyed.  The majority (230) were 7- or 8-year-old
children in the second grade.  Forty-eight students surveyed
were 9 years of age.

     The questionnaire consisted of 14 close-ended questions
concerning McGruff's appearance and the message the robot
presented.  The students were asked to respond on a 5-point
Likert scale from "yes" to "no" with responses of "somewhat,"
"maybe," and "a little" as options between the two extremes.

     Examples of survey questions include:  "McGruff and the
police officer have helped me understand how to prevent crime";
"I will do what McGruff says so that I will be safe"; and "I
want McGruff to come back and visit my school again."  Other
questions asked students to rank what they liked most/least
about the robot.

     Two hundred and thirty-two (80 percent) of the students
said they liked to listen to McGruff.  Eighty-five percent said
they understood McGruff's message about avoiding drugs and
strangers.  Seventy-seven percent responded that McGruff's safety
message was factual, credible, and provided information in a
straight-forward manner.

     Two hundred and sixty-three students (90 percent) believed
McGruff and the officer effectively explained the consequences
of being careless about safety.  Almost 80 percent (232
students) believed that McGruff made the police officer's
message clearer and easier to understand.

     The majority of the children (88 percent) believed that
McGruff sincerely cares about them, and 91 percent of the
students responded that they were not afraid of the robot.  In
fact, 86 percent expressed a desire to have McGruff return for
another visit.

     When asked what they did not like about the robot, the
majority (54 percent) of students said there was nothing they
did not like.  Fourteen percent said that if they had to choose
something to improve, it would be the robot's clothing.

     Significantly, when general positive and negative reactions
were cross-tabulated, it became apparent that younger students
were more receptive to the McGruff robot.  Half of the 7 year
olds demonstrated affection to the robot by hugging him; only 13
percent of the 9 year olds were willing to hug the robot.
Forty-two percent of the 7 and 8 year olds said they were not
afraid of the robot, while a significantly lower number (15
percent) of the 9 year olds responded that they were not afraid.

CONCLUSION

     This survey, while admittedly focused on students from one
geographic/social perimeter (a midwest, midsize city),
reinforces earlier research that indicates students absorb more
information concerning abstract concepts when tangible objects
are used to instruct.  Because the McGruff robot is a familiar
symbol of safety to children, he is an ideal "teacher" to
reinforce positive themes concerning crime, safety, and the
dangers of drug abuse.

     While children watch and listen to McGruff and the officer,
they internalize positive safety messages, whether consciously
or subconsciously.  The jingles are infectious and easy to
remember.  Combining words, music, and actions, the robot
reinforces important messages that not only help children to
make correct choices but also help to instill a positive
foundation concerning safety and crime.
