May 1990                                                          
                                                                  
                     POLICE PRACTICES 1                                  
                         ELDERWATCH                                       
                                   
                               
     In the summer of 1986, because of a substantial increase in 
the number of crimes directed against the elderly, officers of 
the Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Department met with various citizens 
groups to discuss possible solutions to this problem.  Another 
area of concern expressed at these meetings was the fact that 
many elderly citizens were not receiving the help they needed 
because they lacked the information and resources to assist 
themselves.  As a result, the Tulsa Police Department, in 
conjunction with several community service agencies, initiated 
Elderwatch, a program designed specifically for Tulsa's elderly 
citizens.                                                         

     The goal of Elderwatch is to reduce crimes committed against 
the elderly and provide community services to improve their 
quality of life and to reduce their fear of crime.  In order to 
reach the senior population, police officers and community 
service representatives visit the elderly in their homes, 
informing them of the program and what services are available to 
them.                                                   

ORIENTATION
                                                       
     Prior to initiating the program, the Tulsa Senior Services 
Outreach Agency, one of the community services group active in 
Elderwatch, sponsored a 2-day seminar for police officers to 
inform them of the available services and how to contact these   
services.  The officers were also advised of the emotional and 
psychological aspects of aging that may affect the ways in which 
the elderly interact with others.                            

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION                                          

     Once the orientation was completed, the police department 
issued a press release to notify the public of the program's 
existence.  The press release was also a means to advise senior 
citizens of the program's purpose and to inform them of the 
upcoming visits by police officers and community service 
representatives.                                                  

     Then, police officers and volunteers set out on a 
door-to-door canvass of neighborhoods and apartment complexes 
having a high concentration of senior citizens.  By going door to 
door, they were able to assess the living conditions of the 
elderly to determine if they were being neglected, exploited, or 
abused.  They were also able to determine if an elderly citizen 
was in need of a particular service that was readily available 
through one of the various citizens groups.                       

     In addition, the canvassers voluntarily offered to check the 
security of each residence, as well as to provide crime 
prevention tips.  Through donated funds, they were able to see to 
it that deadbolt locks and other security devices were installed 
in those residences lacking the necessary security measures, if 
the senior citizen so desired.                                    

     Officers conduct the canvass in uniform, driving marked 
patrol units.  Also, they are the ones who initiate conversations 
with the elderly; volunteers accompany the officers to help them 
answer questions and fill out forms.  If an elderly person is 
found to have a specific problem, the officer or volunteer makes 
a notation on a preprinted checklist and then turns this form 
into the Elderwatch coordinator at the conclusion of the canvass.  

     It is the coordinator's responsibility to contact the 
appropriate agency and also to check back with the individual at 
a later date to ensure that any problem encountered has been 
resolved.  The coordinator also forwards all Elderwatch reports 
to the police communications center and records the number of 
persons contacted and the number of referrals made.         

ELDERWATCH FORMS                                                  

     To complement the Elderwatch Program, the Tulsa Police 
Department developed a database to record information submitted 
voluntarily by senior citizens.  Along with basic personal 
information (name, address, telephone number), the forms record 
the names of the individual's doctors and the hospitals with 
which they are associated; any chronic illnesses; and the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of nearest relatives or 
neighbors and whether they have a key to the residence.  The 
individual is also asked to note any assistance received from a 
social service agency.                                            

     These Elderwatch forms are either filled out by the police 
officer or volunteer during the door-to-door canvass or left with 
the individual to be mailed later to the police department. The 
completed forms are sent to the police department's 
Communications Division so that the information can be entered 
into the Computer Aided Dispatching System.  Once entered into 
the database, this information can be retrieved and then provided 
to emergency service personnel if they are  called to the 
residence to render assistance.                            

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT                                          

     Recognizing it is impossible to reach everyone who needs 
assistance through a neighborhood canvass, a utility company 
offered to distribute over 4,000 ElderWatch forms with payment 
notices.  Also, the forms, accompanied with a pamphlet 
explaining the program, were left at locations where the elderly 
frequent, such as churches, community centers, and nutrition 
sites.                                                            

     Use of the media can keep the entire community informed of 
the program and gain support for it.  Media coverage can generate 
an interest that would be difficult to achieve by any other 
means.                                                            

     It is also important for the police department to develop a 
good working relationship with those agencies providing services 
to the elderly.  Not only do they provide the materials for the 
information packages distributed to the elderly, but they offer 
invaluable assistance to officers when dealing with a specific 
problem that affects the elderly.                           

CONCLUSION                                                      

     In every American city, no matter what the size, there is a 
segment of the elderly community that is in need of assistance.  
The Elderwatch Program, with its neighborhood canvasses, 
community involvement, and media coverage, helps the police 
department address the daily needs of many of Tulsa's elderly. 
The program has been able to give them a better quality of life 
by reducing crime and making them more secure in their homes and 
their neighborhoods.
