                    Detective Robert P. Meiners                            
             Lincolnwood, Illinois, Police Department                          
                                                                  
     Store diversion burglaries have plagued retailers across the 
United States for many years.  These crimes occur when 
offenders, acting in concert with one another, remove valuables 
from commercial establishments while employing diversionary 
tactics. It is estimated that retail losses due to such thefts 
have totaled between $2-3 million within the past 15 years. (1)
   
OFFENDER CHARACTERISTICS                                          

     According to police intelligence information, a core group 
of offenders migrated from Canada and settled in the Chicago 
area.  Members of the group, who have identified themselves as 
Yugoslavian gypsies, are men and women of all ages, even 
children.  These individuals have dark complexions, with dark 
hair and eyes.  As a result owners and managers of victimized 
businesses frequently describe them as Mexican or Hispanic.       

     Members of the group use several aliases and dates of birth 
in an attempt to create confusion and hinder proper 
identification if arrested or stopped for questioning.  Although 
they are most frequently identified with store diversion 
burglaries, there is documentation that they have become 
criminally active in passport fraud, fraud against insurance 
companies, robberies, residential burglaries, and drug 
trafficking in recent years.                                   

TRAVEL PATTERNS                                                   

     These individuals travel extensively throughout the United 
States as a group, employing their criminal expertise; all but 
eight States (2) have reported monetary losses attributed to them. 
While committing a crime, they will use as many as 12 vehicles, 
usually large, luxury cars, and up to 30 people at one time.  The 
vehicles are equipped with citizen band radios and cellular 
phones, and in most cases, have legally issued license plates. 
However, at times, the license plates have been switched, bent, 
obliterated, or removed to prevent or inhibit identification.     

      These offenders will also fly commercial airliners to their 
destinations and then rent cars, which they will return to a 
different airport.  For example, in 1986, a group flew from 
Chicago to Los Angeles, where they rented vehicles.  After 
committing several diversion burglaries of large department 
stores in California and Oregon, they abandoned the cars at the 
San Francisco airport and then flew back to Chicago.          

TACTICS EMPLOYED                                                  

     Once a business has been targeted, the females of the group, 
who are responsible for committing the burglary, usually enter 
first.  These women are dressed in colorful long skirts and tops 
and usually carry no purse.  The men, typically dressed in casual 
western wear, then follow the women into the establishment.  
These men are often accompanied by children who assist with the 
diversion.                                                        

     The diversion begins when the women attempt to confuse store 
employees by asking nonsensical questions.  For example, in a 
California case, an offender asked for ``beer without yeast'' 
and for chickens that could be stuffed with steak.  In Milwaukee, 
WI, one female subject asked the clerk where the dietetic baby 
food was kept and then insisted that the clerk personally 
accompany her to the location.  In another Wisconsin grocery 
mart, a female offender distracted a store employee for several 
minutes by constantly inquiring about the contents of a jar of 
beef sticks, asking if they were pork chops.                      

     Some offenders feign illness and threaten police action if 
clerks and/or managers do not assist them.  They have also 
pretended to be store workers who will lead legitimate customers 
away from the area where the valuables (usually cash and jewelry) 
are being removed.                                                

     Shoplifting is occasionally used as a deliberate diversion 
tactic to lure the manager from the office area where the safe is 
located.  And in extreme cases, female offenders have exposed 
private body parts in an attempt to stop store employees, who 
have discovered a burglary in progress, from calling the police. 
 
     While these distractions are taking place, other members of 
the group seek out safes, money pouches, or rear storage areas 
where valuables are kept.  In one particular case involving a 
jewelry store, a clerk was asked to clean and gift wrap some very 
expensive stemware, engaging all employees in the store to make 
the sale.  While the clerk was doing this, all the valuables in 
the display cases were removed.  The offenders then advised store 
personnel that they would return later with payment and exited 
the store.  Only after they left was the jewelry discovered 
missing.                                                          

     These offenders will also make very small purchases with 
large denomination bills.  This forces the clerk to hand over a 
substantial amount of change, enabling offenders to discover 
where the larger amounts of store cash are kept.           

TARGETS                                                           

     The size of the establishment, or the type of business, is 
inconsequential, as along as valuables are present.  Small 
markets, large stores, and even shopping malls have been 
targeted.  The offenders have also ``hit'' the same chain store 
at different locations on the same day after learning the layout 
and security of the stores.  The pattern for this type of offense 
is to strike as many stores as possible in a particular area, 
often crossing jurisdictional boundaries.                         

     Oftentimes, store losses will not be discovered for hours or 
days after the crime has been committed.  In some cases, store 
employees have even been accused of committing the crime, because 
store managers often mistake the crimes committed by groups using 
diversionary tactics with employee theft.                 

POLICE/PROSECUTOR STRATEGIES                                      

     The best evidence is a video tape of the event. Absent this, 
known offender photographs are the next best resource in 
attempting to build a case.                                       

     If an agency is successful in making an arrest, one 
individual, always a male group member, will come forward to act 
as a spokesman for the offenders and will usually offer 
restitution in lieu of prosecution.  When faced with the prospect 
of making an identification in the store, owners and employees, 
who actually did not see the crime being committed, opt for 
restitution, which frees the victim from court appearances.       

     The criminal case itself may be fundamentally weak since, in 
all probability, there were several group members present when 
the offense occurred and little or no evidence as to who actually 
took the valuables.  In such instances, police and prosecuting 
attorneys, faced with the prospect of a weak case, may also favor 
restitution.  This, at least, identifies the offenders and 
returns the property to its rightful owner.  However, since many 
stores are targeted in the area, and cases of store diversion 
burglaries are not prosecuted, restitution amounts to simply 
little more than the price of doing business for these offenders.  

     Prosecution can be problematic because no two jurisdictions 
prosecute cases alike, considering the fact that these offenders 
attack numerous stores in a given area.  Additionally, when faced 
with the prospect of jail, offenders have left the jurisdiction. 
With their adeptness for using aliases, these offenders remain 
undetected for long periods of time, and in some cases, 
completely avoid apprehension.                                    

     On a positive note, however, some jurisdictions have been 
successful in prosecuting these offenders by building a case 
based on the group's collective activity or standard method of 
operation.  Other options employed by affected jurisdictions may 
include Federal charges, such as Interstate Flight to Avoid 
Prosecution, as the offenders travel across the United States.  
In some instances, local or Federal racketeering statutes may be 
applied on a Federal level or locally if the jurisdiction has a 
similar statute.                                                  

     The following recommendations may be helpful in apprehending 
and prosecuting these criminals:                                  

     *  Verify identity of offenders through FBI fingerprint checks 
        and FBI number                                          
          
     *  Educate local retailers as to the methods used in store 
        diversion burglaries                                              

     *  Ensure all restitution agreements are made after the arrest 
        or indictment                                                     

     *  Photograph and fingerprint all suspects, even if the case is 
        too weak for prosecution and/or restitution is accepted           

     *  Create a clearinghouse within each State for this type of 
        information and a nationwide network to exchange it               

     *  Enact or use existing RICO statutes to prosecute these 
        cases, if this type of crime is considered the work of an 
        organized criminal enterprise                                     

     *  Update information on the ever-changing tactics of these 
        criminals and circulate among the widest law enforcement 
        audience possible                                       

CONCLUSION                                                        

     Due to the mobility of these criminals and their stealth and 
teamwork in committing store diversion burglaries, law 
enforcement will have to devise creative strategies to deal with 
them.  Patrol officers responding to the crime scene should be 
well informed about this type of crime so that they can gather 
critical evidence and witness statements.  Follow-up 
investigators must know where to obtain information and 
assistance in order to bring these cases to a successful 
conclusion.  Law enforcement managers must ensure that 
information derived concerning this type of activity is shared 
and disseminated to the widest law enforcement audience possible.  

     Store diversion burglary is becoming a common problem in the 
United States.  Law enforcement must be aware of its elements, 
must develop strategies to police and prosecute these crimes, and 
must act aggressively in the pursuit of these strategies.
