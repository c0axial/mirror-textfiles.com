     The ability to analyze is very important in law 
enforcement.  Every investigator uses analytical ability on the 
job daily--from the investigation of a single traffic accident to 
the most complex fraud and money laundering schemes.  Analytical 
ability is what makes a good investigator.                        

     This article provides a look at the philosophy, environment, 
and pitfalls of teaching intelligence analysis within law 
enforcement.  It explores curricula now available and the need to 
develop more advanced courses.  The article also calls for the 
institution of professional standards for intelligence analysts, 
including specific training topics.                             

THE FIELD OF INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS                                

     Investigators have always used analysis while performing 
their jobs, but not with the disciplined procedures that 
characterize a professional analyst.  In most investigations, 
which are reactive by nature, analysis is done on a case-by-case 
basis.  Yet, a systematic analytical approach requires adherence 
to accepted, fundamental principles and techniques, most of which 
are learned or assimilated over time.  The ability to develop a 
structured, systematic approach is the hallmark of an 
intelligence analyst.                                             

     The field of intelligence analysis has grown enormously in 
recent years.  As a result, there is increasing focus on complex 
crimes, particularly in the area of drug enforcement, strategy 
development, and the need to analyze varying types of data.  Only 
a decade ago, a handful of law enforcement agencies employed 
trained analysts; now, analysts can be found in even small 
departments.  Even so, analysis is not so entrenched in the law 
enforcement profession that it is taught to every recruit at the 
police academy.  It is, however, offered in nearly every State in 
various training settings.                                        

     The Federal law enforcement community has influenced the 
development of law enforcement intelligence analysis.  The 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms (ATF) have even created a series of job titles and 
career paths for analysts.                                        

     The FBI National Academy Program offers instruction in 
intelligence analysis to participants during their training at 
the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.  ATF encouraged and 
supported the beginnings of the only professional association for 
analysts, the International Association of Law Enforcement 
Intelligence Analysts (IALEIA), which opened its membership in 
1981.  The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has sponsored 
conferences enabling the various projects to exchange experiences 
and build on each agency's success.  Other Federal agencies 
employ analysts, as do State agencies such as the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) and the Illinois State 
Police.                                                           

     Federally funded Regional Information Sharing System (RISS) 
projects, which provide support to over 2,000 agencies 
nationwide, also played a significant role in promoting 
intelligence analysis.  RISS projects created computerized 
analytical software for specific types of analysis (1) and offered 
these services to its members.  Under this system, agencies could 
forward data to the appropriate project.  The data was then 
entered, analyzed, and compiled into a finished report. 
Additionally, some RISS projects taught analysis to member agency 
personnel.  As a result, line investigators passed on the 
techniques to others.                                 
            
     Several agencies also developed analytical training in the 
public sector.  Many of these agencies are associated with the 
Federal Government or the RISS projects.  While most of the 
analytical classes cover basic information, a few advanced 
courses address such areas as computer-aided analysis, complex 
financial case analysis, and strategic analysis.                  

     The success of intelligence analysis courses suggests that 
there is a market for analytical intelligence training.  However, 
the courses offered are basic and reflect little initiative in 
developing alternative models.  One reason is that agencies have 
opted to modify the basic training wheel, rather than redesign 
it, mainly because of lack of time and expertise.  This means 
that analytical training capabilities remain rudimentary and do 
not advance the science of intelligence analysis in law 
enforcement.                                                

ANALYSIS IN ACADEMIA                                              

     All colleges and universities offer analytical courses, such 
as statistical, financial and market analysis, and most mandate  
a minimum number of analytical course credits within the degree 
program.  However, few colleges offer courses in intelligence 
analysis, and even fewer have courses in law enforcement 
analysis.  Even so, the law enforcement analytical courses that 
do exist usually focus on the use of intelligence analysis, not 
on how to analyze.  As a result, when law enforcement agencies 
look for analytical candidates, they generally look for people 
with degrees in political or social science and strong research 
skills.                                                   

ANALYTICAL COURSE DEVELOPMENT                                     

     Developing any course curriculum is a time-consuming 
process, and analytical courses are no exception. Minimal 
research material is available, and there are no textbooks to use 
as a basis for course formation.  As a result, most instructors 
must begin from ground zero.  Therefore, the first step in 
developing a course is to examine the components, i.e, 
definitions, steps, examples, and practical exercises.            

Definitions                                                       

     Within the intelligence field, definitions have long been a 
point of contention.  Everyone seems to make up definitions to 
suit individual needs, and most of these definitions are not 
written down.  While there have been attempts to define key areas 
of analysis, there is rampant disagreement, (2) as can be expected.  

Steps                                                             

     When formulating an analysis course, step-by-step 
instruction should be provided.  This reduces the procedure to 
its most basic components, increases the likelihood of 
comprehension, and provides a basis for future reference.        

Examples                                                          

     Actual samples of analytical products are not only 
impressive but are also informative.  Ideally, an intelligence 
analysis course should include fictitious or sanitized examples 
of every method/product taught.                               

Practical Exercises                                               

     People learn best by doing.  Considering that analytical 
concepts are hard to teach and difficult to learn, 
authentic-appearing case material should be used during course 
instruction.  Many practical exercises can translate the concept 
of analysis into the investigator's stock-in-trade  solving 
cases.                                                        

PITFALLS OF TEACHING ANALYSIS                                     

     There are four general pitfalls in teaching intelligence 
analysis.  They are:                                              

     *  Using someone else's material,                               

     *  Being too technical,                                         

     *  Not being able to respond to questions, and                  

     *  Creating training programs that are too specialized.         
     
     Each needs to be considered when teaching an analytical 
intelligence course.                                         

Using Someone Else's Material                                     

     This pitfall is perhaps the most dangerous, since there are 
so few sources that can be used in analytical training.  Also, 
developing training modules is difficult and time-consuming; so 
borrowing another's material has become a common practice.        

     Yet, using another's course curriculum keeps individual 
experiences from being incorporated into the training, which 
helps to explain ideas and techniques.  This also prohibits an 
instructor from truthfully answering the question most often 
asked in the analytical classroom, ``Why did (or didn't) you do 
it that way?''  If the ``it'' referenced is an example or answer 
an instructor did not create, the instructor can either make up 
an answer or admit ignorance.  But, too many ``I don't know'' 
answers may have negative consequences.                       

Being Too Technical                                               

     Because intelligence analysis is a very technical field, it 
is important to explain the subject matter in the simplest terms 
possible.  Instructors should speak to the audience as a whole, 
not direct the lecture to one or two technically oriented 
students who may ask questions frequently.  It may be necessary 
to cover certain concepts and techniques more than once.  What is 
important is that everyone thoroughly understands and comprehends 
the topics covered.                                               

     The presentation should be designed for the audience at 
hand.  Investigators are generally the least technical, but most 
practical, while managers and analysts usually have a greater 
tendency to use details and speak abstractly.  However, all 
instruction should be as simple as possible.  The goal is to have 
the students learn intelligence analysis.                    

Responding to Questions                                           

     The nightmare of all instructors is not being able to 
respond adequately to questions.  Using original materials helps 
to decrease the likelihood that this nightmare will occur. 
However, an instructor who teaches a course only a few times a 
year can forget to cover certain details.  To prevent this, 
materials should be thoroughly reviewed a few days before the 
class begins.                                           

Specialized Training                                              

     At present, a limited number of advanced analytical courses 
are offered in the United States because there is a limited 
audience for such training, making it not cost effective.  For 
the most part, those who take analytical courses are not 
analysts; they are more interested in an overview of the concepts 
and techniques, not in details.  In addition, structured courses 
for experienced analysts may only be offered a few times a year. 
Therefore, time spent in course development may never be recouped 
in terms of the number of persons taught, particularly on the 
local or State level.                                             

     The answer might be in forming advanced classes through the 
cooperation of Federal agencies, programs such as RISS, or a 
national consortium of analytical experts.  This would allow more 
advanced classes to be available over a wider area  and  to  a  
greater  number  of participants.                               

THE FUTURE                                                        

     It is clear that analysis will continue as a necessary 
component of criminal investigation in the future.  It is also 
clear that computerization will not take the place of the 
analyst, but instead will create a greater demand for more 
complex analysis.  However, if analytical intelligence 
instruction is to reach its potential, there are several areas 
that must be addressed.  These include developmental support, the 
training of analytical instructors, the development of new models 
and curricula in computerized analysis, and emerging analytical 
techniques.                                             

Developmental Support                                             

     There is little support to rely on in the area of analytical 
training development.  Articles, chapters, books, or monographs 
depicting practitioners' methods are scarce.  A few instructors 
exchange training manuals informally or permit one another to 
borrow teaching modules.  Unfortunately, there is no formal 
structure designed to assist in the development of training 
through a professional organization or agency.              

Training Analytical Instructors                                   

     Outside of one private company that trains its own faculty, 
there is no organization that educates analysts on how to become 
analytical instructors.  As a result, there are very few 
qualified analysis instructors in the United States generally 
available for teaching in multiagency settings.  One  solution 
may be to form an intelligence analysis faculty in order to teach 
others to become analytical instructors.                         

Developing New Models                                             

     New models for providing analytical training should be 
encouraged.  One particular model--definition, how-to steps, 
practical exercises--is effective at the introductory level but 
not at the more advanced level.  The case-long practex model, 
developed in the training course ``Advanced Analytical 
Training,'' (3) could be used in various scenarios, such as drugs 
and the infiltration of legitimate businesses.  However, other 
models also should be designed.                          

Computerized Analysis                                             

     The field of computerized analysis has opened new areas of 
expertise and potential courses.  Currently, classes are limited 
to database applications for toll records, event flow, or network 
analysis.  Artificial intelligence in which computerized data are 
flagged based on certain elements is a solid tool for targeting 
criminals and helping to predict criminal activity.  Agencies 
with such programs in use should develop applicable training 
courses.                                                   

DEVELOPING STANDARDS                                              

     The International Association of Law Enforcement 
Intelligence Analysts (IALEIA) has called for institution of 
standards for analysts.  In fact, the IALEIA's Standards and 
Accreditation Committee, first formed in Florida, was able to 
have standards adopted there.  However, further efforts toward 
standardization have encountered obstacles, mainly because of the 
myriad of position classifications used for analysts.  Some 
analysts are sworn police personnel, others are civilian.  Some 
perform a quasi-clerical function, while others are 
management-oriented strategic planners.                           

     Some analysts view their jobs merely as stepping stones to 
investigative work; others look at it as a step toward computer 
software development positions.  But few remain analysts for more 
than 3 or 4 years, and few receive advanced training, develop 
training, or write in the field.  In short, not all analysts are 
committed to analysis as a profession for the long term.  This 
lack of commitment helps explain the lack of advanced analysis 
and standards.  It also does little to foster the goal of IALEIA 
to promote high standards of professionalism in analysis.    

CONCLUSION                                                        

     This article has detailed the support, or the lack of 
support, for analytical intelligence training.  Several agencies 
have, in fact, devoted time and personnel to analysis 
instruction.  As a result, hundreds of law enforcement agencies 
have benefited.  However, analytical intelligence training needs 
more support.                                                     

     Adequate support for the use of analysis within law 
enforcement will only come through the education of managers, 
investigators, prosecutors, and analysts.  Unfortunately, a vast 
majority of agencies in the United States still do not realize 
how analysis can help them.                                       

     Analysis is a subject worth exploring, but law enforcement 
will only fully accept it when it becomes a routine part of the 
teaching curricula and standard operating procedures.  To achieve 
this, each analyst must help to persuade the law enforcement 
community that professional analysis is necessary and vital to 
law enforcement's mission.  Only through standardization and the 
cultivation of dedicated analysts will analysis as a profession 
receive the acclaim it so rightly deserves.
