11/10/90

Preface:

	In today's world there are many reasons to avoid the long arm of the law.  This holds true for some individuals (myself included) more than others.  This file will serve as a correction for many of the floating misconceptions abound regarding the legality and logistics of police persuit and evasion.  When reading this file regard it as a ballast, a tool to make the odds of a persuit weigh in your favor, not as guide to procedure.  As a side note, I (the author) do not encourage flight from law enforcement.  Nor do I encourage obstruction of justice as a rule or a practice.  It is not my intent to premote resisting arrest by duely appointed law enforcement officals or evading the consequences of crimes major or minor.  

I - Vehicular Persuit.

	A:  Sould I initiate a persuit?

	The movies are the worst source of misconceptions and misgivings regarding car to car persuit.  In any given cop/criminal plot there is without a doubt, a car chase.  The important thing to remember is that the drivers of said cars are trained professionals who have only as few chances to start all over again as miles of film the producer has purchased  Rember also the the entire chase scene is planned.  Of interest here is the fact that in any given car chase scene there are anywhere from 4 to 5 sets of rubber skid marks on the path before the cars roar by.  Obviously those are the 4 to 5 takes before the one you are watching where one driver or the other fucked up.  You have no such luxurys.  In the event you crash, there is no car depot from which you obtain another car and start over; hence the margin for error is almost nil.  
	Given such circumstances, the first question you must ask yourself is 
"Is it worth it for me to run?"  "Will the consequences behind my capture now be vicious enough for me to flee?"  It comes quickly to light, that unless there are some outstanding reasons, persuit is the unfavorable choice.  Reasons that I might justify a persuit with are as follows:

1.  Driving a stolen car with little or no ambiguity to ownership.
	Stiff sentences await car theives, if there is little or no chance that you
	will get away with bullshitting the officer who stops you, take off.

2.  Car contains blatently visable and unambigious stolen property.
	30 hot VCR's in the back seat?  Along with the tools you stole em 	with? Run.

3.  Long criminal record with various unserved warrents.
	Unless the warrents are for traffic violations, it's time to go.

	Ok, here it is, the moment of truth.  The red and blue lights are behind you and it's clear that the cop wants YOU.  Always evaluate the situation, how much does the officer know about me, what am I being stopped for?  Is there reason for the officer to be stopping me?  
	If you have be involved in illicit activites and find yourself being stopped by a car for little or no reason, assume the worst.  Assume the officer knows something about what you have done and will attempt to score an arrest.  Likewise if you are stopped by a 2 man car, assume that this is with the intent of taking you prisoner, it is unlikely that a 2 man car will stop for traffic violations unless said violations are very blatent.  Two man cars are rarely used for traffic patrols.  
	Likewise, look for signs that the officer knows little or nothing about you.  If you feel you might have a decent chance of bullshitting the cop, or if he/she looks like a dense sort, go ahead and pull over.  Getting the cop out of his/her car while you are still in yours is a huge tatical advantage.  If you allow yourself to be stopped, watch your advarsary carefully.  How does he or she approach your car?  Casually?  Is the officer tidying up his or her uniform?  Does the officer close the car door after exiting?  All these are indications that you are not considered a major threat.  If the officer moves to stop his car in front of yours, you are in for it, it is unlikely that this maneuver would be attempted if you were not a suspect.  
	Before you stop, examine the surroundings, plan a path, which direction will you go?  Where will your first turn be?  Will you be able to make the turn at high speed?  Are there any other officers around?  Is the area highly populated?  
	When you stop do so cautiously, put yourself in a position to flee, but not obviously.  Perhaps stop before a U-Turn area, or near a highway exit.  When you stop do so slowly.  Put your turn signal on, slow down gradually, give yourself the best chance and the most time to take in your surroundings.  Above all be calm.  
	Do not shut your engine off, depending on the car you are driving, it is likely he/she will not even notice.  Do not shift your car into park, instead elect for neutral, this will make your initial flight easier to begin.  Do not however, stand on the brake, the brakelights will remind the officer that you are stepping on a peddle and your feet are in position.  Try putting on your hazards to offset this effect if you're on a hill.  Roll your window down halfway, don't give the officer the opportunity to grab you.  If the officer passes the unconcerned about you test, go ahead and let him or her approach the car.  
	Before giving your license, ask what it was that you did.  Even better ask what it was you did while "looking" for your license.  Do your best to obtain some explanation.  Most cops will not bother with the license formality if you are a major suspect so take a request for your license as a good sign.  
	At this point if you have any outstanding warrents, you must devise some method of avoiding the surrender of your license.  It is wise to memorize the statistics of an aquantence who looks something like you at this point.  If you have done so you may claim you lost your license and pose as said aquantence.  "You" will be called in, checked for warrents and license validity and then issued a "Failure to produce" ticket.  Most of the time if you produce no wallet at all it is more effective.  "I must have left it in my other jeans, DAMN!"  Depending on the cop, you may be asked to accompany him to his car where he can fill out everything on you.  This is one of the rare times that being asked to leave the car is a good sign, take all other "please step out of the car" threats as just that, threats.  If you do not have some alternate means of identification or have not memorized a "friends" statistics, it is time to flee.  Do not assume that the outstanding warrent will not appear over the radio, chances are, it will.  No offense, but on the whole I have noticed that police women have something to prove.  Give them a little more leeway.  Call it the bitch factor.  They tend to be a bit more aggressive, especially if you're male.
	Should I flee?
	When you make this decision, you must consider the tatically best time to begin to flee.  

	Fleeing from roadside stop:

	If you are pulled over and decide that you're in for it, wait till the cop on foot gets about to your rear bumper and then take off.  That position is perfect because it puts the officer too far to get a good facial description and to near to get back to the squad quickly.  Remeber that before you were pulled over a brief but revealing description of your car was relayed to dispatch and depending on the dispatch system your description might have been boardcast over the entire district.  (Although in Illinois this is rare.)  Here are some actual examples of "traffic call-in's"  (Note:  These calls are from the Mass. state police turnpike patrol (159.030 MHz) 
<Sorry if any of you are in this>

	Unit >4405> "4405"
	Dispatch> "4405 go"
	Unit>4405> "4405, 

	As there is a description of you, it is in your best interst to flee the immediate district as soon as possible.  Your plate is also on record via the dispatchers terminal so the car you are driving is now hot.  The dispatcher will run the plate as the persuit goes and locate the owners address, if you or someone you live with is the owner, don't even bother going home.  Likewise it is in you best interest to ditch the car, or at least the plates quickly, remember that a more accurate description will be given the moment you flee, so new plates may not be entirely effective.  

	Fleeing before a roadside stop:

	If you own the car, or it can be easily traced to you and it is very likely that you will be arrested if you are stopped, you might elect to flee before being stopped.  The main idea here is to prevent identification of the car via license plate.  Begin flight the moment you discover you are being chased, make numerous turns to prevent exposing your plate.  Try to maintain a safe distance as well.

	Fleeing from the scene of a crime.

	If you are preforming a "get - away" assume that the entire description of the car and it's occupants is well known.  Change clothes immediately or as soon as possible and try your best to change the appearence of the car.  (Washing or dirtying will help some.)  The most important factor here is that you flee the immediate district first where the most active search will be.  When you leave the scene do so with moderation.  Select a speed that blends subility with good ground covering speed.  Take side streets until you are removed from the immediate scene.  Remember that most cars will be heading to the scene first.  As the nature of the crime is revealed the search will broaden.  

	B:  Ok, I'm running,  NOW WHAT?

	The police in the area always have the advantage.  They are armed with trained officers and most importantly, radios.  Your advantage, depending on how vicious you are, is that police officers will take the public's safety into consideration more than you might.  
	A quote from the Illinois State Trooper Training Manual :

	"When you decide to pursue a fleeing adversary, try to follow the same route as your subject.  Let HIM discover the hidden dangers so you can avoid them.  Your goal should be to stay in control and allow your adversary to identify the pitfalls in the best possible way - for you"

	Knowing this, one must strive to make that path which the officer may follow as difficult to traverse as possible.  Use other motorists.  If that grandma next to you looks skidish, Smack her car a few times, Even just swerve in front of her.  Pass on the right, don't make it overly easy to follow you.  On top of which, an officer will be more inclined to stop pursuing if you leave an accident behind you and generally make it clear that the pursuit is a danger of public safety.  

	Police in general drive "Pursuit Package" cars which are built to handle the pitfalls of pursuit.  Anti sway bars and "Curb Jumpers"  are part of the standard setup.  The typical car will jump the highest curbs at speed with little difficulty.  

	Don't bother driving in a straight line at 130 - 140 trying to put some distance between you and them, because unless you have a car that will do 150 - 160 you won't.  

	The Illinois State Police are given the statistic that 90% of all drivers will take a Right, left, left pattern when being followed, so DON'T.

	Get off the highway as soon as you can, any lengthly highway chase will be a lost cause for you.  It makes your whereabouts very obvious and your path easy to intercept.

	Forget the state line.  Hot pursuit laws allow any officer to cross any district lines as long as you are visable and fleeing.  

	Be unpredictable, more than anything else, try to change your direction frequently, it's very difficult for a cop to keep radioing in with one hand and follow you with the other.  Frequent U-Turns are valuable.

	KNOW YOUR ENEMY!

	Is it a state trooper following you?
	If so, is it a pursuit vehicle?
	Perhaps it's a local cop?
	
	As a general rule, the stateies will be the ones to watch, they are usually better trained in pursuits.  Chicago police are all trained in driving, but rarely very well.  This training takes the form of a series of skid control exercises done on some old air strip somewhere.  Suburban cops will usually be the least trained.
	

""Remember this, don't try to out preform the machine, out preform the driver.u won't.  In training t when being followed, so DON'T.lengthynd your path easy to intercept. you are visible and fleeing.  Understand that most police will assume you to be a non-intellgent punk who stole the car.  Even if you did, you must prove them wrong, but not until it suits you.

	Mentally change your direction as well, become passive then active again in your flight.  Allow no second guessing.  Frequent U-Turns are valuable.  Use turn signals to indicate your turns and lane changes, it will naturally be assumed that you are stupid, and signaling out of habit.  Surprise surprise when you pull a harsh left with no signal (or better yet, a right signal) that the officer has been depending on for knee jerk reactions.  Use your normal brakes until a rather harsh turn then use the parking brake (Which shouldn't light the brake lights)  Be careful using the parking brakes though, they may only be attached to the rear wheels which when applied harshly, will cause the rear wheels to lock and negate traction causing the rear end of the car to slide out of line <Disaster>  Remember to hold down the brake release button/handle however.  (Some more advanced drivers may experiment with locking the rear wheels to pull harder U-Turns)... try this in a vacant (Read very large and very empty) lot.

	Night pursuits are the most desirable for you.  Being the fleeing subject, the darkness will work only in your favor.  Illinois troopers are trained to memorize and follow tail lights (it is my guess that this is common police practice)  Drive until you feel that you might meld into the surroundings and go dark.  If you have rearward fog lights, or can change the appearance of your rear lights in any manner while driving, wait till your out of sight briefly, and do so.  For a touch of surprise (surprise is the take home word here)  take a left, kill the lights, THEN U-Turn before the trooper rounds the corner.  Make all your night maneuvers when you're just out of sight, in front of a car, or around a corner, make it that much more difficult to reacquire you visually.  

	As a general rule put more than one element in your maneuvers, just turning left is not quite as effective as turning left and U-Turning followed by a quick right.  Try the "TOP GUN" turn.  Switch lanes and slam the brakes.  With luck he'll zoom by.  <Best to try this when the cop is rather close>  Following this, pull a hard right.  Take advantage of being out of sight.  

	D:  Foreign Objects

	You may find that your driving alone is not enough.  It's time to resort to foreign objects.  Oil is useful, but not to the extent that movies would have you believe.  Through my own trials I've found that it takes at least 4 quarts of motor oil well spread out to do much good.  The only real way to deploy this amount is by filling a large glass jug with oil and throwing it forcibly on the ground to break the glass and disperse the oil.  It is best to drop the oil on the halfway point of a curve where the most lateral stress will be on the cars tires.  With luck the lack of traction will leave the cop sliding at a tangent to the turn, and with more luck, hard enough into the curb sideways to pull the tire from the hub.  
	A little creativity will give you several useful tire puncturing devices.  A two by four with numerous nails might suffice, again deployment timing is the major factor in this success.  
	Fire extinguishers will completely or partially impair vision depending on the speed you are traveling.  Opt for the dry chemical sort here, they coat the windshields and make obscure vision quite well.  (Note: These are available at little or no cost (read free) at your local hotel.  Walk in with a bag, walk out with a bag and an extinguisher.)  Point the hose up and out the window so the fall to earth effect can work on your side.  Again, deploy your "screen" at a time where it will serve you will, take advantage of the screen to maneuver.

	E:  When all else fails: The crash.

	If you have a truly gifted follower who refuses to give up, try the crash.  If you appear out of control, the officer is going to back off to avoid hitting you.  (Try this without the crash first)  Crash the car in a manner to block your escape route on foot to the cop.  Roll down the windows before crashing to prevent the stick-em door blues.  Do you best to crash on the right side of the car, unless you have a passenger there, to prevent injury and to block the road laterally.  Alternately, crash through something that the cop would never consider following you through.  If the car is that disposable and you are that desperate, hit the cop a few times as well.  Try to hit his wheels, you might just get lucky after all.

	F:  The big picture.

	The big picture is moderating your methods with your level of "escape desire" and level of "escape ability".  Keep in control of the situation at all times and drive clever rather than fast.  I would personally advise buying a police scanner if you are ever counting on being chased, they are invaluable tools to keep you one step ahead of the game.  Moreover, they will give you an idea in the long run of how much "THEY" know about you, and when to give up.  Remember above all that 9 out of 10 pursuits end in an arrest.  Know when to run, and when not to.  The ideal pursuits last less than a minute, and leaves the officer with little or no idea what you were driving/look like.  (Perfect example, the 100+ Mph blown night time speed trap.)  Encourage the short pursuit as the long one will likely be your downfall.  Remember that law enforcement officials are there for your protection, and their actions are for the common good.  Injury to officers and or innocent persons is the least desirable outcome of any activity.  Evading police custody or questioning is illegal and an obstruction of justice.

	Note that unit 4405 is inconsistent.  Sometimes plate numbers given, sometimes not.  Too much coffee perhaps?  Well who's to tell the point is that it's likely that there is at least a BASIC description made BEFORE each stop.  (Likely this is to provide rescue if the unit doesn't respond or request plate / license info in a few minutes)  The dispatcher will even occasionally check back with a traffic to assure himself the unit is ok, and not bleeding his life into the pavement.  Or even to hurry him up to another call or keep him from calling a traffic to sleep.
