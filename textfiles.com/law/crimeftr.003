             Privately Funded Rewards - How Much do they Pay?

There are a few privately funded organizations who offer rewards for
information leading to the conviction of felony crimes and some
misdemeanors. Two of the most popular are We-Tip and Crime Stoppers.

We-Tip was founded in 1972 by Bill Brownell, a retired Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Deputy, and Miriam Eckert, an Ontario (California) business
owner. Initially, the program was a California citizen's self-help program
against drugs. In 1982, We-Tip went nationwide and expanded to include all
major crimes. We-Tip now covers all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands, Canada, and Mexico. Because We-Tip was the first, it's recognized
as the originator of anonymous tip programs.

Crime Stoppers was founded in 1976 by Greg MacAleese, a New Mexico
policeman. Like We-Tip, it provides financial incentives to encourage
citizens to report criminal activity.

As a result of We-Tip and Crime Stoppers' programs, the number of tips sent
to police departments has increased substantially. Both have the same idea,
concepts, and get similar results. The difference is in their method of
sales promotion and fund-raising to pay rewards. Another difference is that
Crime Stoppers has been organized into Chapters (called "Programs"),
whereas We-Tip is not. As a result Crime Stoppers quickly grew to about
1,000 local Chapters by 1990, in the United States, Canada, Africa,
Australia, England, and the Netherlands. In 1989, 193 Crime Stoppers
programs operated in Texas alone!

There are three levels of Crime Stoppers: municipal, state-wide,and Crime
Stoppers International, Inc. All are non-profit. CrimeStoppers' goal is to
promote programs throughout the world and help coordinate and exchange
information among state and local groups.

Crime Stoppers charges no franchise fee to start a local program but there
is a $25,000 minimum funding required for payment of rewards, and specific
operating requirements to protect the name and concept of Crime Stoppers.

The address of Crime Stoppers International, Inc. is 3736 Eubank Blvd.,
N.E., Suite B-4, Albuquerque, New Mexico  87111, (505)294-2300 or (800)
245-0009.

We-Tip's mailing address is: We-Tip Inc., P.O. Box 1296, Rancho Cucamonga,
California 91730. We-Tip operates out of a single location via "800"
numbers: In California (800-78-CRIME), outside California (800) 73-CRIME,
or FAX: (714) 987-2477. These hotlines are operated 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week.
                              Both are Needed

We-Tip pays rewards for information on criminal activity "anywhere,
anytime" in the United States. That includes rural areas, interstate
highways, and National Forests.  We-Tip's wanted posters on marijuana
growers and free bumper stickers are found in National Forests' Ranger
Stations, for example.

Crime Stoppers obtains funding from local businesses and from individuals
living in their area. Local groups are authorized by their board of
directors to pay rewards only for information concerning crimes in their
community. That's because there is a limit on local donations and fund-
raising drives from residents and merchants. Local programs can't afford to
pay rewards for information on crimes committed outside their community.

Each organization has strengths and weaknesses. We-Tip fills in the gaps in
areas where Crime Stoppers does not pay rewards. Together, they cover the
entire country.

If a community is too small to financially support a local Crime Stoppers
program, but wants to do something about the crime rate, they can
distribute We-Tip's brochures in their area to obtain We-Tip's coverage.

We-Tip is like a Federal Marshall who covers all counties throughout the
United States plus other areas. Crime Stoppers groups are like city police
who cover only their respective cities. By coincidence, Bill Brownell is a
retired county deputy sheriff, whereas Greg MacAleese is a city policeman.

                               Fund Raising

Crime Stoppers Chapters have about 10,000 key people throughout the United
States who actively promote their fund-raising and reward-paying programs.
They advertise heavily in local newspapers, radio, T.V., and billboards.
That's the major advantage of the franchise concept.

Another advantage is political clout created by thousands of motivated
people (committee members) of local Chapters in all 50 states. Because
Chapters are non-profit, they usually get free advertising on radio, T.V.
and outdoor advertising. News articles and press releases are also used to
get maximum coverage.

We-Tip isn't as well known as Crime Stoppers outside of California and
adjoining states because their advertising is mainly in the Western states.
We-Tip concentrates the advertising of their reward program via
professionally designed brochures.

We-Tip's brochures, one for every serious crime, are sold at low cost to
anyone who wants to distribute them in their community. The small box on
the back of the brochure provides the name and address of the person or
business making them available. The cost of brochures is tax-deductible as
advertising costs for companies. We-Tip has them printed in large
quantities and sells them at a small profit. The profits from the sale of
brochures, plus donations, are used to fund their reward money.

                               Misdemeanors

We-Tip pays rewards for information on all felonies anywhere in the United
States. And, according to one of their brochures, they pay rewards for
information concerning vandalism and graffiti misdemeanors.

Crime Stoppers may or may not pay rewards for information on serious
misdemeanors. Nationwide, millions of misdemeanors are committed every
year. Crime Stoppers and We-Tip would be quickly out of funds if they paid
rewards for all misdemeanors. When in doubt, call them.

                      Rewards - How much can you get?

Most privately funded organizations, such as Crime Stoppers, Crime Solvers,
Secret Witness, Crime Line, We-Tip and others, pay rewards "up to $1,000."
But, very few tipsters are paid $1,000. The reason is, rewards are raised
by donations and local fund-raising events. There's a limit on how much
they can afford to pay. Further, they pay an amount based on a formula, and
not everyone gets top dollar. Very few tipsters can provide the kind of
information needed for a conviction. Often, they aren't personally involved
in solving the crime, obtaining evidence, making arrests, or taking risks
of physical harm to qualify for the maximum reward.

The following information is how Crime Stoppers calculate rewards. Most
privately funded organizations have similar formulas.

Point Systems for calculating Rewards Paid to Tipsters

Part 1.

Points     Category of Crimes
-------    -------------------------------
3.5  Capital murder. (First degree)

3.0  Murder, sale, distribution and manufacture of narcotics, in penalty
     group I.

2.5  Aggravated offenses of robbery, robbery, sexual assault, assault,
     kidnapping, indecency with a child. Sale or distribution or
     manufacture of narcotics in penalty group II

2.0  Burglary, arson. Sale or distribution or manufacture of narcotics in
     penalty group III.

1.5  Felony possession of narcotics in penalty groups I, II, and III.
     Felony theft.

1.2  Felony offenses against public health, safety and morals. (Weapons,
     gambling, prostitution, pornography, felony criminal mischief).

1.0  Auto theft, fraud, hit and run with injury, and fugitive and felon
     apprehensions.


Part 2.   Additional Points

(a)  Personal risk to tipsters

1.2   High risk
0.8   Medium risk
0.5   Moderate risk
0.0   Low or no risk

(b)  Number of Crimes solved

0.8  for three or more
0.6  for Two
0.2  for one

(c)  Property recovered/narcotics seized

1.3  if greater than $100,000
0.8  if greater than $ 20,000
0.6  if greater than $ 10,000
0.3  if greater than $  2,500
0.1  if greater than $  1,000
0.0  if less than $1,000


(d) Number of persons arrested

0.8  if three or more
0.6  if two persons
0.4  if one person

Part 3.  Conversion of points to dollars

Total points   Reward is between - -

   1.0  $ 75 - - 200
   1.1 - 1.2 - - $100 - 250
   1.3 - 1.4 - - $125 - 300
   1.5 - 2.0 - - $150 - 350
   2.1 - 2.5 - - $200 - 400
   2.6 - 3.0 - - $250 - 450
   3.1 - 3.5 - - $300 - 500
   3.6 - 4.0 - - $350 - 550
   4.1 - 4.5 - - $400 - 600
   4.6 - 5.0 - - $450 - 650
   5.1 - 5.5 - - $500 - 700
   5.6 - 6.0 - - $550 - 1,000

The maximum points (6.0) are seldom attained and $1,000 seldom paid. To
determine how much would be paid for a certain crime and under varying
circumstances, add up the points you might get and calculate the amount.

Rewards will be approximately as shown in the above formula. Rewards may
vary $100 or so, depending on a few other factors. A sudden crime wave,
in a small community, with many rewards pending might force them to pay
rewards less than indicated in their formula. Thus, there is no guarantee
of how much you will be paid.

                   Crime Stoppers vs Government Agencies

When a person who just happens to notice something and makes a 2-minute
telephone call, a reward of $100 to $200 is fair and reasonable. Privately
funded organizations who use such a formula usually have it geared to
compensate and satisfy a one-time tipster.

However, if someone were to go undercover and infiltrate a drug ring or
spend a few weeks or months to get information and evidence, the extra
points (and dollars paid) are not in direct proportion to effort. Extra
points earned for high personal risk (1.2) means the reward might be
increased only by $120 according to their formula. If there is significant
time, effort, expense or personal risk involved, it would be smarter to
contact the FBI and negotiate for a reward of $10,000 to $250,000!

The comments above are directed to full-time CrimeFighters. They need to
know what they can expect from We-Tip and Crime Stoppers, and why they
should zero in on Federal rewards.

CrimeFighters are in a different category than tipsters. They aren't people
who just happen to hear about, or see, a crime in progress. CrimeFighters
may spend considerable time, money and effort establishing a network of
street people and ex-convicts to get tips or evidence of criminal activity.
They require appropriate compensation in proportion to their time, effort,
expense, and personal risk when they become personally involved in
investigative work.
                              Double-Dipping

Scenario: A CrimeFighter learns of a drug distribution network. He obtains
information concerning felony charges of drugs, firearms violations,
smuggling, income tax evasion, traffic violations and a few other felonies.
The information includes many different violations.

Question: If many laws were broken, would he be paid a reward from each
department if each department had provisions to pay rewards? The answer is
no. In most cases he would be paid only from the department to whom he
reported the original information. Some laws (Customs, for example) specify
rewards are to be paid for "original information," or words to that effect.
Because of the discretionary powers of agencies who authorize payment of
rewards, very few would allow double-dipping. If the information was first
given to Crime Stoppers, Crime Stoppers would pay, but it might be the only
reward paid!

An exception is drug-related offenses. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
reward, Title 18, USCS 886, specifically mentions this reward may be paid
in addition to any other reward. However, it is also subject to
discretionary powers of its administrator.

The problem is that no matter how large or small the amount paid may be,
any payment from privately funded organizations usually makes it impossible
to collect a larger reward from the government. A larger reward might be
paid by the federal government if the CrimeFighter contacts them first.

                              Recommendation

Privately funded organizations (PFOs), such as We-Tip, CrimeStoppers and
others, should continue offering their small rewards to one-time tipsters
but could advise tipsters they may be eligible for $1,000 or more from the
Federal Government. If the tipster chooses to apply for a larger reward,
PFOs could offer to introduce them to a Federal agent (usually the FBI)
with whom they would negotiate for a Federal reward.

This procedure will allow PFOs to work with rather than compete with the
Federal government. It will also help PFOs to (indirectly) obtain funding
for larger rewards from the Federal Government. PFOs can then advertise
that larger rewards, such as $1,000 to $250,000, is available. That would
increase interest in their programs and provide stronger incentives to
tipsters -- at no cost to them!

The best solution is to have PFOs join forces to ask their legislators to
pass a state law that are as good as or better than the hodgepodge of
Federal laws. When such state reward laws are passed, there would be no
need to use Federal laws to obtain maximum rewards! (Chapter 28 has a
proposed CrimeFighter reward law that could be used as guidelines.)

                           Shopping for Rewards

Law enforcement agencies often squabble over who has jurisdiction because
they compete with each other for certain cases. As in football, each team
wants to make the touchdowns and get the glory. It's understandable team
leaders in such agencies want to get all the tips for their team.

I have noticed a few letters, memos and suggestions in official
correspondence to field agents that suggest shopping around for larger
rewards by tipsters should be discouraged. These comments were either
motivated by the team effort or because of their funding limitations. Such
short-sighted policies minimize law enforcement incentives and results.

A full-time CrimeFighter isn't in the same class as a casual, one-time
tipster. CrimeFighters are self-employed private investigators. They need
to be paid according to their investment of time, money and personal
danger. Token rewards may be suitable for tipsters who chance upon certain
information and make a short phone call. Token rewards do not provide
sufficient incentives for full-time, private, licensed or unlicensed
investigators.

The bottom line is, if the job doesn't pay enough, no one will be seriously
interested. If the job can pay from $50,000 to $100,000 a year, thousands
of ex-police, licensed private investigators, and trained security
personnel might consider becoming full-time professional CrimeFighters.
That's what we really need!  And, that's what I hope to achieve with an
invitation to you to become a voting member in a local CrimeFighter group.
