                       POLICE PRACTICES:                         
                 MIAMI'S ETHNIC SHARING PROGRAM             
 
                                                                  
     Over the past several years, Miami, Florida, has grown very
rapidly and undergone numerous changes.  As a result, Miami's
population has also increased and now includes numerous ethnic
groups.  Unfortunately, one result of this new ethnic diversity
has been increasing separatism and misunderstanding.  Today,
with the increasing threat of crime and violence, it is
imperative that people of all races work to overcome division
and mistrust.  This goal is especially important for law
enforcement officers.

     The Miami Police Department, which is comprised of officers
from various ethnic backgrounds, has attempted to represent the
ethnic diversity of the Miami area fairly and accurately and to
meet the needs of the community.  To this end, the department
has conducted several training programs for police officers.

     One such program, developed by the American Jewish
Committee, is called "Ethnic Sharing."  The first "Ethnic
Sharing" program was held December 8, 1989.  And, after
receiving positive feedback from the initial 31 participants,
the department implemented two additional programs and scheduled
future classes.

     Miami's "Ethnic Sharing" program is divided into four
phases.  The facilitator opens the first phase by explaining the
nature of prejudice and ethnic stereotyping.  This phase also
includes a lecture and a quick association exercise where the
facilitator calls out the names of ethnic groups and asks the
participants to respond.  These responses serve to illustrate
various ethnic stereotypes and create the framework for the
program.

     In the second phase, the facilitator establishes rapport
with the group by sharing his/her ethnic background.  The
facilitator then discusses any personal experiences and
difficulties encountered as a result of ethnic heritage.

     During the third phase, which lasts approximately 3 hours,
the facilitator questions the participants about their own
ethnic backgrounds.  The facilitator then divides the class into
two groups, creating a panel and an audience.  The facilitator
also chooses a representative of each ethnic group to sit on the
panel so that it reflects the areas ethnic diversity.

     After this panel is formed, the facilitator poses the
following three questions to each panel member:

     *  What do you like about your ethnic heritage?                 

     *  What do you dislike about your ethnic heritage?              

     *  What brought you to police work?                          

The facilitator uses the responses to these questions to probe 
for further reactions.  In addition, these responses not only 
provide the next panel member with a basis on which to develop 
responses, but they also help the other panel members to become 
accustomed to the process.                                        

     Following the panel discussion, the facilitator encourages
the audience to share any additional experiences and feelings.
The ultimate goal in this third phase is to foster unity among
the officers and to help them understand that although certain
prejudices and ethnic stereotypes exist, there are numerous
similarities among all people.

     In the fourth phase, the facilitator gives the participants
informational materials, such as excerpts from news broadcasts,
newspapers, periodicals, and textbooks.  Each excerpt,
concerning an ethnic group, contains statements that someone has
found offensive.  The participants are then asked to examine the
information in each excerpt, to discuss why it caused a problem,
and to decide whether they agree that the issue is offensive.

     During these discussions, the participants express many
intense feelings and beliefs, which the facilitator attempts to
integrate into a group understanding.  Participants find this
discussion very thought-provoking, and they usually come away
from the program realizing that whatever a person's ethnic
origin, everyone shares similar feelings and beliefs.

     Programs such as "Ethnic Sharing" have been of great
benefit to the Miami Police Department and have helped promote
unity among the officers.  Today, a police department cannot
serve its community effectively until all its members function
as one.  Even though the process toward ethnic understanding
will be long and difficult, understanding and respect for
various ethnic groups are attainable.
