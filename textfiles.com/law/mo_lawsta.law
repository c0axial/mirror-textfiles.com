SECTION 569.095 Tampering with computer data, penalties

    1. A person commits the crime of tampering with computer data 
if he knowingly and without authorization or without reasonable 
grounds to believe that he has such authorization:

    (1) Modifies or destroys data or programs residing or 
existing internal to a computer, computer system or computer 
network; or

    (2) Modifies or destroys data or program ors supporting 
documentation residing or existing external to a computer, 
computer system, or computer network; or

    (3) Discloses or takes data, programs, or supporting 
documentation, residing or existing internal or external to a 
computer, computer system, or computer network; or

    (4) Discloses or takes a password, identifying code, personal 
identification number, or other confidential information about a 
computer system or network that is intended to or does control 
access to the computer system or network;

/* How do you know what information is confidential? The statute 
doesn't make this clear at all, so, it would seem that unless the 
information other than passwords is prominently marked as 
"confidential under Missouri Statutes 569.095, that this would be 
a very hard case to prove.*/

    (5) Accesses a computer, a computer system, or a computer 
network and intentionally examines information about another 
person;

/* This is drafted so broadly as to possibly be meaningless or 
invalid. It is quite possible (see Quick BBS for one) for  a BBS 
to list the names and phone numbers of others  on the system. The 
law seems to be intended to prevent people from reading data that 
is worthy of protection from outside viewing and ordinarily 
considered as confidential. As written this provision may be "
void for vagueness." */

believes was obtained in violation of this subsection.
