Arkansas has one of the most
comprehensive set of regulations on computer use.... The computer

SECTION 5-41-101. Purpose

          It is found and determined that computer-related crime 
poses a major problem for business and government; that losses 
for each incident of computer-related crime are potentially 
astronomical; that the opportunities for computer-related crime in 
business and government through the introduction of fraudulent 
records into a computer system, the unauthorized use of 
computers, the alteration or destruction of computer information 
or files, and the stealing of financial instruments, data, and 
other assets are great; that computer-related crime has a direct 
affect on state commerce; and that, while various forms of 
computer crime might possibly be the subject of criminal charges 
based on other provisions of law, it is appropriate and 
desirable that a statute be enacted which deals directly with 
computer crime.
