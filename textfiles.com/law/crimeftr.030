                                 Option 1

For $10.00 you can become a Charter Member of CrimeFighters International,
Inc.  This option provides a membership card and entitles you to attend
membership meetings at local CFI lodges.

The card comes with a folded plastic sheet which is used to emboss the card
after you have inserted your picture. When embossed, it can be trimmed to
the size of your driver's license. (Embossing is done with a regular flat
iron. A laminating kit with instructions is included with the I.D. card.)

The actual membership card looks far nicer and more impressive than the
following sample because of the limitations of ASCII text. Also not shown
here is the phantom image of the CrimeFighter logo in the background.
