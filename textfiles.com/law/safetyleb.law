                      SAFETY ACTION TEAM

                         Lieutenant
        Multnomah County, Oregon, Sheriff's Department                       
        
                                                          
     Throughout the past decade, the City of Portland, Oregon, 
once well known for its natural beauty and peacefulness, 
experienced a drastic change.  Gang violence, fueled by an 
increased flow of crack cocaine throughout the area, led to an 
astounding rise in crime rates.  Turf battles between rival gangs 
erupted in once placid neighborhoods.                             

THE PROBLEM                                                       

     The housing authority projects throughout the area were 
particularly hard hit by the violence and criminal activity. 
Specifically, the Columbia Villa Housing Project became notorious 
for gang-sponsored violence, drug dealings, and drive-by 
shootings.  Turf battles ensued as rival gangs sought to dominate 
the growing drug trade in the project, and residents of Columbia 
Villa found themselves caught in the middle of the turf warfare.  

     In this environment, crime became a way of life for many. 
Children acted as lookouts and runners for the drug dealers; some 
even became small-time peddlers.  Teens were pressured to join 
gangs and commit crimes against other residents as rights of 
initiation.  Juvenile delinquency thrived.  Residents who refused 
to join the criminal element often found themselves the victims 
of it.                                                            

     In addition to the crime problem, residents of Columbia 
Villa faced a variety of social and economic barriers.  Nearly 
100 percent of the families in the project lived at or below the 
poverty level, with annual family incomes ranging from $2,500 to 
$12,000. Many residents lacked high school diplomas and could not 
read at a functional level, which severely limited their 
employment potential.  Other residents suffered chronic or 
unattended health problems.  Transportation and access to child 
care were very limited. Few residents possessed job skills or 
experience, and there was a chronic lack of positive role 
models.                                                           

A VIABLE SOLUTION                                                 

     In April 1989, the Housing Authority of Portland (HAP) 
contracted with the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office to provide 
police services in Columbia Villa for 1 year.  The goals were to:  

     *  Reduce the fear of crime                                     

     *  Reduce the actual criminal activity in the project, and      

     *  Empower the tenants of Columbia Villa to regain control
        by building their self-confidence and self-esteem.

     The contract stipulated that HAP would provide office space 
for the deputies assigned to Columbia Villa, while the sheriff's 
office would assign one lieutenant, three sworn deputies, and two 
community services officers (CSOs) to the project.  In addition 
to an unmarked administrative vehicle, the officers used a 
nine-passenger, marked van and one marked patrol car.  The office 
space for the sheriff's office personnel was located next to the 
on-site housing authority manager to facilitate information 
sharing.                                                       

SAFETY ACTION TEAM                                                

     The group assigned to Columbia Villa was named the Safety 
Action Team (SAT).  Members possessed the necessary professional 
and social skills that would enable them to deal effectively with 
the complexities that characterized life in Columbia Villa.  In 
early April 1989, the team went to work to reduce the fear of 
crime and to help the residents reclaim their housing 
development.                                                  

METHODS                                                           

     The Safety Action Team employs specific methods to stem the 
tide of crime.  These include:                                    

     *  ``Walking and Talking''--Each officer and CSO was 
        responsible for contacting five residents per shift               

     *  Working with the maintenance staff to structure parking
        lots with painted lines and registering residents'
        vehicles with annual renewable parking decals (only
        residents would be allowed to park in the lots)

     *  Identifying criminal elements, particularly the drug 
        dealers and gang members; warning them and their
        families of eviction for continued criminal activity

     *  Identifying outsiders who bring problems into the area
        and begin enforcing trespass ordinances

     *  Training residents in crime prevention techniques, such
        as situation avoidance, burglary proofing, and
        especially, crime reporting

     *  Identifying truants and transporting them to class, while 
        encouraging children to stay in school                            

     *  Establishing an athletic program, such as the Police 
        Athletic League (PAL), and recruiting off-duty police
        officers or citizens to assist in coaching teams

     In addition to these steps, the SAT organized trips for 
children to the zoo and other places of interest, made job 
placement available to youths, and attempted to create an 
atmosphere of safety for the elderly and handicapped by making 
the marked police van available to them for transportation to
the hospital, store, or work.

SAT ON PATROL                                                     

     The unique geographic layout and size of the housing project 
presented special problems to the SAT.  Since contact with as 
many of the residents as possible was a primary goal, and because 
crime could occur any place within the 77-acre project, SAT 
personnel quickly realized that the success of their program 
depended on mobility.                                             

     To increase the officers' mobility, two private businesses 
and the local Rotary Club donated five mountain bikes and 
accessory equipment.  The deputies' uniforms were modified to 
conform to the needs of cycling, and members of the Bicycle Unit 
of the Seattle, Washington, Police Department assisted with the 
training.  The deputies learned to tackle running suspects from 
their bikes, dismount at 25 m.p.h without injury, and ride up and 
down stairs.  Not only did the bicycles enable the officers to 
contact residents more easily, but the use of bicycles also 
enhanced the deputies' ability to spot criminal activity.  No one 
expected an officer to be riding a bike.                        

RESULTS                                                           

     During the first 4 months of the program, the deputies 
personally contacted 1,752 tenants.  Through the SAT's efforts, 
75 Columbia Villa residents, including many former gang members, 
gained employment in the Portland area.                           

     Deputies transported tenants scheduled for court appearances 
to their trials and hearings.  Some of the suspects were released 
by the court back to the supervision of the SAT.  The releases 
were conditional, with many of the defendants becoming involved 
in cleaning up the parking lots and grounds around their homes. 
Pride slowly began to build, and with it, emerged a new 
atmosphere in Columbia Villa.  Tenants, who were first 
apprehensive about visiting the SAT office, began to request help 
or offer their assistance.  Children began to center activities 
around the office and looked to the SAT personnel as new role 
models, replacing the drug dealers and gang leaders.              

     Calls to the Central Dispatch Center became more detailed as 
residents of the project took an increased personal interest in 
ridding the neighborhood of crime.  Soon after the SAT program 
was instituted, a noticeable reduction in the fear of crime had 
encouraged tenants of Columbia Villa to believe that with their 
support, criminal activity could be significantly reduced in the 
project.                                                          

     As media accounts began to tell of the change taking place 
in Columbia Villa, the community responded with an outpouring of 
support and donations.  Church groups in the surrounding areas 
contacted the SAT office wanting to know how they could volunteer 
their time and efforts.  Area businesses provided free of charge 
nutritional snacks for the children of the project, fishing 
trips, basketball uniforms, tickets to cultural and sporting 
events, even a new microwave oven and computer.  In essence, the 
community got involved.                                     

CONCLUSION                                                        

     Within the first month of the SAT program, the fear of crime 
had been significantly reduced in Columbia Villa.  As the fear of 
crime diminished, tenants gradually became confident enough to 
make detailed calls to the police and sheriff's departments when 
criminal activity was observed.                                   

     Eventually, through the efforts of the SAT, an atmosphere of 
pride began to replace despair in the project.  Because of the 
mobility of the SAT team and the newly acquired diligence of the 
residents, open air drug deals are no longer the norm in the 
project.  Gang activity diminished as the gangs were denied new 
members.  Now, the project's youth center activities around the 
SAT officers.                                                     

     The pilot program sparked the interest of other law 
enforcement agencies with large housing projects within their 
jurisdictions.  The success of the SAT program in meeting its 
three original goals  reducing the fear of crime, reducing 
actual criminal activity, and empowering project residents to 
reclaim their neighborhood demonstrates how law enforcement can 
take a lead role in reversing the tide of crime.
