     Graduation night, prom night, spring vacation--these are 
special times for high school students.  But how often have the 
media carried accounts of tragic accidents that resulted because 
of intoxification of minors during these special times?  
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is simply ``too 
many.''                                             
              
     In Fernandina Beach, FL, the police department and the 
Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco have combined 
education, public relations, and law enforcement into a cohesive 
effort to stop underage drinking.  OPERATION ALERT (Alcohol--Law 
Enforcement/Retail Training) is a multi-faceted program that 
combines retail vendor training, student and parent awareness, 
and law enforcement action to reduce alcohol consumption by 
persons under 21 years of age.  The program is divided into four 
phases.                                   
                        
     In phase 1, a letter cosigned by the chief of police and the 
district commander for the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and 
Tobacco is sent to retail licensees each spring.  The letter 
reminds vendors of the upcoming vacation season and 
end-of-school-year activities.  It asks for their help to control 
the sale of alcoholic beverages to underage persons and reminds 
them of the importance of checking identifications closely for 
forged or altered IDs.  The letter also notes that the laws 
governing the sale of alcoholic beverages will be strictly 
enforced and that arrests and administrative charges will be made 
for those who fail to comply.                                     

     Phase 2 is a joint training session offered to all 
retailers and their employees.  The topics covered include 
identifying fake IDs, the liability to retailers for selling to 
minors, and issues involving theft reduction and robbery 
protection.                                                       

     In phase 3, all graduating seniors and their parents 
receive a letter reminding them not to let the celebration of 
graduation turn into a tragedy through alcohol consumption.  The 
letter reminds the parents of the new house party law in Florida 
and the penalties involved.  The house party law, which went into 
effect in October 1988, makes it a 2nd degree misdemeanor for an 
adult to use a residence as the place where alcohol and illegal 
drugs are made available and consumed by persons under 21 years 
of age.  The misdemeanor carries a fine of $500 and/or 60 days in 
jail.                                                             

     Phase 4 consists of a concerted law enforcement effort. 
Throughout the year, but especially during the spring and summer 
months, directed patrols are used to reduce the availability and 
consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Underage volunteers, usually 
17- to 18-year olds who have parental consent, are used to 
attempt to purchase alcoholic beverages from vendors who are the 
object of complaints from parents and school administrators.  To 
witness the transaction and as a safety measure, a law 
enforcement officer, acting as a customer, is always in the 
establishment while the teen attempts to make a purchase.  
Employees who sell to minors are arrested on the spot by the 
officer, and the Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco then 
initiates administrative action against the retailer's beverage 
license.                                                          

     Special attention is also directed to prom night and 
graduation night.  The location of parties and events are 
identified in advance, and intensified training is offered to 
employees at these locations.  Substance-free parties are hosted 
by civic groups.  In addition, high-profile law enforcement 
activities are scheduled which include visiting licensed 
retailers and places where students congregate.                   

     The law enforcement problems created by celebrations and 
activities involving the unlawful consumption of alcoholic 
beverages are numerous, and often times deadly.  However, 
OPERATION ALERT has been useful in attacking these problems.  To 
date, no teenage fatalities due to intoxification have occurred 
in Fernandina Beach since the program began in 1985.
