        Mail Order sales are governed by rules of the Federal Trade 
    Commission (FTC) and various state laws. 

        FTC rules say:

        1) The Seller must ship your order within 30 days of receiving 
    it, unless the advertisement clearly states that it'll take longer. 

        2) If it appears that your order will not be shipped when 
    promised, the Seller must notify you in writing in advance of the 
    promised date, giving a definite new date, if known, and offering 
    you the opportunity to cancel the order with a refund or consent to 
    a definite delayed shipping date or an indefinite delay. 

        3) The Seller's notice must contain a stamped self-addressed 
    card or envelope with which you can indicate your preference.  If 
    you don't respond to this notice, the Seller may assume you agree to 
    the delay, but must either ship or cancel your order within 30 days 
    after the original shipping date promised or required.  A prompt 
    refund must be made when an order is cancelled. 

        4)  Even if you've consented to an indefinite delay, you retain 
    the right to cancel the order at any time before the item has been 
    shipped. 

        5)  If you chose to cancel and order, that has been paid for by 
    check or money order, the Seller must mail you a refund within seven 
    business days.  If you cancel an order for which you paid by credit 
    card, the seller must credit your account within one billing cycle 
    following receipt of your request.  Store credits or vouchers in 
    place of a refund are not acceptable. 

        6)  In the event that the item you ordered is unavailable, the 
    Seller may not send you substitute merchandise without your express 
    consent. 

                             Tips When Ordering

        State precisely what merchandise you want, specifying details 
    such as model, make, size, component parts, etc.; 

        Confirm the price and expected delivery date as stated in the ad; 

        Indicate whether you will accept a substitute product if the 
    item you ordered is unavailable, and, if not, that your payment 
    should be returned; 

        Don't send cash, you will have no record of payment if a problem 
    arises, and; 

        Keep a copy of your order and all other correspondence with the 
    seller.  Your records should indicate the company's name, address 
    and phone number; a description of the item ordered; your cancelled 
    check or a copy of the money order; record the date you mailed the 
    order or the time and date of your conversation, and the name of the 
    person you talked with; and any sales slips and shipping receipts. 

        Ask about servicing and refund/return policies and with whom you 
    should correspond if there is a problem. 


                            If You Have Problems

        1)  If you have not received your order as promised or if the 
    item is defective, immediately notify the Seller in writing 
    referring to your order by description, price, date, as well as by 
    account number and order number, if available.  Make sure you keep a 
    copy of the letter. 

        2)  If you complain by phone, send a follow-up letter to confirm 
    what was said. 

        3)  If you think the merchandise is defective, reread your 
    product instructions and product warranty carefully to be sure you 
    don't expect features or performance the product isn't designed to 
    give.  Then contact the Seller for instructions.  Don't return it to 
    the Seller until you have been instructed to do so. 

        4)  When returning merchandise make sure you keep the shipper's 
    receipt or packing slip; your right to be reimbursed for postal cost 
    is determined by store policy. 

        5)  If you have completely discussed your problem with the 
    Seller and are still not satisfied, write to the consumer complaint 
    agency in the Seller's state,  If you paid for the merchandise by 
    credit card, you may have rights to withhold payment under a Federal 
    law called the Fair Credit Billing Act.
