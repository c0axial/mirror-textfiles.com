                        OPERATION CLEAN:
                 RECLAIMING CITY NEIGHBORHOODS

                Dallas, Texas, Police Department 
                         
                                                                  
     Dallas, Texas, faces the same problems as many other cities 
around the country.  It has experienced the devastation of whole 
neighborhoods as drugs, particularly crack cocaine, destroy old 
ways of life and replace them with violence, thievery, and a 
feeling of hopelessness.  One by one, communities in Dallas fell 
to drug dealers, only to become darkened marketplaces of the drug 
trade.                                                            

     To curb the growing tide of urban deterioration, the Dallas 
Police Department embarked on a broad-based program designed to 
reclaim neighborhoods and rid communities of the drug dealers who 
were responsible for most other crimes.  Through Operation CLEAN 
(Community and Law Enforcement Against Narcotics), the Dallas 
Police Department serves as the catalyst for change, coordinating 
the full resources of the city toward target neighborhoods. The 
goal of this campaign is to return control of neighborhoods to 
the law-abiding residents who had been forced to surrender their 
communities to drug dealers.                             

OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS                                            

     The success of Operation CLEAN depends on the total support 
of the police department and city administrators.  Fiscal 
efficiency is very important since many of the operations 
require large outlays of funds that should not be diverted from 
other programs.  Therefore, it is essential that all  
participating city agencies work together to provide required 
services.  Several municipal departments work together to make up 
Operation CLEAN components (the CLEAN Team), and each has 
specific responsibilities:                                        

     *  The police department is responsible for the removal of
        drug dealers, crime prevention training, intensive 24-
        hour personnel deployment, and coordination of Operation
        CLEAN activities.

     *  The fire department checks properties for fire code
        violations and orders the closing of unoccupied
        buildings with safety violations.

     *  The streets and sanitation department is responsible for
        the general clean-up of target areas; clearing alleys,
        trimming trees, and removing discarded furniture used by
        drug dealers.

     *  The housing and neighborhood services department is 
        responsible for strictly enforcing applicable city
        codes, referring unsalvageable properties to the Urban
        Rehabilitation Standards Board for demolition, and
        working with outside groups to obtain vacant lots for
        housing units.

     *  The city attorney's office provides vigorous prosecution
        of code violations and aggressively seizes abandoned
        properties.

     Each component of the CLEAN Team is critical to the success 
of the operation.  The CLEAN Team approaches neighborhood 
involvement with an eye toward addressing quality-of-life issues 
within the target area.                                        

TARGET SELECTION                                                  

     It is very important that a jurisdiction has sufficient 
resources to substantially impact the target area.  The size of 
the neighborhood and the population density must be considered. 
In Dallas, it was determined that a target area should include no 
more than 10 square city blocks.  Preliminary statistics and 
intelligence information concerning crime levels in the target 
area must be accurate so that adequate manpower can be devoted to 
the operation.  The selected area should be large enough so that 
a significant impact can be made, but not so large that available 
resources are insufficient to accomplish the operation's 
objectives.                                                       

     The CLEAN Team established certain criteria that each target 
neighborhood had to meet before it could be accepted into the 
program.  To be considered, an area had to be experiencing a high 
level of drug use and street distribution, a high crime level, 
and a high number of calls for police service.  It was also 
determined that Operation CLEAN would be most effective in 
primarily residential areas, rather than industrial or business 
communities.  This is due largely to the cooperative nature of 
the campaign and the need to ensure participation by all CLEAN 
Team components.  To select an industrial area, for example, 
would limit the participation of the housing and neighborhood 
services department and could result in a loss of interest by the 
department in future operations.                                  

     Another important consideration when selecting a target area 
is the attitude and potential of residents and business leaders 
in the area.  An important element in the operation is the 
willingness of neighborhood residents to take control of their 
own communities.  The greater the willingness of the residents to 
take control, the greater the probability that a long-term 
solution will result.                                 

IMPLEMENTATION                                                    

     Each Operation CLEAN project has basically seven phases.  
The level and type of activity varies in each phase.              

     *  PHASE ONE--The most appropriate target area is selected.  
        Because undercover operations will begin in phase two,
        only selected individuals within the police department
        are involved in this decision process.  The other CLEAN
        Team departments are not advised of the target area
        until phase three.

     *  PHASE TWO--Narcotics Division detectives infiltrate the 
        target area.  Detectives make undercover buys and use
        confidential informants to obtain information for search
        and arrest warrants.  This phase normally lasts 5 to 14
        days.  The objective is to identify as many drug
        dealers, drug distributors, and drug dealing locations
        as possible.

     *  PHASE THREE--This is the first overt enforcement phase, 
        which is initiated by executing simultaneously all
        search and arrest warrants within the target area.
	Uniformed officers, plainclothes detectives, and canine
	and horse patrols saturate the neighborhood so that the
	police department has almost total control of the target
	area.  In Dallas, as many as 100 officers are normally
	involved in this phase.  The news media is contacted
	prior to implementation, so that extensive media
	exposure will accompany this phase.  The objective of
	this phase is to remove as many drug dealers from the
	target area as possible.

     *  PHASE FOUR--Phase Four begins as phase three is being 
	executed. During this phase, eight uniformed officers
	and a sergeant are assigned specifically to the target
	area 24 hours a day.  A total of 24 officers and 3
	sergeants are assigned to the area to cover all three
	shifts.  This phase lasts 2 weeks.

        During this phase, officers take aggressive enforcement
	action against all criminal activity, including traffic
	violations.  The objective is to disrupt the pattern of
	criminal activity that has existed in the area.

        Also during this phase, all CLEAN Team departments meet
	to discuss and visit the target area.  All team members
	become active during phase four.  Personnel from the
	Community Services Division begin to organize local
	residents into Crime Watch groups.  One important
	component of this phase is to inform the residents of
	the target area of the objectives of the CLEAN Team.

     *  PHASE FIVE--This phase is a continuation of phase four,
	but the intensive police contingency is reduced to
	operating 16 hours per day.  Other Operation CLEAN
	efforts continue.  During this phase, which lasts 2
	weeks, control of the target area is gradually
	transferred to legitimate community members.

     *  PHASE SIX--This is a continuation of phase five, except
	that the police contingency is further reduced.  One
	shift of eight officers and a sergeant is assigned
	during the most active 8-hour period, usually in the
	evening.  A walking beat is established and will
	continue after the operation has been completed.  Other
	team members complete their activities.  Increased
	control is transferred to community residents.

     *  PHASE SEVEN--This is the follow-up and evaluation phase.  
	Any needs identified in earlier stages that have not
	been met will be assigned to specific individuals.  Each
	team member critiques the success of the operation and
	cites where future improvement can be made.  An
	operational report is prepared and forwarded to the city
	manager's office.

RESULTS                                                           

     Since the adoption of the program, there have been several 
Operation CLEAN projects.  Operation CLEAN I was initiated on 
March 11, 1989.  The target area was a 6-square block 
neighborhood used by drug dealers and overrun by violence and 
criminal activity.  In the 6-week period prior to March 11th, a 
total of 336 calls for police service had been received from the 
area.  There had been 26 violent crimes and 9 property crimes 
reported during this period.  In addition, the department 
continually received reports of gunfire in the area, both day and 
night.                                                            

     During the execution of 14 search warrants in the third 
phase of Operation CLEAN I, 630 packets of crack cocaine and 76 
packets of marijuana were seized.  Several weapons were also 
confiscated.  During phase four, 289 arrests were made and 200 
traffic citations issued.  An additional 106 arrests were made 
during phase five, and 39 arrests were made in phase six.         

     During the 6 weeks of Operation CLEAN I, the number of calls 
for police service decreased 40 percent and Crime Index offenses 
were reduced by 71 percent.                                       

     When Operation CLEAN I was completed in May 1989, many 
significant changes to the target area had been realized. 
Criminal activity in the target area had been significantly 
reduced, the neighborhood had been cleared of 1,000 cubic yards 
of debris, and construction began on new buildings that replaced 
dilapidated structures.  An active Crime Watch Program was 
created, and most important, concerned citizens regained control 
of their neighborhood.  Overall, there has been a dramatic 
improvement in the quality of life in the target area as a result 
of Operation CLEAN I.                                        

CONCLUSION                                                        

     As Operation CLEAN demonstrates, local law enforcement can 
work with other city departments to improve the quality of life 
for residents living in areas overrun by drug dealing and 
violence.  In Dallas, the police department decided to take a 
lead role in coordinating these efforts.                          

     Because Operation CLEAN is manpower intensive, its 
effectiveness depends on the willingness of both city council and 
police managers to devote appropriate resources.  As past 
Operation CLEAN projects demonstrate, however, these expenditures 
result in reductions in calls for police service and a decrease 
in criminal activity in target areas.  In the long-term, this 
will save patrol and investigative resources that can be used 
elsewhere in the police budget.                                   

     As more communities become affected by the drug problem, 
public calls for innovative programs and new initiatives to 
combat rising criminal activity will require law enforcement 
agencies around the country to rethink existing strategies.  The 
Operation CLEAN program is one approach to reclaim lost 
communities.
