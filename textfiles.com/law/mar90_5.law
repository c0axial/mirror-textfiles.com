                     Arlington, Virginia                                  
                                                                 
     The scenario might go something like the following.  It's 
test day at the police academy. The recruits have just completed 
their first major examination and are anxious to find out how 
they performed.  The training staff is sequestered in a large 
room, seated at long tables covered with stacks of exams in 
front of them.  Calculators are in clear evidence.  The grueling 
task of hand grading the exams begins.  Question by question, 
they trudge through the exam.  To validate test questions (to 
find out if more than half the class has missed a certain 
question), the leader calls out the questions by number to see 
how many of the graders have papers in which a student has missed 
a specific question.  Hands go up, a count is taken, numbers 
recorded, calculators figure averages--some right, some wrong.  
The process goes on for hours, even days.  Meanwhile, the 
students wait.                         
                           
     Does this often-repeated scene have to be?  No--not if the 
recruit curriculum testing-and-evaluation vehicle involves some 
computer assistance.  Such a system exists at the Northern 
Virginia Criminal Justice Academy (NVCJA).  The NVCJA basic 
training staff has developed a systematic process whereby days of 
effort by a training staff are reduced to less than 2 hours using 
one or two people.                                   
             
     This article will discuss how a basic police training 
curriculum can be quickly and efficiently managed with an 
effective, programmatic approach.  Using the NVCJA as a case 
study, the article will first provide some background about the 
academy and then will discuss the hardware, software and the 
process involved in managing the basic recruit curriculum.    

ACADEMY BACKGROUND                                                

     Established in 1965, the Northern Virginia Criminal Justice 
Academy provides training for over 25 criminal justice 
jurisdictions in the Northern Virginia area.  Staffed with 32 
full-time employees, the academy has a leadership cadre of six 
executives, including the director, all of whom are former police 
officers.  Along with a permanent support staff, the academy is 
augmented with officers from each of the participating 
jurisdictions which provide them as instructors on assignment for 
up to 3 years.  As one of nine regional academies in the State of 
Virginia, the academy is governed by a Board of Directors 
comprised of the chiefs of police, sheriffs and city/county 
managers from the larger participating jurisdictions.             

     The academy provides both recruit and inservice training for 
each of the participating police departments and sheriff's 
offices in the region.  Consequently, recruit training consists 
of subject matter leading to three certifications mandated by the 
Commonwealth of Virginia:  Basic Law Enforcement, Basic Civil 
Process-Court Security, and Basic Jailors.  Each year the academy 
graduates approximately 300 students after completion of a 14- to 
18-week course of instruction.                                    

     In order to graduate, each student must successfully 
complete all State- and academy-mandated tests and related 
requirements.  Developed by the Department of Criminal Justice 
Services (DCJS) headquartered in Richmond, VA, State-mandated 
requirements are commonly known as performance objectives (POs). 
These State mandates (POs) are the end result of a formal job 
task analysis, commissioned by the department (DCJS), where the 
various functions of police officers and sheriffs were 
identified.  Developed from this study were over 400 performance 
objectives which form the basis for State-mandated police 
training.  Each training academy must teach and test every 
performance objective and also retest any objective missed by 
students.                                                         

     The academy (NVCJA) also provides State-mandated minimum 
inservice requirements (MIR) training.  The inservice staff 
coordinates with DCJS to ensure that every 2 years, all officers 
receive at least 40 hours of State-mandated training, to include 
instruction in the law.  Taught almost exclusively by outside 
instructors and coordinated by a professional staff, the academy 
offers overs 100 inservice training classes.  While inservice 
training is not the focus of this article, information is 
provided to give a more complete profile of the academy. 

DEVELOPING THE ``STAR'' SYSTEM                                    

     Because the State requires that every student successfully 
pass all of the performance objectives, several problems 
immediately became evident when the academy staff first 
approached the problem of more efficient curriculum management. 
First, how could the academy successfully track each objective 
through the training process to ensure accountability?  Second, 
what type of test construction would be needed to assure the 
administration that mandated objectives would be adequately 
tested and validated?  Third, how could performance-based tests 
be graded within a few hours, not a few days?                     

     With these basic questions in mind, the recruit staff 
concluded that a computer application might offer a workable 
solution.  After preliminary analysis and over 5 years of 
refinement, the Student Testing and Records (STAR) System was 
developed and is presently used at the academy.  With this 
program as the basic software package, the testing system 
incorporates several components:                                  

     *  An optical mark reader (SCANTRON), which automatically 
        scores each exam and feeds the raw data directly into a
        computer  

     *  An additional software program which provides both
        database and spreadsheet capabilities

     *  An IBM compatible personal computer with 640K RAM memory
        and a hard drive, and finally

     *  A laser printer for letter quality reports                   

     This system costs less than $5,000.  By using this 
relatively simple but highly effective system, the curriculum 
manager is now able to better manage the basic training 
curriculum from tracking to testing to validation of each 
State-mandated performance objective.                             

MANAGING THE PROCESS                                              

     At the core of the academy's curriculum and testing system 
are the POs.  Simply put, the tests must ensure that each student 
masters each State-mandated PO.  Thus, test construction and 
administration are vital to the integrity of the academy's 
curriculum management process.  Performance-objective 
accountability and the testing process are the primary 
responsibilities of the academy's curriculum manager.  From 
lesson plan review to test construction and administration, the 
curriculum manager is the academy's point man with regard to 
accuracy and accountability.                           

Constructing Tests                                                

     All basic training examinations are constructed by the 
curriculum manager.  It is also his responsibility to analyze and 
validate all test results for each recruit.  The testing process 
begins with the basic lesson plan, which is then reviewed and 
approved by academy management.  Written by staff instructors, 
each lesson plan must be revised and updated at the end of each 
training session.  They must also contain those specific POs 
mandated by the State and appropriate for that block of 
instruction.  Test questions flow from and can be directly 
tracked to POs found in each lesson plan, thus assuring test 
accountability.  Staff instructors, accountable to both the 
students and the curriculum manager, are responsible for ensuring 
each PO is adequately taught.  Student performance, at test 
time, usually will reflect whether this situation has, in fact, 
occurred.                                                         

     At the end of each specified testing time period, the 
curriculum manager begins to prepare a test that spans several 
disciplines and many instructors.  How the test construction 
takes place mechanically is simple and is coordinated by the 
curriculum manager.  First, he speaks with all instructors to 
verify that their test questions, which are based on the mandated 
POs, have been taught and are part of a pre-existing database.    

     Second, the curriculum manager constructs a rough-draft test 
based on pertinent subject area questions stored in the database.  
The draft exam is then reviewed by all the respective instructors 
for their final updates and edits.  This phase of the process is 
accomplished with a high degree of attention to exam security.  
At this point, if an instructor did not teach a specific 
objective, the instructor advises the curriculum manager who 
deletes that PO from the current exam.  It will, however, be 
tested on a later exam, so as to comply with State mandates.      

     Third, the draft exam is then edited by the curriculum 
manager based on specific verbal and written feedback from each 
instructor.  The final exam is then constructed, with the rough 
draft copy kept on file for documentation and accountability.     

Administering Tests                                               

     To ensure uniformity and test security, all exams are passed 
out simultaneously to proctoring staff members who immediately 
take them to the test sites.  Proctors physically remain at each 
test site for the exam's duration to ensure test integrity.  Once 
the tests are passed out, a staff member reads a test cover sheet 
containing complete test instructions.  Once the instructional 
sheet has been read, the students begin their exams.              

     The tests are primarily multiple choice with very few 
true-and- false questions.  Students fill out their answers on an 
answer sheet with a #2 pencil so that it can easily be read by 
the optical mark reader.                                          

     When each recruit section is finished, all exams are 
returned and accounted for by the curriculum manager.  A single 
missing exam is treated as a compromise to the test's integrity 
and the results are then deemed invalid.  This has yet to happen 
at the academy while using this system.                    

Scoring Tests                                                     

     To score each examination, the assistant director for basic 
training and the curriculum manager work as a team to complete 
the effort.  First, the curriculum manager determines each answer 
sheet is properly completed.  If an answer sheet is incomplete, 
the recruit officer is called in and asked to make the required 
corrections.  This pertains only to basic identification 
information on the form and not to incomplete test answers. 
Should a defective answer sheet get into the system, the computer 
will automatically reject it when it is scanned.  Multiple 
answers, unclear erasures, or answer spaces left blank can cause 
an answer sheet to be defective.  In each case, the computer 
indicates the nature of the problem, the location of the problem, 
and will inquire what the user wishes it to do regarding the 
defect.                                                           

     To prepare the system for the grading mode, a master answer 
sheet (previously prepared by the curriculum manager from the 
master exam) is scanned.  This sheet will provide the test basis 
from which all student answer sheets will be graded.  Each 
student's answer sheet is then quickly fed into the scanner, with 
the data automatically stored on the recruit section's 
information disk.  The scanning process takes approximately 3-5 
minutes for a section of 25 to 30 recruits.  After the scanning 
step is completed, the computer produces a raw scores average 
sheet which is a rank-order listing of each class member based on 
the computer-generated averages of correct responses.  This 
immediately shows the curriculum manager what the statistical 
range of the class is and if he has any individual failures to 
review.                                                           

     The next step in the grading process is item analysis and 
test validation.  To determine the relative fairness of each exam 
question, the computer automatically produces a distractor 
analysis document.  The computer automatically views each 
question, and where 50% or more of the class get a question 
wrong, the question is reviewed and the instructor consulted.  If 
he or she feels the material was adequately covered, the question 
will remain.  If the question is tough, but fair, it stays in the 
exam.  However, where there exists reasonable doubt that the 
students were genuinely confused by the question, it is 
eliminated from the overall test score.  The benefit of a doubt 
is always given to the student.  After all the eliminated 
questions are determined, they are subtracted from the original 
total to formulate a net basis for computing the final test 
scores.  Students must score 70% or better to pass.      

Generating Reports                                                

     As an integral part of the process, the computer generates 
several other reports.  First, it produces a subject mastery 
report (a report card) to each student which tells them how they 
did in each subject area.  Second, it produces the same report 
but in a cumulative format, which is used by staff members for 
counseling and remedial training.  Third, a test answer sheet is 
generated which tells the recruits not only the correct answer 
but also what answer they put on their answer sheet.  This report 
also indicates that questions are State-mandated and require 
retesting if missed.  This capability provides a vehicle that    
allows identification of missed POs and retest on a timely basis 
by the curriculum manager, a procedure required by the State.     

     In short, using the software in the STAR program, the 
computer can generate any aspects of the testing process into a 
hard copy for the student staff member within an average of 2 
hours--from start to finish.                                      

Maintaining Security                                             

      The testing, grading, question database, lesson plans and 
section data records are maintained on both floppy disk and hard 
drive.  As an added security feature, the curriculum manager's 
office is locked during non-office hours and backup disks and 
access codes are secured.  Hard copies of exams, rough drafts, 
and actual lesson plans are likewise kept secure.                 

CONCLUSION                                                        

     A well-managed curriculum begins with a good job task 
analysis and performance objectives that arise from such 
analysis.  In turn, lesson plans and student activities should be 
based on those performance objectives and must be tested 
accurately.  Unfortunately, all too often, testing and tracking 
of such objectives get so cumbersome that administrators of an 
academy or educational institution do what they can, not what 
they should.  However, if applied meaningfully to the task, the 
computer offers welcome relief to training administrators.  The 
NVCJA has, over the years, tried to develop and refine a process 
that adequately manages a complex curriculum process without 
hamstringing the staff--a compromise that is working very well.
