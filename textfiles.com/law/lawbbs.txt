     SYSOP: Joe Karl               a/k/a "H.A.D.D."

Apparently a new board established as part of a nationwide effort to gain
equity for husbands in domestic relations disputes.  I didn't see any evidence
of lawyers getting involved - strange!  The BBS file area contains a few sets
of domestic relations do-it-yourself forms and even the residence phone
numbers of **ALL** the domestic relations judges in the Seattle area (sort of
makes you wonder...).

208-323-8626  ID  Boise            Boise Police Department BBS
     SYSOP:  Sgt. Mike Worley

Now here's a crimestopping idea.  BPD is on-line.  On this BBS you'll find
public reports of stolen vehicles, bulletins re protecting the home, and a few
files available for downloading (1986 NFL Schedule was one; are football pools
legal in Boise?).  The board is well run and seems to be getting much traffic.
I'm certain it's also used in "private conference mode" by various officers on
the beat w/Model 100's, etc.

212-409-4194  NY  New York City    Softlaw
     SYSOP: Ed Wolf

This BBS supports law office software developed (apparently) and marketed by
its SYSOP, Attorney Ed Wolf.  The software is largely of a "substantive systems"
nature and includes such packages as Bankruptcy, Corporate Formation, and
Real Estate transfers.  Although I haven't seen any, the description of these
offerings lead me to believe that they are each "driven" by some form of
structured data manager (ie, dBaseIII or its ilk) which merges the data with
forms and reports.  There's a substantial charge for using the BBS - but it
is really for consulting time with the SYSOP, and not simply just for the
privilege of calling his computer.

213-553-1473  CA  Los Angeles      LEGACY
    SYSOP: Bob Kohn

Obviously a "seasoned board" which has been around some time.  It contains a
host of do-it-yourself forms (Corporations, Wills, Domestic Relations, etc.)
and several "law review" (but more readable) articles about computers,
technology and related legal issues.  I couldn't find any "freeware" but there
is plenty of full-text recent legislation material, product reviews, and other
useful stuff.  I suspect one purpose of the BBS is to market the services of
its sponsors - but, if it is, it's a very low-keyed pitch.

214-522-1963  TX  Dallas           Rice & Livingston LAWSIG
    SYSOP:  Gerald Livingston

Here's a marketing board, pure and simple.  It's very user-friendly, open to
the public, and contains good editorial and informational content.  The
downloadable file areas need a little cleaning up, but what's there are the
most current versions of PC-WRITE, PROCOMM, etc.  It apparently gets a lot of
DFW traffic and is doubtless providing good service to the public and good
exposure to its lawyer sponsors.  Lawyers trying to decide between publishing
yet another ho-hum firm brochure and establishing a BBS should look at this
one.

215-569-6975  PA  Philadelphia     LEX-PC Lawtech
    SYSOP:  Mark Pinkstone

This Board is run by two law office consultants and is full of goodies for
their clients and anyone else who wants to log on.  Perhaps the high point of
this BBS is the Pinkstone & Margueres Newsletter, which is an excellent survey
of what's happening in the PC world of interest to lawyers.  There's also an
abundance of downloadable files.  This is a first-rate effort - and deserves
more attention.  Who knows, lawyers visiting this BBS may discover that
consultants can be practical, too.  [QUESTION:  What does a steer do in a
herd of cows?  ANSWER:  Not much.  He's just a consultant.]  Here may be your
chance to discover otherwise....

217-352-6118  IL  Champagne        LAWBoard
     SYSOP:  Keith Hayes

This is a multi-purpose BBS.  It's operated by Grosser & Hayes - a small firm
with two offices (and the perennial problem of communication between them).
The BBS was installed to allow the lawyers to keep in touch with each other,
trade trial notes, workload, and generally eliminate the need for them to be
in the same room with each other in order to get the benefits of a "group"
practice.  They use Radio Shack Model 100's, PC's on their desks, and PC's
at home - and the BBS holds it all together by allowing them to swap text
files, EMAIL, etc.   And then the clients started using it to avoid the
inevitable telephone tag syndrome - and then the firm opened it to the general
public (although they really haven't made a big publicity push in this area).
From little acorns....

Alas, this (the first known BBS run by a lawyer) is currently off-line.  Paul
says he's looking for hacker-proof software (Paul: try our choice - PCBoard)
and is also putting his time into establishing LAWSIG on The Source.

WOW!  Here's one with something for everyone.  It's both a marketing board
(public bulletins include "DUI - What to Do When Arrested", "How To Make an
Effective Consumer Complaint", "Starting a Business", "Incorporation Outline",
"Corporate Pension Guide") and a collection of downloadable forms suitable for
lawyers.  I hope to get more time to spend on this one.

413-783-2714  MA  Springfield      My BBS
     SYSOP:  Charles Yates

A PCBoard ver. 10 system run by a second year law student from Western New
England College School of Law (Class of '88).  The BBS is a "general purpose"
one open to all callers.  But there is a specific "Law Conference" into which
everyone is invited for forum discussions (many about the liability of SYSOPS
who have illegal messages and copy righted material posted on their BBS's).

612-872-2352  MN  Minneapolis      LAWCAT
     SYSOP:  Paula Giese

Truly an "exciting" BBS run by someone loaded with effervescence.  Paula is in
the business of consulting with law firms - and I'd love to sit in on one of her
visits.  There's a ton of "current events" reporting in the various bulletins
she maintains - and plenty of software to download.  The BBS is often busy - but
it's worth the wait.

701-293-5973  ND  Fargo            Law Line
     SYSOP  Loren Jones

This is an active "hobbyist" BBS which happens to be run by a lawyer, Loren
Jones.  There's a special Law Conference on it, but the thrust of the board
is general purpose.  Access to Law Conference is limited, so don't forget to
ask for entrance by leaving a MSG to the SYSOP.

713-665-5556  TX  Houston        Ed Hopper's BBS
     SYSOP:  Ed Hopper

This board, although run by a lawyer, is largely a BBS designed to help people using
AT&T microcomputers.  As such, it's more of a "UG" (Users' Group) than it is a
BBS devoted to lawyers.  There is, however, a specific "Law Conference" going
on - run by New York Softlaw BBS SYSOP, Ed Wolf.  The BBS runs on PCBoard ver.
10 software.  It contains relatively few downloadable files but, being in
metro Houston and having a certain AT&T "calling", it seems pretty active.

     SYSOP:  Gene Siegel

Here's a free-wheeling California-style BBS open to anyone (use aliases, CB
handles, anything goes) system run largely as a public service (but possibly
with some marketing motives) by a firm that apparently enjoys controversy.
The filespace isn't too well organized (many of the entries have no
description) but the reason you go is to read the "editorials."
