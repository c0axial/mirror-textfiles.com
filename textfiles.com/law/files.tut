TUTORIAL-- FILE TRANSFER LIABILITY

A few stories about the law. Don't shut down your BBS and hide in 
a sanitized packing crate. Although BBS systems have significant 
liability in these areas, the liability is manageable-- with the 
proper disclaimers and procedures, which will occupy the second 
half of this lesson.

Scenario # 1-- The awful download


A BBS receives an upload of an innocuous looking program. Because 
the sysop is careful, all files are scanned with industry 
standard virus detection programs. The file passes the check and 
is posted for download.

The innocuous program is in fact virus free. However, it is so 
badly written (an array is dimensioned too large, and bumps into 
space occupied by other programs and the operating system) that 
it locks up the computer of the user. As a result, the user 
doesn't finish a job on time and loses $ 1,000.

Who is liable for the negligent programming? The answer may 
surprise you---

the author, and quite arguably the BBS itself!

If the user has "donated" or "paid" a fee for use of the BBS, the 
download can be interpreted as a sale of a program. The Uniform 
Commercial Code provides that unless warranties are disclaimed 
that all products sold by "merchants" carry a warranty of 
"merchantability" and other warranties. Under the law of 
"products liability" a person who creates, as well as a person 
who DISTRIBUTES items that will be used by consumers 

Who is a merchant? Any one with specialized knowledge within a 
field is a merchant. Thus, a rug seller is charged with knowing, 
and behaving like someone who knows the rug trade. As a BBS 
operator, you are arguably a merchant in the area of computers 
and software.

Warranty liability can be lessened, or even excluded by the 
proper use of disclaimers. However, under the modern law of 
products liability, warranty liability cannot be disclaimed if 
a party introduces a product into the stream of commerce and it 
is used without inspection for flaws.

Therefore, if the BBS system requires that users inspect the 
program for flaws, it is no longer subject to products liability 
under the products liability law. Therefore, our disclaimers 
require that the user test the file himself.
