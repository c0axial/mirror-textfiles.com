January 1991                                                      
 
                                                                  
                         POLICE PRACTICES 
                       MOBILE COMMAND POSTS                             
                        
                                           
     As service providers, law enforcement agencies respond to a 
broad range of emergency situations--from street crimes to 
sexual assaults, from traffic accidents to domestic disturbances.  
As a rule, most emergencies are handled by one or more responding 
units, generally in their own patrol districts.                   
 
     However, what happens when a law enforcement agency must 
respond to a major disaster, such as a plane crash or a building 
collapse, that requires hundreds of workers to handle both rescue 
efforts and crowd and traffic control?  Unless the department 
serves a major metropolitan area where officials can muster 
multiple agencies in a short period of time, the result is 
usually an uncontrolled, disorganized response.  One way for 
smaller departments to avert this type of response is to modify a 
van into a mobile command post that can be used to organize under 
one command during full-scale incidents.                          
 
     A case in point is when the Cocoa Beach, Florida, Fire 
Department responded to the collapse of a condominium that was
under construction.  Eleven people were killed and 23 persons
were injured.  The rescue operation, which lasted over 60 hours,
required approximately 400 rescue workers and the assistance of
50 private, volunteer, and government agencies.  Based on the
information gathered from this incident, the Cocoa Beach Fire
Department set out to equip such a mobile command post to use at
the scene of major operations.  Since budget constraints
prohibited the purchase of two vehicles, one for police use and
one for fire use, the agencies worked together to modify the van
to meet the needs of both departments.
 
THE VEHICLE                                                       
 
     The departments purchased a van with a 6-cylinder engine, 
automatic transmission, heavy-duty suspension system, 
posi-traction rear end, and heavy-duty cooling and electrical 
systems.  Adding heavy-duty air shocks was the only necessary 
modification.  These were added to accommodate the additional 
weight caused by the command console and the large amount of 
equipment that is stored in the vehicle.                      
 
COMMAND CONSOLE                                                   
 
     The command console consists of a slide-out work desk, file 
drawers, storage spaces, communications station, and an
equipment and manpower status board.  A small generator plugs
into the console, making it self-contained, and if necessary,
the console can be removed from the vehicle.
 
COMMUNICATIONS                                                    
 
     In addition to three law enforcement radio frequencies, the 
16-channel mobile radio communications unit includes the radio 
frequencies of local fire and emergency medical services.  There
is also a portable weather monitor, a Coast Guard marine radio,
an 80-channel programmable scanner and a citizens band radio.
The citizens band radio also serves as a base unit for a field
communications system to allow for uninterrupted communications
among management team members.  Twenty walkie-talkies, each with
three frequencies and a range of 1 mile, allow the incident
commander to communicate with officers in the field when
necessary.
 
     Telephone communications include a portable cellular 
telephone that is connected to the vehicle's main electrical
system.  This cellular phone is backed up by two high-capacity
portable batteries and a built-in charging unit.  Two additional
telephones with 1000 feet of hard line and two, 250-foot
portable lines allow for communications to be set up from a
structure nearest to the scene.
 
MANAGEMENT TEAM DOSSIERS AND RESOURCE FILES                       
 
     Large vinyl folders contain all of the information, 
materials, and supplies necessary for specific personnel
assignments, such as public information officer, law enforcement
liaison, medical officer, and communications officer.
 
     The folders hold water-resistant fluorescent vests that 
identify each position, flashlights, pens, paper, and a 
laminated primary assignment sheet that outlines specific duties 
of each assignment.                                               
 
     The resource files, which are updated yearly, provide a 
listing of manpower, equipment, and services available from 
adjoining counties.  Also included are full-scale aerial 
photographs of the entire city and corresponding sketch maps of 
each photograph from which to work.                        
 
MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT                                           
 
     In addition to fire and disaster-related equipment, the van 
stores a victim identification kit, a radiological monitoring 
kit, electronic listening devices, and photographic and video 
equipment.  It also holds emergency medical first-responder 
equipment, such as a trauma box, splints, and an oxygen supply.   
 
     For use by the police department, the van stows 
identification vests, police department grid books, maps, 
procedures manuals, and police department magnetic signs that 
fit over fire department insignias.  A green strobe light and 
additional command post signs are also available to law 
enforcement personnel. 
 
CONCLUSION                                                        
 
     The mobile command post vehicle is an excellent example of 
how emergency services can work together to meet a common goal.  
Should there be another disaster, the City of Cocoa Beach now has 
the capacity to respond in an efficient, organized manner.
