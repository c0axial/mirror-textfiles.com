                            Wildlife Protection

                        Arizona Sets a Good Example

Arizona has a brochure called Operation Game Thief. It lists various
rewards for information on poachers of certain animals, birds and fish.
They pay rewards as follows:

$350 for Elk, Bighorn Sheep, Buffalo, and Bald Eagles. $250 for Deer,
Antelope, Bear, Turkey, Lion, and Javelina, or any critter on the
endangered species list

$50 to $150 for other species of wildlife and attendant acts of vandalism.

                               Other Rewards

In addition, several sportsmen's groups provide reward funds that allow
payments ranging from $50 to $1,000 in cases where, under State law,
Operation Game Thief is not able to pay. The rewards are, nevertheless, for
cases where the tip was originally provided through Operation Game Thief.
Decisions on these are made in consultation with the boards of member
organizations:

Operation Game Thief brochures are printed and distributed by Arizona
department of Game and Fish. The number to call for Arizona's Operation
Game Thief is 1-800-352-0700.

Most States have similar rewards, also under the name Game Thief, or
similar names, and sponsored by various organizations.

By the way, various places throughout California, Idaho, Nevada and Arizona
offer a $1,000 reward for information on poachers. I believe all States
have similar rewards, and almost every store that sells hunting and fishing
licenses probably know of a person, group, sheriff, or local DFG warden.
They can advise you if there are any rewards available. They'll also tell
you the number to call or person to contact. If all else fails, remember
WE-TIP. In California dial 1 (800) 78-CRIME, or outside of California dial
1 (800) 73-CRIME.

The following hotline numbers were noticed in The American Hunter, one of
the NRA's official publications. While they may or may not pay a reward, if
you just want to blow the whistle on poachers, here's the 800 numbers to
call:

                   Park Rangers Asked to Don Body Armor

"GRAND CANYON, Arizona - Skyrocketing crime in some of America's wilderness
vacation spots has compelled the National Park Service to urge rangers to
wear bulletproof vests.

Park Service officials say car thieves, drug smugglers and gangs flourish
in parks because the remote areas are difficult to patrol and tourists, who
believe the sites are immune to crime, take fewer precautions in protecting
their property.

Although crime statistics are sketchy, mounting incidents show park areas
are not immune from the worst of urban crime.

Last year park ranger Robert L. McGhee, 50, was shot to death after making
a traffic stop on a park road in Gulf Islands National Park in Mississippi.

In the past year, rangers shot two men to death in separate armed battles
at Lake Mead National Recreational Area near Las Vegas, Nevada.

Drugs have also played a part in park crime waves. A major drug smuggling
operation was uncovered in Big Bend National Park in Texas, and a
laboratory for the illegal drug methamphetamine was found in Joshua Tree
National Park in California. Remote areas on BLM land is often used to set
up drug factories, or to grow marijuana.

A pocketbook, "Outlaw" (The true story of Claude Dallas), by Jeff Long,
tells about a self-styled mountain man who lived off the land hunting and
trapping in the Idaho/Nevada/Oregon triangle (Owyhee region) in 1980.
Claude shot and killed two Department of Fish and Game wardens. He was
caught, prosecuted, went to prison, and escaped in 1986 and is still on the
loose, probably in the same area.

The book has a surprising statistic quoted, and a cautionary comment for
anyone considering being a game warden or a CrimeFighter specializing in
patrolling Parks and Forests:

"The Wyoming Fish and Game Department report showed that a game warden has
roughly SEVEN times the chance of getting shot at or threatened with a gun
as a regular police officer, and almost NINE times as great a chance of
dying if assaulted."

With those statistics, the Department of Fish and Game should up the ante
from $1,000 and make the reward $10,000 for the arrest of any poacher, and
lawmakers should upgrade poaching from a misdemeanor to a felony - to make
it commensurate with the increased seriousness and risk.

Canadians have similar problems. A recent Canadian TV program featured a
story about poachers in Quebec. It mentioned the increasing number of
incidents that have taken place in the last few years. Many game wardens
have been threatened, beaten, and hospitalized, or shot and killed by
poachers. Until recently, game wardens in Canada carried no firearms but
after the last incident mentioned on the TV show, where a game warden was
shot to death by a crossbow, the need for well-armed law enforcement
personnel in parks and forests as well as urban areas are now obvious and
recommended.

CrimeFighters (and campers, fishermen, etc.) are advised to have the means
to protect themselves in remote areas where there are few armed rangers to
provide them with protection. CrimeFighters on park patrols should likewise
carry a weapon for self defense in case they're discovered and a poacher
makes a life-threatening move against them.

When you decide to patrol a national forest or national park, stop at the
ranger station and read the park rules concerning weapons. If in doubt,
check with the ranger or game warden. Obey the posted rules.

Have a chat with the ranger first. He'll be more likely to believe you when
you call to report poaching or other illegal activity. When talking to the
ranger or game warden, ask for their telephone number or CB channel that
you can use to give them a call.

                  Patience is a Virtue (and a Necessity)

Stake-outs and covert surveillance require endless patience, That's an
accepted part of a lawman's job. The U.S. Customs or the Border Patrol
officers describe their job as "99% boredom, with 1% sheer terror."
CrimeFighters on stake-outs should remember that. If you keep a discreet
distance and not expose yourself to dangerous situations, you can avoid the
5% sheer terror. That way it might be 99% boredom and 1% joyful excitement.
The latter occurs when you obtain evidence resulting in an arrest and a
conviction and qualify for the rewards.

Remember: "... a game warden has roughly SEVEN times the chance of getting
shot at or threatened with a gun as a regular police officer, and almost
NINE times as great a chance of dying if assaulted."

Whenever possible, call the police or law enforcement agencies to make the
arrest. Keep a low profile. Never expose yourself to unnecessary physical
danger or lawsuits. If you're a full-time CrimeFighter, and in it mainly
for the money, don't jeopardize your life or bank account by sticking your
neck out.  Your job is to supply the information to law enforcement agents.
Let a lawman make the arrest.

In addition to Fish and Game poachers, there's another type of poacher who
is even more dangerous: those who threaten the extinction of wildlife
listed as endangered species. There are Federal laws that offer rewards for
information leading to their arrest and conviction.

Section 1375 Penalties

(a)(1) Any person who violates any provision of this title or of any permit
or regulation issued thereunder may be assessed a civil penalty by the
Secretary of not more than $10,000 for each such violation. No penalty
shall be assessed unless such person is given notice and opportunity for a
hearing with respect to such violation. Each unlawful taking or importation
shall be a separate offense. Any such civil penalty may be remitted or
mitigated by the Secretary for good cause shown. Upon any failure to pay a
penalty assessed under this subsection, the Secretary may request the
Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court of the
United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or
transacts business to collect the penalty and such court shall have

individual for his own personal or family use (which does not include
importation as an accommodation to others or for sale or other commercial
use), the Secretary may, in lieu of instituting a proceeding under
paragraph (1), allow the individual to abandon the mammal or product under
procedures to be prescribed by the Secretary, to the enforcement officer at
the port of entry.

(b) Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this title or of any
permit or regulations issued thereunder shall, upon conviction, be fined

Section 1376 Seizure and forfeiture of Cargo

(a) Application of consistent provisions.

Any vessel or other conveyance subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States that is employed in any manner in the unlawful taking of any marine
mammal shall have its entire cargo or the monetary value thereof subject to
the seizure and forfeiture. All provisions of law relating to the seizure,
judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of cargo for violation of the customs
laws, the disposition of such cargo, and the proceeds form the sale
thereof, and the remission or mitigation of any such forfeiture, shall
apply with respect to the cargo of any vessel or other conveyance seized in
connection with the unlawful taking of a marine mammal insofar as such
provisions of law are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions
of this title.

(b) Penalties.

Any vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United Sates that is employed
in any manner in the unlawful taking of any marine mammal shall be liable
for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000. Such penalty shall be
assessed by the district court of the United States having jurisdiction
over the vessel. Clearance of a vessel against which a penalty has been
assessed, from a port of the United Sates, may be withheld until such
penalty is paid, or until a bond or otherwise satisfactory surety is

may be recovered by action in rem in the district court of the United
States having jurisdiction over the vessel.

(c) Reward for information leading to conviction.

Upon the recommendation of the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury is

eligible for payment under this section.

                                * * * * * *

Comment: If any breach of law includes a felony, and the crime was based on
financial gain, RICO law may also apply. If that's possible, a CrimeFighter
should weigh the anticipated reward to be paid compared to what might be
gained by prosecution under RICO law where 50% of the fines and forfeitures
from civil and criminal suits may be obtained. Be the prosecutor when you
can to assure substantial rewards via fines and forfeitures, unless they
are expected to be minimal. In that case, let the Rangers do the
prosecution and apply for appropriate rewards.

without a warrant for any violation of this Act if he has reasonable
grounds to believe that the person to be arrested is committing the
violation in his presence or view, and may execute and serve any arrest
warrant, search warrant, or other warrant or civil or criminal process
issued by any officer or court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement of
this Act. Such person so authorized may search and seize, with or without a
warrant, as authorized by law. Any fish, wildlife, property, or item so
seized shall be held by any person authorized by the Secretary, the
Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Department in which the
Coast Guard is operating pending disposition of civil or criminal
proceedings, or the institution of an action in rem for forfeiture of such
fish, wildlife, property, or item, pursuant to paragraph (4) of  this
subsection; except that the Secretary may, in lieu of holding such fish,
wildlife, property, or item, permit the owner or consignee to post a bond
or other surety satisfactory to the Secretary, but upon forfeiture of any
such property to the United States, or the abandonment or waiver of any
claim to any property, it shall be disposed of (other than sale to the
general public) by the Secretary in such a manner, consistent with the
purposes of this Act, as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.

(4)(A) All fish or wildlife or plants taken, possessed, sold, purchased,
offered for sale or purchase, transported, delivered, received, carried,
shipped, exported, or imported contrary to the provisions of this Act, any
regulations made pursuant thereto, or any permit or certificate issued
hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States.

(B) All guns, traps, nets and other equipment, vessels, vehicles, aircraft,
and other means of transportation used to aid the taking, possessing,
selling, purchasing, offering for sale or purchase, transporting,

fish or wildlife or plants in violation of this Act, any regulation made
pursuant thereto, or any permit or certificate issued thereunder shall be
subject to forfeiture to the United States upon conviction of a criminal
violation pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this Act.

(5) All provisions of law relating to the seizure, forfeiture and
condemnation of a vessel for violation of the customs laws, the disposition
of such vessel or the proceeds form the sale thereof, and the remission or
mitigation of such forfeiture, shall apply to the seizures and forfeitures
incurred or alleged to have been incurred, under the provisions of this
Act, insofar as such provisions of law are applicable and not inconsistent
with the provisions of this Act.; except that all powers, rights, and
duties conferred or imposed by the customs laws upon any officer or
employee of the Treasury Department shall, for the purposes of this Act, be
exercised or performed by the Secretary or by such persons as he may
designate.

(6) The Attorney General of the United States may seek to enjoin any person
who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this Act or
regulations issued under authority thereof.

(f) Regulations. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the
Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, are

connected with permits or certificates authorized by this Act including
processing applications and reasonable inspections, and with the transfer,
board, handling, or storage of fish or wildlife or plants and evidentiary
items seized and forfeited under this Act. All such fees collected pursuant

appropriation which is current and chargeable for the cost of furnishing
the service. Appropriated funds may be expended pending the reimbursement
from parties in interest.

(g) Citizen suits.

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection any person may
commence a civil suit on his own behalf -

(A) to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other
governmental instrumentality or agency (to the extent permitted by the
eleventh amendment to the constitution), who is alleged to be in violation
of any provision of this Act or regulation issued under the authority
thereof; or
