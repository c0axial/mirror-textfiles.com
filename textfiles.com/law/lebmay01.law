                     William S. Sessions                                    
                        FBI Director                                         
                                                                  
     When President Dwight D. Eisenhower established Law Day by 
Presidential Proclamation in 1958, he stated, ``It is fitting 
that the American people should remember with pride and 
vigilantly guard the great heritage of liberty, justice, and 
equality under law....''  Law Day has since become an occasion 
for Americans to rededicate themselves to these ideals.           

     This year's Law Day theme, ``Generations of Justice,'' 
encourages us in law enforcement to focus on the youth and the   
elderly.  These two generations of Americans are particularly 
vulnerable to criminal elements because they are often helpless 
to defend themselves.                                             

     This theme takes on special significance when we consider 
that the generation gap in America is widening.  Those aged 65 
and older are the fastest growing segment of America's 
population; yet, they are perhaps the most forgotten.  
Unfortunately, the elderly are easy targets for violence and 
crime because they are vulnerable.  Many live in terror of being 
attacked on the streets and have become virtual prisoners in 
their homes.  Other senior citizens suffer from the psychological 
and financial abuse inflicted on them by caretakers and even 
family members.                                                   

     The children of today, America's most precious resource,  
are also innocent victims.  Tragic cases of child abuse, neglect, 
and sexual exploitation continue to occur.  Even unborn children 
suffer abuse from the ravages of drugs that plague our society.   

     While safeguarding these two generations of Americans is not 
easy, one key element to success is cooperation.  However, 
cooperation should be stressed not only among members of the 
criminal justice profession but also between law enforcement and 
the community.                                                    

     Preventing the abuse of America's youth and its elderly 
requires the total commitment of the entire criminal justice 
system--from the police officer on the street to the highest 
court in the land.  Police, prosecutors, and judges must bring 
the full force of the criminal justice system to bear against 
those who threaten the well-being of both the young and the old.  

     Yet, the battle against abuse is not law enforcement's 
alone.  Positive citizen action is society's first line of 
defense.  Through support of and cooperation with the criminal 
justice system, citizens can enhance law enforcement's 
effectiveness.  Law enforcement must work with the public to 
promote crime prevention to the elderly.  We also must make a 
full-fledged effort to educate our youth to the dangers of drugs.  
By making citizens aware of the problem of abuse, they learn to 
recognize it and hopefully to prevent it.  Awareness, education, 
and prevention are three critical areas that can make a 
difference in the quality of life for not only youths and the 
elderly, but also for all generations of Americans.               

     The first step in meeting the challenges of abuse is to 
focus on the seriousness of the problem and what we can do about 
it.  Only then, through continuous citizen support and 
cooperation, combined with the best efforts of law enforcement, 
can we maintain and preserve the Constitutional rights and 
freedoms guaranteed to all Americans, young and old alike.  As we 
commemorate Law Day this year, let us reaffirm our pledge to 
uphold the Constitution and ensure that we nuture and sustain the 
principles of Law Day every day of the year.
