/* The Model Penal Code (MPC) is arguably the most important work
on criminal law in the past 30 years. This Model Code has been
used as the basis of many state's criminal codes. New Jersey and
Pennsylvania have adopted the MPC as their criminal code.
However, sections of the MPC or slight re-writes are used by
virtually every state. The MPC's prohibition on "obscenity" and
distribution of obscenity follows. */

Section 251.4. Obscenity.

(1) Obscene Defined. Material is obscene if, considered as a
whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a
shameful or morbid interest, in nudity, sex or excretion, and if
in addition it goes substantially beyond customary limits of
candor in describing or representing such matters. Predominant
appeal shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults unless
it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children or
other specially susceptible audience. Undeveloped photographs,
molds, printing plates, and the like, shall be deemed obscene
notwithstanding that processing or other acts may be required to
make the obscenity patent or to disseminate it.

(2) Offenses. Subject to the affirmative defenses provided in 
Subsection (3), a person commits a misdemeanor if he knowingly or 
recklessly:

(a) sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, 
deliver or provide, any obscene writing, picture, records or 
other representation or embodiment of the obscene; or

(b) presents or directs an obscene play, dance or performance, or 
participates in that portion thereof which makes its obscene; or

(c) publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available any obscene 
material; or

(d) possesses any obscene material for purposes of sale or other 
commercial dissemination; or

(e) sells, advertises or otherwise commercially disseminates 
material, whether or not obscene, by representing or suggesting 
that it is obscene.

A person who disseminates or possesses obscene material in the 
course of his business is presumed to do so knowingly or 
recklessly.

(3) Justifiable and Non-Commercial Private Dissemination. It is 
an affirmative defense to prosecution under this Section that 
dissemination was restricted to:

(a) institutions or persons having scientific, educational, 
governmental or other similar justification for possessing 
obscene material; or

(b) non-commercial dissemination to personal associates of the 
actor.

/* Okay, so something is "obscene." It is nevertheless 
permissible to distribute it to "personal associates" if there is 
no commercial element to the distribution. Accordingly, in MPC or 
MPC based states, a not for profit BBS could distribute even items 
that are ""obscene"" among ""personal associates." This is the 
"live and let live: exception to the law. The document generator 
contains a form for persons to apply for access to an adult area. 
The form requires that the users do not commercially exploit the 
pictures they receive. */

(4) Evidence; Adjudication of Obscenity. In any prosecution under 
this Section evidence shall be admissible to show:

(a) the character of the audience for which the material was 
designed or to which it was directed;

(b) what the predominant appeal of the material would be for 
ordinary adults or any special audience to which it was directed, 
and what effect, if any, it would probably have on conduct of 
such people;

(c) artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits 
of the material;

(d) the degree of public acceptance of the material in the United 
States;

(e) appeal to the prurient interest, or absence thereof, in 
advertising or other promotion of the material; and

(f) the good repute of the author, creator, publisher or other 
person from whom the material originated.

Expert testimony and testimony of the author, creator, publisher 
or other person from whom the material originated, relating to 
factors entering into the determination of the issue of 
obscenity, shall be admissible. The Court shall dismiss a 
prosecution for obscenity if it is satisfied that the material is 
not obscene.
