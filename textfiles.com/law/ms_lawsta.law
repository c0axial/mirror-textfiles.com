SECTION 97-45-1 Definitions.

    For the purposes of this chapter, the following words shall 
have the following meanings ascribed herein, unless the context 
clearly requires otherwise:

    (a) "Access" means to program, to execute programs on, to 
    communicate with, store data in, retrieve data from or 
    otherwise make use of any resources, including data or 
    programs, of a computer, computer system or computer network.

    (b) "Computer" includes an electronic, magnetic, optical or 
    other high-speed data processing device or system performing 
    logical [,] arithmetic and storage functions and includes any 
property, data storage facility or communications facility 
directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device 
or system. "Computer" shall not include an automated typewriter 
or type-setter, a machine designed solely for word processing 
which contains no data base intelligence, or a portable hand-held 
calculator nor shall "computer" include any other device which 
contains components similar to those in computers but which have 
the sole function of controlling the device for the single 
purpose for which the device is intended unless the thus 
controlled device is a processor of data or is a storage of 
intelligence in which case it too is included.

(c) "Computer network" means a set of related, remotely connected 
devices and communications facilities including at least one (1) 
computer system with the capability to transmit data through 
communication facilities.

    (d) "Computer program" means an ordered set of data 
    representing coded instructions or statements that when 
    executed by a computer cause the computer to process data.

    (e) "Computer software" means a set of computer programs, 
    procedures and associated documentation concerned with 
    operation of a computer system.

(f) "Computer system" means a set of functionally related , 
connected or unconnected, computer equipment, devices or computer 
software.

    (g) "Computer services" means providing access to or service 
    or data from a computer, a computer system or a computer 
    network and includes the actual data processing.

    (h) "Financial instrument" means any check, draft, money 
    order, certificate of deposit, letter of credit, bill of 
exchange, credit card as defined in Section 97-19-9(b), 
Mississippi Code of 1972, or marketable security.

    (i) "Intellectual property" includes data, computer programs, 
    computer software, trade secrets, copyrighted material and 
    confidential or proprietary information in any form or medium 
    when such is sorted in, produced by or intended for use or 
    storage with or in a computer, a computer system or a computer 
    network.

    (j) "Property" means property as defined in Section 1-3-45, 
    Mississippi Code of 1972, and shall specifically include, but 
    not be limited to, financial instruments, electronically stored 
    or produced data and computer programs, whether in machine 
    readable and human readable form.

    (k) "Proper means" includes:

         (i) discovery by independent invention;

         (ii) discovery by "reverse engineering"; that is, by 
         starting with the known product and working backward to 
         find the method by which it was developed. The 
         acquisition of the known product shall be by lawful means;

/* The Mississippi statute is very clear in permitting reverse 
engineering. Although no court has addressed this specific law, 
it seems that a license clause which prohibited reverse 
engineering would be invalid in the State of Mississippi. 
WARNING: This is a very limited permission for reverse 
engineering; for example, you can't simply reverse engineer a 
product and then start printing copies of it with your own title 
and sell it; that would violate the copyright code which does not 
permit copying. Remember that this law only says that you aren't 
guilty of computer crime if you reverse engineer. On the other 
hand, it is a very strong argument that you can reverse engineer 
at least in Mississippi other people's stuff.*/

         (iii) discovery under license or authority of the owner;

         (iv) observation of the property in public use or on 
         public display; or

         (v) discovered in public literature.

/* A clear instruction to mark any literature containing valuable 
data as "private literature." */

    (l) "Use" means to make use of, to convert to one's service,     
to avail oneself of or to employ. In the context of this act,     
"use" includes to instruct, communicated with, store data in     
or retrieve data from, or otherwise utilized the logical [,]     
arithmetic or memory functions of a computer.
