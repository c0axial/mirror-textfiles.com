FEBRUARY 1990                                                     

                                                                  

                  LARGE VEHICLE STOPS

                                                                  
     Standards and accepted procedures for vehicle stops 
involving cars and other passenger vehicles are part of the 
curriculum of most police training academies.  But few address 
the techniques to be followed when officers stop large vehicles, 
such as tractor-trailers, utility vans, and buses.  With the 
increased use of these types of vehicles to transport drugs and 
other contraband, officers find themselves stopping large 
vehicles more frequently.  To ensure maximum protection to 
officers and individuals involved, the North Carolina Division 
of Motor Vehicles Training Section developed a plan detailing the 
mechanics for large vehicle stops.                                

LOCATION

     As with stops involving passenger cars, the officer must 
consider many different factors traffic, congestion, 
pedestrians, road conditions, lighting, and the visibility of the 
stopped vehicles to approaching traffic.  However, large 
vehicles require other special considerations, which are governed 
by the size, type, and configuration of the vehicle, as well as 
the number of officers available to assist at the stop location.  
The officer must plan the stop to allow the driver sufficient 
time and distance to make a safe stop at a location that provides 
a paved and solid shoulder and enough area to pull the vehicle 
well out of the flow of traffic.                                  

POSITIONING THE PATROL VEHICLE                                    

     During the daylight hours, the patrol vehicle should be 
offset at an angle with the rear of the vehicle and at least 20 
feet behind it, with the patrol unit's wheels turned hard left.  
This provides a traffic safety cushion, as well as offers the 
officer more protection in case of any hostile acts from the 
occupants of the stopped vehicle.
                                 
     At night, the patrol vehicle should be offset to the left of 
the stopped vehicle so as to allow the headlights to illuminate 
the side and cab area.                                            

     With buses, the officers will need to position the patrol 
unit in such a manner as to provide a view down the right side, 
since this is where the doors on most buses are located.          

APPROACHING THE VEHICLE
                                           
     Because the drivers of large vehicles are several feet above 
road surface, it is advisable to have the driver exit and walk to 
the rear of the vehicle to be met there by the officer.  This 
allows the officer to remain in a safe location while removing 
the ``high ground'' advantage of the driver.                      

     The officer should ensure that the driver closes the cab 
door to eliminate a traffic hazard.  This also requires anyone in 
the cab to open the door before exiting, thereby warning the 
officer of the presence of another individual.   Officers also 
need to be watchful of cargo bays and should check to ensure that 
each cargo door is closed.                                        

     If the vehicle has stopped in such a way that the front of 
the vehicle is at an offset angle, then the officer may have to 
exit the patrol car and move to the front of the stopped 
vehicle.  While walking the length of the vehicle, the officer 
should use the vehicle's side mirror to observe the driver and 
any activity in the cab.  At no time should the officer climb 
onto a cab.                                                       

     When stopping a bus, the officer must remember that most 
buses are built low to the ground, making the entire length of 
the vehicle a ``danger'' area since there is no cover or escape 
area.  Also, with buses being built low, it is difficult for the 
officer to check under the vehicle to determine if someone is 
moving down the far side.                                         

VIOLATOR CONTACT
                                                  
     It is best that the officer maintain a secure position, 
while having the driver approach the officer.  The violator 
should be advised of the reason for the stop and asked to produce 
the necessary documentation.  The driver should not be allowed to 
return to the vehicle without being accompanied by the officer or 
until the citation has been written.                              

CHECKING CARGO AREAS
                                              
     If it is necessary to inspect the cargo area, the officer 
should request backup prior to proceeding.  The driver of the 
vehicle should open the cargo doors and be the one who moves the 
cargo around.  After the cargo door is opened 4 to 6 inches, the 
officer, standing 3 to 4 feet behind the driver, should sweep a 
flashlight inside to check for other individuals who may be in 
the cargo area.  If it is clear, the officer can then instruct 
the driver to open the door further and to lock it in an open 
position.  Inspection of the cargo area can then proceed 
according to department policy.                                   

CONCLUSION
                                                        
     Daily, patrol officers are making traffic stops involving 
large vehicles.  Each stop poses a potential danger.  Therefore, 
all patrol officers should receive training in the proper 
procedures associated with stopping large vehicles.
