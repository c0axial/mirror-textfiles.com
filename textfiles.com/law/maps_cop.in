Summary: Traps schmaps!  Sheesh!


In the October 4, 1991 edition of the Easy Bay (San Francisco) _Express_,
Cecil's column addresses a follow-up question on the issue of copyright
traps on commercial maps.  A fellow writes about a fictional town named 
Westdale which appeared on th 1982 edition of Rand McNally's Road Atlas 
map of metropolitan Chicago (1982).  It was gone in the 1986 edition.  

Cecil contacted Rand McNally and they claimed that it was a mistake which
occurred when a developer submitted a plan for such a community which was
approved but never constructed.  Cecil notes that it seems a little fishy
since the area was unincorporated, but was built up decades ago.  On the
general subject of copyright traps, a Rand McNally spokesman said, "Why
would we put in copyright traps and then not tell anybody they were there?"
Which does seem a reasonable question.

The writer refers to an book, _How to Lie with Maps_ by Mark Monmonier
which indicates that these errors seem to crop up fairly frequently.
In it, Monmonier also notes the two prank towns in a map of Michigan 
(also noted here on AFU) where a Wolverine fan put in the nonexistent 
towns of "Goblu" and "Beatosu" on the section showing the neighboring 
parts of Ohio.

Does anyone have access to Cecil's September 6 column on map copyright 
traps?  From the nature of this column, it seems to say that these traps
are bunk.

ObUL: Cecil has a newsfeed and is a lurker on AFU.

The "map trap" thingee really shouldn't be regarded as an urban legend.  It's
fact.  There are strong reasons for such tactics, to prove copyright
infringement.  Infringement requires two elements: 1) Copying, and 2),
Improper Appropriation.  The Copying fork is usually very tough to prove
without circumstantial evidence, because there's rarely a witness to the
act of copying.  Generally it can be shown by the combination of the allegedly
infringing work's similarity (called "probative similarity") to the original
work, coupled with a show of access to the original work.  If the degree of
probative similarity is extremely high, the access requirement can be
discarded.  The reproduction of errors or deliberately inserted false
information is very helpful in showing a conclusively high probative similarity
to assume copying.  This technique has been used successfully in many
copyright infringement cases.  I don't have my Copyright text handy, but if
anyone's interested, I'd be happy to look up a few cases and provide
authoritative cites so we can lay this one to rest.

"Fb.Mapmakers intentionally place copyright traps in maps."

Unfortunately I can't speak for mapmakers in general, but ....

For two years I was employed at Etak, a small company in Menlo Park
that makes navigation systems for cars and trucks and such.  One of
their major products is high quality digital maps.  As a result they
employed a number of people from the mapping industry and the census
bureau and such.

Etak's digital maps did in fact have copyright traps.  I know of one
employee whose driveway was included in the map as "<employee's name>
Lane," and it was done specifically as a copyright trap.

This could well be a case of the self-fulfilling urban legend.  Those I
worked with said it was a common practice in the mapping industry.
