Subject: The (Almost) Definitive Answer to Driving Barefoot in America (LONG)
Date: 27 Jul 1994 22:11:28 GMT

NOTE:  I sent my initial letters to all 50 states, and the District of
       Columbia two months ago and have received 42 replies.  I don't 
       currently have the time to remail requests to the 9 dead beat, lazy 
       ass, worthless states that miserably failed to respond (Arizona, 
       Arkansas, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, South 
       Carolina Utah,  and Washington).  If you work for the DMV in one of 
       these states and are reading this here, it doesn't surprise me.

       Anyways, I will send requests to state police departments sometime 
       in September when my schedule frees up.  But, based on the parallel 
       information I've already received from AAA, I don't think the results 
       will be different.

Driving Barefoot in America
===========================

Last updated: July 27, 1994

The AFU FAQ (dated June 10, 1994) says (quotation cited under fair use):

"WILD LIFE IN THE FAST LANE
F. Driving barefoot is illegal most places (Nope, but it's dumb to goad cops)
T. Driving barefoot is illegal in the state of Kentucky.
Copyrighted 1991-94.  All rights reserved by Terry Chan (twchan@lbl.gov)."

I didn't like the "most places" phrase and would prefer a "everywhere 
except" phrase, so I sent a letter requesting information to the Department 
of Motor Vehicles (or the closest thing I could find) in all 50 states and 
the District of Columbia.

The results show that the FAQ is almost right.  The one error is that it is 
*not* illegal to drive barefoot in the state of Kentucky.  This information
comes from Charles F. Brown, Director, Division of Driver Licensing, who
stated, "After a thorough search of chapters 189 and 281 of the Kentucky 
Revised Statutes, I can find no evidence of any prohibition against 
operating a motor vehicle while being barefooted.  I also contacted [the]
Kentucky State Police's office of legal counsel.  I was informed that they 
too know of no statutory limitations for driving while being barefooted."

Seward W. Goss, Administrative Assistant, Planning and Research Unit,
Alabama Department of Public Safety, stated that while driving a car
barefoot is legal, anyone operating or riding on a motorcycle is required 
to wear shoes ($32-5A-245. Headgear and shoes required for motorcycle 
riders; approval of headgear; responsiblity for juvenile riders; sale of
helmets.  Subsections (b) & (f).)  See included law below for details.

Janet Wilcox, Analyst, Communications Section, Bureau of Driver & Vehicle
Records, Michigan Department of State noted that while there is no law 
making driving barefoot illegal, "if a police officer feels that it is a 
careless driving practise, he may ticket you for careless driving."  Not 
quite as strong, was Lt. Col. John F. Lyding, Director, Division of Driver 
Licensing and School Vehicle Safety of the Maryland Department of
Transportation who wrote:

     "However, *in my opinion* [emphasis added], a law enforcement officer
     might charge an individual under either of the two articles listed 
     below if the barefoot driving contributed to:

          *     $21-901(a) Reckless driving vehicle in wanton and willful
                disregard for the safety of persons and property; or

          *     $21-901(b) Negligent driving vehicle in careless and
                imprudent manner endangering property, life and person.

     A driver charged under these articles or any article would have the 
     right to trial where the 'barefoot' aspect of the case might be 
     disputed."

Brian Grisham, Staff Attorney, Tennessee Department of Safety found no
provision in the Tennessee Code Annotated about driving barefoot, but noted 
that a review of all local ordinances would be necessary in order to obtain 
an definitive answer.  Blow me for not delving in that far - get it 
yourself if you need that much detail (don't forget the local ordinances in 
*all* states while you're at it).

In addition, the following states:  Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and 
Wyoming all made the point that even though it was not illegal, driving
barefoot was unsafe and, therefore, not a recommended practise.

Based on this information, I would suggest changing the FAQ to read:

F. Driving barefoot is illegal. (Nope, but it's dumb to goad cops.)
T. ...Unless you're operating/riding a motorcycle in Alabama.
Tb....You *might* be ticketed in MI/MD for careless/reckless driving.
T. ...It's not "recommended" by Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, or Wyoming.
T. ...Jason *REALLY* needs to get laid^H^H^H^H a life.

Then again, 4 lines is an awful lot for such a trivial point.  Oh well, 
this document turned out to be 1350 lines!

Indiana, Montana, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin informed me that
this and other information was available in the American Automobile 
Association (AAA) book, "Digest of Motor Laws".  This is the information 
which AAA had obtained (this much material might be exceeding fair use, but
those bastards stranded me two straight times before I dropped them; they 
still owe me):

American States
---------------

  Alabama:
    Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
      bare feet is permitted. Exception: motorcycle rider.

  Ohio:
    Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
      bare feet is permitted but not recommended.

  California:
    Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
      bare feet is not prohibited.

  Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,Florida,
  Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
  Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
  Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
  Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
  Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
  Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
  Wisconsin, and Wyoming:
    Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
      bare feet is permitted.

District of Columbia
--------------------

  Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
    bare feet is permitted.

American Territories
--------------------

  American Samoa, Peurto Rico, Virgin Islands:
    Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
      bare feet is permitted.

  Guam:
    Driving Barefoot: No information.

Canadien Provinces & Territories
-------------------------------- 

  Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, New Foundland,
  Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island,
  Quebec, Saskatchewan, Yukon Territory:
    Barefoot Driving: Operation of a motor vehicle by a driver with
      bare feet is permitted.
      
Notes:

  1.  AAA did not include the two "warnings" about Michigan and Maryland
      that I received from direct correspondence.

  2.  AAA did note that Ohio did not recommend driving barefoot, but 
      mentioned nothing about Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, or Wyoming.

  3.  AAA made no mention of the possibility of local ordinances banning
      driving barefoot in Tennessee.

  4.  AAA also included a bunch of worthless information about Canada.
      Like anyone cares.

Dear Sir,

There seems to be a common misconception that it is illegal to drive a car
barefoot in most states (though this is believed to be true in the state of
Kentucky.)  My purpose in writing to you is to ask: 

Is it illegal to drive barefoot in the state of [State]?

If yes, could you please include the relevant section(s) of the motor
vehicle code?

Thank you for your time and effort in answering my questions,

Dear Jason:

motorcycle operation or rider (copy enclosed).  It is not
illegal to drive a car barefoot in this state.

$ 32-5A-245. Headgear and shoes required for motorcycle riders;
              approval of headgear; responsibility for juvenile riders;
              sale of helmets.

 (a) No person shall operate or ride upon a motorcycle or motor-driven 
cycle unless he is wearing protective headgear which complies with 
standards established by section 32-12-41.
 (b) No person shall operate or ride upon a motorcycle or motor-driven 
cycle unless he is wearing shoes.
 (c) This section shall not apply to persons riding within an enclosed cab.
 (d) The director of public safety is hereby authorized to approve or
disapprove protective headgear, and to issue and enforce regulations estab-
lishing standards and specifications for the approval thereof. The director 
of public safety shall publish lists of all protective headgear which have 
been approved by him.
 (e) No person shall knowingly permit or allow any juvenile for whom he or
she is a parent or guardian to operate or ride upon a motorcycle or motor-
driven cycle while not wearing a protective helmet of the kind authorized 
by section 32-12-41.
 (f) No person shall knowingly permit or allow any juvenile for whom he or
she is a parent or guardian to operate or ride upon a motorcycle or motor-
driven cycle while not wearing shoes.
 (g) No manufacturer, retailer or other person shall sell or offer for sale
motorcycle helmets that fail to comply with the standards established by 
the director of public safety pursuant to this section. (Acts 1980, No.

                               Commentary

   This section differs significantly from the previous Alabama laws on 
 this subject, sections 32-12-40 through 32-12-44. Subsection (a) is in 
 substantial conformity with the prior statute, section 32-12-40. There 
 were no previous laws comparable to subsections (b), (c) or (d). 
 Subsection (d) authorizes the director of public safety to set standards 
 for helmets, and, since these may vary from time to time, especially as 
 new materials become available, within the guidelines of the statutory
 requirements of sections 32-12-41 and 32-12-42. Subsections (e) and (g)
 are not to be found in the UVC, but are designed to carry over desirable
 provisions in prior Alabama law, sections 32-12-43 and 32-12-40
 respectively. Subsections (d) and (f) and the portions of other
 subsections relating to the requirement that shoes worn are to be found
 neither in the prior Alabama laws nor in the UVC, but were added pursuant 
 to amendments by the senate committee, and represent an additional and
 desirable safety provision.

legality of driving a motor vehicle while barefoot.

I posed you question to the California Highway Patrol, Technical Services

to operation of a motor vehicle and foot wear. A review of the California
Vehicle Code failed to disclose a statute or law which prohibits the
operation of a motor vehicle while barefoot.

I hope this information has answered your question. If you have any further

Re: Barefoot Driving

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

     I have received your inquiry into this topic.  Barefoot
driving is permitted in Indiana, though not recommended.  If you
do not hear from other states in this matter, or have questions
about certain laws, and which states have adopted them, a handy
guide would be the AAA Digest of Motor Laws, which lists each
state's motor vehicle laws.  This digest is available at any AAA
branch, though I belive they do charge for it.

     I hope this provides the information you needed.  Please
contact me if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

Kelly R. Battershell
Staff Attorney

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

I am writing in response to your letter of May 27, 1994, where you
inquired about Iowa's laws pertaining to driving barefoot.

There is no law in Iowa prohibiting driving barefoot.  The practise is
discouraged because of a concern that control on the various pedals may be
inhibited with a bare foot more than if there was a shoe of some sort on
the foot.  The change in control may lead to an accident.

Feel free to contact this office if we may be of further assistance.

                                      Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh,

     Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your letter of May 27, 
1994.  After a thorough search of chapters 189 and 281 of the Kentucky
Revised Statutes, I can find no evidence of any prohibition against 
operating a motor vehicle while being barefooted.  I also contacted [the]
Kentucky State Police's office of legal counsel.  I was informed that they
too know of no statutory limitations for driving while being barefooted.

     I trust this answers your questions to your satisfaction.  Should you
have further questions please feel free to contact me.

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

     Thank you for your inquiry concerning driving barefoot.

     There is no specific statute requiring a driver to wear
shoes.  However, in my opinion, a law enforcement officer might
charge an individual under either of the two articles listed
below if the barefoot driving contributed to:

     *     $21-901(a) Reckless driving vehicle in wanton and
           willful disregard for the safety of persons and
           property; or

     *     $21-901(b) Negligent driving vehicle in careless and
           imprudent manner endangering property, life and person.

     A driver charged under these articles or any article would 
have the right to trial where the "barefoot" aspect of the case
might be disputed.

                              Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

Your letter of May 27, 1994 requesting information on driving a vehicle
barefoot has been referred to our department for a reply.

Michigan does not have a law prohibiting the driving of a motor vehicle
without shoes.  However, if a police officer feels that it is a careless
driving practise, he may ticket you for careless driving.

If I can be of further assistance please feel free to contact me.

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

I am writing in response to your letter regarding the legality of operating
a motor vehicle while barefoot.

I have been advised by Capt. Clarence Greeno of the Missouri State Highway
Patrol that this act is not illegal in the State of Missouri.  There are
however, safety concerns associated with this practise.  For example, it is
felt that the driver of a motor vehicle may lack sufficient control over 
the foot controls or lack the ability to exert sufficient pressure on the 
brake in an emergency situation.  For these reasons, this method of 
operating a motor vehicle is discouraged by the Missouri State Highway 
Patrol.

Please feel free to contact me if I may be of further assistance to you.

Sincerely,

Rick Moore

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

     There is presently no provision in Tennessee Code
Annotated (state law) concerning driving a motor vehicle
barefoot.  It would be necessary, however, to review all
local ordinances to state definitely that a person could not
be held responsible for driving barefoot in the various
subdivisions of Tennessee.

Dear Mr. Heimbaugh:

In answer to your question, "Is it illegal to drive barefoot in the state
of Wyoming."  The answer is, no.  There is no statute that would prohibit
driving a vehicle without proper footwear.  However, the practise of 
driving a vehicle barefoot is strongly discouraged.  This practise is 
unsafe and not practical.
