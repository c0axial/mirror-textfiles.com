July 1990                                                         

                                                                  
                  FOCUS ON CRIME PREVENTION:
           BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER                    

                                                                  
     A joint crime prevention program has been initiated between
the Creve Coeur, Missouri, Police Department and the corporate
security department of Monsanto, Inc., which has its world
headquarters in Creve Coeur.  This new concept may lead to
changes nationwide in the field of crime prevention in the years
to come.

     This program is geared to make homes and the workplace 
safer.  It was established to promote crime prevention techniques 
and citizen awareness by sponsoring business watch, personal 
safety programs, Operation ID, and shoplifting and bicycle safety 
programs.  Initially, Monsanto donated money for the development 
of a crime prevention logo bearing the words ``Business and 
Government Working Together.''  Then, the corporation became 
involved in crime prevention projects by providing personnel from 
the corporate security department to work with police officers. 
Twenty-two thousand area residents and Monsanto employees were 
initially targeted by this joint program.                         

     As part of the program, Monsanto security officers are 
available to make home burglary prevention checks for the nearly 
6,000 local Monsanto employees.  These security officers, who 
receive special training from police officers, visit homes of  
Monsanto employees to point out security weaknesses and to  
offer suggestions to improve them.  Creve Coeur police officers 
conduct similar security checks for residents of the city.  Both 
police and security officers involved in this joint program are 
selected by their respective agencies.  All candidates must 
undergo extensive evaluation in public speaking, writing skills, 
appearance and education.                                         

     An informational crime prevention booth is also operated 
during the city's annual Creve Coeur Days celebration held each 
May.  This booth is staffed by police officers and Monsanto 
security officers.  At the booth, parents and their children have 
an opportunity to see crime prevention displays, obtain handouts 
and make arrangements for programs in their neighborhoods and 
businesses.  Monsanto also makes their world headquarters 
facilities available for large groups interested in crime 
prevention.                                                       

     ``So much of police work is reacting to crimes already 
committed,'' said a Creve Coeur officer.  ``This joint effort is 
an exciting opportunity to fight crime before it occurs.''  If 
results during the early stages of the program are any 
indication, the difference is not only being felt in this 
community but has also given new meaning to the phrase, 
``Business and Government Working Together.''
