/* R FRINGE COMMENTARY- The Georgia Computer Crimes Law follows, 
Official Code of Georgia, Title 16 Section 9-91, adopted  1981*/

SECTION 16-9-91 Legislative intent

     The General Assembly finds that:

     (1) Computer related crime is a growing problem in the 
government and in the private sector;

     (2) Such crime occurs at great cost to the public since 
losses for each incident of computer crime tend to be far greater 
than the losses associated with each incident of other white 
collar crime;

     (3) The opportunities for computer related crimes in state 
programs and in other entities which operate within the state 
through the introduction of fraudulent records into a computer 
system, unauthorized use of computer facilities, alteration or 
destruction of computerized information files, and the stealing 
of financial instruments, data, or other assets are great;

     (4) Computer related crime operations have a direct affect 
on state commerce; and

     (5) The prosecution of persons engaged in computer related 
crime is difficult under current Georgia statutes.

SECTION 16-9-94 Venue

     For the purpose of venue under this article, any violation 
of this article shall be considered to have been committed:

/*"Venue" is the law of where a case will be heard. Venue is easy 
in an armed robbery of a liquor store, since you know where the 
crime took place, and ordinarily, crimes are tried in the area 
where they took place. But in computer crime, it is very hard to 
figure out where the crime took place. The venue provision of 
Georgia basically says that it can be tried wherever you can 
catch the baddie. */

     (1) In any county in which an act was performed in 
furtherance of any transaction which violated this article;

     (2) In the county of the principal place of business in 
this state of the owner or lessee of a computer, computer system, 
computer network or any part thereof;

/*Caught them! This section is gibberish. This literally means 
that anywhere where someone owns a computer is a good place to 
try any computer crime. I think that they mean the place of 
business where the owner of a computer that was illegal accessed 
or affected is located, but, then again, it could refer to where 
the criminal has his place of business. */

     (3) In any county in which any violator had control or 
possession of any proceeds of the violation or of any books, 
records, documents, property financial instrument, computer 
software, computer program, or other material or objects which 
were used in furtherance of this violation; and

     (4) In any county from which, to which, or through which any 
access to a computer or computer network was made, whether by 
wire, electromagnetic waves, microwaves, or any other means of 
communication.

SECTION 16-9-95 Duty to report violation of this article; 
immunity from liability for making such report

     It is the duty of every business, partnership, college, 
university, person, state, county or local government agency 
department or branch thereof; corporation, or other business 
entity which has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation 
of this article has been committed to report promptly the 
suspected violation to law enforcement authorities. When acting 
in good faith, such business, partnership, college, university, 
person, state, county, or local governmental agency or department 
or branch thereof, or other business entity shall be immune from 
any civil liability for such reporting.

/* The snitch act. Well, if you turn someone in for violating 
computer crimes, and then they win the case, you will probably be 
sued for malicious prosecution anyway, and will have to go to the 
jury on your good faith anyway. There is no penalty mentioned for 
failure to comply with this duty. Be very careful not to report 
anyone who might get off!!! */
