October 1990                                                      

                                                                 
                     POLICE PRACTICES:                                   
                SEAT BELT AWARENESS PROGRAM                     

                                                                  
     The use of seat belts is probably the best available 
protection for automobile drivers and passengers from serious 
injury or death due to accidents.  State administrators consider 
the use of seat belts so vital to the well-being of citizens that 
most States have mandated the use of these safety devices for all 
front-seat occupants.  Yet, voluntary compliance with seat belt 
laws is waning.  In fact, during spot checks, police officers in 
South Windsor, Connecticut, observed that only 1 person out of 
every 15 wore a seat belt.  The question then raised is, ``What 
can law enforcement do to make the general public aware of the 
seat belt law and then get citizens to comply with it?''          

     To address the problem, the South Windsor Police Department 
implemented a Seat Belt Awareness Program.  This is an 
educational/enforcement program designed to encourage residents 
to use seat belts.                                          

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT                                               

     The first hurdle, funding the project, was cleared when the
Connecticut Safety Belt Coalition granted the necessary monies to
cover the cost of the program.  This non-profit safety group that
encourages safety belt use also gave the department educational
information that stressed voluntary compliance with State law.

     In addition, a local business joined in this community 
program.  It provided the department with free merchandise 
give-aways to encourage seat belt use.                        

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION                                            

     The Seat Belt Awareness Program ran during the month of 
August 1989.  During the first 2 weeks, the department issued 
press releases informing residents of the program, why it was 
being implemented, how the program would be conducted, and where 
officers would be stationed.                                      

     Starting with the third week, officers conducted 
informational stops.  Occupants of vehicles stopped during this 
period, who were not wearing seat belts, were given a verbal 
warning and an information packet.  The packet contained printed 
materials that explained how seat belts prevent injury and death 
and how many deaths would be prevented if occupants used seat 
belts.  Those found wearing their seat belts received 
merchandise give-aways or coupons for ice cream, which had been 
provided by the safety belt coalition or local businesses.        

     The final week of the program was enforcement week.  During 
this week, officers issued 215 tickets charging drivers with 
failure to wear seat belts, an infraction of Connecticut General 
Statutes 14-100ac.  Drivers were fined if they were not wearing 
seat belts; they received another fine if a front-seat passenger 
was not wearing one.  If seat belts were worn improperly, only a 
verbal warning was given, and officers advised the occupant on 
how to wear seat belts correctly.                                 

     Officers conducted both their informational and enforcement 
stops at the same time and same locations each week.  
Surprisingly, few complained about being issued a ticket, and 
many thanked the officers for reminding them to buckle up.     

PROGRAM SUCCESS                                                   

     The program succeeded in getting the residents of South 
Windsor to wear their seat belts.  Officers observed that the 
ratio of persons wearing seat belts after the Safety Belt 
Awareness Program was 14 out of 15.  By combining informational 
stops with enforcement, the police department in South Windsor 
brought about ``voluntary compliance'' to the Connecticut Seat 
Belt Law.  More important, the police department demonstrated 
concern for the safety of South Windsor residents by encouraging 
them, their family members, and friends to buckle up and prevent 
tragedy.
