                  PEROT   '92 !

Please copy, print, and distribute this information everywhere.

This is a copy of a speech given by H. Ross Perot before the
Press Club. It has been distributed to many electronic Bulletin
Board Systems around the country by Steve Moraff. I have been
fascinated by the almost messianic tone of many people who are
working for Mr. Perot's election. The man on a white horse has
always been a popular undertone in American political life and,
like Bonapartism in France, it reappears with some regularity.

Many friends of mine refer to Mr. Perot's clear and plain
speaking. One of the first things I did for fun when I bought my
first grammer and style checker was to run a couple of political
speeches through it. Since speeches are usually turned into
so called sound bites they tend to be something people take
seriously when they prepare for them.

I make no judgement about Mr. Perot's expression. But since this
speech has been distributed as a way to find out what he says, I
think it is valid to look at how he says it as well. According
to the program, he does well. The analysis was done with
RightWriter 5.0 set to General Style.



H. ROSS PEROT:  Thank you very much. It's a  privilege to be with
you again. You  all are going to get to  punch me around here for
the last 30 minutes, so let me open by asking you a question. How
<<* Is this sentence too long? *>>
many of  you ate broccoli today  at lunch? That's good.  The last
thing I  read, it cures cancer.  I think we ought  to all try it.
<<* Consider replacing "thing" by stronger, more direct
 wording. *>>
<<* Replace "I think we" with a stronger sentence start. *>>
<<* Is "ought to" correct? *>>
Now,  you're going  to have  to endure  my speech  , but  the Q&A
<<* Should there be space before this punctuation? *>>
period is  fun, so that gives  you something to look  forward to.
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two
 or more sentences? *>>
There's  a reception  before this  thing, and  that's always  fun
<<* Consider replacing "thing" by stronger, more direct
 wording. *>>
because there's a  pattern of questions. I'll sweep  those out of
<<* Is "those out of" correct? *>>
the way  first. The most  frequently asked question  is, "Why did
the Press Club  invite you again?" Well, I  don't know, so that's
easy.  Then  this  one  nice  person  came  up  and looked pretty
<<* Consider replacing the overused "nice" with more
 original wording. *>>
stressed out  and said, "Do  you still write  your own speeches?"
<<* Consider replacing "your own" with "your" *>>
<<* Is this quote closed? *>>
Well, that's the bad news. I'm  still writing my own speeches, so
<<* Replace the redundant "my own speeches" with "my
 speeches" *>>
don't  expect too  much. One  nice lady  came up,  and she looked
<<* Consider replacing the overused "nice" with more
 original wording. *>>
really concerned.  She said, "Now,  will you promise  to keep the
same ground rules, particularly, the  last part?" I said, "Yes, I
will." Now, you don't know what she's talking about, but here are
my normal ground rules. I don't care whether you agree with me or
not. I just come in here to  get you stirred up, and then I leave
town. Now, that's the last part  she wanted to make sure of--that
I would leave  town. I'll be out  of town quick. Normally  I have
<<* Is a comma missing?   Replace with "Normally, I" *>>
to. Millions  of people from  all over the  world can only  dream
about coming to  America. Just think how many  people would leave
Russia today to  come to our great country.  Now, aren't we lucky
<<* Is "great" explained and justified by the surrounding
 text? *>>
we're here?  We own this  country. It belongs  to us. That's  the
central  theme of  everything I  have  to  say today.  We have  a
history of being first and  best. Remember when everybody said we
couldn't build the Transcontinental Railroad, that we'd 

    natpress.txt Page:2



never get it through the Continental Divide and what have you? We
built it. Remember when everybody  else tried to build the Panama
Canal and  couldn't build it?  We built it.  Remember when Thomas
Edison, whose  teachers thought he  was dumb, changed  the world?
<<* Does this long paragraph discuss a single topic? *>>
You say,  "Wait a minute,  didn't he have  an NSA grant?"  No! He
<<* Replace "an" with "a" *>>
gave the world  the electric light, and I hope  you never land at
night when you  come into a huge city and  look at that sparkling
<<* Is "huge" explained and justified by the surrounding
 text? *>>
city down below you that you  don't think, "One American did that
on  his  own  initiative."  Never  forget  while  you're  in that
<<* Reconsider the use of the cliche "" *>>
<<* Is this sentence too complex to read easily. *>>
<<* Rephrase "Never forget" in a more positive way. *>>
airplane that two bicycle repairmen from Dayton, Ohio, taught the
world  to fly.  Never forget  there was  a Dr.  [Samuel Pierport]
<<* Rephrase "Never forget" in a more positive way. *>>
<<* Is "a Dr." correct? *>>
Langley that had a government  grant, but the Wright brothers had
to  fly. Now,  that's the   history and  the American  dream, and
that's  what we've  been. We   changed the  world with  radio and
television.  We were  the first  to  put  a man  on the  moon. We
<<* Consider replacing the gender-specific "man on" with
 "person on" *>>
harnessed nuclear power,  and the list of firsts  could go on and
on. Every person  listening to this program, I  hope, will take a
minute  and think.  You know,  you  or  I could  be dying  in the
streets of India  right now. Or we could be  in a little boat off
Vietnam  dying of  thirst. Happy   accident of  birth or  for one
reason or another, we're here. This  is the place the rest of the
world only dreams  of coming to. They look up  to and respect our
great country. We must continue to  be an example to the world in
<<* Is "great" explained and justified by the surrounding
 text? *>>
everything we do.  It is important that we  continue to earn this
<<* Consider using a less wordy phrase than "It is important
 that" *>>
respect. You say, "Well, how important is it that the rest of the
world respect us?" I suggest to you it is very important, because
as long as the world respects and admires our country and as long
as  we  deal  fairly  with   other  nations,  there  is  no  more
cost-effective deterrent to war. Nobody  picks on the strong guy.
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two
 or more sentences? *>>
<<* Does this long paragraph discuss a single topic? *>>
Few  people pick  on the  strong  nice  guy. The  weak guy  is in
<<* Consider replacing the overused "nice" with more
 original wording. *>>
trouble. It's as old as the history of man. Trust and respect are
fragile  on a  human and  a national  level. You  have to earn it
daily. You can  lose it in an instant. The  real question is, are
our  actions  those  that  would  continue  to  earn us worldwide
<<* Is "worldwide" explained and justified by the
 surrounding text? *>>
respect, particularly on our domestic  issues? Let's take a quick
glance.  We  were  blessed  with  a  huge  land  mass  and a tiny
<<* "were blessed" is passive voice.  Consider using the
 active voice. *>>
<<* Is "huge" explained and justified by the surrounding
 text? *>>
population. We had  an abundance of natural resources.  We were a
new,  growing,  free  nation  that  had  barely  begun to tap its
potential. Anytime  we exhausted the  resources in one  area, the
call  went out:  "Go west,  young man,  go west."  Today we are a
mature country with a large population. We have occupied the land
and  creatively tapped  our natural  resources. We  simply cannot
<<* Is "creatively" explained and justified by the
 surrounding text? *>>
continue  to  spend  beyond  our  means.  When  you're  small and
growing, you can  bury some of those mistakes,  but at this point
in  time you  cannot. And  when you  have creatively  tapped your

 point in time" *>>
<<* Is "creatively" explained and justified by the
 surrounding text? *>>
minerals and natural resources, it is brains and wits time. Never
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two
 or more sentences? *>>
forget that--brains and wits time. Somebody can't understand good
Texas talk. We  don't like to accept this, but  we live in a tiny
little world, and we're stuck with international competition. You
don't have  to like it, but  you're stuck with it.  Somebody wins
<<* "you're stuck" is passive voice.  Consider using the
 active voice. *>>
and somebody  loses, and they  don't even give  you a red  ribbon
when you lose in business. We've got to out-think, out-invent and
out-

produce  our international  business  competitors  if we  want to
<<* Is "our international business competitors" ambiguous?
 *>>
maintain the high standard of living that our people have enjoyed
until  now.  Many  of   our  international  competitors  have  an
advantage over us at this point. Now, we like to strut around and
boast that we're the only  remaining superpower. Any time you see
anybody strutting and boasting, get nervous. But, now, just watch

 *>>
them. You know,  we're the last superpower. Well,  you can't be a
superpower unless you're an economic superpower, and if you don't
believe that, look at Russia, and I rest my case. That's all I've

 more direct wording. *>>
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two

got to say about that. We've  got to be economically strong to be
a force  for good  throughout the  world. If  you question  that,
think of  the finest person you  know who gives away  millions of
dollars  each year  to good  and worthy  causes and  so on and so

slip away, and  with it went a significant part  of our tax base.
<<* Does this long paragraph discuss a single topic? *>>
And yet we  continue to spend. Our present  policies will move us
from superpower to Third World status. If you don't believe that,

the  principal exports  in New  York harbor  are scrap  paper and
scrap steel going  to Japan, and now they want  to buy wood chips
from Texas  to make paper  in Japan and  sell us paper  in Texas.

<<* Is this sentence too negative? *>>
Now, if that happens, I think we maybe ought to start looking for

a place to hide. Just think  about that--how far those wood chips
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two

have to  go to come back.  You'd think we could  make paper right
here, right? We can make paper right here. At this point in time,
<<* Consider using "Now" instead of the wordier "At this

it  is  absolutely  irresponsible  for  both  the White House and

Congress not to  be linking arms, working together  night and day
to  fix these  economic  problems.  Unfortunately, this  city has

media stuntmen,  who posture, create  images and talk,  shoot off

to debate that,  I'll buy my own television  time. We need deeds,

not  words,  in  this  city.  In  Churchill's  own words, we need
"action this day,"  not talk. Here's where we  are. Let's look at
where  we are.  We're $4  trillion  in  debt. We  own another  $5
trillion we  don't like to  talk about. We  just kind of  keep it
down there in the basement. You  say, "Well, what are you talking
about, Ross?"  I'm talking about  a $1 trillion  unfunded federal

pension liability. Any question in  your mind we're going to have
to cough  that up someday?  No. The additional  debt piled up  in

1992--just  this one  year,  the  election year--will  exceed the
total expenditures  of the federal  government for the  first 155

years  of our  country's existence.  See, the  man on  the street

doesn't know what $400 billion is.  That kind of clears his head.

The interest on the national debt  just this one year exceeds the

paying interest  does not buy  anything for the  American people.
<<* Is this sentence too negative? *>>
The  total  national  debt  was  only  $1  trillion  in 1980 when
President Reagan took office. It is  now $4 trillion. Maybe it is

I'll tell you that! <<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two

     In 1992, we're going to go  in for another $400 billion. You
say, "Well, wait a minute. Let's  just do some radical things and

 wording. *>>
balance the budget  this year. Let's do really  strange and weird

Department.  You  don't  get  400  billion  bucks. Well, that one
didn't  work.  Let's  just  shut  down  all  the  public  schools
<<* Consider replacing "just shut" with "shut" *>>
nationwide. Sorry, that won't get  me $400 billion. Well, what if
we just seized all the Social  Security money coming in this year
and  use that  to balance  the budget?  Maybe if everything stays
right on  track, that would  just about do  it. Okay, now,  let's

just go over and take it away from business. Let's confiscate the
Fortune 500  companies' profits. I  don't have half  what I need.

Well, that didn't  work. Okay, year in and  year out we're saying
to  rich folks.  "Let's just  tax  the  rich and  fix it."  Let's

confiscate the Forbes 400 wealth.  Doesn't give us nearly what we

right? But we just took all  the wealth, and we don't balance the

 *>>
budget for one year. You say,  "Okay, Ross. Give us the bad news.
How much are  we going to have to raise  personal income taxes to
balance the budget  this year, an election year?"  Watch my lips.
You're going to have to double  it. You don't think anybody would
bring that  up, do you?" I  doubt it. Okay, you  can't do that to
<<* Are there matching quotation marks at the end of this

the  people,  so  let's  just  raise  them  500 percent, and that

That's how big $400 billion is. Now, I'm not talking about the $4
trillion. I'm  just talking about  the $400 billion.  The tax and
budget  summit  in  1990--this  was  a  study  in the White House
arrogance as far  as I'm concerned. We were told  if we agreed to

<<* "were told" is passive voice.  Consider using the active

the  $166 billion  in new  taxes, the  1991 deficit  would be $63
billion. The  following April, we  said, "Oops. It's  going to be
<<* Is this quote closed? *>>
$318 billion. That's  a $255 billion mistake. That  would get you
fired  in most  soft-headed  company  in corporate  America. Now,
there are  a lot of reporters  here today. I never  got the word,
<<* Consider replacing "a lot of reporters" with "many
 reporters." *>>
and I  read the paper. Nobody  ever told me that  while they were
increasing  our taxes  by  $166  billion, they  increased federal
spending by $304 billion, or $1.83  in new spending for every tax
dollar raised.  I'm not too smart,  but I can figure  out that we
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two
 or more sentences? *>>
spent more than we took in, and  as far as I'm concerned, we were

think  of all  those folks  working west  of the  Mississippi not
buying anything new--just paying interest on debt. Let's look for
the good news. Well, surely all this spending created utopia here
in the United States and  everything is wonderful and perfect and

innocent people have created their  own prisons. They have to put

abandoned their neighborhoods to crime,  and you don't have to go
10 minutes from the White House or 10 minutes from the Capitol of
the United States to see  that. That's inexcusable. We spend over

$400 billion a year on  education including colleges, yet we rank
at the  bottom of the  industrialized world in  terms of academic

care, and yet we rank behind 15 nations in life expectancy and 22
other  nations in  infant mortality.  We've got  5 percent of the

world's population, 50 percent of  the world's cocaine use. Until
we get rid  of that we're going nowhere. Getting  rid of it won't
be free. Our system of justice has failed the people. We've got 5
percent  of the  world's population,  two- thirds  of the world's
lawyers, and the average fellow on the street can't afford one to
go to court.  Strange. Young lawyers out of  law school make more

than judges.  There's a legal  system upside down.  Go to London,
Paris, Rome and the other cities  in Europe that have existed for
many centuries. They work. Now, then, go to our cities, which are
relatively brand-new. New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Detroit

and  many other  major cities  are dirty,  run-down, ravaged with

start right here  in Washington where the president  can look out
the window at Washington and the Congress can look out the window
at  Washington.  I  love  this.  They  are  just  covered up with

who's at fault? You know, the first thing you've got to do in our
<<* Consider replacing "thing" by stronger, more direct
 wording. *>>
country is blame somebody, right?  Well, go home tonight and look
in the mirror. Everybody watching television, go home tonight and
look in  the mirror. You and  I are at fault  because we own this
country,  and  there  is  the  problem  in  a  nutshell.  We have
<<* Reconsider the use of the cliche "in a nutshell" *>>
abdicated  our  ownership  responsibility.   As  owners  of  this
country, we hold  the future of this in the  palm of our hands. I
ask you  now, can we agree  that going $4 trillion  into debt did
not create utopia?  We've wasted the money. We've  got to pay the
$4 trillion back,  and we've got to pay  the interest. Obviously,
throwing  money at  problems has  not created  utopia, and yet we
continue  to do  it this  year.  Today  we have  a government  in
gridlock.  Nothing happens  unless Congress  and the  White House
work  together  constructively  for  the  benefit  of the people.
<<* Does this long paragraph discuss a single topic? *>>
That's the way  our founders planned it. That's  the way it ought
to be. Daily we watch with  fascination as Congress and the White

Recently  it's  been  more  like  mud  wrestling  as  far  as I'm
concerned. You know,  if you and I don't like  one another but we

we  have no  choice. I  just think  it's ludicrous  that we  seem

us. We  don't work for you.  Under the Constitution, you  are our

it'll be a $12 trillion debt by the year 2000. Now, that's so big
nobody can  think about it.  Let me just  put it to  you in plain
terms.  Do you  realize that  at $12  trillion, you  could buy  a
$120,000 house for every family  in this country? We can't afford
a $12 trillion debt because the  interest alone on a $12 trillion
debt would  be approximately $1  trillion a year.  And guess what

the  gross receipts  in our  country are  right now. One trillion

<<* Is this a complete sentence? *>>
won't work.  The primary rule  of finance is  never finance long-
term  projects with  short-term debt.  How many  of you know what
percent of  our debt is due  and payable in the  next five years?
<<* Does this long paragraph discuss a single topic? *>>
Sixty-eight percent is due and payable in the next five years. Go
home  tonight and  pray that  the Japanese,  the Germans  and the
Arabs keep  showing up to buy  or T-bills. You don't  want to put
this country in that kind of  a situation, and whose fault is it?
<<* "kind of a" is colloquial or slang.  Replace with more

We  all have  to go  look in  the mirror.  I ask everybody that's
listening and watching  this today to think, "Did  I know that 68

borrow $400 billion of your  children's money this year." And, of
course, we  and our children  will have to  pay it all  back with
interest, but  that comes later,  after the election.  Your first

fixes will,  with certainty, produce  additional long-term damage
to our  economy. The best analogy  I can give you  is an old race
horse that has  a good record. It's got bad  knees, but we've got

from. People  who are not  working don't pay  taxes. With our  $4

back and let the job base deteriorate. When you lay off a worker,

than his  tax deduction used to  be? It's a double  hit, and it's
more than a  double hit. We need a growing  job base to produce a

strong growing companies to keep America at work, and it's got to

business and  by not getting our  pockets picked at international

In  our international  competitors who  are winning,  there is an

just talk about it. We've got to have strategic plans industry by

They will  create millions of jobs.  We've got to make  sure that
we're first and  best. In Japan, that's called  MITI (Ministry of

ahead. I suggest  we start thinking 15 years  ahead and ace them.
Our current tax system is like  an old inner tube with a thousand
patches. I suggest  we throw it out and start  with a blank sheet
of paper. Set  the criteria. Number one, it  must be fair. Number

free fair trade.  We don't have free fair  trade. The White House

agreement will move the highest paid blue-collar jobs in the U.S.

during this critical period. We  have got to manufacture here and

that  in Q&A.  We've got  to have  an intelligent  energy policy.
<<* Is "an intelligent energy policy" ambiguous? *>>
We've known that since the '70's.  Nobody wants to touch it. We'd
<<* Is "the '" correct? *>>
better get started.  We're divided by racial strife.  I just hate
this! Look, we're not Japan where everybody's the same race, same
religion, same background, same  philosophy. We're a melting pot,
right? Okay,  we ought to  love one another.  That takes care  of
most of us. Then for the  guys who can't quite cross that bridge,
we  ought to  get along  with one  another, because divided teams
<<* Consider replacing "along with" with "with" *>>
lose and united  teams win. Now, I am sick  and tired of watching
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two

<<* Reconsider the use of the cliche "sick and tired" *>>
both  political  parties  try  to  divide  our country during the
campaign. We need  to unite as a team.  Now, then, finally you've

simple and blunt. Nobody's going  to leave this country. Nobody's
<<* Is this a complete sentence? *>>
going anywhere. We're  stuck with one another, so  let's get back

up into  category two. Let's get  along with one another,  form a

we left that unattended. You say,  "All right, Ross. Which one of
the  presidential candidates  can  fix  this?" Solomon  can't fix

carefully to this. We now have a government that comes at us. The
process has  reversed itself. That's why  you have to get  in the

American  people  will  then  understand  the  problems  and  the

<<* Consider replacing "thing" by stronger, more direct

now, and when  interactive television comes, you can  do it right
on  the   bull's  eye.  We've   got  to  stop   deficit  spending
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two

immediately. We've  got to replace Gramm-Rudman  with a real bill
that  cuts  out  all  tricks,  loopholes  and improper accounting
procedures.  You've got  to take  away Congress's  right to raise
taxes. Now, there's a radical idea.  You say, "Well, that means a
<<* Is this comma needed?  Replace with "Well that" *>>
constitutional amendment."  Fine. Now, you  say, "Why am  I doing
<<* Capitalize "Constitutional Amendment" *>>
it?" These boys  are drinking to much, that's  why. You've got to
<<* Is "why" correct? *>>
take the bottle away from them for a while at least. Now, if they
need more money, just put it on  the ballot and let the owners of
the country sign off. The board of directors and the stockholders
of a  company would want  to. Well, that  would be controversial,
but that's why I put it on  there. You know, step one is stop the
bleeding. Step two is make sure you don't just tax and spend, tax
<<* Is "is make" correct? *>>
and spend, tax and spend. Now,  then, here's one. From now on, if
they  want a  raise, put  it on  the ballot.  That's all  federal
<<* Would this sentence be clearer if it were split into two
 or more sentences? *>>
employees.  You own  this country.  You know,  any publicly owned
company, you  can't give yourself  a raise. I  think the Congress
would be a lot more comfortable with that. Congress, White House,
the  whole bunch--  if they  want  a  raise, just  put it  on the
ballot. If  we think they're doing  a good job, we'll  give it to
them.  Give  the  president  the  line-item  veto  to  get rid of
porkbarrel and waste.  Now, I say that for  three reasons. Number
<<* Consider using a less wordy phrase than "for three
 reasons" *>>
one, we ought to do it. Number  two, I'd like to see what he does
with it. And number three, I'd like him to stop whining about it.
<<* Does this long paragraph discuss a single topic? *>>
Now, just put it on there,  and then go from there. Now, finally,
Congress  absolutely  must  not  exempt  itself  from the laws it
<<* Is "absolutely" explained and justified by the
 surrounding text? *>>
imposes on  us. You know all  about that. This includes,  but not
limited  to the  Disability Act,  the Equal  Opportunity Act, the
Occupational Safety  Act, etc. Cut the  retirement plan. It's two
to three  times as good  as the one  we have for  ourselves. It's
unrealistic  for the  servants of   the people  to have  a better
retirement plan than the  people. Restructure the whole system--I
can  summarize what  I've tried  to say--where  citizens come  to
Washington to  serve us, not to  cash in. Require all  members of

campaign. Some guys have war chests

now of  up to $13  million, $15 million.  A non-incumbent doesn't

<<* Consider rephrasing "would be shocked" *>>
<<* "be shocked" is passive voice.  Consider using the

know  that. Stop  cashing in  on public  service. Pass  a law. On
this, if I could have one wish before I turn out the lights, this
is  it: Former  federal officials--elected,  appointed and career
officials- -cannot serve as  lobbyists for domestic interests for
five  years after  they leave  office and  they cannot  lobby for
foreign countries,  companies or individuals  for ten years,  and
there are criminal  penalties if you do. Now,  these boys come up

30,000 bucks in a month and  are on the campaign staffs. What can

can survive,  but it'll only  survive if we're  willing to accept
responsibility  that goes  with  this  country. Go  home tonight.
Think about the history of this country. Think about the problems
we have today. They're nothing  compared to those that the people
had at the time of the Revolution.  And if you say, "Gee, I can't
just get  caught up in  all this," we're  not asking the  average
citizen to  do anything except know  the issues and be  alert and
let his congressman know and the  White House know what he wants.

Think about  the sacrifices your  parents made for  you. Did they
