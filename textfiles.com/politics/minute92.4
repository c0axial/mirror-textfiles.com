          MINUTES OF EFF-AUSTIN MEETING, April 14, 1992
 
Held at 7:30 PM at Matt Lawrence's home. Directors present were (in 
order of appearance) Matt Lawrence, Jon Lebkowsky, Ed Cavazos, and 
John Quarterman. Observing: Dave Smith, Susan Cisco, Bob Anderson, 
Dick Anderson.
 
Focus of discussion:
 
EFF-Austin on local bulletin boards: we discussed the possibility 
of presence on a multiline board, establishing a board specifically 
for EFF, or the possibility of helping Earl Cooley upgrade his bbs. 
Discussion led to a fourth possibility, which all present seemed to 
agree was better for now: coordinating a loose network between 
smof, Bambo Garden, and possibly another bbs or two to ensure that 
EFF archives and ongoing discussions are widely available locally. 
Ed Cavazos is interested in overseeing this, but will be in Houston 
for six weeks this summer.
 
May General Meeting: Dick Anderson reports that Austin Technology 
Incubators will give us meeting space, however we agreed that it 
would be more advantageous to have a potluck picnic similar to last 
year's 'cyberdawg' event, this time at one of the local parks, 
possibly at Zilker Clubhouse. Ed Cavazos and Dave Smith agreed to 
arrange reservations, after which we will post an announcement. 
Tentative date: May 2 or May 3, noon or early afternoon. At this 
picnic we will initiate dues collection. Will set ASAP so that 
announcements can be proliferated hither and yon.
 
Inks Lake retreat: will probably become a party instead, to be 
hosted this summer by Jon and Marsha Lebkowsky. Will probably defer 
discussion til June meeting.
 
CyberTex Conference: Reviewed the document produced by Jon 
Lebkowsky as a result of the initial CyberTex meeting. All agreed 
that, though cyberarts and robot group participation will be 
highlights, we want to be careful to focus on EFF-related issues 
such as education about the Matrix and related civil liberties 
issues.
     Additions: a track called "Exhibits," and an additional role 
to fill, that of "Technical Director." We probably also need 
someone to handle City Services, perhaps someone who has been 
connected with city government in the past  :-) .
	We also discussed the need for someone to run the
network access and display room, which is not precisely the
same as either exhibits or what is under the technical director. -jsq
     Funding: we will seek grant money, and will begin selling 
memberships asap (we need a treasurer before we accumulate 
substantial sums of money, and we probably should incorporate as a 
nonprofit). We can allow reduced rate for bbs sysops and students, 
and we can award 'work scholarships.'

Action items:
1) creation of a CyberTex e-mailing list (Jon and John);
	Done: cybertex@tic.com  -jsq
2) check for conflict with Comdex or other high-profile 
events (might have to bump date to May?);
	Everyone should send schedules of related events for April 1993
	to cybertex@tic.com.  -jsq
3) begin work on budget; 
4) find a volunteer coordinator, then staff.

CyberTex meetings twice monthly beginning Wednesday, May 6, at Jon L.'s house.

There was discussion of whether or how to approve the charter and bylaws
drafted by Ed Cavazos and incorporating input from extensive discussion
at the previous board meeting.  It was noted that 9 directors were
required but only 6 were known, so that bootstrapping problems existed.
After discussion, the following solution was approved:
 
Moved by John S. Quarterman that The Official Charter And By-Laws of
The Electronic Frontier Foundation -- Austin Chapter,
as submitted by Ed Cavazos and as amended by the changes listed below,
be approved by the quorum of charter directors present pending
ratification by the charter directors at the meeting of 12 May 1992.
The changes incorporated are:

  Sec (2): "The number of directors of the organization shall be 9"
           changed to "The number of seats on the board shall be 9."
           
           Added at end of Sec: "The initial directors are listed in
           Addendum A."
 
  Sec (6): Removed "fixed by section (2) of the bylaws"
  
  Sec (7): Will be clarified to define quorum based on existing 
           number of directors rather than available seats.
 
  An addendum (A) was added which lists the original charter Board 
  members as: Jon Lebkowsky, Matt Lawrence, Ed Cavazos,
  John Quarterman, Smoot Carl-Mitchell, and Steve Jackson

Seconded by Jon Lebkowsky.  Approved unanimously by role call
of the charter directors present (Lebkowsky, Lawrence, Quarterman,
and Cavazos).  The charter members present constituted a quorum
according to the charter and bylaws as amended and approved
pending ratification.
 
A copy of the charter and bylaws as amended follows in a separate message.
 
Agenda for next meeting (May 12) will include:
 
     Ratification of bylaws
     Discussion of Potential Amendments:
        Procedures for voting by proxy
        Dissolution procedures
        Statement of purpose (will probably assign a committee for this)
     Election of officers
     Appointment of initial Advisory Board

Jon Lebkowsky noted that he will be traveling, therefore will be
unavailable for the May 12 meeting.
