          An Introduction to the Doctrine of Signatures   Tamarra S. James  
                                                                            
               It is unthinkable that any serious student of herbal         
          medicine would be unaware of the existence of a diagnostic system 
          called, "The Doctrine of Signatures".  Most people have read of   
          it in passing with little or no explanation.  In the historical   
          perspective, it is one of the most important modes of medical     
          thinking to have evolved, and it was expounded in medical texts   
          from the middle of the sixteen hundreds right up to the end of    
          the nineteenth century.                                           
                                                                            
          The Doctrine of Signatures is most notable in that it was not     
          originally formulated for the medical profession.  It took shape  
          as a spiritual philosophy that had as its base the simple concept 
          that God had marked everything he had created with a sign.  This  
          sign was a clear indicator of the item's true purpose as intended 
          by God.                                                           
                                                                            
          There are allusions to this sort of theory in the writings of     
          Galen A.D. 131-200.  But it was not until the publication of      
          Jacob Boehme's Book "Signatura Rerum; The Signature of all        
          Things" was published in the first half of the seventeenth        
          century that it took form as a complete philosophy.               
                                                                            
          Jacob Boehme was not a learned man, he was in fact, a             
          shoemaker from a poor family just outside Goerlitz, Germany.  In  
          1600, he was visited by a sudden illumination of the mind in      
          which was made clear to him the doctrine he espoused for the      
          remainder of his life.  He published his revelations in the book, 
          "Aurora" 1612, and was promptly exiled from his home town by the  
          city council on the advice of the pastor of Goerlitz.  The city   
          council reversed the banishment the next day on the condition     
          that he wrote no further books.  He was apparently unable to      
          comply with the conditions and left for Prague the next year. He  
          died in 1624 having authored two books and several treatises on   
          the subject of his visions.                                       
                                                                            
          The first person to look on Boehme's theories as something more   
          secularly useful than a method for spiritual meditations was      
          Paracelsus who was writing in the first half of the sixteen       
          hundreds.  Paracelsus is considered by modern scholars to be the  
          father of modern chemistry, and he did much in his lifetime to    
          popularise the Doctrine of Signatures in its medical application. 
                                                                            
          (Put in its simplest terms, the Doctrine states that by           
          careful observation one can learn the uses of a plant from some   
          aspect of its form or place of growing.)  The level of signature  
          often got a little far fetched, and it would seem that this was a 
          case of attempting to make the known facts fit the popular        
          theory.  In a period where most of the world was still largely    
          illiterate, it is likely that the Doctrine of Signatures was      
          useful as a mnemonic aid for the apprentice who was learning by   
          observation and rote.

          I will give here a series of examples from William Cole who was   
          writing in the Seventeenth Century and was greatly influenced by  
          the teachings of Paracelsus.  They will give you some idea of the 
          practical application of the Doctrine. These examples are taken   
          from notes that were intended to teach the practices of medicine. 
          His books are titled, "The Art of Simpling" and "Adam in Eden".   
          The distilled water of Hawthorn: "It is found by good experience, 
          that if cloathes and spunges be wet in the said water and applyed 
          to any place whereinto thornes, splinters etc. have entered and   
          be there abiding, it will notably draw forth, so that the thorn   
          gives a medicine for its own prickling."  The signature is in the 
          thorn itself in this case.                                        
                                                                            
          Lung wort, due to the spots on its leaves was related to          
          Pulmonary complaints.                                             
          Plants with yellow flowers or roots, such as Goldenrod were       
          believed to cure conditions of Jaundice by the signature of       
          colour.                                                           
          Plants with a red signature were used for blood disorders.        
          John Gerard states in his herbal when speaking of St. John's      
          Wort, "The leaves, flowers and seeds stamped, and put into a      
          glass with oile olive, and set in the hot sunne for certaine      
          weeks togather and then strained from those herbes, and the like  
          quantity of new put in, and sunned in like manner, doth make an   
          oile of the colour of blood, which is a most precious remedy for  
          deep wounds..."  In this sort of case, the doctrine goes a little 
          far in demanding that the preparation be made before the          
          signature evidences itself.                                       
                                                                            
          The petals of the Iris were commonly used as a poultice for       
          bruising because of the signature of colour, the petals           
          resembling in hue the bruise they were to alleviate.              
                                                                            
          Beyond the signature of colour was that of form.  If a portion of 
          a plant resembled an organ or other part of the Human Anatomy, it 
          was believed to be beneficial to that part, thus, Cole speaks of  
          Lily of the Valley in the following terms, " It cureth apoplexy   
          by Signature; for as that disease is caused by the dropping of    
          humours into the principal ventricles of the brain: so the        
          flowers of this Lily hanging on the plants as if they were drops, 
          are of wonderful use herein."                                     
                                                                            
          Poplar or "Quaking Aspen" leaves were used for shaking            
          Palsy, and Byrony root, which, with a little imagination could be 
          said to resemble a swollen human foot, was obviously signed for   
          use in cases of Dropsy which caused swelling of the foot.         
          There are many more examples of similar types, but this will      
          give a sort of general overview to the theory.                    
                                                                            
          The Doctrine of Signatures naturally led to the concept of        
          Astrological influence, and this was developed and put forward by 
          Nicolas Culpeper in his book, "Judgement of Diseases" in the mid  
          sixteen hundreds.  This was a sort of scientific version of the   
          Doctrine of Signatures that set itself up in opposition to the    
          simpler folk style we have seen previously.  In fact there were a 
          number of vituperative arguments and clashes between Cole and     
          Culpeper over the relative merits of the two systems.             

                                                                            
          In short, the two systems weren't that far different from each    
          other, and their evaluations of the uses of herbs were generally  
          the same, the means of arriving at the interpretation was the     
          thing in dispute.  Culpeper felt that only astrologers were fit   
          to study medicine, being an astrologer himself did not, I'm sure  
          hinder him in the formation of this bias.  Cole was of the        
          "College of Physicians in London" whom Culpeper loudly decried    
          as, " A company of proud, insulting, domineering doctors, whose   
          wits were born about 500 years before themselves."  Cole was also 
          the most avid proponent of the Doctrine of Signatures.            
                                                                            
          They carried on a literary battle for supremacy which was         
          effectively won in 1649 by Culpeper, when he published, " a       
          physicall directory or a translation of the London dispensary     
          made by the College of Physicians in London..."  In this book, he 
          had translated the College's main medical text from the Latin,    
          into the vernacular so that the common man could wean himself     
          away from dependance on the Doctors by delving into the mysteries 
          that were formerly known only to the learned physicians.  He also 
          added his own commentary on the formulas, and included a healthy  
          dose of his astrological theories, seeming to give them the       
          credence of the College.  The College was not amused and          
          proceeded to attack Culpeper in broadsides from this time, and    
          continued unceasingly, even after his death.                      
                                                                            
          The astrological system of diagnosis and treatment was set forth  
          in Culpeper's "complete herbal" in the following way:             
                                                                            
          1. Consider what planet causeth the disease; that thou mayest     
          find it in my aforesaid "Judgement of Diseases". (His other       
          book).                                                            
                                                                            
          2. Consider what part of the body is affected by the disease and  
          whether it lies in the flesh or blood or bones or ventricles.     
                                                                            
          3. Consider by what planet the afflicted part of the body is      
          governed; that my "Judgement of Diseases" will inform you also.   
                                                                            
          4. You may oppose diseases by herbs of the planet opposite to the 
          planet that causes them; as diseases of the luminaries by the     
          herbs of Saturn and the contrary; diseases of Mars by the herbs   
          of Venus and the contrary.                                        
                                                                            
          5. There is a way to cure diseases sometimes by sympathy and so   
          every planet cures its own diseases; as the sun and moon by their 
          herbs cure the eyes, Saturn the spleen, Jupiter the liver, Mars   
          the gall and diseases of the choler, and by Venus diseases in the 
          instruments of generation."                                       
                                                                            
          Astrology was consulted for diagnosis, classification of          
          medicinal plants and bodily functions, the preparation of         
          medicines, and the determination of the most favorable time to    
          administer the remedy.

          I will briefly set down the basic planetary divisions of the      
          botanic kingdom.  One will note how similar the method is to the  
          broader Doctrine of Signatures, in fact, there is little          
          deviation here from the planetary catalogue set down by           
          Paracelsus.                                                       
                                                                            
          SUN:                                                              
             The sun was said to rule the heart, circulation, and the       
          vertebral column.  All plants that appeared solar, such as        
          Calendula and Sunflower fell under its influence, as did those    
          plants that followed the sun in their growth such as Heliotrope.  
                                                                            
          Plants that were heat producing, such as Clove and Pepper, and    
          all those having a tonic effect on the heart were classified      
          under the Sun.                                                    
                                                                            
          MOON:                                                             
             The moon was held to influence growth, fertility, the breasts, 
          stomach, womb, and menstrual cycle.  It also exerted control over 
          the brain and the memory.  All body fluids and secretions were    
          believed to be under the lunar sway.  To some extent, the entire  
          plant world was subject to the Moon, as harvesting and planting   
          was performed in accordance with the lunar phases.  Most          
          especially lunar were those plants with a diaphoretic action, or  
          with juicy globular fruits.  Moisturizing, cooling, or soothing   
          juices fell in here as well.                                      
                                                                            
          MERCURY;                                                          
             Mercury ruled the nervous system, and the organs of speech,    
          hearing, and respiration.  Mercuric plants bore finely divided    
          leaves such as fennel, dill, and carrot.  The smell was usually   
          sharp and distinctive.  The most typical of Mercury's plants had  
          a mood elevating, slightly tonic effect.                          
                                                                            
          VENUS:                                                            
             Venus ruled the complexion, the sexual organs, and the hidden  
          inner workings of the body cells. Venusian plants almost all bore 
          heavily scented, showy blossoms such as the Damascus Rose or the  
                                                                            
          Apple Blossom.  The medicinal effects were commonly emollient,    
          anti-nephritic, and alterative.  Of course, many of the           
          aphrodesiac plants were included under the auspice of Venus as    
          well.                                                             
                                                                            
          MARS:                                                             
             Mars ruled the muscles, body vitality, and the libido.  It     
          also had influence in the combustion processes of the body and    
          the motor nerves.  Its plants generally affected the blood, and   
          were stimulating, and in many cases aphrodesiac.  Many were hot   
          and acrid in their nature.                                        
                                                                            
          JUPITER:                                                          
             Jupiter ruled the liver, the abdomen, the spleen, and the      
          kidney.  Digestion was governed by this planet as was body        
          growth.  Most of Jupiter's plants are edible, many bearing nuts   
          or fruit such as the chestnut and the apricot.  Its medicinal     
          traits are antispasmodic, calmative, hepatic, and anthelmintic.

          SATURN:                                                           
             Saturn ruled over aging, the bone structure, teeth, and all    
          hardening processes.  Many of its plants are poisonous such as    
          Hemlock and Belladonna.  The effects of Saturnian plants are      
          sedative, pain relieving, coagulant, or bone-forming.             
                                                                            
          Beyond these seven planets, the proponents of this theory         
          had no knowledge of any other heavenly influences.                
                                                                            
          To many of us, this method seems very arbitrary and unreliable,   
          but one must note, that it was more a system of catalogue than a  
          real formula for discovery.  A budding herbalist may know that    
          Mercury has many plants with highly divided leaves like Parsley,  
          but he also knew, that Jupiter had the Hemlock, also with finely  
          divided leaves, and so he could not trust that all plants with    
          the leaf type would act the same.  Most of the herbal apprentices 
          could read little and write less, and the Doctrine of Signatures  
          came to the rescue as a slightly more dignified mnemonic key than 
          the doggerel verse of the village witch-wife.
