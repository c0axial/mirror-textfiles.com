Marchetti:                                                (continued)
     But  basically  the CIA  is controlled  by the White House,  the
     inner  circle   of government,  the  inner  circle   of  the
     establishment, in general.

     The CIA is doing what these people want done so these people
     are appreciative and protective of them, and they in turn make
     suggestions or even go off on their own sometimes and operate
     deep cover for the CIA. So it develops into a self-feeding circle.

       FD: Spreading disinformation is done through the newsmedia.

Marchetti:
     Yes.  Its done through the newsmedia.  The fallacy is that the CIA
     says the real reason they do this is to con the Soviets.

     Now, I'll give you some examples.  One was a fellow by the name
     of Colonel Oleg Penkovsky.

       FD: Penkovsky Papers?

Marchetti:
     Yes.  I wrote about that in `The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence.
     The Penkovsky Papers  was a phony story.   We wrote the book in
     the CIA.  Now, who in the hell are we kidding? The Soviets?

     Do we think for one minute that the Soviets, who among other things
     captured Penkovsky, interrogated him, and executed him, do you think
     for one minute they believe he kept a diary like that? How could he
     have possibly have done it under the circumstances?

     The whole thing is ludicrous.  So we're not fooling the Soviets.

     What we're doing is fooling the American people and pumping up
     the CIA.  The British are notorious for this kind of thing.

     They're always putting out phony autobiographies and biographies
     on their spies and their activities which are just outright lies.

     They're done really to maintain the myth of English secret
     intelligence so that they will continue to get money to continue
     to operate.  Thats the real reason.

     The ostensible reason is that we were trying to confuse the
     Soviets.  Well that's bullshit because they're not confused.

     One of the ones I think is really great is `Khruschev Remembers.'

     If anybody in his right mind believes that Nikita Khruschev sat
     down, and dictated his memoirs, and somebody -- Strobe Talbot
     sneaked out of the Soviet Union with them they're crazy.

     That story is a lie.  That book was a joint operation between the
     CIA and the KGB.  Both of them were doing it for the exact same
     reasons.  They both wanted to influence their own publics.

     We did it our way by pretending that Khruschev had done all of this
     stuff and we had lucked out and somehow gotten a book out of it.

     The Soviets did it because they could not in their system allow
     Khruschev to write his memoirs.  Thats just against everything
     that the Communist system stands for.  But they did need him to
     speak out on certain issues.

     Brezhnev particularly needed him to short-circuit some of the
     initiatives of the right wing, the Stalinist wing of the party.

     Of course the KGB was not going to allow the book to be published
     in the Soviet Union.  The stuff got out so that it could be
     published by the Americans.  That doesn't mean that the KGB
     didn't let copies slip into the Soviet Union and let it go all
     around.  The Soviets achieved their purpose too.

     This is one of the most fantastic cases, I think, in intelligence
     history.  Two rival governments cooperated with each other on a
     secret operation to dupe their respective publics.
