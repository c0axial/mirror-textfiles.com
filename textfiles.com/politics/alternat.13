The following 5 postings comprise the 13th posting of the Alternate History
List. It includes 772 published English-language stories and books, plus 7
whose publication is expected.
 
A major restructuring of the list has been made since last posting. The
division into vanilla alternate history, crosstime tales and change-the-past
stories has been dropped.

Also included is an appendix listing 88 Alternate Histories in non-English
languages. This appendix is an experiment and will be included in future
postings only if there is favorable feedback, and hopefully contributions.

               words in the language are 'What if?'"

This is an annotated list of stories involving Alternate Histories (aka What-
Ifs, Allohistory or Counterfactuals), stories in which a past event has been
altered and its effect on later history described. The list is occasionally
posted to the UseNet newsgroup rec.arts.sf.written and most of its contents
were contributed by readers of that newsgroup. Much has been extracted from:

Hacker, Barton C., & Gordon B. Chamberlain, "Pasts that Might Have Been, II: A
   Revised Bibliography of Alternative History", in ALTERNATIVE HISTORIES (eds
   Waugh & Greenberg) {Garland 86};
Contento, William, INDEX TO SCIENCE FICTION ANTHOLOGIES AND COLLECTIONS {George
   Prior/G.K. Hall 78};
-----------------, INDEX TO SCIENCE FICTION ANTHOLOGIES AND COLLECTIONS 1977-
   1983 {G.K. Hall 84}.

Alternate history (abbrev. "AH" below) criteria are generally the same as in:

Chamberlain, Gordon B., "Allohistory in Science Fiction", in ALTERNATIVE
  HISTORIES (eds Waugh & Greenberg) {Garland 86}.

Thus, alterations affect more than fictional individuals, and the story is not
secret history, does not rely on events entirely futureward of when the author
wrote the story, etc. Submissions for new entries are always appreciated, as
are corrections to the old.

Entries have been separated into three categories:

Anthologies -- collections of genre short stories and/or essays, each of which
   is also listed separately;
Alternate Histories -- what-if stories, essays and novels;
Reference Materials -- discussions of the genre and/or specific stories.

In the entries, please note that:

The notation "W:" beginning a description stands for "What if:", and that line
describes the divergence of that AH from ours. An "S:" means "Story:", and that
line describes the plot. A "C:" indicates "Comments:". If none of these is
present, "C:" or "S:" is assumed.

If an author's name is replaced by dashes, the entry is a sequel to or in the
same series as the preceding entry. If replaced by dashes within arrows, it is
part of a series collected within the previous book entry. Double arrows
indicate inclusion in a book collected within an omnibus volume.

If you can't find a particular short story, check other entries by the author
to see if it was retitled or included in a larger work.

References to anthologies containing a short story include an editor's name
only if different from the author of the story.

Not all of the available publication data about the entries is presented here,
and in some cases the list of books in which a story appears has been limited.
Where the latter occurs, "etc" appears at the end of the book list. If you need
more publication info about a story, drop me a line at the address above.
