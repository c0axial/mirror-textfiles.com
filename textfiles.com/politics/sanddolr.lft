                      A Libertarian Outlook

                   by Gerald Schneider, Ph.D.


     Byron G. Norton bemoaned exploitation of "sand dollars" in a 
Washington Post Magazine article in June of 1986.  Sand dollars 
are sea urchins whose flat disklike skeletons imprinted with 
"starfish" designs are collectable.
     The article concerned a girl, about 8, gathering live sand 
dollars at a beach for her mom.  Her mother would bleach the sand 
dollars, turn them into decorative items, and sell extras to 
craft stores.

                         "Commercialism"

     Upset by this "commercialism"--trading live animals for 
craft projects--Norton wrote: "No industrial operation can be 
expected to exercise self-restraint when there are profits to be 
made.  The family was only transforming sand dollars into 
monetary dollars."
     He went on to say of the little girl: "As a novitiate in the 
order of capitalism, she was already acting as if sand dollars 
were merely commodities."  Norton also implied that commercialism 
of nature leads to overharvesting of species and endangerment of 
their future survival.

                     A Problem of Ownership

     But Norton was wrong!  Capitalism and commercialism are not 
at fault when it comes to catastrophic abuse of nature.  
Ownership of natural resources and nature is the problem.
     The beach involved in his story was government "owned," and 
belonged to no one in particular and to everyone.  It received 
the same lack of public respect I described for the Chesapeake 
Bay in another article.
     Government ownership produces little incentive for exercise 
of self-restraint in the use of the beach's (or nature's) 
treasures.  Ecologist Garrett Hardin called this dilemma "the 
tragedy of the commons" in his 1968 essay with that title.  
Economists would say that this is what happens when external 
costs are not internalized.

                   Private Ownership is Better

     If the beach were privately owned, for example, by some 
naturalist organization, preservation would be practiced.
     If sand dollars helped attract people to the beach, private 
owners with commercial interests would protect sand dollars from 
overharvest.  It would be to the private, commercial owner's 
advantage to ensure sustained yield of sand dollars.  She would 
want to keep the public coming back for more year after year.
     Getting beaches away from government and into private 
ownership by persons who value sand dollars for their own sake or 
for the sake of ecology should be the conservationist's goal.  
Ditto for all of nature and natural resources.

                        Study the Record

     People still unconvinced about the superiority of private 
over government ownership of the environment should study the 
record.  Just compare land and water bodies owned by 
environmental organizations (e.g. The Nature Conservancy) to 
federal government property.
     Federal government agencies, "pork barrel" politicians, and 
timber and livestock interests shape environmental policies on 
"public" (federal government) property.  These special interests 
are referred to as the "iron triangle" by land economist, John 
Baden.  He has documented how these interests combine to cause 
Americans to "subsidize the destruction of their environment."
