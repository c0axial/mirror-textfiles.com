                PRESIDENT BUSH ON WELFARE REFORM


     "It's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and
     help reform the welfare system.  States throughout the country
     are beginning to operate with new assumptions:  that when
     able-bodied people receive government assistance, they have
     responsibilities to the taxpayer.  A responsibility to seek
     work, education or job training; a responsibility to get their
     lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families
     together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and
     a responsibility to obey the law."

                                   --   President Bush
                                        State of the Union Address
                                        January 28, 1992     


Summary:  The President's Objectives for Welfare Reform

o    The principles outlined by the President in his State of the
     Union Address are essential to adding accountability to
     welfare and reducing dependency.  These reforms include: 

     --   Requirements that able-bodied welfare recipients enroll
          in workfare or some form of job training in exchange for
          receiving benefits; 

     --   Measuring the success of welfare programs by how many
          people move from the welfare rolls onto the job rolls.

     --   Adding incentives that encourage families to stay
          together, and disincentives that discourage additional
          out-of-wedlock births.

o    To accelerate implementation of welfare reforms, President
     Bush has made a commitment to speed up review of Federal
     waivers for state reforms.  The President and the Secretary of
     Health and Human Services have already approved a waiver for
     Wisconsin's Parental and Family Responsibility Initiative,
     which provides new incentives for welfare recipients to work
     and marry.

o    Reducing dependency in welfare will save taxpayer dollars, but
     more importantly, make able-bodied citizens productive again. 
     Getting people off welfare and into jobs helps former
     recipients, their families, and society generally.  In
     addition, getting long-term dependents off welfare will free
     up more dollars for programs that are supposed to help working
     Americans and their families in times of economic strain,
     instead of providing more government funds for already-
     dependent welfare recipients.

The Need for Welfare Reform

o    The 1988 Family Support Act represented a philosophical
     turning point in the approach to welfare; it expanded
     government efforts to train recipients and to collect child
     support, but it also required recipients to accept new
     responsibilities.

o    Many reforms proposed since 1988 reflect the Family Security 
     Act's conceptual approach; however, there remains a growing
     need to translate new thinking into lasting results. 
     Dependency remains a pervasive problem.  Research has shown
     that about two-thirds of the families on AFDC at any given
     time will spend a total of eight or more years on the rolls.

o    Addressing long-term dependency by increasing incentives for
     those on welfare to work and behave responsibly will help
     dependent recipients become productive again, and will prevent
     the current generation of children from becoming the AFDC
     parents of the next decade.  New welfare reforms will meet
     government's responsibility to become both more effective and
     more compassionate.

Federal Approval of State Demonstration Programs

o    On April 10th, President Bush announced approval of Federal
     waivers for Wisconsin's Parental and Family Responsibility
     Initiative which is designed to encourage teenage parent
     welfare recipients to work and marry.  The initiative will
     strengthen families by encouraging poor couples to marry and
     to be responsible about child-bearing.  Also, recipients will
     be required to participate in education and job placement
     services.  Unlike existing programs, Wisconsin's plan will
     increase the reward for taking jobs by increasing the amount
     of monthly earnings that can be received before AFDC payments
     are reduced.

o    The Bush Administration has approved several other welfare
     reform demonstration projects, including:

     --   Illinois' Chance for Self-Sufficiency program which is
          helping families previously on welfare to stay off
          welfare by providing state-sponsored and community based
          post-welfare education and training services.

     --   In Maryland, Montgomery County's Cash Incentives Payments
          for Self-Sufficiency which increases the value of work by
          providing incentive bonuses for completing job training
          or getting a job.

     --   Texas' Toward Independence Program which provided one-
          year of Medicaid and child care benefits to ease the
          transition from welfare to work.

o    More than 20 States that begun to develop welfare reform
     proposals.  These proposals are receiving expedited review at
     the Federal level.

Reforms by States

o    Reforms that require responsibility, promote family values,
     and reduce dependency, if adopted by a number of states, would
     fundamentally improve welfare's operation.  Meaningful welfare
     reform as outlined and promoted by the President will mean
     dependent recipients, to continue receiving benefits, would
     have to assume a measure of personal responsibility and take
     concrete steps to improve their lives.

o    States such as New Jersey and California are taking steps to
     approve reforms similar to the President's proposals.  New
     Jersey has passed a law this year that would instill
     responsibility by requiring work for welfare (or enrollment in
     job training), and by not increasing benefits to those who
     have additional children while receiving welfare.

Putting the Private Sector to Work in Reducing Welfare Dependency

o    The private sector can play an important role in getting
     welfare recipients back to work.  Some states have established
     public-private networks which pay private firms for each
     welfare recipient placed in a job.  Results-oriented programs
     like these put the power of the marketplace to work in ways
     that benefit taxpayers, state and local governments, and
     welfare recipients.

o    By focusing on results, private firms are able to take direct
     control over welfare cases, steering recipients into jobs
     sooner than the state might have, and reducing costs to
     taxpayers.  States have strong incentives to turn to the
     private sector, which can be held directly accountable for
     success or failure.  

o    In partnership with state and local governments, private
     sector initiatives under the Job Opportunities and Basic
     Skills (JOBS) program remove barriers to employment with
     placement services, sharpen workers' skills, and place welfare
     recipients in paying jobs.  Major "welfare-to-work" projects
     with private sector involvement exist in Connecticut, New
     York, Massachusetts, and Wyoming.  One private firm manages
     over 14,000 AFDC cases in Los Angeles County alone.  Thousands
     of Texas AFDC recipients benefit from a private firm's case
     management project that provides focused training and
     placement services.

Budgetary Commitments to Welfare Reform

o    The President is making concrete his commitment to workfare
     and welfare reform by:

     --   Providing $1 billion in FY93 to finance the federal share
          of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills training
          program (JOBS).  JOBS helps eligible parents receiving
          assistance under AFDC to obtain education, training, and
          employment services, and thus to avoid welfare
          dependency.

     --   Proposing $250 million over five years for AFDC changes
          to provide incentives for savings and promote self-
          employment among welfare recipients.

o    President Bush also wants to expand opportunities for private
     sector involvement, and, in his Job Training 2000 initiative 
     has proposed several new welfare-to-work reform demonstrations
     to fund public-private partnerships involving more than $20
     million in welfare payments.

Creating Opportunities for Self-Improvement

o    The President understands that instilling responsibility means
     more than just providing opportunities for education and
     training -- it means creating a network of opportunity for
     self-improvement:  the HOPE initiative in housing to encourage
     home ownership, the AMERICA 2000 strategy to restore
     accountability to education, and significant new funding for
     child care programs to help the children of working parents
     onto the path of opportunity and Job Training 2000 which would
     establish "one-stop shopping" skill centers replacing the
     existing job training maze to help the low-income
     disadvantaged find jobs, and training more easily.

o    If government is to encourage personal responsibility, the
     design of current programs must be changed significantly to
     expand job opportunities and promote self sufficiency.  To
     this end, the President's FY93 budget contains several
     initiatives to help low-income families escape welfare
     dependency:

     --   The President has proposed to give states the option of
          allowing families already on the welfare rolls to
          accumulate savings.  This will give AFDC families the
          opportunity to save up to $10,000 to achieve independence
          from welfare, educate their children, or start a
          business.

     --   The President has proposed to create a welfare
          initiative, similar to an existing Social Security
          initiative, the Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS). 
          This plan would let welfare families who agree to leave
          welfare within a specified period to keep income which
          normally would count against the family's welfare
          benefits.

     --   The President has proposed a demonstration program
          allowing states to create escrow savings accounts for
          long-term AFDC recipients trying to work their way off
          welfare.  Individuals could set aside an amount equal to
          state's savings from not having to pay AFDC that would be
          realized when the family head gets a job.  These savings
          would be paid back to the family in a lump sum once
          family income exceeds the need for cash assistance.

o    These legislative changes would assist states in designing 
     workfare plans that meet the President's reform objectives. 
     They would also allow welfare recipients to prepare better for
     entry into the work force and help prevent their return to the
     welfare rolls.

Enforcement of Child Support

o    President Bush understands that welfare dependency often stems
     from the failure of families to form or endure.  Thus, the
     President is working on a variety of fronts to strengthen
     families and lower the costs of raising children.  

o    President Bush is committed to making sure that absent parents
     meet their financial responsibilities, giving children at
     least the financial support they need.  In the first three
     years of the Bush Administration, child support collections by
     states rose 30 percent.  In 1986, child support orders
     recovered by the federal government totalled just $3.2
     billion.  Last year, recoveries had more than doubled to
     almost $7 billion.  About $2 billion of that amount was
     collected on behalf of families receiving welfare.

o    President bush has proposed legislative changes to extend
     child support enforcement services to recipients of other
     federally funded programs besides AFDC, and to increase health
     insurance coverage of children by their non-custodial parents.
