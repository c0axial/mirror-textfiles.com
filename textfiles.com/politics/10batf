
      Top Ten Lessons Learned by the BATF in the Waco Raid

10. If you're going to seize guns, bring along some guns of your
    own.
 9. Bullet-proof vests are not quite as bullet-proof as the
    manufacturer may claim.
 8. To ensure the element of surprise, be sure to commence the
    raid before the media sets up its cameras.
 7. Make sure the raid is near a military installation, so you
    can get re-enforcements quickly.
 6. 'Taking out' the children first is not a particularly
    effective technique for suppressing hostile fire.
 5. When planning for a no-knock raid, do not assume that the
    victims sleep-in till noon.
 4. Be sure that God is not on their side.
 3. Don't bring along the media unless you're really, really,
    really sure you are not going to get your ass kicked.
 2. Stick to raiding pacifist religious cults in California.
 1. Don't Mess with Texas! [this is the highway department's
    anti-littering slogan]
