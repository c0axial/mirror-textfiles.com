                       WHO LIVES IN HOMELESS SHELTERS?

              by Karl L. Sandwell-Weiss, A Shelter Volunteer

        Homeless people are not the drug addicted derelicts that many
people picture. Over 40% have jobs.  The jobs just don't pay enough
to get together a deposit for an apartment.  If required, they
attend 12 step programs or they must leave the shelter.  

        There are many women with children, divorced or abandoned by
their husbands. In two-parent families, one of the parents may have
lost a job because the shop or business closed down. With only one
income, it is impossible to live in this area if the wage earner is
working at the minimum wage level. People who don't have jobs are
required to look for one or they can't stay in the shelter.  

        Once they are working, their pay is turned over to the shelter
and they are given a small amount to buy personal items.  The rest
is kept in an account for them until they have enough to make a
deposit on a house or apartment.  They are required to help clean
the shelter while they live there.  They are subject 
to random drug tests, and if they fail, they move on  - there are
lots of others who need shelter.
    
        If you have a favorite charity, then please donate to it.  If
not, please consider helping the Alexandria Shelter, or one of the
others. After all, how much would it cost you to buy a couple of
bars of soap, a tube of toothpaste, and a small box of laundry
detergent the next time you go to the store?
