.
   It is popular among our people to entertain the idea
that we are a free people. We speak about our proud
heritage and the freedoms secured by the blood of our
Founding Fathers. We revel in the idea that our nation
is the most prosperous on the earth. Prosperity is measured
by the accumulation of toys and material comforts.
Unfortunitely, for many people, social status comes
before intellectual honesty. Today, our nation is largely
inhabited by a people who consider social position more
important than the survival of freedom in America. What
about you, dear reader? Do you value wealth more than
liberty? Do you prefer the tranquility of servitude to
the aminating contest of freedom? Most people respond
to these questions with an indignant remark about how
they are as patriotic as the next man. All you indignant
folks out there have been had !! While we struggle to
make ends meet our government is busy selling us down
the river, bigtime!
+
   We spend 2.5 billion each year on our defense against
the communist hordes of the east, but did you know that
international communism is simple the
****
**** military arm of the international banking
**** cartel?
****
Furthermore, that our Congress turned our nation over to
the internationaist World Bank on October the 28th, 1984?
"Preposterous !" you say, "We have a Constitution to
protect us." Wrong! For over one-hundred years our nation
has had TWO constitutions! That's right, TWO 
constitutions! As far as the courts are concerned by one
of them you are free and by the other you are a slave.
Your connections with government determine what class of
citizen you are, what class of citizen you are, what
rights and freedoms you have. By now, you may feel that
this writer is a raving lunitic. Well then, don't believe
ME, hear what the United States Supreme Court says! 
   "The thirteenth amendment is a great extension of the
powers of the national government. " United States v.
Morris, 125 Federal Reporter, page 322, 325.
+
   "The amendment (fourteeth) reversed and annulled the
original policy of the constitution," United States v.
Rhodes, 27 Federal Cases, 785, 794.
   "It is quite clear then that there is a citizenship
of the United States and a citizenship of a State, which
are distinct from each other and which depend upon
different characteristics or circumstances in the
individual." Slaughter House Cases, 83 US 395, 407.
   "The rights of citizens of the state, as such, are
not under consideration in the fourteenth amendment.
They stand as they did before the adoption of the 
fourteenth amendment, and are fully quaranteed by other
provisions." United States v. Anthony 24 Federal Cases 
829, 830
   "...the first eight amendments have uniformaly been
held not be protected from state action by the privileges
and immunities clause (of the fourteenth amendment)."
Hague v. CIO, 307 US 496, 520
   "The rights of a citizen under on (state or United
States citizenship) may be quite different from those
which he has under the other.." Colgate v. Harvey,
296 US 404, 429
+
   "The right to trial by jury in civil cases, quaranteed
by the Seventh Amendment...and the right to bear arms
quaranteed by the Second Amendment...have been distinctly
held not to be privileges and immunities of citizens of
the United States quaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment
...and in effect the same decision was made in respect
of the quarantee against prosecution, except by
indictment of a grand jury, contained in the Fifth
Amendment...and in respect of the right to be confronted
with witnesses, contained in the Sixth Amendment...
it was held that the indictment, made indespensible
by the Fifthe Amendment, and the trail by jury
quaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, were no privileges
and immunities of citizens of the United States, as
those words were used in the forteenth Amendment. We
conclude, therefore, that the exemption from compulsory
self-incrimination in not a privilege or imminity of
National citizenship quaranteed by this clause of the
Forteenth Amendment." Twining v. New Jersey,
211 US 78, 98-99.
