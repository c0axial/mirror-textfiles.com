   schizophrenic            in use. The  term  "insane"  (unsound
   unsound mind             mind) should only be used in strictly
                             legal sense. Obviously,  words   such
                             as  "crazy",  "demented",   "deviant"
                             "loony",  "mad"  and  "nuts"   should

     Language is a powerful and  important  tool  in
   shaping  ideas,  perceptions,   and   ultimately,
   public attitudes.

   Words are a mirror  of  society's  attitudes  and
   perceptions. Attitudes can  be  the  most  diffi-
   cult barrier persons with disabilities must  face
   in  gaining  full  integration,  acceptance   and
   participation in society.

   Careful presentation of  information  about  per-
   sons with disabilities  can  help  overcome  neg-
   ative attitudes  and  shape  positive  ones.  The
   Standing Committee  on  the  Status  of  Disabled
   Persons found  in  its  report  No  News  is  Bad
   News  that  vocabulary  con  create   perception.
   Demeaning,  belittling  or  negative  words   are
   a  barrier  to  greater  understanding  and   can
   trivialize genuine  support  given  by  a  commu-
   nity to persons with disabilities.

   Language  use  is  changing   as   persons   with
   disabilities claim their individual  and  collec-
   tive right to participate fully in society.

   Dated   and   disparaging   words    are    being
   replaced   with   precise,   descriptive    terms
   which  have  specific  meanings  that   are   not
   interchangeable.

                          1



   Persons  with  disabilities  are  asking,  just  as
   women  and  minority  groups   are   asking,   that
   the  media  use   respectful   terms   in   writing
   about them or issues that affect their lives.

   Individuals  with  disabilities  are   working   to
   achieve  equality,  independence  and   full   par-
   ticipation in our  society.  The  ways   in   which
   issues are reported and  the  use  of  proper  ter-
   minology  can  help   persons   with   disabilities
   reach these goals.

   P U R P O S E :

   This  booklet  suggests  current  and   appropriate
   terminology to  reflect  the  increased  participa-
   tion  by  Canadians  with   disabilities   in   our
   society.  This  booklet  is  intended  to   encour-
   age  and  promote  fair  and   accurate   portrayal
   of  persons  with  disabilities.  It  is  primarily
   designed  for  print  and  broadcast   media   pro-
   fessionals  writing  and  reporting  about   issues
   of concern to persons with disabilities.

   C O N T E N T:

   This booklet  has  two  sections   and   a   remov-
   able  insert.   GENERAL   GUIDELINES   has   infor-
   mation   on   terminology    and    portrayal    of
   persons with disabilities.

    MEDIA      COVERAGE      OF      PERSONS      WITH
    DISABILITIES deals with  reporting  on  issues  of
    concern  to   persons   with   disabilities.   The
    removable  insert  suggests   appropriate   termi-
    nology.

    G E N E R A L   G U I D E L I N E S:

    1.  It is  important   to   remember   that   each
        word  in  today's  terminology  has   a   pre-
        cise  meaning  and  that  the  words  are  not
        interchangeable.

    2   "Disabled"   and   "handicapped"    are    not
        the same thing. A disability  is  a  function-
        al limitation or restriction of  an  individu-
        al's  ability  to  perform  an   activity.   A
        "handicap"  is  an  environmental  or  attitu-
        dinal barrier that limits the opportunity  for
        a  person  to  participate   fully.   Negative
        attitudes   or   inaccessible   entrances   to
        buildings are examples of handicaps.

    3   The  word  "disabled"  is  an  adjective,  not
        a  noun.  People  are   not   conditions.   Do
        not use  "the  disabled";  use  "persons  with
        disabilities".

    4   Focus on the issue rather than the disability.
        If the disability is not relevant to the story,
        it is not necessary to report it.


                          3


    5   Try   to   avoid   categorizing   persons   with
        disabilities  as   either   super-achievers   or
        tragic   figures.   Choose   words   that    are
        non-judgemental,    non-emotional    and     are
        accurate     descriptions.      Avoid      using
        "brave",   "courageous",   "inspirational"    or
        other similar  words  that  are  routinely  used
        to describe a person with a disability.

        Remember   that   the   majority   of    persons
        with  disabilities  are  average   and   typical
        of the rest of the population.

        Similarly,  references   which   cause   discom-
        fort, quilt, pity or insult, should be  avoided.
        Words like "suffers from       stricken   with",
        "afflicted   by",   "patient",   "disease"    or
        "sick"  suggest   constant  pain  and  a   sense
        of  hopelessness.  While   this   may   be   the
        case for some individuals,  a  disability  is  a
        condition  that  does  not   necessarily   cause
        pain or require medical attention.

    6   Avoid  the  use   of  words   such  as   "burden
        "incompetent",      "defective",      "special",
        etc.   which   suggest   that    persons    with
        disabilities should be  treated  differently  or
        be  excluded    from    activities     generally
        available in the community.

                          4


    7   Be particularly  careful  with  terminology
        used  in  headlines.  Remember  that  head-
        lines make the first impression.

    8   Refer to technical aids  in  factual,  non-
        emotional  terms.  Avoid  prolonged   focus
        on support equipment.

    9   Persons with disabilities  are  comfortable
        with  the  terminology  used  to   describe
        daily living activities.  Persons  who  use
        wheelchairs go  for  "walks".  people  with
        visual impairments  "see"  what  you  mean,
        etc. A disability may just mean  that  some
        things are  done  in  a  different  manner;
        however,  that  does  not  mean  the  words
        used  to  describe  the  activity  must  be
        different.

    10  Remember that  although  some  disabilities
        are not visible, it does not mean they  are
        less real. Individuals with invisible  dis-
        abilities such  as  epilepsy,  haemophilia,
        mental health, learning,  or  developmental
        disabilities   also   encounter    negative
        attitudes and barriers.

       Researching, Writing and Reporting

       1    Too often, when a person with  a  disability
            is featured in a story that has several pos-
            sible angles, the human interest story  line
            dominates,  e.g.,  how  the  individual  has
            overcome great odds.

       2    There are few examples  of  in-depth  cover-
            age of issues of  particular  importance  to
            persons with  disabilities  (e.g.,  lack  of
            physical access to  facilities,  employment,
            poverty, etc.).

       3    Persons with disabilities are  seldom  asked
            for their  views  on  stories  dealing  with
            transportation,   the   environment,   child
            care, etc.

            The media  can  help  create  and  reinforce
            positive  attitudes  towards  persons   with
            disabilities.  Progress  has  been  made  in
            recent years  and  media  professionals  are
            asking  advice  on   how   to   report   on,
            discuss, and write about disability.

                          6



    Bridging the Communicutions Gap

    Here  are  some  suggestions  to   improve   com-
    munications with persons with disabilities.

    1   When talking with a person with a  disability
        speak  directly  to   him/her   rather   than
        through  a  companion  who  may   be   there.

    2   Avoid putting persons  with  disabilities  on
        a  pedestal  and  using  patronizing   terms.
        Interview  a  person  with  a  disability  as
        you would any other person.

    3   Do not unnecessarily  emphasize  differences.
        Having a "one  of them"  versus a "one of us"
        attitude  only serves  to reinforce barriers.

    4   In  visual  treatments   (e.g.,   television,
        photographs),  do  not  dwell  on   technical
        aids   or   adaptive   devices   unless,   of
        course,  the  purpose  is  to  introduce   or
        discuss a particular aid or device.

    Following an interview, ask yourself:

    1   Am I writing this piece because  it  involves
        a  person with a disability  or  because  the
        issue and  related  circumstances  are  rele-
        vant to the general  population?  If  it  did
        not  involve  a  person  with  a  disability,
        would I still want to write it?

                          7



    2   Is  a  reference to a disability necessary to
        the story? If it is, am I using the   correct
        terminology   (e.g.,  "uses  a   wheelchair",
        and not "confined to a wheelchair")?

    3   Is   this   piece   accurate   and  unbiased?
        Have I avoided sensationalism?



    C O N C L U S I O N

    Journalists  can contribute to  a  more  positive
    and  accurate image  of  persons  with  disabili-
    ties. The information  provided  to  the  general
    public, and  the  ways  in  which  this  informa-
    tion  is  presented,  often  create  a  framework
    for the attitudes people have  and  the  ways  in
    which they interact with  individuals  with  dis-
    abilities. If the coverage of  disability-related
    issues is done in a  non-emotional,  factual  and
    integrative manner,  the  public  will  no  doubt
    begin to  question  the  prejudices  and  stereo-
    types that still exist.
