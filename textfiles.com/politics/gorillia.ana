	      PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS IN GUERRILLA WARFARE

From the folks at:  Congressional Research Service of The Library Of Congress

PREFACE

   Guerrilla warfare is essentially a political war.  Therefore, its area of
operations exceeds the territorial limits of conventional warfare.  To
penetrate the political entity itself:	The "Political Animal" the Aristotle
defined.

   In effect, the human being should be considered the priority objective in a
political war.	And concieved as the military target of guerrilla war, the
human has his most critical point in his mind.	Once his mind has been reached,
the "politica l animal" has been defeated, without necessarily recieving
bullets.

   Guerrilla warfare is born and grows in the political envirnment:  in the
constant combat to dominate that area of political mentality that is inherent
to all human beings and which collectively constitutes the "environment" in
which guerrilla warfare moves, and which is where precisely its victory or
failure is defined.

   This conception of guerrilla warfare as political war turns psychological
Operations into the decisive factor of the results.  The target, then, is the
minds of the population, all the population:  our troops, the enemy troops, and
the civilian population.

   This book is a manual for the training of guerrillas in psychological
operations, and its application to the concrete case of the Christian and
democratic crusade being waged in Nicaragua by the Freedom Commandos.

	    PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELEGENCE
			  PRESS RELEASE

DECEMBER 5, 1984

   This manual was written and printed up in several editions by the CIA.  The
manual talks of overthrowing the Sandanistas.  This raises the question of
whether the Boland Amendment was violated.  The manual talks of "nuetralizing"
Sandanista officials and creating martyrs.  This raises question to whether
Executive order 12333, which prohibits assassinations, was violated.  The
manual also talks about shooting civilians trying to leave a captured town,
blackmailing others to work for the contras, and endangering innocent people by
inciting violence in mass demonstrations.  These matters raise the issue of
whether they are consistant with United States policy.

   The committee believes that the manual caaused embarrassment to the United
States and should never have been released in any of its various forms.
Specific actions that it describes are repugnant to American values.

    The committee believes that this record also reflects insufficient concern
about congressional and legal restrictions on CIA activities.  A majority of
the committee concludes that the manual represents a violation of the Boland
Amendment.  CIA officials up the chain of command either never read the manual
or were never made aware of it.  Neglegence, not intent to violate the law,
marked the manuals history.
