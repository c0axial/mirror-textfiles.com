                    PRESIDENT BUSH ON ENERGY:
                 ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND INITIATIVES

     "The driving force behind [our National Energy Strategy] is
     straightforward.  It relies on the power of the marketplace,
     the common sense of the American people and the responsible
     leadership of industry and government."

                         President George Bush
                         February 20, 1991


Summary

o    The President introduced his National Energy Strategy (NES)
     a year and a half ago.  The NES is a comprehensive and
     balanced approach toward energy production and efficiency
     and will improve our Nation's energy security, enhance
     environmental quality, and spur economic growth.

o    The NES builds on the President's record on energy and
     includes incentives to increase domestic production of oil
     and gas, promotes energy efficiency and conservation,
     encourages development and use of renewable and alternate
     sources of energy, and supports the clean use of our
     Nation's abundant coal resources and the safe use of nuclear
     power. 

o    The President's NES includes measures to increase domestic
     energy production and efficiency.  It does not impose new
     taxes or harsh command and control regulations on American
     industry and consumers.  Instead, the NES removes regulatory
     barriers, relies on competition, and invests in research and
     development to achieve our energy goals.  For example, it
     removes many of the current tax penalties on domestic
     extraction investments and at the same time relieves many of
     the regulatory burdens that prevent cleaner burning natural
     gas from reaching the marketplace.

Oil and Gas

o    From his business experience as an oilman in Texas,
     President Bush understands how important the oil and gas
     industry is to the United States.  He is committed to
     restoring jobs to this vital and valuable sector of our
     economy by encouraging domestic production and reducing the
     need for imports.

Energy -- page 2

o    President Bush has proposed that Congress reform the
     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) as it applies to domestic oil
     and gas industries in order to remove serious disincentives
     to production.  He has also fought Congressional efforts to
     restrict state prorationing and to expand the moratorium on
     leasing in certain areas of the outer continental shelf.

o    President Bush opposes an amendment recently passed by the
     House of Representatives which would prohibit certain forms
     of state regulation of natural gas production.  This
     restriction on gas prorationing provides unnecessary Federal
     regulation and would hinder states from conserving
     resources, preventing waste, and protecting the correlative
     rights of gas producers and land and royalty owners. 

o    President Bush pushed for and signed the Natural Gas
     Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, which will completely
     eliminate natural gas wellhead price controls by January 1,
     1993.

o    The Bush Administration has proposed reducing royalties paid
     by stripper wells on Federal lands.  The revised regulation
     will create a sliding royalty scale that will provide an
     incentive to continue operating marginal wells that are in
     danger of shutting down.  

o    The President pushed through Congress $2.25 billion in oil
     and gas tax incentives in 1990, about $1.9 billion of which
     will accrue to the benefit of independents.

o    The Administration has proposed increased funding for
     natural gas research and development, particularly for
     technologies to increase utilization of natural gas for
     environmental compliance.  The Department of Energy has also
     restructured its natural gas program to shift research and
     development activities to meet nearer-term objectives and
     cost-sharing investment with industry.

o    In order to free oil producers from unnecessary governmental
     burdens, the President's NES includes measures to reduce
     regulatory barriers and to enhance domestic energy
     production which could increase U.S. oil production by 3.8
     million barrels per day over the next twenty years.  The NES
     as a whole will reduce projected oil imports by one-third.

o    The President strongly supports efforts to develop new oil
     recovery technology as a means of keeping our oil industry
     healthy in the long-term.  A central component of the NES is
     a new program of joint Federal/private investment to advance
     oil recovery technology.  The initial 14 projects were Energy -- page 3

     approved in 1992 with a value of $97 million.  The NES oil
     research program includes an aggressive technology transfer
     component specifically designed to assist independent
     producers.

o    The President supports the expansion of worldwide strategic
     petroleum stocks available to offset future oil supply
     disruptions and has resumed fill of our Nation's Strategic
     Petroleum Reserve. 

o    As a part of his National Energy Strategy, the President has
     announced measures which will allow the gas business to
     operate with more flexibility and to seize market
     opportunities by removing regulatory barriers which impede
     natural gas use.  

     --   Initiatives in President Bush's NES are expected to
          increase consumption of clean burning natural gas by
          20% or about 3.8 trillion cubic feet by the year 2000.

     --   Revenue for domestic producers of natural gas is
          projected to increase by over $50 billion during the
          period 1992-2000. 

o    President Bush knows that access is vital to the U.S. oil
     and gas industry.  His NES calls for access to the
     previously restricted coastal plain of the Arctic National
     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and some Outer Continental Shelf
     areas under strict environmental safeguards.  At the same
     time, the President has safeguarded the integrity of these
     areas by signing the Oil Spill Pollution Act, which requires
     double hull tankers, a $1 billion cleanup trust fund, and
     increases polluter liability and enforcement tools.  The NES
     also supports an increase in the production of California
     heavy oil and access to export markets.

o    To promote domestic gas production, the President's NES
     proposes legislation which will streamline gas pipeline
     construction regulations and develop more efficient
     environmental review procedures.  In addition, the Federal
     Energy Regulatory Commission issued the most sweeping
     reforms of natural gas transportation in fifty years (the
     "restructuring" rule) and removed regulatory barriers to the
     use of natural gas vehicles.

o    NES recommendations on alternative fuels and electricity
     regulatory reform through amending the Public Utility and
     Holding Company Act and issuance of the "WEPCo" rule will
     also substantially increase utilization of natural gas.

Nuclear Energy and Coal

o    The President's National Energy Strategy proposes
     legislation to reform the nuclear licensing process and the
     removal of other barriers to permit nuclear power to
     contribute cleanly, economically, and safely to our future
     electricity needs.  In addition, the Administration
     supported issuance by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of a
     final rule for the renewal of existing nuclear powerplants'
     licenses where safety can be assured.

o    The NES supports research on next generation and advanced
     reactors.  In February 1992, the Department of Energy signed
     a cooperative agreement with industry to jointly fund a $200
     million effort to develop advanced light water designs to
     the point of commercial standardization.

o    The NES also contains initiatives to ensure progress on the
     management and disposal of nuclear waste, and the Department
     of Energy has resumed investigative work at the Yucca
     Mountain candidate site after successful conclusion of years
     of legal dispute. 

o    The President has supported full funding, including $500
     million in the fiscal year 1993 budget, for the Clean Coal
     Technology Demonstration Program, a $5 billion industry
     cost-shared demonstration program aimed at introducing
     innovative methods of using our Nation's abundant coal
     resources more cleanly, efficiently, and economically.

o    The Administration has expanded efforts to promote the
     export of U.S. coals and clean coal technologies to enhance
     the U.S. balance of trade, create American jobs, and aid
     both economic growth and environmental protection in
     countries facing rapid increases in electricity demand.

o    The Administration issued regulations (the "WEPCo" rule) to
     facilitate compliance by the electric utility industry with
     new Clean Air Act requirements and remove uncertainty about
     power plant modifications under the new source review
     requirements.

Renewable Energy and Alternative Fuels

o    The Bush Administration has encouraged development and use
     of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and
     hydroelectric power and other energy sources like ethanol. 
     The President's FY93 budget increases renewable energy
     research and development to $250 million, over 65% more than
     when he took office.
Energy -- page 5

     --   In addition, the President established the National
          Renewable Energy Laboratory in September 1991,
          indicating the importance attached by the
          Administration to renewable energy research.

o    The President signed legislation extending tax incentives
     for domestically produced ethanol through the year 2000. 
     These incentives, totalling more than $220 million over five
     years, will help the farm economy and ensure the widespread
     availability of this clean, secure fuel.  The Administration
     also supports legislation to remove an artificial barrier to
     greater use of ethanol by expanding tax exemptions and
     credits for ethanol blends.

     --   In addition, the Bush Administration has launched an
          accelerated research effort to develop cost-
          competitive, clean-burning domestic fuels from a wide
          variety of agricultural products.  The President
          proposed spending more than $50 million on this
          initiative in fiscal year 1993.

o    The President has supported legislation extending renewable
     energy investment tax credits for solar and geothermal
     facilities.

o    The President signed legislation amending the Public Utility
     Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) to allow large facilities
     using renewable energy projects to qualify for the benefits
     PURPA provides.  As part of the National Energy Strategy,
     the Bush Administration proposes to further amend PURPA to
     remove project size limits in PURPA and reduce fuel use
     restrictions for such facilities.

o    The Administration issued new regulations to simplify the
     process for improving efficiency at privately-owned but
     Federally licensed hydroelectric projects and launched
     Hydropower 2002 an initiative to improve efficiency and
     increase production at Federal hydropower facilities.  As
     part of the National Energy Strategy, the Administration has
     proposed substantial regulatory reform to enable us to take
     advantage of our ample hydroelectric power resources,
     especially those at existing dams, while protecting
     environmental quality.

o    The NES further encourages the development and use of
     alternative fuels and technologies through research and
     development and by requiring centrally-fueled fleets to
     purchase vehicles capable of using alternative fuels.  The
     President has directed all Federal agencies to maximize
     their purchases of alternative fuel vehicles.  The
     government has already purchased over 3,000 such vehicles
     and plans to acquire 5,000 more in FY93.

o    In October 1991, the President announced the creation of the
     U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium, a four-year, $260 million
     joint research venture with the Nation's three largest
     automobile manufactures, the electric utility industry and
     others to develop a new generation of batteries to make
     electric vehicles attractive and available by the year 2000.

Increasing Energy and Economic Efficiency

o    Along with increasing energy production, President Bush is
     committed to achieving greater efficiency in every element
     of energy production and use.  The President's FY93 budget
     proposes over $330 million for conservation energy research
     and development, double the amount when he took office. 

o    The President, leading through example, issued an Executive
     Order on Federal Energy Management, directing all Federal
     agencies to reduce overall energy consumption in Federal
     buildings by 20% by the year 2000 and to reduce fuel
     consumption in Federal vehicles by 10% by 1995.  These
     conservation measures will save American taxpayers an
     estimated $800 million in annual energy costs and cut
     Federal energy consumption by about 100,000 barrels per day
     of oil equivalent.

o    To increase efficient use of energy, the Department of
     Energy has strengthened efficiency standards for many
     energy-consuming household appliances.

o    The Administration also initiated a number of voluntary
     programs to increase private investment in more efficient
     lighting, building, computer and related technologies in
     support of the energy, economic and environmental objectives
     of the National Energy Strategy.

o    The President signed the National Affordable Housing Act,
     which includes provisions for energy efficiency standards
     for new construction of publicly-assisted housing and for
     mortgage financing incentives for energy efficiency.

o    The Bush Administration has expanded efforts to support
     development by States and utilities of integrated resource
     planning, a process in which new supply resources and
     investments in energy efficiency compete to satisfy
     electricity needs.  The Administration also provided tax
     free treatment of utility discounts on consumers'
     electricity bills for efficiency investments.

o    The Bush Administration has supported legislative and
     regulatory changes to reduce electricity prices to consumers
     through increased competition in wholesale power markets and
     expanded access to electricity transmission services.

Energy -- page 7

o    The President proposed, negotiated, and signed into law
     major new transportation legislation, the Intermodal Surface
     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which will reduce oil
     use in the transportation sector by increasing Federal
     funding of mass transit and by giving State and local
     governments flexibility to fund other energy conserving
     transportation projects.
