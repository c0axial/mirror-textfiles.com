Subject: Are there many Broadcast Stations Like this in NA ?
Status: RO

RADIO FREE AMERICA
==================
HEARD ON SHORTWAVE 7.435 MHZ AT 02:00-04:00Z IN JERUSALEM WITH A 5-7 SIGNAL
USING A MOTOROLA MICOM-X AND A 1/2 WAVE DIPOLE FOR 40 METERS.
SIGNALS FADED AFTER 04:00Z.
FIRST HOUR WAS A SHOW CALLED "FOR THE PEOPLE" HOSTED BY CHUCK CARTER.
MAINLY DOWN ON THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM AND PREACHED POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC REFORM.
TEL. (800) 888-9999.
MAILING ADDRESS:3 RIVER ST.
WHITE SPRINGS, FLORIDA 32096.
BROADCAST ORIGINATED FROM TN. STATION WWCR - ALSO KLVE.
2ND HOUR WAS HOSTED BY TOM VALENTINE - ALONG THE SAME ECONOMIC, POLITICAL
LINES BUT WITH A WHITE SUPREMACY THEME. CALLERS GAVE THEIR OPINIONS
(THE SHOW IS OBVIOUSLY RECORDED) ABOUT THEIR FEARS OF "THE JEW CONTROLLED
MEDIA" AND "COMMUNIST JEW SOCIALISTS" DESTROYING THE VALUES OF "REAL AMERICANS"
THE "CHRISTIAN FAMILY STRUCTURE," ETC.
THE AGENDA ALSO GOT INTO THE "ZIONIST ENEMY", DANGERS OF CERTAIN PRO-ISRAEL
SENATORS...BUT CLARIFIED THAT NOT ALL JEWS ARE ZIONISTS.
BOTH SHOWS EVERY SO OFTEN GAVE OUT THE 800 NUMBER TO PROMOTE THE SALES OF
VARIOUS PROPAGANDA PUBLICATIONS. THE FIRST SHOW'S NEWSLETTER IS CALLED "FOR THE
PEOPLE" AND VALENTINE'S MESSAGE IS THROUGH A MAGZINE CALLED "SPOTLIGHT".
JAMMING TOOK PLACE ON THE SAME FREQUENCY BUT SIGNALS WERE WEAK COMPARED WITH
R.F.A. PERHAPS THE SIGNAL WAS BEING BEAMED TOWARDS A DIFFERENT AREA.
SEARS WAS THE ONLY COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER DURING THE PROGRAM. (ALUMINUM SIDING).
================================================================
What's their beef ? Who are these people and how popular/big is their
audience ? Is this station associated with the "Liberty Lobby" ?
Who exactly are they intending their shortwave broadcasts to be heard by ?
Are these stations operating under license of the FCC ?
They also have a link via 2 geo-sychronous satellites.

-- Additional information from secondary source:

You might get a catalog from Archives on Audio of the Radio Free America
series by Nip Tuck and Dave Emory.  A worthwhile clipping in itself, aside
from the contents of the tapes.

AOA, Box 170023, SF CA  94117 USA  -  415-346-1840

Subject: Fascism Almanac: Clippings Sought

Please note dear readers, this is NOT the Liberty Lobby's latter-day
RFA show, this one had the name earlier, and the producers are rather
staunchly anti-fascist - hardly the sort who'd sing the Horst Wessel
song at the open of a meeting.

I highly recommend at least getting the catalog from Archives on
Audio, and getting the press packets from the Napa Sentinel [425
Lincoln Ave., Napa CA 94558 - (707) 257-6272] on the Drug Tug, Inslaw,
Bankruptcy Court and other scandals.

Happy reading/listening!

>Does anyone know where Radio Free American broadcasts from?

My guess is someplace in Florida.  Their sponsor is the Sun Radio Network, 
which can be reached at 2870 Scherer Dr., St. Petersburg, FL  33716.

They broadcast every day on North America One Satellite Radio Network from
Spacenet III, the Sun Radio Network, on Transponder 5, Audio 6.8.  Also it is
carried (the method I use) on short wave WWCR, 7435 kHz in the 41 meter band.

They also offer cassette tapes of Tom Valentine's shows.

Enjoy, Jon Volkoff, eidetics@cerf.net
