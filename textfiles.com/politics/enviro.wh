PRESIDENT BUSH ON THE ENVIRONMENT

     "I am here to make a case I feel very strongly about -- and
     that is the case for a cleaner environment.  It is a case
     based not only on our own health and safety, and not only on
     the obligation we have to future generations.  It is based
     on the knowledge that successful economic development and
     environmental protection go hand in hand.  You cannot have
     one without the other."

                    Vice President George Bush
                    August 31, 1988

     "Through our firm commitment and our substantial
     investment, we have improved significantly the quality
     of our air, land and water resources.  The United
     States leads the world in environmental protection and
     we intend to keep it that way."

                    President George Bush
                    Earth Day 1990

Summary

o    Environmental protection is stronger than ever under the
     Bush Presidency, whether measured by pollution reduced,
     polluters punished, agreements reached, or Federal dollars
     targeted to addressing high priority environmental problems.
  
o    President Bush believes that environmental protection and
     economic development are inextricably linked --
     environmental stewardship requires that policies in each
     area reflect this linkage.  As the President has said on
     many occasions, sound policies promote both while
     compromising neither.  

o    The President has more than doubled research and development
     of technologies that will boost both economic performance
     and environmental quality and has launched initiatives to
     link increased trade with stronger environmental protection.
     
 
o    The President has sponsored and implemented innovative,
     cost-effective programs that use the power of the
     marketplace to solve environmental problems.  These include 

FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                  Page 2

     programs such as "Green Lights" to promote energy
     efficiency, the "33/50" toxic waste reduction program,
     innovative clean air emissions credits, and "Cash-for-
     Clunkers" to get the most polluting cars off the road.

o    The President believes that existing environmental laws
     should be vigorously and firmly enforced.  The Bush
     Administration has stepped up efforts to ensure that "the
     polluter pays" for environmental damage and has secured more
     indictments and fines than any previous Administration.

o    President Bush has provided substantial international
     leadership for environmental protection.  Under President
     Bush, the U.S. has actively participated in nearly two dozen
     new environmental agreements.  The President has
     successfully negotiated treaties and agreements such as
     those to protect the Antarctic, end driftnet fishing, and
     halt CFC production.

o    In 1990, President Bush called on Congress to elevate the
     Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet status and
     thereby create the U.S. Department of the Environment.
     Despite widespread bipartisan support, Congress has not
     passed this bill.  

o    In the President's FY93 budget, which freezes overall
     domestic discretionary spending, priority environmental
     investment is increased by $3.2 billion, or 21 percent. 
     Since President Bush took office, EPA's operating program
     has increased by 54 percent.

o    The U.S. has some of the toughest environmental laws in the
     world and a record on environmental protection that is
     second to none in areas ranging from clean air to endangered
     species.  The U.S. currently spends nearly $130 billion a
     year (about 2 percent of our GDP) on controlling pollution
     and protecting the environment, far more than any other
     nation. 

And the President is committed to doing more:

     "Some will look at the record and say that it isn't enough. 
     I have a surprise for them.  I couldn't agree more."

Promoting Clean Air

o    President Bush proposed, negotiated, and then signed the
     Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the most comprehensive and
     innovative air pollution legislation in the world.  

     --   The President's Clean Air Act will reduce toxic air
          emissions by over 75 percent, cut acid rain emissions
          in half, and significantly reduce smog in America's
          cities.

     --   When fully implemented, the Clean Air Act will reduce
          air pollutant emissions by 56 billion pounds annually,
          roughly 224 pounds of pollutants for every man, woman,
          and child in this country.

     --   The innovative system of tradable sulfur dioxide
          emissions credits in the Clean Air Act will provide the
          same cuts in emissions as old-style regulation, but
          they will save the U.S. economy over $1 billion
          annually.

o    The EPA will issue rules to reduce emissions of methane, a
     greenhouse gas, from landfills and will pursue several other
     methane reduction programs.  In total, the Administration's
     strategy projects methane emission reductions equivalent to
     25 to 58 million tons of carbon by the year 2000. 

o    Under the Clean Air Act, oxygenated fuels must be sold in
     the most polluted areas of the U.S. by 1993 to reduce the
     carbon monoxide levels in cities where the levels are above
     our national standards.  Alternative fuels and reformulated
     gasoline, to be introduced by 1995, will cut ozone-forming
     hydrocarbons by 300 million pounds per year.

o    The Bush Administration is working to increase the
     efficiency and use of alternative fuels.  President Bush's
     National Energy Strategy encourages the use and production
     of natural gas through regulatory reform and promotes R&D to
     increase use of renewable sources of energy and ethanol.

o    The Administration has reached agreements with industry
     which will lead to a reduction in emissions of sulfur
     dioxide by 90 percent at the Navajo power plant in northern
     Arizona.  This will provide cleaner air and improve
     visibility in the Grand Canyon.   

o    The Administration's "Cash-for-Clunkers" plan would help
     remove old cars -- the biggest polluters and the biggest gas
     guzzlers -- from the road.

Global Climate Change

o    The United States is the only nation besides the Netherlands
     to have published a detailed action plan for limiting net
     greenhouse gas emissions.

     --   This action plan is projected to hold net emissions in
          the year 2000 to only 1 to 6 percent over 1990 levels.

o    President Bush favors greenhouse gas reduction plans
     individually tailored for each country -- arbitrary targets
     and timetables are inequitable, inefficient, and
     environmentally inferior.

o    In order to determine what should be done to address global
     climate change, the President's interdisciplinary Global
     Change Research Program (GCRP), begun in 1989, invests more
     in climate research -- $2.7 billion in the last three years
     -- than the rest of the world combined. 

     --   This year President Bush's budget requested almost $1.4
          billion for global climate change research, a 24
          percent increase over last year.  The President has
          accelerated research six-fold since 1989.

     --   As part of the GCRP, the Mission to Planet Earth uses
          satellites to monitor changes in the environment,
          recently providing data on the status of the
          stratospheric ozone layer and the effects of the
          eruption of Mount Pinatubo on the global climate.

o    The President proposed and implemented a new transportation
     law which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving
     automobile efficiency, increasing investment in public
     transportation, and developing other means of
     environmentally-friendly travel.

o    The President's National Energy Strategy contains numerous
     provisions to increase energy conservation and efficiency in
     transportation, industry, and electricity generation; in
     residential, commercial, and Federal government buildings;
     and to increase the use of improved energy technologies. 
     These steps will further help reduce greenhouse emissions.

o    The United States and ten other countries of the Americas
     signed an agreement in May 1992 to establish the Inter-
     American Institute for Global Change Research.
FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                  Page 5

o    The U.S. has also committed $25 million for country studies
     to help developing countries formulate action plans to
     reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  The U.S. has
     committed to a supplemental contribution of $50 million to
     the World Bank's Global Facility to assist countries in
     implementing the Framework Convention on Global Climate
     Change.

o    At the Rio conference, the United States made available to
     governments and scientists around the world thousands of
     computer disks containing billions of bytes of data on
     global climate change.

Protecting the Ozone Layer 

o    In February 1992, President Bush accelerated the U.S.
     deadline for phaseout of ozone-depleting substances
     (including CFCs) to the end of 1995, four years ahead of
     international deadlines set in the amended Montreal
     Protocol, and called on other nations to match the U.S.
     commitment.  The Clean Air Act of 1990 also includes a
     schedule for phase-out of HCFCs, which is not required under
     the provisions of the Montreal Protocol.

o    The Bush Administration implemented a fee on U.S. production
     of ozone-harming substances to accelerate reductions. 
     Today, U.S. CFC production levels are more than 42 percent
     below the level allowed by the London amendments to the
     Montreal Protocol.

o    The United States was the first nation to provide funds to
     developing countries to help reduce CFCs.  The U.S. will
     provide $50 million over three years to assist developing
     nations meet the terms of the Montreal Protocol.

Enhancing Forests and Public Lands

o    At Home: President Bush has added over 1.5 million new acres 
     to our treasury of national parks, forests, and wildlife
     refuges and added 6.4 million acres to the vast wilderness
     system.

o    The President's budget requests for his "America the
     Beautiful" initiative (including funds for improved
     stewardship of national parks, wildlife refuges, forest and
     public lands, and partnerships with states for parks and
     outdoor recreation), has grown from $863 million in 1989 to
     $1.8 billion in 1993.  Unfortunately, Congress has refused
     to provide full funding for key components of this program.


FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                  Page 6

o    The Administration has ended clear-cutting as a standard
     practice in national forests and adopted the principles of
     "ecosystem management" for forests and other public lands.  

o    The President has developed and begun implementing a long-
     term campaign to enlist state and local participation in the
     planting of one billion trees each year and to expand and
     improve national parks, forests, and wildlife.  Congress has
     consistently shortchanged this initiative.

o    And Abroad: The President has proposed to double
     international forestry assistance through his Forests for
     the Future Initiative (which has as its goal halting net
     global forest loss by the end of the century) from $1.35
     billion to $2.7 billion.  The U.S. has already pledged a
     "down payment" of $150 million to this effort.

     --   Since 1988, total U.S. bilateral forest conservation
          assistance has increased by 156 percent.

o    At the Houston Economic Summit in 1990, President Bush
     proposed, and the G-7 Industrialized Nations adopted, a call
     for a global convention to protect and improve the world's
     forests. 

o    The President's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative
     arranges debt-for-nature swaps and creates environmental
     trust funds to protect critical forest habitat in Latin
     America and the Caribbean.  
     
Preserving Wetlands

o    The President is committed to his goal of "no net loss of
     wetlands."  At the same time, he seeks to balance this
     objective with the need to protect the legitimate rights of
     farmers, small businesses, and other landowners.

o    The President has more than doubled Federal spending for
     wetlands protection and restoration, from $295 million in
     FY89 to $600 million in FY92 and $812 million requested for
     FY93.  

o    Since 1989, the Bush Administration, in conjunction with
     state and private partners, has acquired and conserved
     almost 2 million acres of wetlands.  The Administration is
     expanding the Everglades National Park by 106,000 acres.

o    President Bush signed the North American Wetlands
     Conservation Act in which the United States, together with
     Canada and Mexico, helps protect migratory waterfowl 

FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                  Page 7

     populations.  The President has once again proposed $15
     million to fully fund this North American Waterfowl
     Management Plan in FY93, but Congress refused to fund the
     plan in FY92 and cut the President's FY93 request in half.

o    The President has requested full funding for a voluntary
     "wetlands reserve" of up to one million acres as provided
     for in the 1990 Farm Bill, but Congress has not matched his
     funding request.

o    The U.S. currently chairs the Convention on Wetlands of
     International Importance, the major agreement on wetlands
     conservation and wise use.  The U.S. is the single largest
     contributor to the Convention's Wetland Conservation Fund,
     which assists developing countries in implementing the
     Convention.

o    The Administration supports expansion of wetlands protection
     under the Clean Water Act to cases in which wetlands may be
     damaged by dredging operations -- the present protection
     applies only when wetlands are filled.

o    The Bush Administration is developing a classification and
     mitigation banking plan to reconcile environmental and
     economic imperatives through an outright ban on development
     of the most ecologically important wetlands, while allowing
     some development in other areas provided that wetlands
     losses are offset through the creation and improvement of
     other wetlands.

Protecting Endangered Species

o    President Bush is committed to the protection and
     conservation of wildlife.  The Endangered Species Act is one
     of the strongest wildlife protection laws in the world.

     --   Since 1989, the Administration has completed recovery
          plans for more than 110 species, revised plans for more
          than 20 additional species, and expanded efforts to
          identify candidate species.

     --   Since taking office, the Bush Administration has more
          than doubled funding to protect endangered species.
     
o    The U.S. led the way to international bans on driftnet
     fishing and trade in African elephant ivory and hawksbill
     turtle shells.
FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                  Page 8

o    Since 1989, land management agencies have adopted many
     ecosystem management principles to do a better job of
     conserving species and habitats.

o    The U.S. Forest Service has adopted a program called "Every
     Species Counts" to recover and conserve over 200 Federally
     listed threatened and endangered species.  The Forest
     Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the National Fish
     and Wildlife Service are cooperating on a program called
     "Bring Back the Natives" to restore native plant and animal
     species in aquatic habitats.

o    The Department of Defense has taken over 100 separate
     actions on 80 military installations to identify and protect
     significant biological resources on DoD lands.

o    In preparation for the U.N. Earth Summit in Rio, the Bush
     Administration pledged to establish a national center for
     biodiversity information and to host a meeting of
     international experts to advise nations on how to conduct
     biodiversity inventories.

o    Spotted Owl: Perhaps no recent issue has demonstrated more
     clearly the stringency of U.S. law on endangered species, or
     the difficulty of balancing it with the economic costs to
     human beings, than the case of the northern spotted owl.  

o    President Bush has sought to achieve a balance in developing
     a strategy to save the spotted owl and at the same time
     mitigate the economic costs to the Pacific Northwest.  To
     this effect, the Administration has developed a
     "Preservation Plan" which will save half the jobs which
     would be lost under other plans, while still ensuring the
     owl's survival.  

o    The President has submitted the Preservation Plan to
     Congress and hopes that Congress will consider both the
     economic and the environmental ramifications of the decision
     on the preservation of the spotted owl.

o    Florida Panther: The Fish and Wildlife Service, National
     Park Service, Florida Department of Natural Resources, and
     Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission are developing
     a habitat preservation plan for the existing Florida panther
     population (estimated to be 30-50 panthers). 
FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                  Page 9

Vigorous Enforcement

o    During the Bush Administration, more indictments have been
     sought; more civil, criminal, and administrative fines have
     been imposed; and more prison sentences for violators have
     been secured than in the prior 18 years combined.

o    The Bush Administration collected record monetary penalties
     for water pollution violations in 1991, tripling the
     previous record.

o    The Administration has filed landmark suits to protect
     the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, and the
     Everglades.

o    The President's FY93 budget proposes to increase EPA
     enforcement funding by $15 million; the EPA enforcement
     budget has increased by 70 percent during President Bush's
     administration.

International Leadership

o    During the Bush Presidency, nearly two dozen new
     international environmental agreements and initiatives have
     been launched with active U.S. participation.  These
     agreements have ranged from the Montreal Protocol to end CFC
     production to successful efforts to halt driftnet fishing.

o    At the 1991 London Economic Summit, an environmental
     coalition issued a detailed scorecard on the environmental
     performance of seven leading industrial nations.  The United
     States earned the highest score overall and top honors in 8
     out of 10 categories.

o    In 1991, the U.S. signed far-reaching international
     agreements to prevent and clean up pollution, protect
     wildlife, and monitor more closely the Antarctic and the
     Arctic Ocean.

o    The Bush Administration has put together the U.S. - Asia
     Environmental Partnership, a long-term private sector
     initiative to bring government and business together to
     address environmental problems in the Asia-Pacific Region
     through education, information sharing, and loans for
     environmental improvement.

o    In 1990, President Bush supported the creation of the East
     European Environmental Center in Budapest, Hungary.  Known
     throughout the region as the "Bush Center," it will build a
     community of private parties concerned with environmental 

FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                 Page 10

     protection.  The United States has already provided support
     for several local projects on matters such as pesticide
     disposal, removing lead from drinking water, and controlling
     powerplant emissions.

o    The Bush Administration, working with private U.S.
     interests, has established four energy efficiency centers in
     Eastern Europe to provide improved information to these
     countries to improve their energy efficiency programs and
     practices as they transform their economies to market-based
     programs.

o    The Administration has recently put in place the America's
     21st Century Program to help Latin American countries
     introduce renewable energy technologies and the Assisting
     Deployment of Energy Practices and Technologies program to
     assist developing countries improve their procedures and
     technologies for supply and use of energy.

o    To assist developing countries reduce growth in greenhouse
     gas emissions, the Administration this year has announced
     added funding for the General Environment Facility of the
     World Bank, plus added funds to countries for improving
     their forest maintenance and restoration programs.  Further,
     the U.S. will lead cooperative efforts with developing
     countries to help them identify their critical problems and
     available opportunities to deal with global climate and
     environmental issues.

o    At the United Nations Conference on Environment and
     Development (UNCED) at Rio, President Bush expanded U.S.
     technical and financial assistance programs for
     environmental purposes; offered a bold initiative to improve
     protection of the world's forests; and promoted a brand of
     environmentalism that sees market-oriented economic
     development as the key to protecting the Earth.

o    In conjunction with his efforts to conclude a North American
     Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), President Bush is pursuing an
     ambitious program of cooperation with Mexico on a wide range
     of environmental issues.

     --   The United States and Mexico have developed an
          integrated border environmental plan to protect
          environmental quality in the border area.  

     --   The Bush Administration has committed $138 million in
          FY92 to help protect the border environment and has
          requested $241 million for FY93.  Unfortunately,
          Congress has cut the President's request.  

FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                 Page 11

     --   The Mexican government has budgeted $460 million for
          the first three years of the plan. 

     --   The United States and Mexico are negotiating an
          agreement to expand cooperation enforcement and
          environmental protection programs beyond the border
          area.

Coastal and Ocean Stewardship

o    The President wants to ensure that coasts and oceans
     continue to receive necessary attention.  Almost half of the
     U.S. population lives and works in coastal areas.  

o    The Bush Administration has designated four new marine
     sanctuaries (the marine equivalent of national parks), more
     than doubling the area of these sanctuaries, and has
     protected six new estuarine reserve access areas where
     rivers meet the sea.  He has also tripled the protection of
     coastal barrier islands to encompass 1,211 miles of
     shoreline.

o    President Bush declared a moratorium until the year 2000 on
     offshore oil and gas development off most of the West Coast,
     Southern Florida, and New England.

o    In 1990, the President signed the Oil Spill Pollution Act,
     which requires double hulls on new tankers, creates a $1
     billion cleanup trust fund, and increases polluter liability
     and enforcement tools.

o    At the Paris G-7 Summit in 1989, President Bush offered
     proposals that resulted in 1991 in the 80-nation Convention
     on Oil Spill Preparedness and Response.           

o    The President budgeted new funds for the Gulf of Mexico and
     increased funding for the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes
     to improve water quality and to stop coastal degradation.

o    The President secured consent agreements from several states
     to ban ocean dumping of sewage sludge and industrial wastes.
     All ocean sludge dumping has been halted as of June 1992. 
     The Bush Administration also established a pilot tracking
     system to prevent the dumping of medical waste.

o    The U.S. led successful U.N. efforts to halt driftnet
     fishing, a highly destructive fishing technique that results
     in large, wasteful takes of marine mammals, seabirds, and
     other living marine resources.

Providing Clean Water

o    The President has secured increased funding to clean up
     those harbors which have the largest unmet sewage treatment
     needs: Boston, New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle and
     Baltimore.

o    The first, second, and fourth largest penalties for
     violations of the Clean Water Act were secured in 1991,
     reflecting vigorous enforcement initiatives.

o    The President's FY93 budget includes $2.5 billion for
     wastewater treatment grants, a $100 million increase over
     FY92.

o    In 1991, the Administration issued a new regulation to
     reduce lead, copper, and other harmful substances in our
     drinking water, based on a standard that is ten times more
     stringent than the previous standard, actions which will
     give 138 million Americans cleaner drinking water. 

o    In 1991, the Administration issued a strategy to develop
     groundwater protection programs emphasizing adoption of
     environmentally friendly agricultural practices to reduce
     the general risk of groundwater contamination.

o    The Bush Administration launched a major new National Water
     Quality Assessment Program addressing such topics as
     pesticides, excess nutrients, and sediments.

Increasing Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy

o    The U.S. leads efforts to find cost-effective, market-based
     methods for improving energy conservation and efficiency.
     The Bush Administration's promotion of utility integrated
     resource planning and the "Green Lights" program provide
     information and incentives to encourage the use of energy-
     efficient products.

o    President Bush's National Energy Strategy (NES), first
     presented to Congress in the spring of 1991, is a
     comprehensive strategy that includes equal measures of
     increased energy efficiency and production. 

     --   The President's program encourages greater use of
          natural gas through regulatory reform and increased
          research and development.  Natural gas releases fewer
          pollutants than other fossil fuels.


FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                 Page 13

     --   The President has proposed $900 million in next year's
          budget for research and development under the Strategy,
          twice as much funding as when he took office.

     --   The President supports a new generation of safer 
          nuclear power through increased research and
          development of safer designs, licensing reforms, public
          education, and responsible waste management.

o    The President has increased funding 67% for the development
     of renewable energy sources including hydroelectric,
     biofuels, wind, geothermal, solar and waste-to-energy
     facilities.

o    The President supports full funding of the Federal and
     industry cost-shared Clean Coal Technology Demonstration
     Program which demonstrates modern technologies to use our
     abundant coal resources more cleanly and efficiently.

o    President Bush has directed Federal agencies to maximize
     their purchases of cleaner running alternative fuels
     vehicles.  The government has already purchased over 3,000
     such vehicles and plans to acquire 5,000 more in FY93.

o    President Bush has ordered Federal agencies to reduce energy
     use in Federal buildings 20 percent below 1985 levels by
     2000 and reduce gasoline and diesel use 10 percent below
     1991 levels by 1995.

o    The NES encourages state and utility efforts to treat
     investment in energy efficiency as an alternative to new
     power plants and provides tax-free treatment of utility
     discounts on consumers' electricity bills for efficiency
     investments. 

o    The Administration has issued rules for improved efficiency
     standards for energy-consuming home appliances such as
     dishwashers and washing machines.  

o    The Department of Energy has entered into a four-year, $260
     million partnership with the U.S. Advanced Battery
     Consortium, a coalition of U.S. automakers and electric
     utilities, to develop improved batteries that will
     accelerate the commercialization of non-polluting electric
     vehicles.

o    The Administration is working in partnership with U.S.
     industry to develop improved manufacturing processes that
     are more efficient and produce less waste, improving
     productivity and competitiveness.

Waste Reduction, Recycling and Disposal

o    In 1990, the Administration adopted a waste management
     hierarchy that gives priority to source reduction and reuse,
     followed by recycling and composting, incineration with
     energy recovery, and environmentally-sound landfilling.

o    The Bush Administration has made pollution prevention, which
     is preferable to cleanup, one of its basic environmental
     principles. The EPA Office of Pollution Prevention reviews
     all relevant regulatory proposals and requires EPA offices
     to consider pollution prevention measures early in its rule-
     making process.  Pollution prevention incentives have been
     established for land, water, and air pollution.

o    President Bush has sought international implementation of
     the Basel Convention, which outlaws the dumping and
     uncontrolled export of hazardous wastes to developing
     countries.  The United States now has bilateral agreements
     established with all countries receiving U.S. hazardous
     waste to assure that the receiving country will properly
     recycle or dispose of the waste.

o    In 1991 President Bush ordered all Federal agencies to
     implement waste reduction and recycling programs and to
     increase purchases of items made from recycled materials. 
     The White House complex began recycling aluminum cans and
     newspapers in 1990 and added white waste paper in 1991.

o    The Administration's "33/50" project encourages voluntary
     industrial reductions of 17 high-priority toxic wastes -- 33
     percent reduction by 1992 and 50 percent by 1995.  To date,
     over 750 companies and the Departments of Energy and Defense
     have committed to the program and will cut toxic pollutants
     by almost 350 million pounds.

o    The Administration has tripled the rate of toxic waste site
     cleanups since 1989.  Final cleanup is now underway or
     complete at over 500 Superfund sites around the country. 
     Congress has consistently cut the President's requests for
     Superfund cleanups and has yet to provide his original
     (FY90) request of $1.7 billion.

o    The President has worked at the national and international
     levels to eliminate hazardous waste.  Toxic releases to the
     environment have fallen 26 percent since 1988.

Federal Facilities Cleanup and Compliance

o    The Administration has made significant progress in meeting
     the requirements of environmental laws and in cleaning up
     the Nation's defense facilities.  Since 1989, the Department
     of Energy's budget for environmental restoration and
     compliance activities has risen from $1.7 billion to a level
     of $4.3 billion.  Proposed funding in FY93 is $5.3 billion -
     - a 23 percent increase over 1992. 

o    The Administration has established enforceable agreements
     with the EPA and state regulators which contain detailed
     requirements and aggressive schedules for conducting
     specific environmental compliance and cleanup activities.  A
     total of 84 agreements have been established to date and an
     additional 27 are under negotiation.

o    President Bush also has supported an aggressive national
     program within the Department of Energy for the development
     and implementation of innovative waste-management
     technologies.  An integral element of this initiative is the
     establishment of partnerships and consortiums with
     commercial and educational organizations to support
     cooperative research initiatives and information sharing.

o    The United States has made additional progress in the study
     of disposal options for radioactive waste.  In 1991, the
     Department of Energy announced that the Waste Isolation
     Pilot Plant in New Mexico was ready to begin a test phase to
     determine the suitability of the underground facility for
     waste disposal.
  
Encouraging Private Sector Participation  

o    Last year, President Bush selected 25 executives of major
     business, academic, and environmental groups to form the
     President's Commission on Environmental Quality.  The
     Commission's charge is to develop and pursue an
     environmental improvement agenda using private sector
     initiatives that integrate environmental, economic, and
     quality-of-life goals.

o    The Commission has fostered relationships between the
     business and nonprofit communities to collaborate on
     solutions to pressing environmental problems of concern to
     all Americans.  Initiatives include:

     --   Pollution prevention initiatives to reduce waste in the
          workplace and encourage more efficient and cost
          effective manufacturing and production.  

FACT SHEET -- ENVIRONMENT                                 Page 16

     --   A voluntary program to encourage energy efficiency in
          businesses and homes, reducing energy waste and
          increasing consumer savings.

     --   A national program to improve understanding about the
          hazards of lead and thus reduce lead poisoning in young
          children.

     --   Working with the U.S. Environmental Training Institute,
          a public-private sector program developed by the Bush
          Administration to assist professionals from developing
          countries with their environmental protection efforts.

     --   Partnerships to reconcile economic uses of land with
          greater conservation of biodiversity.

o    Today, more EPA regulations are being written with input
     from diverse interests early in the process to reduce the
     likelihood of costly litigation and regulatory delay down
     the road.  But efforts to protect the environment also
     depend on greater voluntary private sector initiatives.

o    President Bush has initiated development of the Technology
     Cooperation Corps with the collaboration and participation
     of representatives of U.S. businesses to share U.S. know-how
     and expertise in environmental management and technology.

Rewarding Environmental Accomplishment

o    Rewarding exemplary environmental achievement is very
     important to President Bush.  Last year he gave the first-
     ever President's Environment and Conservation Challenge
     Awards to nine organizations and Presidential Citations for
     environmental achievement to an additional 23 organizations. 
     All award recipients had found innovative and economical
     solutions to the Nation's environmental challenges.

o    President Bush has also encouraged environmental awareness
     on the part of young people.  Recently, ten Environmental
     Youth Award winners (from grades K-12) were honored for
     their efforts in helping to find solutions to today's and
     tomorrow's environmental challenges.  The winners met with
     the President.
