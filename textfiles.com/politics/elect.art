     The 1992 presidential election sparked considerable commentary among
users of The Free American. Following are just a few excerpts from items

On the Raisa BBS, users have voted for their favorite candidates. There
is no sure winner yet, but it seems we have a front runner.

           TO THOSE WHO SAY, "I'M NO FAN OF POLITICS..."
          ("...I'LL WATCH BASEBALL INSTEAD OF POLITICAL DEBATES.")

                           by Cliff Steward

     An odd position to hold (at least for a long time) is: "I'm no fan of
politics, nosiree. Fools, thieves, and shameless self promoters, that's
what an American in politics is to me."

     On the other hand, let's put aside all consideration of impotence, all
the cynical bitching, and even all thought that we could do better if we
wuz dem...Consider instead the raw humanity, foolishness and all, the hopes
and dreams, self-deceptions and eager-to-please leaps of logic that moments
like the national presidential candidates' debates offer to us all. There
will be so much there, said and unsaid, of life as we have done our best to
make it - so much more than in the diamond of the bases.

     So allow me to urge all you anti-political residents of this here year
of 1992 to tune in Sunday night, not for who wins but for what an intense
90 minutes can show of what we have become, and what we might like to be.
It's a "War and Peace" kind of novel playing against just another baseball
game show. As in "War and Peace," Sunday's debate is not about who wins a
skirmish, or even the entire war -- rather we turn to them both as an
intensification of life and human foibles.

     Thus, to paraphrase old Doc Johnson, "He who tires of politics has
tired of life."
         

                      TWO VIEWS OF ELECTION NIGHT

                    by Chris Graham and Jeff Epstein

     Clinton wins! What a wonderful feeling! I have become so cynical about
how conservative this country is that I didn't do anything for this campaign
except buy a Clinton t-shirt. I was superstitious right to the end - but we
are going to have a Democratic president! Thank God. I really hope everyone
will give him a chance, and I hope he lives up to it. We can't afford
another Jimmy Carter debacle. But right now, there's hope again. Ironically,
it * is * morning in America. Halleluia!
                                        -- Jeff Epstein

     Well, President Bill will be a disaster. I think the Democratic party
has yet to learn what the Russians, Eastern Europeans and East Germans have
learned at a great cost in human lives. Socialism * does * not * work. It
will not work in the U.S. either. Ever. The Senate candidates in California
- Boxer and Feingold - are both 60s rejects who are Socialist and
collectivist to the core.

        A friend who works at the Pentagon tells me he learned from the
        office custodial staff that the day after the election * many *
        trash cans contained the formerly-framed pictures of President
        Bush that had graced the office walls - until the returns came in.

        PRESIDENT-ELECT CLINTON MAKES HIS FIRST VISIT TO WASHINGTON, D.C.
 
                         by Jeff Epstein


     I decided to make my stand at the West Gate Entrance to the White House
at Diplomatic Drive. Several other people had the same idea as me, but at
the last minute, the guard took pity on us and told us the motorcade would
be coming through the East Gate via E Street.

     So I stood on E Street. The car came around, up went my camera -- and
Bill Clinton gave me a thumbs up!

     Actually, I couldn't see him too well behind the glass, but it was him.
So that was cool. I then went around to the north side by the West Wing (the
place the reporters do their stand-ups.) But nothing was happening, so I
left. Apparently, bush and Clinton did go out to the Rose Garden for a
photo-op later.

     Later, I went up to Georgia Avenue, near Howard University, where
Clinton was to take his walk, but I was too far south. Where he actually
walked was so far north it's off the map.

     Tomorrow, I may try to see him at the Hay-Adams Hotel, although the
news reports tonight said the crowds are being kept half a block away. In
light of his walk around Georgia Avenue today, some of these security
regulations seem a little excessive.
