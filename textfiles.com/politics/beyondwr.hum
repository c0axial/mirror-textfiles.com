of thinking and we thus drift toward unparalleled catastrophe."
                                                Albert Einstein, 1946

    The development, deployment and use of nuclear weapons have 
    forever altered our environment.  For the first time, a species 
    has the capability of destroying itself and its life support 
    system.  Our thinking, however, has not yet caught up with that 
    reality.  In order to survive, we must change our mode of 
    thinking.  This change requires knowledge, decision, and action.

I.  KNOWLEDGE

    A.  War is Obsolete

    Throughout recorded history, war has been used to acquire, to 
    defend, to expand, to impose, to preserve.  War has been the 
    ultimate arbiter of differences between nations.  War and the 
    preparation for war have become intrinsic to human culture.  Now 
    we must accept the reality that war has become obsolete.

    * We cannot fight a full-scale nuclear war.  A full-scale nuclear 
    war would destroy civilization as we know it and would threaten 
    life itself.

    * We cannot fight a limited nuclear war.  Detonation of even a 
    small percentage of the world's nuclear arsenals could trigger a 
    "nuclear winter" and could cause the extinction of humanity.  It 
    is also highly probable that a limited nuclear war would escalate 
    to a full-scale nuclear war.

    * We cannot fight a conventional war among the superpowers.  Such 
    a war would likely escalate to a nuclear war.

    * We cannot fight a conventional war among the non-superpowers 
    without potentially involving the superpowers.  The growing 
    interdependence of nations has produced a network of "vital 
    interests" that the superpowers have pledged to defend.  This 
    defense could, in turn, escalate through conventional war to 
    nuclear war.

    Today, because war has become obsolete, we must learn to resolve 
    conflict without violence.



B.  We are One

"Once a photograph of the earth, taken from the outside, is available...
 a new idea as powerful as any in history will let loose."
                                       Sir Fred Hoyle, 1948   














    The view of the earth from space is a symbol of the 
    interconnectedness of all life.  This symbol of oneness is 
    validated by a variety of scientific discoveries of the last 
    century.

    * Physics demonstrates that nothing exists in isolation.  All of 
    matter, from sub-atomic particles to the galaxies in space, is 
    part of an intricate web of relationships in a unified whole.

    * Ecology provides the understanding that all parts of a living 
    system are interconnected and that greater stability results from 
    increased diversity.

    * Biology reveals that, in a totally interrelated system, the 
    principle of survival of the "fittest" is now seen as that 
    species which best contributes to the well-being of the whole 
    system.

    * Psychology explains the projection of the dark side of the 
    personality upon an "enemy."  That knowledge gives us new tools 
    to understand conflict and to improve relationships between 
    individuals and between nations.

    Together these discoveries reveal in a new way the meaning of 
    "One."  We are one interconnected, interdependent life-system, 
    living on one planet.


    C.  The New Mode of Thinking

    The knowledge that war is obsolete and that we are one is the 
    foundation of the new mode of thinking.  Our mode of thinking is 
    what we identify with.  It determines our values, our attitudes, 
    our motivation, and our actions.

    Until recently, we had not experienced the earth as one 
    integrated system.  We had limited experience of other peoples 
    and other cultures.  Therefore, our primary loyalty has been 
    limited to our family, tribe, race, religion, ideology, or 
    nation.  Our identification has been restricted and we have often 
    seen those beyond that identification as enemies.

    In the nuclear age this limited identification threatens all 
    humanity.  We can no longer be preoccupied with enemies.  We can 
    no longer see ourselves as separate.  Modern transportation, 
    communication systems and the discoveries of science have 
    increased tremendously our direct and indirect experience of the 
    world.  We now see that all of life is interdependent, that we 
    share a common destiny, that our individual well-being depends on 
    the well-being of the whole system.  We must now identify with 
    all humanity, all life, the whole earth.  This expanded 
    identification is the new mode of thinking. 

    It may be that we will never eliminate conflict between 
    individuals or between nations.  There will always be different 
    perspectives, different ideas and different approaches to 
    problems.  However, an overriding identification with the whole 
    earth will enable us to resolve conflicts by discovering 
    solutions that benefit all.  Diversity will no longer be a cause 
    of war.  By changing our mode of thinking, diverse points of view 
    will become a source of creative solutions.

    The human species has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to 
    change its mode of thinking.  As we have matured and acquired new 
    knowledge, we have expanded our identification beyond the tribe, 
    clan and the city-state.  As we began to expand our 
    identification beyond race, we abolished the institution of 
    slavery.  Now, by expanding our identification to the whole earth 
    and all humanity, we will build a world beyond war.

"The Age of Nations is past.  The task before us now, if we would not 
 perish, is to shake off our ancient prejudices and build the earth."
                                 Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, 1936

II.  DECISION

    The process of building a world beyond war begins with the 
    acknowledgement that war is obsolete and that we are one.  Change 
    then requires a decision to reject totally the obsolete and to 
    commit totally to build upon the new identification.

    Decision means "to-cut" (-cision) "away from" (de-), to reject 
    forever an option, to close the door to an existing possibility.  
    Without a decision it is impossible to discover the new.  There 
    is always a peril in moving into the unknown.  We cannot preview 
    all that will happen.  We must draw upon our individual and 
    collective experience of making such "leaps" in the past.

    The decision to change our modes of thinking must be made on an 
    individual basis.  Individuals are the basic element of 
    societies.  Without an individual change, societal change cannot 
    occur.  Each of us must decide to adopt the new mode of thinking 
    as the basis of his or her life.

"To compromise in this matter is to decide; to postpone and evade decision 
 is to decide; to hide the matter is to decide...There are a thousand ways 
 of saying no; one way of saying yes; and no way of saying anything else."
                                       Gregory Vlastos, 1934

III.  ACTION

    Societies generate their own vision of what is possible and draw 
    their behavior from that vision.  This nation must renew its 
    commitment to the vision upon which it was founded and build 
    agreement about the implications of that vision in the 
    contemporary world.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident:  that all men are created equal; 
 that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; 
 that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that, to 
 secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving 
 their just powers from the consent of the governed."
                                  Declaration of Independence, 1776

    We have not always lived up to the highest expression of our 
    founding principles.  For example, "all men are created equal" 
    originally meant only white, tax-paying, property-owning males.  
    Clearer understanding of these principles has resulted in 
    creative change.  When enough of us agreed that "all men are
    created equal" meant black and white, we abolished slavery.  When 
    enough of us agreed that it meant women and men, we instituted 
    women's suffrage.  When enough of us agree that it mean more than 
    "separate but equal," we recognized civil rights.

    When new agreements about principles are reached, laws, treaties 
    and policies are developed to implement them.  That is the only 
    sequence of lasting change:  agreement about principle, the law.  
    Law cannot effectively precede agreement.  Agreement must spring 
    from new understanding of principles.  The action through which 
    agreement is built is education.


    Today education must be based upon the knowledge that war is 
    obsolete and that we are one.  We now know that the principle 
    "all men are created equal" applies to every human being on the 
    planet.  We now know that the unalienable right to life, liberty 
    and the pursuit of happiness cannot be secured by war.  We must 
    now work together to build agreement based on that knowledge 
    throughout our society.

    Power comes from individuals who are connected to universal 
    principles and who are working together to build new agreements.  
    The power of the nation has come from involvement of the people 
    in the unfolding of our founding principles.  We have always 
    agreed that such involvement is not the exclusive right of the 
    elite.  Truth is self-evident:  it is available to all.  Power 
    flows not from the top, but from the consent of the governed.  
    Our Great Seal says it clearly: "E Pluribus Unum--Out of Many, 
    One."

    We have become a demonstration of that statement on our Great 
    Seal.  The possibility that resulted from the process of 
    involving people in the pursuit of truth has been unfolding for 
    200 years.  This process has served as a beacon of hope and 
    inspiration to people around the world.  It has drawn the largest 
    diversity of people ever assembled in one nation.  We have 
    gathered the "Many"--the religions, the races, the 
    nationalities--working for the well-being of the "One," the 
    United States of America.

    To fulfill the purpose and vision upon which this nation was 
    founded, we must change our understanding of the principle "Out 
    of Many, One" to include the whole earth and all life.  We must 
    work together to build a world beyond war.

"I know of no safe repository of the ultimate power of society but the 
 people.  And if we think them not enlightened enough, the remedy is not 
 to take the power from them, but to inform them by education."
                                     Thomas Jefferson, 1820
