Are you happy with the current situation America is in today?  Do you have
this little voice, in the back of your head whispering, "Something isn't
right about all of this"?  Are you concerned for your family and your
children?  What will they inherit from us?

                  The American Dream or Economic Slavery?

I have found that most of the people in CyberSpace are somewhat "aware" of
what is really happening to our Nation.  CyberSpace is a wonderful place,
where ideas and information are constantly traveling the boundless reaches,
for every person in it to share and learn.  Some use CyberSpace to play the
"soap opera" game on tele-conference BBSs.  Some use it to download the
latest pornographic .gifs to waste hard drive space and get a one minute
stand with their hand.  Some people are above the rest, they play the
software piracy circuits and play games all day.  Professing in the belief
that software theft is the highest plateau of data communications.

Then we come to the rarest breed of people in CyberSpace.  The ones who are
aware of the importance to the cry, "KEEP THE INFORMATION FREE".  They see
the government trying to put CyberSpace under federal control.  They
realize the repercussions of such an action.  They are the Hackers.  The
ones who have been dubbed as "outlaws, criminals, and vandals".  However,
we all know that the true definition of a Hacker is: A Person who sees
information as the greatest treasure.  Information that should be free to
all who want to learn.  But we know that in reality, information and truth
is kept from us at every turn.

                              The Sixth Column

If information is gold, then we are wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice.
We collect and distribute information that has been hidden from the
citizens of this great Nation.  Information that some people don't want the
public to know about (the best kind, of course).  Some of the information
that we provide is so unbelievable that most people tune it out.  However,
everything is available for you to make up your own mind.

I read an article about a hacker's views on hackers.  In it he stated that
there are few common traits linking hackers together.  He also stated, "The
most significant trait of Hackers is a severe distrust of authority."  As I
see it, that trait is the most important trait anyone could have.  Do you
simply "believe" everything you are told?  I doubt it.

The Sixth Column is based on our Constitutional right, "To Freedom Of
Speech and Expression".  We are not the people who say, "Well..thats just
life," "What can you do?", and "I can't do anything".  In a short amount of
time, we took a concept and turned it into reality to reach more people.
And that is just the beginning.

That's enough of preliminaries.  We will now skim over some interesting
'tid bits of information that most people don't know about.

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The following is just a few example of what we have discovered doing
research into a variety of subjects.  Basically "questioning authority,"
and look at what we have found.

    1. Income Taxes - Its VOLUNTARY!

         a. The Fifth Amendment protects you from being a witness against
            yourself.  The 1040 can be used against you.  Therefore you are
            NOT REQUIRED to file.

         b. You do not have a "taxable income"!  Income is defined in the
            Internal Revenue Code as "a corporate profit".  WAGES are NEVER
            MENTIONED in the IRC.

         c. The IRS cites the law constantly.  The Income Tax laws which
            are based solely on the 16th Amendment.  However, it has been
            proven that the 16th Amendment was NEVER RATIFIED!  It was
            voted on 64-4 against.

         d. Information on these points and more are available.  The Media
            has been proven to be controlled in respect to this issue.  We
            have many files on this subject.  If you don't believe it, just
            read a few texts for yourself.  We guarantee you will be
            shocked.

    2. Driver's Licence & Registration

         a. Its a contract.  Its not mandatory.

         b. The current vehicle code states, "All prior codes are still in
            effect".  They don't tell you in the current edition of the
            codes, but in the older versions you will find that a Driver is
            defined as "A person who uses the highways to haul freight or
            passengers for profit".  (By law, are you a driver?)

    3. Social (In)Security

         a. Indications show that the Social Security System will collapse
            by 2006.  Why?

         b. For every dollar that is taken from your paycheck, the
            government take a loan out on it.  Ten dollars for every dollar
            that you put in.  Think of how much that means over the years
            multiplied by how many people pay into it.

         c. The money that you put in now is not going into a place set
            aside for you when you retire.  It goes directly to people who
            are already retired.  Because of the way they handled the
            system, the gov't is taxing soc. sec. at about 50% and
            increasing the (voluntary) income tax assessments on social
            security earnings.

         d. Information about this swindle and how you can drop out is
            available.

That was just a small portion of the information we have accumulated.  So
far we support information on the following topics.

    1. IRS / TAX / Financial information files

    2. Government Politics and Conspiracy information texts.  Many texts on
       what is happening to our Nation from all over the country.

    3. AIDS - Is it man-made?

    4. The Kennedy Assassination - Many texts on information you'll never
       see in the Media or in history books.

    5. And Much More!


As you read this, you know that President Clinton has officially gotten
tossed aside the Federal Vaseline and bent over America.  More taxes, more
spending and more debt are the continuing factor in the way the government
runs the country.

We are a Nation OF, FOR, AND BY THE PEOPLE.  The Government is supposed to
be subservient to the will of the people.  We were not intended to be
controlled by the government.

That's all for now for our intro.  We hope that you take the opportunity to
inspect our information before you make up your mind on any topic.


Grateful Thanks to the following people:

-Pazuzu, for all the wicked humor and all the wicked truths.

-Irwin Schiff, you paid a high price for telling the truth.  We hope you
know that your information has shown people the truth.

-Thomas Jefferson, be glad you are dead, because if you saw how far this
Nation has sunk, you would have killed yourself.

-To all of The Photon Regulars, we are still out there.

-To all software pirates, thanks for reminding me that there are more
important things in life than getting high score.



Yours for Freedom,

The Sixth Column
