DISCUSSION OF INCORPORATION, CHARTER & BY-LAWS
 
     In light of Mitch Kapor's encouraging news concerning the 
future of EFF chapters, Ed Cavazos moved to proceed with with 
incorporation as soon as possible.  The motion was seconded by John 
Quarterman, and unamnimously approved. The final blanks on the 
Articles (version 1.01) were filled in with the proper names and 
addresses.  The official name of the organization will be: 
"EFF-Austin."  The current by-laws (version 1.00) will be reviewed by 
Ed Cavazos and revised/updated to reflect any recent Board 
decisions.  The by-laws shall refer to the organization as "The 
Electronic Frontier Foundation, Austin Chapter." They will be 
presented at the next meeting for approval by the board and formal 
adoption.  Incorporation papers should be filed the week of July 
20-27.
 
CYBERTEX
 
    It was decided that the board is still very interested in 
the Cybertex idea, though no formal proposal has been received in 
response to a request for Cybertex proposals distributed last 
month. There has been some interest expressed by various 
individuals, and discussions with them should continue. 
 
MAILING LISTS/NEWGROUPS
 
        New names for the mailing lists were discussed.  In order 
to clarify the mailing list names for those who might be confused 
by them, new names (which will work as well as the old were) were 
decided upon.  The "eff-a@tic.com" mailing list, which is the 
general discussion and announcement list for EFF-Austin, has been 
renamed to "eff-austin@tic.com".  "Eff-abod@tic.com" which was the 
mailing list for the board of directors and those working closely 
with them has also been renamed to "Eff-Austin-Directors@tic.com." 
The previous names of the mailing lists will still 
work.                                      
       Prentiss Riddle will be offered the job of newsgroup 
moderator. Prentiss volunteered to take on this task, and seems to 
be dedicated and qualified.
 
OFFICERS/DIRECTORS
 
        Ed Cavazos was elected to serve as Vice President, the 
poisition left vacant when Jon Lebkowsky left the board. The Board 
will consider new board members in the coming weeks.
 
UPCOMING MEETINGS/EVENTS
 
         The previously discussed "Sysop Issues" meeting will be 
held at a date in late July.  A location is still needed, but an 
effort to find a suitable meeting place soon will be undertaken.  
Bruce Sterling will be contacting law enforcement officials about 
possibly attending/participating in the meeting.
        Dave Smith will organize the August Cyberdawg, preferrably 
on a weekend to facilitate some out of town attendance.
        John Quarterman will organize and conduct the September 
29th meeting on the Matrix and accessing the net, as was previously 
decided.
        Susan Cisco will be organizing the October meeting, 
which will be a book release/discussion of Hacker Crackdown by 
Bruce Sterling.  The date for this meeting will be picked in 
September.              
 
MISCELLANEOUS OTHER NOTES
 
        In late 1992 or early 1993, The Review of Litigation will 
publish a law review article by Ed Cavazos on Sysop Liability for 
defamation posted on BBS's.  The article argues for limited 
liability based on the inherent right of reply which exists in the 
BBS medium.
        Steve Jackson was unable to be at the meeting as he was 
attending DoverCon in Dover, NH.  
 
        
- --- The meeting was adjourned at 9:40. 
    The next meeting will take place on August 11, 1992.
