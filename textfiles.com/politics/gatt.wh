               PRESIDENT BUSH ON THE URUGUAY ROUND
                    NEGOTIATIONS OF THE GATT
                                
                                
                                
     "The Uruguay Round offers a vital opportunity to eliminate
     barriers to our goods, investment, services, and ideas."

                              President George Bush
                              May 1, 1991

Summary

o    Under President Bush's leadership, the United States is
     spearheading efforts to complete the Uruguay Round of
     multilateral trade negotiations, the most ambitious round in
     the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
     (GATT).  The 108 nation members of GATT represent over 90
     percent of world trade.  The objective of the Uruguay Round
     negotiations is to strengthen and expand the global trading
     system by reducing trade barriers.

o    The Bush Administration's goals in the Round include sharply
     reducing trade barriers worldwide; extending GATT rules to
     services, investment, and intellectual property; and curbing
     trade subsidies that undercut American farm and industrial
     exports, while not reducing the effectiveness of U.S. laws
     against unfair trade.

o    President Bush is committed to obtaining a GATT agreement
     that will benefit American workers, farmers, and consumers;
     he will not accept an inadequate agreement just for the sake
     of an agreement.


A Sound GATT Agreement Would Benefit the U.S. Economy

o    An open multilateral trading system is the best guarantee
     that U.S. export opportunities will continue to expand into
     the next century.  The Uruguay Round is the most important
     initiative to expand these opportunities.  A successful
     Uruguay Round would provide substantial benefits to the U.S.
     economy, including:


                             -more-
                         GATT -- page 2
                                
                                
     --   Lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to manufactured
          products and other goods, which would substantially
          boost U.S. exports and could increase U.S. output by
          over $1 trillion over the next ten years;

     --   Rules to protect the intellectual property of U.S.
          entrepreneurs to reduce the $60 billion lost each year
          through theft and counterfeiting;

     --   New markets for U.S. services firms, which export over
          $140 billion annually and generate 90 percent of new
          U.S. jobs;

     --   Fair competition and open markets in agriculture to
          create new opportunities for American farmers, who lead
          the world with more than $40 billion in annual exports;
     --   Full participation of developing countries in the
          global trading system, which could increase U.S.
          exports by $200 billion between now and the year 2000;
          and

     --   Effective rules on dispute settlement, anti-dumping,
          subsidies, and import safeguards, to expand U.S. access
          to foreign markets and ensure fair trade in the U.S.
          market.

Agriculture

o    One of President Bush's key objectives is to obtain a GATT
     agreement that contains major agricultural policy reforms,
     including commitments by GATT member nations to reduce trade-
     distorting internal support to farmers, open markets to
     imports, and cut export subsidies.

o    Agricultural reforms in the Uruguay Round would mark an
     historic departure from the costly protectionist measures
     that have flourished in that sector, largely outside GATT
     disciplines.  These reforms would have significant benefits
     for farmers, taxpayers, and consumers in the United States
     and the rest of the world.

o    These reforms have been opposed by the European Community,
     which refuses to reduce subsidies that give EC farmers an
     unfair advantage in the world market.  President Bush,
     supported by other GATT members, has demanded that any final
     GATT agreement include a commitment by all parties including
     the EC to drastically reduce these subsidies and to require
     their farmers to compete in the world market.

                             -more-
                         GATT -- page 3
                                

Services

o    President Bush has insisted that global trade rules for
     services be established to expand access to global markets
     for U.S. services providers.  President Bush is confident
     that U.S. services, such as banking, insurance,
     telecommunications, motion pictures, tourism, and
     construction, can out-compete their foreign counterparts if
     only they are allowed to compete on a level playing field.

     --   The United States already leads the world with $140
          billion in services exports annually.

Intellectual PropertyIntellectual Property Rules

o    Patented, copyrighted, and trademarked products are a
     growing source of foreign earnings to the U.S. economy.
     President Bush has pressed for a GATT agreement that will
     afford the highest level of protection to copyrights,
     patents, and other forms of intellectual property held by
     U.S. firms.  The President also has insisted that the
     agreement must include strong sanctions for those countries
     that condone the piracy, infringement or violation of these
     rights.

o    The President's efforts to protect American know-how have
     already paid off.  For example, in the most recent draft of
     the proposed agreement, computer software would be protected
     as literary work, the highest form of copyright protection
     allowed.

Textile and Apparel
Textile and Apparel

o    The current draft GATT agreement calls for removal of the
     quota system established by the 1974 Multi-Fiber Arrangement
     (MFA).  One of President Bush's main objectives in the GATT
     negotiations has been to ensure that any such quota removal
     be conducted on a smooth and gradual basis in order to
     minimize the disruption to the U.S. textile and apparel
     industry.

o    The President's call for a sensible, responsible phaseout of
     the quotas has prevailed.  The proposed draft agreement
     calls for a gradual phaseout of the MFA, which will allow
     the U.S. textile industry time to adjust to import
     competition and avoid severe disruption, appropriate
     safeguard procedures, improved procedures to deal with
     circumvention of quotas and important market-opening
     measures for U.S. textile and apparel exporters.
