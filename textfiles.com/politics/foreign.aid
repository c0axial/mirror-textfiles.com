               Look  at  this  strange  picture  of a grown man with a
          white beard.  He's wearing an odd looking suit consisting of
          blue and  white striped pants and old styled cutaway jacket.
          He's wearing high hat with stars on it.   Why,  it's our old
          buddy, Uncle Sam.
               He's grinning from ear to ear and holding a heavy money
          sack in one hand.  From the top of the globe, he is throwing
          our money  all over the earth.  He kinda looks like a farmer
          feeding the chickens.
               Look at all the leaders of the nations with their hands
          outstretched.    They're  screaming  at him telling him they
          will be happy to be his friend.  No wonder he's grinning.   
               Foreign Aid  --  doesn't it have a pleasant ring to it?
          Try it again . . . FOREIGN AID.  Such pretty sounding words.
          A real  warm phrase  . . . Allows us to buy friends all over
          the world.  It makes no difference to us whether the country
          is a  communist block  nation or  if they support the United
          States.  No . . . We simply send the grant after our private
          discussions and determination. 
               It doesn't make any difference if the foreign officials
          to whom we give the money use it  for themselves.   There is
          an outside chance they might use it for the benefit of their
          countries.  Look at Marcos as an example.  You  don't really
          think he  would take  American foreign  aid payments and buy
          expensive properties in the United States,  do you?   No, he
          wouldn't have done anything like that.  
               The American  people are  now conditioned to accept the
          foreign aid budget as a legalized  expenditure.   No one any
          longer questions  the government.  Not even our media raises
          any question marks.  And it doesn't matter who we give these
          monies to  because Americans don't understand foreign policy
          at all.  It's to our advantage if  we keep  them ignorant on
          these issues. 
               I don't  want to  be called ignorant any longer.  Let's
          question their authority to  dole  out  our  money  from the
          Treasury.   We hear  all this talk about the federal deficit
          and being a debtor nation for the first time in our history.
          It's time  we began our education.  The admitted foreign aid
          package last year allocated some $15.7 billion.   Here's how
          it would  look if  you wrote the figures in your check book,
          that's $15,700,000,000!  No question that  puts a  big chunk
          into the deficits column!
               They  throw  these  billion  dollar  figures  around as
          though they were talking about a 10 dollar  bill.  Let's see 
          what a  billion is.   Actually, a  billion  seconds  ago  we 
          didn't even have an atomic weapon.   That's a billion!   And 
          now we are hearing the word trillion.  One trillion  minutes 
          ago should take us back to the days of the dinosaurs!
               Let's begin our search and see if we  can find  a shred
          of legality for these monstrous expenditures from our public
          treasury.
               First, we'll look through  the Constitution.   Is there
          any permission to give it to any country whatever story they
          give us to justify the expense?  
               One instance of the  word 'foreign'  in Article  I (the
          law making bodies) appears in Section 8.  These concern only
          the value of foreign  money in  relationship to  our own and
          the regulation of commerce with foreign nations.
               Foreign shows  up again  in Section  9 of Article I but
          only about any person holding an  office of  trust under the
          United States.  He/she shall not receive any present, office
          or title from a foreign state.
               Nothing so far  to  show  there  is  any  permission to
          spread joy  around the  world via our money.  To refresh our
          minds, it is the House of  Representatives which  is respon-
          sible to introduce any bill to expend money.  (Art 1, Sec 7,
          cl 1)   Yet  our  investigation  of  the  entire legislative
          branch shows no consent from us to send one thin dime to any
          other country.  Not  even  an  ersatz  dime  they  force the
          people to use today.  
               Before we  chastise the legislative branch for throwing
          American  money  helter-skelter  around  the  world, perhaps
          there  is  authority  in  one  of  the other sections of the
          Constitution.
               Article II concerns the executive branch  so let's take
          a look-see.
               The only  thing which  shows up which remotely suggests
          any international involvement are joint duties the executive
          shares  with  the  Senate.    The first is the power to make
          treaties with  the advice  and consent  of the  Senate.  The
          second duty is to appoint ambassadors. (Art II, Sec 2, cl 2)
               And, in section 3, it is the duty  of the  executive to
          receive ambassadors and other public ministers.
               Sorry, nothing  in Article  II to show any legality for
          foreign aid.  Why do we  keep hearing  the President talking
          about foreign  aid?  I'm certain I read he often argues with
          Congress about money for some foreign country.
               Checking the next articles  in our  constitution, we do
          find ambassadors mentioned under the judicial article (III).
          Surely judges have no  authority  to  expend  public monies.
          All Article III says is the Supreme Court will have original
          jurisdiction in all cases affecting ambassadors.
               Art IV, Sect 3, cl 2 might be something we  are looking
          for .  . ."Congress  shall have power to dispose of and make
          all needful rules and  regulations respecting  the territory
          or other property belonging to the United States."
               Could it  be possible  our Congress considers all those
          countries as our territories?  Noo o o o o ... A quick check
          of the  amendments shows  nothing at all concerning the word
          foreign or foreign aid.
               Do  you  think  it  might  be   conceivable  they  have
          purposely kept us ignorant about foreign policy?  Maybe they
          have a different copy  of  the  Constitution  than  we have?
          Surely,  there  must  be  authorization  somewhere  for  our
          elected  'representatives'  to  approve  an  expenditure  of
          
          billions!
               All Senators,  Representatives, ALL executive and judi-
          cial officers take an oath to support our  Constitution.  Is
          it likely  they are  all violating  their oaths and breaking
          the law?  One day, those who have said "So help me, God" and
          in  the  same  breath  have  denied  that  oath will have to
          explain that to someone.  
               A possible answer to  these  questions  came innocently
          from  the  pen  of  one  of  our  freshman  Congressmen.  In
          personal correspondence, he said when an issue on which they
          expect  to  vote  concerns  constitutional issues they don't
          take the initiative to  check  our  Constitution.   Instead,
          they refer the issue to a committee with an impressive name,
          the  Committee  on  Constitutional   rights.     Isn't  that
          outstanding?
               If that  august body doesn't say it's unconstitutional,
          the bill will sail through the Congress.  How does that grab
          you?   We demand  they take  an oath to support the document
          and they don't even know what it says.  Nor do they make the
          effort  to  find  out  what  it  says!  And they feel we are
          ignorant.
               We must be mistaken.  Certainly they wouldn't break the
          law?   They keep  telling us that ignorance of the law is no
          excuse . . . what do  you suppose  is their  excuse for this
          ignorance?
               A  look  through  The  Federalist  Papers  is in order.
          Perhaps there is something in the old writings  to point out
          where they have permission to throw our money away.
               James Madison  points out  in paper No. 42  ". . powers
          lodged in the  central  government  consist  of  those which
          regulate the  intercourse with  foreign nations,  to wit: to
          make treaties; to send and receive ambassadors, other public
          ministers, and  consuls; to  define and  punish piracies and
          felonies committed  on the  high seas,  and offenses against
          the law of nations; to regulate foreign commerce, . . ."
               (All  references  to  'paper  no.' means The Federalist
          Papers.) 
               Well, so far we have found  where the  government is to
          regulate foreign  commerce.   Yet not  a word about throwing
          our money at them.  Let's keep looking.
               John Jay in paper  No. 64,  speaks of  the integrity of
          the Senate  and the  President to make treaties.  He rambles
          on a bit  but  says  nothing  about  any  permission  in the
          Constitution  to  give,  grant,  donate or lend money to any
          foreign country.
               In paper No. 53,  James Madison  states:   "A branch of
          knowledge  which  belongs  to  the acquirements of a federal
          representative and which has not been  mentioned is  that of
          foreign affairs.   In  regulating our own commerce, he ought
          to be not only  acquainted  with  the  treaties  between the
          United States  and other  nations, but also with the commer-
          cial policy and laws of other nations."
               The Founding Fathers NEVER  considered they  could take
          our money  from public  funds and give it to a foreign power
          
          no matter how puny.
               We know the House  of  Representatives  and  the Senate
          have "Foreign  Relations Committees."  We hear enough in the
          media from individual members when they want to interfere in
          the internal  affairs of  another country.  This is not only
          immoral, it's also without  authority  in  our Constitution.
          And they have much to say about foreign aid.
               Another point  we should  consider .  . . it sure gives
          these clucks a reason to hop  on an  aircraft for  a foreign
          junket (vacation) at out expense, doesn't it?
               If  these  "foreign  affair"  committees were concerned
          with foreign trade and treaties it would be  in keeping with
          the  intent  of  the  powers which were bestowed.  Hypocrisy
          abounds in Washington.  Must be a special  meal in congress-
          ional dining halls!
               Our  former  ambassador  to the UN, Jeanne Kirkpatrick,
          wrote  an  article  which  appeared  in  the  national press
          entitled "The  Foreign Aid Puzzle."  She makes the following
          observation:  "Obviously, foreign  assistance is  one of the
          instruments of  foreign policy  that can  be used along with
          diplomacy, information, and military  strength to accomplish
          our nations purposes and protect our national interests."
               Is that  statement designed  to make  us feel stupid or
          does it show their ignorance of our supreme  law?   Isn't it
          unique  whenever  they  want  to  justify  something, we are
          protecting  our national interests?   This the  muttering of 
          idiots and pure gobbledegook.
               Our national  interest (which  should be their national
          interest also) is the  preservation of  our Constitution and
          the Republic.
               How can  they justify protecting our national interests
          when they  propose  to  give  $25  million  to  help Marxist
          Mozambique?    Or  $25  million  for  Zimbabwe  which  is  a
          one-party state that  arrests  and  tortures  its opponents?
          Zimbabwe  consistently  opposes  US  foreign  policy.   It's
          obvious what  the result  was concerning  our foreign policy
          towards Saddam.  One might ask, just what is our governments
          conception of our national interest?
               Cow paddies.   The  great  American  scam  is  still in
          operation.
               This idea of foreign aid really began in earnest during
          the  reign  of  Franklin  Roosevelt.    They  called  it the
          "Lend-Lease Program."   Can you please define the term lend-
          lease?  What in blazes does it mean?  Was it intended  to be
          conditioning for  future foreign  aid shenanigans?  And this
          gobbledegook continues unabated!
               The Lend-Lease Act was  passed  March  11,  1941.   "In
          President Roosevelt's  words, this act made the republic the
          arsenal for world democracy."   Tough  to  find  a statement
          that sounds  more stupid.  It does point to the conditioning
          of the American people to accept the word democracy.
               George Washington  in his  farewell address recommended
          we observe  good faith and justice toward all nations.  Also
          we should cultivate peace and harmony  with all.   Does this
          
          unlawful expenditure  of our money lean toward those sugges-
          tions?  How about the meddling in the internal affairs  of a
          foreign nation?  Hardly!   
               He also strongly urged the United States to steer clear
          of permanent alliances  with  the  foreign  world.   Another
          admonition ignored.
               He spoke  eloquently about our republic and its future.
          It  requires  repeating  because  of  the  operation  of our
          government today . . .
               "To  the  efficacy  and  permanency  of  your  union  a
          government  for  the  whole  is  indispensable  .  .  . This
          Government,  the  offspring  of our own choice, uninfluenced
          and  unawed,  adopted  upon  full  investigation  and mature
          deliberation,  completely  free  in  its  principles, in the
          distribution of its powers,  uniting  security  with energy,
          and  containing  within  itself  a  provision  for  its  own
          amendment, has a just  claim  to  your  confidence  and your
          support.    Respect  for  its authority, compliance with its
          laws, acquiescence in its  measures, are  duties enjoined by
          the fundamental  maxims of  true liberty.   The basis of our
          political systems  is the  right of  the people  to make and
          alter their  constitutions of government.  But the constitu-
          tion which at any  time exists  till changed  by an explicit
          and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory
          upon all.  The very idea of the power and  the right  of the
          people to establish government presupposes the duty of every
          individual to obey the established government."  (Messages &
          Papers of the Presidents, J. D. Richardson, 1898.) 
               It  is  the  responsibility  of  everyone  to  obey the
          established government.   It  doesn't exempt  those who work
          for  government.    Washington  pointed out the constitution
          exists till changed by an EXPLICIT and AUTHENTIC act.  Until
          then it is a sacred obligation on all Americans.
               The  Constitution  cannot  be  changed unless you and I
          agree to the change.  The  amendment process  (Art V)  is in
          place  and  they  must  follow  it before ANY process of our
          government can be modified.
               The Tenth  Amendment,  the  last  one  in  the  Bill of
          Rights, forbids  the federal  government from  taking on ANY
          power which we did  not specifically  delegate.   No ifs, no
          ands, no buts! 
                Each reader  should write his Senators and Representa-
          tives and ask where they find authority to  dispense foreign
          aid.    Point  out  to  them  voting  for  foreign  aid is a
          violation of their oaths to support the Constitution.  It is
          the Supreme  Law of the Land.  The violation of the trust we
          gave to them when we  elected  them  to  office  is official
          misconduct.    We  MUST  remove  them from office as soon as
          possible.  This comes  under  the  definition  of malconduct
          which Hamilton  spoke of  in paper  No. 79  which makes them
          subject to impeachment.
               To quote Alexander Hamilton  in  The  Federalist Papers
          No.  78:    "There  is  no position which depends on clearer
          principles than that every  act  of  a  delegated authority,
          
          contrary to  the tenor  of the  commission under which it is
          exercised, is void.  No legislative act, therefore, contrary
          to the  Constitution can be valid.  To deny this would be to
          affirm that the deputy is greater  than his  principle; that
          the servant  is above his master; that the representative of
          the people are superior to the  people themselves;  that men
          acting by virtue of powers may do not only what their powers
          do not authorize, but what they forbid."
               There has  been  much  talk  lately  about  the foreign
          policy of  the president.   It has become the prerogative of
          the president to conduct foreign affairs.  In  reality it is
          the designated  job of the president in cooperation with the
          Senate since it is  their joint  function to  appoint ambas-
          sadors. 
               The president  is authorized to receive ambassadors yet
          as pointed out in the Federalist Papers, this requirement is
          more a  matter of  dignity than  of authority.   The framers
          felt that it would  be easier  for the  president to perform
          this function than to call the entire Congress into session.
               The Framers  of our  Constitution were  so certain that
          the Congress would have nothing to do that they included the
          requirement in Art I, Sect  4,  cl  2:  "The  Congress shall
          assemble at  least once  in every  year. .  "   This was the
          reason they felt that it would  be  a  problem  to  call the
          entire Congress into session to receive ambassadors.
               Today we  can actually  feel safer when they are not in
          session passing some unconstitutional law to  take away more
          of our rights and liberties or raising taxes! 
               Do  you  really  feel  that these people do not realize
          that they have no authority in the Constitution  to dole out
          these huge  sums?    It  is possible  I suppose,  yet on the
          other hand, more than likely that's  not probable!   They do
          know and don't give a damn if we do find out!
               Just another  one of  those practices  that has gone on
          for a long, long  time.   Since they  feel it  buys friends,
          let's  continue  it.    The American people don't understand
          foreign affairs and foreign aid anyway.
               To see how foolish  this idea  of giving  the executive
          the  power  to  commit  troops  to a foreign country without
          Congress declaring war as  required in  the Constitution, we
          don't  have  to  look  far!    How about Vietnam, Lebanon or
          Granada or this fiasco with Saddam? 
               Care to total the number of our young men that  died in
          these illegal  uses of  power?  It doesn't take much courage
          for an old  man  to  send  a  young  man  into  battle.   If
          constitutional requirements  had been followed, much of this
          wouldn't have happened! 
               There is no argument that the president is the command-
          er-in-chief of  the military forces.  However, ONLY when the
          Congress has declared  war,  not  when  they  have delegated
          their authority to the executive branch. 
               It is  not suggested any where in the Constitution that
          the president can commit troops!
               George Washington suggested strongly that America never
          
          become permanently  allied with any foreign nation.  Another
          point he brought out firmly was that we should "observe good
          faith and justice toward all nations." 
               Has this  advice been  followed?  How about our present
          attitude toward  South Africa,  China, Iran,  Libya or Iraq?
          What  business  is  it  of  our government what the internal
          policy these nations follow?  Are any sanctions,  implied or
          real, an illegal and immoral use of power? 
               Is this  "good faith  and justice" toward South Africa?
          The same question could  be applied  toward Rhodesia.   That
          country  is  solidly  in  the  communist  camp  now and this
          happened because of our government meddling  in the internal
          affairs of  that country.   By  what right?   Simply because
          they say it is in our interests?   Special  money   has  now
          been allotted to the CIA to 'get rid of Saddam Hussein'.  He
          went into Kuwait . . . what business  is that  of ours?   Is
          this blood  money?   Find one iota of right in our Constitu-
          tion to say we can assassinate a leader  of another country.
          These people  have gone mad.  It this what Bush wants in his
          'New World Order'?
               Now we have a Secretary of State who  advocates the use
          of the  military in attacks on "terrorist bases" even before
          they have  committed any  acts of  terrorism.   It would not
          matter,  according  to  him,  if innocent civilians would be
          killed or injured in the 'pre-emptive' attacks. 
               It's hard to believe  that a  high ranking  official of
          the  executive  branch  could  even suggest such a barbarous
          act.  Even the  Secretary of  State has  to take  an oath to
          uphold  the  Constitution.    So  where  does he suggest the
          authority for such acts are found?  Can you find any? 
               There  seems  to  be  genuine  concern   for  terrorist
          activities.   Much of  what is going on today is a result of
          past actions of our government. 
                There is no doubt  that some  situations are dangerous
          yet  to  ignore  constitutional authority and limitations is
          also dangerous! 
               Look at their concern about the  terrorists .  . . They
          have  built  all  sorts  of  barriers in front of government
          buildings around the world.   More  of  our  money  at work.
          Must protect our 'leaders' they say.  No one has forced them
          to work  for  the  government.    If  they  feel  it  is too
          dangerous, go back home and go to work!  We won't miss them.
               All  this  talk  about  the  terrorists  and  terrorist
          activity is strangely reminiscent of Boston in 1774 when the
          British called  the people who were causing problems 'incen-
          diaries.'  They were inciting trouble hence the  name incen-
          diaries.  The British reacted with 'pre-emptive' strikes and
          look at the result of that!  Their  pre-emptive strikes were
          without authority also!
               Do We The People create deficits?  Of course not.
               IT'S YOUR MONEY!
               Any wonder  why they  revised the  tax laws to increase
          their revenues?  Now  the talk  is to  raise taxes  again in
          spite of the talk about tax cuts.  WAKE UP!
