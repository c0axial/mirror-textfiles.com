                            ABBIE HOFFMAN

                              1937-1989

Abbie Hoffman, founder of the Youth International Party, (The Yippies)
was found dead in bed late last night.  Pending an autopsy, it appears
                      he died of natural causes.

Abbie was perhaps the archetype of a "Sixties Radical" - a member of
the CHICAGO SEVEN, went underground after being convicted of "selling
cocaine" (believed by many to have been framed) and after plastic
surgery to alter his appearance, became an environmental activist in
upstate New York.  He surfaced and served a reduced sentence, and had
been lecturing and writing for the last few years.

His work (notably a book titled STEAL THIS BOOK) should be required
reading for every 14-year-old.

           My world just got a little darker.
