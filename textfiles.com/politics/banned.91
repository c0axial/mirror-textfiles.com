Banned Computer Material 1992

Inspired by Banned Book Week '92, this is a list of computer material
that was banned or challenged in academia in 1992. Iowa State
University has the dubious distinction of being listed most often
(three times).

The list proper starts after a list of the academic institutions where
bans or challenges have occurred. The list proper is followed by
instructions on how to get more information about specific incidents
and then by instructions on how to get general information about
computers and academic freedom.

Please send reports, corrections, and updates to either
caf-talk@eff.org (a public mailing list) or kadie@eff.org (private).

Most on-line discussion of sex at *Iowa State University*
     Iowa State University restricts access to these newsgroups. The
     rational for the restriction is Iowa's Obscenity law. That law,

     restrictions were started rec.arts.erotica has been added to the
     restricted list, while discussion of drugs and drug policy were
     removed.

========= How to get more information about an incident =========

Following each item in the list above is one or more references.
For example:
          news/cafv02n11:<9202161945.AA24863@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>
          news/cafv01n10
          policies/virginia.pen.edu
          cases/wlu.ca
          batch/oct_06_1991

In the first example, "news/cafv02n11" is the name of a file and
"<9202161945.AA24863@bsu-cs.bsu.edu>" is a message-id within the file.
The other example references consist of just file names. If a
reference includes a message-id, retrieved the named file first, then
edit it and do a text search for that message-id.

The files are available by anonymous ftp (the preferred method) and by
email. To get the files via ftp, do an anonymous ftp to ftp.eff.org
(192.88.144.4), and  "get" the files.

For example:

  get pub/academic/news/cafv02n11
  get pub/academic/news/cafv01n10
  get pub/academic/policies/virginia.pen.edu
  get pub/academic/cases/wlu.ca
  get pub/academic/batch/oct_06_1991

To get the files by email, send email to archive-server@eff.org.
For the files in the example, the email should contain the lines:

send acad-freedom/news cafv02n11
send acad-freedom/news cafv01n10
send acad-freedom/policies virginia.pen.edu
send acad-freedom/cases wlu.ca

and networks? How are these principles actually being applied? How can
the principles of academic freedom as applied to computers and

law/uwm-post-v-u-of-wisconsin
=================
The full text of UWM POST v. U. of Wisconsin. This recent district
court ruling goes into detail about the difference between protected
offensive expression and illegal harassment. It even mentions email.

It concludes: "The founding fathers of this nation produced a
remarkable document in the Constitution but it was ratified only with
the promise of the Bill of Rights.  The First Amendment is central to
our concept of freedom.  The God-given "unalienable rights" that the
infant nation rallied to in the Declaration of Independence can be
preserved only if their application is rigorously analyzed.

The problems of bigotry and discrimination sought to be addressed here
are real and truly corrosive of the educational environment.  But
freedom of speech is almost absolute in our land and the only
restriction the fighting words doctrine can abide is that based on the
fear of violent reaction.  Content-based prohibitions such as that in
the UW Rule, however well intended, simply cannot survive the
screening which our Constitution demands."
