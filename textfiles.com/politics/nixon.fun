RICHARD MILHOUS NIXON
RESIGNATION
THURSDAY, AUGUST 8, 1974

Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my
duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office
to which you elected me.

In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer
have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that
effort....

I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal
agony it would have involved....

I have never been a quitter.  To leave office before my term is completed is
opposed to every instinct in my body.  But as President I must put the
interests of America first.  America needs a full-time President and a
full-time Congress....

To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would
almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and Congress
in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad
and prosperity without inflation at home.

Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
