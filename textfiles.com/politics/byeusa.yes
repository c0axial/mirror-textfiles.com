
                     BLUEPRINT FOR A TAKEOVER

Back in 1944 a great Congressman (Samuel Pettengill) warned that communism 
wanted America to spend itself into bankruptcy and was striving in every 
way to get Americans to become totally dependent on a centralized government.
He gave to his fellow members of the House of Representatives the 12 points 
of the Socialist Manifesto for the economic destruction of free governments. 
We need, desperately, to review his words. In order to prepare a nation for 
socialism or communism he said:
"The people must be made to feel their utter helplessness and their inability
to solve their own problems. While in this state of mind, there is held up 
before them a benign and all-wise leader to whom they must look for the cure 
for all thir ills. This state of mind is most readily developed in a time of 
ecomonic stress or national diaster.

"The principle of local self-government must be wiped out, so that this 
leader or group in  control can have all political power readily at hand.

"The centralized government, while appearing in form to represent the people,
must dutifully register the will of the leader or group in control .

"Constitutuional guarantees must be swept aside. This is accomplished in part
by ridiculing them as outmoded and as obstructions to progress.

"Public faith in the legal profession and respect for the courts must be 
undermined..

"The law-making body must be intimidated and from time to time rebuked, so 
as to prevent the development of public confidence therin.

"Economically, the people must be kept ground down by high taxes, which, 
under one pretext or another, they are called upon to pay. This, they are 
brought to a common level and all income above a  meager living is taken 
from them. In this manner,ecomomic independence is kept to a minimin and 
the citizen is forced to rely more amd more upon the government that 
controls him. Capital and credits is this completely within the control 
of the government.

"A great public debt must be built up so that citizens can never escape 
its burdens. This makes govenment the virtual receiver for the entire nation.

"A general distrust of private business and industry must be kept alive, 
so that the public may not begin to rely upon its own resources.

"Government bureaus are set up to control practically every phase of the 
citizen's life. These bureaus issue directives without number, but all 
under the authority of the leader to whom they are immediately responsible.
It is a government of men, and not of laws.

"The education of the youth of the nation is taken under control to the end 
that all may, at an early age, be incoculated with a spirit of submission to 
the system and of reverence for the benevolennt leader.

"To supplement and fortify all the foreging, there is kept flowing a steady 
stream of governmental propaganda designed to extol all that bow the knee, 
and to vilify those who dare to raise a voice of dissent."

These are the twelve points in the blueprint of the communists to take over 
this nation via economic manipulation as prsented by Samuel Pettengill. 
Stop and go back over them and ask yourself how near to total completion and 
fulfullmenmt America is at this present moment to every one of them.

Remember Lenin said in 1921 . . .  "They will spend themselves into 
bankruptcy  . . .  they will commit national suicide." Stalin said, "We 
won't have to fire a single shot . . . they will fall, like overripe fruit,
into our hands."

But finally, let us remember the words of our own Thomas Jefferson, author 
of the Declaration of Independence, third President and one of the wisest of
our Founding Fathers. He said, "If we let Washington tell us what to sow and 
when to reap, the nation shall soom want for bread."

Karl Marx said, "Spend Them To Death." Americans will master plan their own
destruction by taxing and spending themselves to death and will fall to us 
like over-ripe apples!
