  Guerilla:(Websters dictionary) A member of a band of irregular troops taking
part in independant warfare.

  Today many people turn away from guerilla warfare,blaming most of the worlds
problems on it.  Terrorism, hijacking, and petty wars are all associated with
this unique form of war tactics,but here we have arrangeds the stereotyping of
the well trained militia to suit our needs...and yours.  We have discovered that
the same tactics and techniques apply to great fun, with some unique twists.
Here we have arranged conventional Guerilla techniques to suit your limited
supplies and economy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ you will need...

(Camouflage)
	     dark clothing (camies if you wish)
	     dark soft soled shoes (with good traction)
	     a dark canvas or denim bag (or any prefibly dark sturdy bag)
	     a mask (optional)
	    a pair of gloves (this is nessacary for some of the feats)

(Utensils)
	     strong rope (about 10-15 feet)
	     fishing line (10 feet or so;5-10 pound test is best)
	     wire cutters and/or pliers (both would be nice)
	     combination or padlock locks (as many as you want)
	     some old newspapers (in very good shape)
	     hair spray or most any aerosal
	     camera with flash
	     film
	     flashlight
	     matches
	     lighter
	     a few cigarettes
	     a role of movie type tickets
	    posterboard and pictures of your favorite cars
	    gas (bottles of this are easiest to carry)
	    small can of vaseline (not for any bad habits!)
	   tacks,jack,or crushed glass (preferalby a box of taxs)
	    food cloring
	     water
	     crazy glue
	     a clump of wax (in your favourite color)
	     a spool of thread
(Weapons)

	     a small sharp pocket knife (an old one should be used)
	     and onion
	     a bottle of coke (and a bottle opener)
	     a roman candle
	     10 ballons
	     6 eggs
	     bottle rockets
	     a few smoke bombs
	     and of course a pack or two of fire crakcers

  These are but a few of the many items you can use.With imagination and
practice you can invent new and better ideas.  We suggest doing this with a
friend,or at least having one on hand in case help is needed (they also make
good alibies) Once you have gathered all or most of these items you're ready to
plague war on your nieghbor.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (Starting out) Most of these feats are best executed during nighttime...thats
what the dark clothing is for right?  Some of the tricks can and must be
performed in the early morning, and some can be done in the daytime (as long as
you-know-who isn't around) Begin by filling your bag full of it's goodies and
get dressed in your dark clothing.  On a dark quiet night,slip out your window
into the neighborhood, pick the desired neighbor and his/her house and begin
your independant war...

  (Warnings) Ok,your outside of the culpricks house and your wondering what to
do.So we'll tell you what to do...First of all, do you want to give him a
warning and then get really big?  If so then keep reading, if not then skip this
section and goto the next s Replacing Mr.Neighbors new newspapers with the old
ones in good shape would keep him guessing at whats going on in the world.  You
can of course get a little bit more drastic by taking your clump of wax and
melting it all over his doorstep.  This is best acclomplished by using your
lighter and aerosal can.  Light your lighter and hold it about 1 to 2 feet away
from your ae Make sure the wax gets everywhere and it melts real good, and I
guarrentee, that when Mr.Nieghbor comes home, he's gonna throw a fit, in fact if
you look closely you may see steam rising up from his ears.  Heres where you use
your camera...from a safe dist Another effective warning would be taking
Mrs.Neighbors undies and bras and littering the street with them...or run them
up the nearest flag pole, but don't forget to put her name on them...so they can
be returned.
