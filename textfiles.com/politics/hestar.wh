                   PRESIDENT BUSH ON HEAD START


          "Many children need a Head Start, and we're going to make
          sure they get it...[I]n Head Start we found a government
          program that works...to strengthen families and
          communities for the future."
                              --   President George Bush
                                   January 21, 1992



Summary:  Head Start -- A Program That Works.

o    Head Start now provides 622,200 pre-school children from low-
     income families with a comprehensive child development
     program.  Stressing parental involvement, Head Start helps to
     meet families' educational, health, nutritional, and social
     needs.

o    President Bush believes deeply in the values of parental
     involvement and volunteerism which Head Start promotes.  The
     program also reflects his stated goal that, by the year 2000,
     all American children will begin school ready to learn.

o    Children enrolled in Head Start receive immunizations, medical
     and dental care, speech and hearing screening, and social
     services.   Every program provides at least one meal per
     session for enrolled children.  A typical program lasts nine
     months, with children benefiting from three to four hours of
     services each day.  It can take place in their homes, at a
     central location, or in a combination of sites.

o    President Bush has more than doubled Head Start funding.  His
     Administration has proposed the largest single year funding
     increase in Head Start's history -- $600 million -- in his FY
     1993 budget.  The President also has worked to assure that the
     parents of every interested eligible and disadvantaged child
     have the opportunity to enroll their child in Head Start for
     one year before starting school.

President Bush's Initiatives

o    The Bush Administration has improved Head Start in numerous
     ways during his first term.

     --   Increased Funding --  When President Bush took office,
          funding appropriated for Head Start was $1.235 billion. 
          The President proposed increased funding each year, with
          the FY 1992 funding totalling $2.2 billion.  If Congress
          approves his request for next year, funding will increase
          another 27%, to $2.8 billion, a 127% increase since the
          President took office.

     --   Increased Participation -- When President Bush took
          office, 448,000 children were enrolled in Head Start. 
          His funding proposal for next year would enable the
          program to serve 157,000 more children than this year,
          for a total of 779,200 children -- a record expansion of
          74% under President Bush.  Over 800,000 Americans also
          lent their time last year as Head Start volunteers, and
          the President encourages more to do so.

o    Increased Effectiveness -- In addition to funding increases,
     the President supports initiatives to make Head Start a better
     program.  These initiatives include:

     --   Drug Prevention -- The President's proposed FY 1993
          budget includes $30.6 million, $9 million more than this
          year, to help Head Start families who face or are at risk
          of facing problems stemming from alcohol or drug abuse.

     --   Evaluation -- The budget includes $12 million to monitor
          the effectiveness of Head Start.

     --   Parental Involvement and Support -- The Administration
          will continue to support and expand Head Start's new
          Family Service Centers, which provide parents with
          literacy, job training, and substance abuse prevention
          services.

     --   Easing the Transition -- To assure that Head Start
          presents long-term benefits, the Bush Administration is
          working to strengthen links between Head Start programs
          and the schools Head Start children will enter. 
          President Bush has awarded $20 million to 32 communities
          to develop collaboration strategies between Head Start
          and local schools.  The Department of Education is
          working closely with Head Start to ensure that the
          elementary school system builds on the accomplishments of
          Head Start.
