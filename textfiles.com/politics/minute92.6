Subject: Minutes of June Meeting, Finally


MINUTES OF AUSTIN EFF DIRECTORS' MEETING - June 9, 1992
    Prepared by Steve Jackson.
    Board members present: John Quarterman, Matt Lawrence, Steve
Jackson, Ed Cavazos. Observing: Bruce Sterling, Dick Anderson, Dave
Smith.
    The minutes of the last meeting were approved.
 
OFFICERS' REPORTS
   PRESIDENT
   VP - Office vacant, Jon Lebkowsky having resigned. He has said 
that he will reconsider . . . but it's up in the air.
   SECRETARY - "I'm doing agendas and minutes. I have turned the
finance notes and $ over to Smoot. What else should I be doing?"
   TREASURER - We still do not have a Texas CPA.
 
CHARTER, BYLAWS, INCORPORATION
   The Board discussed the "status" question at great length. It was
decided that Steve Jackson would write a letter to Mitch Kapor,
covering the various points that were raised during the meeting and
expressing our great perceived need for a final decision about our
status. (Late note: Due to illness, SJ was unable to finish work
on the letter, but it was written and sent.)
   In the meantime, Steve Ryan, in Houston, is preparing recommenda-
tions for a corporate charter. He strongly advises that the charter
be entirely separate from the bylaws.
 
CYBERTEX
   After lengthy discussion, the following decisions were made:
   (1) Cybertex is not dead. The Board remains committed to organizing
a convention for the residents of cyberspace.
   (2) However, the April 1992 date is no longer reasonable. Rather than
set a date now, we will take as much time as is necessary for study and
set a new date when we're confident of it.
   (3) The first step is to rebuild the committee structure, from the
top down. Ed Cavazos will continue to ponder the problem.
 
COMMITTEE REPORTS
    Incorporation Committee - Steve Jackson, Ed Cavazos, Frank Kurzawa.
On hold until we have a decision from National.
    Police Liaison Committee - Bruce Sterling, Dick Anderson and, subject
to his acceptance, Smoot Carl-Mitchell. No report.
    BBS Study Committee: Dave Smith, Matt Lawrence, Loyd Blankenship.
Nothing new.
    SPA Committee - Dave Smith, Bruce Sterling. Bruce reported that,
though rumors of a SPA presence are rife at UT, it seems to be an
urban legend. There is no sign that the SPA is really conducting raids,
investigations or anything else in Austin.
    Program Committee - Ad-hoc committees for each upcoming meeting
are still needed.
    June Cyberdawg: Will be held Monday the 22nd at High Time, 3rd
and Congress, 7:30pm. Bruce to supply videos, Susan to publicize.
    July: Ed Cavazos, Dick Anderson - panel on sysop issues. Date not set.
    August Cyberdawg: Volunteers still needed to run it. Date not set.
    September meeting: JSQ - program on networks. Date not set.
    October Cyberdawg: Volunteers still needed to run it. Date not set.
    November meeting: Bruce Sterling will speak on "The Hacker Crackdown."
Volunteers still needed to run it. Date not set.

NEW BUSINESS . . . 
   Dick Anderson discussed his ideas for a school program.
   Loyd Blankenship is interested in doing multimedia work to
support/publicize EFF. The Board agreed to let him head a
Multimedia Committee, with the understanding that nothing would
be released without showing it to the Board.
