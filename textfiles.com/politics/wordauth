
WORD AUTHORITY MORE HABIT FORMING THAN HEROIN

by William Burroughs

[From the book 'Brion Gysin Let The Mice In', by Brion Gysin, edited by
Jan Herman, with texts by William Burroughs and Ian Sommerville; Something
Else Press, Inc., 1973.  Originally printed in 'The San Francisco
EARTHQUAKE', No. 1, 1967 (ed. Jan Herman).]

[Transcribers note:  This e-text typed in exactly as it is printed in the
book, including the typewriter symbols, which are positioned accurately
underneath key words in the text.  The margins are as printed in the book
also, except that the right margin of text is typeset justified in the
book; in this e-text they are unjustified.  The several consecutive lines
with nothing but typewriter symbols (no text above them), are also
margined according to the book (which was naturally typeset right-
justified since the symbols are all run together with no spaces); in this
e-text they look narrower because they aren't typeset.  The original
manuscript, however, written on a typewriter, was probably not margined
the same, except for the "I am right you are wrong" permutations (with
their accompanying typewriter symbols), which have their own narrow
margins.  Apologies if there are any typos in this e-text; please correct
them and re-release this file.]
