                FIREARMS LEGISLATION IN GREAT BRITAIN
                        (by Jan A. Stevenson)

        Most people of retirement age, though they may not  realize
   it, were born at a time when there was no  firearms  legislation
   to speak of in this country.  Nor had there ever  been, for  the
   first Firearms Act of any substance was that of 1920.  The  1920
   Act was a comprehensive one and gave Britain an extensive system
   of controls that have  rarely  been  exceeded  in  a  democratic
   society. Subsequent enactments have put more flesh on the bones,
   but the structure of controls that the  government  of  the  day
   devised serves us still.

        From the  point  of  view  of  social  history,  as  recent
   research  has  made  clear,  the  1920  Act  is  a  particularly
   important  document.  It  marks  a  profound  shift  --indeed  a
   reversal-- in the British state's attitude toward its  citizens.
   In 1900 the Prime Minister said that he would "laud the day when
   there was a rifle in every cottage in England."  The Lord  Mayor
   hosted a meeting at Mansion House, attended  by,  among  others,
   the Duke of Westminister, the Archbishop of York  and  the  Lord
   Mayor of Liverpool, with the purpose of founding a, "Society  of
   Working Men's Rifle Clubs, for facilitating rifle shooting, more
   especially  in  the  evening,  with  small   bore   rifles   and
   inexpensive ammunition, as an ordinary branch of  recreation  by
   working men's and working boys' clubs and institutions."

        The Duke of Norfolk undertook to chair the new  Association
   while Lord  Roberts,  then  Commander-in-Chief,  had  agreed  to
   accept the presidency on his retirement from the Army.

        According  to  The  Times:  " ... the  scheme  would  be  a
   cooperative one, that is the  gentlemen  of  the  country  would
   contribute to  the  funds,  whilst  the  working  men  would  be
   expected to join the clubs and make themselves efficient in  the
   matter of rifle shooting."

        This was very different from the purpose of the  1920  Act,
   which was precisely to ensure that working men would not be able
   to lay hands on a rifle or make  themselves  proficient  in  its
   use. It was not deemed politic, however, to say so, and the bill
   was put through as a  crime  prevention  measure.  Its  progress
   through  parliament  had  been  carefully   prepared,   and   it
   encountered very little opposition.

        Police Superintendent Colin Greenwood who,  as  a  Cropwood
   Fellow at the Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge,
   during 1970-71, was the  first  to  conduct  serious,  scholarly
   research in this field, recalled some years later how baffled he
   had been by the motivation of the 1920 Act.

        "The question troubled me for some time because I was naive
   enough  to  accept  the  assurances  of  the  day   that   their
   legislation was aimed at the armed criminal...During the  period
   1911 to 1913, firearms were involved in an average of 45  crimes
   of all types per year.  During  the period  1915  to  1917,  the
   average had fallen to 15 cases per year.  Would to God  that  we
   could have  such  figures  today.  Why,  then,  was  legislation
   introduced? ... It was not until I read the diaries of the  then
   Cabinet Secretary  that  the  truth  emerged."  [Speech;  Rhodes
   House, Oxford, June 1983.]

        The truth, as Colin Greenwood belatedly discovered, and  as
   recently released Cabinet papers have underlined, was  that  the
   Government was extremely  concerned  by  the  possibility  of  a
   Bolshevik  style  revolution  in  Britain.   The   police   were
   insufficient to deal with the anticipated  troubles;  the  Army,
   after demobilization, of conscripts, would  be  insufficient  as
   well.  According to the Chief  of  the  Imperial General  Staff,
   there would soon be only 38 Regular Army battalions in Britain.

        "On the assumption that an  adequate  police  force  is  in
   existence, it is considered essential to maintain  the  infantry
   garrisons in Great Britain at not less than 40,000 men in  order
   to give a minimum strength  of  30,000  effective  bayonets  for
   employment in an emergency." [PRO CAB 24/96 XCH 62903]

        The Chief of the I.G.S. was unable to guarantee this beyond
   March of 1920 and added that, "Further, an adequate police force
   does no apparently exist."  He warned  that  if  the  Army  were
   called upon at an early stage of civil disturbances, "it will be
   dispersed, and thus  the  last  reserve  in  the  hands  of  the
   Government will be dissipated."

        Sir Eric Geddes, Minister  of  Transport,  complained  that
   there were only eight battalions in the north,  and  he  feared,
   "...a revolutionary outbreak in Glasgow, Liverpool or London  in
   the early spring, when a definite attempt may be made  to  seize
   the  reins  of  Government ... It is not  inconceivable  that  a
   dramatic and successful coup d'etat  in  some  large  center  of
   population might win the  support  of  the  unthinking  mass  of
   labour..." [PRO CAB 25/20]

        The Home Secretary reminded the Cabinet that the Bolsheviks
   had staged a revolution in Winnipeg, and now  that  the  wartime
   blockade was dismantled, their emissaries could be  expected  in
   Britain, doubtless bearing vast quantities of forged  five-pound
   notes such as had been discovered  in  Odessa,  when  the  White
   Russian Army had taken the city.

        Geddes proposed: "...a  meeting  of  Mayors  of  provincial
   cities (to) ascertain from them how far  they  are  prepared  to
   create skeleton organizations locally  for  dealing  with  civil
   disturbances when they occur, such skeleton organizations to  be
   of a secret nature." [PRO CAB 25/20]

        A committee chaired by Sir Nevil  Macready,  Commission  of
   Metropolitan Police,  recommended  that  each  regimental  depot
   throughout the country should  hold  1,000  stand  of  arms  and
   appropriate quantities of ammunition  as  "the  best  method  of
   making  them  available  to  loyalists  in  the  event   of   an
   emergency."  Bonar Law had urged the month before that, "weapons
   ought to  be  available  for  distribution  to  friends  of  the
   Government."

        The Prime Minister had been told in Cabinet that,  "A  bill
   is needed to license persons to bear arms.  This has been useful
   in Ireland because the Authorities know whom  was  possessed  of
   arms." The bill was soon forthcoming. It was introduced into the
   House of Lords on the 19th of April and sent to the  Commons  on
   the 6th of May.

        The Home Secretary, Mr. Edward Shortt, gave no hint of  the
   matters that were  so  tormenting  the  Cabinet.  The  bill,  he
   assured the House, was, "...designed to maintain greater control
   so that, as far as possible, criminals or weak  minded  persons,
   and those who should not have firearms  may  be  prevented  from
   having these dangerous and lethal firearms.  As far as possible,
   we have provided that legitimate sport should not be in any  way
   hampered, and so  that  any  person  who  has  good  reason  for
   possessing firearms, or to whom there is no  objection,  may  be
   entitled to have them; but we hope, by means of  this  bill,  to
   prevent criminals and persons of  that  description  from  being
   able to have revolvers and to use them."

        These words sound  remarkably  similar  to  those  recently
   uttered by today's Home Secretary, Douglas  Hurd.  Mr.  Shortt's
   reassuring tone, as he described to the  House  his  concern  to
   protect the public from  armed  crime  whilst  safeguarding  the
   legitimate interests of shooting  sportsmen,  was  no  doubt  in
   contrast to the atmosphere in the Cabinet Room in Downing Street
   where he and his colleagues anxiously discussed the  possibility
   of strafing the working  class  from  the  air  whilst  fielding
   30,000 bayonets against them on the ground.

        What happened to Lord Salisbury's hope, expressed only  two
   decades earlier, of  having  a  rifle  in  every  cottage?  What
   happened to the  absolute  trust  on  the  part  of  the  ruling
   classes, as exemplified  in  the  founding  of  the  Society  of
   Working Men's Rifle Clubs, in the patriotism and decency of  the
   working class?  The view then was that if  Britain  should  have
   need to raise a mass army of national defense, the working class
   would form the infantry, and that the defense of the realm would
   depend on their ability to use their individual weapons with the
   expertise born of years of practice.  That view,  as  it  turned
   out, was to be vindicated within fifteen years in  the  trenches
   of Northern France.  And finally, what made  the  Government  so
   determined  to  truncate  one  of  the  essential  liberties  of
   freeborn Englishmen that they would legislate  that  liberty  to
   extinction?

        Clearly,  the  Bolshevik  Revolution  in  Russia  and   the
   formation of  the  "Third  International"  with  the  object  of
   exporting insurrection, had provided the panic element.  But  it
   would  be  oversimplistic  to   suggest   this   as   sufficient
   explanation, for there had been several bills during the pre-war
   period that had presaged the 1920 Act. During the second reading
   debate  in  the  House,  the  Member  for  Hull,  Lt.  Commander
   Kenworthy, expressed great concern: "In the  past,  one  of  the
   most jealously  guarded  rights  of  the  English  was  that  of
   carrying arms ... It has been a well  known  object  of  Central
   Government of this country to deprive people of their weapons."

        The bill itself was based on the secret report of a "purely
   departmental" committee chaired by Sir  Ernley  Blackwell,  KCB,
   who had been charged on the 6th December, 1917, to consider  the
   "restrictions  which  should   be   imposed   upon   possession,
   manufacture, sale, import and export of firearms in  the  United
   Kingdom after the war."  Blackwell was Assistant Under Secretary
   of State for the Home Department, and his  committee  recognized
   two  main  sources   of   postwar   danger:   the   "savage   or
   semi-civilized  tribesmen  in  outlying  parts  of  the  British
   Empire" and "the anarchist or 'intellectual' malcontent  of  the
   great cities whose weapon is the bomb and the automatic  pistol.
   There is some force in the view that the latter will  in  future
   prove the more dangerous of the two."

        We might tentatively suggest  that  the  Bolshevik  spectre
   served to focus the anxieties aroused by the prewar  anarchists.
   The anarchists, however, were regarded  for  the  most  part  as
   foreign malcontents rather  than  as  a  direct  threat  to  the
   domestic body politic:  Communism, on  the  other  hand,  risked
   infecting the lower classes across a broad spectrum.

        One of the documents that Blackwell's committee  considered
   was the draft pistols Bill of 1911, with which Blackwell himself
   had been closely involved, but that had never  been  put  before
   the House.  It had, for the first time, incorporated a system of
   certificates to be administered by  the  police,  and  had  been
   intended to stiffen the Pistols Act, 1903, which  had  succeeded
   in its passage  through  Parliament  only  by  virtue  of  being
   anodyne.  There had been previous attempts to legislate in  1887
   and 1893, but these had been soundly  rejected  on  the  grounds
   that they represented an unconstitutional infringement of  basic
   rights.

        Of  that,  there  should  be  little  doubt.  Sir   William
   Blackstone's  Commentaries,  first  published   in   1765,   had
   meticulously   described   the   development,   substance    and
   significance of  "...the  rights,  or  as  they  are  frequently
   termed, the liberties of Englishmen...": "And we have seen  that
   these rights  consist,  primarily,  in  the  free  enjoyment  of
   personal  security,  of  personal   liberty   and   of   private
   property...And lastly, to vindicate these rights, when  actually
   violated and attacked, the subjects of England are entitled,  in
   the first place, to the regular administration and  free  course
   of  justice  in  the  courts  of  law;  next  to  the  right  of
   petitioning  the  King  and  Parliament  for  the   redress   of
   grievances; and lastly, to the right of having  and  using  arms
   for self preservation and defense."

        The right to keep arms no doubt developed as a corollary of
   the natural law right of self defense, and by Anglo-Saxon  times
   a corresponding obligation was clearly defined.  All able-bodied
   freemen were expected to take part in the "hue and cry" to bring
   criminals to justice, and to serve in the army in time  of  war.
   For both of these purposes, they were expected to maintain  arms
   according to their rank and station.  A twice yearly  inspection
   insured that the arms concerned were  kept  in  good  order  and
   ready for use.

        The Normans retained this system, and  indeed  refined  it.
   Henry II's Assize of Arms of 1181 detailed the types of  weapons
   which persons of various rank were expected to have on  hand,  a
   question that was updated in 1285 by the Statute of  Westminster
   [13 Edw I c6].  The  greater one's  wealth,  the  greater  one's
   contribution, but even the poor were under  obligation:  "...and
   all others that may shall have bows and arrows."

        Indeed, firearms were at first regarded  by  the  Crown  as
   noisome, inefficient things that might tempt people to  neglect,
   "...the good and laudable exercise of the longbow  which  always
   heretofore hath been the surety, safeguard and continual defense
   of this Realm of England." [33 Hen VIII c6]

        By the end of the 16th century, the  musket  had  displaced
   the bow as the primary  infantry  weapon,  and  by  Blackstone's
   time, the right to bear arms, and specifically firearms,  was  a
   well recognized element  of  the  Constitution,  existing  quite
   separately from the obligational aspect.

        This was  clearly  enunciated  during  the  debate  on  the
   Seizure of  Arms  Bill  of  1820,  in  response  to  a  fear  of
   insurrection in the industrializing North.  The Luddite violence
   of 1811 and 1812 had required 12,000 troops to put down,  and  a
   resurgence had led to the "Peterloo Massacre" of 1819  in  which
   eleven people were killed and hundreds injured as  the  Yeomanry
   dispersed a crowd estimated at some eighty thousand.  There  was
   much talk of revolution and reports, no  doubt  exaggerated,  of
   secret stores of arms and men drilling or training with them.

        The Seizure of Arms Act was to authorize  justices  of  the
   peace to issue warrants for the seizure and  detention  of  arms
   that might be used  by  revolutionaries.  Parliament  recognized
   that it was on delicate  ground  and  clearly  had  no  wish  to
   abrogate a right.  The Act applied only to the  two  cities  and
   eleven counties in which there was a real fear  of  unrest,  and
   would lapse after two years.  Moreover, firearms (unlike  pikes)
   could only be seized if it could be demonstrated that they  were
   kept for a purposed dangerous to the peace.

        Despite the carefully circumscribed terms of the bill,  Mr.
   T.W. Anson contended, during the debate on  the  14th  December,
   1819, that, "The principles on which it (the  bill)  is  founded
   and the temper in which it is framed appear to me to be so  much
   at variance with the free spirit of our  venerated  constitution
   and so contrary to the undoubted right  which  the  subjects  of
   this country have ever possessed -- the right of retaining  arms
   for the defense of themselves, their families and properties  --
   that  I  cannot  look  upon  it  without  loudly  expressing  my
   disapprobation and regret."

        After a lengthy debate in  which  Mr.  Anson  found  strong
   support, Mr. George Canning, later Prime Minister, summed up for
   the Government:  "I am perfectly willing to admit the  right  of
   the subject to hold arms laid down by the Honorable and  Learned
   Gentleman (Mr. Anson), having stated it on the authority of  Mr.
   Justice Blackstone.  The doctrine so laid down, I am willing  to
   admit,  is  no  other  than  the   doctrine   of   the   British
   Constitution.  The Bill of Rights, correctly quoted and properly
   construed, brings me to the construction of the Bill  which,  in
   fact, recognizes the right of the  subject  to  have  arms,  but
   qualifies that right in such a manner as the  necessity  of  the
   case requires."

        It was generally accepted that Mr.  Canning  had  made  his
   case, and that by tailoring the bill  to  meet  a  specific  and
   tightly circumscribed  problem,  the  extent  to  which  he  had
   infringed the rights of  the  subject  was  acceptable  and  met
   Blackstone's  prescription  of,  "...restraints  so  gentle  and
   moderate, as will appear on further  inquiry,  that  no  man  of
   sense or probity would wish to see them slackened."

        Subsequent  legislative  proposals  were  less  clearly  in
   accord with this principle, and it was to be  nearly  a  century
   before a measure restricting firearms ownership or use was again
   enacted.  The possible exception that one might cite was the Gun
   License Act of 1870, which required anyone who wished  to  carry
   or use a gun outside the  curtilege  of  a  dwelling  house,  to
   purchase a ten  shilling  license  at  the  post  office.  This,
   however was strictly a revenue measure;  it  remained  in  force
   until 1967.

        Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act, 1824, made it an offense  to
   be in possession of an offensive weapon with intent to commit  a
   felony.  But providing he was free of felonious intent and  paid
   his ten shillings to the post office, the Englishman's right  to
   acquire, possess and carry firearms was uninhibited by law until
   the twentieth century.

        There had been several measures proposed toward the end  of
   the  19th  century,  but  all  fell,  generally  on  grounds  of
   unconstitutionality.  The Pistols  Bill,  1895,  made  it  to  a
   division, where it failed by 183 votes to 75. Mr. C. H. Hopwood,
   Member for South East Middleton, would appear to have  reflected
   the feeling of the House when he suggested that,  "To  say  that
   because there were some persons who would make  violent  use  of
   pistols, therefore the right of purchase or possession by  every
   Englishman should be taken away, is monstrous."

        A much diluted bill, however, was to  succeed  eight  years
   later.  The Pistols Act, 1903, provided  that  before  one could
   purchase a pistol or revolver  at  retail,  one  had  either  to
   produce a gun license or game license,  available  at  the  post
   office, or give reasonable proof  that  one  was  a  householder
   intending to use the pistol in or within the  curtilege  of  his
   own house, or present a letter, countersigned by  a  justice  of
   the peace or a police officer of the rank of inspector or above,
   that one was departing abroad for a  period  of  six  months  or
   more.  There was also a bar on retail sales to persons under the
   age of 18; private sales were outside the scope of the Act.  The
   only effect of the Act was to oblige retail customers  who  were
   not householders to pay a ten shilling tax at the  post  office.
   The burden of the law was minimal and therefore tolerable.

        The purpose of  the  bill,  according  to  Mr.  Hulme,  its
   sponsor, was not to prevent crime  but  hopefully  to  eliminate
   some of the accidents, particularly involving young people, that
   one heard of from time to time.

        Mr. Hulme's intentions notwithstanding, the  1903  Act  was
   soon criticized for not  accomplishing  what  it  had  not  been
   intended to accomplish, and a much stiffened version  was  ready
   for introduction in 1911.  Soundings may have indicated  that it
   would encounter the same sort of resistance  that  had  scuttled
   the 1893 and 1895 bills, however, since  it  was  never  brought
   before Parliament.

        This persistent legislative activity from 1893 onward,  for
   all of its lack of success, suggests the emergence of a feeling,
   in administrative circles, that the Constitution was outmoded in
   this respect, and that some beneficial effect would accrue  from
   restricting the legitimate private ownership of firearms.

        The effect anticipated is not always easy to deduce for, as
   Greenwood belatedly discovered, legislative proposals  sometimes
   sail under false  colours.  This  could  be  the  said  to  have
   particularly been the  case  of  the  Firearms  Act,  1920,  the
   Criminal  Justice  Act,  1967,  (which  introduce  the   shotgun
   controls) and perhaps the current bill as well.

        The  Firearms  Act,  1920,  established  the  framework  of
   controls that has characterized the British system  ever  since.
   This was strictly and administrative confection:  the  Blackwell
   Committee, upon whose recommendations the Act was based, met  in
   secret and their report was never published.  The  chairman, Sir
   Ernley Blackwell, was a senior Home Office official,  while  the
   secretary, who was also a member of the committee, was Mr.  F.J.
   Dryhurst, recently Commissioner of  the  Prison  Service.  Other
   members represented the  Metropolitan  Police,  the  County  and
   Borough Police Forces, the board of Customs, Board of Trade, the
   War Office and the Irish Office.

        The committee proceeded on  the  assumption  that  controls
   were  desirable  and  that  they   would   be   effective.   The
   Commissioner of Police for  the  Metropolis  had  reported  that
   during the three years 1911-1913 there had  been  123  cases  in
   which firearms had either been used in crime or had  been  found
   in the possession of persons who had come into the hands of  the
   police. For the corresponding period, 1915-1917, there had  been
   47 cases. Blackwell ascribed this decline, from an average of 41
   cases  per  year  to  15.6  cases  per  year,  entirely  to  the
   beneficial  effects  of  the  wartime  Defense  of   the   Realm
   Regulations, which required a license for the retail purchase of
   rifles, pistols, and ammunition. Blackwell anticipated that when
   the Regulations  expired,  instances  of  armed  crime  "may  be
   expected  to  rise  to  or  above  their  former  level."   With
   hindsight, and armed crime rate in the Metropolis  of  47  cases
   per year  sounds  Utopian.  Blackwell's  contention,  "That  the
   control of firearms should be made far more stringent than it is
   now is a proposition  that  hardly  anyone  could  be  found  to
   question,"  [Blackwell, page  1] might  best  be  taken  in  the
   context of the secrecy with which the  Committee  undertook  its
   deliberation  and  its  exclusively  civil  service  and  police
   composition.

   Blackwell submitted his report on the 16th of November, 1918. On
   the same day, he wrote to  Sir  Maurice  Bonham  Carter  at  the
   Ministry of Reconstruction, who had been responsible, along with
   Sir Edward Troup, for setting the committee up.

        Of the report, Blackwell wrote in a  covering  letter,  "It
   will be better not to publish it.  There is a good  deal  in the
   Arms Traffic Report that could not be published  and  a  regards
   our Report, any prolonged discussion with the 'trade' is  to  be
   avoided." [PRO REC1/342/55946] "You will see," he assured Bonham
   Carter, "that we have arrived  at  framing  a  fairly  stringent
   system of control."

        Stringent it was. Indeed, the certification procedure  that
   Blackwell's committee designed has been recognized as  about  as
   stringent as can be effected short of an  outright  prohibition.
   The  distinctive  features  are  the   wide-ranging   discretion
   accorded to chief  constables  and  the  burden  laid  upon  the
   applicant to "satisfy"  the  chief  constable  both  as  to  his
   personal suitability and as to his  legitimate  requirement  for
   the firearms or ammunition applied for.

        Complaints  of  overzealousness  were  almost   immediately
   forthcoming.  The  first  appeal  against  a  chief  constable's
   decision was  heard  at  Middleton  Police  Court  the  20th  of
   December, 1929; the Act had come into  effect  the  1st  of  the
   month previous.  The Rev. Henry Evans, vicar of  Tonge, appealed
   against the refusal of  the  chief  constable  to  issue  him  a
   certificate for a Winchester rifle which he had owned  for  many
   years for sporting purposes and for the control of vermin in his
   poultry yard, as he had repeatedly explained to police  officers
   on the occasions of their recent visits.

        When making out the application form, the  Rev.  Evans  had
   indicated that his reason for requiring a certificate was so  as
   to comply with the law. The chief constable  refused  to  accept
   this, and the Rev. Evans  refused  to  fill  out  another  form,
   noting that there was no requirement in the law for him to  have
   made out the first one.

        The court found in Rev. Evans' favour. The Home Office,  in
   an internal note, complained that, "The police chose a  case  in
   which they were  very  likely  to  lose,  and  covered  by  H.O.
   instructions to issue certificates freely to  reputable  persons
   already in possession." [PRO HO45/11024/408571]

        The instructions referred to had been promulgated the  24th
   of  November  and  were  supplemental  to  extensive  notes  for
   guidance issued to chief constables on the 5th of  October.  The
   fact that the Home Secretary found it necessary, within weeks of
   the Act's taking effect, to bring the constabularies'  attention
   to, "...the  following  observations,  which  may  assist  Chief
   Constables in enforcing the Act without unnecessary interference
   with persons who were properly in possession of firearms at  the
   time of the passing of the Act, and  are  not  likely  to  abuse
   permission to retain them," [HO Circ.  406,571/76]  is  probably
   indicative of a substantial volume of complaints.

        The chief constables were less  than  appreciative  of  the
   Home Secretary's assistance in these  matters.  Their  Districts
   1,2,& 3 Conference forwarded a resolution  to  the  Home  Office
   expressing, "...regret that the Home  Office  has  seen  fit  by
   their circular 408,571/76 of the 24th November, 1920, to  modify
   the previous instructions issued to  Chief  Constables  in  Home
   Office circular 408, 571/33 of 5th October, 1920, as such action
   had placed Chief  Constables  in  a  difficult  position."  [PRO
   HO45/11024-62971]

        They asked that the avenue  of  appeal  to  the  courts  be
   abolished, and that complaints be referred to the  Secretary  of
   State for adjudication.

        By 1934, the Act, and the system of  controls  over  rifles
   and pistols  which  it  incorporated,  had  "run  in,"  and  the
   Government felt  that  it  was  time  for  a  review.  The  Home
   Secretary  appointed  a   Departmental   Committee   under   the
   chairmanship  of  Sir  Archibold  Bodkin,  a  recently   retired
   Directory of Public Prosecutions, "...to  consider  the  various
   types of firearms and similar weapons ... and to report whether,
   in the interests of public safety, any amendment of the  law  is
   necessary  or  desirable  in  respect  of   such   weapons   and
   ammunition." [HMSO Cmd. 4758.1934]

        Bodkin's committee was somewhat  more  broadly  based  than
   Blackwell's  (it  included  three  Members  of  Parliament)  and
   invited submissions. It heard oral evidence  from  38  witnesses
   representing   21   organizations,    and    received    written
   communications  from  ten  departments  and  organizations.  The
   report (Cmd.  4758)  was  published  in  December  of  1934  and
   reprinted in 1968.

        The Bodkin Report is  interesting  in  many  respects,  not
   least in its use of  statistical  evidence.  The  Committee  had
   requested an elaborate report from each chief officer of  police
   in Great Britain concerning, "...cases known to  the  police  in
   which certain types of weapons had, during the three years ended
   28th February, 1934, been "a) used by or found in the possession
   of persons engaged in crime  (including  cases  of  suicide)  or
   avoiding arrests, (or)  b)  the  cause  of  accidents  involving
   personal injuries." [Bodkin, page 2]

        The information thus gathered was tabulated and broken down
   so that details such as the age of  the  user,  the  calibre  or
   gauge of the weapon, the type of cartridge, and  the  degree  of
   injury were immediately accessible.  These  tables  cover  seven
   pages and are extraordinarily  well  set  out  and  useful.  The
   survey  covered:  shotguns,  sawed-off   shotguns,   smooth-bore
   pistols, toy or dummy pistols converted to fire,  toy  or  dummy
   pistols not converted, air pistols, and air guns or rifles -- in
   other words, those types of firearm that were not covered by the
   Firearms Act, 1920.

        The committee's decision to  seek  no  data  regarding  the
   types of firearm controlled by the 1920 Act meant both that  the
   effectiveness of that Act could not be  evaluated  and  that  no
   case for deregulation could be supported by quantitive evidence.
   This was the more unfortunate in that they were quite clear that
   deregulation was within their terms of reference  [Bodkin,  page
   3].

        The Committee's use of evidence  (or  lack  thereof)  opens
   them  to  criticism  on  several  points.  They  professed  much
   sympathy for the gun trade, which had been decimated by the 1920
   Act but whose remaining members had  "borne  their  losses  with
   resignation  and  have  loyally  cooperated  with  authorities."
   [Bodkin, page 10]

        Moreover, "It seems quite clear,"  they  report,  "that  in
   1920 Parliament intended to abstain, as far  as  possible,  from
   discouraging the formation of rifle clubs  and  target  practice
   generally." [Bodkin, page 15]. They were  earnestly  pressed  by
   the trade to deregulate .22 rifles, but declined to do so on the
   perhaps significant grounds that, "...it would be  a  retrograde
   step after 14 years of restriction  if  all  control  over  such
   weapons were abolished." [Bodkin, page 16]

        According to the evidence collected, ordinary shotguns  had
   been used in 94 crimes over the three years of the  study.  Shot
   pistols had been used in 25 and  sawed-off  shotguns  in  eight.
   Bodkin recommended placing the latter two types of weapon  under
   firearm certificate control, but favored leaving normal shotguns
   outside the Act. They may have been quite correct in  suggesting
   that shotguns so outnumbered shot pistols  that  a  roughly  4:1
   ratio of use in crime was not disproportionate. But they made no
   attempt to quantify the number of either  type  in  circulation,
   nor did they address their minds to the  question  of  what  was
   achieved by restricting sawed-off shotguns  when  both  shotguns
   and hacksaws were unrestricted.

        The Bodkin Committee collected a great deal of  information
   and did an impressive amount of work, but their line of argument
   is not always persuasive. One often suspects that  the  evidence
   is  decorative  and  that  the  report  actually   reflects   an
   administrative class view of what a well-ordered universe  would
   be  like.  Their  conclusion,  that  the  system   of   controls
   established by the Firearms Act,  1920,  "...lying  as  it  does
   largely in the hands of responsible officers of police, has,  in
   our opinion, been  well  administered  and  forms  an  efficient
   system of controlling the  sale  of  firearms  and  ammunition,"
   [Bodkin  page  9]  ignored  the  question  of  what  the  system
   accomplished. The members of the committee no doubt assumed that
   the controls were of some public benefit, but they did not  pose
   the question and sought no evidence that would have permitted an
   answer.

        The Bodkin Committee  suggested  a  number  of  changes  of
   detail in the 1920 Act, but none  of  structure.  Perhaps  their
   most notable proposals were that shotguns with barrels less than
   20 inches in length be subject to firearm  certificate  control,
   and that  machine  guns  be  removed  from  firearm  certificate
   control  and  be  reclassified  as   prohibited   weapons.   The
   reclassification of machine guns was at the  suggestion  of  the
   British Field Sports Society.

        The Bodkin committee recommendations were  incorporated  in
   the Firearms Act, 1936, which turned out to be longer  than  the
   act it amended. The following year,  the  1920  and  1936  Acts,
   along with  the  intervening  Firearms  and  Imitation  Firearms
   (Criminal Use) Act, 1933, and the Firearms Act, 1934 (regulating
   the sale to persons under seventeen of firearms and  ammunition)
   were consolidated in the Firearms Act, 1937, which was to remain
   in effect, virtually unamended, for thirty-one years.

        The Firearms Act, 1937, carried Britain through the  trauma
   of the Second World War, across the flat and tranquil decade  of
   the 1950's, and into an  era  of  spiraling  crime  and  quantum
   increases in criminal violence. The 1937 Act,  perhaps,  was  no
   more responsible for the latter phenomena than it  was  for  the
   period of remarkable repose that preceded it.

        In the absence of directly comparable statistics, all  that
   can be said with confidence is that the 1950's marked  the  last
   time, and perhaps the only time, that armed crime  had  been  as
   rare as it had  during  the  Belle  Epoque  when  there  was  no
   restrictive legislation at all.

        However, few people retained a clear memory of  the  period
   prior to  the  First  World  War,  and  across  the  intervening
   decades, the feeling had taken root that the low level of  armed
   crime must be due to the rigour of statutory restrictions.  When
   violent crime began its vertiginous rise in the mid-1960's,  the
   understandable  feeling  of  many  was  that  more   restrictive
   legislation was needed. The police were less prone to  such  and
   instinctive reaction, for chief  constables  realized  that  the
   degree of control  which  they  exercised  over  the  legitimate
   ownership of rifles and  pistols  left  little  to  be  desired.
   Shotguns remained uncontrolled, but  were  comparatively  rarely
   used in crime.

        The question,  nonetheless,  was  repeatedly  posed  as  to
   whether any benefit would be derived from drawing them into  the
   system. Invariable, the answer was that  would  not.  Sir  Frank
   Soskice, as Home Secretary, gave the matter close  consideration
   and told the House, on 11 February, 1965, while  announcing  the
   provisions of the forthcoming Firearms  Act,  1965,  that,  "The
   Government  have  considered  carefully   the   possibility   of
   extending to shotguns the  firearm  certificate  procedure,  but
   have decided against it. There  are  probably  at  least  50,000
   shotguns in legitimate use throughout the country and the burden
   which certification  would  put  on  the  police  would  not  be
   justified by the benefits which would result."

        Sir Frank was replaced at the Home Office toward the end of
   the year, and on the 3rd of March, 1966, Roy  Jenkins,  the  new
   Home Secretary, announced that he was reconsidering the  matter.
   He was,  he  said,  "actively  considering  new  legislation  in
   relation to shotguns." By the 23rd of June, the review had  been
   completed, and Mr. Jenkins reported that, "The type  of  shotgun
   which is freely available and which can be used without  special
   exemption was considerably restricted under the Firearms Act.  I
   must pay some regard to the burden of inspection which would  be
   put on the police. The police do not consider that it  would  be
   right to make an extension at this time."

        In other words, the matter had been looked into repeatedly,
   and the conclusion was that  it  was  simply  not  worth  doing.
   However, only seven weeks later, an incident occurred  that  was
   to lead Mr. Jenkins to reverse his position entirely.

        At 3:15 P.M. the 12th of August, a Metropolitan Police  "Q"
   car turned into Baybrook Street, Hammersmith. Foxtrot 11  pulled
   to the side, and two officers, DS Head and DC Wombell, left  the
   vehicle to approach a  parked  Vanguard  estate  car  containing
   three men. As they drew near, Harry Roberts shot  both  of  them
   dead with a .38 Enfield revolver. John Duddy leapt out  and  ran
   to the Q car, where he killed the driver,  PC  Fox,  with  three
   shots from a .380 Colt pistol. Britain's  greatest  manhunt  was
   on.

        John Duddy and an accomplice, John Witney, the owner of the
   Estate car,  who  had  been  present  at  the  time,  were  soon
   arrested. But it was three  months  before  Roberts,  a  Malayan
   veteran, was finally tracked down  and  captured  near  Bishop's
   Stortford, Hertfordshire. He had gone to ground in Epping Forest
   and worked his way north on foot.

        Meanwhile, the case  dominated  the  news  absolutely;  the
   gratuitous brutality of the crime aroused  widespread  revulsion
   and on the 6th of September, a memorial service  for  the  slain
   officers drew a thousand-strong  crowd  to  Westminister  Abbey,
   carrying  banners  calling  for  the  restoration   of   capital
   punishment in such cases.

        Hanging had only been finally abolished in November of 1965
   and Mr. Jenkins, whose feelings on the matter were  well  known,
   was under  heavy  pressure  from  press  and  public  alike,  to
   reintroduce it. On the 12th of September, less than a week after
   the demonstration at Westminster Abbey,  he  announced  that  he
   was, "...endeavouring to draw up plans to end  the  unrestricted
   purchase of shotguns. They can be purchased far too  easily,  by
   mail order or other  means,  and  there  is  evidence  that  the
   criminal use of  shotguns  is  increasing  rapidly,  still  more
   rapidly than that of other weapons." [Daily Telegraph 13.9.66]

        The "evidence" Mr. Jenkins referred to was the  records  of
   "indictable offenses involving firearms," a  disparate  category
   consisting mostly of damaged  property,  poaching,  threats  and
   assaults and so forth, rather than the  sort  of  "armed  crime"
   that most people would think of. However, this body of data,  as
   well as more relevant statistics,  had  been  available  to  Mr.
   Jenkins, as indeed it had been to  Sir  Frank  Soskice,  and  no
   doubt  had  been  carefully  studied  before  each  reached  his
   conclusion that proposals to further restrict shotguns were  not
   justified by the evidence.
 
        If one discounts the possibility that Mr.  Jenkins  thought
   that restricting shotgun ownership was  a  relevant  legislative
   response to and incident in which police officers were shot with
   pistols,  then  an  explanation  of  why  the   Home   Secretary
   completely reversed his policy is still needed.

        The  evidence  suggests   that   Mr.   Jenkins   introduced
   legislation against shotguns in hope of deflecting the  pressure
   for a reintroduction  of  capital  punishment.  If  so,  he  was
   successful, albeit at the cost of approximately half  a  million
   man hours of police time, per year, over the past twenty years.

        Rather than introducing a Firearms  (Amendment)  Bill  that
   might have attracted focused opposition, Mr.  Jenkins  used  the
   forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill, 1967, as the vehicle for  his
   proposed  measures.  This  was  an  immensely  significant   and
   controversial bill which, among other things, did away with  the
   requirement  for  a  full  hearing  of  evidence  at   committal
   proceedings,  instituted  a   parole   system,   abolished   the
   requirement for a unanimous verdict in criminal  trials,  placed
   restrictions on newspaper reporting of  committal  hearings  and
   introduced suspended prison sentences. Part V of the bill, which
   introduced licenses for shotguns,  was  well  camouflaged  in  a
   thicket of portentious and far reaching reforms to the  criminal
   justice system. Opposition to Part V, therefore, was  fragmented
   and diffuse.

        The next year, the Firearms  Act,  1968,  consolidated  the
   1937 Act and Part V of the Criminal Justice Act, along with  two
   intervening measures, the Air Guns and Shot Guns, etc.,  Act  of
   1962 and the Firearms Act, 1965. The former had originated as  a
   private  member's  bill,  introduced  Mr.  Brian  Harrison,  and
   regulated the circumstances under which young people between the
   ages of 14 and 21 might lawfully purchase, use or have in  their
   possession airguns, shotguns and firearms, as well as ammunition
   and pellets for them. The latter act was more interesting.

        The Firearms Act, 1965, was designed to strengthen the hand
   of the police against criminals, or suspected criminals, and  as
   such was supported by most of the shooting organizations, though
   some  of  its  provisions,  notably  a  clause  enabling   chief
   constables to attach conditions to the registration of  firearms
   dealers, have led to problems not then anticipated.

        Other  clauses  created  the  offense  of  armed  trespass,
   regulated the carrying of firearms and ammunition  in  a  public
   place, gave the police wider powers of search and arrest without
   warrant, penalized the carrying of  a  firearm  with  intent  to
   commit an indictable offense, increased the  minimum  length  of
   shotgun barrel  from  20  inches  to  24  inches  and  generally
   increased penalties overall.

        The most notable feature of the 1965 Act, however, was  the
   haste with which it was carried  through  Parliament.  The  Home
   Secretary did not intimate that he had it in mind  to  legislate
   until the 21st of January. Proposals were announced on the  11th
   February; the bill was introduced on the 28th  of  February  and
   given a second reading only two days later, on the 2nd of March.
   Third Reading was on the 12th of May and Royal Assent was  given
   the 5th of August.

        Significantly, the Murder (Abolition of the Death  Penalty)
   Bill was already at the committee stage before the Firearms Bill
   was introduced, yet did not become law until three months later.
   The haste with which the Firearms Bill had been patched together
   was reflected in the great  number  of  amendments  required  to
   eliminate anomalies and unintended effects.

        The Government were clearly anxious that the  abolition  of
   hanging might herald a new willingness on the part of  criminals
   to use violence of all forms and firearms in  particular.  Their
   anxiety was not  misplaced.  And  midway  through  the  Firearms
   Bill's passage, Roy Jenkins took office as Home Secretary. It is
   possible that  this  precedent  conditioned  his  actions  eight
   months later after the Shepherd's Bush murders, as the  incident
   in Baybrook Street became known.

        The Shepherd's Bush affair may also have contributed  to  a
   hardening  of  attitude  on  the  part  of   chief   constables.
   Certainly, in retrospect, 1967 seems to mark the beginning of an
   overt hostility toward the shooting sports on the part of  chief
   officers that  had  not  been  manifest  before.  Police  Review
   magazine described it this way: "There is an easily identifiable
   police attitude towards the possession of guns by members of the
   public. Every possible difficulty should be put in their way. No
   documentation can be too rigid,  no  security  requirements  too
   arbitrary,  which  prevents  guns  coming  into  the  hands   of
   criminals." [Police Review 8.10.82]

        People who wished to comply with the law  found  themselves
   subject to bureaucratic harassment as chief  constables  pursued
   an often acknowledged policy of "reducing the number of firearms
   in the hands of the public to the absolute  minimum."  Over  the
   next fifteen years, more than a  quarter  of  rifle  and  pistol
   certificate holders had been eliminated.  In  1968,  there  were
   216,281 firearm certificate holders in  England  and  Wales;  by
   1983, that figure was down to 159,804, a reduction of 56,477, or
   26%. The policies that achieved this substantial result involved
   a great deal of ultra vires activity  and  generated  resentment
   and animosity among those affected.

        In 1973, the Government decided  to  legislate  again,  and
   issued a Green Paper, The Control of Firearms in  Great  Britain
   (Cmd. 5297), which was to  achieve  some  notoriety.  The  Green
   Paper was based on the report of a working party chaired by  Sir
   John McKay,  then  H.M.  Chief  Inspector  of  Constabulary  for
   England and Wales. The rest of the  committee,  which  consisted
   exclusively of members of the police, the Home  Office  and  the
   Scottish Office, have not been identified; the report has  never
   been released. One can only judge it through the Green Paper.

        The McKay Committee gathered some  interesting  statistics,
   but the Green  Paper  used  them  in  a  manner  so  casual  and
   self-serving that the argument, rather than being  bolstered  by
   the evidence, was discredited. Professor  Richard  Harding,  who
   studied the Green  Paper  with  great  care,  described  it  as,
   "...statistically defective...scientifically quite useless;  the
   data are presented in a way which precludes objective evaluation
   by any one else." [1979 Crim LR 772]

        Nor was the Green Paper well served by its tone, which  was
   sanctimonious and authoritarian. Its  premise  was  simply  that
   armed crime was increasing,  therefore  more  restrictions  were
   needed. Bodkin was cited as an authority for his proposition: "A
   Departmental Committee set up in 1934 found that  the  1920  Act
   had reduced the likelihood...of criminals  obtaining  possession
   of the more dangerous firearms  (rifles  and  pistols)."  [Green
   Paper, page 3]

        In fact, the Bodkin Committee had "found"  no  such  thing,
   but had simply asserted it, having avoided, perhaps consciously,
   gathering any evidence that might  have  permitted  testing  the
   hypothesis.

        The Green Paper met a hostile reception in  Parliament  and
   in the press, and was soon withdrawn by the Government. Some  of
   its proposals, however, were adopted as "force policy" by  chief
   constables, and were applied as if they were law.

        Shortly after the  Green  Paper  was  withdrawn,  the  Home
   Office began increasing  the  fees  for  grant  and  renewal  of
   firearm and shotgun certificates in a manner that many  regarded
   as punitive, though this was denied by ministers. There had been
   inflation adjusting increases in 1969 and  1971;  the  increases
   begun  in  1973  were   therefore   on   top   of   an   already
   inflation-adjusted figure. Over the ensuing give years, the fees
   for grant and renewal of a firearms certificate were  raised  by
   714% and 800% respectively; the increases for grant and  renewal
   of a shotgun certificate were 1,200% and 800%. The  Home  Office
   conducted several "costing exercises," each of which in turn was
   thoroughly discredited.

        The twenty  years  following  have  been  characterized  by
   legislative stability, offset by an increased willingness to use
   extra-legal means for imposing  a  preferred  policy  line.  The
   latter part of this period is also distinguished by  more  overt
   hostility toward private firearms ownership on the part of chief
   officers, and by a far more  active  participation  in  pressure
   politics by the police.

        The Association of  Chief  Police  Officers  determined  in
   December, 1982, to push resolutely to have shotguns placed under
   the same controls as rifles and pistols. With the assistance  of
   the Superintendents Conference and the Police  Federation,  they
   have since  undertaken  three  "campaigns"  characterized  by  a
   carrot and stick approach. An hysterical press campaign would be
   followed by an invitation to the Home Secretary to legislate  in
   the manner desired.  The  most  recent  campaign  has  used  the
   Hungerford incident as a  platform  and  has  proved  imminently
   successful. As the Home  Secretary  has  several  times  stated,
   Hungerford had provided the opportunity to "move  forward,"  and
   the police were among  the  foremost  "urgers  forward"  in  the
   matter.

        The Firearms (Amendment)  Bill  indeed  represents  a  move
   forward in the sense that legislation in this  field,  in  Great
   Britain,  represents  a  linear  progression  from  liberty   to
   prohibition. As we have demonstrated, the  position  up  to  the
   outbreak of the First World War was that the right to keep  arms
   was one of the elementary liberties of  freeborn  Englishmen,  a
   fundamental part  of  the  Constitution.  This  right  has  been
   progressively circumscribed, limited,  eroded,  discounted,  and
   finally repudiated. The effect  of  the  present  bill  will  be
   finally to eradicate it. It subsists, at present, in relation to
   shotguns, provided that one is of good character. The effect  of
   the present bill is that no matter how good one's character, one
   will not be permitted  to  possess  a  shotgun  unless  one  can
   demonstrate an administratively approved "good  reason"  for  so
   doing.

        But if Mr. Hurd meant to imply that "moving forward"  meant
   enhancing the social good by addressing effective legislation to
   a defined problem, he needs to make his case. Perhaps his is the
   right policy to pursue, but that has  yet  to  be  demonstrated.
   Indeed, one of the remarkable things about firearms  legislation
   in this country is that, not only have its benefits  never  been
   demonstrated, but that the government of  the  day,  throughout,
   has been careful to avoid looking objectively at  the  question.
   There has been a series  of  committees,  operating  in  various
   degrees of secrecy, assuring us and themselves that  the  policy
   being pursued was the correct one, while somehow  neglecting  to
   demonstrate it.

        Blackwell, in 1918, baldly  asserted  that  "hardly  anyone
   could be found to question" the proposition that "the control of
   firearms should be made far more  stringent  than  it  is  now."
   Bodkin, in 1934, said that the Firearms  Act,  1920,  "forms  an
   efficient  system  of  controlling  the  sale  of  firearms  and
   ammunition," but did not  question  the  assertion  and  avoided
   gathering evidence that would have allowed it to be tested.  The
   Green Paper of 1973 merely  accepted  Bodkin's  assumption  that
   controls work, and said that circumstances called  for  more  of
   them.

        With the 1987 White Paper, the Government  appear  to  have
   moved beyond  the  feeling  that  an  increase  in  restrictions
   requires justification. Controls seem to be regarded as  an  end
   in themselves. As one senior  civil  servant  recently  put  it,
   "Controls are good."

        The  Firearms  (Amendment)  Bill  now   before   Parliament
   consists of an enumeration of measures which the officials  find
   congenial. Both they and the ministers are quite open in  saying
   that no research was undertaken and that they could  provide  no
   evidence of probable benefit from and of the  proposals  in  the
   Bill.

        In fact, all but four of the proposals  in  the  1987  Bill
   were lifted from the 1973 Green  Paper.  Greenwood  was  perhaps
   uncharitable but not inaccurate when  he  described  Mr.  Hurd's
   proposals as "emptying Whitehall's rubbish bin into Parliament."
   Parliament rejected the Green Paper  in  1973  for  its  "police
   state" approach and its alleged irrelevance to the  problems  it
   purported to address.

        If it is to be accepted into law fifteen years later,  then
   prudence would dictate that each of its provisions  be  analyzed
   objectively. If this is not done, the likelihood of Parliament's
   enacting sound and equitable law is remote. We shall indeed have
   moved  a   long   way   from   Blackstone's   prescription   of,
   "...restraints in themselves so gentle  and  moderate...that  no
   man of sense or probity would wish to see them slackened."

        There have been two further  enactments  since  1968  which
   must be mentioned for the sake  of  completeness.  The  Criminal
   Justice Act, 1972, increased the penalties for  criminal  misuse
   stipulated in the 1968 Act. The penalty for possessing a firearm
   with intent to endanger life or using a firearm to resist arrest
   was increased from fourteen years to  life  imprisonment,  while
   that for carrying a firearm with intent to commit an  indictable
   offense, or while committing  certain  specified  offenses,  was
   increased from ten and seven  years  respectively,  to  fourteen
   years.

        The Firearms Act, 1982,  was  a  Home  Office  measure  put
   forward as a private member's bill with bipartisan  support.  It
   was  sponsored  Mr.  Eldon  Griffiths  (later  Sir  Eldon),  the
   Parliamentary representative of the Police Federation, with  the
   objective of enacting the proposal in paragraph 121 of the  1973
   Green Paper, banning realistic  replica  or  toy  firearms.  The
   problems of definition,  however,  proved  insuperable  and  the
   bill, when published, related instead to replica firearms  which
   were capable  of  conversion  to  fire  a  shot.  Mr.  Griffiths
   contended that his bill would help to stem, "the rising tide  of
   crime  and  terrorism."  He  was  no  doubt  referring  to   the
   unpublished draft, for no one could recall a  crime,  much  less
   and act of terrorism, committed with a converted replica.

        The law would be better served, and would  command  greater
   respect, if it could be shown to address a problem. One  of  the
   most conspicuous features of firearms legislation in Britain has
   been a persistent refusal to undertake any objective analysis of
   its utility or consequences in terms of social benefit or effect
   on specified mischiefs, either prospectively or retrospectively.

        The danger is twofold. In the first place, if a law  cannot
   be demonstrably justified, those who have thus  far  voluntarily
   complied with it may cease to do  so,  and  will  moreover  find
   their respect for the law  in  general  diminished.  This  is  a
   result that wise government should avoid. In the  second  place,
   if a law is irrelevant, resources committed to enforcing it  are
   at    best    wasted    and    at    worst    counterproductive.

   ****************************************************************
                          A BRIEF CHRONOLOGY
   ****************************************************************

        Several  dozen  statutes  govern   the   possession,   use,
   transport and trade in firearms in  the  United  Kingdom,  often
   quite tangentially. The Cemetary Clauses Act, 1847, for example,
   made it an offence to discharge firearms in  certain  cemetaries
   and  burial  grounds,  except  in  connection  with  a  military
   funeral. The Town Police Clauses Act of the same year  penalizes
   the wanton discharge of firearms in the street to the  annoyance
   of residents or passers by, while the Wildlife  and  Countryside
   Act of 1982 distinguishes, for no readily apparent reason, among
   shotgun action types that  may  be  used  for  game  and  vermin
   species. Then there are the various Game Acts, Deer Acts,  Night
   Poaching Acts and so forth on the one hand, and the Police Acts,
   the International Headquarters and  Defence  Organizations  Act,
   the Gun Barrel Proof Act and Diplomatic Privileges  Act  on  the
   other. One could go on in this vein for many more pages,  and  a
   digest of firearms law, if complete,  would  be  compendious;  a
   case of firearms misuse often attracts charges from a number  of
   statutes.

        The purpose here is merely to give a concise chronology  of
   the  most  important  statutes  relating  to  private   firearms
   ownership. No mention will be made of failed  bills,  peripheral
   acts, war emergency regulations or acts  relating  to  Scotland,
   Ireland or Northern Ireland. The Channel Isles and the  Isle  of
   Man of course have separate legislation. The  1973  Green  Paper
   appears because of its topical significance.

        Those who wish to look more  deeply  into  the  matter  may
   consult: *Gun Law* by  Godfrey  Sandys-Winsch  (London:  Shaw  &
   Sons, 1979, 3rd ed.),  *Firearms  Control*  by  Colin  Greenwood
   (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1972), and *The Law Relating to
   Firearms*  by  P.J.  Clarke   and   John   W.   Ellis   (London:
   Butterworths, 1981).

        GUN LICENSES ACT, 1870 - required anyone wishing  to  carry
   or use a gun elsewhere than in, or within the  curtilege  of,  a

   the Post Office. Strictly a revenue measure. Repealed in 1967.

        PISTOLS ACT, 1903 - Prohibited the retail sale  of  pistols

   either a Gun Licence or Game License (see above), or  reasonable
   proof that the purchaser was a householder intending to use  the
   pistol  within  the  curtilege  of  his  house,  or  a   letter,
   countersigned by a justice of the peace or a police  officer  of
   the rank of inspector or above, that  the  purchaser  was  going
   overseas for a period of not less than  six  months.  Defined  a
   pistol as a firearm with a  barrel  less  than  nine  inches  in

   private sales. Repealed in 1920.

        FIREARMS ACT, 1920 - Established the framework of  controls
   still  in  use.  Enacted  the  recommendations  of  the   secret
   Blackwell Committee report. Fear  of  revolutionary  activity  a
   principal motivation. Made  possession  of  a  rifle  or  pistol
   dependent on a certificate issued by chief constables, who  were
   given  wide  powers  of  discretion.  Dealers  were  subject  to
   registration. There were  exclusions  for  various  professional
   categories. Shotguns, air weapons and antiques excluded.  Appeal
   to Petty Sessions against chief constable's  decision.  Repealed
   1937, except for ss. 16 and 19(1). Incorporated in FIREARMS ACT,
   1937.

        FIREARMS and IMITATION FIREARMS (CRIMINAL USE) ACT, 1933  -

   lawful  arrest  or  detention.  Created  offence  of  being   in
   possession of  a  firearm  or  imitation  firearm  either  while
   committing  or  when  apprehended   for   committing   specified
   offences. Maximum sentence seven years, to be served in addition
   to any sentence for the primary offence. Burden of proof on  the
   defence. Repealed and incorporated into the Firearms Act, 1937.

        FIREARMS ACT, 1934 - Raised the minimum age for  purchasing
   or hiring a firearm from 14 to 17 years and created  appropriate

   recommendations of the Bodkin Committee report  (Cmd  4758:HMSO,
   Dec., 1934,  reprinted  1968).  Shotguns  and  other  smoothbore
   firearms with barrels  less  than  20  inches  made  subject  to
   firearms certificate, as were shotgun  cartridges  with  pellets
   greater than .36" diameter. Machine guns  removed  from  firearm
   certificate control and made subject to Admiralty, Army  Council
   or Air Council authority. Sound moderators  subject  to  firearm
   certificate control. Extensive regulations  concerning  firearms
   dealers. Chief constables empowered to add conditions to firearm
   certificates. Appeals transferred from Petty Sessions to Quarter
   Sessions. Repealed by and incorporated into Firearms Act, 1937.

        FIREARMS ACT, 1937 - Consolidated the four preceding  Acts.
   Repealed by and incorporated into the Firearms Act, 1968.

        AIR GUNS and SHOTGUNS, etc., ACT, 1962 - A private member's
   bill,  introduced  by  Mr.   Brian   Harrison.   Regulated   the

   incorporated into the Firearms Act, 1968, as ss.22-24.

        FIREARMS ACT, 1965 - Intended  as  legislative  prophylaxis
   against an anticipated upsurge in  criminal  violence  following
   the forthcoming abolition of capital  punishment.  Substantially
   increased the penalties for Firearms Act offences.  Created  new
   offences  of  armed  trespass,  possession   of   firearms   and
   ammunition  in  a  public  place,  and  carrying  a  firearm  or
   imitation firearm with intent  to  commit  a  criminal  offence.
   Extended the prohibition  of  firearms  ownership  by  convicted
   persons. Created extensive new regulations for firearms  dealers
   and authorised chief constables to attach conditions to  dealers
   registrations. Minimum length for shotgun barrels increased from
   20" to 24". Absolute prohibition on shortening the barrels of  a
   shotgun to a length less than 24" except by a registered dealer,
   and then only  for  purposes  of  resleeving.  Repealed  by  and
   incorporated into the Firearms Act, 1968.

        CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT, 1967, PART V - Placed  shotguns  with
   barrels of 24" or more under certificate control. Introduced  in
   response to an incident in which police officers were killed  by
   criminals armed with illegal pistols. A shotgun certificate  was
   based on the personal suitability of the applicant and  was  not
   restricted to designated guns. Repealed by and incorporated into
   the Firearms Act, 1968.

   Acts.

        CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT, 1972 - Increased  the  penalties  for
   criminal misuse stipulated in the Firearms Act, 1968.

   Firearms in Great Britain: A Consultive Document. Based  on  the
   secret report of Sir John McKay's working party of  1971-72,  it
   proposed  draconian  restrictive  measures  unsupported  by  any
   verifiable  evidence.  Rejected  by  Parliament.  All  but  four
   clauses of the current Firearms (Amendment) Bill are drawn  from
   the Green Paper.

        FIREARMS ACT,  1982  -  Subjected  to  firearm  certificate
   control  replica   or   imitation   firearms   deeped   "readily
