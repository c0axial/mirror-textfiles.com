                200 million guns can't be ignored

by Tony Mauro

  The USA can no longer ignore guns.
  Until now, it  was easy for a large slice of the nation to grow
up never knowing  about guns, never handling guns, never thinking
about guns.
  Another  part  of  the  nation never  thought  much  about guns
because they were as common as broomsticks ÄÄ part of growing up,
working, playing, serving in the military.
  But today in the USA ÄÄ land  of more than 200 million guns and
12,489 handgun murders last year ÄÄ the issue finally has crossed
the cultural divide.
  A consensus has  formed that something  must be done to  reduce
the  availability  of  guns.  On  every  street  corner,  at  the
workplace, in the classroom.
  It is a consensus formed of fear.
  The longtime lure of  guns in this country has brought  us to a
place  where,  even in  our  mostly  urban society,  half  of all
households contain a gun, where gun and gun crimes have become so
common  that  a new  language has  been  created to  define them:
drive-by shooting, carjacking, street sweepers.
  If  guns have  changed our  vocabulary,  they have  altered our
lives even more.  On New Year's Day, a new  attraction will flick
on in New  York City's Times  Square ÄÄ a "death-clock"  counting
the number of people killed by guns in the USA.
  Wal-Mart, the nation's  largest retailer,  no longer will  sell
handguns over the counter. Midnight Mass  was held hours early in
some churches Christmas Eve because of fear.
  And  guns have  triggered seemingly contradictory  desires: for
more  gun  control ÄÄÄÄ  and  for   more  guns.  Gun  sales   are
skyrocketing,  but  so  are the  poll  numbers  in  favor of  gun
control, hovering close to 90%.
  The  response  of  the  political  system  has  been  similarly
divided. As urgent as the crisis  is, there is still disagreement
over how  we got where we  are with guns ÄÄ and  whether guns are
only a misleading symbol of society's deeper problems.
  "Gun control is  a case where things  almost seem to be  out of
whack," says Everett  Ladd, head of  the Roper Center for  Public
Opinion. It  is very rare, Ladd  says, to find such  clear public
demand for action ÄÄ and so little action to show for it.
  "The public is leading the politicians," he says.
  One example: the  Brady Bill's five-day waiting  period for gun
purchases has had  near-unanimous public support since  1988, but
it was not until this year that Congress passed it.
  The  debate  over guns,  says  Florida State  University's Gary
Kleck,  has always been  a "dialogue of  the deaf" ÄÄ  both sides
certain of their positions, certain the other side is wrong.
  Both sides have been unwilling to listen, until now.
  There is a new sense that a saturation point has been reached:
  .One child is killed with a firearm every six hours.
  .One  handgun is  produced every  20  seconds, and  a handgun
injures someone every 20 seconds.
  .A  suicide by  firearms  takes  place every  28  minutes, 20
seconds.
  .More than one-third of Americans  have [a] friend or relative
who has been shot, recent polls show.
  "Anything else we do is useless  until we get the guns off  the
streets,"  said Boston Mayor Thomas Menino at Monday's funeral of
a boy shot on his way to an anti-gang meeting.
  "All they've got  to do is read  the paper and they  think, 'My
God, there  but for the grace of God  goes me,'" says Sgt. Robert
Hoelscher of  the Metro Dade Police Department  in Miami. "People
feel defenseless."
  The crisis seems sudden to many, but has evolved over more than
two centuries ÄÄ in a country  conceived in revolution, born with
a  skepticism  of  government,  and  carved  out of  a  vast  and
threatening frontier.
  "The great object  is that  every man be  armed," said  Patrick
Henry, the patriot  orator, during debates over  the Constitution
in 1788. "The militia, sir, is  our ultimate safety." That belief
was memorialized in  the Second Amendment,  which figures in  the
debate even today.
  "The nation was born in  violent revolution," says Independence
Institute scholar David  Kopel. "You can't  say from our  history
that violence is always wrong."
  The USA's  beginning gives  context to the  commonness of  guns
today. In many parts  of the country, guns always were  a part of
home life; owning one poses no moral dilemma, teaching a child to
use one, no sin.
  But elsewhere, guns are decidedly foreign objects.

  In the newsroom of USA TODAY,  for example, which prides itself
on drawing its  staff from a cross-section of the  nation, it was
hard to find editors and reporters who had ever pulled a trigger.
In other workplaces,  it would  be difficult to  find anyone  who
hadn't.
  "The real  gulf  between  points of  view  is  geographic,  not
necessarily political," says  Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.  "If you're
from  a rural area or the  far West, your gun  takes on an almost
theological significance."
  How did the  common experience with  guns turn sour in  so many
places? Pick from a host of social trends: rootlessness, drugs, a
detachment from society, media violence, breakup of the family.
  "Why  is it  that  people are  carrying  weapons?" asks  Thomas
Blomberg, professor  of criminology at Florida  State University.
"Why are people able to pull the trigger and shoot someone in the
face and walk  away? We do have  people in this society  who have
nothing to lose."
  Says  the  Rev.  Robert  Drinan,  a Georgetown  law  professor:
"There's a streak of violence among  us that is deep. It's there,
like the Rocky Mountains. No other civilized nation is like us."
  For many young men, new rites of passage have evolved, and they
include guns. "It used to be beer or a cigarette or sex that kids
would use to mark their entry  into to manhood," says sociologist
Edward Peeples  of Virginia Commonwealth University. "Now they've
got to tote  a piece. Our culture is developing new ways of being
a man."
  And as this happened, guns became ever so much more powerful
and available.
  The National Rifle  Association says the proliferation  of guns
saves lives  because they're  used for  self-defense. How  often?
Figures  range  from thousands  of times  a  year to  millions of
times. But many claim availability only adds to the danger.
  "If you have  a family violence situation  ... having a  gun in
the house is like pouring kerosene on the fire," says Paul Mones,
a lawyer who has  defended children accused of murder.  "And what
we've  seen  recently  is  the  proliferation  of  more  powerful
weapons. It's amazing  how much easier it is  to kill people when
you can shoot 15 rounds in seconds."
  Says psychologist  Stanley Samenow,  "A lot  of shootings  that
occur, including domestic  shootings, happen  because you have  a
gun lying around ... Most people get mad,  some people get really
mad but if  they don't have  a gun handy  they handle it  another
way."
  Guns have taken on a new role in society: problem solver.
  "There was a time when conflict would end with people being the
best of friends, and it just doesn't work that way anymore," says
Clementine Barfield  of Detroit, who  founded the group  Save Our
Sons and Daughters after her son, Derrick, was shot and killed at
16.
  The national sense  that guns  have reached a  toxic level  has
given gun control  advocates more hope  than ever that  something
will be done to restrict access to guns.
  In the wake of the passage of the Brady Bill, President Clinton
has asked Attorney  General Janet Reno  to devise a proposal  for
some form of national registration of firearms.
  Reno's  mantra ÄÄ  "It should  be  at least  as hard  to  get a
license  to possess a gun as it is  to drive an automobile" ÄÄ is
meeting less opposition than ever before.
  Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., thinks the time is now.
  "We've got  a real shot at  beginning to make  some progress on
this," Schroeder says. "The public is saying, for the first time,
'It's violence, stupid,' to policy makers."
  But  some fear  the public's resolve  will fade  again. Through
history,  Congress  has enacted  gun  control legislation  almost
every 30 years, with little action in between.
  "We've been up this road before,"  says law professor Drinan, a
former  member of  Congress.  "I remember  thinking in  1981 when
President Reagan was shot and the pope was shot, that now the two
most important people in the world have been shot, something will
happen.
  "And nothing did."
