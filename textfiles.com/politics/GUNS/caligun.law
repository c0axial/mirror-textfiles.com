INTRODUCTION
     This pamphlet contains a general summary of California laws
that govern common possession and use of firearms. It is not
designed to provide individual guidance for specific situations,
nor does it attempt to summarize federal law. The legality of any
specific act of possession or use will ultimately be determined
by applicable federal and state statutory and case law. Persons
having specific questions are encouraged to seek direct legal
advice from a lawyer or to consult their local law enforcement
agency or law library.

     The California Department of Justice and all other public
entities are immune from any liability arising from the drafting,
publication, or dissemination of this pamphlet, or any reliance
upon it. (Penal Code, 12080.)

signed or redesigned for using rimfire or centerfire ammunition).
Firearms manufactured in or before 1898 that use fixed ammunition
and for which ammunition is no longer manufactured in the United
States and is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade are also considered antiques. (Penal Code,
12020(b)(5).)

     This general prohibition also does not include any firearm
or ammunition that is a "curio" or "relic" as defined in section

the Department of Justice may authorize their manufacture, pos-
session, transportation and sale by permit. (Penal Code,

\\Machine Guns\\

     It is unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale,
possess, or knowingly transport any machine gun. (Penal Code,

designed to shoot more than one shot automatically (without
manual reloading) by a single function of the trigger. The term
also includes any frame or receiver of a machine gun and any part
or combination of parts designed and intended for use in convert-
ing an otherwise legal weapon into a machine gun. The term also
includes any weapon deemed by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms as readily convertible to a machine gun
under chapter 53 (commencing with Section 5801) of Title 26 of
the United States Code. (Penal Code, 1 2200.)

     These prohibitions do not apply to persons having a permit
or license issued by the California Department of Justice to
possess, transport, or sell machine guns (Penal Code, 12230,
12231, 12233, 12250) or to federal or state militia or law en-
forcement officers acting within the scope of their duties.

4. THE USE OF FIREARMS IN DEFENSE OF LIFE AND PROPERTY

     The question of whether use of a firearm is justified for
self-defense cannot be reduced to a simple list of factors. This
section is based on the instructions generally given to the jury
in a criminal case where self-defense is claimed and illustrates
the general rules regarding use of firearms in self-defense.

\\Use of a Firearm or Other Deadly Force in Defense of Life and Body\\

     The killing of one person by another may be justifiable when
necessary to resist the attempt to commit a forcible and life-
threatening crime, \provided\ that a reasonable person in the
same situation would believe that: a) the person killed intended
to commit a forcible and life-threatening crime; b) there was
imminent danger of such crime being accomplished; and, c) the
person acted under the belief that such force was necessary to
save himself or herself or another from death or a forcible and
life-threatening crime. Murder, mayhem, rape, and robbery are
examples of forcible and life-threatening crimes.

\\Self-Defense Against Assault\\

     It is lawful for a person being assaulted to defend himself
or herself from attack if he or she has reasonable grounds for
believing, and does in fact believe, that he or she will suffer
bodily injury. In doing so, he or she may use such force, up to
deadly force, as a reasonable person in the same circumstances
would believe necessary to prevent imminent injury

     An assault with fists does not justify use of a deadly
weapon in self-defense unless the person being assaulted be-
lieves, and a reasonable person in the same circumstances would
also believe, that the assault is likely to inflict great bodily
injury.

     It is lawful for a person who has grounds for believing, and
does in fact believe, that bodily injury is about to be inflicted
upon another to protect the victim from attack. In so doing, the
person may use such force as reasonably necessary to prevent the
injury.

     NOTE: The use of \excessive force\ to counter an assault may
result in civil or criminal penalties.

\\Protecting One's Home\\

     A person may defend his or her home against anyone who
attempts to enter in a violent manner intending violence to any   
person in the home. The amount of force that may be used in
resisting such entry is limited to that which would appear neces-
sary to a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances
to resist the violent entry. One is not bound to retreat, even
though a retreat might safely be made. One may resist force with
force, increasing it in proportion to the intruder's persistence
and violence, if the circumstances apparent to the occupant would
cause a reasonable person in the same situation to fear for his
or her safety.

 ************************************************************

CALIFORNIA FIREARMS LAWS 1991 - Page 12

     The occupant may use a firearm when resisting the intruder's
attempt to commit a forcible and life-threatening crime against
anyone in the home \provided\ that a reasonable person in the
same situation would believe that: a) the intruder intends to
commit a forcible and life-threatening crime; b) there is immi-
nent danger of such crime being accomplished; and, c) the occu-
pant acts under the belief that use of a firearm is necessary to
save himself or herself or another from death or great bodily
injury. Murder, mayhem, rape, and robbery are examples of forci-
ble and life-threatening crimes.

     Any person using force intended or likely to cause death or
great bodily injury within his or her residence shall be presumed
to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or
great bodily injury to self, family, or a member of the household
when that force is used against another person, not a member of
the family or household, who unlawfully and forcibly enters or
has unlawfully and forcibly entered the residence and the person
using the force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful
and forcible entry had occurred. Great bodily injury means a
significant or substantial physical injury. (Penal Code,  198.5.)

     NOTE: If the presumption is rebutted by contrary evidence,
the occupant may be criminally liable for an unlawful assault or
homicide.

\\Defense of Property\\

     The lawful occupant of real property has the right to re-
quest a trespasser to leave the premises. If the trespasser does
not do so within a reasonable time, the occupant may use force to
eject the trespasser.

     The amount of force that may be used to eject a trespasser
is limited to that which a reasonable person would believe to be
necessary under the circumstances.

\\Limitations on the Use of Force in Self-Defense\\

     The right of self-defense ceases when there is no further
danger from an assailant. Thus, where a person attacked under   
circumstances initially justifying self-defense renders the at-
tacker incapable of inflicting further injuries, the law of self-
defense ceases and no further force may be used.


     The right of self-defense is not initially available to a
person who assaults another. However, if such person attempts to
stop further combat and clearly informs the adversary of his or
her desire for peace but the opponent nevertheless continues the
fight, the right of self-defense returns and is the same as the
right of any other person being assaulted.

5. CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON

\\Carrying a Concealed Handgun on One's Person or in a Vehicle
without a License\\

     It is unlawful for any person to carry a handgun concealed
upon his or her person or in a vehicle without a license issued
pursuant to Penal Code Section 12050. (Penal Code, 1 2025(a)
(b).)

     A firearm carried openly in a belt or holster is not con-
cealed within the meaning of the above prohibition. (Penal Code,
12025(c).)

     A firearm locked in a motor vehicle's trunk or in a locked
container carried in the vehicle other than in the utility or
glove compartment, is not concealed within the meaning of Penal
Code Section 12025; neither is a firearm carried by a person
directly to or from a motor vehicle for any lawful purpose when
it is carried within a locked container. (Penal Code, 12026. 1 .)

\\Carrying a Loaded Firearm in a Public Place\\

     It is unlawful to carry a loaded handgun or other type of
firearm on one's person or in a vehicle while in any public
place, on any public street, or in any place where it is unlawful
to discharge a firearm. (Penal Code,  12031 (a).)

     A firearm is deemed loaded when there is a live cartridge or
shell in, or attached in any manner to, the firearm, including   
but not limited to the firing chamber, magazine, or clip. A
muzzle-loading firearm is deemed loaded when it is capped or
primed and has a powder charge and ball or shot in the barrel or
cylinder. (Penal Code,  12031 (g).)

     It is a misdemeanor for the driver of any motor vehicle, or
the owner of any motor vehicle irrespective of whether the owner
is occupying the vehicle, to knowingly permit any person to carry
a loaded firearm in the vehicle in violation of Penal Code Sec-
tion 12031 or Fish and Game Code Section 2006. (Penal Code, 
12034.) Also, see Section 10 of this publication for prohibited
acts.

     In order to determine whether a firearm is loaded for the
purpose of enforcing this section, peace officers are authorized
to examine any firearm carried by anyone on his or her person or
in a vehicle while in any public place, on any public street, or
in any prohibited area of an unincorporated territory. Refusal to
allow a peace officer to inspect a firearm pursuant to the provi-
sions of this section is itself grounds for arrest for violation
of this section. (Penal Code,  12031 (e).)

\\Exceptions\\

The prohibition does not apply to:

 * Any person hunting in an area where possession and hunting is
otherwise lawful. (Penal Code,  12031 (i).)

 ************************************************************

CALIFORNIA FIREARMS LAWS 1991 - Page 15

act of making or attempting to make a lawful arrest, provided
such possession is otherwise lawful. (Penal Code, 12031 (k).)

when he or she reasonably believes his or her person or property
is in immediate, grave danger and that the carrying of the loaded
firearm is necessary for preservation of the person or property
during the time interval following notification of the local law
enforcement agency and prior to the arrival of its assistance.
(Penal Code,  12031 a).)

 * Any of the following persons, \provided\ they meet all crite-

 * Uniformed employees of private patrol operators.

     NOTE: Peace officers and honorably retired peace officers
having properly endorsed identification certificates may carry a
concealed weapon at any time. Otherwise, these exemptions apply
only when the firearm is carried within the scope of the exempted
conduct, such as hunting or target shooting, or within the course
and scope of assigned duties, such as an armored vehicle guard
transporting money for his employer. A person who carries a
loaded firearm outside the limits of the applicable exemption is
in violation of the law, notwithstanding his or her possession of
an occupational license or firearms training certificate. (Penal
Code,  12031 (b).)

(a); however, incidents involving persons carrying flareguns as
weapons have been reported.

\\Lawful Possession of a Flaregun\\

     A person may lawfully possess a flaregun aboard any vessel

\\UnlawFul Possession of a Flaregun\\

     Except as provided for in the previous paragraph, it is

     Except as described above, it is unlawful for any person to
carry a loaded flaregun on his or her person or in a vehicle in

year of any number of handguns or irregular and occasional sales
of other firearms. (Penal Code,  12070.)  

     It is unlawful for a person who is not a licensed firearm
dealer to sell or otherwise transfer a firearm to a nonlicensed
person. Nonlicensed sellers or transferors and buyers or trans-
ferees must complete a sale or transfer through a licensed deal-
er. (Penal Code, 12072(d), 12082.)

a firearm to any person who is known to be prohibited pursuant to
Penal Code Section 12021 or 12021.1 or Welfare and Institutions

Requires a 1 5day wait and identification of purchasers of rifles
and shotguns. Persons prohibited by Section 12021 and 12021.1 PC
are prohibited from purchase of any firearm, not just conceal-
ables.

Forbids DOJ from retaining any information on rifle and shotgun
purchasers. To comply with this restriction, DOJ is destroying
the dealers record of sales registers received for rifle and
shotgun purchasers within five (5) days after determining a
purchaser's status.

Requires dealers selling any firearms to obtain a retail firearm
dealer's license from local licensing authorities. Formerly, only
persons selling concealable firearms had to obtain that license.

More people are ineligible for firearm purchase including persons
prohibited from firearm possession as a condition of probation;
juveniles adjudged wards of the court for committing the serious
offenses described in Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions
Code (to age 30); a ten (10) year prohibition for persons con-
victed of specified misdemeanors; a five (5) year prohibition for
persons taken into custody as a danger to self or others and held
for examination of their condition per Section 5150 of the Wel-
fare and Institutions Code. The bill also provides a process for
these persons to petition the superior court of their county for
an order deleting the prohibition. The same provisions apply to
others certified for intensive care under Section 5250, 5260 or
5270.15 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
  
All private party (nondealer) sales must be processed by licensed
firearm dealers. No longer can a person sell any firearm to a
person he or she knows personally. The purpose of this provision
is to prevent abuses of private party sales by having DOJ deter-
mine the eligibility of every firearm purchaser except those
exempted by Section 12078 PC.

Section 12078 PC exempts peace officers and purchasing agents who
present written authorization from the head of their agency from
the usual controls placed on firearm purchasers. AB 497 extended
the exemption from just concealable firearms to all firearms.

The bill requires DOJ to issue gun show licenses to persons
having dealers' licenses and to adopt regulations for the licens-
ing process.

The bill provides a minimum age of 18 years for purchasers of
rifles and shotguns.

AB 497 also requires DOJ to complete a feasibility study of ways
to modernize the firearm purchaser identification process by
considering options such as an 800 phone number concept where
dealers could dial DOJ and obtain an "instant" response on the

eligibility of a purchaser or a credit card concept where persons 
could prequalify and use their card for purchase. DOJ has many 
other tasks to complete by July 1, 1991, when the report is due in 
the legislature.

\OTHER FIREARM BILLS\

AB 36 \\Peace\\

This bill was chaptered on December 13, 1990, as an urgency
provision. Section 12026.2 provides various specific exemptions
from the concealed carrying restrictions of Section 12025 PC. The
bill added another provision specifically for persons transport-
ing a firearm to or from a licensing agency for the purpose of
applying for a concealed firearm license pursuant to Section
12050 PC when done at the request of the licensing agency.

The bill also amended Section 12028 PC which deals with disposal
of nuisance weapons. That Section authorizes law enforcement
agencies to auction confiscated weapons to purchasers who are
licensed under federal law. The bill changed that to persons
licensed under state law, Section 12071 PC.

The bill amended the firearm dealer licensing provision of Sec-
tion 12071 PC by allowing either a regulatory or business license
as options to the license form prescribed by the Attorney Gener-  
al. This should make it easier for applicants to obtain retail
firearm dealer licenses which is especially important for persons
applying for a gun show license pursuant to Section 12071 PC. It
is also very important for persons wishing to bid at auctions of
confiscated weapons pursuant to Section 12028 PC.

It provides for a felony or misdemeanor penalty for a person
violating the restriction against knowingly selling or arming a
person who is prohibited pursuant to Section 12021 or 12021.1 PC.
Formerly, this was a misdemeanor penalty.

The bill amended the exception provisions of Section 12078 PC to
clarify that the firearm dealers' license, described in Section
12070 PC, is not required for manufacturers or importers licensed
under chapter 44 of Title 18 of the US Code who sell, deliver, or
transfer firearms to dealers licensed pursuant to Section 12021
PC.


AB 376 Klehs

Placed multiburst trigger activators on the list of weapons
prohibited by Section 12020 PC. It allows possession prior to
January 1, 1 992 for persons who are not prohibited by Section 1
2021 , 1 2021 .1 or 1 21 01 PC, or Section 81 00 and 81 03 of the
Welfare and Institutions Code. Effective January 1, 1 992, these
devices, which allow semiautomatic firearms to discharge two or
more shots in a burst, will be outlawed and persons found with
them in possession could face felony charges.

AB \\1753 Friedman\\

This bill prohibits persons who are subject to a restraining
order from purchasing or obtaining firearms. To accommodate this
new process, DOJ has established an online database for the
screening of firearm purchasers. Law enforcement agencies enter
information into the database when restraining orders are served
and the database will automatically purge expired orders.

AB 2048 Murray

This bill extended the machine gun permit process administered by
DOJ to include the manufacture of machine guns.

The bill also amended the law pertaining to firearm silencers,
12501 PC, to clarify and extend exemptions. It would allow deal-
ers or manufacturers who are registered under chapter 53 of Title
26 of the US Code to manufacture, possess, transport and sell
silencers to the law enforcement agencies described in Section
830.1 PC, and state and federal military forces for official use.


\\SB 2444 Rogers\\

Added a provision to Section 12276.5 PC, which describes the
process for declaring a firearm to be an assault weapon, requir-
ing the Attorney General to distribute to all law enforcement
agencies in the state a description and photograph of each as-
sault weapon listed in Section 12276 PC and any firearm declared
to be an assault weapon pursuant to Section 12276.5 PC. DOJ is
implementing this new provision by preparing a verbal and photo-
graphic description of each of these assault weapons.


SB \\2480 Rogers

\\This bill added Section 12287 to the Penal Code which author-
izes DOJ to issue permits for the manufacture of assault weapons
to federally licensed manufacturers of firearms for sale to,
purchase by, or possession of assault weapons by specified agen-
cies.


\\SB 2050 Keene

\\Requires firearm purchasers or transferees to provide their
legal name on the dealers record of sale register and any other
legal names or aliases ever used under penalty of a misdemeanor.

Requires the Department of Mental Health to establish a central
file containing information on persons who come within the provi-
sions of Section 8100 and 8103 of the Welfare and Institutions
Code and make those records available to DOJ for firearm and
weapon license and permit purposes.

It requires public and private mental hospitals, sanitariums and
institutions to report information on current and former mental
patients needed by DOJ for firearm purchaser purposes. As re-
quired by the bill, DOJ will keep these records confidential,
separate and apart from other records in the department and will
use them only to screen firearm purchasers.


SB \\2065 Davis

\\Added Section 12025.5 PC, which allows persons to violate the
concealed firearm provisions of Section 1202S PC when a person
has reason to believe he or she is in grave danger because a
restraining order has been issued against a person or persons
found to pose a threat to his or her life or safety. The bill
also amended Section 12031 PC to allow the carrying of a loaded
concealable firearm under these circumstances. The bill further
provides that upon trial for a violation of either 1202S or 12031
PC, the trier of fact must rule whether the defendant indeed
acted out of reasonable belief that he or she was in grave dan-
ger.
