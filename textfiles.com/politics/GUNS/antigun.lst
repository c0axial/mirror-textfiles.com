Membership:	190,000 dues-paying members. HCI claims 1,000,000+ 
members, but this includes contacts by interested parties by any means.

	HCI originated (1974) as the National Council to Control Handguns 
(NCCH), a group which lobbied for government restrictions on the right
to keep and bear arms through support for restrictions on the 
manufacture, importation, sale, transfer, and civilian possession of
handguns. The organization voiced a desire for an eventual handgun ban 
through gradual steps, but changed its name and espoused goals due to
results of a survey. In 1991, HCI amended its Articles of Incorporation
to reflect its support of restrictions on rifles and shotguns as well.

pre-K through 12th grade.  
The CPHV is located at 1400 K Street, N.W., Suite 500,

	The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV), was originally formed in
1975 as the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH) "for the purposes
of banning the importation, manufacture, sale, transfer, ownership 
and possession of handguns." In 1989, after expanding its efforts to 
include restrictions on all firearms, the group adopted its new name,
Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

	The United Methodist Church was the principle founder of CSGV.  CSGV's
membership is comprised of individual supporters.  Ex-CIA employee, 
Edward O. Welles, who also helped to form HCI, was an original NCBH 
board member and, reportedly, NCCH/HCI was an unreported member of the
Coalition for several years.
	CSGV's policy-making membership is comprised of 34 national 
organizations including:

American Association of Suicidology

	Incorporated in 1978 as an "educational" spin-off to the Coalition to

	The Violence Policy Center is the new name of the New Right Watch 
(NRW), a non-profit group that "researched" what it perceived as a 
new right-wing American political movement.  NRW focused its attack 
on semi-automatic firearms with two releases:  Assault Weapons and 
Accessories in America (1988), a joint effort with EFEHV, and Assault
Weapons:  Analysis, New Research, and Legislation (1989).  Funding for
New Right Watch was received from individual and foundation grants.

	VPC is a non-profit national "educational" foundation that proposes 
firearms restrictions as measures to reduce violence in America.  VPC's
Executive Director, Josh Sugarmann, formerly the Executive Director of 
the New Right Watch and, previously, with the National Coalition to Ban
Handguns, is the author of a new book attacking the NRA, NRA: Money,
Firepower, and Fear (1992).
