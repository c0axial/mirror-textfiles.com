°°    °°    narchy is not being used in its proper form. Hundreds maybe even
            thousands of people are using Anarchy as an excuse to vandalize
  personal property of nice working and Lower-Middle class people. When 
  people claming to be anarchists run around and do personal damage people 
  get mad and become aginst the movement. This does not, as you may have 
  guessed, help us in the slightest bit. Anarchy is not a part time job. It 
  is a way of life. It is understood that only the mentaly strong support it, 
  Because if you are not strong in an anarchist socity, you will not survive. 
  This is also called Nihlism. The survival of the fitist. If you want to turn 
  heads our way, You have to help people in the name of anarchy. Sounds hard 
  huh? Well, It has to be. If you want support you have to earn it.

 Q: Is it not true that Anarchy is no government? Isnt that a contradiction? 
 A: Well that it is not true, Anarchism is a movement.

 Q: How is it possible to have no rules, and no laws?
 A: The basis of anarchy is that every one can get along and not cause any 
    shit so there wont be a need for laws.

 Q: What about the weak people?
 A: They will adapt or die.

 Q: Wont there be nothing but CHAOS?
 A: Maby at first. But to be a true Anarchist Socity there will be only peace.

 Q: Why cant i beat up mail boxes with baseball bats, and burn down my next 
    door neighbors garage?
 A: Because asshole, Our fight is with the government, Not its mind fucked 
    people. It isn't their fault they only know what the government wants them
    to know. That is why it is our job to inform them, And if they don't want
    to listen, some day they may change their minds if you never fucked them
    up.

 Q: Abigwar, You write files on vandalism. Arn't you a hipocrit?
 A: No, Because I don't relate vandalism and pranks with anarchy. I am not 
    saying that vandalism and pranks are bad. Just that they are not Anarchism.
 
 Q: What ever inspired you to write this file?
 A: I D/Led a file called AANON4.ZIP.. And its not that i didn't like it. It
    is just that the way they represnet anarchy. Anarchist Anymous seems to 
    be a good group, But they could fuck up anarchism more than it already is.

 Q: Are you afraid that you might offend AA with that last Q/A?
 A: I am not out to offend them. But i am not going to apologize for saying
    that either. Besides they seem tough. Im sure some positive critisism
    wont hurt them to much. And if i get blacklisted by them and all their 
    boards, in my heart i know i did what is right. They may call me a lamer
    but it would only prove there own ignorance if they do.

 Q: Is it true you are a skinhead or is it just a rumor.
 A: Its true. And arn't we a little of topic?

 Q: What is your faviort terminal program?
 A: Shut the fuck up man.. We are talking about Anarchism.

 Q: I am kindof new to the computer underground scene, But i have been a 
    supporter of true anarchism for years, When i try to support it, HPers
    jump in and call me a lamer... Why?
 A: Ignorance in my opinion. They where taught wrong, so they belive it is
    diffrent. You where write to stand up for what you belive in. Some day 
    they will learn. You'll see.
