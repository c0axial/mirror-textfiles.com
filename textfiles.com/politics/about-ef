General Information about the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
************************************************************************ 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was founded in July, 1990, 
to assure freedom of expression in digital media, with a particular 
emphasis on applying the principles embodied in the Constitution 
and the Bill of Rights to computer-based communication. 

>From the beginning, EFF was determined to become an organization 
that would combine technical, legal and public policy expertise, and 
would apply these skills to the myriad issues and concerns that arise 
whenever a new communications medium is born.

By remaining faithful to this initial vision, EFF has become an 
organized voice for the burgeoning community of nationally and 
inter- nationally networked computer users. We perform the 
multiple roles of guardian, advocate and innovator, to serve and 
protect the public interest in the information age.

We have defended civil liberties in court. We have shaped the policy 
debate on emerging communications infrastructure and regulation. 
We have increased awareness both on the Net and among those law 
enforcement officials, policy makers and corporations whose 
insufficient under- standing of the digital environment threatened 
the freedom of Cyberspace. Yet there is still much to be done.

Goals of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 1993 

EFF's mission is to understand the opportunities and challenges of 
digital communications, in order to foster openness, individual 
freedom and community.

We expect to carry out our mission through activities in the following 
areas:

POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY. EFF has been working to 
promote an open architecture for telecommunications by various 
means, including the Open Platform Initiative, the fight against the 
FBI's Digital Telephony wiretap proposal, and efforts to free robust 
encryption technologies from NSA control.

FOSTERING COMMUNITY. Much of the work we have done has been 
directed at fostering a sense of community in the online world. 
Because we realize that we know far less about the conditions 
conducive to the formation of virtual communities than is necessary 
to be effective in creating them, we will devote a large portion of our 
R & D resources to developing better understanding in this area.

LEGAL SERVICES. EFF was born to defend the rights of computer 
users against overzealous and uninformed law enforcement officials. 
This continues to be an important focus of EFF's work. We provide 
legal information to individuals who request it and support for 
attorneys who are litigating. We maintain print and online legal 
archives, disseminate this information, and make it available for 
downloading. Our board and staff are continuously engaged in 
writing and speaking about these issues. 

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT. We have started many projects over the 
years as their need became apparent. Going forward, EFF will allocate 
resources to investigate and initiate new projects. To ensure that our 
projects have the greatest impact and can reasonably be completed 
with the resources available, EFF will sharpen its selection and 
review process. 

Structure of EFF

EFF currently maintains offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and 
Washington, D.C. In June, all operations will be consolidated into our 
Washington office.

EFF's Cambridge office currently deals with member services, some 
legal services and our online communications. The Cambridge office 
also maintains the central library and our main computing facilities, 
including our Internet site, eff.org, which hosts our mailing lists; 
ftp.eff.org, home of our anonymous ftp archives; and our Gopher 
server, which enables users to locate and download files using the 
Gopher client program. 

EFF's Washington office is charged with policy-making, coalition 
building, forming congressional liaisons, and the administration of 
the Communications Policy Forum. EFF's legal services and 
publications functions are also coordinated out of Washington. 

EFF is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization. We are an operating 
foundation and do not make grants. EFF is a membership 
organization with both individual and corporate members from 
throughout the United States and the world.

                         How to Connect to the EFF

Internet and USENET:

General information requests, submissions for EFFector Online, and 
the like can be mailed to eff@eff.org.

If you receive any USENET newsgroups, your site may carry the 
newsgroups comp.org.eff.news and comp.org.eff.talk. The former is a 
moderated newsgroup for announcements, newsletters, and other 
information; the latter is an unmoderated discussion group for 
discussing the EFF and issue relating to the electronic frontier.

For those unable to read the newsgroups, there are redistributions 
via electronic mail.  Send requests to be added to or dropped from 
the eff-news mailing list to eff-request@eff.org.

Mail eff-talk-request@eff.org to be added to a redistribution of 
comp.org.eff.talk by mail; please note that it can be extremely high-
volume at times.

A document library containing all of the EFF news releases, John 
Barlow's "Crime and Puzzlement", and other publications of interest is 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.eff.org. Mail ftphelp@eff.org if 
you have questions, or are unable to use FTP.

To be on a mailing list specific to a discussion of technical and policy 
pub-infra-request@eff.org.

The WELL:

There is an active EFF conference on the WELL, as well as many other 
related conferences of interest to EFF supporters. Access to the WELL 
is $15/month plus $2/hour. Outside the San Francisco area, telecom 
access for $4.50/hour is available through the CompuServe Packet 
Network. If you have an Internet connection, you can reach the 
WELL via telnet at well.sf.ca.us; otherwise, dial 415 332 6106 (data).  
The WELL's voice number is 415 332 4335.

CompuServe:

Our forum on CompuServe has also opened recently. GO EFFSIG to 
join. Many of the files on ftp.eff.org, as well as other items of interest, 
are mirrored in the EFFSIG Libraries.

America Online

EFF is planning to host its own area on AOL.  Cliff Figallo (Fig on AOL) 
is coordinating the creation of this area.  A selection of EFF 
information files already exists in the Awakened Eye Sig which is 
also in the MCM Forum.
