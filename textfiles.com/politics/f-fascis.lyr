
  Consolidated - Friendly Fascism

         Brutal Equation

         Yo Pistel, activate the bass. One fnal rime make a beat for a
society in decline. Those who want us suppressed will ay to make this my
last repon, but it won't be cut shon. You need to know why this project
failed why the forces oi weakness prevailed. And that we're all trapped in
this vicious cycle. I get on the phone to my friend Michael, his theory's
called Hiphoprisy. Oun is based on the culture industry. Keeping the
public distracted. Paralyzing the artists' Potential impact. While the
fascist elite accumulate all the wealth. And me and my posse sit and
ponder our heslth. Which is failing. Just like our career. But at that
moment our hardness has never been so severe. You can see our career going
down the toilet. \o industry slime is going to spoil it. Then you won't
question my convictions. You'll know music's a contradiction. Where
everybody loses no win situation. Brutal equation. I used to be young like
you but look where that got me. Blink once and now I got a family that I
can't provide for. Get no support fascists shoot us down for sport. Living
hands to mouth on welfare that's absurd, none can sustain this. Your
living condition is unacceptable. You got to make a value change
Fundamental. Wake up and exhibit some maturity. That still don't give you
no job sccurity. You can say "What do you do?"I can tell your whole life
is collapsing around. Don't tell me you're anxiety ridden. I know the
symptoms; the pain is still hidden. Looking at a world of alienation with
no explanation. Brual equation. People! This ain't no job, it's a missinn.
And we don't give a fuck about recognition. They can't censor us with
their threats and psychological war of attrition. Being a commodity is
weak. But it might be our last chance to speak,. Try to get a simple point
across but too often the message is lost. Meanwhile, the industry
continues to grind out the cheeu whiz. if that ain't censorship, I don't
know what is. What can you do when you're too old and too Caucasian?
Brutal equation. This is why your family will starve. Can't pay the rent
so die in your ride. Lose your credibility and clout. Too much self doubt
to get out. What are you going to do to change this violent situation? I
don't know. Brual equation. Anyone can turn politics into exchange. The
point hnwever is to change. We don't play that female degradation. We
won't buy into that exploitation. \ot to get our record played on some
radio station. Word. Brual equation.

         Unity of Oppression

         The history ofoppression. You know we can't erase it in a pop
song but the facts we gotta face it. Men rape women and man rapes the
environment. And people with opposed religious views are violent. How can
we advance with a memory so short. We live in a society that kills animals
for sport. How can we dixuss gender, class, or race when we can't respect
the rights of lesbians and gays. In our efforts to make a difference we
specialize but the contradiction arise we fail to realize the damages done
to the native American singular issues I just don't understand how you can
love one and have hatred for annther you torture your sisters while saying
peace to your brothers. As long as we insist on being so aggressive, we
wili continue to play the role ofthe oppressor. When men and women,
straight and gay, whites and non-whites begin to unite when humans can
treat non-human species with fairness and dignity, then only then is there
unity, of oppression. Gotta understand the concept of unity. A sacrifce
for the price of unity. To all the white liberals and non-white militants
that over-simplify the impact of prejudice. Blame it on the whites and
you're right but it keeps us divided that agenda becomes short sighted. I
hear you condemning all racist sentiments and then I hear you making
anti-Semetic comments. Instead ofallowing only one type ofequality. Place
the blame on each other we should be expanding our scope of understanding
and hope posing some questions and make some suggestions. We don't claim
to speak from a position of authority, we only want one thing and that's
unity of oppression.

         The Sexual Politics of Meat

         The Sexual Politics of Meat
         Eating animals acts as mere and representation of patriarchal
values. Meat eating is the re-inscription of male power at every meal. The
patriarchal gaze sees not the fragmented Besh of dead animals but
appetizing food. Vegearian activities counter patriarchal consumption and
challenge the consumption of death. Feminist Vegetarian activity declares
that an alternative world view exists, one which celebrates life rather
than consuming death, one which does not rely on resurrected animals but
empowered people. If meat is a symbol of male dominance then the presence
of meat proclaims the disempowering of women. It takes the notion of
objectifcation one step further not only have we objectified anim%ls but
in objectifying them we take what we want from them and leave the rest out
we leave their death out and we take their bodies we leave images of their
death out but take the meaning of meat and apply it to women. The sexual
politics of meat. We need not choose between one liberation cause and the
other women's rights and animal rights sufTer a common oppression: a
patriarchal world. Male dominance attacks feminism, they say we are bra
burners, they say we are house wreckers, they say we are man-haters. Human
dominance attacks animal rights they say we are terrorists, they say we
are people haters. The sexual politics of meat.

         Typical Male

         Typical male thinks with his dick. The continuing saga of male
controi and domination of psycho-sexual and economic manipulation in our
society. The historical male condition is one of deceptive coercion and
violence and the woman's fate is too often one ofresignation and silence.
The typical male thinks with his dick. That's how he rationalizes shallow
sexual conquest as a means of self expression and fulflment in a world of
alienation and emptiness under modern capitalism. However, the typical
male considers a similarly promiscuous woman a whore, a slut, or a skeez.
The typical male likes a submissive woman, one wh 's into shallow sexual
experience but who's not demanding. A woman who demands respect or demands
commitment in a relationship is often facing rejection by the typical
male. Hiswrically, some of the characteristics of the typical male are as
follows: There is the stereotypical brutal, assaulting, barbaric male.

         The one who's obsessed with violence. The one we see in Hollywood
movies and are most accustomed to. We also have what is known as the
sensitive rapist. The one who wants to feel like there's a mutual
understanding before he entraps the woman in a cycle of co-dependent
sexual service. Then there's the pseudo feminist, who may be committed to
a woman. He may even be involved in the women's movement, but still
oppresses by including his own self serving patriarchal agenda in thc
situation. tle may be from any racial or class background. From any
religious or sexual orientation. All ofthese characteristics may and often
do overlap thereby adding a deceptively complex dimension w the typical
male analysis. The typical male listens to a woman from the position
ofdominance or privilege. What that mcans to the woman is that the typical
malc does not listen. The typical male conditions women to blame
themaelves for a failing relationship or for male infidelity. The typical
male enslaves women in the working pl%ce aa well. Forcing women to
tolerate sexual harassment in exchange for unequal compensation and
status. The typical male is a reactionary, conservative, a Klansman
standing in Operation Rescue picket lines. The typical male is also a
liberal. He supports pro-choice. Why not? He impregnates women and can't
deal with the consequences of parenthood. In a society where the incidence
of rape and sexual assault are staggering, the typical male will still
say, "lf she don't want to get pregnant she shouldn't spread her legs." In
the US alonc, where four women a day are killed by men, and every eighteen
seconds a woman is battered, the typical male still fnd misogynistic music
and comedy appropri%te. In a potentially sexual situation the typical male
cannot act responsibly. The typical male thinks "no means yes."



         Dominion

         Meat is good and if you don't like America go live in Russia.
Good comment, you'll make the next record for sure. OK why is meat good?
Meat is good because, well. Apparently y'all are saying, you seem to be
making this radical statement. Radicalism is in, let's get against this,
everybody together, dumb American mentality, OK that's what 1 just got out
of this, well now the new trend is let's be a vegetarian let's be a little
hippychick, Peace love all this shit. Well that's just another way of
following a trend. The Lord God said thou shalt have dominion over the
animals of the eaah he didn't say say thou shalt have dominion over a big
wad of tofu. He also said the men shall have dominion over the women. so
do you believe that, do you huy that line too? (You goddamn right) Thank
you Zero, you're on the next record already. What do you think about that?
I'm serious. It depends on how you interpret it. Ah it sure does. You
interpret dominion as domination? Dominion gives you a right to do what
you want. \o dominion actually means stewardship which actually means
companionship and working tugether, dominion does not mean domination. I
just want to say - why do you think - being a vegetarian is a trend and
meat eating is not a bigger trend to follow. I just want to say one thing
anyone who quotes the bible - that's bullshit I'm sorry, because the bible
is a book that has fucked up the world more than any other single book. A
book that was written by a bunch of male chauvinists. Fine, fine, you have
your opinion and I have mine, you're going to hell and I'm not. Have a
nice life. I'm gonna go to hell with the lid off that's defnitely true,
eh. You've been brain washed into following a male dominated violent trend
and that's eating and killing animals. I don't understand why our
aggression is bad but the aggression of a man like Saddam Hussien is
conscionable. I also don't understand why you can come up here and say
that we are wrong in defending your right to come up here and say what you
want, that's fne I got no problem with that I get paid to do it everyday.
I'm going to the Gulf, a lot ofmy friends are already there...I'm going to
the Gulfso you guys can do this, I'm going to the Gulfyou guys can get the
oil to travel, I'm going to the Gulf so you guys can afford to play your
shows. So, I think you guys are hypocrites and I'd like you to defend
yourselves. Did we not learn something in Vietnam, did we not learn that
it was not a complete waste of human lives, and time and resources? I
don't think we should be there. What we need to do - wait...I'm answering
his question - WE NEED TO FIND ALTERNATlVES TO WAR! Send somebody over...

         Meat Kills

         The driving force behind the destruction of the tropical rain
forests is the American meat habit. The rain forests are cleared then
planted with grass for grazing livestock to create hamburger for fast food
restaurants. More than half of all the water used in the United States is
used for raising animals for food. 25 gallons of water is needed to
produce a pound ofwheat. 2500 gallons ofwater is needed to produce a pound
ofmeat. Dependence on foreign oil is one ofthe principle reasons for CS
intervention in the Persian Gulf. The length of time the world's oil
reserves would last if all humnn beings ate a meat based diet would be
approximately 13 years. The length oftime the world's oil reserves would
last if all human beings ate a plant based diet would be approximately 260
years. Feedlots and slaughterhouses are both major polluters of rivers and
streams. Filling them with poisonous residues and animal wastes. 250,000
pounds of animal excrement is produced every second in the CS and there
are no sewage systems to treat the wastes. In l989, over 40% of the
world's grain harvest was fed to animals going to slaughter. If the same
grain was fed directly to human beings, there would be more than enough
grain to feed the entire world. Over ZD million people will die as a
result of malnutrition this ytar. In thc third worid private and
government money has gone to developing cash crops for export while food
production for the poor majority is neglected. 80% of the corn grown in
the CS is fed ro animals raised for food rather than going to hungry
people. On a purely vegetarian diet the world can support a population
many times its present size. On a meat based diet the current world
population could not be sustained. Cattle ranching has always competed
with wildlife. Coyotes and wolves would not be shot and poisoned by
ranchers if people did not eat steak and lambchops. Destroying the
rainforests to raise cattle is causing millions of birds, monkeys, snakes
and other species to lose their homes and lives. In the US this year alone
thirty seven and one half million cattle, eighty fve and one half million
pigs, five and one half million sheep, two hundred forty two million
turkeys, four billion, une hundred fony seven million chickens will be
murdered for thc taste of their Resh. Pain, frustration, stress, fear,
abuse, neglect, and deprivation are realities of the raising of animals in
today's factory farms. Animals are artiFcially inseminated, fed growth
hormones, overcrowded, chained and caged. Raising livestock for profit is
a competitive business. Being humane means costs will go up. These animals
are kicked, prodded, electroshocked, dragged, and finally transported to
their deaths. A vegetarian diet promotes superior health, endurance, and
longevity. Animal products have 3 nutritional disadvantages. They contain
too much protein, too much fat, and no fber. Do not believe the protein
myth. It was based on a study done by the meat and dairy industries to
rats, animals who need 1000 times more protein in their diet than humans.

         Stoned

         We live in America in the 90's. We get no fulfliment except from
commodities. Why is it we derive no satisfaction from things based on
human interaction? When there's no reality, there's nothing to escape
from. If it makes you stupid you've got to have some. Doesn't matter if
you stick it in your hole or smoke it in a bowl. America you know you're
so stoned. Stoned on television, music, and print. Stoned on alcohol,
religion, and drugs. Terms like freedom and democracy. Stoned on violence
and a war economy. Stoned on a nation's addiction to meat. Stoned on a
nation's addiction to oil. America is based out of its mind.



         Friendly Fascism

         Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen to the end of the twentieth century
and the arrival of friendly fascism. Regrettably, millions will die as
before. But just think of the tremendous selection and savings you'll
gain. Of course the loss of freedom and democracy are tragedies, I know,
but consider the enterainment value contained within and to remind you, it
is you, the people, who have mandated this course of our fate so please
come with me...l.ook at the new face of power in America. This is your
future you can never leave. Who said tyranny can't be fun? Ftiendly
fascism having so much fun, what else do you need? You'll learn to like
what you must do. Ifyou resist you are suppressed. You are told who to
fght and when by Bush the Nazi Fascist Friend. Alienating technology wipes
out our sense ofcommunity. Millions will die just like before. We
disconnect and start the war. We make life a commodity. We turn animals
into machines. Kinder and gentler slaughter house. Big business and big
government distract us with entertainment. They manufacture our consent
while we destroy the environment.

         College Radio

         College Radio, you make me feel so different now and even though
during the day you're a stock broker but at night we read french symbolist
poetry. Oh girl together we can change the worid or at least the music
industry. Alternative, progressive. the cutting edge. And girl with you I
feel so safe and liberal and you could never be a fascist I know College
Radio you wouldn't lie to me and turn out to be a top forty station that's
been bought by the major labels...? Yeah. Ycah. Yeah. College Radio.

         We Gotta Have Peace

         America #1 is a lie still, How many innocent people are killed?
Do our soldiers believe in the fascism? No, they couldn't get a job, so
they had to go get ground up in Bush's war machine. What the fuck do the
polls on TV mean? We won't give our consent to blow up foreign soil, no
blood for oil.

         Chorus:

         War, what is it good for? Nothing, Absolutely nothing. Nothing
from nothing leaves nothing. You've gotta have something. You gotta have
peace. January 15, I99I, the deadline Curious George gave Saddam Hussein
to evacuate his troops from Kuwait...Ah. yes Curious Ceorge Bush, the same
Curious George that vetoed the civil rights bili, ironic enough the birth
date of Dr. Martin Luther King, the drum major for peace. War is not the
answer. I don't understand it, it makes my blood boil on foreign soil,
trading blood for oil. How many heroes will there be from this war, what
ehe heil are we really fghting for? Why in the hell should I serve my time
for SAM when SAM don't givc a damnl Here's an opportunity for peace and
unit.y. Cease fre in the middle East, it's time to increase peace. The
ISth ofa new decade, midnight even though I prayed. There's a war goin' on
across the sea. it's not a war for Democracy. Crusading Rap Cuys

         Oh no here they come again whining and complaining about the sate
of the world. They're criticizing everything where else could they go and
get away with saying these things? They're always on their soapbox telling
us things we already know. Life is hard enough and we don't want this
serious shit. We just want to party. We just want to have a good time.
Nauseating middle class white guys in a political band. Annoying commie
sympathizing feminist vegearians. They're hypocrites and liberals and
worst of all they're on a major label. All of you crusading rap guys
you're such a downer. They say they don't like censorship but they won't
let us slam dance at their shows.

         White American Male `91 (The truth hurts) Part 2

         I'm a white guy.

         Music Has No Meaning

         Today in the West, of the many criais we face, critical is the
nature of the Culture Industry's monopolistic conaol over our expressive
domain. The interests that control the state have effectively neutralized
any mode of public expression that in the past we have found empowering
Along this course the nature of music itself has become twisted, alured,
distorted to suit the needs ofcapital. If we want music to conain any
positive revelance to us again, we must ake it back. Until then it ain't
jack, hit it, that music has no meaning. No value. No power. Minus one.
Zero. Our tastes have become so standardized and regulated that we no
longer make any choices for ourselves, the Culture Industry does all this
for us. We've become a nation of blindly accepting consumers, latching on
to meaningless terms like "alternative," "progressive," "industrial"
"techno," "rap," "house." We're promised liberation but all we get is
empty distraction. In our society music is just a measure of forced
consumption. Cntil we change the social conditions under which music is
made that music has no meaning No value. No power. Minus one. Zero. What
can we do about it? In the 90's as Big Business and Big Government realiu
that they needn't demonstrate any longer the intimidation and violent
suppression of past authoritarian states, they prove conclusively that
friendly fascism clearly exists in this society and the rulers of
Corporate America have manufactured within its own pcople an addiction to
pop culture so strong it renders us incapable of any action as individual
or collective citizens and the real tragedy is that we have no problem
with this. Every fascist era has its giant spectacles to keep the people
pacifed. With us it's just the MTV Video Music Awarda and the Grammy's. As
long as we're willing to go on just passively marching and singing then we
know that music has no meaning.
