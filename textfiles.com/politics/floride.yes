        SWORN STATEMENT BY FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBER

To Whom it May Concern:

	I, Oliver Kenneth Goff, was a member of the Communist Party and the 
Young Communist League, from May 2, 1936, to October 9,1939. During this 
period of time, I operated under the alias of John Kreats and the number 
18-13-2. My testimony before the Government is incorporated in Volumn 9 of 
the Un-American Activities Reports for the year 1939.
	
	White a member of the Communist Party, I attend Communist underground 
training schools outside the City of New York; in the Bues Hall, and 113 East 
Wells Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The East Wells Street Schools operated 
under the name of the Eugene Debs School. Here,under the tutoring of Eugene 
Dennis, M. Sparks, Morris Childs, Jack Kling and others, we were schooled in 
the art of revolutionary overthrow of the established Government.

	We were trained on how to dismantle and assemble mimeograph machines,
to use for propaganda purpose during the revolution; how to work on guide 
wires and fuel lines of airplanes so that they would either burst into flames 
or crash to the ground because of lack of control; how to work on ties and 
rails to wreck trains; and also the art of poisoning water supplies.

	We discussed quite thoroughly the floridation of water supplies and 
how we were using it in Russia as a tranquilizer in the prison camps. The 
leaders of our school felt that if it could be induced into the American 
water supply, if would bring about a spirit of lethargy in the nation; 
where it would keep the general public docile during a steady encroachment 
of Communism. We also discussed the fact that keeping a store of deadly 
floride near the water reservoir would be advantageous during the time of 
the revolution as it would give us opportunity to dump this poison into the 
water supply and either kill off the populace or threaten them with 
liquidation, so that they would surrender to obtain fresh water.

	We discussed in these schools, the complete art of revolution; the 
seizure of the main utiilties, such as light, power, gas and water;but it was 
felt by the leadership, that if a program of fluoridating of the water could 
be carried out in the nation, it would go a long way toward the advancement 
of the revolution.

	The above statements are true.
