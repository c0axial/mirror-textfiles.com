The Ultimate society - The Quest for a Lost America
by Howard C. Miller

America was once a golden promise of freedom for those who would
flee from places of slavery anddictatorship.   Have we abused or
misued our freedom, or even given it a false image?  Even today,
in the modern American society, prejudice, racism and hatred are
to be found everywhere.  Is this truly a civilized land we live in,
when we review some of the true wrongs of our society?  We
certainly have been given far more freedom and rights than any
other country has ever known, but from what I see, I wonder if we
deserve them.  Perhaps we do, or perhaps not all of us do.

One major problem is the way the government totally misuses the
political system.  Another major problem is the mass communications
area, which can and often does give a narrowminded and biased view
of the subject they are referring to.  And possibly the most
serious of these problems is our education in the public schools
of America  This is partly the fault of the government.

Since it looks probable that we cannot change the ways of the
people who are in command today as responsible adults, when
referring to those past thei fourth decade of life, we must teach
our children better and more.  To do this, it is important to press
the government to make more funds available to the education system
and other necessary social programs.

But money alone won't help.  The education system must be totally
revised to give the maximum amount of information on all sides, not
a diluted viewpoint of the subject at hand to be later expanded by
college education, if the person in question decides to have such
higher learning.

I feel we could learn a good deal from the Japanese social
structure today.  Japan is a rich country, and its students are
motivated and encouraged to learn so well, that b the time they are
entering their early twenties, the're already working towards their
Ph.D!  I think, in my opinon, Japan's government and social
structure outclasses the America one in many ways.

Too much of the southeastern states are still undereducated,
prejudiced and so forth.  They are in serious need of help from the
north and southwest states to solve this problem.  

But even in the north, racism and prejudice run rampant  Prejudice
is ugly and must be fought against, no matter what form it takes,
because it is simply wrong, intended or not.

Let us make 1990 the Year of Equal Treatment and Rights For All. 
Let us make it also the Year of Services for those who need it. 
Because, when we get right down to the simple cold and logical fact
that we are all humans, regardless of our shape, size and color,
it will be a better world for us all.  A rose is a rose, whether
it is red, white or yellow.  A cat is a cat, whether it be a lion,
tiger, panther, cheetah or house pet.  Whether a rose is missing
a petal or not, it is still a rose.  Whether a cat is missing a leg
or not, it is still a cat.
