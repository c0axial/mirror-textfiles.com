So that's what ten years of running a website is like! Pretty cool, if you ask me. From my humble
days in the beginnings of the home computer revolution to standing in front of hundreds and talking
about this passion of mine, I've had a great time. The site is running well, the history is brought
to a new generation, and the generation that grew up with these files are living those days again.
<p>
I've had people write me and tell me that they started using the web in 2000 and that now, in 2008,
they find themselves inspired by my site to go into a field of study. The fact that I would have 
something online for all of a person's computing life blows my mind. It's a point of pride, to be
this dependable thing, for so many, across all this time. It has been a privilege, it has been an
honor.
<p>
Thank you, every one of you.
