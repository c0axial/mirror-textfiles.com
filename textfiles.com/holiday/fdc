HYSTERIA
=-=-=-=-
  by Bud Leroy

It's been seventy years ago today
That a hundred thousand were swept away
By governmental involvement in moral cause,
[The wheels of justice ground without pause!]
Prohibition..! Prohibition..! was the ringing cry.
Thousands imprisoned, but did they really know why?
In the battlefields of moral right,
When the righteously indignant picked up the right,
A confused and battered people was all that remained
As once again, hysteria reigned.

It's been fifty year ago today
That a massive genocide was underway.
Branded by race or color of eyes,
[Stricken forever from beneath the skies!]
Jew..!  Jew..!  was the propaganda cry.
That was all that was needed for millions to die.
A confused and battered people was all that remained
As once again, hysteria reigned.

It's been forty years ago today
That, depending on your political sway,
A communist traitor you were called.
[The morally righteous were so appalled!]
Politically motivated from the start,
So many lives ruined and torn apart.
A minor congressman was all that was needed
To dig down to hatred and get it seeded.
A confused and battered people was all that remained
As once again, hysteria reigned.

Here we all stand, once again on the brink...
Put your nose to the wind and you'll pick up the stink.
The morally righteous are starting to breed.
[It's not education we want, it's more prisons we need!]
And we are all but pawns in the grand charade;
The homework's been done, the ticket's been paid.
The propagandists are rolling, picking up the fight,
But most of us really know what's wrong or right.
Punishment is needed but it has its place.
Teaching is the key to saving our race,
So in years to come, we won't have to explain
To our children, once again, how hysteria reigned.
