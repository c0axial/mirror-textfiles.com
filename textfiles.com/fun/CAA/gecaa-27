     GEnie subscriber S.PONTIN in Rochester writes:  "Many of us in the less

temperate zones wonder when you'll be leaving the exotic climes of the West

coast to embark on the REAL adventure, the soul- destroying adventure that

ensues when you cross over into the the desert.  After all, any of us can have

good time in Palo Alto..."



     But Simon... we HAVE been roughing it!  Why, just yesterday we were

sprayed with cold salt water as we danced in a 34-foot sailboat across the

violent, whitecapped surface of San Francisco Bay.  There were moments of

terror as the deck dipped into rushing froth -- as the women screamed and the

captain intoned "It's under control... it's under control" like a reassuring

litany while Angel Island passed to starboard.



     Yes, we're roughing it alright.  Later, in the hot tub, we found the water

at the bottom chilly -- in sharp contrast to the steaming dark liquid that

first lured the three of us in, Maggie and Laura and me.  Soft wrestling in the

murky depths, the two of them ganging up on me, tickling me, taking advantage

of my exhaustion...



     So you think this is an easy life, here in Palo Alto?  Why, it fairly

reeks of challenge, risk, and high adventure!  My electronic calendar is

crammed to capacity with fearless assaults on high-tech pinnacles (subtly

camouflaged as speaking engagements):  Hewlett- Packard.  Apple.  Sun.

Intellicorp.  All-nighters of software-hacking alternate with those of

machining and still others of writing... leaving me wired yet exhausted, too

limp to face the daily onslaught of perky voices and curious faces.  And then

there are the unexpected doses of adrenalin:  skimming the Pacific with Alan in

a Cessna 172, only to nose skyward, squeak over a cliff, and aim for the

treetops of a 2,000-foot ridge.  "There's my property," he says, pointing down

as the plane closes in on a cluster of redwoods at 200 feet per second...



     Adrenalin's addicting stuff, isn't it?  But unlike most addictions, it's

pure delight when the conditions are right and horrifying when they're not.

Skydiving, breathless tickling marathons, climbing to Alan's tree fort in the

dark, taking a blind corner at 30 in a Vacuum Velocipede -- those are OK.

Getting cut off by a jerk-piloted dirty white van making a left turn onto Page

Mill Road -- that's definitely NOT OK.  That little buzz of adrenalin does

little to offset the chilling awareness of extreme vulnerability, of mortality.

 Sometimes I get images... a mental slide show of what-ifs that urge me to flee

these risky highways and move to something else, something gentle, something

like a recumbent kayak or sailboat or even, while we're dreaming, something

airborne.



     But in the meantime, lacking the requisite megabucks, I'll be pedaling the

Megacycle out of Palo Alto in about 2 weeks.  The layover has served its

purpose; the tires itch violently like a sneeze that won't quite happen and the

urge to roll is so compelling that it seems almost hormonal.



     And besides, I want to play with my new toys where they're designed to

work best -- out there on the road where comfort, like a gob of gelato, is rare

treat instead of daily routine.



                                * * *



     New toys, yes.  There have been a number of techie delights to offset the

stresses of my frantic business schedule.  One of the major motives of this

whole Palo Alto adventure was to get some of the bike's sexier systems working.

 A few highlights...



-->  The machine now has pneumatic truck horns, powered by a compressed-air

tank with adjustable regulator and handlebar pushbutton.  I now sound, as well

as look, like a Mack Bike. This exciting new potential for acoustic

obnoxiousness has already paid off in traffic with that jerk in the van -- the

kind of guy who bases his respect for a man upon strength, number of tattoos,

or loudness.  Lacking the first two, I socked him with 140 db of air horns,

followed by 130 db of knifing siren and a quick clang of the bell.  His shouted

curses, rendered feeble, dwindled to a trickle and then disappeared behind a

quick, defensive finger gesture.



-->  The hydraulic brake project, product of Mathauser Engineering and a few

late nights with machining wizard Peter Lindener at Stanford, is done.  A pair

of master cylinders under the seat is actuated by a transfer bar with a

proportional coupling to the right hand brake lever.  This system, along with

the existing disc brake, might even be enough to stop my 1/5-ton biomechanical

absurdity before it crushes a stray Toyota or something.



-->  Maggie has a whole new bike.  The Infinity, faithful workhorse that it

was, couldn't be adjusted far enough to let her 5'5" body turn the cranks

without hyperextension.  Her latest sponsor is Life Cycles, the all-recumbent

bike shop here in Palo Alto (LIFECYCLES on GEnie), and the bike itself is a

beautiful silver De Felice, hung with the glitter and sheen of polished

aluminum components.  As I write, Maggie's in the lab making drilling noises

and puzzling over her all-new problems with communications gear, solar panel

mounting, packing, cabling, and so on... all of which, for both of us, are

about to be further complicated by a pair of lightweight Equinox trailers.



-->  My new security system is wonderful.  Called the UNGO Box and made by

Techne of Palo Alto, it senses even the most subtle movement (by watching for

flux-density changes in a 40 kHz field around a puddle of mercury).  Set to

maximum sensitivity, the system can trigger my pocket beeper or the on-board

siren when someone sneezes on one of my orange flags or stretches an uneducated

finger toward a console switch.  With digital remote control of a few bike

functions (like speech), my response to an alert can dissuade casual tinkering

with no loss of humor.



-->  The brain-interface unit, built on a Bell helmet substrate, is living up

to its name.  Linked to the bike by a 12-pin medical- grade Lemo connector and

coil cord, the unit provides stereo jacks for my ears, adjustable boom

microphone for my mouth, and a halogen lamp over the visor if I want to feel

light-headed.  And now, I'm designing a swing-down eyepiece for the new helmet

optical system -- since Color Microimaging Corporation is providing detailed,

full-color maps on microfiche.  We have to do whatever we can to increase our

brain's I/O bandwidth, you know... time to re-think that handlebar keyboard...



-->  Packet datacomm is working so well that I now view my bike as a mailbox --

just like the HP computer.  Every time I climb aboard, I sign on and download

the messages, which are beginning to roll in from all over the country.  The

other day, I was pedaling to Mountain View while communicating digitally with

Sourcevoid Dave while HE was enroute with friends to Monterey.  A few minutes

later, I accessed the satellite wormhole, emerged in Maryland, and left a

bulletin-board message for a friend on the East Coast -- risking my physical

self by typing my way through noontime El Camino traffic.  It's really

happening, folks... nothing can stop the networks now.  If a solar-powered

bicycle can go online while rolling, then how far are we from real-time pocket

mailboxes?



And speaking of new magic in the communications world, have you heard about

DASnet?  Remember my urgings in Chapter 24 on the general subject of

universally linked networks?  Well, I was obviously not the only person

thinking about that -- it's been done.  For information on linking to ARPANET,

ATT Mail, BITNET, CompuServe, EIES, EasyLink, MCI, Portal, The Source, Telex,

TWICS (Japan), Unison, and UUCP, drop a line to R.BRIGGS here on GEnie.



                                * * *



     Meanwhile, all this whiz-bang technology aside, what's life like as we

struggle through these last twelve rugged Palo Alto days?

Well...



     The dinners range from world-class Maggie-pizza to creative productions of

pumpkin seeds, roadside vegetation, and fish heads -- the spirited Conganese

drummer Maboukaka to my right spitting eyeballs <tink> <tink> onto the plate,

Maggie to my left helping herself to more flowers.  Drinks run the gamut from

exotic cognacs to homemade Kahlua, a tasty substance that imposes its own

curfew.  Strangely confused conversations in the bike room continue for two or

three minutes before we suddenly realize that I'm talking about interrupt logic

and Maggie's discussing aluminum fairing mounts.  Daily show-n- tell jaunts

throughout the peninsula are exhausting but profitable (at least in "soft

dollars").  KLRS is on the radio -- the area's new station dedicated to that

wonderful and yet-unnamed breed of music variously referred to as new age,

Windham Hill, space, alternative, and yuppie muzak.  Traffic roars by on

Middlefield, now and again syncopated by the thundering bass of an East Palo

Alto cruise-mobile. The perennial clutter is slowly getting sorted into boxes

and disk files.  There are far more amazing new friends and corresponding

social opportunities than I can possibly keep organized in one overloaded

wetware infosystem.  And as always, free moments are filled by the detailed

planning and fantasizing that precedes travel.



     For this, I suddenly realize, is more the beginning of trip 3 than the

continuation of trip 2.



     So here we go again... drawing back the bow, steadying the breath, slowing

the heartbeat, relaxing, sharpening the focus until the target point turns

inside-out and becomes infinite space...



          -- Steve
