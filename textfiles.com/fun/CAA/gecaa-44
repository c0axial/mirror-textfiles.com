          The energy is building:  Journey 3 is mission, passion,

obsession, religion.  As we make our last swing through the      Southeast,

pausing to frolic in New Orleans with 15,000 sweaty      librarians, I am

loosing a barrage of proposals like seductive      cruise missles into the

hotbed of high-tech industry.



          And the results are trickling in, changing the bike beyond

recognition.  The Oki cellular phone is installed and ready for

interfacing with fax, modem, and the 256-point crossbar switch.      The

components of my satellite station are arriving, frightening      me with their

combined weight while exciting me with      communication potential.  And a

Createc dual-channel digital      oscilloscope and signal computer is on board,

obsoleting my      previous mobile laboratory equipment and opening a 20 MHz

window      into the new electronics.



          Yeah, it's starting all over again.  I'm pouring my passions

into a blender and reaching for the puree button...



                                   * * *



          But the bike will still be there when I write to you from      the

BORING places.  Today I want to talk about N'awlins.  There's      a sort of

melancholy about this city, you know, a strange      melancholy that excites

the lusts and touches the soul... and      every descent from our balconied

French Quarter suite into      street-level turmoil makes the keyboard fingers

itch.  Stories      lurk in the dark eyes that glower from shadows, in the

antics of      children marked by street life, in the crenelated faces of those

     who were here to watch the first electric streetlights sharpen      their

familiar shadows.  This is a rare thing in post-video      America:  a city's

identity proclaimed by every street, every      guitar lick, every face, every

shot of Jagermeister swilled      before breakfast in Molly's Irish Pub.



          And in the deep sultry night the rhythms of cultures mingle.

Stand at Toulouse and Bourbon and let them shake you -- a      thrumming

confusion of blues, rock, jazz, Dixie, and a passing      nuclear-powered

automotive rap machine with enough oomph to      perform CPR on the driver.

Swirling through the violent acoustic      crossfire is a motley fluid of

drunken humanity, and if my      metaphors seem mixed... it's no accident.  So

is the reality.



          People!  Blacks from the projects, street-wise and native,      white

eyes darting between the blues man's golden sax and the tan      legs that lure

imaginations past the hem of a passing red      miniskirt.  Tourists of all

flavors, ambling with too-deliberate      ease along a path that avoids the

ruffians -- eyes alert to the      approach of hustlers, drunks, or the

titillating shopfronts of      commercial naughtiness.  Sixties carryovers,

ponytailed,      attitudes revealed less by hard-rock style than by a sort of

   Rockwell hardness index of the eyes.  Hawkers, luring people into

doorways to glimpse nude women writhing on smoky stages.  Cops,      jaded and

confident, frisking passers-by with a glance and      arresting the city's

descent into behavioral entropy by their      very presence.  The rich, too

well dressed, slumming.  The bottom      out-of-sight poor, eyes pleading,

slumped against dirty walls in      visible dejection.  Con artists, accosting

the naive.  Musicians,      easy in their element but disturbingly

ordinary-looking off      stage, commuting the side streets with battered

instrument cases.      Mimes, eloquent and graceful, filling cash boxes with

the      wordless poetry of dance.  Hookers swaying practised hips under

the lacy incongruities of Frederick's.  Librarians on furlough      from the

conference, walking in close wide-eyed groups in this      place far from

Kansas.  Ordinaries, who could be up to the most      hienous of evils and

never show it.  Gays, simpering down the      street with hands on each other's

bottoms.  Cabbies lending a      touch of hard-edged New York raucousness with

ready honks and      impatient driving styles.  Whooping college students,

hell-bent      on having a good time, clutching their paper-cupped Hurricanes

   while getting down in coarse parody of the bloods who lend      authenticity

to what might otherwise degenerate into a Daytona      Beach.  Old coots, young

nimble black break-dancers, lost drunk      white high-school kids, businessmen

recovering from business,      toughs on missions of darkness and terror,

brain-damaged druggies      slurring curses, and the gaudy human echoes of

Mardi Gras.  And      above all, such a variety of bodies and faces that no

stroll      through the maelstrom can fail to yield arousal, disgust,

longing, fear, awe, nostalgia, and laughter (sometimes... all by      the same

person.)



                                   * * *



          Jackson Square.  Jax Brewery.  Cafe du Monde.  The shops and

museums of Royal Street.  The city by day is awash in tourism, an      economy

based on T-shirts, biegnets, ceramic masks, artwork, and      endless

variations on the almighty souvenir.  For 75 cents, you      can knock back an

"oyster shooter" -- a raw gob of glistening      gray flesh swimming in a

dollop of Bloody Mary mix.  At Mr. B's      Bistro, the bartender muddles an

Old Fashioned while keeping up a      running commentary on local food, music,

and shops.  At Molly's      breakfast, fogged penitent eyes and tortured

foreheads mark the      hung-over.  It's all here:  portrait artists competing

for      sittings, joggers in the park, calliope toots under rising

columns of riverboat smoke, sunsets over the cathedral, fleshy      old women

in ghastly pastels clutching beaded handbags, a pricey      gallery of Lennon

and Erte, bored horses with flowered hardhats      standing before idle

buggies, coarse propositions muttered to any      female on the street, a

capella falsetto soul scatting, mingled      languages, heart-pounding glimpses

of flesh and ecstasy, ripoffs,      good deals, brutal humidity, and interludes

of iced cappuccino to      cool the sweat.



          And what delights me most in all this is that it knows      itself,

celebrates itself, procreates itself like a giant mutant      amoeba.  New

Orleans is its own species, not a homogenized      amalgam of malls,

billboards, and suburban conformity; this city      rejects the ordinary by

seducing it, assimilating it, and      changing it forever.



                                   * * *



          Our home for a week has been the Olivier Guest House on      Toulouse

Street -- a rambling place of eccentric hallways,      surprise staircases,

gardens, balconies, old N'awlins flavor, and      a slowly-evolving family of

international guests (mainstream      American tourists, as a general rule,

prefer the predictable      carbon-copy motel motif).  This place has taken on

a sense of      home -- not only because of its period furniture and shambling

    authenticity, but also because of its familiarity:  I stayed here      when

I pedaled through four years ago.



          Our bikes have their own room -- the original parlor with      its

16-foot ceiling, bronze chandelier, and blue velvet      wallpaper.  And an

unexpected bonanza:  they are guarded around      the clock by guest house

personnel and a New Orleans cop named      Aaron... a source of colorful street

stories if ever there was      one.  In this place where madness and booze

mingle without      discipline, it's comforting to have a friend on the force.



          The Olivier is an oasis -- a quiet retreat from the city      nestled

in its very midst.  We lay around, skinnydip in the pool,      stroll in the

courtyard, neck on the balcony, frolic in the      canopy bed, spy on the

neighbors, play with the four kittens      stumbling cutely around our room,

and gaze out over the city's      rooftops... all without the nervous

excitement of street life      itself.  Yet with a few dozen steps we can

switch modes and join      the revelry, making the change with no more effort

than idly      fingering a TV remote control.  The difference, of course, is

  that the TV is video and the city is an intense, involving      experience

that assaults all the senses.



                                   * * *



          Speaking of video, we've had a healthy dose of media      exposure

lately -- with CNN and CBS both splaying us across      national screens within

the same week.  But last night's      adventure added a different perspective

to the CAA video      collection...



          The bike stood parked against a blue wall.  Behind glass, a

mostly male crowd gawked and grinned; in the room, Maggie and I      reviewed

our loosely-choreographed script and took last-minute      swigs from emergency

Hurricanes.  A wall of monitors and control      panels was alive with images:

the bike, a layer of swirling      mist, color bars.  Then the music started...

ZZ Top's "Legs."



          Bouncing in hot pink, Maggie danced into the camera's view.      In

exaggerated motions, she mimed her astonishment at      encountering the

Winnebiko -- bending low to study it, eyes wide      and innocent, hips rocking

to the beat.  The music moved her, and      the men behind the glass risked not

a blink as fabrics flowed      under hot lights.  Knowing well her body

language, I could feel      the growing tension...



          I chose my moment, and danced into view.  "Who are you?"      asked

my eyes, and we looked each other over, circling like      animals in season,

touching in tentative intrigue.  "She got legs      -- she knows how to use

them..."  I knelt and felt, hands gliding      over calves and thighs, eyes

teasing, fabrics playing peek-a-boo.      The dance grew ritual, erotic, its

outcome obvious in every      touch.



          I made my move.  Climbing aboard the Winnebiko and fastening      my

helmet, I pointed at her and then curled my finger into a      "come hither."

"Moi?" questioned her look.  "Vous!" answered mine.



          She stepped astride my lap, leaning into me as the music      shook

us -- video capturing in silhouette the lovers meeting, the      first kiss,

the bodies moving, the power, the beginning... and      then the bike rolling

slowly out of frame to leave only colors,      guitars, desires, and an

audience stunned by this unexpected      blend of technology and erotic rock...



                                   * * *



          Yeah, it's hard to leave this place.  I write now at a worn

table in Molly's, dark walls around me plastered with yellowed      business

cards dating back to the 60's.  The clientele is varied:      hungover Smiley

asleep against the pay phone, a woman in too-      tight leather, a

street-scarred longhaired Asian, a scattering of      tattooed regulars.

Another perfect omelette just met its match,      and I alternate between

coffee, water, and Jagermeister while      trying to capture something of this

town.  And oddly, I find I      don't want to go.



          Cities usually chase me away with noise and danger.  This      place

has both in abundance, but I think there's no hurry... and      I certainly

don't miss the hot smelly bus and its load of      clutter.  I know this little

place down on Decatur where the      jambalaya can make you crazy...





          Cheers from the road!

               Steve
