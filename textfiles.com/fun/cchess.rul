                            Chinese Chess

                             "Xiang Qi"

 
Background:

      Xiang Qi or Chinese chess is "one of the three major versions of
      chess." The other two are Western chess and Shogi. The movement and
      number of attacking pieces is more limited than Western chess making
      it perhaps harder or easier.

 
Setup:

      The pieces in Chinese chess are placed and played on the lines instead
      of the squares as in Western chess.

      The square defined by A4, C4, C6, and A6 is as the "General's square"
      Similarly, J4  H4, H6, and J6 also define another General's square.

      Assume that the uppercase is "Team two" and the lowercase is "Team one"


Pieces:

      The pieces are represented on the above board are as follows:

           S = Soldier   (P)        C = Cannon
           T = Tank      (R)        H = Horse (N)
           E = Elephant  (B)        A = Adviser
                  G = General or King (K)

      These initials come from the literal translation of the Chinese
      character into English (Except for tank). The letters in parentheses
      represent the Western equivalent of the piece; thus, pieces and their
      movement may be more easily remembered.



Movement:

     Tank     : Moves and attacks just like a rook. This piece can cross the
                 river. The actual translation is car or the ancient
                 equivalent of one.

     Elephant : Moves and attacks like a bishop except that it can only and
                 must move across two squares at a time. It cannot cross the
                 river. Therefore, the elephants on team one will only be
                 able to occupy A3, E3, A7, C1, C5, C9, and E7.

     Soldier  : This piece can only move forward when it is on the side of
                 its own color. After it crosses the river, though, it can
                 also move left and right. The soldier can never move
                 backwards.

     Horse    : This piece moves like a knight in Western chess except it
                 can be blocked. For example:

                    1-----------2           ------8------
                    |  |  |  |  |           |  |  |  |  |
                    ---C--H------           ---7---------
                    |  |  |  |  |           |  River    |
                    3-----------4           ---------H---
                    |  |  |  |  |           |  |  |  |  |
                    ---5-----6---           -------------

                 A horse must move one space down a line and then diagonally
                 across a square. Therefore, the above horse can reach the
                 numbers 2, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers 1 and 3 are blocked by
                 the cannon. The horse cannot move over a piece and
                 consequently, cannot reach 1 and 3. This piece can cross the
                 river which also counts as one space and is shown above.

                 If the horse was to cross the river, it would land at 7 or
                 8.

     Cannon   : This piece moves like a rook but attacks differently.
                 instead of "running into a piece" as the rook does, the
                 cannon jumps over one piece and captures the one
                 behind it. For example:

                 ---t-----h-----C---
                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
                 -------------------

                 The cannon can jump over the horse and take the opponent's
                 tank. The cannon, though, cannot take the horse unless there
                 is something between it and the horse. The cannon can cross
                 the river.

     Advisor  : This piece is limited to moving one space only on the
                 diagonals in the General's square. Therefore,

                 o-----o
                 | \|/ |
                 ---o---   <-- General's square
                 | /|\ |
                 o-----o

                 the o's mark the possible positions of the advisor. This
                 piece cannot leave the square.

     General  : Like the Advisor, the general can only stay within the
                 General's square. Instead of moving on the diagonals,
                 the general moves only orthagonally. In other words, it can
                 move like the Western king minus diagonals.

Rules:

      Exactly like Western chess. Players take turns moving their pieces
      with the intent of capturing the opponent's general.

      If a "loop" occurs in the game, the attacking piece must end the loop
      after the loop has occurred three times in a row. If both sides do not
      have any attacking pieces ( tank, horse, cannon, soldier) or it is
      utterly impossible to break the loop, then a stalemate occurs.
      A stalemate is very uncommon.

      "Check" is said whenever the general is in check.

      Finally, the two generals cannot face each other. In other words, there
      cannot be a clear line between the two generals. A move that makes
      them face each other is illegal.
