   "I can't sleep, Mommy, I'm scared of the dark," I once said.  On looking
back, I have asked myself, "Why am I frightened by dark rooms and pesty
spiders?" From my experience, I have never seen the "bogey man" in action,
stabbing and eating people alive.  However, I find that these myths are inane,
but these fears which have kept us awake many nights long ago have done wonders
to our lives and will influence them in the future continuously, yet
relentlessly.
   Once upon a time, under the starry night of Taiwan, I encountered the
darkest alley of the capital city, Taipei.  I was on my way to the nearest
department store.  Realizing that I was alone and vulnerable to the frequent
attacks of muggers, ghastly sorcerors, and gruesome mobs, I stopped suddenly
to clarify and investigate my situation.  Should I turn back?  In response, I
sensed an inward shreik of terror.  After a brief hesitation, I swung around
and walked (at the same time, thanking God that my legs did not fail me) into
the open filthy streets.  Time after time, the emotion unnoticeably releases us
from imminent harm and danger and guides us towards the enlightened path during
our evanescent lives, helping them to become less of an evanescence. Though the
emotion miraculously participates in shaping our lives, it serves the young
ones loyally.  Like the instincts of animals, fear helps us to flinch or dart
way from hazardous obstacles.
   Inwardly screaming at the emotion, I forced my anger to replace my fear.
Speaking into the microphone with seriousness, madness, cogency, confidence,
pragmatism, and onerousness, the stage fright was under my feet.  However, it
broke free, unfortunately tosoon.  Fraught with paranoia, fright, and
frustration, I fainted among 450 brothers and sisters of the Church. Recovering
quickly from the paroxysm, I rose clumsily to my feet and observed the many
grins, frowns, and questionable gesticulations from my obviously shocked
audience.  Fears have cuased me unbearable shame, pain, and guilt.  They have
cost me my reputation and confidence.  Occasionally, they prevent me from doing
things.  Fear can be a nuisance.  Fear can be a vexation, yet it is needed and
is intrinsic.
   Sleepily, I climbed into my comfortable bed, pondering and recalling my
vague and half forgotten dreams and nightmares.  My imagination, triggered by
mmy previous nightmares and that macabre painting on the wall, furtively
irradiated in my trepid soul.  Shaken inexorably by the covert aspect of my
inner being, I sprung out of bed to defiantly challenge the intruding
instability within me.  Internally, I revived my sanity and logical mind by
suggesting that the facetiousness of my imagination had tricked me into seeing
festooning shadow-shapes of agitation.  "What is there to be afraid of?  I've
slept in this room for 10 years," I responded to my inassurance of safety.
Our fears cannot be deliquesced by anger, hatred, or zeal.  Our restless
imaginations cannot be cast into an alcove, forever, to avoid causing further
damage.
   "Are you a man or a mouse?" a famous person once asked.  Fear dwells in the
corners of our eyes, preventing us from making phone calls, buying bubble gum,
or talking to teachers.  Nevertheless, fear will change us.  The bravest
person in the world has fears.  He/she may be incredulous, but we know...
