	 	     The Apostle to the Galatians




  This letter was written to the Galatians, which lived in Asia Minor between

Cappadocia and Phrygia.  They were converted 52 A.D. by St. Paul, and were 

Gentile Christians.  They were good Christians, being baptized and recieved the

Holy Spirit.  Paul visited them a second time, and saw their great faith

again.  But after his second visit, Paul learned that some Jewish teachers had

come to the area to teach beliefs contrary to his doctrines, such as the

necessity of circumcision and other Mosiac rites.  They also wanted to make 

Paul look like he didn't know what he was talking about, and make his teaching

look bad.  They said that Paul disregarded the sacredness of Mosaic Law and

circumcision, which were external signs of God's covenant with man, and 

thereby doubted the truth of the Lord's divine promises.  Since Paul was in

Ephesus at the time, he was unable to make correction by visiting his 

Galatian friends, so he corrected it by writing this letter.  This Epistle 

contains his own defense of his doctrine and purpose.  He shows justification

in Mosaic Law, but also faith in Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead for our

sins.  He concludes by stating that Mosaic Law was not something that was

permanent, and that it is not an essential part of Christianity.  The subject

matter of this Epistle is similar to the Epistle to the Romans and the Second

Epistle to the Corinthians.  The reason for this is that these Epistles were

written when Paul was in the same frame of mind, so his work showed it.  It was

probably written at Ephesus about the year 54 A.D., but it may have been 

written somewhat later, from Macedonia or Corinth.  It is a very well-organized

and divided Epistle.  Its format is:

      Conclusion


  Paul opens with a prayer, giving peace to the reader.  He then says that if

anyone tries to teach a gospel other than that of Christ's, they should be

cursed and taken out of God's kingdom.  He defends his Apostate and states that

it is not of human origin.  He then talks of how he was approved by the

Apostles.  He then gives a short doctrinal on Christianity.  He tells the 

Galatians that to be a Christian you need faith, and you need the Spirit in 

you.  The men of faith are sons of Abraham, he tells them.  He then tells them

that you are cursed if you rely on the Law.  The Law was meant to lead Christ.

Therefore when Christ came, the Law had no more purpose.  By dying on the cross

Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law.  He says that Christians are free

now, and that there is no return to slavery.  He says that you should walk in

the Spirit, and you will be guided along the road to heaven.  The fruit of the

Spirit is:  charity, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, modesty,












continency.  Paul says that they who belong to Christ have crucified their

flesh with its passions and desires.  He says that we should bear one another's

burdens, and so we will fulfill the law of Christ.  Therefore if anyone 

thinks himself to be something, whereas he is nothing, he fools himself.  Be

not decieved, God is not mocked.  Paul tells us that while we have time, we

should do good to all men.  In his conclusion, Paul states that the Galatians

should follow Christ and His way to be saved and enter God's kingdom, and then

he gives a blessing.
