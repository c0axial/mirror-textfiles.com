	Actually, I liked this movie much better than "Broadcast News".  This
 
  movie was much more direct, and even though it had those corny love subplots

  too, they were characteristically 7O's-ish, and I could laugh at them, 

  whereas in "Breadcast News", the big story about the "love triangle" was

  too much for me to handle, in a sense - I couldn't wait until it was over.

  Also, since it was an older movie, I could easily distinguish the surface

  clutter (such as dress, photography, etc) of the time it was made and look

  much more closely at the central theme, whereas in "Broadcast News", which 

  was made just a few years ago, the two things were much more mixed and

  indistinguishable because of the fact that it is a recent movie.  I could

  relate to it better, but had trouble picking out it's central meanings.

	Moreover, what "Network" is trying to say, in my view, is that the

  dangers of our increasingly networked society are great (in the 7O's, they

  were always making movies about the dangers of things we do -- I wonder

  what the 9O's will bring for us now that a whole decade past by without

  us doing anything about them).  The death of the talk show star at the end

  of the movie really came as a suprise to me.  When they were discussing

  his murder in the office, I thought, "Oh, they CAN'T be serious."  I'm not 

  sure if the problem of commerciality has gone THAT far, where execs in the

  Big Leagues would actually do something like that, but I realize the vast

  economic impact the media has given to the modern (or should I say present)

  society.  I think that "Network" does a good job of getting this point 

  across.  No matter how good or creative a piece of work is (not just TV,

  but movies, music, etc), it won't even be considered by the execs of the

  media companies.  (I'm sure you know this, I'm just letting you know that I

  know it).  It's terrible that the good stuff gets dumped for trash like

  the Cosby Show (well, it has SOME redeeming value, but it's not as good as

  they say), New Kids on the Block, abd "Fatal Attraction".  But the ratings
  
  people say that we like it.  Sort of like now, because February is sweeps

  month, it's funny to see channels 5 and 3 stoop down to new lows with

  "news reports" of date rape, strip joints, and other sexually violent

  pseudo-journalistic hype-trash reports.  Like Bob Tanak said on Wednesday,

  such trash might get fast ratings, but they won't hold people in the

  long run.  Unfortunatley, these people don't seem to realize that.
