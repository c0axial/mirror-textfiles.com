		We, the free-thinking teenagers of America, wish to express

	our views of the high school environment.  It is our belief that

	the current educational system is at a major slump in its
	
	development.  We believe that high school as we know it needs a

 	drastic change.



		First of all, look at some of the teachers that have epileptic

	fits when they spot a poor, helpless soul chewing gum in class.  What

	does chewing gum have to do with the teaching environment?  Will it 

	distract other students?  Or is it a health hazard ( "You might choke

	on it while trying to catch up on your Algebra II homework." )?  It is

	understandable that you have to draw the line somewhere, but the way 

	some of the teachers act towards some subjects, it makes you wonder 

	if you are going to school to learn something, or just to be there for

	a teacher to show of his/her power to you ( "This is a down staircase!"

	"But... there's no one else on it!" "It doesn't matter.  Go back down

   	and walk around!" ).  And the funny thing is, most of those teachers

        can't even TEACH.  In their class, you'd expect them to be good at the

	subject they teach, but they tend to concentrate more on whether you

	have enough points in the gradebook rather than if you've learned

	something.  And if kids DO learn something, but don't get the points,

	their bad grades discourage them.  The ones that get good grades but 

	don't learn anything get scholarships and turn out just like the
	
	teachers.  Not all teachers are like this, but all it takes are a few

	to ruin the "teaching environment".  We think that less seriousness

	in the enforecement of a student's extracurricular activities and

	more stress on actual TEACHING could not only help today's high 

	school youths, but also tommorrow's leaders.  We don't want a world

	run by a group of rejected, mentally confused people, but by 

	organized, calm individuals that can take pride in themselves and 

	their fellow man.




		Maybe those teachers are right and the rebellious students are

	at fault.  It very well could be that those teachers are the ones 

	teaching us a very important lesson in life, and we are the ones that

 	should be listening.  Who knows, maybe it's alright that 42.7% of all

	students graduating from most high schools today can't even get 

	admitted to a halfway decent college.  If that's the case, modern 

	education can go on without us.  Who needs the student anymore?
