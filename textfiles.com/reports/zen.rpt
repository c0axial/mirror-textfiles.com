	     Buddhism is based on the teachings of a man who was born in
	 what is now India during the sixth century B.C.  He was called by
	 many names, but the most famous of them are Siddhartha(the one who
	 has reached the goal), Sakyamuni(sage of the Sakyas), and
	 Buddha(the enlightened).  His was an "ideal" childhood, both
	 priveleged and protected.  His father told the servants not to let
	 him outside the palace compound where they lived, but the legends
	 say that he once got away long enough to witness old age and
	 sickness.  These things bothered him, and he set out to find an
	 answer through religion.  He gave up his position and wealth, and
	 for six years he searched for answers to his questions.  After
	 spending another six years in meditation, he gave up on traditional
	 religion.  He then went to beg for rice, and had his first full
	 meal since he had left the palace.  He then went to meditate under
	 the Bodhi tree, where he achieved enlightenment.  The Buddha then
	 traveled around India, teaching his beliefs.
	     Ten years after the Buddha died, a council was assembled to
	 write down the things that the Buddha had felt and said.  This was
	 necessary because the Buddha had not left any written instructions
	 regarding his beliefs.  At this first council, the people produced
	 a group of sutras, now held to be the religious tenets of Buddism.
	     Since the beginnings of Buddhism, many different sects have
	 been formed within the religion.  One of the major sects is called
	 Zen.  Zen is not a religion; there is no God to worship in Zen, and
	 there are no ceremonial rites to be carried out by the followers of
	 Zen.  The afterlife is not descibed or even mentioned in a positive
	 way.  Many Zen monks feel that there is no afterlife, and that the
	 purpose of Zen is to achieve happiness by realizing that material
	 goods don't matter.  It is felt by these monks that all unhappiness
	 comes from material goods and circumstances in the world.  It is
	 also their belief that through Zen, a person can see how
	 meaningless these things are and be truly happy.  Zen has no sacred
	 books or tenets.  It has no set of doctrines that are imposed on
	 followers, and it has no intellectual analysis to teach.  Zen is
	 against all religious conventionalism.  It is also above
	 conventional meditation.  It's purpose is to discipline the mind,
	 and make it the master of its surroundings.

	 The Ways of Zen

	     One of the basic needs of a system like Zen is a leader, and
	 the leaders of Zen were called Patriarchs.  The Patriarch would be
	 (extremely) roughly analogous to The Pope.  There have been a total
	 of twenty-eight of these men.	To give an idea of what life for
	 early Zen monks was like, and how a Patriarch was chosen, the
	 following story is given:
	     The Fifth Patriarch, who ruled in the seventh century A.D.,
	 decided that he would choose the Sixth Patriarch by means of a sort
	 of contest:  Whichever of his disciples could compose a stanza
	 showing true understanding of the mind would be made Sixth
	 Patriarch.  The monks assumed that the leading scholar of the
	 monastery, Shen-hsiu, would win, so they decided not to write
	 anything at all.  Shen-hsiu worked for four days and then
	 anonymously wrote a stanza on the corridor wall.  It ran:
	 .M:1
	 .-

		  Our body is the Bodhi-tree,
		  And our mind a mirror bright.
		  Carefully we wipe them hour by hour,
		  And let no dust alight. [1]

	     This verse did not please the Fifth Patriarch, who advised
	 Shen-hsiu to write another.  Before Shen-hsiu had composed
	 another, an illiterate disciple, named Hui-neng, had the verse
	 read to him.  After hearing it, he dictated a verse to be written
	 next to it.  Hui-neng's verse ran:
	 .M:1
	 .-

		  The Bodhi (True Wisdom) is not like the tree;
		  The mirror bright is nowhere shining:
		  As there is nothing from the first,
		  Where does the dust itself collect? [2]

	     The legend says that all of the monks were amazed, and the Fifth
	 Patriarch rubbed out the verse to protect Hui-neng from the other
	 jealous monks.  Later, he summoned Hui-neng in the middle of the
	 night and pronounced him the Sixth Patriarch.	He gave him the
	 robe and begging bowl of Bodhidharma (the First Patriarch).  He
	 also presented him with the Diamond Sutra, which Hui-neng later
	 established as the primary scripture of Zen.  The Fifth Patriarch
	 advised Hui-neng to flee to the south, because he felt that it
	 would be unsafe for him to stay in the area.
	     Zen went through some radical changes close to this time, the
	 most signifigant of which was the addition of the koan system of
	 attaining enlightenment.  A koan is a statement made by an old
	 Zen master, or an answer of his.  The uninitiated are expected to
	 study the koan without attempting to figure them out with logic.
	 He is expected to try to feel the meaning of the koan.  Often,
	 this goes on for years.  During this entire period, the monk is
	 supposed to be keeping the koan first and foremost in his mind.
	 It is said that eventually, if the circumstances are right he
	 will finally realize what it means, and he will have attained
	 enlightenment.  The most famous koan tells that when asked, "Is
	 there Buddha-nature in a dog?" Joshu (a famous Zen master)
	 replied, "Mu!" (pronounced Wu).  Mu literally means "not" or
	 "none", but when in reference to the question of the dog, it is
	 "Mu", pure and simple.[3]  This representative koan shows the
	 difficulty a person might have in attempting to understand what
	 the master was talking about.	The koan were absolutely
	 necessary for the survival of Zen.  There are still Zen masters
	 who claim that they are "contrived," and not a viable way of
	 attaining enlightenment.  However, without the koan system, Zen
	 very probably would have died out.  Before their use, Zen was
	 thought of as mysticism, and many monks became frustrated and
	 skeptical.  Without the koan, there is a good chance that Zen
	 wouldn't have withstood the onslaught of Christan missionaries to
	 the Orient.

	 Modern Zen Life

	     A modern Zen monk pursues the same goals and ideals that the
	 monks of two thousand years ago did.  However, in day to day
	 life, much is different.  The most signifigant changes to the
	 lives of Zen pupils are those made to the monasteries where they
	 lived.  Before the Zen had a system of learning for themselves,
	 most lived in monasteries of the Vinaya sect.	The principles
	 that the Vinaya believe in have much in common with the
	 principles of the Zen, but there are some differences.  These
	 differences made it hard for struggling Zen monks of the time.
	 The modern Zen system of education is unique to the Zen
	 monasteries.  It uses a combination of lectures and learning
	 through living, to show the monks the pathway to Zen.	The man
	 who devised this system was called Hyakujo.  He wrote a book on
	 how a Zen monasterey should be established and kept running.  The
	 book contained detailed regulations on the forming of meditation
	 halls.  Meditation halls are a part of a Zen monastery that no
	 other sect uses.  Although the original book was lost, the monks
	 of today still use set of rules based on the practices  of
	 monasteries known to have been established in accordance with the
	 original book.
	     The monasteries of the Chinese Zen are much larger and
	 grander than the monasteries of the Japanese Zen.  The Japanese
	 felt that luxury was not necessary to the practice of Zen.  They
	 also didn't have the money to spare, as Zen was not "government
	 subsidized" in Japan the way it was in China.  Besides the work
	 on meditation halls, Hyakujo is best known for his guiding
	 principle of life.  He expressed this simply as, "no work, no
	 eating."  This represents a much broader philosophical viewpoint
	 than it appears to.  The Zen feel that no labor is too demeaning,
	 and that there is no distinction of respectability or honor
	 between lighting holy candles and such tasks as sweeping.  In a
	 typical Zen monastery, the older, more experienced monks are
	 given the most menial tasks.  This stresses the idea expressed
	 by, "no work, no eating."  Hyakujo felt that there was no honor
	 in eating undeserved bread.  When Hyakujo became old and weak,
	 his monks hid all of his gardening tools so that he would not
	 have to do the garden work.  He refused to eat until the monks
	 returned his tools and let him go on working.	This idea was not
	 simply a principle to Hyakujo; he did not hold by it merely
	 because he thought it was right.  He knew that men who fall into
	 the trap of exercising the mind without working with the body
	 become thoughtless.  I say, "thoughtless," in a literal sense,
	 Hyakujo did not want the Zen monks to get caught in the trap that
	 ruined many other sects of Buddhism.  He was saving them from
	 mental inactivity and an unbalanced mind with his simple, "no
	 work, no eating."
	     In the Zen meditation halls of today, life is difficult for
	 uninitiated monks.  Part of the training of Zen involves
	 humility, and all new Zen monks taken into a monastery are
	 refused at first.  They are expected to wait near the front of
	 the building all day.	When the time to eat comes, they request
	 food.	The Zen masters go along with this, as they do not refuse
	 food or board to a traveler.  At night, the new monk must ask for
	 a place to sleep.  He is usually shown into an unfurnished room
	 for the night.  The next morning he goes to wait outside again.
	 This will go on until the new monk gives up, or until the masters
	 are impressed with the monk's patience and let him into the
	 brotherhood.  This often goes on for weeks.
	     Life is not easy for the accepted monks in any monastery
	 either.  Each monk is allowed an area of floor to live on.  This
	 area is no larger than a three by six foot rectangle.	In this
	 space, each monk must sit, meditate, sleep, and exercise.  He can
	 never use more than one quilt throughout the seasons, and can
	 have no pillow.  His belongings are kept in a box one foot
	 square.  These belongings usually consist of nothing more than a
	 few books, a razor (to be used for the head), a set of different-
	 sized bowls, and some clothes.  The monks are summoned to eat by
	 the sound of a gong, and they proceed to the food hall.  Zen
	 monks get very little in the way of food, but do not seem to
	 suffer from it.  Early in the morning, near six a.m., the monks
	 are summoned to the food hall to be given rice gruel.	They carry
	 a bowl to the hall, where they can eat as much gruel as they
	 like, as well as any vegetables they have picked.  At around ten
	 a.m., they are given rice, vegetable soup, and pickles.  Four
	 p.m. is the monks' last chance to eat in the day unless they are
	 lucky enough to be invited for dinner to a generous host's house.
	 They do not waste food, and the four p.m. "meal" consists only of
	 leftover rice and rice gruel.	The monks always eat in silence,
	 and fold their hands as a way of requesting more food.  When the
	 monk-waiter comes around, they wipe off their bowl to, "rid it of
	 impurities introduced by them."  These acts are representative of
	 the peace that these monks feel.  Being a Zen monk is not easy,
	 but there aren't many dissatisfied monks either.

	 Zen and The Western World

	     In a dialogue that took place in New York, at the Rochester
	 Zen Center, Students from Rochester College spoke with a Zen
	 monk.	A Japanese student asked about wall hangings and said they
	 were strange to him and that in Japan he never saw them.  A
	 Chinese student heard this and told the Japanese student that Zen
	 was originally Chinese and had been taken to Japan.  He said that
	 the Japanese way was not necassarily the right way.  An Indian
	 student responded by saying that Buddha was Indian and that they
	 should remember that always.  The Zen monk then stopped them to
	 explain that the American way of Zen was a mixture of all of
	 these ways.  He said:
	 .M:1
	 .-

		  The three of you need to be reminded that our
		  American tradition is to use all traditions
		  freely.  Each of your countries has poured the
		  waters of its own Buddhist culture into the
		  ocean of Buddhism.  These waters are now
		  quenching the spiritual thirst of many Americans.
		  The Buddha's Way is universal, transcending all
		  cultures.  The Buddha isn't found just in India
		  or China or Japan but wherever men and women
		  revere him and live according to his teachings.[4]

	 .D
	     This quote is representative of the feelings of many
	 Americans towards Zen.  The monk's response shows the melting pot
	 spirit of America all over again.  He has taken the ideals of the
	 founders of America to heart and applied then to the study of,
	 "Americanized Zen."  This form of Zen holds great possibilities
	 for the future of America.  On the whole, Americans are extremely
	 frustrated and dissatisfied because of material wealth.  These
	 are exactly the kinds of problems that Zen deals with, showing
	 how unimportant they really are.
	     Frequently, American owners and managers of large
	 corporations attend group meeting with Zen monks to find out
	 about Zen.  They ask questions about how Zen could help their
	 company if they provided free study for their employees.
	 Corporations could use Zen to keep employee morale up.  When a
	 person is enlightened through Zen, he sees work in a new light,
	 and doesn't mind menial tasks.  Like the great Zen masters of
	 Japan sweeping the porches, the people of a company would be
	 working for themselves as well as for the group.
	     Zen is also approved and suggested by a growing number of
	 psychiatrists and psychoanalysts in America.  Zen has shown good
	 results in many situations where the analyst recommends it.  Most
	 American monasteries and Zen Centers will take in mildly anxious,
	 depressed, and disturbed people.  If they feel that a person is
	 showing true interest in Zen, they will take in that person and
	 try to help him through Zen.  The meditation, or zazen, part of
	 Zen is very relaxing, and can help nervous people.  Zen also
	 allows people to see the world and its problems in perspective,
	 thus helping depressed and disturbed individuals.  When asked to
	 clarify what he used Zen for, a psychoanalyst said, "I feel that
	 my job is to clear up the confusion and mental instability of my
	 patients so that they can one day be ready for Zen."[5]
	 .D
	 5. Kapleau, Roshi Philip. Zen Dawn in The West, pg. 14
	 .D
	     Another question that American Zen monks are often asked is
	 how well they think other methods work for attaining
	 enlightenment, and if other methods can be used in conjunction
	 with Zen.  The other methods of relaxation and attaining
	 enlightenment include such practices as est, TM, Hare Krishna,
	 and even biofeedback and bioenergetics.  In response, most Zen
	 monks will say that these other methods work well for relaxation
	 and, "mind expansion," but not for true enlightenment.  They seem
	 to feel that to simply improve your concentration, relaxation
	 abilities, and body, these other disciplines are more than
	 enough.  But they feel that Zen involves much more, and that it
	 is the true path to happiness.  In Zen, one breaks through both
	 the conscious and the unconscious, whereas in the other methods
	 of spiritual awakening, one only attains mind expansion or
	 heightened awareness.	The monks do not feel that these things
	 mix well with Zen, and do not suggest that they be used in
	 conjunction with it.  They do say that both hatha yoga and tai
	 chi can be used with Zen, as long as the person using them
	 separates them from their philosophic theories.  Biofeedback is
	 not at all suitable to be used with or in place of Zen, despite
	 the fact that it has been called, "electric Zen."  The monks
	 feels that the uses of biofeedback do not extend beyond simple
	 relaxation and helping high blood pressure and such problems.
	 
	 American Zen

	     Americans have taken Zen and changed it to fit their
	 lifestyles.  The largest change they have made is the almost
	 complete removal of the Buddhist beliefs.  There are very few Zen
	 priests in America because most Americans are searching to gain
	 from the practice of Zen without giving up the religions that
	 they hold.  When a Zen master feels that a student is ready to
	 become a priest, the student is offered the robe of the Buddha.
	 Zen masters generally look upon people who accept Zen and refuse
	 to accept the Buddhism that it is based on as somewhat akin to
	 parasites.  A person can hardly blame them.  In recent years,
	 however, these students have been seen by many masters in a
	 kinder light.	Many masters have recognized the need for
	 something in between laymen and priest.  American Zen "laymen"
	 are said to belong to the new Maitreya Zen Buddhism.  They do
	 have a robe like the robe of the Buddha, which they are given
	 when their teachers feel they are ready.  It is often purple, and
	 it is almost always made of patched cotton to show the makeshift
	 nature of American Zen.  New American Zen practices are being
	 developed at most of the American monasteries, too.  The
	 following is an excerpt that shows the feeling of the American
	 Zen and its robes.(dharma are the traditional Japanese robes)
	 .M:1
	 .-

		  Come Buddha, please sit for a while under this
		  shadowless tree and meditate on my ragged, hand-
		  me-down Zen dharma.  I have patched it together
		  from scraps of material gathered from the garbage
		  dumps of my Zen enviroment.  This patchwork dharma
		  may look like a raggle-taggle affair, full of
		  intellectual holes, but I think you will find it
		  soft, of good texture, well made and comfortable. [6]

	 Conclusion:

	     All in all, Zen could be very beneficial to America.  It has
	 been shown that it can help large corporations become more
	 productive, while at the same time increasing employee
	 satisfaction levels.  Since this can be done without infringing
	 on the workers rights in any way, and at little expense to the
	 employer, it is an ideal way to improve a business.  It has also
	 been shown that Zen can be very useful in helping disturbed
	 people when it is coupled with psychanalysis.	This would be
	 extremely good for America, as we have one of the highest suicide
	 and depression rate of major countries.  If a great number of
	 people would try to use Zen, it might also lower the drug problem
	 in the U.S., for the same reasons it would help the suicide
	 problem.  Zen also encourages the giving up of impure substances.
	 It does not require it, but Zen monks say that if a person
	 practices for long enough they will want to give up drugs and
	 refined foods.  Zen could help America with most of its major
	 problems, and is just now (after centuries) becoming
	 differentiated from cults in the average Anerican's mind.
