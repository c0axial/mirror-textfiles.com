NOTE:  All words in bold print will be found in the glossary.

     The human body is divided into many different parts called organs. All
of the parts are controlled by an organ called the brain, which is located
in the head.  The brain weighs about 2.75 pounds, and has a whitish-pink
appearance.  The brain is made up of many cells, and is the control centre
of the body.  The brain flashes messages out to all the other parts of the
body.  The messages travel in very fine threads called nerves.  The nerves
and the brain make up a system somewhat like telephone poles carrying wires
across the city.  This is called the nervous system.

     The nerves in the body don't just send messages from the brain to the
organs, but also send messages from the eyes, ears, skin and other organs
back to your brain.  Some nerves are linked directly to the brain.  Others
have to reach the brain through a sort of power line down the back, called
the spinal cord.  The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous
system.

     The brain doesn't just control your organs, but also can think and
remember.  That part of the brain is called the mind.

        PROTECTING THE BRAIN

     Twenty-eight bones make up the skull.  Eight of these bones are
interlocking plates.  These plates form the cranium.  The cranium provides
maximum protection with minimum weight, the ideal combination.  The other
twenty bones make up the face, jaw and other parts of the skull.

     Another way the brain keeps it self safe is by keeping itself in
liquid.  Nearly one fifth of the blood pumped by the heart is sent to the
brain.  The brain then sends the blood through an intricate network of
blood vessels to where the blood is needed. Specialized blood vessels
called choroid plexuses produce a protective cerebrospinal fluid.  This
fluid is what the brain literally floats in.
     
     A third protective measure taken by the brain is called the blood
brain barrier.  This barrier consists of a network of unique capillaries.
These capillaries are filters for harmful chemicals carried by the blood,
but do allow oxygen, water and glucose to enter the brain.


                        THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF 
                                 THE BRAIN


     The brain is divided into three main sections.  The area at the front
of the brain is the largest.  Most of it is known as the cerebrum.  It
controls all of the movements that you have to think about, thought and
memory. The cerebrum is split in two different sections, the right half and
the left half.

     The outer layer of the cerebrum is called the cortex.  It is mainly
made up of cell bodies of neurons called grey matter.  Most of the work the
brain does is done in the cortex.  It is very wrinkled and has many folds.
The wrinkles and folds give the cortex a large surface area, even though it
is squeezed up to fit in the skull.

     The extra surface area gives the cerebrum more area to work. Inside
the cortex, the cerebrum is largely made up of white matter. White matter
is tissue made only of nerve fibres.

     The middle region is deep inside the brain.  It's chief purpose is to
connect the front and the back of the brain together. It acts as a
"switchboard", keeping the parts of your brain in touch with each other.

     The back area of the brain is divided into three different parts.  The
pons is a band of nerve fibres which link the back of the brain to the
middle.  The cerebellum sees to it that all the parts of your body work as
a team.  It also makes sure you keep your balance.

     The medulla is low down at the back of your head.  It links the brain
to the top of the spinal cord.  The medulla controls the way your heart
pumps blood through your body.  It also looks after your breathing and
helps you digest food.

               THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN

THE BRAINSTEM:

     The brainstem is one of the oldest parts of the brain.   It controls
such functions as breathing, blood pressure, swallowing and heart rate.


THE HYPOTHALMUS:

     This part of the brain is located directly above the brain stem.  The
hypothalmus controls basic drives like hunger and sex and as well as our
response to threat and danger.  The hypothalmus also controls the
pituitary.


THE PITUITARY:

     The pituitary produces hormones such as testosterone that circulate
through out the body.


THE THALAMUS: 

     The thalamus is like a relay area; it receives messages from lower
brain areas such as the brainstem and hypothalmus and sends them to the two
brain hemispheres.  The thalamus is located in between above the lower
brain and under the two hemispheres.


THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE BRAIN:

     Most of the above mentioned parts of the brain were produced early in
evolution but the higher mammals especially humans went on to produce a
sort of "thinking cap" on top of these parts.  This "thinking cap" was
divided into two different parts, the left hemisphere and the right
hemisphere.

     If the left side of your brain is more developed like most people's
are, you are right handed.  On the other hand if the right side of your
brain is more developed, then you will be left handed. The right side of
your brain is more artistic and emotional while the left side of your brain
is your "common sense" and practical side, such as figuring out math and
logic problems.

THE CEREBELLUM:

     One of the most important part of the Human brain is the cerebellum.
The cerebellum is involved with the more complex functions of the brain and
sometimes is even referred to as "the brain within the brain".   The
cerebellum acts as a control and coordination centre for movement.

     The cerebellum carries small "programs" that have been previously
learned.  For example, how to write, move, run and jump are all previously
learned activities that the brain recorded and can playback when needed.
Every time you practice, the brain rewrites the program and makes it
better.

     You may have heard the saying "practice makes perfect".  Well this
saying is not entirely true; another way of "practising" is just to imagine
what you wish to do.  Since the cerebellum can't actually feel, it will
think that you are doing what your imagining and respond by rewriting it's
previous program and carrying out any other actions needed for that
function.  This is one why to explain wet dreams.


THE CEREBRAL CORTEX:

     The cerebral cortex makes up the top of the two hemispheres of the
brain.  The cortex is a sheet of greyish matter which produces our
thoughts, language and plans.  It also controls our sensations and
voluntary movements, stores our memories and gives us the ability to
imagine, in short it's what makes humans, humans.

                               IN THE FUTURE

     Today many experiments are being conducted that may be break through's
for the future.  For instance "brain grafting" is one procedure that may be
used in the future.  Brain grafting is to transplant a very thin layer of
brain skin from one person to another.  This would result in control of
parkinson's disease and other seizure related diseases.

     Another radical idea that has already been successfully been tried on
rhesus monkey's is, brain transplants.  The ethics and legal problems for
such a transplant would probably never let this operation be performed on
humans.  This is because the person would not be the same, would not have
the same memories or the same abilities that the host body had had.

     The last idea of the future that we will list is called "artificial
hearing and seeing".  Artificial seeing is achieved by planting sixty-four
small electrodes in front of the visual cortex of the brain.  The
electrodes are connected to a small camera that is some where on the
person's ear.  A computer is attached to the camera.  The computer sends
the images from the camera directly to the implanted electrodes.  They
flash as the picture from the camera, thus enabling the person to somewhat
see.

     Artificial hearing is much more complicated then artificial seeing.
First a electrodes must be planted in the brain.  Then through a microphone
a computer produces electrical pulses that are then sent to the electrodes
in the brain.

     But as of yet these procedures are not practical first because of the
size of the computer, it cannot be taken out of the laboratory second the
cost of the package and third the risks involved.



                                CONCLUSION

     After all of the work and research that we have done it is very
evident to us that the brain is one of the most wondrous organs that humans
could have.  It guides us through almost every second of our life.  Even
after exploring vast and distant sky's to the microorganisms that exist
today, the brain has never ceased to amaze us and probably never will.
