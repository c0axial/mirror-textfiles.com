       Extra-Terrestrial
         Civilizations

Introduction

    Ever wondered what lies beyond our own Solar System, beyond our
furthest planet Pluto, beyond what our most powerful telescopes can
project.  With the latest in Technology and Sciences, we (The Human Race)
have only chipped off a flake of the great Pillar of Technology and
Civilization.
The question is: Are we alone?
Are human beings the only possessors of eyes that search the night sky for
new galaxies.  The only builders of devices that extend the natural senses.
The only owners of minds that think and derive the meanings of everything
around them?

    And the answer is just possibly: We are not alone!  There are others
that see, touch, feel, smell, and taste.  There are others that think and
explore, fight and make peace, or are they completely different?  It is all
unknown... and it is all waiting to be found...

The Search Within
    The early Astronomers believed that the Moon was a another world, with
a entire new civilization at heed.  The first person that took advantage of
this well spoken of legend, was a reporter for The New York Sun, whose name
was John Herschel (1792-1871), Herschel was interested in life on other
planets, so he went to South Africa with decent equipment.  But what he saw
was not what he wrote, when he returned to New York he made up a story
about seeing men with flaps over there eyes to shield them form the
brightness which the Moon gave off.  He told of rivers and lakes and green
everywhere, that story had made the Sun the best-selling newspaper for a
month, but was soon revoked when a famous astronomer noted no such thing as
life because of the "Airlessness" of the Moon.

    After a few years, past the first man on the Moon, there was the first
launch to Mars to examine the possibility of life.  The idea was that
because Mars was still in the Sun's Ecosphere and that it had ice caps
meant that there was or still is water on Mars.  When the Crew of the NASA
ship Titan landed on Mars with 150 lbs. of equipment they began work
immediately, first they analyzed the soil, which was rich in minerals, then
the atmosphere which was 1.06 % of the atmosphere of Earth, therefore the
atmosphere would leak a dangerously high level of UV rays into the planet.
So Mars was rendered inhabitable for human life and quite possibly the only
life found on planet like Mars would be low intellect single celled beings.
So then we cast out our Inner Solar System as a possible space for
extraterrestrial life.

The Outer Solar System
    In the Outer Solar System there is only one "Satellite" that has a
atmosphere, the moon Titan of the Planet Jupiter, it mostly made up of
gassy methane and is much denser than Mars atmosphere, it is the only
planet in the Solar System with an Atmosphere, it was visualized that Titan
had lakes and oceans with near freezing Methane, in other words it was a
huge lake of lighter fluid.  On Jupiter the biggest planet in our Solar
System it mostly made out of boiling Hydrogen which means that there a
little bit of water on Jupiter, but, taking the size of Jupiter, a little
bit would be alot.  The temperature on Jupiter is cold but the core of
Jupiter is near the crust and the heat it gives off would be adequate to
support life, IF the life was underwater life and during the frigid cold
just dove deeper where it was nearer to the crust.  So Jupiter is a
possibility, a slim one, but a possibility. Nebular Hypothesis

    Having gone rather exhaustively through the Solar System, it would
appear that although there may be life on several worlds other than Earth.
In the book "Extraterrestrial Civilizations" by Isaac Isamov.  An early
astronomer by the name of Thomas Wright in 1750 who began counting the
stars in the universe in sectors and/or quadrants.  He noticed that as soon
as he started to get nearer to the milky way the more stars per quadrant
there were so we came up with a rough chart of the galaxy and derived a
system to count the ammount of stars in the universe.

    So this gives us the first note...
Ä Ammount of Stars in the Galaxy = 300,000,000

    In Outer Space, there a Nebular Clouds that form all the stars,
planetary systems, etc.  In these clusters the planets are formed and the
due to the great number of wobbling stars, nebular stars etc.  We come to
the conclusion that not all stars will be able to hold on to their
planetary systems so the next note is... Ä The number of planetary systems
in the galaxy 280,000,000 In the galaxy there are not only stars that match
our Suns trajectory, there are the giant which even from a distance of
Pluto to the sun, where as the Sun is a little bigger than the average
star, the heat on that planet would reach the same degrees as the planet
Venus, which is stuck in a horrible Greenhouse Effect.  Also White Dwarfs,
a very common star in the galaxy, unfourtunately, they cannot put out
enough heat to keep the necessary elements in the Ecosphere.  The next
note... Ä The number of planetary systems in our galaxy that circle Sunlike
stars = 75,000,000,000.

The Next Target

    With a rough look at the odds, we venture the next possibilty... Space
Travel.  Lets just say, we are able to travel at the speed of light and
venturing past the Einstein explaned Theory of Relativity and take a vessel
to Alpha Centauri and also saying that we can stop immediately and reack
the speed of light immediately it would still take 4.40 years just to reach
the Alpha Centauri system.  But in reality, to reach the Alpha Centauri
System, we would need a year to speed up, eight years to get there at a
speed the human body can take and then a year to slow down, and a year to
explore all the new planets.  Thats eleven years, round trip.  So Space
travel is possible, but at the cost of eleven years.
