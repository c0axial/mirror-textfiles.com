Sec. V  No. 4               Gelled Flame Fuels

     Gelled or paste type fuels are often preferable to raw gasoline for
use in incendiary devices such as fire bottles (Molotov cocktails). This
type fuel adheres more readily to the target and produces greater heat
concentration.

     Several methods are shown for gelling gasoline using commonly
available materials. The methods are divided into the following categories
based on the gelling agent:

          4.1  Lye System

          4.2  Lye-Alcohol System

          4.3  Soap-Alcohol Systems

          4.4  Egg White System

          4.5  Latex System

          4.6  Wax System

          4.7  Animal Blood System

Sec. V  No. 4.1                Lye System
                             Gelled Flame Fuel

     Lye (also known as caustic soda or sodium hydroxide) can be used in
combination with powdered rosin or castor oil to gel gasoline for use as a
flame fuel which will adhere to target surfaces.

     Note: This fuel is unsuitable for use in the chemical self-
     igniting (sulfuric acid) type of fire bottle (Sec V No 1). The
     acid will react with the lye and break down the gel.

MATERIALS REQUIRED:

                Castor Oil     medicine           food/drug store

PROCEDURE:

     CAUTION: Make sure there are no open flames in the area when
     mixing flame fuels. NO SMOKING!

1 -  Pour gasoline into a jar, bottle, or other container. (DO NOT USE AN
     ALUMINUM CONTAINER!)

2 -  If rosin is in cake form, cut into small pieces

3 -  Add rosin or castor oil to the gasoline and stir for about five (5)
     minutes to mix thoroughly.

4 -  In a second container (NOT ALUMINUM) add lye to an equal volume of
     water slowly while stirring constantly.

     CAUTION: Lye solution can burn skin and destroy clothing. If any
     is spilled, wash away immediately with large quantities of water.

5 -  Add lye solution to the gasoline mix and stir until mixture thickens
     (about 1 minute)

     The mixture will eventually thicken into a very firm paste which
     can be thinned, if desired, by stirring in additional gasoline.

Sec. V  No. 4.2            Lye-Alcohol System
                             Gelled Flame Fuel

     Lye (also known as caustic soda or sodium hydroxide) can be used in
combination with alcohol and any of several fats to gel gasoline for use as
a flame fuel which will adhere to target surfaces.

     Note: This fuel is unsuitable for use in the chemical self-
     igniting (sulfuric acid) type of fire bottle (Sec V No 1). The
     acid will react with the lye and break down the gel.

Procedure:
1-   Natural Sources - Plants and berries are potential sources of waxes.
     Place the plants and/or berries in boiling water. The wax will melt and
     rise to the surface. Let the water cool and skim off the now hardened
     wax.

2-   Melt the wax and pour it into a jar or bottle which is in a hot water
     bath.
3-   Add the gasoline and stir to mix in the wax.

4-   When the wax has completely dissolved in gasoline, allow the water bath
     to slowly cool to room temperature.

5-   If a gel does not form, add additional wax, up to 40% by volume. If no
     gel forms with 40% wax, make a lye solution by dissolving a small
     amount of lye (sodium hydroxide) in an equal amount of water. Add this
     solution (1/2% by volume) to the gas/wax mixture and shake or stir
     until the mixture gels.

Sec. V  No. 1             Chemical Fire Bottle
             This incendiary bottle is self-igniting on impact

     (The advantage of a self-igniting flame bottle is that there is no
     flame trail leading back to the thrower. Hostile forces thus have
     some difficulty spotting the source of the device.)

4-   Add concentrated sulfuric acid until the bottle is filled to within 2-5
     cm from the top (1-2 in.). Cap the bottle securely.

5-   Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

     CAUTION: If the bottle is not thoroughly washed, it may be
     dangerous to handle during use.

6-   Wrap a clean cloth or several layers of absorbent paper around the
     outside of the bottle. Tie with string or fasten with rubber
     bands.

7-   Dissolve 100g (1/2 cup) of potassium chlorate and 100g (1/2 cup) sugar
     in 250cc (1 cup) boiling water.

8-   Allow the solution to cool, pour it into the small jar and cap tightly.
     The cooled solution should be approx. 2/3 crystals and 1/3 liquid. If
     there is more liquid than this, pour off excess before using.

     DANGER: Do not store these two bottles together! If the solutions
     mix by accident a fire will immediately result.


How To Use:

1-   Shake the small bottle to mix the contents thoroughly, and pour onto
     the cloth or paper around the large bottle. Bottle can be used while
     the cloth or paper is wet or after it dries. After drying, however, the
     sugar/potassium chlorate mixture is extremely flammable and can be
     ignited by the smallest spark or flame and must be handled accordingly.
     The bottle can be wrapped in plastic to delay drying.

2-   Throw or launch the bottle. When the bottle breaks against a hard
     surface, the fuel will ignite.
