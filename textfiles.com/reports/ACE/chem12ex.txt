8. Calculate ANY FOUR of the following, showing all the steps 
   involved in the calculation.  (2 marks each).

a) If a mixture containing 100 mL of propane (C3H8) and 1000 mL of 
   oxygen is ignited and returned to room temperature and pressure 
   what gases will remain and what volume will each gas occupy?                                 

     Equation.    C3H8    +    5O2        3CO2    +    4H2O.

c) What is the mass of 5.0 L of freon-11 (CFCl3) measured at STP?










d) What is the concentration of KOH in mol/L if 22.44 g of KOH is
   dissolved in enough water to make exactly 2 L of solution?






e) The density of a gas is 2.41 g/L at STP what is the molecular 
   mass of the gas?









 
f) A scuba diver's tank has a volume of about 13 L. When fully 
   charged with compressed air the pressure of the air in the tank 
   is about 150 times greater than atmospheric pressure. When the 
   air in the tank is released at atmospheric pressure and constant 
   temperature what will be the volume of the air?

   all the acetylene in the tank given the following equation for the
   reaction.          

     2C2H2(g)  +    5O2(g)        4CO2(g)   +   2H2O(g)
