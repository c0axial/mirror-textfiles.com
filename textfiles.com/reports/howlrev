				ALLEN GINSBERG

 	It is difficult to read Allen Ginsberg's poem _Howl_ in 1994, without
recognizing the influence it had on a society that was moving towards a
banal and materialistic existence.  This poem has made great progress
since its controversial beginnings in the 1950s, and has made its way into
anthologies and classrooms not only in the United States, but all over
the world.  _Howl and Other Poems_ has sold 745,000 copies making it one
of the most read poetry books of it's time.  (Miles 105)
	Allen Ginsberg has become synonomous with the Beat Generation, a group
who coined the term anti-establishment and set the stage for the peace
movement of the 1960s.  In 1959 "Life" magazine did an article about the
"Beat Generation" which, as the story goes, made the beats celebrities
by bringing them into the spotlight. Paul O'Neil writes in the article,  
"No Beat work has so startled the public or so influenced the Beat mind 
as Ginsberg's long poem, _Howl_, an expression of wild personal 
dissatisfaction with the world."  (O'Neil 119)
_Howl_ broke away not only from poetic literary traditions, but also from
the constraints of the "silent generation."  It was as if Ginsberg's
_Howl_ was meant to be heard by everyone,-- including the society that it
criticized.  The public was not startled by what Ginsberg was saying in
the poem, as much as by the words that he chose in saying it.  The public
obscenity trial pushed _Howl_ into mainstream popular culture, and changed
the way people read and thought about poetry. 
	Although the media's fascination with _Howl_ made it a success
with the general public, the literary critics were not so taken by it.  In
_The Partisan Review_, John Hollander states, in regards to _Howl and
Other Poems_,  "It is only fair to Allen Ginsberg...to remark on the
utter lack of decorum of any kind in his dreadful little volume (Miles
161). Many critics felt that breaking away from the traditional forms of
poetry meant that it could not be taken seriously. 
	It wasn't until the sixties and seventies that _Howl_ broke through the
literary resistance and became viewed as one of the great poems of modern
American poetry.  By this time _Howl_ was no longer media hype and 
critics decided to look at the special qualities that made it an original
and extraordinary poem.  In "How I Hear Howl", George Bowering explicates
the poem, and discusses how the three parts are constructed in such a way
as to revolve around the central unifying theme of the modern day
Moloch.  The Moloch represents the modern day monster which is symbolic
of Time. "Section 1 of "Howl" shows portraits of people the poet knows,
caught in the eye of Time" ( Bowering 372) "At the same time the martyrs
demonstrate against the other oppressions, money & academy, prisons where
not criminals but children are locked up, bent, warped, and trained to pass
thru the sacrifice fires of Moloch (373).
	Critics like Paul Portuges and John Tytell also made contributions
to the literary study of Allen Ginsberg and _Howl_.  Portuges discusses in
his book "visionary poetics" and the impact that Blake's vision has had on
Ginsberg's work.  He says, "(Howl) was indeed a surprise to many,
and a threat to many more.  Ginsberg had fully realized his quest to get
right into the terror.  The individual, victimized by the repression,
fear, and violence that so permeates Western Culture, had surfaced as one
of Ginsberg's major themes."(Portuges 46) This is symbolic of the change
in attitude about _Howl_ in the 1970s.  It was no longer perceived as a
"wildly personal disillusionment"  but was a very real and truthful vision
of what America had become.
	In "Out of the Vietnam Vortex", James Mermann recognizes "Howl" as an
anti-war poem, and states, "It is readily clear that Ginsberg has no 
specific war in mind except the inevitable one that must come again and 
again to the culture that he describes; and it is clear that he sees the 
daily experience of living in that ambiance as a war against the
spirit."(Mersmann 56) Although it is obvious that _Howl_ is dependent on
the zeitgest, it is interesting to see the poem fit in to each decade
over and over again. 
	The interest and close analysis of _Howl_ seemed to get lost in
the eighties, however, with the emphasis moving toward theoretical
studies. In Marjorie Perloff's book _Poetic Lisence_, she points out 
that,  "Charles Alteri's Enlarging the Temple, Hugh Kenner's A Homemade
World, and Robert von Hallberg's American Poetry and Culture, have tended
to ignore, if not depreciate, Ginsberg's achievement, partly, perhaps, in
reaction to the journalistic overkill devoted to the Beat Generation."
(Perloff 201) Mark Jarman states in the Hudson Review that (Ginsberg's)
poetry, that is to say, is judged thematically, and since the "themes" are
now passé, so is much of Ginsberg's work." (224) But Arthur and Kit Knight
argue that the eighties were a time when people needed to be particularly
retrospective, since, "the complacency and the totalitarian atmosphere
that characterized much of the fifties is again with us." (Knight, cover)
In their book Beat Vision, they discuss the importance of "Beat
Generation" and how it must be given the literary credit that it deserves. 
I think one thing that many critics overlook is the humorous aspect of
_Howl_.  Ginsberg states, "You're free to say any damn thing you want; but
people are so scared of hearing you say what's unconsciously universal
that it's comical." (Hyde 53) Here is a comical eighties parody of _Howl_
that I think Ginsberg would approve of:
	

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by stress
	frazzled overtired burnt-out
jogging through suburban streets at dawn
	as suggested by the late James Fixx,
career minded yupsters burning for an Amstel Light
	watching stupid pet tricks,
who upwardly mobile and designer'd and bright-eyed and high
	sat up working in the track lit glow of the Tribeca loft
	 skimming through the Day Timer while padding the expense
	account.....
who ate chocolate croissants in outdoor cafes and drank
	blush wine on Columbus Avenue washed down with a little
	Percodan with dove bars with Diet Coke with Lean Cuisine.

	addressed directly to Carl Solomon and is a darker version of Donne's 
	"Seventeenth Meditation".

	Ginsberg's facination with death, and his use of raw material written

			PUBLICATION HISTORY
 
The first edition of "Howl" was printed in Villiers England and arrived
safely at the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, where it was
published in the Fall of 1956.  The second printing, however, was seized
by the collector of customs and the San Francisco police on March 25, 1957
because, the collector stated, "the words and the writing is obscene." The
ACLU defended "City Lights Books in a long public trial, and won the case,
bringing Allen Ginsberg and his poem "Howl" instant fame.  The trial
itself was more like a comical courtroom drama, rather than a serious
trial.  The Defense brought in poets, professors and artists from around
the area to comment on the importance of Howl, not only in the literary
arena, but for society as a whole.  What is so ironic and so important
about this trial is that it gave the "Beat Generation" a chance to
confront the very core of the "oppressed" society that Ginsberg "howls"
about in the poem.  The trial only made Ginsberg's words all the more
lucid-- and convincing.  Lawerence Ferlingetti, owner of City Lights and
publisher of "Howl"  stated in the "San Francisco Chronicle", "It would
have taken years for the critics to accomplish what the good collector did
in a day." (Miles 169) Now fifty-one editions later, with over 745,000
copies sold, "Howl" has become one of the most significant poems in modern
American poetry, and has been reprinted in Ginsberg's Collected Poems, as
well as numerous anthologies.  It has been translated into Albanian,
Chinese, Czech, Dansih, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew,
Hugarian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Macedonia, Norwegian, Polish,
Portuguese, Rumanian, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.
