
Five Creation Myths

  After reading five myths about the creation of the universe, I can identify
several similarities and differences that appear in the stories.

  The most obvious similarity in the stories is the presence of a god (or
goddess) t hat brought the universe to its present state.  He or she brought
light from darkness, produced sea and land to make the Earth, and populated it
with plant and animal life.

  Differences are easy to spot too.  Different landscapes being developed are e
mphasized by groups of people living in different regions.  The Winnebago
Indians of Wisconsin mention creation of forests, streams, and lakes, while The
Pelasgian Myth mentions Mount Olympus and the Teutonic myth mentions the
Northern Sea.

  From the way the stories are written, one can guess at the way that the
cultures think and live.  The Wisconsin Indians seem to think simply, talking
about tangible things.	The Pelasgian myth talks about people and their
feelings.  The Hindu story looks at ideas and reasons behind intangible objects
like death, day, and God.  The Teutonic myth hints that the writers were having
a war or had had one in the past because a war is mentioned in the story.  The
Christians feel that faith and trust in God are important to live with.

  Looking at the same sort of story written by very different cultures is an
interesting way to learn about different ways that people can and do think.  If
one knows about different ways of thought, one can break out of the shell of
regu larity and do something different that is still a reasonable, possible way
of life.
