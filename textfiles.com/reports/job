	     B.   An analyst's work is begun by first meeting with the people

		  involved with the current functioning system.

	     C.   Cost accounting, sampling and mathematical model building

		  are some of the techniques used in problem solving.

	     D.   After a system is implemented, analysts translate the

		  logical code into program form.

	     E.   Some do research, called Advanced Systems Design, to devise

		  new analysis methods.

        V.   Job Positions

	     A.   Systems Analysis Trainees are entry level trainees, working








		  under direct supervision.

	     B.   Systems Analysts usually have 1-2 years of experience, and
