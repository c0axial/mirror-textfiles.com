	First and foremost, I'm going to define what I believe is the

  ultimate purpose of novels.  To me, the novel's prime purpose in life 

  is to gain some sort of insight on life itself - it should be realistic

  so that you 'lose yourself' in it.  This insight can be gained in many

  ways, such as by a philosophical viewpoint that the novel takes, a funny

  or comical view of something in the novel, or anything really, just as

  long as the reader learns something.  Anything.  (But we have to stick 

  'about life' after that.  If all you learn is that Abe Lincoln was 

  a US President, it's not a novel, you could read a fourth grade history 

  book for that.  So you have to learn something about life and living,

  especially as it relates to life on this planet.)


	Now that my definition is clear (I hope), I can define the

  criteria for a good novel.  Above all, it must fulfill the definition

  above.  It can do this using any/all of the techniques below, and 

  probably many more that I just haven't thought of right now at this

  moment:

	Characterization: REAL people.  No Batmans or soap opera types, but

			  people that you run into in everyday life, or ones

			  that you WISH you'd run into.  I can't say I've

		       	  ever known a Cliff Huxtable, but I've encountered

			  many a Jason Compson.

	Description,
	
 	Imagery:	  I want lots of good descriptions and imagery that

			  is useful (relates to themes and ideas).  Good

			  stuff will make you want to read a book at one 

			  sitting, and good images will remain in your

			  memory for a long time.  (I still remember 

			  reading Joyce's "The Boarding House" and the

			  images that the poor Irish house was given.)

	Plot:		  I like suprises, but if a plot is all suprise and

			  just a trip from point A to point B, it's boring

			  and no fun to read, especially the second time

			  around.  So I like complex plots that use all of

			  these other things and tie it all back to the 

			  theme.  The more interprative the better.

	Setting:	  I'm VERY myopic about this.  I will NOT read 

			  anything about Russia, Europe, or Egypt.  I like

			  settings that I can relate to, so American novels

			  only, please.

	Motifs:		  To me a novel is like a piece of music, and motifs,

			  like music, blend the themes together, sometimes

			  recurring at different volume levels and tones.

			  I like that.

	Tone,
	Atmosphere:	  This kind of stuff I really get into, also.  

			  To me, atmosphere and tone are EXTREMELY important

			  elements of fiction, partly because they portray 

			  the author's feeling, and if you don't know the

			  feeling, you can't interpret it.  (Well, to me, 

			  anyway)

	Point of View:    I put trust in the author in that he/she has

			  written the novel in the best point of view for

		 	  it.  (Does this make sense?)


	And now, my two favorites and two worst:

	WORST

	Moll Flanders:	  I respect DeFoe, he was the first novel writer, and

			  his journalistic quality is really getting 'hip'

			  again, with people like Thomas Woolfe and the New

			  Journalism (there's nothing new under the sun).

			  But, the characters were so shallow and it was so

			  old of a book that it got in the way of my reading.

	Pride and Prejudice:The characters were like "Dangerous Liasons", 

			  they didn't do anything.  Unless I win the lottery,

			  I'll never be able to relate to them.

	BEST

	The Sound and the Fury:If I could only get MY thoughts down on

			  paper like Faulkner did!!

	Native Son:	  It was gripping and it made me look at racial

			  prejudice from a different perspective.  That's

			  one thing I really can't stand and so I was

			  intrigued while reading this novel.  Besides,

			  when I was at the library taking it out, this

		   	  old man said to me, "I saw that play 35 years ago

		          at the Hanna."  And his eyes lit up like he really

			  enjoyed it.
